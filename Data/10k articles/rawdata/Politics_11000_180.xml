The '''2007–08 Kenyan crisis''' was a political, economic, and humanitarian crisis that erupted in [[Kenya]] after former  [[List of heads of state of Kenya|President]] [[Mwai Kibaki]] was declared the winner of the [[Kenyan presidential election, 2007|presidential election]] held on December 27, 2007. Supporters of Kibaki's opponent, [[Raila Odinga]] of the [[Orange Democratic Movement]], alleged [[electoral fraud|electoral manipulation]]. This was widely confirmed by international observers,&lt;ref name=Share&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7268903.stm |title=Kenya rivals agree to share power |publisher=BBC News |date=February 28, 2008 |accessdate=March 1, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080229154755/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7268903.stm| archivedate= February 29, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; as being perpetrated by both parties in the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2008/09/18/uk-kenya-election-idUKLI38786120080918|title=Kenya's election seen as badly flawed|publisher=Reuters|date=September 18, 2008|accessdate=October 8, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014134935/http://uk.reuters.com/article/2008/09/18/uk-kenya-election-idUKLI38786120080918|archivedate=October 14, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In part due to the ethnic and geographic diversity of Kenyan politics, no singular narrative can explain the reaction of opposition supporters to the announcement of Kibaki's swearing-in, which was done on December 30, 2007 in the evening. In addition to staging several non-violent protests, opposition supporters went on a violent rampage killing [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyus]]. [[Raila Odinga]] encouraged supporters to engage in mass protests which he announced on local television and radio stations, most noticeably in [[Mombasa]], [[Eldoret]], [[Kericho]], [[Kisumu]], [[Nakuru]] and parts of [[Nairobi]]. Police shot hundreds of violent demonstrators, including a few in front of TV news cameras, causing more violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtFhwgyeVyI&amp;feature=related |title=Police kill unarmed civilian |publisher=[[Kenya Television Network|KTN]] |date=January 16, 2008 |accessdate=July 11, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110702132408/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtFhwgyeVyI&amp;feature=related |archivedate=July 2, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=(AFP) – Jan 26, 2008 |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jP2F5mh8PLTGOmbvw5hFR35VFGDg |title=AFP: Politician's portrait marks border in Kenyan slum |publisher=Google |date=January 26, 2008 |accessdate=May 1, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520174412/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jP2F5mh8PLTGOmbvw5hFR35VFGDg |archivedate=May 20, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Targeted ethnic violence (as opposed to violent protests) escalated and at first was directed mainly against Kikuyu people—the community of which Kibaki is a member—living outside their traditional settlement areas, especially in the [[Rift Valley Province]].&lt;ref name=ODI&gt;Samir Elhawary (2008) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=1522&amp;title=crisis-kenya-land-displacement Crisis in Kenya: land, displacement and the search for 'durable solutions'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226064907/http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=1522&amp;title=crisis-kenya-land-displacement |date=February 26, 2010 }} [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; The violence started with the murder of over 50 unarmed Kikuyu women and children, some as young as a month old, by locking them in a church and burning them alive in Kiambaa village near Eldoret, on [[New Year's Day]]. Tensions in the Rift Valley have caused violence in several previous Kenyan elections, most notably in the [[1992 Kenyan Elections]]. This prompted the Kikuyu to start defending themselves which forced the [[Luo people of Kenya and Tanzania|Luo]]s and [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]]s to stop the killings of the Kikuyus.

In Mombasa, the Kenyan coastal residents took to the streets to protest the electoral manipulations and support their preferred candidate, Odinga. Tensions rose as the landless indigenous Coastal communities felt this was a time to avenge the grabbing of their land by mainly up–country Kikuyu. Looters also struck a number of stores in Mombasa. The slums of Nairobi saw some of the worst violence, some of it ethnically motivated, some expression of outrage at extreme poverty, and some the actions of criminal gangs. The violence continued sporadically for several months, particularly in the Rift Valley.

Former [[UN Secretary General]] [[Kofi Annan]] arrived in the country about a month after the election and successfully brought the two sides to the negotiating table. On February 28, 2008, Kibaki and Odinga signed a power-sharing agreement called the [[National Accord and Reconciliation Act 2008]], which established the office of the Prime Minister and created a [[coalition government]].&lt;ref name=Key&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7269476.stm |title=Key points: Kenya power-sharing deal |publisher=BBC News |date=February 28, 2008 |accessdate=March 1, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080303050904/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7269476.stm| archivedate= March 3, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The power-sharing Cabinet, headed by Odinga as Prime Minister, was eventually named on April 13, after lengthy negotiations over its composition;&lt;ref name=Forty&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/2D1674A2-3AF1-47C8-B687-A7D530EC8BD2.htm "Kenya unveils 40-seat cabinet"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614151908/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/2D1674A2-3AF1-47C8-B687-A7D530EC8BD2.htm |date=June 14, 2008 }}, Al Jazeera, April 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; it was sworn in on April 17.&lt;ref name=PM&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/E991FAE0-2FD8-4B72-AFE7-0C2B1F9E89FC.htm "Odinga sworn in as Kenya PM"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526092152/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/E991FAE0-2FD8-4B72-AFE7-0C2B1F9E89FC.htm |date=May 26, 2008 }}, Al Jazeera, April 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Kenyan presidential election, 2007}}
[[File:Raila and the media.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Orange Democratic Movement]] leader [[Raila Odinga]] speaks with Kenyan media]]
The post-election demonstration and violence stemmed from a mixture of motives. Some included:
*Voting in elections has widely been along ethnic lines in many Kenyan communities&lt;ref name="Ethnic Politicking"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bernardi|first=Nikita|title=Kenya's Coalitions of Convenience and Ethnic Politicking|url=http://thinkafricapress.com/kenya/coalitions-convenience-and-ethnic-politicking-tana-delta|work=Think Africa Press|accessdate=11 December 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121215143514/http://thinkafricapress.com/kenya/coalitions-convenience-and-ethnic-politicking-tana-delta|archivedate=December 15, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Widespread perception that the count of the presidential election was modified in favour of Kibaki
*During colonial times Kikuyu people were displaced from their fertile highlands and after independence they were settled outside their traditional areas especially in the Rift Valley, where the ethnic [[Maasai people]] had populated originally before Kenya's colonization by the [[British Empire|British]].&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7213211.stm | work=BBC News | title=Kenya's geographic and political rift | date=January 28, 2008 | accessdate=April 22, 2010 | first=Mark | last=Doyle | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929215008/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7213211.stm | archivedate=September 29, 2009 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A belief among other tribes that the Kikuyu community in Kenya has dominated the country since independence&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kenyaredcross.org/UserFiles/File/Kenya_Ethnic_Clashes-Info_Bulletin_No.4-25.7.07.pdf "Information Bulletin; Kenya: Ethnic Clashes"], Kenyan Red Cross Society, July 25, 2007.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216043727/http://www.kenyaredcross.org/UserFiles/File/Kenya_Ethnic_Clashes-Info_Bulletin_No.4-25.7.07.pdf |date=February 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports by international observers about manipulations and admissions by members of the [[Electoral Commission of Kenya]] that their staff provided them with incorrect figures have further fuelled this anger.&lt;ref name="scores"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7165602.stm |title=Scores Dead in Kenya Poll Clashes |publisher=BBC |date=December 31, 2007 |accessdate=December 31, 2007 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080101153836/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7165602.stm| archivedate= January 1, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The violence has been directed mainly against [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyus]], belonging to the same ethnic group as Kibaki.&lt;ref name=Jeff&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/31/world/africa/31kenya.html |work=The New York Times |first=Jeffrey |last=Gettleman |title=Disputed Vote Plunges Kenya Into Bloodshed |date=December 31, 2007 |accessdate=April 13, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110325070737/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/31/world/africa/31kenya.html |archivedate=March 25, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The violence against Kikuyus occurred all over the country but was higher in areas like the Nairobi slums, [[Nyanza Province]], the [[Rift Valley Province, Kenya|Rift Valley]], and the Coast, where opposition against Kibaki is particularly strong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Scores dead in Kenya poll clashes | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7165602.stm#map | accessdate = February 24, 2008 | work = BBC News | date = December 31, 2007 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080101153836/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7165602.stm#map | archivedate = January 1, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ethnically diverse Nairobi slums have also seen violence by Kikuyu-dominated groups—amongst them the infamous [[Mungiki]]—against neighbours hailing from western parts of Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=104196 "Kenya poll violence deaths hit 300"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=The Rambling Man |fix-attempted=yes }}, Reuters (abs-cbnnews.com), January 2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[BBC]] reporter saw 40 bodies with gunshot wounds in a mortuary in [[Kisumu]], which was the opposition's main base. A witness also told them that armed police shot protesters at a rally. There were running battles in the [[Nairobi]] slums. The local KTN television station said that 124 people died nationwide in the first two days of unrest.&lt;ref name="scores" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200712310456.html |title=Kenya: Death and Chaos After Kibaki Win |publisher=The Nation (Nairobi) |date=December 31, 2007 |accessdate=December 31, 2007 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080103085403/http://allafrica.com/stories/200712310456.html| archivedate= January 3, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 31, 2007, police reported that 40 people were killed in Nairobi and 53 in Kisumu, a major support base for Odinga. Four bodies were discovered in [[Mathare]], in Nairobi, seven people were killed in [[Nakuru]], and four people found dead in a village near [[Kapsabet]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/E952236D-EA1E-47D0-9BB6-0012EC14AAC8.htm "Election riots worsen in Kenya"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103075747/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/E952236D-EA1E-47D0-9BB6-0012EC14AAC8.htm |date=January 3, 2008 }}, Al Jazeera, December 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rallies===

Odinga said that the million-strong rally in his support planned for January 3 would take place in spite of a government ban, and he accused the government of being directly responsible for "genocide". Electoral Commission Chairman Kivuitu said on January 1, that he had been pressured by the PNU and ODM-Kenya to announce results immediately, despite the urgings of Western ambassadors to delay the results so that concerns about irregularities could be addressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.smh.com.au/up-to-50-people-killed-in-kenya-church/20080102-1jt7.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | first=Elizabeth | last=Kennedy | title=Up to 50 people killed in Kenya church | date=January 2, 2008 | accessdate=April 13, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303014425/http://news.smh.com.au/up-to-50-people-killed-in-kenya-church/20080102-1jt7.html | archivedate=March 3, 2008 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 3, opposition supporters attempted to gather for the planned rally in [[Uhuru Park]], but police fought them off with tear gas and water cannons. Another attempt to hold the rally was planned for January 4. Also on January 3, Kibaki said that he was willing to engage in dialogue "once the country is calm", and he described the continuing violence as "senseless", while Attorney General [[Amos Wako]] called for a recount, an investigation into the election, and the formation of a national unity government, saying that the situation was "quickly degenerating into a catastrophe of unimaginable proportions".&lt;ref name=Plans&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/africa/01/03/kenya.violence/ |publisher=CNN |title=Opposition plans rally in Nairobi |date=January 4, 2008 |accessdate=April 13, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225101040/http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/africa/01/03/kenya.violence/ |archivedate=February 25, 2008 |df=mdy }} &lt;/ref&gt; Finance Minister [[Amos Kimunya]] said that if the ODM did not allege fraud, that would make it easier for the two sides to talk; Kimunya also said that the government wanted to mediate through Kenyan elders and did not want international mediation involving the African Union.

===Kufuor mediation===
On January 6, Odinga called for rallies to be held on January 8, despite the government's insistence that the rallies would be illegal. Odinga's spokesman said that while the ODM ruled out a government of national unity, it could discuss "a coalition government with genuine power sharing" (which it said would leave less power for Kibaki than would be the case in a national unity government) or establishing an interim government to hold a new election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/01/06/africa/AF-GEN-Kenya-Election-Violence.php "Kenyan opposition leader willing to discuss power sharing, calls mass rallies"], Associated Press (''International Herald Tribune''), January 6, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Odinga subsequently cancelled the rallies planned for January 8,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7174670.stm| work=BBC News| title=Kenya opposition cancels protests| date=January 7, 2008| accessdate=April 13, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110152443/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7174670.stm| archivedate=January 10, 2008| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sight&gt;Lucas Barasa and Rachel Ombaka, [http://www.nationmedia.com/dailynation/nmgcontententry.asp?category_id=1&amp;newsid=114181 "End of turmoil in sight as AU boss jets in"], ''Daily Nation'', January 8, 2008.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120214327/http://www.nationmedia.com/dailynation/nmgcontententry.asp?category_id=1&amp;newsid=114181 |date=January 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; saying that the mediation process, facilitated by Ghanaian President and African Union Chairman [[John Kufuor]], was about to begin, with Kibaki having officially invited Kufuor, and that negotiations needed to take place in a peaceful atmosphere.&lt;ref name=Sight/&gt; Odinga said that he anticipated direct talks involving both himself and Kibaki, with Kufuor's participation. Foreign Minister [[Raphael Tuju]] said that by calling off the rallies, Odinga opened the way for negotiation and reconciliation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/E458D123-7FEA-420D-8E78-545DC4E37D85.htm "Kenya leaders agree to talk"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080108195015/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/E458D123-7FEA-420D-8E78-545DC4E37D85.htm |date=January 8, 2008 }}, Al Jazeera, January 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

There exist doubts that Kibaki really invited Kufuor (as opposed to him having come as a result of international concern for the worsening situation in Kenya).{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} PNU members of parliament, newly appointed cabinet ministers and even the government spokesman, Dr Alfred Mutua, are known to have said Kufuor "was coming to take tea", and not to "negotiate with the warring factions regarding the elections"; this was captured both on TV and print media. In addition, the PNU side was actively downplaying the seriousness of the post-election crisis, saying that this was a local problem that would be dealt with locally. It even urged the displaced people at various police stations and camps to 'return home' and generally tried to dissuade international attention to the crisis. It is also worth noting that there were conflicting reports from Ghanaian weblogs about President Kufuor's visit. Some weblogs said he was not going to travel to Kenya, since the government did not view him as a welcome visitor, others saying he was required by his official responsibility as AU chairman to try to resolve the crisis in Kenya. Just before Kufuor's travel to Kenya, Moses Wetang'ula, the new Minister for Foreign Affairs travelled to Ghana to 'brief Mr. Kufuor' on the situation in Kenya, ahead of his trip to Kenya. These actions were perceived to be an indication of bad faith on the part of Kibaki and his team, and they preempted their bias against the talks between President Kibaki (and his PNU side) and Raila (and his ODM side). There were also indications that PNU did not want the discussion to be mediated by an outsider.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Odinga refused to accept Kibaki's offer to hold talks unless they took place as part of international mediation, saying that without having Kufuor present to mediate the talks would be a "sideshow" and a "public relations gimmick", and he claimed that Kibaki was using the offer of talks between himself and Odinga to divert attention from Kufuor.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolo Gnecchi, [http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/news/international/Kenya_s_Odinga_rejects_bilateral_talks_with_government.html?siteSect=143&amp;sid=8602773&amp;cKey=1199802269000&amp;ty=ti "Kenya's Odinga rejects bilateral talks with government"], Reuters (swissinfo), January 8, 2008.  {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Frazer said on January 7, that there had been rigging in the election, but she said that both sides could have engaged in rigging.

Roads and Public Works Minister [[John Michuki]] said on January 14, that Annan was not coming at the government's invitation and reiterated the claim that Kibaki won the election. EU Development Commissioner [[Louis Michel]] said on the same day that EU aid to Kenya could be reduced as a result of the election.

Annan said that he believed the first three of these four points could be resolved within seven to 15 days, and he said that an agreement had been reached on 18 measures to end the violence, including the demobilization of gangs and ceasing speeches and text messages that incite hatred and violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7223200.stm| work=BBC News| title=Kenyan parties 'agree peace plan'| date=February 1, 2008| accessdate=April 13, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207035934/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7223200.stm| archivedate=February 7, 2008| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Violence nevertheless continued; on the next day at least 20 people were reported to have been killed since the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7224214.stm| work=BBC News| title=Violence follows Kenya peace plan| date=February 2, 2008| accessdate=April 13, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206135121/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7224214.stm| archivedate=February 6, 2008| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 3, Odinga called for African Union peacekeepers to be sent to Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/7A56C073-43E4-49DA-930C-99CFBCCBE3BE.htm "Odinga urges peacekeepers for Kenya"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204032654/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/7A56C073-43E4-49DA-930C-99CFBCCBE3BE.htm |date=February 4, 2008 }}, Al Jazeera, February 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The alternative possibility of a transitional coalition government, in which a new position of Prime Minister would be created for Odinga and Kibaki's power would be reduced, was something Odinga said he could consider, although it was not the option he preferred.&lt;ref&gt;Fiana Forde, [http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=68&amp;art_id=vn20080205111631860C283390 "Withdrawal threat to peace talks"], ''Daily News'' (South Africa), February 5, 2008, page 5.

Opposing plans for a meeting of foreign ministers from the countries of the East African [[Intergovernmental Authority on Development]] (IGAD) in Kenya, Nyongo said that the ODM would hold protests if the meeting went ahead, believing that the meeting would be a means to legitimize Kibaki's government. Annan was critical of this threat, saying that "provocative statements outside negotiations" were supposed to be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/37086AF4-CC11-4079-A4BC-45034E6BF7B4.htm "Kenya opposition threatens protests"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208060851/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/37086AF4-CC11-4079-A4BC-45034E6BF7B4.htm |date=February 8, 2008 }}, Al Jazeera, February 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The government subsequently said that the meeting would not officially be considered an IGAD meeting, and the ODM called off the protests on February 6,.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=68&amp;art_id=nw20080207064044143C751931 "East African statesmen converge in Kenya"], AFP (''IOL''), February 7, 2008.

On February 7, the two sides remained deeply divided in talks, although they agreed that there should not be a recount of votes. Annan said that he was "totally opposed to a re-election in this climate", referring to the persistent violence. Meanwhile, the [[United Nations Security Council]] called for peaceful resolution of the dispute through negotiations, the United States imposed a travel ban on ten unnamed Kenyans (a move that was praised by Kibaki's government), and a policeman, Edward Kirui, was arrested for allegedly shooting two protesters to death in Kisumu on January 16,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7232372.stm| work=BBC News| title=Murder charges for Kenya police| date=February 7, 2008| accessdate=April 13, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213022031/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7232372.stm| archivedate=February 13, 2008| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the same day, as talks approached a potential agreement, talks were moved to a secret location, with Annan requesting a "complete news blackout" and asking participants in the talks to not disclose what was under discussion.

It was reported that the government side wanted Kibaki to retain strong executive powers, while the opposition wanted Odinga to have extensive powers in a new position of Prime Minister. According to Annan, they were about to take "the last difficult and frightening step" to conclude a deal, and he said that he intended to remain in Kenya until a new government was in place, by which time he thought the process would be "irreversible". The commission charged with reviewing the election was to be established by March 15, with a report to follow within three to six months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/D8C3E21B-4086-46CF-B03F-0F46CEE3853E.htm "Kenya peace deal 'very close'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220022358/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/D8C3E21B-4086-46CF-B03F-0F46CEE3853E.htm |date=February 20, 2008 }}, Al Jazeera, February 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]] arrived in Kenya to support the talks on February 18. Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Wetangula said that help was welcome but he stressed that ultimately the problem had to be solved by Kenyans and that no one should make the "mistake of putting a gun to anybody's head and saying 'either/or'" in an attempt to force a solution. Rice met with Kibaki, Odinga, and Annan, and she emphasized the importance of reaching a settlement, saying that one should have already been in place; however, she also said that the U.S. was not trying to "dictate a solution to Kenyans".&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/039B5239-0509-4B7C-A20E-21805111F7D7.htm "Rice calls for Kenya power-sharing"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220204345/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/039B5239-0509-4B7C-A20E-21805111F7D7.htm |date=February 20, 2008 }}, Al Jazeera, February 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The agreement also provides for two Deputy Prime Ministers, one for each of the two parties, while the allotment of Cabinet portfolios is to reflect the relative strength of the respective parties in the National Assembly. The Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Ministers can only be removed from their positions if they lose a no-confidence vote in the National Assembly.&lt;ref name=Key/&gt; Kibaki said that he would reconvene the National Assembly on March 6, so that it could make the constitutional changes needed in order to implement the agreement.&lt;ref name=Reach/&gt;

Speaking in the National Assembly when it convened on March 6, Kibaki urged it to quickly pass the legislation required to implement the power-sharing agreement; he said that the people were watching and that they wanted to see "pragmatic solutions, not ideological posturing". He named four bills that the National Assembly needed to pass: the National Accord and Reconciliation Bill, a bill amending the constitution, a bill establishing [[The Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission of Kenya|the truth, justice and reconciliation commission]], and a bill dealing with ethnic issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/2C7EF2B4-C80B-4C6F-9776-2D9F7EB66896.htm "Kenya leader urges backing for deal"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308124931/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/2C7EF2B4-C80B-4C6F-9776-2D9F7EB66896.htm |date=March 8, 2008 }}, Al Jazeera, March 6, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 9–10, the army attacked the Sabaot Land Defence Force near Mount Elgon; this attack included aerial bombardment. 30,000 people were reported to have fled from the army's attack, although this number was disputed and the army said that it was "not intimidating or harassing residents".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/03/10/news/Kenya.php "Kenyan army crackdown reported in west; parliament to debate power-sharing agreement"], Associated Press (''International Herald Tribune''), March 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ODM, however, angrily rejected Muthaura's interpretation. William Ruto said that "Kenyans should treat Mr Muthaura's statement with the contempt it deserves" and that it was "uncalled for, unnecessary and contemptuous of the agreement".&lt;ref name=Muthaura/&gt; ODM spokesman Salim Lome said that it was unacceptable to have Odinga ranking third, as "a minor hanger-on", and that the ODM would never have agreed to such an arrangement.&lt;ref name=Jopson/&gt;

On March 11, a parliamentary committee made a request for the bills implementing the agreement to be fast-tracked, which would provide for them to be considered within five days, rather than two weeks.&lt;ref name=Fast/&gt; The National Assembly passed two bills implementing the agreement on March 18,. The first of these was the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, which passed unanimously with 200 votes in favor; this constitutionally established the posts of Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister. The amendment was followed by a law providing for those posts in a new government and detailing the terms of the power-sharing arrangement. Kibaki signed the bills into law a few hours later. He said that he was "now confident a permanent solution to the crisis will be achieved" and called for the drafting of a new constitution; meanwhile, Odinga called for a "national ethnic conference where we will have representatives from all the 42 tribes in the country come together to discuss openly how we want to lead this country".&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/C3806220-67C8-4033-9A6D-A7223B0CED65.htm "Kenyan leader signs power-share law"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080319210230/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/C3806220-67C8-4033-9A6D-A7223B0CED65.htm |date=March 19, 2008 }}, Al Jazeera, March 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of consultations on the composition of the new Cabinet, the ODM proposed a Cabinet with 34 members (twice the number in the partial Cabinet named by Kibaki in January), while the government proposed a Cabinet with 44 members. On April 1, a protest of about 100 people was held in Nairobi against these proposals on the grounds that it was unaffordable to have so many ministers and that having them would not serve a constructive purpose; the protesters demanded that the Cabinet be limited to no more than 24 members. This protest was broken up by police with tear gas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/F8B82C7C-A25B-4A03-BFE0-12E4A05899DC.htm "Kenyan police break up protest"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404033928/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/F8B82C7C-A25B-4A03-BFE0-12E4A05899DC.htm |date=April 4, 2008 }}, Al Jazeera, April 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In a statement on April 2, Annan expressed concerns about the length of time that it was taking to name a new Cabinet. He urged Kibaki and Odinga to put the national interest first, conclude consultations, and name a Cabinet with an equal division of power in line with the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apanews.net/apa.php?page=show_article_eng&amp;id_article=59561 "Kofi Annan worried about sluggishness in naming new Kenyan cabinet"], African Press Agency, April 2, 2008.  {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 3, the two sides announced that they had reached an agreement on the size and composition of the Cabinet. According to a statement from Kibaki's office, the new Cabinet would have 40 ministers, would be announced on April 6, and would be sworn in on April 12,.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/97982F33-F229-4527-80A3-255C23CCE9F6.htm "Kenya rivals break ministry impasse"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405083444/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/97982F33-F229-4527-80A3-255C23CCE9F6.htm |date=April 5, 2008 }}, Al Jazeera, April 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This Cabinet would be the largest in Kenya's history, and the announcement of its size was greeted with substantial dissatisfaction among the people, with many believing a 40-member Cabinet to be wasteful, unnecessary, and intended merely to provide additional jobs with which to reward politicians. The government argued that the large size of the Cabinet was needed in order for it to be properly inclusive. Alfred Mutua, the government spokesman, said that "there is no price that is too high for our country to ensure peace, harmony and reconciliation, healing and stability that will spur and grow the economy and create even more wealth", and he suggested that the cost would not be as great as anticipated because "most of the new ministries are subdivided from formerly existing ministries and therefore the budget and members of staff for those new ministries already exist."&lt;ref name=Delayed&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/D809BD8B-4545-4C37-99BF-4A6F128C5F74.htm "Kenya cabinet delayed over posts"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406202946/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/D809BD8B-4545-4C37-99BF-4A6F128C5F74.htm |date=April 6, 2008 }}, Al Jazeera, April 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 5, the day before the Cabinet was to be announced, the ODM said that the announcement had been delayed because there was still disagreement on the allotment of ministerial portfolios. The disagreement reportedly hinged on the particularly important portfolios of finance, local government, energy, and internal security. According to the government, the finance, defence, foreign affairs, and justice portfolios were to go to Kibaki's party, the PNU, while the ODM was to receive the roads, public works, tourism, and agriculture portfolios. Mutua said that Odinga had not submitted his list of proposed ministers to Kibaki, and he said that Kibaki had invited Odinga for talks on the morning of April 6,.&lt;ref name=Delayed/&gt; Kibaki and Odinga accordingly met, and afterwards they said in a joint statement that they had made "substantial progress" and that they expected an agreement to be reached in further talks on April 7,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7333050.stm |work=BBC News |title=No deal in Kenyan cabinet talks |date=April 7, 2008 |accessdate=April 13, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409230842/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7333050.stm |archivedate=April 9, 2008 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on April 8, the talks were suspended due to the continued disagreement; according to Nyongo, they were suspended "until [the PNU] fully recognises the 50/50 power-sharing arrangement and the principle of portfolio balance". Odinga said that he had received a letter from the PNU, which asserted that "the constitution grants the president exclusive executive powers to run his country on his own and ... his powers supersede the provisions of the accord". Meanwhile, a protest in Kibera was broken up by police with tear gas; this was the largest protest to occur since the agreement was signed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/36FA024F-C85B-4E2B-84DB-3F6838CB70C7.htm "Kenya opposition suspends talks"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409125445/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/36FA024F-C85B-4E2B-84DB-3F6838CB70C7.htm |date=April 9, 2008 }}, Al Jazeera, April 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Odinga and the Cabinet were sworn in on April 17, 2008 at State House.

===After the formation of the unity government===
In the absence of an opposition due to the formation of the coalition government, more than 70 backbencher MPs supported the creation of a coalition opposition, feeling that it was important to have an opposition for the sake of democratic governance. However, on May 22, 2008, the Cabinet decided to oppose the creation of such an opposition, saying that it would be unconstitutional and would violate the spirit of the coalition. On the same day, the Cabinet decided to fast-track the commission of inqu your trash ry that is intended to investigate the causes of the violence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apanews.net/apa.php?page=show_article_eng&amp;id_article=64462 "Kenya: Government opposes formation of opposition"], African Press Agency, May 23, 2008.  {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; A proposed bill that would allow the backbenchers to create an official opposition (the National Assembly (Parliamentary Opposition) Bill 2008) was published in August 2008 and was passed a few months later.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Ndegwa, [http://www.eastandard.net/InsidePage.php?id=1143992680&amp;cid=4 "‘Opposition’ MPs edge closer to recognition as Bill is published"], ''The Standard'' (Kenya), August 16, 2008.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113062815/http://www.eastandard.net/InsidePage.php?id=1143992680&amp;cid=4 |date=January 13, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the two vacancies in Parliament created by the killing of ODM MPs Mugabe Were and David Too, results were never announced in two parliamentary constituencies due to violence, and another vacancy was produced by the election of Kenneth Marende as Speaker of Parliament. The five by-elections to fill these seats were to be held on June 11, 2008. During the campaigning for the by-elections, which concluded on June 9, the politics of ethnicity was again evident, causing anxiety among some observers; increased tension was also evident between the PNU and the ODM. The ODM alleged that some PNU ministers were guilty of "openly bribing voters, intimidating ODM supporters and misusing state resources", and ODM minister [[William Ole Ntimama]] said that his party "watched with dismay as our coalition partners sink to new lows without any regard for the consequences which may flow". The issue of a possible amnesty for those arrested in connection with the violence also proved to be controversial. Vice-President Musyoka downplayed the tension, saying that campaigning had "not interfered in any way with the smooth operations of the coalition".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=87&amp;art_id=nw20080609190845942C967367 "Kenyan by-elections will test new coalition"], Sapa-AFP (''IOL''), June 9, 2008.

Later in January, Human Rights Watch accused "ODM politicians and local leaders" of organizing, instigating and facilitating violence against Kikuyus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Kenyan ethnic attacks 'planned' | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7206658.stm | accessdate =February 24, 2008 |work=BBC News | date=January 24, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080307051922/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7206658.stm| archivedate= March 7, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC reported on March 5, that government officials had met with members of the [[Mungiki]] militia, which is banned, at State House to arrange for the militia to protect Kiyukus. The government denied this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7279149.stm |work=BBC News |title=State 'sanctioned' Kenyan clashes |date=March 5, 2008 |accessdate=April 13, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418025654/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7279149.stm |archivedate=April 18, 2008 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional implications==
The violence in Kenya has had serious economic ramifications throughout East Africa, particularly for the landlocked countries of the Great Lakes region ([[Uganda]], Rwanda, [[Burundi]], and eastern parts of the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Kenya crisis: Spectre of economic collapse sends shivers through EA | url=http://www.nationmedia.com/EastAfrican/current/News/news070120081.htm | accessdate =February 24, 2008 | year = 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080109145953/http://www.nationmedia.com/eastafrican/current/News/news070120081.htm|archivedate=January 9, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; These countries depend upon Kenyan infrastructure links (particularly the port at [[Mombasa]]) for important imports as well as export routes. Significant shortages of gasoline were reported in [[Uganda]] as well as [[Zanzibar]] following the elections. The [[East African Community]], despite having election observers in Kenya, did not issue a statement.

==Reactions==
A government spokesman claimed that Odinga's supporters were "engaging in [[ethnic cleansing]]".&lt;ref name="diplomatic push" /&gt; Odinga countered that Kibaki's camp was "guilty, directly, of [[genocide]]"&lt;ref name="diplomatic push" /&gt; as he called for international mediation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Raila takes the lead in search for a way out |work=The Standard |location=Hong Kong |url=http://www.eastandard.net/news/?id=1143979878&amp;cid=4 | accessdate =February 24, 2008 | year = 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080207061448/http://www.eastandard.net/news/?id=1143979878&amp;cid=4| archivedate= February 7, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible continuation==
The UN had warned that a repeat of the problems could occur after the [[Kenyan presidential election, 2013|next election]] unless Kenya strengthens its institutions and the perpetrators of the 2007 violence are punished. A BBC report in 2009 found that rival groups in [[Rift Valley Province]], such as the Kalenjin and Kikuyu, were purchasing firearms such as [[AK-47]] and [[Heckler &amp; Koch G3|G3]] rifles, in readiness for anticipated violence at the 2013 poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8293745.stm |work=BBC News |title=Kenyans 'rearming for 2012 poll' |date=October 7, 2009 |accessdate=October 7, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007100851/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8293745.stm |archivedate=October 7, 2009 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is, however, concerted efforts from the civil society to help avert such an eventuality. There is even a campaign dubbed The Wazi Campaign,&lt;ref&gt;[[Wazi campaign]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Wazi Campaign&lt;/ref&gt; that aims to prevent the recurrence of the violence through the use of animated cartoon PSAs that preach peace. Despite these concerns, Kenya had a peaceful election in 2013 with a record 85.91% voter turnout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-21723488 | work=BBC News | title=Kenya election: Uhuru Kenyatta wins presidency | date=March 9, 2013 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312005656/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-21723488 | archivedate=March 12, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''2011 Northern Ireland riots''' were a series of riots between 20 June 2011 and 16 July 2011, starting originally in [[Belfast]], before spreading to other parts of [[Northern Ireland]]. They were initiated by the [[Ulster Volunteer Force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/jun/27/the-truth-about-belfasts-riots|title=The truth about Belfast's riots - Henry McDonald|first=Henry|last=McDonald|date=27 June 2011|website=Theguardian.com|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==June riots==
The sectarian violence began around 21:00 BST on the night of Monday 20 June, when a large number of [[Ulster loyalism|loyalists]] made their way from the [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]] Mount and Castlereagh Street areas to the [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]] [[Short Strand]] enclave.&lt;ref name="BBC3"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-13854027 BBC] – Belfast violence flares again as police attacked&lt;/ref&gt; This provoked a response from the nationalists.&lt;ref name="BBC3"/&gt; The [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] (PSNI) [[Assistant Chief Constable]] Alistair Finlay said that around 500–600 people were involved in the rioting.&lt;ref name="RTE"&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0622/belfast.html RTE] – Call for urgent talks in Belfast communities&lt;/ref&gt; According to the PSNI, the riots are said to have been initially instigated by the [[Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/jun/22/belfast-riots-setback-peace-process The Guardian] – Belfast riots: a setback for area barely reshaped by peace process&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UTV"&gt;[http://www.u.tv/News/UVF-blamed-for-Belfast-riots/c76968fa-6384-410a-b853-9e9354e6f575 UTV] -UVF 'organised' east Belfast riot&lt;/ref&gt;

The clashes saw various dangerous objects such as petrol bombs, bricks, bottles, fireworks and smoke bombs thrown by both sides in what police described as "high-level, life-threatening, organised, serious and sustained" attack by people "hell-bent on disorder".&lt;ref name="UTV"/&gt; At one point six shots were fired from the nationalist Short Strand area followed by about five shots from the loyalist Pitt Park.&lt;ref name="UTV"/&gt; Two shots hit a police [[Land Rover Tangi|Land Rover]] in what the PSNI claimed was attempted murder of their officers.&lt;ref name="BBC3"/&gt; One officer suffered eye injuries when a laser pen was being used to blind officers.&lt;ref name="UTV"/&gt;

The riots in Short Strand was described by politicians as the worst violence in the area in a decade.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2011/06/201162117510847754.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On the Tuesday night, during further clashes between unionists and nationalists, about 700 people were involved. A photographer was shot in the leg by a gunman firing from the nationalist area, which police blamed on [[dissident republicans]].&lt;ref name="RTE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC1"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-13886616 BBC] – Belfast flashpoint largely quiet after day of talks&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC2"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-13873307 BBC] – Police say dissidents behind photographer shooting&lt;/ref&gt;

By Wednesday 22 June, discussions were held between community representatives, politicians, and loyalist and nationalist figures. The end result was for both sides to police their own communities to avoid further violence.{{cn|date=November 2015}} Later that night the area was largely peaceful despite unionist and nationalist groups – held back by community marshals – being involved for several hours in a stand-off at the Mountpottinger Road end of the Short Strand until around 01:30 on Thursday morning.&lt;ref name="BBC1"/&gt; Nationalist marshals intervened to stop nationalist youths attacking police Land Rovers.&lt;ref name="BBC1"/&gt;

A 20-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of possessing an offensive weapon and assaulting police,&lt;ref name="RTE"/&gt; which was followed on the Wednesday by the arrest of a 22-year-old man from West Belfast in relation to the rioting.&lt;ref name="BBC1"/&gt;

==July riots==
A riot broke out on 1 July 2011 in Castlereagh Street and Mountpottinger Road, where the police used water cannons again to stop rioting continuing into the night.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}

On 9 July, loyalist rioters attacked the PSNI in [[Ballyclare]] after the PSNI removed [[Union Flag|Union]] and paramilitary flags from outside a Catholic church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.u.tv/News/Leaders-urge-calm-after-weekend-disorder/2cc20104-b49a-4094-98f2-9f6071f18bf5 Leaders urge calm after weekend disorder], u.tv; accessed 23 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Expected riots broke out on [[Eleventh Night|11 July]] and nationalist rioters attacked the PSNI in the Oldpark and Broadway areas of Belfast. The Royal Victoria Hospital's new £9 million extension was damaged. It is believed shots were fired.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-14116568 11 July riots in Belfast], bbc.co.uk; accessed 23 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

More expected rioting broke out the following day in nationalist areas of north and south Belfast following the annual [[Orange Order]] [[Twelfth of July]] parades. Trouble also broke out in [[Derry]], where police claimed people as young as ten were involved.

Responding to Iran's request for extradition of the [[Shah of Iran]] [[Muhammad Reza Pahlavi]], the [[President of the United States]], [[Jimmy Carter]], provided for the Shah's travel plans to [[Panama]] with the deliberate intention of eliminating the possibility of the extradition in exchange for hostages who were held by the revolutionary Iran for 444 days (November 4, 1979, to January 20, 1981) after a group of Iranian revolutionary students affiliated with [[Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line]] broke into and entered the [[Embassy of the United States, Tehran|Embassy of the United States of America]] in [[Tehran]], and took its diplomatic staff hostage, in contravention of international law, in response to the US providing political asylum for the Shah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chalk|first1=Peter|title=Encyclopedia of Terrorism (2 volume set)|date=2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0313308956|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=czK7lIU7m1oC&amp;pg=PT1000&amp;lpg=PT1000&amp;dq=were+held+hostage+for+444+days+November+4,+1979,+to+January+20,+1981)+after+a+group+of+Iranian+students+belonging+to+the+Muslim+Student+Followers+of+the+Imam%27s+Line+who+supported+the+Iranian+Revolution,+took+over+the+U.S.+Embassy+in+Tehran&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wEabWf9qJF&amp;sig=qD8t3TRMGae2xvupEVgvRtqG1RA&amp;hl=fa&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjPwqa40fbKAhUDGZoKHbSPChMQ6AEIOjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=were%20held%20hostage%20for%20444%20days%20(November%204%2C%201979%2C%20to%20January%2020%2C%201981)%20after%20a%20group%20of%20Iranian%20students%20belonging%20to%20the%20Muslim%20Student%20Followers%20of%20the%20Imam's%20Line%20who%20supported%20the%20Iranian%20Revolution%2C%20took%20over%20the%20U.S.%20Embassy%20in%20Tehran&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "keyhan"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.magiran.com/ppdf/nppdf/2827/p02827211700061.pdf | title=Firm responses to void threats - Imam Khomeini said: America can't do a damn thing against us. | work=Kayhan | date=30 September 2015 | accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week after the incident, the sheets and finances of Iran were confiscated by US{{clarify|date=February 2016}}.

The slogan appeared on many walls and banners such as a billboard along the Iran-Iraq border, a banner which was hung in front of the [[Iran–U.S. RQ-170 incident|U.S captured RQ-170 drone]] and a banner above which [[Ali Khamenei]] was speaking at an event commemorating the 25th anniversary Khamenei.{{clarify|date=February 2016}}&lt;ref name="Limbert"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Daily Mail"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pow|first1=Helen|title='America cannot do a damn thing': Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei taunts President Obama claiming he doesn't have the guts for a military attack|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2649625/America-damn-thing-Irans-supreme-leader-Ayatollah-Ali-Khamenei-claims-President-Obama-doesnt-guts-military-attack-speech.html|accessdate=30 January 2016|work=Daily Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3777">'''Baugrygr''' or '''Ringkvinna'''   was the term for an unmarried woman who had inherited the position of head of the family, usually from her father or brother, with all the tasks and rights associated with the position. The position existed in [[Scandinavia]] during the [[Viking era]] and into the [[middle ages]].

Ringkvinna is primarily mentioned in the [[Iceland]]ic [[Grágás]] and the Norwegian [[Frostathing Law|Frostating]] laws and [[Gulating]] laws, in which it is phrased in much the same way. Unmarried women in general, referred to as ''maer'' and ''mey'', were secure in their rights of independence: at the age of 20, a woman reached the right of legal majority and had the right to decide about her own place of residence and stand by herself in all juridical senses before the law.These same rights applied to widows.&lt;ref&gt;Borgström Eva {{sv icon}}: Makalösa kvinnor: könsöverskridare i myt och verklighet (Marvelous women : genderbenders in myth and reality) Alfabeta/Anamma, Stockholm 2002. {{ISBN|91-501-0191-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The one exception to her independence was the right to choose a marriage partner, which was a matter for the whole family.&lt;ref&gt;Borgström Eva{{sv icon}}: Makalösa kvinnor: könsöverskridare i myt och verklighet (Marvelous women : genderbenders in myth and reality) Alfabeta/Anamma, Stockholm 2002. {{ISBN|91-501-0191-9}} (inb.). Libris 8707902.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the absence of male relatives, an unmarried woman with no son could inherit the position as head of the family from a deceased father or brother.  Women with such status were referred to as ringkvinna.  She exercised all the rights afforded to the head of a family clan until she married at which time her rights were transferred to her husband.  The right to inherit in itself applied to both the paternal aunt, paternal niece and paternal granddaughter of the deceased, who were all named as ''odalkvinna'', but the right to inherit the position of head of the family was a right which could only be inherited by the daughter or the sister of a dead man.&lt;ref&gt;Borgström Eva{{sv icon}}: Makalösa kvinnor: könsöverskridare i myt och verklighet (Marvelous women : genderbenders in myth and reality) Alfabeta/Anamma, Stockholm 2002. {{ISBN|91-501-0191-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ringkvinna had the specific support of the law to perform all the tasks normally performed by a head of the family, such as, the right to demand and receive fines for the slaughter of a family member.&lt;ref&gt;Borgström Eva{{sv icon}}: Makalösa kvinnor: könsöverskridare i myt och verklighet (Marvelous women : genderbenders in myth and reality) Alfabeta/Anamma, Stockholm 2002. {{ISBN|91-501-0191-9}} (inb.). Libris 8707902.&lt;/ref&gt; If she married, however, these rights were passed on to her spouse. These rights were  preserved also after [[Christianization]] although they seem to have disappeared in the late 13th century, at which time they are no longer mentioned in any law texts.&lt;ref&gt;Borgström Eva{{sv icon}}: Makalösa kvinnor: könsöverskridare i myt och verklighet (Marvelous women : genderbenders in myth and reality) Alfabeta/Anamma, Stockholm 2002. {{ISBN|91-501-0191-9}} (inb.).

The '''Combat League of Revolutionary National Socialists''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Kampfgemeinschaft Revolutionärer Nationalsozialisten'', '''KGRNS'''), more commonly known as the '''Black Front''' ({{lang-de|Schwarze Front}}), was a political group formed by [[Otto Strasser]] after his expulsion from the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP) in 1930.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nT-psA9fj_AC&amp;pg=PA248&amp;dq=black+front+strasser&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiA5av0hYTTAhWkDsAKHQwwClIQ6AEILTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=black%20front%20strasser&amp;f=false|title=Who's Who in Nazi Germany|last=Wistrich|first=Robert S.|date=4 July 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136413810|pages=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strasser believed the original [[anti-capitalist]] nature of the [[NSDAP]] had been betrayed by [[Adolf Hitler]]. The Black Front was composed of former radical members of the NSDAP, who intended to cause a split in the main party. Strasser's organisation published a newspaper, ''The German Revolution''.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The Black Front adopted the crossed hammer and sword symbol which is still used by several [[Strasserism|Strasserite]] groupings today.

The organisation was unable to oppose the NSDAP effectively and Hitler’s rise to power proved to be the final straw. Strasser spent the years of the [[Third Reich]] in exile, first in [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]] and later in [[Canada]]. The social fascist wing of the NSDAP itself was eradicated in 1934 during the [[Night of the Long Knives]] in which [[Gregor Strasser]], Otto's elder brother, was killed.

==Activities==
When the [[Euromaidan]] movement started in 2013, Borotba were critical of it from the outset. Some members of Borotba, including Dennis Levine, attempted to recruit protesters to the Confederation of Independent Trade Unions of Ukraine to fight against increased public transport costs in Kiev. According to Svetlana Tsiberganova, they were attacked by the far-right.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.liva.com.ua/not-my-war.html Not My War, by Svetlana Tsiberganova&lt;/ref&gt;

Borotba's analysis of the authorities that replaced former President [[Viktor Yanukovych]] and the [[second Azarov government]] after the [[2014 Ukrainian revolution]] on 22 February 2014 is that [[Far-right politics|far-right]] [[Ukrainian nationalism|nationalists]] received too much power and control over important ministries and agencies including defense, anti-corruption and national security, education, agriculture and the environment, as well as the office of the [[Prosecutor General of Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger Annis.

In Kharkiv, Borotba activists claim to have printed 100,000 leaflets and 10,000 posters persuading the voters to boycott the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2014|presidential election in May 2014]], since they considered it unrepresentative, radical rightist, and illegitimate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://links.org.au/node/3866 Ukraine: 'Socialist prospects in south-eastern Ukraine'], ''Links International Journal of Socialist Renewal'', May 25, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
On March 3, 2014, several left and [[Anarchism|anarchist]] organizations in Ukraine, including the Autonomous Workers Union, the [[Direct Action (trade union)|"Direct Action" Independent Student Union]] and the Left Opposition socialist organization, criticized Borotba for alleged cooperation with conservative pro-Russian groups in Ukraine and allegedly spreading "overt lies and fact manipulations".&lt;ref name="avtonomia.net"/&gt; In a rebuttal, Borotba rejected the accusations as "hypocritical" and "irrelevant".{{r|Bor-SC}} Borotba states that it has regularly criticized Russian authorities and organized in solidarity with left-wing Russian organizations that met with repression from the Russian authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://borotba.su/borotba-solidarna-s-protestami-v-rossii-video.html|title=БОРОТЬБА солидарна с протестами в России (+ВИДЕО)|publisher=|accessdate=29 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141214051232/http://borotba.su/borotba-solidarna-s-protestami-v-rossii-video.html|archivedate=14 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1958, at the height of the [[Cold War]] and the infancy of the [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] (ICBM) threat, Prime Minister [[John Diefenbaker]] authorized the creation of close to 50 [[Emergency Government Headquarters]] (nicknamed "Diefenbunkers" by opposition parties&lt;ref name="Forces"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.forces.gc.ca/site/commun/ml-fe/article-eng.asp?id=6587|title=The Diefenbunker: Echoes from our past, or back to the future?|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629072313/http://www.forces.gc.ca/site/commun/ml-fe/article-eng.asp?id=6587|archivedate=June 29, 2013|date=November 17, 2010|work=The Maple Leaf|last=Thermidor|first=Emeline}}&lt;/ref&gt;) across Canada. These shelters were part of what came to be known as the [[Continuity of Government]] plan,&lt;ref name="Ottawa Museums"/&gt;&lt;ref name="diefenbunker.ca history"&gt;[http://diefenbunker.ca/pages/museum_history/index.shtml Diefenbunker, Canada's Cold War Museum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329213921/http://diefenbunker.ca/pages/museum_history/index.shtml |date=2013-03-29 }}. Retrieved March 15, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; which was meant to protect various members of government in the event of a nuclear attack.&lt;ref name="Forces"/&gt;

The original site, some {{convert|9.7|km|abbr=on}} east of [[Almonte, Ontario|Almonte]] ({{Coord|45|15|06.66|N|076|19|31.05|W|region:CA-ON_type:landmark|name=Almonte, Ontario}}) was abandoned when ground water proved impossible to remove. An abandoned gravel pit outside Carp was selected instead, construction began in 1959 and was completed by 1962.&lt;ref name="Forces"/&gt;

The Carp shelter would be the largest of such facilities (over {{Convert|9,300|m2|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="Ottawa Museums"/&gt;) and the only one in the immediate Ottawa area. The underground 4-storey bunker required 32,000 tonnes of concrete and 5,000 tonnes of steel. The structure was capable of withstanding a nuclear blast up to 5 megatons from {{convert|1.8|km|abbr=on}} away. It had massive blast doors at the surface, as well as extensive air filters to prevent radiation infiltration.&lt;ref name="Forces"/&gt; Although supposedly effective against surface nuclear detonations, the facility was later found to be vulnerable to conventional [[Bunker buster]] bombs developed after its construction, as these bombs had time delay fuses that would detonate after they had penetrated deeply enough underground.&lt;ref name="Forces"/&gt;

Underground storage was built for food, fuel, fresh water, and other supplies. The bunker was built to accommodate 565 people for up to one month without receiving additional supplies from the outside.&lt;ref name="Forces"/&gt; It included an emergency broadcast studio for the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]&lt;ref name="Forces"/&gt; and a vault on the lowest level to hold the gold reserves of the [[Bank of Canada]].

These facilities were administered by the [[Royal Canadian Corps of Signals]] (later the [[Communications and Electronics Branch]]). A decentralized transmitter site, the [[CFS Carp Richardson Detachment|Richardson Detachment]], with numerous transmitter antenna was located further to the west near Perth Ontario that was supported from a 2-storey underground facility of similar construction to the Carp facility but much smaller. Two radio receiving facilities, the [[CFS Carp Almonte Detachment]] and [[CFS Carp Dunrobin Detachment]], with a complete receiving antenna arrays were built in the region but all buildings were above ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rcsigs.ca/ViewUnit/59/ | title = CFS Carp - Units | accessdate = 2013-06-02 | quote = CFS Carp was to provide the administration, security and housekeeping services needed to maintain a constant state of operational readiness for all sites under its command; most importantly, the communication facilities at Carp, Richardson, Almonte and Dunrobin | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131023061701/http://www.rcsigs.ca/ViewUnit/59/ | archivedate = 2013-10-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CFS Carp was decommissioned in 1994&lt;ref name="Then and Now"&gt;Peters, Dave (April 2011). [http://www.mysteriesofcanada.com/Military/diefenbunker.htm "The 'Diefenbunker': Then and Now"] in ''Mysteries of Canada.'' Retrieved March 15, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; following the reduction in the [[Intercontinental Ballistic Missile|ICBM]] threat.

From 1959 to 1994, the site was owned and operated by the Government of Canada, Department of National Defence.&lt;ref name="diefenbunker.ca history"/&gt; After the local municipality took control of the facility in 1994, the community took a great interest in the bunker, requesting access to public tours of the facility.&lt;ref name="diefenbunker.ca history"/&gt; The local municipality took control of the facility and a group of local volunteers, recognizing the heritage and tourism value of the Carp Diefenbunker, undertook to open the facility as a cold war museum and conduct public tours. It was purchased by the Diefenbunker Development Group in 1998, and officially opened as a museum. The name of the facility was changed to the Diefenbunker, Canada's Cold War Museum&lt;ref name="diefenbunker.ca"/&gt; shortly thereafter. It is currently open year-round for public tours.&lt;ref name="Ottawa Museums"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Forces"/&gt;

Many areas of the bunker, including the PM's Suite, the Emergency Government Situation Centre, the CBC Emergency Broadcasting Studio, the Military Federal Warning Centre, the External Affairs Ministerial Office, the Public Works Minister's Office and the Bank of Canada Vault, are being restored to their operational condition. The rest of the 358 rooms have been converted to exhibits of the Cold War era.&lt;ref name="Then and Now"/&gt;

===Growth===
Upon its opening in 1998, the museum was run completely by volunteers. However, the 5,000 visitors received that year was too much to be handled solely by volunteers.&lt;ref name="diefenbunker.ca history"/&gt;

In 1999, the museum's second year of operation, a curator was hired along with some students. The museum's visitation doubled to 10,000 people that year.&lt;ref name="diefenbunker.ca history"/&gt;

The museum continued to grow into the 2000s. Close to 15,000 visitors passed through the Diefenbunker in 2000. Additional part-time staff was hired throughout the year to keep up with museum maintenance and upkeep. As of 2008, the Diefenbunker averages approximately 25,000 visitors each year. Four full-time staff, nine part-time staff and numerous volunteers work to keep the museum running smoothly. In 2012, the museum had 45,280 visitors. This was one of the highest increases in attendance other than the opening year of the Bunker.&lt;ref name="diefenbunker.ca history"/&gt;

The mandate of Diefenbunker, Canada's Cold War museum is "to increase throughout Canada and the world, interest in and a critical understanding of the Cold War, by preserving the Diefenbunker as a national historic site, and operating a Cold War Museum.&lt;ref name="diefenbunker.ca About"&gt;[http://diefenbunker.ca/pages/about_the_diefenbunker/index.shtml About the Diefenbunker] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130304192048/http://diefenbunker.ca/pages/about_the_diefenbunker/index.shtml |date=2013-03-04 }} in ''Diefenbunker, Canada's Cold War Museum''. Retrieved March 15, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections and research==
The Diefenbunker houses a collection of Cold War artefacts, an archive and a library, all of which are made available to researchers upon request, and to the general public through the exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://diefenbunker.ca/pages/collections_research/index.shtml Collections and Research] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130325082314/http://diefenbunker.ca/pages/collections_research/index.shtml |date=2013-03-25 }} in ''Diefenbunker, Canada's Cold War Museum.'' Retrieved March 15, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
The Diefenbunker: Canada's Cold War museum is a not-for-profit, charitable museum.&lt;ref name="diefenbunker.ca About"/&gt; It is funded privately;&lt;ref name="diefenbunker.ca About"/&gt; the main source of revenue for the museum comes from admission sales (approximately 75% of total revenue&lt;ref name="Then and Now"/&gt;). The Diefenbunker actively applies for private, municipal, provincial and federal grants. The museum also relies on the generous support of the community through donations and sponsorship.&lt;ref name="Then and Now"/&gt;

==Additional services==
The Diefenbunker offers additional services on top of public tours. The museum has space available to rent both for events and storage.&lt;ref name="Forces"/&gt; The decommissioned bunker has been used as a movie set on several occasions, including for ''[[The Sum of All Fears (film)|The Sum of All Fears]]''&lt;ref name="Forces"/&gt; and ''[[Rulers of Darkness]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yourottawaregion.com/article/1360467--manotick-filmmaker-revives-canadian-ufo-story|title=Manotick filmmaker revives Canadian UFO story|publisher=Your Ottawa Region|date=May 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Center for Jewish History''' is a partnership of five [[Jewish history]], scholarship, and art organizations in [[New York City]]: [[American Jewish Historical Society]], [[American Sephardi Federation]], [[Leo Baeck Institute New York]], [[Yeshiva University Museum]], and [[YIVO Institute for Jewish Research]]. Together, housed in one location, the partners have separate governing bodies and finances, but collocate resources. The partners' collections make up the biggest repository of Jewish history in the United States. The Center for Jewish History serves as a centralized place of scholarly research, events, exhibitions, and performances. Located within the Center are the Lillian Goldman Reading Room, Ackman &amp; Ziff Family Genealogy Institute and a Collection Management &amp; Conservation Wing. The Center for Jewish History is also an affiliate of the [[Smithsonian Institution]].

== History ==
[[File:Center for Jewish History NYC.jpg|thumb|left|The Center for Jewish History on 16th Street]]
In 2000, the Center was opened after six years of construction and planning with a goal of creating synergy among the five member organizations, each offering a different approach to [[Jewish]] history, scholarship and art.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-CJHOpening-2000"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blumenthal|first1=Ralph|title=A Museum Wing To Bear Witness To Jewish Life|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/26/arts/a-museum-wing-to-bear-witness-to-jewish-life.html|accessdate=31 May 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=26 October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was one of the first attempts at uniting differing views on Jewish culture&lt;ref name="NYTimes-OneRoof-1997"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shepard|first1=Richard F.|title=Archives of Jewish History, Now Under One Roof|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/28/nyregion/archives-of-jewish-history-now-under-one-roof.html|accessdate=31 May 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=28 April 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and resulted in the largest repository documenting the Jewish experience outside of Israel&lt;ref name=SmithsonianAffiliate&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.affiliations.si.edu/AffiliateDetail.Asp?AffiliateID=172|title=Affiliate Detail: Center for Jewish History|accessdate=5 April 2008|work=[[Smithsonian Affiliations]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading some to refer to it as the Jewish [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref name="JTA-JewishLibraryofCongress-2000"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wiener|first1=Julie|title=New History Center Touted As Jewish ‘library of Congress’|url=http://www.jta.org/2000/10/24/archive/new-history-center-touted-as-jewish-library-of-congress|accessdate=31 May 2015|work=[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]]|date=24 October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the late 1980s, Bruce Slovin, who was the chairman of [[YIVO]], originated the concept of unified center where the partners could share resources. The idea was triggered when he realized that the then home of [[YIVO]], a mansion located at 86th and Fifth Avenue, was not able to meet the needs of its collections or visitors, resulting in an environment that has hazardous to the collection (it was not temperature-controlled) as well as made archival study difficult. The location on [[Museum Mile, New York City|Museum Mile]] was not seen as an advantageous adjacency. Slovin saw [[YIVO]] and the partner organizations as being more academic-focused.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-OneRoof-1997" /&gt;

The [[Leo Baeck Institute]] was previously located at 129 East 73rd Street, and the [[American Jewish Historical Society]], which had previously been a New York City-based institution prior to the early 1960s, was then located near [[Brandeis University]] in [[Waltham, Massachusetts|Waltham]], [[Massachusetts]]. The [[Yeshiva University Museum]] was located in the [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] neighborhood uptown.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-OneRoof-1997" /&gt;

When it opened its doors to the public in October 2000, the Center struggled with financial problems. In 2007, there were preliminary talks about a partnership with [[NYU]]'s [[Jewish_studies#New_York_University|Skirball Department for Hebrew and Judaic Studies]] to the benefit of both organizations.&lt;ref name="Forward-NYUCourtsCJH-2007"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Siegel|first1=Jennifer|title=NYU Courts Center for Jewish History|url=http://forward.com/news/11714/nyu-courts-center-for-jewish-history-00547/|accessdate=31 May 2015|work=[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]|date=26 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, the Center and Skirball decided not to move forward. In 2010, the Center for Jewish History was able to raise $30 million to retire its construction debt.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Debt-2011"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Strom|first1=Stephanie|title=Finding Deep Pockets to Help a Jewish Center|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/01/21/finding-deep-pockets-to-help-a-jewish-center/|accessdate=31 May 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=21 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount was raised and donated by the chairman and founder of the center, Bruce Slovin; co-chairmen [[William Ackman]] and Joseph Steinberg; the Fairholme Foundation; and 19 other donors.&lt;ref name="NYJewishWeek-CampaignSuccess-2011"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Snyder|first1=Tamar|title=History Center In The Black: West 16th Street facility is paid off, thanks to $30 million campaign.|url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/new_york/history_center_black|accessdate=31 May 2015|work=[[The New York Jewish Week]]|date=25 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts meant that the Center was debt-free.&lt;ref name="JTA-Slovin-2011"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Klein|first1=Dan|title=With the Center for Jewish History debt free, its founding chairman steps down|url=http://www.jta.org/2011/05/24/life-religion/with-the-center-for-jewish-history-debt-free-its-founding-chairman-steps-down|accessdate=31 May 2015|work=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|date=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the Center received a top rating of four stars from the [[Charity Navigator]] non-profit evaluation service.&lt;ref name=CharityNavigator&gt;{{cite web|title=Center for Jewish History|url=http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=3450#.VWsSVlnBzRY|website=[[Charity Navigator]]|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Facilities ===
{{stack|float=right|[[File:CJH reading room CJH2016 jeh.jpg|thumb|right|Reading room]]}}
The Center is located in Manhattan's [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]] neighborhood, and is a four-building {{convert|125000|sqft|m2}} campus built around a courtyard that has a central entrance on 16th Street. The Center is made up of four previously existing buildings and two new buildings. The buildings are the former location of the [[American Foundation for the Blind]]/Helen Keller Institute. The cost of the complex was $4.4 million.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-OneRoof-1997" /&gt;

== Collections ==
The partners' collections include more than 100 million documents, 500,000 books, thousands of art objects, textiles, ritual objects, music, films, and photographs.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-CJHOpening-2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NewVilna-GlickmanInterview-2011"&gt;{{cite news|title=An Interview with Michael Glickman of the Center for Jewish History|url=http://www.newvilnareview.com/features/an-interview-with-michael-glickman-of-the-center-for-jewish-history.html|accessdate=31 May 2015|work=New Vilna Review|date=8 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; most of which had been poorly housed in the member institutions and were at risk of damage or destruction.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-CJHComplexPlanning-1998"&gt;{{cite news|title=On 16th and 17th Streets, between Fifth Avenue and Avenue of the Americas; New Center for Jewish History|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/15/realestate/postings-16th-17th-streets-between-fifth-avenue-avenue-americas-new-center-for.html|accessdate=31 May 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=15 February 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center is heavily involved with the preservation of records that define moments in Jewish [[immigration]] to [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="NYTimes-NYAssocNewAmericans-2008"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bernstein|first1=Nina|title=After a Fight to Survive, One to Succeed|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/09/nyregion/09jews.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=31 May 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=9 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A $670,000 grant awarded in 2007 helped with the cataloging of these materials.&lt;ref name="PRNewswire-LeonLevyAward-2007"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Center for Jewish History|title=Leon Levy Foundation Awards Additional $860,092 Grant to Center for Jewish History for Preservation of Archival Materials|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/leon-levy-foundation-awards-additional-860092-grant-to-center-for-jewish-history-for-preservation-of-archival-materials-97468679.html|accessdate=31 May 2015|work=[[PR Newswire]]|date=24 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4970">The [[Community of Christ]] '''International Peace Award''' was established to honor and bring attention to the work of [[peacemaking]] and peacemakers in the world.  It has been bestowed on an individual each year since 1993 (except 1996 and 2015). 

==Overview==

The award was instituted as part of the peace and justice ministries associated with the [[Independence Temple]], which was dedicated in 1994, the year following the inaugural award. The Community of Christ International Peace Award includes a cash gift for the benefit of the recipient's project or endeavor.

2005 recipient Craig Kielburger, founder of Free the Children, stated in his acceptance address that: "It is an honour to receive this commendation from an organization with such a long and acclaimed history as champions for international peace and justice. The Community of Christ has been a social-justice advocate since its early beginnings among the poor on the USA frontier in the 1830s. Your movement began with young people; Joseph Smith Jr. was only fourteen when he had his first vision, only twenty-four when he began your church. Today an international movement in over fifty nations, Community of Christ carries the torch forward through child advocacy, campaigns to support [[conscientious objection]] to war, and in their fight to bring recognition to the crisis in Darfur, Sudan." 

Accepting the award in 2004, Rev. James Lawson said: "You can resolve the war in your own life. You can resolve the war in your community, your congregation. You can heal the war in our nation. We can make war a relic of a dead past that need never again threaten the well-being and the security of the human race."

{{Wiktionary|cool}}

'''Coolness''' is an [[aesthetic]] of attitude, behavior, comportment, appearance and style which is generally admired. Because of the varied and changing connotations of cool, as well as its subjective nature, the word has no single meaning. It has associations of composure and self-control (cf. the [[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]] definition) and often is used as an expression of admiration or approval.  Although commonly regarded as [[slang]], it is widely used among disparate social groups and has endured in usage for generations.

==Overview==
[[File:Timeline of cool.svg|thumb|410px|A timeline of cool, adapted from Dick Pountain and David Robins, ''Cool Rules: Anatomy of an Attitude'']] There is no single concept of cool. One consistent aspect however, is that cool is widely seen as desirable.&lt;ref&gt;Warren &amp; Campbell, 'What Makes Things Cool? How Autonomy Influences Perceived Coolness.’ Article by Caleb Warren and Margaret C. Campbell; Journal of Consumer Research, Vol. 41, August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kerner, Noah and Gene Pressman (2007), 'Chasing Cool: Standing out in Today's Cluttered Marketplace,' New York: Atria&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although there is no single concept of cool, its definitions fall into a few broad categories.

=== As a behavioral characteristic ===
The sum and substance of cool is a [[self-conscious]] aplomb in overall behavior, which entails a set of specific [[behavior]]al characteristics that is firmly anchored in [[symbology]], a set of discernible [[Body language|bodily movements]], [[Human position|postures]], [[facial expression]]s and [[voice]] modulations that are acquired and take on strategic social value within the peer context.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Marcel Danesi, ''Cool - The Signs and Meanings of Adolescence'', University of Toronto Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cool was once an attitude fostered by rebels and underdogs, such as slaves, prisoners, bikers and political dissidents, etc., for whom open rebellion invited punishment, so it hid defiance behind a wall of ironic detachment, distancing itself from the source of authority rather than directly confronting it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pountain|first1=Dick|last2=Robbins|first2=David|year=2000|title=Cool Rules|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=1-86189-071-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, coolness is a positive trait based on the inference that a cultural object (e.g., a person or brand) is autonomous in an appropriate way. That is the person or brand is not constrained by the norms, expectation of beliefs of others.&lt;ref&gt;Warren &amp; Campbell, 'What Makes Things Cool? How Autonomy Influences Perceived Coolness.’ Article by Caleb Warren and Margaret C. Campbell; Journal of Consumer Research, Vol. 41, August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

=== As a state of being ===
Cool has been used to describe a general state of well-being, a transcendent, internal state of peace and serenity.&lt;ref name="Aesthetic"&gt;''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3334749 An Aesthetic of the Cool]'' Robert Farris Thompson African Arts, Vol. 7, No. 1 (Autumn, 1973), pp. 40-43+64-67+89-91&lt;/ref&gt; It can also refer to an absence of conflict, a state of harmony and balance as in, "The land is cool," or as in a "cool [spiritual] heart." Such meanings, according to Thompson, are African in origin. Cool is related in this sense to both social control and transcendental balance.&lt;ref name="Aesthetic"/&gt;

Cool can similarly be used to describe composure and absence of excitement in a person—especially in times of stress—as expressed in the [[idiom]] ''to keep your cool''.

In a related way, the word can be used to express agreement or assent, as in the phrase ''"I'm cool with that".''

=== As aesthetic appeal ===
Cool is also an attitude widely adopted by artists and intellectuals, who thereby aided its infiltration into [[popular culture]]. Sought by product marketing firms, idealized by teenagers, a shield against racial oppression or political persecution and source of constant cultural innovation, cool has become a global phenomenon that has spread to every corner of the earth.&lt;ref name="coolhunt"&gt;''Coolhunting With Aristotle Welcome to the hunt.'' by Nick Southgate, Cogent&lt;/ref&gt; Concepts of cool have existed for centuries in several cultures.&lt;ref name="Pountain"&gt;{{cite book|title=Cool Rules: Anatomy of an Attitude|last1=Pountain|first1=Dick|last2=Robins|first2=David|publisher=Reaktion Book Ltd.|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As fashion===
In terms of fashion, the concept of "cool" has transformed from the 1960s to the 1990s by becoming integrated in the dominant fabric of culture. America’s mass-production of "ready-to-wear" fashion in the 1940s and ‘50s, established specific conventional outfits as markers of ones fixed social role in society. Subcultures such as the Hippies, felt repressed by the dominating conservative ideology of the 1940s and ‘50s towards conformity and rebelled. According to Dick Pountain’s definition of "cool," Hippie's fashionable dress can be seen as "cool" because of its prominent deviation away from the standard uniformity of dress and mass-production of dress, created by the totalitarian system of fashion was seen as "cool."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pountain|first=Dick|title=Cool Rules: Anatomy of an Attitude |date=2000|publisher=Reaktion|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had various different styles that features bold colors such as the "Trippy Hippie," the "Fantasy Hippie," the "Retro Hippie," the "Ethnic Hippie," and the "Craft Hippie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitley|first=Lauren D.|title=Hippie Chic|date=2013|publisher=MFA Publications |location=Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, according to the strain theory, Hippie’s hand production of their clothing makes them "cool." By naturally hand-making their clothing they rebelled against consumerism in a passive manner because it allowed them to simply not participate in that lifestyle, which makes them "cool." As a result of their disengagement, the scope of self-critique was limited because their mask filtered negative thoughts of worthlessness, fostering the opportunity for self-worth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pountain|first=Dick|title=Cool Rules: Anatomy of an Attitude|date=2000|publisher=Reaktion|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Starting in the 1990s and continuing into the 21st century, the concept of dressing cool went out of the minority and into the mainstream culture, making dressing "cool" a dominant ideology. Cool entered the mainstream because those Hippie "rebels" of the late 1960s were now senior executives of business sectors and of the fashion industry. Since they grew up with "cool" and maintained the same values, they knew its rules and thus knew how to accurately market and produce such clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pountain|first=Dick|title=Cool Rules: Anatomy of an Attitude|date=2000|publisher=Reaktion|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, once "cool" became the dominant ideology in the 21st century its definition changed to not one of rebellion but of one attempting to hide their insecurities in a confident manner. 

The "fashion-grunge" style of the 1990s and 21st century allowed people who felt financially insecure about their lifestyle to pretend to "fit in" by wearing a unique piece of clothing, but one that was polished beautiful. For example, unlike the Hippie style that clearly diverges from the norm, through Marc Jacobs' combined "fashion-grunge" style of "a little preppie, a little grunge and a little couture," he produces not a bold statement one that is mysterious and awkward creating an ambiguous perception of what the wearer’s internal feelings are.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vogue.com/voguepedia/Marc_Jacobs|title=Marc Jacobs|publisher=Voguepedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As an epithet===
While [[slang]] terms are usually short-lived coinages and figures of speech, ''cool'' is an especially ubiquitous slang word, most notably among young people. As well as being understood throughout the English-speaking world, the word has even entered the vocabulary of several languages other than English.

In this sense, cool is used as a general positive [[epithet]] or interjection, which can have a range of related adjectival [[Meaning (linguistic)|meaning]]s.

==Regions==
One of the essential characteristics of cool is its mutability&amp;mdash;what is considered cool changes over time and varies among cultures and generations. &lt;ref name="Pountain" /&gt;

===Africa and the African diaspora===
[[File:Yoruba-bronze-head.jpg|thumb|[[Yoruba Culture|Yoruba]] bronze head sculpture from the city of [[Ife]], [[Nigeria]] c. 12th century A.D]]

Author [[Robert Farris Thompson]], professor of [[History of art|art history]] at [[Yale University]], suggests that [[Itutu]], which he translates as 'mystic coolness,'&lt;ref&gt;Flash of the Spirit, Random House 1984, {{ISBN|0-394-72369-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of three pillars of a religious philosophy created in the 15th century&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westafricaarticles.info/Article/The-Benin-Empire/221 The Benin Empire] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928080859/http://www.westafricaarticles.info/Article/The-Benin-Empire/221 |date=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] and [[Igbo people|Igbo]] civilizations of West Africa. Cool, or Itutu, contained meanings of conciliation and gentleness of character, of generosity and grace, and the ability to defuse fights and disputes. It also was associated with physical beauty. In Yoruba culture, Itutu is connected to water, because to the Yoruba the concept of coolness retained its physical connotation of temperature.&lt;ref name="art"&gt;Robert Farris Thompson, ''African Art in Motion'', New York, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; He cites a definition of cool from the [[Gola (ethnic group)|Gola]] people of [[Liberia]], who define it as the ability to be mentally calm or detached, in an other-worldly fashion, from one's circumstances, to be nonchalant in situations where emotionalism or eagerness would be natural and expected.&lt;ref name="Aesthetic" /&gt; Joseph M. Murphy writes that "cool" is also closely associated with the deity [[Oshun|Òsun]] of the [[Yoruba religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Joseph, M. and Sanford, Mei-Mei. ''Òsun Across the Waters: A Yoruba Goddess in Africa and the Americas'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although Thompson acknowledges similarities between African and European ''cool'' in shared notions of self-control and imperturbability,&lt;ref name="art" /&gt; he finds the cultural value of cool in Africa which influenced the [[African diaspora]] to be different from that held by Europeans, who use the term primarily as the ability to remain calm under stress. According to Thompson, there is significant weight, meaning and spirituality attached to cool in traditional African cultures, something which, Thompson argues, is absent from the idea in a Western context.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The telling point is that the "mask" of coolness is worn not only in time of stress, but also of pleasure, in fields of expressive performance and the dance. Struck by the re-occurrence of this vital notion elsewhere in tropical Africa and in the [[Americas|Pan-American]] [[African Diaspora]], I have come to term the attitude "an aesthetic of the cool" in the sense of a deeply and completely motivated, consciously artistic, interweaving of elements serious and pleasurable, of responsibility and play.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Robert Farris. ''African Arts''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====African Americans====
Ronald Perry writes that many words and expressions have passed from [[African-American Vernacular English]] into Standard English slang including the contemporary meaning of the word "cool."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utp.edu.co/~chumanas/revistas/revistas/rev31/african.htm African-American English]&lt;/ref&gt; The definition, as something fashionable, is said to have been popularized in jazz circles by tenor saxophonist [[Lester Young]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cool Cool - Online Etymology Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; This predominantly [[Black people|black]] jazz scene in the U.S. and among expatriate musicians in [[Paris]] helped popularize notions of cool in the U.S. in the 1940s, giving birth to "Bohemian", or [[beatnik]], culture.&lt;ref name="coolhunt"/&gt; Shortly thereafter, a style of jazz called [[cool jazz]] appeared on the music scene, emphasizing a restrained, laid-back solo style.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/index/n2575213m0lx0618.pdf Music of the African Diaspora in the Americas]&lt;/ref&gt; Notions of cool as an expression of centeredness in a [[Tao]]ist sense, equilibrium and self-possession, of an absence of conflict are commonly understood in both African and African-American contexts well. Expressions such as, "Don't let it blow your cool," later, ''chill out'', and the use of ''chill'' as a characterization of inner contentment or restful repose all have their origins in African-American Vernacular English.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Lee, "Out of the Hood and into the News: Borrowed Black Verbal Expressions in a Mainstream Newspaper" (conference paper, University of Georgia, October 1998); cited in Rickford and Rickford, ''Spoken Soul,'' 98.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt; When the air in the smoke-filled nightclubs of that era became unbreathable, windows and doors were opened to allow some "cool air" in from the outside to help clear away the suffocating air. By analogy, the slow and smooth jazz style that was typical for that late-night scene came to be called "cool".&lt;ref&gt;Marcel Danesi, ''Cool - The Signs and Meanings of Adolescence'', University of Toronto Press, 1994, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The purpose of the cool [[jazz]] as Giogia stated, "The goal was always the same: to lower the temperature of the music and bring out different qualities in jazz." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.jazz.com |title=A History of Cool Jazz in 100 Tracks |accessdate=23 October 2015 |website=jazz |publisher=jazz |last=Gioia |first=Ted |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151021131326/http://www.jazz.com/ |archivedate=21 October 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marlene Kim Connor connects cool and the post-war African-American experience in her book ''What is Cool?: Understanding Black Manhood in America''. Connor writes that cool is the silent and knowing rejection of racist oppression, a self-dignified expression of masculinity developed by black men denied mainstream expressions of manhood. She writes that mainstream perception of cool is narrow and distorted, with cool often perceived merely as style or arrogance, rather than a way to achieve respect.&lt;ref&gt;''Conner, Marlene Kim (1995).

Among black men in America, coolness, which may have its roots in slavery as an ironic submission and concealed subversion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://philosophynow.org/issues/80/What_Does_It_Mean_To_Be_Cool |title=What Does it Mean to Be Cool? |last=Botz-Bornstein|first=Thorsten  |date=2010 |access-date=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; at times is enacted in order to create a powerful appearance, a type of performance frequently maintained for the sake of a social audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Majors |first1=Richard |date=1992 |title=

=====Cool pose=====

'Cool', though an amorphous quality—more mystique than material—is a pervasive element in urban black male culture.&lt;ref name="Cool Politics" /&gt; Majors and Billson address what they term "cool pose" in their study and argue that it helps black men counter stress caused by social oppression, rejection and [[racism]]. They also contend that it furnishes the black male with a sense of control, strength, confidence and stability and helps him deal with the closed doors and negative messages of the "generalized other." They also believe that attaining black manhood is filled with pitfalls of discrimination, negative self-image, guilt, shame and fear.&lt;ref&gt;Boddie, Jacquelyn Lynette. ''[http://www.uwp.edu/academic/criminal.justice/aframsch1to3.pdf "Exploring the turn-around Phenomenon Experienced by African American Urban Male Adolescents in High School]''." Retrieved on 02-26-2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Cool pose" may be a factor in discrimination in education contributing to the [[racial achievement gap in the United States|achievement gaps in test scores]]. In a 2004 study, researchers found that teachers perceived students with African-American culture-related movement styles, referred to as the "cool pose," as lower in achievement, higher in aggression, and more likely to need [[Special education in the United States|special education]] services than students with standard movement styles, irrespective of race or other academic indicators.&lt;ref&gt;''The Effects of African American Movement Styles on Teachers' Perceptions and Reactions'' Journal article by Scott T. Bridgest, Audrey Davis Mccray, La Vonne I. Neal, Gwendolyn Webb-Johnson; ''Journal of Special Education'', Vol. 37, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of stereotyping and discrimination with respect to "cool pose" raises complex questions of [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] and accommodation of different cultural values. Jason W. Osborne identifies "cool pose" as one of the factors in black underachievement.&lt;ref&gt;Jason W. Osborne, "Unraveling Underachievement among African American Boys from an Identification with Academics Perspective", ''The Journal of Negro Education'', Vol. 68, No. 4 (Autumn 1999), pp. 555-565. {{doi|10.2307/2668154}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robin D. G. Kelley]] criticizes calls for assimilation and sublimation of black culture, including "cool pose." He argues that media and academics have unfairly demonized these aspects of black culture while, at the same time, through their sustained fascination with blacks as exotic others, appropriated aspects of "cool pose" into the broader popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;Robin D. G. Kelley, ''Yo' Mama's Disfunktional!: Fighting the Culture Wars in Urban America''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Elliott Clarke]] writes that [[Malcolm X]], like [[Miles Davis]], embodies essential elements of cool. As an icon, Malcolm X inspires a complex mixture of both fear and fascination in broader American culture, much like "cool pose" itself.&lt;ref name="Cool Politics"/&gt;

===East Asia===
{{main|Cool Japan}}
In Japan, synonyms of "cool" could be [[iki (aesthetic ideal)|iki]] and sui. These are traditional commoners' aesthetic ideals that developed in Edo. Some tend to immediately connect the aesthetics of Japan to samurai, but this is historically inaccurate. In fact, samurais from the countryside have often been the target of ridicule by the commoner in the civilized Edo in many art forms including [[rakugo]], a form of comical storytelling.

Some argue that the ethic of the [[Samurai]] caste in [[Japan]], warrior castes in India and East Asia all resemble cool.&lt;ref name="Pountain"/&gt; The samurai-themed works of film director [[Akira Kurosawa]] are among the most praised of the genre, influencing many filmmakers across the world with his techniques and storytelling. Notable works of his include ''[[The Seven Samurai]]'', ''[[Yojimbo (movie)|Yojimbo]]'', and ''[[The Hidden Fortress]]''. The latter was one of the primary inspirations for [[George Lucas]]'s ''[[Star Wars]]'', which also borrows a number of aspects from the samurai, for example the [[Jedi|Jedi Knights]] of the series. Samurai have been presented as cool in many modern Japanese movies such as ''[[Samurai Fiction]]'', ''[[Kagemusha]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olivefilms.com/Samurai_Classics.21/Criterion_Collection.6/kagemushadvd.1206.html |title=Kagemusha|publisher=Olive Films|accessdate=2008-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Yojimbo'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apolloguide.com/mov_fullrev.asp?CID=1511 |title=Apollo Movie Guide's Review of Yojimbo |publisher=Apolloguide.com |accessdate=2008-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was appropriated in American movies such as ''[[Ghost Dog]]''&lt;ref&gt;Way cool way of the samurai, Bruce Kirkland, [http://jam.canoe.ca/Movies/Reviews/G/Ghost_Dog/2000/03/10/752999.html Canoe.ca]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Last Samurai]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kfccinema.com/reviews/swordplay/lastsamurai/lastsamurai.html The Last Samurai Review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070119170705/http://www.kfccinema.com/reviews/swordplay/lastsamurai/lastsamurai.html |date=2007-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[The Art of War]], a Chinese military treatise written during the 6th century BC, general [[Sun Tzu]], a member of the landless Chinese aristocracy, wrote in Chapter XII:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Profiting by their panic, we shall exterminate them completely; this will cool the King's courage and cover us with glory, besides ensuring the success of our mission.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Shibuya tokyo.jpg|thumb|Prof. [[Paul Waley]] considers Tokyo one of the world's "capitals of cool."]]
Asian countries have developed a tradition on their own to explore types of modern 'cool' or 'ambiguous' [[aesthetics]].

In a ''[[Time Asia]]'' article "The Birth of Cool" author [[Hannah Beech]] describes Asian cool as "a revolution in taste led by style gurus who are redefining Chinese craftsmanship in everything from architecture and film to clothing and cuisine" and as a modern aesthetic inspired both by a Ming-era minimalism and a strenuous attention to detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Beech |first=Hannah |url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/features/china_cul_rev/trendintro.html |title=TIME Asia: China's Next Cultural Revolution &amp;#124; The Birth of Cool |publisher=Time.com |date= 2002-11-11|accessdate=2008-11-27|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224180436/http://www.time.com/time/asia/features/china_cul_rev/trendintro.html|archivedate=2007-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Waley]], professor of Human Geography at the University of Leeds, considers [[Tokyo]] along with New York, London and Paris to be one of the world's "capitals of cool"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glocom.org/books_and_journals/journal_abstracts/20070122_ja_s265/index.html |title=GLOCOM Platform - Books &amp; Journals - Journal Abstracts |publisher=Glocom.org |date= |accessdate=2008-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Washington Post]]'' called Tokyo "Japan's Empire of Cool" and Japan "the coolest nation on Earth".
&lt;blockquote&gt;Analysts are marveling at the breadth of a recent explosion in cultural exports, and many argue that the international embrace of Japan's pop culture, film, food, style and arts is second only to that of the United States. Business leaders and government officials are now referring to Japan's "gross national cool" as a new engine for economic growth and societal buoyancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A33261-2003Dec26 |title= Japan's Empire of Cool |date= 2003-12-27|accessdate=2008-11-27 | work=The Washington Post | first=Anthony | last=Faiola}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term "gross national cool" was coined by Journalist Douglas McGray. In a June/July 2002 article in ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japansociety.org/web_docs/grossnationalcool.pdf Japan Society] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003154021/http://www.japansociety.org/web_docs/grossnationalcool.pdf |date=October 3, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he argued that as Japan's economic juggernaut took a wrong turn into a 10-year slump, and with military power made impossible by a pacifist constitution, the nation had quietly emerged as a cultural powerhouse: "From pop music to consumer electronics, architecture to fashion, and food to art, Japan has far greater cultural influence now than it did in the 1980s, when it was an economic superpower."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metropolis.co.jp/tokyo/519/feature.asp |title=Metropolis Tokyo Feature - Pop star |publisher=Metropolis.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2008-11-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610124048/http://metropolis.co.jp/tokyo/519/feature.asp |archivedate=2008-06-10 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of Asian 'cool' applied to Asian [[consumer electronics]] is borrowed from the cultural media theorist [[Eric McLuhan]] who described 'cool' or 'cold' media as stimulating participants to complete auditive or visual media content, in sharp contrast to 'hot' media that degrades the viewer to a merely passive or non-interactive receiver.

===Europe===

====Aristocratic and artistic cool====
[[File:Mona Lisa, by Leonardo da Vinci, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|thumb|[[Mona Lisa]], or La Gioconda (La Joconde), by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] expresses [[sprezzatura]], an "aristocratic cool".&lt;ref name=high&gt;[http://www.high.org/uploadedFiles/overview/newsroom/LouvreAtlantaReleaseFINAL(2).pdf The High Museum Campaign reaches $130 Million Goal]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060930220032/http://www.high.org/uploadedFiles/overview/newsroom/LouvreAtlantaReleaseFINAL%282%29.pdf |date=September 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

"Aristocratic cool", known as [[sprezzatura]], has existed in Europe for centuries, particularly when relating to frank amorality and love or illicit pleasures behind closed doors;&lt;ref name=Pountain/&gt; Raphael's "Portrait of [[Baldassare Castiglione]]" and Leonardo da Vinci's "Mona Lisa" are classic examples of ''sprezzatura''.&lt;ref name=high/&gt; The ''sprezzatura'' of the Mona Lisa is seen in both her smile and the positioning of her hands. Both the smile and hands are intended to convey her grandeur, self-confidence and societal position.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/catdir/samples/har051/2001024956.html Sample text for Becoming Mona Lisa : the making of a global icon / Donald Sassoon.]&lt;/ref&gt; Sprezzatura means, literally, disdain and detachment. It is the art of refraining from the appearance of trying to present oneself in a particular way. In reality, of course, tremendous exertion went into pretending not to bother or care.

English poet and playwright [[William Shakespeare]] used cool in several of his works to describe composure and absence of emotion.&lt;ref name=Pountain/&gt; In ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', written sometime in the late-16th century, he contrasts the shaping fantasies of lovers and madmen with "cool reason,"&lt;ref&gt;William Shakespeare, ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'', Act V, Scene 1.&lt;/ref&gt; in ''[[Hamlet]]'' he wrote "O gentle son, upon the heat and flame of thy distemper, sprinkle cool patience,"&lt;ref&gt;William Shakespeare, ''The Tragedy of Hamlet Prince of Denmark'', The Harvard Classics, 1909–14. Act III Scene IV&lt;/ref&gt; and the antagonist Iago in ''[[Othello]]'' is musing about "reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal stings, our unbitted lusts."&lt;ref name=Pountain/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Shakespeare, ''Othello'', Act 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The cool "Anatolian smile" of [[Turkey]] is used to mask emotions. A similar "mask" of coolness is worn in both times of stress and pleasure in American and African communities.&lt;ref name=Pountain/&gt;

====European inter-war cool====
The key themes of modern European cool were forged by avant-garde artists who achieved prominence in the aftermath of the First World War, most notably [[Dada]]ists, such as key Dada figures [[Arthur Cravan]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]], and the left-wing milieu of the [[Weimar Republic]]. The program of such groups was often self-consciously revolutionary, a determination to scandalize the bourgeoisie by mocking their culture, sexuality and political moderation.&lt;ref name=Pountain/&gt;

[[Berthold Brecht]], both a committed Communist and a philandering cynic, stands as the archetype of this inter-war cool. Brecht projected his cool attitude to life onto his most famous character Macheath or "Mackie Messer" (Mack the knife), in [[The Threepenny Opera]]. Mackie, the nonchalant, smooth-talking gangster, expert with the switchblade, personifies the bitter-sweet strain of cool; Puritanism and sentimentality are both anathema to the cool character.&lt;ref name=Pountain/&gt;

During the turbulent inter-war years, cool was a privilege reserved for bohemian milieus like Brecht's. Cool irony and hedonism remained the province of cabaret artistes, ostentatious gangsters and rich socialites, those decadents depicted in [[Evelyn Waugh]]'s [[Brideshead Revisited]] and [[Christopher Isherwood]]'s [[Goodbye to Berlin]], tracing the outlines of a new cool. [[Peter Stearns]], professor of history at [[George Mason University]], suggests that in effect the seeds of a cool outlook had been sown among this inter-war generation.&lt;ref&gt;Peter N. Stearns, ''American Cool: Constructing a Twentieth-Century Emotional Style'' (History of Emotion), New York University Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Post-World War II cool====
The Second World War brought the populations of Britain, Germany and France into intimate contact with Americans and American culture. The war brought hundreds of thousands of GIs whose relaxed, easy-going manner was seen by young people of the time as the very embodiment of liberation; and with them came Lucky Strikes, nylons, swing and jazz—the American Cool.

To be cool or hip meant hanging out, pursuing sexual liaisons, displaying the appropriate attitude of narcissistic self-absorption, and expressing a desire to escape the mental straitjacket of all ideological causes. From the late 1940s onward, this popular culture influenced young people all over the world, to the great dismay of the paternalistic elites who still ruled the official culture. The French intelligentsia were outraged, while the British educated classes displayed a haughty indifference that smacked of an older aristocratic cool.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Gold, Bohemia: Digging the Roots of Cool, Touchstone Books; Reprint edition 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Polish cool====
The new attitude found a special resonance behind the Iron Curtain, where it offered relief from the earnestness of socialist propaganda and socialist realism in art. In the Polish industrial city [[Łódź]], jazz, "the forbidden music", served Polish youth of the 1950s much as it had served its African-American creators, both as personal diversion and subterranean resistance to what they saw as a stultifying official culture. Some clubs featured live jazz performances, and their smoky, sexually charged atmosphere carried a message for which the puritanical values and monumental art of Marxist officialdom were an ideal foil.&lt;ref&gt;James P. Sloan, ''Jerzy Kosinski: A Biography'', Diane Pub. Co., 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Arriving in Poland via France, America and England, Polish cool stimulated the film talents of a generation of artists, including [[Andrzej Wajda]], [[Roman Polanski]], and other graduates of the [[National Film School in Łódź]], as well as the novelist [[Jerzy Kosinski]], in whose clinical prose cool tends towards the sadistic.&lt;ref name=Pountain/&gt;

====Czech cool====
In [[Prague]], the capital of Bohemia, cool flourished in the faded [[Art Deco]] splendor of the [[Cafe Slavia]]. Significantly, following the crushing of the [[Prague Spring]] by Soviet tanks in 1968, part of the dissident underground called itself the "Jazz Section".&lt;ref name=Pountain/&gt;

==Theories==
&lt;!--
===As an African-American aesthetic===
This is a very common viewpoint. 
{{Expand section|date=May 2012}}

===Robert Farris Thompson's ''African Art in Motion''===
{{Expand section|date=May 2012}}
--&gt;

===As a positive trait===
According to this theory, coolness is a subjective, dynamic, socially-constructed trait, such that coolness is in the eye of the beholder. People perceive things (e.g., other people, products or brands) to be cool based on an inference of “autonomy”. That is, something is perceived to be cool when it follows its own motivations. However, this theory proposes that the level of autonomy that leads to coolness is constrained - inappropriate levels of autonomy, such that the autonomy is too high or opposes a legitimate norm, do not lead to perceptions of coolness. The level of autonomy considered appropriate is influenced by individual difference variables. For example, people who think of societal institutions and authority as unjust or repressive perceive coolness at higher levels of autonomy than those who are less critical of social norms and authority.&lt;ref&gt;Warren &amp; Campbell, 'What Makes Things Cool? How Autonomy Influences Perceived Coolness.’ Article by Caleb Warren and Margaret C. Campbell; Journal of Consumer Research, Vol. 41, August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===As social distinction===
According to this theory, ''coolness'' is a relative concept.  In other words, ''cool'' exists only in comparison with things considered less ''cool''; for example, in the book ''[[The Rebel Sell]]'', ''cool'' is created out of a need for status and distinction. This creates a situation analogous to an [[arms race]], in which ''cool'' is perpetuated by a [[collective action]] problem in society.&lt;ref name="rebel"&gt;Heath, Joseph and Potter, Andrew. ''[[The Rebel Sell]]''. Harper Perennial, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===As an elusive essence===
According to this theory, cool is a real, but unknowable property. ''Cool'', like "Good", is a property that exists, but can only be sought after. In the ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' article, "The Coolhunt",&lt;ref&gt;''[http://gladwell.com/the-coolhunt/ The Coolhunt]''&lt;/ref&gt; cool is given three characteristics:
* "The act of discovering what's cool is what causes cool to move on"
* "Cool cannot be manufactured, only observed"
* "[Cool] can only be observed by those who are themselves cool".

===As a marketing device===
{{rquote|right|[Cool is] a heavily manipulative corporate ethos.|[[Kalle Lasn]]}}
{{See also|Planned obsolescence|Cultural appropriation|CoolBrands (branding initiative)}}
{{rquote|right|Over the past decade, young black men in American inner cities have been the market most aggressively mined by brandmasters as a source of borrowed 'meaning' and identity...The truth is that the 'got to be cool' rhetoric of the global brands is, more often than not, an indirect way of saying 'got to be black.'|Designer [[Christian Lacroix]]&lt;ref name="Klein 2000 pg. 73-4"/&gt;}}

According to this theory, ''cool'' can be exploited as a manufactured and empty idea imposed on the culture at large through a top-down process by the "Merchants of Cool"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/cool/etc/synopsis.html|title=Synopsis {{!}} Merchants Of Cool {{!}} FRONTLINE {{!}} PBS|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The "Merchants of Cool" are sellers of popular culture who capitalize off of trends and subcultures, most often created by youths. Some modern examples of the "Merchants of Cool" are record company executives, sneaker and fashion company branders and merchandisers. Furthermore, "cool has become the central ideology of [[consumer capitalism]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@wodenworks/what-s-in-a-word-telling-your-story-with-the-right-voice-e0d8caf80f50|title=What’s in a Word? Telling Your Story with the Right Voice|last=woden|date=2016-01-25|website=Medium|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the selling of cool thus drives young people and adults attempting to "fit in" to the mainstream and adhere to trends to purchase products and/or brands that make them appear cool.

The concept of cool was used in this way to market [[Menthol cigarette|menthol cigarettes]] to African Americans in the 1960s. In 2004 over 70% of African American smokers preferred menthol cigarettes, compared with 30% of white smokers. This unique social phenomenon was principally occasioned by the tobacco industry's manipulation of the burgeoning black, urban, segregated, consumer market in cities at that time. According to [[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] some large companies have started '[[outsourcing]] cool.' They are paying other "smaller, more-limber, closer-to-the-ground outsider" companies to help them keep up with customers' rapidly changing tastes and demands. 

&lt;!--
===As an opinion===
Quite often, cool is in the eye of the beholder. One person, usually a member of a certain social demographic, could consider something to be ''cool'' whereas a member of a separate social demographic could consider completely the opposite to be worthy of the label. Trends are usually considered ''cool'' when only a small minority is involved in them. More people becoming interested in this trend pushes it towards the mainstream, therefore classifying it as ''uncool''. Something else will then emerge as a new trend, and the cycle will repeat indefinitely.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The presiding officers of such Courts get appointed by the [[High Court]].

The High court appoints Chief Metropolitan Magistrate for every metropolitan court. The High court may also appoint Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate for an area, with all or any of the powers of a Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, as may be directed by the High Court. Other than Chief Metropolitan Magistrate and Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, there are also Metropolitan Magistrates also known as Magistrate of the first class who work as subordinates of Chief Metropolitan Magistrate. Any two or more metropolitan magistrates may, subject to the rules made by the CMM, sit together as a bench. All metropolitan magistrates including the ACMMs and benches of general magistrates are subordinate to the CMM.

'''Decossackization''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Расказачивание, ''Raskazachivaniye'') was the [[Bolshevik]] policy of systematic repressions against [[Cossacks]] of the Russian Empire, especially of the [[Don Cossacks|Don]] and the [[Kuban Cossacks|Kuban]], between 1917 and 1933 aimed at the elimination of the Cossacks as a separate ethnic, political, and economic entity.&lt;ref name ="Black 98"&gt;Nicolas Werth, Karel Bartošek, Jean-Louis Panné, Jean-Louis Margolin, Andrzej Paczkowski, [[Stéphane Courtois]].

==Background==
Cossacks were simultaneously both an [[ethnicity]] and special [[social estates in the Russian Empire]] from the 16th to the early 20th century. Because of their military tradition, Cossack forces played an important role in Russia's wars of the 17th–20th centuries such as the [[Crimean War]], [[Napoleonic Wars]], various Russo-Turkish Wars, and the [[First World War]]. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the tsarist regime employed Cossack detachments to perform police service and suppress the revolutionary movement, especially in 1905–07.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20050509071059/http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/008/057/598.htm ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Communist Revolution, a conflict broke out between the new [[Communist]] regime in Russia and the Cossacks. In the Don territory, Ataman Kaledin declared that he would "offer full support, in close alliance with the governments of the other Cossack hosts" to Kerensky's forces. Establishing ties with the Ukrainian Central Rada and the Kuban, Terek, and Orenburg hosts, Kaledin sought to overthrow Soviet regime in Russia. On 15 November 1917 Generals Kornilov, Alekseev and Denikin began to organize the Volunteer Army in Novocherkassk. Imposing martial law, Kaledin moved in late November. On December 15, after a seven-day battle, they occupied Rostov. However, on February 25, Bolshevik troops occupied Rostov and Novocherkassk. The remnants of the White Cossacks, headed by Ataman Popov, fled into the Salsk steppes.&lt;ref name="CultInfo.RU"&gt;[https://archive.is/20050118211700/http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/008/057/821.htm ]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the German forces invaded and occupied Rostov on May 8, a government headed by Ataman Krasnov was formed in the Don province. In July 1918, the White Cossack forces of Ataman Krasnov launched their first invasion of Tsaritsyn. Soviet forces counterattacked and drove out the White Cossacks by September 7. On September 22, Krasnov's forces launched a second invasion of Tsaritsyn but by October 25, Krasnov's forces were thrown back beyond the Don by Soviet troops. On January 1, 1919, Krasnov launched a third invasion of Tsaritsyn. Soviet forces repelled the invasion and forced Krasnov's forces to withdraw from Tsaritsyn in mid-February 1919.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20050510091407/http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/008/120/252.htm ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The policy was established by a secret resolution of the Bolshevik Party on January 24, 1919, which ordered local branches to "carry out [[State terrorism|mass terror]] against wealthy Cossacks, [[genocide|exterminating]] all of them; carry out merciless mass terror against any and all Cossacks taking part in any way, directly or indirectly, in the struggle against Soviet power".&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev]]. ''A Century of Violence in Soviet Russia.'' [[Yale University Press]], 2002. {{ISBN|0-300-08760-8}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20170422052232/https://books.google.com/books?id=ChRk43tVxTwC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;dq=carry+out+merciless+mass+terror&amp;ei=XoB5Sq-HAqCGygTm5PG7DA#v=onepage&amp;q=carry%20out%20merciless%20mass%20terror&amp;f=false p. 100]&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 February the Southern Front issued its own instructions on how the resolution was to be applied: "The main duty of stanitsa and [[khutor]] executive committees is to neutralize the Cossackry through the merciless extirpation of its elite. District and Stanitsa [[ataman]]s are subject to unconditional elimination, [but] khutor atamans should be subject to execution only in those cases where it can be proved that they actively supported Krasnov's policies (having organized pacification, conducted mobilization, refused to offer refuge to revolutionary Cossacks or to Red Army men)."&lt;ref name="mass terror"/&gt; 

In mid-March 1919 alone, [[Cheka]] forces executed more than 8,000 [[Cossacks]]. In each ''[[stanitsa]],'' summary judgements were passed by revolutionary courts within minutes, and whole lists of people were condemned to execution for "[[counterrevolutionary]] behavior."&lt;ref name = "Black 99-100"&gt;Nicolas Werth, Karel Bartošek, Jean-Louis Panné, Jean-Louis Margolin, Andrzej Paczkowski, [[Stéphane Courtois]]. ''[[The Black Book of Communism]]: Crimes, Terror, Repression''. [[Harvard University Press]], 1999. {{ISBN|0-674-07608-7}} p 99-100&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Don region was required by the Soviets to make a grain contribution equal to the total annual production of the area.&lt;ref name=Black&gt;Nicolas Werth, Karel Bartošek, Jean-Louis Panné, Jean-Louis Margolin, Andrzej Paczkowski, [[Stéphane Courtois]]. ''[[The Black Book of Communism]]: Crimes, Terror, Repression''. [[Harvard University Press]], 1999. {{ISBN|0-674-07608-7}} p 99-100&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all Cossacks joined the [[Green armies|Green Army]] or other rebel forces. Together with [[Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel|Baron Wrangel's]] troops, they forced the Red Army out of the region in August 1920. After the retaking of the [[Crimea]] by [[Red Army]], the Cossacks again became victims of the [[Red Terror]]. [[NKVD troika|Special commissions]] in charge of decossackization condemned more than 6,000 people to death in October 1920 alone.&lt;ref name="Black 100"&gt;Nicolas Werth, Karel Bartošek, Jean-Louis Panné, Jean-Louis Margolin, Andrzej Paczkowski, [[Stéphane Courtois]]. ''[[The Black Book of Communism]]: Crimes, Terror, Repression''. [[Harvard University Press]], 1999. {{ISBN|0-674-07608-7}} p 100&lt;/ref&gt; The families and often the neighbors of suspected rebels were taken as hostages and sent to [[concentration camps]]. According to [[Martin Latsis]] who led the Ukrainian [[Cheka]]: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Gathered together in a camp near [[Maikop]], the [[hostage]]s, women, children and old men survive in the most appalling conditions, in the cold and the mud of October... They are dying like flies. The women will do anything to escape death. The soldiers guarding the camp take advantage of this and treat them as prostitutes."&lt;ref name="Black 99-100"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In November 1920 [[Feliks Dzerzhinsky]], head of the [[Cheka]], reported to [[Lenin]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
the republic has to organize the [[internment]] in camps of about 100,000 prisoners from the Southern front and vast masses of people expelled from the rebellious [Cossack] settlements of the Terek, the Kuban, and the Don. Today 403 Cossack men and women aged between 14 and 17 arrived in [[Oryol]] for internment in concentration camp. They cannot be accepted as Oryol is already overloaded.&lt;ref name="Volkogonov"&gt;[[Dmitri Volkogonov]]. ''Autopsy of an Empire: The Seven Leaders Who Built the Soviet Regime.'' Free Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-684-87112-2}} p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Pyatigorsk]] [[Cheka]] organized a "day of [[Red Terror]]" to execute 300 people in one day. They ordered local Communist Party organizations to draw up execution lists. According to one of the [[Chekism|chekists]], "this rather unsatisfactory method led to a great deal of private settling of old scores. ... In [[Kislovodsk]], for lack of a better idea, it was decided to kill people who were in the hospital." Many Cossack towns were burned to the ground, and all survivors deported on the orders by [[Sergo Ordzhonikidze]] who was head of the Revolutionary Committee of the [[Northern Caucasus]].&lt;ref name="Gellately"&gt;[[Robert Gellately]].

==Commentary==
University of York Russian specialist Shane O'Rourke states that "ten thousand Cossacks were slaughtered systematically in a few weeks in January 1919" and that this "was one of the main factors which led to the disappearance of the Cossacks as a nation".&lt;ref name="Extermination order"/&gt; The late [[Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev]], head of the Presidential Committee for the Rehabilitation of Victims of Political Repression, notes that "hundreds of thousands of Cossacks were killed".&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev]]. ''A Century of Violence in Soviet Russia.'' [[Yale University Press]], 2002. {{ISBN|0-300-08760-8}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=ChRk43tVxTwC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;dq=Hundreds+of+thousands+of+Cossacks+were+killed&amp;lr=&amp;ei=GoN5SuenNpP4NYXshIMN#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false p. 102] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141119143859/https://books.google.com/books?id=ChRk43tVxTwC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;dq=Hundreds+of+thousands+of+Cossacks+were+killed&amp;lr=&amp;ei=GoN5SuenNpP4NYXshIMN#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |date=November 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Robert Gellately]] claims that "the most reliable estimates indicate that between 300,000 and 500,000 were killed or deported in 1919–20" out of a population of around three million.&lt;ref name="Gellately"/&gt;

Peter Holquist states the overall number of executions is difficult to establish. In some regions hundreds were executed. In Khoper, the tribunal was very active, with a one-month total of 226 executions. The Tsymlianskaia tribunal oversaw the execution of over 700 people. The Kotel'nikovo tribunal executed 117 in early May and nearly 1,000 overall. Others were not quite as active. The Berezovskaia tribunal made a total of twenty arrests in a community of 13,500 people. Holquist also notes that some of White reports of Red atrocities in the Don were consciously scripted for agitation purposes.&lt;ref name=Holquist&gt;Holquist, Peter, "A Russian Vendee: The Practice of Revolutionary Politics in the Don Countryside, 1917–1921." Ph.D. dissertation, Columbia University, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; In one example, an insurgent leader reported that 140 were executed in Bokovskaia, but later provided a different account, according to which only eight people in Bokovskaia were sentenced to death, and the authorities did not manage to carry these sentences out. This same historian emphasises he is "not seeking to downplay or dismiss very real executions by the Soviets".&lt;ref name="mass terror"/&gt;

Research by [[Pavel Polian]] from [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] on the subject of [[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|forced migrations]] in Russia shows that more than 45,000 Cossacks were deported from the [[Terek Oblast|Terek]] province to Ukraine. Their land was distributed among pro-soviet Cossacks and Chechens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Pavel Polian]]|title=[[Against Their Will (book)|Against Their Will]]: The History and Geography of Forced Migrations in the USSR|publisher=[[Central European University Press]], 2004|isbn=978-963-9241-68-8|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8ktrYux1gTMC&amp;pg=PT1&amp;dq=pavel+polian#v=snippet&amp;q=cossacks&amp;f=false 60]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Democratic Freedom Caucus''' ('''DFC''') is a freedom-oriented political action organization within the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party of the United States]] that supports basic principles of the party, but does not necessarily share identical viewpoints across the [[political spectrum]]; that is, its members are more likely to support individual and personal freedoms and address the basic causes of economic problems instead of just treating the symptoms. Founded in 1996 by Hanno Beck, [[Mike O'Mara (politician)|Mike O'Mara]] and former libertarian Andrew Spark,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democraticfreedomcaucus.org/|title=DemocraticFreedomCaucus.org|publisher=Democratic Freedom Caucus|accessdate=November 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Capozzi"&gt;{{cite news|title=Another approach: The Democratic Freedom Caucus|url=http://www.freeliberal.com/archives/001005.php|work=FreeLiberal.com|publisher=The Free Liberal|location=Woodbridge, Virginia|date=April 14, 2005|accessdate=November 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the caucus maintains a platform, a list of principles, a guide for activists and includes 40 state chairs and regional representatives.&lt;ref name="DFCPlatform"&gt;{{cite news|title=DFC platform|url=http://www.democraticfreedomcaucus.org/dfc-platform|work=DemocraticFreedomCaucus.org|publisher=Democratic Freedom Caucus|location=Somerville, Massachusetts|accessdate=November 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DFCPrinciples"&gt;{{cite news|title=Principles of the DFC|url=http://www.democraticfreedomcaucus.org/principles-of-the-dfc|work=DemocraticFreedomCaucus.org|publisher=Democratic Freedom Caucus|location=Somerville, Massachusetts|accessdate=November 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DFCActivists"&gt;{{cite news|title=Guide for activists|url=http://www.democraticfreedomcaucus.org/guide-for-activists|work=DemocraticFreedomCaucus.org|publisher=Democratic Freedom Caucus|location=Somerville, Massachusetts|accessdate=November 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DFCStateChairs"&gt;{{cite news|title=DFC state chairs and regional representatives|url=http://www.democraticfreedomcaucus.org/dfc-state-chairs|work=DemocraticFreedomCaucus.org|publisher=Democratic Freedom Caucus|location=Somerville, Massachusetts|accessdate=November 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issues ==
The DFC's positions have some important differences from the [[Republican Liberty Caucus]] (RLC) and [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] (LP)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democraticfreedomcaucus.org/dfc-platform/ "DFC Platform"].&lt;/ref&gt; because the DFC's economic views are in the tradition of [[John Locke]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Albert Jay Nock]] and various modern economists who point out how land and natural resources act very differently in the economy than labor and products of human effort.

=== Geolibertarianism ===
One significant difference from the RLC and LP is the DFC's promotion of [[Geolibertarianism|geolibertarian]] ideas within the Democratic Party because of their position in favor of tax reform that shifts taxes off of labor and production and over to spatial locations of land and the natural resources in land.&lt;ref name="Geolibertarian"&gt;{{cite news|title=Links to other geolibertarian organizations|url=http://geolib.pair.com/util/links.html|work=Geolib.pair.com|publisher=Dan Sullivan|accessdate=November 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DFCPlatform"/&gt;

=== Environment ===
Unlike other major libertarian organizations, the DFC favors strong environmental laws on the basis that the air and water are natural resources which no person produced and which everyone must use. The DFC also favors repeal of the [[Price–Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act|Price–Anderson Act]], which limits liability for nuclear power plant accidents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democraticfreedomcaucus.org/dfc-platform/ "DFC Platform"]. "Environmental Protection. There should be strong laws against polluting the air or water that others must use. In addition, we should remove government obstacles that prevent individuals from suing companies for polluting. For example, we should repeal the Price-Anderson Act, which severely restricts the right of victims of nuclear accidents to sue the owners of nuclear plants. In addition, we should remove laws that require victims to first spend time asking government administrative bureaucracies to look into a situation, rather than letting the victims immediately pursue a court action against a company. The government also should not subsidize developers".&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Workplace safety ===
The DFC also favors laws on workplace safety and believes it is fraudulent to misrepresent workplace hazards or mislead employees as to the dangers they may face.{{cn|date=July 2015}}

=== Consumer safety ===
Similarly, the DFC believes it fraudulent to misrepresent the safety or effectiveness of items or services being offered to the general public.{{cn|date=July 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11160">'''Dubai Debates''' is an online video [[debate|debating]] forum based in [[Dubai]], [[United Arab Emirates]]. According to its website, Dubai Debates offers "a platform for online [[Opinion leadership|opinion leaders]], pundits, academics, journalists, politicians, activists and all interested users to exchange ideas through videos." In addition to video debating via its website, regular debates are also held in Dubai, bringing together opinion leaders for panel discussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dubaidebates.com/pages/about |title=About |publisher=DubaiDebates.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The series was launched in early February 2011, in the midst of the [[2011 Egyptian revolution|Egyptian revolution]]. According to [[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National newspaper]], the founder of Dubai Debates, [[Belabbes Benkredda]], "drew inspiration from how opinions were circulated on Twitter and Facebook during the Tunisian and Egyptian uprisings." Dubai Debates was conceived as a contribution to the global discourse in social media, adding a video element and putting a face to the people shaping that discourse. And

A conflicting report in the New York Times states that Dubai Debates was conceived as a reaction to a [[The Doha Debates|Doha Debates]] panel on the motion "Dubai is a bad idea", held on 14 December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/09/world/middleeast/09iht-M09C-DOHA-DEBATE.html | work=The New York Times | first=Sara | last=Hamdan | title=Broadcasting Provocative Debate From an Island of Free Speech | date=2011-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Dubai Debates panel discussion was held on 23 February 2011.&lt;ref name="The National,Feb"&gt;{{cite web|author=Martin Croucher |url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/role-of-facebook-in-egyptian-revolution-overstated |title=Role of Facebook in Egyptian revolution 'overstated' - The National |publisher=Thenational.ae |date=2010-05-25 |accessdate=2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Format ==
A current debate topic is defined and announced through the Dubai Debates website, its [[YouTube]] channel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/DubaiDebates#p/a |title=Kanaal van DubaiDebates |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as on its [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]] feeds. At the same time, a date is announced for a panel debate on the respective issue. Interested users are then requested to submit their video contributions to the topic, which are all featured on the website and on YouTube.&lt;ref name="The National,June"&gt;{{cite web|author=- Friday |url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/dubai-debates-the-word-is-out-there |title=Dubai Debates: the word is out there - The National |publisher=Thenational.ae |date=2010-05-25 |accessdate=2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The panel sessions are split into thematic segments, each representing a specific question. All debates are video-filmed and made available after the event on DubaiDebates.com and YouTube. During the panel session, selected videos uploaded by outside contributors are shown. A Twitter hashtag is defined, allowing live discussions about the panel to be incorporated into the discussion. The number of segments was six for the first two editions of Dubai Debates, each between 6–9 minutes in length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zenithonline.de/deutsch/gesellschaft//article/die-mitmach-debatte/ |title=zenith: Artikel |publisher=Zenithonline.de |date= |accessdate=2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Previous debates ==

=== Mark Zuckerberg - the new hero of the Arab people? (Dubai Debates 1) ===
The inaugural Dubai Debates topic was "Mark Zuckerberg - the New Hero of the Arab People?". A panel session on the topic was held on 23 February at the Media One Hotel in Dubai. Participants included Mahmoud Salem, the award-winning Egyptian blogger widely known as Sandmonkey, as well as Daniel Gerlach of Zenith Magazine, [[Al Arabiya]] TV anchor Mahmoud Abu Obeid, and [[American University of Sharjah]] scholar Mohammed Ibahrine. The debate was filmed and widely viewed on the Internet since. The [[Goethe-Institut|Goethe Institute]] was one of the first supporters of the debate.&lt;ref name="The National,Feb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The National,June" /&gt;

=== After the Arab Awakening: Opportunities and Challenges for a New Arab World (Dubai Debates 2) ===
The second Dubai Debates topic was announced through Twitter on 12 May 2011 as "After the Arab Awakening: Opportunities and Challenges for a New Arab World". A panel debate on 31 May was initially planned to be held in co-operation with the [[American University in Dubai|American University in Dubai (AUD)]], in the main auditorium. On 28 May, three days before the debate, the event was moved to the [[Kempinski Hotel Mall of the Emirates|Kempinski Hotel Dubai]] and co-operation with AUD terminated without further comment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/DubaiDebates]{{Dead link|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Who’s got the power? The future of energy in the Arabian Gulf (Dubai Debates 3) ===
The latest Dubai Debates 3 took place at Knowledge Village Conference Centre in Dubai on 16 November.  The panel of speakers constituted [[Michael Peel]], Middle East Correspondent for the [[Financial Times]], [[Robin Mills]], Expert on Middle East energy strategy and economics to Dubai Government and columnist for [[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]] and formerly [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]]’s expert on [[Iran]], Kate Dorian Middle East editor covering energy developments throughout the [[Persian Gulf]] and North Africa for [[Platts]].

==Women, Civil Society, and Leadership in the New Arab World==
In cooperation with [[Vital Voices Global Partnership]], [[Konrad Adenauer Stiftung]] and [[CNN International]], Dubai Debates held its fourth edition on the topic Women, Civil Society and Leadership in the New Arab World. The panel brought together [[Amira Yahyaoui]], a Tunisian blogger, [[Dr. Ebtisam Al Kitbi]], professor of political science at UAE University, and [[Mohamed Abu Obeid]] a Palestinian women’s rights advocate and a TV presenter on [[Al Arabiya]] on 18 December 2011, for the first debate in Arabic language simultaneously translated into English, at the Dubai Knowledge Village Auditorium. The panel was moderated by [[Gulf News]] columnist Mishaal Al Gergawi.

# ''The role of women in the Arab revolutions has been exaggerated''
# ''There should be quotas for women in Arab parliaments?''
# ''Arab women should choose between family and business''
# ''The Western model of “women’s rights” should be applied to Arab countries''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4473">The '''Firearm Owners' Privacy Act''' (often abbreviated '''FOPA''') is a law passed by the [[Florida Legislature]] in 2011 in response to concerns raised by Floridians whose physicians asked them about gun ownership.&lt;ref name=parmet&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parmet|first1=Wendy E.|last2=Smith|first2=Jason A.|last3=Miller|first3=Matthew J.|title=Wollschlaeger v.

==Court rulings==
On June 29, 2012, [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida]] judge [[Marcia G. Cooke]] issued a permanent injunction against FOPA on the basis that it unduly burdened physicians' right to free speech. Governor Scott responded by filing an appeal of Cooke's ruling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weinberger|first1=Steven E.|last2=Lawrence|first2=Hal C.|last3=Henley|first3=Douglas E.|last4=Alden|first4=Errol R.|last5=Hoyt|first5=David B.|title=Legislative Interference with the Patient–Physician Relationship|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=18 October 2012|volume=367|issue=16|pages=1557–1559|doi=10.1056/NEJMsb1209858}}&lt;/ref&gt; which sent the case to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit]]. In 2014, in '''Wollschlaeger v. Governor of Florida''', a three-judge panel on the Eleventh Circuit reversed Cooke's injunction; the author of the ruling wrote that "the practice of good medicine does not require interrogation about irrelevant, private matters." In July 2015, a majority of Eleventh Circuit judges voted to re-hear Wollschlaeger v. Governor of Florida; on June 21, 2016, the Circuit heard arguments in the case.&lt;ref name=parmet/&gt;&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt;

On February 16, 2017, the en banc Eleventh Circuit, issuing two majority opinions, ruled that three of the law's four provisions—the anti-harassment, record-keeping, and inquiry provisions—violate the [[First Amendment]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/us/florida-doctors-discuss-guns-with-patients-court.html?_r=0 | title=Florida Doctors May Discuss Guns with Patients, Court Rules | work=New York Times | date=16 February 2017 | accessdate=17 February 2017 | author=Alvarez, Lissette}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court further interpreted one provision of the law, barring physician discrimination against patients who own guns, not to regulate speech, upholding the provision on that basis.

The term "'''Four Policemen'''" refers to a [[post-war]] council consisting of the Big Four that [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] proposed as a guarantor of [[world peace]]. The members of the '''Big Four''', called the '''Four Powers''' during [[World War II]], were the four major [[Allies of World War II]]: the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|China]]. The [[United Nations]] envisioned by Roosevelt consisted of three branches: an executive branch comprising the Big Four, an enforcement branch composed of the same four [[great power]]s acting as the Four Policemen or '''Four Sheriffs''', and an international assembly representing the member nations of the UN.{{sfn|Hoopes|Brinkley|1997|p=100}}

As a compromise with internationalist critics, the Big Four nations became the [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|permanent members]] of the [[United Nations Security Council]], with significantly less power than envisioned in the Four Policemen proposal.{{sfn|Gaddis|1972|p=27}} When the [[United Nations]] was officially established in later 1945, [[Provisional Government of the French Republic|France]] was in due course added as the fifth member of the council at that time&lt;ref name="UN year book"&gt;{{cite book|title=1946-47 Part 1: The United Nations.

==History==

===Background===
{{See also|League of Nations}}
During [[World War II]], President Roosevelt initiated post-war plans for the creation of a new and more durable international organization that would replace the former [[League of Nations]]. Prior to the war, Roosevelt had initially been a supporter of the League of Nations, but he lost confidence in the League due to its ineffectiveness at preventing the outbreak of the second World War. Roosevelt wanted to create an international organization that secured global peace through the unified efforts of the world's [[great powers]], rather than through the [[Wilsonianism|Wilsonian]] notions of international consensus and collaboration that guided the League of Nations.{{sfn|Gaddis|1972|p=24}} By 1935, he told his foreign policy adviser [[Sumner Welles]]: "The League of Nations has become nothing more than a debating society, and a poor one at that!"{{sfn|Welles|1951|pp=182–204}}

Roosevelt criticized the League of Nations for representing the interests of too many nations. The President said to the Soviet foreign minister [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] that "he could not visualize another League of Nations with 100 different signatories; there were simply too many nations to satisfy, hence it was a failure and would be a failure".{{sfn|United States Department of State|1942|p=573}} Roosevelt's proposal in 1941 was to create a new international body led by a "trusteeship" of great powers that would oversee smaller countries. In September 1941, he wrote:

{{quote|In the present complete world confusion, it is not thought advisable at this time to reconstitute a League of Nations which, because of its size, makes for disagreement and inaction... There seem no reason why the principle of trusteeship in private affairs should be not be extended to the international field. Trusteeship is based on the principle of unselfish service. For a time at least there are many minor children among the peoples of the world who need trustees in their relations with other nations and people, just as there are many adult nations or peoples which must be led back into a spirit of good conduct.{{sfn|Gaddis|1972|p=24}}}}

The State Department had begun drafting a postwar successor to the League of Nations under the auspices of Roosevelt while the United States was still formally a neutral power.{{sfn|Bosco|2009|p=14}} Roosevelt was reluctant to publicly announce his plans for creating a postwar international body. He was aware of the risk that the American public might reject his proposals, and he did not want to repeat [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s struggle to convince the Senate to approve American membership in the League of Nations. When the [[Atlantic Charter]] was issued in August 1941, Roosevelt had ensured that the charter omitted mentioning any American commitment towards the establishment of a new international body after the war.{{sfn|Gaddis|1972|pp=25–26}} The [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in December 1941 led to a change in Roosevelt's position. He transformed his trusteeship proposal into an organization centered around the Four Policemen: the United States, China, the Soviet Union, and Britain.{{sfn|Gaddis|1972|p=24}}

===Plans for the Four Policemen===
[[File:United Nations organization sketch by Franklin Roosevelt with the Four Policemen in 1943.jpg|thumb|right|1943 sketch by Franklin Roosevelt of the United Nations' original three branches. The branch on the right represents the Four Policemen.]]
The idea that great powers should "police" the world had been discussed by President Roosevelt as early as August 1941, during his first meeting with Winston Churchill. Roosevelt made his first references to the Four Policemen proposal in early 1942.{{sfn|Kimball|1991|p=85}} He presented his postwar plans to Molotov,{{sfn|Dallek|1995|p=342}} who had arrived in Washington on May 29 to discuss the possibility of launching a second front in Europe.{{sfn|Gaddis|1972|p=68}} Roosevelt told Molotov that the Big Four must unite after the war to police the world and disarm aggressor states.{{sfn|Kimball|1991|p=85}} When Molotov asked about the role of other countries, Roosevelt answered by opining that too many "policemen" could lead to infighting, but he was open to the idea of allowing other allied countries to participate.{{sfn|Kimball|1991|p=85}} A memorandum of the conference summarizes their conversation:

{{quote|The President told Molotov that he visualized the enforced disarmament of our enemies and, indeed, some of our friends after the war; that he thought that the United States, England, Russia and perhaps China should police the world and enforce disarmament by inspection. The President said that he visualized Germany, Italy, Japan, France, Czechoslovakia, Rumania and other nations would not be permitted to have military forces. He stated that other nations might join the first four mentioned after experience proved they could be trusted.{{sfn|United States Department of State|1942|p=573}}}}

Roosevelt and Molotov continued their discussion of the Four Policemen in a second meeting on June 1. Molotov informed the President that Stalin was willing to support Roosevelt's plans for maintaining postwar peace through the Four Policemen and enforced disarmament. Roosevelt also raised the issue of postwar decolonization. He suggested that former colonies should undergo a period of transition under the governance of an international trusteeship prior to their independence.{{sfn|Dallek|1995|p=342}}{{sfn|United States Department of State|1942|p=580}}

China was brought in as a member of the Big Four and a future member of the Four Policemen. Roosevelt was in favor of recognizing China as a great power because he was certain that the Chinese would side with the Americans against the Soviets. He said to British Foreign Secretary [[Anthony Eden]], "In any serious conflict of policy with Russia, [China] would undoubtedly line up on our side." The President believed that a pro-American China would be useful for the United States should the Americans, Soviets, and Chinese agree to jointly occupy Japan and Korea after the war.{{sfn|Dallek|1995|p=390}} When Molotov voiced concerns about the stability of China, Roosevelt responded by saying that the combined "population of our nations and friends was well over a billion people."{{sfn|United States Department of State|1942|p=573}}{{sfn|Dallek|1995|p=342}}

Churchill objected to Roosevelt's inclusion of China as one of the Big Four because he feared that the Americans were trying to undermine Britain's colonial holdings in Asia. In October 1942, Churchill told Eden that Republican China represented a "[[Faggot voter|faggot vote]] on the side of the United States in any attempt to liquidate the British overseas empire."{{sfn|Dallek|1995|p=389}} Eden shared this view with Churchill and expressed skepticism that China, which was then in the midst of a civil war, could ever return to a stable nation. Roosevelt responded to Churchill's criticism by telling Eden that "China might become a very useful power in the Far East to help police Japan" and that he was fully supportive of offering more aid to China.{{sfn|Dallek|1995|p=390}}

Roosevelt's Four Policemen proposal received criticism from the liberal internationalists, who wanted power to be more evenly distributed among the member nations of the UN. Internationalists were concerned that the Four Policemen could lead to a new Quadruple Alliance.{{sfn|Gaddis|1972|p=27}}

===Formation of the United Nations===
On New Year's Day 1942, the representatives of Allied "Big Four", the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union and China, signed a short document which later came to be known as the [[Declaration by United Nations]] and the next day the representatives of twenty-two other nations added their signatures.{{sfn|United Nations Official Website}}{{sfn|Ma|2003|pp=203–204}}
A new plan for the United Nations was drafted by the State Department in April 1944. It kept the emphasis on [[great power]] solidarity that was central to Roosevelt's Four Policemen proposal for the United Nations. The members of the Big Four would serve as permanent members of the United Nation's Security Council. Each of the four permanent members would be given a [[United Nations Security Council veto power]], which would override any UN resolution that went against the interests of one of the Big Four. However, the State Department had compromised with the liberal internationalists. Membership eligibility was widened to include all nation states fighting against the Axis powers instead of a select few. The [[Dumbarton Oaks Conference]] convened in August 1944 to discuss plans for the postwar United Nations with delegations from the United States, United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and China.{{sfn|Gaddis|1972|p=27}} The Big Four were the only four sponsoring countries of the [[San Francisco Conference]] of 1945 and their heads of the delegations took turns as chairman of the plenary meetings.{{sfn|United Nations Official Website|1945}} During this conference, the Big Four and their allies signed the [[United Nations Charter]].{{sfn|Gaddis|1972|p=28}}

==Legacy==
In the words of a former Undersecretary General of the UN, Sir [[Brian Urquhart]]:

{{quote|It was a pragmatic system based on the primacy of the strong — a "[[trustee]]ship of the powerful," as he then called it, or, as he put it later, "the Four Policemen." The concept was, as [Senator Arthur H.] [[Arthur H. Vandenberg|Vandenberg]] noted in his diary in April 1944, "anything but a wild-eyed internationalist dream of a world state.... It is based virtually on a four-power alliance." Eventually this proved to be both the potential strength and the actual weakness of the future UN, an organization theoretically based on a concert of great powers whose own mutual hostility, as it turned out, was itself the greatest potential threat to world peace.&lt;ref name="sheriff"&gt;{{cite book

==Early life==
Lascelles was born in the [[Oxfordshire]] village of [[Sibford Gower]] with the surname of Stevens, the son of Rev. Edward Thomas Stevens, the village priest.&lt;ref name="sibfords"&gt;The Sibfords Society, 'Frank Lascelles (1875-1934)' http://thesibfords.org.uk/sibipedia/frank-lascelles&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at the village school before attending [[Keble College, Oxford]], where he became the most notable member of Oxford's dramatic society. After Oxford, he worked as an actor in [[London]] between 1904 and 1906 at Sir [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]]'s His Majesty's theatre. It was during this time that he changed his name from Stevens to Lascelles.&lt;ref name="sibfords"/&gt;

==Career==
Lascelles staged his first pageant in 1907. The Oxford Historical was a success, despite initial reservations by the University authorities and a student riot. The following year he organised the celebrations for the [[History of Canada|Tercentenary of Canada]] at [[Quebec City]].&lt;ref name="courier"&gt;''The Courier-Mail'' (Brisbane, Australia, 26 May 1934), p.13 http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article36738148&lt;/ref&gt; Lascelles enlisted the services of the [[Iroquois]] and was made an honorary chief under the name of Tehonikonraka, "the man of infinite resource". In 1909 he Master of Pageantry at the celebration of the opening of the [[Union of South Africa|Union Parliament of South Africa]] in [[Cape Town]].&lt;ref name="courier"/&gt; The following year he organised the Pageant of London, performed by a cast of 15,000. In 1912 Lascelles was Master of the Pageant at the [[Delhi Durbar|Coronation Durbar]] at [[Calcutta]] with the participation of over 300,000 Indians and [[British Army]] troops.&lt;ref name="courier"/&gt; In 1923 he was Master of the Harrow Pageant and the following year Master of the Bristol Pageant (Cradle of the Empire) and the Pageant of Empire at the [[British Empire Exhibition]]. Lascelles' imperial triumphs earned him the epithet "the man who staged the empire".&lt;ref name="oxfordshire"/&gt;

He was also a sculptor, and among his subjects were the [[Edward VIII|Prince of Wales]], the [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn|Duke of Connaught]], [[Albert Grey, 4th Earl Grey|Earl Grey]] and the [[Aga Khan III|Aga Khan]].&lt;ref name="courier"/&gt; Several of his sculptures are displayed in prominent positions across the former Empire. He sculpted a memorial to his mother in the church at Sibford Gower, as well as painting a Roll of Honour. He also contributed prose and verse to periodicals. In 1932 the [[Earl of Darnley]] compiled ''Our Modern Orpheus'', a volume of essays paying tribute to Lascelles.

==Personal life==
Lascelles had always been anxious to hide his humble origins, and built a new manor house for himself in Sibford Gower, modeled on a medieval design.&lt;ref name="sibfords"/&gt; He was well-connected, and regularly entertained guests such as [[Ivor Novello]], who wrote the popular song [[Keep the Home Fires Burning (1914 song)|''Keep the Home Fires Burning'']] while staying with Lascelles in Sibford.

Towards the end of his life, ill health restricted Lascelles' finances and he died in poverty on 23 May 1934 in rented rooms in Brighton. He never married.

'''Frederick Augustus I''' (full name: ''Frederick Augustus Joseph Maria Anthony John Nepomuk Aloysius Xavier''; {{lang-de|Friedrich August Josef Maria Anton Johann Nepomuk Alois Xavier}}; {{lang-pl|Fryderyk August Józef Maria Antoni Jan Nepomucen Alojzy Ksawery Wettyn}}; 23 December 1750 – 5 May 1827) was a member of the [[House of Wettin]] who reigned as [[Electorate of Saxony|Elector of Saxony]] from 1763 to 1806 (as '''Frederick Augustus III''') and as King of [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]] from 1806 to 1827. He also served as [[Duchy of Warsaw|Duke of Warsaw]] from 1807 to 1813.

Succeeding his father in 1763 as the elector Frederick Augustus III, he brought order and efficiency to his country's finances and administration. In foreign policy, he was neutralist but drifted towards [[Prussia]], whose side he took in the Bavarian succession dispute (1778–79), when it prevented Bavaria's cession to [[Austria]].&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/217999/Frederick-Augustus-I&lt;/ref&gt; For his cooperation he received substantial financial compensation from Prussia. In 1785, Frederick Augustus joined the Prussian-sponsored Fürstenbund (League of Princes), but remained neutral during the Austro-Prussian dispute in 1790. Offered the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish crown]] in 1791, he declined as he feared that his "risky" politics may cause further damage to the Polish state, which was already weak and eventually [[Partitions of Poland|stopped existing in 1795]]. The next year [[Saxony]] reluctantly joined the coalition against Revolutionary France but was defeated by 1796. Again entering the struggle on Prussia's side in 1806, after the decisive defeat at Jena in the same year, Frederick Augustus made peace with Napoleon, which secured the title of king of Saxony for him. A year later, Napoleon secured the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] for him. Frederick Augustus remained a loyal ally to [[France]] even after the disastrous [[Napoleon's invasion of Russia|Russian campaign]] (1812–13). Although he had started half-hearted negotiations with Austria, he broke them off after the French victory at Lützen (May 1813). In the [[Battle of Leipzig]] (October 1813), however, his troops went over to Prussia and he was taken as prisoner to Berlin. At the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Frederick Augustus lost three-fifths of his territory to Prussia. He spent the rest of his life attempting to rehabilitate his truncated state.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt;

Throughout his political career Frederick Augustus tried to rehabilitate and recreate the [[Poland|Polish state]] that was torn apart and stopped existing after the final [[partitions of Poland|partition]] of [[Poland]] in 1795, however he did not succeed - for this he would blame himself for the rest of his life. Nevertheless, his efforts for reestablishing an independent Polish nation did endear him to the Polish people.

The [[Augustusplatz]] in [[Leipzig]] is named after him.

==Elector of Saxony and Designated King of Poland==

===Family Background===
He was the second (but eldest surviving) son of [[Frederick Christian, Elector of Saxony]], and [[Maria Antonia Walpurgis of Bavaria]], Princess of [[House of Wittelsbach|Bavaria]].  Because he was underage at the time of the death of his father in 1763, his mother served as [[Regent]] until 1768. His uncle [[Franz Xavier of Saxony|Prince Franz Xavier]] functioned as his representative.&lt;ref name="Flathe"&gt;Heinrich Theodor Flathe: ''Friedrich August I., König von Sachsen''. In: ''[[Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie]]'' (ADB). Volume 7, Duncker &amp; Humblot, Leipzig 1878, pp. 786–789 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renunciation of the Polish throne===
In 1765 Prince Franz Xavier ceded the Polish throne to [[Stanisław II Augustus]] on behalf of the underage Elector. Frederick Augustus was named successor to Stanislaw, however, when a Polish Constitution was ratified by the [[Sejm of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish Sejm]]. At the same time, the head of the Saxon Royal House was established as heir to the Polish throne (Article VII of the Polish Constitution). Frederick Augustus declined to accept the crown upon Stanislaw's death in 1798, because he feared becoming entangled in disputes with Austria, Prussia and Russia, who had begun to partition Poland in 1772.&lt;ref name="Schaefer"&gt;Dagmar Schäfer: ''Der gefangene Sachsenkönig. Eine Erinnerung an Sachsens ersten König, Friedrich August I. (1750–1827)''. Tauchaer Verlag, Taucha 1996, {{ISBN|3-910074-52-9}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a matter of fact, a full partition of Poland among the neighboring powers of Austria, Prussia, and Russia had already taken place by 1795.

===Foreign policy up to the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire===
[[File:Kurfürst Friedrich August III. von Sachsen, genannt der Gerechte.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.5|Frederick Augustus in 1795]]
In August 1791, Frederick Augustus arranged a meeting with [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]] and King [[Frederick William II of Prussia|Friedrich Wilhelm II]] of Prussia at [[Pillnitz Castle]] that was intended partly to offer support for the French monarchy in the face of revolutionary agitation in France.&lt;ref name="Flathe" /&gt; The [[Declaration of Pillnitz]] warned of the possibility of military action against the French revolutionary government, a provocation that provided it with grounds to declare war on Austria in April 1792. Frederick Augustus himself did not sign the Declaration.

Saxony wanted nothing to do with the defensive alliance against France formed between Austria and Prussia. Nonetheless, a proclamation of the [[Reichstag (Holy Roman Empire)|Reichstag]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] issued in March 1793 obligated Frederick Augustus to take part. There was great concern in Saxony in April 1795 when Prussia suddenly concluded a separate peace with France in order to facilitate the partition of Poland. Saxony dropped out of the coalition against France in August 1796 after France had advanced east into the German lands and additional conditions for the Holy Roman Empire to conclude a separate peace were agreed to.

Both the peace agreement with France and Saxony's participation in the [[Second Congress of Rastatt|Congress of Rastatt]] in 1797 served to demonstrate Frederick Augustus' loyalty to the conventional constitutional principles of the Holy Roman Empire. The Congress of Rastatt was supposed to authorize the surrender of left bank areas of the Rhine to France in return for compensation for the rulers who were relinquishing their territories. Saxony refused to agree to territorial adjustments that were designed to benefit Bavaria, Prussia, Württemberg, and Baden at the Congress of Rastatt and in 1803 at the issuance of the Final Report of the Empire Delegation [the law of the Holy Roman Empire that laid out the new order of the Empire].

===Foreign policy until the peace with Napoleon===
Frederick Augustus also did not participate in the creation of the [[Confederation of the Rhine]], which led to the final dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire. With respect to the Prussian idea of a north German empire, within which Saxony was supposed to be raised to a kingdom, he appeared reserved. However, when Napoleon advanced as far as Thuringia after September 1806 in response to the [[Berlin Ultimatum]], which demanded the withdrawal of French troops from the left bank of the Rhine, Frederick Augustus joined with Prussia. At the [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt|twin battles of Jena and Auerstedt]] in 1806 the Prussian – Saxon troops suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of Napoleon. Separated from Prussia, whose state and army leadership withdrew headlong to the east, left without any information concerning Prussian intentions, and with Napoleon's troops about to occupy Saxony, Frederick Augustus had to conclude peace. On 11 December 1806 in [[Poznań]] a treaty was signed by authorized representatives of both sides. Saxony was forced to join the Confederation of the Rhine and had to surrender areas of Thuringia to the recently organized [[Kingdom of Westphalia]].  As compensation, Saxony was given the area around [[Cottbus]] and was raised to the status of a kingdom alongside the Confederation states of Bavaria and [[Württemberg]].

Frederick Augustus was proclaimed king of Saxony on 20 December 1806. After the [[Treaties of Tilsit|Treaty of Tilsit]], which [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] and Czar [[Alexander I of Russia]] concluded with Napoleon in July 1807, Frederick Augustus was also named duke of Warsaw. Although he had rejected the offer of the kingdom of Poland in 1795 by the Sejm, he could not refuse a Polish title a second time.&lt;ref name="Flathe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schaefer" /&gt;

The [[Constitution of the Duchy of Warsaw]], which Napoleon dictated to Saxony, joined the Duchy of Warsaw hereditarily to the Royal House of Saxony in Article V, which was linked to the Polish Constitution of 1791. Geopolitically the Duchy of Warsaw comprised the areas of the 2nd and 3rd [[Partitions of Poland|Prussian partitions]] (1795), with the exception of [[Gdańsk|Danzig (Gdańsk)]], which was made into the [[Free City of Danzig (Napoleonic)|Free City of Danzig]] under joint French and Saxon "protection", and the district around [[Białystok]], which was given to Russia. The area of Prussian control was made up of territory from the former Prussian provinces of [[New East Prussia]], [[Southern Prussia]], [[New Silesia]], and [[West Prussia]]. In addition, the new state was given the area along the Noteć river and the "[[Chełmno Land|Land of Chełmno]]".

Altogether, the Duchy had an initial area of around 104,000&amp;nbsp;km², with a population of approximately 2,600,000. The bulk of its inhabitants were Poles.

In 1809, Austria was successfully defeated by Polish–Saxon troops after it attempted to take possession of the Duchy and for its part had to cede to the Duchy of Warsaw Polish regions absorbed up to 1795, among them the old Polish royal city of [[Kraków]]. In July 1812 Frederick Augustus ratified a proclamation of the Polish Parliament that restored the Kingdom of Poland. Napoleon lodged a protest against this action.

===Events during the War of Liberation===
[[File:Fryderyk August I.jpg|thumb|right|Frederick Augustus, by [[Carl Christian Vogel von Vogelstein|Vogel]]]]
In 1813 during the [[German Campaign of 1813]], Saxony found itself in a more difficult situation than many other warring states. The country was still solidly in Napoleon's grip and at the same time had become the central arena of the war. In the autumn of 1813 at the start of the [[Battle of Leipzig]] (Battle of Nations) the local population of Saxony, which tallied about 2 million, saw almost a million soldiers brought to its territories. Napoleon openly threatened to consider Saxony as enemy territory and treat it accordingly should Frederick Augustus change sides. Frederick Augustus' room for maneuver was consequently greatly limited. He did not want to put the country's well-being into play frivolously. At the same time, he still remembered vividly the way in which Prussia had simply abandoned him in 1806.

In this difficult situation the King attempted to enter cautiously into an alliance with the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|Sixth Coalition]] in 1813 without risking a public break with Napoleon and a declaration of war. As the Prussian and Russian troops entered Saxony in the spring, the King first moved to the south in order to avoid a direct encounter and pursued an alliance with Austria secretly from Regensburg. The Saxon-Austrian Pact was concluded on 20 April and the King made the Prussian and Russian allies aware of it at the same time. Napoleon, from whom Frederick Augustus was not able to keep the diplomatic maneuvers concealed, summoned the King urgently to Saxony after he had defeated the Prussian-Russian troops at [[Battle of Lützen (1813)|Lützen]] on 2 May. Frederick Augustus decided to comply with the ultimatum presented to him. With no prospect of concrete assistance from Austria, and in view of the defeat of the Prussian – Russian coalition, which now sent peace signals to France, he felt he had no choice.

Frederick Augustus' decision brought the country scarcely any relief. Napoleon, angered at the near defection of the King and at the same time dependent upon the full mobilization of all available forces against the Coalition troops, harshly demanded the full resources of Saxony. In addition, the country suffered under the changing fortunes of war and associated movements and quartering. At the end of August the Allies failed again to defeat Napoleon at the [[Battle of Dresden]]. Meanwhile, Saxony became the principal arena of war and Dresden the midpoint of the French army movements. Not until 9 September in [[Teplice]] (in the present-day [[Czech Republic]]) did Austria conclude its alliance with Prussia and Russia. As Napoleon's troops in Saxony formed up for the retreat before the expanded coalition, the first defectors from the Saxon army to the allies came in September.

Frederick Augustus was mistrustful of Prussia in view of the experiences of the spring and arguably disappointed as well by Austria's decision not to join the Coalition immediately, especially while the country was exposed as before to French domination. Thus he chose not to break with Napoleon.  At the [[Battle of Leipzig]] [Battle of Nations] the Saxon as well as the Polish troops fought on the side of Napoleon. In view of the apparent defeat of the French, even larger Saxon troop formations went over to the Coalition during the battle, whereas the Polish troops were largely annihilated.

===Settlement of Saxon affairs at the Congress of Vienna===
At the deliberations of the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1814 and 1815, Frederick Augustus' position was doomed by his country's difficult geographic position, the changing fortunes of war, a lack of assistance from Austria, and his own hesitant attitude. The [[Prussian-Russian alliance]] had never had an honorable intention in bringing Saxony into the anti-Napoleon alliance in the first place. Even before Prussia declared war on France on 17 March 1813, it had agreed to an alliance with Russia to the detriment of Saxony and Poland at Kalisz on 22 February: the Duchy of Poland would predominantly come under Russian rule, whereas Prussia would be compensated for relinquished Polish territories with the annexation of Saxon territory. Prussia's appetite for the economically and culturally more developed territories of Saxony originated in the old dream of annexation that [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick II]] had developed in his political testament of 1752 and had already tried to realize in the [[Seven Years' War]].  It did not originate from any necessity to overcome Napoleonic rule in central Europe.

After the Battle of Leipzig the Prussian-Russian alliance showed no interest in an alliance with the Saxon king in the wider struggle against Napoleon irrespective of offers of support from Frederick Augustus. Rather, the King was taken into captivity to [[Friedrichsfelde]] near Berlin and placed under Russian-Prussian custody in the name of a "General Government of High Allied Powers."

The forceful manner of Prussian minister [[Baron von Stein]], not the government administered by Russian [[Prince Repnin]] until November 1814 or the subsequent Prussian occupying force that lasted to June 1815, were responsible for the low morale in Saxony at the end of the Napoleonic Wars. In contrast to the representatives of France, Frederick Augustus was denied participation at the Congress of Vienna as punishment for his supposed role as the quasi- deputy of his former ally Napoleon. Certainly nothing other than the intention of Prussia and Russia to carry out the annexation plans agreed to in Kalisz was responsible for this treatment of the Saxon king. That Saxony was not completely abandoned can be attributed to the fear of Austria and France of an overly-strengthened Prussia. Because the Saxon question threatened to break up the Congress, the allies finally agreed to divide Saxony (7 January 1815) with the mediation of the Czar.

===Acceptance of the post-war order of the Congress of Vienna===
Frederick Augustus delayed his agreement to the division of his country after he was released from a Prussian prison in February 1815. Since the King had no choice, he finally gave in, and on 18 May consented to the peace treaty laid before him by Prussia and Russia. With the signing of the treaty on 21 May 1815, 57% of Saxon territory and 42% of the Saxon population was turned over to Prussia.

Places and areas that had been connected to the Saxon landscape for hundreds of years became completely foreign, absorbed in part into artificially created administrative regions.  Examples include [[Wittenberg]], the old capital of the Saxon Elector State during the Holy Roman Empire, and seat of the National University made famous by [[Martin Luther]] and Melanchthon (which was already done away with in 1817 by means of a merger with the Prussian University of Halle), and [[Torgau]], birthplace and place of residence of the Elector [[Frederick the Wise]], which was incorporated into one of the new hybrids created by Prussia under the name [[Province of Saxony]]. [[Lower Lusatia]], which like [[Upper Lusatia]] had preserved its constitutional autonomy under Saxon rule, was incorporated into the [[Province of Brandenburg]] and ceased to exist as a state. Upper Lusatia was arbitrarily divided: the area assigned to Prussia, including [[Görlitz]], was added to the [[Province of Silesia]]; these areas also lost their constitutional autonomy.

On 22 May 1815 Frederick Augustus abdicated as ruler of the Duchy of Warsaw, whose territory was annexed mainly to Russia, but also partly to Prussia and Austria. In the area assigned to Russia, a [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]] was created to join in a hereditary union with the Czars. The old royal city of Kraków no longer belonged to the new kingdom, and became a [[Republic of Kraków|separate republic]]. The internal autonomy that it enjoyed at first was abolished in 1831 after the [[November Uprising|Polish Uprising]].

==King of Saxony==

===Standing among the Saxon people upon his return===
When Frederick returned home to Saxony in July 1815 he was greeted enthusiastically throughout the land. Numerous expressions of loyalty also reached the king from the ceded territories, where the populace regarded the new rulers coolly; shortly thereafter the notion of being "mandatory-Prussian" began to circulate. In [[Liège (province)|Liège]], where the majority of the regiments of the Saxon Army had been stationed since the beginning of 1815, there was a revolt at the end of April. At the behest of the Prussian king, [[Generalfeldmarschall]] [[Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher|Blücher]] was to discharge the soldiers who came from the annexed territories, but Frederick Augustus' men had not yet made their departure, and the Saxon soldiers rioted over it. Blücher had to flee the city and was able to put down the revolt only by calling up additional Prussian troops.

Public opinion in Saxony lay decisively on Frederick Augustus' side at the time of his return. There was a feeling that Prussian policies were too ruthless both against the country and the king. The avarice of special interests in Berlin came across all too clearly as the rewards of the War of Liberation were distributed.

===Final years===
The last twelve years of Frederick Augustus' government passed largely quietly.&lt;ref name="Flathe" /&gt; The conservative character of the king, which in foreign policy up to 1806 had manifested itself in unconditional loyalty to Saxon interests, hardened even more after the experience of Napoleonic hegemony. With respect to political reform the King achieved little. Until his death in 1827, which falls on the same date as Napoleon's death anniversary, little was altered in the constitutional regulation of the Saxon state.  To be sure, the king failed to do so out of respect for the rights of the remaining Lusatian upper classes. Just as little came of the desire of many people to transform the existing political system to accommodate a genuine legislature. There was scarcely any lessening of admiration for the old king who had overseen the destiny of Saxony for more than half a century. During his lifetime he gained the name "The Just". Resentment over the delayed economic and social rebuilding of the country was to be felt by his brother, King Anton.

Frederick Augustus was entombed in the Roman Catholic Cathedral of Dresden.&lt;ref name="Schaefer" /&gt;

==Marriage and issue==
In [[Mannheim]] on 17 January 1769 (by proxy) and again in [[Dresden]] on 29 January 1769 (in person), Frederick Augustus married the Countess Palatine  (''Pfalzgräfin'') [[Amalie of Zweibrücken-Birkenfeld]], sister of King [[Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria]]. During their marriage, Amalia gave birth to four children, but only one daughter survived to adulthood:

#Stillborn child (1771)
#Stillborn child (1775)
#[[Princess Maria Augusta of Saxony|Maria Augusta Nepomucena Antonia Franziska Xaveria Aloysia]] (b. Dresden, 21 June 1782 – d. Dresden, 14 March 1863)
#Stillborn child (1797)

He had an illegitimate daughter, which was born out of a relationship of Friedrick Augustus with the daughter of a Jewish court financier in Dresden.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.weber-gesamtausgabe.de/de/A000537/Korrespondenz&lt;/ref&gt;

Without surviving male issue, Frederick Augustus was succeeded as King of Saxony by his younger brother [[Anthony of Saxony|Anton]].

[[File:GoldwaterNichols.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[United States Senate|Sen.]] [[Barry Goldwater]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]—[[Arizona|AZ]]) and [[United States House of Representatives|Rep.]] [[William Flynt Nichols]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]—[[Alabama's 4th congressional district|AL-4]]), the co-sponsors of the Goldwater–Nichols Act of 1986.]]
The '''Goldwater–Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of October 4, 1986''' {{USPL|99|433}}, (signed by President [[Ronald Reagan]]), made the most sweeping changes to the [[United States Department of Defense]] since the department was established in the [[National Security Act of 1947]] by reworking the command structure of the [[United States military]]. It increased the powers of the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] and implemented some of the suggestions from the [[Packard Commission]], commissioned by President [[Reagan]] in 1985. Among other changes, '''Goldwater–Nichols''' streamlined the military [[chain of command]], which now runs from the President through the [[Secretary of Defense]] directly to [[combatant commander]]s (CCDRs, all four-star generals or admirals), bypassing the service chiefs. The service chiefs were assigned to an advisory role to the President and the Secretary of Defense as well as given the responsibility for training and equipping personnel for the [[Unified Combatant Command|unified combatant commands]].

Named after Senator [[Barry Goldwater]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Arizona]]) and Representative [[William Flynt Nichols|William Flynt "Bill" Nichols]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Alabama]]), the bill passed the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], 383–27, and the [[United States Senate|Senate]], 95–0. It was signed into law by [[Ronald Reagan|President Reagan]] on October 1, 1986. Admiral [[William J. Crowe]] was the first Chairman to serve under this new legislation.

==History==
The Goldwater–Nichols Act was an attempt to fix problems caused by [[inter-service rivalry]], which had emerged during the [[Vietnam War]], contributed to the catastrophic failure of the [[Operation Eagle Claw|Iranian hostage rescue mission]] in 1980, and which were still evident in the [[invasion of Grenada]] in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cole|first1=Ronald H.|title=Grenada, Panama, and Haiti: Joint Operational Reform|journal=Joint Force Quarterly|date=1999|issue=20 (Autumn/Winter 1998-99)|pages=57-74|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a422959.pdf|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.history.army.mil/books/AMH-V2/AMH%20V2/chapter12.htm|chapter=Chapter 12: Rebuilding the Army Vietnam to Desert Storm |title=American Military History, Volume II|publisher=[[United States Army Center of Military History]] |url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/AMH-V2/AMH%20V2/index.htm#cont |editor=Richard W. Stewart |year=2005 |accessdate=2008-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such problems existed as well in World War II, during which two independent lines of command flowed from the President, one through the [[Secretary of the Navy]] to naval forces, and the other through the [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] to land and air forces. In 1947, the military restructuring placed all military forces, including the newly independent [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], under a single civilian [[Secretary of Defense]].

However, the United States military was still organized along lines of command that reported to their respective service chiefs ([[Commandant of the Marine Corps]], Chiefs of Staff of the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army]] and [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force|Air Force]], and [[Chief of Naval Operations]]). These service chiefs in turn made up the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]]. The Joint Chiefs of Staff elected a Chairman to communicate with the civilian government. The [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff|Chairman of the Joint Chiefs]] in turn reported to the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], the civilian head of the military.  Both the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the Secretary of Defense reported to the [[President of the United States]], who holds the position of commander-in-chief (CINC) of all [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. Armed Forces]].

This system led to counter-productive inter-service rivalry.  Peacetime activities (such as procurement and creation of [[Military Science|doctrine]], etc.) were tailored for each service in isolation.  Additionally, wartime activities of each service were largely planned, executed, and evaluated independently.  These practices resulted in division of effort and an inability to profit from [[economies of scale]], and inhibited the development of modern warfare doctrine.

The formulation of the [[AirLand Battle]] doctrine in the late 1970s and early 1980s laid bare the difficulty of coordinating efforts among various service branches. AirLand Battle attempted to synthesize all of the capabilities of the service arms of the military into a single doctrine. The system envisioned ground, naval, air, and space based systems acting in concert to attack and defeat an opponent in depth. The structure of the armed forces effectively blocked realization of this ideal. The US [[Operation Urgent Fury|invasion of Grenada]] in 1983 further exposed the problems with the military command structure. Although the United States forces easily prevailed, its leaders expressed major concerns over both the inability of the different service branches to coordinate and communicate with each other, and the consequences of a lack of coordination if faced with a more threatening foe.

==Effects==
The Goldwater–Nichols Act brought sweeping changes to the way the U.S. military forces were organized. The first successful test of Goldwater–Nichols was the 1989 [[United States Invasion of Panama]] (code-named [[Operation Just Cause]]), where it functioned exactly as planned, allowing the U.S. commander, Army General [[Maxwell Reid Thurman]], to exercise full control over [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]], [[United States Army|Army]], [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] and [[United States Navy|Navy]] assets without having to negotiate with the individual services.

===Chain of command and military advice===
Under the Goldwater–Nichols Act, military advice was centralized in the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff|Chairman of the Joint Chiefs]] as opposed to the service chiefs. The Chairman was designated as the principal military adviser to the [[President of the United States]], [[National Security Council (USA)|National Security Council]] and [[Secretary of Defense]]. The Act also established the position of [[Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] and simplified the chain of command. Additionally, the Act states that the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff cannot be representatives from the same service branch. It increased the ability of the Chairman to direct overall strategy, but provided greater command authority to "unified" and "specified" field commanders.  According to the Act, the Chairman ''may not exercise military command over the Joint Chiefs of Staff or any of the armed forces''.&lt;ref&gt;Section 152c of the Act&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 162(b) of the Act prescribes that "unless otherwise directed by the President, the chain of command to a unified or specified combatant command runs—

# "from the President to the Secretary of Defense," and
# "from the Secretary of Defense to the commander of the combatant command".&lt;ref&gt;Goldwater–Nicholls DOD Reorganization Act, 10 USC 162, Combatant Commands; Assigned Forces; Chain of Command, Section (b), Chain of Command.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interaction of services===
Goldwater–Nichols changed the way the services interact. The services themselves "organize, train and equip" forces for use by the [[combatant commander]]s (CCDRs), and the service chiefs no longer exercise any operational control over their forces. Rather than reporting to a service chief operationally, the service component forces support the commander responsible for a specific function ([[United States Special Operations Command|Special Operations]], [[United States Strategic Command|Strategic]], and [[United States Transportation Command|Transportation]]) or a geographic region of the globe ([[United States Northern Command|Northern]], [[United States Central Command|Central]], [[United States European Command|European]], [[United States Pacific Command|Pacific]], [[United States Southern Command|Southern]], and [[United States Africa Command|Africa]] Commands). The combatant commanders then field a force capable of employing AirLand Battle doctrine (or its successors) using all assets available to the integrated unified action plan, including the military, interagency organizations of the US Government such as USAID and the Department of State, and intelligence agencies. The restructuring afforded a combination of effort, integrated planning, shared procurement, and a reduction or elimination of inter-service rivalry. It also provided unity of command, conforming with leading [[military science]].  Individual services changed from relatively autonomous war-fighting entities into organizational and training units, responsible for acquisition, modernization, force-development, and readiness as a component of the integrated force. Thus [[USCENTCOM]] (U.S. Central Command), for example, would be assigned air, ground, naval, Marine, and special operations assets to achieve its objectives, not the previously less efficient method of individual services planning, supporting, and fighting the same war. This was successfully demonstrated during [[Operation Desert Storm]] in 1991.

===Personnel management of officers===
Another major effect of the Act is the way it has dramatically changed the personnel management of military officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title10/html/USCODE-2011-title10-subtitleA-partII-chap38-sec661.htm|title=U.S.C. Title 10 - ARMED FORCES|website=www.gpo.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many officers are assigned to Joint Duty positions (occasionally more than once), and are educated in Department of Defense [[Joint Professional Military Education]] (JPME) schools as part of their career development and progression. For example, in order to be competitive for promotion to General or Flag Officer (Admiral) (pay grade O-7 or above/NATO OF-6), Active Component colonels (pay grade O-6/NATO OF-5) (Army, Marine Corps, and Air Force) or Navy captains must have completed at least one Joint Duty assignment, as well as having completed (or currently be enrolled in) a JPME school that grants JPME Level II credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/2155|title=10 U.S. Code § 2155 - Joint professional military education Phase II program of instruction|website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shared procurement===
Shared procurement allowed the various branches to share technological advances such as [[stealth technology|stealth]] and [[smart weapon]]s quickly, and provided other ancillary benefits (such as improved interoperability of radios and communications between units and members of different services). Joint implementation of new technology allowed for joint development of supporting doctrine. The Goldwater–Nichols Act could be seen as the initial step of the currently ongoing [[Revolution in Military Affairs]] (RMA) with its concept of [[Network Centric Warfare]] (NCW).

==Changes since 1986==
On October 24, 2002, Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]] ordered that the functional and regional commanders be referred to not as "[[Commander-in-chief|CINCs]]" but as "combatant commanders" when applied to "unified" regional organizations (e.g., USCENTCOM), or "commander" when talking about "specified" units such as the U.S. Strategic Command ([[USSTRATCOM]]). Rumsfeld said the term "CINC" was inappropriate, notwithstanding its employment for many decades, because under the United States Constitution, the President is the Nation's only [[commander-in-chief]]. His decision was described as intending to clarify and strengthen the [[Civilian control of the military|military's subordination to civilian government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Garamone|first=Jim|url= http://archive.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=42568|title='CINC' Is Sunk|work=defenselink.mil|publisher=[[American Forces Press Service]]|date=2002-10-25|accessdate=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 10, 2015, Senator [[John McCain]] announced at a hearing of the [[Senate Armed Services Committee]], the beginning of a new effort to "reconsider, and possibly update" Goldwater–Nichols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armed-services.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/15-85%20-%2011-10-15.pdf|title=Hearing to Receive Testimony on 30 Years of Goldwater-Nichols Reform|publisher=Alderson Reporting Company|date=2015-11-10|accessdate=2016-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 4, 2016, the [[Deputy Secretary of Defense]] issued a memorandum directing an internal review with the objective "to make recommendations for updates or adjustments to organizational relationships and authorities" based on 30 years of experience under Goldwater–Nichols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidedefense.com//sites/insidedefense.com/files/documents/jan2016/01112016_dcmo.pdf|title=Review of the Organization and Responsibilities of the DoD|publisher=Inside Defense|date=2016-01-04|accessdate=2016-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 5, 2016, Defense Secretary [[Ash Carter]] outlined reforms in a speech at the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]].&lt;ref&gt;http://csis.org/files/attachments/160405_breaking_new_ground.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2006 Lebanon War]], a number of '''international incidents''' occurred in Lebanon, largely involving [[United Nations]] personnel in [[Lebanon]], who have come under a number of attacks. On 25 July 2006, four unarmed [[United Nations Truce Supervision Organization]] (UNTSO) peacekeepers were killed during an Israeli air strike on a UN observation post in southern Lebanon. Israel motivated the attack as wrong identification of target as a militant enemy post.

==UN operations in Lebanon==

The [[United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon]], or UNIFIL, was created by the [[United Nations]], by [[UN Security Council|Security Council]] [[UN Security Council Resolution|Resolution]] [[UN Security Council Resolution 425|425]] and [[UN Security Council Resolution 426|426]] on 19 March 1978. UNIFIL objective was to confirm [[Israel]]i withdrawal from [[Lebanon]], to restore international peace and security, and to help the Lebanese Government restore effective authority in the area.&lt;ref name="UNSup5"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; The first UNIFIL troops to arrive in the area on 23 March 1978 were reassigned from other UN [[peacekeeping]] operations in the area (namely [[United Nations Emergency Force|UNEF]] and [[UNDOF]]).&lt;ref name = "UNSup5" /&gt;

During the [[1982 Lebanon War]], U.N. positions were overrun, primarily by the [[South Lebanon Army]] forces under Major [[Saad Haddad]]. These were the indigenous Lebanese forces supported by the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]].&lt;ref name="UNsup6"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; During the occupation, UNIFIL's function was mainly to provide humanitarian aid.&lt;ref name = "UNsup6" /&gt; In 1999, Israel undertook a full withdrawal, which concluded in 2000 and enabled UNIFIL to resume its military tasks. The [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] has extended UNIFIL's mandate until August 31, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

UNIFIL's function was mainly the provision of food and aid to locals in Southern Lebanon. In 1999, Israel undertook a full withdrawal, which concluded in 2000 and enabled UNIFIL to resume its military tasks. At Lebanon' request, in January 2006 the UN extended UNIFIL's mandate to expire 31 July 2006.

===Attack===
On 25 July 2006 four unarmed [[United Nations Truce Supervision Organization]] (UNTSO) peacekeepers from Austria, China, Finland and Canada were killed in an Israeli air strike at a UN observation post in southern Lebanon. According to the UN, the four had taken shelter in a bunker under the post, which was a three story building inside a patrol base in [[Khiyam]].&lt;ref name="unifilJuly26"&gt;{{cite press release

&lt;/ref&gt; The area had been struck by artillery and aerial bombardment over a period of 6 hours. According to the IDF, Hezbollah artillery had been firing at Israeli positions from the area. According to a UN official who had seen the preliminary report, the post called an Israeli liaison officer ten times to call off the bombardment and an Israeli official promised to halt the bombing each time.&lt;ref name = "Haaretz 727"&gt;{{cite web

===Responses===
[[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]] initially stated that he was "…shocked and deeply distressed by the apparently deliberate targeting by Israeli Defence Forces."&lt;ref name ="BBC726"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; "This coordinated artillery and aerial attack on a long-established and clearly marked U.N. post at Khiyam occurred despite personal assurances given to me by Prime Minister Ehud Olmert that U.N. positions would be spared Israeli fire," he said in a statement. "Furthermore, General [[Alain Pellegrini]], the U.N. force commander in south Lebanon, had been in repeated contact with Israeli officers throughout the day, stressing the need to protect that particular U.N. position from attack."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/07/26/mideast.observers/index.html  U.N.: Observers made many calls before strike]," ''[[CNN]]'', July 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ayalon, Israeli ambassador to the United States called Annan's statement "outrageous," while Israel's U.N. ambassador, [[Dan Gillerman]], said he, too, was "deeply distressed" that Annan alleged that the strike was deliberate. "I am surprised at these premature and erroneous assertions made by the secretary-general, who while demanding an investigation, has already issued its conclusions," Gillerman said in a statement.&lt;ref name=CNN-07-25/&gt; However, as at the time Annan had only circumstantial evidence for the bombing being deliberate, many pundits described Annan’s statement as indicative of the UN's anti-Israel bias.&lt;ref name="nydailynews.com"&gt;{{cite news

An Israeli senior commander stated that Hezbollah forces fired rockets from as little as 30-40m from UNIFIL bases, seeking to avoid Israeli counter-fire, and had sought refuge in UNIFIL bases on occasion. UNIFIL maintained that Hezbollah fighters were not allowed into any of its bases. However, they reported more than 20 instances of rockets being fired from less than 500m from their positions, as well as a number of cases of small arms and mortar fire from within 100m. Additionally, UNIFIL reported several instances of their positions and vehicles being hit by Hezbollah mortars, small arms fire, or rockets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde02/033/2006/en/ Israel/Lebanon: Out of all proportion - civilians bear the brunt of the war | Amnesty International&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] &lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 July 2006, Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Olmert]] phoned Kofi Annan and expressed his deep regret over the death of the four UN observers. He promised that Israel would thoroughly investigate the incident and would share the findings with Annan, but said that he was taken aback by secretary general’s statement saying that the Israeli attack on the UN post was “apparently deliberate”.&lt;ref name = "ynet"&gt;{{cite web|date=2006-07-27|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3281510,00.html|title=PM apologizes for UN observers' death, criticizes Annan|publisher=ynetnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Israeli ambassador to the UN, [[Dan Gillerman]], ruled out major U.N. involvement in any potential international force in Lebanon, saying that more professional and better-trained troops were needed for such a volatile situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

At a press conference the next day, Annan seemed to soften his stance and clarified that "[t]he statement said 'apparently deliberate targeting,'" stressing that the word "apparent is important in this."

Canada’s Prime Minister, [[Stephen Harper]], said he does not believe Israel targeted the post, and pointed to the fact that Israel has been “co-operating with us in our evacuation efforts, in our efforts to move Canadian citizens out of Lebanon, and also trying to keep our own troops that are on the ground involved in the evacuation out of harm's way.”&lt;ref name = "CBC726"&gt;{{cite web

However, Ireland’s Foreign Minister Dermot Ahern and its Defence Minister [[Willie O'Dea]] were angered because Irish peace keeping troops had been on duty in the observation post 24 hours before the strike. They also said that a senior Irish soldier working for the UN forces was in contact with the Israeli Defence Force's UNIFIL liaison office six times to warn them that their bombardment was endangering the lives of UN staff. Both Ministers called in the Israeli Ambassador to Ireland to express their anger and dissatisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The worst of these came on 25 July 2006, when four unarmed [[UNTSO]] peacekeepers from Austria, China, Finland and Canada were killed in an Israeli air strike on a UN observation post in southern Lebanon.

==Israeli flyovers==
In the aftermath of the war, aircraft of the [[Israeli Air Force]] began fly over Lebanon. In September 2006, Major General [[Alain Pellegrini]] of France, commander of UNIFIL, warned that the flyovers violated the cease-fire, and that force might be used to stop the incursions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/785914.html&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2006, a number of incidents between the Israeli Air Force and UN peacekeepers took place:

* On 3 October 2006, an Israeli fighter jet penetrated the {{convert|2|nmi|km|adj=on}} defence perimeter of the French frigate ''Courbet'', triggering a diplomatic incident between Israel and France. Israel apologized after official protests from France.
* On 24 October 2006, six Israeli fighter jets flew over a German vessel patrolling off Israel's coast just south of Lebanon, after a helicopter took off from the vessel without Israeli permission. The German Defense Ministry claimed that the planes fired flares, and one fired two shots into the air. Israeli officials denied the claim of two shots being fired, but claimed they did not know whether flares had been used.
* On 31 October 2006, eight Israeli [[F-15 Eagle|F-15]] fighter jets flew over many areas of Lebanon, including [[Beirut]]. The jets also nose-dived over a French peacekeeping position in what was interpreted as attack formation. French troops responded by readying an anti-aircraft missile. According to French Defence Minister [[Michele Alliot-Marie]], the troops were "seconds away" from firing the missile at the jets.

{{Intersex sidebar}}
[[Intersex]] people in the [[United States]] have some of the same rights as other people, but with significant gaps, particularly in protection from non-consensual cosmetic medical interventions and violence, and protection from discrimination. Actions by intersex civil society organizations aim to eliminate harmful practices, promote social acceptance, and equality. In recent years, intersex activists have also secured some forms of legal recognition.

==History==
{{further|Intersex in history}}
Early accounts of intersex people in North America include those of English immigrant [[Thomas(ine) Hall]], in 17th-century [[Colony of Virginia|colonial Virginia]] and 19th-century [[Connecticut]] intersex man [[Levi Suydam]], pronounced male and so eligible to vote. Early [[common law]], like [[canon law]],&lt;ref name="Raming"&gt;{{cite book | title = A History of Women and Ordination | last1 = Raming | first1 = Ida | last2 = Macy | first2 = Gary | last3 = Bernard J | first3 = Cook | publisher = [[Scarecrow Press]] | date = 2004 | page = 113}}&lt;/ref&gt; held that hermaphrodites were to be treated as male or female depending on the prevailing sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 41| last = Greenberg| first = Julie| title = Defining Male and Female: Intersexuality and the Collision Between Law and Biology| journal = Arizona Law Review| date = 1999| ssrn = 896307|pages =  277–278}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Coke|E Coke]], The First Part of the Institutes of the Laws of England, Institutes 8.a. (1st Am. Ed. 1812).&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, an intersex and [[Nonbinary|non-binary]] student, [[Scout Schultz]] was shot dead at the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]]. In November 2017, Betsy Driver became the first intersex person openly elected to public office in the United States. Driver was elected as a council person in the New Jersey city of Flemington. Driver is the second publicly intersex person elected to office, following [[Tony Briffa]] in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Lang| first = Nico| title = Betsy Driver Is Ready for America's Intersex Tipping Point| work = INTO| accessdate = 2018-09-05| date = December 7, 2017| url = https://intomore.com/impact/Betsy-Driver-Is-Ready-for-Americas-Intersex-Tipping-Point/f061b1e09eed44f4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intersex medical interventions===
Since the mid-twentieth century, U.S. physicians have considered intersex status in infants a "psychosocial emergency" and performed "normalizing" or "reconstructive" genital surgery without considering non-surgical alternatives (e.g., counseling).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chase|first=Cheryl|date=2002|title='Cultural Practice' or 'Reconstructive Surgery'? U.S. Genital Cutting, the Intersex Movement, and Medical Double Standards|url=|journal=Genital Cutting and Transnational Sisterhood|volume=126|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When deciding whether to assign the intersex infant "male" or "female," the factors typically considered are potential for [[fertility]] and [[sexual penetration]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These surgeries still continue in the U.S. today despite being medically unnecessary (that is, chiefly cosmetic) and potentially injurious to the patient's sexual pleasure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/07/25/i-want-be-nature-made-me/medically-unnecessary-surgeries-intersex-children-us|title="I Want to Be Like Nature Made Me" {{!}} Medically Unnecessary Surgeries on Intersex Children in the US|date=2017-07-25|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The intersex movement===
The U.S. intersex movement developed in the 1990s and 2000s, through the establishment of the [[Intersex Society of North America]] (ISNA) and the [[Androgen insensitivity syndrome|AIS]] Support Group USA (now called AISDSD)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://aisdsd.org/who-we-are/history/brief-history/ | title = A Brief History | work = AISDSD | accessdate = 2017-01-15 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150427122155/http://aisdsd.org/who-we-are/history/brief-history/ | archivedate = 2015-04-27 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1990s, and Advocates for Informed Choice (now [[Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth|interACT]]), Bodies Like Ours,&lt;ref name="karkazis2008"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Duke University Press| isbn = 978-0-8223-4318-9| last = Karkazis| first = Katrina| title = [[Fixing Sex|Fixing Sex: Intersex, Medical Authority, and Lived Experience]]| date = 2008 | page = 260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intersex Initiative,&lt;ref name="karkazis2008" /&gt; and [[Organisation Intersex International]],&lt;ref name="karkazis2008" /&gt; (now the [[Intersex Campaign for Equality]]) in the following decade.

The [[Intersex Society of North America]] (ISNA) was a non-profit advocacy group founded in 1993 by [[Cheryl Chase (activist)|Cheryl Chase]] to end shame, secrecy, and unwanted genital surgeries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aissg.org/articles/HOLMES.HTM Re-membering a Queer Body] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511182712/http://www.aissg.org/articles/HOLMES.HTM |date=2013-05-11 }}, AISSG, syndicated copy of article from Undercurrents (May 1994: 11-13) by the Faculty of Environmental Studies, York University, Ontario.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pi.library.yorku.ca/ojs/index.php/currents/article/view/37695/34194 Re-membering a Queer Body] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230235845/http://pi.library.yorku.ca/ojs/index.php/currents/article/view/37695/34194 |date=2013-12-30 }}, UnderCurrents (May 1994: 11-13), Faculty of Environmental Studies, York University, Ontario.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="matthews2000"&gt;Matthews, Karen (Oct 22, 2000).

Intersex activism between the late 1990s and mid 2000s led from demonstrating outside a national pediatric conference, to speaking inside clinical conferences, and the first human rights investigation into medical "normalization", by the Human Rights Commission of the City and County of San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Human Rights Commission of the City and County of San Francisco| last2 = de María Arana| first2 = Marcus| title = A Human Rights Investigation Into The Medical "Normalization" Of Intersex People| location = San Francisco| date = 2005| url = http://www.aph.gov.au/DocumentStore.ashx?id=2bbf04f0-66c8-4dd9-9c20-2cdb1c936f79| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131228070803/http://www.aph.gov.au/DocumentStore.ashx?id=2bbf04f0-66c8-4dd9-9c20-2cdb1c936f79| archivedate = 2013-12-28| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, coercive [[intersex medical interventions]] persist.&lt;ref name="interact2016un" /&gt;

ISNA closed in June 2008 after supporting the creation of a new clinical term for intersex conditions, [[Disorders of Sex Development]] (DSD), albeit ambivalently as a means of opening "many more doors" and engaging with clinicians,&lt;ref name="ISNADSD"&gt;{{cite web | work = [[Intersex Society of North America]] | date = 24 May 2006 | url = http://www.isna.org/node/1066 | title = Why is ISNA using "DSD"? | accessdate = 4 June 2006 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060617190952/http://www.isna.org/node/1066 | archivedate = 17 June 2006 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and also supporting the establishment of a new organization, the [[Accord Alliance]], set up to promote comprehensive and integrated approaches to healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.accordalliance.org/ | title = Welcome to Accord Alliance | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100721234219/http://www.accordalliance.org/ | archivedate = 2010-07-21 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; New organizations such as [[Intersex Campaign for Equality]] and [[Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth|interACT]] were since established with civil and human rights goals.

=== Demonstration and American Academy of Pediatrics statement ===
In October 1996, the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] issued a press statement stating that:

{{quote|
* The Academy is deeply concerned about the emotional, cognitive, and body image development of intersexuals, and believes that successful early genital surgery minimizes these issues.
* Research on children with ambiguous genitalia has shown that a person's sexual body image is largely a function of socialization, and children whose genetic sexes are not clearly reflected in external genitalia can be raised successfully as members of either sexes if the process begins before 2 1/2 years.
* Management and understanding of intersex conditions has significantly improved, particularly over the last several decades ...&lt;ref name="aap1996"&gt;{{Cite web| last = American Academy of Pediatrics| author-link = American Academy of Pediatrics| title = American Academy of Pediatrics Position on Intersexuality| work = [[Intersex Day]]| accessdate = 2017-07-03| date = October 1996| url = http://intersexday.org/en/aap-position-1996/| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160119031644/http://intersexday.org/en/aap-position-1996/| archivedate = 2016-01-19| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The statement was issued in response to the first public demonstration by intersex people and allies, outside the annual conference of the Academy, in Boston on October 26, 1996. [[Morgan Holmes]] has written that the demonstration happened after activists [[Max Beck]] and Holmes were excluded from the conference. She states that the pair went to deliver an address, "on long-term outcomes and to challenging their still-prevailing opinion that cosmetic surgery to "fix" intersexed genitals was the best course of action", but were "met, officially, with hostility and were escorted out of the conference by security guards".&lt;ref name="holmes2006"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = University of Minnesota Press| pages = 32–50| last = Holmes| first = Morgan| authorlink = Morgan Holmes |title = Transgender Rights| chapter = Deciding fate or protecting a developing autonomy?

The statement reflected on the history of such interventions, their rationales and outcomes, stating:

{{quote|When an individual is born with atypical genitalia that pose no physical risk, treatment should focus not on surgical intervention but on psychosocial and educational support for the family and child. Cosmetic genitoplasty should be deferred until children are old enough to voice their own view about whether to undergo the surgery. Those whose oath or conscience says "do no harm" should heed the simple fact that, to date, research does not support the practice of cosmetic infant genitoplasty.}}

===Human Rights Watch/interACT report on U.S. children, 2017===
In July 2017, [[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth|interACT]] published a report on medically unnecessary surgeries on intersex children, "I Want to Be Like Nature Made Me", based on interviews with intersex persons, families and physicians.&lt;ref name="hrw2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hrw2017b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="stewart2017" /&gt; The report states that:

{{quote|Intersex people in the United States are subjected to medical practices that can inflict irreversible physical and psychological harm on them starting in infancy, harms that can last throughout their lives. Many of these procedures are done with the stated aim of making it easier for children to grow up "normal" and integrate more easily into society by helping them conform to a particular sex assignment. The results are often catastrophic, the supposed benefits are largely unproven, and there are generally no urgent health considerations at stake}}

The report found that [[intersex medical interventions]] persist as default advice from doctors to parents, despite some change in some regions of the U.S. and claims of improved surgical techniques, resulting in an uneven situation where care differs and a lack of standards of care, but paradigms for care are still based on socio-cultural factors including expectations of "normality" and evidence in support of surgeries remains lacking. "Nearly every parent" in the study reported pressure for their children to undergo surgery, and many reported misinformation. The report calls for a ban on "surgical procedures that seek to alter the gonads, genitals, or internal sex organs of children with atypical sex characteristics too young to participate in the decision, when those procedures both carry a meaningful risk of harm and can be safely deferred."&lt;ref name="hrw2017"&gt;{{Cite book| isbn = 978-1-62313-502-7| last1 = Human Rights Watch| author1-link = Human Rights Watch| last2 = interACT| author2-link = Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth| title = "I Want to Be Like Nature Made Me"| date = July 2017| url = https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/07/25/i-want-be-nature-made-me/medically-unnecessary-surgeries-intersex-children-us| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171005133541/https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/07/25/i-want-be-nature-made-me/medically-unnecessary-surgeries-intersex-children-us| archivedate = 2017-10-05| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stewart2017"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Stewart| first = Philippa| title = Interview: Intersex Babies Don't Need 'Fixing'| work = Human Rights Watch| accessdate = 2017-07-25| date = 2017-07-25| url = https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/07/25/interview-intersex-babies-dont-need-fixing| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170803222257/https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/07/25/interview-intersex-babies-dont-need-fixing| archivedate = 2017-08-03| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hrw2017b"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Human Rights Watch| title = US: Harmful Surgery on Intersex Children| work = Human Rights Watch| accessdate = 2017-07-25| date = 2017-07-25| url = https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/07/25/us-harmful-surgery-intersex-children| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170803222338/https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/07/25/us-harmful-surgery-intersex-children| archivedate = 2017-08-03| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Responses to developments===

In a 2017 interview for Harper's Magazine, Laurence Baskin, chief of pediatric urology at University of California, San Francisco, told journalist Sarah Topol "that he would recommend early surgery not just for [[5-alpha-reductase deficiency|5-alpha]] but for 95 percent of known D.S.D. conditions ... Baskin classifies such operations as corrective surgeries, no different from fixing a cleft palate or clubfoot.

The defendants sought to dismiss the case and seek a defense of qualified immunity, but these were denied by the District Court for the District of South Carolina. In January 2015, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed this decision and dismissed the complaint, stating that, "it did not "mean to diminish the severe harm that M.C. claims to have suffered" but that a reasonable official in 2006 did not have fair warning from then-existing precedent that performing sex assignment surgery on sixteen-month-old M.C. violated a clearly established constitutional right."&lt;ref name="largent2015"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blogs.harvard.edu/billofhealth/2015/03/05/m-c-v-aaronson-update/ | title = M.C. v.

In May 2016, the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] issued a statement explaining Section 1557 of the [[Affordable Care Act]] stating that the Act prohibits "discrimination on the basis of intersex traits or atypical sex characteristics" in publicly-funded healthcare, as part of a prohibition of discrimination "on the basis of sex".&lt;ref name="interacthealth"&gt;{{cite web| last = [[Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth|interACT]]| title = Federal Government Bans Discrimination Against Intersex People in Health Care| work = interactadvocates| accessdate = 2016-05-27| url = http://interactadvocates.org/federal-government-bans-discrimination-against-intersex-people-in-health-care/| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160528104341/http://interactadvocates.org/federal-government-bans-discrimination-against-intersex-people-in-health-care/| archivedate = 2016-05-28| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ocr"&gt;{{cite web| last = Office for Civil Rights (OCR)| title = Section 1557 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act| work = HHS.gov| format = Text| accessdate = 2016-05-27| date = 2016| url = https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/section-1557/index.html| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160529015028/http://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/section-1557/index.html| archivedate = 2016-05-29| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, interACT submitted an [[amicus curiae]] in the matter of Gavin Grimm (G.G. v. Gloucester County School Board) regarding protections in education for issues of [[gender identity under Title IX]]. The submission stated that the Gloucester County School Board held a "simplistic view of "physiological" sex [that] is demonstrably inaccurate as a matter of human biology. Moreover, it demeans many thousands of intersex youth by erasing their bodies and lives and placing them outside the recognition of the law".&lt;ref name="interact2017gg"&gt;{{Cite| last = interACT| title = Brief of interACT: Advocates for Intersex Youth, et al., as Amici Curiae in support of respondent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1660">An '''Island Commander''' is an official who is put in charge of an island, or an insular entity called after an island or an archipelago called Islands.

The United States have used the title for several of their overseas insular possessions, considered too small to have a higher official such as a (Lieutenant) [[Governor]] :

; Presently :
* [[Wake Island]] since July 4, 1898 till present

; Formerly :
* Two of the three islands that previously had been under the two consecutive heads of the [[American Equatorial Islands Colonization Project]], 1935 - February 7, 1942 ([[Jarvis Island]] only had an international [[Station Chief]] afterwards):
** [[Baker Island]]: September 1943 - May 1944 (incumbents unknown); September 1943 - May 1944 while occupied by U.S. military forces (Baker Naval Air Station). Since June 27, 1974 it is administered by the [[U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service]] as Baker Island National Wildlife Refuge. 
** [[Johnston Atoll]]: 1934–2003; on January 1, 2004, the island was turned over to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as Johnston Atoll Wildlife Refuge
* [[Midway Islands]] June 1940 – October 31, 1996; since administered by the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service as Midway Island National Wildlife Refuge
* [[Palmyra Atoll]] November 1939 - 1947 while occupied by U.S. military forces. Since August 15, 1941 it harbored the Palmyra U.S. Naval Air Station, now [[Palmyra (Cooper) Airport]].

{{Communism sidebar}}
The '''Jam Saqi trial''' (or '''Jam Saqi case'''), was a political and judicial program in the [[History of Pakistan|history]] of Pakistan marked by a rise of widespread fear of expansion of [[Soviet communism|communism]] and the [[Socialism in Pakistan|socialism]].&lt;ref name="Cambridge University Press"&gt;{{cite book|last=Newberg|first=Paula R.|title=Judging the state : courts and constitutional politics in Pakistan|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0521894409|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PbSeGQO3xdsC&amp;pg=PA152 |edition=1st paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eickelman|first=ed. by Dale F.|title=Russia's Muslim frontiers : new directions in cross-cultural analysis|year=1993|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|isbn=0253208238}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There were series of federal investigations led by the [[Federal Investigation Agency|FIA]] and federal prosecution trials conducted by the specialized [[Judge Advocate General Branch (Pakistan)|military courts]] in which the leaders of the [[Pakistan Communist Party|communist]] and [[Pakistan Peoples Party|socialist]] parties were accused of plotting to overthrow the [[Zia regime|military government]] in order to install a [[Movement for the Restoration of Democracy|socialist system]].&lt;ref name="The Himal"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mujtaba|first=Hasan|title=This believer was a communist|url=http://www.himalmag.com/component/content/article/2331-This-believer-was-a-communist.html|work=1999 Publications|publisher=''The Himal''|accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, thousands of Pakistani political workers and dissidents were accused of being communists, and hatching a plot against the [[Operation Fair Play|martial law]] which was in effect since 1977. The first trial implicated in 1980 and all trials were conducted at the special sessions held at the [[Karachi Central Jail]].&lt;ref name="Pakistan Association for Mental Health"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nomani|first=Javed|title=Behind bars|year=1993|publisher=Pakistan Association for Mental Health|location=Karachi, Pakistan|isbn=9698224009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primarily, the leaders of the [[Pakistan Communist Party|communist party]] were convicted whilst [[Pakistan Peoples Party|socialists]] were acquitted from the trial in the mid 1980s.&lt;ref name="The Marxist"&gt;{{cite news|title=Interview with Jam Saqi|url=http://www.marxist.com/veteran-pakistan-communist-jam-saqi040407.htm|accessdate=22 November 2013|newspaper=The Marxist|date=3 April 2007|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==

===Communism and struggle===
{{Main|Rawalpindi Conspiracy case|Peshawar Conspiracy Cases}}

The historical judicial period that has come to be known as "Jam Saqi case" began well before the trial was launched in the 1980s. Many factors contributed to this inquiry, some of them extending back to the year 1950 with  the [[Rawalpindi Conspiracy case|first case]], further amplified by [[Communism in Pakistan|Communism]]'s emergence as a recognized [[Politics of Pakistan|political force]]. After the [[Pakistani general elections, 1977|general elections]] held in 1977, the [[Pakistan Military|military]] imposed [[1977 Pakistani coup d'état|martial law]] throughout the land to ease the social unrest in the country. The [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] (PPP), [[Communist Party of Pakistan|Communist Party]] of Pakistan (CPP), and other leftist political parties condemned the act.&lt;ref name="The Himal" /&gt;  Unofficially, the [[Pakistan Peoples Party|PPP]] government destroyed the ban on the [[Communist Party of Pakistan|CPP]]; as a result, the presence of communist literature in Pakistan became stronger.&lt;ref name="The Marxist" /&gt;

On the other hand, the right-wing groups further consolidated in opposition to the [[Socialism in Pakistan|socialist influence]] in the country. The extremism on both sides grew as did support for a statutory prohibition of such activities in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=Lexington&gt;{{cite book|last=Saha|first=ed. by Santosh C.|title=Religious fundamentalism in the contemporary world : critical social and political issues|year=2004|publisher=Lexington|location=Lanham, Md. [u.a.]|isbn=0739107607|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HeXPlopNwp0C&amp;pg=PA306&amp;lpg=PA306&amp;dq=jam+saqi+case&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=64Dv_rHqW4&amp;sig=2olpK2j-12-Q3W46hrOGODrb838&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=U-qOUum6O8_PigLbs4GICA&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwATge#v=onepage&amp;q=jam%20saqi%20case&amp;f=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Soviet Union|USSR]]'s [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan|invasion]] of [[Afghanistan]] gave [[President of Pakistan|President]] [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] an opportunity to legitimatize his regime in the country with the [[United States|Western]] support.

In 1978, the [[Federal Investigation Agency|FIA]] arrested [[Communist Party of Pakistan|communist leader]], [[Jam Saqi]], and raided two houses in [[Karachi]].&lt;ref name="S.K. Shahab Publications"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaikh|first=Faraz|title=Pakistan Illustrated|year=2005|volume= 15|issue= 7-8|publisher=S.K. Shahab Publications|id=XloTAQAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Saqi was booked for a [[trial]] set up by the [[Zia regime|military government]] in 1980 . In addition, the [[Federal Investigation Agency|FIA]] [[Director General of the Federal Investigation Agency|director]] [[Muhammad Azam Qazi|Azam Qazi]] ordered his agents to begin gathering information on the leftist groups uniting under a [[Movement for the Restoration of Democracy|common platform]]; all were [[acquitted]] in the trial by the federal prosecutors. This marked the second case against the [[Communist Party of Pakistan]]; the first was the [[Rawalpindi Conspiracy case]] instituted in the 1950s.

Under this program, a few of the more notable people who were blacklisted or suffered some other persecution are listed here:

*[[Jam Saqi]]— [[Secretary-General]] of the [[Communist Party of Pakistan]] (CPP)
*[[Benazir Bhutto]]&lt;ref name="Independent archives"&gt;{{cite web|title=Benazir Bhutto appears before a military court in Jam Saqi case in Karachi March 26, 1983|url=http://jamat.pakphotos.net/details.php?image_id=461&amp;mode=search&amp;sessionid=0cf5f926e4caa82c8749f36af7b7b081|work=March 26, 1983|publisher=Independent archives|accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; — Chairperson of the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]]
*[[Khan Abdul Wali Khan|Abdul Wali]]— President of [[Awami National Party]] (ANP)
*[[Ghaus Bakhsh Bizenjo|Ghaus Bux Bizenjo]]— Intellectual and politician
*[[Sohail Sangi]]— Journalist
*[[Meraj Muhammad Khan|Mirage M. Khan]]&lt;ref name="Zahid Hussain archives"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hussain|first=Zahid|title=Mairaj Mohammad Khan and Police|url=http://w.pakphotos.com/details.php?image_id=9257&amp;mode=search&amp;sessionid=9647c4e3f4c0c20e676b42aa90660370|publisher=Zahid Hussain archives|accessdate=24 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; — Communist activist of the [[Pakistan Peoples Party|PPP]]
*[[Nazeer Abbasi]]— Communist activist of the [[Communist Party of Pakistan|CPP]]
*[[Kamal Warsi]]— Journalist

Primarily, the investigations and inquiry focused on the [[Communist Party of Pakistan|Communist Party]]'s [[Secretary-General]], [[Jam Saqi]]. Although, the inquiries were expanded to the [[Socialism in Pakistan|left-wing parties]] of the country, whereas [[Benazir Bhutto]] repeatedly appeared in the [[Judge Advocate General Branch (Pakistan)|military courts]] sessions led by [[Colonel]] Atiq Hussain.&lt;ref name="Saqi Trial to Benazir"&gt;{{cite web|title=Saqi Trial to Benazir|url=http://www.pakphotos.com/search.php?search_keywords=1983&amp;sessionid=01eb5ab999a8791feac2f456f7be8e0b|publisher=Photos archives of 1980s|accessdate=24 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was inquired from 27 March until 29 March 1983, after being cleared by Colonel Atiq.&lt;ref name="PPP USA"&gt;{{cite web|last=PPP USA|title=PPP: Socialism to Communism|url=http://www.pppusa.org/chronology.htm|publisher=PPP USA|accessdate=24 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028154335/http://www.pppusa.org/chronology.htm|archivedate=28 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one point, [[Benazir Bhutto]], in the defense of Saqi, declared that "she did not accept the military courts."&lt;ref name="Dawn news archives, 2009"/&gt; She further testified that "Jam Saqi is a patriotic citizen of the state" and demanded his release.&lt;ref name="Dawn news archives, 2009"&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff reporter|title=Jam Saqi gets lifetime achievement award|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/944618/jam-saqi-gets-lifetime-achievement-award|accessdate=24 November 2013|newspaper=Dawn news archives, 2009|date=May 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other accuses were [[Karachi University]]'s professor Jamal Naqvi, Amar Lal, journalists [[Sohail Sangi]], [[Badar Abro]], [[Kamal Warsi]] and Shabbir Shar. Jam Saqi was arrested on 10 December 1978 but was implicated in this case which was lodged about two years later. Naqvi, Abbasi, Warsi and Shar were arrested on 30 July 1980, while Sangi was arrested on 31 July 1980.

==Participants==
*'''Defense witnesses:''' Top political leadership including Ms [[Benazir Bhutto]], Mir [[Ghaus Bux Bezinjo]], [[Khan Abdul Wali Khan]], [[Maulana Shah Mohammed Amroti]], [[Mairaj Mohammed Khan]], [[Fatehyab Ali Khan]], among the journalists [[Minhaj Burna]], [[Afzal Siddiqui]], [[Shaikh Ali Mohammed]], [[Shaikh Aziz]], [[Abdullah. J Memon]] then commissioner, Abdul Ghani Dars (Journalist) and others appeared as defense witnesses.
*'''Defense Counsels:''' The defense counsels were [[Abdul Wadood]], [[Mohammed Yousuf Leghari]], [[Akhtar Hussain (lawyer)|Akhtar Hussain]], [[Ali Amjad Advocate]] and [[Shafi Mohammedi]].

'''Living Liberally''' is the general name for a multifaceted, grassroots progressive community-building movement started in New York City in 2003. The inception of [[Drinking Liberally]] and its parent organization, until 2008 known as '''Cosmopolity''', united a growing progressive social network under one name. According to the website, Living Liberally's goal is "providing easy entrance into progressive involvement, using social interaction to promote political action and facilitating collaboration among progressive organizations."&lt;ref&gt;[http://cosmopolity.org/calendar/bin/about ''Cosmopolity.org''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222002910/http://cosmopolity.org/calendar/bin/about |date=2007-12-22 }} "About Us"&lt;/ref&gt; Current Living Liberally projects include Drinking Liberally, [[Laughing Liberally]], [[Screening Liberally]], [[Reading Liberally]], and [[Eating Liberally]]. The majority of Living Liberally projects are organized by volunteers rather than the national organizers. Living Liberally was founded by [[David Alpert]], [[Katrina Baker]], [[Matthew O'Neill (filmmaker)|Matthew O'Neill]], and [[Justin Krebs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://livingliberally.org/living/about ''Living Liberally''] "About"&lt;/ref&gt;

In April, 2007, the 200th chapter of Drinking Liberally was created in [[Pagosa Springs, Colorado]].&lt;ref name="Bowers_Apr-07"&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-bowers/drinking-liberally-reache_b_46106.html "Drinking Liberally Reaches 200"] ''The Huffington Post'' April 17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''One Australia''''' was the [[Immigration to Australia|immigration]] and ethnic affairs [[policy]] of the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]]-[[National Party of Australia|National]] [[Opposition (Australia)|Opposition]] in Australia, released in 1988. The One Australia policy proclaimed a vision of "one nation and one future". It called for an end to [[multiculturalism]] and opposed a treaty with [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal Australians]].

The policy set the scene for the August 1988 suggestion by [[List of Australian Leaders of the Opposition|Leader of the Opposition]] [[John Howard]] that the rate of Asian immigration to Australia be reduced.

==History==
[[File:Howard2.JPG|thumbnail|[[John Howard]], Australian Prime Minister 1996–2007]]
Howard first flagged the concept of the ''One Australia'' policy on a trip to [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] in July 1988, having recently returned from a visit with [[Margaret Thatcher]] in Britain. ''One Australia'' was to be the name of the Liberal-National [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition's]] immigration and ethnic affairs policy.&lt;ref name="God_Under_Howard"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Maddox |first=Marion |authorlink=Marion Maddox |title=God Under Howard: The Rise of the Religious Right in Australian Politics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=or-BD19vOIAC&amp;printsec=frontcover |accessdate=2008-03-03 |year=2005 |publisher=[[Allen &amp; Unwin]] |isbn=1-74114-568-6 |pages=112–114 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During an interview on the [[John Laws]] radio programme on 1 August 1988, Howard detailed the policy, expressing his preference to bias immigration towards skilled applicants rather than family reunion.&lt;ref name="Jupp"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Later that afternoon, on the [[PM (ABC Radio)|ABC PM]] programme, Howard discussed the policy in relation to Asian immigration to Australia:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I do believe that if it is – in the eyes of some in the community – that it's too great, it would be in our immediate-term interest and supporting of social cohesion if it were slowed down a little, so the capacity of the community to absorb it was greater.&lt;ref name=markus85/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/archive/news/asian-influence-spices-up-contest/news-story/97b8077825a4a8c15a9fa2127a6207e4|title=Asian influence spices up contest|last=|first=|date=27 February 2007|work=[[The Australian]]|access-date=10 December 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Howard's Shadow Finance Minister, [[John Stone (Australian politician)|John Stone]], elaborated, saying that "Asian immigration has to be slowed. It's no use dancing around the bushes".&lt;ref name="Borderline"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ian Sinclair]], National Party leader in the Coalition, also supported the policy, saying: &lt;blockquote&gt;"What we are saying is that if there is any risk of an undue build-up of Asians as against others in the community, then you need to control it ... I certainly believe, that at the moment we need ... to reduce the number of Asians ... We don't want the divisions of South Africa, we don't want the divisions of London. We really don't want the colour divisions of the United States."

&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There were widespread objections to the policy from within the Liberal Party, including from [[Premier of Victoria|Victorian Premier]] [[Jeff Kennett]], [[Premier of New South Wales|New South Wales Premier]] [[Nick Greiner]], former Prime Minister [[Malcolm Fraser]], and former [[Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs|immigration ministers]] [[Ian Macphee]] and [[Michael MacKellar]].&lt;ref name="Borderline"/&gt;

The [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government sought to quickly exploit Howard's Asian remarks by introducing a [[Parliament of Australia|parliamentary]] [[Motion (democracy)|motion]] rejecting the use of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] to select immigrants. Howard opposed this motion.&lt;ref name="Hawke_Motion"&gt;

Criticising his own party's policy, Steele Hall said in a speech to Parliament:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The question has quickly descended from a discussion about the future migrant intake to one about the level of internal racial tolerance. The simple fact is that public opinion is easily led on racial issues. It is now time to unite the community on the race issue before it flares into an ugly reproach for us all.&lt;ref name="SMH_Lost_Art"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a speech to the "Terra Australis to Australia" conference in [[Canberra]], August 1988, Prime Minister [[Bob Hawke]] responded to the Opposition's One Australia policy:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the field of immigration and ethnic affairs, the "One Australia" ideology seems to connote a return to the dark days of narrow minded intolerance, fear of difference and pressure to assimilate. It is less about uniting Australians than dividing them.&lt;ref name="UNISA_Hawke"&gt;

''One Australia'' was officially launched by John Howard on 22 August 1988. The policy document, whose title was personally chosen by Howard, stated the Coalition's ideal to create "One Australia and welcome all those who share our vision and are ready to contribute to it", detailing a vision of "one nation and one future" which included the rejection of [[Aboriginal land rights in Australia|Aboriginal land rights]]. In September 1988, John Howard criticised multiculturalism, saying "To me, multiculturalism suggests that we can't make up our minds who we are or what we believe in", and the idea of an Aboriginal treaty, saying "I abhor the notion of an Aboriginal treaty because it is repugnant to the ideals of One Australia".&lt;ref name=markus85&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''One Australia'' became the centrepiece of Howard's general policy manifesto, "Future Directions – It's Time for Plain Thinking", which was released in December 1988.

In a January 1989 interview with [[Gerard Henderson]], Howard elaborated on his reasons for opposing multiculturalism:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The objection I have to multiculturalism is that multiculturalism is in effect saying that it is impossible to have an Australian ethos, that it is impossible to have a common Australian culture. So we have to pretend that we are a federation of cultures and that we've got a bit from every part of the world. I think that is hopeless.&lt;ref name=markus85/&gt;&lt;ref name="AGE_Relaxed"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Relaxed and comfortable |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/books/relaxed-and-comfortable/2005/09/08/1125772645170.html |publisher=''[[The Age]]'' |date=2005-09-10 |accessdate=2007-11-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the months following the release of the One Australia policy, there was a decline in investment in Australia by Asian businesses.&lt;ref name="Too_Soon"&gt;
{{Cite book|last=Morris |first=Meaghan |title=Too Soon Too Late: History in Popular Culture |origyear=1998 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=71qdOHngcTAC&amp;pg=RA1-PA306&amp;vq=%22one+australia%22&amp;dq=%22one+australia%22+howard |accessdate=2007-12-18 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=0-253-33395-4 |pages=306–307 |year=1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some political commentators later postulated that the dissent within the Liberal Party over immigration policy weakened Howard's leadership position, contributing to him being overthrown as Liberal Party leader by [[Andrew Peacock]].&lt;ref name="Kelly_457"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kelly |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Kelly (journalist) |title=The End of Certainty: Power, Politics, and Business in Australia |origyear=1994 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EKXBgmYeO2QC&amp;dq |accessdate=2007-10-05 |publisher=[[Allen &amp; Unwin]] |isbn=1-86373-757-X |pages=457 |year=1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Howard was in Government from 1996-2007 he increased immigration and increased multiculturalism.  from migration rate of 30,042 in 1992–93 to 158,630 in 2007.

==Commentary on the One Australia policy==
*In 1993, Liberal Party MP, [[Peter Costello]], dismissed the One Australia policy as just "a passing policy".&lt;ref name="Australian_Quarterly"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Costello |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Costello |date=September 1993 |title=The Liberal Party and its Future |journal=[[Australian Quarterly]] |volume=65 |issue=3 |pages=17 |url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/20635729?uid=3739256&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21103798593283 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2014-03-19 |doi=10.2307/20635729}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JCU_comfortable"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jcu.edu.au/aff/history/articles/brawley.htm |title=A Comfortable and Relaxed Past': John Howard and the 'Battle of History' |accessdate=2007-12-09 |last=Brawley |first=Sean |date=2007-04-27 |work=The Electronic Journal of Australian and New Zealand History |publisher=[[James Cook University]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding==
At its [[1964 Arab League summit (Cairo)|first summit meeting]] in Cairo in 1964, the Arab League initiated the creation of an organization representing the Palestinian people.&lt;ref name=masri/&gt; The [[Palestinian National Council]] convened in Jerusalem on 28 May 1964. Concluding this meeting the PLO was founded on 2 June 1964. Its stated goal was the "liberation of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]" through armed struggle.&lt;ref name=1964_charter/&gt;

==Ideology==
The ideology of the PLO was formulated in the founding year 1964 in the [[Palestinian National Covenant]].&lt;ref name=1964_charter&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.int/wcm/content/site/palestine/pid/12363|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130144018/http://www.un.int/wcm/content/site/palestine/pid/12363|dead-url=yes|archive-date=30 November 2010 |title=Permanent Observer Mission of Palestine to the United Nations - Palestine National Charter of 1964|date=30 November 2010|accessdate=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The document is a combative anti-Zionist statement dedicated to the "restoration of the Palestinian homeland". It has no reference to religion. In 1968, the Charter was replaced by a comprehensively revised version.&lt;ref name=1968_charter&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/plocov.asp ''The Palestinian National Charter: Resolutions of the Palestine National Council July 1-17, 1968''], on Avalon&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1993, the only promoted option was armed struggle. From the signing of the Oslo Accords, negotiation and diplomacy became the only official policy. In April 1996, a large number of articles, which were inconsistent with the [[Oslo Accords]], were wholly or partially nullified.&lt;ref name=letter_arafat-clinton&gt;[http://www.miftah.org/Display.cfm?DocId=428&amp;CategoryId=10 Letter From President Yasser Arafat to President Clinton], Miftah.org, 13 January 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

At the core of the PLO's ideology is the belief that [[Zionism|Zionists]] had unjustly expelled the Palestinians from Palestine and established a Jewish state in place under the pretext of having historic and Jewish ties with Palestine. The PLO demanded that [[Palestinian refugees]] be allowed to return to their homes. This is expressed in the National Covenant:

Article 2 of the Charter states that ″Palestine, with the boundaries it had during the [[Mandatory Palestine|British mandate]], is an indivisible territorial unit″,&lt;ref name=1968_charter/&gt; meaning that there is no place for a Jewish state. This article was adapted in 1996 to meet the Oslo Accords.&lt;ref name=letter_arafat-clinton/&gt;

Article 20 states: ″The [[Balfour Declaration]], the Mandate for Palestine, and everything that has been based upon them, are deemed null and void. Claims of historical or religious ties of Jews with Palestine are incompatible with the facts of history and the true conception of what constitutes statehood. Judaism, being a religion, is not an independent nationality. Nor do Jews constitute a single nation with an identity of its own; they are citizens of the states to which they belong″.&lt;ref name=1968_charter/&gt; This article was nullified in 1996.

Article 3 reads: ″The Palestinian Arab people possess the legal right to their homeland and have the right to determine their destiny after achieving the liberation of their country in accordance with their wishes and entirely of their own accord and will″.

The PLO has always labelled the Palestinian people as Arabs. This was a natural consequence of the fact that the PLO was an offshoot of the [[Arab League]]. It also has a tactical element, as to keep the backing of Arab states. Over the years, the Arab identity remained the stated nature of the Palestinian State.&lt;ref name=2003_basic_law/&gt; It is a reference to the ″Arab State″ envisioned in the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|UN Partition Plan]].

===Secularism versus adherence to Islam===
The PLO and its dominating faction Fatah are often contrasted to more religious orientated factions like Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ). All, however, represent a predominant Muslim population. Practically the whole population of the Territories is Muslim, most of them Sunni. Only some 50,000 (ca 1%) of the 4.6 million [[Palestinians]] in the occupied [[Palestinian territories]] (OPT) are [[Palestinian Christians|Palestinian Christian]].&lt;ref name=lpj&gt;[http://en.lpj.org/2014/10/21/palestinian-christians-in-the-holy-land-and-the-diaspora/ ''Palestinian Christians in the Holy Land and the Diaspora''].

Institute for Middle East Understanding, 17 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Charter has no reference to religion. Under President Arafat, the Fatah-dominated [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Authority]] adopted the 2003 Amended Basic Law, which stipulates Islam as the sole official religion in Palestine and the principles of Islamic [[sharia]] as a principal source of legislation.&lt;ref name=2003_basic_law&gt;[http://www.palestinianbasiclaw.org/basic-law/2003-amended-basic-law ''2003 Amended Basic Law'']&lt;br&gt;Art. 1: ″Palestine is part of the larger Arab world, and the Palestinian people are part of the Arab nation.″; Art. 4: ″Islam is the official religion in Palestine. Respect for the sanctity of all other divine religions shall be maintained; The principles of Islamic Shari'a shall be a principal source of legislation.; Arabic shall be the official language.″&lt;/ref&gt; The draft Constitution, which never materialized, contains the same provisions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040325025809/http://www.mopic.gov.ps/constitution/english%20constitution.asp The revision of the third draft of the constitution of the State of Palestine] (Art. 5 and 7). 15 May 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mew_constitution&gt;[http://www.mideastweb.org/palconstitution.htm ''Draft Palestine Constitution''].

==Organization==
===Structure===
[[File:Orient House.jpg|thumb|[[Orient House]], the former PLO headquarters in Jerusalem]]
The PLO incorporates a range of generally secular ideologies of different Palestinian movements "committed to the struggle for Palestinian independence and liberation," hence the name of the organization. It formally is an umbrella organization that includes "numerous organizations of the resistance movement, political parties, and popular organizations."&lt;ref name="un-observer"&gt;[http://palestineun.org/about-palestine/palestine-liberation-organization/ ''Palestine Liberation Organization'']. Permanent Observer Mission of Palestine to the United Nations&lt;/ref&gt; From the beginning, the PLO was designed as a government in exile, with a parliament, the [[Palestinian National Council|Palestine National Council]] (PNC), chosen by the Palestinian people, as the highest authority in the PLO, and an executive government (EC), elected by the PNC.&lt;ref name="un-observer"/&gt; In practice, however, the organization was rather a hierarchic one with a military-like character, needed for its function as liberation organization, the "liberation of Palestine".&lt;ref name=masri/&gt;

Beside a [[Palestinian National Covenant|Palestinian National Charter]], which describes the ideology of the PLO, a constitution, named "Fundamental Law", was adopted, which dictates the inner structure of the organization and the representation of the Palestinian people. A draft Constitution was written in 1963, to rule the PLO until free general elections among all the Palestinians in all the countries in which they resided could be held.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejerusalemfund.org/www.thejerusalemfund.org/carryover/documents/draft.html ''The Draft Constitution of the Palestine Liberation Organization (1963)''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226003303/http://www.thejerusalemfund.org/www.thejerusalemfund.org/carryover/documents/draft.html|date=26 December 2013}} See Article 4. The Jerusalem Fund&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution was revised in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Peace/plocon.html ''Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO):Constitution'']. Text of the 1968 Constitution on JVL&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutions===
The [[Palestinian National Council]] has 740 members and the [[Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization|Executive Committee]] or ExCo has 18 members. The [[Palestinian Central Council]] or CC or PCC, established by the PNC in 1973, is the second leading body of the PLO.&lt;ref name=memo_distinction/&gt; The CC consists of 124 members&lt;ref name=pcc_1996&gt;See the 1996 list of members: [https://web.archive.org/web/20081025100117/http://middleeastreference.org.uk/plocc.html Members of the PLO Central Council as of 1996].

The CC makes policy decisions when PNC is not in session, acting as a link between the PNC and the PLO-EC. The CC is elected by the PNC and chaired by the PNC speaker.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021001205923/http://www.al-bab.com/arab/countries/palestine/orgs1.htm ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The PNC serves as the parliament for all Palestinians inside and outside of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including Jerusalem. The PLO is governed internally by its "Fundamental Law", which describes the powers and the relations between the organs of the PLO.&lt;ref name=memo_distinction&gt;[http://transparency.aljazeera.net/files/4698.pdf ''Memo: Distinction between PLO, PA, PNC, PLC''].

[[Ahmad Shukeiri]] was the first [[Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization|Chairman of the PLO Executive Committee]] from 1964 to 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=DWhgIe3Hq98C&amp;pg=PA316&amp;lpg=PA316&amp;dq=Ahmad+shukeiri+first+chairman+of+the+PLO+executive+committee&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gR1vSm7Kx3&amp;sig=kl9ULyayd_ywt2NsvlFoDAdYRvo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjTkM2UvvrXAhXHbhQKHXecBikQ6AEIPzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Ahmad%20shukeiri%20first%20chairman%20of%20the%20PLO%20executive%20committee&amp;f=false|title=The Palestine Yearbook of International Law 1987-1988|last=Pineschi|date=1 February 1997|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=9041103414|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, he was replaced by Yahia Hammuda. [[Yasser Arafat]] occupied the function from 1969 until his death in 2004.&lt;ref name=lansford_p1634&gt;Tom Lansford,[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=iC_VBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1627 ''Political Handbook of the World 2014''], p. 1634. CQ Press, March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded by [[Mahmoud Abbas]] (also known as Abu Mazen).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6459196/ns/world_news-yasser_arafat/t/mahmoud-abbas-elected-chairman-plo/#.WiqPPd-E5hE|title=Mahmoud Abbas elected chairman of PLO|last=|first=|date=2004|website=nbcnews.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-20033995|title=Profile: Mahmoud Abbas|date=29 November 2012|work=BBC News|access-date=8 December 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an internal PLO document, the current PNC remains in function if elections are not possible. In absence of elections, most of the members of the PNC are appointed by the Executive Committee. The document further states that "the PNC represents all sectors of the Palestinian community worldwide, including numerous organizations of the resistance movement, political parties, popular organizations and independent personalities and figures from all sectors of life, including intellectuals, religious leaders and businessmen".&lt;ref name=memo_distinction/&gt;

===Challenged representation===
As of 2015, there have not been elections for many years, neither for the PNC, nor for the EC, the PCC or the [[President of the State of Palestine]]. The Executive Committee has formally 18 members, including its Chairman, but in past years many vacant seats in the Executive remained empty. Moreover, [[Hamas]], the largest representative of the inhabitants of the Palestinian Territories alongside [[Fatah]], is not represented in the PLO at all. The results of the [[Palestinian legislative election, 2006|last parliamentary elections for the PLC]], held in the Territories in 2006, with Hamas as the big winner while not even a member of the PLO, "underlined the clear lack of a popular mandate by the PLO leadership", according to [[Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs|PASSIA]].&lt;ref name=passia_plo-vs-pa&gt;[http://www.passia.org/images/meetings/2014/oct/28/PA-PLO2.pdf ''PLO vs. PA''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304102228/http://www.passia.org/images/meetings/2014/oct/28/PA-PLO2.pdf |date=4 March 2016 }}, p. 9. Passia, September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Individual elected members of the [[Palestinian Legislative Council|PLC]] representing Hamas, however, are automatically members of the PNC.

The representative status of the PLO has often been challenged in the past.&lt;ref name=masri/&gt; It was for example doubted in 2011 by a group of Palestinian lawyers, jurists and legal scholars, due to lack of elections. They questioned the PLO's legitimacy to alter the status and role of the Organisation in respect of their status within the UN. They demanded immediate and direct elections to the Palestine National Council to ″activate representative PLO institutions in order to preserve, consolidate, and strengthen the effective legal representation of the Palestinian people as a whole″, before changing the status within the UN.&lt;ref name=maan-2011/&gt;

===PLO versus PA===
The 1993–1995 [[Oslo Accords]] deliberately detached the Palestinian population in the [[Palestinian territories|Occupied Palestinian Territories]] from the PLO and the Palestinians in exile by creating a [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Authority]] (PA) for the Territories. A separate parliament and government were established. Mahmoud Abbas was one of the architects of the Oslo Accords.&lt;ref name=bbc-2009&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1933453.stm Profile: Mahmoud Abbas]. BBC, 5 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NHCQBAFMwawC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=Through+Secret+Channels#v=onepage&amp;q=Through%20Secret%20Channels&amp;f=false Who's Who in the Arab World 2007-2008]. Walter de Gruyter, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many in the PLO opposed the Oslo Agreements, the Executive Committee and the Central Council approved the Accords. It marked the beginning of the PLO's decline, as the PA came to replace the PLO as the prime Palestinian political institution. Political factions within the PLO that had opposed the Oslo process were marginalized. Only during the Hamas-led PA Government in 2006-2007, the PLO resurfaced. After Hamas had taken over Gaza in 2007, Abbas issued a decree suspending the PLC and some sections of the Palestinian Basic Law, and appointing Salam Fayyad as Prime Minister.&lt;ref name=masri&gt;[http://muftah.org/the-plo-and-the-crisis-of-representation-by-mazen-masri/#.Vef84LNnor4 ''The PLO and the crisis of representation''].  Mazen Masri, Muftah, 15 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The PLO managed to overcome the separation by uniting the power in PLO and PA in one individual, [[Yasser Arafat]]. In 2002,  Arafat held the functions Chairman of  the PLO/Executive Committee and Chairman of [[Fatah]], the dominating faction within the PLO, as well as [[President of the Palestinian National Authority]]. He also controlled the [[Palestinian National Security Forces]].&lt;ref name=ahram/&gt;

===Internal politics===
On 4 February 1969, Fatah founder Arafat was elected [[Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization|Chairman of the PLO]] in [[Cairo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HAJIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1f8MAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2064,4351664&amp;dq=arafat&amp;hl=en|title=The Morning Record - Google News Archive Search|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0C14F839541A7493C7A91789D85F4D8685F9 |title=Fatah Wins Control Of Palestine Group - Article - Nytimes.Com |website=Select.nytimes.com |date=5 February 1969 |accessdate=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since, Fatah has been the dominant factor within the PLO, which still continues in 2015.

Under pressure from the international community led by Israel and US, and  from inside his own party Fatah, Arafat partially transferred some of his strongly centralized power in 2003,&lt;ref name=mew_constitution/&gt;&lt;ref name=ahram&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030811171247/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2003/647/re2.htm ''Arafat vs Abbas''].

CNN, 15 May 2002&lt;/ref&gt; causing strong tensions within the Palestinian leadership.  Arafat appointed [[Mahmoud Abbas]] as prime minister, but this resulted in disputes about the transfer of tasks and responsibilities. Abbas was strongly supported by the US and the international community, because he was supposed to be more willing to give far-reaching concessions to Israel.&lt;ref name=ahram/&gt; While Arafat had retained most of his power and a power struggle within Fatah continued, the leadership was criticised for corruption and nepotism.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/jul/20/israel ''Arafat urged to end corruption after unrest''].

Tariq Dana, Al-Shabaka, 18 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Cause of Yasser Arafat's death|Arafat's death]], Abbas increasingly gained exclusive powers within both PLO and PA as well as in Fatah, until he had acquired the same power as was previously held by Arafat.&lt;ref name=frykberg&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/08/critics-slam-mahmoud-abbas-plo-resignation-farce-150827081457810.html Critics slam Mahmoud Abbas' PLO resignation as 'farce'].

====2015 struggle for power====
{{see also|Politics of the Palestinian National Authority}}
With a ''de facto'' defunct parliament and Executive, Mahmoud Abbas increasingly gained exclusive powers within both PLO and [[Palestinian National Authority|PA]], as well as in [[Fatah]]. After the announcement in August 2015 of Abbas' resignation as [[Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization|Chairman of the Executive Committee]] and of nine other members as well, many Palestinians saw the move as just an attempt to replace some members in the Executive Committee, or to force a meeting of the PNC and remain in their jobs until the PNC decides whether to accept or to reject their resignations.&lt;ref name=jp_purported&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Purported-Abbas-resignation-from-PLO-Executive-Committee-ridiculed-as-silly-show-413006 ''Purported Abbas resignation from PLO Executive Committee ridiculed as ′silly show′''].

====Observer status====
The United Nations General Assembly recognized the PLO as the "representative of the Palestinian people" in Resolution 3210 and Resolution 3236, and granted the PLO observer status on 22 November 1974 in Resolution 3237. On 12 January 1976 the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] voted 11–1 with 3 abstentions to allow the Palestinian Liberation Organization to participate in a Security Council debate without voting rights, a privilege usually restricted to UN member states. It was admitted as a full member of the [[United Nations Regional Groups|Asia group]] on 2 April 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Permanent Observer Mission of Palestine to the United Nations|title=Status of Palestine at the United Nations|url=http://www.un.int/wcm/content/site/palestine/cache/offonce/pid/11550;jsessionid=DB37131DB27A165B6398469FFE4DB1FC|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=9 December 2010|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606092743/http://www.un.int/wcm/content/site/palestine/cache/offonce/pid/11550%3Bjsessionid%3DDB37131DB27A165B6398469FFE4DB1FC|archivedate=6 June 2011|df=}}: "On 2 April 1986, the Asian Group of the U.N. decided to accept the PLO as a full member."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations Conference on Trade and Development|title=Government structures|url=http://www.unctad.org/templates/Page.asp?intItemID=4966&amp;lang=1|publisher=United Nations|year=2002|accessdate=5 December 2010|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613180649/http://unctad.org/Templates/Page.asp?intItemID=4966&amp;lang=1|archivedate=13 June 2010|df=}}: "At present, the PLO is a full member of the Asian Group of the United Nations".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Nations General Assembly [http://www.undemocracy.com/A-RES-52-250.pdf Resolution 52/250: Participation of Palestine in the work of the United Nations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522214702/http://www.undemocracy.com/A-RES-52-250.pdf|date=22 May 2011}} (1998): "Palestine enjoys full membership in the Group of Asian States".&lt;/ref&gt;

====2011 application for UN state membership====
When President Mahmoud Abbas [[Palestine 194|submitted an application for UN state membership]], in September 2011, Palestinian lawyers, jurists and legal scholars expressed their concern that the change of Palestine's status in the UN (since 1988 designated as "Palestine" in place of "Palestine Liberation Organization") could have negative implications on the legal position of the Palestinian people. They warned for the risk of fragmentation, where the State of Palestine would represent the people within the UN and the PLO represent the people outside the UN, the latter including the Palestinians in exile, where refugees constitute more than half of the Palestinian people. They were also afraid of the loss of representation of the refugees in the UN.&lt;ref name=maan-2011&gt;[http://www.maannews.com/Content.aspx?id=425080 Palestinian lawyers affirm essential role of PLO at UN]. Ma'an News Agency, 13 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In Resolution 67/19 November 2012, Palestine was at last awarded non-member observer State status, but the General Assembly maintained the status of the PLO.

====′Non-member observer state′ status====
By September 2012, with their application for full membership stalled due to the inability of Security Council members to 'make a unanimous recommendation', the PLO had decided to pursue an upgrade in status from "observer entity" to  [[United Nations General Assembly observers#Non-member states|"non-member observer state"]]. On 29 November 2012, [[United Nations General Assembly resolution 67/19|Resolution 67/19]] passed, upgrading Palestine to "non-member observer State" status in the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/press/en/2012/ga11317.doc.htm ''General Assembly Votes Overwhelmingly to Accord Palestine ‘Non-Member Observer State’ Status in United Nations''].

===Diplomatic representation===

==Peace process==
{{further|Palestinian views on the peace process#Yasser Arafat and the PLO}}
Initially, as a guerrilla organization, the PLO performed actions against Israel in the 1970s and early 1980s, regarded as terroristic activities by Israel and regarded as a [[Wars of national liberation|war of liberation]] by the PLO. In 1988, however, the PLO officially endorsed a two-state solution, contingent on terms such as making [[East Jerusalem]] capital of the Palestinian state and giving Palestinians the [[right of return]] to land occupied by Palestinians prior to 1948, as well as the right to continue armed struggle until the end of "The [[Zionist entity|Zionist Entity]]."&lt;ref&gt;William L. Cleveland, ''A History of the Modern Middle East'', Westview Press (2004). {{ISBN|0-8133-4048-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, the PLO nullified the articles of the PLO's Charter, or parts of it, which called for the destruction of Israel and for armed resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Permanent Observer Mission of Palestine to the United Nations, [http://www.un.int/wcm/content/site/palestine/cache/offonce/pid/12361 ''Decisions and Actions Related to the Palestine National Charter''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121212003808/http://www.un.int/wcm/content/site/palestine/cache/offonce/pid/12361|date=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ten Point Program===
Following the failure of the armies of Egypt and Syria to defeat Israel in the October 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]], which broke the status quo existing since the June 1967 [[Six-Day War]], the PLO began formulating a strategic alternative.&lt;ref name=merip /&gt; Now, they intended to establish a "national authority" over every territory they would be able to reconquer. From 1 to 9 June 1974, the Palestine National Council held its 12th meeting in Cairo. On 8 June, the [[PLO's Ten Point Program|Ten Point Program]] was adopted. The Program stated:

{{quote|The Liberation Organization will employ all means, and first and foremost armed struggle, to liberate Palestinian territory and to establish the independent combatant national authority for the people over every part of Palestinian territory that is liberated. This will require further changes being effected in the balance of power in favour of our people and their struggle.&lt;ref name=ten_point&gt;[https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/BA7A9909F792340F8525704D006BDAF1 ''Text of the Ten Point Program''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150325120540/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/BA7A9909F792340F8525704D006BDAF1 |date=25 March 2015}}, 8 June 1974. On UNISPAL&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By "every part of Palestinian territory that is liberated" was implicitly meant the West Bank and Gaza Strip, albeit presented as an interim goal.&lt;ref name=merip&gt;[http://www.merip.org/mer/mer80/plo-crossroads ''The PLO at the Crossroads—Moderation, Encirclement, Future Prospects'']. See par. The PLO on the Road to "Moderation". Sameer Abraham, MER 80, Volume: 9, September/October 1979&lt;/ref&gt; The final goal remained "completing the liberation of all Palestinian territory" and "recover all their national rights and, first and foremost, their rights to return and to self-determination on the whole of the soil of their homeland".&lt;ref name=plo1974&gt;[http://www.mideastweb.org/plo1974.htm The PNC Program of 1974], 8 June 1974. On the site of MidEastWeb for Coexistence R.A. – Middle East Resources. Page includes commentary.&lt;/ref&gt; Also [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 242|UN Resolution 242]] was still rejected.&lt;ref name=ten_point /&gt;

While clinging to armed struggle as the prime means, the PLO no longer excluded peaceful means.Therefore, the ''Ten Point Program'' was considered the first attempt by the PLO at peaceful resolution. In October 1974, the Arab League proclaimed the PLO "the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people in any Palestinian territory that is liberated", and also the UN recognized the PLO. From then, the diplomatic road was prepared. On the other hand, the Program was rejected by more radical factions and eventually caused a split in the movement.&lt;ref name=merip /&gt;

===First Intifada===
{{Main|First Intifada}}
In 1987, the [[First Intifada]] broke out in the [[West Bank]] and Gaza Strip. The Intifada caught the PLO by surprise,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialistworld.net/eng/2004/11/11arafat.html Yasser Arafat obituary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170111102436/http://www.socialistworld.net/eng/2004/11/11arafat.html |date=11 January 2017 }}, socialistworld.net (Committee for a Worker's International) 11 November 2004. Retrieved 5 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and the leadership abroad could only indirectly influence the events. A new local leadership emerged, the [[Unified National Leadership of the Uprising]] (UNLU), comprising many leading Palestinian factions. After [[Hussein of Jordan|King Hussein]] of Jordan proclaimed the administrative and legal separation of the West Bank from Jordan in 1988,&lt;ref&gt;King Hussein, [http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/88_july31.html Address to the Nation], Amman, Jordan, 31 July 1988. On the Royal Hashemit Court's official site in tribute to King Hussein. Retrieved 5 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; the Palestine National Council adopted the [[Palestinian Declaration of Independence]] in [[Algiers]], proclaiming an independent [[State of Palestine]]. The declaration made reference to UN resolutions without explicitly mentioning Security Council [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 242|Resolutions 242]] and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 338|338]].

A month later, Arafat declared in [[Geneva]] that the PLO would support a solution of the conflict based on these Resolutions. Effectively, the PLO recognized Israel's right to exist within pre-1967 borders, with the understanding that the Palestinians would be allowed to set up their own state in the West Bank and Gaza. The United States accepted this clarification by Arafat and began to allow diplomatic contacts with PLO officials.&lt;!--While the Intifada many members of PLO organizations take a part at the activities or organized them, especially as "Unified Intifada Leadership" and its branches. At the beginning that activities weren't organized by the PLO itself. But, later the activities (especially the violent ones, like killing Israelis or collaborators) were more and more organized by the PLO. IS THERE A SOURCE FOR THIS? The UIL paid allegiance to the PLO, but how directly influenced it was by the PLO needs to be clarified. That the PLO was responsible for the more violent acts needs a source, please/!--&gt; The Proclamation of Independence did not lead to statehood, although over 100 states [[International recognition of the State of Palestine|recognised]] the State of Palestine.

===Oslo Accords===
In 1993, the PLO secretly negotiated the [[Oslo Accords]] with Israel.&lt;ref name=beyer&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2EzIySCw9VIC&amp;pg=PA116&amp;dq=PLO+secretly+negotiated+1993&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=kdl1TuLdA4rdgQflwenEDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=PLO%20secretly%20negotiated%201993&amp;f=false|title=Violent Globalisms|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accords were signed on 20 August 1993.&lt;ref name=beyer /&gt; There was a subsequent public ceremony in Washington D.C. on 13 September 1993 with Yasser Arafat and [[Yitzhak Rabin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GkbzYoZtaJMC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=%22september+13+1993%22+arafat&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=S9V1Tr3JC4bLgQeD9_nODA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;res==num=3&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22september%2013%201993%22%20arafat&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of the Palestinians|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Accords granted Palestinians the right to self-government on the Gaza Strip and the city of [[Jericho]] in the [[West Bank]] through the creation of the [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Authority]]. Yasser Arafat was appointed head of the Palestinian Authority and a timetable for elections was laid out. The headquarters of the PLO were moved to [[Ramallah]] on the West Bank.&lt;ref name="PLOhead1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PLOhead2"/&gt;

==Legal actions against the PLO==
{{see|Leon Klinghoffer|Sokolow et al v. Palestine Liberation Organization et al}}
The PLO has been sued in the United States by families of those killed or injured in attacks by Palestinians. One of those lawsuits was settled prior to going to trial,&lt;ref name=NYT1997&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/12/world/a-settlement-with-plo-over-terror-on-a-cruise.html|title=A Settlement With P.L.O.

==History and armed actions==
===Early actions===
The PLO began their militancy campaign from its inception with an attack on [[National Water Carrier of Israel|Israel's National Water Carrier]] in January 1965.&lt;ref name="fundingevil"/&gt; The group used [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] tactics to attack Israel from their bases in [[Jordan]] (including the [[West Bank]]), [[Lebanon]], Egypt ([[Gaza Strip]]), and [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761588322_2/arab-israeli_conflict.html Arab-Israeli Conflict], [[Encarta]] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028083130/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761588322_2/arab-israeli_conflict.html|date=28 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most notable of what were considered terrorist acts committed by [[List of political parties in the Palestine Liberation Organization|member organizations]] of the PLO were:
*The 1970 [[Avivim school bus bombing|Avivim school bus massacre]] by the [[Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (DFLP), killed nine children, three adults and crippled 19.
*In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]], the second-largest PLO faction after [[Fatah|al-Fatah]], carried out [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine#Armed attacks of the PFLP|a number of attacks and plane hijackings]] mostly directed at Israel, most infamously the [[Dawson's Field hijackings]], which precipitated the [[Black September]] crisis.
*In 1972, the [[Black September Organization]] carried out the [[Munich massacre]] of Israeli Olympic athletes.
*In 1974, members of the DFLP seized a school in Israel and killed a total of 26 students and adults and wounded over 70 in the [[Ma'alot massacre]].
*The 1975, [[Savoy Hotel attack|Savoy Hotel hostage situation]] killing 8 hostages and 3 soldiers, carried out by Fatah.
*The 1978, [[Coastal Road massacre]] killing 37 Israelis and wounding 76, also carried out by Fatah.

===War of attrition===
From 1967 to September 1970 the PLO, with passive support from Jordan, fought a [[War of Attrition|war of attrition]] with Israel. During this time, the PLO launched artillery attacks on the [[moshav]]im and [[kibbutz]]im of [[Emek HaMaayanot Regional Council|Bet Shean Valley Regional Council]], while [[Palestinian fedayeen|fedayeen]] launched numerous attacks on Israeli forces. Israel raided the PLO camps in Jordan, including [[Battle of Karameh|Karameh]], withdrawing only under Jordanian military pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Ben-Tzedef|first=Eviatar|title=Inferno at Karameh|work=nfc|accessdate=3 September 2008|date=24 March 2008|url=http://www.nfc.co.il/Archive/003-D-28622-00.html?tag=10-27-34|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921135837/http://www.nfc.co.il/Archive/003-D-28622-00.html?tag=10-27-34|archivedate=21 September 2008 |deadurl=no|language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This conflict culminated in [[Black September|Jordan's expulsion of the PLO]] to Lebanon in July 1971.

===Black September===
{{Main|Black September}}
The PLO suffered a major reversal with the Jordanian assault on its armed groups, in the events known as [[Black September]] in 1970. The Palestinian groups were expelled from Jordan, and during the 1970s, the PLO was effectively an [[Umbrella organization|umbrella group]] of eight organizations headquartered in [[Damascus]] and [[Beirut]], all devoted to armed struggle against [[Zionism]] or Israeli occupation, using methods which included direct clashing and [[guerrilla warfare]] against Israel. After Black September, the [[Cairo Agreement (1969)|Cairo Agreement]] led the PLO to establish itself in Lebanon.

===Lebanon and the Lebanese Civil War===
{{Main|Palestinian insurgency in South Lebanon|Lebanese Civil War}}

In the late 1960s, and especially after the expulsion of the Palestinian militants from Jordan in [[Black September|Black September events in 1970–1971]], Lebanon had become the base for PLO operations. Palestinian militant organizations relocated their headquarters to South Lebanon, and relying on the support in Palestinian refugee camps, waged a campaign of attacks on the Galilee and on Israeli and Jewish targets worldwide. Increasing penetration of Palestinians into Lebanese politics and Israeli retaliations gradually deteriorated the situation.

By the mid-1970s, Arafat and his Fatah movement found themselves in a tenuous position.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Arafat increasingly called for diplomacy, perhaps best symbolized by his Ten Points Program and his support for a UN Security Council resolution proposed in 1976 calling for a [[two-state solution|two-state settlement]] on the pre-1967 borders.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} But the [[Rejectionist Front]] denounced the calls for diplomacy, and a diplomatic solution was vetoed by the United States.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} In 1975, the increasing tensions between Palestinian militants and Christian militias exploded into the [[Lebanese Civil War]], involving all factions. On 20 January 1976, the PLO took part in the [[Damour massacre]] in retaliation to the [[Karantina massacre]]. The PLO and [[Lebanese National Movement]] attacked the Christian town of [[Damour]], killing 684 civilians and forcing the remainder of the towns population to flee. In 1976 Syria joined the war by invading Lebanon, which began the 29‑year [[Syrian occupation of Lebanon]], and in 1978 Israel invaded South Lebanon, in response to the [[Coastal Road massacre|Coastal Road Massacre]], executed by Palestinian militants based in Lebanon.

The population in the West Bank and Gaza Strip saw Arafat as their best hope for a resolution to the conflict.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} This was especially so in the aftermath of the [[Camp David Accords]] of 1978 between Israel and Egypt, which the Palestinians saw as a blow to their aspirations to self-determination.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} [[Abu Nidal]], a sworn enemy of the PLO since 1974,{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} assassinated the PLO's diplomatic envoy to the [[European Economic Community]], which in the [[Venice Declaration]] of 1980 had called for the Palestinian right of self-determination to be recognized by Israel.

Opposition to Arafat was fierce not only among radical Arab groups, but also among many on the Israeli right.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} This included [[Menachem Begin]], who had stated on more than one occasion that even if the PLO accepted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 242|UN Security Council Resolution 242]] and recognized Israel's right to exist, he would never negotiate with the organization.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, op. cit., p.&amp;nbsp;357&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=April 2012}} This contradicted the official United States position that it would negotiate with the PLO if the PLO accepted Resolution 242 and recognized Israel, which the PLO had thus far been unwilling to do. Other Arab voices had recently called for a diplomatic resolution to the hostilities in accord with the international consensus, including Egyptian leader [[Anwar Sadat]] on his visit to Washington, DC in August 1981, and Crown Prince Fahd of Saudi Arabia in his 7 August peace proposal; together with Arafat's diplomatic maneuver, these developments made Israel's argument that it had "no partner for peace" seem increasingly problematic. Thus, in the eyes of Israeli hard-liners, "the Palestinians posed a greater challenge to Israel as a peacemaking organization than as a military one".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, op. cit., 376&lt;/ref&gt;

After the appointment of Ariel Sharon to the post of Minister of defence in 1981, the Israeli government policy of allowing political growth to occur in the occupied West Bank and Gaza strip changed. The Israeli government tried, unsuccessfully, to dictate terms of political growth by replacing local pro-PLO leaders with an Israeli civil administration.&lt;ref&gt;Shaul Mishal, Ranan D.

In 1982, after an attack on a senior Israeli diplomat by Lebanon-based Palestinian militants in Lebanon, Israel invaded Lebanon in a much larger scale in coordination with the Lebanese Christian militias, reaching Beirut and eventually resulting in ousting of the PLO headquarters in June that year. Low-level Palestinian insurgency in Lebanon continued in parallel with the consolidation of Shia militant organizations, but became a secondary concern to Israeli military and other Lebanese factions. With ousting of the PLO, the Lebanese Civil War gradually turned into a prolonged conflict, shifting from mainly PLO-Christian conflict into involvement of all Lebanese factions – whether Sunni, Shia, Druze, and Christians.

===Tunis===
In 1982, the PLO relocated to [[Tunis]], Tunisia after it was driven out of Lebanon by Israel during the [[First Lebanon War]]. Following massive raids by Israeli forces in Beirut, it is estimated that 8,000 PLO fighters evacuated the city and dispersed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Helena Cobban]], ''The Palestinian Liberation Organisation: People, Power and Politics'', p3&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 October 1985, in [[Operation Wooden Leg]], [[Israeli Air Force]] [[McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle|F-15s]] bombed the PLO's Tunis headquarters, killing more than 60 people.

It is suggested that the Tunis period (1982–1991) was a negative point in the PLO's history, leading up to the Oslo negotiations and formation of the Palestinian Authority (PA). The PLO in exile was distant from a concentrated number of Palestinians and became far less effective.&lt;ref&gt;Rashid Khalidi, The Iron Cage, The Story of the Struffle for Palestinian Statehood, p 180&lt;/ref&gt; There was a significant reduction in centres of research, political debates or journalistic endeavours that had encouraged an energised public presence of the PLO in Beirut. More and more Palestinians were abandoned, and many felt that this was the beginning of the end.&lt;ref&gt;Rashid Khalidi, The Iron Cage, The Story of the Struffle for Palestinian Statehood, p164&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Intifada===
{{Main|Second Intifada}}
The Second or Al-Aqsa Intifada started concurrently with the breakdown of July 2000 Camp David talks between Palestinian Authority Chairman [[Yasser Arafat]] and Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Barak]]. The Intifada never ended officially, but violence hit relatively low levels during 2005. The death toll, including both military personnel and civilians, of the entire conflict in 2000–2004 is estimated to be 3,223 Palestinians and 950 Israelis, although this number is criticized for not differentiating between combatants and civilians.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Members of the PLO have claimed responsibility for a number of attacks against Israelis during the Second Intifada.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

In February 2015, in [[Sokolow et al v. Palestine Liberation Organization et al|a civil case considered by a US federal court]] the [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Authority]] and Palestine Liberation Organization were found liable for the death and injuries of US citizens in a number of terrorist attacks in Israel from 2001 to 2004. The damages are to be $655.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/24/nyregion/damages-awarded-in-terror-case-against-palestinian-groups.html?emc=edit_na_20150223&amp;nlid=31298867&amp;_r=0 |title=Palestinian Groups Are Found Liable at Manhattan Terror Trial|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wealth controversy==
According to a 1993 report by the British [[National Criminal Intelligence Service]], the PLO was "the richest of all terrorist organizations", with $8–$10 billion in assets and an annual income of $1.5-$2 billion from "[[donation]]s, [[extortion]], payoffs, illegal [[Arms industry|arms dealing]], [[Illegal drug trade|drug trafficking]], [[money laundering]], [[fraud]], etc."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=UIJDreLroswC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;lpg=PA83&amp;dq=PLO+was+%22the+richest+of+all+terrorist+organizations%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kmS-zg2kY2&amp;sig=8D8ovY6Cd2bRstAtI9LRgD06R6Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjVnriZ-v7XAhXHJJoKHa7JCj0Q6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=PLO%20was%20%22the%20richest%20of%20all%20terrorist%20organizations%22&amp;f=false The Palestine Liberation Organization: Terrorism and Prospects for Peace in the Holy Land], Daniel Baracskay, 2011, page 83, Praeger Security International, {{ISBN|9780313381515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Peace of [[Tournai]]''' (''Vrede van Doornik'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]) was an agreement between the Burgundian Duke [[Philip II, Duke of Burgundy|Philip II]] and the rebellious city of [[Ghent]] signed on 18 December 1385.

The treaty said that Ghent kept its privileges, that the rebels would be given amnesty and that, because it was the time of the [[Western Schism]], Ghent would be free in recognizing the pope of its choice. However, Ghent was required to give up its treaty with England and recognize the King of France.

}}'''Rodney Philip Hide''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|QSO|size=85%}} (born 16 December 1956) is a former New Zealand politician of the [[ACT New Zealand|ACT Party]]. Hide was a Member of Parliament for ACT from 1996 until 2011, was ACT's leader between 2004 and 2011, and represented the {{NZ electorate link|Epsom}} from 2005 to 2011. In the [[Fifth National Government of New Zealand|Fifth National Government]], Hide was Minister of Local Government, Associate Minister of Commerce and Minister of Regulatory Reform until 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/vote08/4762929a28435.html|date=17 November 2008|title=New groups part of deals|work=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]]|first=Martin|last=Kay}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He stepped down as ACT leader in April 2011 after a leadership challenge from Don Brash and retired from Parliament at the [[New Zealand general election, 2011|general election later that year]].&lt;ref name="3news"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Rodney-Hide-resigns-makes-way-for-Brash/tabid/419/articleID/208855/Default.aspx |title=Rodney Hide resigns, makes way for Brash|work=[[3 News]]|date=27 April 2011|first=Dan|last=Satherley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Rodney Philip Hide&lt;ref name="thesis" /&gt; was born in [[Oxford, New Zealand|Oxford]] in [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]. His father, Philip Hide, owned a small mixed-farm at [[Cust, New Zealand|Cust]] and also drove trucks.  In 1960, due to sickness, Philip Hide sold the small farm and moved to [[Rangiora]], continuing to drive trucks until his retirement.  Rodney Hide attended [[Rangiora High School]], before gaining a degree in [[zoology]] and [[botany]] from the [[University of Canterbury]]. After completing his degree, he travelled overseas, eventually finding himself in Scotland. He worked for some time on [[Oil platform|oil rig]]s in the [[North Sea]]. Hide eventually returned to New Zealand by way of Romania, Egypt, India, Bangladesh, and Malaysia. In Malaysia he re-met Jiuan Jiuan—with whom he had shared a house in [[Christchurch]]—and the two married in 1983. They were to separate in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10428206|title=Rodney Hide's marriage ends after 23 years|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=11 March 2007|first=Stephen|last=Cook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After returning to New Zealand, Hide gained a degree in [[resource management]] from [[Lincoln University (New Zealand)|Lincoln College, Canterbury]]. He then took up a teaching position at [[Lincoln University (New Zealand)|Lincoln]], first in resource management and later in economics. He completed his master's degree in [[economics]] from [[Montana State University]] with a thesis on New Zealand's transferable fishing quotas.&lt;ref name="thesis"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hide|first=Rodney Phillip|title=Monopolizing individual transferable quota: theory and evidence|url= http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/1992/hide/HideR1992.pdf |year=1992 |publisher=Montana State University|accessdate=18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, [[Alan Gibbs]], an [[Auckland]] [[business]]man, offered Hide a job as an economist. He accepted, and also began working at a [[radio station]] owned by Gibbs. Later, Hide also met [[Roger Douglas]], a former [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|Minister of Finance]] whose radical economic reforms had made a considerable impression on him.

When Douglas established the [[Association of Consumers and Taxpayers]] (which later formed the [[ACT New Zealand|ACT]] party), Hide had close involvement as the organisation's first chairman and president.

==Member of Parliament==

{{NZ parlbox footer}}
Hide first entered [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]] in 1996 as a [[Party list proportional representation|list MP]]. He won the party parliamentary leadership role in a closely contested [[primary election|primary]] after the retirement of [[Richard Prebble]] in 2004. He then went on to win the Epsom electorate from sitting [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] MP [[Richard Worth]] in 2005 with the campaign message "ACT is back". He retained this seat in the {{NZ election link|2008}}.

Hide had a reputation for strong views, for his media profile, and for his confrontational style. In 2002, when Hide still sat on the [[back bench]]es, one commentator{{who|date=April 2012}} described him the "leader of the opposition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://liberation.typepad.com/liberation/2011/04/don-brashs-move-from-national-to-act.html |title=Don Brash’s move from National to Act |last=Miller |first=Geoffrey |date=27 April 2011 |website=Liberation |accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hide's supporters often described him as one of the most effective opposition MPs, and praised him for his motivation and commitment.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

===Entry into Parliament===
Hide held the seventh place on the ACT [[party list]] for the [[New Zealand general election, 1996|1996 elections]]. ACT received enough votes for Hide to enter Parliament, making him one of the party's "founding" MPs. He gradually rose through the party's ranks, reaching second place in the ACT list for the [[New Zealand general election, 2002|2002 elections]].

In his [[maiden speech]], Hide made a specific attack on "[[wikt:perquisite|perks]]" enjoyed by MPs, and this "perk-busting" became a characteristic of his political career until he was himself exposed for taking advantage of such perks, in taking his girlfriend on a tax payer funded trip to London and Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/general/hides-hypocrisy-cost-him-his-job-2011042818#axzz49NYiVQ5m|date=28 April 2011|title=Hide's hypocrisy cost him his job|work=[[News Hub (Auckland)|News Hub]]|first=Patrick|last=Gower}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hide still however claims to have developed a substantial reputation for finding and exposing "scandals", whether they relate to MPs' perks or to other governmental matters. Hide's critics often claim that his "scandals" rely on sensationalism and exaggeration, and have as their only purpose the gaining of media attention; but his supporters believe that Hide's constant scrutiny "keeps the government honest" and ensures that the administration does not waste taxpayers' money.

[[Roger Douglas]] himself has emerged as one of Hide's more prominent critics, referring to Hide's "stunts" as detracting from ACT's core economic message, shifting focus to populist issues of law and order and to provocative race relations policies. At a party conference, Douglas condemned [[Member of parliament|MPs]] "who run any fickle line capable of grabbing short-term votes and attention", a comment allegedly directed at Hide or at his supporters. Hide acknowledges the criticism, but defends himself on the grounds that a focus on pure economic theory will not attract interest: "the problem is that the so-called stunts are particularly well-reported and my work explaining free market ideas disappears without trace." The tension between [[Roger Douglas|Douglas]] and Hide increased when Hide made a bid for the vice-presidency of ACT in 2000: supporters of Douglas interpreted this action as a challenge to Douglas' organisational authority within the party. Both Douglas and Hide stood down from their roles as President and Vice-President, suggesting an uneasy truce between these two factions. In 2008 the two men worked closely together with Douglas holding third place on the party list following Hide and Heather Roy.

===ACT Party leadership===
Many people had known for some time that Hide saw himself as a potential parliamentary leader of the [[ACT New Zealand|ACT]] party, and he himself showed no reluctance in saying so.  At several points, rumours circulated that Hide planned to challenge party leader [[Richard Prebble]] for his position, although such a challenge never emerged. When Prebble eventually announced his retirement, his critics{{who|date=April 2012}} claimed that this had been brought about by secret campaigning by Hide. However, Prebble himself has denied this claim and it appears more likely that he stood down for personal reasons, as he publicly claimed.

When Prebble announced his retirement, Hide quickly indicated that he would seek the caucus leadership. Prebble, however, appeared unenthusiastic about the prospect of Hide succeeding him, and in a speech praising each of the new leadership contenders, pointedly dwelled on the others. The succession method chosen by Prebble also appeared to disfavour Hide: rather than a simple [[caucus]] vote, which a conventional leadership challenge would have called, a four-way election involved all ACT party members (although the election remained only "indicative"). Many people consider{{who|date=April 2012}} that the party organisation, in which Douglas has considerable influence, dislikes Hide.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Hide campaigned against [[Stephen Franks]], [[Ken Shirley]], and [[Muriel Newman]] for the ACT party parliamentary leadership. In the race he claimed that his high public profile and his image of strength would prove crucial to ACT's political survival. Stephen Franks, seen as the primary "anti-Hide" candidate and a social conservative, had the backing of [[Roger Douglas]]. In the end, however, Hide prevailed, and the party introduced Hide as its new leader on 13 June 2004.

Under Hide's leadership, the vote in the September 2005 elections severely reduced ACT's party parliamentary representation. ACT's share of the party vote dropped from over 7% of the total in {{NZ election link year|2002}} to around 1.5%; its representation in Parliament fell from nine MPs to two. Despite this reduction, the party remained in parliament due to Hide winning the [[Epsom (New Zealand electorate)|Epsom seat]]. As a consequence of its reduced share of the vote, ACT received a significant cut in taxpayer-funded Parliamentary resourcing and Hide shifted his electorate office in [[Remuera]] to [[Newmarket, New Zealand|Newmarket]], the same location as that of ACT's head office.

As a post-election strategy, Rodney Hide focused on his high-profile attacks on prominent [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] MPs. His campaign against alleged abuse of schoolchildren by Labour Party minister [[David Benson-Pope]], which was verified by the now grown children involved, continued to make headlines in late 2005.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} In 2006, Hide voiced speculation on the leadership cadre of the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] (then led by [[Don Brash]]), a strategy which gained him headlines but complicated the once co-operative relationship between ACT and National.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===''Dancing with the Stars''===
In 2006, Hide appeared as a contestant in the [[celebrity]]-based ''[[Dancing with the Stars (New Zealand TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]'' [[television]] series, in which he, paired with a professional dancer, competing against other celebrities. Funds raised through his performance went to [[St. John Ambulance|St John's Ambulance]]. Hide stated that he appeared on the show as a personal challenge, having never danced before, and despite harsh criticism from the show's judges placed fourth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&amp;objectid=10386144|title=Hide out after he drops his partner|last=McNaughton|first=Maggie|date=2006-06-11|work=NZ Herald|access-date=2017-12-08|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ACT in Government===
At the {{NZ election link|2008}}, Hide retained his Epsom seat;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.dia.govt.nz/MSOS118/On-Line/NZGazette.nsf/6cee7698a9bbc7cfcc256d510059ed0b/67778912aca129b7cc25750f0047aeb5!OpenDocument 2008 General Election Results of the Official Count]" (22&amp;nbsp;November&amp;nbsp;2008) 180 ''[[The New&amp;nbsp;Zealand Gazette]]'' 4649.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://2008.electionresults.govt.nz/electorate-12.html Epsom results 2008.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211164738/http://2008.electionresults.govt.nz/electorate-12.html |date=11 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with a subsequent rise in party popularity, ACT increased its representation in parliament from two seats to five.&lt;ref&gt;[http://2008.electionresults.govt.nz/partystatus.html Election results 2008.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209051141/http://2008.electionresults.govt.nz/partystatus.html |date=9 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] won the most seats and formed a [[minority government]] with the support of ACT, the [[Māori Party]] and [[United Future]]. Hide was appointed as a Minister outside [[Cabinet (politics)|Cabinet]]&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.dia.govt.nz/MSOS118/On-Line/NZGazette.nsf/6cee7698a9bbc7cfcc256d510059ed0b/f0b26c54c2b6dd0ecc25750f00477759!OpenDocument Members of Executive Council Appointed]" (19&amp;nbsp;November 2008) 179 [[The New Zealand Gazette]] 4634&lt;/ref&gt; and was appointed to the office of the Minister of Local Government, Minister for Regulatory Reform and Associate Minister of Commerce.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.dia.govt.nz/MSOS118/On-Line/NZGazette.nsf/6cee7698a9bbc7cfcc256d510059ed0b/8155efb9e8df9c7ecc25750f0047784d!OpenDocument Appointment of Ministers]" (19&amp;nbsp;November 2008) 179 [[The New Zealand Gazette]] 4635.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main focuses of Hide's work in cabinet was the [[Auckland Council|Auckland 'Super City']] proposal for unification of the various local authorities of [[Auckland]]. This initiative was started by the [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand|then-Labour government]] in 2007, which set up a [[Royal Commission on Auckland Governance|Royal Commission]] to investigate the local government arrangements in the Auckland region.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.stuff.co.nz/0a11.html4147429a11.html Auckland governance inquiry welcomed]'' – [[NZPA]], via 'stuff.co.nz', Tuesday 31 July 2007. Retrieved 29 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission reported back in 2009, but Hide and Prime Minister [[John Key]] announced that several of the Commission's recommendations would not be accepted. In particular, the proposed six district sub-councils would be replaced by a local structure of 20-30 community boards. The recommendation to have separate concept Maori representation was also not accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10565730|title=Super City: More regional representation, but less power|work=The New Zealand Herald|date=8 April 2009|first=Bernard|last=Orsman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hide faced criticism from various parties over the local authority amalgamation. Issues of satellite city boundaries, assets, financing &amp; political consolidation were raised by [[North Shore City]] mayor [[Andrew Williams (New Zealand politician)|Andrew Williams]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10571023|title=''Andrew Williams:'' Downsize this Super City madness|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=8 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10566362|title=Banks calls Williams a lunatic as Super City debate gets ugly|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=13 April 2009|first=Bernard|last=Orsman}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, the Labour Party accused Hide of mismanaging the Auckland reform process and criticised Hide's advocacy of privatising council assets and services. Labour also alleged that a bad process had led to the centralisation of power in the hands of a privileged few.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0909/S00062.htm|title=Super city Bill flawed and undemocratic|date=4 September 2009|publisher=[[New Zealand Labour Party]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, a ''New Zealand Herald'' editorial made five further criticisms of Hide's implementation of the 'super city' amalgamation: 
#Hide had a bad track record of consultation in the design of the single city,
#He was plainly driven by his ideological agenda,
#He had threatened to resign if the Prime Minister acceded to a strong call for Maori seats,
#He had ignored concerns about the lack of power of local boards, and,
#as much as 90 per cent of services were to be run by seven Government-appointed boards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|work=New Zealand Herald 
|date= 14 March 2010
|accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite these criticisms, the amalgamation went ahead and the first [[Auckland local elections, 2010|Auckland Council elections]] were held in 2010.

===Leadership questioned===
In November 2009, a special ACT-party caucus meeting was held to discuss the Hide's position as party leader, where he was chosen to be retained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&amp;objectid=10616488|title=Key steps in to save Hide's Act job|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|first=Audrey|last=Young|date=19 December 2009|accessdate=30 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 April 2011, he resigned as leader of ACT after a successful challenge from former National leader Don Brash.&lt;ref name="3news" /&gt; Hide indicated to Brash he would not be standing in the [[New Zealand general election, 2011|2011 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10723116|publisher=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|title=Hide won't contest general election|date=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he left parliament he chose not to give a valedictory speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/5753063/Parliaments-heavy-hitter-bids-adieu/ |title=Parliament’s heavy hitter bids adieu|date=8 October 2011 |accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political views==

===Perk busting===
Hide was criticised in November 2009 for taking his girlfriend [[Louise Crome]] on a tax-payer funded private holiday to Hawaii and on a tax-payer funded trip to London, Canada and the United States. He repaid the money for the Hawaii trip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/3041488/Rodney-Hides-other-holiday-perk|title=Rodney Hide's other holiday perk|work=[[New Zealand Press Association]]|date=7 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/3013709/Hide-against-travel-perk-but-still-used-it|title=Hide against travel perk, but still used it|work=[[New Zealand Press Association]]|date=30 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These allegations were particularly notable given Hide's history as a self-styled parliamentary perk-buster, particularly in Opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ventner |first=Nick |date=8 October 2011 |title=Parliament's heavy hitter bids adieu |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/5753063/Parliaments-heavy-hitter-bids-adieu |newspaper=Dominion Post |location=Wellington |accessdate=22 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate change===
As ACT leader, Hide criticised Labour's [[Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2008|emissions trading scheme]] in September 2008 and said climate change and global warming were a "hoax". He said that the data and the hypothesis did not hold together, and that the legislation would drive up the cost of basic goods, ruining businesses and farmers.&lt;ref name="NBR_34754"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/climate-change-bill-attacked-parliament-34754 |title=Climate Change Bill attacked in Parliament |date=2 September 2008 |author=NZPA |work=National Business Review |accessdate=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hide stated ''"the entire climate change - global warming hypothesis is a hoax, that the data and the hypothesis do not hold together, that Al Gore is a phoney and a fraud on this issue, and that the emissions trading scheme is a worldwide scam and swindle"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=Ditch fruitcake views on climate change 
|publisher=The New Zealand Herald 
|accessdate=3 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, in a speech to Parliament, Hide compared government-funded climate science to the Spanish inquisition. He also accused the [[National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research]] of being involved in a scandal with its temperature data and claimed that its scientific credibility was shredded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate= 21 August 2012
|quote=Government sponsored climate science has proved to have more in common with the Spanish inquisition than Popperian science
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Hide continued to write opinion articles in the press questioning climate science and emissions trading schemes. In the National Business Review, Hide claimed that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report in 2007 was 'infamously wrong' and contained schoolboy errors and had been written by people who had to 'believe the human-induced global warming nonsense before they start'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|date=30 July 2012 
|accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Herald, Hide said that the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) is a 'scam and a waste'. Hide agreed that CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from fossil fuels is a greenhouse gas that has caused warming, but that the warming wasn't worrying until the effect had been multiplied with computer models that are programmed to cause scary climate change.

==Life after Parliament==
In December 2011 Hide was granted the right to retain the title of [[The Honourable#New Zealand|The Honourable]]&lt;ref&gt;"''[http://www.dia.govt.nz/MSOS118/On-Line/NZGazette.nsf/6cee7698a9bbc7cfcc256d510059ed0b/33d0bbbd1645dd94cc25796e00557620!OpenDocument Retention of the Title ‘The Honourable’]''" (15 December 2011) 200 [[The New Zealand Gazette]] 5729.&lt;/ref&gt; in recognition of his term as a Member of the Executive Council of New Zealand. He was also appointed a [[Queen's Service Order|Companion of the Queen's Service Order]] in the [[2013 New Year Honours (New Zealand)|2013 New Year Honours]], for services as a member of Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.dpmc.govt.nz/publications/new-year-honours-list-2013 | title=New Year honours list 2013|date=31 December 2012 | publisher=Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet | accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hide wrote a political column for the ''New Zealand Herald'' for a time, and has also worked as a casual labourer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hill |first=Marika |date=1 July 2012 |title=Rodney Hide's still raking muck |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/politics/7201187/Rodney-Hides-still-raking-muck |newspaper=Dominion Post |location=Wellington |accessdate=22 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Following news of [[Operation Yewtree]] in Britain and the subsequent trial of Australian entertainer [[Rolf Harris]], a member of the [[New Zealand Parliament]], [[Maggie Barry]], described a groping by Harris during a studio interview she conducted in her previous broadcasting career.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11287467 Maggie Barry: I was groped by Rolf Harris]".

'''''Smoking and Health: Report of the Advisory Committee to the Surgeon General of the United States''''' was a landmark report published on January 11, 1964 by the Surgeon General's Advisory Committee on Smoking and Health, chaired by the then [[Surgeon General of the United States]], Dr. [[Luther Terry|Luther Leonidas Terry]], M.D., regarding the negative health effects of [[tobacco smoking]].&lt;ref&gt;Terry, Luther et al. Smoking and Health: Report of the Advisory Committee to the Surgeon General of the United States. U-23 Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Public Health Service Publication No. 1103. 1964 May be downloaded from: https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/retrieve/ResourceMetadata/NNBBMQ&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was not the first such declaration, or the first declaration by an official of the [[United States of America]], it is notable for being arguably the most famous such declaration, and it has certainly had lasting and widespread effects both on the [[tobacco industry]] and on the worldwide perception of smoking.

== Background ==
The [[health effects of tobacco]] had been debated by users, medical experts, and governments alike since its introduction to European culture.&lt;ref name="nlm"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/NN/Views/Exhibit/narrative/smoking.html|title=The Reports of the Surgeon General|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hard evidence for the ill effects of smoking became apparent with the results of several long-term studies conducted in the early to middle twentieth century, such as the epidemiology studies of [[Richard Doll]] and pathology studies of [[Oscar Auerbach]]. On June 12, 1957, then-Surgeon General [[Leroy Edgar Burney|Leroy Burney]] "declared it the official position of the U.S. Public Health Service that the evidence pointed to a causal relationship between smoking and lung cancer."&lt;ref name="nlm" /&gt; A committee of the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Royal College of Physicians]] issued a report on March 7, 1962&lt;ref name="Smoking and health 50 years on from landmark report (includes 1962 footage)"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-17264442 | work=BBC News | title=Smoking and health 50 years on from landmark report | date=March 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which "clearly indicted cigarette smoking as a cause of lung cancer and bronchitis" and argued that "it probably contributed to cardiovascular disease as well."&lt;ref name="hhs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/about/previous/bioterry.htm|title=Luther Leonidas Terry (1961-1965)|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916014247/http://surgeongeneral.gov/about/previous/bioterry.htm|archivedate=2008-09-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After pressure from the [[American Cancer Society]], the [[American Heart Association]], the [[National Tuberculosis Association]], and the [[American Public Health Association]], [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] authorized Surgeon General Terry's creation of the Advisory Committee. The committee met from November 1962 to January 1964 and analyzed over 7,000 scientific articles and papers.

== Findings ==
The report's conclusions were almost entirely focused on the negative health effects of cigarette smoking. It found:
* cigarette smokers had a seventy percent increase in age-corrected mortality rate
* cigarette smoke was the primary cause of chronic bronchitis
* a correlation between smoking, emphysema, and heart disease.
In addition, it reported:
* a causative link between smoking and a ten- to twenty-fold increase in the occurrence of lung cancer
* a positive correlation between [[Smoking and pregnancy|pregnant women who smoke]] and underweight newborns.&lt;ref name="nlm" /&gt;

As did the World Health Organization during this period, but possibly influenced by the fact that they were all smokers themselves,&lt;ref name="whyquit"&gt;{{cite AV media|people=[[Joel Spitzer]]|title=The Surgeon General says ...|url=http://whyquit.com/videos/addiction2_bb64Kbps.mp3|publisher=WhyQuit.com|accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Committee defined cigarette smoking as a "habituation" rather than an overpowering "addiction."&lt;ref name="whyquit" /&gt; Committee members agreed with most Americans that this habit (though often strong) was possible for individuals to break.&lt;br&gt;In the years that followed the Surgeon General's report, millions of Americans successfully chose to quit smoking, with two-thirds to three-quarters of ex-smokers quitting unaided by [[smoking cessation|nicotine replacement methods]]. In addition, the "cold turkey," or sudden-and-rapid-cessation, method has been found to be the most successful in terms stopping smoking over long periods of time.&lt;ref name=unassisted&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Global Research Neglect of Unassisted Smoking Cessation: Causes and Consequences|author1=Chapman, Simon  |author2=MacKenzie, Ross|date=February 9, 2010|journal=PLoS Medicine|publisher=Public Library of Science|url=http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1000216|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000216|pmid=20161722|volume=7|issue=2|pages=e1000216|pmc=2817714}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a controversial move in 1989, a later Surgeon General, Dr. [[C. Everett Koop]], M.D., shifted course and redefined cigarette smoking as "an addiction" rather than a habit.&lt;ref name="sullum"&gt;{{cite book | last=Sullum | first=Jacob | title=For Your Own Good: The Anti-Cigarette Crusade and the Tyranny of Public Health| edition=First | pages=234–235| location=Urbana | publisher=The Free Press | year=1998 |isbn=978-0-684-82736-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects ==

The report's publication had wide effects across the United States and the world. It was deliberately published on a Saturday to minimize the negative effect on the American stock markets, while maximizing the coverage in Sunday newspapers.&lt;ref name="nlm" /&gt; The release of the report was one of the top news stories of 1964. It led to policy and public opinion changes such as the '''Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act of 1965''' and the '''Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969,''' which mandated warning labels on cigarettes and instituted a ban on the broadcasting of cigarette advertisements on radio and/or television.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/sgr/history/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Culture of the Soviet Union}}
'''Soviet people''' ({{lang-rus|Сове́тский наро́д|r=Sovétsky naród}})&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-uk|Радянський народ}}, ''Radyasky narod''; {{lang-be|Савецкі народ}}, ''Savetski narod''; {{lang-kk|Совет халқы}}, ''Sovet halqy''; {{lang-az|Sovet xalqı}}, ''Sovet khalqı''); {{lang-ka|საბჭოთა ხალხი}}, ''sabchot'a khalkh''; {{lang-hy|Խորհրդային մարդիկ}}, ''Khorhrdayin mardik''&lt;/ref&gt; or '''citizens of the USSR''' ({{lang-rus|Гра́ждане СССР|Grázhdane SSSR}}) or the Shrimp was an [[Umbrella term|umbrella]] [[demonym]] (politonym) for the population of the [[Soviet Union]]. Initially used as a nonspecific reference to the Soviet population, it was eventually declared to be a "new historical, social and international unity of people".{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

==Nationality politics in the early Soviet Union==
[[File:1950 июл Померки дет лагерь.jpg|thumb|220px|Pomerki child sanatory in [[Kharkov]]. Summer 1950]]

Through the [[history of the Soviet Union]], both doctrine and practice regarding ethnic distinctions within the Soviet population varied over time. Minority national cultures were not completely abolished in the Soviet Union. By Soviet definition, national cultures were to be "[[socialist]] by content and national by form", to be used to promote the official aims and values of the state. While the goal was always to cement the nationalities together in a common state structure, as a pragmatic step in the 1920s and early 1930s under the policy of [[korenizatsiya]] (indigenization) the leaders of the Communist Party promoted federalism and the strengthening of non-Russian languages and cultures (see [[national delimitation in the Soviet Union]]).  By the late 1930s, however, policy shifted to more active promotion of Russian language and later still to more overt [[Russification]] efforts, which accelerated in the 1950s{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} especially in areas of [[Education in the Soviet Union|public education]]. Although some assimilation did occur, this effort did not succeed on the whole as evidenced by developments in many national cultures in the territory after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara A. Anderson and Brian D. Silver, "Some Factors in the Linguistic and Ethnic Russification of Soviet Nationalities: Is Everyone Becoming Russian?" in Lubomyr Hajda and Mark Beissinger, Eds., ''The Nationality Factor in Soviet Politics and Society'' (Boulder: Westview, 1990): 95-130.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reinforcing the distinctions in national identities, the Soviet state maintained information about "nationality" on many administrative records, including school, work, and military records, as well as in the periodic censuses of population.  The "fifth record" ({{lang-rus|пя́тая графа́|r=pyátaya grafá}}) was the section of the obligatory [[Passport system in the Soviet Union|internal passport]] document which stated the citizen's ethnicity ({{lang-rus|национа́льность|r=natsionál'nost'}}).

==Soviet people as a political concept ==
[[Nikita Khrushchev]] had used the term in his speech at the [[22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|22nd Communist Party Congress]] in 1961, when he declared that in the USSR there had formed a new historical community of people of diverse nationalities, having common characteristics—the Soviet people.

The [[24th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] finalized this definition. This single all-Soviet entity—the Soviet people, Sovietskiy narod—was attributed many of the characteristics that official doctrine had formerly ascribed to nations ({{Lang-rus|на́ции|r=nátsii}}) and nationalities ({{Lang-rus|национа́льности|r=natsionál'nosti}}) composing the multi-national Soviet state. The "Soviet people" were said to be a "new historical, social, and international community of people having a common territory, economy, and socialist content; a culture that reflected the particularities of multiple nationalities; a federal state; and a common ultimate goal: the construction of communism."

According to the [[Russian Census (2010)|2010 Russian Census]] 27,000 Russians identified themselves as members of the Soviet people.

The '''Surveyor General of the Northwest Territory''' was a [[United States]] government official responsible for surveying land in the [[Northwest Territory]] in the [[United States]] late in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century. The position was created in the [[Land Act of 1796]]&lt;ref&gt;{{USStat|1|464}} - Text of Act of May 18, 1796 [[Library of Congress]]&lt;/ref&gt; to survey lands ceded by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]] northwest of the [[Ohio River]] and above the mouth of the [[Kentucky River]]. This act, and those that followed evolved into the [[Public Land Survey System]].

[[Rufus Putnam]] was appointed to the office in 1797, and held it until 1803. His office was in [[Marietta, Ohio|Marietta]].{{sfn|White|p=218}} In 1801, the position was offered to [[Andrew Ellicott]] by [[Thomas Jefferson]], but he refused, because he was upset at slow pay for work he had done for the Federal Government.{{sfn|Mathews 1908|p=204-206}} [[Jared Mansfield]] held the office from 1803 to 1813. His office was in [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]].{{sfn|White|p=218}} [[Josiah Meigs]] held office 1813 to 1815,{{sfn|Williamson 1880|p=170-171}} and [[Edward Tiffin]] from 1815 to his death in 1829.{{sfn|Stewart 1935|p=43}} Tiffin had his office in [[Chillicothe, Ohio|Chillicothe]].{{sfn|White|p=218}} The Surveyor General of Illinois office was created on April 29, 1816, reducing effective area to [[Ohio]], [[Indiana]] and [[Michigan]].{{sfn|White|p=203}} [[Lytle family#William Lytle|William Lytle]] served 1829 until his death in 1831.{{sfn|Howe 1907|p=416}} He moved the office back to Cincinnati.{{sfn|White|p=218}} [[Micajah T. Williams]] held the office 1831 to 1834, when [[Robert Todd Lytle]] took over. [[Ezekiel S. Haines]] was appointed in 1838.{{sfn|Greve 1904|p=673}} [[William Johnston (judge)|Judge William Johnston]] held the office 1841-1845 as thanks for his efforts in supporting the [[United States Whig Party|Whig]] ticket in 1840.{{sfn|Greve 1904|p=771}}{{sfn|Nelson &amp; Runk 1894|p=186-187}}{{sfn|Hunter 1900|p=208-209}} [[Lucius Lyon]] was appointed in 1845, and moved his office to [[Detroit]].{{sfn|White|p=218}} In June, 1845, the Ohio and Indiana offices were closed, and subsequent surveys were made under the [[List of Commissioners of the General Land Office|Commissioner of the General Land Office]].{{sfn|White|p=204, 218}} The Surveyor General was initially paid $2000 per year, and his deputies were paid three dollars per mile surveyed.{{sfn|Stewart 1935|p=37}} 

Putnam was occupied in 1797 with laying off the [[Greenville Treaty Line]] and surveying the [[United States Military District]] and [[Moravian Indian Grants]], and he started the survey of [[Congress Lands]] in 1798.{{sfn|Treat 1910|p=93}}

Mansfield is credited with "considerable scientific ability and high standards of workmanship."{{sfn|Stewart 1935|p=38-40}} He laid out astronomically the [[Indiana]] [[Baseline (surveying)|baseline]] and [[Second Principal Meridian]], in spite of the difficulties. Pressures on him are illustrated in a letter [[Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Albert Gallatin]] wrote to Mansfield: "The new act (March 13, 1805) is intended to palliate errors made in surveys north of the Ohio. At four dollars per mile, great correctness cannot be attained in that part of the country. Do your best at that price. Congress desires that corners and boundaries be definitely fixed, and the precise content of each is not equally important. A few acres more or less is not so important as it is that corners and boundaries should be known with precision to avoid litigation. It is of primary importance that the land should be surveyed and subdivided."{{sfn|Stewart 1935|p=38-40}}

Tiffin established the scheme of [[List of principal and guide meridians and base lines of the United States|guide meridians]] and [[standard parallel]]s for townships distant from the principal meridians and baselines, which became a feature of the Public Land Survey System.{{sfn|Stewart 1935|p=44}}

On March 3, 1803,&lt;ref&gt;{{USStat|2|229}} - Text of act of March 3, 1803 (section 10) [[Library of Congress]]&lt;/ref&gt; a Surveyor General position was created for lands south of [[Tennessee]], and there followed a number of similar positions over the next years. In 1822, the first surveying district was created, namely the state of [[Ohio]], with an officer called Surveyor-General in charge.{{sfn|Williamson 1880|p=170-171}}

Until the reorganization of the [[General Land Office]] in 1836, each Surveyor General acted more or less independently, setting his own standards for execution of field work.{{sfn|Stewart 1935|p=41}}

'''The Israel-Kurdistan Friendship League''', possibly the first friendship association between Jews and Israelis and Muslim community in an Arab country was established in 1994 in Jerusalem, Israel, by several Israeli and Jewish activists of Kurdish origin or interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://israeli-kurdish-friendship-league.blogspot.co.il/|title=Israeli-Kurdish Friendship League|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Izreʿel |first1=Shlomo |last2=Drory |first2=Rina |year=1995 |title=Language and Culture in the Near East |publisher=BRILL |page=222 |isbn=9789004104570}}&lt;/ref&gt; http://library.columbia.edu/locations/global/virtual-libraries/middle_east_studies/minorities.html The founder was Mordechai Zaken&lt;ref&gt; https://books.google.com/books?id=CRESBLDde88C&amp;pg=PA36 Jump up ^ Jewish Subjects and their Tribal Chieftains in Kurdistan: A Study in Survival, in Jewish Identities in a Changing World, vol. 9 (Leiden and Boston: Brill, 2007; "Revised and Second digitel E-Book dition, Jews of Kurdistan and their Chieftains, By Mordechai (Moti) Zaken, 2015"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sharpe |first1=J.

The response of Kurdish representatives and organizations both in Kurdistan and the diaspora was enthusiastic as can be judged from hundreds of letters, phone calls and also email received in Jerusalem within short time after the announcement of its founding in the world press and in The Voice of America in the Kurdish language, which conducted interviews with the founder, Mordechai Zaken. The League also published a newsletter called yedidut (heb., friendship) carrying the message of Israeli and Jewish friendship to Kurds worldwide.[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:YEDIDUT_Israeli-Kurdistan_Friendship-League_1993.pdf This is the newsletter called "YEDIDUT" (Hebrew, "Friendship") initiated by the main activists of the Israeli-Kurdistan Friendship League and sent to Kurdish activists and organizations worldwide.

The '''Union for French Democracy''' ({{lang-fr|Union pour la Démocratie Française}}, '''UDF''') was a [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]] [[list of political parties in France|political party in France]]. It was founded in 1978 as an [[electoral alliance]] to support President [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]] in order to counterbalance the [[Gaullism|Gaullist]] preponderance over the [[right-wing politics|political right]] in [[France]]. This name was chosen due to the title of Giscard d'Estaing's 1976 book, ''Démocratie Française''. The party brought together [[Christian democracy|Christian democrats]], [[Liberalism|liberals]] and [[Liberalism and radicalism in France|radicals]],&lt;ref name="Sauger2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicolas Sauger|chapter=The UDF in the 1990s: the break-up of a political confederation|editor=Jocelyn Evans|title=The French Party System|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a_ojgq8HABUC&amp;pg=PA107|year=2003|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-6120-2|pages=107–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and non-[[Gaullism|Gaullist]] conservatives,&lt;ref name="Bell2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=David S.

The founding parties of the UDF were Giscard's [[Republican Party (France)|Republican Party]] (PR), the [[Centre of Social Democrats]] (CDS), the [[Radical Party (France)|Radical Party]] (Rad.), the [[Social Democratic Party (France)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD) and the [[Perspectives and Realities Clubs]] (CPR). The UDF was most frequently a junior partner in coalitions with the Gaullist [[Rally for the Republic]] (RPR) and its successor party, the [[Union for a Popular Movement]] (UMP). Prior to its dissolution, the UDF became a single entity, due to the defection of Republicans, Radicals and most Christian Democrats to the UMP and the merger of the other centrist components. The UDF effectively ceased to exist by the end of 2007, and its membership and assets were transferred to its successor party, the [[Democratic Movement (France)|Democratic Movement]] (MoDem). The UDF's final leader was [[François Bayrou]], who transferred his leadership to MoDem.

==History==

===Foundation and early years===
In 1974, [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]] was elected [[President of France]]. Two years later, his [[Gaullism|Gaullist]] Prime Minister [[Jacques Chirac]] resigned and created the [[Rally for the Republic]] (RPR) in order to restore the Gaullist domination over the republican institutions. Formally, this party stood in the right-wing parliamentary majority, but it criticised with virulence the policies of the executive duo composed of President Giscard d'Estaing and Prime Minister [[Raymond Barre]].

During campaigning for the [[French legislative election, 1978|1978 legislative election]], in his [[Verdun-sur-le-Doubs]] speech, President Giscard d'Estaing noted that the political leanings of the French people were divided among four groups: the Communists ([[French Communist Party|PCF]]), the Socialists ([[Socialist Party (France)|PS]]), the Neo-Gaullists ([[Rally for the Republic|RPR]]) and his own followers. He therefore sought to formally organise a political grouping which would represent the position of his followers. Consequently, the UDF confederation was born.

Contrary to the Neo-Gaullists, the Giscardian UDF advocated less [[economic interventionism]] by the state, the [[decentralization|decentralisation]] in aid of the local authorities, and a strong commitment towards the building of a [[federal Europe]]. According to the historian [[René Rémond]], the UDF descended from the [[Orléanist|Orleanist]] tradition of the right, whereas the RPR was a reincarnation of the [[Bonapartism|Bonapartist]] tradition, which promotes national independence by virtue of a strong state.

After the right (the RPR and UDF) won the [[French legislative election, 1978|1978 legislative election]] and the subsequent focus of both groups towards the [[French presidential election, 1981|1981 presidential campaign]], the relations between the two parties of the parliamentary majority deteriorated. Indeed, RPR leader Jacques Chirac criticized the market-oriented and [[pro-Europeanism|pro-European]] policy of the executive duo. During the [[European Parliament election, 1979 (France)|1979 European electoral campaign]], Chirac published the [[Call of Cochin]] where the UDF was accused of being "the foreign party". As the UDF list, led by [[Simone Veil]], obtained a very good result compared with RPR's score, the quarrels between the two parties and the rivalry between Giscard d'Estaing and Chirac contributed, in 1981, to the defeat of the incumbent UDF president who ran for a second term.

===The Eighties===
After the election of [[François Mitterrand]] as president, the two centre-right parliamentary parties reconciled. Gradually, the RPR abandoned Gaullist doctrine and joined the market-oriented and pro-European positions of the UDF. Although, they presented a common list at the [[European Parliament election, 1984 (France)|1984 European Parliament election]], their leaders Chirac and Barre competed for the leadership of the French centre-right. Focused on winning the [[French legislative election, 1986|1986 legislative election]], Chirac, unlike Barre, accepted the principle of "[[cohabitation (government)|cohabitation]]" with President Mitterrand. Furthermore, some UDF politicians (notably from the Republican Party) covertly supported Chirac. Consequently, he became [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]], from 1986 to 1988, and the UDF played a supporting role in his cabinet and in the parliamentary majority.

Barre was a candidate in the [[French presidential election, 1988|1988 presidential election]], yet, despite his popularity, he was not supported by all UDF personalities. Giscard d'Estaing himself refused to choose clearly and publicly between his two former Prime Ministers. Eliminated in the first round, Barre called on his supporters to vote for Chirac in the second round, but despite this, Chirac was defeated by Mitterrand. After the re-election of Mitterrand, some UDF members participated as ministers in the [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] cabinets of [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] [[Michel Rocard]]. Others created a new parliamentary group, the [[Centrist Union]], which occasionally voted with the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] or with the RPR.

For Giscard d'Estaing, Barre's failure to strengthen the UDF, allowed him retake the leadership of the UDF. However, his authority, and that of the other right-wing leaders (Chirac, Barre etc.) was contested by a new generation of politicians called the "renovation men", who accused the old guard leadership of bearing responsibility for the electoral defeats of the right.

===The Nineties===
In 1991, the dismissal of Rocard caused the departure of the centrist ministers from the government. All of the UDF and the RPR were allied in opposition to the Socialist power which was weakened by the economic crisis, scandals, and internal quarrels. The RPR/UDF coalition named "[[Union for France]]" comfortably won the [[French legislative election, 1993|1993 legislative election]] and obtained a massive majority in the National Assembly. The new Neo-Gaullist Prime Minister [[Edouard Balladur]] nominated a large number of UDF members to his cabinet: [[François Léotard]] (PR) became minister of Defense, [[Gérard Longuet]] (PR) of Industry, [[Pierre Méhaignerie]] (CDS) of Justice, [[François Bayrou]] (CDS) of Education, [[Simone Veil]] (PR) of Health and Social Affairs, [[Alain Madelin]] (PR) of Commerce, [[Bernard Bosson]] (CDS) of Transport, [[Jean Puech]] (CDS) of Agriculture, [[André Rossinot]] (Rad) of Civil Service and [[Hervé de Charette]] (CPR) of Housing.

During the [[French presidential election, 1995|1995 presidential campaign]] the different components of the UDF were unable to agree on a common candidacy and consequently they divided between the two RPR candidates. Most UDF members supported [[Edouard Balladur]], whereas a minority endorsed [[Jacques Chirac]], as [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]] had proposed. Supporters of Giscard formed the [[Popular Party for French Democracy]] (PPDF), that succeeded to the [[Perspectives and Realities Clubs]], while the CDS merged with the PSD into [[Democratic Force (France)|Democratic Force]] (FD). In 1996 a former ''balladurien'', [[François Léotard]], was elected President of the UDF by defeating [[Alain Madelin]].

After Chirac's election as [[President of France]], some UDF ministers were dismissed as a result of their support for Balladur. Nevertheless, in [[Alain Juppé]]'s cabinet, the UDF was given several ministries including Foreign Affairs with [[Hervé de Charette]] (PPDF), Defense with [[Charles Millon]] (PR), Economy and Finances with Alain Madelin (PR), Industry with [[Yves Galland]] (Rad), Education with François Bayrou (CDS/FD), Commerce with [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]] (PR), Labour with [[Jacques Barrot]] (CDS/FD), Agriculture with [[Philippe Vasseur]] (CDS/FD), Culture with [[Philippe Douste-Blazy]] (CDS/FD), Economic Development with [[Jean Arthuis]] (PR) and Reform and Decentralization with [[Claude Goasguen]] (PR).

After the right-wing defeat in the [[French legislative election, 1997|1997 legislative election]], the UDF faced a major crisis. While the centrist components had merged into FD led by [[François Bayrou]], the liberal-conservatives tried to overcome the ''chiraquiens''/''balladuriens'' fracture. The PR was joined by some politicians from the PPDF, such as [[Jean Pierre Raffarin]] (a former Republican) and was renamed [[Liberal Democracy (France)|Liberal Democracy]] (DL). DL soon began to reassert its autonomy within the alliance and finally broke ranks with the UDF in 1998. The event which triggered the split was the election of UDF politicians at the head of four regional councils, who won with support from the [[National Front (France)|National Front]]. DL refused to condemn the arrangement, whilst the centrists did.

===New UDF===
This led to a re-organisation of UDF into the New UDF (''Nouvelle UDF''). The new alliance was launched as a single party with the merger of FD and the [[Republican Independent and Liberal Pole]] (PRIL, formed in 1998 by those DL members who refused to leave UDF). The Radicals and the PPDF remained as autonomous entities within the new party.

The former leader of Democratic Force, [[François Bayrou]] became the natural leader of the New UDF. He conceived of it as the embryo of a future centrist party which would include politicians from both the left and right. Bayrou ran for president in the [[French presidential election, 2002|2002 presidential election]], but some UDF leaders supported Chirac. Chirac won reelection comfortably, with Bayrou being eliminated after the first round, having gained only 6.8% of the vote. Bayrou subsequently refused Chirac's invitation to his group, to join the newly forimed [[centre-right]] [[big tent|catch-all]] party, the [[Union for a Popular Movement]] (UMP) for the oncoming [[French legislative election, 2002|June 2002 parliamentary elections]]. Other UDF members, led by [[Philippe Douste-Blazy]], [[Jacques Barrot]] and [[Pierre Méhaignerie]], joined the UMP, leaving Bayrou somewhat isolated.

Post-election, the UDF joined the victorious centre-right grouping as a partner in the cabinet of prime minister [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]]. Despite this, the UDF sometimes criticised the policies of the French government, although it did not wish to quit the majority coalition and enter the opposition, which was made up mostly of centre-left and left-wing parties. Subsequently, the UDF quit the cabinet (except for [[Gilles de Robien]]), after a cabinet reshuffle on 31 March 2004, but still decided to remain in the parliamentary majority coalition.

In 2004, the party, along with Italy's [[Democracy is Freedom – The Daisy]], was one of the founding members of the [[European Democratic Party]], intended to be home to all those Christian democrats and centrists who were disillusioned with the new course of the [[European People's Party]], which had welcomed the [[Rally for the Republic]] and later the UMP. With the exit of the most conservative, Christian-democratic and conservative-liberal components of the UDF in 1998 and 2002, the UDF was now more of a centrist party with socially liberal tendencies.

There developed a split among UDF elected officials, between those such as Gilles de Robien and [[Pierre-Christophe Baguet]], who favored closer ties with the UMP, and those such as François Bayrou who advocate independent centrist policies, while others such as [[Jean Dionis du Séjour]] tried steering for a middle course.&lt;ref&gt;[http://francepolitique.free.fr/PUDF4.htm France politique - courants UDF].&lt;/ref&gt; The most likely reason for many of the UDF's elected officials favouring close ties with the UMP was that most of the UDF's elected positions are obtained through cooperative alliances with UMP. However, the party's base overwhelmingly favored independence. At the congress of Lyon, on 28–29 January 2006, 91% of the members voted to retain the independence of the UDF from the UMP and transform it into an independent centrist party. This outcome meant that the orientation of the evolving UDF would be that of a [[social liberalism|social-liberal]] party aiming for a balance between [[social democracy|social-democratic]] and [[conservatism|conservative]] policies.

===Democratic Movement===
On 16 May 2006, François Bayrou and his 10 other UDF deputies voted for the motion of censure brought by the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist]] deputies calling for the resignation of Prime Minister [[Dominique de Villepin]]'s government, following the [[Clearstream affair]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/12/scrutins/jo0978.asp ANALYSE DU SCRUTIN N° 978 - Séance du 16 mai 2006].&lt;/ref&gt; This motion had no chance of being passed, given that UMP had an absolute majority in the Assembly. Following this event, France's television authority then classified Bayrou and the other UDF deputies who had voted for the motion as being in the opposition for time allocation purposes; however, after Bayrou protested, he was classified as neither [[majority government|majority]] nor [[opposition (politics)|opposition]].

On 25 April 2007, François Bayrou announced that he would be submitting a plan to a vote by UDF members to create a new [[Democratic Movement (France)|Democratic Movement]], which was finally launched on 10 May. However, most of the UDF's deputies protested and formed the [[New Centre]] (to support [[Nicolas Sarkozy]]). In the subsequent legislative elections held in June, the MoDem won only 3 seats (but 7.6% of the vote) whilst its New Centre rivals won 22 seats (but only 2.4%).

On 30 November 2007, the UDF effectively ceased to exist, and was fully integrated within the [[Democratic Movement (France)|Democratic Movement]], headed by [[François Bayrou]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Bayrou enterre l'UDF et célèbre la naissance du MoDem, ''Le Monde'', 1 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology and political position==
UDF's most marked political trait was that it was in favor of European [[federalism]], up to the point of turning the [[European Union]] into the [[United States of Europe]]. In that respect, UDF was the likely target of Chirac's [[Call of Cochin]] (1978), in which he denounced the pro-European policies of "the party of the foreigners".

Until 2002, the UDF spanned a somewhat wide ideological spectrum on the centre-right. A [[tongue-in-cheek]] characterisation of UDF's membership is that it was the union of everybody on the right that was neither [[far-right politics|far-right]] nor a Chirac supporter. However, the UDF suffered for its lack of cohesion, in contrast to the RPR. The economic policies proposed by UDF's leaders ranged from left-leaning, in favor of [[social justice]], to strongly [[laissez-faire]] economics. Such divergences led the laissez-faire advocates of [[Liberal Democracy (France)|Liberal Democracy]], such as [[Alain Madelin]], to split out of UDF on 16 May 1998. This departure followed the elections of UDF politicians for the presidents of 4 regional councils with the votes of [[National Front (France)|FN]] elects. Indeed, the Liberals refused to condemn these alliances.

Similarly, the social policies ranged from the [[conservatism]] of the likes of [[Christine Boutin]], famously opposed to [[civil union]]s for [[Homosexuality|homosexuals]], to more [[social progressivism|socially progressive]] policies. Boutin was excluded from the UDF because of her strong [[social conservatism]]; in March 2001 she formed the [[Christian Democratic Party (France)|Forum of Social Republicans]], which is now affiliated with [[The Republicans (France)|Les Républicains]].

During the [[French presidential election, 2007|2007 presidential electoral campaign]], [[François Bayrou]] presented himself as a centrist and a social-liberal,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?story_id=8780184 The third man], ''[[The Economist]]'', 1 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; (he even opened the door to gay adoptions&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Bayrou, ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'', 16 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;) proclaiming that if elected, he would "govern beyond the left-right divide".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8853752 Jacques Chirac's poisoned legacy], ''[[The Economist]]'', 16 March 2007, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; He won 18.6% of the vote, but this was not enough for him to reach the second round.

==Factions==
* '''Bayrouistes''', those who wanted the UDF to be independent from UMP: [[Marielle de Sarnez]], [[Jean-Louis Bourlanges]], [[Thierry Cornillet]], [[Gilles Artigues]], [[Bernard Bosson]], [[Anne-Marie Comparini]], [[Charles de Courson]], [[Jean-Christophe Lagarde]], [[Jean Lassalle]], [[Maurice Leroy]], [[Hervé Morin]], [[Rudy Salles]], [[Gérard Vignoble]], [[Nicolas Perruchot]], [[Jean-Luc Préel]], [[François Rochebloine]], [[François Sauvadet]]
* '''Society in Movement''', those who wanted close ties with UMP: [[Gilles de Robien]], [[Olivier Jardé]], [[Jean-Pierre Abelin]], [[Pierre-Christophe Baguet]],&lt;ref&gt;Pierre-Christophe Baguet was expelled from the UDF on 10 October 2006 - [http://archquo.nouvelobs.com/cgi/articles?ad=politique/20061010.OBS5189.html Le député Baguet exclu du groupe UDF]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Dionis du Séjour]], [[Francis Hillmeyer]], [[Michel Hunault]], [[Stéphane Demilly]], [[Yvan Lachaud]], [[André Santini]], [[Francis Vercamer]], [[Claude Leteurtre]], [[Rodolphe Thomas]]

On 10 May 2007, when Bayrou launched his new [[Democratic Movement (France)|Democratic Movement]], only 6 deputies out of 29 (Pierre-Cristophe Baguet is not counted as he was expelled from the party on 10 October 2006) followed him (Gilles Artigues, Anne-Marie Comparini, Jean-Christophe Lagarde, Jean Lassalle, Gérard Vignoble and he himself&lt;ref&gt;[http://francepolitique.free.fr/PUDF2.htm France politique -  chronologie UDF]&lt;/ref&gt;). The others, comprising the members of Society in Movement and also Hervé Morin, Jean-Louis Bourlanges and other Bayrou's supporters until then, joined the presidential majority coalition in support of the new President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] and formed a new "centrist pole" within it, the [[New Centre]] led by Hervé Morin.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Völkisch'' movement}}
{{Populism sidebar}}
{{Nazism sidebar}}

The '''''völkisch'' movement''' ({{lang-de|völkische Bewegung}}, "folkish movement") was the German interpretation of a [[Populism|populist]] movement, with a [[Romanticism|romantic]] focus on [[folklore]] and the "organic", i.e.: a "naturally grown community in unity", characterised by the one-body-metaphor (''Volkskörper'') for the entire population during a period from the late 19th century up until the [[Nazi era]].

==Translation==
The term ''völkisch'' ({{IPA-de|ˈfœlkɪʃ|pron}}) derives from the German word ''[[Volk]]'' (cognate with the English "folk"), corresponding to "[[ethnic group]]" of a population and people, with connotations in German of "people-powered". According to the historian [[James Webb (historian)|James Webb]], the word also has "overtones of '[[nation]]', '[[Race (human classification)|race]]' and '[[tribe]]{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;James Webb. 1976. ''The Occult Establishment''. [[La Salle, Illinois]]: Open Court. {{ISBN|0-87548-434-4}}. pp. 276–277&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''völkisch'' has no direct English equivalent, but it could be rendered as "[[ethnonationalist]]ic", "racial-nationalistic" or "ethno-[[racialist]]".

The ''völkisch'' "movement" was not a unified movement but "a cauldron of beliefs, fears and hopes that found expression in various movements and were often articulated in an emotional tone", Petteri Pietikäinen observed in tracing ''völkisch'' influences on [[Carl Gustav Jung]].&lt;ref&gt;Petteri Pietikäinen, "The Volk and Its Unconscious: Jung, Hauer and the 'German Revolution{{'"}}. ''Journal of Contemporary History'' '''35'''.4 (October 2000: 523–539), p. 524&lt;/ref&gt; 
The ''völkisch'' movement was "arguably the largest group" in the [[conservative revolutionary movement]] in Germany.&lt;ref name=LH19&gt;Hans Jürgen Lutzhöft (1971) ''Der Nordische Gedanke in Deutschland 1920–1940'' (Stuttgart. Ernst Klett Verlag), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; However, like "conservative-revolutionary" or "[[Fascist (insult)|fascist]]", ''völkisch'' is a complex term (''"schillernder Begriff"'').&lt;ref name=LH19 /&gt; In a narrow definition it can be used to designate only groups that consider human beings essentially preformed by blood,&lt;ref name=LH19 /&gt; i.e. by inherited characteristics.

The defining idea, which the ''völkisch'' movement revolved around, was that of a ''[[Volkstum]]'' (literally "folkdom", with a meaning similar to a combination of the terms "folklore" and "ethnicity").  ''Volkstümlich'' would be "populist", or "popular", in this context.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

== Origins in the 19th century ==
The ''völkisch'' movement had its origins in [[Romantic nationalism]], as it was expressed by early Romantics such as [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] in his ''Addresses to the German Nation'' published during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], from 1808 onwards, especially the eighth address, “What is a ''Volk,'' in the higher sense of the term, and what is love of the fatherland?", where he answered his question of what could warrant the noble individual's striving "and his belief in the eternity and the immortality of his work", by replying that it could only be that "particular spiritual nature of the human environment out of which he himself, with all of his thought and action&amp;nbsp;... has arisen, namely the people from which he is descended and among which he has been formed and grown into that which he is".&lt;ref&gt; John Rosenthal (22 April 2005). "[http://trans-int.blogspot.com/2005/04/ummah-and-das-volk-on-islamist-and.html The Ummah and das Volk: On the Islamist and 'Völkisch' Ideologies ]". ''Transatlantic Intelligencer''. Accessed 7 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|reason=It's just a blog|date=June 2018}}

The movement combined sentimental patriotic interest in [[German folklore]], [[local history]] and a "back-to-the-land" anti-urban populism with many parallels in the writings of [[William Morris]]. "In part this ideology was a revolt against modernity", Nicholls remarked.&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Nicholls, reviewing George L. Mosse, ''The Crisis in German Ideology: Intellectual Origins of the Third Reich'' in ''[[The English Historical Review]]'' '''82''' No. 325  (October 1967), p 860. Mosse was characterised as "the foremost historian of ''völkisch'' ideology" by Petteri Pietikäinen 2000:524 note 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The dream was for a self-sufficient life lived with a mystical relation to the land;{{cn|date=April 2017}} it was a reaction to the cultural alienation of the [[Industrial revolution]] and the "progressive" liberalism of the later 19th century and its urbane materialist banality.{{cn|date=April 2017}}  Similar feelings were expressed in the US during the 1930s by the populist writers grouped as the [[Southern Agrarians]].{{cn|date=April 2017}} 

The ''völkisch'' movement, as it evolved, sometimes combined the arcane and [[esoteric]] aspects of folkloric [[occultism]] alongside "[[racism|racial adoration]]" and, in some circles, a type of [[anti-Semitism]] linked to exclusionary [[ethnic nationalism]]. Many ''völkisch'' movements included [[anti-communism|anti-communist]], anti-immigration, anti-capitalist and anti-Parliamentarian ideas.{{citation needed|reason=Many assertions with no explanation nor reference|date=December 2015}} Over time, ''völkisch'' ideas of "national community" (''[[Volksgemeinschaft]]'') came more and more to exclude [[Jews]].{{cn|date=April 2017}}

== Before and after World War I ==
A number of the ''völkisch''-populist movements that had evolved during the late 19th century in the [[German Empire]], under the impress of [[National Romanticism]], developed along propagandistic lines after the German defeat in [[World War I]], and the word "the people" (''Volk'') became increasingly politicized.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

The same word ''Volk'' was used as a flag for new forms of ethnic nationalism, as well as by international socialist parties as a synonym for the [[proletariat]] in the German lands.  From the left, elements of the folk-culture spread to the parties of the middle classes.&lt;ref&gt;George L. Mosse, ''The Crisis of German Ideology: Intellectual Origins of the Third Reich'' (London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson) 1966 sees this in the context of a broader revolt against modernity, contrasting healthy rural life with the debased materialism of city culture.&lt;/ref&gt; But whereas ''Volk'' could mean "proletariat" among the left, it meant more particularly "race" among the center and right.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

Although the primary interest of the [[Ariosophy|Germanic mystical movement]] was the revival of native pagan traditions and customs (often set in the context of a quasi-[[Theosophy (disambiguation)|theosophical]] esotericism), a marked preoccupation with purity of race came to motivate its more politically oriented offshoots, such as the ''[[Germanenorden]]'' (the Germanic or Teutonic Order), a secret society founded at Berlin in 1912 which required its candidates to prove that they had no "non-[[Aryan race|Aryan]]" bloodlines and required from each a promise to maintain purity of his stock in marriage. Local groups of the sect met to celebrate the [[summer solstice]], an important [[neopaganism|neopagan]] festivity in ''völkisch'' circles (and later in Nazi Germany), and more regularly to read the [[Edda]]s as well as some of the [[German mystic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.intelinet.org/swastika/swasti01.htm#anchor36373 |website=Intelinet.org |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423053400/http://www.intelinet.org/swastika/swasti01.htm |archive-date=23 April 2010 |title=The Swastika and the Nazis}}&lt;/ref&gt; This branch of the ''völkisch'' movement quickly developed a hyper-nationalist sentiment and allied itself with anti-semitism, then rising.  One of the most important ''völkisch'' organizations after World War 1 was the [[Deutschvölkischer Schutz- und Trutzbund]].

Another ''völkisch'' movement of the same time was the ''[[Tatkreis]]''.

George Mosse examined ''völkisch'' literature in 1966 and identified some of the more "respectable" and centrist channels through which these sensibilities flowed: school texts that transmitted a Romantic view of a "pure" Germanic past, the nature-oriented [[German Youth Movement]], and novels with an ideally ruthless ''völkisch'' hero, such as [[Hermann Löns]]' ''[[Der Wehrwolf]]'' (1910).{{cn|date=April 2017}}

Not all folkloric societies with connections to [[Romantic nationalism]] were located in Germany. The ''Völkisch'' movement was a force as well in Austria.&lt;ref&gt;Austrian manifestations were surveyed by Rudolf G. Ardelt, ''Zwischen Demoktratie und Faschismus: Deutschnationales Gedankengut in Österreich, 1919-1930'' (Vienna and Salzburg) 1972, not translated into English.&lt;/ref&gt; While the community of [[Monte Verità]] ('Mount Truth') which emerged in 1900 at [[Ascona]], Switzerland, is described by the Swiss art critic Harald Szeemann as "the southernmost outpost of a far-reaching Nordic lifestyle-reform, that is, alternative movement".&lt;ref&gt;Heidi Paris and Peter Gente (1982). ''Monte Verita: A Mountain for Minorities''. Translated by Hedwig Pachter, ''Semiotext, the German Issue'' '''IV'''(2):1.&lt;/ref&gt; It embraced a mix of [[anarchism]], [[libertarian communism]] and various forms of artistic [[bohemianism]] and neopaganism.

== Influence on Nazism ==
The ''völkisch'' ideologies were influential in the development of [[Nazism]]. Indeed, [[Joseph Goebbels]] publicly asserted in the 1927 [[Nuremberg rally]] that if the populist (''völkisch'') movement had understood power and how to bring thousands out in the streets, it would have gained political power on 9 November 1918 (the outbreak of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]-led [[German Revolution of 1918–1919]], end of the German monarchy).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calvin.edu/academic/cas/gpa/rpt27c1.htm Calvin.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adolf Hitler]] wrote in ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' (''My Struggle''): "the basic ideas of the National-Socialist movement are populist (''völkisch'') and the populist (''völkisch'') ideas are National-Socialist."{{cn|date=April 2017}} Nazi racial understanding was couched in ''völkisch'' terms, when [[Eugen Fischer]] delivered his inaugural address as Nazi rector, ''The Conception of the Völkisch state in the view of biology'' (29 July 1933).&lt;ref&gt;Franz Weidenreich in ''Science'' New Series, '''104'''No. 2704 (October 1946:399).&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Thule Society]] was founded on 17 August 1918 by [[Rudolf von Sebottendorff]] with the original name of ''Studiengruppe für Germanisches Altertum'' (Study Group for Germanic Antiquity), and disseminated anti-republican and [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]] propaganda.{{cn|date=April 2017}} Karl Harrer, the Thule member most directly involved in the creation of the DAP in 1919, was sidelined at the end of the year when Hitler drafted regulations against conspiratorial circles, and the Thule Society was dissolved a few years later.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 150, 221&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''völkisch'' circles handed down one significant legacy to the Nazis: In 1919, Thule member [[Friedrich Krohn]] designed the original version of the Nazi [[swastika]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mein Kampf|last=Hitler|first=Adolf|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company|year=1943|isbn=|location=|pages=496}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In January 1919, the Thule Society was instrumental in the foundation of the ''[[Deutsche Arbeiter-Partei]]'' (German Workers' Party, or DAP), which later became the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP), commonly called the [[Nazi Party]]. ''Thule'' members or visiting guests that would later join the Nazi Party included [[Rudolf Hess]], [[Alfred Rosenberg]], [[Hans Frank]], [[Gottfried Feder]], [[Dietrich Eckart]] and [[Karl Harrer]]. Notably Adolf Hitler never was a member of the ''Thule Society'' and [[Rudolf Hess]] and [[Alfred Rosenberg]] were only visiting guests of the Thule Society in the early years before they came to prominence in the Nazi movement.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 149, 201&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Münchener Beobachter'' (''Munich Observer''), owned by Sebottendorff, was the press organ of another small nationalist party and later became the ''[[Völkischer Beobachter]]'' (''People's Observer''). The Thule Society had no members from the top echelons of the party and Nazi officials were forbidden any involvement in secret societies so the connection of ''völkisch'' ideologies with the NSDAP can be overstated.{{cn|date=April 2017}} According to [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]], an imaginative mythology has grown up around the supposed influence of the ''Thule-Gesellschaft'' within the [[Nazi Party]].{{cn|date=April 2017}}

'''''World Cultures''''' is  an electronic [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] of [[cross-cultural studies]]. It was founded in 1985 by [[Douglas R. White]], [[editor in chief]] until 1990, followed by Greg Truex 1991, [[J. Patrick Gray]], [[Peter N. Peregrine]] (1992-2014). The current publisher is Greg Truex (2015-16). It is an [[eScholarship]] journal that publishes cross-cultural research articles and published computerized codebooks and datasets. These include the [[Standard Cross-Cultural Sample]], Western North American Indians, an Atlas of Archaeology, the Ethnographic Atlas (Murdock, 1967), and [[Lewis Binford]]'s Constructing Frames of Reference: An Analytical Method for Archaeological Theory Building Using Ethnographic and Environmental Data Sets (2001) and numerous other topics. Numerous software programs for cross-cultural analysis have also been published.

Part of the purpose of the journal is to provide codebooks and data that are in the public domain for scientific use, at minimal cost of distribution, both to support scientific work and instructional use. New as well as legacy issues of the journal are at the free on-line site of the [[California Digital Library]]. The largest of the databases supported by the journal to date are the contributed multiauthored coded data for the [[Standard Cross-Cultural Sample]], now numbering over 2,000 coded variables on 186 societies by over 90 different contributing authors.
