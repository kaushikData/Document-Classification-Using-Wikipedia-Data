The '''2013 FIBA Americas Championship for Men''', later known as the '''FIBA AmeriCup''', was the qualifying tournament for [[FIBA Americas]], for the [[2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup|2014 FIBA World Cup]], in [[Spain]]. This [[FIBA AmeriCup]] tournament was held in [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]], from August 30, to September 11, 2013. The top four teams qualified for the 2014 FIBA World Cup.

[[Mexico national basketball team|Mexico]] defeated [[Puerto Rico national basketball team|Puerto Rico]], in the final, to win their first AmeriCup title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://caracas2013.com/en/noticiasread4.asp?r=000739EDFBBD47D1B22AC7A4AD004F1E | title=VEN2013&amp;nbsp;– Mexico is Americas Champion | date=11 September 2013 | accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As hosts, Venezuela picked first the group that they played at, and their final opponent in the preliminary round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fibaamericas.com/en/noticiasread4.asp?r=233B91162E3B489EA704F724CEDFF5C6 |title=VEN2013&amp;nbsp;– The stage is set for the 2013 FIBA Americas Championship draw |work=[[FIBA Americas]] |date=2013-02-27 |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Included are the last published [[FIBA World Rankings]] prior to the draw.

==Format==
The ten teams were split into two groups. The best four teams of each group advanced to the second round, where the teams played against the four teams from the other group; each team carried over all points earned during the first round, except for those earned in the match against the team that was eliminated. The best four teams of this group advanced to the semifinals and were qualified for the [[2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup|2014 FIBA World Cup]]. The United States, which won the Olympic Gold Medal in 2012, automatically qualified for the 2014 FIBA Tournament and does not have to participate as a result. Originally, Panama were supposed to compete for the 2013 FIBA Americas Championship, but was replaced by Mexico after FIBA implemented a suspension on the Panamanian Basketball Federation. Mexico was chosen as the next highest placed finisher in Panama's subcategory (COCABA) at the 2012 Centrobasket tournament.

==Second round==
[[Puerto Rico national basketball team|Puerto Rico]] narrowly clinched their place for the [[2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup]] against surprising hosts [[Venezuela national basketball team|Venezuela]] in an 85–86 thriller of an overtime match. Meanwhile, upstart [[Mexico national basketball team|Mexico]] also clinched their position for the World Cup from their performance, while [[Dominican Republic national basketball team|Dominican Republic]] and [[Argentina national basketball team|Argentina]] also secured their place for the World Cup. Despite the efforts, the Canadian team were unable to put up a defensive and offensive play, thus eliminating the team for the second time since 2011. Newcomers Jamaica was also eliminated, despite winning against the Argentine team, whereas Uruguay were unable to make their debut for the Championship round, losing half of the matches throughout the Second Round.

'''Alligator wrestling''' is an attraction, that later evolved into a [[sport]], that began as a [[hunting]] expedition for [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]].&lt;ref name="GatorWrestlersEndangered"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gator Wrestlers Endangered|url=http://banderasnews.com/0705/to-gatorwrestlers.htm|publisher=2012 BanderasNews ® all rights reserved
|accessdate=June 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as "[[alligator]] capturing techniques".

==Native American historical origins==
Southeastern Native Americans hunted alligators as a food source for thousands of years. At the turn of the 20th century, showing off alligators as [[roadside attraction]]s helped Native Americans generate revenue. Long before the first Europeans explorers wandered into the [[Florida]] [[Everglades]], alligator wrestling existed. For tribes like the [[Seminole]] and [[Miccosukee]], learning how to "handle" the reptiles was part of their existence.

{{quote|We had to live off whatever Mother Nature provided us in the Everglades ... We'd eat the tail, the meaty part. Later on, when the alligator skin had a value, we would hunt and skin the gators and bring the skin to trading posts and trade for things we couldn't grow.|Max Osceola, a Seminole tribal councilman.&lt;ref name=GatorWrestlersEndangered /&gt;}}

==In Florida==

A common symbol of [[Florida]] in popular culture is the [[American alligator]] (Alligator mississippiensis). Alligators, also known colloquially as "gators," are part of Florida's popular culture ranging from tourist attractions and alligator wrestlers to postcards and team mascots such as that of the [[University of Florida]]. The St. Augustine Alligator Farm was one of Florida's earliest themed tourist attractions that opened for business in 1893. At the St. Augustine Alligator Farm and other tourist attractions such as Gatorland and the Silver Springs Nature Park, "taming" or hypnotizing alligators was a popular trick, along with other performances such as alligator wrestling.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.wdl.org/en/item/4035 African American Man Wrestling an Alligator at the St. Augustine Alligator Farm]." 17 October 2011. World Digital Library. Web 29 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Baynard Stadium''' is an athletic stadium located in [[Wilmington, Delaware]]. It opened on June 10, 1922 and was a gift of Samuel H. Baynard, president of the Board of Park Commissioners. In its original configuration the stadium contained two baseball fields and a running track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Complete Work On Baynard Stadium|work=The Morning News|date=June 12, 1922}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium, currently owned by the city of Wilmington, was last renovated in 1972.

The '''Bluegrass Miracle''' was a 74-yard game-winning [[touchdown]] pass by the No. 16 [[LSU Tigers football|LSU Tigers]] with no time left on the clock against the [[Kentucky Wildcats football|Kentucky Wildcats]] on November 9, 2002 at [[Commonwealth Stadium (Kentucky)|Commonwealth Stadium]] in [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. The ball was tipped by a Kentucky player before being caught at the 15-yard line by [[Devery Henderson]] of LSU, who ran it in for the score.

==Background==
[[University of Kentucky|Kentucky]], the home team, was the underdog to the defending [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] champion Tigers. LSU was ahead by as many as 14 points at one point and led 24–14 after a field goal with 13:58 left in the fourth quarter, but Kentucky came back with a 13–3 run to tie it at 27. However, a Kentucky player called the Wildcats' last timeout on first down from the LSU 11 with 15 seconds left on the clock, and rather than risking a turnover or a tackle within the field of play that would leave the clock running and the Wildcats unable to line up to spike the football, head coach [[Guy Morriss]] opted to send [[Placekicker|kicker]] Taylor Begley out to kick a 29-yard [[Field goal (football)|field goal]], giving the Wildcats a 30–27 lead with 11 seconds left on the clock. LSU got the ball back, but the ensuing kickoff pinned the team at its own 9-yard line. On the first play of the series, the Tigers quickly got the ball to their own 26-yard line on a pass from [[quarterback]] [[Marcus Randall]] to [[wide receiver]] [[Michael Clayton (American football)|Michael Clayton]]. An LSU timeout stopped the clock with 2 seconds left, and set up a desperation [[Hail Mary pass]]. The chances for success were considered slim because Randall's arm was not strong enough to reach the opponent's [[end zone]] from 70+ yards away. Kentucky players were so confident that they had won the game that they gave Morriss a [[Gatorade shower|Gatorade bath]] before the final play had taken place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Ten years later, Bluegrass Miracle recalled|publisher=theadvocate.com/|url=http://theadvocate.com/sports/lsu/4380648-123/ten-years-later-lsus-improbable|accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The play==
{{quote box|quote=Randall, as time expires, lets it fly...'''''OH, MY GOODNESS! TOUCHDOWN, LSU! They win the game!''''' They win the football game!|source=[[Dave Neal]]'s call of the play on [[Jefferson Pilot Sports]].|width=31%}}
On the final play of the game, LSU called the play "Dash Right 93 Berlin". Tigers quarterback Marcus Randall took the ball and threw it from his own 18 yard line as far as he could downfield.  Soon after Randall released the ball, triumphant Kentucky fans stormed the field around Randall. The pass was 25 yards short of the [[end zone]]. However, the ball was deflected off the hand of a Kentucky player between the Kentucky 30 and 25 yard lines and fell into the hands of LSU wide receiver [[Devery Henderson]] just short of the 15-yard line. Henderson broke an attempt at a shoestring tackle by the last Kentucky defender and ran into the end zone for the game-winning touchdown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Remembering LSU's Bluegrass Miracle on the 10th anniversary|publisher= The Times-Picayune|url=http://www.nola.com/lsu/index.ssf/2012/11/remembering_lsus_bluegrass_mir.html|accessdate=2012-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Confusion and aftermath==
While Henderson crossed the end zone, the [[Jefferson Pilot Sports]] television broadcast accidentally posted the graphic "Kentucky 30, LSU 27—FINAL." LSU had actually just won the game 33–30. After the touchdown, Jefferson Pilot Sports [[play-by-play]] announcer [[Dave Neal]] called the play, "The most shocking, improbable, unbelievable sequence of events." In his television interview right after the play, LSU head coach Nick Saban said, "I don't know what to say. I feel bad for Kentucky's players. But this is a big moment for us and I'm happy as heck for our team....Well, sometimes you gotta be a little lucky and I think that was our luck right there."  Kentucky fans who were already on the field could not believe what had happened. Fireworks spewed out of the Commonwealth Stadium suites to herald the apparent Kentucky win when the game clock read "0:00", even prior to the Hail Mary pass. After the play, Tom Leach, Kentucky's [[radio]] play-by-play announcer, said, "How much heartbreak. (Kentucky) fans are up on the [[goal post]]s. I don't know why." LSU's play-by-play announcer [[Jim Hawthorne (sportscaster)|Jim Hawthorne]], was equally shocked and was also at a loss for an explanation; he initially said that LSU [[defensive back]] [[Jack Hunt (American football)|Jack Hunt]] (who had converted from wide receiver in 2002), not Devery Henderson, scored the touchdown. Hunt's uniform number was 8; Henderson's was 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Best College Football Buzzer Beaters - Bluegrass Miracle|publisher=sports.yahoo.com/|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/ncaaf-dr-saturday/doc-five-best-college-football-buzzer-beaters-no-175030153--ncaaf.html|accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naming the play==
On the day after the game, [[Baton Rouge]]'s daily newspaper, ''[[The Advocate (Baton Rouge)|The Advocate]]'', ran the headline "HAIL TIGERS" on the sports page. The headline is a reference to the [[Hail Mary pass]] used to win the game. On back of the sports page, it also provided a shot-by-shot camera sequence of the play. The page also included a graphic outlining the sequence of events. They were accompanied by the headline "Dash Right 93 Berlin," which was the play run that won the game.

The play became permanently known as the "Bluegrass Miracle" after a poll of LSU fans was conducted on the LSU Sports website days later. Other website suggestions for the name included "The Bluegrass Bomb" and "Miracle on the Bluegrass." The website also received write-in votes for such names as "The Divine Deflection," "It Works Devery Time," and "The Lexington Longshot."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Over 10,000 vote to name legendary LSU play|publisher=espn.com|url=http://a.espncdn.com/ncf/news/2002/1114/1460861.html|accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and records==
The "Bluegrass Miracle" also won the 2003 [[Best Play ESPY Award]]. It beat out plays from [[Kobe Bryant]], [[LeBron James]], [[Michael Vick]] and [[Barry Bonds]]. [[Devery Henderson]] accepted the award on behalf of the LSU team. It was the second time an LSU miracle play won an [[ESPY]] award: [[Warren Morris]] had won the 1997 [[Showstopper of the Year ESPY Award]] for his two out, walk-off [[home run]] in the [[1996 College World Series]] championship game.

It also marked the second time in as many years that LSU foiled a Kentucky football [[comeback (sports)|comeback]] in the final moments of the game. In the 2001 game, also at Kentucky, the Tigers won 29–25, on a touchdown pass from [[Marcus Randall]] to [[Devery Henderson]] with 13 seconds left in the game. Earlier in the game, Kentucky had overcome a 12-point halftime deficit to take the lead in the 4th quarter.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5893">'''Bowman's Lodge''' is a house in [[Dartford]], [[Kent]] and the location of Bowmans, an area in the north west of [[Dartford Heath]]. 

The historian John Dunkin wrote&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The History and Antiquities of Dartford|last=Dunkin|first=John|publisher=J. &amp; W. Davis|year=1844|isbn=|location=|pages=358-361}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Bowman's Lodge was so named "from having been taken by the Royal Society of Kentish Bowmen...where their first meetings were held. At the formation eleven gentlemen only enrolled their names but in 1786 their numbers increased to 30 and in the following year when their meetings were removed to Dartford Heath and held every Saturday during the months of May, June, July and August they numbered 61 and when it was known to be patronized by [[George_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom|His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales]] the numbers increased to 123, among whom were some of the highest nobility. The Heath again became the favourite resort of youth and beauty, assembled to behold the splendid costume of the members, and witness their skill in archery". He continued: "The house is traditionally said to have been the scene of many midnight revels and orgies. The members previous to the breaking up of the society, fitted up an apartment, in which they frequently acted plays and other dramatic pieces, to which the inhabitants of the neighbourhood were invited by tickets".&lt;blockquote&gt;Here knights and damsels met in splendid show Hailed the bright goddess of the silver bow, And maids of Kent, expert in piercing hearts, Supplied the archers with their eyes for darts; From Love's artillery discharged their lances And vanquish [[Kent|Cantia]]'s heroes with their glances. — Ye Virgin Sisters of chaste [[Diana (mythology)|Dian]]'s train Have pity on the Archers ye have slain For oh, what armour can secure be found When arrows sharp as yours inflict the wound. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''A poem presented to E.M. Potts at Bowman's Lodge c. 1834; lines by Miss Talbot, published in "Moonshine", p.346'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GjpVnsa93CYC&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions|title=Moonshine [by E.M.

Bowman's Lodge was the venue for four [[cricket]] matches played between 1795 and 1809 which were given retrospective [[first-class cricket]] status. Two matches were held between [[All-England cricket teams|an England side]] and [[Hampshire county cricket teams|a Hampshire team]] in 1795. A [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent side]] played England in 1805 and the final top-class match at the ground came in 1809 between England and [[Surrey county cricket teams|a Surrey team]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/448_f.html First-Class Matches played on Bowman's Lodge], CricketArchive. Retrieved 2017-12-17.&lt;/ref&gt;  The exact location of the ground on the heath is unknown, though the land opposite the lodge is presently laid out with [[Association football|football]] pitches and is a possible site of the cricket matches.

For about 60 years, the lodge was home to William Cracroft Fooks QC (1812-99), [[Barrister at Law]], JP for the county of Kent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dartfordhistory.blogspot.co.uk/2017/05/william-cracroft-fooks-qc-1812-99.html|title=William Cracroft Fooks QC (1812-99), Barrister at Law|website=dartfordhistory.blogspot.co.uk|access-date=2017-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was instrumental in the rejection of a proposal to build a ship canal from the Thames to [[Dartford Creek]]. He also organised the formation of a volunteer rifle corps in the Dartford area to prepare for a possible invasion of Britain by [[Napoleon III]].

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries gravel was excavated in the area and numerous [[Palaeolithic]] [[stone tool|flint implements]] were discovered in Bowman's Lodge Pit, which was located between the house and Chastilian Road&lt;ref name="PALAEOLITHIC FLINT IMPLEMENTS FROM THE BOWMAN'S LODGE GRAVEL PIT, DARTFORD HEATH"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tester|first1=P.J.|title=Archaeologia Cantiana Vol. 63|date=1950|publisher=Kent Archaeological Society|pages=122|url=http://www.kentarchaeology.org.uk/Research/Pub/ArchCant/Vol.063%20-%201950/063-07.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In the 20th century the pit was [[Landfill|filled in]] and returned to [[Heath|heathland]].

The lodge is thought to have had connections with Lord Tredegar until well into the 1900s. It was torn down in about 1987 and replaced with two modern dwellings. Swan Lane, the road running past the property, remained a dirt track until the 1980s when it was upgraded and became part of the main signposted route to [[Crayford]] from the Dartford Heath junction of the [[A2 road (Great Britain)|A2]].

The '''"Curse of LaBonte"''' is quite possibly one of the most famous [[curse]]s in [[curling]] history. It was caused by an incident at the finals of the 1972 [[World Curling Championships|world men's curling championship]], the [[1972 Air Canada Silver Broom]] in [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]], [[Germany]].

==History==
The [[Canada|Canadian]] team, skipped by [[Orest Meleschuk]] was playing the [[United States|American]] team skipped by [[Robert LaBonte]] in the finals. Canada had been undefeated up until this point, but was down by two points in the last end. They needed two points to tie the game. Meleschuk had the "hammer", the final shot of the end. When it was time for him to shoot, the Americans had shot rock on the button while Canada was sitting second shot right next to it. The U.S. was sitting third rock with a rock biting the 8-foot. To tie the game, Meleschuk had to hit the American rock and not roll further than this third rock.

Meleschuk's rock made the hit, and it proceeded to roll into the 8-foot. When it stopped, it was close to being second, but the Americans thought otherwise, and U.S. third [[Frank Aasand]] jumped in the air to celebrate. In the meantime, Canada's third [[Dave Romano]] was still investigating which rock was second rock, and thus whether or not Canada had scored two to tie, or just one for the loss. While Romano was looking, LaBonte jumped in the air to celebrate as well, but slipped and accidentally kicked the Canadian stone. Romano had still not agreed on who was shot, and since LaBonte had kicked the rock closer than the American rock, Canada was awarded two points in the end. Canada then stole another point in the extra end to win the championship after LaBonte was heavy with a draw for the win.

It was later said that LaBonte put a "curse" on Canada, because Canada did not win another World Championship until [[1980 Air Canada Silver Broom|1980]]. Canadian journalist [[Larry Tucker (journalist)|Larry Tucker]] is generally considered to have been given credit for inventing the hex in 1980 to describe Canada's victory that year.

A secondary "curse", if interpreted in this way, is that a North Dakotan rink did not represent the United States again in the World Curling Championships until [[1997 Ford World Men's Curling Championship|1997]], when [[Craig Disher]] of [[Langdon, North Dakota|Langdon]] represented the United States.

==Scoreboard==
This is the final score of the final of the [[1972 Air Canada Silver Broom]].

'''Dudley Road''' was a [[association football|football]] ground in [[Wolverhampton]] in [[England]]. It was the home ground of [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] between 1881 and 1889, and was used during the [[1888–89 Football League|first season]] of [[the Football League]].&lt;ref name=UD/&gt;

==History==
The ground began to be used in 1881, but had sparse facilities consisting of only a lean-to shelter on the southern touchline and a small standing area with [[duckboards]].&lt;ref name=UD&gt;Paul Smith &amp; Shirley Smith (2005) ''The Ultimate Directory of English &amp; Scottish Football League Grounds Second Edition 1888–2005'', Yore Publications, p47, {{ISBN|0954783042}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was located to the south of Wolverhampton town centre and to the east of Dudley Road.&lt;ref name=UD/&gt;

Wolves were founder members of the Football League in 1888, and the first League match played at Dudley Road on 8 September 1888 was a 1–1 draw with [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] watched by 2,500 spectators. The first League goal at the ground was an own goal by Villa's [[Gershom Cox]], and was thought for many years to have been the first-ever goal scored in the Football League, although modern research revealed it was actually scored at [[Pike's Lane]] by [[Kenny Davenport]] of [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fl125.co.uk/news/king-kenny-crowned-first-goalscorer King Kenny crowned first goalscorer] The Football League&lt;/ref&gt; The ground's record attendance of 10,000 was set on 2 March 1889 for an [[FA Cup]] match against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|The Wednesday]]. This was also the last match played at Dudley Road, as Wolves moved to [[Molineux Stadium]] for the start of the [[1889–90 Football League|1889–90 season]].&lt;ref name=UD/&gt;

The site was later used for housing, with the main road through the estate named "Wanderers Avenue".&lt;ref name=UD/&gt;

'''Flexible Flyer''' is a toy and recreational equipment brand, best known for the sled of the same name, a steerable wooden [[sled]] with steel runners.

== Operation ==

Flexible Fliers are flexible both in design and usage. Riders may sit upright on the sled or lie on their stomachs, allowing the possibility to descend a snowy slope feet-first or head-first.  To steer the sled, riders may either push on the wooden cross piece with their hands or feet, or pull on the rope attached to the wooden cross-piece.  Shifting the cross-piece one way or the other causes the flexible rails to bend, turning the sled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/TODAY-IN-PHILADELPHIA-HISTORY/Samuel-Leeds-Allen-patents-the-Flexible-Flyer.html Samuel Leeds Allen patents the Flexible Flyer - Today in Philadelphia History]&lt;/ref&gt;

Flexible Flyers work best on hard packed or icy snow.  If the snow is soft and deep, the sled's runners are likely to sink in and prevent the sled from moving.

== History ==

[[File:Flexible Flyer Ad.jpg|thumb|left|Flexible Flyer ad from the early 1900s]]

[[Samuel Leeds Allen]] [[patented]] the Flexible Flyer in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.westtown.edu/about-westtown/history/more-history/sledding-at-westtown/index.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Cinnaminson, New Jersey]] using local children and adults to test prototypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last = Hatala   | first = Greg   | title = Made in Jersey: Flexible Flyer - The sled from south Jersey   | publisher = The Star-Ledger   | date = January 7, 2014   | url = http://www.nj.com/business/index.ssf/2014/01/made_in_jersey_flexible_flyer_-_the_sled_from_south_jersey.html#incart_river#incart_hbx#incart_best-of   | accessdate = 2013-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Allen's company flourished by selling these speedy and yet controllable sleds at a time when others were still producing [[toboggans]] and "gooseneck" sleds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Pellegrini|editor-first=Anthony D.|title=The future of play theory: a multidisciplinary inquiry into the contributions of Brian Sutton-Smith|year=1995|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-2641-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8_NBW3q__PgC&amp;dq=flexible+flyer+history&amp;lr=&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|author=Bernard Mergen|chapter=Past play: relics, memory, and history|page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allen began producing sleds in his [[farm equipment]] factory to keep his workers busy even when it was not the farm season.  He developed many prototypes before he created the Flexible Flyer.  The sleds did not sell well until he began marketing them to the toy departments of [[department stores]].  In 1915, around 120,000 Flexible Fliers were sold, and almost 2,000 Flexible Flyers were sold in one day. 

In 1968, Leisure Group of Los Angeles, California bought the S. L. Allen Company.  Leisure Group continued to produce Flexible Flyers in [[Medina, Ohio]].  In 1973, a group of [[private investors]] bought Leisure Group's toy division and started manufacturing the sleds under the name "Blazon Flexible Flyer" in [[West Point, Mississippi]].  In 1993, Roadmaster purchased the rights to production and moved production to [[Olney, Illinois]], and in 1998, production was moved to China.  {{As of|2012}}, Flexible Flyers are mostly made in China and some are made in [[South Paris, Maine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/sports/outdoors/articles/2011/12/25/flexible_flyer_king_of_sleds_slides_on/ | work=The Boston Globe | title=Flexible Flyer, king of sleds, slides on | date=25 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Paricon, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;http://pariconsleds.com/index.php/classic-sleds.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth of Rugby League==
{{See|History of rugby league}}

It was in the George Hotel, Huddersfield on 29 August 1895 that 21 Lancashire and Yorkshire clubs held a meeting and by a majority of 20 to 1 voted to [[History of rugby league|secede]] from the [[Rugby Football Union]] to set up their own [[Rugby Football League|Northern Rugby Football Union]]. In 1922 this became the [[Rugby Football League]].

Stockport was also accepted into the league via telephone to the hotel.&lt;ref name="BBCb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bradford/content/panoramas/new_founders_room_1_360.shtml |title=Rugby League Founders' Room |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=7 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Memorabilia recalling the meeting can be found throughout the hotel as well as in the Heritage Centre.&lt;ref name="Expedia"/&gt;

==British Amateur Rugby League Association== 

The [[British Amateur Rugby League Association]] (BARLA) was also founded at the George Hotel in 1973.

==Rugby League Heritage Centre==
{{Main|Rugby League Heritage Centre}}

The Rugby League Heritage Centre was located in the basement of the George. It was the UK’s only rugby league heritage museum. It was the brainchild of sports presenter [[Mike Stephenson]]. 

The Rugby League Heritage centre was opened on 30 August 2005 by former players [[Billy Boston]], [[Neil Fox (rugby league)|Neil Fox]] and [[Mick Sullivan]].&lt;ref name="rlheritage"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rlheritage.co.uk/ |title=Gillette Rugby League Heritage Centre |publisher=Rugby League Heritage Centre |accessdate=7 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Within the centre were displays of memorabilia, including rare jerseys, medals, caps, programmes and photographs. There was also footage played on several plasma screens. The [[British Rugby League Hall of Fame]] is now located in the Heritage Centre.

'''Huey P. Long Field House''', on the campus of [[Louisiana State University]] in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]], was constructed in 1932. It was named for notable [[U.S. Senator]] and [[Governor (United States)|state governor]] [[Huey Long]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lsu.edu/campus/locations/LFLD.html&lt;/ref&gt; The field house is considered the original [[Student activity center|student union]] and included a [[post office]], [[ballroom]], [[gym]]nasium and also featured the largest [[swimming pool]] in the [[United States of America|United States]] at the time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lsusports.net/src/data/lsu/assets/docs/fb/pdf/03fb347-364.pdf?DB_OEM_ID=5200&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.savehpl.org/info.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.preservationnation.org/magazine/2009/july-august/faded-relic-reporter.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The field house was home to the [[LSU Tigers swimming and diving|LSU Tigers]] and [[LSU Lady Tigers swimming and diving|LSU Lady Tigers]] swimming and diving teams until the [[LSU Natatorium]] was built in 1985. The former LSU [[Varsity team|varsity]] [[hockey]] team used the field house as their home venue and the former [[LSU Tigers boxing]] team also held matches at the field house in addition to [[John M. Parker Agricultural Coliseum|Parker Coliseum]].

The building is currently the home of LSU's Department of Kinesiology and School of Social Work.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.savehpl.org/contexture.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jack Manski Oval''' is a sporting venue situated in the suburb of [[Kirwan, Queensland|Kirwan]] in [[Townsville]], [[Queensland]], [[Australia]]. Predominantly used as a [[rugby league]] ground, it is the home ground of the [[Townsville Blackhawks]], who play in the [[Queensland Cup]]. The ground is also used by the Townsville Brothers junior and senior rugby league teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blackhawkstsv.com.au/game-day/about-jack-manski-oval/|title=About Jack Manski Oval - Mendi Townsville &amp; Districts Blackhawks RFLC|publisher=|accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Originally based at Queens Park and, later, Gill Park, the Townsville Brothers rugby league club purchased 20 acres of land from Kern Brothers Earthmoving in the early 1980s in [[Kirwan, Queensland|Kirwan]] to develop a new clubhouse and playing fields in the suburb.

On 14 May 1983, the venue was officially named Jack Manski Oval, in honour of Jack Manski, a club official who worked for the club for over 40 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://websites.sportstg.com/club_info.cgi?c=0-2240-23759-0-0&amp;sID=390060|title=History - Brothers Townsville Junior Rugby League Club - SportsTG|website=SportsTG|accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ground was officially opened on 13 August 1984, with Brothers playing University and winning in all four grades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brotherstsv.com.au/about-us/history|title=Originally formed as Brothers Rugby League Club Townsville in 1922 - History - Brothers Leagues Club - Townsville|website=www.brotherstsv.com.au|accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 September 2014, it was announced that the [[Townsville Blackhawks]] were admitted into the [[Queensland Cup]] for the 2015 seasons and would play their home games at the venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.qrl.com.au/news/2014/09/10/qrl-announces-townsvilles-entry/|title=QRL announces Townsville's entry|date=10 September 2014|publisher=|accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 February 2015, the Blackhawks played their first game at the venue, a 12–24 loss to the [[North Queensland Cowboys]] in a pre-season trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrl.com/news/2015/02/14/cowboys-post-blackhawks-win/|title=Cowboys post Blackhawks win|date=14 February 2015|publisher=|accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 7, they played their first [[Queensland Cup]] at the venue, defeating the [[Mackay Cutters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.qrl.com.au/news/2015/03/09/blackhawks-warm-up-with-win/|title=Blackhawks warm up with win|date=9 March 2015|publisher=|accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the venue was upgraded with new playing lights thanks to a state government grant. The new 227 [[lux]] lights allowed the venue to host night games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blackhawkstsv.com.au/2017/05/17/see-the-light-at-jack-manski-oval/|title=Switching to a New Light at Jack Manski Oval - Mendi Townsville &amp; Districts Blackhawks RFLC|date=17 May 2017|publisher=|accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''ParisLongchamp Racecourse''' ({{lang-fr|'''Hippodrome de Longchamp'''}}) is a 57 hectare [[horse-racing]] facility located on the Route des Tribunes in the [[Bois de Boulogne]] in Paris, France. It is used for [[flat racing]] and is noted for its variety of interlaced tracks and a famous hill that provides a real challenge to competing thoroughbreds. It has several racetracks varying from 1,000 to 4,000 metres in length with 46 different starting posts. The course is home to more than half of the [[conditions races|group one]] [[List of French flat horse races|races]] held in France, and has a capacity of 50,000. The highlight of the calendar is the [[Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe]]. Held on the first weekend in October, the prestigious event attracts the best horses from around the world.

[[Image:RacesatLongchampManet1867.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''Races at Longchamp'' - [[Édouard Manet]], 1867]] 

The first-ever race run at Longchamp was on Sunday, April 27, 1857 in front of a massive crowd. The Emperor [[Napoleon III]] and his wife [[Empress Eugenie|Eugénie]] were present, having sailed down the Seine River on their private yacht to watch the third race. Until 1930, many Parisians came to the track down the river on steamboats and various other vessels, the trip taking around an hour to the Pont de Suresnes. The royal couple joined Prince [[Jérôme Bonaparte]] and his son [[Napoléon Joseph Charles Paul Bonaparte|Prince Napoleon]] in the Royal Enclosure alongside the Prince of Nassau, Prince Murat and the Duke of Morny, an avid racegoer. Non-aristocratic members of the upper classes were not permitted into the Royal enclosure and had to be content with watching from their [[barouche]] carriages on the lawn.

A number of prominent artists have painted horse racing scenes at Longchamp including the one seen here by [[Édouard Manet]] in 1867 and another four years later by [[Edgar Degas]] titled ''Race Horses at Longchamp''.

Racing continued during the [[German occupation of France]] in [[World War II]], with many German officers in the stands.

'''The Marylebone Cricket Club Grounds''' (''MCC Grounds'' for short) is a [[Belize]]an football stadium, located on the Northside of [[Belize City]], Belize.

== Football ==
It has traditionally been the homefield of all Belize City clubs that participate in national and international competitions. It is currently being occupied by [[FC Belize]] of the [[Premier League of Belize]] (PLB).

It also plays host to primary school and high school football competitions.

== History ==
The Grounds opened in the 1950s on the site known as the Barracks and was named after an English cricket team (Belize was a British colony). The MCC has since played host to numerous matches between City teams and visitors in the [[Belize Premier Football League]], now the [[Premier League of Belize]], and competitions sponsored by [[UNCAF]] and [[CONCACAF]].

'''Mackay Stadium''' is an outdoor athletic [[stadium]] in [[Reno, Nevada]] on the campus of the [[University of Nevada, Reno]]. It is the university's venue for [[College football|football]] and [[College soccer|women's soccer]] for the [[Nevada Wolf Pack]] of the [[Mountain West Conference]]. It was named after the Mackay family, benefactors of the university by [[Clarence Mackay|Clarence]] and [[John William Mackay|John Mackay]].

==History==
Located on the northern portion of campus, at 17th Street &amp; East Stadium Way, the stadium opened {{Years or months ago|1966|10}} on October 1, [[1966 college football season|1966]] with a [[seating capacity]] of 7,500. It replaced the original Mackay Stadium, formerly located in the bowl containing Hilliard Plaza, the Mack Social Sciences building, and the Reynolds School of Journalism. Both stadiums were named for the Mackay family, who were university benefactors in the early years of the school. The stadium currently seats 27,000 and has played to crowds in excess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mackay Stadium: Around Campus|url=http://www.unr.edu/around-campus/facilities/mackay-stadium|publisher=University of Nevada, Reno|accessdate=October 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=macstad&gt;{{cite web |title=Facilities: Mackay Stadium|url=http://www.nevadawolfpack.com/facilities/mackay-stadium.html|publisher=University of Nevada, Reno Department of Athletics|accessdate=October 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=medguide14&gt;{{cite web |title=Nevada Football 2014 Media Guide|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/unv/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/2014-15/misc_non_event/2014FBMediaGuide.pdf|publisher=University of Nevada, Reno Department of Athletics|year=2014|accessdate=September 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field sits at an [[elevation]] of {{convert|4610|ft|m}} [[Metres above sea level|above sea level]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=USGS: Reno, NV, -119.81870, 39.54987|url=http://msrmaps.com/image.aspx?T=2&amp;S=11&amp;Z=11&amp;X=644&amp;Y=10953&amp;W=3&amp;qs=%7cReno%7cNV|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029201743/http://msrmaps.com/image.aspx?T=2&amp;S=11&amp;Z=11&amp;X=644&amp;Y=10953&amp;W=3&amp;qs=%7cReno%7cNV|dead-url=no|archive-date=October 29, 2013|date=July 1, 1982|work=[[United States Geological Survey]]|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=October 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and runs in a NW to SE configuration, with the [[press box]] on the southwest sideline. 

===Renovations===
Permanent lighting was installed in 2003 to allow the option of night games.&lt;ref name=macstad/&gt; Originally natural grass, synthetic infill [[FieldTurf]] was installed in 2000 and replaced in [[2010 Nevada Wolf Pack football team|2010]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Watch the Mackay Stadium FieldTurf Installation|url=http://www.nevadawolfpack.com/genrel/071210aaa.html|publisher=University of Nevada, Reno Department of Athletics|accessdate=July 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the playing surface at Mackay Stadium was named [[Chris Ault]] Field in honor of the former Wolf Pack head coach, College Football Hall of Famer, creator of the Pistol offense in 2005 and for his contributions to Wolf Pack football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='Chris Ault Field' unveiled on Saturday|url=http://www.unr.edu/nevada-today/news/2013/chris-ault-field-dedicated|publisher=University of Nevada, Reno|date=September 9, 2013|accessdate=November 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Chris Ault Deserves Warm Send-Off on Night Mackay Stadium's Field is Named After Him|first=Chris|last=Murray|url=http://blogs.rgj.com/chrismurray/2013/09/04/legend-chris-ault-deserves-warm-send-off-on-night-mackay-stadium-field-is-named-after-him/|newspaper=[[Reno Gazette-Journal]]|date=September 4, 2013|accessdate=November 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A proposal passed by the Nevada Board of Regents ([[Nevada System of Higher Education|NSHE]]) upgraded seating options to the stadium for the 2016 season. This renovation has improved the quality of the fans' experiences but decreased the overall stadium capacity to 26,000. Higher ticket fees in the upgraded sections will repay this $11.5 million bond by 2031.&lt;ref name=MackayRenov&gt;{{cite news |title=Regents Approve $11.5 Million Mackay Stadium Renovation|first=Chris|last=Murray|url=http://www.rgj.com/story/sports/college/nevada/2014/12/05/regents-approve-million-mackay-stadium-renovation/19965149/|newspaper=[[Reno Gazette-Journal]]|date=December 5, 2014|accessdate=December 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wolf Pack Proposes 'Game-Changing' $11.5 Million Renovation of Mackay Stadium|first=Chris|last=Murray|url=http://www.rgj.com/story/sports/college/nevada/2014/11/21/wolf-pack-proposes-game-changing-million-renovation-mackay-stadium/19341155/|newspaper=[[Reno Gazette-Journal]]|date=November 24, 2014|accessdate=November 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6609">In [[baseball statistics]], '''NERD''' (a wink towards the [[mnemonic]] "Narration, Exposition, Reflection, Description") is a quantitative measure of expected aesthetic value. NERD was originally created by [[Carson Cistulli]]&lt;ref name="introducing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/index.php/introducing-nerd/|title=Introducing NERD|accessdate=2010-11-30|publisher=Fangraphs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is part of his project of exploring the "art" of [[sabermetrics|sabermetric research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/index.php/the-long-hello-some-notes-on-luck/|title=The Long Hello: Some Notes on Luck|accessdate=2010-11-30|publisher=Fangraphs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original NERD formula only took into account the [[pitcher]]'s expected performance&lt;ref name="introducing" /&gt; while the current model factors in the entire team's performance.&lt;ref name="team"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/index.php/introducing-team-nerd/|title=Introducing Team NERD|accessdate=2010-11-30|publisher=Fangraphs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.thescore.com/djf/2012/08/17/alright-its-the-getting-blanked-podcast-episode-64/|title=Getting Blanked Podcast Episode 64|accessdate=2012-11-15|publisher=thescore.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The premise for NERD was developed in Cistulli's piece "Why We Watch" in which he establishes the five reasons that baseball continues to captivate the American imagination from game to game: "Pitching Matchups," "Statistically Notable (or Otherwise Compelling) Players," "Rookies (and Debuts)," "Seasonal Context," and "Quality of Broadcast".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/index.php/why-we-watch/|title=Why We Watch|accessdate=2010-11-30|publisher=Fangraphs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fellow sabermatrician [[Rob Neyer]], who had collaborated with Cistulli on this piece,&lt;ref name=throneberries&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/sweetspot/post/_/id/3751/thursday-throneberries-9|title=Thursday Throneberries|accessdate=2010-11-30|publisher=Espn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metsminorsreview.libsyn.com/mets-minors-review-volume-16|title=Mets Minors Review Episode 16|accessdate=2012-11-15|publisher=Mets Minors Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote "the only thing missing [...] is a points system that would let us put a number on each game"&lt;ref name=throneberries /&gt; and on June 2, 2010 Cistulli unveiled the NERD Pitching formula.&lt;ref name="introducing" /&gt;

==NERD pitching==
NERD pitching tries to determine which pitchers will be the most aesthetically appealing to watch for a baseball fan and is both a historical and a predictive statistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/index.php/one-night-only-now-with-more-nerd/|title=One Night Only Now with More NERD|accessdate=2010-11-30|publisher=Fangraphs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NERD pitching formula uses a player's standard deviations from the mean (a weighted z-score&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ussmariner.com/2010/06/23/a-post-in-five-parts/|title=A post in Five Parts|accessdate=2011-02-16|publisher=USS Mariner}}&lt;/ref&gt;) of the [[Defense independent pitching statistics|DIPS]] statistic xFIP (expected Fielding Independent Pitching), swinging strike percentage, overall strike percentage, and the differential between the pitcher's [[Earned run average|ERA]] and xFIP to determine a quantitative value for each pitcher.&lt;ref name="introducing" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/index.php/strasburg-breaks-nerd/|title=Strasburg Breaks NERD|accessdate=2010-11-30|publisher=Fangraphs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;p\text{NERD} = (x \text{FIP}z \times 2) + (\text{SwStrk}\%z/2) + (\text{Strike}\%z / 2) + \text{LUCK} + 4.69&lt;/math&gt;

The factor of 4.69 is added to make the number fit on a 0 to 10 scale.  While there has been some disagreement on the calculation of Cistulli's luck component,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/blog_article/why-you-cant-subtract-fip-from-era/|title=Why You Can't Subtract FIP from ERA|accessdate=2010-11-30|publisher=The Hardball Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; the general consensus among sports writers seems to be that a player with a below-average ERA and an above-average xFIP has been "unlucky".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghostrunneronfirst.com/2010/06/getting-nerdy-with-jays-starters.html|title=Getting nerdy|accessdate=2010-11-30|publisher=Ghost Runner on First}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itsaboutthemoney.net/archives/2010/09/12/joba-and-fip/|title=Joba and FIP|accessdate=2010-11-30|publisher=It's About the Money}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=
http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=simmons/100402|title=Finally on board the sabermetrics revolution|accessdate=2010-11-30|publisher=Espn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Team NERD==
Following the model of his Pitching NERD, Team NERD tries to give a quantitative value to the aesthetic value of each of the 30 baseball teams.  For factors it accounts for "Age," "Park-Adjusted weighted Runs Above Average (wRAA)," "Park-Adjusted Home Run per Fly Ball (HR/FB)," "Team Speed," "Bullpen Strength," "Team Defense," "Luck" (Base Runs – Actual Runs Scored), and "Payroll".&lt;ref name="team" /&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \text{AGE}z \times 2 + \text{BAT}z + \text{HR}/\text{FB}z + (\text{SBA}z + \text{SBR}z + \text{XBT}z)\times .33 + \text{BL}z + \text{UZR}z + \text{PAY}z + \text{LUCK}&lt;/math&gt;

In a recent interview Cistulli admitted that there is a disconnect between [[Tampa Bay Rays|The Rays]] high tNERD rating and low attendance saying that he is considered adding a "park-adjustment" to his formula which would reflect either the stadium itself or "attendance relative to the stadium's capacity"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=

'''New Valby Idrætspark'''&lt;ref&gt;No official name has been given.&lt;/ref&gt; is a proposed [[football (soccer)|football]] [[stadium]] to be built in [[Valby]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. If built, the stadium would replace [[Valby Idrætspark]], as the home ground for [[Boldklubben Frem]].

In [[2006 in football (soccer)|2006]] the [[Copenhagen Municipality]] predicted that the main stand of the current Valby Idrætspark would last another 5–10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The {{Nihongo|'''Nishi-Nippon Pirates'''|西日本パイレーツ|Nishi-Nippon Pairētsu}} were a [[Nippon Professional Baseball|Japanese]] baseball team and a founding member of the [[Central League]] in 1950. The team was owned by the ''[[Nishi-Nippon Shimbun]]'' and played their home games in [[Heiwadai Stadium]] in [[Fukuoka]].

The team existed for one season — they placed sixth in 1950, and the following season merged with the also [[Fukuoka]]-based [[Nishitetsu Clippers]] to form the [[Nishitetsu Lions]].

'''Otkritie Arena''' ({{lang-rus|"Открытие Арена"|p=ɐtˈkrɨtʲɪjə ɐˈrʲenə}}) is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in Moscow, Russia. The venue is used mostly for [[association football|football]] matches, hosting the home matches of [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]] and occasionally the [[Russia national football team|Russian national team]]. It is called '''Spartak Stadium''' during the [[2017 FIFA Confederations Cup]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/confederationscup/destination/cities/city=1559/index.html|title=FIFA Confederations Cup Russia 2017 - Moscow  - FIFA|last=FIFA.com|publisher=FIFA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[2018 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y=2015/m=10/news=stadium-names-for-the-2018-fifa-world-cup-russiatm-confirmed-2709881.html Stadium names for the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia™ confirmed]. [[FIFA]].&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium is designed with a capacity of 45,360 people.

"Otkritie Arena", named after the sponsor [[Otkritie Holding]], is the commercial name for the Spartak Stadium until 2019.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spartak.com/main/news/35863/ «СПАРТАК» И «ОТКРЫТИЕ» ЗАКЛЮЧИЛИ СПОНСОРСКОЕ СОГЛАШЕНИЕ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The groundbreaking ceremony was held on 2 July 2007, but construction was delayed multiple times for different reasons. Construction was scheduled to be completed between 2009 and 2010 but, as of 2009, the stadium was still in the design stage. In 2010, the stadium project underwent revision because it was rejected by an architectural council that found the project too ordinary. The current design was developed by [[AECOM]], in association with Sport Concepts, and façade designer, Dexter Moren Associates adjacent to a separate indoor arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aecom.com/What+We+Do/Building+Engineering/_carousel/Стадион+«Спартак»?languagehoice=ru_RU&amp;Go=Go&amp;localeHidden=ru_RU&amp;localeFlash=en_US |title=Article|website=''aecom.com''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main financing of the construction came from the club's owner [[Leonid Fedun]] through affiliated companies [[LUKoil]] company and IFD Kapital.

With the construction of the stadium in 2015, the [[Moscow Metro]] station [[Spartak (Moscow Metro)|Spartak]], which had been completed in 1975, opened for passenger traffic. On 19 February 2013 it was announced that the new stadium will be named "Otkrytiye Arena" for six years under the terms of the contract with [[Otkrytiye (bank)|Otkrytiye Bank]]. On 21 August 2014, a monument to the [[Starostin brothers]], the founders of [[FC Spartak Moscow]], opened near the north stands inside the stadium. A 24.5-meter sculpture of the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Gladiator]] [[Spartacus]], for whom the club is named, was unveiled in the square outside the stadium.

The stadium officially opened on 5 September 2014. Spartak played against [[Red Star Belgrade]] and drew 1–1, with [[Dmitri Kombarov]] scoring the first goal for Spartak at the new stadium after a free-kick.
The stadium was constructed on the site of the [[Tushino Airport]]. The new stadium was included in [[Russian 2018 FIFA World Cup bid|Russia's bid]] for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], hosting the opening game, with [[Luzhniki Stadium]] slated to host the final.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldinteriordesignnetwork.com/news/russias_vtb_arena_to_be_the_main_venue_for_2018_fifa_world_cup_101206/ «Russia’s VTB Arena to be the main venue for 2018 FIFA World Cup] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707133157/http://www.worldinteriordesignnetwork.com/news/russias_vtb_arena_to_be_the_main_venue_for_2018_fifa_world_cup_101206/ |date=7 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium was completed ahead of [[VTB Arena]], which originally was planned for the World Cup opener. It was also one of four stadiums used for the [[2017 FIFA Confederations Cup]]. Artists such as [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]], [[Triggerfinger]] ([[Park Live Festival|Park Live 2015]]) have all performed at the stadium.

Available at the stadium are navigation assistance from volunteers, storage rooms, registration of children, lost and found office. Two sectors with 50 seats each are available for people with disabilities. This part of the arena is furnished with ramps and elevators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tass.ru/sport/580006|title=На стадионе футбольного клуба "Спартак" для инвалидов будут выделены два сектора по 50 мест|work=ТАСС|access-date=14 June 2018|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sledging''' is a term used in [[cricket]] to describe the practice whereby some players seek to gain an advantage by [[insulting]] or verbally [[intimidating]] the opposing player. The purpose is to try to weaken the opponent's concentration, thereby causing them to make mistakes or underperform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/bitesize/articles/z683qp3 |title=The origins of cricket jargon |work=BBC Bitesize |accessdate=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be effective because the batsman stands within hearing range of the [[Bowler (cricket)|bowler]] and certain close [[fielding (cricket)|fielders]]; and ''vice versa''. The insults may be direct or feature in conversations among fielders designed to be overheard. The term has also been used in other sports, as when the tennis player [[Nick Kyrgios]] [[Nick Kyrgios#Controversies|insulted his opponent]], [[Stan Wawrinka]], by referring to a purported encounter between another player and the latter's girlfriend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ravi |last=Ubha |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/08/13/tennis/kyrgios-wawrinka-tennis-sledge-montreal/index.html |title=Nick Kyrgios said what?! Aussie slammed, then fined, for lewd sledge |publisher=CNN |date=13 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is debate in the cricketing world as to whether this constitutes poor [[sportsmanship]] or good-humoured banter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/7244667.stm BBC Sport: ''India board proposes sledging ban''. Retrieved on 2 November 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; Sledging is sometimes interpreted as [[abuse]], and it is acknowledged some comments aimed as sledges do sometimes cross the line into [[personal abuse]], however, this is not always the case. Sledging can sometimes be a humorous attempt at distraction. Former Australian [[Australian cricket captains|captain]] [[Steve Waugh]] referred to the practice as 'mental disintegration'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Steve|last=Waugh|url=https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/in-this-extract-from-his-new-book-steve-waugh-explains-his-strategy-of-mental-disintegration/news-story/b24993a76add04d7ee9050bfa8d1efc3|title=In this extract from his new book, Steve Waugh explains his strategy of mental disintegration|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|date=30 November 2013|accessdate=6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
[[File:Shane Warne 2011 cropped.jpg|thumb|'Sledging is an effective cricketing weapon' - Australian cricketer [[Shane Warne]], who revealed that he sledged to charge up himself.]]
Australian newspapers acknowledged "sledging" as a term in the mid-1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Our turn to be bounced!|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=J-BUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=R5IDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=sledging&amp;pg=3314%2C3201920|accessdate=10 February 2013|newspaper=The Age|date=17 January 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Reilly|first=Bill|title=Sportsmanship given a terrible hiding|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6Z9WAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=U-cDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=sledging&amp;pg=2751%2C4288214|accessdate=10 February 2013|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=16 February 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the relatively recent coining of the term, the practice is as old as cricket itself, with historical accounts of witty banter between players being quite common. [[W. G. Grace]] and his brother [[E. M. Grace|E. M.]] were noted throughout their careers for being "noisy and boisterous" on the field. W. G. admitted that they used to "chaff" (i.e., tease) opponents, and this is seen as part of the [[gamesmanship]] for which E. M. and W. G. were always controversial.&lt;ref name="Rae19"&gt;Rae, p.19.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Ian Chappell]], the use of "sledging" as a term originated at [[Adelaide Oval]] in either the 1963–1964 or 1964–1965 [[Sheffield Shield]] competition. Chappell claims that a cricketer who swore in the presence of a woman was said to have reacted to an incident "like a sledgehammer". As a result, the direction of insults or obscenities at opponents became known as "sledging".&lt;ref&gt;Graham Seal, ''The Lingo: Listening to Australian English'' (University of New South Wales Press, 1999, {{ISBN|0-86840-680-5}}): page 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[BBC]]’s [[Pat Murphy (sports journalist)|Pat Murphy]]: “My understanding is that it came from the mid-sixties and a guy called [[Grahame Corling]], who used to open the bowling for [[New South Wales cricket team|New South Wales]] and [[Australian cricket team|Australia]] … apparently the suggestion was that this guy's wife was [having an affair] with another team-mate, and when he came into bat [the fielding team] started singing [[When a Man Loves a Woman (Percy Sledge song)|When a Man Loves A Woman]], the old [[Percy Sledge]] number.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00lmytk/Yes_its_the_Ashes_11_07_2009 BBC Radio 5Live, ‘Yes it's the Ashes’, 11 July 2009]{{expired link|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:BEN STOKES (11704837023).jpg|thumb|'I don't have anger issues' - English cricketer [[Ben Stokes]] who has been involved in several confrontations with Australia.]]
The [[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1974-75|1974–75 Australians]] were labelled the ''Ugly Australians'' for their hard-nosed cricket, verbal abuse and hostile fast bowling. "Behind the batsmen, [[Rod Marsh]] and his captain [[Ian Chappell]] would vie with each other in profanity",&lt;ref&gt;p119, [[Bob Willis]] and Patrick Murphy, ''Starting With Grace, A Pictorial Celebration of Cricket 1864–1986'', Stanley Paul, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tom Graveney]] wrote "It was an open secret that [[Ian Chappell|he]] used to encourage his players to give a lot of verbal abuse to rival batsman when they were at the wicket in an attempt to break their concentration."&lt;ref&gt;pp116-117, [[Tom Graveney]] and Norman Miller, ''The Ten Greatest Test Teams'', Sidgewick and Jackson, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

West Indian batsman [[Viv Richards]] was notorious for punishing bowlers that dared to sledge him. So much so, that many opposing captains banned their players from the practice. However, in a county game against [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]], [[Greg Thomas]] attempted to sledge him after he had played and missed at several balls in a row. He informed Richards: "It's red, round and weighs about five ounces, in case you were wondering." Richards hammered the next delivery out of the cricket grounds and into the nearby river Taff. Turning to the bowler, he commented: "Greg, you know what it looks like, now go and find it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/funny_old_game/3068365.stm Lighter examples of sledging – BBC Sport]&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Views==

=== Australia ===
It has been pointed out that the Australian cricket team believes in playing in a more 'robust' fashion than others and that it upholds a 'sledging culture'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/sport/cricket/australias-sledging-culture-needs-to-be-addressed-20171209-h01quw.html|title=Australia's sledging culture needs to be addressed|last=Lane|first=Tim|date=2017-12-09|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian bowler [[Merv Hughes]] has claimed that he credits sledging for twenty-five percent of the wickets he has taken.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/article-63591/It-sledging-gone-far-McMillan-stormed-wielding-gun.html|title=It seemed my sledging had gone too far when McMillan stormed in wielding a gun|work=Mail Online|access-date=2018-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per Australian cricketer [[Mark Taylor (cricketer)|Mark Taylor]], Australian fans want to watch 'combative cricket'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/cricket/david-warner-sledging-pakistans-wasim-akram-englands-ian-bell-play-down-rohit-sharma-incident/news-story/652eeb5094d11da8816eaa6ad77e770e|title=David Warner sledging: Pakistan’s Wasim Akram, England’s Ian Bell play down Rohit Sharma incident|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian batsman [[Ricky Ponting]] has argued that sledging helps get players 'out of control' and 'out of their comfort zone'. Ponting has also said that it's 'not as bad' as the average person would think.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cricket.com.au/news/ricky-ponting-ashes-sledging-australia-england-adelaide-oval-second-test-james-anderson/2017-12-03|title=Ponting's insight into value of 'banter'|work=cricket.com.au|access-date=2018-06-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian spinner [[Shane Warne]] describes sledging as an 'effective cricketing weapon'.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; On [[Allan Border]]'s advice, Warne has also adopted sledging as a technique to 'switch on' for a contest.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Australian all-rounder [[Michael Clarke (cricketer)|Michael Clarke]] has said that he 'loved the aggressive approach'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/cricket/85995702/no-need-for-excessive-sledging--michael-clarke-and-brad-haddin|title=No need for excessive sledging - Michael Clarke and Brad Haddin|website=Stuff|language=en|access-date=2018-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to 'personal sledging' accusations against his team, Australian cricketer [[Steve Smith (cricketer)|Steve Smith]] has said, "Getting personal on the field is not on, that's crossing the line in my opinion."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cricket.com.au/news/steve-smith-personal-sledging-comments-australia-south-africa-first-test-warner-de-kock-du-plessis/2018-03-05|title=Smith, Proteas at odds over 'personal' sledging|work=cricket.com.au|access-date=2018-07-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, Australian opener [[Ed Cowan]] suggests that 'all sledging is personal' adding that Australian cricketers should be 'nowhere near the line'.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/inquirer/warner-outburst-shows-shifting-line-on-cricket-sledging/news-story/13bb0dd7ec565a7e861f0ab1f6670255|title=Aussies never ‘cross the line’|last=|first=|date=|website=www.theaustralian.com.au|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the controversial Test series during [[Australian cricket team in South Africa in 2017–18|Australia's Tour of South Africa in 2018]] commenced, Australian spinner [[Nathan Lyon]] commented on sledging: "We know where the line is. We headbutt it, but we don’t go over it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.news.com.au/sport/cricket/blurred-lines-where-exactly-does-the-line-lie-in-modern-cricket/news-story/8b1f340a24a1fe0bd6e1f8315b931008|title=Where’s the ‘line’ in dark art of sledging|work=NewsComAu|access-date=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[2018 Australian ball-tampering scandal]], voices calling for a reformation of Australia's 'cricket culture' have emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/cricket/103584100/sledging-has-a-place-in-cricket-says-new-australian-coach-justin-langer|title=Sledging has a place in cricket, says new Australian coach Justin Langer|website=Stuff|language=en|access-date=2018-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian Prime Minister [[Malcolm Turnbull|Malcom Turnbull]] called for an end to sledging following the scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenational.ae/sport/cricket/australia-pm-malcolm-turnbull-calls-for-end-to-sledging-in-cricket-after-ball-tampering-row-1.716431|title=Australia PM Malcolm Turnbull calls for end to sledging in cricket after ball tampering row|work=The National|access-date=2018-07-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the outrage over the scandal, former Australian cricketer [[Justin Langer]] said that cricket would be 'dull' without sledging. Australian batsman [[David Warner (cricketer)|David Warner]] who received a one-year ban following the controversial series, exclaimed: "I play with aggression on the field and I try not to cross that line".&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Former Australian cricketer and former coach of the Australian team [[Darren Lehmann]] has suggested that Australia is 'not as bad' as portrayed, adding that sledging was worse during his own times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dailytimes.com.pk/277218/australia-not-as-bad-as-portrayed-sledging-was-worse-during-my-time-lehmann/|title=Australia not as bad as portrayed, sledging was worse during my time: Lehmann - Daily Times|date=2018-08-03|work=Daily Times|access-date=2018-08-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bangladesh ===
Historically described as a 'timid' side, Bangladesh underwent a transformation as they grew in confidence following the [[2015 Cricket World Cup]], according to Bangladeshi cricketer [[Mashrafe Mortaza]]. Mortaza says that he encourages his players to 'look the opponent in the eye' while 'not overstepping a line'. He also insists that his side 'does not start a conversation' on the field. Bangladesh former cricketer and commentator [[Athar Ali Khan]] says that Bangladesh has moved out of a 'culture of backing off'.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== England ===

'''Tamara Natanovna Press'''{{#tag:ref|{{lang-ru|Тамара Натановна Пресс}}, {{lang-uk|Тамара Натанівна Пресс}}, ''Tamara Natanivna Press''|group=nb}} (born 10 May 1937) is a retired [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] athlete who dominated the shot put and discus throw in the early 1960s. She won three gold and one silver medals at the 1960 and 1964 Olympics and three European titles in 1958–1962. Between 1959 and 1965 she set 11 world records: five in the shot put and six in the discus. Domestically, she held 16 national titles, nine in the shot put (1958–66) and seven in the discus (1960–66).&lt;ref name=ol/&gt;

Her younger sister [[Irina Press]] was also a prominent track athlete, but mostly in the sprint events.&lt;ref name=sr/&gt;

==Career==
Press was born to Jewish parents in [[Kharkiv]], [[Soviet Union]]. Her father died fighting in World War II in 1942, while her mother took the daughters to [[Samarkand]], where they started training in athletics.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;&lt;ref name="yivoencyclopedia1"/&gt; In 1955 Press moved to Saint Petersburg to train under the renowned coach Viktor Alekseyev. Next year she was shortlisted for the Olympic team, but lost due to a strong domestic competition in the throwing events.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

==Retirement and gender rumors==
Both sisters were accused of being men or [[intersex]], and therefore sometimes  called the "Press Brothers".&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/080822.html "Switch hitter: If a man has a sex change can he compete in the Olympics as a woman?"] [[thestraightdope.com]]. 22 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://transgriot.blogspot.co.uk/2011/11/olympic-gender-drama-press-sisters.html Olympic Gender Drama-The Press Sisters]. TransGriot. 9 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; They retired in 1966, before [[Gender verification in sports|gender verification]] became mandatory on location. In retirement Press worked as an athletics coach and official in Moscow.&lt;ref name=sr/&gt; She also wrote several books on sport, social and economical subjects. In 1974 she defended a PhD in [[pedagogy]].&lt;ref name=ol/&gt; She was awarded the [[Order of Lenin]] (1960), [[Order of the Badge of Honour]] (1964) and [[Order of Friendship]] (1997).&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;&lt;ref name=bse/&gt;

The intended use is to put the Thighmaster between the [[knees]] and squeeze them together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.shape.com/fitness/gear/do-seen-tv-fitness-products-work |title=Suzanne Somers' Thigh Master - As Seen On TV Fitness Products: Do They Work? &amp;#124; Shape Magazine |publisher=Shape.com |date=2012-10-28 |accessdate=2018-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This exercises the [[hip adductors]]. The simple mechanism allows exercising any suitable [[muscle]] where a small angle can be created to press it, for example the [[biceps]] (elbow flexion) or the hamstrings (knee flexion).&lt;ref name="LAtimes"&gt;{{cite news|title= Working out old school: Is it time to pull out the ThighMaster?|publisher= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=2009-01-05|url= http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jan/05/health/he-retro5|accessdate=2010-12-21|first=Whitney|last=Friedlander}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with most fitness products marketed to homes, advertisements often emphasized that the Thighmaster could be used while doing something else. The [[infomercials]] featured people watching television and exercising with the Thighmaster at the same time. It was mainly advertised in the 1990s by the actress [[Suzanne Somers]].&lt;ref name="LAtimes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://jezebel.com/the-newest-thighmaster-vibrates-is-finally-useful-1699961029 |title=The Newest ThighMaster Vibrates, Is Finally Useful |publisher=Jezebel.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/17/suzanne-somers-thighmaster_n_7086648.html |title=Suzanne Somers Says Her Vibrating ThighMaster 'Makes Sex More Enjoyable' |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=2015-04-17 |accessdate=2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Thighmaster was marketed by [[Joshua Reynolds (inventor)|Joshua Reynolds]], who also made a great deal of money with his version of the [[Mood ring]]. Reynolds is an heir to the fortune of [[R.

'''Trips For Kids '''is a non-profit community service organization that provides beginning and intermediate-level mountain bike outings, environmental education, bicycle mechanics training and earn-a-bike programs for youth in the United States and Canada, especially those most in need.  Legally based in Marin County, California, over 200,000 children have been served by 75 Trips for Kids chapters in the United States and Canada as of December 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tripsforkids.org&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==History==
Trips for Kids was founded in Marin County, California in 1988 by Marilyn Price, a social activist, environmentalist and Mountain Bike Hall of Fame inductee.  Price used the mountain bike to teach at-risk, underserved youth lessons in personal responsibility, achievement and environmental awareness through the development of practical skills. Price formed the nonprofit Trips for Kids-Marin, the organization's flagship program, and began national outreach in the mid-1990's to inspire new chapters. Independent chapters began to form throughout the United States, Canada, Israel and briefly in Sierra Leone, growing to 75 chapters as of August 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tripsforkids.org/our-programs/ http://www.tripsforkids.org/national/findachapter.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs and Chapters==
In addition to the Discovery Trail Rides Program, Trips for Kids chapters may also run Adventure Ride Clubs, Earn-a-Bike Workshops, Mobile Bike Clinics, camps and other programs. Five chapters also operate Recyclery community bike thrift shops.

==National Umbrella Organization==

On August 1, 2017, a new 501c3 national umbrella organization was established to provide support for Trips for Kids chapters, build new chapters, improve program quality and promote the organization.
