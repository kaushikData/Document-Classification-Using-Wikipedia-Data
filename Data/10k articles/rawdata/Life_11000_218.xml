The '''2011 Crosstown Shootout brawl''', nicknamed '''The Crosstown Punch-Out''', was a [[bench-clearing brawl]] that took place at the end of the 2011 edition of the [[Crosstown Shootout]] [[college basketball]] game between the [[University of Cincinnati]] [[Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball|Bearcats]] and the [[Xavier University]] [[Xavier Musketeers men's basketball|Musketeers]].  The game took place on December 10, 2011 at Xavier's home arena, the [[Cintas Center]] in [[Norwood, Ohio|Norwood]].

==Background==
The Crosstown Shootout has always been one of the more intense rivalries in college basketball, all the more so because Xavier and UC are only two miles ({{convert|2|mi|disp=output only}}) apart. There has always been a fair amount of [[trash talk]] between the two schools, and the 2011 game was no different. On December 8, UC guard [[Sean Kilpatrick]] told Andy Furman of [[WCVX|WQRT]] that Xavier's All-American guard [[Tu Holloway]] probably wouldn't start for the Bearcats "with the players that we have now."&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Shannon. [http://cincinnati.com/blogs/xavier/2011/12/08/kilpatrick-holloway-wouldnt-start-at-uc Kilpatrick: Holloway wouldn't start at UC]. [[Cincinnati Enquirer]], 2011-12-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

The series had developed a history of bad blood in the years leading up to the 2011 Crosstown Shootout.&lt;br&gt;
In '''2008''', a total of ''six'' technicals were called in a 76-66 XU win.  XU's Derrick Brown was ejected, and two freshman post players were involved in an altercation that included a heavy dose of foreshadowing: XU's [[Kenny Frease]] head-butted UC's [[Yancy Gates]] (both players received technicals).  The altercation between Frease and Gates in 2008 set the tone for bad blood between the two, and may have motivated Gates to seek revenge in 2011.&lt;br&gt;
In '''2009''', multiple verbal exchanges resulting in UC clearing their bench as well as technicals called on XU's [[Jordan Crawford]] and UC's Rashad Bishop in XU's double overtime win.&lt;br&gt;
In '''2010''', Xavier's Tu Holloway received a technical foul for throwing an elbow late in UC's 66-46 win.&lt;br&gt;

==The brawl==
The game was close at first, with eight ties and six lead changes in the first half. Xavier led 34-25 at halftime.&lt;ref name=Enquirergamestory&gt;Russell, Shannon. [http://news.cincinnati.com/article/20111210/SPT0102/312100035 Brouhaha mars Xavier's 76-53 win against UC at Cintas Center]. [[Cincinnati Enquirer]], 2011-12-11.&lt;/ref&gt; The first sign of trouble occurred in the closing seconds of the first half, when Bearcat backup [[Octavius Ellis]] began exchanging some words with Xavier player [[Mark Lyons]] from the bench. Ellis jumped up from the bench to confront Lyons, and the two players had to be separated. Before the start of the second half, according to Xavier coach [[Chris Mack (basketball)|Chris Mack]], both teams were warned that any further incident would result in [[technical foul]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Zac. [http://www.foxsportsohio.com/12/10/11/Xavier-UC-rivalry-hits-rock-bottom/landing.html?blockID=623940&amp;feedID=3725 Xavier-UC rivalry hits rock bottom]. [[Fox Sports Ohio]], 2011-12-11.&lt;/ref&gt; The Musketeers started the second half on a 9-2 run and were never seriously threatened afterward.&lt;ref name=APESPN&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=313442752 Bench-clearing melee halts end of Xavier's rout of Cincinnati]. [[Associated Press]] via [[ESPN]], 2011-12-10.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ultimately, the Musketeers outscored the Bearcats 42-28 in the second half.&lt;ref name=Enquirergamestory/&gt;

With 18.6 seconds remaining, [[Tu Holloway]] scored a layup to give the Musketeers the 76-53 lead. As Holloway walked to the other end of the court, he began shouting at the Bearcat bench, bringing UC's Ge'Lawn Guyn over to confront him, leading to an argument between both men. As Guyn reached for Holloway's throat, Xavier's [[Dezmine Wells]] intervened by pushing Guyn to the ground,&lt;ref name=APESPN/&gt; causing UC's [[Yancy Gates]] to throw the ball at Holloway's head, and both benches to empty. In the ensuing fight, Gates punched Xavier's Kenny Frease in the face, opening up a large cut under Frease's left eye and knocking him to the ground. As Frease tried to crawl away from the crowd, UC's Cheikh Mbodj stomped on the back of his head. Ellis threw a punch at Lyons, causing him and Wells to throw several back, before coaches got in between them. This brought Gates over, who began shouting and throwing more punches at a Xavier backup, until Xavier assistant [[Aaron Williams (basketball)|Aaron Williams]] and Lyons calmed him down.&lt;ref name=Highlights&gt;[http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=7339298 ESPN highlights of game]&lt;/ref&gt; Referees Michael Roberts, Jeff Anderson, and Tony Crisp ended the game with 9.4 seconds remaining, giving Xavier the 76-53 win. UC's Gates and Mbodj, and Xavier's Wells were retroactively ejected from the game for fighting. Under NCAA rules, they were suspended for their next game, a sanction that cannot be appealed.

Immediately following the incident, both sides were escorted to the tunnels at either end of the court so that they would enter their respective locker rooms. However, due to the chaos of the brawl, both teams entered through the tunnels opposite from where they were supposed to go. This would have resulted in another confrontation in the hallways beneath the Cintas Center stands as both teams would have had to cross each other in the narrow hallway leading to their locker rooms. To avoid this, the Xavier team was corralled into the south tunnel leading out of the main arena. Once the UC players were off the court and had filed through the north tunnel to their locker room, the Xavier players were brought back out and began celebrating with the remaining fans and students still in the stands. This however resulted in an incident between the Xavier players and the Cincinnati fans who began yelling obscenities at one another. Security again had to get involved to keep the two groups away from each other.

==Aftermath==
UC coach [[Mick Cronin (basketball)|Mick Cronin]], angry at how his players behaved, ordered them to take off their jerseys in the locker room, and in some cases physically took them off. In his postgame comments, a visibly angry Cronin said that he told his players not to put them on again "until they have a full understanding of where they go to school and what the university stands for and how lucky they are to even be there, let alone have a scholarship." He also hinted that several players could face suspensions, and possibly dismissal from the team, saying that he was going to review the tape with school president [[Gregory H. Williams]] and athletic director Whit Babcock "and decide who's going to be on my team going forward." He also appeared to blame the referees for not taking control of the situation sooner (threats of technicals after the first-half incident notwithstanding), saying that Musketeer players were yelling at his bench for the whole game and even cursing at his coaches. Cronin said he tried to call a time out before the brawl broke out so the players could go to their respective benches, but couldn't get the officials' attention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gobearcats.com/allaccess/?media=273285 Mick Cronin postgame comments]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the postgame interview, Holloway claimed the Bearcats had "disrespected" his teammates in the run-up to the game. He also said, "We went out there and zipped them up at the end of the game." He also added that he and his teammates considered themselves "gangsters, not thugs, but tough guys on the court." Lyons added, "If somebody puts their hand in your face or tries to do something to you, where we're from you're gonna do something back."&lt;ref name=Highlights/&gt;

Later that night, Cronin spoke with [[ESPN]]'s [[Andy Katz]] and reiterated that there would be additional suspensions coming. "Nobody is going to walk on our side," he said. He also said this was the most embarrassing moment of his coaching career. Mack was somewhat more restrained in his remarks, saying he wasn't "in a position to be a decision maker," but that his players needed to learn "how to handle themselves and not let that happen again." 
Earlier, Mack had tweeted, "If my players say they've been taught to be tough their whole life, they mean ON THE FLOOR. Nothing else is condoned."&lt;ref name=ESPN&gt;[[Andy Katz|Katz, Andy]]. [http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/7339184/cincinnati-bearcats-coach-embarrassed-brawl-xavier-musketeers Penalties pending after Cincinnati brawl]. [[ESPN]], 2011-12-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both schools' presidents issued statements condemning the brawl. UC's Williams strongly supported Cronin's postgame remarks, saying that the brawl was "not what we expect of representatives of the University of Cincinnati" and that school officials would "act swiftly and firmly" to ensure it never happened again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gobearcats.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/121011aaa.html Statement on brawl from UC president Gregory Williams]&lt;/ref&gt; Xavier's [[Michael J. Graham]] called the brawl "unsportsmanlike" and apologized to Xavier's fans and "the entire Cincinnati community."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goxavier.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/121011aaa.html Statement from Xavier president Michael J. Graham]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Big East Conference (1979–2013)|Big East Conference]] and [[Atlantic 10 Conference]], the home conferences for UC and Xavier respectively at the time, also condemned the brawl and promised to hand down additional suspensions if they felt the schools haven't acted harshly enough.&lt;ref name=ESPN/&gt;

On December 11, both schools announced suspensions for the players involved. UC suspended Gates, Mbodj and Ellis for six games each, and Guyn for one game. Cronin said that the four players would still have to earn their way back onto the team even after they serve out their suspensions.  At the very least, Cronin said, they would have to sincerely apologize on camera and complete several other unspecified tasks. Xavier suspended Wells and Landen Amos for four games, Lyons for two and Holloway for one.  Xavier athletic director Mike Bobinski also apologized for Holloway and Lyons' postgame remarks. Mack said that Holloway was suspended specifically for his postgame comments, and admitted that neither he nor Lyons should have been before the media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/7341744/cincinnati-bearcats-suspend-four-players-brawl-xavier-musketeers Cincinnati, Xavier reveal suspensions]. [[ESPN]], 2011-12-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 11, Mack, Holloway, Lyons and Xavier Athletic Director Mike Bobinski all apologized for what occurred.  Mike Bobinski said, "It was an embarrassment. It was a disappointment at every level. We take full responsibility for the role that we played in those events and are resolved to whatever is necessary to see to it that it never happens again."&lt;ref name="cincinnati.com"&gt;[http://cincinnati.com/blogs/xavier/2011/12/11/bobinski-mack-holloway-apologize/]&lt;/ref&gt; Tu Holloway also apologized for post game comments saying, "Myself, I used the wrong choice of words. I represent Xavier University, my family and myself and I really apologize for what took place."&lt;ref name="cincinnati.com"/&gt;

On December 12, an emotional Gates apologized for his actions, saying they were "not what my family is about."  Guyn, Ellis and Mbodj also apologized.&lt;ref&gt;Koch, Bill. [http://cincinnati.com/blogs/uc/2011/12/12/tearful-yancy-gates-uc-apologize-for-role-in-xaiver-game Tearful Yancy Gates, UC apologize for role in Xavier game]. [[Cincinnati Enquirer]], 2011-12-12.&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, [[Hamilton County, Ohio]] prosecutor [[Joe Deters]] said he was considering filing criminal charges related to the brawl.  Under Ohio law, Deters' office would handle the case if the charges rose to the level of felonies; Cincinnati city solicitor John Curp would prosecute if they are only misdemeanors. There is no known instance of criminal charges being filed as a result of a brawl at an NCAA game.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, Kimball.[http://news.cincinnati.com/article/20111212/SPT0101/312120055 Prosecutors explore possible criminal charges for UC, Xavier]. [[Cincinnati Enquirer]], 2011-12-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, Deters announced he would not file charges. He also indicated that Gates and Frease had "reached out to each other privately", and that Frease was satisfied with a personal apology from Gates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/7352151/no-charges-cincinnati-bearcats-xavier-musketeers-brawl-prosecutor-says |title=Prosecutor: No charges in brawl |author=Associated Press |work=ESPN.com |date=December 14, 2011 |accessdate=December 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On that same day XU athletic Director Mike Bobinski used head coach Chris Mack's radio show to again apologize and take questions from fans concerning the incident.

On December 18, prior to Xavier's game against Oral Roberts, Mack took the floor again to apologize for the incident that had occurred in the previous game. Mack said, "We were all embarrassed by our behavior last weekend," and added, "It's extremely disappointing and in no way was a representation of what our university and our basketball program is all about."&lt;ref&gt;[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/college/mensbasketball/story/2011-12-18/xavier-oral-roberts-holloway-lyons/52049068/1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Partly due to the incident, Xavier and UC officials decided to move the game to [[U.S. Bank Arena]] for at least the next two seasons and rename it the Crosstown Classic. Player and fan behavior was extensively reevaluated after the 2013 game, and was said to be a major factor in the decision to continue the series beyond the 2013–14 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cincinnati.com/article/20120521/SPT01/305210101/Exclusive-Crosstown-Shootout-set-U-S-Bank-Arena  |title=Exclusive: Crosstown Shootout set for U.S. Bank Arena |first=Bill |last=Koch |newspaper=The Cincinnati Enquirer |date=May 22, 2012 |accessdate=May 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crosstown Shootout Gets New Name, Venue|url=http://www.wlwt.com/news/sports/Crosstown-Shootout-to-get-new-name-venue/-/9837968/14860932/-/oofsoq/-/index.html|publisher=[[WLWT]]|date=14 June 2012|access-date=2012-12-14|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130209090751/http://www.wlwt.com/news/sports/Crosstown-Shootout-to-get-new-name-venue/-/9837968/14860932/-/oofsoq/-/index.html|archive-date=2013-02-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 12, 2014, the two schools announced a 10-year agreement to continue the series, alternating between campuses, and to revert the name of the series back to the Crosstown Shootout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Xavier, UC reach 10-year agreement to continue Crosstown Shootout, with rivalry returning to campuses |url=http://www.xavier.edu/news/Xavier-UC-reach-10-year-agreement-to-continue-Crosstown-Shootout-with-rivalry-returning-to-campuses.cfm#.VNmKWJ_X-_Q |website=xu.edu|publisher=Xavier University|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''23rd Ruler''' was an ''[[ajaw]]'' of the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] city of [[Tikal]]. He ruled c.635. Information about this ''ajaw'' and his successor [[24th Ruler]] are next to nothing. K'inich Muwaan Jol II is the best candidate to be 23rd or 24th Ruler because he could be a father of 25th ''ajaw'' [[Nuun Ujol Chaak]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2008, p.42.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''A. M. B. H. G. Abeyrathnebanda''' (also spelled '''Abeyrathne Banda''' in some sources, {{lang-si|A. M. B. H. G. අබේරත්නබණ්ඩා}}, died 29 January 2009) was a soldier in the [[Sri Lanka Army]]. He was killed in action during a battle against the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (commonly known as LTTE or Tamil Tigers) during the final stages of the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]]. He was posthumously awarded the [[Parama Weera Vibhushanaya]], the country's highest military award for gallantry, and is the youngest recipient of the medal.

==Military career==
After finishing basic military training, Abeyrathnebanda was assigned to the 21st battalion of the [[Sri Lanka Sinha Regiment]]. The 21st Sinha Regiment was part of the 584 Brigade of the [[58 Division (Sri Lanka)|58 Division]]. He joined the unit on 1 January 2009.&lt;ref name="blacker" /&gt; His citation and army records identify him as a [[Army recruit|recruit]].&lt;ref name="citation" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ආරක්ෂක තත්ව වාර්තාව |trans-title=Security Situation Report |language=Sinhala |url=http://www.army.lk/sinhala.php?id=997 |publisher=Sri Lanka Army |date=19 May 2012 |accessdate=24 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210033741/http://www.army.lk/sinhala.php?id=997 |archivedate=10 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Action on 29 January 2009===
[[Mullaitivu]], the main military and administrative base of the Tamil Tigers, fell to the army on 25 January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sri Lankan troops capture rebels' major town|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-01/26/content_10719921.htm|accessdate=24 March 2013|newspaper=Xinhua|date=26 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tamil Tigers were then surrounded in the [[Puthukkudiyiruppu (Mullaitivu)|Puthukkudiyiruppu]] and [[Visuamadu]] areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wijayapala |first=Ranil |title=Army captures Mullaitivu |url=http://www.dailynews.lk/2009/01/26/sec01.asp |accessdate=24 March 2013 |newspaper=Daily News |date=26 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301065712/http://dailynews.lk/2009/01/26/sec01.asp |archivedate=1 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 58 Division was advancing towards Visuamadu along the [[A35 highway (Sri Lanka)|A35 highway]], and the task of attacking Visuamadu from the west was given to the 21st Sinha Regiment.&lt;ref name=blacker&gt;{{cite news|last=Blacker |first=David |title=Parama Weera: What it takes, and what it means |url=http://www.nation.lk/edition/special/item/6825-parama-weera-what-it-takes-and-what-it-means.html |accessdate=23 March 2013 |newspaper=The Nation |date=4 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120906065112/http://www.nation.lk/edition/special/item/6825-parama-weera-what-it-takes-and-what-it-means.html |archivedate=6 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The army launched their attack on the dawn of 29 January. A [[skirmish]] party was sent to capture a section of the Tamil Tiger defensive line in order to allow the rest of the regiment to launch the main offensive. Abeyrathnebanda was part of an eight-man team in this group. They reached the defensive line undetected under the cover of darkness, and assaulted a heavily fortified [[bunker]], which was their assigned target. The resistance was heavy, and although they managed to capture the bunker, Abeyrathnebanda was injured in the process.&lt;ref name=citation&gt;{{cite web|title=PWV Citation &amp;ndash; S/198852 Rec Abeyrathnebanda A.

However, they soon came under attack from positions in the Tamil Tigers' secondary defensive lines. As his team were pinned down and taking casualties, Abeyrathnebanda realised that their position would soon be overrun. He jumped out of the captured bunker and ran to the adjacent bunker along the connecting [[trench]]. Rushing amongst the attacking Tamil Tigers, he detonated a [[hand grenade]], killing them and himself. This caused the Tamil Tigers' attack to be delayed long enough for the main force of the 21st Sinha Regiment to arrive and reinforce the skirmish party.&lt;ref name="citation" /&gt;&lt;ref name="blacker" /&gt;

The battle ended in victory for the army.

'''Aldo Romeo Luigi Moro''' ({{IPA-it|ˈaldo ˈmɔːro|lang}}; 23 September 1916 – 9 May 1978) was an Italian statesman and a prominent member of the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]] party. He served as [[List of Prime Ministers of Italy|38th Prime Minister of Italy]], from 1963 to 1968, and then from 1974 to 1976. He was one of Italy's [[List of Prime Ministers of Italy by time in office|longest-serving]] post-war Prime Ministers, holding power for a combined total of more than six years. Due to his accommodation with the Communist leader [[Enrico Berlinguer]], known as the [[Historic Compromise]], Moro is widely considered one of the most prominent fathers of the [[Centre-left in Italy|Italian centre-left]] and one of the greatest and most popular leaders in the history of the Italian Republic.

Moro was considered an intellectual and a patient mediator, especially in the internal life of his party. [[Kidnapping of Aldo Moro|He was kidnapped]] on 16 March 1978 by the [[Red Brigades]] and killed after 55 days of captivity.

==Early life==
Aldo Moro was born in 1916 in [[Maglie]], near [[Lecce]], in the [[Apulia]] region, into a family from [[Ugento]]. His father was a school inspector, while his mother was a [[teacher]]. At age of 4, he moved with his family to [[Milan]], but they soon moved back to Apulia, where he gained a classical high school degree at [[Archytas|Archita]] [[lyceum]] in [[Taranto]]. Until 1939, he studied Law at the [[University of Bari]], an institution where he was later to hold the post of ordinary professor (an equivalent to a tenured, full professor in the U.S. academic system) of Philosophy of Law and Colonial Policy (1941) and of [[Criminal Law]] (1942).

In 1935, he joined the [[Italian Catholic Federation of University Students]] (''Federazione Universitaria Cattolica Italiana'', FUCI) of [[Bari]]. In 1939, under approval of [[Giovanni Battista Montini]] whom he had befriended, Moro was chosen as president of the association; he kept the post until 1942 when he was forced to fight in the [[World War II]] and was succeeded by [[Giulio Andreotti]], who at the time was a law student from [[Rome]]. During his university years, Italy was ruled by the [[Fascism|fascist regime]] of [[Benito Mussolini]], and Moro took part in students competitions known as Lictors of Culture and Art organised by local fascist students' organisation, the University Fascist Groups.&lt;ref&gt;Renato Moro, ''Aldo Moro negli anni della FUCI'', Studium 2008;  Tiziano Torresi ''L'altra giovinezza. Gli universitari cattolici dal 1935 al 1940'', Cittadella editrice 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, along with other Catholic students, he founded the periodical ''La Rassegna'', which was published until 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[http://corrieredelmezzogiorno.corriere.it/bari/arte_e_cultura/16_settembre_22/vi-racconto-storia-dimenticata-giovane-aldo-moro-destra-407cdf52-809e-11e6-b5d0-e57316e71892_preview.shtml?reason=unauthenticated&amp;cat=1&amp;cid=MSi5_Ra1&amp;pids=FR&amp;origin=http%3A%2F%2Fcorrieredelmezzogiorno.corriere.it%2Fbari%2Farte_e_cultura%2F16_settembre_22%2Fvi-racconto-storia-dimenticata-giovane-aldo-moro-destra-407cdf52-809e-11e6-b5d0-e57316e71892.shtml Vi racconto la storia dimenticata del giovane Aldo Moro di destra]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1943, Moro contributed, along with Mario Ferrari Aggradi, [[Paolo Emilio Taviani]], Guido Gonella, [[Giuseppe Capogrossi|Giuseppe Capograssi]], Ferruccio Pergolesi, [[Vittore Branca]], [[Giorgio La Pira]], [[Giuseppe Medici]] and Andreotti, to the creation of the [[Codice di Camaldoli|Code of Camaldoli]], a document planning of economic policy drawn up by members of the Italian Catholic forces. The Code served as inspiration and guideline for economic policy of the future Christian Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Turn of Camaldoli , in State and Economy , then resumed with the same intent in Paolo Emilio Taviani, Because the Code of Camaldoli was a turning point in " Civitas ", XXXV,|last=|first=|publisher=|date=July–August 1984|isbn=|location=|pages=}}{{clarify|reason=this is a non-nonsensical 'reference'|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=From the welfare state to the welfare society. Social Theology and Pastoral Action of Italian Caritas , Effatà Editrice|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2006|isbn=88-7402-301-4|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, he married Eleonora Chiavarelli (1915–2010), with whom he had four children: Maria Fida (born 1946), Agnese (1952), Anna, and Giovanni (1958). In 1963 Moro was transferred to [[La Sapienza University]] of Rome, as a professor of the Institutions of Law and Criminal Procedure.

==Early political career==
Aldo Moro developed his interest in politics between 1943 and 1945. Initially, he seemed to be very interested in the social-democratic component of the [[Italian Socialist Party]], but then he started cooperating with other Christian democratic politician in opposition to the fascist regime. During this years he met [[Alcide De Gasperi]], [[Mario Scelba]], [[Giovanni Gronchi]] and [[Amintore Fanfani]]. On 19 March 1943 the group reunited in the house of [[Giuseppe Spataro]] officially formed the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]] (DC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.30giorni.it/articoli_id_12625_l1.htm I ricordi di Andreotti]&lt;/ref&gt; In the DC, he joined the left-wing faction led by [[Giuseppe Dossetti]]. In 1945 he became director of the magazine ''Studium'' and president of the Graduated Movement of the [[Azione Cattolica|Catholic Action]], a widespread [[Roman Catholic]] lay association.

In 1946, he was nominated vice-president of the Christian Democracy and [[Italian general election, 1946|elected]] member of the [[Constituent Assembly of Italy|Constitutional Assembly]], where he took part in the work to redact the [[Italian Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.istitutodegasperi-emilia-romagna.it/pdf/seminari2014_moro.pdf Aldo Moro, Intervento all'Assemblea Costituente]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948 [[Italian general election, 1948|he was elected]] to the [[Italian Chamber of Deputies]] and nominated vice-minister of Foreign Affairs in the [[De Gasperi V Cabinet]], from 23 May 1948 to 27 January 1950.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.governo.it/i-governi-dal-1943-ad-oggi/i-legislatura-8-maggio-1948-4-aprile-1953/governo-de-gasperi-v/3228 Governo De Gasperi V]&lt;/ref&gt;

After Dossetti's retirement in 1952, Moro founded, along with [[Antonio Segni]], [[Emilio Colombo]] and [[Mariano Rumor]], the Democratic Initiative faction, led by his old friend Fanfani.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.storiadc.it/correnti.html Storia della Democrazia Cristiana. Le correnti]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In government==
In 1953, Moro [[Italian general election, 1953|was re-elected]] to the Chamber of Deputies, where he held the position of chairman of the DC parliamentary group. In 1955 was appointed as [[Italian Minister of Justice|Minister of Grace and Justice]] in the cabinet led by Antonio Segni. In the following year he resulted among the most voted during the party's congress.

In May 1957 he was appointed [[Italian Minister of Education]] in the government of [[Adone Zoli]] and was confirmed by Fanfani in June 1958. He remained in office until February 1959, and during his tenure he introduced the study of [[civic education]] in schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corriere.it/scuola/speciali/2014/educazione-civica/notizie/educazione-civica-cittadinanza-costituzione-aldo-moro-gelmini-roberto-benigni-2c5712bc-ab59-11e3-a415-108350ae7b5e_preview.shtml?reason=unauthenticated&amp;cat=1&amp;cid=k3Y6MnEt&amp;pids=FR&amp;origin=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.corriere.it%2Fscuola%2Fspeciali%2F2014%2Feducazione-civica%2Fnotizie%2Feducazione-civica-cittadinanza-costituzione-aldo-moro-gelmini-roberto-benigni-2c5712bc-ab59-11e3-a415-108350ae7b5e.shtml L'ora mancante di Educazione Civica]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/SoleOnLine4/Italia/2008/08/scuola-educazione-civica.shtml Ritorno a scuola, educazione civica in 33 ore]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adnkronos.com/fatti/politica/2015/06/14/scuola-parlamento-prepara-ritorno-grande-stile-dell-educazione-civica_bYnc3FwzLXTiMLgOCKzUgM.html?refresh_ce Scuola, il Parlamento prepara il ritorno in grande stile dell'educazione civica]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1959, after Fanfani's resignation as [[Prime Minister of Italy|Prime Minister]] a new congress was called. The leaders of the Democratic Initiative faction reunited themselves in the [[convent]] of [[Dorothea of Caesarea]], where they abandoned the leftist policies promoted by Fanfani and founded the ''Dorotei'' (Dorotheans) faction. In the party's National Council, Moro was elected [[List of Secretaries of the Italian Christian Democracy|Secretary]] of DC and was then confirmed in the October's congress held in [[Florence]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.storiadc.it/congressi/congr_07.html VII Congresso Nazionale della Democrazia Cristiana]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the government led by [[Fernando Tambroni]] in 1960, supported by the decisive votes of the neo-fascist [[Italian Social Movement]], the renovated alliance between Moro as secretary and Fanfani as Prime Minister, led the subsequent National Congress, held in [[Naples]] in 1962 to approve with a large majority a line of collaboration with the [[Italian Socialist Party]].

The [[Italian general election, 1963|1963 general election]] was characterized by a lack of consensus for the DC; in fact the election fell after the launch of the [[centre-left]] formula by the Christian Democracy, a coalition based upon the alliance with the Socialists which had left its alignment with the [[Soviet Union]]. Some rightist electors abandoned the DC for the [[Italian Liberal Party]], which was asking for a [[centre-right]] government and received votes also from the quarrelsome monarchist area. Moro refused the office of Prime Minister, preferring to provisionally maintain his more influent post at the head of the party: this fact confirmed the transformation of Italian political system into a [[particracy]], the secretaries of the parties having become more powerful than the Parliament and the Government.&lt;ref&gt;Italian electors effectively lost any chance to decide their Prime Minister until the majoritarian reform of 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; However the Christian Democrats decided to replace incumbent Premier [[Amintore Fanfani]] with a provisional administration led by impartial Speaker of the House, [[Giovanni Leone]]; but, when the congress of the PSI in autumn authorized a full engagement of the party into the government, Leone resigned and Moro became the new Prime Minister.

==First term as Prime Minister==
[[File:Moro camera 1962.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Moro speaks to the [[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]], 1963.]]
Aldo Moro's government was unevenly supported by the DC, but also by the Italian Socialist Party, along with the minor [[Italian Republican Party]] and [[Italian Democratic Socialist Party]]. The coalition was also known as [[Organic Centre-left]] and was characterized by [[consociationalist]] and [[social corporatism|social corporatist]] tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cinquant’anni fa nasceva il centrosinistra poi arrivarono i ‘nani’ della politica|url=http://www.avantionline.it/2013/11/cinquantanni-fa-nasceva-il-centrosinistra-poi-arrivarono-i-nani-della-politica/#.UptJsXi9Kc0|author=Sabattini, Gianfranco|date=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social reforms===
During Moro's premiership, a wide range of social reforms were carried out. The 1967 Bridge Law (''Legge Ponte'') introduced urgent housing provisions as part of an envisioned reform of the entire sector, such as the introduction of minimum standards for housing and environment. A law promulgated on 14 December 1963 introduced an annual allowance for [[university]] students with income below a given level. Another law, promulgated on 10 March 1968, introduced voluntary public pre-elementary education for children aged three to five years. A law promulgated on 21 July 1965 introduced new [[pension]] provisions under the general scheme.

Moreover, the legal minima was raised, all current pensions were revalued, seniority pensions were introduced (after 35 years of contributions workers could retire even before attaining pensionable age), and within the Social Security National Institute (INPS), a Social Fund (''Fondo Sociale'') was established, ensuring to all members pensioners a basic uniform pension largely financed by state, known as the social pension (not related to the later social pension introduced in 1968). A law of 22 July 1966 extended pension insurance to small traders, while law of 22 July 1966 extended health insurance to retired traders, and a law of 29 May 1967 extended compulsory [[health insurance]] to retired farmers, tenant farmers, and sharecroppers, and extended health insurance to the unemployed in receipt of unemployment benefits.

A law approved on 18 March 1968 introduced the principle of earnings-related pensions within the general scheme, with the pension formula to equal 1.626% of average earnings in the last 3 years of work multiplied by the number of contribution years (maximum pension: 65% of previous earnings) up to 40. A law of 5 November 1968 extended family allowances to the [[unemployed]] in receipt of unemployment benefits.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Growth to Limits: The Western European Welfare States Since World War II Volume 4 edited by Peter Flora&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vajont Dam disaster===
On 9 October 1963, during initial filling, a massive landslide caused a man-made [[megatsunami]] in the lake of the [[Vajont Dam]] in which 50 million cubic metres of water overtopped the dam in a wave {{convert|250|metre|ft}} high, leading to the complete destruction of several villages and towns, and 1,910 deaths. This event occurred when the company and the [[Italian government]] dismissed evidence and concealed reports describing the geological instability of [[Monte Toc]] on the southern side of the basin, and other early warning signs reported prior to the disaster. Estimates of the dead range from 1,900 to 2,500 people, and about 350 families lost all members.

Numerous warnings, signs of danger, and negative appraisals had been disregarded, and the eventual attempt to safely control the landslide into the lake by lowering its level came when the landslide was almost imminent and was too late to prevent it. Although the dam itself remained almost intact, and two thirds of the water was retained behind it, the landslide was much larger than expected and the impact brought massive flooding and destruction to the [[Piave (river)|Piave]] valley below.

After the tragedy, Moro immediately dismissed the administrative officials who had supervised the construction of the dam.

===Coalition crisis===
[[File:Aldo Moro and Pietro Nenni.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Aldo Moro with the Socialist leader [[Pietro Nenni]].]]
On 25 June 1964, the government was beaten on the budget law for the [[Italian Ministry of Education]] concerning the financing of private education, and on the same day Moro resigned. The rightist Christian Democratic [[President of Italy]], [[Antonio Segni]], during the presidential consultations for the formation of a new cabinet, asked the socialist leader [[Pietro Nenni]] to exit from the government majority.&lt;ref&gt;[[Indro Montanelli]], ''Storia d'Italia'' Vol. 10, ''RCS Quotidiani'', [[Milan]], 2004, page 379-380&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 July, Segni sent the [[Carabinieri]] general, Giovanni De Lorenzo, to a meeting of representatives of the DC, to deliver a message that, according to some historians, it referred to the availability of the president, if the negotiations for the formation of a new center-left government had failed, to confer a subsequent mandate to the President of the Senate [[Cesare Merzagora]], for the formation of a "president's government", composed by all the conservative forces in the Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Gianni Flamini, ''L'Italia dei colpi di Stato'', Newton Compton Editori, [[Rome]], page 82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sergio Romano, ''Cesare Merzagora: uno statista contro I partiti'', in: [[Corriere della Sera]], 14 marzo 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Moro, on the other hand, managed to put back a centre-left majority and, on 17 July, went to the Quirinale, with the acceptance of the assignment and the list of ministers of his second government. During the negotiations, Nenni had accepted the downsizing of his reform programs.

===Saragat's election===
On 6 December 1964, President Segni resigned because of a [[thrombosis]]. In the [[Italian presidential election, 1964|presidential election]] of December, Moro and his majority tried to elected a leftist as President. On the twenty-first round of voting, the leader of [[Italian Democratic Socialist Party]] and former President of the [[Constituent Assembly of Italy|Constituent Assembly]] [[Giuseppe Saragat]] was elected [[President of Italy|President]] with 646 votes out of 963. Saragat was the first left-wing politician to become President of the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/21/1964-tempers-flare-as-italian-parliament-fails-to-elect-new-president/?_r=0 Tempers Flare as Italian Parliament Fails to Elect New President]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://storia.camera.it/presidenti/saragat-giuseppe I Presidenti – Giuseppe Saragat]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resignation===
The centre-left coalition, the first one for the Italian post-war political panorama, stayed in power until the [[Italian general election, 1968|1968 general elections]], despite the strong opposition of Segni and other rightist Christian Democrats. His third cabinet (1966–68) stayed in power for 833 days, a record for Italy's so-called "[[Politics of Italy#First Republic|First Republic]]".

==Minister of Foreign Affairs==
In the 1968 DC's congress, Moro yielded the Secretariat and passed to internal opposition. On 5 August 1969, he was appointed [[Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs]] by Prime Minister [[Mariano Rumor]]; he also held this office under the premierships of [[Emilio Colombo]] and [[Giulio Andreotti]].&lt;ref&gt;''Appunti trasmessi dalla Presidenza del Consiglio con missiva'', 27 January 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his ministry, he continued the pro-Arab policy of his predecessor Fanfani. Moro forced [[Yasser Arafat]] to promise not to carry out [[terrorist attack]]s in Italian territory, with a commitment that was named "Moro pact".&lt;ref&gt;Sergio Flamigni, ''La tela del ragno. Il delitto Moro'' (page 197-198), Kaos edizioni, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Tribunale di Venezia'', procedimento penale nº204 del 1983, page 1161-1163.&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of this pact and its validity was confirmed by [[Bassam Abu Sharif]], a long-time leader of the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]]. Interviewed by the Italian newspaper ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' he confirmed the existence of an agreement with the Popular Front thanks to whom, the PFLP could "transport weapons and explosives, guaranteeing immunity from attacks in return". Abu Sharif also declared:" I personally followed the negotiations for the agreement. Aldo Moro was a great man, a true patriot, who wanted to save Italy some headaches, but I never met him. We discussed the details with an admiral and agents of the [[Italian secret service]]. The agreement was defined and since then we have always respected it; we were allowed to organize small transits, passages, purely Palestinian operations, without involving Italians. After the deal, every time I came to Rome, two cars were waiting for me to protect myself. For our part, we also guaranteed to avoid embarrassment to your country, that is attacks which started directly from the Italian soil."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Corriere della Sera]]'', 14 August 2008, page 19&lt;/ref&gt; This version was confirmed also by former President of Italy [[Francesco Cossiga]], who stated that Moro was the real and only creator of the pact.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Corriere della Sera]]'', 15 August 2008, page 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lastampa.it/2017/07/02/esteri/fu-il-lodo-moro-a-tenere-gli-italiani-al-sicuro-a-beirut-nell-LRCq0taeanw3J8ejvwZF9M/pagina.html “Fu il Lodo Moro a tenere gli italiani al sicuro a Beirut nell’82”]&lt;/ref&gt;

Moro also had to cope with the difficult situation which erupted following the coup of [[Muammar Gaddafi]] in [[Libya]], a very important country for Italian interests not only for colonial ties, but also for its [[energy resources]] and the presence of about 20 thousand Italians.

In the [[Italian presidential election, 1971|1971 presidential election]], after the fall of Fanfani's candidacy, the DC left-wing proposed Moro as new President; however the moderate conservative Christian Democrats [[Giovanni Leone]] narrowly won the election.

==Second term as Prime Minister==
From 1974 to 1976, he re-gained the post of Prime Minister, and concluded the [[Osimo Treaty]] with [[Yugoslavia]], defining the official partition of the [[Free Territory of Trieste]]. In 1976 he was elected President of the DC National Council.

A law of 9 June 1975 increased the number of eligible occupational diseases and extended the duration of benefits. A law of 3 June 1975 introduced various benefit improvements for pensioners. The multiplying coefficient was raised to 2% and applied to average earnings of the best 3 years in the last 10 years of work, and automatic annual adjustment of minimum pensions to increase of the minimum contractual wage in the industrial sector (with a smaller adjustment made for pensions higher than the minima). A law of 27 December 1975 introduced ''[[ad hoc]]'' upgrading of cash benefits for certain diseases and of all flat-rate allowances. A law of 14 July 1967 extended family allowances to self-employed farmers, sharecroppers, and tenant farmers. On 29 April 1976, pension linkage to the industrial wage was extended to civil servants.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Historic compromise===
{{main|Historic compromise}}
Moro was considered a very tenacious mediator, particularly skilled in coordinating the different internal trends of DC.

At the beginning of the 1960s, Moro was one of the most convinced supporters of an alliance between the DC and the Italian Socialist Party, in order to widen the majority and integrate the socialists in the government system. In the 1963 party congress in [[Naples]], he was able to convince the whole party directive of the strategy. The same happened in 1978, when he supported a "national solidarity" government with the backing of the [[Italian Communist Party]].

Moro's main aim was to widen the democratic base of the government: the cabinets should have been able to represent a bigger number of voters and parties. He thought of the DC as the fulcrum of a coalition system, on the principles of [[Consociationalism|consociative democracy]].

Moro faced big challenges, especially, the necessity to conciliate the Christian and popular mission of the ''Democrazia Cristiana'' with the rising [[laicist]] and liberal values of the Italian society in the 1960s, and the necessity to integrate new important social groups (youth, women, workers) in the democratic system. DC's mission, in Moro's vision, was intended to recover the popular class that supported [[Fascism]] and ferry them in the democratic system. The contradiction of Moro's political stance was in trying to reconcile the extreme mobility of social transformations with the continuity of the institutions of representative democracy, and the integration of the masses in the State, without falling into autocracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Sandro|last= Fontana|chapter= Moro e il sistema politico italiano|title=Cultura e politica nell'esperienza di Aldo Moro|publisher=Giuffrè|location= Milan|year= 1982|pages=183–184 |language=Italian |url=http://www-3.unipv.it/ilpolitico/quaderni/N18.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Aldo Moro Anefo.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Aldo Moro in 1978]]
Following the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], the Italian Socialist Party had taken a definitive distance from the [[Italian Communist Party]], and [[Pietro Nenni]] had collaborated with the DC in the early 1960s. After the rise of the Italian Communist Party of [[Enrico Berlinguer]] at the [[Italian general election, 1976|1976 general elections]], when the Communists scored 34,4% of the votes, Moro conceived the idea of a "national solidarity" cabinet, whose parliamentary base should include the Italian Communist Party as well. Moro's idea was openly criticised, as  such an "[[Historic Compromise]]" would have involved an Italian Communist Party which was still under direct influence from Moscow. Berlinguer openly defused the proposition.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

In 1976–1977, Berlinguer's Italian Communist Party broke with Moscow, and convened with the Spanish and French parties to draw the lines of [[Eurocommunism]]. Such a move made an eventual collaboration more acceptable for DC voters, and the two parties began an intense parliamentary debate, in a moment of deep social crises.

In 1977, Moro was personally involved in international disputes. He strongly defended [[Mariano Rumor]] during the parliamentary debate on the [[Lockheed scandal]], and some in the press reported that he might have been "Antelope Cobbler", an alleged bribe recipient. The accusation, aimed at politically destroying Moro and avoiding the risk of a "[[Historic Compromise]]" cabinet, failed when Moro was cleared on 3 March 1978, 13 days before his kidnapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Robin Erica|last= Wagner-Pacifici|title=The Moro Morality Play. Terrorism as Social Drama|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location= Chicago|year= 1986|pages=30–32}}, {{cite book|first= Paolo|last= Cucchiarelli|author2= Aldo Giannuli|title=Lo Stato parallelo|publisher=Gamberetti Editrice|location= Rome|year= 1997|page= 422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early-1978 proposition by Moro of a Christian Democracy-Italian Socialist Party cabinet supported also by the Italian Communist Party was strongly opposed by both super-powers. The United States feared that the collaboration of an Italian government with the Communists might have allowed these later to gain information on strategic [[NATO]] military plans and installations, and pass them to [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] agents. Moreover, the participation in government of the Communists in a Western country would have represented a cultural failure for the USA. The Soviets considered potential participation by the Italian Communist Party in a cabinet a form of emancipation from Moscow and rapprochement to the Americans, therefore also opposing it.

==Kidnapping and death==
{{main|Kidnapping of Aldo Moro}}
[[File:Aldo Moro br.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Moro, photographed during his kidnapping by the [[Red Brigades]]]]
On 16 March 1978, on Via Fani, a street in Rome, a unit of the militant far-left organisation known as the [[Red Brigades]] ({{Lang-it|Brigate Rosse}}) blocked the two-car convoy transporting Moro and kidnapped him, murdering his five bodyguards. At the time, all of the founding members of the Red Brigades were in jail; therefore, the organisation led by [[Mario Moretti]] that kidnapped Moro is said to be the "Second Red Brigades".

On the day of his kidnapping, Moro was on his way to a session of the Chamber of Deputies, where a discussion was to take place regarding a vote of confidence for a new government led by Giulio Andreotti (DC) that would have, for the first time, the support of the Communist Party. It was to be the first implementation of Moro's strategic political vision as defined by the ''[[Historic Compromise|Compromesso storico]]'' (historic compromise).

In the following days, trade unions called for a [[general strike]], while security forces made hundreds of raids in Rome, Milan, Turin, and other cities searching for Moro's location. Held for two months, he was allowed to send letters to his family and politicians. The government refused to negotiate, despite demands by family, friends and Pope Paul VI.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/16/newsid_4232000/4232691.stm 1978: Aldo Moro snatched at gunpoint], "On This Day", [[BBC]] {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Paul VI "offered himself in exchange ... for Aldo Moro".&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, J. Derek, and Bernard W. Bickers. ''A Short History of the Catholic Church''. London: Burns and Oates, 1983. 291.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the investigation of Moro's kidnapping, General [[Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa]] reportedly responded to a member of the security services who suggested torturing a suspected ''brigatista'', "Italy can survive the loss of Aldo Moro. It would not survive the introduction of torture."&lt;ref&gt;This is the widely-cited translation. Original Italian: ''L'Italia è un Paese democratico che poteva permettersi il lusso di perdere Moro non di introdurre la tortura'', "Italy is a democratic country that could allow itself the luxury of losing Moro, [but] not of the introduction of torture." [https://insorgenze.net/2014/04/09/il-prof-de-tormentis-e-la-pratica-del-waterboarding-in-italia/ Source]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Report of Conadep (National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons): Prologue – 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[Alan M. Dershowitz|Dershowitz, Alan M.]] ''Why Terrorism Works'', p.134, {{ISBN|978-0-300-10153-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Red Brigades initiated a secret trial where Moro was found guilty and sentenced to death. Then they sent demands to the Italian authorities, stating that unless 16 Red Brigades prisoners were released, Moro would be killed. The Italian authorities responded with a large-scale manhunt.&lt;ref&gt;''100 Years of Terror'', documentary by [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negotiations===
The Red Brigades proposed to exchange Moro's life for the freedom of several prisoners. There has been speculation that during his detention many knew where he was (in an apartment in Rome). When Moro was abducted, the government immediately took a hard line position: the "State must not bend" on 'terrorist demands'. Some contrasted this with the kidnapping of [[Ciro Cirillo]] in 1981, a minor political figure for whom the government negotiated. However, Cirillo was released for a monetary ransom, rather than the release of the imprisoned extremists.

On 2 April [[Romano Prodi]], [[Mario Baldassarri]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parlamento.it/parlam/bicam/terror/stenografici/steno35.htm 17 June 1998 hearing] of the ''Commissione parlamentare d'inchiesta sul terrorismo in Italia e sulle cause della mancata individuazione dei responsabili delle stragi'' directed by senator [[Giovanni Pellegrino]] {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Alberto Clò, of the faculty of the [[University of Bologna]], passed on a tip about a safe-house where the Red Brigades might have been holding Moro. Prodi claimed he had been given the tip by the founders of the Christian Democrats, from beyond a grave in a [[séance]] and a [[Ouija|Ouija board]], which gave the names of [[Viterbo]], [[Bolsena]] and [[Gradoli]].&lt;ref name="Peter Popham"&gt;{{cite news |first=Peter|last=Popham |title=''The seance that came back to haunt Romano Prodi''|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/the-seance-that-came-back-to-haunt-romano-prodi-517786.html |work=[[The Independent]]|date=2 December 2005|accessdate=28 November 2008|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Captivity letters===
[[File:Moro Andreotti.jpg|thumb|right|Aldo Moro with [[Giulio Andreotti]]]]
During this period, Moro wrote several letters to the leaders of the Christian Democrats and to Pope Paul VI, who later personally officiated in Moro's [[Mass (liturgy)|Funeral Mass]]. Some of those letters, at times very critical of Andreotti, were kept secret for more than a decade, and published only in the early 1990s. In his letters, Moro said that the state's primary objective should be saving lives, and that the government should comply with his kidnappers' demands. Most of the Christian Democrat leaders argued that the letters did not express Moro's genuine wishes, claiming they were written under duress, and thus refused all negotiation. This was in stark contrast to the requests of Moro's family. In his appeal to the terrorists, Pope Paul asked them to release Moro "without conditions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.raistoria.rai.it/articoli/lappello-di-paolo-vi-per-aldo-moro/12800/default.aspx|title=L'appello di Paolo VI per il rilascio di Moro|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Murder===
When the Red Brigades decided to murder Moro, they placed him in a car and told him to cover himself with a blanket saying that they were going to transport him to another location. After Moro was covered they shot him ten times. According to the official reconstruction after a series of trials, the killer was [[Mario Moretti]]. Moro's body was left in the trunk of a red [[Renault 4]] on Via Michelangelo Caetani towards the [[Tiber River]] near the [[Roman Ghetto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Giovanni|last=Fasanella|author2=Giuseppe Roca|title=The Mysterious Intermediary. Igor Markevitch and the Moro affair|publisher=Einaudi|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the recovery of Moro's body, the [[Italian Minister of the Interior|Minister of the Interior]] [[Francesco Cossiga]] resigned.

===Antonio Negri's 1979 arrest and release===
On 7 April 1979, [[Marxist philosopher]] [[Antonio Negri]] was arrested along with other leaders of ''[[Autonomia Operaia]]'' ([[Oreste Scalzone]], E. Vesce, A. Del Re, L. Ferrari Bravo, [[Franco Piperno]] and others). Pietro Calogero, an attorney close to the Italian Communist Party, accused the Autonomia group of masterminding left-wing terrorism in Italy. Negri was charged with a number of offences including leadership of the Red Brigades, being behind Moro's kidnapping and murder, and plotting to overthrow the government. A year later, he was found innocent of Moro's murder.

In 2003, [[Alexander Stille]] accused Negri of bearing moral but not legal responsibility for the crimes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://waam.net/jhjournal/view_article.php?a_no=124&amp;p_no=1 안또니오 네그리의 글모음] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928121613/http://waam.net/jhjournal/view_article.php?a_no=124&amp;p_no=1 |date=28 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Revelations and Controversies===
[[File:AldoMoro ViaCaetani.jpg|thumb|right|Memorial to Aldo Moro, in via Caetani, [[Rome]]]]
In 2005, [[Sergio Flamigni]], a leftist politician and writer, who had served on a parliamentary inquiry on the Moro case, suggested the involvement of the [[Operation Gladio]] network directed by [[NATO]]. He asserted  that [[Gladio in Italy|Gladio]] had manipulated Moretti as a way to take over the [[Red Brigades]] in order to effect a [[strategy of tension]] aimed at creating popular demand for a new, right-wing law-and-order regime.&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Fasanella and Alberto Franceschini (with a postscript by Judge Rosario Priore, a judge in the Moro case), ''Che cosa sono le Brigate Rosse'' ("What are the Red Brigades"), Published in French as ''Brigades rouges: L'histoire secrète des BR racontée par leur fondateur'' (Red Brigades: The secret [hi]story of the RBs, recounted by their founder), Alberto Franceschini, with Giovanni Fasanella. Editions Panama, 2005, {{ISBN|2-7557-0020-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.repubblica.it/online/politica/propeco/andreotti/andreotti.html Omicidio Pecorelli – Andreotti condannato], ''[[La Repubblica]], 17 November 2002 {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the Harvard and MIT educated American psychiatrist and former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Management, [[Steve Pieczenik]], was interviewed by Emmanuel Amara in his documentary film ''Les derniers jours d'Aldo Moro'' ("The Last Days of Aldo Moro"). In the interview, Pieczenik, an expert on international terrorism and negotiating strategies who had been brought to Italy as a consultant to Interior Minister [[Francesco Cossiga]]'s Crisis Committee, stated that: "We had to sacrifice Aldo Moro to maintain the stability of Italy."&lt;ref name=Pieczenik&gt;Emmanuel Amara, ''Les derniers jours d'Aldo Moro'' (''The Last Days of Aldo Moro''), [http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4ajky_a-propos-de-la-mort-daldo-moro-12_politics Interview of Steve Pieczenik put on-line] by [[Rue 89]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=R89&gt;Hubert Artus, [http://www.rue89.com/cabinet-de-lecture/pourquoi-le-pouvoir-italien-a-lache-aldo-moro-execute-en-1978 Pourquoi le pouvoir italien a lâché Aldo Moro, exécuté en 1978] (Why the Italian Power let go of Aldo Moro, executed in 1978), ''[[Rue 89]]'', 6 February 2008 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pieczenik maintained that the U.S. had had to "instrumentalize the Red Brigades." According to him, the decision to have Moro killed was taken during the fourth week of his detention, when Moro was thought to be revealing state secrets in his letters,&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel Amara, ''Les derniers jours d'Aldo Moro'' (The Last Days of Aldo Moro), [http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4ajp8_a-propos-de-la-mort-daldo-moro-22_politics Interview of Steve Pieczenik &amp; Francesco Cossiga put on-line] by [[Rue 89]]&lt;/ref&gt; namely, the existence of Gladio.&lt;ref name=R89/&gt; In another interview former interior minister [[Francesco Cossiga|Cossiga]] revealed that the Crisis Committee had also leaked a false statement [[Black Propaganda|attributed to the Red Brigades]] that Moro was already dead. This was intended to communicate to the kidnappers that further negotiations would be useless, since the government had written Moro off.&lt;ref name='R000006'&gt;{{cite news | first=Malcolm | last=Moore | coauthors= | title=US envoy admits role in Aldo Moro killing | date= 11 March 2008| publisher= | url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1581425/US-envoy-admits-role-in-Aldo-Moro-killing.html | work =[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] | pages = | accessdate = 12 November 2008 | language = | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='zeit-fragen'&gt;{{cite news|first= |last= |coauthors= |title=Europa nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg:Freiheitliche Demokratien oder Satelliten der USA? |date=9 June 2008 |publisher=.zeit-fragen.ch |url=http://www.zeit-fragen.ch/ausgaben/2008/nr24-vom-962008/europa-nach-dem-zweiten-weltkrieg-freiheitliche-demokratien-oder-satelliten-der-usa/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620233019/http://www.zeit-fragen.ch/ausgaben/2008/nr24-vom-962008/europa-nach-dem-zweiten-weltkrieg-freiheitliche-demokratien-oder-satelliten-der-usa/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=20 June 2008 |work= |pages= |accessdate=12 November 2008 |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible beatification===
According to media reports on 26 September 2012, the [[Holy See]] has received a file on [[beatification]] for Moro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/vaticancityandholysee/9569471/Murdered-Italian-PM-Aldo-Moro-could-be-beatified.html |title=Murdered Italian PM Aldo Moro 'could be beatified' |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=26 September 2012 |accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beatification is the first step to becoming a saint in the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Nicola Giampaolo serves as the postulator for the cause.

In April 2015, it was reported that controversies around Moro could cause the suspension or closing of the cause. The postulator has stated the cause will continue when the discrepancies are cleared up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://translate.google.com.au/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=it&amp;u=http://corrieredelmezzogiorno.corriere.it/bari/politica/15_aprile_24/troppe-polemiche-aldo-moro-rischio-stop-la-beatificazione-5d5729a0-eab0-11e4-a600-a09787236cc5.shtml|title=Controversies around Aldo Moro risks a stop for beatification (in Italian)|publisher=Corriere del Mezzogiorno|date=24 April 2015|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The halting of proceedings was due to [[Antonio Mennini]], the priest who heard his last confession, being allowed to provide a statement to a tribunal in regards to Moro's kidnapping and confession. The cause was able to resume its initial investigations following this.

==Cinematic adaptations==

*''[[Romanzo Criminale]]'' (2005), directed by [[Michele Placido]], portrays the authorities finding Moro's body
*''Les derniers jours d'Aldo Moro'' (''The Last Days of Aldo Moro'', 2006)
*''[[Il divo (film)|Il Divo]] (2008): La Straordinaria vita di Giulio Andreotti'', directed by [[Paolo Sorrentino]], highlighting the responsibility of Giulio Andreotti
*''[[Piazza Fontana: The Italian Conspiracy]]'' (2012) (''Romanzo di una strage'') directed by [[Marco Tullio Giordana]], Aldo Moro portrayed by actor [[Fabrizio Gifuni]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3986">'''Alice of Bigorre''' (1217/1220-1255), also known as ''Alice'' or ''Alix de Monfort'' was ''[[suo jure]]'' ruling Countess of [[Bigorre]] between 1251 and 
1255. 

She was the eldest daughter of [[Petronilla, Countess of Bigorre]] and her third husband [[Guy, Count of Bigorre|Guy de Monfort]].&lt;ref&gt;Alfonse de Poitou Correspondance Tome II, 2087, p. 597.&lt;/ref&gt; Alice was married twice during her lifetime and from her first marriage, she gained the title of ''Lady of Chabanais''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/GASCONY.htm#MatheMarsanBigorreMGastonVIIBearn GASCONY, Medieval Lands]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
{{moresources|section|date=January 2018}}
Alice was born sometime between 1217 and 1220. She was the eldest child of her mother, she had one full sister also named Petronilla, who went on to marry Raoul de la Roche-Tesson. Her mother was married five times, her elder two daughters were the product of her third marriage. A fifth marriage to Boson of Mastas, Seigneur de Cognac, produced a half-sister named Martha, who married [[Gaston VII, Viscount of Béarn]]. Alice was cared for by her uncle, [[Amaury VI of Montfort]], while he had her mother remarried. By the time of Petronilla's fifth marriage and the birth of her daughter [[Martha of Marsan|Martha]], she needed a stronger union so had Alice married off to Jordan, Lord of Chabanais, a relative of Boson of Mastas.&lt;ref&gt;Merlet  ´Procès´, pg. 307.&lt;/ref&gt; An agreement was reached, upon Petronilla's death, Alice and Jordan would inherit Bigorre, whilst Martha would inherit her father's lands of Mastas. By 1247, Jordan had died and so Alice was left with their three children. She married for a second time to Raoul de Courtenay during 1247.&lt;ref&gt;Merlet ´Procès´, Pièces Justificatives, X, p. 318, quoting Cartulaire de Bigorre, ch. 21, 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had a daughter named Matilda who later married [[Philip of Chieti]].

===Reign===
{{unsourced|section|date=January 2018}}
In 1251, Petronilla died. However, she had passed control of the government over to [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester]], Alice's uncle. De Montfort had interpreted this act as a gift, so refused to hand Bigorre over to Alice on the death of her mother.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionnaire de la conversation et de la lecture, 2nd Edition, Vol.3, Ed. William Duckett, (Aux Comptoirs de la Direction, 1856), 200.&lt;/ref&gt; Alice and her husband appealed to her half-sister Martha and her husband [[Gaston VII, Viscount of Béarn]] to help re-claim Bigorre, they accepted. To prevent Guyenne and Gascony from rebelling, [[Henry III of England]] recalled Simon de Montfort and appointed John Grailly in his place. However, Alice and her family re-claimed Bigorre during 1251. Alice reigned only for the next four years, dying in 1255. She was succeeded by her eldest son. However, following Alice's death, De Montfort did attempt to challenge her son for control of Bigorre once again. Upon Eskivat's death, control of Bigorre was disputed between Alice's sister Martha and her daughter Laura, with the latter eventually succeeding.

==Issue==
The marriage between Alice and Jordan produced three children:
*[[Eskivat de Chabanais|Eskivat]] (died 1283), succeeded his mother, married Mascarós II d'Armagnac, Countess of Armagnac and Fézensac  but had no children.
*Jordan (died before 1283) named as heir to his brother but predeceased him 
*Laura (c.1240-1316), fought with her aunt Martha for control of Bigorre on the death of her brother. Married firstly to Simon of Rochechouart, lord of Availles, and secondly to Viscount Raymond V of Turenne. Laura had three children, all by her first marriage.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5331">'''Art''' and '''morality''' have been discussed, compared and linked for as long as they have been identified as concepts.

== History and ideas ==
In the PL7, Zio Nirchio ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Plato. ''Plato in Twelve Volumes'' cit. by PL7, Vols. 5 &amp; 6 translated by Paul Shorey. Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd. 1969. {{ISBN|0-674-99262-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]] saw the function of the [[actor]] as bogus, presenting a dangerous illusion of reality, and masking the truth of existence by the pretence of acting. [[Aristotle]], in ''[[The Poetics]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. ''Aristotle in 23 Volumes'', Vol. PL7, translated by W. H. Fyfe. Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd. 1932. {{ISBN|0-674-99563-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; saw the role of the actor somewhat differently, suggesting that by witnessing ''pity and fear'' (in his view the essence of [[tragedy]]) on stage, an audience could experience a [[catharsis]] of the emotions associated with real tragic events, without having to experience them as first-hand participants.

Since then, the 'stand-off' between those who have seen art as having a direct impact on morality, and those who have asserted its independence, has persisted. [[Tolstoy]] was ambivalent about the role of the artist (despite being one himself). In ''[[What is Art?]]'' he castigated now-[[Western canon|canon]]ical artists such as [[Shakespeare]], [[Goethe]] and [[Wagner]] for failing to express the 'simple truths' about morality (as he saw them), opting instead to show off their poetic cleverness. He saw their work as morally reprehensible, effectively a wasting of their talents through their failure to communicate moral truth to the masses.

Since the late nineteenth century and beyond, with the development of '[[the Arts]]' as a cultural concept, the debate about art and morality has intensified, with the ever more challenging activities of artists becoming targets for those who see art as an influence for bad or good, and it has been a mainstay of many art critics' negative reviews. [[John Ruskin]] accused [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|Whistler]] of "flinging a pot of paint in the face of the audience",&lt;ref&gt;Parkes, Adam.  "A Sense of Justice: Whistler, Ruskin, James, Impressionism", ''Victorian Studies'' Volume 42, Number 4&lt;/ref&gt; and several of the ballets of [[Diaghilev]] scandalised audiences with their explicit (at the time) sexual themes.

Whistler and Ruskin eventually went face-to-face in the courtroom. But in 1961, one of the most [[Lady Chatterley's Lover#Controversy|famous legal clashes]] between art and morality occurred when [[Penguin Books]] were taken to court over their publication of [[D. H. Lawrence]]'s novel ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Lady Chatterley's Trial'', Penguin Books {{ISBN|0-14-102232-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in 1977 the Christian morality campaigner [[Mary Whitehouse]] successfully sued a magazine, ''[[Gay News]]'', under [[blasphemous libel]] laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In [[popular culture]], [[pornography]] (if seen in aesthetic terms) is used as an example of the [[objectification]] of women, and violent films have been cited as the influence for so-called ''[[Copycat crimes|copycat]]'' acts in reality. An example of this was the [[Hungerford Massacre]], where a gunman was alleged by the [[tabloid press]] to have been influenced by the ''[[Rambo (film series)|Rambo]]'' series of films starring [[Sylvester Stallone]].

In September 2001, shortly after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|World Trade Center Attack]], the German composer [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] said of the atrocity that it was "Lucifer's greatest work of art."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.osborne-conant.org/documentation_stockhausen.htm The Stockhausen Affair&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stockhausen.org/message_from_karlheinz.html Stockhausen's response&lt;/ref&gt; (However, Stockhausen's comments were taken out of context and misunderstood.) The responses were immediate and extreme, fuelled once again by the tabloid press. Some have found, here and elsewhere, art in the service of morality to be politically dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.necessaryprose.com/badart.htm Bad Art: The Iraq War out of Context&lt;/ref&gt;

In purely philosophical terms, the precise nature of art's links with morality have been long been questioned. Some have found no link between the aesthetic and the moral (i.e. being morally reprehensible does not deny an artwork its art status; it does not cease having aesthetic value no matter how depraved some might see it being), whereas others, who have not gone down the explicitly Platonist route, have argued that the relationship is one akin to [[supervenience]]. Here, it is argued that an essential component of the production of art, the human factor, can only be made sensible if taken along with the perceived moral codes which govern humanity.

An '''artificial enzyme''' is a synthetic, organic molecule or ion that recreate some function of an enzyme.  The area promises to deliver catalysis at rates and selectivity observed in many enzymes.

== History==
[[Enzyme]] catalysis of chemical reactions occur with high selectivity and rate.  The substrate is activated in a small part of the enzyme's macromolecule called the [[active site]]. There, the binding of a [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] close to [[functional group]]s in the enzyme causes [[catalysis]] by so-called proximity effects. It is possible to create similar catalysts from [[small molecule]] by combining substrate-binding with catalytic functional groups. Classically artificial enzymes bind substrates using receptors such as [[cyclodextrin]], [[crown ethers]], and [[calixarene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Wiley: Artificial Enzymes - Ronald Breslow|url = http://as.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-3527311653.html|website = as.wiley.com|accessdate = 2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/ebook/9780854041756|title=From Enzyme Models to Model Enzymes|last=Kirby|first=Anthony J|last2=Hollfelder|first2=Florian|date=2009-10-01|isbn=9780854041756|doi=10.1039/9781847559784}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artificial enzymes based on [[amino acid]]s or [[peptide]]s as characteristic molecular moieties have expanded the field of artificial enzymes or enzyme mimics. For instance, scaffolded histidine residues mimics certain [[metalloproteins]] and -enzymes such as [[hemocyanin]], [[tyrosinase]], and [[catechol oxidase]]).&lt;ref&gt;Scaffolded amino acids as a close structural mimic of type-3 copper binding sites.

The couple's request was unusual in that, while George Coumbias suffers from heart disease, Betty Coumbias was reported to be in excellent health.&lt;ref name="thestar"&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/667090 Deaths reignite assisted-suicide debate] July 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;   
    
Ludwig Minelli, director of Swiss assisted-suicide group [[Dignitas (euthanasia group)|Dignitas]], petitioned the [[Canton of Zurich]] to grant doctors the authority to issue lethal drugs to healthy people, after they have been counseled by his organization, hoping to facilitate the Coumbias' suicide pact.&lt;ref name="thestar" /&gt;

In 2009, Betty Coumbias developed cancer and died, while George continued to live with his heart condition.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/suicidetourist/coumbias/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6582">In [[mathematics]], there are two competing definitions for a '''chiral polytope'''. One is that it is a [[polytope]] that is [[chirality (mathematics)|chiral]] (or "enantiomorphic"), meaning that it does not have [[Reflection symmetry|mirror symmetry]]. By this definition, a polytope that lacks any symmetry at all would be an example of a chiral polytope. 

The other, competing definition of a chiral polytope is that it is a polytope that is as symmetric as possible without being mirror-symmetric, formalized in terms of the [[group action|action]] of the [[symmetry group]] of the polytope on its [[Flag (geometry)|flags]]. By this definition, even highly-symmetric and enantiomorphic polytopes such as the [[snub cube]] are not chiral. Much of the study of symmetric but chiral polytopes has been carried out in the framework of [[abstract polytope]]s, because of the paucity of geometric examples.

==Polytopes without mirror symmetry==

Many polytopes lack mirror symmetry, and in that sense form chiral polytopes.
The simplest example is a [[scalene triangle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Crystals and Crystal Structures|first=Richard J. D.|last=Tilley|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2006|isbn=9780470018217|page=44|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ilVvOYOFCx8C&amp;pg=PA44}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible for polytopes to have a high degree of symmetry, but yet to lack mirror symmetry; an example is the [[snub cube]], which is [[vertex-transitive]] and chiral in this sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Kaleidoscopes: Selected Writings|first=H. S. M.|last=Coxeter|authorlink=H. S. M. Coxeter|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=1995|isbn=9780471010036|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fUm5Mwfx8rAC&amp;pg=PA282|page=282}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symmetric chiral polytopes==
===Definition===
The more technical definition of a chiral polytope is a polytope that has two orbits of [[Flag (geometry)|flags]] under its [[symmetry group|group of symmetries]], with 
adjacent flags in different orbits. This implies that it must be [[vertex-transitive]], [[edge-transitive]], and [[face-transitive]], as each vertex, edge, or face must be represented by flags in both orbits; however, it cannot be mirror-symmetric, as every mirror symmetry of the polytope would exchange some pair of adjacent flags.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

For the purposes of this definition, the symmetry group of a polytope may be defined in either of two different ways: it can refer to the symmetries of a polytope as a geometric object (in which case the polytope is called ''geometrically chiral'') or it can refer to the symmetries of the polytope as a combinatorial structure (an [[abstract polytope]]). Chirality is meaningful for either type of symmetry but the two definitions classify different polytopes as being chiral or nonchiral.&lt;ref name="schulte04"&gt;{{citation

===In three dimensions===
In three dimensions, it is not possible for a geometrically chiral polytope  to have finitely many finite faces. For instance, the snub cube is vertex-transitive, but its flags have more than two orbits, and it is neither edge-transitive nor face-transitive, so it is not symmetric enough to meet the formal definition of chirality. The [[Quasiregular polyhedron|quasiregular polyhedra]] and their duals, such as the [[cuboctahedron]] and the [[rhombic dodecahedron]], provide another interesting type of near-miss: they have two orbits of flags, but are mirror-symmetric, and not every adjacent pair of flags belongs to different orbits. However, despite the nonexistence of finite chiral three-dimensional polyhedra, there exist infinite three-dimensional chiral [[Infinite skew polyhedron|skew polyhedra]] of types {4,6}, {6,4}, and {6,6}.&lt;ref name="schulte04"/&gt;

== Introduction to Neurofeedback ==

[[Neurofeedback]] ('''NFB'''), also called '''neurotherapy''', '''neurobiofeedback''' or '''EEG biofeedback''' ('''EEGBF''') is a therapy technique that presents the user with real-time information about activity within their brain, as measured by electrical or blood-flow sensors on the scalp. Brain activity is monitored and processed to provide feedback to the user in one of several ways, for example a video game rocket ship might accelerate when desired brainwaves are produced (positive feedback), or a film or music might pause when undesired brainwaves are produced (negative feedback).

The user then uses this feedback to develop the brainwaves they wish to create and as a consequence, learn to gain more control over their brainwaves and therefore how they think and feel in every day situations.  It has been used to help a range of conditions including ADHD and addictions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28630">'''Computational electromagnetics''', '''computational electrodynamics''' or '''electromagnetic modeling''' is the process of modeling the interaction of [[electromagnetic field]]s with physical objects and the environment.

It typically involves using computationally efficient approximations to [[Maxwell's equations]] and is used to calculate [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] performance, [[electromagnetic compatibility]], [[radar cross section]] and electromagnetic [[wave propagation]] when not in free space.

A specific part of computational electromagnetics deals with [[electromagnetic radiation]] [[light scattering by particles|scattered and absorbed by small particles]].

==Background==
&lt;!-- ''Why do electromagnetic modeling?   is being modeled?  What are the computational issues?''  {{Expand section|date=October 2008}} --&gt;
Several real-world electromagnetic problems like [[Scattering#Electromagnetic scattering|electromagnetic scattering]], [[electromagnetic radiation]], modeling of [[waveguide]]s etc., are
not analytically calculable, for the multitude of irregular geometries found in actual devices. Computational numerical techniques can overcome the inability to derive closed form solutions of Maxwell's equations under various [[constitutive relation]]s of media, and [[boundary condition]]s. This makes ''computational electromagnetics'' (CEM) important to the design, and modeling of antenna, radar, [[communication satellite|satellite]] and other communication systems, [[nanophotonic]] devices and high speed [[silicon]] electronics, [[medical imaging]], cell-phone antenna design, among other applications.

CEM typically solves the problem of computing the ''E'' (electric) and ''H'' (magnetic) fields across the problem domain (e.g., to calculate antenna [[radiation pattern]] for an arbitrarily shaped antenna structure). Also calculating power flow direction ([[Poynting vector]]), a waveguide's [[normal mode]]s, media-generated wave dispersion, and scattering can be computed from the ''E'' and ''H'' fields. CEM models may or may not assume [[symmetry]], simplifying real world structures to idealized [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]]s, [[sphere]]s, and other regular geometrical objects. CEM models extensively make use of symmetry, and solve for reduced dimensionality from 3 spatial dimensions to 2D and even 1D.

An [[Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace|eigenvalue]] problem formulation of CEM allows us to calculate steady state normal modes in a structure. [[Transient response]] and impulse field effects are more accurately modeled by CEM in time domain, by [[FDTD]]. Curved geometrical objects are treated more accurately as finite elements [[Finite element method|FEM]], or non-orthogonal grids. [[Beam propagation method]] (BPM) can solve for the power flow in waveguides. CEM is application specific, even if different techniques converge to the same field and power distributions in the modeled domain.

==Overview of methods==
One approach is to discretize the space in terms of grids (both orthogonal, and non-orthogonal) and solving Maxwell's equations at each point in the grid. Discretization consumes computer memory, and solving the equations takes significant time. Large-scale CEM problems face memory and CPU limitations. As of 2007, CEM problems require supercomputers,{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} high performance clusters,{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} vector processors and/or [[parallel computer|parallelism]]. Typical formulations involve either time-stepping through the equations over the whole domain for each time instant; or through banded [[matrix inversion]] to calculate the weights of basis functions, when modeled by finite element methods; or matrix products when using transfer matrix methods; or calculating [[integral]]s when using [[Boundary element method|method of moments]] (MoM); or using [[fast fourier transform]]s, and time iterations when calculating by the split-step method or by BPM.

==Choice of methods==
Choosing the right technique for solving a problem is important, as choosing the wrong one can either result in incorrect results, or results which take excessively long to compute. However, the name of a technique does not always tell one how it is implemented, especially for commercial tools, which will often have more than one solver.

Davidson&lt;ref name="davidson" /&gt; gives two tables comparing the FEM, MoM and FDTD techniques in the way they are normally implemented. One table is for both open region (radiation and scattering problems) and another table is for guided wave problems.

==Maxwell's equations in hyperbolic PDE form==
Maxwell's equations can be formulated as a [[hyperbolic system]] of [[partial differential equation]]s.  This gives access to powerful techniques for numerical solutions.

It is assumed that the waves propagate in the (''x'',''y'')-plane and restrict the direction of the magnetic field to be parallel to the ''z''-axis and thus the electric field to be parallel to the (''x'',''y'') plane. The wave is called a transverse magnetic (TM) wave.  In 2D and no polarization terms present, Maxwell's equations can then be formulated as:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\bar{u} + A\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\bar{u} + B\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\bar{u} +C\bar{u} = \bar{g}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''u'', ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' are defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{u}=\left(\begin{matrix} E_x \\ E_y \\ H_z \end{matrix}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A=\left(\begin{matrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{1}{\epsilon} \\ 0 &amp; \frac{1}{\mu} &amp; 0 \end{matrix}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;B=\left(\begin{matrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{-1}{\epsilon} \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ \frac{-1}{\mu} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{matrix}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;C=\left(\begin{matrix} \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon} &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{matrix}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

In this representation, &lt;math&gt;\bar{g}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[forcing function (differential equations)|forcing function]], and is in the same space as &lt;math&gt;\bar{u}&lt;/math&gt;.  It can be used to express an externally applied field or to describe an optimization [[constraint (mathematics)|constraint]].  As formulated above:
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{g}=\left(\begin{matrix} E_{x, constraint} \\ E_{y, constraint} \\ H_{z, constraint} \end{matrix}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\bar{g}&lt;/math&gt; may also be explicitly defined equal to zero to simplify certain problems, or to find a [[Generalized eigenvector|characteristic solution]], which is often the first step in a method to find the particular inhomogeneous solution.

==Integral equation solvers==

===The discrete dipole approximation===
The [[discrete dipole approximation]] is a flexible technique for computing scattering and absorption by targets of arbitrary [[geometry]]. The formulation is based on integral form of Maxwell equations. The DDA is an approximation of the continuum target by a finite array of polarizable points. The points acquire [[Magnetic moment|dipole moment]]s in response to the local electric field. The dipoles of course interact with one another via their electric fields, so the DDA is also sometimes referred to as the coupled [[dipole]] approximation. The resulting linear system of equations is commonly solved using [[conjugate gradient]] iterations. The discretization matrix has symmetries (the integral form of Maxwell equations has form of convolution) enabling [[Fast Fourier Transform]] to multiply matrix times vector during conjugate gradient iterations.

===Method of moments element method ===
The method of moments (MoM)&lt;ref&gt;Roger F. Harrington (1968). Field Computation by Moment Methods. Latest printing by IEEE Press in 1993, {{ISBN|0780310144}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[boundary element method]] (BEM) is a numerical computational method of solving linear partial differential equations which have been formulated as [[integral equation]]s (i.e. in ''boundary integral'' form). It can be applied in many areas of engineering and science including [[fluid mechanics]], [[acoustics]], [[electromagnetics]], [[fracture mechanics]], and [[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]].

MoM has become more popular since the 1980s. Because it requires calculating only boundary values, rather than values throughout the space, it is significantly more efficient in terms of computational resources for problems with a small surface/volume ratio. Conceptually, it works by constructing a "mesh" over the modeled surface.  However, for many problems, BEM are significantly computationally less efficient than volume-discretization methods ([[finite element method]], [[finite difference method]], [[finite volume method]]).  Boundary element formulations typically give rise to fully populated matrices. This means that the storage requirements and computational time will tend to grow according to the square of the problem size.  By contrast, finite element matrices are typically banded (elements are only locally connected) and the storage requirements for the system matrices typically grow linearly with the problem size.  Compression techniques (''e.g.'' multipole expansions or adaptive cross approximation/hierarchical matrices) can be used to ameliorate these problems, though at the cost of added complexity and with a success-rate that depends heavily on the nature and geometry of the problem.

BEM is applicable to problems for which [[Green's function]]s can be calculated.  These usually involve fields in [[linear]] [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]] media.  This places considerable restrictions on the range and generality of problems suitable for boundary elements.  Nonlinearities can be included in the formulation, although they generally introduce volume integrals which require the volume to be discretized before solution, removing an oft-cited advantage of BEM.

===Fast multipole method ===
The [[fast multipole method]] (FMM) is an alternative to MoM or Ewald summation. It is an accurate simulation technique and requires less memory and processor power than MoM. The FMM was first introduced by [[Leslie Greengard|Greengard]] and [[Vladimir Rokhlin (American scientist)|Rokhlin]]&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Greengard and Vladimir Rokhlin (1987). "A Fast Algorithm for Particle Simulations." J. Computational Physics Vol. 73, No. 2, pp 325-348.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Rokhlin (1985). "Rapid Solution of Integral Equations of Classic Potential Theory." J. Computational Physics Vol. 60, pp. 187-207.&lt;/ref&gt; and is based on the [[multipole expansion]] technique. The first application of the FMM in computational electromagnetics was by Engheta et al.(1992).&lt;ref&gt;Nader Engheta, William D. Murphy, Vladimir Rokhlin, and Marius Vassiliou (1992), "The Fast Multipole Method for Electromagnetic Scattering Computation," IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation 40, 634-641.&lt;/ref&gt;  FMM can also be used to accelerate MoM.

===Plane wave time-domain ===
While the fast multipole method is useful for accelerating MoM solutions of integral equations with static or frequency-domain oscillatory kernels, the '''plane wave time-domain (PWTD)''' algorithm employs similar ideas to accelerate the MoM solution of time-domain integral equations involving the [[retarded potential]]. The PWTD algorithm was introduced in 1998 by Ergin, Shanker, and Michielssen.&lt;ref&gt;Ergin, A. A., Shanker, B., &amp; Michielssen, E. (1998). Fast evaluation of three-dimensional transient wave fields using diagonal translation operators. Journal of Computational Physics, 146(1), 157-180.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partial element equivalent circuit method===
The [[partial element equivalent circuit]] (PEEC) is a 3D full-wave modeling method suitable for combined [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] and [[Electronic circuit|circuit]] analysis. Unlike MoM, PEEC is a full [[spectrum]] method valid from [[Direct current|dc]] to the maximum [[frequency]] determined by the meshing. In the PEEC method, the [[integral equation]] is interpreted as [[Kirchhoff's voltage law]] applied to a basic PEEC cell which results in a complete circuit solution for 3D geometries. The equivalent circuit formulation allows for additional [[SPICE]] type circuit elements to be easily included. Further, the models and the analysis apply to both the time and the frequency domains. The circuit equations resulting from the PEEC model are easily constructed using a modified [[loop analysis]] (MLA) or [[modified nodal analysis]] (MNA) formulation. Besides providing a direct current solution, it has several other advantages over a MoM analysis for this class of problems since any type of circuit element can be included in a straightforward way with appropriate matrix stamps. The PEEC method has recently been extended to include nonorthogonal geometries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1200853 A. E. Ruehli, G. Antonini, J. Esch, J. Ekman, A. Mayo, A. Orlandi, "Nonorthogonal PEEC formulation for time- and frequency-domain EM and circuit modeling," IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility, vol. 45, no. 2, pp. 167–176, May 2003.]&lt;/ref&gt; This model extension, which is consistent with the classical [[orthogonal]] formulation, includes the Manhattan representation of the geometries in addition to the more general [[quadrilateral]] and [[hexahedral]] elements. This helps in keeping the number of unknowns at a minimum and thus reduces computational time for nonorthogonal geometries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sm.luth.se/~jekman/PEEC/Program/ Partial Element Equivalent Circuit (PEEC) homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differential equation solvers==

===Finite-difference time-domain ===
[[Finite-difference time-domain]] (FDTD) is a popular CEM technique. It is easy to understand. It has an exceptionally simple implementation for a full wave solver. It is at least an order of magnitude less work to implement a basic FDTD solver than either an FEM or MoM solver. FDTD is the only technique where one person can realistically implement oneself in a reasonable time frame, but even then, this will be for a quite specific problem.&lt;ref name="davidson"&gt;David B. Davidson, ''Computational Electromagnetics for RF and Microwave Engineering'', Second Edition, Cambridge University Press, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Since it is a time-domain method, solutions can cover a wide frequency range with a single simulation run, provided the time step is small enough to satisfy the [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem]] for the desired highest frequency.

FDTD belongs in the general class of grid-based differential time-domain numerical modeling methods. [[Maxwell's equations]] (in [[Partial differential equation|partial differential]] form) are modified to central-difference equations, discretized, and implemented in software. The equations are solved in a cyclic manner:  the [[electric field]] is solved at a given instant in time, then the [[magnetic field]] is solved at the next instant in time, and the process is repeated over and over again.

The basic FDTD algorithm traces back to a seminal 1966 paper by Kane Yee in [[IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation]]. [[Allen Taflove]] originated the descriptor "Finite-difference time-domain" and its corresponding "FDTD" acronym in a 1980 paper in IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility. Since about 1990, FDTD techniques have emerged as the primary means to model many scientific and engineering problems addressing electromagnetic wave interactions with material structures. An effective technique based on a time-domain finite-volume discretization procedure was introduced by Mohammadian et al. in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Alireza H. Mohammadian, Vijaya Shankar, and William F. Hall (1991). "Computation of Electromagnetic Scattering and Radiation Using a Time-Domain Finite-Volume Discretization Procedure. Computer Physics Communications Vol. 68, No. 1, 175-196.&lt;/ref&gt;  Current FDTD modeling applications range from near-DC (ultralow-frequency geophysics involving the entire Earth-[[ionosphere]] waveguide) through [[microwave]]s (radar signature technology, antennas, wireless communications devices, digital interconnects, biomedical imaging/treatment) to visible light ([[photonic crystal]]s, nanoplasmonics, [[soliton]]s, and [[biophotonics]]).  Approximately 30 commercial and university-developed software suites are available.

===Multiresolution time-domain===
MRTD is an adaptive alternative to the finite difference time domain method (FDTD) based on [[wavelet]] analysis.

===Finite element method ===
The [[finite element method]] (FEM) is used to find approximate solution of [[partial differential equation]]s (PDE) and [[integral equation]]s.  The solution approach is based either on eliminating the time derivatives completely (steady state problems), or rendering the PDE into an equivalent [[ordinary differential equation]], which is then solved using standard techniques such as [[finite difference]]s, etc.

In solving [[partial differential equation]]s, the primary challenge is to create an equation which approximates the equation to be studied, but which is [[numerically stable]], meaning that errors in the input data and intermediate calculations do not accumulate and destroy the meaning of the resulting output. There are many ways of doing this, with various advantages and disadvantages. The finite element method is a good choice for solving partial differential equations over complex domains or when the desired precision varies over the entire domain.

===Finite integration technique ===
The finite integration technique (FIT) is a spatial discretization scheme to numerically solve electromagnetic field problems in time and frequency domain. It preserves basic [[topological]] properties of the continuous equations such as conservation of charge and energy. FIT was proposed in 1977 by [[w:de:Thomas Weiland|Thomas Weiland]] and has been enhanced continually over the years.&lt;ref&gt;
T. Weiland, A Discretization Method for the Solution of Maxwell's Equations for Six-Component Fields, Electronics and Communications AEUE, vol. 31, no. 3, pp. 116–120, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; This method covers the full range of electromagnetics (from static up to high frequency) and optic applications and is the basis for commercial simulation tools.&lt;ref&gt;
CST Studio Suite developed by [[Computer Simulation Technology]] (CST AG).&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=April 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;
Electromagnetic Simulation solutions developed by [[Nimbic]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=April 2013}}

The basic idea of this approach is to apply the Maxwell equations in integral form to a set of staggered grids. This method stands out due to high flexibility in geometric modeling and boundary handling as well as incorporation of arbitrary material distributions and material properties such as [[anisotropy]], non-linearity and dispersion. Furthermore, the use of a consistent dual orthogonal grid (e.g. [[Cartesian grid]]) in conjunction with an explicit time integration scheme (e.g. leap-frog-scheme) leads to compute and memory-efficient algorithms, which are especially adapted for transient field analysis in [[radio frequency]] (RF) applications.

===Pseudo-spectral time domain ===
This class of marching-in-time computational techniques for Maxwell's equations uses either discrete Fourier or [[discrete Chebyshev transform]]s to calculate the spatial derivatives of the electric and magnetic field vector components that are arranged in either a 2-D grid or 3-D lattice of unit cells. PSTD causes negligible numerical phase velocity anisotropy errors relative to FDTD, and therefore allows problems of much greater electrical size to be modeled.&lt;ref&gt;
For a recent comprehensive summary of PSTD techniques for Maxwell's equations, see Q. Liu and G. Zhao "Advances in PSTD Techniques," Chapter 17 in Computational Electrodynamics: The Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method, A. Taflove and S. C. Hagness, eds., Boston: [[Artech House]], 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pseudo-spectral spatial domain ===
PSSD solves Maxwell's equations by propagating them forward in a chosen spatial direction. The fields are therefore held as a function of time, and (possibly) any transverse spatial dimensions. The method is pseudo-spectral because temporal derivatives are calculated in the frequency domain with the aid of FFTs. Because the fields are held as functions of time, this enables arbitrary dispersion in the propagation medium to be rapidly and accurately modelled with minimal effort.&lt;ref&gt;
J.C.A. Tyrrell et al., [[Journal of Modern Optics]] 52, 973 (2005); {{doi|10.1080/09500340512331334086}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the choice to propagate forward in space (rather than in time) brings with it some subtleties, particularly if reflections are important.&lt;ref&gt;P. Kinsler, [[Phys. Rev. A]]81, 013819 (2010); {{doi|10.1103/PhysRevA.81.013819}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transmission line matrix ===
[[Transmission line matrix method|Transmission line matrix]] (TLM) can be formulated in several means as a direct set of lumped elements solvable directly by a circuit solver (ala SPICE, [[HSPICE]], et al.), as a custom network of elements or via a [[scattering matrix]] approach.  TLM is a very flexible analysis strategy akin to FDTD in capabilities, though more codes tend to be available with FDTD engines.

===Locally one-dimensional  ===

This is an implicit method. In this method, in two-dimensional case, Maxwell equations  are computed in two steps, whereas in three-dimensional case Maxwell equations are divided into three spatial coordinate directions. Stability and dispersion analysis of the three-dimensional LOD-FDTD method have been discussed in detail.&lt;ref&gt;I.Ahmed, E.K.Chua, E.P.Li, Z.Chen., [[IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation]] 56, 3596-3600 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I.Ahmed, E.K.Chua, E.P.Li., [[IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation]] 58, 3983-3989 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other methods==

===EigenMode expansion ===
[[Eigenmode expansion]] (EME) is a rigorous bi-directional technique to simulate electromagnetic propagation which relies on the decomposition of the electromagnetic fields into a basis set of local eigenmodes. The eigenmodes are found by solving Maxwell's equations in each local cross-section. Eigenmode expansion can solve Maxwell's equations in 2D and 3D and can provide a fully vectorial solution provided that the mode solvers are vectorial. It offers very strong benefits compared with the FDTD method for the modelling of optical waveguides, and it is a popular tool for the modelling of [[fiber optics]] and [[silicon photonics]] devices.

===Physical optics ===
[[Physical optics]] (PO) is the name of a [[high frequency approximation]] (short-[[wavelength]] [[approximation]]) commonly used in optics, [[electrical engineering]] and [[applied physics]].  It is an intermediate method between geometric optics, which ignores [[wave]] effects, and full wave [[electromagnetism]], which is a precise [[theory]]. The word "physical" means that it is more physical than [[geometrical optics]] and not that it is an exact physical theory.

The approximation consists of using ray optics to estimate the field on a surface and then [[integral|integrating]] that field over the surface to calculate the transmitted or scattered field. This resembles the [[Born approximation]], in that the details of the problem are treated as a [[perturbation theory|perturbation]].

===Uniform theory of diffraction ===
The [[uniform theory of diffraction]] (UTD) is a [[high frequency]] method for solving [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] [[scattering]] problems from electrically small discontinuities or discontinuities in more than one dimension at the same point.

The [[uniform theory of diffraction]] approximates [[near and far field|near field]] electromagnetic fields as quasi optical and uses ray diffraction to determine diffraction coefficients for each diffracting object-source combination. These coefficients are then used to calculate the field strength and [[phase (waves)|phase]] for each direction away from the diffracting point. These fields are then added to the incident fields and reflected fields to obtain a total solution.

==Validation==
Validation is one of the key issues facing electromagnetic simulation users. The user must understand and master the validity domain of its simulation. The measure is, "how far from the reality are the results?"

Answering  this question involves three steps: comparison between simulation results and analytical formulation, cross-comparison between codes, and comparison of simulation results with measurement.

===Comparison between simulation results and analytical formulation===
For example, assessing the value of the [[radar cross section]] of a plate with the analytical formula:

:: &lt;math&gt;\text{RCS}_\text{Plate} = \frac{4 \pi A^2}{\lambda^2},&lt;/math&gt;

: where '''A''' is the surface of the plate and &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the wavelength. The next curve presenting the RCS of a plate computed at 35 [[GHz]] can be used as reference example.

===Cross-comparison between codes===
One example is the cross comparison of results from method of moments and asymptotic methods in their validity domains.&lt;ref&gt;
As an illustration, the company [http://www.oktal-se.fr/ OKTAL-SE] made common development and cross comparison with the French research institute [http://www.onera.fr/ ONERA], comparing Method of Moment and Asymptotic methods. The cross comparison helped the validation process of the SE-RAY-EM code of OKTAL-SE. [http://www.oktal-se.fr/website/external/rcs_plate_35ghz.jpg Illustration]{{dead link|date=February 2017}} of the comparison between the SE-RAY-EM code and the ONERA reference code (right image).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison of simulation results with measurement===
The final validation step is made by comparison between measurements and simulation. For example, the RCS calculation&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.oktal-se.fr/ SE-RAY-EM]&lt;/ref&gt; and the measurement&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.fgan.de/ FGAN-FHR]&lt;/ref&gt; of a complex metallic object at 35&amp;nbsp;GHz. The computation implements GO, PO and PTD for the edges.

Validation processes can clearly reveal that  some differences can be explained by the differences between the experimental setup and its reproduction in the simulation environment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071013230028/http://www.oktal-se.fr/website/news/pdf/RCS_35GHz_March2007.pdf full article]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Light scattering codes==
There are now many efficient codes for solving electromagnetic scattering problems. They are listed as [[discrete dipole approximation codes]], [[codes for electromagnetic scattering by cylinders]], [[codes for electromagnetic scattering by spheres]]. Solutions which are analytical, such as Mie solution for scattering by spheres or cylinders, can be used to validate more involved techniques.

[[Dazhou]], [[Sichuan]] gained notoriety for the corruption of [[Dazhu County]] (大竹)  [[official]]s that caused a [[Demonstration (protest)|mass protest]] in January 2007.  The incident involved a 16-year-old [[Waiting staff|waitress]] in the KTV rooms of Laishide (莱仕德) Hotel.

== Description ==

Laishide (莱仕德) Hotel was a four-star [[hotel]] built with [[investment]] from local officials and local police, and the sentiment against the hotel among the local populace existed long before the mass protest in January 2007 because of [[Crime|illegal and corrupt activities]] behind the closed doors of the hotel.

Miss Yang Daili (杨代莉), a 16-year-old young girl working at the hotel's [[karaoke]] rooms (KTV) was famed for her beauty and height, 1.70 meters.  On December 29, 2006, three high-ranking provincial officials went to the Laishide Hotel and asked Miss Yang Daili to have dinner with them, and took her out the same night.  The next morning, Miss Yang Daili was found dead in a suite at the hotel.  According to the police report, Miss Yang was drugged and raped, and she suffered brutal torture, including her tongue being cut, teeth broken due to beating, nipples cut off, and privates mutilated.

Miss Yang Daili's family started a protest outside the hotel on January 12, 2007. After they received no explanation from the hotel despite repeated requests, sympathizers and those who resented corruption gathered around the family to show their support. Their number first increased by the dozens daily, then by the hundreds, and eventually by the thousands. The attempt of Laishide Hotel to settle down before catching the real killer only increased public outrage even further, because previously, two waitresses and a security guard working at the hotel had been killed and no suspects had been found.  The official local governmental news website, however, failed to mention anything on these three previous [[murder]]s and it once again attempted do the same for the most recent murder.

By the afternoon of January 17, 2007, more than ten thousand protesters had gathered outside the hotel, and as the news of Laishide Hotel offering Miss Yang Daili's family half a million [[Renminbi]] to settle before the killers were found, and rejection of the offer by  family members reached the crowd, the people finally had had enough.  Angry protesters rushed into the hotel, damaged everything inside, and eventually set fire to the hotel. The fire was not put out until five hours later.

As the number of protesters and public outrage increased, the local government could no longer keep the murder a secret and was forced to release the police findings on January 18, 2007.  However, the official local government's news release only publicized the police report of the [[crime scene]], and attempted to blame the crime on a male hotel employee named Liu (劉).  The action was unanimously viewed by the local populace as an attempt to cover up the involvement of three high-ranking governmental officials of provincial level. Government officials were involved in all of the previous three murders that had been kept secret by the local government but were forced into the open due the most recent event. The enraged protesters continued to gather after the fire was put out and clashed with [[riot police]] who were sent in.

Painting by Frederick Tudgay (1841–1921), 47&amp;nbsp;cm by 77&amp;nbsp;cm oil on canvas, originally owned by the ship's captain, John Whitson.]]

The '''''Dunedin''''' {{audio|En-nz-Dunedin.ogg|listen}} (1876–82) was the first ship to successfully transport a full cargo of [[refrigeration|refrigerated]] meat from [[New Zealand]] to [[England]]. In this capacity, it provided the impetus to develop the capacity of New Zealand as a major provider of agricultural exports, notwithstanding its remoteness from most markets.

==Ship origins==
Robert Duncan and Co built the 1,320-ton, {{convert|73|m|adj=on}} ''Dunedin'' at [[Port Glasgow]] in Scotland in 1874 for the Albion Line (later the [[Shaw, Savill &amp; Albion Line]]). Her ship number was 67085.  She cost ₤23,750 (£1.6&amp;nbsp;million, in 2010 [http://measuringworth.com/calculators/ukcompare/result.php?use%5B%5D=CPI&amp;use%5B%5D=DEFIND&amp;use%5B%5D=WAGE&amp;use%5B%5D=GDPCP&amp;use%5B%5D=GDPC&amp;year_early=1874&amp;pound71=23750&amp;shilling71=&amp;pence71=&amp;amount=23750&amp;year_source=1874&amp;year_result=2010 inflation-adjusted] [[pound sterling|British pounds]]). She was one of six ''Auckland'' class [[emigration| emigrant]] vessels, each designed to carry 400 passengers. In 1881, still painted in her original colours of a black hull with a gold band and pink boot topping as shown, she was refitted{{by whom?|date=October 2014}} with a [[Bell Coleman cycle|Bell Coleman]] refrigeration machine, with which she took the first load of frozen meat from New Zealand to the United Kingdom.

==Immigrant ship==
Her first trip to New Zealand was in 1874 under Captain Whitson, who sailed her from London to [[Lyttelton, New Zealand]] in 98 days. In 1875, he sailed from London to Auckland in 94 days. All seven of her voyages from London to New Zealand prior to conversion were completed in under 100 days. Whitson remained her captain throughout the period she sailed with immigrants. In 1886, five years after she had been converted to take refrigerated cargo, Captain Arthur F Roberts became her captain after Captain Whitson had died at Oamaru on 4 May that year.&lt;ref&gt;Otago Witness, 7 May 1886, page 18&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts, a Master Mariner, had been captain of the ''White Eagle'' and ''Trevelyn''. Both these ships had sailed to New Zealand under his command. Even after her conversion, the ''Dunedin'' continued to carry passengers.&lt;ref&gt;Shipping, Otago Daily Times , Issue 7781, 27 January 1887, Page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background to the frozen meat shipment==
===English demand===
This historical importance of the ''Dunedin'' is due to this meat shipment, which proved refrigerated meat could be exported long distances, so establishing the [[New Zealand meat export industry]], and revolutionising agriculture in New Zealand and Australia. In the [[United Kingdom]] (UK), the rapidly expanding population had outrun the supply of local meat, leading to rapid increases in prices. The shipment of livestock from New Zealand to England was prohibitively expensive. New Zealand did export some canned meat, but the industry was in its infancy, and while the product was popular in the Pacific islands, it was less so in England.

===Early attempts===
[[File:William Davidson.JPG|thumb|150px|right|William Davidson]]
The first attempt to ship refrigerated meat from [[Australasia]] was made when the ''Northam'' sailed from [[Australia]] to England in 1876; however the [[refrigeration]] machinery broke down en route and so the cargo was lost. Later that year chilled beef was sent from the [[United States]] to England (a shorter journey, at cooler, higher [[latitude]]s) and, although spoilage was high, this voyage provided some encouragement to Australian and New Zealand promoters of refrigeration. In 1877 the steamers ''[[Le Frigorifique]]'' and ''Paraguay'' carried frozen [[mutton]] from [[Argentina]] to [[France]], proving the concept, if not the economic case, for longer-distance refrigerated shipping. In 1879 the ''Strathleven'', equipped with compression refrigeration, sailed from [[Sydney]] with {{convert|40|LT|t}} of frozen beef and mutton as a small part of her cargo, and this meat arrived in good condition. As a result of this success a Director of the New Zealand and Australian Land Company (NZALC), [[William Soltau Davidson]], sent an employee, [[Thomas Brydone]], from New Zealand to the UK to investigate compression refrigeration units.

===The ''Dunedin'' refit===
In 1880 Davidson convinced the company to invest in refrigeration. Teaming up with James Galbraith of the Albion shipping company, they approached John Bell and Sons and [[Joseph James Coleman]], who had been involved in American chilled beef shipments. As a result of negotiations, Albion agreed to refit the ''Dunedin'' with a Bell-Coleman [[Vapor-compression refrigeration|compression refrigeration]] machine, cooling the entire hold. Using 3 tons of coal a day, this steam-powered machine could chill the hold to 40 degrees Fahrenheit below surrounding air temperature, freezing the cargo in the temperate climate of southern New Zealand, and then maintaining it beneath zero through the tropics. The ''Dunedin'' was refitted in May 1881, the most visible sign being a funnel for the refrigeration plant between her fore and main masts – sometimes leading her to be mistaken for a steamship. The refitted ''Dunedin'' arrived in [[Dunedin]]'s [[Port Chalmers]] at the end of November 1881.

==1882 voyage==
[[File:SS Dunedin loading 1882.JPG|thumb|350px|left|The ''Dunedin'' loading at [[Port Chalmers]] in 1882.]]
From 5 December 1881, a herd of 10,000 [[Merino]]/Lincoln and Leicester crossbreed sheep on NZALC's [[Totara Estate]] near [[Oamaru]] was slaughtered at a purpose-built slaughter works close to the railhead there.  The carcasses were sent overnight by goods trains with a central block of ice to be loaded on the ''Dunedin'', where they were sewn into [[Calico (textile)|calico]] bags and frozen. To prove the process, the first frozen carcasses were taken off the ship, thawed and cut.

After 7 days of loading, the crankshaft of the compressor broke, damaging the machine's casing and causing the loss of the 643 sheep stowed. It took a month for a local machinist to rebuild the crankshaft and associated machinery. The frozen carcasses were resold locally during this time, and, encouragingly, they were considered to be indistinguishable from fresh meat. On 15 February 1882, the ''Dunedin'' sailed with 4331 mutton, 598 lamb and 22 pig carcasses, 250 kegs of butter, hare, pheasant, turkey, chicken and 2226 sheep tongues. Sparks from the compressor's boiler created a fire hazard, and Captain Whitson at one point developed [[hypothermia]] while working alone in the air duct.

The ''Dunedin'' arrived in London 98 days after setting sail. Carcasses were sold at the [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield market]] over two weeks by John Swan and Sons, who noted butchers' concerns about the quality of meat from the experimental transport; "Directly the meat was placed on the market, its superiority over the Australian [frozen] meat struck us, and in fact the entire trade". Although crossed with the primarily [[wool]] bearing [[Merino]], the well fed New Zealand sheep weighed an average of over {{convert|40|kg|lb}}, and some exceeded {{convert|90|kg|lb|-1}}. Only one carcass was condemned. {{ref| A lasting Legacy – A 125 year history of New Zealand Farming since the first Frozen Meat Shipment, Ed. Colin Williscroft PMP, NZ Rural Press Limited, Auckland, 2007}} [[The Times]] commented "Today we have to record such a triumph over physical difficulties, as would have been incredible, even unimaginable, a very few days ago...". After meeting all costs, NZALC's profit from the voyage was £4700.

==Outcome==
The shipment effectively launched the refrigerated meat industry and assured New Zealand's early dominance in it. The ''[[Marlborough (1876 ship)|Marlborough]]''—sister ship to the ''Dunedin'' – was immediately converted and joined the trade the following year, along with the rival [[New Zealand Shipping Company]] vessel ''Mataurua'', while the German steamer ''Marsala'' began carrying frozen New Zealand lamb in December 1882. Within five years, 172 shipments of frozen meat were sent from New Zealand to the United Kingdom, of which only 9 had significant amounts of meat condemned. The ''Dunedin'' completed nine more voyages until her loss in 1890.

==Disappearance==
[[File:Kitkat 601.jpg|thumb|320px|right|Model of the ''Dunedin'' in the [[Otago]] museum.]]
Her sister ship, the ''Marlborough'' had sailed in January 1890 and the ''Dunedin'' followed in March, sailing from [[Oamaru]] on 19 March with 34 crew including Captain Roberts.&lt;ref&gt;Shipping – Port of Oamaru, North Otago Times, Volume XXXIV, Issue 6994, 19 March 1890, Page 2&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts' daughter was the only passenger. By July concerns were being expressed about the ship, as she normally made the journey in 90 or so days and by October she was noted as missing.&lt;ref&gt;An overdue New Zealand trader, Dundee Courier, 14 July 1890, page 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Last Weeks Wrecks, Nottingham Evening Post, 24 October 1890, page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Although both the ''Dunedin'' and ''Marlborough'' were sighted in the [[Southern Ocean]] after leaving New Zealand, neither was 
seen again.&lt;ref&gt;The Dunedin, Exotic Intruders, [[Joan Druett]], Heinemann, 1983, Auckland&lt;/ref&gt; No trace was found of the ''Dunedin'' and it was presumed both she and the ''Marlborough'' hit icebergs in the Southern Ocean. RMS ''Rimutaka'' had reported that there were great quantities of ice in the Southern Ocean on their normal route between the [[Chatham Island]] and [[Cape Horn]] when she sailed through the area in early to mid February.&lt;ref&gt;Untitled, Auckland Star, Volume XXI, Issue 138, 12 June 1890, Page 4&lt;/ref&gt; The Board of Enquiry concluded that apart from hitting an iceberg another possibility was that the ''Dunedin'' had come to grief in a storm. They found that the ship was seaworthy, appropriately laden, and sailed by an experienced Captain and crew.&lt;ref&gt;The Missing Ship Dunedin. Oamaru Mail, Volume XVI, Issue 4865, 6 January 1891, Page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

There were two reports of sightings of the ''Dunedin'' in 1890; one by the ship ''London'' which said they had sailed near each other in the vicinity of Cape Horn prior to being separated in a storm, and another about her being found on the coast of [[Brazil]] with [[yellow fever]] on board. This latter story was dismissed as untrue.&lt;ref&gt;The missing ship Dunedin, Press, Volume XLVIII, Issue 7752, 5 January 1891, Page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:WAGrij electrode.jpg|thumb|right|Chronic subcortical electrode implant in a laboratory rat used to deliver electrical stimulation to the brain.]]

'''Electrical brain stimulation''' ('''EBS'''), also referred to as '''focal brain stimulation''' ('''FBS'''), is a form of [[electrotherapy]] and technique used in [[research]] and [[clinic]]al [[neurobiology]] to [[stimulation|stimulate]] a [[neuron]] or [[biological neural network|neural network]] in the [[brain]] through the direct or indirect [[Excitatory postsynaptic potential|excitation]] of its [[cell membrane]] by using an [[electric current]]. It is used for research or for [[therapy|therapeutical]] purposes.

== History ==

Electrical brain stimulation was first used in the first half of the 19th century by pioneering researchers such as [[Luigi Rolando]] {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}(1773–1831) and [[Pierre Flourens]] {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}(1794–1867), to study the [[brain localization of function]], following the discovery by [[Italians|Italian]] [[physician]] [[Luigi Galvani]] (1737–1798) that [[nerve]]s and [[muscle]]s were electrically excitable. The stimulation of the surface of the [[cerebral cortex]] by using brain stimulation was used to investigate the [[motor cortex]] in animals by researchers such  as [[Eduard Hitzig]] (1838–1907), [[Gustav Fritsch]] (1838–1927), [[David Ferrier]] (1842–1928) and [[Friedrich Goltz]] (1834–1902). The human cortex was also stimulated electrically by [[neurosurgeon]]s and [[neurologist]]s such as [[Robert Bartholow]] (1831–1904) and [[Fedor Krause]] (1857–1937).

In the following century, the technique was improved by the invention of the [[stereotactic method]] by British neurosurgeon pioneer [[Victor Horsley]] (1857–1916), and by the development of [[chronic electrode implants]] by [[Swiss]] [[neurophysiologist]] [[Walter Rudolf Hess]] (1881–1973), [[José Manuel Rodriguez Delgado|José Delgado]] (1915-2011) and others, by using [[electrode]]s manufactured by straight insulated [[wire]] that could be inserted deep into the brain of freely-behaving animals, such as [[cat]]s and [[monkey]]s. This approach was used by Dr.[[James Olds]] (1922–1976) and colleagues to discover [[brain stimulation reward]] and the [[pleasure center]]. American-Canadian neurosurgeon [[Wilder Penfield]] (1891–1976) and colleagues at the [[Montreal Neurological Institute]] used extensively electrical stimulation of the brain cortex in awake neurosurgical patients to investigate the motor and sensory [[Cortical homunculus|homunculus]] (the representation of the body in the brain cortex according to the distribution of motor and sensory territories).

EBS remains inextricably entwined with the work of Dr. [[Robert Galbraith Heath]], Dr. [[José Manuel Rodriguez Delgado|Jose Delgado]] and Dr. [[Wilder Penfield]]. It's of interest that during cerebral localization studies, neurosurgeon Penfield could not elicit emotional reactions in humans, either by observing spontaneous epilepsy or by electrically stimulating the surface of the cerebral cortex. Neurophysiologist Dr. Jose Delgado noted a few exceptions to this rule. In contrast, EBS, via deeply implanted electrodes in localized areas of the brain ([[deep brain stimulation]]; DBS), elicited both pleasurable and aversive responses in laboratory animals and man as previously described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Penfield|first=Wilder|title=Speech and Brain Mechanisms|date=1974|publisher=Atheneum|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Delgado|first=Jose|title=Physical Control of the Mind: Toward a Psychocivilized Society|date=1986|publisher=Harper and Row|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Faria"&gt;{{cite web|last=Faria|first=Miguel A|title=Violence, mental illness, and the brain - A brief history of psychosurgery: Part 2 - From the limbic system and cingulotomy to deep brain stimulation|url=http://surgicalneurologyint.com/surgicalint_articles/violence-mental-illness-and-the-brain-a-brief-history-of-psychosurgery-part-2-from-the-limbic-system-and-cingulotomy-to-deep-brain-stimulation/ |publisher=Surg Neurol Int 01-Jun-2013;4:75|accessdate=April 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EBS could elicit the ritualistic, motor responses of sham rage in cats by stimulation of the anterior [[hypothalamus]], as well as more complex emotional and behavioral components of "true rage" in both experimental animals by stimulation of the lateral hypothalamus, and in human subjects by stimulating various deep areas of the brain. EBS in human patients with [[epilepsy]] could trigger seizures in the surface of the brain and pathologic aggression and rage with stimulation of the amygdala.&lt;ref name="Faria"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mark|first=Vernon|title=Violence and the Brain|date=1970|publisher=Harper and Row|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==

[[Two-photon excitation microscopy]] has shown that [[microstimulation]] activates neurons sparsely around the electrode even at low currents (as low as 10 μA) up to distances as far as four millimeters away. This happens without particularly selecting other neurons much nearer the electrode's tip. This is due to activation of neurons being determined by whether they do or do not have [[axon]]s or [[dendrite]]s that pass within a radius of 15&amp;nbsp;μm near the tip of the electrode.  As the current is increased the volume around the tip that activates neuron axons and dendrites increases and with this the number of neurons activated. Activation is most likely to be due to direct [[depolarization]] rather than [[Chemical synapse|synaptic activation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2009.07.016 | last1 = Histed | first1 = MH | last2 = Bonin | first2 = V | last3 = Reid | first3 = RC. | year = 2009 | title = Direct activation of sparse, distributed populations of cortical neurons by electrical microstimulation | url = | journal = Neuron | volume = 63 | issue = 4| pages = 508–22 | pmid = 19709632 | pmc = 2874753 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

EBS in face-sensitive regions of the [[fusiform gyrus]] caused a patient to report that the faces of the people in the room with him had "metamorphosed" and became distorted: "Your nose got saggy, went to the left. [...] Only your face changed, everything else was the same."&lt;ref name=ParviziEtAl2012&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Josef Parvizi|author2=Corentin Jacques|author3=Brett L.

== Therapeutic applications ==

[[Image:Parkinson surgery.jpg|thumb|right|Stereotactic apparatus used to insert an electrode into the [[basal ganglia]] of the brain, for Parkinson's disease surgery.]]

Examples of therapeutic EBS are:

* [[Cranial electrotherapy stimulation]] (CES)
* [[Deep brain stimulation]] (DBS)
* [[Transcranial direct current stimulation]] (tDCS)
* [[Electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT)
* [[Low Field Magnetic Stimulation]] (LFMS)
* [[Functional electrical stimulation]] (FES)
* [[Magnetic seizure therapy]] (MST)
* [[Vagus nerve stimulation]] (VNS)
* [[Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (Deep TMS)

Strong electric currents may cause a localized lesion in the nervous tissue, instead of a functional reversible stimulation. This property has been used for neurosurgical procedures in a variety of treatments, such as for [[Treatments of Parkinson's Disease|Parkinson's disease]], focal [[epilepsy]] and [[psychosurgery]]. Sometimes the same electrode is used to probe the brain for finding defective functions, before passing the lesioning current ([[electrocoagulation]]).

[[File:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|thumb|The study of planetary habitability is partly based upon extrapolation from knowledge of the [[Earth]]'s conditions, as the Earth is the only planet currently known to harbour life.]]

The '''Gaia hypothesis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|aɪ|.|ə}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|eɪ|.|ə}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|aɪ|ˈ|ʌ}}), also known as the '''Gaia theory''' or the '''Gaia principle''', proposes that living [[organism]]s interact with their [[inorganic]] surroundings on [[Earth]] to form a [[synergistic]] and [[Homeostasis|self-regulating]], [[complex system]] that helps to maintain and perpetuate the conditions for [[life]] on the planet.

The hypothesis was formulated by the chemist [[James Lovelock]]&lt;ref name="J1972" /&gt; and co-developed by the microbiologist [[Lynn Margulis]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="lovelock1974"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lovelock|first1=J.E.|last2=Margulis|first2=L.|title=Atmospheric homeostasis by and for the biosphere: the Gaia hypothesis|journal=Tellus|date=1974|volume=26|series=Series A|issue=1–2|pages=2–10|doi=10.1111/j.2153-3490.1974.tb01946.x|url=http://tellusa.net/index.php/tellusa/article/view/9731|accessdate=20 October 2012|publisher=International Meteorological Institute|location=Stockholm|issn=1600-0870|ref=harv|bibcode=1974Tell...26....2L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lovelock named the idea after [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], the primordial goddess who personified the Earth in [[Greek mythology]]. In 2006, the [[Geological Society of London]] awarded Lovelock the [[Wollaston Medal]] in part for his work on the Gaia hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wollaston Award Lovelock|url=https://www.geolsoc.org.uk/About/History/Awards-Citations-Replies-2001-Onwards/2006-Awards-Citations-Replies|accessdate=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Topics related to the hypothesis include how the [[biosphere]] and the [[evolution]] of organisms affect the stability of [[global temperature]], [[salinity]] of [[seawater]], [[atmospheric oxygen]] levels, the maintenance of a [[hydrosphere]] of liquid water and other environmental variables that affect the [[habitability of Earth]].

The Gaia hypothesis was initially criticized for being [[teleological]] and against the principles of [[natural selection]], but later refinements aligned the Gaia hypothesis with ideas from fields such as [[Earth system science]], [[biogeochemistry]] and [[systems ecology]].&lt;ref name="Turney, Jon 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schwartzman2002"&gt;{{cite book |author=Schwartzman, David |title=Life, Temperature, and the Earth: The Self-Organizing Biosphere |publisher=Columbia University Press |date=2002 |isbn=0-231-10213-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gribbin, John (1990), "Hothouse earth: The greenhouse effect and Gaia" (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson)&lt;/ref&gt; Lovelock also once described the "geophysiology" of the Earth.&lt;ref name="agesofgaia"&gt;Lovelock, James, (1995) "The Ages of Gaia: A Biography of Our Living Earth" (W.W.Norton &amp; Co)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Explain|date=December 2017}} Even so, the Gaia hypothesis continues to attract criticism, and today some scientists consider it to be only weakly supported by, or at odds with, the available evidence.&lt;ref name="kirchner2002"&gt;{{Citation |last= Kirchner |first = James W. |title =Toward a future for Gaia theory |journal=[[Climatic Change (journal)|Climatic Change]] |volume = 52 |pages = 391–408 |date = 2002 | doi = 10.1023/a:1014237331082 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="volk2002"&gt;{{Citation |last= Volk |first = Tyler |title =The Gaia hypothesis: fact, theory, and wishful thinking |journal = Climatic Change |volume = 52 |pages = 423–430 |date = 2002 | doi = 10.1023/a:1014218227825 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="beerling2007"&gt;{{cite book |last=Beerling |first=David |authorlink=David Beerling|date=2007 |title=The Emerald Planet: How plants changed Earth's history |url=http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780192806024.do |location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press |page= |isbn= 978-0-19-280602-4 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Gaian hypotheses suggest that organisms [[Co-evolution|co-evolve]] with their environment: that is, they "influence their [[abiotic]] environment, and that environment in turn influences the [[Biota (ecology)|biota]] by [[Darwinism|Darwinian process]]". Lovelock (1995) gave evidence of this in his second book, showing the evolution from the world of the early [[Bacteria|thermo-acido-philic]] and [[methanogenic bacteria]] towards the oxygen-enriched [[atmosphere]] today that supports more [[Phanerozoic|complex life]].

A reduced version of the hypothesis has been called "influential Gaia"&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lapenis|first=Andrei G.|year=2002|title=Directed Evolution of the Biosphere: Biogeochemical Selection or Gaia?|url=|journal=The Professional Geographer|volume=54 |issue=3|pages=379–391|via=[Peer Reviewed Journal]}}&lt;/ref&gt; in "Directed Evolution of the Biosphere: Biogeochemical Selection or Gaia?" by Andrei G. Lapenis, which states the [[Biota (ecology)|biota]] influence certain aspects of the abiotic world, e.g. [[temperature]] and atmosphere.  This is not the work of an individual but a collective of Russian scientific research that was combined into this peer reviewed publication. It states the coevolution of life and the environment through “micro-forces”&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; and biogeochemical processes. An example is how the activity of [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] bacteria during Precambrian times have completely modified the [[Earth's atmosphere|Earth atmosphere]] to turn it aerobic, and as such supporting evolution of life (in particular [[eukaryotic]] life).

Since barriers existed throughout the Twentieth Century between Russia and the rest of the world, it is only relatively recently that the early Russian scientists who introduced concepts overlapping the Gaia hypothesis have become better known to the Western scientific community.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; These scientists include:
# [[Piotr Kropotkin|Piotr Alekseevich Kropotkin]] (1842–1921)
# Rafail Vasil’evich Rizpolozhensky (1847–1918)
# [[Vladimir Ivanovich Vernadsky]] (1863–1945)
# Vladimir Alexandrovich Kostitzin (1886–1963)

Biologists and Earth scientists usually view the factors that stabilize the characteristics of a period as an undirected [[emergent property]] or [[entelechy]] of the system; as each individual species pursues its own self-interest, for example, their combined actions may have counterbalancing effects on environmental change. Opponents of this view sometimes reference examples of events that resulted in dramatic change rather than stable equilibrium, such as the conversion of the Earth's atmosphere from a [[reducing environment]] to an [[oxygen]]-rich one at the end of the [[Archean|Archaean]] and the beginning of the [[Proterozoic]] periods.

Less accepted versions of the hypothesis claim that changes in the biosphere are brought about through the [[Superorganism|coordination of living organisms]] and maintain those conditions through [[homeostasis]]. In some versions of [[Gaia philosophy]], all lifeforms are considered part of one single living planetary being called ''Gaia''. In this view, the atmosphere, the seas and the terrestrial crust would be results of interventions carried out by Gaia through the [[Coevolution|coevolving]] diversity of living organisms.

The Gaia hypothesis was an influence on the [[deep ecology]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;David Landis Barnhill, Roger S. Gottlieb (eds.), ''Deep Ecology and World Religions: New Essays on Sacred Ground'', SUNY Press, 2010, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==
The Gaia hypothesis posits that the Earth is a self-regulating [[complex system]] involving the [[biosphere]], the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], the [[hydrosphere]]s and the [[pedosphere]], tightly coupled as an evolving system. The hypothesis contends that this system as a whole, called Gaia, seeks a physical and chemical environment optimal for contemporary life.&lt;ref name="vanishing255"&gt;Lovelock, James. ''The Vanishing Face of Gaia''. Basic Books, 2009, p. 255. {{ISBN|978-0-465-01549-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaia evolves through a [[Cybernetic#In biology|cybernetic]] [[feedback]] system operated unconsciously by the [[biota (ecology)|biota]], leading to broad stabilization of the conditions of habitability in a full homeostasis. Many processes in the Earth's surface essential for the conditions of life depend on the interaction of living forms, especially [[microorganisms]], with inorganic elements. These processes establish a global control system that regulates Earth's [[Sea surface temperature|surface temperature]], [[atmosphere composition]] and [[ocean]] [[salinity]], powered by the global thermodynamic disequilibrium state of the Earth system.&lt;ref&gt;Kleidon, Axel. ''How does the earth system generate and maintain thermodynamic disequilibrium and what does it imply for the future of the planet?''. Article submitted to the ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society'' on Thu, 10 Mar 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Article submitted to Royal Society is not a valid reference. This must be replaced by actual article citation if accepted, or an alternative reference --&gt;

The existence of a planetary homeostasis influenced by living forms had been observed previously in the field of [[biogeochemistry]], and it is being investigated also in other fields like [[Earth system science]]. The originality of the Gaia hypothesis relies on the assessment that such homeostatic balance is actively pursued with the goal of keeping the optimal conditions for life, even when terrestrial or external events menace them.&lt;ref&gt;Lovelock, James.

===Regulation of global surface temperature===
[[File:All palaeotemps.png|thumb|Rob Rohde's palaeotemperature graphs]]
{{See also|Paleoclimatology}}
Since life started on Earth, the energy provided by the [[Sun]] has increased by 25% to 30%;&lt;ref name="Owen1979"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Owen, T. | author2 = Cess, R.D. | author3 = Ramanathan, V. | date = 1979 | title = Earth: An enhanced carbon dioxide greenhouse to compensate for reduced solar luminosity | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 277 | pages = 640–2 | doi = 10.1038/277640a0 | issue=5698 | bibcode = 1979Natur.277..640O | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the surface temperature of the planet has remained within the levels of habitability, reaching quite regular low and high margins.  Lovelock has also hypothesised that methanogens produced elevated levels of methane in the early atmosphere, giving a view similar to that found in petrochemical smog, similar in some respects to the atmosphere on [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].&lt;ref name="agesofgaia"/&gt; This, he suggests tended to screen out ultraviolet until the formation of the ozone screen, maintaining a degree of homeostasis.  However, the [[Snowball Earth]]&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, P.F. 2001. [http://www.snowballearth.org ''Snowball Earth theory'']&lt;/ref&gt; research has suggested that "oxygen shocks" and reduced methane levels led, during the [[Huronian]], [[Sturtian]] and [[Marinoan]]/[[Cryogenian|Varanger]] Ice Ages, to a world that very nearly became a solid "snowball". These epochs are evidence against the ability of the pre [[Phanerozoic]] biosphere to fully self-regulate.

Processing of the greenhouse gas CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, explained below, plays a critical role in the maintenance of the Earth temperature within the limits of habitability.

The [[CLAW hypothesis]], inspired by the Gaia hypothesis, proposes a [[feedback|feedback loop]] that operates between [[ocean]] [[ecosystem]]s and the [[Earth]]'s [[climate]].&lt;ref name="CLAW87"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/326655a0 |author=[[Robert Jay Charlson|Charlson, R.

Currently the increase in human population and the environmental impact of their activities, such as the multiplication of [[greenhouse gases]] may cause [[negative feedback]]s in the environment to become [[positive feedback]]. Lovelock has stated that this could bring an [[James Lovelock#The revenge of Gaia|extremely accelerated global warming]],&lt;ref&gt;Lovelock, James. ''The Vanishing Face of Gaia''.

====Daisyworld simulations====
[[File:StandardDaisyWorldRun2color.gif|thumb|Plots from a standard black &amp; white [[Daisyworld]] simulation]]
{{Main|Daisyworld}}
James Lovelock and [[Andrew Watson (scientist)|Andrew Watson]] developed the mathematical model [[Daisyworld]], in which temperature regulation arises from a simple ecosystem consisting of two species whose activity varies in response to the planet's environment. The model demonstrates that beneficial feedback mechanisms can emerge in this "toy world" containing only self-interested organisms rather than through classic [[group selection]] mechanisms.&lt;ref name="daisyworld"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daisyworld examines the [[Earth's energy budget|energy budget]] of a planet populated by two different types of plants, black daisies and white daisies. The colour of the daisies influences the [[albedo]] of the planet such that black daisies absorb light and warm the planet, while white daisies reflect light and cool the planet. As the model runs the output of the "sun" increases, meaning that the surface temperature of an uninhabited "gray" planet will steadily rise. In contrast, on Daisyworld competition between the daisies (based on temperature-effects on growth rates) leads to a shifting balance of daisy populations that tends to favour a planetary temperature close to the optimum for daisy growth.

It has been suggested that the results were predictable because Lovelock and Watson selected examples that produced the responses they desired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1023/A:1023494111532 | date = 2003 | last1 = Kirchner | first1 = James W. | journal = Climatic Change | volume = 58 |issue=1–2| pages = 21–45 |title=The Gaia Hypothesis: Conjectures and Refutations | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulation of oceanic salinity===
Ocean [[salinity]] has been constant at about 3.5% for a very long time.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Introduction to Ocean Sciences|last=Segar|first=Douglas|publisher=Library of Congress|year=2012|isbn=978-0-9857859-0-1|location=http://www.reefimages.com/oceans/SegarOcean3Chap05.pdf|pages=Chapter 5 3rd Edition|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salinity stability in oceanic environments is important as most cells require a rather constant salinity and do not generally tolerate values above 5%. The constant ocean salinity was a long-standing mystery, because no process counterbalancing the salt influx from rivers was known. Recently it was suggested&lt;ref name="Gorham19912"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gorham|first=Eville|date=1 January 1991|title=Biogeochemistry: its origins and development|url=https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00002942|journal=Biogeochemistry|publisher=Kluwer Academic|volume=13|issue=3|pages=199–239|doi=10.1007/BF00002942|issn=1573-515X|ref=harv|accessdate=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that salinity may also be strongly influenced by [[seawater]] circulation through hot [[basalt]]ic rocks, and emerging as hot water vents on [[mid-ocean ridge]]s. However, the composition of seawater is far from equilibrium, and it is difficult to explain this fact without the influence of organic processes. One suggested explanation lies in the formation of salt plains throughout Earth's history. It is hypothesized that these are created by bacterial colonies that fix ions and heavy metals during their life processes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the biogeochemical processes of the earth, sources and sinks are the movement of elements. The composition of salt ions within our oceans and seas are: sodium (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), chlorine (Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), sulfate (SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;), Magnesium (Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) and potassium (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;).  The elements that comprise salinity do not readily change and are a conservative property of seawater.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  There are many mechanisms that change salinity from a particulate form to a dissolved form and back. The known sources of sodium i.e. salts is when weathering, erosion, and dissolution of rocks transport into rivers and deposit into the oceans.

The Gaia hypothesis states that the Earth's [[Atmospheric chemistry#Atmospheric composition|atmospheric composition]] is kept at a dynamically steady state by the presence of life.&lt;ref&gt;Lovelock, James. ''The Vanishing Face of Gaia''. Basic Books, 2009, p. 163. {{ISBN|978-0-465-01549-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The atmospheric composition provides the conditions that contemporary life has adapted to. All the atmospheric gases other than [[noble gas]]es present in the atmosphere are either made by organisms or processed by them.

The stability of the atmosphere in Earth is not a consequence of [[chemical equilibrium]]. [[Oxygen]] is a reactive compound, and should eventually combine with gases and minerals of the Earth's atmosphere and crust.  Oxygen only began to persist in the atmosphere in small quantities about 50 million years before the start of the [[Great Oxygenation Event]].&lt;ref name=Anabar2007&gt;{{Cite journal| last4 = Arnold| last6 = Creaser| last3 = Lyons| first1 = A. | first2 = Y.| last9 = Scott| last2 = Duan | first3 = T. | first4 = G.| last8 = Gordon | first5 = B. | first10 = J. | first6 = R.| last10 = Garvin | first7 = A.| last11 = Buick | first8 = G. | first11 = R. | first9 = C.| title = A whiff of oxygen before the great oxidation event?| journal = Science| volume = 317| issue = 5846| year = 2007| last7 = Kaufman| pages = 1903–1906| last5 = Kendall| pmid = 17901330| last1 = Anbar | doi = 10.1126/science.1140325|bibcode = 2007Sci...317.1903A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the start of the [[Cambrian]] period, atmospheric oxygen concentrations have fluctuated between 15% and 35% of atmospheric volume.&lt;ref name=Berner1999&gt;{{Cite journal

Recent work on the findings of fire-caused charcoal in Carboniferous and Cretaceous coal measures, in geologic periods when O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; did exceed 25%, has supported Lovelock's contention. {{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===Processing of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;===
{{See also|Carbon cycle}}
Gaia scientists see the participation of living organisms in the [[carbon cycle]] as one of the complex processes that maintain conditions suitable for life. The only significant natural source of [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric carbon dioxide]] ([[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]) is [[volcanic activity]], while the only significant removal is through the precipitation of [[carbonate rocks]].&lt;ref name="Karhu1996"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Karhu, J.A. | author2 = Holland, H.D. | date = 1 October 1996 | title = Carbon isotopes and the rise of atmospheric oxygen | journal = [[Geology (journal)|Geology]] | volume = 24 | issue = 10 | pages = 867–870 | url = http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/24/10/867 | doi = 10.1130/0091-7613(1996)024&lt;0867:CIATRO&gt;2.3.CO;2|bibcode = 1996Geo....24..867K | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon precipitation, solution and [[Carbon fixation|fixation]] are influenced by the [[bacteria]] and plant roots in soils, where they improve gaseous circulation, or in coral reefs, where calcium carbonate is deposited as a solid on the sea floor. Calcium carbonate is used by living organisms to manufacture carbonaceous tests and shells. Once dead, the living organisms' shells fall to the bottom of the oceans where they generate deposits of chalk and limestone.

One of these organisms is ''[[Emiliania huxleyi]]'', an abundant [[coccolithophore]] [[algae]] which also has a role in the formation of [[cloud]]s.&lt;ref name="Harding2006"&gt;{{cite book |author=Harding, Stephan |title=Animate Earth |publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing |date=2006 |pages=65 |isbn=1-933392-29-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; excess is compensated by an increase of coccolithophoride life, increasing the amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; locked in the ocean floor. Coccolithophorides increase the cloud cover, hence control the surface temperature, help cool the whole planet and favor precipitations necessary for terrestrial plants.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Lately the atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration has increased and there is some evidence that concentrations of ocean [[algal bloom]]s are also increasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | date = 12 September 2007 | title = Interagency Report Says Harmful Algal Blooms Increasing | url = http://www.publicaffairs.noaa.gov/releases2007/sep07/noaa07-r435.html | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080209234239/http://www.publicaffairs.noaa.gov/releases2007/sep07/noaa07-r435.html | archivedate = 9 February 2008 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lichen]] and other organisms accelerate the [[weathering]] of rocks in the surface, while the decomposition of rocks also happens faster in the soil, thanks to the activity of roots, fungi, bacteria and subterranean animals. The flow of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to the soil is therefore regulated with the help of living beings. When CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels rise in the atmosphere the temperature increases and plants grow. This growth brings higher consumption of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by the plants, who process it into the soil, removing it from the atmosphere.

==History==

===Precedents===
[[File:NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg|thumb|''[[Earthrise]]'' taken from [[Apollo 8]] on December 24, 1968]]
The idea of the Earth as an integrated whole, a living being, has a long tradition. The [[Gaia (mythology)|mythical Gaia]] was the primal Greek goddess personifying the [[Earth]], the Greek version of "[[Mother Nature]]" (from Ge = Earth, and Aia = 
[[PIE]] grandmother), or the [[Earth Mother]]. James Lovelock gave this name to his hypothesis after a suggestion from the novelist [[William Golding]], who was living in the same village as Lovelock at the time ([[Bowerchalke]], [[Wiltshire]], UK). Golding's advice was based on Gea, an alternative spelling for the name of the Greek goddess, which is used as prefix in geology, geophysics and geochemistry.&lt;ref name=vanish09 /&gt; Golding later made reference to Gaia in his [[Nobel prize]] acceptance speech.

In the eighteenth century, as [[geology]] consolidated as a modern science, [[James Hutton]] maintained that geological and biological processes are interlinked.&lt;ref name=CapraWeb&gt;{{cite book |author=Capra, Fritjof |title=The web of life: a new scientific understanding of living systems |publisher=Anchor Books |location=Garden City, N.Y |date=1996 |page=23|isbn=0-385-47675-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the [[naturalist]] and explorer [[Alexander von Humboldt]] recognized the coevolution of living organisms, climate, and Earth's crust.&lt;ref name=CapraWeb /&gt; In the twentieth century, [[Vladimir Vernadsky]] formulated a theory of Earth's development that is now one of the foundations of ecology. Vernadsky was a Ukrainian [[geochemist]] and was one of the first scientists to recognize that the oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere result from biological processes. During the 1920s he published works arguing that living organisms could reshape the planet as surely as any physical force. Vernadsky was a pioneer of the scientific bases for the environmental sciences.&lt;ref&gt;S.R. Weart, 2003, ''The Discovery of Global Warming'', Cambridge, Harvard Press&lt;/ref&gt; His visionary pronouncements were not widely accepted in the West, and some decades later the Gaia hypothesis received the same type of initial resistance from the scientific community.

Also in the turn to the 20th century [[Aldo Leopold]], pioneer in the development of modern [[environmental ethics]] and in the movement for [[wilderness]] conservation, suggested a living Earth in his biocentric or holistic ethics regarding land.

Another influence for the Gaia hypothesis and the [[environmental movement]] in general came as a side effect of the [[Space Race]] between the Soviet Union and the United States of America. During the 1960s, the first humans in space could see how the Earth looked as a whole. The photograph ''[[Earthrise]]'' taken by astronaut [[William Anders]] in 1968 during the [[Apollo 8]] mission became, through the [[Overview Effect]] an early symbol for the global ecology movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitaljournalist.org/issue0309/lm11.html 100 Photographs that Changed the World by Life - The Digital Journalist]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formulation of the hypothesis===
[[File:James Lovelock in 2005.jpg|thumb|[[James Lovelock]], 2005]]
Lovelock started defining the idea of a self-regulating Earth controlled by the community of living organisms in September 1965, while working at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] in California on methods of detecting [[life on Mars (planet)|life on Mars]].&lt;ref name="Lovelock1965"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lovelock, J.E. | date = 1965 | title = A physical basis for life detection experiments | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 207 | issue = 7 | pages = 568–570 | doi = 10.1038/207568a0 | pmid=5883628|bibcode = 1965Natur.207..568L | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jameslovelock.org/page4.html Geophysiology]&lt;/ref&gt;  The first paper to mention it was ''Planetary Atmospheres: Compositional and other Changes Associated with the Presence of Life'', co-authored with C.E. Giffin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Lovelock, J.E. | author2 = Giffin, C.E. | date = 1969 | title = Planetary Atmospheres: Compositional and other changes associated with the presence of Life | journal = Advances in the Astronautical Sciences | volume = 25 | pages = 179–193 | isbn = 0-87703-028-6 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; A main concept was that life could be detected in a planetary scale by the chemical composition of the atmosphere. According to the data gathered by the [[Pic du Midi de Bigorre|Pic du Midi observatory]], planets like Mars or Venus had atmospheres in [[chemical equilibrium]]. This difference with the Earth atmosphere was considered to be a proof that there was no life in these planets.

Lovelock formulated the ''Gaia Hypothesis'' in journal articles in 1972&lt;ref name="J1972"&gt;{{cite journal | author = J. E. Lovelock | title = Gaia as seen through the atmosphere | date = 1972 | journal = [[Atmospheric Environment]] | volume = 6 | issue = 8 | pages = 579–580 | doi = 10.1016/0004-6981(72)90076-5 | ref = harv|bibcode = 1972AtmEn...6..579L }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1974,&lt;ref name="lovelock1974" /&gt; followed by a popularizing 1979 book ''Gaia: A new look at life on Earth''. An article in the ''[[New Scientist]]'' of February 6, 1975,&lt;ref&gt;Lovelock, John and Sidney Epton, (February 8, 1975). "The quest for Gaia". [https://books.google.com/books?id=pnV6UYEkU4YC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false New Scientist], p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt; and a popular book length version of the hypothesis, published in 1979 as ''The Quest for Gaia'', began to attract scientific and critical attention.

Lovelock called it first the Earth feedback hypothesis,&lt;ref name="Lovelock01"&gt;{{harvnb|Lovelock, James|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was a way to explain the fact that combinations of chemicals including [[oxygen]] and [[methane]] persist in stable concentrations in the atmosphere of the Earth. Lovelock suggested detecting such combinations in other planets' atmospheres as a relatively reliable and cheap way to detect life.

[[File:Lynn Margulis.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lynn Margulis]]]]

Later, other relationships such as sea creatures producing sulfur and iodine in approximately the same quantities as required by land creatures emerged and helped bolster the hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=W.D. | last1=Hamilton | first2=T.M. | last2=Lenton | title=Spora and Gaia: how microbes fly with their clouds | journal=Ethology Ecology &amp; Evolution | volume=10 | pages=1–16 | date=1998 | issue=1 | url=http://ejour-fup.unifi.it/index.php/eee/article/viewFile/787/733 | format=PDF | doi=10.1080/08927014.1998.9522867 | ref=harv | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723055017/http://ejour-fup.unifi.it/index.php/eee/article/viewFile/787/733 | archivedate=2011-07-23 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971 [[microbiologist]] Dr. [[Lynn Margulis]] joined Lovelock in the effort of fleshing out the initial hypothesis into scientifically proven concepts, contributing her knowledge about how microbes affect the atmosphere and the different layers in the surface of the planet.&lt;ref name="Turney, Jon 2003"&gt;{{cite book |author=Turney, Jon |title=Lovelock and Gaia: Signs of Life |publisher=Icon Books |location=UK |date=2003 |isbn=1-84046-458-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The American biologist had also awakened criticism from the scientific community with her theory on the origin of [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[organelle]]s and her contributions to the [[endosymbiotic theory]], nowadays accepted. Margulis dedicated the last of eight chapters in her book, ''The Symbiotic Planet'', to Gaia. However, she objected to the widespread personification of Gaia and stressed that Gaia is "not an organism", but "an emergent property of interaction among organisms". She defined Gaia as "the series of interacting ecosystems that compose a single huge ecosystem at the Earth's surface. Period". The book's most memorable "slogan" was actually quipped by a student of Margulis': "Gaia is just symbiosis as seen from space".

James Lovelock called his first proposal the ''Gaia hypothesis'' but has also used the term ''Gaia theory''. Lovelock states that the initial formulation was based on observation, but still lacked a scientific explanation. The Gaia hypothesis has since been supported by a number of scientific experiments&lt;ref name="J1990"&gt;{{cite journal | author = J. E. Lovelock | title = Hands up for the Gaia hypothesis | date = 1990 | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 344 | issue = 6262 | pages = 100–2 | doi = 10.1038/344100a0|bibcode = 1990Natur.344..100L | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and provided a number of useful predictions.&lt;ref name="Volk2003"&gt;{{cite book |author=Volk, Tyler |title=Gaia's Body: Toward a Physiology of Earth |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |date=2003 |isbn=0-262-72042-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, wider research proved the original hypothesis wrong, in the sense that it is not life alone but the whole Earth system that does the regulating.&lt;ref name="vanishing255"/&gt;

===First Gaia conference===
In 1985, the first public symposium on the Gaia hypothesis, ''Is The Earth A Living Organism?'' was held at [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], August 1–6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Joseph |first=Lawrence E. |title=Britain's Whole Earth Guru |work=The New York Times Magazine |date=November 23, 1986 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/23/magazine/britain-s-whole-earth-guru.html |accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal sponsor was the [[National Audubon Society]]. Speakers included James Lovelock, [[George Wald]], [[Mary Catherine Bateson]], [[Lewis Thomas]], [[John Todd (Canadian biologist)|John Todd]], Donald Michael, [[Christopher Bird]], [[Thomas Berry]], [[David Abram]], [[Michael A. Cohen|Michael Cohen]], and William Fields. Some 500 people attended.&lt;ref&gt;Bunyard, Peter (1996), "Gaia in Action: Science of the Living Earth" (Floris Books)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Gaia conference===
In 1988, [[climatology|climatologist]] [[Stephen Schneider]] organised a conference of the [[American Geophysical Union]]. The first Chapman Conference on Gaia,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; was held in San Diego, California on March 7, 1988.

During the "philosophical foundations" session of the conference, [[David Abram]] spoke on the influence of metaphor in science, and of the Gaia hypothesis as offering a new and potentially game-changing metaphorics, while [[James Kirchner]] criticised the Gaia hypothesis for its imprecision. Kirchner claimed that Lovelock and Margulis had not presented one Gaia hypothesis, but four -

* [[Coevolution|CoEvolutionary]] Gaia: that life and the environment had evolved in a coupled way. Kirchner claimed that this was already accepted scientifically and was not new.
* [[Homeostatic]] Gaia: that life maintained the stability of the natural environment, and that this stability enabled life to continue to exist.
* [[Geophysics|Geophysical]] Gaia: that the Gaia hypothesis generated interest in geophysical cycles and therefore led to interesting new research in terrestrial geophysical dynamics.
* Optimising Gaia: that Gaia shaped the planet in a way that made it an optimal environment for life as a whole. Kirchner claimed that this was not testable and therefore was not scientific.

Of Homeostatic Gaia, Kirchner recognised two alternatives. "Weak Gaia" asserted that life tends to make the environment stable for the flourishing of all life. "Strong Gaia" according to Kirchner, asserted that life tends to make the environment stable, ''to enable'' the flourishing of all life. Strong Gaia, Kirchner claimed, was untestable and therefore not scientific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | bibcode=1989RvGeo..27..223K | doi = 10.1029/RG027i002p00223 | title=The Gaia hypothesis: Can it be tested? | date=1989 | last1=Kirchner | first1=James W. | journal=Reviews of Geophysics | volume=27 | issue=2 | pages=223 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lovelock and other Gaia-supporting scientists, however, did attempt to disprove the claim that the hypothesis is not scientific because it is impossible to test it by controlled experiment. For example, against the charge that Gaia was teleological, Lovelock and Andrew Watson offered the [[Daisyworld]] Model (and its modifications, above) as evidence against most of these criticisms.&lt;ref name="daisyworld"/&gt;  Lovelock said that the Daisyworld model "demonstrates that self-regulation of the global environment can emerge from competition amongst types of life altering their local environment in different ways".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid=10968941 | date=2000 | last1=Lenton | first1=TM | last2=Lovelock | first2=JE | title=Daisyworld is Darwinian: Constraints on adaptation are important for planetary self-regulation | volume=206 | issue=1 | pages=109–14 | doi=10.1006/jtbi.2000.2105 | journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lovelock was careful to present a version of the Gaia hypothesis that had no claim that Gaia intentionally or consciously maintained the complex balance in her environment that life needed to survive. It would appear that the claim that Gaia acts "intentionally" was a metaphoric statement in his popular initial book and was not meant to be taken literally. This new statement of the Gaia hypothesis was more acceptable to the scientific community. Most accusations of [[teleology|teleologism]] ceased, following this conference.

===Third Gaia conference===
By the time of the 2nd Chapman Conference on the Gaia Hypothesis, held at Valencia, Spain, on 23 June 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Simón|first=Federico|title=GEOLOGÍA Enfoque multidisciplinar La hipótesis Gaia madura en Valencia con los últimos avances científicos|journal=El País|date=21 June 2000|url=http://elpais.com/diario/2000/06/21/futuro/961538404_850215.html|accessdate=1 December 2013|language=spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; the situation had changed significantly. Rather than a discussion of the Gaian teleological views, or "types" of Gaia hypotheses, the focus was upon the specific mechanisms by which basic short term homeostasis was maintained within a framework of significant evolutionary long term structural change.

The major questions were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=General Information Chapman Conference on the Gaia Hypothesis University of Valencia Valencia, Spain June 19-23, 2000 (Monday through Friday) |url=http://www.agu.org/meetings/chapman/chapman_archive/cc00bcall.html |work=AGU Meetings |accessdate=7 January 2017 |author=American Geophysical Union }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# "How has the global biogeochemical/climate system called Gaia changed in time? What is its history? Can Gaia maintain stability of the system at one time scale but still undergo vectorial change at longer time scales? How can the geologic record be used to examine these questions?"
# "What is the structure of Gaia? Are the feedbacks sufficiently strong to influence the evolution of climate? Are there parts of the system determined pragmatically by whatever disciplinary study is being undertaken at any given time or are there a set of parts that should be taken as most true for understanding Gaia as containing evolving organisms over time? What are the feedbacks among these different parts of the Gaian system, and what does the near closure of matter mean for the structure of Gaia as a global ecosystem and for the productivity of life?"
# "How do models of Gaian processes and phenomena relate to reality and how do they help address and understand Gaia? How do results from Daisyworld transfer to the real world? What are the main candidates for "daisies"? Does it matter for Gaia theory whether we find daisies or not? How should we be searching for daisies, and should we intensify the search? How can Gaian mechanisms be investigated using process models or global models of the climate system that include the biota and allow for chemical cycling?"

In 1997, Tyler Volk argued that a Gaian system is almost inevitably produced as a result of an evolution towards far-from-equilibrium homeostatic states that maximise [[entropy]] production, and Kleidon (2004) agreed stating: "...homeostatic behavior can emerge from a state of MEP associated with the planetary albedo"; "...the resulting behavior of a biotic Earth at a state of MEP may well lead to near-homeostatic behavior of the Earth system on long time scales, as stated by the Gaia hypothesis". Staley (2002) has similarly proposed "...an alternative form of Gaia theory based on more traditional Darwinian principles... In [this] new approach, environmental regulation is a consequence of population dynamics, not Darwinian selection. The role of selection is to favor organisms that are best adapted to prevailing environmental conditions. However, the environment is not a static backdrop for evolution, but is heavily influenced by the presence of living organisms. The resulting co-evolving dynamical process eventually leads to the convergence of equilibrium and optimal conditions".

===Fourth Gaia conference===
A fourth international conference on the Gaia hypothesis, sponsored by the Northern Virginia Regional Park Authority and others, was held in October 2006 at the Arlington, VA campus of George Mason University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaia Theory Conference at George Mason University Law School|url=http://www.arlingtonva.us/departments/Communications/PressReleases/page7530.aspx|accessdate=1 December 2013|author=Official Site of Arlington County Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin Ogle, Chief Naturalist, for NVRPA, and long-time Gaia hypothesis proponent, organized the event.  Lynn Margulis, Distinguished University Professor in the Department of Geosciences, University of Massachusetts-Amherst, and long-time advocate of the Gaia hypothesis, was a keynote speaker. Among many other speakers: Tyler Volk, Co-director of the Program in Earth and Environmental Science at New York University; Dr. Donald Aitken, Principal of Donald Aitken Associates; Dr. Thomas Lovejoy, President of the Heinz Center for Science, Economics and the Environment; Robert Correll, Senior Fellow, Atmospheric Policy Program, American Meteorological Society and noted environmental ethicist, J. Baird Callicott.

This conference approached the Gaia hypothesis as both science and metaphor as a means of understanding how we might begin addressing 21st century issues such as climate change and ongoing environmental destruction.

==Criticism==
After initially being largely ignored by most scientists (from 1969 until 1977), thereafter for a period the initial Gaia hypothesis was criticized by a number of scientists, such as [[Ford Doolittle]],&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doolittle|first=W. F.|year=1981|title=Is Nature Really Motherly|url=|journal=The Coevolution Quarterly|volume=Spring|pages=58–63|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Dawkins]]&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Extended Phenotype: the Long Reach of the Gene|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1982|isbn=0-19-286088-7|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Stephen Jay Gould]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Turney, Jon. "Lovelock and Gaia: Signs of Life" (Revolutions in Science)&lt;/ref&gt; Lovelock has said that because his hypothesis is named after a Greek goddess, and championed by many non-scientists,&lt;ref name="Lovelock01"/&gt; the Gaia hypothesis was interpreted as a [[neo-Pagan]] [[religion]]. Many scientists in particular also criticised the approach taken in his popular book ''Gaia, a New Look at Life on Earth'' for being [[teleology|teleological]]—a belief that things are purposeful and aimed towards a goal. Responding to this critique in 1990, Lovelock stated, "Nowhere in our writings do we express the idea that planetary self-regulation is purposeful, or involves foresight or planning by the [[biota (ecology)|biota]]".

[[Stephen Jay Gould]] criticised Gaia as being "a metaphor, not a mechanism."&lt;ref name="Gould 1997"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gould S.J. |title=Kropotkin was no crackpot |journal=Natural History |volume=106 |pages=12–21 |date=June 1997  |url=http://libcom.org/library/kropotkin-was-no-crackpot |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wanted to know the actual mechanisms by which self-regulating homeostasis was achieved. In his defense of Gaia, David Abram argues that Gould overlooked the fact that "mechanism", itself, is a metaphor — albeit an exceedingly common and often unrecognized metaphor — one which leads us to consider natural and living systems as though they were machines organized and built from outside (rather than as [[autopoiesis|autopoietic]] or self-organizing phenomena). Mechanical metaphors, according to Abram, lead us to overlook the active or agential quality of living entities, while the organismic metaphorics of the Gaia hypothesis accentuate the active agency of both the biota and the biosphere as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Abram, D. (1988) "The Mechanical and the Organic: On the Impact of Metaphor in Science" in Scientists on Gaia, edited by Stephen Schneider and Penelope Boston, Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildethics.org/essays/the_mechanical_and_the_organic.html |title=The Mechanical and the Organic |accessdate=August 27, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223165936/http://www.wildethics.org/essays/the_mechanical_and_the_organic.html |archivedate=February 23, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to causality in Gaia, Lovelock argues that no single mechanism is responsible, that the connections between the various known mechanisms may never be known, that this is accepted in other fields of biology and ecology as a matter of course, and that specific hostility is reserved for his own hypothesis for other reasons.&lt;ref name="Lovelock, James 2001"&gt;Lovelock, James (2001), ''Homage to Gaia: The Life of an Independent Scientist'' (Oxford University Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from clarifying his language and understanding of what is meant by a life form, Lovelock himself ascribes most of the criticism to a lack of understanding of non-linear mathematics by his critics, and a linearizing form of [[greedy reductionism]] in which all events have to be immediately ascribed to specific causes before the fact. He also states that most of his critics are biologists but that his hypothesis includes experiments in fields outside biology, and that some self-regulating phenomena may not be mathematically explainable.&lt;ref name="Lovelock, James 2001"/&gt;

===Natural selection and evolution===
Lovelock has suggested that global biological feedback mechanisms could evolve by [[natural selection]], stating that organisms that improve their environment for their survival do better than those that damage their environment. However, in the early 1980s, [[Ford Doolittle|W. Ford Doolittle]] and [[Richard Dawkins]] separately argued against Gaia. Doolittle argued that nothing in the [[genome]] of individual organisms could provide the feedback mechanisms proposed by Lovelock, and therefore the Gaia hypothesis proposed no plausible mechanism and was unscientific.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Dawkins meanwhile stated that for organisms to act in concert would require foresight and planning, which is contrary to the current scientific understanding of evolution.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Like Doolittle, he also rejected the possibility that feedback loops could stabilize the system.

[[Lynn Margulis]], a microbiologist who collaborated with Lovelock in supporting the Gaia hypothesis, argued in 1999, that "[[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s grand vision was not wrong, only incomplete. In accentuating the direct competition between individuals for resources as the primary selection mechanism, Darwin (and especially his followers) created the impression that the environment was simply a static arena". She wrote that the composition of the Earth's atmosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere are regulated around "set points" as in [[homeostasis]], but those set points change with time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Margulis, Lynn. Symbiotic Planet: A New Look At Evolution. Houston: Basic Book 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionary biologist [[W. D. Hamilton]] called the concept of Gaia [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernican]], adding that it would take another [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] to explain how Gaian self-regulation takes place through Darwinian [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name=vanish09&gt;Lovelock, James.

===Criticism in the 21st century===
The Gaia hypothesis continues to be broadly skeptically received by the scientific community. For instance, arguments both for and against it were laid out in the journal ''Climatic Change'' in 2002 and 2003. A significant argument raised against it are the many examples where life has had a detrimental or destabilising effect on the environment rather than acting to regulate it.&lt;ref name="kirchner2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="volk2002"/&gt; Several recent books have criticised the Gaia hypothesis, expressing views ranging from "... the Gaia hypothesis lacks unambiguous observational support and has significant theoretical difficulties"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Waltham |first=David |authorlink=David Waltham |date=2014|title=Lucky Planet: Why Earth is Exceptional – and What that Means for Life in the Universe |url=http://www.iconbooks.com/blog/title/lucky-planet/ |location= |publisher=Icon Books |page= |isbn=9781848316560 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to "Suspended uncomfortably between tainted metaphor, fact, and false science, I prefer to leave Gaia firmly in the background"&lt;ref name="beerling2007"/&gt; to "The Gaia hypothesis is supported neither by evolutionary theory nor by the empirical evidence of the geological record".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cockell |first1=Charles |authorlink1=Charles Cockell |last2=Corfield |first2=Richard |last3=Dise |first3= Nancy  |last4=Edwards |first4=Neil  |last5=Harris |first5=Nigel  |date=2008 |title= An Introduction to the Earth-Life System |url= http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/earth-and-environmental-science/palaeontology-and-life-history/introduction-earth-life-system |location=Cambridge (UK) |publisher= Cambridge University Press |page= |isbn= 9780521729536 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[CLAW hypothesis]],&lt;ref name="CLAW87" /&gt; initially suggested as a potential example of direct Gaian feedback, has subsequently been found to be less credible as understanding of [[cloud condensation nuclei]] has improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1= Quinn |first1=P.K. |last2= Bates |first2=T.S. |title =The case against climate regulation via oceanic phytoplankton sulphur emissions |journal =Nature |volume=480 |pages =51–56 |date = 2011 |doi=10.1038/nature10580|bibcode = 2011Natur.480...51Q |pmid=22129724}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the [[Medea hypothesis]] was proposed: that life has highly detrimental (biocidal) impacts on planetary conditions, in direct opposition to the Gaia hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Ward (2009), ''The Medea Hypothesis: Is Life on Earth Ultimately Self-Destructive?'', {{ISBN|0-691-13075-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a recent book-length evaluation of the Gaia hypothesis considering modern evidence from across the various relevant disciplines the author, Toby Tyrrell, concluded that: "I believe Gaia is a dead end. Its study has, however, generated many new and thought provoking questions. While rejecting Gaia, we can at the same time appreciate Lovelock's originality and breadth of vision, and recognise that his audacious concept has helped to stimulate many new ideas about the Earth, and to champion a holistic approach to studying it".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Tyrrell |first=Toby |authorlink= |date= 2013|title= On Gaia: A Critical Investigation of the Relationship between Life and Earth |url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9959.html |location=Princeton |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=209 |isbn=9780691121581 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere he presents his conclusion "The Gaia hypothesis is not an accurate picture of how our world works".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Tyrrell |first = Toby |title =Gaia: the verdict is… |journal = New Scientist |volume = 220 |pages = 30–31 |date= 26 October 2013 |doi=10.1016/s0262-4079(13)62532-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statement needs to be understood as referring to the "strong" and "moderate" forms of Gaia—that the biota obeys a principle that works to make Earth optimal (strength 5) or favourable for life (strength 4) or that it works as a homeostatic mechanism (strength 3). The latter is the "weakest" form of Gaia that Lovelock has advocated. Tyrrell rejects it. However, he finds that the two weaker forms of Gaia—Coeveolutionary Gaia and Influential Gaia, which assert that there are close links between the evolution of life and the environment and that biology affects the physical and chemical environment—are both credible, but that it is not useful to use the term "Gaia" in this sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Tyrrell |first=Toby |authorlink= |date= 2013|title= On Gaia: A Critical Investigation of the Relationship between Life and Earth |url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9959.html |location=Princeton |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=208 |isbn=9780691121581 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Reeves''' (January 5, 1914&amp;nbsp;– June 16, 1959) was an American actor. He is best known for his role as [[Superman]] in the 1950s television program ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]''.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=George Reeves|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/person/107820/George-Reeves}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT2&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Luc Moullet and George Reeves|first=Dave|last=Kehr|date=January 2, 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/02/movies/homevideo/02dvd.html?fta=y&amp;_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His death at age 45 from a gunshot remains a polarizing topic; the official finding was suicide, but some believe that he was murdered or the victim of an accidental shooting.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The Guardian]]|title=Who killed Superman?|date=17 November 2006|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/nov/18/features.weekend1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=August 20, 2006|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=The (Tinsel) Town That Ate Superman|first=Kristopher|last=Tapley|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/20/movies/20tapl.html?pagewanted=print}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franksreelreviews.com/shorttakes/supermanreeves.htm|title=The Death of George Reeves – The Original Superman|publisher=Franksreelreviews.com|date=2010-04-16|accessdate=2010-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, Jan Alan, Speeding Bullet, M. Bifulco, 1999; {{ISBN|0-9619596-4-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Reeves was born '''George Keefer Brewer''' on January 5, 1914, in [[Woolstock, Iowa]], the son of Donald Carl Brewer and Helen Lescher.&lt;ref&gt;Clarion County, Iowa birth certificate&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reeves's [[gravestone|Mausoleum plaque]] erroneously lists his birth date as "1/6/1914," or January 6, 1914. However, a variety of sources state that his actual birth date was January 5, 1914, such as his Clarion County, Iowa, [[birth certificate]]. Retrieved 2010-01-19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;California death certificate&lt;/ref&gt; Reeves was born five months into their marriage&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Alma Archer. "My Cousin Superman", ''Galesburg Register-Mail'', June 15, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; and the couple separated soon after Reeves's birth. At this time, Reeves and his mother moved from Iowa to her home of [[Galesburg, Illinois]].&lt;ref name="Galesburg RegMail article"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galesburg.com/article/20140920/ENTERTAINMENTLIFE/140929987|title=‘Superman’ absent in Mom’s time of need|publisher=Galesburg Register Mail|date=September 20, 2014|accessdate=March 12, 2015|author=Tom Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Reeves's mother,&lt;ref&gt;Helen Roberta Lescher Brewer Bessolo (1894 - 1964) was the daughter of George Christian Lescher and Eliza Jane McKenzie, she died in a Pasadena hospital on June 18, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; who was of [[German descent]], moved to California to stay with her sister. There she met and married Frank Joseph Bessolo while Reeves's father married Helen Schultz in 1925. Reeves reportedly never saw his father again. In 1927, Frank Bessolo adopted George as his own son, and the boy took on his stepfather's last name, becoming '''George Bessolo'''.&lt;ref name="Superman Homepage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.supermanhomepage.com/tv/tv.php?topic=cast-crew/george-reeves|title=Superman Homepage|accessdate=June 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bessolo marriage lasted 15 years,&lt;ref&gt;Helen later was married for a third time to Harvey Maurice Overgaard.&lt;/ref&gt; ending in divorce, with the couple separating while Reeves was away visiting relatives. When he returned, his mother told him his stepfather had committed suicide.

According to biographer [[Jim Beaver]], Reeves did not know for several years that Bessolo was still alive. Reeves began acting and singing in high school and continued performing on stage as a student at [[Pasadena Junior College]].&lt;ref&gt;Pasadena Junior College Courier, 1934&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acting career==
While studying acting at the [[Pasadena Playhouse]], Reeves met his future wife, Ellanora Needles. They married on September 22, 1940, in [[San Gabriel, California]], at the Church of Our Savior. They had no children and divorced 10 years later.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Reeves's film career began in 1939 when he was cast as Stuart Tarleton (incorrectly listed in the film's credits as Brent Tarleton), one of [[Scarlett O'Hara]]'s suitors in ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''. It was a minor role, but he and [[Fred Crane (actor)|Fred Crane]] were in the film's opening scene. (Reeves and Crane both dyed their hair red to portray the Tarleton twins.) Reeves was contracted to [[Warner Brothers]] soon after being cast. Warner changed his professional name to George Reeves.&lt;ref name="Superman Homepage"/&gt; His ''Gone with the Wind'' screen credit reflects the change.  Between the start of ''Gone With the Wind'' production and its release 12 months later, several films on his Warner contract were made and released, making ''Gone With the Wind'' his first film role, but his fifth film release.

He starred in a number of two-reel short subjects and appeared in several B-pictures, including two with [[Ronald Reagan]] and three with [[James Cagney]] (''[[Torrid Zone]]'', ''[[The Fighting 69th]]'', and ''[[The Strawberry Blonde]]''). Warner loaned him to producer [[Alexander Korda]] to co-star with [[Merle Oberon]] in ''[[Lydia (film)|Lydia]]'', a box-office failure. Released from his Warner contract, he signed a contract at [[Twentieth Century-Fox]], but was released after only a handful of films, one of which was the [[Charlie Chan]] movie ''[[Dead Men Tell]]''. He freelanced, appearing in five [[Hopalong Cassidy]] westerns before director [[Mark Sandrich]] cast Reeves as Lieutenant John Summers opposite [[Claudette Colbert]] in ''[[So Proudly We Hail!]]'' (1942), a war drama for [[Paramount Pictures]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Reeves was drafted into the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] in early 1943.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. World War II Army Enlistment Records 1938–1946, dated 24 March 1943&lt;/ref&gt; He was assigned to the [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]] and performed in the USAAF's [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] show ''[[Winged Victory (play)|Winged Victory]]''. The long Broadway run was followed by a national tour and a [[Winged Victory (film)|movie]] version. Reeves was then transferred to the Army Air Forces' [[First Motion Picture Unit]], where he made training films.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Discharged at the war's end, Reeves returned to Hollywood. However, many studios were slowing down their production schedules, and some production units had shut down completely. He appeared in a pair of outdoor thrillers with [[Ralph Byrd]] and in a serial produced by [[Sam Katzman]], ''[[Adventures of Sir Galahad|The Adventures of Sir Galahad]]''. Reeves fit the rugged requirements of the roles and, with his retentive memory for dialogue, he did well under rushed production conditions. He was able to play against type and starred as a villainous gold hunter in a [[Johnny Weissmuller]] [[Jungle Jim]] film. Separated from his wife (their divorce became final in 1950), Reeves moved to [[New York City]] in 1949. He performed on live television anthology programs, as well as on radio, and then returned to Hollywood in 1951 for a role in a [[Fritz Lang]] film, ''[[Rancho Notorious]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"George Reeves Returns", HOLLYWOOD REPORTER, April 11, 1951, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, Reeves played a minor character, Sergeant Maylon Stark, in ''[[From Here To Eternity]]''. The film won the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], and gave Reeves the distinction of appearing in two "Best Picture" films.

===Superman===
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Superman and the Mole Men video capture.JPG|thumb|200px|Reeves and [[Phyllis Coates]] in ''[[Superman and the Mole Men]]'']] --&gt;
In June 1951, Reeves was offered the role of [[Superman]] in a new television series&lt;ref&gt;"Reeves Now Superman", HOLLYWOOD REPORTER, June 25, 1951, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; titled ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]''. He was initially reluctant to take the role because, like many actors of his time, he considered television unimportant and believed few would see his work. The half-hour films were shot on tight schedules; at least two shows were made every six days. According to commentaries on the ''Adventures of Superman'' DVD sets, multiple scripts would be filmed simultaneously to take advantage of the standing sets so that, for example, all the "Perry White's office" scenes for three or four episodes would be shot the same day and the various "apartment" scenes would be done consecutively.

Reeves's career as Superman had begun with ''[[Superman and the Mole Men]]'', a film intended both as a B-picture and as the pilot for the TV series. Immediately after completing it, Reeves and the crew began production of the first season's episodes, all shot over 13 weeks in the summer of 1951. The series went on the air the following year, and Reeves was amazed at becoming a national celebrity. In 1952, the struggling [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC Network]] purchased the show for national broadcast, which gave him greater visibility.

The Superman cast members had restrictive contracts which prevented them from taking other work that might interfere with the series. Except for the second season, the Superman schedule was brief (13 shows shot two per week, a total of seven weeks out of a year), but all had a "30-day clause", which meant that the producers could demand their exclusive services for a new season on four weeks' notice. This prevented long-term work on major films with long schedules, stage plays which might lead to a lengthy run, or any other series work.&lt;ref name="Grossman, page 121"&gt;Grossman, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reeves, however, earned additional income from personal appearances. He had affection for his young fans, and took his role model status seriously. He avoided cigarettes where children could see him and eventually quit smoking. He kept his private life discreet. Nevertheless, he had a romantic relationship with a married ex-showgirl eight years his senior, [[Toni Mannix]], wife of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] general manager [[Eddie Mannix]].

In the documentary ''[[Look, Up in the Sky: The Amazing Story of Superman]]'', [[Jack Larson]] described how when he first met Reeves he told him that he enjoyed his performance in ''So Proudly We Hail!'' According to Larson, Reeves said that if Mark Sandrich had not died, he would not be there in "this monkey suit". Larson said it was the only time he heard Reeves say anything negative about being Superman.

Between the first and second seasons of ''Superman'', Reeves got sporadic acting assignments in one-shot TV anthology programs and in two feature films, ''[[Forever Female]]'' (1953) and [[Fritz Lang]]'s ''[[The Blue Gardenia (film)|The Blue Gardenia]]'' (1953), but by the time the series was airing nationwide, Reeves found himself so [[Typecasting (acting)|associated]] with Superman and Clark Kent that it was difficult for him to find other roles.

Reeves worked tirelessly with Toni Mannix to raise money to fight [[myasthenia gravis]]. He served as national chairman for the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation in 1955. During the second season, Reeves appeared in a short film for the Treasury Department entitled ''[[Stamp Day for Superman]]'', in which he caught the villains and told children why they should invest in government [[savings stamp]]s.
[[File:Stamp Day for Superman.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Screen capture of Reeves as Superman in the U.S. government film ''[[Stamp Day for Superman]]'']]

After two seasons, Reeves was dissatisfied with his salary and the show's one-dimensional role. He was 40 years old and wished to quit and move on with his career. The producers looked elsewhere for a new star,&lt;ref&gt;Variety, September 27, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; allegedly contacting [[Kirk Alyn]], the actor who had first portrayed Superman in the original movie serials and who had initially refused to play the role on television.

Reeves established his own production company and conceived a TV adventure series called ''Port of Entry'' which would be shot on location in Hawaii and Mexico, writing the pilot script himself. However, ''Superman'' producers offered him a salary increase and he returned to the series.&lt;ref&gt;Variety, October 27, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; He was reportedly making $5,000 (about $50,000 in 2018 dollars) per week, but only while the show was in production (about eight weeks each year).&lt;ref name="Grossman, page 121"/&gt; As for ''Port of Entry'', Reeves was never able to gain financing for the project, and the show was never made.

In 1957, the producers considered a theatrical film ''Superman and the Secret Planet''. A script was commissioned from David Chantler, who had written many of the TV scripts. In 1959, however, negotiations began for a renewal of the series, with 26&amp;nbsp;episodes scheduled to go into production. ([[John Hamilton (actor)|John Hamilton]], who had played [[Perry White]], died in 1958, so the former film-serial Perry White [[Pierre Watkin]] was to replace him.)

By mid 1959, contracts were signed, costumes refitted, and new teleplay writers assigned. Noel Neill was quoted as saying that the cast of ''Superman'' was ready to do a new series of the still-popular show.&lt;ref&gt;''DC Comics: Sixty Years of the World's Favorite Comic Book Heroes,'' no page cited.&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempting to showcase his versatility, Reeves sang on the [[Tony Bennett]] show in August 1956.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared as Superman on ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' (Episode #165, "[[Lucy and Superman]]") in 1957. Character actor [[Ben Welden]] had acted with Reeves in the Warner Bros. days and frequently guest-starred on ''Superman''. He said, "After the ''I Love Lucy'' show, Superman was no longer a challenge to him.... I know he enjoyed the role, but he used to say, 'Here I am, wasting my life.'"&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; His good friend [[Bill Walsh (producer)|Bill Walsh]], a producer at [[Disney]] Studios, gave Reeves a prominent role in ''[[Westward Ho the Wagons!]]'' (1956), in which Reeves wore a beard and mustache. It was to be his final feature film appearance.

Reeves, Noel Neill, [[Natividad Vacío]], [[Gene LeBell]], and a trio of musicians toured with a public appearance show from 1957 onward. The first half of the show was a ''Superman'' sketch in which Reeves and Neill performed with LeBell as a villain called "Mr. [[Kryptonite]]" who captured Lois Lane. Kent then rushed offstage to return as Superman, who came to the rescue and fought with the bad guy. The second half of the show was Reeves out of costume and as himself, singing and accompanying himself on the guitar. Vacio and Neill accompanied him in duets.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reeves and Toni Mannix split in 1958, and Reeves announced his engagement to society playgirl Leonore Lemmon. Reeves was apparently scheduled to marry Lemmon on June 19 and then spend their honeymoon in Tijuana. He complained to friends, columnists, and his mother of his financial problems. The planned revival of ''Superman'' was apparently a small lifeline. Reeves had also hoped to direct a low-budget science-fiction film written by a friend from his Pasadena Playhouse days, and he had discussed the project with his first Lois Lane, [[Phyllis Coates]], the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Reeves and his partner failed to find financing, and the film was never made. Another Superman stage show was scheduled for July&lt;ref&gt;New York Post, June 17, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; with a planned stage tour of [[Australia]]. Reeves had options for making a living, but those options apparently all involved playing Superman again&amp;mdash;a role that he was not eager to reprise at age 45.

Jack Larson and Noel Neill both remembered Reeves as a noble Southern gentleman (even though he was from Iowa) with a sign on his dressing room door that said "Honest George, the people's friend".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Look, Up in the Sky: The Amazing Story of Superman]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Reeves had been made a "[[Kentucky Colonel]]" during a publicity trip in the South, and the sign on his dressing room door was replaced with a new one that read "Honest George, also known as Col. Reeves", created by the show's prop department. A photo of a smiling Reeves and the sign appears in Gary Grossman's book about the show.

==Death==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2010}}
Reeves died of a gunshot wound to the head in the upstairs bedroom of his home in [[Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles, California|Benedict Canyon]] between 1:30 and 2:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. on June 16, 1959, according to the Los Angeles Police Department report. The police arrived within the hour. Present in the house at the time of the incident were Leonore Lemmon (Reeves's fiancée), William Bliss, writer Robert Condon, and Carol Van Ronkel, who lived a few blocks away with her husband, screenwriter Rip Van Ronkel.

According to these witnesses, Lemmon and Reeves had been dining and drinking earlier in the evening in the company of writer Condon, who was [[Ghostwriter|ghostwriting]] an autobiography of prizefighter [[Archie Moore]]. Reeves and Lemmon had an argument at the restaurant in front of Condon, and the three of them returned home. However, Lemmon stated in interviews with Reeves's biographer Jim Beaver that she and Reeves had not accompanied friends to the restaurant but rather to wrestling matches. Contemporaneous news items indicate that Reeves's friend [[Gene LeBell]] was wrestling that night—yet LeBell's own recollections are that he did not see Reeves after a workout session earlier in the day.

Sometime near midnight, after Reeves had gone to bed, an impromptu party began when Bliss and Carol Van Ronkel arrived at the Reeves home. Reeves angrily came downstairs and complained about the noise. After blowing off steam, he stayed with the guests for a while, had a drink, and then returned upstairs again in a bad mood. The guests later heard a single gunshot from upstairs. Bliss ran upstairs into Reeves's bedroom and found him lying across the bed dead, his naked body facing upward and his feet on the floor. It is believed that this corroborated Reeves's sitting position on the edge of the bed when he allegedly shot himself, after which his body fell back on the bed and the .30 caliber (7.65×21mm) [[Luger P08 pistol|Luger]] pistol fell between his feet.

Statements made by the witnesses to the police and to the press essentially agree. Neither Leonore Lemmon nor other guests who were at the scene made any apology for their delay in calling the police after hearing the fatal gunshot that killed Reeves; the shock of the death, the lateness of the hour, and their state of intoxication were given as reasons for the delay. Police said that all of the witnesses present were extremely inebriated and that coherent stories were very difficult to obtain from them.

In contemporary news articles, Lemmon attributed Reeves's alleged suicide to depression caused by his "failed career" and inability to find more work. The report made by the Los Angeles Police states, "[Reeves was]... depressed because he couldn't get the sort of parts he wanted." Newspapers and wire-service reports quoted LAPD Sergeant V.A. Peterson as saying: "Miss Lemmon blurted, 'He's probably going to go shoot himself.' A noise was heard upstairs. She continued, 'He's opening a drawer to get the gun.' A shot was heard. 'See there—I told you so!'"'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EQMdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7ooEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7331,1693817&amp;dq=george+reeves+lenore+lemmon+i+told+you+so&amp;hl=en|title=Actor Commits Suicide|date=June 17, 1959|work=Sarasota Journal|page=14|accessdate=January 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official story given by Lemmon to the police placed her in the living room with party guests at the time of the shooting, but hearsay statements from Reeves's friend and colleague from ''Gone With The Wind'' Fred Crane put Leonore Lemmon either inside or in direct proximity to Reeves's bedroom.&lt;ref&gt;Speeding Bullet, 2nd Ed, by Jan Alan Henderson, page 151&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Crane (who was not present), Bill Bliss had told Millicent Trent after the shot rang out, while Bliss was having a drink, that Leonore Lemmon came downstairs and said, “Tell them I was down here, tell them I was down here!”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glasshousepresents.com/Fred_Crane.htm|title=Glass House Presents|publisher=Glass House Presents|accessdate=2010-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of questionable physical findings were reported by investigators and others:  No fingerprints were recovered from the gun.  No gunpowder residue was found on Reeves's hands. (Some sources contend that it may not have been looked for, as gunshot residue testing was not routinely performed in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1556/was-em-superman-em-star-george-reeves-a-suicide-or-murder-victim "Was Superman star George Reeves a suicide — or murder victim?"], StraightDope.com; accessed October 31, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;)  The bullet that killed Reeves was recovered from the bedroom ceiling, and the spent shell casing was found under his body. Two additional bullets were discovered embedded in the bedroom floor.  All three bullets had been fired from the weapon found at Reeves's feet, though all witnesses agreed they heard only one gunshot, and there was no sign of forced entry or other physical evidence that a second person was in the room.&lt;ref name = "who"/&gt;  Despite the unanswered questions, Reeves's death was officially ruled a suicide, based on witness statements, physical evidence at the scene, and the autopsy report.&lt;ref&gt;Los Angeles Police Department Death Report, June 26, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reeves's mother thought the ruling premature and peremptory, and retained attorney [[Jerry Giesler]] to petition for a reinvestigation of the case as a possible homicide. The findings of a second autopsy, conducted at Giesler's request, were the same as the first, except for a series of bruises of unknown origin about the head and body. A month later, having uncovered no evidence contradicting the official finding, Giesler announced that he was satisfied that the gunshot wound had been self-inflicted, and withdrew.&lt;ref&gt;''Los Angeles Mirror-News'', June 24, 1959&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "who"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/04/14/who-killed-superman-the-sinister-true-story-behind-the-death-of/ Who Killed Superman?] ''The Telegraph'' (March 13, 2016), retrieved August 17, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reeves is interred at Mountain View Cemetery and Mausoleum in [[Altadena, California]]. In 1960, Reeves was awarded a star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame on Hollywood Boulevard for his contributions to the TV industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic| writer=Marx, Barry|cowriters=[[Joey Cavalieri|Cavalieri, Joey]] and Hill, Thomas|artist=Petruccio, Steven|editor=Marx, Barry|story=George Reeves America Loves Superman|title=Fifty Who Made DC Great|date=1985|publisher=DC Comics|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1985, he was posthumously named one of the honorees by DC Comics in the company's 50th anniversary publication ''[[Fifty Who Made DC Great]]''.

===Controversy===

Actors [[Alan Ladd]] and [[Gig Young]] were reportedly skeptical of the official determination.  Reeves's friend [[Rory Calhoun]] told a reporter, "No one in Hollywood believed the suicide story."  In their book ''Hollywood Kryptonite'', Sam Kashner and Nancy Schoenberger make a case for the involvement of Toni Mannix, the wife of MGM vice president and fixer [[Eddie Mannix]], with whom Reeves had been having an affair. Others suggested that Eddie Mannix—rumored to have mafia ties—ordered Reeves killed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/2000/12/03/ent_299454.shtml#.WOflWxRGWA0 Death of Superman may not have been a suicide].

[[File:Affleck superman.jpg|thumb|[[Ben Affleck]] as George Reeves in ''[[Hollywoodland]]'']]
The 2006 film ''[[Hollywoodland]]'', starring [[Ben Affleck]] as Reeves and [[Adrien Brody]] as a fictional investigator loosely based on actual detective Milo Speriglio, dramatizes the investigation of Reeves's death.  The film suggests three possible scenarios: accidental shooting by Lemmon, murder by an unnamed hitman under orders from Eddie Mannix, and suicide.

Toni Mannix suffered from [[Alzheimer's disease]] for years and died in 1983. In 1999, Los Angeles publicist [[Edward Lozzi]] said that Toni Mannix had confessed to a Catholic priest in Lozzi's presence that she was responsible for having Reeves killed. (This was following the resurrection of the Reeves case by TV shows ''[[Unsolved Mysteries]]'' and ''[[Mysteries and Scandals]]''.) Lozzi made the statement on TV tabloid shows, including ''[[Extra (U.S. TV program)|Extra]]'', ''[[Inside Edition]]'', and ''[[Court TV]]''. In the wake of ''Hollywoodland''{{'}}s publicity in 2006, Lozzi repeated his story to the tabloid ''[[The Globe (tabloid)|The Globe]]'' and to the ''[[LA Times]]'', where the statement was disputed by Jack Larson. Larson stated that facts which he knew from his close friendship with Toni Mannix precluded Lozzi's story from being true. According to Lozzi, he lived with and then visited the elderly Mannix from 1979 to 1982 and on at least a half-dozen occasions he called a priest when Mrs. Mannix feared death and wanted to confess her sins. Mannix suffered from Alzheimer's disease and senile dementia, but Lozzi says that her confession was made during a period of lucidity in Mannix's home before she was moved from her house to a hospital. Mannix lived in a hospital suite for the last several years of her life, having donated a large portion of her estate to the hospital in exchange for perpetual care. Lozzi also told of Tuesday night prayer sessions that Toni Mannix conducted with him and others at an altar shrine to Reeves that she had built in her home. Lozzi stated, "During these prayer sessions she prayed loudly and trance-like to Reeves and God, and without confessing yet, asked them for forgiveness." Lozzi's statement, however, is unsupported by independent evidence.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

[[File:9mm-hollowpoint from XC75.jpg|thumb|Gunshot residue from a pistol shot]]
'''Gunshot residue (GSR)''', also known as '''cartridge discharge residue''' (CDR), "gunfire residue" (GFR), or '''firearm discharge residue''' (FDR), is residue deposited on the hands and clothes of someone who discharges a [[firearm]]. It is principally composed of burnt and unburnt particles from the [[explosive primer]], the [[propellant]]—and possibly fragments of the [[bullet]], [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]] case, and the firearm.

Law enforcement investigators test the clothing and skin of people for GSR to determine if they were near a gun when it discharged. Gunshot residue can travel over 3–5 feet (0.9–1.5 meters) from the gun. At the farthest distance, only a few trace particles may be present.

==History==
In 1971 John Boehm presented some [[micrographs]] of GSR particles found during the examination of bullet entrance holes using a [[scanning electron microscope]]. If the scanning electron microscope is equipped with an [[energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]] detector, the [[chemical elements]] present in such particles, mainly [[lead]], [[antimony]] and [[barium]], can be identified.

In 1979 Wolten et al. proposed a classification of GSR based on composition, [[Morphology (chemistry)|morphology]], and size. Four compositions were considered ''characteristic'':
* [[Lead]], [[antimony]], and [[barium]]
* Barium, [[calcium]], and [[silicon]]
* Antimony
* Barium
The authors proposed some rules about chemical elements that could also be present in these particles.

Wallace and McQuillan published a new classification of the GSR particles in 1984. They labeled as ''unique'' particles those that contain lead, antimony, and barium, or that contain antimony and barium. Wallace and McQuillan also maintained that these particles could contain only some chemical elements.

==Current practice==
In the latest [[ASTM]] Standard Guide for GSR analysis by Scanning Electron Microscopy/Energy Dispersive [[X-ray]] [[Spectroscopy|Spectrometry]] (SEM-EDX) particles containing lead, antimony and barium, and respecting some rules related to the morphology and to the presence of other elements are considered characteristic of GSR. The most definitive method to determine whether a particle is characteristic of or consistent with GSR is by its elemental profile. An approach to the identification of particles characteristic of or consistent with GSR is to compare the elemental profile of the recovered particulate with that collected from case-specific known source items, such as the recovered [[weapon]], Cartridge cases or victim-related items whenever necessary. This approach was called ‘‘case by case’’ by Romolo and Margot in an article published in 2001. In 2010 Dalby et al. published the latest review on the subject and concluded that the adoption of a "case by case" approach to GSR analysis must be seen as preferable, in agreement with Romolo and Margot.

In light of similar particles produced from extraneous sources, both Mosher et al. (1998) and Grima et al. (2012) presented evidence of pyrotechnic particles that can be mistakenly identified as GSR. Both publications highlight that certain markers of exclusion and reference to the general population of collected particulate can help the expert in designating GSR-similar particles as [[Fireworks|firework]]-sourced.

Particle analysis by scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy detector is the most powerful [[forensic]] tool that investigators can use to determine a subject's proximity to a discharging firearm or contact with a surface exposed to GSR (firearm, spent cartridge case, target hole). Test accuracy requires procedures that avoid secondary gunshot residue transfer from police officers onto subjects or items to be tested, and that avoid [[contamination]] in the laboratory.

The two main groups of specialists currently active on gunshot residue analysis are the [[Scientific Working Group]] for Gunshot Residue (SWGGSR) based in USA and the ENFSI EWG Firearms/GSR  Working Group based in Europe.

==Results==
A positive result for GSR from SEM-EDX analysis can mean many things.  Mainly it indicates that the person sampled was either in the vicinity of a gun when it was fired, handled a gun after it was fired, or touched something that was around the gun when it was fired. (For example: When a person goes to the aid of a victim of a gunshot wound, some GSR particles can transfer from the victim.)

A negative result can mean that the person was nowhere near the gun when it was fired, or that they were near it but not close enough for GSR to land on them, or it can mean that the GSR deposited on them wore off. GSR is the consistency of flour and typically only stays on the hands of a living person for 4–6 hours.  Wiping the hands on anything, even putting them in and out of pockets can transfer GSR off the hands.  Victims don't always get GSR on them; even suicide victims can test negative for GSR.

==Matching GSR to a specific source==
If the ammunition used was specifically tagged in some way by special elements, it is possible to know the cartridge used to produce the GSR. Inference about the source of GSR can be based on the examination of the particles found on a suspect and the population of particles found on the victim, in the firearm or in the cartridge case, as suggested by the ASTM Standard Guide for GSR analysis by Scanning Electron Microscopy/Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometry. Advanced analytical techniques such as Ion Beam Analysis (IBA), carried out after Scanning Electron Microscopy, can support further information allowing to infer about the source of GSR particles. Christopher et al. showed as the grouping behaviour of different makes of ammunition can be determined using multivariate analysis. Bullets can be matched back to a gun using comparative ballistics.

==Organic gunshot residue==
[[organic compound|Organic]] gunshot residue can be analysed by [[analytical techniques]] such as [[chromatography]], [[capillary electrophoresis]], and [[mass spectrometry]].

'''HMS ''Cormorant''''' was probably launched in 1803 at [[Howden]] Pans as the merchant ship '''''Blenheim'''''. The Admiralty purchased her in June and the [[Royal Navy]] took her into service to use her as a convoy escort. Then in 1809 it converted her into a storeship. After the Admiralty sold her in 1817, she resumed the ''Blenheim '' name and returned to mercantile service as a West Indiaman. She disappeared after 10 November 1821 and was presumed to have foundered.

==''Blenheim''==
''Blenehim'', of 327 tons (bm), only enters the ''Register of Shipping'' in 1806. It gives her master as Lamb, her owner as Hurry &amp; Co., and her trade as Shields–London.&lt;ref name=RS1805&gt;[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015021233559?urlappend=%3Bseq=89 ''Register of Shipping'' (18105), Seq.№B360.]&lt;/ref&gt; She does not appear in ''[[Lloyd's Register]]''.

==HMS ''Cormorant''==
The Admiralty purchased ''Blenheim'' in June 1804. ''Blenheim'' underwent surveying by Perry &amp; Co., Blackwall, between 26 May and 8 June 1804. The Admiralty purchased her in June, and she then underwent fitting at Woolwich between 8 June and 30 July.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt;

In June Commander James Stewart commissioned ''Cormorant'' for the North Sea. On 20 August 1805 ''Cormorant'' captured ''Liefde''. ''Cormorant'' sent ''Liefde'', Geret, master, into Yarmouth. ''Liefde'' had been sailing from [[Husum]] to amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.c2735022?urlappend=%3Bseq=147 ''[[Lloyd's List]]'' №4249.]&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|When the prize money was finally paid in 1820, a first-class share, i.e., Stewart's share, was worth [[£sd|£]]441 18[[shilling|s]] 6[[pence|d]]; a fifth-class share, that of a seaman or marine, was worth £8 9s 11½d.
&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|date=21 November 1820|issue=17653|page=2176}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

''Lloyd's List'' reported  on 23 August that ''Cormorant'' had sent into Yarmouth ''Vrow Jan___''. She had been carrying a cargo of [[indigo]] to [[Emden|Embden]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.c2735022?urlappend=%3Bseq=143 ''Lloyd's List'' №4247.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1805 Commander [[John Phillimore]] replaced Stewart.&lt;ref name=Phillimore&gt;Marshall (1827), Supple. Part 1, p.243.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 March 1806 ''Cormorant'' and {{HMS|Romulus|1785|2}} were in company at the capture of ''Minerva''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|date=8 May 1810|issue=16368|page=680}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phillimore left ''Cormorant'' in October, and Commander William Hughes replaced him.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt;

On 13 February 1807 ''Cormorant'' recaptured the brig ''Hope''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|date=3 March 1807|issue=16006|page=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French privateer lugger ''Revanche'', of Cherbourg, had captured ''Hope'', Blake, master, off [[Dunnose, Isle of Wight]], that day as ''Hope'' was returning to London from Madeira. ''Hope'' arrived at Portsmouth within the day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.c2735023?urlappend=%3Bseq=35 ''Lloyd's List'' №4127.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hughes sailed ''Cormorant'' in March 1807 to the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. On 26 January 1808 she captured the Dutch [[East Indiaman]] ''Marianne''. ''Cormorant'' sent ''Marian'', Kofoed, master, into the Cape on 8 February. She had been sailing from [[Batavia (Dutch East Indies)|Batavia]] to Copenhagen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.c2735023?urlappend=%3Bseq=293 ''Lloyd's List'' №4252.]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Vice admiralty court]] at the Cape condemned ''Marianne'' and remitted £40,000 to the Registry of the High Court of Admiralty in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|date=22 July 1809|issue=16278|page=1162}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Commander Hughes's share of the proceeds would have been at least £10,000, an amount in excess of 40 years salary. The fewer than 50 able and ordinary seamen, landsmen, and marines would have shared £5,000 equally, which compares with the annual wage for an ordinary seaman of about £22. This was only a partial payment. A second, more minor, disbursement, occurred later.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cormorant'' also detained and sent into the Cape three American vessels:&lt;ref&gt;[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.c2735023?urlappend=%3Bseq=35 ''Lloyd's List'' №4251.]&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Bellisarius'', Wilde, master, from Batavia
*''Telemachus'', Gallop, master, from Manila
*''Resolution'', Cracraft, master, from [[Mauritius|Île de France]]

Between October 1808 and July 1809 ''Cormorant'' underwent fitting as a storeship. She was recommissioned in April.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt;

However, ''Lloyd's List'' reported on 24 March 1809 that the sloop-of-war ''Cormorant'' had detained ''Batavia'', sailing from Rochelle to New York. ''Batavia''{{'}}s crew regained possession of her, but then the [[letter of marque]] {{ship||Irlam|1800 ship|2}} detained ''Batavia'' again.&lt;ref name=LL4338/&gt;&lt;ref name=LoM&gt;[http://www.1812privateers.org/Great%20Britain/marque1793-1815.pdf Letter of Marque, p.69 - accessed 25 July 2017.]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Irlam'' came into Liverpool, from where she went on to Barbados.&lt;ref name=LL4338&gt;[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.c2735024?urlappend=%3Bseq=55 ''Lloyd's List'' №4338.]&lt;/ref&gt; A later report credited {{HMS|Comet|1807|6}} with the first capture, not ''Cormorant'', and reported that ''Batavia''{{'}}s master, cook, and steward had recaptured ''Batavia'', this time from ''Irlam''{{'}}s prize crew, and had taken ''Batavia'' into New York, her original destination.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.c2735024?urlappend=%3Bseq=72 ''Lloyd's List'' №4346.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1813 Mr. W. Kirby was ''Cormorant''{{'}}s master. He sailed her to the Cape in company with {{HMS|Stirling Castle|1811|6}}, which was sailing to the East Indies. On the way, on 11 June, they boarded ''Ainsley'', Brown, master, which was returning to Liverpool from Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.c2735026?urlappend=%3Bseq=131 ''Lloyd's List'' №4791.]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cormorant'' returned to Portsmouth on 18 December. She had sailed from the Cape on 5 September, and from [[Saint Helena]] on 23 October. She had been in company with a number of [[whaler]]s and other vessels, including {{ship||Rambler|1812 ship|2}}.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.c2735026?urlappend=%3Bseq=220 ''Lloyd's List'' №4831.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1814 ''Cormorant'' sailed to Newfoundland. In 1815 Mr. T. Hodgson became her master.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt;

'''Disposal:''' The "Principal Officers and Commissioners of His Majesty's Navy" offered the "Cormorant storeship, of 328 tons", lying at Chatham, for sale on 3 April 1817.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|date=18 March 1817|issue=17232|page=700}}&lt;/ref&gt; She finally sold to Moates, at Chatham, for [[£sd|£]]1450 on 4 December 1817.

==''Blenheim'' again &amp; fate==
''Blenheim'' reentered ''Lloyd's Register'' in 1818 with Souter, master, S. Moates, owner, and trade London–Honduras.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015005686806?urlappend=%3Bseq=663 ''Lloyd's Register'' (1818), "B" supple. pages, №10.]&lt;/ref&gt; A tremendous gale hit the southeast coast of England on 5 March, damaging or even wrecking many vessels. ''Blenheim'', Souter, master, bound for Honduras, was blown out of [[The Downs (ship anchorage)|The Downs]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.c2735028?urlappend=%3Bseq=281 ''Lloyd's List'' №5260.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Register of Shipping'' for 1823 showed ''Blenheim'' with Webster, master, S. Moats, owner, and trade Bristol–Jamaica.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015008015680?urlappend=%3Bseq=97 ''Register of Shipping'' (1823), Seq. №331.]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lloyd's List'' reported on 26 March 1822 that ''Blenheim'', "late Webster", master, had departed from Annato Bay, Jamaica, on 1o November 1821 for [[London]]. There was on further trace of her and she was presumed to have foundered with the loss of all hands.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.c2735032?urlappend=%3Bseq=106 ''Lloyd's List'' №5684.]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3841">'''Hamstringing''' is a method of crippling a person or animal so that they cannot walk properly by severing the [[hamstring]] [[tendons]] in the thigh of the individual. It is used as a method of [[torture]], or to incapacitate the victim.

==Use==
Hamstringing is used primarily to incapacitate a [[human]] or [[animal]] and render them incapable of effective movement. The severing of the hamstring muscles results not only in the crippling of the leg, but also in tremendous pain&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hamstringinjury.net/hamstring_injury_signs_and_symptoms.html Hamstring Injury.net, Hamstring Injury Relief and Help Guide]&lt;/ref&gt; common to heavy laceration.

==Method==
In humans, the [[hamstring]] extends between the hip and knee joints. The hamstring muscle group is made up of the [[biceps femoris]], [[semitendinosus muscle]], and the [[semimembranosus]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=Wayne|last1=Hoskins|first2=Henry|last2=Pollard|title=Hamstring injury management—Part 2: Treatment|journal=Manual Therapy|volume=10|year=2005|pages=180–190|doi=10.1016/j.math.2005.05.001|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It facilitates both the flexing of the knee and hip extension,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livestrong.com/article/151904-what-is-the-purpose-function-of-the-hamstring/ Brughelli, Matt. (2011)]&lt;/ref&gt; making it a vital contributor to normal leg movement.  By severing these muscles or the tendons involved in this process, normal leg movement is disrupted. In addition to sustaining massive bleeding, the injured leg becomes useless and the victim is rendered lame. The severing of the hamstring is usually accomplished through use of a blade such as a knife or [[sword]].

==Medical treatment==
Due to a lack of research in the field of critical hamstring injuries, the current injury management is quite limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 23288753 | doi=10.1055/s-0032-1324811 | volume=26 | title=Hamstring pain and muscle strains following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a prospective, randomized trial comparing hamstring graft harvest techniques | journal=J Knee Surg | pages=139-44 | last1 = D'Alessandro | first1 = P | last2 = Wake | first2 = G | last3 = Annear | first3 = P}}&lt;/ref&gt; Management of the injury is based solely "on clinical experience, anecdotal evidence and the knowledge of the biological basis of tissue repair."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;  These injuries are difficult to control or repair, leading often to permanent injury or even death by [[exsanguination]].

==Historical usage==

Sources from [[late antiquity]] indicate that hamstringing was commonly used to incapacitate combatants and prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/28587/28587-h/28587-h.htm|title=The Roman History of Ammianus Marcellinus|author=Ammianus Marcellinus|authorlink=Ammianus Marcellinus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use as metaphor==
Literally, to "hamstring" an individual is to sever the tissues of their hamstring. As a [[metaphor]] to be "hamstrung" suggests being limited, by external imposition or not, in a way that prevents full freedom of movement or utilization of resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=hamstring |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biblical references==

Rendering [[chariot]] [[horse]]s lame by hamstringing is mentioned in the [[Bible]], called "houghing" in the [[King James Version]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua%2011:9 Book of Joshua, Chapter 11, Verse 9 (King James Version)]&lt;/ref&gt; from an old spelling of ''[[hock (zoology)|hock]]''. In the Bible, this is seen as a positive{{fact|date=August 2018}} use of hamstringing because it prevents the horses from being used in warfare.

'''Henry Ryan Haney''' (1835 &amp;ndash; November 17, 1878) was an [[Ontario]] physician and political figure. He represented [[Monck (provincial electoral district)|Monck]] in the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]] as a [[Ontario Liberal Party|Liberal]] member from 1872 to 1878.

He served as [[coroner]] for [[Welland County, Ontario|Welland]]. He was first elected to the provincial legislature in an 1872 by-election after the sitting member, [[Lachlin McCallum]], resigned when it became illegal for members to sit in both the [[House of Commons of Canada]] and the Ontario legislature. Haney was reelected in 1875 but unseated on appeal; he was elected in the by-election that followed and represented Monck until his death in 1878.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/JDVN-LJN |title=Henry Haney |publisher=Family Search.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kashmir]] has been a disputed and divided territory with human rights abuses in both the section administered by India ([[Jammu and Kashmir]]) and that administered by Pakistan ([[Azad Kashmir]] and [[Gilgit-Baltistan]]). 
[[Kashmir conflict|The dispute]] began in 1947 with [[partition of India|the partition of the British Indian Empire]] into India and Pakistan.

==Indian Administered Kashmir==

===Line of Control===
The [[Line of Control]] (LOC) is a military control line between Indian and Pakistani-controlled parts of Kashmir. The line does not constitute a legally international boundary but it is a [[de facto]] border, designated in 1948 as a cease-fire line, it divided Kashmir into two parts and closed the Jehlum valley route, the only entrance of the [[Kashmir Valley]]. This territorial division which, to this day still exists severed many villages and separated family members from each other.&lt;ref&gt;Ranjan Kumar Singh, '''Sarhad: Zero Mile''', (Hindi), ''Parijat Prakashan'', {{ISBN|81-903561-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="loc kashmir"&gt;{{cite book | author=Women in Security, Conflict Management, a Peace (Program) | title=Closer to ourselves: stories from the journ towards peace in South Asia | url=https://books.google.com/books?q=line+of+control+separated+villages+families+relatives+in+kashmir&amp;btnG=Search+Books | accessdate=27 December 2012 |year=2008 | publisher=WISCOMP, Foundation for Universal Responsibility of His Holiness the Dalai Lam 2008 | isbn= | page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[landmines]] planted by the [[Army]] alongsides of the line have killed scores of innocent people and left thousands as disabled.

Since 1991, reports of rape by Islamic militants have increased, and there have been many cases of the militants threatening to kill the family unless a woman is handed over to the militants. According to the HRW, the rape victims of militants suffer ostracism and there is a "code of silence and fear" that prevents people from reporting such abuse. According to the HRW, the investigation of case of rape by militants is difficult because many Kashmiris are reluctant to discuss it for the fear of violent reprisals.&lt;ref name="HumanRightsCrisis"&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/INDIA937.PDF The Human Rights Crisis in Kashmir].

According to a resolution passed by the [[United States Congress]] in 2006, Islamic terrorists infiltrated the region in 1989 and forced most of the Kashmiri Pandits to flee Kashmir.

Pakistan, an Islamic Republic, imposes multiple restrictions on peoples' religious freedom.&lt;ref name= UNHCRpak&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/topic,463af2212,469f2dcf2,487ca21a2a,0.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008010101/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/topic%2C463af2212%2C469f2dcf2%2C487ca21a2a%2C0.html|title=Freedom in the World 2008&amp;nbsp;– Kashmir (Pakistan) |publisher=[[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] |date=2008-07-02 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious minorities also face unofficial economic and societal discrimination and have been targets of [[Sectarian violence in Pakistan|sectarian violence]].&lt;ref name= UNHCRpak/&gt;
	
The constitution of Azad Kashmir specifically prohibits activities that may be prejudicial to the state's accession to Pakistan, and as such regularly suppresses demonstrations against the government.&lt;ref name= UNHCRpak/&gt; A number of Islamist militant groups operate in this area including Al-Qaeda, with tacit permission from Pakistan's intelligence.&lt;ref name= UNHCRpak/&gt; 

There have been allegations of human rights abuse. A report titled "Kashmir: Present Situation and Future Prospects", which was submitted to the [[European Parliament]] by [[Emma Nicholson, Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne]], was critical of the lack of human rights, justice, democracy, and Kashmiri representation in the Pakistan National Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?233329 EU Report Rattles Pakistan], [[Outlook (magazine)]], 2006-12-08&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Human Rights Commission of Pakistan]], Pakistan's [[Inter Services Intelligence]] operates in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and is involved in extensive surveillance, arbitrary arrests, torture, and murder.&lt;ref name= UNHCRpak/&gt; Generally this is done with impunity and perpetrators go unpunished.&lt;ref name= UNHCRpak/&gt; The 2008 report by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees determined that [[Pakistan-administered Kashmir]] was 'Not free'.&lt;ref name= UNHCRpak/&gt; According to [[Shaukat Ali Kashmiri]], chairman of the International Kashmir Alliance, "On one hand Pakistan claims to be the champion of the right of self-determination of the Kashmiri people, but she has denied the same rights under its controlled parts of Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan".&lt;ref Name =GIC&gt;[http://www.german-info.com/press_shownews.php?pid=115 European Parliamentarians express concern for Gilgit-Baltistan], German Information Center, New Delhi, 2008-04-12&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, activists of nationalist Kashmiri groups staged a protest in [[Muzaffarabad]] to condemn the alleged rigging of elections and killing of an 18-year-old student during the elections. The killing had led to widespread protests in the district.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dawn.com/news/943921 Killing of youth in GB by-polls condemned], ''[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]'', 2009-12-27&lt;/ref&gt;

Large protests erupted during the [[February 2012 Kohistan Killings]] where 18 people were ordered off from a bus and killed by gunmen on the Islamabad-Gilgit route. The act drew condemnation from the [[UN Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-13-12854-Tension-prevails-in-GB-after-Kohistan-killings |title=Tension prevails in GB after Kohistan killings |publisher=Thenews.com.pk |date= |accessdate=2012-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gilgit-Baltistan===

The main demand of the people of Gilgit-Baltistan is a constitutional status to the region as a fifth province of Pakistan.&lt;ref name = indian_express&gt;{{cite web|author=Nadeem|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/gilgitbaltistan-a-question-of-autonomy/519428/1 |title=Gilgit-Baltistan: A question of autonomy |publisher=Indian Express |date=2009-09-21 |accessdate=2012-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = gilgit_polls /&gt; However, Pakistan claims that Gilgit-Baltistan cannot be given constitutional status due to Pakistan's commitment to [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 47|the 1948 UN resolution]].&lt;ref name=gilgit_polls/&gt;&lt;ref name=dawn_gilgit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.dawn.com/archives/30198 |title=DAWN: Gilgit-Baltistan autonomy |publisher=Archives.dawn.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601035500/http://archives.dawn.com/archives/30198 |archivedate=1 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, [[International Crisis Group]] stated that "Almost six decades after Pakistan's independence, the constitutional status of the Federally Administered Northern Areas (Gilgit and Baltistan), once part of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir and now under Pakistani control, remains undetermined, with political autonomy a distant dream. The region's inhabitants are embittered by Islamabad's unwillingness to devolve powers in real terms to its elected representatives. The rise of sectarian extremism is an alarming consequence of this denial of basic political rights".&lt;ref name=DAWN20090726&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/in-paper-magazine/encounter/political-unrest-in-gilgitbaltistan-679 Political unrest in Gilgit-Baltistan], ''[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]'', 2009-07-26&lt;/ref&gt; A two-day conference on Gilgit-Baltistan was held on 8–9 April 2008 at the European Parliament in [[Brussels]] under the auspices of the International Kashmir Alliance.&lt;ref name=thaindian10037588&gt;[http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/uncategorized/european-mps-concerned-at-rights-violations-in-pakistani-kashmir_10037588.html European MPs concerned at rights violations in Pakistani Kashmir], ''Thaindian News'', 2008-04-13&lt;/ref&gt; Several members of the [[European Parliament]] expressed concern over the human rights violation in Gilgit-Baltistan and urged the government of Pakistan to establish democratic institutions and rule of law in the area.&lt;ref name=thaindian10037588/&gt;&lt;ref name=indianexpress556767&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/link-aid-to-pak-with-effort-in-checking-terr/556767/ European Parliament concerned on Gilgit-Baltistan], ''[[The Indian Express|Indian Express]]'', 2009-12-20&lt;/ref&gt;
	
In 2009, the Pakistan government implemented an autonomy package for Gilgit-Baltistan which entails rights similar to those of Pakistan’s other provinces.&lt;ref name = indian_express/&gt; Gilgit-Baltistan thus gains province-like status without actually being conferred such a status constitutionally.&lt;ref name = indian_express/&gt;&lt;ref name = dawn_gilgit/&gt; The direct rule by Islamabad is replaced by an elected legislative assembly and its chief minister.&lt;ref name = indian_express/&gt;&lt;ref name = dawn_gilgit/&gt;
 	
There has been criticism and opposition to this move in Pakistan, India, and Pakistan administrated Kashmir.&lt;ref name=DAWN20090830&gt;[http://archives.dawn.com/archives/133073 Gilgit-Baltistan package termed an eyewash], [[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]], 2009-08-30&lt;/ref&gt; The move has been dubbed as an eyewash to hide the real mechanics of power, which allegedly are under the direct control of the Pakistani federal government.&lt;ref name=dailytimes2112010&gt;[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2010%5C01%5C21%5Cstory_21-1-2010_pg3_3 Discontents in Gilgit-Baltistan], [[Daily Times (Pakistan)]], 2010-04-21&lt;/ref&gt; The package was opposed by Pakistani Kashmiri politicians who claimed that the integration of Gilgit-Baltistan into Pakistan would undermine their case for the independence of Kashmir from India.&lt;ref name = gilgit_polls&gt;{{cite web|last=Shigri |first=Manzar |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/11/12/us-pakistan-election-idUSTRE5AB1ZE20091112 |title=Pakistan's disputed Northern Areas go to polls |publisher=Reuters.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 300 activists from Kashmiri groups protested during the first Gilgit-Baltistan legislative assembly elections, with some carrying banners reading "Pakistan's expansionist designs in Gilgit-Baltistan are unacceptable". However, many people of Gilgit-Baltistan oppose integration into Kashmir. They want their region to be merged into Pakistan as a separate province.&lt;ref name = gilgit_polls/&gt;

'''''Jean's Way''''' (originally subtitled '''''A Love Story'''''), a book by [[Derek Humphry]], is an account of Humphry's terminally ill wife's planned suicide from suffering. The book is his first on the issue of [[voluntary euthanasia]] and [[assisted suicide]].

== Overview==
[[Derek Humphry]], a journalist on the ''[[London Sunday Times]]'' and author of ''Because They're Black'', published ''Jean's Way'' in 1978. The book became a bestseller in the UK,{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} was translated into eight languages,{{which|date=March 2015}}{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} and has been reprinted 17 times.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}+

The 2003 printing in English by [[Norris Lane Press]] ({{ISBN|0-9637280-7-5}}) is 160 pages and includes a new full-color jacket and updated preface. The 2003 English edition is available in paperback and eBook PDF formats.

''Jean's Way'' translations have been published in Norway, Japan, Poland, Spain, Mexico, France, Turkey and Germany.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

== Jean Humphry==
Jean Humphry was born Jean Edna Crane on March 23, 1932, in Hulme (Manchester), UK. Her family moved to [[Wythenshawe]], a Manchester suburb, where Jean received a public school education. In 1951 Miss Crane was appointed 'Miss Wythenshawe', a volunteer task ceremoniously to open fetes, flower shows and exhibitions as the district had no Mayor. On May 4, 1953, Jean married Derek Humphry in Manchester. They had three sons, one adopted. She died March 29, 1975, in [[Langley Burrell]], Wiltshire, as a consequence of breast cancer which had become [[carcinomatosis]].

==Book summary==
At the time of the first publication's first edition, not only was assisted suicide against the law, it was also highly taboo.

Jean Humphry had suffered for more than two years from [[breast cancer]], which spread throughout her whole body, as described in the first nine chapters. She decided it was her time for an assisted death, and proceeded with her plan so that she could die in peace and dignity in her own home rather than in hospital. This was an individual decision; the couple did not know then (1975) about [[euthanasia]] and [[assisted suicide]], which later became highly controversial as the [[right to die]] issue mushroomed. [[Living Wills]] were then just becoming known.

Some nine months earlier, the couple had made a pact at Jean's instigation that she could take her life if she wished if the final weeks were unbearable to her. Jean had stipulated that she would only do it with Derek's agreement.

At Jean's request, Derek secured a lethal overdose from a sympathetic doctor and stored it in a secure place in their home in Wiltshire. When the pain and distress became too great to bear, Jean asked for the drugs so that she could die. When she was ready, Derek mixed the lethal potion into a mug of coffee. After saying, "Goodbye, my love" Jean downed the drink and died within the hour.

In Chapter 10, ''Is This the Day?'', Derek describes her last day before her death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finalexit.org/jeanframe.html "Is This the Day?", ''Jean's Way'' - Chapter 10]&lt;/ref&gt;

On publication of the book, British police asked Derek if it was true, and he signed a statement to the effect that it was. But the [[Director of Public Prosecutions (England and Wales)|Director of Public Prosecutions]], who has discretion over assisted suicide laws, decided not to prosecute Derek.

==Post publication==
The popularity of ''Jean's Way'' started the movement to legalize [[assisted suicide]] as a choice for competent adults at the end of life. (Previously, the movement had concentrated solely on '[[voluntary euthanasia]]' by direct injection.)

Derek founded the [[Hemlock Society]] in 1980 to campaign for greater acceptance of justifiable assisted suicide and also wrote the international bestselling book ''[[Final Exit]]''.

In 1990, ''Jean's Way'' became the basis for a dramatic stage play entitled ''[[Is This the Day? (play)|Is This the Day?]]'' written by [[Vilma Hollingbery]].  It had its world premiere at the [[Royal Theatre (Northampton)|Royal Theatre]] in Northampton, UK, and had short runs in Germany and the USA.

The book foreshadowed the [[Oregon Death with Dignity Act]], which Derek pioneered in 1986 and as a team player worked for its eventual passage in 1994. In the application of both Oregon law and [[Euthanasia in Switzerland|Swiss law]], with legally approved ways of assisting deaths at the end of life, Jean's Way is the method used. In [[Switzerland]] it is used by [[Dignitas (euthanasia group)|Dignitas]] and EXIT, the Swiss society for humane dying.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finalexit.org/jeans-way-book.html Used by permission of Derek Humphry.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John William Henry Tyler Douglas''' (3 September 1882 – 19 December 1930) was an English [[cricket]]er who was active in the early decades of the twentieth century. Douglas was an [[all-rounder]] who played for [[Essex County Cricket Club]] from 1901 to 1928 and captained the county from 1911 to 1928. He also played for [[England national cricket team|England]] and captained the England team both before and after the First World War with markedly different success. As well as playing cricket, Douglas was a notable amateur [[boxing|boxer]] who won the middleweight gold medal at the [[1908 Olympic Games]].

==Early life==
Douglas was the son of John Herbert Douglas (1853-1930) and Julia Ann (née Tyler)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-64942&lt;/ref&gt; and was born at [[Stoke Newington]], London in what is now Belfast Road. He was educated at [[Moulton Grammar School]] and [[Felsted School]] and joined his father's wood-importing firm, which supported his amateur status in cricket and boxing. Douglas also played football once for the England amateur side (occasion unknown, through loss of records).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corinthian-casuals.com/player-profiles1.html |title=Player Profiles – Corinthian-Casuals Football Club |publisher=Corinthian-casuals.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served in the [[Bedfordshire Regiment]] throughout [[World War I]], eventually as major (acting lieutenant-colonel).

==Boxing career==
In 1908 Douglas won an Olympic gold medal as a [[middleweight]] boxer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abae.co.uk/aba/index.cfm/about-boxing/boxing-at-the-olympic-games/ |title=Boxing at the Olympic Games – Amateur Boxing Association of England Limited |publisher=Abae.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; All three of his bouts, including the final, described by The Times as "one of the most brilliant exhibitions of skilful boxing, allied to tremendous hitting, ever seen.", were held on the same day.&lt;ref name="boxing-monthly1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boxing-monthly.co.uk/content/0402/two.htm |title=Boxing Monthly |publisher=Boxing Monthly |date=2004-02-26 |accessdate=2014-05-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113102802/http://www.boxing-monthly.co.uk/content/0402/two.htm |archivedate=13 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The silver medal winner, [[Reginald Baker (sportsman)|Snowy Baker]], 44 years later falsely claimed that Douglas's father was the sole judge and referee.

Baker never publicly contested the close points verdict which Douglas, who scored a second-round knockdown over him and won in their Olympic final. Yet, in a 1952 interview, he claimed that Douglas’s father had refereed the fight, leading to widespread suspicion of a dodgy decision. In reality Douglas senior was at ringside, to present the medals, in his role as president of the [[Amateur Boxing Association of England]] (ABA). The real referee was Eugene Corri, who did not have to give a casting vote as the two judges agreed that Douglas was a narrow winner.&lt;ref name="boxing-monthly1" /&gt; Douglas Jr, his father and his younger brother, [[Pickles Douglas|Cecil ('Pickles')]] were all prominent referees and officials in the ABA, the last also being the leading referee in the professional sport in the 1930s. Besides his Olympic gold, Douglas also won the 1905 ABA middleweight title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abae.co.uk/aba/index.cfm/boxers/roll-of-honour/elite-abae-championship/1900-1909/1905/ |title=1905 – Amateur Boxing Association of England Limited |publisher=Abae.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-05-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131123203044/http://www.abae.co.uk/aba/index.cfm/boxers/roll-of-honour/elite-abae-championship/1900-1909/1905/ |archivedate=23 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxrec.com/media/index.php/John_Douglas |title=John Douglas – Boxrec Boxing Encyclopaedia |publisher=Boxrec.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cricket career==
Douglas  was an untiring fast-medium bowler and obdurate batsman who was nicknamed with a play on his initials JWHT "Johnny Won't Hit Today" by Australian hecklers. He captained the school teams at Felsted and was a member of Wanstead C.C. He played for [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]] in 1902 and for [[London County Cricket Club|London County]] in 1903. In 1904 he returned to Essex where he remained, captaining the side from 1911 to 1928. He played for [[English cricket team|England]] before and after the First World War. Douglas was named as a [[Wisden Cricketer of the Year]] in 1915, but play was suspended during the war years. After the war until 1923 had to carry Essex's bowling on his shoulders except when [[George Louden]] turned out. He took over 100 wickets in a season seven times with a best of 147 in 1920. The following year against [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club|Derbyshire]] he produced perhaps the most remarkable all-round performance in English first-class cricket history. After taking nine for 47, Douglas stopped a breakdown against [[Bill Bestwick]] with an unbeaten 210 that tired him so much he did not bowl until the end of Derbyshire's second innings. He then took two for none, giving him a match record of eleven for 47.

Douglas captained England eighteen times, with a [[test cricket|Test match]] record of won eight, lost eight, drawn two. Successful as stand-in captain in Australia in 1911, he won the series 4–1. On the 1920/21 tour of Australia he led a depleted post-war side which suffered a 0–5 'whitewash', a scoreline not repeated in an [[The Ashes|Ashes]] series until the 2006/7 England team lost by the same margin. Reappointed reluctantly by the M.C.C. in 1921, he lost the first two Tests at home to [[Warwick Armstrong]]'s side and was displaced as captain but retained in the XI. He captained England in one further Test match, against South Africa in July 1924, and played his final Test on the 1924/25 England tour of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/334/334.html |title=Player Profile: Johnny Douglas at Cricket Archive |publisher=Cricketarchive.com |date=1930-12-19 |accessdate=2014-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
[[File:Johnny Douglas 1926.jpg|thumb|left|Douglas with his orchids at home in [[Theydon Bois]], Essex, 1926]]
Douglas married Evelyn Ruby (sister of two of his close wartime friends), the widow of Captain Thomas Elphinstone Case, of the Coldstream Guards, and daughter of Adolphus Ferguson,&lt;ref&gt;Walford's County Families of the United Kingdom, 1908, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News]]'', vol. 86, 1917, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; on 25 December 1916. He had no children but one stepson, the actor [[Gerald Case]].

He drowned when the ''Oberon'', on which he and his father were travelling, was wrecked seven miles south of the Laeso Trindel Lightship, Denmark. It had collided with a sister-vessel in foggy weather when the two captains who were brothers were attempting to exchange Christmas greetings. According to a witness at the post mortem enquiry, Douglas may well have been trying to save his father.&lt;ref name="OTD"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/149144.html |title=Chapman in charge |accessdate=6 September 2017 |work=ESPN Cricinfo}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had been purchasing timber in Finland. He was aged 48.

'''''Kraamzorg''''' is a medical service in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]] where [[postnatal care]] is provided to a new mother and her baby in the initial eight to 10 days immediately after birth.

This support comes in the form of a qualified [[maternity nurse]] or [[health care professional]], ''kraamverzorgster'', who comes to the home in order to provide care and instruction for the newborn. ''Kraamzorg'' is included in standard [[health insurance]] packages in the [http://www.expatarrivals.com/netherlands/moving-to-netherlands Netherlands]; though, depending on specific policy, a small contribution for each hour of care is expected. 

The ''kraamverzorgster's'' primary responsibility is to ensure that the mother's recovery is quick and efficient, and that the [[Infant development|baby's development]] is evolving appropriately. Tasks usually adopted by the ''kraamverzorgster'' include, but are not limited to: flagging any issues that may arise between the new mother and [[midwife]] or [[Physician|doctor]], ensuring the area in which the mother and the baby are in are clean and hygienic, ensuring that the mother is healing well after the birth, supporting the mother with feeding issues (whether this be [[Breastfeeding|breast]] or [[bottle feeding]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expatarrivals.com Expat Arrivals], [http://www.expatarrivals.com/article/having-a-baby-in-the-netherlands Having a Baby in the Netherlands], Sept 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Interaction with the ''kraamzorg'' organisation of choice begins in the thirty-fourth week of [[pregnancy]]. At this point, a chosen representative will visit the home and discuss what type of support is available depending on whether the mother is planning a [[Home birth|home]] or [[hospital]] birth.

The hours of care each mother is entitled to vary, and can even change after birth. There are three levels of care: basic, minimal, and flexible, that translate into a specific number of daily hours of service depending the mother and the family's personal situation. Factors that can affect which level of care a mother is entitled to include: number of children already in the family, an unstable home situation, problems with breastfeeding, and [[illness]] in the family.

The ''kraamzorg'' organisation provides a list of items that should be in the home in order to prepare for the arrival of the child, and the company issues a file where mothers can track the day-to-day progress of their babies, as well as their own recovery. 

Families and mothers are encouraged to ask as many questions as possible in preparation for their first meeting with a representative from the ''kraamzorg'' organisation.

A similar service, Kraamzorg UK, was launched in Manchester in 2013. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A new approach to post-natal care: Mothers' helpers|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/a-new-approach-to-post-natal-care-mothers-helpers-8962986.html|accessdate=7 November 2016|publisher=Independent|date=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;n= {\tfrac{1}{4\pi}}\int\mathbf{M}\cdot\left(\frac{\partial \mathbf{M}}{\partial x}\times\frac{\partial \mathbf{M}}{\partial y}\right)dx dy&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the topological index, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M}&lt;/math&gt; is the unit vector in the direction of the local magnetization within the magnetic thin, ultra-thin or bulk film, and the integral is taken over a two dimensional space.  (A generalization to a three-dimensional space is possible).{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}.
Passing to spherical coordinates for the space ( &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}=(r \cos \alpha, r \sin\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;) and for the magnetisation ( &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{m}= (m \cos \phi \sin \theta, m \sin \phi \sin \theta, m \cos \theta )   &lt;/math&gt;), one can understand the meaning of the skyrmion number. In skyrmion configurations the spatial dependence of the magnetisation can be simplified by setting the perpendicular magnetic variable independent on the in-plane ones (&lt;math&gt;\theta(r)&lt;/math&gt;)  and the in-plane magnetic variable independent on the radius ( &lt;math&gt;\phi(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;).
Then the topological skyrmion number reads:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; n = \frac{1}{4 \pi} \iint \frac{d \theta}{dr} \frac{d \phi}{d \alpha} \sin \theta d\alpha dr = \frac{1}{4 \pi} \left[  \cos \theta \right]^{\theta(r=0)}_{\theta(r= \infty)} \left[ \phi \right]^{\phi_i}_{\phi_f} = p \cdot W &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

where p describes the magnetisation direction in the origin (p=1 (-1) for &lt;math&gt;\theta(r=0) = \pi (0)&lt;/math&gt;) and W is the winding number.
Considering the same uniform magnetisation, i.e. the same \textit{p} value, the winding number allows to define the skyrmion (&lt;math&gt;\phi(\alpha) \propto \alpha &lt;/math&gt;) with a positive winding number and the [[antiskyrmion (physics)|antiskyrmion]]  &lt;math&gt;(\phi(\alpha) \propto - \alpha )&lt;/math&gt; with a negative winding number and thus a topological charge opposite to the one of the skyrmion.

What this equation describes physically is a configuration in which the [[Spin (physics)|spins]] in a magnetic film are all aligned orthonormal to the plane of the film, with the exception of those in one, specific region, where the spins progressively turn over to an orientation that is perpendicular to the plane of the film but ''anti-parallel'' to those in the rest of the plane. Assuming 2D isotropy, the free energy of such a configuration is minimized by relaxation towards a state exhibiting circular symmetry, resulting in the configuration illustrated schematically (for a two dimensional skyrmion) in figure 1.  In one dimension, the distinction between the progression of magnetization in a 'skyrmionic' pair of domain walls, and the progression of magnetization in a topologically trivial pair of magnetic domain walls, is illustrated in figure 2.  Considering this one dimensional case is equivalent to considering a horizontal cut across the diameter of a 2-dimensional hedgehog skyrmion (fig. 1(a)) and looking at the progression of the local spin orientations.
[[File:Magnetic skyrmion in 1D.pdf|thumb|386x386px|Fig. 2 Comparison of a pair of magnetic domain walls with constant angular progression (1D skyrmion), and a pair of magnetic domain walls with two opposite angular progressions (topologically trivial).]]

It is worth observing that there are two different configurations which satisfy the topological index criterion stated above. The distinction between these can be made clear by considering a horizontal cut across both of the skyrmions illustrated in figure 1, and looking at the progression of the local spin orientations.  In the case of fig. 1(a) the progression of magnetization across the diameter is cycloidal.  This type of skyrmion is known as a 'hedgehog skyrmion.'  In the case of fig. 1(b), the progression of magnetization is helical, giving rise to what is often called a 'vortex skyrmion.'

==Explanation of Stability==
The skyrmion magnetic configuration is predicted to be stable because the atomic spins which are oriented opposite those of the surrounding thin-film cannot ‘flip around’ to align themselves with the rest of the atoms in the film, without overcoming an energy barrier.  This energy barrier is often ambiguously described as arising from '''‘topological protection.’'''  (See '''Topological Stability vs. Energy Stability''').

Depending on the magnetic interactions existing in a given system, the skyrmion topology can be a stable, meta-stable, or unstable solution when one minimizes the system's free energy.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Theoretical solutions exist for both isolated skyrmions and skyrmion lattices.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} However, since the stability and behavioral attributes of skyrmions can vary significantly based on the type of interactions in a system, the word 'skyrmion' can refer to substantially different magnetic objects.  For this reason, some physicists choose to reserve use of the term 'skyrmion' to describe magnetic objects with a specific set of stability properties, and arising from a specific set of magnetic interactions.

==Multiple Definitions of Magnetic Skyrmions==

In general, definitions of magnetic skyrmions fall into 2 categories.  Which category one chooses to refer to depends largely on the emphasis one wishes to place on different qualities.  A first category is based strictly on [[topology]].  This definition may seem appropriate when considering topology-dependent properties of magnetic objects, such as their dynamical behavior.&lt;ref name=Sondhi1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brey1&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second category emphasizes the ''intrinsic energy stability'' of certain solitonic magnetic objects.  In this case, the energy stability is often (but not necessarily) associated with a form of [[Chirality|chiral]] interaction, which might originate from the [[Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction]] (DMI),&lt;ref name=Heinze1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kiselev1&gt;{{cite journal

#When expressed mathematically, definitions in the first category state that magnetic spin-textures with a spin-progression satisfying the condition:&lt;math&gt;{\tfrac{1}{4\pi}}\int\mathbf{M}\cdot\left(\frac{\partial \mathbf{M}}{\partial x}\times\frac{\partial \mathbf{M}}{\partial y}\right)dx dy = {n}&lt;/math&gt;  where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is an integer ≥1, can be qualified as magnetic skyrmions.
#Definitions in the second category similarly stipulate that a magnetic skyrmion exhibits a spin-texture with a spin-progression satisfying the condition:&lt;math&gt;{\tfrac{1}{4\pi}}\int\mathbf{M}\cdot\left(\frac{\partial \mathbf{M}}{\partial x}\times\frac{\partial \mathbf{M}}{\partial y}\right)dx dy = {n}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is an integer ≥1, but ''further'' suggest that there must exist an energy term that stabilizes the spin-structure into a localized magnetic [[soliton]] whose energy is invariant by translation of the soliton's position in space.  (The spatial energy invariance condition constitutes a way to rule out structures stabilized by locally-acting factors external to the system, such as confinement arising from the geometry of a specific nanostructure).{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}
The first set of definitions for magnetic skyrmions is a [[Subset|superset]] of the second, in that it places less stringent requirements on the properties of a magnetic spin texture.  This definition finds a raison d'être because topology itself determines some properties of magnetic spin textures, such as their dynamical responses to excitations.

The second category of definitions may be preferred to underscore intrinsic stability qualities of some &lt;math&gt;n\geq 1 &lt;/math&gt; magnetic configurations.  These qualities arise from stabilizing interactions which may be described in several mathematical ways, including for example by using higher-order '''spatial''' derivative terms&lt;ref name=Rossler1/&gt; such as 2nd or 4th order terms to describe a field, (the mechanism originally proposed in particle physics by Tony Skyrme for a continuous field model),&lt;ref name=Skyrme1&gt;{{cite journal

In all cases the energy term acts to introduce topologically non-trivial solutions to a system of '''partial''' differential equations.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}  In other words, the energy term acts to render possible the existence of a topologically non-trivial magnetic configuration that is confined to a finite, localized region, and possesses an intrinsic stability or meta-stability relative to a trivial homogeneously magnetized ground-state — i.e. a magnetic '''soliton'''.  An example hamiltonian containing one set of energy terms that allows for the existence of skyrmions of the second category is the following:&lt;ref name=Iwasaki1/&gt;
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;H = -J\sum_{\mathbf{r}}\mathbf{M_{r}}\cdot\left(\mathbf{M_{r+e_{x}}}+\mathbf{M_{r+e_{y}}}\right)

-\mathbf{B}\cdot \sum_{\mathbf{r}}\mathbf{M_{r}}
-A\sum_{\mathbf{rI}} M_{z\mathbf{r}}^2
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}
where the first, second, third and fourth sums correspond to the [[Exchange interaction|exchange]], [[Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction|Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya]], Zeeman (responsible for the "usual" torques and forces observed on a magnetic dipole moment in a [[magnetic field]]), and [[Magnetic anisotropy|magnetic Anisotropy]] (typically [[magnetocrystalline anisotropy]]) interaction energies respectively.  Note that equation (2) does not contain a term for the dipolar, or 'demagnetizing' interaction between atoms.  As in eq. (2), the dipolar interaction is sometimes omitted in simulations of ultra-thin '2 dimensional' magnetic films, because it tends to contribute a minor effect in comparison with the others.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;!--It has been omitted in the above hamiltonian.--&gt;

==The Role of Topology==

===Topological Stability vs. Energetic Stability===
A non-trivial topology does not in itself imply energetic stability.  There is in fact no necessary relation between topology and energetic stability.  Hence, one must be careful not to confuse ‘topological stability,’ which is a mathematical concept,{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} with energy stability in real physical systems.  Topological stability refers to the idea that in order for a system described by a continuous field to transition from one topological state to another, a rupture must occur in the continuous field, i.e. a discontinuity must be produced.  For example, if one wishes to transform a flexible balloon doughnut (torus) into an ordinary spherical balloon, it is necessary to introduce a rupture on some part of the balloon doughnut's surface.  Mathematically, the balloon doughnut would be described as 'topologically stable.'  However, in physics, the free energy required to introduce a rupture enabling the transition of a system from one ‘topological’ state to another is always ''finite''.  For example, it is possible to turn a rubber ballon into flat piece of rubber by poking it with a needle (and popping it!).  Thus, while a physical system can be ''approximately'' described using the mathematical concept of topology, attributes such as ''energetic'' stability are dependent on the system's parameters—the strength of the rubber in the example above—not the topology per se.  In order to draw a meaningful parallel between the concept of topological stability and the energy stability of a system, the analogy must necessarily be accompanied by the introduction of a non-zero phenomenological ‘field rigidity’ to account for the finite energy needed to rupture the field’s topology.  Modeling and then integrating this field rigidity can be likened to calculating a breakdown energy-density of the field.  These considerations suggest that what is often referred to as ‘topological protection,’ or a 'topological barrier,' should more accurately be referred to as a 'topology-related energy barrier,' though this terminology is somewhat cumbersome. A quantitative evaluation of such a topological barrier can be obtained by extracting the critical magnetic configuration when the topological number changes during the dynamical process of a skyrmion creation event. Applying the topological charge defined in a lattice,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berg|first=B.|last2=Lüscher|first2=M.|date=1981-08-24|title=Definition and statistical distributions of a topological number in the lattice O(3) σ-model|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/055032138190568X|journal=Nuclear Physics B|volume=190|issue=2|pages=412–424|doi=10.1016/0550-3213(81)90568-X|bibcode=1981NuPhB.190..412B}}&lt;/ref&gt; the barrier height is theoretically shown to be proportional to the exchange stiffness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yin|first=Gen|date=2016-01-01|title=Topological charge analysis of ultrafast single skyrmion creation|url=http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.93.174403|journal=Physical Review B|volume=93|issue=17|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.93.174403|bibcode=2016PhRvB..93q4403Y|arxiv=1411.7762}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further Observations===
It is important to be cognizant of the fact that magnetic &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; =1 structures are in fact not stabilized by virtue of their ‘topology,’ but rather by the field rigidity parameters that characterize a given system.  However, this does not suggest that topology plays an insignificant role with respect to energetic stability.  On the contrary, topology may create the ''possibility'' for certain stable magnetic states to exist, which otherwise could not.  However, topology in itself does not ''guarantee'' the stability of a state.  In order for a state to have stability associated with its topology, it must be further accompanied by a non-zero field rigidity.  Thus, topology can be considered a necessary but insufficient condition for the existence of certain classes of stable objects.  While this distinction may at first seem pedantic, its physical motivation becomes apparent when considering two magnetic spin configurations of identical topology &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; =1, but subject to the influences of only one differing magnetic interaction.  For example, we may consider one spin configuration with, and one configuration without the presence of magnetocrystalline anisotropy, "M.A.," oriented perpendicular to the plane of an ultra-thin magnetic film.  '''In this case, the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; =1 configuration that is influenced by the M.A. will be more energetically stable than the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; =1 configuration without it,''' in spite of identical topologies.  This is because the M.A. contributes to the field rigidity, and it is the field rigidity, not the topology, that confers the notable energy barrier protecting the topological state.

Finally, it is interesting to observe that in some cases, it is not the topology which helps &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; =1 configurations to be stable, but rather the converse, as it is ''the stability of the field'' (which depends on the relevant interactions) which favors the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; =1 topology.  This is to say that the most stable energy configuration of the field constituents, (in this case magnetic atoms), may in fact be to arrange into a topology which can be described as an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; =1 topology.  Such is the case for magnetic skyrmions stabilized by the D.M. interaction, which causes adjacent magnetic spins to 'prefer' having a fixed angle between each other (energetically speaking).  Note that from a point of view of practical applications this does not alter the usefulness of developing systems with D.M.I., as such applications depend strictly on the topology [of the skyrmions, or lack thereof], which encodes the information, and not the underlying mechanisms which stabilize the necessary topology.

These examples illustrate why use of the terms 'topological protection' or 'topological stability' interchangeably with the concept of energy stability is misleading, and is liable to lead to fundamental confusion.

===Limitations of Applying the Concept of Topology===
One must exercise caution when making inferences based on topology-related energy barriers, as it can be misleading to apply the notion of topology—a description which only rigorously applies to ''continuous'' fields— to infer the energetic stability of structures existing in ''discontinuous'' systems.  Giving way to this temptation is sometimes problematic in physics, where fields which are approximated as continuous become discontinuous below certain size-scales.  Such is the case for example when the concept of topology is associated with the [[Micromagnetics|micromagnetic model]]—which assimilates the magnetic texture of a system to a continuous field—and then applied indiscriminately without consideration of the model's physical limitations (i.e. that it ceases to be valid at atomic dimensions).  In practice, treating the spin textures of magnetic materials as vectors of a continuous field model becomes inaccurate at size-scales on the order of &lt; 2&amp;nbsp;nm, due to the discretization of the atomic lattice.  Thus, it is not meaningful to speak of magnetic skyrmions below these size-scales.

Magnetic skyrmions are anticipated to allow for the existence of discrete magnetic states which are significantly more energetically stable (per unit volume) than their single-domain counterparts.  For this reason, it is envisioned that magnetic skyrmions may be used as bits to store information in future memory and logic devices, where the state of the bit is encoded by the existence or non-existence of the magnetic skyrmion. The dynamical magnetic skyrmion exhibits strong breathing which opens the avenue for skyrmion-based microwave applications.&lt;ref name=yanzhou2015NC&gt;{{cite journal

'''''Making Europe Unconquerable''''' is a book about how [[civilian-based defense]] can be incorporated into the foundations of European defense and collective security. Written by [[Gene Sharp]], the book was originally published in the United Kingdom and United States in 1985. Its subtitle was ''the potential of civilian-based deterrence and defense''. The book was reviewed in major newspapers,&lt;ref name=kennan86/&gt;&lt;ref name=meyer86/&gt; magazines,&lt;ref name=taylor87/&gt; and professional journals.&lt;ref name=pierre86/&gt;&lt;ref name=harbottle8687/&gt;&lt;ref name=thee86/&gt; Although it advocated a significant departure from existing defense policies, it received a favorable review from [[George F. Kennan]], widely perceived as one of the major architects of the US approach to the [[cold war]]. Later in the same year, the book was republished with a foreword from [[George F. Kennan|Kennan]]. It has also been published in Dutch and Italian editions.

==Topics covered==
In its opening pages, ''Making Europe Unconquerable'' states that 
{{Quote | This book is mostly about... ‘[[Civilian-based defense|civilian-based defence]]’... In this policy, the whole population and the society's institutions become the fighting forces.  Their weaponry consists of a vast variety of forms of psychological, economic, social, and political resistance and counter-attack...  to deny the attackers their objectives and to make consolidation of political control impossible. These aims would be achieved by applying massive  and selective noncooperation and defiance [and seeking] to create maximum international problems for the attackers and to subvert the reliability of their troops and functionaires. | pp.&amp;nbsp;2–3}}
''Making Europe Unconquerable'' contains 7 chapters entitled
# Meeting Europe's defense needs
# [[Civilian-based defense]] for Western Europe?
# [[Transarmament]]
# Preventing attack
# In face of attack
# Defeating attack
# Assessing the potential
The book also contains a bibliography (12 pages) and an index (24 pages).

{{Gene Sharp}}In the ''[[New York Review of Books]]'', [[George F. Kennan]], widely viewed as a major architect of the US approach to the [[cold war]], wrote that Sharp's "primary purpose in writing the book was... 'to make civilian-based deterrence and defense a thinkable policy which is recognized as meriting further research, policy studies, and an evaluation.' And for this, he makes a reasonably good case."&lt;ref name= kennan86 /&gt; Kennan stated that "the view advanced in this book deserves consideration, if only because of the bankruptcy of all the visible alternatives to it." Kennan viewed Sharp's approach as requiring
{{Quote | a change in political philosophy. For it taps, as Mr. Sharp says in his final passages, ‘a crucial insight into the nature of power’—namely, that ‘all political power is rooted in and continually dependent upon the co-operation and obedience of the subjects and institutions of the society…. It is indeed possible for whole societies to apply that insight’&lt;ref name=kennan86 /&gt;}}
Kennan wondered "whether, if this change in political philosophy were to take place, it might not have wider effects than just those that relate to the concepts of national security—whether many other things might not also change, and, in the main, usefully so,"&lt;ref name=kennan86/&gt; and advised that Sharp
{{Quote | must not expect... that the effort to win understanding for his views will be easy going...  It will arouse in many circles the same skepticism, and perhaps the same derision, that this reviewer brought down upon himself when he had the temerity to advance somewhat similar ideas in a widely publicized radio lecture delivered over the facilities of the BBC many years ago.&lt;ref name=kennan86/&gt;}}

In the ''New York Times'', [[Karl E. Meyer]] described the book as "reflective," and stated that  "there is considerable merit to &lt;nowiki&gt;[Sharp's]&lt;/nowiki&gt; contention that 'all peoples can with effort make themselves politically indigestable to would-be tyrants.'"&lt;ref name= meyer86/&gt; Meyer also argued that Sharp's approach "has its flaws...  If the stakes are deemed sufficiently vital, civilian resistance seems unlikely to dissuade a determined aggressor."&lt;ref name= meyer86 /&gt;

In ''Foreign Affairs'', Andrew Pierre wrote that 
{{Quote | The value of this thoughtful work is in the alternative it suggests: ‘civilian defense’ through advance training for such actions against an intruder as mass public demonstrations, boycotts and strikes, demoralization of enemy troops, and the like. | pp. 872–73&lt;ref name= pierre86 /&gt;}}
He added that "The author's proposals go against the grain of mainstream thinking, and to this reviewer leave many questions unanswered, but they are carefully put forward in a nonpolemical manner and clearly merit sustained attention and thought" (p.&amp;nbsp;873&lt;ref name=pierre86 /&gt;).

''[[Ted Taylor (physicist)|Ted Taylor]]'', himself a former designer of nuclear weapons, reviewed the book in the ''[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]]''. He quoted Einstein:
{{Quote | ‘The unleashed power of the atom has changed everything save our modes of thinking, and we thus drift toward unparalleled catastrophe.’  Although Albert Einstein's admonition has been quoted innumerable times, it has not, with few exceptions, led to deep and persistent thought about alternatives...  One of these exceptions is in the writings of Gene Sharp about what he calls ‘civilian-based defense’...  Making Europe Unconquerable is especially timely. (p.&amp;nbsp;54&lt;ref name= taylor87 /&gt;}}
He added that "The side effects of pursuing a civilian-based defense strategy are especially interesting, since they tend to be beneficial in peacetime. This is a book that should be read attentively by anyone seriously searching for new ways of thinking about how we can stop our "drift toward unparalleled catastrophe." (p.&amp;nbsp;56&lt;ref name= taylor87 /&gt;).

[[Beatification|Blessed]] '''María Vicenta Rosal Vásquez''' (26 October 1815 - 24 August 1886) - in religious '''María de la Encarnación del Corazón de Jesús''') was a [[Guatemalan people|Guatemalan]] [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Nun|professed religious]] and a professed member from the Bethlemite Sisters.&lt;ref name=BS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bethlemitas.org.co/beata-madre-maria-encarnacion-rosal-english/|title=Blessed Mother Maria Encarnacion Rosal|date=|publisher=Bethlemite Sisters|accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosal was an advocate of women's education and protection which proved to be a cause that was significant in view of the [[machismo]] culture that was pervasive in the region at the time.&lt;ref name=EWTN&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/bios97.htm#encarnacion|title=Biographies of New Blesseds - 1997|date=|publisher=EWTN|accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SEB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/91184|title=Blessed Maria Encarnacion Rosal|date=|publisher=Santi e Beati|accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her beatification was celebrated in [[Rome]] in mid-1997; she is the first female Guatemalan to be beatified.

==Life==
María Vicenta Rosal Vásquez was born on 26 October 1820 in [[Quetzaltenango]] to Manuel Encarnación Rosal (25 March 1791 - 30 May 1851) and Leocadia Gertrudis Benitez Vásquez (December 9 1782 - 13 March 1846).&lt;ref name=BS/&gt; Her mother was married with three children before being widowed in 1816 and later becoming a wife once more this time to Rosal on 18 November 1822. Her elder sister was Ana de la Soledad and an older brother was Isidro. Rosal was [[baptized]] on 27 October 1820 in her local parish of Espíritu Santo and she later received her [[Confirmation (sacrament)|Confirmation]] on 23 January 1840 in that same church.&lt;ref name=EWTN/&gt;

Youth saw her attending galas and she did demonstrate vain tendencies on occasion which would cause her to receive reprimands from her elder sister Ana de la Soledad. Rosal was reminded that she had to fulfil her baptismal promises and Rosal accepted this and clarified she would change upon turning 20.&lt;ref name=BS/&gt; Rosal soon befriended the Honduran girl Manuela Arbizú and the two spoke of the religious life as well as the Bethlemite Sisters whom her new friend had mentioned. The mentioning of this religious order piqued her interest and she soon dove into learning about them; she consulted with her parents and her confessor and soon decided to go to the convent to become a member of that order.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;

On 11 December 1837 she departed her home for the [[convent]] alongside her father and her brother Isidro as well as her friend Manuela and before entering the order visited the Santa Catalina and Santa Teresa monasteries as well as that of a [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] convent; her father did not like the excessive stops and wanted his daughter to be more decisive as to where to go.&lt;ref name=BS/&gt; Rosal entered the Bethlemite Sisters on 1 January 1838 and assumed the new religious name of "María de la Encarnación del Corazón de Jesús" and she later made her vows on 26 January 1840. She received the habit on 16 July 1838 from the last Bethlemite priest Martín de San José. Her first confessor was Father Urbano Ugarte who had supported her entrance into the religious life.&lt;ref name=BS/&gt; Rosal was frustrated with the religious standards the Bethlemites lived with but despite her frustration was appointed as the [[Prior|prioress]] of her convent in 1855. In that role she attempted to restore dedication to the original religious standards of her order and the resulting rancor with established members of her order caused her to found a new convent of the Bethlemite Sisters in Quetzeltenango in 1851. Her second confessor around this stage was the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priest Ignacio Taboada.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;

Rosal's progress at reform in Quetzeltenango was interrupted when [[Justo Rufino Barrios]] became the nation's [[President of Guatemala|president]] and began expelling members of religious orders. Rosal was exiled from Guatemala as a result of this and in 1877 founded the first school for women in [[Cartago Province|Carthage]] in [[Costa Rica]] and also at [[Heredia, Costa Rica|Heredia]] not to far from there. But religious persecution spread to Costa Rica in due course and Rosal fled to [[Colombia]] where she established an orphanage and a refuge for women in [[Pasto]]. Rosal settled for one final time this time in [[Ecuador]] where she established convents for the Bethlemite Sisters in [[Tulcán]] and in [[Otavalo (city)|Otavalo]]. Rosal busied herself with the revision of the constitutions and the planning of new convents as well as her determination to better organize it and direct their efforts to its charism and work.&lt;ref name=EWTN/&gt;

Rosal died on 24 August 1886 at 5:00am in Ecuador due to an accident horseback riding as she travelled between religious institutions. The nun decided to go on a trip with other nuns for their work and the accident then occurred not long after resulting in her death from her sustained injuries. Her remains are interred in Pasto and are [[Incorruptibility|incorrupt]].&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;

==Beatification==
The beatification process commenced in Pasto in an informative process that spanned from 14 March 1951 until its closure in 1952; there were fourteen witnesses all up that were interviewed with eight of those people having known her. Eight members of the faithful were interviewed as were five Bethlemite nuns and one diocesan priest. Her writings received full approval from theologians on 18 April 1955 after it was confirmed her spiritual writings were all in line with official doctrine. The formal introduction to the cause on 5 April 1976 under [[Pope Paul VI]] and she became titled as a [[Servant of God]]. The [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] validated the informative process on 3 July 1992 in [[Rome]] and later received the [[Positio]] from the postulation in 1993. Historians approved the cause's direction on 9 March 1993 while theologians approved the cause on 11 November 1994 as did the C.C.S. on 7 February 1995. [[Pope John Paul II]] confirmed that Rosal lived a life of model [[heroic virtue]] and thus named her as [[Venerable]] on 6 April 1995.

The miracle for beatification was investigated and then received C.C.S. validation on 10 June 1994 before a board of medical experts approved it on 11 January 1996. The theologians also approved this on 16 April 1996 as did the C.C.S. on 2 July 1996 before John Paul II issued his final approval to this miracle on 17 December 1996 - the miracle in question was a 1975 healing from Colombia. John Paul II beatified Rosal on 4 May 1997 in [[Saint Peter's Square]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5082">A '''maternity hospital''' specializes in caring for women during [[pregnancy]] and [[childbirth]]. It also provides care for newborn [[infant]]s, and may act as a centre for clinical training in [[midwifery]] and [[obstetrics]]. Formerly known as [[lying-in]] hospitals, most of them, like [[cottage hospital]]s, have been absorbed into larger [[general hospital]]s, where they operate as the maternity department.

==History==
[[File:General Lying-in Hospital ES.jpg|thumb|The premises of the former [[General Lying-In Hospital]], now a hotel]]
Maternity hospitals in the United Kingdom can be traced back to a number of 18th century establishments in London and Dublin. Prior to these foundations, childbirth was a domestic occasion. The term coined for these establishments, but now [[archaism|archaic]], is "a lying-in hospital", referring to the custom of [[lying-in]], prolonged [[bedrest]] after childbirth, better known now as [[postpartum confinement]].

The first noted lying-in hospital appears to be one founded by Sir [[Richard Manningham]] in [[Jermyn Street]], London, in 1739 and which evolved into the [[Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital|Queen Charlotte's Maternity Hospital]]. A better documented foundation is that of the [[Rotunda Hospital|Dublin Lying-In Hospital]], established in 1745 by [[Bartholomew Mosse]], and which served as a model for three subsequent London foundations: the [[British Lying-In Hospital]], a 1749 establishment in [[Holborn]]; the 1750 [[City of London Maternity Hospital|City of London Lying-In Hospital]], in [[City of London|the City]]; and the [[General Lying-In Hospital]] on [[Westminster Bridge Road]], established in 1767.&lt;ref name="AIM25"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cgi-bin/vcdf/detail?coll_id=11905&amp;inst_id=118|website=AIM25 - Archives in London and the M25 area|title=Queen Charlotte's Maternity Hospital|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LMA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Information Leaflet Number 35 Records of patients in London hospitals|website=London Metropolitan Archives|publisher=City of London|accessdate=3 September 2016|url=http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/things-to-do/london-metropolitan-archives/visitor-information/Documents/35-records-of-patients-in-london-hospitals.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ryan"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/historyofqueench00ryan |title=The history of Queen Charlotte's Lying-in Hospital |first=Thomas |last=Ryan |date=1885|pages=ix-xv}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other such hospitals were formed in the mid-18th century. All of these were run by male physicians, women being blocked from completing training as doctors until the 1870s. 

The first maternity hospital founded and run by a woman was [[Elizabeth Garrett Anderson]]'s [[New Hospital for Women]], which evolved from an existing dispensary in the 1770s, and was renamed in 1918 the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital.&lt;ref name="UCLH"&gt;[http://www.uclh.nhs.uk/our+hospitals/university+college+hospital+elizabeth+garrett+anderson+wing.htm UCLH - Our hospitals - University College Hospital Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Wing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411051037/http://www.uclh.nhs.uk/Our+hospitals/University+College+Hospital+Elizabeth+Garrett+Anderson+Wing.htm |date=2009-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | accessdate=2007-10-28 | title='Run by Women, (mainly) for Women': Medical Women's Hospitals in Britain, 1866-1948 | url=http://docserver.ingentaconnect.com/deliver/connect/rodopi/00457183/v61n1/s7.pdf?expires=1193614133&amp;id=40280224&amp;titleid=484&amp;accname=Guest+User&amp;checksum=52F76CF81F43E1C0AF4A8643DEEC9AEB | last=Elston | first=Mary Ann | format=pdf | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120707212420/http://docserver.ingentaconnect.com/deliver/connect/rodopi/00457183/v61n1/s7.pdf?expires=1193614133&amp;id=40280224&amp;titleid=484&amp;accname=Guest+User&amp;checksum=52F76CF81F43E1C0AF4A8643DEEC9AEB | archivedate=2012-07-07 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/rodopi/clio/2001/00000061/00000001/art00007 | title = 'Run by Women, (mainly) for Women': Medical Women's Hospitals in Britain, 1866-1948 | publisher = [[Rodopi Publishers|Rodopi]] | accessdate = 2008-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A3197216 | title = Elizabeth Garrett Anderson - Victorian Women's Campaigner | publisher = [[BBC]] |date=December 2004 | accessdate = 2007-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its work continues in the modern Elizabeth Garrett Anderson maternity wing of [[University College Hospital]], part of UCLH NHS Foundation Trust.

'''Sydney Max Falstein''' (30 May 1914 &amp;ndash; 18 May 1967) was an [[Australia]]n politician.

==Early life==

Falstein was born on 30 May 1914 at [[Coffs Harbour]] to Russian grazier Abram Max Falstein and German-born Rosa, née Goldman. He attended [[Sydney Boys' High School|Sydney Boys' High]] (1926–27)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shsobu.org.au/wp-content/uploads/mps.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sydney Grammar School|Sydney Grammar]] schools, and later studied for a [[Bachelor of Arts]] and a law degree at the [[University of Sydney]]. On 13 March 1937 he married nurse Ila Brenda Greig at [[Darlinghurst, New South Wales|Darlinghurst]], and was thus estranged from his [[Jew]]ish mother. He spent several years in [[New Zealand]] before returning to Australia; he was admitted to the New South Wales Bar in 1940.

==Federal politics==

Falstein was first involved in politics in New Zealand, where he was an organiser for the [[New Zealand Labour Party]]. In Australia, he was elected to the [[Australian House of Representatives]] in 1940 for the seat of [[Division of Watson (1934-69)|Watson]], representing the [[Australian Labor Party]]. In parliament he became associated with [[Arthur Calwell]] and others who opposed [[John Curtin]]'s leadership. After Curtin became [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]], Falstein openly clashed with him over issues concerning the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] in 1944.

Falstein had enlisted in the RAAF on 18 July 1942; he was convicted of using insubordinate language to a superior in September of that year and was sentenced to twenty-eight days detention. He qualified as a pilot and completed an operational tour from 1944 to 1945 in the south-west [[Pacific]].

After the war Falstein became involved in business. He was convicted of falsifying documents to understate imported wristwatches' value in 1948 and fined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/182110614|newspaper=Glen Innes Examiner|location=NSW|title=Falstein charged with Customs breaches|date=21 July 1948|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/205684528|title=M.P. Fined in Customs Case|date=25 September 1948|page=3|newspaper=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the ALP did not endorse him for Watson in the [[Australian federal election, 1949|1949 election]]. He contested the seat unsuccessfully as an [[independent (politician)|independent]] and was expelled from the Labor Party. His only further political acts were to support Menzies' [[Communist Party of Australia|Communist Party]] dissolution attempt; a marked anti-[[communist]], he had nevertheless supported the recognition of [[People's Republic of China|Communist China]].

==Later life==

Falstein was declared bankrupt on 12 August 1958; his appeals to the courts failed. He returned to the bar in 1961. In his final years he suffered from [[hypertension]] and [[diabetes]], and he died on 18 May 1967 of [[cerebral thrombosis]] at [[Concord, New South Wales|Concord]]. He was survived by his wife, a daughter, and three of his four sons.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3482">'''Mieszko Bolesławowic''' (c. 1069–1089) was the only son of [[Bolesław II the Generous]], [[King of Poland]]. Mieszko was [[Prince of Cracow]] from 1086 until his death in 1089.

== Biography ==
Mieszko was, in all likelihood, born in Cracow sometime around or during A.D. 1069. He was the eldest son of the king of Poland [[Bolesław II the Bold]] and his wife Wyszeslawa. According to the Chronicler [[Gallus Anonymus]], Mieszko was being groomed for the responsibilities of a monarch from an early age. At the age of ten, his father, Bolesław, was deposed by a rebellion led by his brother, [[Władysław I Herman]]. Mieszko was forced to leave his country and his education behind and seek refuge at the friendly court of [[Ladislaus I of Hungary]]. The king of Hungary was apparently very fond of young Mieszko and treated him like a son.&lt;ref&gt;Gallus Anonymus – ''“Cronicae et gesta ducum sive principum Polonorum”'' (c.1115)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Return to Poland ==
Following the death of his father in 1081, Mieszko remained in Hungary until 1086 when he is known to have returned to his homeland. There are two conflicting versions explaining the circumstances of this return. Chronicler Gallus Anonymus simply states that Mieszko was peacefully summoned to Poland by his uncle [[Władysław I Herman]]. It is likely that this was facilitated by a deal between Ladislaus I of Hungary and Władysław I Herman. Another version, publicized by a Hungarian chronicler, claims that in 1086 Ladislaus I of Hungary invaded the Kingdom of [[Poland]], took control of [[Cracow]], and installed Mieszko as its ruler.&lt;ref&gt;Mark of Kalt - ''"Chronicon pictum, Marci de Kalt, Chronica de gestis Hungarorum"'' (c.1360)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prince of Cracow ==
Though there is no direct primary source evidence for this, notes in Cracow almanacs strongly suggest that during the years 1086 - 1089 Mieszko was [[prince]] of [[Cracow]]. However, sometime during this time he accepted over-lordship of his uncle Wladyslaw I Herman, and gave up his hereditary claim to the crown of Poland in exchange for becoming first in line to succeed him. It is also during this time (1088) that he married a [[Principality of Turov and Pinsk|Turov]] princess (from [[Kievan Rus|Ruthenia]])&lt;ref&gt;Oswald Balzer - ''"Genealogy of the Piasts"'' Avalon, (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Euphraxia of Turov, a daughter of [[Iziaslav I of Kiev|Izyaslav I]] and [[Gertrude of Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Marek |first=Miroslav |url=http://genealogy.euweb.cz/piast/piast1.html#PM |title= Piast genealogy |publisher= Genealogy.EU}}{{Self-published source|date=August 2012}}{{Better source|date=August 2012}} {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
According to Gallus Anonymus the young prince was poisoned during a feast on orders of palatine [[Sieciech]] (who as [[Gallus Anonymus]] wrote wanted to "kill off the entire Piast dynasty") in Cracow in 1089.&lt;ref&gt;Lech Bielski, Mariusz Traba – ''“Poczet Krolow i Ksiazat Polskich”'' Park, Bielsko-Biala (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The death of Mieszko, the rightful pretender to the throne, allowed Władysław to strengthen his rule over Poland; Sieciech, after failed attempts to kill all of Władysław's sons, would be exiled.

{{nihilism}}
'''Moral nihilism''' (also known as '''ethical nihilism''', '''amoralism''' or the '''error theory''') is the [[meta-ethics|meta-ethical]] view that nothing is morally right or wrong.

Moral nihilism is distinct from [[moral relativism]], which allows for actions wrong relative to a particular culture or individual. It is also distinct from [[expressivism]], according to which when we make moral claims, "We are not making an effort to describe the way the world is [...] we are venting our emotions, commanding others to act in certain ways, or revealing a plan of action.".&lt;ref name="ethics"&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=The Fundamentals of Ethics|last=Shafer-Landau|first=Russ|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-19-532086-2|location=|pages=|doi=|id=|quote=|authorlink=|coauthors=}} p.&amp;nbsp;292–293.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nihilism does not imply that we should give up using moral or ethical language; some nihilists contend that it remains a useful tool.

==Forms of nihilism==
Moral nihilists agree that all claims such as 'murder is morally wrong' are false. But different nihilistic views differ in two ways.

Some may say that such claims are neither true nor false; others say that they are all false.

Nihilists differ in the ''scope'' of their theories. Error theorists typically claim that it is only distinctively moral claims which are false; practical nihilists claim that there are no reasons for action of any kind; some nihilists extend this claim to include reasons for belief.

=== Ethical language: false versus not truth-apt ===
[[J. L. Mackie]] argues that moral assertions are only true if there are moral properties, but because there are none, all such claims are false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mackie|first1=J.L.|title=Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong|date=1977|publisher=Penguin|location=New York|isbn=0140219579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other versions of the theory claim that moral assertions are not true because they are neither true nor false. This form of moral nihilism claims that moral beliefs and assertions ''presuppose'' the existence of moral facts that do not exist. Consider, for example, the claim that [[The present King of France is bald|the present king of France is bald]]. Some argue that this claim is neither true nor false because it presupposes that there is currently a king of France, but there is not. The claim suffers from "presupposition failure". [[Richard Joyce (philosopher)|Richard Joyce]] (2001) argues for this form of moral nihilism under the name "fictionalism".

===The scope question===
Error theory is built on three principles:

# There are no moral features in this world; nothing is right or wrong.
# Therefore, no moral judgements are true; however,
# Our sincere moral judgments try, but always fail, to describe the moral features of things.

Thus, we always lapse into error when thinking in moral terms. We are trying to state the truth when we make moral judgments. But since there is no moral truth, all of our moral claims are mistaken. Hence the error. These three principles lead to the conclusion that there is no moral knowledge. Knowledge requires truth. If there is no moral truth, there can be no moral knowledge. Thus moral values are purely chimerical.&lt;ref name='ethics'/&gt;

== Arguments for nihilism==
=== Argument from queerness&lt;!--'Argument from queerness' redirects here--&gt; ===
The most prominent argument for nihilism is the '''argument from queerness'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.

[[J. L. Mackie]] argues that there are no [[Moral realism|objective ethical values]], by arguing that they would be queer (strange):&lt;blockquote&gt;"If there were objective values, then they would be entities or qualities or relations of a very strange sort, utterly different from anything else in the universe"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/24729622|title=Ethics: inventing right and wrong|last=Mackie|first=John|publisher=|year=1977|isbn=0140135588|location=London|pages=38|oclc=24729622}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;For all those who also find such entities queer (''prima facie'' implausible), there is reason to doubt the existence of objective values.

In his book ''Morality without Foundations: A Defense of Ethical Contextualism'' (1999), Mark Timmons provides a reconstruction of Mackie's views in the form of the two related [[argument]]s. These are based on the rejection of properties, facts, and relationships that do not fit within the worldview of [[philosophical naturalism]], the idea "that everything—including any particular events, facts, properties, and so on—is part of the natural physical world that science investigates" (1999, p. 12). Timmons adds, "The undeniable attraction of this outlook in [[contemporary philosophy]] no doubt stems from the rise of modern science and the belief that science is our best avenue for discovering the nature of reality" (1999, pp. 12–13).

There are several ways in which moral properties are supposedly queer:
* our ordinary moral discourse purports to refer to intrinsically prescriptive properties and facts "that would somehow motivate us or provide us with reasons for action independent of our desires and aversions"—but such properties and facts do not comport with philosophical naturalism (page 50). 
* given that objective moral properties supposedly [[Supervenience#Value properties|supervene]] upon natural properties (such as biological or psychological properties), the relation between the moral properties and the natural properties is metaphysically mysterious and does not comport with philosophical naturalism (p. 51). 
* a moral realist who countenances the existence of metaphysically queer properties, facts, and relations must also posit some special faculty by which we have knowledge of them (Timmons, p. 51). 

==== Responses and criticisms ====
[[Christine Korsgaard]] (1996) responds to Mackie by saying: 

{{cquote|Of course there are entities that meet these criteria. It's true that they are queer sorts of entities and that knowing them isn't like anything else. But that doesn't mean that they don't exist.... For it is the most familiar fact of human life that the world contains entities that can tell us what to do and make us do it. They are people, and the other animals. (''The Sources of Normativity'', p. 166)}}

Other criticisms of the argument include noting that for the very fact that such entities would have to be something fundamentally different from what we normally experience—and therefore assumably outside our sphere of experience—we cannot ''[[prima facie]]'' have reason to either doubt or affirm their existence; therefore, if one had independent grounds for supposing such things to exist (such as, for instance, a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' of the contrary) then the argument from queerness cannot give one any particular reason to think otherwise. An argument along these lines has been provided by e.g. [[Akeel Bilgrami]] (2006).

=== Argument from explanatory impotence ===
[[Gilbert Harman]] argued that we do not need to posit the existence of objective values in order to explain our 'moral observations'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/2725781|title=The nature of morality : an introduction to ethics|last=Harman|first=Gilbert|date=1977|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=9780195021431|location=New York|pages=chapter 1|oclc=2725781}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jessie Marie Davis''' (May 27, 1981 &amp;ndash; June 14, 2007)&lt;ref name="Date of Death"&gt;Robert Wang and Kelli Young, [http://www.cantonrep.com/index.php?ID=362537&amp;Category=9&amp;subCategoryID=0 "Cause of Davis death not announced"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930013159/http://www.cantonrep.com/index.php?ID=362537&amp;Category=9&amp;subCategoryID=0 |date=2007-09-30 }}, [[Canton, Ohio|Canton]] ''[[Canton Repository|Repository]]'', June 30, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; was a murdered, near-term pregnant, 26-year-old [[United States|American]] woman first reported missing from her home in [[Lake Township, Stark County, Ohio|Lake Township]], [[Stark County, Ohio|Stark County]], [[Ohio]] on June 15, 2007. The case drew an extraordinary response from the American media. On February 15, 2008, Bobby Lee Cutts Jr., the father of her 2-year-old son and unborn daughter, was convicted of the aggravated murders of Davis and their unborn child. He was sentenced to [[Life Imprisonment|life in prison]] [[History of life imprisonment#Life imprisonment without parole|without parole]] for 57 years on February 27, 2008. A high-school friend of Cutts, Myisha Lynne Ferrell, was also later charged.

==Disappearance, recovery of body, and funeral==
Davis was last seen shopping at [[Acme Fresh Market]], a local grocery store. Her mother reported her missing on June 15, 2007, when she found her 2-year-old grandson Blake home alone, with [[bleach]] spilled on the floor and furniture broken and overturned. In televised reports, Davis' mother (who had last spoken with her daughter two days earlier) reported that Blake kept stating, "Mommy broke the table" and "Mommy's in the rug".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19293920/ "Missing woman's toddler son may offer clues"], [[MSNBC]], June 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of her disappearance, Davis was a resident of [[Lake Township, Stark County, Ohio|Lake Township]] in [[Stark County, Ohio|Stark County]], Ohio.&lt;ref name="Township reference"&gt;[http://www.ohio.com/mld/beaconjournal/17413807.htm "Pregnant woman's body identified"], [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]] ''[[Akron Beacon Journal|Beacon Journal]]'', June 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

A search of the area involving "thousands of volunteers"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/06/25/davis.slaying/index.html?eref=onion "Slain woman's mom says 'nothing' in alleged killer's eyes"], [[CNN]], June 26, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; including members of [[Texas EquuSearch]], was launched. On June 23, Davis' body was recovered in a wooded area in neighboring [[Summit County, Ohio|Summit County]], in [[Metro Parks, Serving Summit County|Hampton Hills Metro Park]]—a park surrounded by, but distinct from [[Cuyahoga Valley National Park]],&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Kist, [http://www.akron.com/20070628/wsl1.ASP "Local Metro Park cast into national spotlight"], [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]] ''Leader'', June 28, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; in the vicinity of [[Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio|Cuyahoga Falls]].&lt;ref name="Township reference"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edd Pritchard, [http://www.cantonrep.com/index.php?ID=361687&amp;r=0&amp;Category=15&amp;subCategoryID=0 "Canton cop faces murder charges"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927192553/http://www.cantonrep.com/index.php?ID=361687&amp;r=0&amp;Category=15&amp;subCategoryID=0 |date=2007-09-27 }}, [[Canton, Ohio|Canton]] ''[[Canton Repository|Repository]]'', June 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cantonrep.com/index.php?ID=362168 "Medical examiner still investigating the cause of death"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927192732/http://www.cantonrep.com/index.php?ID=362168 |date=2007-09-27 }}, [[Canton, Ohio|Canton]] ''[[Canton Repository|Repository]]'', June 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first reliable website to pin down the widely reported rumor that Cutts had assisted in locating the body of Davis was that of ''[[America's Most Wanted]]'': "AMW sources have confirmed that Bobby Cutts Jr., Jessie's boyfriend and the father of her 2-year-old son Blake, led law enforcement to the body."&lt;ref name="AMW story"&gt;[http://www.amw.com/captures/brief.cfm?id=46167 "Cutts Preliminary Hearing Waived; Case Goes To Grand Jury"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706205036/http://www.amw.com/captures/brief.cfm?id=46167 |date=2007-07-06 }}, ''[[America's Most Wanted]]'', retrieved July 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funeral===
A single-casket funeral for Jessie and her daughter was held June 30 at the House of the Lord, with a subsequent interment at Greenlawn Memorial Park. The arrangements were handled by the Silva-Hostetler Funeral Home, both in the [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]] area.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Johnston, [http://www.cleveland.com/news/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/summit/118301993381420.xml&amp;coll=2 "Davis funeral scheduled for Saturday in Akron"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215101350/http://www.cleveland.com/news/plaindealer/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fsummit%2F118301993381420.xml&amp;coll=2 |date=2008-02-15 }}, ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' ([[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]), June 28, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Davis, [https://archive.is/20120910124106/http://www.starbeacon.com/local/local_story_180072340 "Ashtabula native handling funeral for Jessie Davis"], [[Ashtabula, Ohio|Ashtabula]] ''[[Star Beacon]]'' June 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Although members of the Cutts family attended, Davis' son Blake did not.

The service was also streamed online on local news stations' websites so people who could not attend could still see the service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myfoxcleveland.com/myfox/pages/Home/Detail;jsessionid=485E5ED28048B57F5AB239416D6D4081?contentId=3644918&amp;version=2&amp;locale=EN-US&amp;layoutCode=VSTY&amp;pageId=1.1.1&amp;sflg=1]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Her mother, Patricia Porter, said at the service that her daughter had been a committed God-fearing person after doing overseas missionary work, but at some point "she took a wrong turn somewhere."

Porter said her daughter realized in church a few weeks ago that she needed to reform her life.&lt;ref name="WBNS-TV"&gt;[http://www.10tv.com/?sec=news&amp;story=sites/10tv/content/pool/200707/482013630.html "Defense Wants To Keep Evidence Quiet In Pregnant Woman Slaying"], [[WBNS-TV]], July 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Arrests, arraignment, and convictions==

===Bobby Lee Cutts Jr.===
[[Image:BobbyCuttsJr.jpg|thumb|320px|Bobby Cutts Jr.]] Davis' boyfriend, Bobby Lee Cutts Jr. was arrested and charged with two counts of murder on June 23, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/06/23/missing.woman/index.html "Police: Pregnant woman's body found; cop arrested"], [[CNN]], June 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Cutts was a police officer in the [[Canton, Ohio]], Police Department, and the father of Davis' son and unborn daughter.  The Canton Police Department, which had not considered Cutts a suspect, did not participate in the arrest, which was executed by the FBI and the local Sheriffs department.

Cutts (born May 21, 1977, in Canton)&lt;ref name="Cutts Bio"&gt;[http://www.cleveland.com/news/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/news/1182674616106490.xml&amp;coll=2 "Bobby Cutts Jr."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215101332/http://www.cleveland.com/news/plaindealer/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fnews%2F1182674616106490.xml&amp;coll=2 |date=2008-02-15 }}, ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' ([[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], June 24, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; is the son of Renee Horne&lt;ref name="WBNS-TV"/&gt; and Bobby Cutts Sr. He was married to, but separated from, another woman at the time of the murder. According to Cutts, the couple had discussed a divorce.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cleveland.com/jessiedavis/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/news/118241502936950.xml&amp;coll=2 "Policeman tells Canton reporter his side of story"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829031509/http://www.cleveland.com/jessiedavis/plaindealer/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fnews%2F118241502936950.xml&amp;coll=2 |date=2007-08-29 }}, ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' ([[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]), June 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; His wife formally filed for divorce four days after his arrest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cantonrep.com/index.php?ID=362186 "Cutts' wife seeks divorce"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927192819/http://www.cantonrep.com/index.php?ID=362186 |date=2007-09-27 }}, [[Canton, Ohio|Canton]] ''[[Canton Repository|Repository]]'', June 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pritchard/&gt; Other allegations of abuse had previously been leveled against Cutts in Stark county.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/story?id=3320952&amp;page=1&amp;CMP=OTC-RSSFeeds0312 Daughter Alleged Abuse by Accused Murderer Bobby Cutts] ABC news&lt;/ref&gt;

For much of the period leading to the discovery of the body, local law enforcement told the news media that Cutts was not a suspect, or even a "person of interest".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/06/22/national/main2966252.shtml "Sheriff: Found Baby Isn't Missing Mom's"], [[CBS News]], June 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his arrest, Cutts was a resident of [[Plain Township, Stark County, Ohio|Plain Township]] in Stark County.&lt;ref name="Township reference"/&gt;

The only interview Cutts has granted to the press to date was published in ''[[Canton Repository|The Repository]]''. This was with Todd Porter, a sportswriter with whom Cutts had previous contact. Cutts denied he was involved. Porter writes: "Cutts looked tired, sullen, and depressed. He openly wept during an exclusive interview with ''The Repository'' from his home."&lt;ref&gt;Todd Porter, [http://www.cantonrep.com/index.php?ID=360797 "Cutts: I did not have anything to do with Davis' disappearance"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927192613/http://www.cantonrep.com/index.php?ID=360797 |date=2007-09-27 }}, [[Canton, Ohio|Canton]] ''[[Canton Repository|Repository]]'', June 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Cutts is believed to have been active on a dating site during the time Davis was missing and allegedly logged in just days before his arrest on June 23.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Zupanic, [http://www.the-review.com/news/article/2184502 "Cutts on dating site until time of arrest"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928105557/http://www.the-review.com/news/article/2184502 |date=2007-09-28 }}, [[Alliance, Ohio|Alliance]] ''[[The Alliance Review|The Review]]'', June 28, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=TRESNIOWSKI|first1=ALEX|title=‘We Prayed It Was Not Him’ – Vol. 68 No. 2|url=http://people.com/archive/we-prayed-it-was-not-him-vol-68-no-2/|accessdate=29 September 2017|work=PEOPLE.com|publisher=Time Inc.|date=9 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Myisha Lynne Ferrell===
Cutts and Myisha Ferrell graduated together in 1995 from [[GlenOak High School]].

The police raided Ferrell's apartment on June 23, seizing cleaning supplies and [[duct tape]], among other things.&lt;ref name="Cutts Bio"/&gt; The [[Canton, Ohio|Canton]] ''[[Canton Repository|Repository]]'' reported that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A source close to Cutts told The Repository Saturday that Cutts said he asked a female friend help him remove Davis' body from her home. Cutts reportedly said Davis’ death was not his doing, but he thought no one would believe him and decided to hide the body.&lt;ref&gt;Todd Porter, [http://www.cantonrep.com/index.php?ID=361686&amp;r=0&amp;Category=15&amp;subCategoryID=0 "Deputies raid home in search of evidence"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626173651/http://www.cantonrep.com/index.php?ID=361686&amp;r=0&amp;Category=15&amp;subCategoryID=0 |date=2007-06-26 }}, [[Canton, Ohio|Canton]] ''[[Canton Repository|Repository]]'', June 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The impression that Ferrell was involved in moving the body is reinforced by the statements made at the court hearing of July 2.&lt;ref name="July 2 hearing"/&gt;

Ferrell was arrested and charged with [[obstruction of justice]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsnet5.com/news/13558317/detail.html "2nd Person Arrested After Missing Woman's Body Identified"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626052135/http://www.newsnet5.com/news/13558317/detail.html |date=2007-06-26 }}, [[WEWS-TV]], June 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of her arrest, she was employed part-time at a local [[Denny's]], and was undergoing eviction proceedings from her apartment.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Farkas and John Horton, [http://www.cleveland.com/jessiedavis/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/news/1182847277203590.xml&amp;coll=2 "Suspect's classmate kept very low profile"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215101325/http://www.cleveland.com/jessiedavis/plaindealer/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fnews%2F1182847277203590.xml&amp;coll=2 |date=2008-02-15 }}, ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' ([[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]), June 26, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 15, 2008, Ferrell was ordered released after serving one year of her two-year sentence, followed by three years of probation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=MIller|first1=Donna J.|title=Myisha Ferrell leaves prison early; had helped hide body of Jessie Davis|url=http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2008/12/myisha_ferrell_released_early.html|accessdate=29 September 2017|work=cleveland.com|publisher=Advance Ohio|date=15 December 2008|location=CANTON, Ohio}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jessie Davis' mother and father were in attendance at the court proceeding.

===Arraignment===
Cutts and Ferrell were arraigned on June 25. Judge John Poulos set Cutts' bond at $5,000,000; Ferrell's bail was set at $500,000. That same day, Cutts was suspended without pay from the Canton Police Department.&lt;ref&gt;Shane Hoover, [http://www.cantonrep.com/index.php?ID=361961&amp;Category=15&amp;subCategoryID=0 "Family confronts Cutts in courtroom"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927192757/http://www.cantonrep.com/index.php?ID=361961&amp;Category=15&amp;subCategoryID=0 |date=2007-09-27 }}, [[Canton, Ohio|Canton]] ''[[Canton Repository|Repository]]'', June 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He had been on paid administrative leave.

===Subsequent court proceedings===
Each appeared at separate court hearings on July 2, before Judge Richard J. Kubilus. These preliminary hearings were meant for the prosecution to present sufficient probable cause to hold the accused. The complexity of the case, and the time frame of the arrests made this necessary as insufficient time existed to obtain an indictment.&lt;ref name=Pritchard&gt;Edd Pritchard, [http://www.cantonrep.com/index.php?Category=9&amp;ID=362194&amp;subCategoryID=0 "Cutts case won't go directly to grand jury"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930013136/http://www.cantonrep.com/index.php?Category=9&amp;ID=362194&amp;subCategoryID=0 |date=2007-09-30 }}, [[Canton, Ohio|Canton]] ''[[Canton Repository|Repository]]'', June 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However, both defendants waived the preliminary hearing, and the case went to the grand jury.&lt;ref name="July 2 hearing"&gt;[http://www.ohio.com/mld/ohio/news/17446751.htm "Cutts friend `helped deposit body'"], [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]] [[Akron Beacon Journal|Beacon Journal]], July 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Cutts is represented by Bradley Iams, while Ferrell is represented John Alexander Jr. of Akron.&lt;ref name="July 2 hearing"/&gt; A request for bail reduction was made on behalf of Ferrell, but this was refused after the prosecutor said "Myisha Ferrell 'helped deposit the body' and lied to police officers several times throughout the investigation."&lt;ref name="July 2 hearing"/&gt;

On November 5, 2007, as her trial was about to begin, Ferrell agreed to plead guilty to charges of obstruction of justice and complicity to gross abuse of a corpse for her role in Davis' disappearance and death. Under the terms of her [[Plea bargain|plea agreement]], Ferrell was sentenced to two years in prison—a sentence that may be lengthened unless Ferrell testifies honestly at the trial of Cutts. The judge said he would consider releasing Ferrell on [[probation]] after one year.&lt;ref name="Myisha Ferrell pleads guilty"&gt;{{cite web |author=Shane Hoover |title=Ferrell pleads guilty; to testify against Cutts in Davis' death |url=http://www.timesreporter.com/index.php?ID=74994&amp;r=0 |date=2007-11-05 |publisher=''The Times-Reporter'' |accessdate=2007-11-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215161241/http://www.timesreporter.com/index.php?ID=74994&amp;r=0 |archive-date=2008-02-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trial of Bobby Lee Cutts Jr.===
Cutts' trial began on February 4, 2008. On February 11, Cutts took the stand and described Davis' death. He said that he struggled with her in her house and struck her in the throat with his elbow. Cutts testified that he tried to resuscitate Davis after she became unconscious. He also said that he did not call 911 because Davis didn't have a telephone in her house and he didn't know how to turn on her cell phone.&lt;ref name="Cutts testifies"&gt;{{cite web |author=James Ewinger |title=Bobby Cutts says he didn't mean to kill Davis |url=http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2008/02/bobby_cutts_says_he_didnt_mean.html |date=February 11, 2008 |publisher=''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' ([[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]])|accessdate=2008-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

) was a noted [[literary critic]] and theorist.&lt;ref name=NYTob/&gt; A pioneer of [[feminist theory]] for her generation, she is regarded as one of the foremost scholars of [[French literature]] and [[critical theory]] of her time. Naomi's younger sister is the artist and writer [[Mira Schor]].

==Early life and education==
At the time of her birth, Naomi Schor's Polish-born parents [[Ilya Schor|Ilya]] and [[Resia Schor]] were artists who had recently immigrated to the US as [[refugee]]s from war-torn Europe.&lt;ref name=NYTob/&gt; Ilya Schor was a painter, jeweler and artist of [[Judaica]],&lt;ref name=NYTob/&gt; and Resia Schor was a painter who later worked in silver and gold and mixed media on sculptural jewelry and Judaica. The Schors lived among a polyglot community of émigrés, among them musicians, intellectuals, and artists. Naomi Schor’s [[first language]] was French,&lt;ref name=NYTob/&gt; and she went to the [[Lycée Français de New York]]&lt;ref name=NYTob/&gt; where she received her [[Baccalauréat]] in 1961, the same year, sadly, that her father died. Schor received her [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[English Literature]] from [[Barnard College]] then received her [[PhD]] in [[French Literature]] from [[Yale University|Yale]].&lt;ref name=NYTob/&gt; There Schor occasionally wrote her scholarly essays in French.&lt;ref name=NYTob/&gt;

==Scholarship==
Schor was one of the early proponents of French [[Psychoanalytic theory|psychoanalytic]] and [[Deconstruction|deconstructive theory]] in American [[literary studies]].&lt;ref name=NYTob/&gt; She wrote about canonical authors such as [[Émile Zola]], [[Gustave Flaubert]],&lt;ref name=NYTob/&gt; [[Marcel Proust]], [[Honoré de Balzac]], re-examining their work through the double lens of the male-authored theoretical discourse of [[Jacques Derrida]] (whom she knew personally),&lt;ref name=NYTob/&gt; [[Roland Barthes]], and [[Jacques Lacan]], and that of French feminist theoreticians such as [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Hélène Cixous]], and [[Luce Irigaray]].

Schor was the founding co-editor of ''differences: A Journal of Feminist Cultural Studies'',&lt;ref name=NYTob/&gt; in 1989, a critical forum where the problematics of difference is&lt;!-- was? --&gt; explored in texts ranging from the literary and the visual to the political and social.

An area of Schor’s expertise was the work of the feminist psychoanalytic theorist [[Luce Irigaray]]. With Carolyn Burke and Margaret Whitford, she edited ''Engaging with Irigaray'', which included essays by [[Rosi Braidotti]], Elizabeth Weed, and [[Judith Butler]]. With ''differences'' co-founder and co-editor Weed, Schor edited a number of ''differences'' books, including ''The Essential Difference'' in 1994 and ''Queer Theory Meets Feminism'' in 1997.

''Reading in Detail: Aesthetics and the Feminine'' is considered one of Schor’s most influential books. In this classic 1987&lt;ref name=NYTob/&gt; work of aesthetic and [[feminist theory]], available in a 2006 paperback edition, Schor provided new ways of thinking about the gendering of details and ornament&lt;ref name=NYTob/&gt; in literature, art, and architecture.

In other writings she developed the concept of female fetishism, in her many writings on the work of [[George Sand]];&lt;ref name=NYTob/&gt; she examined the question of [[idealism]],&lt;ref name=NYTob/&gt; also in relation to Sand, and in her late writings and research revisited the concept of [[universalism]] in an era of [[identity politics]] and difference.&lt;ref name=NYTob/&gt;

==Awards and honors==
Schor was the recipient of numerous awards and honors, including a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship (1963–64), a number of [[Fulbright Award]] Fellowships to France, [[NEH]] Fellowships (1981 and 1990–91), a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1990: She was also elected member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1997. Schor taught at [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[Brown University|Brown]]&lt;ref name=NYTob/&gt; (from 1978 to 1989) where she held the Nancy Duke Lewis Chair from 1985 to 1989, [[Duke University|Duke]]&lt;ref name=NYTob/&gt; where she was the William Hanes Wannamaker Professor of Romance Studies Chair, and [[Harvard University|Harvard]].&lt;ref name=NYTob/&gt; At the time of her death (of a brain hemorrhage) Schor was the Benjamin F. Barge professor of French at [[Yale University|Yale]].&lt;ref name=NYTob/&gt;

Naomi Schor’s papers are part of the [[Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women at Brown University|Pembroke Center]] Archive's Elizabeth Weed [[Feminist Theory]] Papers collection, held at the [[John Hay Library]] at [[Brown University]].

==Personal life==
At the time of her death she was married to R. Howard Bloch, Sterling Professor of French and Chair of the Humanities Program at Yale. A first marriage, to Breton poet Paol Keineg, ended in divorce.&lt;ref name=NYTob/&gt;

'''Philosophy of mind''' is a branch of [[philosophy]] that studies the nature of the [[mind]].

[[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Dualism]] and [[monism]] are the two central [[schools of thought]] on the mind–body problem, although nuanced views have arisen that do not fit one or the other category neatly.

Monism is the position that mind and body are not [[ontology|ontologically]] distinct entities (independent substances).

The most common monisms in the 20th and 21st centuries have all been variations of physicalism; these positions include [[behaviorism]], the [[type physicalism|type identity theory]], [[anomalous monism]] and [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]].&lt;ref name="Kim"&gt;Kim, J., "Mind–Body Problem", ''Oxford Companion to Philosophy''.

Most modern philosophers of mind adopt either a reductive or non-reductive physicalist position, maintaining in their different ways that the mind is not something separate from the body.&lt;ref name="Kim" /&gt; These approaches have been particularly influential in the sciences, especially in the fields of [[sociobiology]], [[computer science]] (specifically, [[artificial intelligence]]), [[evolutionary psychology]] and the various [[neuroscience]]s.&lt;ref name="PsyBio"&gt;Pinel, J.

==Mind–body problem==
{{Main|Mind–body problem}}
The mind–body problem concerns the explanation of the relationship that exists between [[mind]]s, or [[mental processes]], and bodily states or processes.&lt;ref name="Kim1"&gt;{{cite book

 }} &lt;!--Kim, J., "Problems in the Philosophy of Mind". ''Oxford Companion to Philosophy''. Ted Honderich (ed.) Oxford:Oxford University Press. 1995.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The main aim of philosophers working in this area is to determine the nature of the mind and mental states/processes, and how—or even if—minds are affected by and can affect the body.

Our perceptual experiences depend on [[stimulation|stimuli]] that arrive at our various [[Sensory system|sensory organs]] from the external world, and these stimuli cause changes in our mental states, ultimately causing us to feel a sensation, which may be pleasant or unpleasant. Someone's desire for a slice of pizza, for example, will tend to cause that person to move his or her body in a specific manner and in a specific direction to obtain what he or she wants. The question, then, is how it can be possible for conscious experiences to arise out of a lump of gray matter endowed with nothing but electrochemical properties.&lt;ref name="Kim" /&gt;

A related problem is how someone's [[propositional attitude]]s (e.g. beliefs and desires) cause that individual's [[neuron]]s to fire and muscles to contract. These comprise some of the puzzles that have confronted [[Epistemology|epistemologists]] and philosophers of mind from at least the time of [[René Descartes]].&lt;ref name="De" /&gt;

==Dualist solutions to the mind–body problem==
[[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Dualism]] is a set of views about the relationship between [[mind]] and [[matter]] (or [[Human body|body]]). It begins with the claim that mental [[phenomenon|phenomena]] are, in some respects, non-[[nature|physical]].&lt;ref name="Du" /&gt; One of the earliest known formulations of mind–body dualism was expressed in the eastern [[Sankhya]] and [[Yoga]] schools of [[Hindu philosophy]] (c. 650 BCE), which divided the world into [[purusha]] (mind/spirit) and [[prakriti]] (material substance).&lt;ref name="Sa" /&gt; Specifically, the [[Yoga Sutra]] of [[Patanjali]] presents an analytical approach to the nature of the mind.

In [[Western Philosophy]], the earliest discussions of dualist ideas are in the writings of [[Plato]] who maintained that humans' "intelligence" (a faculty of the mind or soul) could not be identified with, or explained in terms of, their physical body.&lt;ref name="Plato" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rob"&gt;Robinson, H. (1983): "Aristotelian dualism", Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy 1, 123–44.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the best-known version of dualism is due to [[René Descartes]] (1641), and holds that the mind is a non-extended, non-physical substance, a "[[mental substance|res cogitans]]".&lt;ref name="De" /&gt; Descartes was the first to clearly identify the mind with [[consciousness]] and [[self-awareness]], and to distinguish this from the brain, which was the seat of intelligence. He was therefore the first to formulate the mind–body problem in the form in which it still exists today.&lt;ref name="De" /&gt;

===Arguments for dualism===
The most frequently used argument in favor of dualism appeals to the common-sense intuition that conscious experience is distinct from inanimate matter. If asked what the mind is, the average person would usually respond by identifying it with their [[self (psychology)|self]], their personality, their [[soul]], or some other such entity. They would almost certainly deny that the mind simply is the brain, or vice versa, finding the idea that there is just one [[ontology|ontological]] entity at play to be too mechanistic, or simply unintelligible.&lt;ref name="Du" /&gt; Many modern philosophers of mind think that these intuitions are misleading and that we should use our critical faculties, along with [[empirical evidence]] from the sciences, to examine these assumptions to determine whether there is any real basis to them.&lt;ref name="Du" /&gt;

Another important argument in favor of dualism is that the mental and the physical seem to have quite different, and perhaps irreconcilable, properties.&lt;ref name="Ja"&gt;Jackson, F. (1982) "Epiphenomenal Qualia." Reprinted in Chalmers, David ed. :2002. ''Philosophy of Mind: Classical and Contemporary Readings''. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Mental events have a subjective quality, whereas physical events do not. So, for example, one can reasonably ask what a burnt finger feels like, or what a blue sky looks like, or what nice music sounds like to a person. But it is meaningless, or at least odd, to ask what a surge in the uptake of [[glutamate]] in the dorsolateral portion of the [[prefrontal cortex]] feels like.

Philosophers of mind call the subjective aspects of mental events "[[qualia]]" or "raw feels".&lt;ref name="Ja" /&gt; There is something that it is like to feel pain, to see a familiar shade of blue, and so on. There are qualia involved in these mental events that seem particularly difficult to reduce to anything physical. David Chalmers explains this argument by stating that we could conceivably know all the objective information about something, such as the brain states and wavelengths of light involved with seeing the color red, but still not know something fundamental about the situation – what it is like to see the color red.&lt;ref name="Nagel"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Nagel, T. | title=What is it like to be a bat? | journal=Philosophical Review | issue=83 | pages=435–456 |year=1974|url=http://www.esalq.usp.br/lepse/imgs/conteudo_thumb/What-Is-It-Like-to-Be-a-Bat-1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If consciousness (the mind) can exist independently of physical reality (the brain), one must explain how physical memories are created concerning consciousness. Dualism must therefore explain how consciousness affects physical reality. One possible explanation is that of a miracle, proposed by [[Arnold Geulincx]] and [[Nicolas Malebranche]], where all mind–body interactions require the direct intervention of God.

Another possible argument that has been proposed by [[C. S. Lewis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Lewis, C.S | title=Miracles | year=1947 | isbn=978-0-688-17369-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[Argument from Reason]]: if, as monism implies, all of our thoughts are the effects of physical causes, then we have no reason for assuming that they are also the [[consequent]] of a reasonable ground. Knowledge, however, is apprehended by reasoning from ground to consequent. Therefore, if monism is correct, there would be no way of knowing this—or anything else—we could not even suppose it, except by a fluke.

The [[p-zombie|zombie argument]] is based on a [[thought experiment]] proposed by Todd Moody, and developed by [[David Chalmers]] in his book ''[[The Conscious Mind]]''. The basic idea is that one can imagine one's body, and therefore conceive the existence of one's body, without any conscious states being associated with this body. Chalmers' argument is that it seems possible that such a being could exist because all that is needed is that all and only the things that the physical sciences describe about a zombie must be true of it. Since none of the concepts involved in these sciences make reference to consciousness or other mental phenomena, and any physical entity can be by definition described scientifically via [[physics]], the move from conceivability to possibility is not such a large one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Chalmers, David | title=The Conscious Mind | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1997 | isbn=978-0-19-511789-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others such as Dennett have [[Philosophical zombie#Criticism|argued]] that the notion of a philosophical zombie is an incoherent,&lt;ref name="Dennett, Daniel 1995 322–6"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dennett, Daniel |title=The unimagined preposterousness of zombies |year=1995 |journal=J Consciousness Studies |volume=2 |pages=322–6 |url=http://pp.kpnet.fi/seirioa/cdenn/unzombie.htm |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170515115656/http://pp.kpnet.fi/seirioa/cdenn/unzombie.htm |archivedate=2017-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or unlikely,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Dennett, Daniel | title=Consciousness Explained | publisher=Little, Brown and Co. | year=1991 | page=95 | isbn=978-0-316-18065-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; concept. It has been argued under physicalism that one must either believe that anyone including oneself might be a zombie, or that no one can be a zombie—following from the assertion that one's own conviction about being (or not being) a zombie is a product of the physical world and is therefore no different from anyone else's. This argument has been expressed by Dennett who argues that "Zombies think they are conscious, think they have qualia, think they suffer pains—they are just 'wrong' (according to this lamentable tradition) in ways that neither they nor we could ever discover!"&lt;ref name="Dennett, Daniel 1995 322–6"/&gt;

===Interactionist dualism===
[[File:Frans Hals - Portret van René Descartes.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[René Descartes]] by [[Frans Hals]] (1648)]]
Interactionist dualism, or simply interactionism, is the particular form of dualism first espoused by Descartes in the ''Meditations''.&lt;ref name="De" /&gt; In the 20th century, its major defenders have been [[Karl Popper]] and [[John Carew Eccles]].&lt;ref name="PopE"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Popper, Karl  |author2=Eccles, John  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=The Self and Its Brain | publisher=Springer Verlag | year=2002 | isbn=978-3-492-21096-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the view that mental states, such as beliefs and desires, causally interact with physical states.&lt;ref name="Du" /&gt;

Descartes' famous argument for this position can be summarized as follows: Seth has a clear and distinct idea of his mind as a thinking thing that has no spatial extension (i.e., it cannot be measured in terms of length, weight, height, and so on). He also has a clear and distinct idea of his body as something that is spatially extended, subject to quantification and not able to think. It follows that mind and body are not identical because they have radically different properties.&lt;ref name="De" /&gt;

At the same time, however, it is clear that Seth's mental states (desires, beliefs, etc.) have [[causality|causal]] effects on his body and vice versa: A child touches a hot stove (physical event) which causes pain (mental event) and makes her yell (physical event), this in turn provokes a sense of fear and protectiveness in the caregiver (mental event), and so on.

Descartes' argument crucially depends on the premise that what Seth believes to be "clear and distinct" ideas in his mind are [[logical truth|necessarily true]]. Many contemporary philosophers doubt this.&lt;ref name="CE"&gt;Dennett D., (1991), ''Consciousness Explained'', Boston: Little, Brown &amp; Company&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SS"&gt;Stich, S., (1983), ''From Folk Psychology to Cognitive Science''. Cambridge, MA: [[MIT Press]] (Bradford)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ryle, G., 1949, The Concept of Mind, New York: Barnes and Noble&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Joseph Agassi]] suggests that several scientific discoveries made since the early 20th century have undermined the idea of privileged access to one's own ideas. [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] claimed that a psychologically-trained observer can understand a person's unconscious motivations better than the person himself does. [[Pierre Duhem|Duhem]] has shown that a philosopher of science can know a person's methods of discovery better than that person herself does, while [[Bronisław Malinowski|Malinowski]] has shown that an anthropologist can know a person's customs and habits better than the person whose customs and habits they are. He also asserts that modern psychological experiments that cause people to see things that are not there provide grounds for rejecting Descartes' argument, because scientists can describe a person's perceptions better than the person herself can.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Agassi, J. | title=Privileged Access; ''Science in Flux, Boston Stidues in the Philosophy of Science'', 80| publisher=Reidel| location=Dordrecht| year=1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Agassi, J. | title=La Scienza in Divenire | publisher=Armando | location=Rome | year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other forms of dualism===
[[File:DualismCausationViews3.svg|400px|thumb|Four varieties of dualism. The arrows indicate the direction of the causal interactions. Occasionalism is not shown.]]

====Psychophysical parallelism====
[[Psychophysical parallelism]], or simply '''parallelism''', is the view that mind and body, while having distinct ontological statuses, do not causally influence one another. Instead, they run along parallel paths (mind events causally interact with mind events and brain events causally interact with brain events) and only seem to influence each other.&lt;ref name="DuSEP"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view was most prominently defended by [[Gottfried Leibniz]]. Although Leibniz was an ontological monist who believed that only one type of substance, the [[Monad (Greek philosophy)|monad]], exists in the universe, and that everything is reducible to it, he nonetheless maintained that there was an important distinction between "the mental" and "the physical" in terms of causation. He held that God had arranged things in advance so that minds and bodies would be in harmony with each other. This is known as the doctrine of [[pre-established harmony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Leibniz | first=Gottfried Wilhelm | title=Monadology | year=1714 | isbn=978-0-87548-030-5| title-link=Monadology }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Occasionalism====
[[Occasionalism]] is the view espoused by [[Nicholas Malebranche]] as well as Islamic philosophers  such as [[Al-Ghazali|Abu Hamid Muhammad ibn Muhammad al-Ghazali]] that asserts that all supposedly causal relations between physical events, or between physical and mental events, are not really causal at all. While body and mind are different substances, causes (whether mental or physical) are related to their effects by an act of God's intervention on each specific occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Property dualism====
[[Property dualism]] is the view that the world is constituted of just one kind of [[substance theory|substance]] – the physical kind – and there exist two distinct kinds of properties: [[physical properties]] and [[mental properties]]. In other words, it is the view that non-physical, mental properties (such as beliefs, desires and emotions) inhere in some physical bodies (at least, brains). How mental and physical properties relate causally depends on the variety of property dualism in question, and is not always a clear issue. Sub-varieties of property dualism include:

#[[Emergent materialism]] asserts that when matter is organized in the appropriate way (i.e. in the way that living human bodies are organized), mental properties emerge  in a way not fully accountable for by physical laws.&lt;ref name="Du" /&gt; These emergent properties have an independent ontological status and cannot be reduced to, or explained in terms of, the physical substrate from which they emerge. They are dependent on the physical properties from which they emerge, but opinions vary as to the coherence of [[top–down causation]], i.e. the causal effectiveness of such properties. A form of emergent materialism has been espoused by [[David Chalmers]] and the concept has undergone something of a renaissance in recent years,&lt;ref name="Chalmers"&gt;{{cite book | last=Chalmers |first=David | authorlink=David Chalmers | title=The Conscious Mind | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1996 | isbn = 978-0-19-511789-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was already suggested in the 19th century by [[William James]].
#[[Epiphenomenalism]] is a doctrine first formulated by [[Thomas Henry Huxley]].&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, T. H. [1874] "On the Hypothesis that Animals are Automata, and its History", ''The Fortnightly Review'', n.s.16:555–580. Reprinted in ''Method and Results: Essays by Thomas H. Huxley'' (New York: D. Appleton and Company, 1898).&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of the view that mental phenomena are causally ineffectual, where one or more mental states do not have any influence on physical states or mental phenomena are the effects, but not the causes, of physical phenomena. Physical events can cause other physical events and physical events can cause mental events, but mental events cannot cause anything, since they are just causally inert by-products (i.e. epiphenomena) of the physical world.&lt;ref name="DuSEP" /&gt; This view has been defended most strongly in recent times by [[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Jackson, Frank | title=What Mary didn't know | journal=Journal of Philosophy | year=1986 |pages=291–295}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Property dualism#Non-reductive Physicalism|Non-reductive physicalism]] is the view that mental properties form a separate ontological class to physical properties: mental states (such as qualia) are not reducible to physical states. The ontological stance towards qualia in the case of non-reductive physicalism does not imply that qualia are causally inert; this is what distinguishes it from epiphenomenalism.
#[[Panpsychism]] is the view that all matter has a mental aspect, or, alternatively, all objects have a unified center of experience or point of view. Superficially, it seems to be a form of property dualism, since it regards everything as having both mental and physical properties. However, some panpsychists say that mechanical behaviour is derived from the primitive mentality of atoms and molecules—as are sophisticated mentality and organic behaviour, the difference being attributed to the presence or absence of [[complexity|complex]] structure in a compound object. So long as the ''reduction'' of non-mental properties to mental ones is in place, panpsychism is not a (strong) form of property dualism; otherwise it is.

====Dual aspect theory====
[[Dual aspect theory]] or dual-aspect monism is the view that the [[mind|mental]] and the [[nature|physical]] are two aspects of, or perspectives on, the same substance.  (Thus it is a mixed position, which is monistic in some respects). In modern philosophical writings, the theory's relationship to [[neutral monism]] has become somewhat ill-defined, but one proffered distinction says that whereas neutral monism allows the context of a given group of neutral elements and the relationships into which they enter to determine whether the group can be thought of as mental, physical, both, or neither, dual-aspect theory suggests that the mental and the physical are manifestations (or aspects) of some underlying substance, entity or process that is itself neither mental nor physical as normally understood. Various formulations of dual-aspect monism also require the mental and the physical to be complementary, mutually irreducible and perhaps inseparable (though distinct).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Atmanspacher | first1 = H | year = 2012 | title = Dual-aspect monism a la Pauli and Jung | url = https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Harald_Atmanspacher/publication/262956033_Dual-Aspect_Monism_a_la_Pauli_and_Jung/links/568a246308ae051f9af9ca21.pdf | journal = Journal of Consciousness Studies: Special Issue on Monist Alternatives to Physicalism | volume = 19 | issue = 9–10| pages = 96–120 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Velmans | first1 = M | year = 2012 | title = Reflexive Monism: psychophysical relations among mind, matter and consciousness | url = https://www.academia.edu/2053423 | journal = Journal of Consciousness Studies: Special Issue on Monist Alternatives to Physicalism | volume = 19 | issue = 9–10 | pages = 143–165 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171111113509/http://www.academia.edu/2053423/Reflexive_Monism_Psychophysical_relations_among_mind_matter_and_consciousness | archivedate = 2017-11-11 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leopold Stubenberg.

==== Experiential dualism ====
This is a philosophy of mind that regards the degrees of freedom between mental and physical well-being as not necessarily synonymous thus implying an experiential dualism between body and mind.  An example of these disparate degrees of freedom is given by [[B. Alan Wallace|Allan Wallace]] who notes that it is "experientially apparent that one may be physically uncomfortable—for instance, while engaging in a strenuous physical workout—while mentally cheerful; conversely, one may be mentally distraught while experiencing physical comfort".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Consciousness At The Crossroads: Conversations With The Dalai Lama On Brain Science And Buddhism|last=Wallace|first=Allen|publisher=Snow Lion|year=1999|isbn=9780545227209|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Experiential dualism notes that our subjective experience of merely seeing something in the physical world seems qualitatively different than mental processes like grief that comes from losing a loved one.  This philosophy also is a proponent of causal dualism which is defined as the dual ability for mental states and physical states to affect one another.  Mental states can cause changes in physical states and vice versa.

However, unlike cartesian dualism or some other systems, experiential dualism does not posit two fundamental substances in reality: mind and matter.  Rather, experiential dualism is to be understood as a conceptual framework that gives credence to the qualitative difference between the experience of mental and physical states.  Experiential dualism is accepted as the conceptual framework of [[Madhyamaka|Madhyamaka Buddhism]].

Madhayamaka Buddhism goes even further, finding fault with the monist view of physicalist philosophies of mind as well in that these generally posit matter and energy as the fundamental substance of reality.  Nonetheless, this does not imply that the cartesian dualist view is correct, rather Madhyamaka regards as error any affirming view of a fundamental substance to reality.&lt;blockquote&gt;In denying the independent self-existence of all the phenomena that make up the world of our experience, the Madhyamaka view departs from both the substance dualism of Descartes and the substance monism—namely, physicalism—that is characteristic of modern science. The physicalism propounded by many contemporary scientists seems to assert that the real world is composed of physical things-in-themselves, while all mental phenomena are regarded as mere appearances, devoid of any reality in and of themselves. Much is made of this difference between appearances and reality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Indeed, physicalism, or the idea that matter is the only fundamental substance of reality, is explicitly rejected by Buddhism.&lt;blockquote&gt;In the Madhyamaka view, mental events are no more or less real than physical events. In terms of our common-sense experience, differences of kind do exist between physical and mental phenomena. While the former commonly have mass, location, velocity, shape, size, and numerous other physical attributes, these are not generally characteristic of mental phenomena. For example, we do not commonly conceive of the feeling of affection for another person as having mass or location. These physical attributes are no more appropriate to other mental events such as sadness, a recalled image from one's childhood, the visual perception of a rose, or consciousness of any sort. Mental phenomena are, therefore, not regarded as being physical, for the simple reason that they lack many of the attributes that are uniquely characteristic of physical phenomena. Thus, Buddhism has never adopted the physicalist principle that regards only physical things as real.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Hylomorphism====
{{Main|Hylomorphism}}
Hylomorphism is a theory that originates with [[Aristotle|Aristotelian philosophy]], which conceives [[ousia|being]] as a compound of [[matter]] and [[Substantial form|form]]. "Hylomorphism" is a 19th-century term formed from the Greek words ὕλη ''hyle'', "wood, matter", and μορφή, ''morphē'', "form".

==Monist solutions to the mind–body problem==
In contrast to [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]], [[monism]] does not accept any fundamental divisions. The fundamentally disparate nature of reality has been central to forms of eastern philosophies for over two millennia. In [[Indian philosophy|Indian]] and [[Chinese philosophy]], monism is integral to how experience is understood. Today, the most common forms of monism in Western philosophy are [[physicalism|physicalist]].&lt;ref name="Kim" /&gt; Physicalistic monism asserts that the only existing substance is physical, in some sense of that term to be clarified by our best science.&lt;ref name="Stol"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a variety of formulations (see below) are possible. Another form of monism, [[idealism]], states that the only existing substance is mental. Although pure idealism, such as that of [[George Berkeley]], is uncommon in contemporary Western philosophy, a more sophisticated variant called [[panpsychism]], according to which mental experience and properties may be at the foundation of physical experience and properties, has been espoused by some philosophers such as [[Alfred North Whitehead]]&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Michel Weber]] and Anderson Weekes (eds.), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279961/Process_Approaches_to_Consciousness_in_Psychology_Neuroscience_and_Philosophy_of_Mind Process Approaches to Consciousness in Psychology, Neuroscience, and Philosophy of Mind (Whitehead Psychology Nexus Studies II)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408022540/http://www.academia.edu/279961/Process_Approaches_to_Consciousness_in_Psychology_Neuroscience_and_Philosophy_of_Mind |date=2015-04-08 }}'', Albany, New York, State University of New York Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[David Ray Griffin]].&lt;ref name="Chalmers" /&gt;

[[Phenomenalism]] is the theory that representations (or [[sense data]]) of external objects are all that exist. Such a view was briefly adopted by [[Bertrand Russell]] and many of the [[logical positivists]] during the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand (1918) ''Mysticism and Logic and Other Essays'', London: Longmans, Green.&lt;/ref&gt; A third possibility is to accept the existence of a basic substance that is neither physical nor mental. The mental and physical would then both be properties of this neutral substance. Such a position was adopted by Baruch Spinoza&lt;ref name="Spin" /&gt; and was popularized by [[Ernst Mach]]&lt;ref&gt;Mach, E. (1886) ''Die Analyse der Empfindungen und das Verhältnis des Physischen zum Psychischen.'' Fifth edition translated as ''The Analysis of Sensations and the Relation of Physical to the Psychical'', New York: Dover. 1959&lt;/ref&gt; in the 19th century. This [[neutral monism]], as it is called, resembles property dualism.

===Physicalistic monisms===

====Behaviorism====
{{Main|Behaviorism}}
Behaviorism dominated philosophy of mind for much of the 20th century, especially the first half.&lt;ref name="Kim" /&gt; In psychology, behaviorism developed as a reaction to the inadequacies of [[introspection]]ism.&lt;ref name="Stol" /&gt; Introspective reports on one's own interior mental life are not subject to careful examination for accuracy and cannot be used to form predictive generalizations. Without generalizability and the possibility of third-person examination, the behaviorists argued, psychology cannot be scientific.&lt;ref name="Stol" /&gt; The way out, therefore, was to eliminate the idea of an interior mental life (and hence an ontologically independent mind) altogether and focus instead on the description of observable behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Skinner, B.F. | title=Beyond Freedom &amp; Dignity | publisher=Bantam/Vintage Books |location=New York | year=1972 | isbn=978-0-553-14372-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallel to these developments in psychology, a philosophical behaviorism (sometimes called logical behaviorism) was developed.&lt;ref name="Stol" /&gt; This is characterized by a strong [[verificationism]], which generally considers unverifiable statements about interior mental life pointless. For the behaviorist, mental states are not interior states on which one can make introspective reports. They are just descriptions of behavior or [[disposition]]s to behave in certain ways, made by third parties to explain and predict another's behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Ryle, Gilbert | title=The Concept of Mind | publisher=Chicago University Press | location=Chicago | year=1949 |isbn=978-0-226-73295-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophical behaviorism has fallen out of favor since the latter half of the 20th century, coinciding with the rise of [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]].&lt;ref name="Kim1" /&gt; Cognitivists reject behaviorism due to several perceived problems. For example, behaviorism could be said to be [[counterintuitive]] when it maintains that someone is talking about behavior in the event that a person is experiencing a painful headache.

====Identity theory====
{{Main|Type physicalism}}
Type physicalism (or type-identity theory) was developed by [[J. J. C. Smart|John Smart]]&lt;ref name="Smart" /&gt; and [[Ullin Place]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Place, Ullin | title=Is Consciousness a Brain Process? | journal=British Journal of Psychology | year=1956 | doi = 10.1111/j.2044-8295.1956.tb00560.x | volume=47 | pages=44–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a direct reaction to the failure of behaviorism. These philosophers reasoned that, if mental states are something material, but not behavioral, then mental states are probably identical to internal states of the brain. In very simplified terms: a mental state ''M'' is nothing other than brain state ''B''. The mental state "desire for a cup of coffee" would thus be nothing more than the "firing of certain neurons in certain brain regions".&lt;ref name="Smart" /&gt;
[[File:Anomalous Monism.png|thumb|right|250px|The classic Identity theory and Anomalous Monism in contrast. For the Identity theory, every token instantiation of a single mental type corresponds (as indicated by the arrows) to a physical token of a single physical type. For anomalous monism, the token–token correspondences can fall outside of the type–type correspondences. The result is token identity.]]

Despite its initial plausibility, the identity theory faces a strong challenge in the form of the thesis of [[multiple realizability]], first formulated by [[Hilary Putnam]].&lt;ref name="Pu" /&gt; For example, not only humans, but many different species of animals can experience pain. However, it seems highly unlikely that all of these diverse organisms with the same pain experience are in the identical brain state. And if this is the case, then pain cannot be identical to a specific brain state. The identity theory is thus empirically unfounded.&lt;ref name="Pu" /&gt;

On the other hand, even granted the above, it does not follow that identity theories of all types must be abandoned. According to token identity theories, the fact that a certain brain state is connected with only one mental state of a person does not have to mean that there is an absolute correlation between types of mental state and types of brain state. The type–token distinction can be illustrated by a simple example: the word "green" contains four types of letters (g, r, e, n) with two tokens (occurrences) of the letter ''e'' along with one each of the others.
The idea of token identity is that only particular occurrences of mental events are identical with particular occurrences or tokenings of physical events.&lt;ref&gt;Smart, J.J.C, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2002/entries/malebranche "Identity Theory"], ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Summer 2002 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; Anomalous monism (see below) and most other non-reductive physicalisms are token-identity theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Davidson, D.| title=Subjective, Intersubjective, Objective | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=Oxford | year=2001 | isbn=978-88-7078-832-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these problems, there is a renewed interest in the type identity theory today, primarily due to the influence of [[Jaegwon Kim]].&lt;ref name="Smart" /&gt;

====Functionalism====
{{Main|Functionalism (philosophy of mind)}}
Functionalism was formulated by [[Hilary Putnam]] and [[Jerry Fodor]] as a reaction to the inadequacies of the identity theory.&lt;ref name="Pu" /&gt; Putnam and Fodor saw mental states in terms of an empirical [[computational theory of mind|computational theory of the mind]].&lt;ref name="Block"&gt;Block, Ned. "What is functionalism" in ''Readings in Philosophy of Psychology'', 2 vols. Vol 1. (Cambridge: Harvard, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt; At about the same time or slightly after, [[D.M. Armstrong]] and [[David Kellogg Lewis]] formulated a version of functionalism that analyzed the mental concepts of folk psychology in terms of functional roles.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, D., 1968, ''A Materialist Theory of the Mind'', Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]]'s idea of meaning as use led to a version of functionalism as a theory of meaning, further developed by [[Wilfrid Sellars]] and [[Gilbert Harman]]. Another one, [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)#Psychofunctionalism|psychofunctionalism]], is an approach adopted by the [[Naturalism (philosophy)#Metaphysical naturalism|naturalistic philosophy of mind]] associated with Jerry Fodor and [[Zenon Pylyshyn]].

What all these different varieties of functionalism share in common is the thesis that mental states are characterized by their causal relations with other mental states and with sensory inputs and behavioral outputs. That is, functionalism abstracts away from the details of the physical implementation of a mental state by characterizing it in terms of non-mental functional properties. For example, a kidney is characterized scientifically by its functional role in filtering blood and maintaining certain chemical balances. From this point of view, it does not really matter whether the kidney be made up of organic tissue, plastic nanotubes or silicon chips: it is the role that it plays and its relations to other organs that define it as a kidney.&lt;ref name="Block" /&gt;

====Non-reductive physicalism====
{{Main|Physicalism}}

Non-reductionist philosophers hold firmly to two essential convictions with regard to mind–body relations: 1) Physicalism is true and mental states must be physical states, but 2) All reductionist proposals are unsatisfactory: mental states cannot be reduced to behavior, brain states or functional states.&lt;ref name="Stol" /&gt; Hence, the question arises whether there can still be a non-reductive physicalism. [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]]'s [[anomalous monism]]&lt;ref name="Davidson" /&gt; is an attempt to formulate such a physicalism. He "thinks that when one runs across what are traditionally seen as absurdities of Reason, such as akrasia or self-deception, the personal psychology framework is not to be given up in favor of the subpersonal one, but rather must be enlarged or extended so that the rationality set out by the principle of charity can be found elsewhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Di Francesco M. &amp; Marraffa M.|title=The Unconscious, consciousness, and the Self illusion|journal=Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences|date=2013|volume=6|issue=1|pages=10–22|url=http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A13-01.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303051022/http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A13-01.pdf|archivedate=2017-03-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davidson uses the thesis of [[supervenience]]: mental states supervene on physical states, but are not reducible to them. "Supervenience" therefore describes a functional dependence: there can be no change in the mental without some change in the physical–causal reducibility between the mental and physical without ontological reducibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stanton | first1 = W.L. | year = 1983 | title = Supervenience and Psychological Law in Anomalous Monism | url = | journal = Pacific Philosophical Quarterly | volume = 64 | issue = | pages = 72–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because non-reductive physicalist theories attempt to both retain the ontological distinction between mind and body and try to solve the "surfeit of explanations puzzle" in some way; critics often see this as a paradox and point out the similarities to [[epiphenomenalism]], in that it is the brain that is seen as the root "cause" not the mind, and the mind seems to be rendered inert.

Epiphenomenalism regards one or more mental states as the byproduct of physical brain states, having no influence on physical states. The interaction is one-way (solving the "surfeit of explanations puzzle") but leaving us with non-reducible mental states (as a byproduct of brain states) – causally reducible, but ontologically irreducible to physical states. Pain would be seen by epiphenomenaliasts as being caused by the brain state but as not having effects on other brain states, though it might have effects on other mental states (i.e. cause distress).

====Weak emergentism====
{{Main|Emergentism}}
Weak emergentism is a form of "non-reductive physicalism" that involves a layered view of nature, with the layers arranged in terms of increasing complexity and each corresponding to its own special science. Some philosophers hold that emergent properties causally interact with more fundamental levels, while others maintain that higher-order properties simply supervene over lower levels without direct causal interaction. The latter group therefore holds a less strict, or "weaker", definition of emergentism, which can be rigorously stated as follows: a property P of composite object O is emergent if it is metaphysically impossible for another object to lack property P if that object is composed of parts with intrinsic properties identical to those in O and has those parts in an identical configuration.

Sometimes emergentists use the example of water having a new property when Hydrogen H and Oxygen O combine to form H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (water). In this example there "emerges" a new property of a transparent liquid that would not have been predicted by understanding hydrogen and oxygen as gases. This is analogous to physical properties of the brain giving rise to a mental state. Emergentists try to solve the notorious mind–body gap this way. One problem for emergentism is the idea of "causal closure" in the world that does not allow for a mind-to-body causation.&lt;ref&gt;Jaegwon Kim, Philosophy of Mind, Westview Press; 2 edition (July 8, 2005) {{ISBN|0-8133-4269-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Eliminative materialism====
{{Main|Eliminative materialism}}
If one is a materialist and believes that all aspects of our common-sense psychology will find reduction to a mature [[cognitive neuroscience]], and that non-reductive materialism is mistaken, then one can adopt a final, more radical position: eliminative materialism.

There are several varieties of eliminative materialism, but all maintain that our common-sense "[[folk psychology]]" badly misrepresents the nature of some aspect of cognition. Eliminativists such as [[Patricia Churchland|Patricia]] and [[Paul Churchland]] argue that while folk psychology treats cognition as fundamentally sentence-like, the non-linguistic vector/matrix model of neural network theory or [[connectionism]] will prove to be a much more accurate account of how the brain works.&lt;ref name="Pat" /&gt;

The Churchlands often invoke the fate of other, erroneous popular theories and [[ontology|ontologies]] that have arisen in the course of history.&lt;ref name="Pat" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul" /&gt; For example, Ptolemaic astronomy served to explain and roughly predict the motions of the planets for centuries, but eventually this model of the solar system was eliminated in favor of the Copernican model. The Churchlands believe the same eliminative fate awaits the "sentence-cruncher" model of the mind in which thought and behavior are the result of manipulating sentence-like states called "[[propositional attitude]]s".

===Non-physicalist monisms===

====Idealism====
[[Idealism]] is the form of monism that sees the world as consisting  of minds, mental contents and or consciousness.
Idealists are not faced with explaining how  minds arise from bodies: rather, the world, bodies and objects are regarded as mere appearances held by minds. However, accounting for the mind–body problem is not usually the main motivation for idealism; rather, idealists tend to be motivated by [[skepticism]], intentionality, and the unique nature of ideas.
Idealism is prominent in Eastern religious and philosophical thought. It has gone through several cycles of popularity and neglect in the history of Western philosophy.

Different varieties of idealism may hold that there are
* multiple  minds ([[pluralistic idealism]])
* only one human mind ([[solipsism]])
* or a single [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]], [[Anima Mundi]], [[Plotinus#One|One]] or [[Over-soul]].

====Neutral monism====
[[Neutral monism]], in [[philosophy]], is the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] view that the mental and the physical are two ways of organizing or describing the same elements, which are themselves "neutral", that is, neither physical nor mental.  This view denies that the mental and the physical are two fundamentally different things. Rather, neutral monism claims the universe consists of only one kind of stuff, in the form of neutral elements that are in themselves neither mental nor physical. These neutral elements might have the properties of color and shape, just as we experience those properties. But these shaped and colored elements do not exist in a mind (considered as a substantial entity, whether dualistically or physicalistically); they exist on their own.

==Mysterianism==
{{Main|New mysterianism}}
Some philosophers take an epistemic approach and argue that the mind–body problem is currently unsolvable, and perhaps will always remain unsolvable to human beings. This is usually termed [[New mysterianism]]. [[Colin McGinn]] holds that human beings are [[Cognitive closure (philosophy)|cognitively closed]] in regards to their own minds. According to McGinn human minds lack the concept-forming procedures to fully grasp how mental properties such as [[consciousness]] arise from their causal basis.&lt;ref&gt;McGinn, Colin. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2254848 "Can We Solve the Mind–Body Problem?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226060901/http://www.jstor.org/stable/2254848 |date=2016-12-26 }}, ''Mind'', New Series, Vol. 98, No. 391, July 1989 (pp. 349–366), p. 350.
*Reprinted in O'Connor, Timothy and Robb, David. [https://books.google.com/books?id=BlSDUzfMxo0C&amp;pg=PA438 "Colin McGinn, Can We Solve the Mind–Body Problem?"], ''Philosophy of Mind: Contemporary Readings''. Routledge, 2003, p. 438ff.&lt;/ref&gt; An example would be how an elephant is cognitively closed in regards to particle physics.

A more moderate conception has been expounded by [[Thomas Nagel]], which holds that the mind–body problem is currently unsolvable at the present stage of scientific development and that it might take a future scientific [[paradigm shift]] or revolution to bridge the [[explanatory gap]]. Nagel posits that in the future a sort of "objective [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]" might be able to bridge the gap between subjective conscious experience and its physical basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/hard-con/#SH3b "Hard problem of Consciousness"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150420211306/http://www.iep.utm.edu/hard-con/ |date=2015-04-20 }}, ''The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Josh Weisberg&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linguistic criticism of the mind–body problem==
Each attempt to answer the mind–body problem encounters substantial problems. Some philosophers argue that this is because there is an underlying conceptual confusion.&lt;ref name="Hacker"&gt;{{cite book | author=Hacker, Peter | title=Philosophical Foundations of Neuroscience | publisher=Blackwel Pub. | year=2003 | isbn=978-1-4051-0838-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These philosophers, such as [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and his followers in the tradition of linguistic criticism, therefore reject the problem as illusory.&lt;ref name="Witt"&gt;{{cite book | author=Wittgenstein, Ludwig | title=Philosophical Investigations | publisher=Macmillan | location=New York | year=1954 | isbn=978-0-631-14660-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that it is an error to ask how mental and biological states fit together. Rather it should simply be accepted that human experience can be described in different ways—for instance, in a mental and in a biological vocabulary. Illusory problems arise if one tries to describe the one in terms of the other's vocabulary or if the mental vocabulary is used in the wrong contexts.&lt;ref name="Witt" /&gt; This is the case, for instance, if one searches for mental states of the brain. The brain is simply the wrong context for the use of mental vocabulary—the search for mental states of the brain is therefore a [[category error]] or a sort of fallacy of reasoning.&lt;ref name="Witt" /&gt;

Today, such a position is often adopted by interpreters of Wittgenstein such as [[Peter Hacker]].&lt;ref name="Hacker" /&gt; However, [[Hilary Putnam]], the originator of functionalism, has also adopted the position that the mind–body problem is an illusory problem which should be dissolved according to the manner of Wittgenstein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Putnam, Hilary | title=The Threefold Cord: Mind, Body, and World | publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York | year=2000 |isbn=978-0-231-10286-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Externalism and internalism==
Where is the mind located? If the mind is a physical phenomenon of some kind, it has to be located somewhere. According to some, there are two possible options: either the mind is internal to the body ([[internalism]]) or the mind is external to it ([[externalism]]). More generally, either the mind depends only on events and properties taking place inside the subject's body or it depends also on factors external to it.

Proponents of internalism are committed to the view that neural activity is sufficient to produce the mind.
Proponents of externalism maintain that the surrounding world is in some sense constitutive of the mind.

Externalism differentiates into several versions. The main ones are [[semantic externalism]], [[cognitive externalism]] and [[phenomenal externalism]]. Each of these versions of externalism can further be divided into whether they refer only to the content or to the vehicles of the mind.

Semantic externalism holds that the semantic content of the mind is totally or partially defined by a state of affairs external to the body of the subject. [[Hilary Putnam]]'s [[Twin Earth thought experiment]] is a good example.

Cognitive externalism is a very broad collection of views that suggests the role of the environment, of tools, of development, and of the body in fleshing out cognition. [[Embodied cognition]], the [[extended mind]], and [[enactivism]] are good examples.

Phenomenal externalism suggests that the phenomenal aspects of the mind are external to the body. Authors who addressed this possibility are Ted Honderich, Edwin Holt, Francois Tonneau, Kevin O'Regan, Riccardo Manzotti, Teed Rockwell and Max Velmans.

==Naturalism and its problems==
The thesis of physicalism is that the mind is part of the material (or physical) world. Such a position faces the problem that the mind has certain properties that no other material thing seems to possess. Physicalism must therefore explain how it is possible that these properties can nonetheless emerge from a material thing. The project of providing such an explanation is often referred to as the "[[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalization]] of the mental".&lt;ref name="Stol" /&gt; Some of the crucial problems that this project attempts to resolve include the existence of qualia and the nature of intentionality.&lt;ref name="Stol" /&gt;

===Qualia===
{{Main|Qualia}}

Many mental states seem to be experienced subjectively in different ways by different individuals.&lt;ref name="Nagel" /&gt; And it is characteristic of a mental state that it has some experiential ''quality'', e.g. of pain, that it hurts. However, the sensation of pain between two individuals may not be identical, since no one has a perfect way to measure how much something hurts or of describing exactly how it feels to hurt. Philosophers and scientists therefore ask where these experiences come from. The existence of cerebral events, in and of themselves, cannot explain why they are accompanied by these corresponding qualitative experiences. The puzzle of why many cerebral processes occur with an accompanying experiential aspect in consciousness seems impossible to explain.&lt;ref name="Ja" /&gt;

Yet it also seems to many that science will eventually have to explain such experiences.&lt;ref name="Stol" /&gt; This [[Logical consequence|follows from]] an assumption about the possibility of [[reductionism|reductive explanations]]. According to this view, if an attempt can be successfully made to explain a phenomenon reductively (e.g., water), then it can be explained why the phenomenon has all of its properties (e.g., fluidity, transparency).&lt;ref name="Stol" /&gt; In the case of mental states, this means that there needs to be an explanation of why they have the property of being experienced in a certain way.

The 20th-century German philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]] criticized the [[ontology|ontological]] assumptions underpinning such a reductive model, and claimed that it was impossible to make sense of experience in these terms. This is because, according to Heidegger, the nature of our subjective experience and its ''qualities'' is impossible to understand in terms of [[Descartes|Cartesian]] "substances" that bear "properties". Another way to put this is that the very concept of qualitative experience is incoherent in terms of—or is semantically [[Commensurability (philosophy of science)|incommensurable]] with the concept of—substances that bear properties.&lt;ref&gt;Hubert Dreyfus, "Critique of Descartes I" (recorded lecture), University of California at Berkeley, Sept. 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

This problem of explaining introspective first-person aspects of mental states and consciousness in general in terms of third-person quantitative neuroscience is called the [[explanatory gap]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Levine (philosopher)|Joseph Levine]], ''Materialism and Qualia: The Explanatory Gap'', in: ''Pacific Philosophical Quarterly'', vol. 64, no. 4, October, 1983, 354–361&lt;/ref&gt; There are several different views of the nature of this gap among contemporary philosophers of mind. [[David Chalmers]] and the early [[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]] interpret the gap as [[ontology|ontological]] in nature; that is, they maintain that qualia can never be explained by science because [[physicalism]] is false. There are two separate categories involved and one cannot be reduced to the other.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, F. (1986) "What Mary didn't Know", Journal of Philosophy, 83, 5, pp. 291–295.&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative view is taken by philosophers such as [[Thomas Nagel]] and [[Colin McGinn]]. According to them, the gap is [[epistemology|epistemological]] in nature. For Nagel, science is not yet able to explain subjective experience because it has not yet arrived at the level or kind of knowledge that is required. We are not even able to formulate the problem coherently.&lt;ref name="Nagel" /&gt; For McGinn, on other hand, the problem is one of permanent and inherent biological limitations. We are not able to resolve the explanatory gap because the realm of subjective experiences is cognitively closed to us in the same manner that quantum physics is cognitively closed to elephants.&lt;ref&gt;McGinn, C. "Can the Mind-Body Problem Be Solved", ''Mind'', New Series, Volume 98, Issue 391, pp. 349–366. a [http://art-mind.org/review/IMG/pdf/McGinn_1989_Mind-body-problem_M.pdf (online)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928101441/http://art-mind.org/review/IMG/pdf/McGinn_1989_Mind-body-problem_M.pdf |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other philosophers liquidate the gap as purely a semantic problem. This semantic problem, of course, led to the famous "''Qualia Question''", which is: ''Does Red cause Redness''?

===Intentionality===
{{Main|Intentionality}}
[[File:John Searle 2002.jpg|thumb|[[John Searle]]—one of the most influential philosophers of mind, proponent of [[biological naturalism]] (Berkeley 2002)]]
[[Intentionality]] is the capacity of mental states to be directed towards (''about'') or be in relation with something in the external world.&lt;ref name="Searleint" /&gt; This property of mental states entails that they have [[mental content|contents]] and [[semantics|semantic referents]] and can therefore be assigned [[truth value]]s. When one tries to reduce these states to natural processes there arises a problem: natural processes are not true or false, they simply happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Fodor, Jerry | title=Psychosemantics. The problem of meaning in the philosophy of mind | publisher=MIT Press | location=Cambridge | year=1993 | isbn=978-0-262-06106-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It would not make any sense to say that a natural process is true or false. But mental ideas or judgments are true or false, so how then can mental states (ideas or judgments) be natural processes? The possibility of assigning semantic value to ideas must mean that such ideas are about facts. Thus, for example, the idea that [[Herodotus]] was a historian refers to Herodotus and to the fact that he was a historian. If the fact is true, then the idea is true; otherwise, it is false. But where does this relation come from? In the brain, there are only electrochemical processes and these seem not to have anything to do with Herodotus.&lt;ref name="Int" /&gt;

==Philosophy of perception==
{{Main|Philosophy of perception}}
[[Philosophy of perception]] is concerned with the nature of [[Perception|perceptual experience]] and the status of perceptual objects, in particular how perceptual experience relates to appearances and beliefs about the world. The main contemporary views within philosophy of perception include [[naive realism]], [[enactivism]] and [[Mental representation|representational]] views.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Macpherson, F. 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, S. (2011)."The Contents of Perception", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/perception-contents/.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy of mind and science==
Humans are corporeal beings and, as such, they are subject to examination and description by the natural sciences. Since mental processes are intimately related to bodily processes, the descriptions that the natural sciences furnish of human beings play an important role in the philosophy of mind.&lt;ref name="Kim1" /&gt; There are many scientific disciplines that study processes related to the mental. The list of such sciences includes: [[biology]], [[computer science]], [[cognitive science]], [[cybernetics]], [[linguistics]], [[medicine]], [[pharmacology]], and [[psychology]].&lt;ref name="Pinker"&gt;Pinker, S. (1997) ''How the Mind Works''. tr. It: ''Come Funziona la Mente''. Milan:Mondadori, 2000. {{ISBN|88-04-49908-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurobiology===
{{Main|Neuroscience}}
The theoretical background of biology, as is the case with modern [[natural science]]s in general, is fundamentally materialistic. The objects of study are, in the first place, physical processes, which are considered to be the foundations of mental activity and behavior.&lt;ref name="Bear"&gt;Bear, M. F. et al. Eds. (1995). ''Neuroscience: Exploring The Brain''. Baltimore, Maryland, Williams and Wilkins. {{ISBN|0-7817-3944-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing success of biology in the explanation of mental phenomena can be seen by the absence of any empirical refutation of its fundamental presupposition: "there can be no change in the mental states of a person without a change in brain states."&lt;ref name="Pinker" /&gt;

Within the field of neurobiology, there are many subdisciplines that are concerned with the relations between mental and physical states and processes:&lt;ref name="Bear" /&gt; [[Neurophysiology|Sensory neurophysiology]] investigates the relation between the processes of [[perception]] and [[stimulation]].&lt;ref name="Pinel"&gt;{{cite book | author=Pinel, J.P.J | title=Psychobiology | publisher=Prentice Hall | year=1997 | isbn=978-88-15-07174-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cognitive neuroscience]] studies the correlations between mental processes and neural processes.&lt;ref name="Pinel" /&gt; [[Neuropsychology]] describes the dependence of mental faculties on specific anatomical regions of the brain.&lt;ref name="Pinel" /&gt; Lastly, [[evolutionary biology]] studies the origins and development of the human nervous system and, in as much as this is the basis of the mind, also describes the [[ontogenesis|ontogenetic]] and [[phylogenesis|phylogenetic]] development of mental phenomena beginning from their most primitive stages.&lt;ref name="Pinker" /&gt; Evolutionary biology furthermore places tight constraints on any philosophical theory of the mind, as the [[gene]]-based mechanism of [[natural selection]] does not allow any giant leaps in the development of neural complexity or neural software but only incremental steps over long time periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Metzinger, Thomas | title=Being No One – The Self Model Theory of Subjectivity | publisher=MIT Press | location=Cambridge | year=2003 | pages=349–366 | isbn=978-0-262-13417-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Functional magnetic resonance imaging.jpg|thumb|Since the 1980s, sophisticated [[neuroimaging]] procedures, such as [[fMRI]] (above), have furnished increasing knowledge about the workings of the human brain, shedding light on ancient philosophical problems.]]

The [[methodology|methodological]] breakthroughs of the neurosciences, in particular the introduction of high-tech neuroimaging procedures, has propelled scientists toward the elaboration of increasingly ambitious research programs: one of the main goals is to describe and comprehend the neural processes which correspond to mental functions (see: [[neural correlate]]).&lt;ref name="Bear" /&gt; Several groups are inspired by these advances.

===Computer science===
{{Main|Computer science}}
Computer science concerns itself with the automatic processing of [[information]] (or at least with physical systems of symbols to which information is assigned) by means of such things as [[computer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Sipser, M.| title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation | location=Boston, Mass. | publisher=PWS Publishing Co. | isbn=978-0-534-94728-6 | year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the beginning, [[computer programmer]]s have been able to develop programs that permit computers to carry out tasks for which organic beings need a mind. A simple example is multiplication. It is not clear whether computers could be said to have a mind. Could they, someday, come to have what we call a mind? This question has been propelled into the forefront of much philosophical debate because of investigations in the field of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI).

Within AI, it is common to distinguish between a modest research program and a more ambitious one: this distinction was coined by [[John Searle]] in terms of a [[philosophy of artificial intelligence#Strong AI vs. weak AI|weak AI and strong AI]]. The exclusive objective of "weak AI", according to Searle, is the successful simulation of mental states, with no attempt to make computers become conscious or aware, etc. The objective of strong AI, on the contrary, is a computer with consciousness similar to that of human beings.&lt;ref name="Searle"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Searle, John | title=Minds, Brains and Programs | journal=The Behavioral and Brain Sciences | issue=3 | pages=417–424 |year=1980|url=http://cogprints.org/7150/1/10.1.1.83.5248.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program of strong AI goes back to one of the pioneers of computation [[Alan Turing]]. As an answer to the question "Can computers think?", he formulated the famous [[Turing test]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Turing 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turing believed that a computer could be said to "think" when, if placed in a room by itself next to another room that contained a human being and with the same questions being asked of both the computer and the human being by a third party human being, the computer's responses turned out to be indistinguishable from those of the human. Essentially, Turing's view of machine intelligence followed the behaviourist model of the mind—intelligence is as intelligence does. The Turing test has received many criticisms, among which the most famous is probably the [[Chinese room]] [[thought experiment]] formulated by Searle.&lt;ref name="Searle" /&gt;

The question about the possible sensitivity ([[qualia]]) of computers or robots still remains open. Some computer scientists believe that the specialty of AI can still make new contributions to the resolution of the "mind–body problem". They suggest that based on the reciprocal influences between software and hardware that takes place in all computers, it is possible that someday theories can be discovered that help us to understand the reciprocal influences between the human mind and the brain ([[wetware (brain)|wetware]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Russell, S.  |author2=Norvig, R.  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=Artificial Intelligence:A Modern Approach | location=New Jersey | publisher=Prentice Hall, Inc. | year=1995 | isbn=978-0-13-103805-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychology===
{{Main|Psychology}}
Psychology is the science that investigates mental states directly. It uses generally empirical methods to investigate concrete mental states like [[joy]], [[fear]] or [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|obsessions]]. Psychology investigates the laws that bind these mental states to each other or with inputs and outputs to the human organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.psychology.org | title=Encyclopedia of Psychology | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513103646/http://www.psychology.org/ | archivedate=2008-05-13 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of this is the [[Perception|psychology of perception]]. Scientists working in this field have discovered general principles of the [[Form perception|perception of forms]]. A law of the psychology of forms says that objects that move in the same direction are perceived as related to each other.&lt;ref name="Pinker" /&gt; This law describes a relation between visual input and mental perceptual states. However, it does not suggest anything about the nature of perceptual states. The laws discovered by psychology are compatible with all the answers to the mind–body problem already described.

===Cognitive science===
[[Cognitive science]] is the interdisciplinary scientific study of the mind and its processes.  It examines what [[cognition]] is, what it does, and how it works.  It includes research on intelligence and behavior, especially focusing on how information is represented, processed, and transformed (in faculties such as perception, language, memory, reasoning, and emotion) within nervous systems (human or other animal) and machines (e.g. computers). Cognitive science consists of multiple research disciplines, including [[psychology]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[philosophy]], [[neuroscience]], [[linguistics]], [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], and [[education]].&lt;ref&gt;Thagard, Paul, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/cognitive-science/ Cognitive Science], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.).&lt;/ref&gt; It spans many levels of analysis, from low-level learning and decision mechanisms to high-level logic and planning; from neural circuitry to modular brain organisation. [[Mark Rowlands|Rowlands]] argues  that cognition is  enactive, embodied, embedded, affective and (potentially) extended. The position is taken that the "classical sandwich" of cognition sandwiched between perception and action is artificial; cognition has to be seen as a product of a strongly coupled interaction that cannot be divided this way.&lt;ref name=Rowlands&gt;{{cite book |author=Mark Rowlands |authorlink=Mark Rowlands |chapter=Chapter 3: The mind embedded |pages=51 ''ff'' |year=2010 |isbn=978-0262014557 |publisher=MIT Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AiwjpL-0hDgC&amp;pg=PA51 |title=The new science of the mind: From extended mind to embodied phenomenology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ward&gt;{{cite book |author1=Dave Ward |author2=Mog Stapleton |year=2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y1E7FogqvJ0C&amp;pg=PA89 |chapter=Es are good.

==Philosophy of mind in the continental tradition==
Most of the discussion in this article has focused on one style or tradition of philosophy in modern Western culture, usually called [[analytic philosophy]] (sometimes described as Anglo-American philosophy).&lt;ref name="Dummett"&gt;{{cite book | author=Dummett, M.| title=Origini della Filosofia Analitica | publisher=Einaudi | year=2001 | isbn=978-88-06-15286-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other schools of thought exist, however, which are sometimes subsumed under the broad (and vague) label of [[continental philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Dummett" /&gt; In any case, though topics and methods here are numerous, in relation to the philosophy of mind the various schools that fall under this label ([[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[existentialism]], etc.) can globally be seen to differ from the analytic school in that they focus less on language and logical analysis alone but also take in other forms of understanding human existence and experience. With reference specifically to the discussion of the mind, this tends to translate into attempts to grasp the concepts of [[thought]] and [[experience|perceptual experience]] in some sense that does not merely involve the analysis of linguistic forms.&lt;ref name="Dummett" /&gt;

Immanuel Kant's ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', first published in 1781 and presented again with major revisions in 1787, represents a significant intervention into what will later become known as the philosophy of mind. Kant's first [[critique]] is generally recognized as among the most significant works of [[modern philosophy]] in the West. Kant is a figure whose influence is marked in both [[Continental philosophy|continental]] and analytic/Anglo-American philosophy. Kant's work develops an in-depth study of [[Transcendental idealism|transcendental]] consciousness, or the life of the mind as conceived through universal [[category (Kant)|categories]] of consciousness.

In [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s ''Philosophy of Mind'' (frequently translated as ''Philosophy of Spirit'' or [[Geist]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Hegel, G.W.F | title=Phenomenology of Spirit | isbn=978-0-19-503169-0| year=1983 }}, translated by A.V. Miller with analysis of the text and foreword by J. N. Findlay (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1977) {{ISBN|0-19-824597-1}} .&lt;/ref&gt; the third part of his ''[[Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences]]'', Hegel discusses three distinct types of mind: the "subjective mind/spirit", the mind of an individual; the "objective mind/spirit", the mind of society and of the State; and the "Absolute mind/spirit", the position of religion, art, and philosophy. See also Hegel's ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]''. Nonetheless, Hegel's work differs radically from the style of [[Anglosphere|Anglo-American]] philosophy of mind.

In 1896, [[Henri Bergson]] made in ''[[Matter and Memory]]'' "Essay on the relation of body and spirit" a forceful case for the ontological difference of body and mind by reducing the problem to the more definite one of memory, thus allowing for a solution built on the ''empirical test case'' of [[aphasia]].

In modern times, the two main schools that have developed in response or opposition to this Hegelian tradition are phenomenology and existentialism. Phenomenology, founded by [[Edmund Husserl]], focuses on the contents of the human mind (see [[noema]]) and how processes shape our experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Husserl, Edmund | title=Logische Untersuchungen | isbn=978-3-05-004391-3| year=2008 }} trans.: Giovanni Piana. Milan: EST. {{ISBN|88-428-0949-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Existentialism, a school of thought founded upon the work of [[Søren Kierkegaard]], focuses on Human predicament and how people deal with the situation of being alive. Existential-phenomenology represents a major branch of continental philosophy (they are not contradictory), rooted in the work of Husserl but expressed in its fullest forms in the work of [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]] and [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]]. See Heidegger's ''[[Being and Time]]'', Merleau-Ponty's ''[[Phenomenology of Perception]]'', Sartre's ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'', and Simone de Beauvoir's ''[[The Second Sex]]''.

==Mind in Eastern philosophy==

===Mind in Hindu philosophy===

====Dualism====
[[Cartesian dualism|Substance Dualism]] is a common feature of several [[Āstika and nāstika#Āstika|orthodox Hindu schools]] including the [[Sāṅkhya]], [[Nyāya]], [[Yoga]] and [[Dvaita Vedanta]]. In these schools a clear difference is drawn between matter and a non-material soul, which is eternal and undergoes [[samsara]], a cycle of death and rebirth. The [[Nyāya]] school argued that qualities such as cognition and desire are inherent qualities which are not possessed by anything solely material, and therefore by process of elimination must belong to a non-material self, the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/nyaya/#H2/|title=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004042359/http://www.iep.utm.edu/nyaya/#H2/|archivedate=2012-10-04|df=}} Nyāya, Matthew R. Dasti&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these schools see their spiritual goal as [[moksha]], liberation from the cycle of reincarnation.

====Vedanta monistic idealism====
[[File:Raja Ravi Varma - Sankaracharya.jpg|thumb|right|x200px|Śaṅkara]]
In the [[Advaita Vedanta]] of the 8th century Indian philosopher [[Śaṅkara]], the mind, body and world are all held to be the same unchanging eternal conscious entity called [[Brahman]]. Advaita, which means non-dualism, holds the view that all that exists is pure absolute [[consciousness]]. The fact that the world seems to be made up of changing entities is an illusion, or [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]. The only thing that exists is [[Brahman]], which is described as [[Satchitananda]] (Being, consciousness and bliss). Advaita Vedanta is best described by a verse which states "Brahman is alone True, and this world of plurality is an error; the individual self is not different from Brahman."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/adv-veda/|title=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626101653/http://www.iep.utm.edu/adv-veda/|archivedate=2015-06-26|df=}} Advaita Vedanta, Sangeetha Menon&lt;/ref&gt;

Another form of monistic Vedanta is [[Vishishtadvaita]] (qualified non-dualism) as posited by the eleventh century philosopher [[Ramanuja]]. Ramanuja criticized Advaita Vedanta by arguing that consciousness is always [[intentionality|intentional]] and that it is also always a property of something. Ramanuja's Brahman is defined by a multiplicity of qualities and properties in a single monistic entity. This doctrine is called "[[samanadhikaranya]]" (several things in a common substrate).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/ramanuja|title=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717055536/http://www.iep.utm.edu/ramanuja/|archivedate=2014-07-17|df=}} Ramanuja, Shyam Ranganathan&lt;/ref&gt;

====Materialism====
Arguably the first exposition of [[empiricism|empirical]] [[materialism]] in the history of philosophy is in the [[Cārvāka]] school (also called Lokāyata). The Cārvāka school rejected the existence of anything but matter (which they defined as being made up of the [[four elements]]), including God and the soul. Therefore, they held that even consciousness was nothing but a construct made up of atoms. A section of the Cārvāka school believed in a material soul made up of air or breath, but since this also was a form of matter, it was not said to survive death.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/indmat/#H1|title=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611095345/http://www.iep.utm.edu/indmat/#H1|archivedate=2010-06-11|df=}} Lokāyata/Cārvāka – Indian Materialism, Abigail Turner-Lauck Wernicki&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhist philosophy of mind===
{{PancaKhandha}}
Buddhist teachings describe that the mind manifests moment-to-moment as sense impressions and mental phenomena that are continuously changing.&lt;ref name=Aggregates&gt;{{cite journal |author=Karunamuni N.D. |title=The Five-Aggregate Model of the Mind |journal=SAGE Open |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=215824401558386 |date=May 2015 |url=http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/spsgo/5/2/2158244015583860.full.pdf |doi=10.1177/2158244015583860 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921004343/http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/spsgo/5/2/2158244015583860.full.pdf |archivedate=2016-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The moment-by-moment manifestation of the mind-stream has been described as happening in every person all the time, even in a scientist who analyses various phenomena in the world, or analyses the material body including the organ brain.&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt; The manifestation of the mind-stream is also described as being influenced by physical laws, biological laws, psychological laws, volitional laws, and universal laws.&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt;

A salient feature of [[Buddhist philosophy]] which sets it apart from Indian orthodoxy is the centrality of the doctrine of [[Anatta|not-self]] ([[Pāli]]. anatta, Skt. anātman). The Buddha's not-self doctrine sees humans as an impermanent composite of five psychological and physical aspects instead of a single fixed self. In this sense, what is called ego or the self is merely a convenient fiction, an illusion that does not apply to anything real but to an erroneous way of looking at the ever-changing stream of [[five aggregates|five interconnected aggregate factors]].&lt;ref name="Coseru"&gt;{{citation|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mind-indian-buddhism/|title= Coseru, Christian, "Mind in Indian Buddhist Philosophy"}}, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2012 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between these aggregates is said to be one of dependent-arising ([[pratītyasamutpāda]]). This means that all things, including mental events, arise co-dependently from a plurality of other causes and conditions. This seems to reject both [[determinism|causal determinist]] and [[epiphenomenalism|epiphenomenalist]] conceptions of mind.&lt;ref name="Coseru" /&gt;

====Abhidharma theories of mind====
Three centuries after the death of the Buddha (c. 150 BCE) saw the growth of a large body of literature called the [[Abhidharma]] in several contending [[Buddhist schools]]. In the Abhidharmic analysis of mind, the ordinary thought is defined as [[prapañca]] ('conceptual proliferation'). According to this theory, perceptual experience is bound up in multiple conceptualizations (expectations, judgments and desires). This proliferation of conceptualizations form our illusory superimposition of concepts like [[self]] and [[Other (philosophy)|other]] upon an ever-changing stream of aggregate phenomena.&lt;ref name="Coseru" /&gt;
In this conception of mind no strict distinction is made between the conscious faculty and the actual sense perception of various phenomena. Consciousness is instead said to be divided into six sense modalities, five for the [[five senses]] and sixth for perception of mental phenomena.&lt;ref name="Coseru" /&gt; The arising of cognitive awareness is said to depend on sense perception, awareness of the mental faculty itself which is termed mental or 'introspective awareness' (''manovijñāna'') and attention (''āvartana''), the picking out of objects out of the constantly changing stream of sensory impressions.

Rejection of a permanent agent eventually led to the philosophical problems of the seeming continuity of mind and also of explaining how [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]] and [[Karma in Buddhism|karma]] continue to be relevant doctrines without an eternal mind. This challenge was met by the [[Theravāda]] school by introducing the concept of mind as a factor of existence. This "life-stream" ([[Bhavanga]]-sota) is an undercurrent  forming the condition of being. The continuity of a karmic "person" is therefore assured in the form of a [[mindstream]] (citta-santana), a series of flowing mental moments arising from the subliminal life-continuum mind ([[Bhavanga]]-citta), mental content, and attention.&lt;ref name="Coseru" /&gt;

====Indian Mahayana====
The [[Sautrāntika]] school held a form of [[phenomenalism]] that saw the world as imperceptible. It held that external objects exist only as a support for cognition, which can only apprehend mental representations. This influenced the later [[Yogācāra]] school of [[Mahayana Buddhism]]. The Yogācāra school is often called the mind-only school because of its [[Internalism and externalism#Philosophy of mind|internalist]] stance that consciousness is the ultimate existing reality. The works of [[Vasubandhu]] have often been interpreted as arguing for some form of [[Idealism]]. Vasubandhu uses the [[dream argument]] and a [[mereology|mereological]] refutation of atomism to attack the reality of external objects as anything other than mental entities.&lt;ref name="Gold"&gt;{{citation|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/vasubandhu/|title=Gold, Jonathan C., "Vasubandhu"|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201232037/http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/vasubandhu/|archivedate=2012-12-01|df=}}, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2012 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; Scholarly interpretations of Vasubandhu's philosophy vary widely, and include phenomenalism, [[neutral monism]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)#Realist phenomenology|realist phenomenology]].

The Indian [[Schools of Buddhism#Mahāyāna schools|Mahayana schools]] were divided on the issue of the possibility of reflexive awareness (''[[svasaṃvedana]]''). [[Dharmakīrti]] accepted the idea of reflexive awareness as expounded by the Yogācāra school, comparing it to a lamp that illuminates itself while also illuminating other objects. This was strictly rejected by [[Mādhyamika]] scholars like [[Candrakīrti]]. Since in the philosophy of the Mādhyamika all things and mental events are characterized by [[Shunyata|emptiness]], they argued that consciousness could not be an inherently reflexive ultimate reality since that would mean it was self-validating and therefore not characterized by emptiness.&lt;ref name="Coseru" /&gt; These views were ultimately reconciled by the 8th century thinker [[Śāntarakṣita]]. In Śāntarakṣita's synthesis he adopts the idealist Yogācāra views of reflexive awareness as a conventional truth into the structure of the [[two truths doctrine]]. Thus he states: "By relying on the Mind-Only system, know that external entities do not exist. And by relying on this Middle Way system, know that no self exists at all, even in that [mind]." &lt;ref name="Blumenthal"&gt;{{citation|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/saantarak-sita/|title= Blumenthal, James, "Śāntarakṣita"}}, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (fall 2009 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yogācāra school also developed the theory of the [[Vijñāna#Eight vijñānas|repository consciousness]] (''ālayavijñāna'') to explain continuity of mind in [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]] and accumulation of [[karma]]. This repository consciousness acts as a storehouse for karmic seeds ([[Bīja|bija]]) when all other senses are absent during the process of death and rebirth as well as being the causal potentiality of [[Dharma (Buddhism)#Dharmas in Buddhist phenomenology|dharmic phenomena]].&lt;ref name="Coseru" /&gt; Thus according to [[B. Alan Wallace]]: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;No constituents of the body—in the brain or elsewhere—transform into mental states and processes. Such subjective experiences do not emerge from the body, but neither do they emerge from nothing. Rather, all objective mental appearances arise from the substrate, and all subjective mental states and processes arise from the substrate consciousness.&lt;ref name="Wallace"&gt;B. Alan Wallace; [https://books.google.com/books?id=WeUYBQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Mind in the Balance: Meditation in Science, Buddhism, and Christianity], p. 95–96&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Tibetan Buddhism====
[[Tibetan Buddhist]] theories of mind evolved directly from the Indian Mahayana views. Thus the founder of the [[Gelug]] school, [[Je Tsongkhapa]] discusses the Yogācāra system of the [[Eight Consciousnesses]] in his ''Explanation of the Difficult Points''.&lt;ref name="Sparham"&gt;{{citation|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2011/entries/tsongkhapa/|title= Sparham, Gareth, "Tsongkhapa"}}, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (fall 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; He would later come to repudiate [[Śāntarakṣita]]'s pragmatic [[idealism]]. 
According to the [[14th Dalai Lama]] the mind can be defined "as an entity that has the nature of mere experience, that is, 'clarity and knowing'. It is the knowing nature, or agency, that is called mind, and this is non-material."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.lamayeshe.com/index.php?sect=article&amp;id=417|title=Talk by His Holiness the Dalai Lama at Cambridge, MA USA|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019213407/http://www.lamayeshe.com/index.php?sect=article&amp;id=417|archivedate=2013-10-19|df=}}, From MindScience, edited by Daniel Goleman and Robert F. Thurman, first in 1991 by Wisdom Publications, Boston, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; The simultaneously dual nature of mind is as follows:
:: 1. '''Clarity''' (''gsal'') – The mental activity which produces cognitive phenomena (''snang-ba'').
:: 2. '''Knowing''' (''rig'') – The mental activity of perceiving cognitive phenomena.
The 14th Dalai Lama has also explicitly laid out his theory of mind as '''experiential dualism''' which is described above under the different types of dualism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Because Tibetan philosophy of mind is ultimately [[soteriology|soteriological]], it focuses on meditative practices such as [[Dzogchen]] and [[Mahamudra]] that allow a practitioner to experience the true reflexive nature of their mind directly. This unobstructed knowledge of one's primordial, empty and non-dual [[Buddha nature]] is called [[rigpa]].  The mind's innermost nature is described among various schools as pure luminosity or "clear light" ([[Ösel (yoga)|'od gsal]]) and is often compared to a crystal ball or a mirror. [[Sogyal Rinpoche]] speaks of mind thus:
"Imagine a sky, empty, spacious, and pure from the beginning; its essence is like this. Imagine a sun, luminous, clear, unobstructed, and spontaneously present; its nature is like this."

====Zen Buddhism====
The central issue in Chinese Zen philosophy of mind is in the difference between the pure and awakened mind and the defiled mind. Chinese Chan master [[Huangbo Xiyun|Huangpo]] described the mind as without beginning and without form or limit while the defiled mind was that which was obscured by attachment to form and concepts.&lt;ref name="Zeuschner"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/HistoricalZen/Understanding_mind_in_NorthernChan.htm|title=Zeuschner, Robert B., "The Understanding of Mind in the Northern Line of Ch'an (Zen)"|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120822105440/http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/HistoricalZen/Understanding_mind_in_NorthernChan.htm|archivedate=2012-08-22|df=}}, Philosophy East and West, V. 28, No. 1 (January 1978), pp. 69–79, University of Hawaii Press, Hawaii, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;  The pure Buddha-mind is thus able to see things "as they truly are", as absolute and non-dual "thusness" ([[Tathatā/Dharmatā|Tathatā]]). This non-conceptual seeing also includes the paradoxical fact that there is no difference between a defiled and a pure mind, as well as no difference between [[samsara]] and [[nirvana]].&lt;ref name="Zeuschner"/&gt;

In the [[Shobogenzo]], the Japanese philosopher [[Dogen]] argued that body and mind are neither ontologically nor phenomenologically distinct but are characterized by a oneness called ''shin jin'' (bodymind). According to Dogen, "casting off body and mind" (''Shinjin datsuraku'') in [[zazen]] will allow one to experience things-as-they-are (''genjokoan'') which is the nature of original enlightenment (''[[hongaku]]'').&lt;ref name="Shaner"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/HistoricalZen/Understanding_mind_in_NorthernChan.htm|title=David E.

==Topics related to philosophy of mind==
There are countless subjects that are affected by the ideas developed in the philosophy of mind. Clear examples of this are the nature of [[death]] and its definitive character, the nature of [[emotion]], of [[perception]] and of [[memory]]. Questions about what a [[person]] is and what his or her [[Personal identity|identity]] consists of also have much to do with the philosophy of mind. There are two subjects that, in connection with the philosophy of the mind, have aroused special attention: [[free will]] and the [[self (philosophy)|self]].&lt;ref name="Kim1" /&gt;

===Free will===
{{Main| Free will}}
In the context of philosophy of mind, the problem of free will takes on renewed intensity. This is certainly the case, at least, for materialistic [[determinism|determinists]].&lt;ref name="Kim1" /&gt; According to this position, natural laws completely determine the course of the material world. Mental states, and therefore the will as well, would be material states, which means human behavior and decisions would be completely determined by natural laws. Some take this reasoning a step further: people cannot determine by themselves what they want and what they do. Consequently, they are not free.&lt;ref name="Hond"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctytho/dfwIntroIndex.htm | title=Philosopher Ted Honderich's Determinism web resource | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516062050/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctytho/dfwIntroIndex.htm | archivedate=2008-05-16 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This argumentation is rejected, on the one hand, by the [[compatibilism|compatibilists]]. Those who adopt this position suggest that the question "Are we free?" can only be answered once we have determined what the term "free" means. The opposite of "free" is not "caused" but "compelled" or "coerced". It is not appropriate to identify freedom with indetermination. A free act is one where the agent could have done otherwise if it had chosen otherwise. In this sense a person can be free even though determinism is true.&lt;ref name="Hond" /&gt; The most important compatibilist in the history of the philosophy was [[David Hume]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Paul, ''Freedom and Moral Sentiment: Hume's Way of Naturalizing Responsibility'' Oxford University Press: New York &amp; Oxford, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, this position is defended, for example, by [[Daniel Dennett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Dennett, Daniel | title=The Varieties of Free Will Worth Wanting | publisher=Bradford Books–MIT Press |location=Cambridge MA | year=1984 |isbn=978-0-262-54042-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, there are also many [[incompatibilism|incompatibilists]] who reject the argument because they believe that the will is free in a stronger sense called [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarianism]].&lt;ref name="Hond" /&gt; These philosophers affirm the course of the world is either a) not completely determined by natural law where natural law is intercepted by physically independent agency,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=René|last=Descartes|year=1649|title=Passions of the Soul|isbn=978-0-87220-035-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; b) determined by indeterministic natural law only, or c) determined by indeterministic natural law in line with the subjective effort of physically non-reducible agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kane |first=Robert |year=2009 |title=Libertarianism |journal=Philosophical Studies |volume=144 |issue=1 |page=39 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/g2vg712u87804766 |doi= 10.1007/s11098-009-9365-y }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Libertarianism, the will does not have to be deterministic and, therefore, it is potentially free. Critics of the second proposition (b) accuse the incompatibilists of using an incoherent concept of freedom. They argue as follows: if our will is not determined by anything, then we desire what we desire by pure chance. And if what we desire is purely accidental, we are not free. So if our will is not determined by anything, we are not free.&lt;ref name="Hond" /&gt;

===Self===
{{Main|Philosophy of self}}
The philosophy of mind also has important consequences for the concept of "self". If by "self" or "I" one refers to an essential, immutable nucleus of the ''person'', some modern philosophers of mind, such as [[Daniel Dennett]] believe that no such thing exists. According to Dennett and other contemporaries, the self is considered an illusion.&lt;ref name="DHof"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Dennett, C.  |author2=Hofstadter, D.R.  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=The Mind's I | publisher=Bantam Books | year=1981 |isbn=978-0-553-01412-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of a self as an immutable essential nucleus derives from the idea of an [[soul|immaterial soul]]. Such an idea is unacceptable to modern philosophers with physicalist orientations and their general skepticism of the concept of "self" as postulated by [[David Hume]], who could never catch himself ''not'' doing, thinking or feeling anything.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Searle, John | title=Mind: A Brief Introduction | publisher=Oxford University Press Inc, USA  | date=1 November 2004|isbn=978-0-19-515733-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the light of empirical results from [[developmental psychology]], [[developmental biology]] and [[neuroscience]], the idea of an essential inconstant, material nucleus—an integrated representational system distributed over changing patterns of synaptic connections—seems reasonable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=LeDoux, Joseph | title=The Synaptic Self | location=New York | publisher=Viking Penguin | year=2002 | isbn=978-88-7078-795-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Princess Christian Maternity Hospital''' is a [[hospital]] in [[Freetown]], [[Sierra Leone]] nicknamed the 'Cottage Hospital'. On May 2006 [[Ahmad Tejan Kabbah]] re-opened the hospital alongside [[Connaught Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = Historical Background of Re-Opening Hospitals  | publisher = Ministry of Health &amp; Sanitation  | year = 2006  | url = http://www.health.sl/hosp_history.htm | accessdate = 2008-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==2014 Ebola epicemic==
Princess Christian Maternity hospital came under severe pressure during the [[2014 Ebola virus epidemic in Sierra Leone]]. Scientific studies have shown that pregnant women are amongst the least likely to survive an onset of [[ebola]], most likely because the mother's body lowers its [[immune response]] to prevent it rejecting the baby.&lt;ref name="Lang"&gt;{{cite news |first=Joshua |last=Lang |date=29 October 2014 |title=Ebola in the Maternity Ward |newspaper=The New Yorker |url=http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/ebola-maternity-ward}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a previous outbreak in [[Zaire]], 14 out of 15 pregnant women who contracted the disease died.&lt;ref name="Lang"/&gt; With the country's health facilities completely overrun and already unable to cope with the patient numbers, the authorities decided to place pregnant women last in the queue for treatment, and also segregated them from other ebola patients, under the assumption that there was little that could be done to save them.&lt;ref name="Lang"/&gt; Most of the pregnant ebola patients were sent to Princess Christian, but with health resources committed elsewhere, the hospital was severely neglected and conditions were so bad that the [[United Nations]] proposed closing the hospital altogether.&lt;ref name="Lang"/&gt;

'''Reward-based selection''' is a technique used in [[evolutionary algorithm]]s for selecting potentially useful solutions for recombination. 
The probability of being selected for an individual is proportional to the cumulative reward, obtained by the individual. The cumulative reward can be computed as a sum of the individual reward and the reward, inherited from parents. 

==Description==
Reward-based selection can be used within [[Multi-armed bandit]] framework for [[Multi-objective optimization]] to obtain a better approximation of the [[Pareto efficiency|Pareto front]].

The newborn &lt;math&gt;a'^{(g+1)}&lt;/math&gt; and its parents receive a reward &lt;math&gt;r^{(g)}&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;a'^{(g+1)}&lt;/math&gt; was selected for new population &lt;math&gt;Q^{(g+1)}&lt;/math&gt;, otherwise the reward is zero. 
Several reward definitions are possible:

*1. &lt;math&gt; r^{(g)}=1&lt;/math&gt;, if the newborn individual &lt;math&gt;a'^{(g+1)}&lt;/math&gt; was selected for new population &lt;math&gt;Q^{(g+1)}&lt;/math&gt;.
*2. &lt;math&gt; r^{(g)} = 1 - \frac{rank(a'^{(g+1)})}{\mu} \mbox{ if } a'^{(g+1)} \in Q^{(g+1)} &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;rank(a'^{(g+1)})&lt;/math&gt; is the rank of newly inserted individual in the population of &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; individuals. Rank can be computed using a well-known [[non-dominated sorting]] procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deb|first1=K.|last2=Pratap|first2=A.|last3=Agarwal|first3=S.|last4=Meyarivan|first4=T.|title=A fast and elitist multi-objective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II|journal=IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation|volume=6|issue=2|pages=182–197|year=2002|doi=10.1109/4235.996017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*3. &lt;math&gt; r^{(g)} = \sum_{a\in Q^{(g+1)}} \Delta{H}(a,Q^{(g+1)}) - \sum_{a\in Q^{(g)}} \Delta{H}(a,Q^{(g)})&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Delta{H}(a,Q^{(g)})&lt;/math&gt; is the [[hypervolume indicator]] contribution of the individual &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to the population &lt;math&gt;Q^{(g)}&lt;/math&gt;. The reward &lt;math&gt;r^{(g)}&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; if the newly inserted individual improves the quality of the population, which is measured as its hypervolume contribution in the objective space.
*4. A relaxation of the above reward, involving a rank-based penalization for points for &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-th dominated Pareto front: &lt;math&gt; r^{(g)} =  \frac{1}{2^{k-1}} \left( \sum_{ndom_k(Q^{(g+1)})} \Delta{H}(a,ndom_k(Q^{(g+1)})) - \sum_{ndom_k(Q^{(g)})}  \Delta{H}(a,ndom_k(Q^{(g)})) \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Reward-based selection can quickly identify the most fruitful directions of search by maximizing the cumulative reward of individuals.

'''Smoky''' (c. 1943 &amp;ndash; 21 February 1957), a [[Yorkshire Terrier]] was a famous [[war dog]] who served in [[World War II]].  She weighed only {{convert|4|lb}} and stood {{convert|7|in}} tall. Smoky is credited with beginning a renewal of interest in the once obscure Yorkshire Terrier breed.&lt;ref&gt;''Popular Dog'', 2001 and ''Dog Fancy'', 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Discovery and purchase===
In February 1944, Smoky was found by an [[United States|American]] soldier in an abandoned [[Defensive fighting position|foxhole]] in the [[New Guinea]] jungle.  She was already a young adult Yorkie (fully grown).  The soldiers initially thought the small dog belonged to the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]], but after taking her to a nearby [[prisoner-of-war]] camp they realized she did not understand commands in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] or [[English language|English]]. Another [[GI (military)|GI]] then sold Smoky to Corporal [[Bill Wynne|William A. Wynne]] of [[Cleveland, Ohio]], for two [[Australian pound]]s (equal to $6.44 at that time)&amp;mdash;the price paid to the seller so he could return to his [[poker]] game.&lt;ref name=SmokyIndex&gt; Wynne, William A.

===World War II===

For the next two years, Smoky back-packed through the rest of the war and accompanied Wynne on combat flights in the [[Pacific]].  She faced adverse circumstances, living in the New Guinea jungle and [[Rock Islands]], suffering the primitive conditions of tents in equatorial heat and humidity.&lt;ref name=SmokyBook&gt; Wynne, William A.  "Yorkie Doodle Dandy: 4 Pound Yorkshire Terrier Hero of World War II", Book.  Retrieved from {{cite web |url=http://www.smokywardog.com/book.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061125205141/http://www.smokywardog.com/book.php |archivedate=2006-11-25 |df= }} on 2007-02-15.&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout her service, Smoky slept in Wynne's tent on a blanket made from a green felt card table cover; she shared Wynne's [[C-ration]]s and an occasional can of [[Spam (food)|Spam]]. Unlike the "official" [[dogs in warfare|war dogs]] of World War II, Smoky had access to neither [[veterinary medicine]] nor a [[balanced diet]] formulated especially for dogs.&lt;ref name=SmokyBook/&gt;  In spite of this, Smoky was never ill.  She even ran on [[coral]] for four months without developing any of the [[paw]] ailments that plagued some war dogs.&lt;ref name=SmokyBook/&gt;

As described by Wynne, "Smoky Served in the [[Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]] with the 5th [[Air Force]], 26th Photo [[Reconnaissance|Recon]] Squadron [and] flew 12 air/sea rescue and photo reconnaissance missions."&lt;ref name=Kohl&gt;Kohl, Joyce (1998-01-30), "Go Inside ''Yorkie Doodle Dandy''".  Retrieved from {{cite web |url=http://goinside.com/98/1/yorkie.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070418101707/http://goinside.com/98/1/yorkie.html |archivedate=2007-04-18 |df= }} on 2007-02-15.&lt;/ref&gt;  On those flights, Smoky spent long hours dangling in a soldier's pack near [[machine gun]]s used to ward off enemy fighters.&lt;ref name=PatsyAnn/&gt;  Smoky was credited with twelve [[Military operation|combat missions]] and awarded eight [[battle star]]s.&lt;ref name=OliveDrab&gt;"WW II K-9: Smoky", Olive-Drab.com.  Retrieved from http://www.olive-drab.com/od_wardogs_famous_smoky.php on 2007-02-15.&lt;/ref&gt;  She survived 150 [[airstrike|air raids]] on New Guinea and made it through a [[typhoon]] at [[Okinawa]].&lt;ref name=SmokyBook/&gt;  Smoky even parachuted from {{convert|30|ft}} in the air, out of a tree, using a [[parachute]] made just for her. Wynne credited Smoky with saving his life by warning him of incoming [[Shell (projectile)|shells]] on an [[Landing Ship, Tank|LST]] (transport ship), calling her an "angel from a foxhole."  As the ship deck was booming and vibrating from [[anti-aircraft]] gunnery, Smoky guided Wynne to duck the fire that hit eight men standing next to them.&lt;ref name=PatsyAnn/&gt;

In the down time, Smoky learned numerous tricks, which she performed for the entertainment of troops with [[Special Services (entertainment)|Special Services]] and in hospitals from [[Australia]] to [[Korea]].&lt;ref name=SmokyIndex/&gt;  According to Wynne, Smoky taught him as much as he taught her, and she developed a repertoire beyond that of any dog of her day.&lt;ref name=PatsyAnn/&gt;  In 1944, ''[[Yank, the Army Weekly|Yank Down Under]]'' magazine named Smoky the "Champion [[Mascot]] in the Southwest Pacific Area."&lt;ref name=Kohl/&gt;

Smoky's tricks enabled her to become a hero in her own right by helping engineers to build an airbase at [[Lingayen Gulf]], [[Luzon]], a crucial airfield for [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[Fighter aircraft|war planes]].&lt;ref name=Kohl/&gt;  Early in the [[Luzon]] campaign, the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]] needed to run a [[telegraph]] [[wire]] through a {{convert|70|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} pipe that was {{convert|8|in}} in diameter. Soil had sifted through the corrugated sections at the pipe joinings, filling as much as half of the pipe, giving Smoky only four inches of headway in some places. As Wynne himself told the story when he appeared on [[NBC-TV]] after World War II:

:“I tied a string (tied to the wire) to Smoky's collar and ran to the other end of the [[culvert]] . . . (Smoky) made a few steps in and then ran back.  `Come, Smoky,' I said sharply, and she started through again.  When she was about 10 feet in, the string caught up and she looked over her shoulder as much as to say `what's holding us up there?'  The string loosened from the snag and she came on again.  By now the dust was rising from the shuffle of her paws as she crawled through the dirt and mold and I could no longer see her.  I called and pleaded, not knowing for certain whether she was coming or not.  At last, about 20 feet away, I saw two little amber eyes and heard a faint whimpering sound . . . at 15 feet away, she broke into a run.  We were so happy at Smoky's success that we patted and praised her for a full five minutes.”

Smoky’s work saved approximately 250 ground crewmen from having to move around and keep operational 40 [[United States]] [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] and reconnaissance planes, while a construction detail dug up the [[taxiway]], placing the men and the planes in danger from enemy [[Firebombing|bombings]].&lt;ref&gt;"A Tribute to the War Dogs of the United States Military".  Retrieved from http://www.eagleid.com/veterans/dogs.htm on 2007-02-15.&lt;/ref&gt;  What would have been a dangerous three-day digging task to place the wire was instead completed by this little dog in minutes.&lt;ref name=SmokyBook/&gt;

===After the war===
At the end of their return, Wynne and Smoky were featured in a page one story with photographs in the ''[[Cleveland Press]]'' on December 7, 1945.  Smoky soon became a national sensation.&lt;ref name=Kohl/&gt;  Over the next 10 years, Smoky and Wynne traveled to [[Hollywood]] and all over the world to perform demonstrations of her remarkable skills, which included walking a [[Tightrope walking|tightrope]] while blindfolded.&lt;ref name=PatsyAnn/&gt;  She appeared with Wynne on some of the earliest [[TV shows]] in the Cleveland area, including a show of their own on Cleveland's [[WKYC-TV|WKYC Channel 3]] called ''Castles in the Air'', featuring some of Smoky’s unbelievable tricks.&lt;ref name=Simon&gt;Simon, Ron (2004-08-08), "Veteran's dog was a loved mascot for unit during World War II", ''News Journal''.  Retrieved from http://www.yorkierescue.com/articlebill.html on 2007-02-10.&lt;/ref&gt;  Smoky performed in 42 [[live television|live-television]] shows without ever repeating a trick.&lt;ref name=PatsyAnn/&gt;  Smoky and Wynne were also very popular entertainers at the [[veteran|veterans']] hospitals. According to Wynne, “after the war Smoky entertained millions during late 1940s and early 1950s."&lt;ref name="Kohl" /&gt;

On February 21, 1957, "Corporal" Smoky died unexpectedly at the approximate age of 14. Wynne and his family buried Smoky in a World War II .30 caliber ammo box in the Cleveland Metroparks, Rocky River Reservation in Lakewood, Ohio.&lt;ref name="PatsyAnn" /&gt;

Nearly 50 years later, on Veterans Day, November 11, 2005, a bronze life-size sculpture, by Susan Bahary, of Smoky sitting in a GI helmet, atop a two-ton blue granite base, was unveiled there. It is placed above the very spot that Smoky was laid at her final resting place.

==First therapy dog==
According to an [[Animal Planet]] investigation, Smoky was the first recorded [[therapy dog]].  Her service in this arena began in July 1944 at the 233rd Station Hospital in [[New Guinea]], where she accompanied nurses to see the incoming battlefield [[Casualty (person)|casualties]] from the [[Biak Island]] invasion.&lt;ref name=SmokyBook/&gt;  Smoky was already a celebrity of sorts, as her photograph was in ''Yank'' magazine at the same time, which made it easy to get permission. [[Charles William Mayo|Dr. Charles Mayo]], of the famed [[Mayo Clinic]], was the [[commanding officer]] who allowed Smoky to go on rounds and also permitted her to sleep with Wynne in his hospital bed for five nights.&lt;ref name=OliveDrab/&gt;  Smoky’s work as a therapy dog continued for 12 years, during and after World War II &lt;ref name=SmokyBook/&gt;

==Yorkie Doodle Dandy==
''Yorkie Doodle Dandy: Or, the Other Woman Was a Real Dog'', is a book authored by Bill Wynne. It is the memoir of his time with Smoky during World War II and thereafter.  It features highlights of their service in the Pacific and their adventures in Hollywood, as well as advice on [[dog training]], Yorkshire Terrier [[FAQ]]s, and more. The book tells the story of how Smoky was given a promotion to "[[corporal]]" and even explains how this Yorkshire Terrier ended up in New Guinea.&lt;ref name=Kohl/&gt;  Originally published in 1996 by Wynnesome Press, it is currently in its 5th edition, by Top Dog Enterprises, LLC.

'''Steven Albert Benner''' (born October 23, 1954) has been a professor at [[Harvard University]], [[ETH Zurich]], and the [[University of Florida]] where he was the V.T. &amp; Louise Jackson Distinguished Professor of Chemistry. In 2005, he founded The Westheimer Institute of Science and Technology (TWIST) and the Foundation For Applied Molecular Evolution.  Benner has also founded the companies EraGen Biosciences and Firebird BioMolecular Sciences LLC.

Benner and his colleagues were the first to synthesize a gene, beginning the field of [[synthetic biology]]. He was instrumental in establishing the field of [[paleogenetics]].  He is interested in the [[Abiogenesis|origin of life]] and the chemical conditions and processes needed to produce [[RNA]]. Benner has worked with [[NASA]] to develop detectors for alien genetic materials, using the definition of life developed by the NASA Exobiology Discipline Working Group in 1992, “a self-sustaining chemical system capable of Darwinian evolution”.&lt;ref name="Mullen"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mullen|first1=Leslie|title=Defining Life: Q&amp;A with Scientist Gerald Joyce|journal=Astrobiology Magazine|date=August 1, 2013|url=http://www.space.com/22210-life-definition-gerald-joyce-interview.html|accessdate=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Life"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benner|first1=Steven A.|title=Defining Life|journal=Astrobiology|date=December 2010|volume=10|issue=10|pages=1021–1030|doi=10.1089/ast.2010.0524|pmc=3005285|pmid=21162682|bibcode=2010AsBio..10.1021B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Klotz"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Klotz|first1=Irene|title=Synthetic life form grows in Florida lab|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/29430688/|accessdate=5 July 2016|work=Science|date=February 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lloyd"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lloyd|first1=Robin|title=New Artificial DNA Points to Alien Life|url=http://www.livescience.com/3332-artificial-dna-points-alien-life.html|accessdate=5 July 2016|work=LiveScience|date=February 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
Benner's research falls into four major areas: 
# expanding the genetic alphabet by synthesizing artificial structures

The Benner laboratory is an originator of the field of "[[synthetic biology]]", which seeks to generate, by [[chemical synthesis]], molecules that reproduce the complex behavior of living systems, including their genetics, inheritance, and evolution. Some high points of past work in chemical genetics are listed below.

===Gene synthesis===
In 1984, Benner's laboratory at Harvard was the first to report the chemical synthesis of a gene encoding an enzyme,&lt;ref name="Gross"&gt;{{cite journal

===Artificial genetic systems===
Efforts toward the goal of artificial genetic systems were first reported by Benner and coworkers in 1989, when they developed the first unnatural [[base pair]].&lt;ref name="Fikes"&gt;{{cite news

Benner is one of a number of researchers, including Eric T. Kool, Floyd E. Romesberg,  Ichiro Hirao, Mitsuhiko Shionoya and Andrew Ellington, who have created an extended alphabet of synthetic bases that can be incorporated into DNA (as well as RNA) using Watson-Crick bonding (as well as non-Watson-Crick bonding). While most of these synthetic bases are derivatives of the A, C, G, T bases, some are different. While some are in Watson-Crick pairs (A/T, C/G), some are self complementing (X/X). Thus the genetic alphabet has been expanded.&lt;ref name="Howgego"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Matsuda"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Matsuda|first1=Shigeo|last2=Fillo|first2=Jeremiah D.|last3=Henry|first3=Allison A.|last4=Rai|first4=Priyamrada|last5=Wilkens|first5=Steven J.|last6=Dwyer|first6=Tammy J.|last7=Geierstanger|first7=Bernhard H.|last8=Wemmer|first8=David E.|last9=Schultz|first9=Peter G.|last10=Spraggon|first10=Glen|last11=Romesberg|first11=Floyd E.|title=Efforts toward Expansion of the Genetic Alphabet:  Structure and Replication of Unnatural Base Pairs|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|date=August 2007|volume=129|issue=34|pages=10466–10473|doi=10.1021/ja072276d|pmc=2536688|pmid=17685517}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Piccirilli"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pollack"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pollack|first1=Andrew|title=Scientists Are Starting to Add Letters to Life's Alphabet|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/24/health/genetics/24DNA.html|accessdate=30 June 2016|work=The New York Times|date=July 24, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Singer"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Singer|first1=Emily|title=New Letters Added to the Genetic Alphabet|url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/20150710-genetic-alphabet/|accessdate=30 June 2016|work=Quanta Magazine|date=July 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Switzer1993"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Switzer|first1=CY|last2=Moroney|first2=SE|last3=Benner|first3=SA|title=Enzymatic recognition of the base pair between isocytidine and isoguanosine.|journal=Biochemistry|date=5 October 1993|volume=32|issue=39|pages=10489–96|pmid=7691174|doi=10.1021/bi00090a027}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Takezawa"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Takezawa|first1=Yusuke|last2=Shionoya|first2=Mitsuhiko|title=Metal-Mediated DNA Base Pairing: Alternatives to Hydrogen-Bonded Watson–Crick Base Pairs|journal=Accounts of Chemical Research|date=18 December 2012|volume=45|issue=12|pages=2066–2076|doi=10.1021/ar200313h|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ar200313h?src=recsys&amp;journalCode=achre4|accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Simon"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Simon|first1=Matthew|title=Emergent computation emphasizing bioinformatics|date=2005|publisher=AIP Press/Springer Science+Business Media|location=New York|isbn=978-0-387-27270-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|88–98}}

The number of possible nucleotide triplets, or [[codons]], available in protein synthesis depends on the number of nucleotides available.  The standard alphabet (G, A, C, and T) yields 4&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 64 possible codons, while an expanded DNA alphabet with 9 DNA bases would have 9&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 729 possible codons, many of them synthetic codons.  For these codons to be useful, [[Aminoacyl tRNA synthetase]] has been created such that tRNA can code for the possibly synthetic amino acid to be coupled with its corresponding synthetic anti-codon.  Brenner has described such a system which uses synthetic iso-C/iso-G DNA which uses the synthetic DNA codon [iso-C/A/G] which he calls the 65th codon. Synthetic mRNA with synthetic anti-codon [iso-G/U/C] with synthetic aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase results in an ''in vivo'' experiment that can code for a synthetic amino acid incorporated into synthetic polypeptides (synthetic [[proteomics]]).&lt;ref name="Simon"/&gt;{{rp|100–106}}

===A "second generation" model for nucleic acids===
Benner has used synthetic organic chemistry and biophysics to create a "second generation" model for nucleic acid structure. The first generation model of DNA was proposed by [[James Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]], based on crystallized X-ray structures being studied by [[Rosalind Franklin]].  According to the [[double-helix]] model, DNA is composed of two complementary strands of nucleotides coiled around each other.&lt;ref name="pmid13168976"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Watson JD, Crick FH | title = The structure of DNA | journal = Cold Spring Harb.

In 2004, Benner reported the first successful attempt to design an artificial DNA-like molecule capable of reproducing itself.&lt;ref name="Gramling"/&gt;

===Genome sequencing and protein structure prediction===
In the late 1980s, Benner recognized the potential for genome sequencing projects to generate millions of sequences and enable researchers to do extensive mapping of molecular structures in organic chemistry. In the early 1990s, Benner met [[Gaston Gonnet]], beginning a collaboration that applied Gonnet's tools for text searching to the management of protein sequences.&lt;ref name="key"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prof. Gaston Gonnet: when technology holds the key to evolution|url=https://www.inf.ethz.ch/news-and-events/spotlights/gonnet-farewell.html|accessdate=9 July 2016|website=ETH Zurich}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Exhaustive"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gonnet|first1=GH|last2=Cohen|first2=MA|last3=Benner|first3=SA|title=Exhaustive matching of the entire protein sequence database.|journal=Science|date=5 June 1992|volume=256|issue=5062|pages=1443–5|pmid=1604319|url=http://www.ffame.org/pubs/Exhaustive%20matching%20of%20the%20entire%20protein%20sequence%20database.pdf|accessdate=9 July 2016|doi=10.1126/science.1604319|bibcode=1992Sci...256.1443G}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, in collaboration with [[Gaston Gonnet]], the Benner laboratory introduced the DARWIN bioinformatics workbench. DARWIN (Data Analysis and Retrieval With Indexed Nucleic acid-peptide sequences) was a high-level programming environment for examining genomic sequences. It supported the matching of genomic sequences in databases, and generated information that showed how natural proteins could divergently evolve under functional constraints by accumulating mutations, insertions, and deletions.&lt;ref name="AstroBiology"&gt;{{cite news| title=Genomics Meets Geology| url=http://www.astrobio.net/news-exclusive/genomics-meets-geology/| accessdate=1 July 2016|work=AstroBiology Magazine|date=September 10, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Building on Darwin, the Benner laboratory provided tools to predict the three dimensional structure of proteins from sequence data. Information about known protein structures was collected and marketed as a commercial database, the Master Catalog, by Benner's startup EraGen.&lt;ref name="AstroBiology"/&gt;

The use of multiple sequence information to predict secondary structure of proteins became popular as a result of the work of Benner and Gerloff.&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=David T.|title=Protein Secondary Structure Prediction Based on Position-specific Scoring Matrices|journal=Journal of Molecular Biology|date=1999|volume=292|page=196|url=http://csb.stanford.edu/class/public/readings/Structure_Prediction_I_Lecture8/Jones_JMB_99_PSIPRED_Secondary_structure.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818154501/http://csb.stanford.edu/class/public/readings/Structure_Prediction_I_Lecture8/Jones_JMB_99_PSIPRED_Secondary_structure.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2016-08-18|accessdate=6 July 2016|doi=10.1006/jmbi.1999.3091}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gerloff"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benner|first1=SA|last2=Gerloff|first2=D|title=Patterns of divergence in homologous proteins as indicators of secondary and tertiary structure: a prediction of the structure of the catalytic domain of protein kinases|journal=Advances in Enzyme Regulation|date=1991|volume=31|pages=121–81|pmid=1877385|doi=10.1016/0065-2571(91)90012-b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Korostensky"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gonnet|first1=Gaston H.|last2=Korostensky|first2=Chantal|last3=Benner|first3=Steve|title=Evaluation Measures of Multiple Sequence Alignments|journal=Journal of Computational Biology|date=February 2000|volume=7|issue=1–2|pages=261–276|doi=10.1089/10665270050081513|pmid=10890401}}&lt;/ref&gt; Predictions of protein secondary structure by Benner and colleagues achieved high accuracy.&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Russell|first1=R.B.|last2=Sternberg|first2=M.J.E.|title=Structure Prediction: How good are we?|journal=Current Biology|date=May 1995|volume=5|issue=5|pages=488–490|doi=10.1016/S0960-9822(95)00099-6|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982295000996|accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became possible to model protein folds, detect distant homologs, enable structural genomics, and join protein sequence, structure, and function. Further, this work suggested limits to structure prediction by homology, defining what can and cannot be done with this strategy.&lt;ref name="AstroBiology"/&gt;

===Practical genotyping tools===
Benner's approach opened new perspectives on how nucleic acids work, as well as tools for diagnostics and nanotechnology. The FDA has approved products that use AEGIS DNA in human diagnostics. These monitor the loads of virus in patients infected with [[hepatitis B]], [[hepatitis C]] and [[HIV]].&lt;ref name="Spoto"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Spoto|editor-first1=Giuseppe|editor-last2=Corradini|editor-first2=Roberto|title=Detection of non-amplified genomic DNA|date=2012|publisher=Springer|location=Dordrecht|isbn=978-94-007-1226-3|page=104|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Crnul35RNXYC&amp;pg=PA104|accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; AEGIS has been the basis of the development of tools for multiplexed detection of genetic markers such as cancer cells&lt;ref name="Dambrot"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dambrot|first1=Stuart Mason|title=The ties that bind: Recreating Darwinian ligand evolution in vitro|url=http://phys.org/news/2014-01-ties-recreating-darwinian-ligand-evolution.html|accessdate=6 July 2016|work=Phys.org|date=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and single nucleotide polymorphisms in patient samples.

===Interpretive proteomics===
Interpreting genomic data and projecting back to a common genetic ancestor, "Luca", the Benner laboratory has introduced tools that analyze patterns of conservation and variation using structural biology, study variation in these patterns across different branches of an evolutionary tree, and correlate events in the genetic record with events in the history of the biosphere known from geology and fossils. From this have emerged examples showing how the roles of biomolecules in contemporary life can be understood through models of the historical past.&lt;ref name="Plaxco"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Plaxco|first1=Kevin W.|last2=Gross|first2=Michael|title=Astrobiology : a brief introduction|date=2006|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=978-0801883675|pages=165–170|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x83omgI5pGQC&amp;pg=PA165|accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="proteomics"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benner|first1=Steven A.|title=Interpretive proteomics—finding biological meaning in genome and proteome databases|journal=Advances in Enzyme Regulation|date=June 2003|volume=43|issue=1|pages=271–359|doi=10.1016/S0065-2571(02)00024-9|url=http://www.ffame.org/pubs/Interpretive%20proteomics%20-%20finding%20biological%20meaning%20in%20genome%20and%20proteome%20databases.pdf|accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benner is deeply interested in the [[origin of life]], and the conditions necessary to support an [[RNA world|RNA-world model]] in which self-replicating RNA is a precursor to life on Earth.

Given the posited emergent nature of quantum laws in SED, it has been argued that they form a kind of "quantum equilibrium" that has an analogous status to that of thermal equilibrium in classical dynamics. In principle therefore, SED allows other "[[quantum non-equilibrium]]" distributions, for which the statistical predictions of quantum theory are violated. It is controversially argued that quantum theory is merely a special case of a much wider nonlinear physics, a physics in which non-local ([[Faster-than-light|superluminal]]) signalling is possible, and in which the uncertainty principle can be violated.&lt;ref name="Valentini2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Valentini|first1=Antony|title=Beyond the quantum|journal=Physics World|volume=22|issue=11|year=2009|pages=32–37|issn=0953-8585|doi=10.1088/2058-7058/22/11/36|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1001.2758v1.pdf|arxiv=1001.2758|bibcode=2009PhyW...22k..32V}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Musser|first1=George|title=Cosmological Data Hint at a Level of Physics Underlying Quantum Mechanics|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/critical-opalescence/cosmological-data-hint-at-a-level-of-physics-underlying-quantum-mechanics-guest-post/|website=blogs.scientificamerican.com|publisher=Scientific American|accessdate=5 December 2016|date=November 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been proposed that [[inertia]] is one such emergent law.&lt;ref name="HaischRueda1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haisch|first1=Bernhard|last2=Rueda|first2=Alfonso|last3=Puthoff|first3=H.

==Classical background field==

The background field is introduced as a [[Lorentz force]] in the (classical) Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac equation (see: [[Abraham–Lorentz–Dirac force]]), where the classical statistics of the electric and magnetic fields and quadratic combinations thereof are chosen to match the vacuum expectation values of the equivalent operators in QED. The field is generally represented as a discrete sum of [[Fourier series|Fourier components]] each with amplitude and phase that are independent classical random variables, distributed so that the statistics of the fields are isotropic and unchanged under boosts. This prescription is such that each Fourier mode at frequency (f) is expected to have an energy of hf/2, equaling that of the ground state of the vacuum modes of QED. Unless [[cutoff frequency|cut off]], the total field has an infinite energy density, with a spectral energy density (per unit frequency per unit volume) [2h/c&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]f&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; where h is [[Planck's constant]]. Consequently, the background field is a classical version of the electromagnetic ZPF of QED, though in SED literature the field is commonly referred to simply as 'the ZPF' without making that distinction. It should be noted that any finite cutoff frequency of the field itself would be incompatible with Lorentz invariance.  For this reason, some researchers prefer to think of cutoff frequency in terms of the response of particles to the field rather than as a property the field itself.

==Brief history==
{{Quantum mechanics|Interpretations}}
Stochastic electrodynamics is a term for a collection of research efforts of many different styles based on the [[ansatz]] that there exists a [[Lorentz invariant]] random [[electromagnetic radiation]]. The basic ideas have been around for a long time; but Marshall (1963) and Brafford seem to have been the originators of the more concentrated efforts starting in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Marshall, T. W. | title=Random Electrodynamics| journal = [[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]] | pages = 475–491 | date =1963 | doi=10.1098/rspa.1963.0220 | volume=276|bibcode = 1963RSPSA.276..475M | issue=1367 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter Timothy Boyer, [[Luis de la Peña]] and [[Ana María Cetto]] were perhaps the most prolific contributors in the 1970s and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Boyer, Timothy H.| title= Random electrodynamics: The theory of classical electrodynamics with classical electromagnetic zero-point radiation | journal = Phys.

A separate thread has been the investigation of an earlier proposal by [[Walther Nernst]] attempting to use the SED notion of a classical ZPF to explain ''inertial mass'' as due to a vacuum reaction.

In 2000, Trevor Marshall derived an experimental prediction of SED dubbed "spontaneous parametric up-conversion" (SPUC) as a dual process to the well-known [[spontaneous parametric down-conversion]] (SPDC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Marshall |first=Trevor W. |author-link= |eprint=quant-ph/0203042 |title=Nonlocality - The party may be over |date=9 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; SPUC was tested in 2009 and 2010 with positive results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sun |first1=Jinyu |last2=Zhang |first2=Shian |last3=Jia |first3=Tianqing |last4=Wang |first4=Zugeng |last5=Sun |first5=Zhenrong |title=Femtosecond spontaneous parametric upconversion and downconversion in a quadratic nonlinear medium |journal=Journal of the Optical Society of America B |date=2009 |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=549–553 |doi=10.1364/JOSAB.26.000549 |bibcode = 2009JOSAB..26..549S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=S.

In 2010, Cavalleri ''et al.'' introduced SEDS ('pure' SED, as they call it, plus spin) as a fundamental improvement which they claim potentially overcomes all the known drawbacks to SED. They also claim SEDS resolves four observed effects that are so far unexplained by QED, i.e., 1) the physical origin of the ZPF, and its natural upper cutoff; 2) an anomaly in experimental studies of the [[Neutrino#Mass|neutrino rest mass]]; 3) the origin and quantitative treatment of 1/f noise; and 4) the high-energy tail (~ 10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; eV) of [[cosmic rays]]. Two [[double-slit]] electron diffraction experiments are proposed to  discriminate between QM and SEDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Giancarlo Cavalleri |author2=Francesco Barbero |author3=Gianfranco Bertazzi |author4=Eros Cesaroni |author5=Ernesto Tonni |author6=Leonardo Bosi |author7=Gianfranco Spavieri |author8=George Gillies |last-author-amp=yes |year=2010 |title=A quantitative assessment of stochastic electrodynamics with spin (SEDS): Physical principles and novel applications. |journal=Frontiers of Physics in China |volume=5|number=1|pages=107–122 |doi=10.1007/s11467-009-0080-0|bibcode = 2010FrPhC...5..107C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inconclusive but encouraging experiments were carried out in 2012 by Dmitriyeva and Moddel in which emissions in "... infrared was clearly observed" which they could not explain using "...conventional thermodynamic models".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Olga Dmitriyeva and Garret Moddel |year=2012 |title=Test of zero-point energy emission from gases flowing through Casimir cavities  |journal=Physics Procedia |volume=38 |pages=8–17 |doi=10.1016/j.phpro.2012.08.007 |bibcode = 2012PhPro..38....8D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Auñon et al. showed that Casimir and Van der Waals interactions are a particular case of stochastic forces from electromagnetic sources when the broad Planck's spectrum is chosen and the wavefields are non-correlated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Juan Miguel Auñon, Cheng Wei Qiu and Manuel Nieto-Vesperinas |year=2013 |title=Tailoring photonic forces on a magnetodielectric nanoparticle with a fluctuating optical source |journal=Physical Review A |volume=88 |page=043817 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.88.043817|bibcode = 2013PhRvA..88d3817A |url=https://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/95567/1/Tailoring%20photonic%20forces.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Addressing fluctuating partially coherent light emitters with a tailored spectral energy distribution in the optical range, this establishes the link between stochastic electrodynamics and [[coherence theory (optics)|coherence theory]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=Leonard Mandel and Emil Wolf |title=Optical Coherence and Quantum Optics |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=1995|isbn=9780521417112}}&lt;/ref&gt; henceforth putting forward a way to optically create and control both such zero-point fields as well as Lifshitz forces &lt;ref&gt;E. M. Lifshitz, Dokl. Akad. Nauk SSSR 100, 879 (1955).&lt;/ref&gt; of thermal fluctuations. In addition, this opens the path to build many more stochastic forces on employing narrow-band light sources for bodies with frequency-dependent responses.

In a 2014 dissertation Carlos Alberto de Oliveira Henriques measured the energy shift in the atomic levels of Xe atoms as they passed through nano-porous Casimir membranes. Some evidence of anomalous radiation were observed, however, he was not able to distinguish this radiation conclusively from the background due to said shortcomings in the detector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://estudogeral.sib.uc.pt/jspui/bitstream/10316/28082/1/ZPF_extraction_last.pdf |year=2014 |title=Study of atomic energy shifts induced by Casimir cavities}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope of SED==
SED has been used in attempts to provide a ''classical'' explanation for effects previously considered to require quantum mechanics (here restricted to the [[Schrödinger equation]] and the [[Dirac equation]] and QED) for their explanation. It has also been used to motivate a classical ZPF-based underpinning for gravity and inertia. There is no universal agreement on the successes and failures of SED, either in its congruence with standard theories of quantum mechanics, QED, and gravity, or in its compliance with observation. The following SED-based explanations are relatively uncontroversial and are free of criticism at the time of writing:
*The [[Casimir effect]]&lt;ref&gt;QED-based calculations commonly implicitly adopt the SED ansatz to compute Casimir forces. See for example {{cite book|authors=C. Itzykson and J-B. Zuber |title=Quantum Field Theory |publisher=Dover Publications |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-486-44568-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zero point energy==
According to Haisch and Rueda, inertia arises as an ''electromagnetic drag force'' on accelerating particles, produced by interaction with the zero-point field.  In their 1998 Ann. Phys. paper (see citations), they speak of a "Rindler flux", presumably meaning the Unruh effect, and claim to have computed a nonzero ''"z.p.f. momentum"''.  This computation rests upon their claim to compute a nonzero ''"z.p.f. Poynting vector"''.

These proposals for [[zero-point energy]] suggest a source of low or no cost [[perpetual motion|free energy]] from the vacuum as well as the hope of developing a [[reactionless drive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=G. A. Robertson, P. A. Murad and E.

==Fictional references==
Arthur C. Clarke describes a "SHARP drive" (for [[Andrei Sakharov|Sakharov]], Haisch, Rueda and [[Harold E. Puthoff|Puthoff]]) in his 1997 novel "[[3001: The Final Odyssey]]".

'''William Lindsay Allen''', sometimes identified as '''William Luedyard Allen''', (c. 1877 – May 13, 1907) was an [[American football]] player and coach.  He played [[college football]] at the [[University of Michigan]] and was a player on the [[1898 Michigan Wolverines football team]] that won the school's first [[Big Ten Conference|Western Conference]] championship.  During the 1900 and 1902 college football seasons, he was the head football coach at Washington Agricultural College and School of Science—now known as [[Washington State University]]—in [[Pullman, Washington]].  He compiled a record of 6–3–1 as the head coach at Washington Agricultural.

==Early years==
Allen was born in approximately 1877 and was a resident of [[Sac City, Iowa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Calendar of the University of Michigan 1899-1900|publisher=University of Michigan|year=1900|page=328|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kec_AAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the son of William Allen (born c. 1816 in Virginia) and Sarah Allen (born c. 1847 in Wisconsin).  At the time of the 1880 United States Census and the 1885 Iowa Census, the family was living at Sac City.&lt;ref&gt;Census entry for William Allen, Sarah Allen, and children Hattie, Willie and Richmond.

Allen began his education at the [[University of Notre Dame]].&lt;ref name=Ens/&gt;  In 1897, he enrolled at the University of Michigan as student in the Department of Laws.  As a first-year student in 1897, Allen was the vice president of his class and the captain of the varsity reserve football team.  As a second-year student in 1898, he played at the [[Guard (American and Canadian football)|guard]] position for the undefeated [[1898 Michigan Wolverines football team]] that won the school's first [[Big Ten Conference|Western Conference]] championship.&lt;ref name=Ens/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1898 Football Team|publisher=Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan|url=http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fbteam/1898fbt.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1898 Michigan Football Roster|publisher=Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan|url=http://141.211.39.65/allroster/FMPro?-DB=allrost.fp5&amp;-Format=fbresult.htm&amp;-SortField=name&amp;-SortOrder=Ascend&amp;year=1898&amp;-max=170&amp;-Find}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a starter at guard in Michigan's 21–0 victory over [[Eastern Michigan Eagles football#Normalites era (1891–1928)|Michigan State Normal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trying Out Men: U. of M.

After graduating from Michigan, Allen was hired as the head football coach at Washington Agricultural College (now [[Washington State University]]) in [[Pullman, Washington]].  He led the team to an undefeated record of 4–0–1 in the 1900 college football season.&lt;ref name=Chinook/&gt;  In his first four games as the head coach, Allen's team won shut out victories over L.A.A.C.

'''Worthington Chauncey Ford''' (February 15, 1858 – March 7, 1941) was an [[United States|American]] [[historian]] and [[editing|editor]] of a number of collections of documents from early American history. He served in a variety of government positions: first, as the chief of the Bureau of Statistics for the [[U.S. Department of State]], from 1885–1889, then at the [[U.S. Department of Treasury]], 1893–1898, then as chief of the manuscripts division at the Library of Congress from 1902-1908. He also served as Librarian of the John Carter Brown Library at [[Brown University]] from 1917-1922.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ala.org/ala/acrl/acrlpubs/rbm/backissuesvol6no2/slive06.pdf] ''American Library Association, RBM, Vol. 6, No. 2, Fall 2005: Interview with Norman Fiering.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family Notoriety==
Ford was the youngest member of a distinguished and notorious family. He was the great-grandson (through his mother) of [[Noah Webster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Death of Mrs. Emily E. Ford | work=New York Times | date=24 November 1893 | page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; His two younger brothers were [[Paul Leicester Ford]], an eminent biographer and novelist, and [[Malcolm Webster Ford]], a distinguished amateur athlete. Both died May 8, 1902 in a [[murder-suicide]] when Malcolm shot Paul and then himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Paul L. Ford Slain by his Brother|author= |newspaper= The New York Times|date= May 9, 1902|url= https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1902/05/09/101950937.pdf|accessdate=June 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historian, President of AHA==
Worthington Ford was best known for his edited collections of a number of [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] documents, including "The writings of George Washington (14 Volumes)", "Alexander Hamilton's notes in the Federal convention of 1787", and "Writings of John Quincy Adams". He also edited collections of the correspondence of [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[John Adams]], and other figures in early American history.&lt;ref name="nytobit" /&gt;

Ford's historical work was also notable for his tenure as chief of the newly established Manuscripts Division at the [[Library of Congress]]. During his time in charge, from 1903-1909,&lt;ref name="nytobit"&gt;{{cite journal | title=W. Chauncey Ford, Historian, was 83 | journal=New York Times | issue=8 March 1941 | pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; he organized a significant effort to photograph and copy manuscripts pertaining to early American history which resided in foreign archives (especially France, Britain, and Spain). In this way, copies of many documents which had been missing since 1812 or earlier were recovered.
.&lt;ref&gt;''American Historical Review, Vol. 90, No. 1, (Feb., 1985), pp. 16-17''&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he edited and published the complete Journals of the Continental Congress, 1774-1789.

Ford was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlistf American Antiquarian Society Members Directory]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford was active in the [[American Historical Association]] and was elected President in 1917. Ford's presidential address, The Editorial Function in United States History, is notable for its careful exposure of the deliberate omissions made by early editors of the Founding Fathers papers, including faked memoirs, papers edited to hide controversies important at the time, and other "crimes and errors" common in the editing and publishing of historical documents of the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historians.org/info/AHA_History/wcford.htm] ''American Historical Review 23:2 (January 1918): pp. 273–86''&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford defended the American purchase and annexation of the Philippines from Spain during the Philippine–American War by saying "Questions of Conscience need not trouble us ... Here are rich lands, held by those who do not or cannot get the best out of them, and awaiting the fructifying application of capital and organization in commerce. Under this beneficent view the natives, an inferior race, must get out or become laborers.  The Filipino is an incumbrance to be got rid of, unless he accepts the mandates of a purchasing and conquering power."

Ford also edited collections of works of other American figures, including ''Letters of Henry Adams (1892-1918)'', and a collection of [[Aaron Burr]]'s letters.
