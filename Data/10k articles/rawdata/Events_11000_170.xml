== Symbol ==

The first fifteen asteroids to be discovered were given symbols by astronomers as a type of shorthand notation. Psyche was given an iconic symbol, as were several other asteroids discovered over the next few years. The symbol [[File:16 Psyche symbol.svg|x25px|16 Psyche]], a semicircle topped by a star, represents a butterfly's wing, symbol of the soul (''psyche'' is the Greek word for 'soul'), and a star.&lt;ref name=an-34-psyche&gt;{{cite journal

== Characteristics ==
=== Mass, size and shape ===
Psyche is massive enough that its [[gravitational perturbation]]s on other asteroids can be observed, which enables a [[mass]] measurement. As of 2017 the best mass estimate is {{val|2.72|0.75}}{{e|19}}&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref name="Shepard2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baer" /&gt;

[[File:16-Psyche-Occult-DAMIT1806.jpg|thumb|left|Lightcurve Inversion model DAMIT 1806 and occultation chords from two observations of 2010 and 2014.]]

The first size estimate of Psyche came from [[IRAS]] thermal [[infrared]] emission observations. They showed that it had a diameter of about 253&amp;nbsp;km,&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; although it was likely an overestimate as Psyche was viewed pole-on at that time.&lt;ref name="Shepard2017"/&gt;

&lt;ref name="Lupishko1999" /&gt;

[[Lightcurve|Light curve]] analysis indicates Psyche appears somewhat irregular in shape. There is a pronounced mass deficit near the equator at about 90° longitude comparable to [[Rheasilvia (crater)|Rheasilvia]] basin on [[4 Vesta|Vesta]]. There are also two additional smaller (50–70&amp;nbsp;km in diameter) crater-like depressions near the south pole. that Psyche's north pole points towards either [[ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic coordinates]] (β, λ) = (−7°, 34°) with a 10° uncertainty.&lt;ref name="Kaasalainen02"&gt;{{cite journal|date=2002|year=|title=Models of Twenty Asteroids from Photometric Data|url=http://www.rni.helsinki.fi/~mjk/IcarPIII.pdf|journal=Icarus|volume=159|issue=2|page=369|pages=|bibcode=2002Icar..159..369K|doi=10.1006/icar.2002.6907|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216072340/http://www.rni.helsinki.fi/~mjk/IcarPIII.pdf|archive-date=2008-02-16|via=|first1=M.|last1=Kaasalainen|access-date=16 May 2006 &lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gives an [[axial tilt]] of 95°.&lt;ref name="Shepard2017"/&gt;

Observations of two [[Chord (astronomy)|multi-chord]] stellar [[occultation]]s of 2010 and 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sbn.psi.edu/pds/resource/occ.html|title=Asteroid Data Sets|website=sbn.psi.edu|access-date=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; allow the matching of light curve inversions model [http://astro.troja.mff.cuni.cz/projects/asteroids3D/data/archive/1-1000/A109.M1806.shape.png DAMIT 1806] that give an equivalent Volume mean diameter of 216+/-12&amp;nbsp;km, and an equivalent Surface mean diameter of 227 +/- 13&amp;nbsp;km.

The density of Psyche that follows from size and mass estimates mentioned above – {{val|4500|1400}}&amp;nbsp;kg/m³ – is consistent of that of metallic object with a porosity of about 40%.&lt;ref name="Shepard20172"&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.jtitle=Icarus&amp;rft.atitle=Radar+observations+and+shape+model+of+asteroid+16+Psyche&amp;rft.volume=281&amp;rft.pages=388-403&amp;rft.date=2017&amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1016%2Fj.icarus.2016.08.011&amp;rft_id=info%3Abibcode%2F2017Icar..281..388S&amp;rft.aulast=Sheppard&amp;rft.aufirst=Michael+K.&amp;rft.au=Richardsonb%2C+James&amp;rft.au=Taylor%2C+Patrick+A.&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fen.wikipedia.org%3A16+Psyche" class="Z3988"&gt;&lt;span style="display:none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This is higher than most previous estimates.&lt;ref name="Baer2"&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Abook&amp;rft.genre=unknown&amp;rft.btitle=Recent+Asteroid+Mass+Determinations&amp;rft.pub=Personal+Website&amp;rft.date=2011&amp;rft.aulast=Baer&amp;rft.aufirst=Jim&amp;rft_id=http%3A%2F%2Fhome.earthlink.net%2F~jimbaer1%2Fastmass.txt&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fen.wikipedia.org%3A16+Psyche" class="Z3988"&gt;&lt;span style="display:none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shepard2017" /&gt;

The [[NASA Infrared Telescope Facility]] at the [[Mauna Kea Observatories]] released evidence (~3 μm absorption feature) of the presence of water or [[Hydroxy group|hydroxyl]] ions on the asteroid in October 2016. The water is believed to have reached Psyche via past impacts from smaller asteroids containing volatile substances such as carbon, hydrogen and water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Atkinson|first1=Nancy|title=Pure Metal Asteroid Has Mysterious Water Deposits|url=http://www.universetoday.com/131738/pure-metal-asteroid-found-with-mysterious-water-deposits/|website=Universe Today|access-date=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Simpson|first1=Julia|title=Giant Metallic Asteroid Psyche May Have Water|url=http://www.politicallore.com/giant-metallic-asteroid-psyche-may-water/6496|website=Politicallore|access-date=12 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.space.com/34525-giant-metallic-asteroid-psyche-water.html|title=Giant Metallic Asteroid Psyche May Have Water|accessdate=2017-09-18|date=October 27, 2016|author=Jesse Emspak|work=space.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Takir2016&gt;{{cite journal|last=Takir|first=Driss|first2=Vishnu|last2=Reddy|first3=Juan A.|last3=Sanchez|first4=Michael K.|last4= Shepard|first5= Joshua P.|last5=Emery|title=Detection of Water and/or Hydroxil on Asteroid (16) Psyche|journal=The Astronomical Journal|volume=153|pages=31|doi=10.3847/1538-3881/153/1/31|year=2016|bibcode=2017AJ....153...31T|arxiv=1610.00802}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on its composition Psyche appears to be an exposed [[Planetary core|metallic core]] or a fragment of a metallic core&lt;ref name="Hardersen05"/&gt; from a larger [[Planetary differentiation|differentiated]] parent body some 500 kilometers in diameter. If Psyche is indeed one, there could be other asteroids on similar orbits. However, Psyche is not part of any identified [[asteroid family]].&lt;ref name="Davis99"&gt;{{cite journal | first1= D. R. | last1=Davis | first2= Paolo | last2=Farinella | first3= M. | last3=Francesco | last-author-amp= yes| title= The Missing Psyche Family: Collisionally Eroded or Never Formed?| journal= Icarus| date= 1999| volume= 137 | issue= 1| page= 140 | doi = 10.1006/icar.1998.6037 | bibcode=1999Icar..137..140D}}&lt;/ref&gt; One hypothesis is that the collision that formed Psyche occurred very early in the Solar System's history, and all the other remnants have since been ground into fragments by subsequent collisions or had their orbits [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbed]] beyond recognition. However, this scenario is considered to have a probability of just 1%. An alternative is that Psyche was broken by impacts, but not catastrophically torn apart. In this case, it may be a candidate for the parent body of the [[mesosiderite]]s, a class of [[stony–iron meteorite]]s.&lt;ref name="Davis99"/&gt;

Another possibility is that Psyche may be an endmember of diverse relic bodies left by the [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System#Terrestrial planets|inner planet formation]]. The asteroid's mantle may have been stripped away not by a single collision but by multiple (&gt;3) relatively slow hit-and-run collisions with bodies of comparable or larger size. What is left is a metallic core covered by thin layer of [[silicate]]s, which reveal itself spectrally. In such a case Psyche would be analogous to Mercury but much less massive.&lt;ref name=Asphaug2014&gt;{{cite journal|first=E.|last= Asphaug|first2= A.|last2= Reufer|title=Mercury and other iron-rich planetary bodies as relics of inefficient accretion|journal=Nature Geoscience|doi=10.1038/NGEO2189|volume=7|pages=564–568|issue=8|bibcode=2014NatGe...7..564A|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spacecraft would orbit Psyche for 20 months,&lt;ref name="NYT-20170106" /&gt; studying its topography, surface features, gravity, magnetism, and other characteristics and would be based on current technology, avoiding high cost and the necessity to develop new technologies.

The mission was approved by NASA on January 4, 2017 and was originally targeted to launch in October 2023, arriving at the asteroid in 2030, following an Earth gravity assist spacecraft maneuver in 2024 and a Mars flyby in 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-selects-two-missions-to-explore-the-early-solar-system|title=NASA Selects Two Missions to Explore the Early Solar System|last=Northon|first=Karen|date=2017-01-04|newspaper=NASA|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2017 the launch date was moved up to target a more efficient trajectory, launching in 2022 and arriving in 2026 with a Mars [[gravity assist]] in 2023.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2017-149|title=NASA Moves Up Launch of Psyche Mission to a Metal Asteroid|date=2017-05-24|newspaper=NASA|access-date=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''1969 Texas 500''' was a [[NASCAR]] [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series|Grand National Series]] (now '''Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series''') event that was held on December 7, 1969, at [[Texas World Speedway]] in [[College Station, Texas]].

Souvenir racing programs were sold at the event for the then-inexpensive cost of $1 USD per copy (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1|1969|r=2}}}} when adjusted for inflation).

The extra four degrees of banking made the cars {{convert|16|mph|km/h|disp=or}} faster than their speeds while racing at Michigan International Speedway.

==Summary==
[[Bobby Isaac]] would win this race in his 1969 [[Dodge Charger]]; gaining $15,640 in prize winnings (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|15640|1969|r=2}}}} when inflation is taken into effect).&lt;ref name="1969t500"/&gt; [[Buddy Baker]] earned the pole position with a speed of {{convert|176.284|mi/h}} while the average speed of the race was {{convert|144.277|mi/h}}.&lt;ref name="1969t500"/&gt; More than 23,000 race fans would see [[Donnie Allison]] lose the race by more than two laps.&lt;ref name="1969t500"/&gt; [[Don Biederman]] was the only foreign-born driver (he was born in [[Port Credit, Ontario|Port Credit]], [[Ontario]]) and raced under the employ of [[Bill Champion (racing driver)|Bill Champion]] for this race in a 1968 [[Ford Torino]].&lt;ref name="1969t500"/&gt; [[Roy Tyner]] would finish in last place after picking up an [[engine]] problem on lap 2 with his 1969 [[Pontiac]] vehicle.&lt;ref name="1969t500"/&gt;

Other notable drivers to develop problems in the race were: [[Elmo Langley]], [[Cale Yarborough]], [[Ed Negre]], and [[Bill Seifert]].&lt;ref name="1969t500"/&gt; [[Wendell Scott]] (the first [[African American]] driver in NASCAR history to win a race), [[Buddy Baker]] (who was the highest finishing driver to DNF from the race in 8th place&lt;ref name="1969t500"/&gt;), and [[Benny Parsons]] were three other notable drivers of this decade who participated in the race. Yarborough would acquire a serious injury after clobbering his vehicle into one of the walls.

[[NASCAR on ABC]] would begin televising a select number of races during the 1970 NASCAR Grand National Series season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://auto.howstuffworks.com/auto-racing/nascar/season-recaps/1960s/1969-nascar.htm | title = 1969 NASCAR Grand National Recap | publisher = How Stuff Works | date = | accessdate = 2012-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The televised broadcasting of NASCAR races eventually brought this once-regional motorsport into the national spotlight and eventually gained a major sponsor through [[Big Tobacco]] manufacturer [[R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company]] for the 1971 season. This alliance between tobacco and stock car racing would last until the [[2004 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series|2004 NASCAR Cup Series]] season. The transition to purpose-built racecars began in the early 1960s and occurred gradually over that decade.  Changes made to the sport by the late 1960s brought an end to the "strictly stock" vehicles of the 1950s; most of the cars were trailered to events or hauled in by trucks.

Biederman would make his grand exit from the NASCAR Cup Series after this race while Joe Hines would make his introduction into top-level stock car racing here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.race-database.com/results/results.php?year=1969&amp;race=54&amp;series_id=2 | title = 1969 Texas 500 results | publisher = Race Database | date = | accessdate = 2012-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Pearson (racing driver)|David Pearson]] would eventually merge as the eventual champion for the year. Pearson would later be recognized for winning his races more consistently than [[Richard Petty]] (who finished 21st in this race and would stop racing in [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] vehicles after this race&lt;ref name="1969t500"/&gt;) but would have an abbreviated racing career compared to him.

Notable crew chiefs for this race were [[Herb Nab]], [[Harry Hyde]], [[Dale Inman]], [[Banjo Matthews]], [[Glen Wood]], [[Dick Hutcherson]], and [[Cotton Owens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.racing-reference.info/entrylist/1969-54/W/C| title = 1969 Texas 500 crew chiefs | publisher = Racing Reference | date = | accessdate = 2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''2012 Kufra conflict''' started in the [[aftermath of the Libyan civil war]], and involved armed clashes between the [[Tubu people|Tobu]] and [[Zuwayya]] tribes in the [[Kufra]] area of [[Cyrenaica]], [[Libya]].

== Background and causes ==
On 12 and 13 February, 17 people were killed and 22 wounded in fighting between the Tobu and Zuwayya tribes in Kufra. Nine were from the Zuwayya and eight were from the Tobu. Initially, only small-arms fire was used in the clashes, but on the second day the situation escalated, with RPGs and anti-aircraft guns being used. According to the Zuwayya, the fighting started when a young man from their tribe was killed three days before by three Tobu members. A head of the local [[National Transitional Council]] (NTC) militia reported that the Zuwayya man was a smuggler and was killed after he opened fire on a Tobu militia, which was charged with combating illegal trafficking, killing five of the militiamen.&lt;ref name=scoreskilled&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.boston.com/2012-02-21/news/31083871_1_tribe-mustafa-abdul-jalil-kufra|title=Witnesses: Tribal clashes in Libya kill scores|work=The Boston Globe|agency=Associated Press|date=21 February 2012|accessdate=22 February 2012|first=Rami|last=Al-Shaheibi}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tobu, on their part, stated that they were being attacked by the Zuwayya, who were supported by the NTC, with the intention of exterminating them. The Tobu claimed discrimination by the Zuwayya, due to them being dark-skinned, on an even higher level than during the Gaddafi-era.&lt;ref name=17killed&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2012/Feb-13/163133-17-killed-in-libyan-tribal-clashes-tribesmen.ashx#axzz1n2TZm3mF|title=17 killed in Libyan tribal clashes: tribesmen|agency=Agence France-Presse|work=The Daily Star|location=Tripoli|date=13 February 2012|accessdate=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farhat Abdel Karim Bu Hareg, the coordinator of social affairs in the local Kufra government said that they will have to declare independence of the region if the NTC does not act against attacks by mercenaries, referring to Tobu fighters.&lt;ref name=5killed&gt;{{cite news|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/libyaNews/idAFL5E8DD55020120213|title=UPDATE 1-Five killed in clashes in southeast Libya|work=Reuters Africa|agency=Reuters|date=13 February 2012|accessdate=21 February 2012|location=Tripoli|first=Ali|last=Shuaib}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The region already experienced unrest during the rule of [[Muammar Gaddafi]]. In 2009, an uprising was suppressed by the Libyan army using helicopter gunships.&lt;ref name=clashesresume/&gt;

== Timeline ==

=== February 2012 ===
On 14 February, clashes continued around Kufra, with the NTC sending reinforcement to help the Zuwayya tribe. Tobu spokesmen said that they were besieged and were being heavily shelled by the Zuwayya, and added that it was an attempt to exterminate the Tobu tribe with government participation. An NTC spokesman stated that it was a low-level fight between revolutionaries and weapons smugglers backed by foreign elements.

On 23 February, the [[Libyan National Army]] was dispatched to Kufra to enforce the peace. Army commandos had reportedly taken control of the airport, city and whole region, according to Zuwayya tribal sources inside the city and both tribes used the renewed peace for evacuation of wounded to Tripoli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Reuters Africa|agency=Reuters|accessdate=24 February 2012|date=23 February 2012|location=Tripoli|first1=Ali|last1=Shuaib|first2=Taha|last2=Zargoun|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/libyaNews/idAFL5E8DN9P420120223|title=New Libya army flexes muscles to halt tribal fight}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 February, fighting resumed in Kufra, injuring several people, according to both tribes, with each blaming the other for the renewed fighting.

Three government soldiers were also wounded.&lt;ref name=3killed&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5juB1SkOQHu6okP1stEbWVBmt4P0Q?docId=CNG.8c1646bd8290076a8875b5c78a1c2b7d.431&amp;hl=en|title=3 killed in south Libya clashes|publisher=|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the evening on 21 April, 12 people had been killed and 35 wounded on the Tobu side.&lt;ref name=12killed&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/180765/12-killed-in-south-libya-violence-%E2%80%93-tribal-leader|title=12 killed in south Libya violence – tribal leader|publisher=|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== June 2012 ===

On 10 June, fighting flared up again in Kufra. Tobu tribesmen were engaged in clashes with former rebels who had become members of the new [[Libyan National Army]]. A Kufra official said the Tobu had launched an attack on the city with tanks and other heavy weapons. A Tobu representative said it was the tribe that had come under attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portalangop.co.ao/motix/en_us/noticias/africa/2012/5/24/Thirteen-killed-southeast-Libya-clashes-officials,594bad88-3d3a-4c6a-b1e8-d41eec0b2506.html|title=Thirteen killed in southeast Libya clashes: officials|work=ANGOP|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said the fighting had erupted after the former militiamen, known as the Libya Shield Battalion, had shelled the tribe's district. But a local security official said an attack on a security checkpoint in the town triggered the violence. The fighting continued into the next day and at least 23 people were killed. Among the dead were 20 Tobu tribesmen, including at least 15 tribal fighters, and three government soldiers.&lt;ref name=23killed&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jWBAVT2Na9CvqQutqBNm7eWomKpA?docId=CNG.2642c64437ac95c7b942b67f42682196.801|title=23 killed in two days of Libya clashes: sources|publisher=|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=freshfigting&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/Africa/News/Fresh-fighting-in-Libya-20120610|title=Fresh fighting in Libya|work=News24|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six more people, including two soldiers, were killed in renewed fighting in Kufra on 26 June. The fighting died down later in the evening.&lt;ref name=kufracalm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libyaherald.com/kufra-calm-between-clashes/|title=Kufra calm between clashes|publisher=|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the fighting continued late on 27 June and for the next three days another 47 people were killed and 100 wounded. 32 of the dead were from the Tobu tribe, 14 were from the Zwai tribe and one was a government soldier.&lt;ref name=47inthree&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/region/libya/south-libya-clashes-kill-47-in-three-days-1.1042837|title=South Libya clashes kill 47 in three days|publisher=|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==

According to [[UNSMIL]] mission more than 100 people were killed in the fighting, half of Kufra population had fled the fighting and more than 200 foreign migrants were waiting as of 29 February for evacuation. Associated Press journalist on the ground also witnessed at least 160 houses demolished by rocket attacks in one neighbourhood alone with the shelling also hitting a school where civilians were seeking shelter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/World/20120228/south-libya-tense-after-tribal-warfare-120228/#ixzz1nll1QxER|title=UN says south Libya tense after tribal warfare|work=CTVNews|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Alexis Opera House''' is a historic theater building located at 101-105 N. Main St. in [[Alexis, Illinois|Alexis]], [[Illinois]]. The building, which operated from 1889 until 1920, hosted traveling entertainment and community functions. It was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on July 30, 1987.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;

==History==
The opera house was constructed in 1889 by William S. Weir, a [[Monmouth, Illinois|Monmouth]] businessman who also owned the Bank of Alexis. It hosted its first show on November 1 of the same year, when the May Bretonne Company performed there. The opera house hosted traveling theatrical acts, musicians, and lecturers and advertised itself as hosting an act every three weeks. In addition, a number of civic functions were held in the building; [[Alexis High School]] held its graduation ceremony in the opera house every year until the building's closure, and numerous public meetings and community performances took place there as well. In the 1910s, religious services were also held in the building.&lt;ref name="NRHP nom"&gt;{{cite web|last=Swallow|first=Ann V.|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: Alexis Opera House|url=http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/pdfs/200916.pdf|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=October 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920, the state's [[fire marshal]] shut down the opera house over safety code violations, as the building had no fire escape and its seats were not attached to the floor. The building's owner, William A. McKnight, considered the changes too expensive to be worth undertaking and never reopened the opera house. McKnight continued to run a funeral parlor and hardware store in the building's commercial spaces through 1950.&lt;ref name="NRHP nom"/&gt;

==Architecture==
The Alexis Opera House was designed in the [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival]] style. The two-story building's plan features three storefronts on its first floor and the theater on its second. The front facade is divided into bays delineating the three storefronts; the storefronts feature recessed glass entrances supported by columns, while the second floor is constructed of brick. Brick [[pier (architecture)|pier]]s which extend through the roofline separate the second-story bays. Each bay features three vertical sets of windows, with one wide set in the middle of each bay and narrower sets on its sides. Limestone [[course (architecture)|coursing]] marks the top and bottom of the second-story windows and separates the [[clerestory]] windows from the rest. The [[parapet]] roof features ornamental brickwork.&lt;ref name="NRHP nom"/&gt;

'''''Baa Baa Black Sheep''''' (later syndicated as '''''Black Sheep Squadron''''') is a period military [[television]] series that aired on [[NBC]] from 1976 until 1978. Its premise was based on the experiences of [[United States Marine Corps]] aviator [[Greg Boyington]] and his [[World War II]] "[[VMA-214|Black Sheep Squadron]]".  The series was created and produced by [[Stephen J. Cannell]]. The opening credits read: "In World War II, Marine Corps Major Greg 'Pappy' Boyington commanded a squadron of fighter pilots. They were a collection of misfits and screwballs who became the terrors of the South Pacific. They were known as the Black Sheep."

==Plot==
Major Greg "Pappy" Boyington is the commanding officer of [[VMF-214]], a group of "misfit" fighter pilots based in the [[Solomon Islands]] during [[World War II]]. Pappy often intercedes in altercations at the base, but everyone seems to pull together when they are assigned missions in the air. Pappy likes to drink and fight a lot when not flying missions. He owns a [[Bull Terrier]] named "Meatball"&amp;nbsp;— which he claims belongs to General Moore to get the dog on the base against regulations in ''Flying Misfits'', but General Moore says he "wouldn't own an ugly mutt like that."

The series premise was very loosely based on a portion of the real-life military career of [[Pappy Boyington|Gregory Boyington]], known as "Pappy" due to his "advanced" age compared to the younger pilots under his command. (He was 30 when he took command of [[VMF-214]], but in the series pilot, he is stated to be 35.) Boyington, who was a technical adviser for the series, commented that the show was "fiction based on reality" and that no regular character in the series except for himself actually existed. Although in his book of the same name, there is a General "Nuts" Moore who has similar characteristics to General Moore in the series. Also in the book is Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Smoak, on whom Colonel Lard is based. Lard has almost the same animosity for Major Boyington in the TV series as Smoak does in the book. In the documentary film ''Pappy Boyington Field'', Robert Conrad shares personal insight about Pappy from their time together during the television series.

Pappy has the most air victories, or "kills", of any pilot in the squadron. In the pilot episode, Boyington has six kills from his tour with the [[Flying Tigers]]. His count climbs into the mid-20s as the series progresses. The real-life Boyington had 14 kills in 32 days during his first tour of duty with VMF-214, and finished with 25 confirmed victories.

The TV show's squadron is based on the fictional island of Vella la Cava.  There is an actual island called [[Vella Lavella]] in the [[New Georgia Group]] of the Soloman Islands, but in the initial episode "Flying Misfits," Vella la Cava was represented on an aviation [[sectional chart]] by the real [[Kolombangara Island]].  The actual VMF-214 flew out of [[Henderson Field (Guadalcanal)|Henderson Field]] on the island of [[Guadalcanal]] during the Solomon Islands campaign.

Popular character John "Hutch" Hutchinson ([[Joey Aresco]]) was killed off in the episode ''Last One for Hutch'' and replaced as chief mechanic by [[master sergeant]] Andy Micklin ([[Red West]]), who had joined the squadron a few episodes earlier in ''Devil in the Slot''.

*Second Lieutenant Jeb Pruitt (Pilot) (1978).  Played by [[Jeb Stuart Adams]].
*Master Gunnery Sergeant/Warrant Officer/Captain Andrew "Andy" Micklin (Chief Mechanic) (1977–1978). Played by [[Red West]]. Micklin was promoted to warrant officer at the start of the episode "The 200 Pound Gorilla," and was made a temporary captain by Boyington while sitting in the brig for punching out a major in a bar fight, resulting in his reduction in grade/rank back to master gunnery sergeant. In the season 2 episode "Fighting Angels," Micklin's background as a mud marine in China was referenced, and he has been described by Boyington as being "part commando, part Indian tracker, and 100 percent mean."
*Sergeant John David "Hutch" Hutchinson (Chief/Assistant Chief Mechanic) (1976–1977). Played by [[Joey Aresco]]. Hutch is killed in Season 1, Episode 21 (''Last One for Hutch'') by an enemy strafing run during an attack on Vella La Cava.
*Colonel Thomas A. Lard (Executive Officer, Espritos Marcos) (1976–1978). Played by [[Dana Elcar]]. Lard, modeled on one of the real Boyington's actual superiors, USMC Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Smoak, is a strictly-by-the-book staff officer.&lt;ref name=bla&gt;{{cite book |last=Gamble|first=Bruce|first2=|last2=|title=Black Sheep One|year=2000|publisher=Presidio Press, Inc.|location=Novato, CA 94945-1340|isbn=0-89141-716-8|page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; A highly competent career Marine who has seen action in China, Lard is offended by Boyington's frequent disregard for regulations and policies, and the two men rarely get along personally. (The real Boyington and Smoak were bitter personal enemies, and Boyington never forgave Smoak or made any kind of peace with him.)&lt;ref name=blc&gt;{{cite book|last=Gamble|first=Bruce|title=Black Sheep One|year=2000|publisher=Presidio Press, Inc.|location=Novato, CA 94945-1340|isbn=0-89141-716-8|pages=277–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Lard sees a lot of promise in Boyington, though he does not admit it, and he often puts aside his opinions to further the mission.
*Brigadier General/Major General Thomas Moore (Commanding Officer, Esprito Marcos) (1976–1978). Played by [[Simon Oakland]].  Moore is impressed by Boyington's initiative in "stealing" the 214th and then by the results obtained by the Black Sheep, so he keeps Lard in check as much as possible. Moore was promoted from brigadier general to major general in the second season episode "The 200 Pound Gorilla." (The actual general officer who provided the real Boyington with support where needed was named [[James T. Moore (USMC)|James T. Moore]], and was nicknamed "Nuts." He and the real Boyington had been "drinking buddies.").&lt;ref name=blk&gt;{{cite book|last=Gamble|first=Bruce|title=Black Sheep One|year=2000|publisher=Presidio Press, Inc.|location=Novato, CA 94945-1340|isbn=0-89141-716-8|page=261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical response==
The day of the show's debut, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called ''Baa Baa Black Sheep'' a "war-is-swell series [aimed] at anyone who remembers World War II as a rousing, blowzy, fraternity turkey-shoot."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Tom |last=Shales |title='Black Sheep': Oh, What An Unlovely War |work=The Washington Post |publisher= |id= |pages= |page= |date=1976-09-21&lt;!--|accessdate=2007-06-24--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production notes==
Although the title ''Baa Baa Black Sheep'' comes from a [[Baa, Baa, Black Sheep (nursery rhyme)|nursery rhyme]], the song heard at the beginning of the opening credits is actually the chorus to ''[[The Whiffenpoofs|The Whiffenpoof Song]]'', written in 1909 as a homage to [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s poem ''Gentlemen-Rankers''.  One of the squadron's real-life members, Paul "Moon" Mullen, adapted "The Whiffenpoof Song" for the squadron's use.

: "We are poor little lambs,
: Who have lost our way.
: Baa, Baa, Baaaaa."

The name of the island where the real-life Black Sheep were stationed was [[Vella Lavella]] in the Solomon Islands of the southern Pacific, known as ''[[The Slot]]''; this was changed to Vella la Cava in the series for legal reasons.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} The same was done for the Rear Area Allied Command island of "[[Espiritu Santo]]" (Espritos Marcos). The [[Channel Islands of California|Channel Islands]] off the coast of [[Southern California]] provided an adequate substitute backdrop for flying scenes. Filming of airfield scenes was primarily done at the now-closed Indian Dunes Airport in [[Valencia, California]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airfields-freeman.com/CA/Airfields_CA_SanFernan.htm#indiandunes] [[Abandoned &amp; Little-Known Airfields]]:Indian Dunes Airport (4CA4), Valencia, California&lt;/ref&gt;

Some air-battle scenes were actually short clips from the 1969 film ''[[Battle of Britain (film)|Battle of Britain]]'', and German markings on the planes can clearly be seen.{{Or|date=May 2010}} Other flying scenes pioneered the technique of mounting cameras on helmets worn by pilots, thus providing a pilot's-eye view never before seen in films featuring single-seat aircraft.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Because of reflections from the Plexiglas canopies, many close-ups were shot with the canopies removed.

The [[Vought F4U Corsair|Vought F4U and FG-1 Corsair]] fighter planes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poor Little Lambs|url=http://www.warbirdsnews.com/warbirds-news/poor-lambs-corsairs-baa-baa-blacksheep.html|website=Warbird News|publisher=Warbird News|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; were leased to Universal Studios by private owners. Many scenes showing repairs on the aircraft were filmed during actual preventative maintenance.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} "Japanese" aircraft used in the series were actually [[North American T-6 Texan]] World War 2 trainer planes, which had been modified to resemble Japanese planes for the film ''[[Tora! Tora! Tora!]]'' and later purchased by collectors. The [[Grumman J2F Duck]] float biplane belonged to legendary stunt pilot [[Frank Tallman]] and his Tallmanz Aviation museum in [[Santa Ana, California]]. Tallman often stated that this was his all-time favorite plane to fly, with the Corsair in a near-tie.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Tallman provided or arranged for most of the aircraft used in the series.

At an aviation history symposium in 2002, members of the real VMF-214 were asked about the authenticity of the TV series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CORSAIR! |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_action=doc&amp;p_docid=0F6260A3AC00CCA8&amp;p_docnum=1|work=[[Dayton Daily News]]|page=Z3-10|date=2002-09-12|accessdate=2007-06-24|quote=The Gathering of Corsairs and Legends at the Indianapolis Air Show in Mount Comfort, Ind.&amp;nbsp;... Numerous Navy and Marine pilots who few Corsairs in combat attended the show, where they participated in a symposium and signed autographs.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Retired Colonel Henry A. McCartney said the list of errors was too long to repeat. Boyington himself referred to the series as "...&amp;nbsp;inaccuracies, hogwash, and Hollywood hokum,"&lt;ref&gt;Bates, Tom, "Black Sheep of the South Pacific," ''[[Soldier of Fortune (magazine)|SOF's Action Series]]'', Volume II. #6 (''Valor''), December 1986, Omega Group, Ltd, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; although he did serve as technical advisor on the show, and had cameo appearances in two episodes. A 2001 History Channel documentary depicted some of these differences in greater detail.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1714058 "2001 History Channel documentary on the differences between the TV show and the real VMF-214"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Barnstorming''' was a form of entertainment in which [[stunt pilot]]s performed tricks, either individually or in groups called '''flying circuses'''. Devised to "impress people with the skill of pilots and the sturdiness of planes",&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt; it became popular in the [[United States]] during the [[Roaring Twenties]].&lt;ref name=onkst&gt;{{cite web|author1=David H. Onkst |title =Clyde 'Upside-Down' Pangborn |url = http://www.centennialofflight.net/essay/Explorers_Record_Setters_and_Daredevils/pangborn/EX14.htm|website=U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission |accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Barnstormers''' were pilots who flew throughout the country selling airplane rides and performing stunts; [[Charles Lindbergh]] first began flying in this capacity.&lt;ref name=minnesota/&gt;

==History==
===Background===
[[Image:Moisant-John 03.jpg|thumb|An advertising [[poster]] for the early flying exhibition team, the [[Moisant International Aviators]]]]

The [[Wright brothers]] and [[Glenn Curtiss]] had early flying exhibition teams, with solo flyers like [[Lincoln Beachey]] and [[Didier Masson]] also popular before [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]], but barnstorming did not become a formal phenomenon until the 1920s.

During World War I, the [[United States]] manufactured a significant number of [[Curtiss JN-4]] "Jenny" [[biplanes]] to train its [[Military aviation|military aviators]] and almost every U.S. airman learned to fly using the plane. After the war the U.S. federal government sold off the surplus material, including the Jennys, for a fraction of its initial value (they had cost the government $5,000 but were being sold for as low as $200).&lt;ref name=southern/&gt; This allowed many servicemen who already knew how to fly the JN-4s, to purchase their own planes. The similar-looking [[Standard J]]-1 biplane was also available.

At the same time, numerous aircraft manufacturing companies sprang up, most going broke after building only a handful of planes. Many of these were reliable and even advanced designs which suffered from the failure of the aviation market to expand as expected, and a number of these found their way into the only active markets—mail carrying, barnstorming, and smuggling. Sometimes a plane and its owner would drift between the three activities as opportunity presented.

Combined with the lack of [[Federal Aviation Regulations]] at the time, these factors allowed barnstorming to flourish.

===Growth and heyday===
Barnstorming was performed not only by former military men, but also by women, minorities, and women minorities (e.g., [[Bessie Coleman]]).&lt;ref name=bessie&gt;{{cite web| author1 = David H. Onkst|title= Women in History: Bessie Coleman|url=https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/nv/about/?cid=nrcs144p2_037528|website=USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service|publisher =[[U.S. Department of Agriculture]]|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, on July 18, 1915, [[Katherine Stinson]] became the first woman in the world to perform a loop.&lt;ref name=southern/&gt; Bessie Coleman, an [[African-American]] woman, "not only thrilled audiences with her skills as a barnstormer, but she also became a [[role model]] for women and African Americans. Her very presence in the air threatened prevailing contemporary stereotypes. She also fought [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] when she could by using her influence as a celebrity".&lt;ref name=bessie/&gt;

"More than any single event, Lindbergh's historic 1927 flight made Americans aware of the potential of commercial aviation, and there followed a boom in aviation activity during 1928 and 1929".&lt;ref name=minnesota/&gt; In fact, [[Charles Lindbergh]] engaged in barnstorming in his early years; Errold Bahl hired him as an assistant, and as a promotional stunt, Lindbergh "volunteered to climb out onto the wing and wave to the crowds below", which came to be known as "wing-walking".&lt;ref name=pbs&gt;{{cite web|title=Daredevil Lindbergh and His Barnstorming Days|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/lindbergh/sfeature/daredevil.html|website=PBS|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulation and decline===
The sensational journalism and economic prosperity that marked the [[Jazz Age]] in the United States allowed barnstormers to publicize aviation and eventually contributed to bringing about regulation and control.&lt;ref name=minnesota/&gt; In 1925, the U.S. government [[United States government role in civil aviation|began regulating aviation]], when it passed the Contract Air Mail Act, which allowed the [[U.S. Post Office]] to hire private airlines to deliver mail, with payments based on the weight of the mail. The following year, President [[Calvin Coolidge]] signed the Air Commerce Act, which shifted the management of air routes to a new branch in the [[U.S. Commerce Department|Department of Commerce]], which was also responsible for "licensing of planes and pilots, establishing safety regulations, and general promotion".&lt;ref name=politico&gt;{{cite news | author1 = Andrew Glass |title= Congress passed Air Commerce Act, May 20, 1926| url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/05/this-day-in-politics-91600.html| work =Politico| date=May 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AvStop&gt;{{cite web|title=The Air Commerce Act of 1926| url= http://avstop.com/history/needregulations/act1926.htm| publisher= AvStop Online Magazine |accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barnstorming "seemed to be founded on bravado, with 'one-upmanship' a major incentive".&lt;ref name=nps&gt;{{cite web|title=Aviation Pioneers| url= http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/aviation/pioneers.htm |website =[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1927, competition among barnstormers resulted in their performing increasingly dangerous tricks, and a rash of highly publicized accidents led to new safety regulations, which led to the demise of barnstorming. Spurred by a perceived need to protect the public and in response to political pressure by local pilots upset at barnstormers stealing their customers, the federal government enacted laws to regulate a fledgling civil aviation sector.

[[File:Defense.gov photo essay 120715-F-RP755-375.jpg|280px|thumbnail| [[AeroSuperBatics Ltd|Breitling Wingwalkers]] ]]
The laws included safety standards and specifications that were virtually impossible for barnstormers to meet, and restrictions on how low in altitude certain tricks could be performed (making it harder for spectators to see what was happening). The military also stopped selling Jennys in the late 1920s. This made it too difficult for barnstormers to make a living. [[Clyde Pangborn]], who was pilot of the two-man aviation team who were the first to cross the [[Pacific Ocean]] nonstop in 1931, ended his barnstorming career in 1931.&lt;ref name=priscilla&gt;{{cite web|author1=Priscilla Long |title=Pangborn, Clyde Edward (1894-1958)|url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;file_id=7495| website=HistoryLink |  date = October 12, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some pilots, however, continued to wander the country giving rides as late as fall 1941.{{fact|date=March 2015}}

== Performances==
===Planning===
"Barnstorming season" ran from early spring until after the harvest and county fairs in the fall. Most barnstorming shows started with a pilot, or team of pilots flying over a small rural town to attract local attention. They would then land at a local farm (hence the "barnstorming") and negotiate for the use of a field as a temporary runway from which to stage an air show and offer airplane rides. After obtaining a base of operation, the pilot or group of aviators would "buzz" the village dropping [[Flyer (pamphlet)|flyers]].&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt; In some towns the arrival of a barnstormer or an aerial troop would lead to a townwide shutdown as people attended the show.

===Stunts===
Barnstormers performed a variety of stunts, with some specializing as stunt pilots or aerialists. Stunt pilots performed a variety of [[aerobatic maneuver]]s, including spins, dives, loop-the-loops and [[barrel roll]]s, while aerialists performed feats of [[wing walking]], stunt [[parachuting]], midair plane transfers, or even playing [[tennis]], target shooting, and dancing on the plane's wings.
Other stunts include nose dives and flying through barns and this sometimes led to pilots crashing their planes.&lt;ref name=southern&gt;{{cite web|title=Barnstorming History |url=http://www.southernbiplanes.com.au/barnstorming/barnstorming-history |website=Southern Biplane Adventures |accessdate=26 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324051634/http://www.southernbiplanes.com.au/barnstorming/barnstorming-history/ |archivedate=24 March 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business===
Barnstormers offered plane rides for a small fee; [[Charles Lindbergh]], for example, charged five dollars for a 15-minute ride in his plane.&lt;ref name=minnesota&gt;{{cite news| author1 =Bruce L. Larson| title=Barnstorming with Lindbergh| url = http://collections.mnhs.org/MNHistoryMagazine/articles/52/v52i06p230-238.pdf |work=Minnesota History |publisher =Minnesota Historical Society|date=Summer 1991| pages = 231–238}}&lt;/ref&gt; However exciting and glamorous, it was not an easy way to make a steady living, and to make ends meet barnstormers, including Charles Lindbergh, had to moonlight as flying instructors, handymen, and sometimes even gas station attendants.&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt; Barnstormers often traded plane rides for room and board, both for commercial lodging and in private homes.&lt;ref name=minnesota/&gt; 

===Flying circuses===
Although barnstormers often worked in solitude or in very small teams, some also put together large "flying circuses" with several planes and stunt people. These acts employed [[promoter (entertainment)|promoters]] to book shows in towns ahead of time. They were the largest and most organized of all of the barnstorming acts. Some of the most famous were “The Five Blackbirds” (an [[African American]] flying group), “The Flying Aces Air Circus”, “The 13 Black Cats”, “Mabel Cody’s Flying Circus”, "Inman Brothers Flying Circus", and the “Gates Flying Circus”,&lt;ref name=allthings/&gt; to which [[Clyde Pangborn]] belonged until 1928.

==Significance==
Barnstorming was the first major form of [[civil aviation]] in the [[history of aviation]].  It was also one of the most popular forms of entertainment during the [[Roaring Twenties]].

At an individual level, barnstorming "provided an exciting and challenging way to make a living, as well as an outlet for their creativity and showmanship", for many pilots and stuntsmen. For example, it allowed [[Charles Lindbergh]] to make a marginal living, and he always spoke fondly of the "old flying days" and the freedom of movement. It was during a barnstorming tour in [[Minnesota]] and [[Wisconsin]] in 1923 that led to his "decision to pursue further formal instruction with the [[U.S. Army Air Service]]".&lt;ref name=minnesota/&gt;

Cadet Squadron 23 at the [[United States Air Force Academy]] is known as the "Barnstormers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CS-23 Patch "Barnstormers"|url=https://shop.usafa.org/products/squadron-patches/cs-23-patch-barnstormers|website=Association of Graduates United States Air Force Academy|publisher=USAFA|accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These fractures may be associated with underlying [[Traumatic brain injury|brain trauma]]. Battle's sign consists of bruising over the [[mastoid process]] as a result of [[extravasation]] of blood along the path of the [[posterior auricular artery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Naumann| first = Hans Heinz |author2=Jan Helms | title = Head and neck surgery | publisher = Thieme | year = 1998 | pages = 154 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MK1brjp6gaEC&amp;pg=PA154&amp;lpg=PA154&amp;dq=%22battle's+sign%22+vein&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6AWfA_t1Im&amp;sig=BjxQ9-_yu4bxBjr6JhEXbtz-VfE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BRduSvixDYio8gTe--GMDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9 |isbn = 0-86577-660-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sign is named after [[William Henry Battle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{WhoNamedIt|synd|2976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Black Like Me''''' (1964) is an American drama film based on the book ''[[Black Like Me]]'' by [[John Howard Griffin]]. The journalist disguised himself to pass as an African-American man for six weeks in 1959 in the Deep South to report on life in the segregated society from the other side of the color line. The film was directed by [[Gerda Lerner|Carl Lerner]] and the screenplay was written by Carl and [[Gerda Lerner]]. The film stars [[James Whitmore]], [[Sorrell Booke]] and [[Roscoe Lee Browne]].

The DVD was released December 11, 2012 in North America from Video Services Corp. The DVD includes a documentary titled ''Uncommon Vision'' about John Howard Griffin, the journalist on which the main character is based.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/59958/black-like-me|title=Black Like Me: DVD Talk Review of the DVD Video|date=February 14, 2013|accessdate=November 10, 2013|website=DVD Talk|last=Hartel|first=Nick|at=The DVD: The Extras|deadurl=no|quote=The film's bonus disc features a 60-min feature length documentary, ''Uncommon Vision: The Life and Times of John Howard Griffin'' on the film's real-life subject.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=September 2015}}
Critical reception for the film has been mixed. Bosley Crowther of ''The New York Times'' described the film as "melodramatic and unsubtle". He said it failed to place the viewer inside a Negro's skin, and to convince the audience that the protagonist "is truly passing for black".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crowther|first1=Bosley|title=Black Like Me (1964) James Whitmore Stars in Book's Adaptation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A0CE5DD1F3AE13ABC4951DFB366838F679EDE|website=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing the film after the 2012 DVD release, Leonard Maltin awarded the film a positive 3 out of 4 stars. He said that, although some aspects of the film felt dated, the film's themes were still timely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Maltin, Leonard]]|title=Leonard Maltin's 2014 Movie Guide|date=2014|publisher=[[Penguin Press]]|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-0-451-41810-4|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Boston Jewish Film Festival''' (BJFF) is an annual film festival that screens the best contemporary films on Jewish themes from around the world. The festival presents features, shorts, documentaries, and conversations with visiting artists in order to explore the [[Jewish identity]], the current Jewish experience and the richness of Jewish culture in relation to a diverse modern world.

==History==
Founded by filmmaker [[Michal Goldman]] in 1989, the Boston Jewish Film Festival has grown from 10 screenings to more than 60 throughout the [[Boston]] area (including [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]], [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]], [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]], and [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] venues (such as the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]] and the [[Coolidge Corner Theatre]]). In the past 27 years, the Festival has presented more than 800 films - many of them US or Massachusetts premieres – and welcomed more than hundreds of thousands audience members. Many of the films that have been shown have gone on to be nominated for or win [[Academy Awards]], including [[The Pianist (2002 film)|The Pianist]] (winner, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay, 2002), [[Nowhere in Africa]] (winner, Best Foreign Film, 2002), and [[The Personals (1998 American film)|The Personals]] (winner, Best Short-Subject Documentary, 1998). Visiting artists are brought in from around the world to introduce their films, answer audience questions, and participate in panel discussions. The Festival also offers many live events, from pre-screening music, to new scores to accompany silent films, to full-fledged post-screening concerts and dance performances.

== Film submission criteria ==
The Annual Festival is a non-competitive event, although since 2002 it has offered audience members the opportunity to cast ballots for favorite Documentary and Feature film and, in 2006, Favorite Short Subject. It screens International and American independent films and videos that highlight the Jewish experience; deal with themes of Jewish culture/heritage/history; and films of particular interest to the Jewish community. The Festival also presents narrative, documentary, animated and experimental works. Projects must be completed in 35mm, 16mm, Beta or 1/2&amp;nbsp;inch. They can be of any length, but must not have previously been screened in the Boston area.

== Year-round programs ==
The Boston Jewish Film Festival has also grown from presenting films once a year at the annual festival to a flourishing year-round arts organization, with programs and screenings taking place nearly every month. Since 1998, the Festival has presented more than 275 films and welcomed another 75,000+ audience members outside the November Festival.

=== Annual festival ===
A fourteen plus day event each November showcasing the best contemporary films from around the world on Jewish themes, accompanied by visiting filmmakers, panel discussions, musical events and more.

=== Work-in-progress event ===
A special screening and reception that brings a filmmaker to present and discuss his/her work from a new, "work-in-progress" film. This event is offered as a thank-you to those who buy Friends passes early.

=== Fall gala ===
The Fall Gala event is the pre-festival kick-off that includes an elegant dinner and a unique film experience.

=== Pre-release and word-of-mouth screenings ===
The Festival often presents a special advance screening, sometimes with a visiting filmmaker or actor. Other times, members are offered free tickets to word-of-mouth screenings at a local theater. These screenings are chances to see films before the general public.

=== Co-presentations ===
The Boston Jewish Film Festival works with other film festivals throughout the year to bring quality films to the Boston area. Some recent and ongoing partners include the [http://www.mfa.org/programs/films Boston French Film Festival], the [http://www.bostonlgbtfilmfest.org/ Boston LGBT Film Festival], the [[Independent Film Festival of Boston]], the [http://www.roxburyfilmfestival.org/ Roxbury International Film Festival] and many more.

=== Curated series and programs ===
From time to time, the Boston Jewish Film Festival curates a special series either independently or in conjunction with another organization. These series are often thematically-based, and have included in the past a series focusing on the question of censorship and freedom of expression as part of the New Center for Arts and Culture’s multi-disciplinary citywide exhibition Words on Fire, as well as a series celebrating pioneering Jewish women in America in conjunction with [http://jwa.org/ Jewish Women’s Archive].

== Former events ==

=== Annual encore series ===
Each spring, with the support of the [http://www.dorot.org/ Dorot Foundation], several of the past year’s fall Festival hits are brought back to the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]] for an annual Encore series. The series begins in late May, continuing to early July.

=== Martha’s Vineyard Hebrew Center Summer Institute ===
Every year between June and August, [[The Boston Jewish Film Festival]] curates a special series of films-on-video in conjunction with the [http://www.mvhc.us/summer_institute.htm Martha’s Vineyard Hebrew Center Summer Institute].

== Recognition ==
In 1999, the Boston Jewish Film Festival was named “Best Film Series” by the [[Boston Society of Film Critics]].

In 2003, Artistic Director Kaj Wilson and Executive Director Sara Rubin were honored with Image Awards for Vision and Excellence by [http://womeninfilmvideo.org/ Women in Film &amp; Video in New England].

In 2004, it hosted the 4th Conference of Jewish Film Festivals, welcoming Jewish Film Festival directors from around the globe to Boston.

In 2006, Executive Director Sara L. Rubin was recognized and honored for her career and her dedication to French culture by the [[Minister of Culture (France)|French Minister of Culture]] by being introduced into [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres|France's Order of Arts and Letters]], with the rank of Chevalier (Knight).

In 2007, departing Artistic Director Kaj Wilson was honored for her work by a commendation from the [[Boston Society of Film Critics]].

The '''Chalisa famine''' of 1783–84 in the [[Indian subcontinent]] followed unusual [[El Niño]] events that began in 1780 and caused droughts throughout the region.&lt;ref name=grove-elnino-80&gt;{{Harvnb|Grove|2007|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Chalisa'' (literally, "of the fortieth" in [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]]) refers to the [[Vikram Samvat]] calendar year 1840 (1783).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bayly|2002|p=503}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The famine affected many parts of [[North India]], especially the [[History of Delhi#17th century to 19th century|Delhi territories]], present-day [[Uttar Pradesh]], Eastern [[Punjab region|Punjab]], [[Rajputana]], and [[Kashmir]], then all ruled by different Indian rulers.&lt;ref name=igi-III-502&gt;{{Harvnb|Imperial Gazetteer of India vol.

Together the two famines may have depopulated many regions of India, including, for example, 17 per cent of the villages in the [[Sirkali]] region of present-day [[Tamil Nadu]],&lt;ref name=grove-elnino-80/&gt; 60 per cent of the villages in the middle [[Doab]] of present-day [[Uttar Pradesh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bayly|2002|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; and over 30 per cent of the villages in the regions around Delhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stokes|1975|pp=508–509}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is thought that up to 11 million people may have died in the two famines.&lt;ref name=grove-elnino-80/&gt;

'''Chichester Street Art Festival''' took place in [[Chichester]], West Sussex, England in May 2013. Street artists decorated a large number of locations throughout the city with street art. 

The festival was jointly organised by Street Art London and [[Neil Lawson Baker]] (CEO of the National Open Art Competition), It was curated by Richard Howard-Griffin of Street Art London.&lt;ref name="city strip"&gt;{{cite news|author=Dean Adams |title=Cllrs campaign for city strip |url=http://issuu.com/love-news-media/docs/ch_107 |work=Chichester Herald |page=1 |date=27 September 2013 |accessdate=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was organised in secret for a year beforehand, going 'live' on 4 May 2013.&lt;ref name="brightens up city"&gt;{{cite news|author= |title=Street art brightens up city |url=http://www.chichester.co.uk/what-s-on/entertainment/street-art-brightens-up-city-1-5048245 |work=Chichester Observer |date=3 May 2013 |accessdate=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art locations included Metro House, Northgate roundabout, the old electric cinema, a private house in North Street, the Superdrug store and Baffins car park. Sixty-one panels were painted around [[Chichester Festival Theatre]].&lt;ref name="city strip" /&gt; The artists were: NUNCA, Liqen, RUN,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RUN New Mural In Chichester, UK |url=http://www.streetartnews.net/2013/05/run-new-mural-in-chichester-uk.html|date=8 May 2013 |publisher=Street Art News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phlegm, ROA, [[Christiaan Nagel]], Cityzen Kane, The Rolling People, Thierry Noir, Stik, Hitnes, and Dscreet.&lt;ref name="brightens up city" /&gt;

“The art will be up as long as people don’t want it taken down, as long as there is no outcry,” Mr Lawson Baker said.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chichester.co.uk/what-s-on/gallery-chichester-street-art-1-5070710&lt;/ref&gt; However, in September 2013 [[councillor]]s argued the work should be removed, claiming residents did not understand why it had been allowed in a [[Conservation Area (United Kingdom)|conservation area]].&lt;ref name="city strip" /&gt;

In [[population dynamics]], '''depensation''' is the effect on a [[population]] (such as a [[fish stock]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Detecting the presence of depensation in collapsed fisheries: The case of the Northern cod stock|first1=Jose M. |last1=Maroto|first2= Manuel|last2= Moran|journal=Ecological Economics|volume=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;) whereby, due to certain causes, a decrease in the breeding population (mature individuals) leads to reduced production and survival of eggs or offspring.&lt;ref name = Quinn&gt;{{cite book |last= Quinn|first= Terrance|date= 25 March 1999|title= Quantitative Fish Dynamics|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5FVBj8jnh6sC&amp;dq=depensation&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|publisher= Oxford University Press|page= 99}}&lt;/ref&gt; The causes may include predation levels rising per offspring (given the same level of overall predator pressure) and the [[allee effect]], particularly the reduced likelihood of finding a mate.

==Critical depensation==
When the level of depensation is high enough that the population is no longer able to sustain itself, it is said to be a '''critical depensation'''. This occurs when the population size has a tendency to decline when the population drops below a certain level (known as the "Critical depensation level").&lt;ref name = Quinn /&gt; Ultimately this may lead to the population or fishery's collapse ([[resource depletion]]), or even [[local extinction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Optimal Control of a Fishery under Critical Depensation|first1=Tapan Kumar |last1=Kar |first2=Swarnakamal |last2=Misra|journal=Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Science|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon of critical depensation may be modelled or defined by a negative second order [[derivative]] of population growth rate with respect of population [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]], which describes a situation where a decline in population biomass is not compensated by a corresponding increase in marginal growth per unit of biomass.

The '''Edinburgh People's Festival''' is an [[arts festival]] in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]] which is intended as a celebration of indigenous talent and cultural entertainment at venues across the city, especially in the outer schemes at prices everyone can afford. It is inspired by the [[1945 Labour Government]] which established the [[Edinburgh Festival]] to be a celebration of the arts 'for the people, by the people'.

The festival was re-established in 2002 by [[Colin Fox (political activist)|Colin Fox]], who was later elected to parliament as a [[Lothians (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|Lothian]] [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSP]] in reaction to high ticket prices at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] and the lack of events away from the city centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3138531.stm|title=Cheap thrills at festivals|date=10 August 2003|accessdate=12 January 2016|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially organised by the [[Scottish Socialist Party]], trade unions and local artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3107345.stm|title='People's Festival' line-up revealed|date=29 July 2003|accessdate=12 January 2016|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It carries on the tradition of the original Edinburgh People's Festival 1951–54 and acknowledges the cultural contribution made by [[Hamish Henderson]], [[Ewan MacColl]], [[Joan Littlewood]], [[Norman Buchan]], [[Joe Corrie]] and [[Councillor Jack Kane]].

==History==

Since 2002 the People's Festival has presented shows in [[Saughton Prison]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/curtain-up-on-edinburgh-people-s-festival-1-1265873|title=Curtain up on Edinburgh People's Festival|date=10 July 2008|accessdate=13 January 2016|publisher=''[[The Scotsman]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edinburgh Royal Infirmary|Edinburgh's Royal Infirmary]], [[the Scottish Parliament]], [[The Stand Comedy Club]], Woodburn Miners Welfare, the BMC Club in Gorgie, [[Artspace]] in [[Craigmillar]] and the North Edinburgh Arts Centre as well as community centres in the North, South, East and West of the city.

'''FamilyOFive''', formerly known as '''DaddyOFive''', was a  [[YouTube]] channel and online alias of '''Michael Christopher '''"'''Mike'''"''' Martin''' (born 1982), which focused on daily [[video blog|vlogging]] and "prank" videos. At its peak, the channel's videos featured Martin, his wife Heather Martin—also known by her online alias MommyOFive—and their children. In 2017, following claims that the parents were [[Child abuse|abusing their children]] in the "prank" videos, the channel became the center of a public controversy, as many saw their content as extreme in nature. 

Created in 2015, the channel achieved success earning up to 176 million video views and around 750,000 subscribers at its peak. However, after the aforementioned controversy, all videos on the channel were removed, and the Martins stopped producing videos on the channel, aside from a formal public apology video. Mike Martin and Heather Martin took an [[Alford plea]] in September 2017 in regards to two counts per person of Maryland state child neglect charges and received supervised probation for five years.

The Martins ceased creating content on the DaddyOFive channel as a result of court ordered probation, but began producing similar content on a new channel called FamilyOFive, which was terminated by [[YouTube]] in July 2018 following renewed interest in the family. However, the Martins have their official website called {{URL|officialfamilyofive.com}}, and a gaming channel on [[Twitch.tv|Twitch]].

==History==
===Creation of channel and rise in popularity===
The channel was created on August 13, 2015;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8lV8KIVWvfsaqOi_d3Wu3w/about|title=DaddyOFive — YouTube about page|publisher=YouTube|language=en|accessdate=June 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the channel's about page says, "we as a FAMILY DECIDED to make this [[YouTube]] channel just for fun."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The channel focused on Mike Martin, his wife Heather and their five children: Jake, Ryan, Emma, Cody, and Alex.&lt;ref name=Cresci2017/&gt; The channel accumulated around 750,000 subscribers and 176 million views, prior to Martin removing the videos from public viewing.&lt;ref name=Cresci2017/&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' and [[New York (magazine)|''New York Magazine'']] reported the videos were made private,&lt;ref name=Cresci2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dunphy2017&gt;{{cite web|last=Dunphy|first=Rachel|url=http://nymag.com/selectall/2017/04/daddyofive-youtube-abuse-controversy-explained.html|title=The Abusive 'Pranks' of YouTube Family Vloggers|work=Select All|publisher=[[New York (magazine)|''New York Magazine'']]|date=April 28, 2017|accessdate=July 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that the videos were deleted.&lt;ref name=Gajanan2017&gt;{{cite web|last=Gajanan|first=Mahita|url=http://time.com/4763981/daddyofive-mike-martin-heather-martin-youtube-prank-custody/|title=YouTube Star DaddyOFive Loses Custody of 2 Children Shown in 'Prank' Videos|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=May 3, 2017|accessdate=July 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ohlheiser2017/&gt;

===Controversy and public response===
The family became the centre of abuse claims following these prank videos which became gradually more extreme,&lt;ref name=Cresci2017/&gt; with many videos involving Martin encouraging his eldest child, Jake, to physically and mentally abuse his younger siblings, often to the point of tears. One such video involved Cody, the youngest child, being thrown through a doorway by Jake and against a bookcase by Martin; he was left with what appeared to be injuries to his face.&lt;ref name=Ohlheiser2017/&gt; American actor, journalist and YouTube personality [[Philip DeFranco]] released a series of videos covering the channel and sharing his distaste for the content they created, starting with "WOW... We Need To Talk About This..." on April 17, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvoLmsXKkYM&amp;t=428s|title=WOW... We Need To Talk About This...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cresci2017/&gt; He primarily focused on a video involving [[invisible ink]] being spilt, and two of the family's children, Cody and Alex, being falsely accused of making the mess. In the video, Cody cries and pleads hysterically after being screamed and sworn at and accused of lying, with Alex also facing a similar treatment from the parents.&lt;ref name=BBC2017&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/39627969/youtube-pranksters-daddyofive-deny-child-abuse-claims|title=YouTube pranksters Daddyofive deny child abuse claims|date=April 18, 2017|work=[[Newsbeat]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|language=en-GB|accessdate=June 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; DeFranco's first video covering the channel was uploaded on April 17,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|last=DeFranco|first=Philip|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvoLmsXKkYM|title=WOW...

===Post-controversy status and plea agreement===
The DaddyOFive channel released a video on July 7 showing text expressing that it is not a dead channel and asking viewers to subscribe to Heather's '''MommyOFive''' channel for new videos and updates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgmUkirW5O8|title=DaddyOFive channel UPDATE!!|work=DaddyOFive|publisher=YouTube|date=July 7, 2017|accessdate=July 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2017, DaddyOFive and MommyOFive channel had around 730,000 subscribers and 4.7 million video views, and around 110,000 subscribers and 2.1 million video views, respectively. Later, they changed their channel name to '''FamilyOFive''' after receiving the silver play button for MommyOFive.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHckarmEbuCogN98ezY2oSQ/about|title=MommyOFive — YouTube about page|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=July 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prosecutors from the Frederick County Circuit Court filed criminal charges against Michael and Heather Martin in August 2017, with each person facing two counts of "neglect of a minor".&lt;ref name=LoosFredPost&gt;{{cite web|author=Loos, Kelsi|url=https://www.fredericknewspost.com/news/crime_and_justice/courts/ijamsville-couple-behind-daddyofive-videos-charged-with-neglect/article_7ac9a5db-5545-5fd9-9329-79d343a330fe.html#tncms-source=article-nav-next|title=Ijamsville couple behind 'DaddyOFive' videos charged with neglect |publisher=''[[The Frederick News Post]]''|accessdate=2017-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 11, 2017, the Martins pleaded guilty by way of an [[Alford plea]] and were sentenced to five years of supervised probation.&lt;ref name=Augenstein&gt;{{cite web|author=Augenstein, Neal|url=http://wtop.com/frederick-county/2017/09/parents-behind-daddyofive-prank-videos-plead-guilty-neglect/|title=‘DaddyOFive’ parents found guilty of neglect, avoid jail |publisher=''[[WTOP-FM]]''|accessdate=September 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final termination===
The FamilyOFive channel, a new outlet for the Martins' videos created while they were on probation, reinstituted the questionable pattern of behavior regarding abuse of the children featured in the videos. The channel was subsequently terminated on July 18, 2018, for violating YouTube's Community Guidelines, according to several news sources, and YouTube now requires videos featuring children to comply with local child labor laws.

===Website comeback===
Despite their final termination, the Martins continue to post videos on their official website behind a monthly $5 subscription fee,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.officialfamilyofive.com/&lt;/ref&gt; and continue streaming gaming videos on their Twitch channel.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.twitch.tv/FamilyOFive&lt;/ref&gt;.

In November 2018, the Martins kids created a new [[YouTube]] channel called ''The Martin Boys''' with no parents.

==Response==
The 2008 Off-Broadway production received generally positive reviews. [[Ben Brantley]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' observed: 
{{quote|This is music that gets into your bloodstream, setting off vibrations you’ll live with for days to come....  If you set aside your basic nervous and circulatory systems, though, you might observe that by the standards of the well-made musical, ''Fela!'' leaves a lot to be desired. The structure of the book ... feels slapdash to the point of confusion. For all the impudence and exuberance of the wall-to-wall music ... a pious haze of [[hagiography]] hangs over the show, creating the blinkered view of a great man martyred. Yet the ascendancy of the music in ''Fela!'', and the three-dimensional translation of it by Mr. Jones and his vibrant design team, makes such criticism irrelevant for as long as you’re in your seat (or out of it, since the audience is regularly encouraged to stand and undulate). Mr. Jones and company have given us an African variation on the same theme [of the energetic rebel] that triumphantly stakes out its own pioneer territory in the expanding land of musicals.&lt;ref&gt;Brantley, Ben. [http://theater2.nytimes.com/2008/09/05/theater/reviews/05fela.html "Afrobeat’s King, Recrowned",] ''The New York Times'', September 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

David Rooney of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' stated: "What it lacks in structure and concision [it] makes up for in heat, energy and sensuality. Like last season's ''[[Passing Strange]]'' and this summer's ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' revival, this dance-intensive bio-portrait aims to be less traditional musical theater than cathartic experience, lacing its communicative passion with infectious euphoria, rebellious anger and heartfelt despair." The review added: "There perhaps could be more texture in the central character portrait, providing deeper insight into the radical showman, and anyone expecting a detailed life story may be disappointed. Fela's questionable attitudes toward women are suggested rather than explored, and his later life, his ongoing political activity and death from AIDS-related illness in 1997 are absent. [The action] is deftly integrated with Peter Nigrini's video projections to create a show that's invigoratingly messy, visceral and transporting."&lt;ref&gt;Rooney, David. [http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117938189.html?categoryid=33&amp;cs=1 "Fela!"] ''Variety'', September 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Les Gutman of the internet magazine ''CurtainUp'' was even more enthusiastic, calling the musical "one of the most visually complete theatrical experiences imaginable" and a "true treasure".&lt;ref&gt;Gutman, Les. [http://www.curtainup.com/fela.html "Fela!"] ''CurtainUp'', September 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The touring production received a positive review from ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''′s J. Kelly Nestruck, who cited Sahr Ngaujah's performance for particular praise, as "channelling the life force of the titular singer" in a "sweat-soaked performance". Nestruck observed that {{blockquote|Lewis and Jones do focus on the more crowd-pleasing elements of Kuti's politics – his embrace of marijuana and attacks on militarism, corruption and corporate imperialism – while slightly brushing over the less palatable elements [...] His own sexually imperialist attitude toward women is underplayed in favour of an emphasis on his worship of his mother, an operatic, otherworldly presence voiced by Melanie Marshall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nestruck|first=J.

In October 2010, radio journalist and disc jockey Tenisio "DJ 5th Wurld" Seanima asked the question  "Are ''FELA!'' musical producers headed for trouble?" in an article describing potential copyright issues breached by the play's writers and producers.&lt;ref&gt;Tenisio Seanima, [http://theshrine.podomatic.com/entry/index/2010-10-11T21_40_29-07_00 "Are 'FELA!' musical producers headed for trouble?"] Podomatic, October 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; This prediction eventually became reality as Seanima later broke the story about ''Fela!'''s producers being sued by writer and historian [[Carlos Moore (writer)|Carlos Moore]], author of Fela's authorized biography entitled ''Fela, Fela! This Bitch of a Life!'' (London: [[Allison &amp; Busby]], 1982).&lt;ref&gt;Tenisio Seanima, "[FELA!] producers...sued [for $5m] for 'ripping off' writer", [http://theshrine.podomatic.com/entry/2011-07-18T06_43_02-07_00 PodOmatic.]&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2011, the dispute between the producers and Moore was settled, it being agreed that all playbills and associated materials would henceforth bear an acknowledgement stating that the musical was inspired by Moore's book. A joint statement was issued announcing that "the matter of Mr Moore’s claims has been resolved to the mutual satisfaction of the parties".&lt;ref&gt;[[Lemn Sissay]], [http://blog.lemnsissay.com/2011/12/18/fela-kuti-biographer-carlos-moore-resolves-case-against-fela-the-musical/ "Carlos Moore resolves case against FELA THE MUSICAL"], The Emperor’s Watchmaker, December 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Moore had been suing for copyright infringement,&lt;ref&gt;Amelia Hill, [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/nov/09/fela-anikulapo-kuti-musical-sued "Fela! musical is sued by biographer; Show based on life of Afrobeat legend Fela Anikulapo Kuti faces $5m lawsuit"], ''The Guardian'', November 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dave Itzkoff, [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/09/fela-musical-is-sued-for-copyright-infringement/ "‘Fela!’ Is Sued for Copyright Infringement"], ''New York Times'', November 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://theshrine.podomatic.com/entry/2011-07-18T06_43_02-07_00 "FELA! producers sued…"], theshrine.podomatic.com, July 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tenisio Seanima, [http://www.the-latest.com/producers-top-musical-sued-ripping-writer "Producers of top musical sued for ‘ripping off’ writer"], The-Latest.com, November 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and was alleged to have asked the courts to close the show.&lt;ref&gt;Dro Ameh, [http://www.modernghana.com/movie/9589/3/the-fela-musical-lawsuit-and-cassava-republic-pres.html "The Fela!

==Plot==
''Fela!'' takes place around 1977, at the height of Fela Kuti's influence as a composer and performer in Nigeria. Kuti was an originator of the [[Afrobeat]] sound, and the musical opens with him addressing the audience from a concert at his club, the Afrika Shrine in Nigeria's largest city, [[Lagos]]. Kuti indicates that the Afrika Shrine had become a hugely popular venue, and a gathering place for youth opposed to Nigeria's military dictatorship. As one critic describes much of the first half of the show:

{{blockquote|It's part musicology lesson as Kuti explains how he discovered the Afrobeat sound by pulling together the drums from West African highlife and the ragged guitars from James Brown with traditional call-and-response vocals. As a front-man-in-training rambling around London in the early 1960s, he absorbed the influences of the two different shades of cool represented by [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Miles Davis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nestruck|first=J. Kelly|title=Unique rhythm of Fela! will carry you away|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/theatre/unique-rhythm-of-fela-will-carry-you-away/article2214763/|accessdate=October 26, 2011|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=October 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kuti reveals how torn he is between his respect for the example set by his mother, Funmilayo, a teacher and Nigerian civil rights activist, and his quest for fame and sometimes hedonism. He gradually becomes more involved in open opposition to Nigeria's military regime, and his lyrics become overtly political. The regime responds to the provocation with increasingly violent retaliation. Kuti perseveres and releases ''[[Zombie (album)|Zombie]]'', an international hit openly critical of the Nigerian government. The show depicts the army raid of Kuti's compound (a commune he called Kalakuta Republic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=May|first=Chris|title=Part 21 - Final Fela Kuti Masterpieces Reissued|url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=38961|publisher=All About Jazz|accessdate=October 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;), reportedly by 1000 soldiers, which followed the release of ''Zombie''. The raid culminates with the torture of Kuti, his wives and other commune residents, and the murder of his mother. The show concludes with a protest staged by Kuti in October 1979, accompanied by his family and members of the Young African Pioneers. The protest was held on the day before General [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] was to retire from the Nigerian presidency for the first time. Kuti held Obasanjo responsible for his mother's death, and publicly defied the regime once again with his protest, leaving a symbolic coffin in front of Obasanjo's residence at the [[Dodan Barracks|Dodan]] army barracks. The show concludes with symbolic coffins being laid on the stage to protest injustices suffered by the people of Nigeria and throughout Africa.

The '''Formula Car Challenge presented by Goodyear''' is a [[National Auto Sport Association]]-affiliated [[car racing]] series, operating in four different regions across the United States: West Coast, South West, East Coast and Mid West. There is also an annual championship involving all four regions. While each region varies in terms of events, the series itself has three classes of competition, all powered by Mazda, with Goodyear Racing tires: Formula Mazda (FM), Pro Formula Mazda (PFM), and the FormulaSPEED2.0 (FS2.0).

The Formula Car Challenge was started in 2005 to allow for a high level of competition in a quality environment without "pro racing budgets."  By 2009 there were four regions in place in key markets of the United States. Goodyear presenting sponsorship was secured in 2010, as was a National Auto Sport Association sanctioned national championship.  Mazdaspeed Contingency Awards associated with the Formula Car Challenge National title have included close to $30,000 in cash, and eligibility for the MAZDASPEED Career Advancement Award.

The '''Gansler Commission''' investigated the contingency contracting crisis in 2007, named after its chair, [[Jacques S. Gansler]], a former Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics.  In August, then [[United States Secretary of the Army]], [[Pete Geren]], established the independent ''Commission on Army Acquisition and Program Management in Expeditionary Operations'' to review recent operations and provide recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Army News Service |url= http://www.army.mil/article/4658/Army_Fights_Contracting_Fraud/ |title= Army Fights Contracting Fraud |publisher=Department of the Army |date=30 August 2007 |accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This commission released what became known as the ''Gansler Report'' in October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Commission on Army Acquisition and Program Management in Expeditionary Operations |url= https://acc.dau.mil/adl/en-US/180366/file/31657/Gansler%20Commission_Report_Final_Report_10-31-07.pdf |title= Urgent Reform Required: Army Expeditionary Contracting |publisher=Department of the Army |date=31 October 2007 |accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contingency Contracting Crisis==

* In August 2006, United States Army Lieutenant Colonel [[Marshall Gutierrez]], a senior logistics officer in Kuwait, was arrested, and was accused of shaking down a laundry contractor for a $3,400 bribe.   After his arrest, he was released to his quarters and was found dead a few days later next to an empty bottle of prescription sleeping pills and an open container of what appeared to be antifreeze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Simpson, Glenn R.| authorlink=Glenn R.

* In October 2006, United States Army Sergeant Denise A. Lannaman, a soldier working for Colonel Gutierrez died of a gunshot wound, perhaps believing she would be interviewed involving the colonel’s contracting improprieties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Dwyer, Jim |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/19/nyregion/19about.html?pagewanted=print |title= From Queens to Kuwait, Where a Life Was Ended |publisher= The New York Times |date=19 September 2007 |accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In December 2006, United States Army Major [[Gloria D.

He was later found guilty and sentenced to 17 and 1/2 years in prison for accepting bribes.
* Besides these high-visibility suicides of contracting and logistics professionals, there were some 20 military and civilian [[United States Army]] employees charged in more than 70 criminal contract-fraud cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Bennett, John|url=http://www.armytimes.com/article/20070829/NEWS/708290314/Two-investigations-aimed-at-contracting-fraud |title= Two investigations aimed at contracting fraud |publisher= Army Times |date=29 August 2007 |accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Findings===

When the ''Gansler Report'' was released on 31 October 2007, Dr. Gansler identified three key findings: not enough people, too little training, and an antiquated contracting system.&lt;ref name=mcmahon&gt;{{cite web|author1=McMahon, Lee  |author2=Sheftick, Gary |url=http://www.army.mil/article/5906/gansler-commission-cites-systemic-problems-in-army-contracting/ |title= Gansler Commission Cites Systemic Problems in Army Contracting |publisher= Army News Release |date=1 November 2007 |accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This report did not address any suspected criminal cases being investigated internally within the Army and the Justice Department.  Although the media recognized this effort as the broadest examination of the problems to date with potentially the most far-reaching recommendations for fixes, Congressional lawmakers were still concerned that the Army took too long in one of their recommendations, that of creating a special contracting corps, one that Congress authorized a few years prior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Schmitt, Eric |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/01/washington/01army.html?pagewanted=print |title= Panel Faults Army’s Wartime Contracting |publisher= The New York Times |date=1 November 2007 |accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recommendations===

The commission outlined four areas as critical to future success:&lt;ref name=mcmahon /&gt;
#Increased stature, quantity and career development for contracting personnel—both military and civilian, particularly for expeditionary operations; 
#Restructure of the organization and responsibility to facilitate contracting and contract management; 
#Provide training and tools for overall contracting activities in expeditionary operations; and 
#Obtain legislative, regulatory, and policy assistance to enable contracting effectiveness, important in expeditionary operations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5086">{{comparison satellite navigation orbits}}
A '''graveyard orbit''', also called a '''junk orbit''' or '''disposal orbit''', is an [[Orbit (physics)|orbit]] that lies away from common operational orbits.  One significant graveyard orbit is a [[supersynchronous orbit]] well above [[geosynchronous orbit]].&lt;!-- as of 2017, there are no common supersynchronous graveyard orbits in common use around non-terran celestial bodies --&gt; Satellites are typically moved into such orbits at the end of their [[operational life]] to reduce the probability of colliding with operational [[spacecraft]] and generating [[space debris]].

==Overview==
A graveyard orbit is used when the change in velocity required to perform a de-orbit [[Orbital maneuver|maneuver]] is too large. De-orbiting a [[geostationary satellite]] requires a [[delta-v]] of about {{convert|1500|m/s}}, whereas re-orbiting it to a graveyard orbit only requires about {{convert|11|m/s}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patentgenius.com/patent/5651515.html Method for re-orbiting a dual-mode propulsion geostationary spacecraft – Patent # 5651515 – PatentGenius&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

For satellites in [[geostationary orbit]] and [[geosynchronous orbit]]s, the graveyard orbit is a few hundred [[kilometer]]s above the operational orbit. The transfer to a graveyard orbit above geostationary orbit requires the same amount of fuel as a satellite needs for about three months of [[stationkeeping]]. It also requires a reliable [[attitude control]] during the transfer maneuver. While most satellite operators try to perform such a maneuver at the end of their satellites' operational lives, through 2005 only about one-third succeeded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMZPBW797E_Protecting_0.html Space debris mitigation: the case for a code of conduct / Operations / Our Activities / ESA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, as of 2011, most recently decommissioned geosynchronous spacecraft were said to have been moved to a graveyard orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Johnson|first=Nicholas |title=Broadcast 1666 (Special Edition) – Topic: Space debris issues |date=2011-12-05 |url=http://www.thespaceshow.com/show/05-dec-2011/broadcast-1666-special-edition |type=podcast |at=1:03:05-1:06:20 |publisher=[[The Space Show]] |editor-first=David |editor-last=Livingston |accessdate=2015-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee]] (IADC)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iadc-online.org/Documents/IADC-UNCOPUOS-final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the minimum [[perigee]] [[altitude]] &lt;math&gt;\Delta{H} \,&lt;/math&gt; above the [[geostationary orbit]] is:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta{H} = 235\mbox{ km} + \left ( 1000 C_R \frac{A}{m} \right )\mbox{ km}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;C_R \,&lt;/math&gt; is the solar radiation pressure coefficient and &lt;math&gt;\frac{A}{m} \,&lt;/math&gt; is the aspect area [m²] to mass [kg] ratio of the satellite. This formula includes about 200&amp;nbsp;km for the GEO-protected zone to also permit orbit maneuvers in GEO without interference with the graveyard orbit. Another {{convert|35|km}} of [[tolerance (engineering)|tolerance]] must be allowed for the effects of [[gravitational perturbation]]s (primarily solar and lunar). The remaining part of the equation considers the effects of the [[solar radiation pressure]], which depends on the physical parameters of the satellite.

In order to obtain a license to provide [[Telecommunication|telecommunications]] services in the United States, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) requires all geostationary satellites launched after March 18, 2002, to commit to moving to a graveyard orbit at the end of their operational life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/spacenews/businessmonday_040628.html |title=FCC Enters Orbital Debris Debate |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050308040713/http://www.space.com/spacenews/businessmonday_040628.html |archivedate=March 8, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. government regulations require a boost, &lt;math&gt;\Delta{H}&lt;/math&gt;, of about 300&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/library/USG_OD_Standard_Practices.pdf | title=US Government Orbital Debris Standard Practices}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Located in the shadow of [[Mount Vesuvius]], '''Herculaneum''' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Ercolano'') was an ancient [[Roman Empire|Roman]] town destroyed by [[volcano|volcanic]] [[pyroclastic flow]]s in 79 AD. Its ruins are located in the ''[[comune]]'' of [[Ercolano]], [[Campania]], Italy.

Herculaneum is one of the few ancient cities to be preserved more or less intact, with no later accretions or modifications. Like its sister city, Pompeii, Herculaneum is famous for having been buried in lava and ash, along with [[Pompeii]], [[Stabiae]], [[Oplontis]] and [[Boscoreale]], during the [[eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79]].

Unlike Pompeii, the heavy blanket of lava that covered Herculaneum carbonized and thereby preserved wood and other organic-based materials such as roofs, beds, doors, and food. Although most of the residents had evacuated the city in advance of the lava, the well-preserved skeletons of 300 people who perished near the seawall were discovered in 1997.

Although it was smaller than Pompeii, Herculaneum was a wealthier town than Pompeii, possessing an extraordinary density of fine houses with, for example, far more lavish use of coloured marble cladding.

==History of Herculaneum==
[[File:Herculaneum, past, present and future (1908) (14596114730).jpg|thumb|300px|left|Herculaneum plan showing buildings below modern town]]
Ancient tradition connected Herculaneum with the name of the Greek hero [[Heracles]] (''[[Hercules]]'' in [[Latin]] and consequently [[Roman Mythology]]),&lt;ref&gt;The [[founding myth]] asserted that Hercules built Herculaneum at the location where he killed [[Cacus]], a son of [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]] who had stolen some of Hercules' cattle.&lt;/ref&gt; an indication that the city was of Greek origin. In fact, it seems that some forefathers of the [[Samnites|Samnite]] tribes of the Italian mainland founded the first civilization on the site of Herculaneum at the end of the 6th century BC. Soon after, the town came under Greek control and was used as a trading post because of its proximity to the [[Gulf of Naples]]. The Greeks named the city Ἡράκλειον, ''Heraklion''. In the 4th century BC, Herculaneum again came under the domination of the Samnites. The city remained under Samnite control until it became a Roman ''municipium'' in 89 BC, when, having participated in the [[Social War (91–88 BC)|Social War]] ("War of The Allies" against Rome), it was defeated by [[Titus Didius]], a legate of [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Sulla]].

After the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD, the town of Herculaneum was buried under approximately 20 metres (50–60&amp;nbsp;feet) of ash. It lay hidden and largely intact until discoveries from wells and underground tunnels became gradually more widely known, and notably following the [[Emmanuel Maurice, Duke of Elbeuf|Prince d'Elbeuf's]] explorations in the early 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wallace-Hadrill|first=Andrew|title=Herculaneum: Past and Future|year=2011|isbn=978-0-7112-3142-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excavations continued sporadically up to the present and today many streets and buildings are visible, although over 75% of the town remains buried. Today, the Italian towns of [[Ercolano]] and [[Portici]] lie on the approximate site of Herculaneum. Until 1969 the town of Ercolano was called [[Resina]]. It changed its name to Ercolano, the Italian modernisation of the ancient name in honour of the old city.

The inhabitants worshipped above all Hercules, who was believed to be the founder of both the town and Mount Vesuvius. Other important deities worshipped include [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] and [[Apollo]], who are depicted in multiple statues in the city.

==The eruption of AD 79==

[[File:Herculaneum - Bronze-Horse.jpg|thumb|Bronze horse excavated at Resina Theater (Herculaneum).]]
{{main|Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79}}

The catastrophic eruption of Mt. Vesuvius occurred on the afternoon of 24 August AD 79. Because Vesuvius had been dormant for approximately 800 years, it was no longer even recognized as a volcano.

Based on archaeological excavations and on two letters of [[Pliny the Younger]] to the Roman historian [[Tacitus]], the course of the eruption can be reconstructed.&lt;ref&gt;Available at the University of Arizona: [http://www.u.arizona.edu/~afutrell/404b/web%20rdgs/pliny%20on%20vesuvius.htm Pliny the Younger, Letters 6.16 and 6.20 to Cornelius Tacitus] and in [[Project Gutenberg]]: [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2811/2811-h/2811-h.htm#link2H_4_0065 Letter LXV — To Tacitus], [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2811/2811-h/2811-h.htm#link2H_4_0066 Letter LXVI — To Cornelius Tacitus]&lt;/ref&gt;

At around 1pm on 24 August, Vesuvius began spewing volcanic ash and stone thousands of meters into the sky. When it reached the [[tropopause]] (the boundary between the [[troposphere]] and the [[stratosphere]]), the top of the cloud flattened, prompting Pliny to describe it to Tacitus as a [[stone pine]] tree. The prevailing winds at the time blew toward the southeast, causing the volcanic material to fall primarily on the city of [[Pompeii]] and the surrounding area. New studies have been carried out on the victims' skeletons and it has been established that some of the minerals stored in the bones are preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0203210|title=A hypothesis of sudden body fluid vaporization in the 79 AD victims of Vesuvius|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;Since Herculaneum lay to the west of Vesuvius, it was only mildly affected by the first phase of the eruption. While roofs in Pompeii collapsed under the weight of falling debris, only a few centimeters of ash fell on Herculaneum, causing little damage but nonetheless prompting most inhabitants to flee.  

During the following night, the eruptive column which had risen into the stratosphere collapsed onto Vesuvius and its flanks. The first [[pyroclastic surge]], formed by a mixture of ash and hot gases, billowed through the mostly evacuated town of Herculaneum at {{convert|160|km/h|abbr=on|-1}}. A succession of six flows and surges buried the city's buildings, causing little damage in some areas and preserving structures, objects and victims almost intact. However, in other areas there was significant damage, knocking down walls, tearing away columns and other large objects;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.herculaneum.ox.ac.uk/files/newsletters/harchissue2.pdf p 3&lt;/ref&gt; a marble statue of M. Nonius Balbus near the baths was blown 15 m away and a carbonised skeleton was found lifted 2.5 m above ground level in the garden of the House of the Relief of Telephus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/ad79eruption/herculaneum-1/insula-oi/house-of-the-relief-of-telephus|title=House of the Relief of Telephus - AD79eruption|website=sites.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent multidisciplinary research on the lethal effects of the pyroclastic surges in the Vesuvius area showed that in the vicinity of Pompeii and Herculaneum, heat was the main cause of the death of people who had previously been thought to have died by ash suffocation. This study shows that exposure to the surges, measuring at least 250&amp;nbsp;°C (482&amp;nbsp;°F) even at a distance of 10 kilometres from the vent, was sufficient to cause the instant death of all residents, even if they were sheltered within buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mastrolorenzo |first=G |author2=Petrone, P |author3=Pappalardo, L |author4=Guarino, FM  |title=Lethal thermal impact at periphery of pyroclastic surges: evidences at Pompeii. |journal=PLoS ONE |date=15 June 2010 |volume=5 |issue=6 |page=e11127 |pmid=20559555 |pmc=2886100 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0011127|bibcode = 2010PLoSO...511127M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeology==
{{wide image|Herculaneum Pano.jpg|900px}}

In 1709 the digging of a deep well revealed some exceptional statues at the lowest levels which was later found to be the site of the theatre. The Prince d'Elbeuf purchased the land and proceeded to tunnel out from the bottom of the well, collecting any statues they could find. Among the earliest statues recovered were the two superbly sculpted Herculaneum Women&lt;ref&gt;THE LARGE AND THE SMALL HERCULANEUM WOMAN, Universita Ca’ Foscari, Venezia, Doctoral Thesis 2014–2015, Angeliki Ntontou&lt;/ref&gt; now in the Dresden [[Skulpturensammlung]].&lt;ref&gt;The Herculaneum Women: And the Origins of Archaeology (J. Paul Getty Museum) – 7 Feb 2008, Daehner&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pergamon Museum Pompeii exhibit.jpg|thumb|Small Herculaneum Woman (Dresden)]]
Major excavation was resumed in 1738 by Spanish engineer [[Rocque Joaquin de Alcubierre]]. The elaborate publication of ''[[Le Antichità di Ercolano]]'' ("The Antiquities of Herculaneum") under the patronage of the [[Charles III of Spain|King of the Two Sicilies]] had an effect on incipient European [[Neoclassicism]] out of all proportion to its limited circulation; in the later 18th century, motifs from Herculaneum began to appear on stylish furnishings, from decorative wall-paintings and tripod tables to perfume burners and teacups. However, excavation ceased once the nearby town of Pompeii was discovered, which was significantly easier to excavate because of the thinner layer of debris covering the site (4 m as opposed to Herculaneum's 20 m).

Barker noted in his 1908 ''Buried Herculaneum'', "By the orders of [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] land was purchased, and in 1828 excavations were begun in two parts 150 feet apart, under the direction of the architect. Carlo Bonucci. In the year 1868 still further purchases of land were made, and excavations were carried on in an eastward direction till 1875. The total area now open measures 300 by 150 perches (1510 by 755 8 metres). The limits of the excavations to the north and east respectively are the modern streets of Vico di Mare and Vico Ferrara. It is here only that any portion of ancient Herculaneum may be seen in the open day."&lt;ref name="Barker"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/buriedherculaneu00barkuoft|title=Buried Herculaneum|author=Ethel Ross Barker|year=1908}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1927 until 1942 a new campaign of excavations was begun by [[Amedeo Maiuri]], which exposed about four hectares of the ancient city in the archaeological park that is visible today.

Excavation resumed briefly in the town in 1980–81 on the ancient shoreline following which the skeletons in the boathouses were found.

From 1996–99 the large area to the north-west of the site was excavated and exposed, including part of the [[Villa of the Papyri]], the north-west baths,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/ad79eruption/herculaneum-1/northwest-insula/northwest-baths|title=Northwest Baths - AD79eruption|website=sites.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the House of the Dionysian Reliefs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/ad79eruption/herculaneum-1/northwest-insula/house-of-the-dionysian-reliefs|title=House of the Dionysian Reliefs - AD79eruption|website=sites.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a large collapsed monument. This area was left in a chaotic state and from 2000–7 further work on conservation of this area was done.

Many public and private buildings, including the forum complex, are yet to be excavated.

{{expand Italian|Scavi archeologici di Ercolano|date=June 2015}}

==The Site==
[[File:Herculanum plan fouilles.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Insulae numbers]]
The buildings at the site are grouped in blocks (insulae), defined by the intersection of the east-west (cardi) and north-south (decumani) streets. Hence we have Insula II – Insula VII running counterclockwise from Insula II. To the east are two additional blocks: Orientalis I (oI) and Orientalis II (oII). To the south of Orientalis I (oI) lies one additional group of buildings known as the "Suburban District" (SD). Individual buildings having their own entrance number. For example, the House of the Deer is labelled (Ins IV, 3).

===The House of Aristides (Ins II, 1)===
[[File:Herculaneum - Lyre and Cupids.jpg|thumb|[[Cupid]]s playing with a [[lyre]], Roman fresco from Herculaneum]]
The first building in insula II is the House of Aristides. The entrance opens directly onto the atrium, but the remains of the house are not particularly well preserved due to damage caused by previous excavations. The lower floor was probably used for storage.

===The House of Argus (Ins II, 2)===
The second house in insula II got its name from a fresco of [[Argus Panoptes|Argus]] and [[Io (mythology)|Io]] which once adorned a reception room off the large peristyle. The fresco is now lost, but its name lives on. This building must have been one of the finer villas in Herculaneum.
The discovery of the house in the late 1820s was notable because it was the first time a second floor had been unearthed in such detail. The excavation revealed a second floor balcony overlooking Cardo III, as well as wooden shelving and cupboards; however, with the passing of time, these elements have been lost.

===The House of the Genius (Ins II, 3)===
To the north of the House of Argus lies the House of the Genius. It has been only partially excavated but it appears to have been a spacious building. The house derives its name from the statue of a cupid that formed part of a candlestick. In the centre of the peristyle are the remains of a rectangular basin.

===The House of the Alcove (Ins IV)===
The house is actually two buildings joined together. As a consequence of this it is a mixture of plain and simple rooms combined with some highly decorated ones.

The atrium is covered, so lacks the usual [[impluvium]]. It retains its original flooring of [[Opus tessellatum|opus tesselatum]] and [[opus sectile]]. Off the atrium is a biclinium richly decorated with frescoes in the fourth style and a large triclinium which originally had a marble floor. A number of other rooms, one of which is the apsed alcove after which the house was named, can be reached via a hall which gets its light from a small courtyard.

===College of the Augustales===

Temple of the [[Sodales Augustales|augustales]] or priests of the [[imperial cult (Ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]].

===Central Thermae===
The Central Thermae were bath houses built around the first century AD. Bath houses were very common at that time, especially in Pompeii and Herculaneum. Per common practice, there were two different bath areas, one for men and the other for women. These houses were extremely popular, attracting many visitors daily. This cultural hub was also home to several works of art, which can be found in various areas of the Central Thermae site.

===Villa of the Papyri===
{{Main|Villa of the Papyri}}
[[File:Affreschi romani - Ercolano - Teseo liberatore1.JPG|thumb|A fresco depicting [[Theseus]], from Herculaneum ([[Ercolano]]), Italy,  45–79 AD]]
The most famous of the luxurious villas at Herculaneum is the "[[Villa of the Papyri]]." It was once identified as the magnificent seafront retreat for [[Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus (consul 58 BC)|Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus]], [[Julius Caesar]]'s father-in-law; however, the objects thought to be associated with Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesonius correspond more closely to a greatly standardized assemblage, and cannot indicate, with certainty, the owner of the villa.&lt;ref&gt;The World of Pompeii. Edited by John J. Dobbins and Pedar W. Foss 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The villa stretches down towards the sea in four terraces. Piso, a literate man who patronized poets and philosophers, built a fine library there, the only one to survive intact from antiquity.

Between 1752 and 1754 a number of blackened unreadable papyrus scrolls were serendipitously recovered from the Villa of the Papyri by workmen. These scrolls became known as the [[Herculaneum papyri|Herculaneum papyri or scrolls]], the majority of which are today stored at the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum|National Library, Naples]]. The scrolls are badly carbonized, but a large number have been unrolled, with varying degrees of success. Computer-enhanced multi-spectral imaging, in the infra-red range, helps make the ink legible. There is now a real prospect that it will be possible to read the unopened rolls using X-rays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.research.uky.edu/odyssey/fall04/seales.html|title=Digital Exploration: Unwrapping the Secrets of Damaged Manuscripts|website=www.research.uky.edu|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same techniques could be applied to the rolls waiting to be discovered in the as-yet unexcavated part of the villa, eliminating the need for potentially damaging the rolls by unrolling them.

A team spent a month in summer 2009, making numerous X-ray scans of two of the rolls that are stored at the [[French Academy of Sciences|French National Academy in Paris]]. They hoped that computer processing would convert the scans into digital images showing the interiors of the rolls and revealing the ancient writing. The main fear, however, was that the Roman writers might have used carbon-based inks, which would be essentially invisible to the scans.
That fear has turned out to be fact.
They had hoped that re-scanning the rolls with more powerful X-ray equipment would reveal the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kentucky.com/news/local/education/article44033310.html|title=UK scientists stymied in effort to read ancient scrolls|website=kentucky|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, subsequent X-rays have still produced nothing legible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kentucky.com/news/local/education/article44033310.html|title=UK scientists stymied in effort to read ancient scrolls|newspaper=kentucky|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Still, the hundreds, possibly thousands of scrolls still buried at the site may yet prove to have legible text someday. As of 2016, research and experimentation has recovered more scrolls and it is suggested that new techniques will allow more to be read without unrolling them.

===Skeletal remains===
[[File:Herculaneum Bootshaeuser.jpg|"Boat houses" where skeletons were found|thumb|250px|"Boat houses" where skeletons were found]]
[[File:Herculaneum - Ercolano - Campania - Italy - July 9th 2013 - 32.jpg|thumb|300px|"Boat houses" with skeletons]]
[[File:Ring Lady.JPG|thumb|220px|right|The skeleton called the "Ring Lady" unearthed in Herculaneum.]]
In 1981, under site administrator Dr. Giuseppe Maggi, excavations initially turned up more than 55 skeletons (30 adult males, 13 adult females and 12 children) on the beach and in the first six boat chambers.  Because earlier excavations had revealed only a few skeletons, it was long thought that nearly all of the inhabitants had managed to escape, but this surprising discovery led to a change of view.  The last inhabitants waiting for rescue from the sea were killed instantly by the intense heat, despite being sheltered from direct impact. The study of victims' postures and the effects on their skeletons indicate that the first surge caused instant death as a result of [[fulminant shock]] due to a temperature of about {{convert|500|°C|°F}}. The intense heat caused contraction of hands and feet and possibly fracture of bones and teeth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mastrolorenzo | first1 = G. | last2 = Petrone | first2 = P.P. | last3 = Pagano | first3 = M. | last4 = Incoronato | first4 = A. | last5 = Baxter | first5 = P.J. | last6 = Canzanella | first6 = A. | last7 = Fattore | first7 = L.  | year = 2001 | title = Herculaneum Victims of Vesuvius in AD 79 | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v410/n6830/pdf/410769a0.pdf | journal = Nature | volume = 410 | issue = 6830| pages = 769–770 |bibcode = 2001Natur.410..769M | doi=10.1038/35071167 | pmid=11298433}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further excavations in the 1990s revealed a total of at least three hundred skeletons huddled close together in twelve arches facing the sea and on the beach, while the town was almost completely evacuated. The "Ring Lady" (see image), named for the rings on her fingers, was discovered in 1982.

Chemical analysis of the remains has led to greater insight into the health and nutrition of the Herculaneum population. Dr. [[Sara C. Bisel]] (1932–1996) was a physical anthropologist and classical archaeologist who played a prominent role in early scientific research at Herculaneum. Her pioneering work in the chemical and physical analysis of skeletons yielded new insights into the nutrition and health of ancient populations. This was considered ground-breaking and helped advance the field of paleodemography. Quantities of lead were found in some of the skeletons, which led some to speculation of lead poisoning. Also the presence of scarring on the pelvis, for instance, may give some indication of the number of children a woman had borne.&lt;ref&gt;Recently Dr [[Estelle Lazer]] of the University of Sydney has questioned some of these findings in ''Resurrecting Pompeii'' (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Casts of skeletons were also produced, to replace the original bones after taphonomic study, scientific documentation and excavation. In contrast to Pompeii, where casts resembling the body features of the victims were produced by filling the body imprints in the ash deposit with plaster, the shape of corpses at Herculaneum could not be preserved, due to the rapid vaporization and replacement of the flesh of the victims by the hot ash (ca. 500&amp;nbsp;°C). A cast of the skeletons unearthed within chamber 10 is on display at the Museum of Anthropology in Naples. The most significant and extensive study of  a sample of the skeletal remains of the Herculaneum victims is that published by Luigi Capasso in 2001. This study which employed X rays has superseded the earlier work by Bisel  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=I fuggiaschi di Ercolano.

==Issues of conservation==
{{main|Conservation issues of Pompeii and Herculaneum}}

[[File:Ercolano.JPG|thumb|Herculaneum, [[Ercolano]], and [[Vesuvius]]]]

The volcanic water, ash and debris covering Herculaneum, along with the extreme heat, left it in a remarkable state of preservation for over 1600 years. However, once excavations began, exposure to the elements began the slow process of deterioration. This was not helped by the methods of archaeology used earlier in the town's excavation, which generally centered around recovering valuable artifacts rather than ensuring the survival of all artifacts. In the early 1980s and under the direction of Dr. [[Sara C. Bisel]], preservation of the skeletal remains became a high priority. The carbonised remains of organic materials, when exposed to the air, deteriorated over a matter of days, and destroyed many of the remains until a way of preserving them was formed.

Today, tourism and vandalism have damaged many of the areas open to the public, and water damage coming from the modern [[Ercolano]] has undermined many of the foundations of the buildings. Reconstruction efforts have often proved counterproductive. However, in modern times conservation efforts have been more successful. Today excavations have been temporarily discontinued, in order to direct all funding to help save the city.

A large number of [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] from Herculaneum are preserved in the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum]].

A private-public partnership, the Herculaneum Conservation Project, has taken a lead restoring Herculaneum. In 2012, [[UNESCO]]’s director general praised Herculaneum as a model “whose best practices surely can be replicated in other similar vast archaeological areas across the world”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Fall and Rise and Fall of Pompeii|url = http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/fall-rise-fall-pompeii-180955732/?no-ist|accessdate = 2015-07-01|first = Joshua|last = Hammer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Insider trading''' is the trading of a [[public company]]'s [[stock]] or other [[security (finance)|securities]] (such as [[bond (finance)|bonds]] or [[Option (finance)|stock options]]) by individuals with access to nonpublic information about the company. In various countries, some kinds of trading based on insider information is illegal. This is because it is seen as unfair to other investors who do not have access to the information, as the investor with insider information could potentially make larger profits than a typical investor could make.

The authors of one study claim that illegal insider trading raises the cost of capital for securities issuers, thus decreasing overall economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/~charvey/Teaching/BA453_2005/BD_The_world.pdf "The World Price of Insider Trading"] by [[Utpal Bhattacharya]] and [[Hazem Daouk]] in the [[Journal of Finance]], Vol. LVII, No. 1 (February 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; However, some economists, such as [[Henry Manne]], have argued that insider trading should be allowed and could, in fact, benefit markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/07/26/insider-trading-makes-us-richer-better-informed-and-could-prevent-corporate-scandals-legalize-it/|title=Insider trading enriches and informs us, and could prevent scandals. Legalize it.|last=Matthews|first=Dylan|date=2013-07-26|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-02-02|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trading by specific insiders, such as employees, is commonly permitted as long as it does not rely on material information not in the [[public domain]]. Many jurisdictions require that such trading be reported so that the transactions can be monitored. In the United States and several other jurisdictions, trading conducted by corporate officers, key employees, directors, or significant shareholders must be reported to the regulator or publicly disclosed, usually within a few business days of the trade. In these cases, insiders in the United States are required to file a [[Form 4]] with the U.S. [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) when buying or selling shares of their own companies.

The rules governing insider trading are complex and vary significantly from country to country. The extent of enforcement also varies from one country to another. The definition of insider in one jurisdiction can be broad, and may cover not only insiders themselves but also any persons related to them, such as brokers, associates and even family members. A person who becomes aware of [[market moving information|non-public information]] and trades on that basis may be guilty of a crime.

==Illegal==
Rules prohibiting or criminalizing insider trading on material non-public information exist in most jurisdictions around the world (Bhattacharya and Daouk, 2002), but the details and the efforts to enforce them vary considerably. In the United States, Sections 16(b) and 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 directly and indirectly address insider trading. The U.S. Congress enacted this law after the stock market crash of 1929.&lt;ref name=Newkirk/&gt; While the United States is generally viewed as making the most serious efforts to enforce its insider trading laws,&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=967482 "Law and the Market: The Impact of Enforcement"] by John C. Coffee, University of Pennsylvania Law Review (December 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; the broader scope of the European model legislation provides a stricter framework against illegal insider trading.&lt;ref name="Masters" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ventoruzzo"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Ventoruzzo |first=Marco |date=19 June 2014 |title=Comparing Insider Trading in the US and Europe |publisher=Harvard Law School |url=https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2014/06/19/comparing-insider-trading-in-the-us-and-europe/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630185840/http://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2014/06/19/comparing-insider-trading-in-the-us-and-europe/ |archive-date=30 June 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the European Union and the United Kingdom all trading on non-public information is, under the rubric of [[market abuse]], subject at a minimum to civil penalties and to possible criminal penalties as well.&lt;ref name="Ventoruzzo" /&gt; UK's [[Financial Conduct Authority]] has the responsibility to investigate and prosecute insider dealing, defined by the [[Criminal Justice Act 1993]].

===Definition of "insider"===
In the United States, Canada, Australia and Germany, for mandatory reporting purposes, corporate insiders are defined as a company's officers, directors and any beneficial owners of more than 10% of a class of the company's equity securities. Trades made by these types of insiders in the company's own stock, based on material non-public information, are considered fraudulent since the insiders are violating the fiduciary duty that they owe to the shareholders. The corporate insider, simply by accepting employment, has undertaken a legal obligation to the shareholders to put the shareholders' interests before their own, in matters related to the corporation. When insiders buy or sell based upon company-owned information, they are violating their obligation to the shareholders.

For example, illegal insider trading would occur if the [[chief executive officer]] of Company A learned (prior to a public announcement) that Company A will be taken over and then bought shares in Company A while knowing that the share price would likely rise.

In the United States and many other jurisdictions, however, "insiders" are not just limited to corporate officials and major shareholders where illegal insider trading is concerned but can include any individual who trades shares based on material non-public information in violation of some duty of trust. This duty may be imputed; for example, in many jurisdictions, in cases of where a corporate insider "tips" a friend about non-public information likely to have an effect on the company's share price, the duty the corporate insider owes the company is now imputed to the friend and the friend violates a duty to the company if he trades on the basis of this information.

===Liability===
Liability for inside trading violations generally cannot be avoided by passing on the information in an "I scratch your back; you scratch mine" or [[quid pro quo]] arrangement if the person receiving the information knew or should have known that the information was material non-public information. In the United States, at least one court has indicated that the insider who releases the non-public information must have done so for an improper purpose. In the case of a person who receives the insider information (called the "tippee"), the tippee must also have been aware that the insider released the information for an improper purpose.&lt;ref name="United States v 2014"&gt;''United States v. Newman'', 773 F.3d 438 (2d Cir. 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

One commentator has argued that if Company A's CEO did not trade on the undisclosed [[takeover]] news, but instead passed the information on to his brother-in-law who traded on it, illegal insider trading would still have occurred (albeit by proxy by passing it on to a "non-insider" so Company A's CEO would not get his hands dirty).&lt;ref name=Harris&gt;Larry Harris, Trading &amp; Exchanges, Oxford Press, Oxford, 2003. Chapter 29 "Insider Trading"&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|589}}

===Misappropriation theory===
A newer view of insider trading, the [[misappropriation]] theory, is now accepted in U.S. law. It states that anyone who misappropriates information from his or her employer and trades on that information in ''any'' stock (either the employer's stock or the company's competitor stocks) may be guilty of insider trading.

===Proof of responsibility===
Proving that someone has been responsible for a trade can be difficult because traders may try to hide behind nominees, offshore companies, and other proxies. The [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] prosecutes over 50 cases each year, with many being settled administratively out of court. The SEC and several [[stock exchange]]s actively monitor trading, looking for suspicious activity.&lt;ref name=cox&gt;{{cite web|last=Cox|first=Charles C.|title=The Law of Insider Trading - How they get caught|url=https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/1986/112086cox.pdf|publisher=Securities and Exchange Commission|accessdate=March 23, 2014|date=November 20, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Levine|first=Matt|title=SEC Insider Trading Investigation Reveals SEC Is Really Good At Insider Trading Investigations, Anyway|url=http://dealbreaker.com/2013/01/sec-insider-trading-investigation-reveals-sec-is-really-good-at-insider-trading-investigations-anyway/|work=Dealbreaker|accessdate=March 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Market Surveillance |url=https://www.nyse.com/regulation/memberorganizations/1022221394213.html |publisher=NYSE EuroNext |accessdate=March 23, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624062204/http://www.nyse.com/regulation/memberorganizations/1022221394213.html |archivedate=June 24, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The SEC does not have criminal enforcement authority, but can refer serious matters to the U.S. Attorney's Office for further investigation and prosecution.

===Trading on information in general===
In the United States and most non-European jurisdictions not all trading on non-public information is illegal insider trading.&lt;ref name="Ventoruzzo" /&gt; For example, a person in a restaurant who hears the CEO of Company A at the next table tell the CFO that the company's profits will be higher than expected and then buys the stock is not guilty of insider trading—unless he or she had some closer connection to the company or company officers.&lt;ref name="Shell"&gt;{{Cite magazine|last=Shell |first=G. Richard |year=2001 |title=When Is It Legal To Trade on Inside Information? |magazine=MIT Sloan Management Review |volume=43 |issue=1 (Fall) |pages=89–90. |url=http://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/when-is-it-legal-to-trade-on-inside-information-2/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even where the tippee is not himself an insider, where the tippee knows that the information is non-public and the information is paid for, or the tipper receives a benefit for giving it, then in the broader-scope jurisdictions the subsequent trading is illegal.&lt;ref name="Shell" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Savage" /&gt;

Notwithstanding, information about a [[tender offer]] (usually regarding a merger or acquisition) is held to a higher standard. If this type of information is obtained (directly or indirectly) and there is reason to believe it is nonpublic, there is a duty to disclose it or abstain from trading.&lt;ref&gt;17 C.F.R. 240.14e-3&lt;/ref&gt;

The punishment for insider trading depends on a few different factors. There are three main factors, which can be identified. Depending on jurisdictions, there may be either civil or criminal penalties, or both.
*  Scope – How many people were affected by the wrongdoing?
*  Gain – How much did the insider make from the transaction, whether directly or as a tipster? Where there is a tipster and a tippee, how much did the tippee make from the transaction?
*  Evidence – Anyone charged is innocent until proven guilty. The burden of proof falls on the prosecution. If no one "flips", or if there is no smoking gun, the prosecution has a harder time proving guilt. This may result in prosecution moving away from criminal charges, and instead choosing to pursue civil charges.

In the United States in addition to civil penalties, the trader may also be subject to criminal prosecution for fraud or where SEC regulations have been broken, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) may be called to conduct an independent parallel investigation. If the DOJ finds criminal wrongdoing, the Department may file criminal charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raiser|first=Steve|title=Raiser &amp; Kenniff|url=http://www.raiserkenniff.com.php53-5.dfw1-2.websitetestlink.com/insider-trading-when-is-it-civil-or-criminal/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105020113/http://www.raiserkenniff.com.php53-5.dfw1-2.websitetestlink.com/insider-trading-when-is-it-civil-or-criminal/|archivedate=2013-11-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tracking===
Since insiders are required to report their trades, others often track these traders, and there is a school of investing that follows the lead of insiders. Following such leads subjects the follower to the risk that an insider is buying specifically to increase investor confidence, or is selling for reasons unrelated to the health of the company (such as a desire to diversify or pay a personal expense).

==Legal==
Legal trades by insiders are common,&lt;ref name=Newkirk&gt;Thomas Newkirk. (1998). [https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speecharchive/1998/spch221.htm Speech by SEC Staff: Insider Trading – A U.S. Perspective]. 16th International Symposium on Economic Crime at Jesus College, Cambridge, England on September 19, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; as employees of [[public company|publicly traded]] [[corporation]]s often have stock or stock options. These trades are made public in the United States through [[SEC filing|Securities and Exchange Commission filings]], mainly [[Form 4]].

U.S. [[SEC Rule 10b5-1]] clarified that the prohibition against insider trading does not require proof that an insider actually used material nonpublic information when conducting a trade; possession of such information alone is sufficient to violate the provision, and the SEC would infer that an insider in possession of material nonpublic information used this information when conducting a trade. However, SEC Rule 10b5-1 also created for insiders an [[affirmative defense]] if the insider can demonstrate that the trades conducted on behalf of the insider were conducted as part of a pre-existing [[contract]] or written binding plan for trading in the future.&lt;ref name=Stein2001&gt;Stuart Stein. (2001). [https://web.archive.org/web/20081218133714/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa5344/is_200107/ai_n21474661 New standards for "legal" insider trading].{{dead link|date=September 2014}} ''Community Banker''.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, if an insider expects to retire after a specific period of time and, as part of retirement planning, the insider has adopted a written binding plan to sell a specific amount of the company's stock every month for two years, and the insider later comes into possession of material nonpublic information about the company, trades based on the original plan might not constitute prohibited insider trading.

==United States law==
Until the 21st century and the European Union's [[market abuse]] laws, the United States was the leading country in prohibiting insider trading made on the basis of material non-public information.&lt;ref name="Ventoruzzo" /&gt; Thomas Newkirk and Melissa Robertson of the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) summarize the development of US insider trading laws.&lt;ref name=Newkirk/&gt; Insider trading has a base offense level of 8, which puts it in Zone A under the [[U.S. Sentencing Guidelines]]. This means that first-time offenders are eligible to receive probation rather than incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S.S.G. §2B1.4 |url=http://www.ussc.gov/2009guid/2b1_4.htm |postscript={{inconsistent citations}} |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618144017/http://www.ussc.gov/2009guid/2b1_4.htm |archivedate=2010-06-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statutory===
U.S. insider trading prohibitions are based on English and American common law prohibitions against fraud. In 1909, well before the Securities Exchange Act was passed, the United States Supreme Court ruled that a corporate director who bought that company's stock when he knew the stock's price was about to increase committed fraud by buying but not disclosing his inside information.

Section 15 of the [[Securities Act of 1933]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/about/laws/sa33.pdf |title=Securities Exchange Act of 1933 |format=PDF |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; contained prohibitions of fraud in the sale of securities, later greatly strengthened by the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/about/laws/sea34.pdf |title=Securities Exchange Act of 1934 |format=PDF |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 16(b) of the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] prohibits short-swing profits (from any purchases and sales within any six-month period) made by corporate directors, officers, or stockholders owning more than 10% of a firm's shares. Under Section 10(b) of the 1934 Act, [[SEC Rule 10b-5]], prohibits fraud related to securities trading.

The Insider Trading Sanctions Act of 1984 and the Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988 place penalties for illegal insider trading as high as three times the amount of profit gained or loss avoided from the illegal trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Thomsen LT|url=https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/2006/ts092606lct.htm |title=Testimony Concerning Insider Trading |publisher=SEC|accessdate=December 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SEC regulations===
SEC [[Regulation Fair Disclosure|regulation FD ("Fair Disclosure")]] requires that if a company intentionally discloses material non-public information to one person, it must simultaneously disclose that information to the public at large. In the case of an unintentional disclosure of material non-public information to one person, the company must make a public disclosure "promptly."&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt;{{rp|586}}

Insider trading, or similar practices, are also regulated by the SEC under its rules on [[takeover]]s and [[tender offer]]s under the [[Williams Act]].

===Court decisions===
Much of the development of insider trading law has resulted from court decisions.

In 1909, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled in ''Strong v. Repide''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/213/419/ |title=Strong v. Repide – 213 U.S. 419 (1909) :: Justia US Supreme Court Center |publisher=Supreme.justia.com |accessdate=August 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that a director who expects to act in a way that affects the value of shares cannot use that knowledge to acquire shares from those who do not know of the expected action. Even though, in general, ordinary relations between directors and shareholders in a business corporation are not of such a fiduciary nature as to make it the duty of a director to disclose to a shareholder general knowledge regarding the value of the shares of the company before he purchases any from a shareholder, some cases involve special facts that impose such duty.

In 1968, the [[Second Circuit Court of Appeals]] advanced a "level playing field" theory of insider trading in ''SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co.''&lt;ref&gt;''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8550821722818303653 Securities and Exchange Com'n v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co.]'', 401 F. 2d 833 (2d Cir. 1968)&lt;/ref&gt; The court stated that anyone in possession of inside information must either disclose the information or refrain from trading. Officers of the [[Texas Gulf Sulfur Company|Texas Gulf Sulphur Company]] had used inside information about the discovery of the [[Kidd Mine]] to make profits by buying shares and call options on company stock.&lt;ref name=brooks&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brooks|first=John|title=A Reasonable Amount of Time|journal=The New Yorker|date=November 9, 1968|pages=160–188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled in the case of ''Dirks v. Securities and Exchange Commission''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=463&amp;invol=646 |title=FindLaw &amp;#124; Cases and Codes |publisher=Caselaw.lp.findlaw.com |accessdate=August 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that tippees (receivers of second-hand information) are liable if they had reason to believe that the tipper had breached a fiduciary duty in disclosing confidential information. One such example would be if the tipper received any personal benefit from the disclosure, thereby breaching his or her duty of loyalty to the company. In ''Dirks'', the "tippee" received confidential information from an insider, a former employee of a company. The reason the insider disclosed the information to the tippee, and the reason the tippee disclosed the information to third parties, was to blow the whistle on massive fraud at the company. As a result of the tippee's efforts the fraud was uncovered, and the company went into bankruptcy. But, while the tippee had given the "inside" information to clients who made profits from the information, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the tippee could not be held liable under the federal securities laws—for the simple reason that the insider from whom he received the information was not releasing the information for an improper purpose (a personal benefit), but rather for the purpose of exposing the fraud. The Supreme Court ruled that the tippee could not have been aiding and abetting a securities law violation committed by the insider—for the simple reason that no securities law violation had been committed by the insider.

In ''Dirks'', the Supreme Court also defined the concept of "constructive insiders," who are lawyers, investment bankers and others who receive confidential information from a corporation while providing services to the corporation. Constructive insiders are also liable for insider trading violations if the corporation expects the information to remain confidential, since they acquire the fiduciary duties of the true insider.

The next expansion of insider trading liability came in ''SEC vs. Materia''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leagle.com/decision/1984942745F2d197_1924.xml/S.E.C.%20v.%20MATERIA |title=S.E.C. V. Materia |publisher=Leagle.com |accessdate=March 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 745 F.2d 197 (2d Cir. 1984), the case that first introduced the misappropriation theory of liability for insider trading. Materia, a financial printing firm proofreader, and clearly not an insider by any definition, was found to have determined the identity of takeover targets based on proofreading tender offer documents during his employment. After a two-week trial, the district court found him liable for insider trading, and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed holding that the theft of information from an employer, and the use of that information to purchase or sell securities in another entity, constituted a fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of a securities. The misappropriation theory of insider trading was born, and liability further expanded to encompass a larger group of outsiders.

In ''United States v. Carpenter''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=484&amp;invol=19 |title=FindLaw &amp;#124; Cases and Codes |publisher=Caselaw.lp.findlaw.com |accessdate=August 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1986) the U.S. Supreme Court cited an earlier ruling while unanimously upholding mail and wire fraud convictions for a defendant who received his information from a journalist rather than from the company itself. The journalist [[R. Foster Winans]] was also convicted, on the grounds that he had misappropriated information belonging to his employer, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''. In that widely publicized case, Winans traded in advance of "Heard on the Street" columns appearing in the Journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Christopher |last=Cox |authorlink=Christopher Cox |publisher=U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission |url=https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2006/spch050106cc.htm |title=Speech by SEC Chairman: Remarks at the Annual Meeting of the Society of American Business Editors and Writers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court stated in ''Carpenter'': "It is well established, as a general proposition, that a person who acquires special knowledge or information by virtue of a confidential or fiduciary relationship with another is not free to exploit that knowledge or information for his own personal benefit but must account to his principal for any profits derived therefrom."

However, in upholding the securities fraud (insider trading) convictions, the justices were evenly split.

In 1997, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] adopted the misappropriation theory of insider trading in ''United States v. O'Hagan'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/96-842.ZO.html |title=United States v. O'Hagan, 117 S.Ct. 2199, 138 L.Ed.2d 724 (1997) |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |accessdate=August 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 521 U.S. 642, 655 (1997). O'Hagan was a partner in a law firm representing [[Diageo|Grand Metropolitan]], while it was considering a tender offer for [[Pillsbury Company]]. O'Hagan used this inside information by buying call options on Pillsbury stock, resulting in profits of over $4.3 million. O'Hagan claimed that neither he nor his firm owed a fiduciary duty to Pillsbury, so he did not commit fraud by purchasing Pillsbury options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.com/regionals/ca/briefing/wilson/wilson21.html |title=Law.com |publisher=Law.com |date=June 25, 1997 |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court rejected O'Hagan's arguments and upheld his conviction.

The "misappropriation theory" holds that a person commits fraud "in connection with" a securities transaction and thereby violates 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, when he misappropriates confidential information for securities trading purposes, in breach of a duty owed to the source of the information. Under this theory, a fiduciary's undisclosed, self-serving use of a principal's information to purchase or sell securities, in breach of a duty of loyalty and confidentiality, defrauds the principal of the exclusive use of the information. In lieu of premising liability on a fiduciary relationship between company insider and purchaser or seller of the company's stock, the misappropriation theory premises liability on a fiduciary-turned-trader's deception of those who entrusted him with access to confidential information.

The Court specifically recognized that a corporation's information is its property: "A company's confidential information ... qualifies as property to which the company has a right of exclusive use. The undisclosed misappropriation of such information in violation of a fiduciary duty ... constitutes fraud akin to embezzlement – the fraudulent appropriation to one's own use of the money or goods entrusted to one's care by another."

In 2000, the SEC enacted [[SEC Rule 10b5-1]], which defined trading "on the basis of" inside information as any time a person trades while aware of material nonpublic information. It is no longer a defense for one to say that one would have made the trade anyway. The rule also created an [[affirmative defense]] for pre-planned trades.

In 2014, in the case of ''United States v. Newman'', the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit cited the Supreme Court's decision in ''Dirks'', and ruled that for a "tippee" (a person who used information they received from an insider) to be guilty of insider trading, the tippee must have been aware not only that the information was insider information, but must also have been aware that the insider released the information for an improper purpose (such as a personal benefit). The Court concluded that the insider's breach of a fiduciary duty not to release confidential information—in the absence of an improper purpose on the part of the insider—is not enough to impose criminal liability on either the insider or the tippee.&lt;ref name="United States v 2014"/&gt;

In 2016, in the case of ''Salman v. United States'', the U.S. Supreme Court held that the benefit a tipper must receive as predicate for an insider-trader prosecution of a tippee need not be pecuniary, and that giving a 'gift' of a tip to a family member is presumptively an act for the personal though intangible benefit of the tipper.&lt;ref name="Savage"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Savage |first=David G. |date=6 December 2016 |title=Supreme Court affirms broad reach of insider-trading laws |newspaper=The Los Angeles Times |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-supreme-court-insider-trading-20161206-story.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161207135034/http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-supreme-court-insider-trading-20161206-story.html |archive-date=7 December 2016 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===By members of Congress===
Members of the [[US Congress]] are exempt from the laws that ban insider trading. Because they generally do not have a confidential relationship with the source of the information they receive, however, they do not meet the usual definition of an "insider." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18560_162-57323527/congress-trading-stock-on-inside-information/ Congress: Trading stock on inside information?], CBS News, November 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; House of Representatives rules&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oce.house.gov/pdf/2008_House_Ethics_Manual.pdf |title=House Ethics Manual (2008) |format=PDF |accessdate=December 21, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118033300/http://oce.house.gov/pdf/2008_House_Ethics_Manual.pdf |archive-date=2012-01-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; may however consider congressional insider trading unethical.

In May 2007, a bill entitled the "Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act, or [[STOCK Act]]" was introduced that would hold congressional and federal employees liable for stock trades they made using information they gained through their jobs and also regulate analysts or "Political Intelligence" firms that research government activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Daniel |last=Gross |authorlink=Daniel Gross |title=Insider Trading, Congressional-Style |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2166664/fr/rss/%20slate.com |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |publisher=[[The Washington Post Company]] |date=May 21, 2007 |accessdate=May 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2012 [[STOCK Act]] was passed on April 4, 2012.

===With Congress-sourced information===

In 2014, federal prosecutors issued a subpoena to the [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|House Ways and Means committee]] and Brian Sutter, staff director of its health-care sub-committee, relative to a price move in stocks just prior to the passage of a law favorable to the companies involved. An e-mail was sent out by a "Washington-based policy-research firm that predicted the change [in the law] for its Wall Street clients. That alert, in turn, was based in part on information provided to the firm by a former congressional health-care aide turned lobbyist, according to emails reviewed by the ''[Wall Street] Journal''" in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Mullins, Brody, and Andrew Ackerman, [http://www.marketwatch.com/story/prosecutors-subpoena-congress-in-trading-probe-2014-06-18 "Prosecutors subpoena Congress in trading probe"], ''[[MarketWatch]]'', June 18, 2014.

==Security analysis==
[[Security analysis|Security analysts]] gather and compile information, talk to corporate officers and other insiders, and issue recommendations to traders. Thus their activities may easily cross legal lines if they are not especially careful. The [[CFA Institute]] in its code of ethics states that analysts should make every effort to make all reports available to all the broker's clients on a timely basis. Analysts should never report material nonpublic information, except in an effort to make that information available to the general public. Nevertheless, analysts' reports may contain a variety of information that is "pieced together" without violating insider trading laws, under the [[Mosaic theory (investments)|Mosaic theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mosaictheory.asp |title=Investopedia.com – Mosaic Theory |publisher=Investopedia.com |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This information may include non-material nonpublic information as well as material public information, which may increase in value when properly compiled and documented.

==Arguments for legalizing==
Some economists and legal scholars (such as [[Henry Manne]], [[Milton Friedman]], [[Thomas Sowell]], [[Daniel Fischel]], and [[Frank H. Easterbrook]]) have argued that laws against insider trading should be repealed. They claim that insider trading based on material nonpublic information benefits investors, in general, by more quickly introducing new information into the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/james-altucher/should-insider-trading-be_b_324409.html |title=James Altucher: Should Insider Trading Be Made Legal? |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=October 20, 2009|accessdate=December 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedman, laureate of the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics]], said: "You want more insider trading, not less. You want to give the people most likely to have knowledge about deficiencies of the company an incentive to make the public aware of that." Friedman did not believe that the trader should be required to make his trade known to the public, because the buying or selling pressure itself is information for the market.&lt;ref name="Harris" /&gt;{{rp|591–7}}

Other critics argue that insider trading is a victimless act: a willing buyer and a willing seller agree to trade property that the seller rightfully owns, with no prior contract (according to this view) having been made between the parties to refrain from trading if there is [[asymmetric information]]. [[The Atlantic]] has described the process as "arguably the closest thing that modern finance has to a victimless crime."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/11/capitol-gains/8692/ |title=Capitol Gains – Magazine |publisher=The Atlantic |date=October 3, 2011 |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legalization advocates also question why "trading" where one party has more information than the other is legal in other markets, such as [[real estate]], but not in the stock market. For example, if a [[geology|geologist]] knows there is a high likelihood of the discovery of [[petroleum]] under Farmer Smith's land, he may be entitled to make Smith an offer for the land, and buy it, without first telling Farmer Smith of the geological data.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} 

Advocates of legalization make free speech arguments. Punishment for communicating about a development pertinent to the next day's stock price might seem an act of censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walterblock.com/wp-content/uploads/publications/information_privilege.pdf |title="Information, Privilege, Opportunity, and Insider Trading" in the Northern Illinois University Law Review |format=PDF |accessdate=January 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the information being conveyed is proprietary information and the corporate insider has contracted to not expose it, he has no more right to communicate it than he would to tell others about the company's confidential new product designs, formulas, or bank account passwords.

Some authors have used these arguments to propose legalizing insider trading on negative information (but not on positive information). Since negative information is often withheld from the market, trading on such information has a higher value for the market than trading on positive information.&lt;ref&gt;Kristoffel Grechenig, The Marginal Incentive of Insider Trading: An Economic Reinterpretation of the Case Law, University of Memphis Law Review 2006, vol. 37,  p. 75-148 [http://ssrn.com/abstract=883642 (link)].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Macey, Jonathan. "Getting the word out about fraud: a theoretical analysis of whistleblowing and insider trading." Michigan Law Review (2007): 1899-1940.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are very limited laws against "insider trading" in the commodities markets if, for no other reason than that the concept of an "insider" is not immediately analogous to commodities themselves (corn, wheat, steel, etc.). However, analogous activities such as [[front running]] are illegal under US commodity and futures trading laws. For example, a [[commodity broker]] can be charged with fraud by receiving  a large purchase order from a client (one likely to affect the price of that commodity) and then purchasing that commodity before executing the client's order to benefit from the anticipated price increase.

==Commercialisation==
The advent of the Internet has provided a forum for the [[commercialisation]] of trading on insider information. In 2016 a number of [[dark web]] sites were identified as marketplaces where such non-public information was bought and sold. At least one such site used [[bitcoin]]s to avoid currency restrictions and to impede tracking. Such sites also provide a place for soliciting for corporate informants, where non-public information may be used for purposes&lt;ref&gt;Such purposes include [[competitor analysis]] for [[competitive advantage]], providing a basis for [[sabotage]], and gaining advantage in [[Intragroup conflict|internicine feuding]].&lt;/ref&gt; other than stock trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Uchill |first=Joe |date=1 February 2017 |title=Report: Leakers sell inside trading tips on dark web |newspaper=The Hill |url=http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/317377-report-leakers-sell-inside-trading-tips-on-dark-web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214195423/http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/317377-report-leakers-sell-inside-trading-tips-on-dark-web |archive-date=14 February 2017 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal differences among jurisdictions==
The US and the UK vary in the way the law is interpreted and applied with regard to insider trading. In the UK, the relevant laws are the [[Criminal Justice Act 1993]], Part V, Schedule 1; the [[Financial Services and Markets Act 2000]], which defines an offence of "[[Market Abuse]]";&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Kern |first=Alexander |title=Insider Dealing and Market Abuse: The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 |publisher=Centre for Business Research, University of Cambridge |date=December 2001 |url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/7151265.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215195343/https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/7151265.pdf |archive-date=15 February 2017 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the European Union Regulation No 596/2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title= Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on market abuse |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32014R0596 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Market abuse |publisher=Financial Conduct Authority (FCU) |url=https://www.fca.org.uk/markets/market-abuse |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109173744/https://www.fca.org.uk/markets/market-abuse |archive-date=9 November 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle is that it is illegal to trade on the basis of market-sensitive information that is not generally known.  This is a much broader scope that under U.S. law. The key differences from U.S. law are that no relationship to either the issuer of the security or the tipster is required; all that is required is that the guilty party traded (or caused trading) whilst having inside information, and there is no [[scienter]] requirement under UK law.&lt;ref name="Masters"&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Masters |first1=Brooke |last2=McCrum |first2=Dan |date=26 January 2012 |title=Gulf between US and UK ‘insider trading’ |newspaper=[[Financial Times]] |url=https://www.ft.com/content/d2f943ae-4811-11e1-a4e5-00144feabdc0 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Market Abuse) – Regulations 2016 |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2016/680/pdfs/uksi_20160680_en.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214202307/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2016/680/pdfs/uksi_20160680_en.pdf |archive-date=14 February 2017 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first1=Caroline |last1=Binham |first2=Martin |last2=Arnold |title=Bank of England governor Mark Carney to extend market abuse rules

Japan enacted its first law against insider trading in 1988. Roderick Seeman said, "Even today many Japanese do not understand why this is illegal.

The [[International Organization of Securities Commissions]] (IOSCO) paper on the "Objectives and Principles of Securities Regulation" (updated to 2003)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD154.pdf |title=Objectives and Principles of Securities Regulation |publisher=[[International Organization of Securities Commissions]] (IOSCO) |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050829080215/http://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD154.pdf |archive-date=29 August 2005 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that the three objectives of good securities market regulation are:
# Investor protection,
# Insuring that markets are fair, efficient and transparent, and
# Reducing [[systemic risk]].

The discussion of these "Core Principles" state that "investor protection" in this context means "Investors should be protected from misleading, manipulative or fraudulent practices, including insider trading, [[front running]] or trading ahead of customers and the misuse of client assets." More than 85 percent of the world's securities and commodities market regulators are members of IOSCO and have signed on to these Core Principles.

The [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund]] now use the IOSCO Core Principles in reviewing the financial health of different country's regulatory systems as part of these organization's financial sector assessment program, so laws against insider trading based on non-public information are now expected by the international community. Enforcement of insider trading laws varies widely from country to country, but the vast majority of jurisdictions now outlaw the practice, at least in principle.

Larry Harris claims that differences in the effectiveness with which countries restrict insider trading help to explain the differences in [[executive compensation]] among those countries. The US, for example, has much higher CEO salaries than do Japan or Germany, where insider trading is less effectively restrained.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt;{{rp|593}}

==By nation==

===European Union===
In 2014, the European Union (EU) adopted legislation (Criminal Sanctions for Market Abuse Directive) that harmonises criminal sanctions for insider dealing.

Although insider trading in the UK has been illegal since 1980, it proved difficult to successfully prosecute individuals accused of insider trading. There were a number of notorious cases where individuals were able to escape prosecution. Instead the UK regulators relied on a series of fines to punish market abuses.

These fines were widely perceived as an ineffective deterrent (Cole, 2007),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cole|first=Margaret|title=Insider dealing in the City|url=http://www.fsa.gov.uk/library/communication/speeches/2007/0317_mc.shtml|work=Financial Services Authority|accessdate=December 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there was a statement of intent by the UK regulator (the Financial Services Authority) to use its powers to enforce the legislation (specifically the [[Financial Services and Markets Act 2000]]). Between 2009–2012 the FSA secured 14 convictions in relation to insider dealing.

===United States===
[[Rajat Gupta]], who had been managing partner of [[McKinsey &amp; Co.]] and a director at [[Goldman Sachs]] Group Inc. and [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] Co., was convicted by a federal jury in 2012 of leaking inside information to [[hedge fund]] manager [[Raj Rajaratnam]].

In 2017, [[Billy Walters (gambler)|Billy Walters]], [[Las Vegas]] sports bettor, was convicted of making $40 million on private information of Dallas-based dairy processing company [[Dean Foods]]. Walters's source, company director Thomas C. Davis employing a prepaid cell phone and sometimes the code words "Dallas Cowboys" for Dean Foods, helped him from 2008 to 2014 realize profits and avoid losses in the stock, the Federal jury found. In the trial, investor [[Carl C. Icahn]] was mentioned in relation to Walters's trading but was not charged with wrongdoing. Golfer [[Phil Mickelson]] "was also mentioned during the trial as someone who had traded in Dean Foods shares and once owed nearly $2 million in gambling debts to" Walters.

===India===
Insider Trading in India is an offense according to Section 195 of the Companies Act, 2013 and Sections 12A, 15G of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992. Insider trading is when one with access to non public, price sensitive information about the securities of the company subscribes, buys, sells or deals, or agrees to do so or counsels another to do as principal or agent. Price sensitive information is information that materially affects the value of the securities.
The penalty for insider trading is imprisonment, which may extend to five years, and a minimum of five lakh rupees (five hundred thousand) to twenty five crore rupees (two hundred and fifty million) or three times the profit made, whichever is higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite |title=The Companies Act |year=2013 |publisher=Ministry Of Corporate Affairs, Government of India |url=http://www.mca.gov.in/Ministry/pdf/CompaniesAct2013.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205215453/http://mca.gov.in/Ministry/pdf/CompaniesAct2013.pdf |archive-date=5 December 2013 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Standards for Legal Insider Trading====
Insider trading is legal as long as disclosure of the holdings and trading in securities of the company is done by the insiders. Any other connected person or group of connected persons shall also disclose their holdings under this regulation.

===== SEBI Guidelines For Disclosures of Trading by Insiders=====
1. Promoters, key managerial personnel and director of every company whose securities are listed on any recognized exchange shall disclose his holding of securities within 30 days of these regulations taking effect to the company.

2. Every person on appointment as key managerial personnel, director of the company or upon becoming a promoter shall disclose his holding of securities of company within 7 days of such appointment to the company.

3. Every promoter, director or employee of the company shall disclose to the company, the number of securities acquired or disposed of within two days of such transaction, if the value of securities traded  through one transaction or series of transaction in a calendar quarter exceeds 10 lakh rupees or any other value as may be prescribed.

4. Company needs to inform within two days of receipt of such disclosure to the stock exchange.

5. Disclosure by the connected person shall be made as required by the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Insider Trading |url=http://adityatrading.in/insider-trading.aspx|date=February 14, 2017|work=[[Aditya Trading Solutions]] |accessdate=February 14, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal acts==
===Malicious claims on blog===
Bonehill-Paine's blog, ''The Daily Bale'', ran hoax stories which were repeated as fact on social media. A story from ''The Daily Bale'' went viral in August 2013, falsely reporting that The Globe pub in [[Leicester]] had refused to admit members of the armed forces, so as not to offend immigrants. People who had read the story threatened the pub with arson and its staff with murder. Bonehill-Paine stated in an interview that his intention was to create "a shocking campaign" that people would "share quickly on social media". Security expert [[Graham Cluley]] called the stunt "utterly irresponsible and frankly moronic".&lt;ref name="BBC150314"&gt;{{cite news|title='Moronic' Joshua Bonehill-Paine admits Leicester pub hoax|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-26375545|accessdate=31 December 2014|publisher= |work=[[BBC News]]|date=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2014, Bonehill-Paine was sentenced to 180 hours of unpaid work and two years supervision for malicious communications over this incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Moronic' hoaxer Joshua Bonehill-Paine spared jail|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-27161419|accessdate=6 December 2014|publisher= |work=[[BBC News]]|date=25 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, for breaching this community order, magistrates added another 10 hours of unpaid work to the sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.westerngazette.co.uk/10-hours-unpaid-work-Joshua-Bonehill-Paine/story-26286512-detail/story.html|title=Further 10 hours of unpaid work for Joshua Bonehill-Paine after breaching order|work=Western Gazette|date=5 April 2015|accessdate=17 December 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222130126/http://www.westerngazette.co.uk/10-hours-unpaid-work-Joshua-Bonehill-Paine/story-26286512-detail/story.html|archivedate=22 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, a hoax story about a six-year-old girl from [[Croydon]] being kidnapped by an Asian [[child grooming]] gang was shared on social media.&lt;ref name="Withnall2014" &gt;{{cite news|last=Withnall|first=Adam|title=Missing 'Amy Hamilton' poster circulating on social media revealed as racist right-wing propaganda hoax|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/missing-amy-hamilton-poster-circulating-on-social-media-revealed-as-racist-rightwing-propaganda-hoax-9104555.html|accessdate=31 October 2014|work=[[The Independent]]|date=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A September 2014 story made false claims about an Asian youth punching a baby and throwing it against a wall, which Bonehill-Paine later said had been written by an [[English Defence League]] member and published "without researching the actual article first".&lt;ref name="BBC150314"/&gt; The next month, Bonehill-Paine's blog spread a hoax that a [[Somalis in the United Kingdom|Somali immigrant]] with [[Ebola]] had gone missing in Leicester. A fake [[National Health Service|NHS]] poster making this claim was publicised by Bonehill-Paine's website, reportedly distributed by one of his supporters in Leicester, and seen in a medical centre in the city.&lt;ref name="Saul"&gt;{{cite news|title='Illegal immigrant with Ebola missing in Leicester' hoax poster appears in medical centre|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/illegal-immigrant-with-ebola-missing-in-leicester-hoax-poster-appears-in-medical-centre-9813059.html|first=Heather|last=Saul|accessdate=16 February 2015|work=The Independent|date=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014, he pleaded guilty to charges of malicious communications and harassment relating to articles on his ''Daily Bale'' blog falsely claiming that innocent people were paedophiles, drug dealers or religious zealots. During one hearing, he took issue with being called an "Internet troll" by the prosecutor, Dafydd Paxton.&lt;ref name="WG301014"&gt;{{cite news|title=Yeovil 'internet troll' Joshua Bonehill-Paine used website to spread 'web of lies' about other social media users|url=http://www.westerngazette.co.uk/Yeovil-internet-troll-Joshua-Bonehill-Paine-used/story-23778192-detail/story.html|accessdate=31 October 2014|work=[[Western Gazette]]|date=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sentencing was postponed until 12 January 2015 due to other "very serious" investigations involving him, including alleged [[Incitement to ethnic or racial hatred|incitement to racial hatred]] against a Member of Parliament,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sentencing of Yeovil internet troll Bonehill-Paine delayed as "more serious charges" to be considered|url=http://www.westerngazette.co.uk/Sentencing-Yeovil-internet-troll-Bonehill-Paine/story-24675300-detail/story.html|accessdate=27 November 2014|work=[[Western Gazette]]|date=25 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141130224535/http://www.westerngazette.co.uk/Sentencing-Yeovil-internet-troll-Bonehill-Paine/story-24675300-detail/story.html|archivedate=30 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later postponed again until 5 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.westerngazette.co.uk/Malicious-internet-troll-Joshua-Bonehill-Paine/story-25847483-detail/story.html | title="Malicious" internet troll Joshua Bonehill-Paine has sentencing adjourned so he can be charged with further offences | work=Western Gazette | date=13 January 2015 | accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hearing eventually took place on 9 February 2015, when he was given a three-month prison sentence suspended for 18 months, in addition to 80 hours' unpaid work and ten sessions of "education, training and employment". He was ordered to pay £85 costs and a victim surcharge of £80.&lt;ref name="WG090215"/&gt;

===Public order offences and tweets to Jack Monroe===
In February 2015, Bonehill-Paine was due to be charged in [[St Albans]] under s.38 of the [[Public Order Act 1986]],&lt;ref name=legislation&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/64/part/V | title=Public Order Act 1986 S.38| work=Legislation.gov.uk | date=2015 | accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the "contamination of goods", for publishing an article on his website suggesting that fruit and vegetables from [[Tesco]] were infected with Ebola.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Yeovil man Joshua Bonehill-Paine in court tomorrow accused of saying food at Tesco was infected with Ebola|url=http://www.westerngazette.co.uk/face-years-prison-Yeovil-man-Joshua-Bonehill/story-25956621-detail/story.html|accessdate=1 February 2015|work=Western Gazette|date=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The offence carries a maximum 10-year sentence.&lt;ref name=legislation/&gt; In October 2015, he was tried at [[Stevenage]] Magistrates' Court for "misusing a public computer network to propagate grossly offensive, indecent, obscene or menacing material" in two online articles, one being the Tesco Ebola hoax and the other encouraging the immediate killing of disabled babies for the purpose of [[eugenics]]. The district judge cleared him of both charges citing the freedom of speech guaranteed by the [[Human Rights Act 1998|Human Rights Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Corcoran|first1=Kieran|title=Internet troll in court for saying disabled people should be exterminated is cleared because punishing him would breach his right to freedom of speech|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3276364/Internet-troll-court-saying-disabled-people-exterminated-cleared-punishing-breach-right-freedom-speech.html|accessdate=23 November 2015|work=Daily Mail|date=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, Bonehill-Paine claimed to have been the man arrested and released on bail on suspicion of sending "hate" tweets to [[Jack Monroe]], a ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' columnist.&lt;ref name="Selby"&gt;Jenn Selby [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/jack-monroe-man-posing-as-ukip-candidate-arrested-for-abusing-gay-poverty-campaigner-10187482.html "Jack Monroe: Man posing as Ukip candidate arrested for abusing gay poverty campaigner"], ''The Independent'', 19 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Press Association [https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/apr/25/jack-monroe-twitter-abuse-man-re-bailed "Jack Monroe Twitter abuse: man re-bailed"], ''The Guardian'', 25 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The tweets were made by a hoax account purporting to be from a former UKIP candidate, and UKIP reported the account to the police.&lt;ref name="Selby"/&gt; In a statement on his website, Bonehill-Paine did not admit responsibility, but said that the tweets were "of a comical nature and [I] commend the level of free speech used".&lt;ref name="Selby"/&gt;

In May 2015, Bonehill-Paine pleaded not guilty to a charge of [[harassment]] after it was alleged that he had left a [[swastika]] in the home of a [[Hertfordshire]] woman with whom he had spent two nights, describing it as a gift that had been touched by [[Adolf Hitler]], before sending her a string of abusive messages and letters and asking her to become "his [[Eva Braun|Eva]]". The case was adjourned until 15 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.westerndailypress.co.uk/Joshua-Mark-John-Bonehill-Paine-22-allegedly-sent/story-26583217-detail/story.html | title=Joshua Mark John Bonehill-Paine, 22, allegedly sent a woman a swastika and asked her to be "his Eva" | publisher= |work=Western Daily Press | date=27 May 2015 | accessdate=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antisemitic protests=== 
In January 2015, Bonehill-Paine called for a "mass protest" in March that year against what he perceived as the "complete Jewification" of [[Stamford Hill]] in north London, an area with the UK's largest ultra-orthodox [[Haredi Judaism|Charedi]] population,&lt;ref name="Winny"/&gt; with particular focus on the volunteer [[neighbourhood watch]] group, [[Shomrim (neighborhood watch group)|Shomrim]], which he falsely asserts is an illegal religious police force.&lt;ref name="Booth020215"/&gt; The [[Community Security Trust]] (CST) was in talks with local police, and local Jewish leaders were described as calm about the threat. Dave Rich, a CST spokesman said that Bonehill-Paine had "a long record of racist provocation and antisemitic abuse but he doesn't have much record of being able to mobilise large numbers of people on the street".&lt;ref name="Booth020215"/&gt; Bonehill-Paine's protest was later cancelled due to lack of support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eastlondonlines.co.uk/2015/04/community-unites-against-neo-nazi-demonstration/ | title=Community unites against neo-Nazi demonstration | work=East London Lines | date=22 April 2015 | accessdate=29 June 2015 | author=Blood, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, Bonehill-Paine was arrested by police officers investigating allegations of [[Incitement to ethnic or racial hatred|inciting racial hatred]] relating to "two visual and written publications on the internet", and released on bail. He was arrested on suspicion of "racially aggravated harassment and malicious communications".&lt;ref name="Quine"/&gt;

In June 2015, Bonehill-Paine announced his intention to join a New Dawn Party demonstration&lt;ref name="Doherty"&gt;Rosa Doherty [http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/136653/alert-over-golders-green-rally "Alert over Golders Green rally"], ''Jewish Chronicle'', 21 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Golders Green]], an area of north London with a large Jewish minority, on Saturday 4 July 2015. Bonehell stated his intention to destroy Israeli flags by hand and tread upon them (believing that by not [[Flag desecration|burning the flags]] he could "avoid prosecution") and said he would be burning copies of the ''[[Talmud]]'', a Jewish holy book, in a "private ceremony".&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Dysch [http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/137868/extremists-plan-destroy-israeli-flags-and-burn-talmud-golders-green-rally "Extremists plan to destroy Israeli flags and burn Talmud at Golders Green rally"], ''The Jewish Chronicle'', 16 June 2015&lt;br&gt;- Tom Marshall [https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/organisers-of-antijewish-protest-announce-plans-to-dismember-and-destroy-israeli-flags-and-burn-jewish-holy-books-10327315.html "Organisers of anti-Jewish protest announce plans to 'dismember and destroy' Israeli flags and burn Jewish holy books"], ''London Evening Standard'', 17 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Posts to Bonehill-Paine's website featured [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz-Birkenau]] imagery and said that the demonstration would be an "absolute gas".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/138491/joshua-bonehill-paine-charged-over-antisemitic-blog-post-0|title=Joshua Bonehill-Paine charged over antisemitic blog post|author=|date=28 June 2015|work=The Jewish Chronicle|accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 June, he was arrested by the [[Metropolitan Police]] and charged with [[Incitement to ethnic or racial hatred|inciting racial hatred]] contrary to the [[Public Order Act 1986]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/white-rights-advocate-charged-with-inciting-racial-hatred-after-blogging-about-destroying-israeli-flags-and-burning-jewish-holy-books-10350379.html | title='White rights advocate' charged with inciting racial hatred after blogging about destroying Israeli flags and burning Jewish holy books | work=London Evening Standard | date=27 June 2015 | accessdate=27 June 2015 | author=Marshall, Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later, he was remanded in custody at [[Westminster Magistrates' Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dysch|first=Marcus|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/138529/bonehill-paine-remanded-racial-hatred-charge|title=Bonehill-Paine remanded on racial hatred charge|work=The Jewish Chronicle|date=29 June 2015|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was refused bail at a [[Southwark Crown Court]] hearing on 13 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Firsht|first=Naomi|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/139507/joshua-bonehill-paine-denied-bail-court-hearing|title=Joshua Bonehill-Paine denied bail at court hearing|work=The Jewish Chronicle|date=13 July 2015|accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;br&gt;- {{cite web|url=http://www.westerngazette.co.uk/Joshua-Bonehill-Paine-denied-bail-September-court/story-26897560-detail/story.html|title=Joshua Bonehill-Paine denied bail until September court date for allegedly inciting racial hatred|work=Western Gazette|date=14 July 2015|accessdate=16 July 2015|author=Goodchild, WG}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the next hearing on 21 September, he pleaded "absolutely not guilty" and was again remanded in custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.westerngazette.co.uk/Yeovil-s-Joshua-Bonehill-Paine-loudly-denies/story-27838575-detail/story.html|title=Yeovil's Joshua Bonehill-Paine 'loudly denies' inciting racial hatred before neo-Nazi rally|work=Western Gazette|date=21 September 2015|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial began at Southwark Crown Court on 14 December 2015. Mark Weekes for the prosecution described a poster on Bonehill-Paine's website which he invited visitors to print off to publicise the intended march on 4 July. The poster included an image of Auschwitz and a [[Stereotypes of Jews|stereotyped cartoon of a Jewish man]] being sprayed with weedkiller, under the slogan "Join us on July 4 for what promises to be an absolute gas!" with an [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] lightning bolt in the ‘O’ of Golders Green. Weekes said the poster "trivialises and mocks the death of millions of Jews during the Third Reich" and considered the use of Nazi imagery in reference to an area with a large Jewish population to be "incitement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/151292/joshua-bonehill-paine-stirred-hatred-against-jews-court-hears|title=Joshua Bonehill-Paine 'stirred up hatred against Jews', court hears|work=The Jewish Chronicle|date=14 December 2015|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 December, Bonehill-Paine was convicted of inciting racial hatred against Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/151381/joshua-bonehill-paine-convicted-inciting-racial-hatred-against-jews|title=Joshua Bonehill-Paine convicted of inciting racial hatred against Jews|work=The Jewish Chronicle|date=16 December 2015|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;br&gt;- {{cite news|last1=Al-Othman|first1=Hannah|title=Joshua Bonehill-Paine found guilty of inciting racial hatred against Jews|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/joshua-bonehillpaine-found-guilty-of-inciting-racial-hatred-against-jews-a3139051.html|accessdate=16 December 2015|work=Evening Standard|date=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sentenced to three years and four months imprisonment.&lt;ref name="TJC171215"/&gt;

Bonehill-Paine was held at [[HM Prison Manchester]] and [[HM Prison Wandsworth]]. In January 2016, he was investigated by the Prison Service for letters to fans, inside envelopes with drawings of Hitler, the [[September 11 attacks]] and [[Harold Shipman]]. In the letters, he mocked taxpayers for the £120,000 costs of holding him in prison and spoke of plans to stand for election as a member of parliament in [[Bradford]] when eligible five years after his release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fanatic Joshua Bonehill-Paine investigated over letters sent from cell covered in Hitler doodles|url=http://www.westerndailypress.co.uk/Fanatic-Joshua-Bonehill-Paine-investigated/story-28568218-detail/story.html|accessdate=4 May 2016|work=Western Daily Press|date=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Appeal Court]] upheld the length of Bonehill-Paine's sentence in May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.westerndailypress.co.uk/Joshua-Bonehill-Paine-deserved-sentence-posting/story-29292699-detail/story.html|title=Joshua Bonehill-Paine 'deserved sentence' after posting Nazi death camp flyer in build-up to rally|work=Western Daily Press|agency=Western Gazette|date=19 May 2016|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;br&gt;- {{cite news|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/158375/extremist-loses-appeal-against-jail-sentence|title=Extremist loses appeal against jail sentence|work=The Jewish Chronicle|date=19 May 2016|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also spoke of a desire to run for MP of [[Yeovil (UK Parliament constituency)|Yeovil]], his home constituency, in order to build a "rural utopia" that would "ignite the fire" to spread throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Joshua Bonehill-Paine 'to stand as Yeovil's MP' on release from prison|url=http://www.somersetlive.co.uk/joshua-bonehill-paine-stand-yeovil-s-mp-release/story-29342379-detail/story.html|accessdate=19 July 2016|work=Somerset Live|date=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harassment of Luciana Berger===
In October 2014, Bonehill-Paine was investigated by police over antisemitic comments about the Labour MP [[Luciana Berger]] published on his website, after Garron Helm, a member of [[National Action (UK)|National Action]], was imprisoned for sending antisemitic messages to her.&lt;ref name="Dysch"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dysch|first1=Marcus|title=Neo-Nazi gave out internet abuse tips in campaign against Luciana Berger|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/124917/neo-nazi-gave-out-internet-abuse-tips-campaign-against-luciana-berger|accessdate=31 October 2014|work=[[The Jewish Chronicle]]|date=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 February 2015, it was reported that Bonehill-Paine had been arrested on suspicion of having sent antisemitic tweets to Berger.&lt;ref name="Quine"&gt;Oscar Quine [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/organiser-of-antijewish-rally-arrested-over-antisemitic-tweets-to-labour-mp-10047746.html "Organiser of anti-Jewish rally arrested over anti-Semitic tweets to Labour MP"], ''The Independent'', 15 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 June 2016, he was charged with the racially or religiously aggravated harassment of  Berger between October 2014 and February 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Oliver|first=Charlotte|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/159618/extremist-joshua-bonehill-paine-charged-harassing-luciana-berger |title=Extremist Joshua Bonehill-Paine charged with harassing Luciana Berger|work=The Jewish Chronicle|date=22 June 2016|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a hearing at the [[Old Bailey]] on 19 July 2016, with Bonehill-Paine participating via a video link, he was sent for trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/160456/joshua-bonehill-payne-stand-trial-over-abusive-posts-attacking-luciana-berger|title=Joshua Bonehill-Payne to stand trial over abusive posts attacking Luciana Berger|work=The Jewish Chronicle|date=19 July 2016|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial began on 5 December 2016. The court was told that Bonehill-Paine had posted five "hateful and insulting" articles about the woman he blamed for the jailing of a far-right extremist he regarded as a comrade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/dec/05/labour-mp-luciana-berger-subject-of-hateful-blogposts-court-told|title=Labour MP Luciana Berger subject of hateful blogposts, court told|work=The Guardian|agency=Press Association|date=5 December 2016|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His defence counsel said Bonehill-Paine would not be giving evidence at the trial, but asserted that the defendant in posting his "pathetic, puerile rubbish" was, however, living in a country "where everyone is entitled to a voice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kirk|first=Tritan|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/pathetic-extremist-accused-of-abusing-mp-luciana-berger-was-exercising-right-to-free-speech-a3413811.html|title='Pathetic' extremist accused of abusing MP Luciana Berger was 'exercising right to free speech'|work=London Evening Standard|date=6 December 2016|accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 December 2016, Bonehill-Paine was convicted of [[Harassment, alarm or distress|racially-aggravated harassment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-38242100|title=Man guilty of harassing Jewish Labour MP Luciana Berger|publisher= |work=BBC News|date=7 December 2016|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, he was imprisoned for two years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-38249351|title=Man jailed for harassing Labour MP Luciana Berger|publisher= |work=BBC News|date=8 December 2016|accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; this new custodial term to be added to the existing sentence. A [[Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014|criminal behaviour order]] was imposed to restrict his internet use after his eventual release, including the barring of any attempt to contact Berger and other listed individuals, and the police were authorised to monitor his online activities for five years.&lt;ref name="Simpson"/&gt;

'''Kentucky Shakespeare Festival''' is a non-profit, professional theatre company in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] that produces and performs the works of [[William Shakespeare]].  The main productions offered are the annual summer series of plays presented free to the public at the [[C. Douglass Ramey Amphitheater]] in the city's [[Central Park, Louisville|Central Park]].  This series, commonly called [[Shakespeare in the Park festivals |"Shakespeare in Central Park"]], sprung from an initial production in the park by The Carriage House Players in the summer of 1960.  They also perform shows in other venues, as well as conduct educational programs related to acting and other theater-related skills.

== Educational programming ==

=== Camp Shakespeare ===

Programs consist of theatre instruction combined with competitions, games, and activities designed to engage the campers. Summers often include field trips and will culminate in an invited performance, or "Share Day", for family and friends showcasing what the campers have been working on during their session.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17111">'''Kernewek Kemmyn''' (Common Cornish or "KK") is a variety of the [[Cornish language#Revival|revived]] [[Cornish language]].

Kernewek Kemmyn was developed, mainly by [[Ken George]], from [[Unified Cornish]] in 1986. It takes much of its inspiration from medieval sources, particularly Cornish passion plays, as well as [[Breton language|Breton]] and to a lesser extent [[Welsh language|Welsh]]. It was subsequently adopted by the Cornish Language Board as their preferred system. It retained a Middle Cornish base but made the spelling more systematic by applying phonemic orthographic theory, and for the first time set out clear rules relating spelling to pronunciation. Before the [[Standard Written Form]] was introduced in 2008, users of KK{{Who|date=September 2011}} claimed that the orthography had been taken up enthusiastically by the majority of Cornish speakers and learners, and advocates{{Who|date=September 2011}} of this orthography claimed that it was especially welcomed by teachers. This assuption was comfirmed in 2008, when a survey indicated that KK users made up more than half of all Cornish speakers &lt;ref&gt;Cornish Language Partnership (2008)&lt;cite&gt;"A Report on The Cornish Language Survey"  Available: www.magakernow.org.uk .&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; After KK's introduction, many Cornish speakers chose to continue using Unified Cornish, and many moved to [[Modern Cornish|Revived Late Cornish]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

The orthography has drawn heavy criticism from some areas. Since the publication of the ''Gerlyver Kernewek Kemmyn'' (dictionary), several writers have condemned the new orthography (Penglase 1994; Williams 1996; Mills 1999). Some supporters of KK claim that its phonetic spelling makes it easier to teach, and that its reconstructed phonology is grounded in the historic corpus of medieval Cornish literature.

Notably several writers have criticised George's reconstructed phonology, claiming it to be academically unsound. In 1994, Charles Penglase&lt;ref&gt;Charles Penglase, &lt;cite&gt;"Authenticity in the Revival of Cornish"&lt;/cite&gt;, in ''Cornish Studies''. Second series: Two. Exeter: University of Exeter Press. Pp. 96-107. {{ISBN|0-85989-454-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; berated the lack of authenticity in KK resulting out of George's purely conjectural reconstruction of Middle Cornish phonology. In 1995, [[Nicholas Williams]]&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Williams, &lt;cite&gt;Cornish Today: an examination of the revived language&lt;/cite&gt;. First and second editions: Sutton Coldfield: Kernewek dre Lyther, 1995; Third edition: Westport: Evertype, 2006. {{ISBN|978-1-904808-07-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; listed some 25 ways in which he believes the phonology and spelling of KK to be erroneous. In 1999, Jon Mills&lt;ref&gt;Jon Mills, &lt;cite&gt;[https://archive.org/details/ReconstructivePhonologyAndContrastiveLexicologyProblemsWithTheGerlyver "Reconstructive Phonology and Contrastive Lexicography: Problems with the Gerlyver Kernewek Kemmyn"]&lt;/cite&gt;, in ''Cornish Studies''. Second series: Seven. Exeter: University of Exeter Press. Pp. 193-218. {{ISBN|0-85989-644-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives examples of numerous inaccuracies in George's data and shows how the English translation equivalents and neologisms given in the ''Gerlyver Kernewek Kemmyn'' entail a contrastive lexicology that is at odds with traditional practice as attested in the historical corpus of Cornish.

Another issue, which has caused controversy is that of Cornish placenames. In many instances, there are multiple, conflicting etymologies and possible meanings, but KK has tended to respell these according to one theory or another.   This respelling not only can obscure an alternative origin or meaning, but is not always in line with the practice of other forms of revived Cornish.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Mills, &lt;cite&gt;[https://archive.org/details/ReconstructivePhonologyAndContrastiveLexicologyProblemsWithTheGerlyver "Reconstructive Phonology and Contrastive Lexicography: Problems with the Gerlyver Kernewek Kemmyn"]&lt;/cite&gt; in Cornish Studies. Second series: Seven. Exeter: University of Exeter Press. Pp. 193-218. {{ISBN|0-85989-644-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While its users claim it to be the largest, and so most successful, variety of Cornish, a survey in 2008 &lt;ref&gt;Cornish Language Partnership(2008) &lt;cite&gt;"A Report on The Cornish Language Survey" Available: www.magakernow.org.uk&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; indicated that KK users only make up roughly half of all Cornish speakers. However 73.9% of "competent and frequent" writers of Cornish used KK, and 69.6% of them preferred to use KK. 70.4% of "competent and frequent" readers were found to prefer to read KK. Despite this, it has drawn heavy criticism from some areas, particularly its rival forms, [[Unified Cornish]] (''Unyes'') and [[Modern Cornish]], although the survey found that "competent and frequent" writers of these forms of Cornish made up only 18.3% and 10.4% respectively.

In 1987 [[Kesva an Taves Kernewek]] (''Cornish Language Board'') voted to adopt the Kernewek Kemmyn form of Cornish as its standard.

While the various varieties of revived Cornish have had a rocky relationship with one another, this has had the positive effect of creating a publishing and writing boom in Cornish. All of them have been used in constructing the Cornish language Wikipedia, and also in [[Gorseth Kernow]], the Cornish ''[[Gorsedd]]''.

==Phonetics and phonology==
The pronunciation of traditional Cornish is a matter of conjecture, but users of Revived Middle Cornish are more or less agreed about the phonology they use.

Notes:&lt;br/&gt;
1. A vowel is considered short when it comes before double consonants (e.g. ⟨nn⟩, ⟨mm⟩, and so on), or before any two consonants.&lt;br/&gt;
2. Some vowels have a tendency to be reduced to schwas {{IPA|[ə]}} in unstressed syllables

The '''Leonids''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|iː|ən|ɪ|d|z}} {{respell|LEE|ə-nidz}}) are a prolific [[meteor shower]] associated with the [[comet]] [[55P/Tempel–Tuttle|Tempel–Tuttle]]. The Leonids get their name from the location of their [[Radiant (meteor shower)|radiant]] in the [[constellation]] [[Leo (constellation)|Leo]]: the [[meteor]]s appear to radiate from that point in the [[sky]]. Their proper [[Greek language|Greek]] name should be Leon''t''ids (Λεοντίδαι, ''Leontídai''), but the word was initially constructed as a Greek/[[Latin]] [[Hybrid word|hybrid]]{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} and it has been used since. They peak in the month of November.

[[Earth]] moves through the meteoroid stream of particles left from the passages of a [[comet]]. The stream comprises solid particles, known as [[meteoroid]]s, ejected by the comet as its frozen gases [[evaporate]] under the heat of the [[Sun]] when it is close enough – typically closer than Jupiter's orbit. The Leonids are a fast moving stream which encounter the path of Earth and impact at 72&amp;nbsp;km/s.&lt;ref name=space021112&gt;[http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/astronomy/leonids_science_021112.html Space.com] The Power of a Shooting Star&lt;/ref&gt; Larger Leonids which are about 10&amp;nbsp;mm across have a mass of half a gram and are known for generating bright ([[apparent magnitude]] −1.5) meteors.&lt;ref name=jenniskens2006/&gt; An annual Leonid shower may deposit 12 or 13 tons of particles across the entire planet.

The meteoroids left by the comet are organized in trails in orbits similar to though different from that of the comet. They are differentially disturbed by the planets, in particular [[Jupiter]]&lt;ref name="Asher&amp;McNaught99"&gt;{{Citation | last = McNaught | first = Robert H. | author-link = Robert H.

Old trails are spatially not dense and compose the meteor shower with a few meteors per minute. In the case of the Leonids, that tends to peak around November 18, but some are spread through several days on either side and the specific peak changes every year. Conversely, young trails are spatially very dense and the cause of meteor outbursts when the Earth enters one. Meteor storms (large outbursts) exceed 1000 meteors per hour, to be compared to the sporadic background (5 to 8 meteors per hour) and the shower background (several per hour).

The Leonids are famous because their meteor showers, or storms, can be among the most spectacular. Because of the storm of 1833 and the recent developments in scientific thought of the time (see for example the identification of [[Halley's Comet]]) the Leonids have had a major effect on the development of the scientific study of meteors, which had previously been thought to be atmospheric phenomena. Though it has been suggested the meteor shower-storm has been noted in ancient times&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[Denison Olmsted]] explained the event most accurately.

Another strong appearance of the Leonids in 1868 reached an intensity of 1000 per hour in dark skies. It was in 1866–67 that information on Comet Tempel-Tuttle was gathered pointing it out as the source of the meteor shower.&lt;ref name="Kronk"/&gt; When the storms failed to return in 1899, it was generally thought that the dust had moved on and storms were a thing of the past.

This showed that the meteoroids are mostly behind and outside the path of the comet, but paths of the Earth through the cloud of particles resulting in powerful storms were very near paths of nearly no activity. But overall the 1998 Leonids were in a favorable position so interest was rising.

Leading up to the 1998 return, an airborne observing campaign was organized to mobilize modern observing techniques by [[Peter Jenniskens]] at NASA Ames Research Center.&lt;ref name="Meteor"/&gt; There were also efforts to observe impacts of meteoroids, as an example of [[transient lunar phenomenon]], on the Moon in 1999. A particular reason to observe the Moon is that our vantage from a location on Earth sees only meteors coming into the atmosphere relatively close to us while impacts on the Moon would be visible from across the Moon in a single view.&lt;ref&gt;[https://science.nasa.gov/newhome/headlines/ast22nov99_1.htm A Leonid on the Moon?] by Dr. Tony Phillips&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sodium tail of the Moon]] tripled just after the 1998 Leonid shower which was composed of larger meteoroids (which in the case of the Earth was witnessed as fireballs.)&lt;ref name="LunLeo"&gt;{{Cite web | last = McNaught | first = Robert H. | authorlink = Robert H.

Whereas previously it was hazardous to guess if there would be a storm or little activity, the predictions of Asher and McNaught timed bursts in activity down to ten minutes by narrowing down the clouds of particles to individual streams from each passage of the comet, and their trajectories amended by subsequent passage near planets. However, whether a specific meteoroid trail will be primarily composed of small or large particles, and thus the relative brightness of the meteors, was not understood. But McNaught did extend the work to examine the placement of the Moon with trails and saw a large chance of a storm impacting in 1999 from a trail while there were less direct impacts from trails in 2000 and 2001 (successive contact with trails through 2006 showed no hits.)&lt;ref name="LunLeo"/&gt;

Viewing campaigns resulted in spectacular footage from the 1999, 2001 and 2002, storms producing up to 3,000 Leonid meteors per hour.&lt;ref name="Meteor"/&gt; Predictions for the Moon's Leonid impacts also noted that in 2000 the side of the Moon facing the stream was away from the Earth but that impacts should be in number enough to raise a cloud of particles kicked off the Moon by impacts would cause a detectable increase in the [[sodium tail of the Moon]].&lt;ref name="LunLeo"/&gt; Research using the explanation of meteor trails/streams have explained the storms of the past. The 1833 storm was not due to the recent passage of the comet, but from a direct impact with the previous 1800 dust trail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arm.ac.uk/leonid/dust1833.html Armagh Observatory] Leonid dust trail positions in 1833.&lt;/ref&gt; The meteoroids from the 1733 passage of Comet Tempel-Tuttle resulted in the 1866 storm&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arm.ac.uk/leonid/dust1866.html Leonid dust trail positions in 1866] Armagh Observatory&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1966 storm was from the 1899 passage of the comet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arm.ac.uk/leonid/dust1966.html Armagh Observatory] Leonid dust trail positions in 1966&lt;/ref&gt; The double spikes in Leonid activity in 2001 and in 2002 were due to the passage of the comet's dust ejected in 1767 and 1866.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meteorobs.org/lunar.html Meteor Orbs.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928082108/http://www.meteorobs.org/lunar.html |date=2006-09-28 }} Predictions &amp; Observations of Lunar Meteor impacts&lt;/ref&gt; This ground breaking work was soon applied to other meteor showers – for example the 2004 [[June Bootids]].

Recent work tries to take into account the roles of differences in parent bodies and the specifics of their orbits, ejection velocities off the solid mass of the core of a comet, [[radiation pressure]] from the sun, the [[Poynting–Robertson effect]], and the [[Yarkovsky effect]] on the particles of different sizes and rates of rotation to explain differences between meteor showers in terms of being predominantly fireballs or small meteors.&lt;ref name="BrownThesis"/&gt;

Two appearances of the Leonids frame the story of the novel [[Blood Meridian]] by [[Cormac McCarthy]].

The 1833 shower is referenced in the fourth section of [[William Faulkner]]'s short story "The Bear," as published in his novel [[Go Down, Moses (book)|Go Down, Moses]]. As Ike reads the entries chronicling the slaves owned by his family, the recording for Tomy lists her death as June 1833, "Yr stars fell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/21562002|title=Go down, Moses|last=1897–1962.|first=Faulkner, William,|date=1990|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=0679732179|edition=1st Vintage international|location=New York|oclc=21562002}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

In ''[[Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire]]'', the Leonid is referenced as the Litleonids meteor shower (named after the Pokémon species [[Litleo]]). This has a big impact in an event in its post game named "The Delta Episode" in which one of the meteors contain [[Deoxys]].

A '''medical data breach''' is a [[data breach]] of health information, and could include either the personal health information of any individual's [[electronic health record]] or [[medical billing]] information from their [[health insurance]].

==Black market for health data==
In February 2015 an [[NPR]] report claimed that [[organized crime]] networks had ways of selling health data in the [[black market]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2015/02/13/385901377/the-black-market-for-stolen-health-care-data |title=The Black Market For Stolen Health Care Data : All Tech Considered : NPR |first=Aarti |last=Shahani |work=npr.org |date=13 February 2015 |accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 a [[Beazley Group]] staffperson estimated that medical records could sell on the black market for {{US$|40}}-50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/06/business/experts-suspect-lax-security-left-anthem-vulnerable-to-hackers.html?_r=0 |title=Anthem Hacking Points to Security Vulnerability of Health Care Industry |first=Reed |last=Abelson |first2=Matthew |last2=Goldstein |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=5 February 2015 |publisher=[[New York Times Company|NYTC]] |location=[[New York, NY|New York]] |issn=0362-4331 |accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crime is the primary cause of medical data breaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://royaljay.com/security/healthcare-data-breach/ |title=Healthcare data breaches present a $6 billion threat |first=Robbie |last=Richards |work=royaljay.com |date=16 November 2015 |accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==How data is lost==
Theft, [[data loss]], hacking, and unauthorized account access are ways in which medical data breaches happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/08/19/health-care-data-breaches-have-hit-30m-patients-and-counting/ |title=Health care data breaches have hit 30M patients and counting |first=Jason |last=Millman |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=19 August 2014 |publisher=[[Washington Post Company|WPC]] |location=[[Washington, DC|Washington DC]] |issn=0190-8286 |accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Karte Tragödie von Nasino.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Map of modern [[Tomsk Oblast]] with Nazino labelled]]
The '''Nazino affair''' ({{lang-ru|Назинская трагедия|Nazinskaya Tragediya}}) was the [[mass deportation]] of 6,000 people to Nazino Island in the [[Soviet Union]] in May 1933. The deportees, mostly [[political prisoners]] and [[petty criminal]]s, were forcibly sent to the small, isolated island in [[West Siberian Krai|Western Siberia]], located {{convert|540|km|sp=us}} northwest of [[Tomsk, Russia|Tomsk]], to construct a "[[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|special settlement]]". They were abandoned with only [[flour]] for food, and little in the way of tools, clothing, or shelter, and those who attempted to leave were killed by armed guards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Werth|2007|pp=xviii, 181}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="STimes"&gt;{{cite news|last =Franchetti|first =Mark|title =The cannibal hell of Stalin’s prison island|work =[[The Sunday Times]]|date =April 8, 2007|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article1622689.ece|accessdate =September 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conditions of the island led to widespread [[disease]], [[abuse of power]], [[violence]], and [[cannibalism]]. Within thirteen weeks, over 4,000 of the deportees related to Nazino Island had died or disappeared, and a majority of the survivors were in ill health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Werth|2007|pp=xviii, 181}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="STimes"&gt;{{cite news|last =Franchetti|first =Mark|title =The cannibal hell of Stalin’s prison island|work =[[The Sunday Times]]|date =April 8, 2007|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article1622689.ece|accessdate =September 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nazino affair was virtually unknown until 1988, when an investigation by [[Memorial (society)|Memorial]] began during the ''[[glasnost]]'' reforms in the Soviet Union. The events were popularized in 2002 when reports of a September 1933 special commission by the Communist Party of Western Siberia were published by Memorial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Werth|2007|pp=xvii, 195}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Memorial|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
{{external media | width = 210px | align = right | headerimage=[[File:Joseph Stalin (Dzhugashvili).jpg|210px]] | video1 = [http://rutube.ru/tracks/3151253.html ''Near the island of death''], (in Russian, 29 minutes)&lt;ref name="xvid"&gt;{{cite web | title =Near the island of death | work = | publisher =RuTube | date = April 2010 | url =http://rutube.ru/tracks/3151253.html | accessdate =February 11, 2013 }} by Aleksandr Krivko, Yevgenii Nikonorov, and others&lt;/ref&gt; }}
In February 1933, [[Genrikh Yagoda]], head of the [[OGPU]] [[secret police]], and [[Matvei Berman]], head of the [[GULAG]] labor camp system, proposed a self-described "grandiose plan" to [[Joseph Stalin]], the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] of the [[Soviet Union]], to resettle up to 2,000,000 people to [[Siberia]] and [[Kazakhstan]] in "[[special settlement (Soviet)|special settlement]]s." The deportees, or "settlers," were to bring over a million [[hectares]] of virgin land in the sparsely populated regions into production, and become self-sufficient within two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kiernan|2007}} Ch. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Yagoda and Berman's plan was based on the experience of deporting 2,000,000 [[kulak]]s (wealthier land owning [[peasant]]s) and other agricultural workers to the same areas that had occurred in the previous three years as part of the [[Dekulakization]] policy. However, unlike the previous plan, resources available to support the new plan were severely limited by the [[Soviet famine of 1932–1933|ongoing famine]] in the Soviet Union. Despite this, the new plan was approved by the Soviet Council of People's Commissars of the USSR on 11 March 1933. Shortly after the plan's approval, the number of prospective deportees was reduced to 1,000,000 deportees.

===Deportees===
The original plan targeted several types of kulaks, peasants, "[[Urban area|urban]] elements," people living in the agricultural areas of Soviet Union's western territories such as the [[Ukrainian SSR]], and the [[Lower Volga]], [[North Caucasus]] and [[Black Earth Region]] in the [[Russian SFSR]]. Instead, many of the deportees were people from [[Moscow]] and [[Leningrad]] who had been unable to obtain an [[Internal passport#Soviet Union|internal passport]]. The [[Passport system of the Soviet Union#History|passportization campaign]] in the Soviet Union began with a decision by the [[Politburo]] on December 27, 1932 to issue internal passports to all residents of major cities, and one of their objectives was to "cleanse Moscow, Leningrad and the other great urban centers of the USSR of superfluous elements not connected with production or administrative work, as well as kulaks, criminals, and other antisocial and socially dangerous elements."&lt;ref&gt;Protocol of the Politburo meeting of November 15, 1932, ''Istochnik'' no. 6 (1997), p. 104; quoted in {{Harvnb|Werth|2007}} p.15&lt;/ref&gt;

Deportees were primarily "Déclassé and socially harmful elements", meaning former [[merchants]] and traders, peasants who had fled [[Soviet famine of 1932–33|the famine in the countryside]], [[petty criminal|petty criminals]], or anybody who did not fit into the idealized [[communist]] class structure. Their backgrounds meant they were not issued passports, and they could be arrested and deported from the cities after a summary administrative procedure. Most of the arrestees were deported within two days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Werth|2007}} pp. 15-22&lt;/ref&gt; Between March and July 1933, 85,937 people living in Moscow were arrested and deported because they lacked passports, while 4,776 people living in Leningrad were also deported. Those arrested in connection with the cleansing of Moscow prior to the May 1, 1933 [[International Workers' Day|May Day]] holiday were assigned to the transit camp in the city of [[Tomsk]].

==Transportation==
According to the plan of Yagoda and Berman, the deportees would pass through transit camps at Tomsk, [[Omsk]], and [[Achinsk]]. The largest camp was at Tomsk, which had to be rebuilt from scratch, starting in April to hold 15,000 deportees. 25,000 deportees arrived in April even though the camp was not scheduled to be completed until May 1. River transport to the final labor camps was closed until the start of May until ice on the Ob and [[Tom River]]s cleared. Most of the first arrivals were kulaks and other agricultural workers, and people from southern Russian cities. The arrival of so many deportees panicked Tomsk authorities, who viewed them as "starving and contagious."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Werth|2007}} pp. 86-92&lt;/ref&gt;

A report by Vassily Arsenievich Velichko, the local Communist Party head in Narymsky District of the [[West Siberian Krai]], gave 22 examples of people who had been deported:
{{quote|It is hard to tell how many, even who (died), because declared documents had been confiscated at the time of arrest, or by police organs at the detention centers, or on the train by criminals who used them to smoke. However, some of them brought their documents with them: party and party candidate cards, [[Komsomol]] cards, passports, certificates from the factories, factory passes, etc ...
# Novozhilov, Vl., from Moscow. Kompressor works. Driver. Awarded bonuses three times. Wife and child in Moscow. After work he was getting ready to go to the cinema with his wife. While she was getting dressed, he stepped out to smoke a cigarette and was apprehended.
# Guseva, an old woman. She lives in [[Murom]]. Her husband is an old communist, chief officer of the Murom railway station, who has worked there twenty-three years. Her son works there as an apprentice engine driver. Guseva came to Moscow to buy a suit for her husband and some white bread. Her documents did not help her....&lt;ref&gt;quoted in {{Harvnb|Khlevniuk|2004|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A rail convoy holding déclassé deportees left Moscow on April 30, and a similar convoy left Leningrad on April 29, with both arriving on May 10. The daily food ration during the trip was 300 grams of bread per person. Criminal groups among the deportees beat the other deportees and stole their food and clothing. The authorities in Tomsk were unfamiliar with urban deportees, and expected trouble from them, so decided to send them to the most isolated work sites. Two nights after their arrival in Tomsk a disturbance broke out, as they demanded drinking water, which was put down by mounted troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Werth|2007}} pp. 102-120&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the urban deportees were later sent to Nazino Island ({{lang-ru|остров Назино}}), a [[river island]] on the [[Ob River]] located {{convert|800|km|sp=us}} north of Tomsk, in a particularly empty part of Western Siberia inhabited by only a small number of indigenous [[Ostyak]] people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Werth|2007}} pp. 15-22&lt;/ref&gt; Four [[river barges]], which were designed to haul [[timber]], were filled with about 5,000 deportees on May 14 1933. About a third of the deportees were criminals who were sent in order to "decongest the prisons." About half were déclassé people from Moscow and Leningrad. The authorities who were to be in charge of the labor camps were first informed that they would be sent on May 5. These authorities had never worked with urban deportees and had no resources or supplies to support them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Werth|2007}} pp. 121-125&lt;/ref&gt; The deportees were kept below decks on the barges and apparently fed a daily ration of 200 grams of [[bread]] per person. Twenty tons of [[flour]] - about four [[kilos]] per person - were also transported, but the barges contained no other food, [[cooking utensils]], or tools. All supervisory personnel, two commanders and fifty guards, were newly recruited and had no shoes or uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Werth|2007}} pp. 121-129&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nazino Island==
The barges unloaded their passengers during the afternoon of May 18, on Nazino Island, a swampy island about 3&amp;nbsp;km long and 600 meters wide. There was no roster of the disembarking deportees, but on arrival 322 women and 4,556 men were counted, plus 27 bodies of those who died during the trip from Tomsk. Over a third of the deportees were too weak to stand on arrival. About 1,200 additional deportees arrived on May 27.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Werth|2007}} pp. 127-130, 146&lt;/ref&gt; A fight broke out and guards fired on the deportees as the twenty tons of flour were deposited on the island and distribution began. The flour was moved to the shore opposite the island and distribution on the island was tried again the next morning, with another fight and more firing resulting. Afterward, all flour was distributed via "brigadiers" who collected flour for their brigade of about 150 people. The brigadiers were often criminals who abused their positions. There were no ovens to bake bread, so the deportees ate the flour mixed with river water, which led to [[dysentery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Werth|2007}} pp. 130-137&lt;/ref&gt; Some deportees made primitive rafts to try to escape, but most of the rafts collapsed and hundreds of [[corpses]] washed up on the shore below the island. Guards hunted and killed other escapees, as if they were hunting animals for sport. Because of the lack of any transportation to the rest of the country except upstream to Tomsk, and the harshness of life in the [[taiga]], any other escapees who made it across the river and evaded the guards were ultimately presumed dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Werth|2007}} pp. 130-137&lt;/ref&gt; 

Shortly after the deportees had already arrived on Nazino Island, the Yagoda and Berman plan was rejected by Stalin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Werth|2007}} pp. 1-12&lt;/ref&gt;

Society on the island quickly broke down and devolved into chaos: the majority of the population were city dwellers, most of whom knew nothing about basic agricultural practices such as [[Clearing (geography)|clearing]] and [[Cultivation of the land|cultivation]] that would make the island properly habitable. The sparsity of resources led to gangs forming, who began using [[violence]] to dominate the island. People were frequently [[murdered]] in fights over food and money, and the bodies of those in possession of anything of value such as gold [[Tooth Filling|tooth fillings]] and [[Tooth crown|crowns]] were often looted. The guards established their own reign of terror, [[extortion|extorting]] settlers and [[execution|executing]] people for minor offences despite being apathetic towards the gangs. The guards were also assigned to keep the settlers in, and killed people who attempted to escape. Even the [[Physician|doctors]] sent to monitor the island's population, who were supposed to have protection, began to fear for their lives. The lack of proper food and the frequency of death by late May led to [[cannibalism]] becoming widespread, to the point that settlers eventually began murdering individuals for the sole purpose of consuming them. On May 21, the three health officers counted 70 new deaths, with signs of cannibalism observed in five cases. Over the next month, guards arrested about 50 people for cannibalism. 

===Aftermath===
The dire situation on Nazino Island was finally ended by Soviet authorities in early June, when the settlement was dissolved and the surviving 2,856 deportees were transferred to smaller settlements upstream the Nazina River, leaving just 157 deportees who could not be moved from the island for health reasons. Despite the settlement being disestablished, several hundred more of the deportees died during the transfer. People who survived the transfer found themselves with few tools, little food, and there was an outbreak of [[typhus]]. Most deportees refused to work in the new settlements due to their previous treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Werth|2007}} pp. 138-153&lt;/ref&gt;

In a period of thirteen weeks, of the roughly 6,000 deportee settlers intended for Nazino Island, between 1,500 to 2,000 had died due to [[starvation]], exposure, disease, murder, or [[accidental death]]. Another 2,000 settlers had disappeared and their whereabouts untraceable, so they were presumed dead. The death tolls include people who either died or disappeared during their transportation to or from the island.

In early July, new settlements were constructed by the authorities using non-deportee labor, but only 250 Nazino Island settlers were transferred to these. Instead 4,200 new deportees who arrived from Tomsk were housed in these settlements. A report on the events which was sent to Stalin by Velichko was distributed by [[Lazar Kaganovich]] to members of the Politburo, and was preserved in an archive in [[Novosibirsk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Khlevniuk|2004|pp=64–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stated that 6,114 "outdated elements" (also known as "déclassé and socially harmful elements" or classless people) arrived on the island in May 1933, and at least 27 people died during the river transport. There was no shelter on the island, it snowed the first night, and no food was distributed for four days. On the first day 295 people were buried.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Courtois|1999|pp=154–155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Velichko’s letter to Stalin on August 20 claimed only 2,200 people survived out of about 6,700 deportees that he calculated had arrived from Tomsk. Velichko’s letter resulted in a commission by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] to study the affair. In October, the commission estimated that of the roughly 2,000 survivors from Nazino Island, half were ill and bedridden, and that only about 200 to 300 were physically capable of working.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Werth|2007}} pp. 154-170&lt;/ref&gt; There were attempts by local officials and guards at the island to dispute Velichko's report but were instead reprimanded, receiving prison sentences ranging between 12 months to 3 years. 

The events that occurred at Nazino Island highlighted issues with Soviet colonization projects, and the Soviet leadership began to doubt their quality and efficiency. In 1933 alone, there were 367,457 known untraceable "special resettlers", of which 151,601 were dismissed and 215,856 simply disappeared from their settlements. Nazino Island directly led to the end of large scale settlement plans in the Soviet Union, and to the end of using deportees from "urban déclassé elements" and criminal backgrounds for future settlement plans.

==Rediscovery==
After the initial investigations in late 1933, the events at Nazino Island were largely forgotten as they were not made public, and only a small number of survivors, government officials, and eyewitnesses knew of their occurrence.

In 1988, at the time of the ''[[glasnost]]'' policy in the Soviet Union, details of the Nazino affair first became available to the general public through the efforts of the [[human rights]] group [[Memorial (society)|Memorial]].
&lt;ref name="Mem"&gt;{{cite web
|last =Barysheva|first =A.I.|title =The Island of Death|publisher =Memorial|date =November 18, 1988
|url =http://www.memorial.krsk.ru/eng/Dokument/Memuar/Barysheva.htm|accessdate = September 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, an eyewitness reported to Memorial:&lt;ref&gt;translated in {{Harvnb|Werth|2007|p=xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|They were trying to escape. They asked us "Where's the railway?" We'd never seen a railway. They asked "Where's Moscow? Leningrad?" They were asking the wrong people: we'd never heard of those places. We're [[Ostyak]]s. People were running away starving. They were given a handful of flour. They mixed it with water and drank it and then they immediately got diarrhea. The things we saw! People were dying everywhere; they were killing each other.... On the island there was a guard named Kostia Venikov, a young fellow. He fall in love with a girl who had been sent there and was courting her. He protected her. One day he had to be away for a while, and he told one of his comrades, "Take care of her," but with all the people there the comrade couldn't do much really.... People caught the girl, tied her to a poplar tree, cut off her breasts, her muscles, everything they could eat, everything, everything.... They were hungry, they had to eat. When Kostia came back, she was still alive. He tried to save her, but she had lost too much blood.}}

The French historian [[Nicolas Werth]], who earlier co-authored ''[[The Black Book of Communism]]'', published the book ''Cannibal Island'' about the affair in 2006. It was translated into English in 2007. In 2009 a documentary ''L'île aux Cannibales'' (''Cannibal Island'') was made, based on the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|2093164|Cannibal Island}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nazino Island, now located in [[Alexandrovsky District, Tomsk Oblast|Alexandrovsky District]] of [[Tomsk Oblast]], [[Russia]], is also called "Death Island" ({{lang-ru|Остров Смерти}}, ''{{lang|ru-Latn|Ostrov Smerti}}'') or "Cannibal Island" due to the events there.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7417">The '''Patnagarh bombing''' (also referred to as the '''Patnagarh parcel bomb''' in news reports) was a bombing that took place in [[Patnagarh]], [[Odisha]] (Orissa), India on 23 February 2018. Soumya Sekhar Sahu, a 26 year old software engineer, and his great aunt, Jemamani Sahu, were killed by a parcel bomb delivered to Soumya's house a few days after his wedding. Soumya's wife, Reema, was seriously injured. After months of investigation, police arrested a colleague of Soumya's mother whom she had replaced at the college where she taught. Actor Hara Rath and director Sridhar Martha are planning a film based on the event.

==Incident==
On 23 February 2018, five days after the wedding of Soumya Sekhar Sahu and Reema Sahu, an explosion occurred at their home in Patnagarh, Odisha, India as Soumya opened a just-delivered parcel. The parcel had a return address of a person unknown to either of them, S. K. Sharma of [[Raipur]], {{convert|230|km}} away. Soumya reportedly remarked, "This looks like a wedding gift.

Soumya and his great aunt Jemamani, who was visiting the couple at the time, suffered 90% [[Total body surface area|TBSA]] burns and died en route to hospital. Reema was taken to hospital with serious injuries.&lt;ref name="BBC initial story"&gt;{{cite news|title=Who sent the wedding gift bomb that killed this newlywed?|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-43497820|accessdate=12 May 2018|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
Neither of the couple had known enemies. Soumya Sekhar's parents were college teachers. Soumya worked for a Japanese electronics firm in Bangalore.&lt;ref name="completing the project"/&gt; 

Police still did not have a suspect a month after the fatal bombing. Pressured by press coverage, including a video of Soumya's wife wailing upon learning of her husband's death, the police turned the case over to an elite police branch in the state capital.&lt;ref name="completing the project"/&gt; One suspect was cleared after police traced a threatening call to a former boyfriend of Soumya's wife who believed he was dumped for a richer man; after he underwent a voluntary polygraph test,&lt;ref name="polygraph"&gt;{{cite news|title=Parcel bomb explosion: Three suspects to undergo polygraph test|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/parcel-bomb-explosion-three-suspects-to-undergo-polygraph-test/articleshow/63198350.cms|accessdate=6 May 2018|work=Times of India|date=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was dismissed as a suspect. Police investigators traced the package to a courier company, but it had no office video surveillance of the package's customer.&lt;ref name="completing the project"/&gt;

==Arrest==
In April 2018, [[Balangir]] police received an anonymous letter which blamed the parcel bombing on Soumya's "betrayal" and a loss of money, possibly as a result of a property dispute. The letter clarified that the sender was an S. K. Sinha, not R. K. Sharma, and also mentioned the involvement of "three men". Police investigators spent more than a month pursuing leads in four different cities. Finally, Soumya's mother studied the letter and recalled that her colleague often used the phrase "completing the project", which was similar to the phrase in the letter of "undertaking the project".&lt;ref name="completing the project"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CB may take suspect to Raipur"&gt;{{cite news|title=Patnagarh parcel bomb case: Crime Branch may take Punjilal to Raipur|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2018/may/03/patnagarh-parcel-bomb-case-crime-branch-may-take-punjilal-to-raipur-1809571.html|accessdate=12 May 2018|work=New Indian Express}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon being questioned again after the receipt of the letter by the police, Meher said that he had been approached and threatened if he didn't mail a letter. The police investigator did not believe the explanation, remarking, "It was the most incredible story that we've heard from a suspect". Police sent computer hardware belonging to the suspect to an Israeli company for analysis and recovery of deleted data.&lt;ref name="Israeli forensics"&gt;{{cite news|title=Patnagarh parcel bomb case: CB to rope in Israel agency to tighten box of evidence|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2018/apr/30/patnagarh-parcel-bomb-case-cb-to-rope-in-israel-agency-to-tighten-box-of-evidence-1808069.html|accessdate=6 May 2018|work=The New Indian Express|date=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meher was accused of traveling to Raipur without his mobile phone or buying a train ticket and posting the parcel, returning the same day.&lt;ref name="completing the project"/&gt;

==Significance and aftermath==
The parcel bombing was widely reported in India and other countries.

{{ReaganSeries}}
The '''Reagan Doctrine''' was a strategy orchestrated and implemented by the [[United States]] under the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan Administration]] to overwhelm the global influence of the [[Soviet Union]] in an attempt to end the [[Cold War]]. The doctrine was the centerpiece of [[Foreign policy of the Ronald Reagan administration|United States foreign policy from the early 1980s]] until the end of the Cold War in 1991.

Under the Reagan Doctrine, the United States provided overt and covert aid to [[anti-communist]] [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]] and [[resistance movement]]s in an effort to "[[rollback|roll back]]" Soviet-backed [[communist]] governments in [[Africa]], [[Asia]], and [[Latin America]]. The doctrine was designed to diminish Soviet influence in these regions as part of the administration's overall strategy to end the Cold War.

== Background ==
The Reagan Doctrine followed in the tradition of [[President of the United States|U.S. presidents]] developing foreign policy "doctrines", which were designed to reflect challenges facing international relations, and to propose foreign policy solutions. The practice began with the [[Monroe Doctrine]] in 1823, and continued with the [[Roosevelt Corollary]], sometimes called the '''Roosevelt Doctrine''', introduced by [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in 1904.

The current post–[[World War II]] tradition of Presidential doctrines started with the [[Truman Doctrine]] in 1947, under which the US provided support to the governments of [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]] as part of a [[Cold War]] strategy to keep both nations out of the Soviet sphere of influence.  It was followed by the [[Eisenhower Doctrine]], the [[Kennedy Doctrine]], the [[Johnson Doctrine]], the [[Nixon Doctrine]], and the [[Carter Doctrine]], all of which defined the foreign policy approaches of these respective U.S. presidents on some of the largest global challenges of their presidencies.

[[File:Remains of Soviet trucks in Afghanistan.JPEG|thumb|right|270 px|Remains of Soviet military vehicles in [[Kandahar|Kandahar, Afghanistan]] destroyed by the U.S.-backed [[mujahideen]].]] --&gt;

At least one component of the Reagan Doctrine technically pre-dated the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan Presidency]]. In [[Afghanistan]], the [[Jimmy Carter|Carter administration]] began providing limited covert military assistance to Afghanistan's [[mujahideen]] in an effort to drive the Soviets out of the nation, or at least raise the military and political cost of the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet occupation of Afghanistan]]. The policy of aiding the mujahideen in their war against the Soviet occupation was originally proposed by Carter's national security adviser [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] and was implemented by U.S. intelligence services. It enjoyed broad bipartisan political support.

Democratic congressman [[Charlie Nesbitt Wilson|Charlie Wilson]] became obsessed with the Afghan cause, and was able to leverage his position on the House Appropriations committees to encourage other Democratic congressmen to vote for CIA Afghan war money, with the tacit approval of [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Tip O'Neill|Tip O'Neill (D-MA)]], even as the Democratic party lambasted Reagan for the CIA's secret war in Central America. It was a complex web of relationships described in [[George Crile III]]'s book ''[[Charlie Wilson's War: The Extraordinary Story of the Largest Covert Operation in History|Charlie Wilson's War]]''.&lt;ref name=crile2/&gt;

Wilson teamed with CIA manager [[Gust Avrakotos]] and formed a team of a few dozen insiders who greatly enhanced the support for the Mujahideen, funneling it through [[Mohammad Zia ul-Haq|Zia ul-Haq's]] [[Inter Services Intelligence|ISI]]. Avrakotos and Wilson charmed leaders from various anti-Soviet countries including Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Israel, and China to increase support for the rebels. Avrakotos hired [[Michael G. Vickers]], a young Paramilitary Officer, to enhance the guerilla's odds by revamping the tactics, weapons, logistics, and training used by the Mujahideen.&lt;ref name=crile2&gt;{{Cite book |publisher=Atlantic Monthly Press |isbn=978-0-87113-854-5 |last=Crile |first=George |title=Charlie Wilson's war: the extraordinary story of the largest covert operation in history |location=New York |date=2003}}, pp. 246, 285, 302, and elsewhere&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Pillsbury]], a Pentagon official, and [[Vincent Cannistraro]] pushed the CIA to supply the [[FIM-92 Stinger|Stinger missile]] to the rebels.&lt;ref name=crile2 /&gt; President Reagan's Covert Action program has been given credit for assisting in ending the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalissues.org/article/258/anatomy-of-a-victory-cias-covert-afghan-war|title=Anatomy of a Victory: CIA's Covert Afghan War|work=globalissues.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Schweitzer (1994). ''Victory: The Reagan Administration's Secret Strategy That Hastened the Collapse of the Soviet Union'' (Paperback), Atlantic Monthly Press, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin and advocates ==
With the arrival of the [[Reagan administration]], [[The Heritage Foundation]] and other conservative foreign policy think tanks saw a political opportunity to significantly expand Carter's Afghanistan policy into a more global "doctrine", including U.S. support to anti-communist resistance movements in Soviet-allied nations in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.  According to political analysts Thomas Bodenheimer and Robert Gould, "it was the Heritage Foundation that translated theory into concrete policy. Heritage targeted nine nations for [[rollback]]: [[Afghanistan]], [[Angola]], [[Cambodia]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Iran]], [[Laos]], [[Libya]], [[Nicaragua]], and [[Vietnam]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rollback!: Right-wing Power in U.S. Foreign Policy|date=1 July 1999|publisher=South End Press|isbn=0896083454|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1980s, the Heritage Foundation's foreign policy expert on the [[Third World]], [[Michael Johns (policy analyst)|Michael Johns]], the foundation's principal Reagan Doctrine advocate, visited with resistance movements in Angola, Cambodia, Nicaragua, and other Soviet-supported nations and urged the Reagan administration to initiate or expand military and political support to them.  Heritage Foundation foreign policy experts also endorsed the Reagan Doctrine in two of their ''Mandate for Leadership'' books, which provided comprehensive policy advice to Reagan administration officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thedailycougar.com/2008/08/22/think-tank-fosters-bloodshed-terrorism/|title=Think tank fosters bloodshed, terrorism|work=The Daily Cougar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The result was that, unlike in Afghanistan, the Reagan Doctrine was rather quickly applied in Angola and Nicaragua, with the United States providing military support to the [[UNITA]] movement in Angola and the "[[contras]]" in Nicaragua, but without a declaration of war against either country. Addressing the Heritage Foundation in October 1989, UNITA leader [[Jonas Savimbi]] called the Heritage Foundation's efforts "a source of great support. No Angolan will forget your efforts. You have come to [[Jamba, Cuando Cubango|Jamba]], and you have taken our message to Congress and the Administration".&lt;ref name="heritage.org"&gt;[http://www.heritage.org/Research/Africa/HL217.cfm "The Coming Winds of Democracy in Angola," by Jonas Savimbi, Heritage Foundation Lecture #217, October 5, 1989.] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20061122165840/http://www.heritage.org/Research/Africa/HL217.cfm |date=November 22, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. aid to UNITA began to flow overtly after Congress repealed the [[Clark Amendment]], a long-standing legislative prohibition on military aid to UNITA.&lt;ref name="heritage.org"/&gt;

Following these victories, Johns and the Heritage Foundation urged further expanding the Reagan Doctrine to Ethiopia, where they argued that the [[1984 - 1985 famine in Ethiopia|Ethiopian famine]] was a product of the military and [[agriculture|agricultural]] policies of Ethiopia's Soviet-supported [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]] government. Johns and Heritage also argued that Mengistu's decision to permit a Soviet naval and air presence on the [[Red Sea]] ports of [[Eritrea]] represented a strategic challenge to U.S. security interests in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritage.org/research/MiddleEast/bg692.cfm "A U.S. Strategy to Foster Human Rights in Ethiopia", by Michael Johns, Heritage Foundation Backgrounder #692, February 23, 1989.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Heritage Foundation and the Reagan administration also sought to apply the Reagan Doctrine in Cambodia. The largest resistance movement fighting Cambodia's communist government was largely made up of members of the former [[Khmer Rouge]] regime, whose human rights record was among the worst of the 20th century. Therefore, Reagan authorized the provision of aid to a smaller Cambodian resistance movement, a coalition called the [[Khmer People's National Liberation Front]], known as the KPNLF and then run by [[Son Sann]]; in an effort to force an end to the Vietnamese occupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|authorlink=Nate Thayer|last=Thayer|first=Nate|year=1991|title=Cambodia: Misperceptions and Peace|journal=The Washington Quarterly|volume=14|issue=2|pp=179–191|doi=10.1080/01636609109477687}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Reagan Doctrine enjoyed strong support from the Heritage Foundation and the [[American Enterprise Institute]], the libertarian-oriented [[Cato Institute]] opposed the Reagan Doctrine, arguing in 1986 that "most Third World struggles take place in arenas and involve issues far removed from legitimate American security needs. U.S. involvement in such conflicts expands the republic's already overextended commitments without achieving any significant prospective gains. Instead of draining Soviet military and financial resources, we end up dissipating our own."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cato Institute Policy Analysis No. 74: U.S. Aid to Anti-Communist Rebels: The "Reagan Doctrine" and Its Pitfalls|url=http://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa074.pdf|website=Cato Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even Cato, however, conceded that the Reagan Doctrine had "fired the enthusiasm of the conservative movement in the United States as no foreign policy issue has done in decades". While opposing the Reagan Doctrine as an official governmental policy, Cato instead urged Congress to remove the legal barriers prohibiting private organizations and citizens from supporting these resistance movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa074.html|title=U.S. Aid to Anti-Communist Rebels: The "Reagan Doctrine" and Its Pitfalls|date=24 June 1986|work=cato.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reagan administration advocates ===
[[File:Frente Sur Contras 1987.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The U.S.-supported Nicaraguan [[contras]].]]
Within the Reagan administration, the doctrine was quickly embraced by nearly all of Reagan's top national security and foreign policy officials, including [[United States Secretary of Defense|Defense Secretary]] [[Caspar Weinberger]], [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations|UN Ambassador]] [[Jeane Kirkpatrick]], and a series of Reagan National Security advisers including [[John Poindexter]], [[Frank Carlucci]], and [[Colin Powell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Chang | first = Felix | title = Reagan Turns One Hundred: Foreign Policy Lessons | journal = The National Interest | date = February 11, 2011 | url = http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/ronnie-turns-one-hundred-4829 | accessdate = January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reagan himself was a vocal proponent of the policy.  Seeking to expand Congressional support for the doctrine in the [[1985 State of the Union Address]] in February 1985, Reagan said: "We must not break faith with those who are risking their lives...on every continent, from Afghanistan to Nicaragua...to defy Soviet aggression and secure rights which have been ours from birth. Support for freedom fighters is self-defense".

As part of his effort to gain Congressional support for the Nicaraguan [[contras]], Reagan labeled the contras "the moral equivalent of our [[Founding Fathers of the United States|founding fathers]]", which was controversial because the contras had shown a disregard for [[human rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishworldreview.com/jeff/jacoby111403.asp|title=Jeff Jacoby|work=jewishworldreview.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; There also were allegations that some members of the contra leadership were involved in [[cocaine]] trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://prorev.com/blum.htm "The Contras and Cocaine"], ''Progressive Review,'' testimony to U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Hearing on the Allegations of CIA Ties to Nicaraguan Contra Rebels and Crack Cocaine in American Cities, October 23, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reagan and other conservative advocates of the Reagan Doctrine advocates also argued that the doctrine served U.S. foreign policy and strategic objectives and was a moral imperative against the former [[Soviet Union]], which Reagan, his advisers, and supporters labeled an "[[Evil Empire speech|evil empire]]".

=== Other advocates ===
Other early conservative advocates for the Reagan Doctrine included influential conservative activist [[Grover Norquist]], who ultimately became a registered UNITA lobbyist and an economic adviser to Savimbi's UNITA movement in Angola,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150924013135/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb1367/is_199803/ai_n6384825 "Savimbi's Shell Game," ''Bnet.com'', March 1998]&lt;/ref&gt; and former Reagan speechwriter and current [[Congressperson|U.S. Congressman]] [[Dana Rohrabacher]], who made several secret visits with the mujahideen in Afghanistan and returned with glowing reports of their bravery against the Soviet occupation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/entity.jsp?id=1521846767-2190 "Profile: Dana Rohrabacher," ''Cooperative History Research Commons'', September 17, 2001.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060418144639/http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/entity.jsp?id=1521846767-2190 |date=April 18, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rohrabacher was led to Afghanistan by his contact with the mujahideen, Jack Wheeler.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

=== Phrase's origin ===

In 1985, as U.S. support was flowing to the [[Mujahideen]], Savimbi's [[UNITA]], and the Nicaraguan [[contras]], columnist [[Charles Krauthammer]], in an essay for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, labeled the policy the "Reagan Doctrine," and the name stuck.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,964873,00.html "The Reagan Doctrine"], by [[Charles Krauthammer]], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, April 1, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

Krauthammer has said of his writing in support of the Reagan Doctrine, 

{{quote|I basically came to the conclusion ... the Soviets had overextended their empire, and they were getting what the West had gotten with its overextended empire decades before a reaction, they got a rebellion, they got resistance. And the Soviets were now beginning to feel it, and the genius of Reagan, although I don't think they had a plan in doing this is he instinctively realized that one of the ways to go after the Soviets was indirect, and that is you go after their proxies, you go after their allies, you go after their clients, or even in Afghanistan you go after them directly. So that's what I called the Reagan Doctrine, it was sort of the opposite of the [[Brezhnev Doctrine]], which was whatever we control we keep. And Reagan was saying, no you don't.&lt;ref&gt;http://conversationswithbillkristol.org/video/charles-krauthammer/&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== "Rollback" replaces "containment" and "détente" ===
[[File:Jonas Savimbi.jpg|thumb|right|200px|U.S.-supported [[UNITA]] leader [[Jonas Savimbi]].]]
The Reagan Doctrine was especially significant because it represented a substantial shift in the post–World War II foreign policy of the United States. Prior to the Reagan Doctrine, U.S. foreign policy in the Cold War was rooted in "[[containment]]", as originally defined by [[George F. Kennan]], [[John Foster Dulles]], and other post–World War II U.S. foreign policy experts. In January 1977, four years prior to becoming president, Reagan bluntly stated, in a conversation with [[Richard V. Allen]], his basic expectation in relation to the Cold War. "My idea of American policy toward the Soviet Union is simple, and some would say simplistic," he said. "It is this: We win and they lose. What do you think of that?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501052925/http://www.hoover.org/publications/hoover-digest/article/7398 |archive-date=1 May 2011 |url=http://www.hoover.org/publications/hoover-digest/article/7398 |website=hoover.org |title=The Man Who Won the Cold War |first=Richard V. |last=Allen |author-link=Richard V. Allen }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a similar policy of "rollback" had been considered on a few occasions during the Cold War, the U.S. government, fearing an escalation of the Cold War and possible [[nuclear warfare|nuclear conflict]], chose not to confront the Soviet Union directly. With the Reagan Doctrine, those fears were set aside and the United States began to openly confront Soviet-supported governments through support of rebel movements in the doctrine's targeted countries.

One perceived benefit of the Reagan Doctrine was the relatively low cost of supporting guerrilla forces compared to the Soviet Union's expenses in propping up client states. Another benefit was the lack of direct involvement of American troops, which allowed the United States to confront Soviet allies without sustaining casualties. Especially since the [[September 11 attacks]], some Reagan Doctrine critics have argued that, by facilitating the transfer of large amounts of weapons to various areas of the world and by training military leaders in these regions, the Reagan Doctrine actually contributed to "[[Blowback (intelligence)|blowback]]" by strengthening some political and military movements that ultimately developed hostility toward the United States, such as [[al-Qaeda]] in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20090209220235/http://media.www.thedailycougar.com/media/storage/paper1206/news/2008/08/25/Opinion/Think.Tank.Fosters.Bloodshed.Terrorism-3401834.shtml "Think Tank Fosters Bloodshed, Terrorism," ''The Cougar'', August 25, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; However, no direct U.S. aid to [[Osama bin Laden]] or any of his affiliates has ever been established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Peter Bergen|last=Bergen|first=Peter|title=The Osama bin Laden I Know: An Oral History of al Qaeda's Leader|publisher=[[Simon and Schuster]]|year=2006|isbn=9780743295925|pp=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controversy over Nicaragua ===
{{Further|United States and state-sponsored terrorism#The Contras|Contras}}
Historian Greg Grandin described a disjuncture between official ideals preached by the United States and actual U.S. support for terrorism. "Nicaragua, where the United States backed not a counter insurgent state but anti-communist [[mercenaries]], likewise represented a disjuncture between the idealism used to justify U.S. policy and its support for political terrorism. ... The corollary to the idealism embraced by the Republicans in the realm of diplomatic public policy debate was thus political terror. In the dirtiest of Latin America's dirty wars, their faith in America's mission justified atrocities in the name of liberty".&lt;ref&gt;Grandin, Greg. ''Empire's Workshop: Latin America, The United States and the Rise of the New Imperialism'', Henry Holt &amp; Company 2007, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; Grandin examined the behaviour of the U.S.-backed contras and found evidence that it was particularly inhumane and vicious: "In Nicaragua, the U.S.-backed Contras decapitated, castrated, and otherwise mutilated civilians and foreign aid workers. Some earned a reputation for using spoons to gouge their victims' eyes out. In one raid, Contras cut the breasts of a civilian defender to pieces and ripped the flesh off the bones of another."&lt;ref&gt;Grandin, Greg. Empire's Workshop: Latin America, ''The United States and the Rise of the New Imperialism'', Henry Holt &amp; Company 2007, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Frederick H. Gareau has written that the Contras "attacked bridges, electric generators, but also state-owned agricultural cooperatives, rural health clinics, villages, and [[non-combatant]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s". U.S. agents were directly involved in the fighting. "CIA commandos launched a series of sabotage raids on Nicaraguan port facilities. They mined the country's major ports and set fire to its largest oil storage facilities." In 1984 the U.S. Congress ordered this intervention to be stopped; however, it was later shown that the Reagan administration illegally continued (See [[Iran–Contra affair]]). Gareau has characterized these acts as "wholesale terrorism" by the United States.&lt;ref name="Gareau"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gareau |first=Frederick H. |title=State Terrorism and the United States |year=2004 |publisher=Zed Books |location=London |isbn=1-84277-535-9 |pages=16 &amp; 166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A CIA manual for training the Nicaraguan [[Contras]] in [[psychological operations]], leaked to the media in 1984, entitled "Psychological Operations in Guerrilla War".&lt;ref name="KillingHope"&gt;{{cite book |last=Blum |first=William |authorlink=William Blum |title=Killing Hope: U.S. Military and CIA Interventions since World War II |year=2003 |publisher=Zed Books |location=Noida, India |isbn=1-84277-369-0 |page=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; recommended "selective use of violence for propagandistic effects" and to "neutralize" government officials. Nicaraguan Contras were taught to lead:

{{quote|...selective use of armed force for PSYOP psychological operations effect. ... Carefully selected, planned targets&amp;nbsp;– judges, police officials, tax collectors, etc.&amp;nbsp;– may be removed for PSYOP effect in a UWOA unconventional warfare operations area, but extensive precautions must insure that the people "concur" in such an act by thorough explanatory canvassing among the affected populace before and after conduct of the mission.|James Bovard|Freedom Daily&lt;ref name="FFF"&gt;{{cite web |title=Terrorism Debacles in the Reagan Administration |work=The Future of Freedom Foundation |url=http://www.fff.org/freedom/fd0406c.asp |accessdate=2006-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821215232/http://www.fff.org/freedom/fd0406c.asp |archivedate=2006-08-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Similarly, former diplomat Clara Nieto, in her book ''Masters of War'', charged that "the CIA launched a series of terrorist actions from the "mothership" off Nicaragua's coast. In September 1983, she charged the agency attacked [[Puerto Sandino]] with rockets. The following month, [[frogmen]] blew up the underwater oil pipeline in the same port – the only one in the country. In October there was an attack on Puerto Corinto, Nicaragua's largest port, with mortars, rockets, and grenades blowing up five large oil and gasoline storage tanks. More than a hundred people were wounded, and the fierce fire, which could not be brought under control for two days, forced the evacuation of 23,000 people."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Nieto |first=Clara |title=Masters of War: Latin America and United States Aggression from the Cuban Revolution Through the Clinton Years |location=New York |publisher=Seven Stories Press |year=2003 |pages=343–45 |isbn=1-58322-545-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Court of Justice]], when judging the case of ''[[Nicaragua v. United States]]'' in 1984, found that the United states was obligated to pay reparations to Nicaragua, because it had violated international law by actively supporting the Contras in their rebellion and by mining the Naval waters of Nicaragua.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case concerning military and paramilitary activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

Nicaragua vs United State (Merits)"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Covert implementation ===
As the Reagan administration set about implementing The Heritage Foundation plan in Afghanistan, Angola, and Nicaragua, it first attempted to do so covertly, not as part of official policy. "The Reagan government's initial implementation of the Heritage plan was done covertly", according to the book ''Rollback'', "following the longstanding custom that containment can be overt but rollback should be covert". Ultimately, however, the administration supported the policy more openly.

=== Congressional votes ===
While the doctrine benefited from strong support from the Reagan administration, The Heritage Foundation and several influential Members of Congress, many votes on critical funding for resistance movements, especially the Nicaraguan contras, were extremely close, making the Reagan Doctrine one of the more contentious American political issues of the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;''A Twilight Struggle: American Power and Nicaragua, 1977–1990'', [[Robert Kagan]], Simon &amp; Schuster, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Cold War's end ===
As arms flowed to the contras, Savimbi's UNITA and the mujahideen, the Reagan Doctrine's advocates argued that the doctrine was yielding constructive results for U.S. interests and global democracy.

In Nicaragua, pressure from the Contras led the Sandinstas to end the State of Emergency, and they subsequently lost the 1990 elections. In Afghanistan, the mujahideen bled the Soviet Union's military and paved the way for Soviet military defeat. In Angola, Savimbi's resistance ultimately led to a decision by the Soviet Union and [[Cuba]] to bring their troops and military advisors home from Angola as part of a negotiated settlement.

All of these developments were Reagan Doctrine victories, the doctrine's advocates argue, laying the ground for the ultimate [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;"It Was Reagan Who Tore Down That Wall," [[Dinesh D'Souza]], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', November 7, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Johns later argued that "the Reagan-led effort to support freedom fighters resisting Soviet oppression led successfully to the first major military defeat of the Soviet Union...Sending the Red Army packing from Afghanistan proved one of the single most important contributing factors in one of history's most profoundly positive and important developments".&lt;ref&gt;[http://michaeljohnsonfreedomandprosperity.blogspot.com/2008/01/charlie-wilsons-war-was-really-americas.html "Charlie Wilson's War Was Really America's War," by Michael Johns], January 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thatcher's view ===
Among others, [[Margaret Thatcher]], [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] from 1979 to 1990, has credited the Reagan Doctrine with aiding the end of the Cold War. In December 1997, Thatcher said that the Reagan Doctrine "proclaimed that the truce with communism was over. The West would henceforth regard no area of the world as destined to forego its liberty simply because the Soviets claimed it to be within their sphere of influence. We would fight a battle of ideas against communism, and we would give material support to those who fought to recover their nations from tyranny".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=108376|title=Lecture to The Heritage Foundation ("The Principles of Conservatism")|work=margaretthatcher.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iran–Contra affair ===
U.S. funding for the [[Contras]], who opposed the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Sandinista]] government of Nicaragua, was obtained from covert sources. The U.S. Congress did not authorize sufficient funds for the Contras' efforts, and the [[Boland Amendment]] barred further funding. In 1986, in an episode that became known as The [[Iran–Contra affair]], the Reagan administration illegally facilitated the sale of arms to Iran, the subject of an arms embargo, in the hope that the arms sales would secure the release of hostages and allow U.S. intelligence agencies to fund the Nicaraguan Contras.

In February 2002, [[UNITA]]'s [[Jonas Savimbi]] was killed by Angolan military forces in an ambush in eastern Angola. Savimbi was succeeded by a series of UNITA leaders, but the movement was so closely associated with Savimbi that it never recovered the political and military clout it held at the height of its influence in the late 1980s.

== End ==
The Reagan Doctrine continued into the administration of Reagan's successor, [[George H. W. Bush]], who won the U.S. presidency in November 1988. Bush's Presidency featured the final years of the Cold War and the [[Gulf War]], but the Reagan Doctrine soon faded from U.S. policy as the Cold War ended.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doublestandards.org/gould1.html Excerpted from ''The Reagan Doctrine: Third World Rollack'', End Press, 1989.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071108070306/http://www.doublestandards.org/gould1.html |date=2007-11-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush also noted a presumed [[peace dividend]] to the end of the Cold War with economic benefits of a decrease in [[military spending|defense spending]]. However, following the presidency of [[Bill Clinton]], a change in United States foreign policy was introduced with the presidency of his son [[George W. Bush]] and the new [[Bush Doctrine]], who increased military spending in response to the [[September 11th attacks]].

In Nicaragua, the [[Contra War]] ended after the Sandinista government, facing military and political pressure, agreed to new elections, in which the contras' political wing participated, in 1990. In Angola, an agreement in 1989 met Savimbi's demand for the removal of Soviet, Cuban and other military troops and advisers from Angola. Also in 1989, in relation to Afghanistan, Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] labeled the war against the U.S.-supported mujahideen a "bleeding wound" and ended the Soviet occupation of the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/afghanistan/96.htm "The Soviet Decision to Withdraw, 1986-1988" U.S. Library of Congress].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sinterklaas''''' ({{IPA-nl|ˌsɪntərˈklaːs}}) or ''Sint-Nicolaas'' ({{IPA-nl|sɪnt ˈnikoːlaːs|-|Nl-Sint Nikolaas2.ogg}}) is a legendary figure based on [[Saint Nicholas]], patron saint of children. Other names for the figure include ''De Sint'' ("The Saint"), ''De Goede Sint'' ("The Good Saint"), and ''De Goedheiligman'' ("The Good Holy Man") in Dutch; ''Saint Nicolas'' in French; ''Sinteklaas'' in [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]]; ''Sinterklaos'' in [[Limburgs]]; ''Saint-Nikloi'' in [[West Flemish]]; and ''Kleeschen'' and ''Zinniklos'' in [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]].

The feast of ''Sinterklaas'' celebrates the [[Saint Nicholas Day|name day of Saint Nicholas]] on 6&amp;nbsp;December.  The feast is celebrated annually with the giving of gifts on St. Nicholas' Eve (5&amp;nbsp;December) in the Netherlands and on the morning of 6&amp;nbsp;December, Saint Nicholas Day, in Belgium, Luxembourg and northern France (French Flanders, Lorraine and Artois). The tradition is also celebrated in territories of the former [[Dutch Empire]], including Curaçao and Suriname.

Sinterklaas is the primary source of the popular Christmas icon of [[Santa Claus]].&lt;ref name="Clark1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Clark|first=Cindy Dell|title=Flights of Fancy, Leaps of Faith: Children's Myths in Contemporary America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HQNz-JLYOWkC&amp;pg=PA25|date=1 November 1998|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226107783|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Sinterklaas'' is based on the historical figure of Saint Nicholas (270–343), a Greek bishop of [[Myra]] in present-day Turkey. He is depicted as an elderly, stately and serious man with white hair and a long, full beard. He wears a long red cape or [[chasuble]] over a traditional white bishop's [[alb]] and sometimes red [[stola]], dons a red [[mitre]] and ruby ring, and holds a gold-coloured [[crosier]], a long ceremonial shepherd's staff with a fancy curled top.
He traditionally rides a white [[Gray (horse)|horse]]. In the Netherlands, the horse is called ''Amerigo'', and in Belgium, it is named ''Slecht Weer Vandaag'', meaning "Bad Weather Today".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=|first=|title=Encyclopedia of Observances, Holidays and Celebrations from MobileReference|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5VhTa1Eiq7oC|date=1 January 2007|publisher=MobileReference|isbn=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sinterklaas carries a big, red book in which is written whether each child has been good or naughty in the past year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sinterklaas gedichten {{!}} Kies nu jouw leuke sinterklaasgedicht!|url=http://www.1001gedichten.nl/sinterklaas-gedichten/|website=www.1001gedichten.nl|accessdate=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zwarte Piet===
[[Image:Two Zwarte Piet.jpg|thumb|right|Two Dutch women in costume as [[Zwarte Piet]]]]
{{Main article|Zwarte Piet}}

Sinterklaas is assisted by many ''[[Zwarte Piet]]'' ("Black Pete"); helpers with black faces in colourful Moorish dress. Zwarte Piet first appeared in print as the nameless servant of Saint Nicholas in ''Sint-Nikolaas en zijn knecht'' ("St. Nicholas and His Servant/Apprentice"), published in 1850 by Amsterdam schoolteacher Jan Schenkman; however, the tradition appears to date back at least as far as the early 19th Century.&lt;ref&gt;E. Boer-Dirks, "Nieuw licht op Zwarte Piet. Een kunsthistorisch antwoord op de vraag naar de herkomst", ''Volkskundig Bulletin'', 19 (1993), pp. 1–35; 2–4, 10, 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zwarte Piet's colourful dress is based on 16th-century noble attire, with a [[Ruff (clothing)|ruff]] ([[lace]] collar) and a feathered cap. He is typically depicted carrying a bag which contains candy for the children, which they toss around, a tradition supposedly originating in the story of Saint Nicholas saving three young girls from prostitution by tossing golden coins through their window at night to pay their [[dowry|dowries]].

Traditionally, he would also carry a birch rod (Dutch: ''roe''), a [[chimney sweep]]'s broom made of willow branches, used to spank children who had been naughty. Some of the older Sinterklaas songs make mention of naughty children being put in Zwarte Piet's bag and being taken back to Spain. This part of the legend refers to the times that the [[Barbary slave trade|Moors raided the European coasts]], and as far as Iceland, to abduct the local people into slavery. This quality can be found in other [[companions of Saint Nicholas]] such as [[Krampus]] and [[Père Fouettard]].&lt;ref&gt;''Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters: White Slavery in the Mediterranean'', the Barbary Coast, and Italy, 1500–1800, Robert Davis, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In modern versions of the Sinterklaas feast, however, Zwarte Piet no longer carries the ''roe'' and children are no longer told that they will be taken back to Spain in Zwarte Piet's bag if they have been naughty.

Over the years many stories have been added, and Zwarte Piet has developed from a rather unintelligent helper into a valuable assistant to the absent-minded saint. In modern adaptations for television, Sinterklaas has developed a Zwarte Piet for every function, such as a head Piet (''Hoofdpiet''), a navigation Piet (''Wegwijspiet'') to navigate the steamboat from Spain to the Netherlands, a gift-wrapping Piet (''Pakjespiet'') to wrap all the gifts, and an acrobatic Piet to climb roofs and chimneys.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nos.nl/artikel/565895-wie-is-die-zwarte-piet-eigenlijk.html nos.nl]; ''Wie is die Zwarte Piet eigenlijk?'', 23 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally Zwarte Piet's face is said to be black because he is a [[Moors|Moor]] from Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Christmas: A Candid History |first=Bruce David |last=Forbes |year=2007 |place=University of California Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, some prefer to say that his face is blackened with [[soot]] because he has to climb through chimneys to deliver gifts for Sinterklaas.

The figure of Zwarte Piet is considered by some to be racist. Accordingly, the traditions surrounding the holiday of Sinterklaas have been the subject of numerous editorials, debates, documentaries, protests and even violent clashes at festivals.&lt;ref name="Emma Thomas"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2474693/Zwarte-Piet-abolished-Outrage-Netherlands-Black-Pete-Christmas-tradition.html |title=Outrage in Netherlands over calls to abolish 'Black Pete' clowns which march in Christmas parade dressed in blackface |date= 24 October 2013| author= Emma Thomas| work= Daily Mail| accessdate= 27 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Felicity Morse"&gt;{{cite web | work= The Huffington Post|location= UK | author= Felicity Morse | url= http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/12/06/zwarte-piet-black-pete-christmas-dutch-netherlands_n_2249412.html |title=Zwarte Piet: Opposition Grows To 'Racist Black Pete' Dutch Tradition |accessdate= 27 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some large cities and television channels now only display Zwarte Piet characters with some soot marks on the face rather than full blackface, so-called ''roetveegpieten'' or ''schoorsteenpieten'' ("chimney Petes").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nederland/rtl-stopt-met-zwarte-piet-voortaan-alleen-pieten-met-roetvegen]; "RTL stopt met Zwarte Piet, voortaan alleen pieten met roetvegen", 24 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nos.nl/artikel/2141314-geen-zwarte-piet-meer-in-amsterdam-alleen-schoorsteenpieten.html]; "Geen Zwarte Piet meer in Amsterdam, alleen Schoorsteenpieten", 4 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, both Zwarte Piet and the holiday remain popular in the Netherlands.

In a 2013 survey, 92% of the Dutch public did not perceive Zwarte Piet as racist or associate him with slavery, and 91% were opposed to altering the character's appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/21993260/__VN_wil_einde_Sinterklaas__.html |title=VN wil einde Sinterklaasfeest – Binnenland &amp;#124; Het laatste nieuws uit Nederland leest u op Telegraaf.nl [binnenland&amp;#93; |work=De Telegraaf |date=22 October 2013 |accessdate=19 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220063529/http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/21993260/__VN_wil_einde_Sinterklaas__.html |archivedate=20 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar survey in 2018, 88% of the Dutch public did not perceive Zwarte Piet as racist, and 54% were happy with the character's modernized appearance (a mix of ''roetveegpieten'' and blackface).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://eenvandaag.avrotros.nl/panels/opiniepanel/alle-uitslagen/item/onderzoek-zwarte-piet-is-genoeg-aangepast/ |title=Onderzoek: Zwarte Piet is genoeg aangepast |work=Een Vandaag |date=11 November 2018 |accessdate=30 November 2018 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arrival from Spain ===
[[File:Sint-intocht-boot.jpg|thumb|Sinterklaas and his Zwarte Piet helpers arriving by [[steamboat]] from Spain]]

The festivities traditionally begin each year in mid-November (the first Saturday after 11 November), when Sinterklaas "arrives" by a steamboat at a designated seaside town, supposedly from Spain. In the Netherlands this takes place in a different port each year, whereas in Belgium it always takes place in the city of [[Antwerp]]. The steamboat anchors, then Sinterklaas disembarks and parades through the streets on his horse, welcomed by children cheering and singing traditional Sinterklaas songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Zwarte Piet'' assistants throw candy and small, round, gingerbread-like cookies, either ''[[kruidnoten]]'' or ''[[pepernoot|pepernoten]]'', into the crowd. The event is broadcast live on national television in the Netherlands and Belgium.

Following this national arrival, every other town celebrates its own ''intocht van Sinterklaas'' (arrival of Sinterklaas). Local arrivals usually take place later on the same Saturday of the national arrival, the next Sunday (the day after he arrives in the Netherlands or Belgium), or one weekend after the national arrival. In places a boat cannot reach, Sinterklaas arrives by train, horse, horse-drawn carriage or even a fire truck.

Sinterklaas is said to come from Spain, possibly because in 1087, half of Saint Nicholas' relics were transported to the Italian city of [[Bari]], which later formed part of the Spanish [[Kingdom of Naples]]. Others suggest that [[mandarin oranges]], traditionally gifts associated with St. Nicholas, led to the misconception that he must have been from Spain. This theory is backed by a Dutch poem documented in 1810 in New York and provided with an English translation:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stnicholascenter.org/Brix?pageID=864 |title=Knickerbocker Santa Claus |publisher=St. Nicholas Center |date= 4 December 1953 |accessdate= 4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stnicholascenter.org"&gt;[http://www.stnicholascenter.org/stnic/images/alexander-anderson-1810b.jpg ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208115421/http://www.stnicholascenter.org/stnic/images/alexander-anderson-1810b.jpg |date=8 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The text presented here comes from a pamphlet that [[John Pintard]] released in New York in 1810. It is the earliest source mentioning Spain in connection to ''Sinterklaas''. Pintard wanted St. Nicholas to become patron saint of New York and hoped to establish a ''Sinterklaas'' tradition. Apparently he got help from the Dutch community in New York, that provided him with the original Dutch ''Sinterklaas'' poem. Strictly speaking, the poem does not state that Sinterklaas ''comes'' from Spain, but that he needs to ''go'' to Spain to pick up the oranges and pomegranates. So the link between Sinterklaas and Spain goes through the oranges, a much appreciated treat in the 19th century. Later the connection with the oranges got lost, and Spain became his home.

=== Period leading up to Saint Nicholas' Eve ===
[[File:Bag of pepernoten.JPG|thumb|[[Kruidnoten]], small, round [[gingerbread]]-like [[cookie]]s]]
[[File:Chocoladeletter A.jpg|thumb|A [[chocolate letter]], typical Sinterklaas candy in the Netherlands]]
In the weeks between his arrival and 5 December, Sinterklaas also visits schools, hospitals and shopping centers. He is said to ride his white-grey horse over the rooftops at night, delivering gifts through the chimney to the well-behaved children. Traditionally, naughty children risked being caught by Black Pete, who carried a jute bag and willow cane for that purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stnicholascenter.org/Brix?pageID=92|title=Sinterklaas traditions in the Netherlands}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before going to bed, children put their shoes next to the fireplace chimney of the coal-fired stove or fireplace (or in modern times close to the [[Radiator (heating)|central heating radiator]]). They leave the shoe with a carrot or some hay in it and a bowl of water nearby "for Sinterklaas' horse", and the children sing a Sinterklaas song. The next day they find some candy or a small present in their shoes.

Typical Sinterklaas treats traditionally include [[mandarin orange]]s, [[pepernoot|''pepernoten'']], ''[[speculaas]]'' (sometimes filled with [[almond paste]]), [[banketletter]] (pastry filled with almond paste) or a [[chocolate letter]] (the first letter of the child's name made out of chocolate), [[Chocolate money|chocolate coins]], ''suikerbeest'' (animal-shaped figures made of [[Tablet (confectionery)|sugary confection]]), and ''[[marzipan]]'' figures. Newer treats include gingerbread biscuits or and a figurine of Sinterklaas made of chocolate and wrapped in colored aluminum foil.

=== Saint Nicholas' Eve and Saint Nicholas' Day===
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas' Eve, 5 December, became the chief occasion for gift-giving during the winter holiday season. The evening is called ''Sinterklaasavond'' ("Sinterklaas evening") or ''Pakjesavond'' ("gifts evening", or literally "packages evening").

On the evening of 5 December, parents, family, friends or acquaintences pretend to act on behalf of "Sinterklaas", or his helpers, and fool the children into thinking that "Sinterklaas" has really given them presents. This may be done through a note that is "found", explaining where the presents are hidden, as though Zwarte Piet visited them and left a [[burlap]] sack of presents with them. Sometimes a neighbor will knock on the door (pretending to be a Zwarte Piet) and leave the sack outside for the children to retrieve; this varies per family. When the presents arrive, the living room is decked out with them, much as on Christmas Day in English-speaking countries. On 6 December "Sinterklaas" departs without any ado, and all festivities are over.

In the Southern Netherlands and Belgium, most children have to wait until the morning of 6 December to receive their gifts, and Sinterklaas is seen as a festivity almost exclusively for children. The shoes are filled with a poem or wish list for Sinterklaas and carrots, hay or sugar cubes for the horse on the evening of the fifth and in Belgium often a bottle of beer for Zwarte Piet and a cup of coffee for Sinterklaas are placed next to them. Also in some areas, when it is time for children to give up their [[pacifier]], they place it into his or her shoe ("safekeeping by Sinterklaas") and it is replaced with chocolate the next morning.

The present is often creatively disguised by being packaged in a humorous, unusual or personalised way. This is called a ''surprise'' (from the French ).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.female-gamers.nl/news.php?extend.6774 |title=Artikel: Sinterklaas Gaming Surprises |language=Dutch |publisher=Female-Gamers.nl |date=15 November 2011 |accessdate=4 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426022540/http://www.female-gamers.nl/news.php?extend.6774 |archivedate=26 April 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.knutselidee.nl/startthema.htm?surprise |title=Examples of typical surprises |publisher=knutselidee.nl | language = Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poems from Sinterklaas usually accompany gifts, bearing a personal message for the receiver. It is usually a humorous poem which often teases the recipient for well-known bad habits or other character deficiencies.

In recent years, influenced by North-American media and the Anglosaxian Christmas tradition, when the children reach the age where they  get told "the big secret of Sinterklaas", some people will shift to Christmas Eve or Christmas Day for the present giving. Older children in Dutch families where the children are too old to believe in Sinterklaas anymore, also often celebrate Christmas with presents instead of ''pakjesavond''. Instead of such gifts being brought by Sinterklaas, family members ordinarily draw names for an event comparable to [[Secret Santa]]. Because of the popularity of his "older cousin" Sinterklaas, Santa Claus is however not commonly seen in the Netherlands and Belgium.

=== Pre-Christian Europe ===
[[H. A.

At the same time, it seems clear that the Saint Nicholas tradition contains a number of elements that are not [[ecclesiastical]] in origin.&lt;ref&gt;Meertens Instituut, [http://www.meertens.knaw.nl/cms/nl/nieuws-agenda/nieuws-overzicht/202-nieuws-2013/144371-faq-zwarte-piet ''Piet en Sint – veelgestelde vragen''], ''meertens.knaw.nl''.

Boer-Dirks, "Nieuw licht op Zwarte Piet. Een kunsthistorisch antwoord op de vraag naar de herkomst", ''Volkskundig Bulletin'', 19 (1993), pp. 1–35, this tradition is derived from German folkloristic research of the first decades of the 19th century (p. 2). This happened relatively early; already in 1863, the Dutch lexicographer Eelco Verwijs is found comparing the feast of St. Nicholas with Germanic pagan traditions and noting that the appearance of Wodan and Eckart in December reminds him of that of St. Nicholas and "his servant Ruprecht" (''De christelijke feesten: Eene bijdrage tot de kennis der germaansche mythologie. I. Sinterklaas'' (The Hague, 1863), p. 40). An older reference to a possible pagan origin of a "St. Nicholas and his black servant with chains", apparently in a Dutch setting, is found in L. Ph. C. van den Bergh, ''Nederlandsche volksoverleveringen en godenleer'' (Utrecht, 1836), p. 74 ("...de verschijning van den zwarten knecht van St. Nikolaas met kettingen, die de kinders verschrikt, ... acht ik van heidenschen oorsprong").&lt;/ref&gt;

Since some elements of the ''Sinterklaas'' celebration are unrelated to Christianity, there are theories regarding the [[Paganism|pagan]] origins of various customs of the holiday stemming from areas where the Germanic peoples were Christianized and retained elements of their indigenous traditions, surviving in various forms into modern depictions of ''Sinterklaas''. Non-Christian elements in ''Sinterklaas'' that arguably could have been of pagan origin:
* Sinterklaas rides the rooftops on his white horse which has various names; Odin rides the sky with his grey horse [[Sleipnir]].
* Sinterklaas gives chocolate letters to children, like Odin gave the rune letters to man.
* Sinterklaas carries a staff and has mischievous helpers with black faces, who listen at chimneys to find out whether children are bad or good and report to Sinterklaas; Odin has a spear and his black ravens, [[Huginn and Muninn]], who report what happens in the world to Odin.&lt;ref&gt;McKnight, George Harley (1917).

=== Middle Ages ===
The ''Sinterklaasfeest'' arose during the [[Middle Ages]]. The feast was both an occasion to help the poor, by putting money in their shoes (which evolved into putting presents in children's shoes) and a wild feast, similar to [[Carnival]], that often led to costumes, a "topsy-turvy" overturning of daily roles, and mass public drunkenness.

In early traditions, students elected one of their classmates as "bishop" on St. Nicholas Day, who would rule until 28 December (Innocents Day), and they sometimes acted out events from the bishop's life. As the festival moved to city streets, it became more lively.&lt;ref name=Temple&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r8-X-quSAKYC&amp;pg=PA291|first1=Temple|last1=Hauptfleisch|author1-link=Temple Hauptfleisch|first2=Shulamith|last2=Lev-Aladgem|first3=Jacqueline|last3=Martin|first4=Willmar|last4=Sauter|first5=Henri|last5=Schoenmakers|title=Festivalising!: Theatrical Events, Politics and Culture|location=Amsterdam and New York|publisher=International Federation for Theatre Research|year=2007|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 16th and 17th centuries ===
During the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in 16th- and 17th-century Europe, Protestant reformers like [[Martin Luther]] changed the Saint gift bringer to the Christ Child or ''[[Christkindl]]'' and moved the date for giving presents from 6 December to Christmas Eve. Certain protestant municipalities and clerics forbade Saint Nicholas festivities, as the Protestants wanted to abolish the cult of saints and saint adoration, while keeping the midwinter gift-bringing feast alive.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, Bruce David, ''Christmas: a candid history'', University of California Press, 2007, {{ISBN|0-520-25104-0}}, pp. 68–79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Martin Luther und der Festbrauch, Cologne, 1959 | url= https://www.worldcat.org/title/martin-luther-und-der-festbrauch/oclc/613003275?referer=br&amp;ht=edition|last=Köhler|first=Erika}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.luther2017.de/kr/wiki/reformation-in-der-weihnachtsstube/martin-luther-soll-das-christkind-erfunden-haben/ |publisher=Stiftung Luthergedenkstätten in Sachsen-Anhalt – Staatliche Geschäftsstelle "Luther 2017" |title=Martin Luther soll das Christkind erfunden haben |accessdate=5 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the successful [[Dutch Revolt|revolt]] of the largely Protestant northern provinces of the Low Countries against the rule of Roman Catholic king [[Philip II of Spain]], the new Calvinist regents, ministers and clericals prohibited celebration of Saint Nicholas. The newly independent [[Dutch Republic]] officially became a Protestant country and abolished public Catholic celebrations. Nevertheless, the Saint Nicholas feast never completely disappeared in the Netherlands. In Amsterdam, where the public Saint Nicholas festivities were very popular, main events like street markets and fairs were kept alive with persons impersonating Nicholas dressed in red clothes instead of a bishop's tabard and miter. The Dutch government eventually tolerated private family celebrations of Saint Nicholas' Day, as can be seen on [[Jan Steen]]'s painting ''[[The Feast of Saint Nicholas]]''.

=== 19th century ===
In the 19th century, the saint emerged from hiding and the feast became more secularized at the same time.&lt;ref name=Temple /&gt; The modern tradition of ''Sinterklaas'' as a children's feast was likely confirmed with the illustrated children's book ''Sint-Nicolaas en zijn knecht'' ('Saint Nicholas and his servant'), written in 1850 by the teacher Jan Schenkman (1806–1863). Some say he introduced the images of Sinterklaas' delivering presents by the chimney, riding over the roofs of houses on a [[Gray (horse)|grey]] horse, and arriving from Spain by [[steamboat]], which at that time was an exciting modern invention. Perhaps building on the fact that Saint Nicholas historically is the patron saint of the sailors (many churches dedicated to him have been built near harbors), Schenkman could have been inspired by the Spanish customs and ideas about the saint when he portrayed him arriving via the water in his book. Schenkman introduced the song ''Zie ginds komt de stoomboot'' ("Look over yonder, the steamboat is arriving"), which is still popular in the Netherlands.

In Schenkman's version, the medieval figures of the mock devil, which later changed to Oriental or Moorish helpers, was portrayed for the first time as black African and called ''Zwarte Piet'' (Black Peter).&lt;ref name=Temple /&gt;

=== World War II ===
During the [[German occupation of the Netherlands]] (1940–1945) many of the traditional ''Sinterklaas'' rhymes were rewritten to reflect current events.&lt;ref&gt;Some of these were collected, published in 2009 by Hinke Piersma, a researcher at the [[Dutch Institute for War Documentation]].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) was often celebrated. In 1941, for instance, the RAF dropped boxes of candy over the occupied Netherlands. One classical poem turned contemporary was the following:

{{Col-begin}}
{{Col-break}}
;Dutch
&lt;poem&gt;
''Sinterklaas, kapoentje,''
''Gooi wat in mijn schoentje,''
''Gooi wat in mijn laarsje,''
''Dank U Sinterklaasje''
&lt;/poem&gt;

;World War II version
&lt;poem&gt;
''R.A.F. Kapoentje,''
''Gooi wat in mijn schoentje,''
''Bij de Moffen gooien,''
''Maar in Holland strooien!''
&lt;/poem&gt;

{{Col-break}}
;English
&lt;poem&gt;
Sinterklaas, little capon,
Throw something in my little shoe,
Throw something in my little boot,
Thank you dear Sinterklaas
&lt;/poem&gt;

;World War II version
&lt;poem&gt;
R.A.F. little Capon,
throw something in my little shoe
throw [bombs] at the Krauts
but scatter [candy] in Holland!
&lt;/poem&gt;
{{col-end}}
This is a variation of one of the best-known traditional Sinterklaas rhymes, with "RAF" replacing "Sinterklaas" in the first line (the two expressions have the same metrical characteristics in the first and second, and in the third and fourth lines). The Dutch word ''kapoentje'' (little rascal) is traditional to the rhyme, but in this case it also alludes to a [[capon]]. The second line is straight from the original rhyme, but in the third and fourth line the RAF is encouraged to drop bombs on the ''Moffen'' (slur for Germans, like "krauts" in English) and candy over the Netherlands. Many of the ''Sinterklaas'' poems of this time noted the lack of food and basic necessities, and the German occupiers having taken everything of value; others expressed admiration for the [[Dutch Resistance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Originally ''Sinterklaas'' was only accompanied with one (or sometimes two) ''Zwarte Pieten'', but just after the liberation of the Netherlands, Canadian soldiers organized a Sinterklaas party with many Zwarte Pieten, and ever since this has been the custom, each Piet normally having his own dedicated task.&lt;ref&gt;Sijs, Nicoline van der (2009) ''Cookies, Coleslaw, and Stoops''.

== Sinterklaas in the former Dutch colonies ==
In [[Curaçao]], Dutch-style Sinterklaas events are organized to this day. The Zwarte Piet characters have their faces painted all the colours of the rainbow. Prime Minister [[Ivar Asjes]] has spoken negatively of the tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nu.nl/binnenland/3630372/zwarte-en-gekleurde-pieten-curaao.html|title=Zwarte en gekleurde Pieten op Curaçao|publisher=Nu.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the government of [[Gerrit Schotte]] threatened to withdraw the grant for the Dutch tradition after the Curaçaoan activist [[Quinsy Gario]] was arrested, when he protested in [[Dordrecht]] against the use of Zwarte Piet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ad.nl/buitenland/op-curacao-hebben-ze-al-regenboogpieten~a4022a1e/|title=Op Curaçao hebben ze al regenboogpieten|work=Algemeen Dagblad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dutch-style Sinterklaas events are also organized in Suriname to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.trouw.nl/home/surinaamse-sint-ruilt-piet-in-voor-suikerfee~affc7ab4/|title=Surinaamse Sint ruilt Piet in voor suikerfee|work=Trouw}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, opposition member of parliament and former president [[Ronald Venetiaan]] called for an official ban on Sinterklaas because he considers Zwarte Piet to be a racist element.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starnieuws.com/index.php/welcome/index/nieuwsitem/8579|title=Starnieuws – NDP ondersteunt Venetiaan met afschaffing Sinterklaas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970 the Surinamese playwright [[Eugène Drenthe]] envisioned the character of ''Gudu Ppa'' ("Father of Riches" in [[Sranantongo]]) as a postcolonial replacement of Sinterklaas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leiden.courant.nu/issue/LLC/1980-11-19/edition/0/page/15|title=Leidse Courant – 19 november 1980 – pagina 15|work=Historische Kranten, Erfgoed Leiden en Omstreken}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of a white man, Gudu Ppa was black. His helpers symbolized Suriname's different ethnic groups, replacing Zwarte Piet. 5 December was officially renamed ''Kinderdag'' ("[[Children's Day]]") in Suriname. Although promoted by the military regime in the eighties, Gudu Ppa never really caught on.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==Sinterklaas as a source for Santa Claus==
''Sinterklaas'' is the basis for the North American figure of [[Santa Claus]]. It is often claimed that during the [[American War of Independence]], the inhabitants of New York City, a former Dutch colonial town ([[New Amsterdam]]), reinvented their ''Sinterklaas'' tradition, as Saint Nicholas was a symbol of the city's non-English past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jona Lendering |url=http://www.livius.org/ne-nn/nicholas/nicholas_of_myra3.html#New |title=Saint Nicholas, Sinterklaas, Santa Claus |publisher= [[Livius.org]] |date= 20 November 2008 |accessdate= 4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1770s the ''New York Gazetteer'' noted that the feast day of "St. a Claus" was celebrated "by the descendants of the ancient Dutch families, with their usual festivities."&lt;ref&gt;Shorto, Russell. ''The Island at the Center of the World''. Random House LLC, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In a study of the "children's books, periodicals and journals" of New Amsterdam, the scholar Charles Jones did not find references to Saint Nicholas or Sinterklaas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Jones, ''Saint Nicholas of Myra, Bari, and Manhattan: Biography of a Legend'' (Chicago: [[University of Chicago Press]], 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; Howard G. Hageman, of New Brunswick Theological Seminary, maintains that the tradition of celebrating Sinterklaas in New York existed in the early settlement of the [[Hudson Valley]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Irving's stories prominently featured legends of the early Dutch settlers, so while the traditional practice may have died out, Irving's St. Nicholas may have been a revival of that dormant Dutch strand of folklore. In his 1812 revisions to ''A History of New York'', Irving inserted a dream sequence featuring St. Nicholas soaring over treetops in a flying wagon{{spaced ndash}} a creation others would later dress up as Santa Claus.

But was Irving the first to revive the Dutch folklore of Sinterklaas? In New York, two years earlier [[John Pintard]] published a pamphlet with illustrations of [[Alexander Anderson (illustrator)|Alexander Anderson]] in which he calls for making Saint Nicholas the patron Saint of New York and starting a Sinterklaas tradition. He was apparently assisted by the Dutch because in his pamphlet he included an old Dutch Sinterklaas poem with an English translation. In the Dutch poem, Saint Nicholas is referred to as 'Sancta Claus'.&lt;ref name="stnicholascenter.org"/&gt; Ultimately, his initiative helped ''Sinterklaas'' to pop up as Santa Claus in the Christmas celebration, which returned{{spaced ndash}} freed of episcopal dignity and ties{{spaced ndash}} via England and later Germany to Europe again.

The Saint Nicholas Society of New York celebrates a feast on 6 December to this day. The town of [[Rhinebeck (village), New York|Rhinebeck]] in [[Dutchess County, New York]], which was founded by Dutch and German immigrants, has an annual Sinterklaas celebration. It includes Sinterklaas' crossing the Hudson River and then a parade to the center of town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sinterklaasrhinebeck.com/ |title=Sinterklaas in Rhinebeck |publisher=sinterklaasrhinebeck.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in 16th–17th-century Europe, many Protestants changed the gift bringer from Sinterklaas to the Christ Child or ''[[Christkindl]]'' (corrupted in English to Kris Kringle). Similarly, the date of giving gifts changed from 5 or 6 December to Christmas Eve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Forbes |first=Bruce David |title=Christmas: A Candid History |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |year=2007 |isbn=0-520-25104-0 |pages= 68–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sinterklaas in fiction==
In a scene in ''[[Miracle on 34th Street]]'', a Dutch girl recognises [[Santa Claus|Kris Kringle]] as Sinterklaas. They converse in Dutch and sing a Sinterklaas song while she sits on his lap, to the amazement of [[Miracle on 34th Street#Character names in different versions|Susan Walker]], who is then convinced that he is the real [[Santa Claus]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Sinterklaas has been the subject of a number of Dutch novels, films and television series, primarily aimed at children. Sinterklaas-themed children's films include ''[[Winky's Horse]]'' (2005) and the sequel ''[[Where Is Winky's Horse?]]'' (2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0447679|Winky's Horse}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0926766|Where Is Winky's Horse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sinterklaas-themed films aimed at adults include the [[drama film|drama]] ''[[Makkers Staakt uw Wild Geraas]]'' (1960), which won a [[Silver Bear]] award at the [[11th Berlin International Film Festival]]; the [[romantic comedy]] ''[[Alles is Liefde]]'' (2007) and its Belgian [[remake]] ''Zot van A.'' (2010); and the [[Dick Maas]]-directed [[horror film]] ''[[Sint]]'' (2010).&lt;ref&gt;Guido Franken, [http://www.nlfilmdoek.nl/artikelen/algemeen/sinterklaas-in-de-nederlandse-film/ "Sinterklaas in de Nederlandse film"], Neerlands Filmdoek, 29 November 2013 (Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[De Club van Sinterklaas]]'' is a Sinterklaas-themed soap opera aimed at children. The popular television series has run since 1999 and has had a number of spin-off series.  Since 2001, a Sinterklaas "news" program aimed at children is broadcast daily on Dutch television during the holiday season, the ''Sinterklaasjournaal''. The Dutch-Belgian [[Nickelodeon]] series ''Slot Marsepeinstein'' has aired since 2009.&lt;ref name="tvtropes"&gt;[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sinterklaas "Sinterklaas"], TVTropes.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the first half of ''[[A War of Gifts]]'' by [[Orson Scott Card]] is about the Sinterklaas tradition, including chapter 4 "Sinterklaas Eve" and 5 "Sinterklaas Day".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Card|first1=Orson Scott|title=A War of Gifts: An Ender Story|date=November 2007|publisher=[[Tor Books|Tor / Tom Doherty Associates]]|isbn=978-0-7653-1282-2|pages=47–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fourth episode of the television series ''[[The Librarians (2014 TV series)|The Librarians]]'' ("And Santa's Midnight Ride"), Santa ([[Bruce Campbell]]) is an "immortal avatar" who has existed in many different incarnations throughout history. After experiencing [[mistletoe]] poisoning, he briefly turns into Sinterklaas, using his magic to make toys appear in people's shoes, before regaining control of his current incarnation.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Sinterklaas also appeared in ''[[Sesamstraat]]'', the Dutch version of ''[[Sesame Street]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2018|reason=Was he a regular character, a seasonal one, or appeared occasionally?}}

The '''Sonot Kkaazoot''' is the premier long-distance [[Cross-country skiing|cross-country ski]] race in [[Fairbanks, Alaska]]. The race includes two events, a 50&amp;nbsp;km (31 mile) and 20&amp;nbsp;km (12.5 mile) course. Both events begin and end on the [[Chena River]] in downtown Fairbanks. Both events are freestyle, mass start and are raced simultaneously.

==Origins==
The race was founded in 1988 by noted Fairbanks skier [[Bad Bob Baker|Bob Baker]]. The name of the race is based on a [[Koyukon language|Koyukon]] word which translates roughly as 'sliding around in early spring' and was used by Native people to describe the motion of cross-country skiers.

==Course==


Both the 20&amp;nbsp;km and 50&amp;nbsp;km events begin and end on the [[Chena River]] above the Cushman Street bridge in downtown Fairbanks. The course then proceeds up the Chena River, entering [[Fort Wainwright]] army post and continuing as far as the Birch Hill Ski &amp; Snowboard Area. At that point the 20&amp;nbsp;km race turns around and returns via the same course back to the start/finish area.

The 50&amp;nbsp;km course proceeds up the Birch Hill alpine ski hill to connect with the trails system at the Birch Hill Recreation Area. From there the course follows all of the trails in the Birch Hill system (excepting the classic-only trails) in a counter-clockwise direction. After approximately 27&amp;nbsp;km the course again returns to the top of the alpine ski hill and proceeds back to the river and to the start/finish area by the same route. 

In 2012 the 50&amp;nbsp;km race will make use of a new trail constructed to gain access to the Birch Hill Recreation Area. Rather than climbing directly up the alpine ski hill, the Sonot Connector trail climbs through the forest to the east of the ski hill, starting from the top of the rope tow and making two long switchbacks. 

Adjustments to the course are sometimes made due to weather or snow conditions. When it is not possible to hold the race on river, either due to ice conditions or cold temperatures, the race may be held entirely on the trail system at the Birch Hill Recreation Area, beginning and ending in the stadium area. In these cases the race is usually shortened to compensate for the addition of steeper terrain. In years of low snowfall when it is not possible to easily connect between the river and the alpine ski area, the race may be held entirely on the river. In this the 20&amp;nbsp;km course remains unchanged, but the 50&amp;nbsp;km course proceeds slightly further up the river before turning around at 12.5&amp;nbsp;km, returning to the start, and then doing another lap of the same course along the river.

'''Super Bowl LVI''', the 56th [[Super Bowl]] and the 52nd [[AFL–NFL merger|modern-era]] [[National Football League]] (NFL) championship game, will decide the league champion for the 2021 season. The game is scheduled to be played on February 6, 2022 at [[Los Angeles Stadium at Hollywood Park]] in [[Inglewood, California]] (with the exact date pending potential changes to the NFL calendar). It will be the eighth Super Bowl hosted by the [[Greater Los Angeles Area]], with the last one being [[Super Bowl XXVII]] in 1993, held at the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]], and the first in the [[Inglewood, California| City of Inglewood]]. The game will be televised nationally by [[NFL on CBS|CBS]].

With Super Bowl LVI scheduled to be held on February 6, 2022, the game overlaps with the [[2022 Winter Olympics]], which will be held in [[Beijing]], [[China]].

==Host-selection process==

In contrast to previous Super Bowl bidding processes, no bids were accepted for Super Bowl LVI. The bids for [[Super Bowl LIII]], [[Super Bowl LIV]] and [[Super Bowl LV]] were all drawn from the same pool of candidates in a meeting on May 24, 2016. Atlanta, Miami, Los Angeles, and Tampa Bay were the four candidates for the three contests; Atlanta received Super Bowl LIII, Miami received Super Bowl LIV, and Los Angeles (who declined to bid on Super Bowl LIV and was not eligible for Super Bowl LIII) was granted Super Bowl LV.

On May 18, 2017, authorities announced that the stadium opening, originally scheduled for the start of the 2019 season, had been delayed an additional year to 2020. At the league's owners meetings in [[Chicago]] on May 23, 2017, the league re-awarded Super Bowl LV to the lone remaining candidate, Tampa Bay, and awarded Super Bowl LVI to Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Super Bowl LV relocated to Tampa; L.A. will host SB LVI|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000810644/article/super-bowl-lv-relocated-to-tampa-la-to-host-sb-lvi?campaign=fb-nf-sf81243817-sf81243817|work=NFL.com|access-date=May 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Broadcasting ==
Super Bowl LVI will be broadcast by [[NFL on CBS|CBS]], as part of the annual cycle between the three main broadcast television partners of the NFL. For the first time, the Super Bowl will be held on a date that falls within an ongoing [[Olympic Games]], as the [[2022 Winter Olympics]] in [[Beijing]] will begin on the Friday prior to the game. Fellow NFL broadcaster [[NBC Olympic broadcasts|NBC]] holds the broadcast rights to the Olympics; it is expected that viewership of both events will be impacted by their scheduling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2018/03/18/in-2022-super-bowl-and-the-winter-olympics-will-compete-for-viewers/|title=In 2022, Super Bowl and the Winter Olympics will compete for viewers|date=2018-03-18|work=New York Post|access-date=2018-03-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Internet of Garbage''''' is a 2015 [[non-fiction]] book by journalist and lawyer [[Sarah Jeong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/09/inside-googles-internet-justice-league-ai-powered-war-trolls/|title=Inside Google’s Internet Justice League and Its AI-Powered War on Trolls|last=Greenberg|first=Andy|date=2016-09-19|work=[[WIRED]]|access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/sarah-jeong/|title=Sarah Jeong|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It discusses online harassment as a threat to the useful functions of the internet, and argues for new approaches to managing the issue. The book was reissued in 2018 with a new preface by Jeong.

== Publication history ==
In 2015, ''[[Forbes]]'' published ''The Internet of Garbage'' in 2015 as part of their "''Forbes'' Signature Series" of [[e-book]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://the-toast.net/2015/07/23/an-interview-with-sarah-jeong/|title=An Interview with Sarah Jeong, Author of 'The Internet of Garbage'|last=Chung|first=Nicole|authorlink=Nicole Chung|date=2015-07-23|work=The Toast|access-date=2018-08-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2018, ''[[The Verge]]'' reissued a "1.5" version of the book with a new preface by Jeong after she joined the editorial board of ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thecut.com/2018/08/sarah-jeong-the-internet-of-garbage-reissue-the-verge.html|title=Apropos of Nothing, Sarah Jeong’s Book About Harassment Is Getting Reissued|last=Arnold|first=Amanda|date=|work=The Cut|access-date=2018-08-28|publisher=[[New York Magazine]]|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==
The thesis of the book is that most of the internet has always been garbage, which has always threatened to make the internet useless. [[spamming|Spam]] is one such form of garbage, and it has been addressed, imperfectly but manageably, through the use of technology and human curation. [[Online harassment]], especially of women and people of color, has become the newest kind of garbage, and new ways of thinking, new law, and new technologies are needed to manage it.&lt;ref name=Jacobs/&gt;&lt;ref name=ars/&gt;

Written after the concentrated harassment campaigns perpetrated against [[Caroline Criado Perez]] in 2013 and multiple other women in the [[Gamergate controversy]] in 2014, the book deals with issues of [[online harassment]], and especially gender- and race-related harassment, with an emphasis on the physical danger caused by [[doxing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://splinternews.com/erasing-yourself-from-the-internet-is-really-really-ha-1793849640|title=Erasing yourself from the Internet is really, really hard|last=Peterson|first=Latoya|date=2015-07-31|work=[[Splinter News|Splinter]]|access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=van der Nagel |first=Emily |type=PhD |date=2017 |publisher=[[Swinburne University of Technology]] |url=https://researchbank.swinburne.edu.au/file/25cfcac7-82ea-4d9e-8681-d9965e6247d1/1/emily_van_der_nagel_thesis.pdf |title=Social Media Pseudonymity: Affordances, Practices, Disruptions}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="poland"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Haters: Harassment, Abuse, and Violence Online|last=Poland|first=Bailey|publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]]|year=2016|isbn=9781612348728}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|21}} The book describes how harassment makes the internet smaller, and less free for its targets, and seeks to broaden the frontier of [[free speech]] for all internet users.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Croeser|first=Sky|date=October 2016|title=Thinking Beyond ‘Free Speech’ in Responding to Online Harassment|url=https://adanewmedia.org/2016/10/issue10-croeser/|journal=[[Ada: A Journal of Gender, New Media &amp; Technology]]|doi=10.7264/N35Q4TC4|issn=2325-0496}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=techdirt/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://gizmodo.com/fantastic-science-and-tech-books-that-will-reboot-your-1725514076|title=Fantastic Science and Tech Books that Will Reboot Your Brain for Fall|last1=Stone|first1=Maddie|date=September 1, 2015|work=[[Gizmodo]]|accessdate=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other subjects covered include the effects of online visibility on social reputation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/18/the-social-web-and-the-digital-panopticon/|title=The Social Web And The Digital Panopticon|last=Chu|first=Arthur|date=2015-10-18|work=[[TechCrunch]]|access-date=2018-08-06|author-link=Arthur Chu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/spam-whats-yours-is-mine-book-reviews-the-loss-of-internet-innocence/|title=Spam &amp; What's Yours Is Mine, book reviews: The loss of internet innocence|last=Grossman|first=Wendy M|date=2015-12-03|work=[[ZDNet]]|access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vasquez|first=Tina|date=Winter 2016|title=The Internet of Garbage (Sarah Jeong)|journal=[[Bitch (magazine)|Bitch]]|volume=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Writing from a legal and policy perspective, Jeong describes how the regulations applied to the internet, such as the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]] and the [[Communications Decency Act]], have been based in [[copyright]] law and are focused on taking down problematic content after it has been posted, and were designed to protect corporate interests. She describes how this has made user-generated [[social media]] much more viable than it could otherwise have been, but on the other hand, it has left platforms without a framework or legal motivation to address hate speech, harassment, and propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Shelagh|date=2018|title=Book Review: Haters: Harassment, Abuse and Violence Online|url=http://vc.bridgew.edu/jiws/vol19/iss2/18/|journal=International Journal of Women's Studies|volume=19|pages=261&amp;ndash;263}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hwang |first=Tim |title=Digital Disinformation: A Primer |publisher=[[Atlantic Council]] |year=2017 |url=http://www.kas.de/wf/doc/kas_50251-1522-2-30.pdf?171005213027}}&lt;/ref&gt; The books suggests other approaches to dealing with harassment, more akin to the way that spam is filtered.&lt;ref name=poland/&gt;{{rp|202}}&lt;ref name=ars&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/06/what-if-we-treated-online-harassment-the-same-way-we-treat-spam/|title=What if we treated online harassment the same way we treat spam?|work=[[Ars Technica]]|access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [['Ndrangheta]], a criminal organization from [[Calabria]] ([[Italy]]) has been involved in [[radioactive waste]] dumping since the 1980s. Ships with toxic and radioactive waste were sunk off the Italian coast. In addition, vessels were allegedly sent to [[Somalia]] and other developing countries with toxic waste, including radioactive waste cargoes, which were either sunk with the ship or buried on land. The introduction of more rigorous environmental legislation in the 1980s made illegal waste dumping a lucrative business for [[Organized crime in Italy|organized crime groups in Italy]].&lt;ref name=tel160909&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/6198228/Mafia-accused-of-sinking-ship-full-of-radioactive-waste-off-Italy.html Mafia accused of sinking ship full of radioactive waste off Italy], by Nick Squires, The Telegraph, September 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1995 parliamentary waste commission report spoke of the "possible existence of national and international trafficking in radioactive waste, managed by business and criminal lobbies, which are believed to operate also with the approval of institutional subjects belonging to countries and governments of the [[European Union]] and outside the EU." Its conclusions noted "interferences and threats" against investigators, and were critical of [[ENEA (Italy)|ENEA]], Italy's state energy research agency, and their management of nuclear waste.&lt;ref name=ft211009/&gt;

==Waste dumping off Italian coast==
The [['Ndrangheta]], an [[Italy|Italian]] mafia-type syndicate, has been accused by [[pentito]] [[Francesco Fonti]], a former member of 'Ndrangheta, of sinking at least 30 ships loaded with toxic waste, much of it radioactive. In 2005, Fonti revealed the conspiracy in the news magazine ''[[L'espresso]]''. His statements led to widespread investigations into the radioactive waste disposal rackets, involving [[Giorgio Comerio]] and his disposal company, the Odm (Oceanic Disposal Management).&lt;ref name=esp050805&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.archivio900.it/it/articoli/art.aspx?r=relauto&amp;id=5978 Parla un boss: Così lo Stato pagava la 'ndrangheta per smaltire i rifiuti tossici], by Riccardo Bocca, L’Espresso, August 5, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Legambiente]], an Italian [[NGO]] for the protection of the environment, provided the public prosecutor’s office with all the data collected by Legambiente since 1994 concerning the disappearance of at least 40 ships in [[Mediterranean]] waters.&lt;ref name=rep140909&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.repubblica.it/2009/09/sezioni/cronaca/nave-veleni/cimitero-navi/cimitero-navi.html Dal plutonio alle polveri di marmo il "cimitero" delle navi radioattive], La Repubblica, September 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Over two decades, Italian prosecutors have looked into more than 30 suspicious deep-water sinkings. They suspect that Italian and foreign industrialists have acted in league with the 'Ndrangheta, and possibly government agencies, to use the Mediterranean as a dumping ground. Vessels that sank in fair weather had suspicious cargo, sent no mayday or the crew vanished.&lt;ref name=ft211009&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/aab01ac6-bda3-11de-9f6a-00144feab49a.html#axzz1DgKhhsM6 Italian police close in on 'toxic' shipwreck], The Financial Times, October 21 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Fonti, a manager of ENEA paid the clan to get rid of 600 drums of toxic and radioactive waste from Italy, Switzerland, France, Germany, and the US, with [[Somalia]] as the destination, where the waste was buried after buying off local politicians. Former employees of ENEA are suspected of paying the criminals to take waste off their hands in the 1980s and 1990s. Shipments to Somalia continued into the 1990s, while the 'Ndrangheta clan also blew up shiploads of waste, including radioactive hospital waste, and sending them to the sea bed off the Calabrian coast.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/oct/09/italy.nuclearpower From cocaine to plutonium: mafia clan accused of trafficking nuclear waste], The Guardian, October 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Fonti personally sank three ships and identified a wreck located 28 kilometres off the coast of [[Cetraro]], in [[Calabria]], by environmental workers as MV ''Cunsky'' and says he sank it himself in 1992, complete with 120 barrels of toxic and radioactive waste. He said 'Ndrangheta received [[Pound sterling|£]]100,000 for the job.&lt;ref name=tel160909/&gt;&lt;ref name=afp140909&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20090914/sc_afp/italycrimemafiaenvironment_20090914212821 Mafia sank boat with radioactive waste: official] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929040749/http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20090914/sc_afp/italycrimemafiaenvironment_20090914212821 |date=2009-09-29 }}, AFP, September 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gua160909&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/16/shipwreck-waste-mafia-italy Shipwreck may hold radioactive waste sunk by mafia off Italian coast], by John Hooper, The Guardian, September 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Fonti had been put on the job by his boss [[Sebastiano Romeo]] of the 'Ndrangheta clan from [[San Luca]] in collaboration with [[Giuseppe Giorgi]]. Another 'Ndrangheta boss involved was [[Natale Iamonte]] who sank ships near [[Melito di Porto Salvo]].&lt;ref name=esp170909&gt;{{it icon}} [http://espresso.repubblica.it/dettaglio/politici-e-007-dietro-le-navi-dei-veleni/2109748 Complotto sotto il mare], by Riccardo Bocca, L’Espresso, September 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the vessel they surveyed off Cetraro in deep waters off the coast of Calabria turned out to be a passenger steamship sunk by a German submarine in 1917. Consequently, one of the prosecutors questioned the reliability of Fonti on the alleged sinkings, although his collaboration with the authorities since 1994 had resulted in high-profile arrests of 'Ndrangheta members involved in drug trafficking.&lt;ref name=ft301009&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ffbac692-c573-11de-8193-00144feab49a.html 'Toxic' shipwreck turns out to be red herring], Financial Times, October 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alleged delivery of toxic waste to Somalia==
Both Fonti and environmental group Legambiente claimed vessels were sent to [[Somalia]] and other developing countries such as [[Kenya]] and [[Zaire]] with toxic cargoes, which were either sunk with the ship or buried on land. Legambiente alleges that local rebel groups were given weapons in exchange for receiving the waste ships. Fonti claims that Italian TV journalist [[Ilaria Alpi]] and her cameraman [[Miran Hrovatin]] were murdered in 1994 in Somalia because they had seen toxic waste arrive in [[Bosaso]], Somalia.&lt;ref name=gua160909/&gt;

According to Fonti, [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrat]] politicians, including former prime minister [[Ciriaco De Mita]], had been involved in illegal disposal operations, using the secret service [[SISMI]] to cover up their connection. De Mita denied the allegations.&lt;ref name=esp170909/&gt; Fonti also claimed that [[Italian Socialist Party|Socialist]] politicians [[Gianni De Michelis]] and [[Bettino Craxi]] intervened to ensure that Italian peacekeeping troops in Somalia turned a blind eye to the transports.&lt;ref name=her200909&gt;[http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/world-news/establishment-hit-by-fresh-accusations-in-toxic-waste-scandal-1.920980 Establishment hit by fresh accusations in toxic waste scandal], by Phillip Willan, The Herald, September 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The huge waves which battered northern Somalia after the [[2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]] were initially believed to have stirred up illegally dumped toxic and [[nuclear waste]]. There are also heavy metals such as lead, cadmium and mercury. The waves broke up rusting barrels and other containers and hazardous waste dumped along the long, remote shoreline in the war-racked country during the early 1990s, according to the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP).&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4312553.stm Waves 'brought waste to Somalia'], BBC News, March 2, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=unep&gt;[http://postconflict.unep.ch/publications/dmb_tsunami.pdf After the Tsunami. Rapid Environmental Assessment]{{dead|date=January 2016}}, United Nations Environment Programme&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a United Nations technical fact-finding mission in 2005 did not find any traces of toxic waste along the shorelines after the tsunami.&lt;ref name=xin081005&gt;[http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/264998/un_probe_team_finds_no_toxic_waste_along_coastal_somalia/ UN Probe Team Finds No Toxic Waste Along Coastal Somalia], Xinhua, October 8, 2005{{deadlink|date= July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the Somali NGO Daryeel Bulsho Guud, with access to the different warring clans, conducted a survey and identified 15 containers of "confirmed nuclear and chemical wastes" in eight coastal areas. A source with the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP) described the search for hazardous material in Somalia as "like looking for a needle in a haystack. It’s not that they don’t know it’s there ... but that they don’t know where to start looking for it."&lt;ref name=eco0309&gt;[http://www.theecologist.org/News/news_analysis/268581/somalia_used_as_toxic_dumping_ground.html Somalia used as toxic dumping ground], The Ecologist, March, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The trial of the Union for the Liberation of Ukraine''' ({{lang-ua|Процес Спілки Визволення України}} {{lang|uk|(СВУ)}}; {{transl|uk|''Protses Spilky Vyzvolennia Ukrayiny''}} {{transl|uk|''(SVU)''}}) was a court trial considered one of the [[show trial]]s in the [[Soviet Union]]. 

The event took place in the Opera Theatre in [[Kharkiv]] (at that time the Ukrainian State Central Opera) from March 9 to April 19, 1930. Forty-five Ukrainian intellectuals, theologians, writers, and a librarian were accused of ''anti-state'' activities (or counter-revolutionary activities for some). Fifteen of the defendants worked in the organization of the All-Ukrainian Academy of Science. About thirty of them were members of former Ukrainian political parties. One was a former prime-minister while two others were ministers of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]]. Finally, six were members of the [[Central Rada]]. Amongst those 45 defendants, two were of Jewish background and three were female. 

According to the [[Museum of Soviet Occupation, Kiev|Museum of Soviet Occupation]], this proceeding became a sort of political slogan to persecute Ukraine's older and foremost academical [[intelligentsia]], as well as representatives of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church (UAOC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://memorial.kiev.ua/expo/1924_4.html Article about the process in the Museum of the Soviet Occupation]&lt;/ref&gt; According to one of the defendants, the Senior attorney of the secret department of Kiev okrug department of GPU Solomon Bruk was repeating during the interrogations: "We must put the Ukrainian intelligentsia on its knees, it is our duty and it will be executed; those whom we would not be able [to subdue], we're going to shoot!" Soon after that, 700 other people were arrested in connection with the process. The total number is not known, but up to 30 thousand people are estimated to have been arrested, exiled, and/or executed during and after the trial.

==Accusations==

According to Soviet sources, the SVU was an underground organization which supposedly existed in Ukraine from June 1926 to July 1929, when it was exposed by the [[State Political Directorate]]. The SVU allegedly existed in the Ukrainian diaspora (it should not be confused with the Union of Liberation of Ukraine, which operated during World War II abroad). 

According to the indictment, the SVU put the task of liberation of the Ukrainian people in all ethnographic Ukrainian territory and the establishment of an independent Ukrainian Republic, which had to be parliamentary and democratic, with a broad right of citizens to private property. The indictment alleges that the SVU was preparing popular uprisings, in close agreement with leaders of Ukrainian diaspora. In addition, the Union of Ukrainian Youth (SUM) was to organize terrorist acts against the Soviet Union, and Soviet Ukrainian leaders.

==List of the accused==
Among others in the dock were:

* [[Serhiy Yefremov]], an academician of the [[Ukrainian National Academy of Sciences]], former deputy chairman of the [[Central Rada]], and a member [[Ukrainian Party of Socialists-Federalists|UPSF]].
* [[Volodymyr Chekhivsky]], former member of the Central Committee of [[Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party|USDRP]], the Prime Minister of [[Ukrainian People's Republic|Ukraine]], theologian, founder and administrator of the UAOC.
* V. Durdukivsky, a teacher, former member of [[Ukrainian Party of Socialists-Federalists|UPSF]].
* Yosyp Germaize, a historian, professor of Kiev Institute of People's Education, former member USDRP.
* Andriy Nikovsky, a literary critic and writer, former member UPSF, and Foreign Minister UPR.
* Liudmyla Starytska-Chernyakhivska, a writer (former member UPSF) and a wife of the renowned scientist histology and  the professor of the Kiev Medical Institute, Oleksandr Chernyakhivsky.
* Mykhailo Slabchenko, academician, historian, professor of the Odessa Institute of People's Education, former member USDRP.
* A. Hrebenetsky, teacher.
* Vsevolod Hantsov, philologist, the former member UPSF.
* H. Holoskevych, linguist, the associate of the [[Ukrainian National Academy of Sciences]].
* Mykola Pavlushkov, student of the Kiev Institute of People's Education, which Soviet authorities considered the founder of the Ukrainian Youth Association (CYM).

The Chairman of the Ukrainian Supreme Court who heard the case was [[Anton Prykhodko]], the chief prosecutor M. Mykhailyk (Attorney-General of the Republic and Deputy [[Narkom]]). Among the public prosecutors were [[Panas Lyubchenko]], academician A. Sokolovsky, writer O. Slisarenko. 

On the side of the defendants were Ratner, Vilensky, Puhtynsky. 

Among the defendants were three females: Liudmyla Starytska-Chernyakhivska, Liudmyla Bidnova, A. Tokarivska; two doctors - members UNAS, 15 professors of higher schools, two students, a director of a middle school, 10 teachers, a theologian and a priest of UAOC, three writers, five editors, two cooperators, two lawyers and a librarian; 15 defendants were employees of UNAS. Many defendants were united through political activities during the struggle for freedom (1917–1920): 31 of them were once members of the Ukrainian political parties (15 - UPSF, 12 - USDRP, 4 - UPSR), one was a prime minister, two - Ministers of the Ukrainian government, six - members of the Ukrainian [[Central Rada]]. According to the indictment act, 33 of the accused belonged to the [[Kiev]] group of SVU, three represented [[Dnipropetrovsk]] and [[Odessa]], two - [[Poltava]] and [[Mykolaiv]], and a single representation was from [[Chernihiv]] and [[Vinnytsia]]. Among the defendants were two Ukrainians of Jewish ethnicity: a historian Yosyp Germaize and a lawyer Morhulis.

==Process and verdict==

The process had numerous inconsistencies. Leaders of the Ukrainian emigration strongly denied prosecutors' allegations that the emigration gave instructions to SVU. In particular, L. Chykalenko denied that he ever sent a letter of instruction to Yefremov.  The existence of such a letter was also denied by J. Hermayze.  N. Pavlushkova (sister of the defendant) argues that "SVU as an organization was the centre for a very narrow circle of people, not more than 12 - 15, without a strong organized periphery" and it recognized that the confessions at the trial of the defendants was forced.

Despite the Soviet SVU publicity process, the sentence was considered too moderate. According to K. Turkalo, one of the defendants, the prosecutor threatened 13 of the defendants with the Highest Degree of Penalty (death penalty), but did not demand it. 45 defendants were sentenced to 10 years ofimprisonment in strict isolation, 6 to 8 years, 3 to 6 years, 10 to 5 years, 21 to 3 years and 1 to 2 years, 10 received a suspended sentence and were immediately released. 5 more were pardoned in a few months. Some prisoners had been sent to the [[Solovetsky Islands]]. In the 1930s and during the first months of World War II, many participants of the SVU were again arrested and disappeared. Most of the accused died in prison or in exile, only a few emigrated (K. Turkalo), and some were rehabilitated after World War II (V. Hantsov, V. Atamanovskyy).

In modern Ukrainian opinion, the dominant thought is that SVU and SUM did not exist as organizations, and were provocations of the GPU (V. Holubnychyy, V. Hryshko, M. Kowalewsky, G. Kostyuk, Yu. Lavrinenko, R. Sallivant, K. Turkalo, P. Fedak), however some sources recognize the existence of SVU (N. Pavlushkova, W. Ivy). 

The hypothesis that SVU - SUM was a fictitious organization of the GPU is supported by the existence of other show trials ([[Shakhty Trial|Shakhty process]] in 1928 or the so-called [[Prompartiya|Prompartia]] (Industrial Party) in December 1930), which were purely political. 

It is more probable that the defendants in the SVU process were Ukrainian patriots, who actively worked for the Ukrainian national cultural renaissance in the 1920s, but they did so spontaneously, without creating any anti-Soviet political organization, with no directive from the Ukrainian emigration.

'''United Nations Security Council resolution 552''', adopted on 1 June 1984, after hearing complaints from [[Bahrain]], Kuwait, [[Oman]], Qatar, [[Saudi Arabia]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]] regarding attacks on their ships by [[Iran]], the Council condemned the attacks, reiterating that Member States should refrain from using threats or use of force in their [[international relations]].

The Council then called on all States to respect free navigation in [[international waters]] in accordance with [[international law]], calling for respect for the territorial integrity for States that were not part of the conflict between [[Iran]] and [[Iraq]]. The resolution demanded Iran cease the attacks on the commercial ships to and from the ports of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.

Resolution 552 concluded by stating that if the present resolution was not implemented, it would meet again to discuss further action it could take on the matter. It also requested the Secretary-General [[Javier Pérez de Cuéllar]] to report on the progress of the implementation of Resolution 552.

The resolution was adopted by 13 votes to none, with two [[abstention]]s from [[Nicaragua]] and [[Zimbabwe]].

Though Resolution 552 condemned Iran for attacks on ships, Iraq had also attacked an unspecified number beforehand, which led to claims of one-sidedness by Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ramazani|first=Rouhollah K.|title=Revolutionary Iran: challenge and response in the Middle East|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|date=1986|page=106|isbn=978-0-8018-3377-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the days following the adoption of this resolution, two Saudi Arabian [[F-15 Eagle|F-15s]] shot down two Iranian [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4 Phantoms]] over Saudi Arabian airspace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hume|first=Cameron R.|title=The United Nations, Iran, and Iraq: how peacemaking changed|publisher=Indiana University Press|date=1994|page=74|isbn=978-0-253-32874-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
