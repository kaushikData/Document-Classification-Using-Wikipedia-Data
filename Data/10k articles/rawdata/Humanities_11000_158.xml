The '''2007 Morocco–Spain diplomatic conflict''' was a short lived disturbance of [[Morocco–Spain relations|international relations between Morocco and Spain]] that arose after the announcement of the impending visit of the [[King of Spain]] to the Spanish-ruled  autonomous cities [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]], which are claimed by Morocco.

The dispute formally began when the [[Government of Morocco]] recalled its ambassador to Spain, Omar Azziman. According to a diplomatic note from the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Morocco]], "The official announcement on Friday of the unfortunate visit of His Majesty [[King Juan Carlos I]], on 5 and 6 November to the two occupied cities of Ceuta and Melilla is a regrettable initiative, whatever are the motives and objectives."&lt;ref name="elpais1"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Marruecos/expresa/rechazo/viaje/Reyes/Ceuta/Melilla/elpepuesp/20071102elpepinac_16/Tes|title= Marruecos expresa su rechazo al viaje de los Reyes a Ceuta y Melilla|first= Ignacio|last= Cembrero|date= November 2, 2007|publisher= [[El País]]|location= Madrid|language= Spanish|trans-title=Morocco expresses its rejection of the King's trip to Ceuta and Melilla|accessdate= December 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="elpais2"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Marruecos/llama/consultas/embajador/Espana/elpepuesp/20071102elpepunac_12/Tes|title= Marruecos llama a consultas a su embajador en España|date= November 2, 2007|publisher= [[El País]]|language= Spanish|trans-title=Morocco calls its ambassador in Spain|accessdate= December 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After reporting of calls of queries from the Ambassador, the Chief Moroccan Government Spokesperson said,"The ball is in the countryside of Spain and we hope that that country takes into consideration the sentiments of the Moroccan people and the interest of bilateral ties and cooperation."&lt;ref name="elpais2"/&gt;

The royal visit occurred in the days set, registering an influx of thousands of citizens, who cheered the Kings in both Ceuta and Melilla.&lt;ref name="kingatceuta"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/301030/0/ceuties/reciben/reyes/|title= Veinticinco mil personas recibieron en Ceuta a Don Juan Carlos y a Doña Sofía|date= November 5, 2007|publisher= [[20 minutos]]|language= Spanish|trans-title=Twenty thousand people to receive Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia in Ceuta|accessdate= December 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kingatmelilla"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lne.es/secciones/noticia.jsp?pRef=1814_43_574968__Espana-Juan-Carlos-destaca-Melilla-sincera-amistad-vecinos|title= Don Juan Carlos destaca en Melilla "la sincera amistad de España con sus vecinos"|date= November 7, 2007|publisher= [[La Nueva España]]|location= Melilla|language= Spanish|trans-title=Don Juan Carlos highlighted at Melilla "the sincere friendship of Spain with its neighbors"|accessdate= December 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During those days continued statements against the visit were made by the Moroccan authorities. In this regard, the Prime Minister of Morocco, [[Abbas El Fassi]], compared the situation in both cities with the [[Israeli occupation of Palestine|Israeli occupation of Palestinian Territories]] and [[King Mohammed VI]] himself described the visit as an "outdated and nostalgic act of a dark era."&lt;ref name="israel"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Marruecos/equipara/Ceuta/Melilla/Palestina/ocupada/Israel/elpepuesp/20071106elpepinac_5/Tes|title= Marruecos equipara Ceuta y Melilla con la Palestina ocupada por Israel|first= Ignacio|last= Cembrero|date= November 6, 2007|publisher= [[El País]]|language= Spanish|trans-title=Morocco equates Ceuta and Melilla with Israel occupied Palestine|accessdate= December 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="condemnation"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Mohamed/VI/condena/visita/real/advierte/Espana/consecuencias/elpepuesp/20071107elpepinac_2/Tes|title= Mohamed VI condena la visita real y advierte a España de las consecuencias|first= Ignacio|last= Cembrero|date= November 7, 2007|publisher= [[El País]]|language= Spanish|trans-title=Mohamed VI condemned the royal visit of Spain and warned the consequences|accessdate= December 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish government, just before the visit, and after the reporting of the Moroccan opposition, told through the Deputy Prime Minister [[Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega]] that the visit of the King of Spain was an act of 'institutional normality."&lt;ref name="elpais1"/&gt; Days later, at the initiative of certain groups in Morocco, some hundreds of people carried out protests in [[Tetuan]], as well as front of the border with Ceuta and Melilla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Cientos/personas/reivindican/Tetuan/marroquinidad/Ceuta/Melilla/elpepuesp/20071104elpepunac_2/Tes|title= Cientos de personas reivindican en Tetuán la "marroquinidad" de Ceuta y Melilla|date= November 4, 2007|publisher= [[El País]]|language= Spanish|trans-title=Hundreds of people claim the "Moroccanness" of Ceuta and Melilla in Tetuan|accessdate= December 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moroccan authority also discontinued high-level visits of Spanish authorities to their country.

Finally, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Spain, [[Miguel Angel Moratinos]], visited [[Rabat]] to meet his Moroccan counterpart, [[Taib Fassi Fihri]] on January 3, 2008, and presented him a personal letter from Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero to King Mohamed VI, which advocated for closer relations between both countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Moratinos/entrega/Marruecos/carta/Zapatero/dara/pie/vuelta/embajador/elpepuesp/20080103elpepunac_1/Tes|title= Moratinos entrega a Marruecos una carta de Zapatero que dará pie a la vuelta del embajador|first= Ignacio|last= Cembrero|date= January 3, 2008|publisher= [[El País]]|language= Spanish|trans-title=Moratinos delivered letter of Zapatero to Morocco will trigger the return of the ambassador|accessdate= December 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later, the Moroccan Foreign Ministry announced the return of its ambassador to Madrid, thus terminating the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Marruecos/anuncia/regreso/embajador/frio/comunicado/elpepuesp/20080107elpepunac_6/Tes|title= Marruecos anuncia el regreso de su embajador con un frío comunicado|first= Ignacio|last= Cembrero|date= January 7, 2008|publisher= [[El País]]|language= Spanish|trans-title=Morocco announces the return of its ambassador with a cold statement|accessdate= December 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Royal visit==
[[File:Juan Carlos 2004.jpg|thumb|200px|Juan Carlos I and Queen Sofia.]]

On October 30, the [[Government of Spain]] announced the visit of King [[Juan Carlos I]] and Queen [[Queen Sofía of Spain|Sofia]] to Ceuta and Melilla from 5 and 6 November. The day before, the Spanish Prime Minister [[Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero]], had told that fact to the opposition leader [[Mariano Rajoy]] during an official ceremony, which Rajoy welcomed.

The King of Spain had not visited Ceuta and Melilla in his reign. The most immediate antecedent of the stay of King Juan Carlos I in these cities dates back to 1970, when he undertook a visit to Ceuta in his capacity as [[Prince of Asturias]] on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the [[Spanish Legion]].

The last visit of a Head of State of Spain to Ceuta and Melilla was by king [[Alfonso XIII]], who was last seen in 1927, and President of the [[Second Spanish Republic|Second Republic]], [[Niceto Alcala Zamora]], on 4 November 1933.&lt;ref name="elpais6"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Rey/destaca/visita/Ceuta/cumple/compromiso/pendiente/elpepuesp/20071106elpepinac_3/Tes|title= El Rey destaca que su visita a Ceuta cumple un "compromiso pendiente"|first= Tomás|last= Bárbulo|date= November 6, 2007|publisher= [[El País]]|location= Ceuta|language= Spanish|trans-title=The King emphasizes that his visit to Ceuta serves a "pending commitment"|accessdate= December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The king of Spain was scheduled to visit to the autonomous city of Melilla in 1997 on the occasion of the five hundredth anniversary of the founding of the city, but the pressure of the Moroccan authorities led to the cancellation of the visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/299476/0/visita/oficial/reyes/|title= Los Reyes visitarán por primera vez de forma oficial Ceuta y Melilla|date= October 31, 2007|publisher= [[20 minutos]]|language= Spanish|trans-title=The King will officially visit Ceuta and Melilla for the first time|accessdate= December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 5, the King and the Queen of Spain stayed in Ceuta for five hours, where they spoke to the [[Assembly of Ceuta|Assembly]] of the Autonomous City, where the monarch said that he "had an pending commitment to Ceuta". Neither the king nor the Minister of Public Administration who accompanied him, [[Elena Salgado]], or any other Spanish authority made any mention of the situation in Morocco.&lt;ref name="elpais6"/&gt; The King was welcomed by 25,000 people.&lt;ref name="kingatceuta"/&gt;

On November 6, the king came to Melilla, in which the Spanish monarch intervened the [[Assembly of Melilla|Assembly]]. There he acknowledged the loyalty of Melillans to the Crown. He made specific reference to Morocco, but said that "Spain through mutual respect cultivates relations of sincere friendship with its neighbors." The number of people who gathered to welcome the King was estimated at 30,000.&lt;ref name="kingatmelilla"/&gt;

==Additional background of the conflict==
A month before the announcement of the royal visit, the judge of the [[National Court of Spain]], [[Baltasar Garzón]], had opened a file to investigate an alleged genocide of [[Sahrawi people|Sahrawis]] by Morocco, accepting to process the lawsuit filed in 2006 by various associations defending human rights and relatives of prisoners and disappeared Saharawis, which accused 31 senior officials of Moroccan security. Morocco, meanwhile, was accused of siding with the positions of the [[Polisario Front]]. Moroccan spokesman said that "it would be good that Judge Garzon deal a bit of respect for human rights in Tindouf."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lukor.com/not-esp/internacional/0711/01115819.htm|title= Marruecos dice que Garzón debería preocuparse por los DDHH en Tinduf y no por el presunto genocidio saharaui

As stated by [[Yassine Mansouri]], Foreign Secret Service Chief of Morocco, during a stay in [[Mallorca]], the deterioration of relations is also related to the active position of the Spanish Government and local authorities to untie Muslim believers of Ceuta and the [[Ministry of Religious Affairs of Morocco]]; and to bet on movements like the [[Tablig]] (Congregation for the Propagation of Islam) or the [[Muslim Brotherhood]]. Mansouri informed this to [[Alberto Saiz]], Director of National Intelligence of Spain.

The position was due to the wrath of King Mohamed VI, according to Mansouri, he remembered that Moroccan King is the ''Commander of the Faithful'' and many mosques in Ceuta had been attached to the [[Union of Islamic Communities of Spain]] (UCIDE) (36 of 40 Islamic communities of Ceuta). The image of the UCID leader in Ceuta, [[Laarbi Maateis]], is associated with radical Islamist movements by Morocco. For his part, Laarbi Maateis denied any involvement with fundamentalist movements, indicating that no member of Tablig had ever been arrested or identified as a suspect in connection with [[jihadism]]. He also said the prosecution were not understandable "because the Maliki rite is practiced both here and in the rest of Spain and Morocco and no one has tried to change that, especially because it seems to be the best for the city."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://terranoticias.terra.es/provincias/ceuta/articulo/ceuta_espana_marruecos_2113293.htm|title= Maateis recuerda que el rito musulmán malekita se practica 'en Ceuta, en el resto de España y en Marruecos|date= December 11, 2007|publisher= Terra Actualidad|language= Spanish|trans-title=Maateis recalls that Maliki Muslim rites are practiced in Ceuta, in the rest of Spain and in Morocco|accessdate= December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Marruecos/acusa/Espana/echar/musulmanes/ceuties/brazos/integrismo/elpepuesp/20071210elpepinac_9/Tes|title= Marruecos acusa a España de echar a los musulmanes ceutíes en brazos del integrismo|first= Ignacio|last= Cembrero|date= December 10, 2007|publisher= [[El País]]|location= Ceuta|language= Spanish|trans-title=Morocco accuses Spain to drive the Muslims into the arms of fundamentalist Ceuta|accessdate= December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Position of the Moroccan government==
[[File:Mohammed VI of Morocco.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Mohamed VI.]]

The [[Prime Minister of Morocco]], [[Abbas El Fassi]], reported the Moroccan parliament that his government would not spare efforts to regain the two cities (Ceuta and Melilla). The next day, November 1, Abbas el Fassi asked the King of Spain to "waive" the trip, while the Minister and Speaker of the Moroccan government, [[Khalid Naciri]], expressed the "total rejection and condemnation" of the royal visit to "despoiled Moroccan cities." Abbas el Fassi, however, at the time said the Spanish press that there was no coercion and that the conflict "must be approached with intelligence, mutual respect, dialogue and concertation."&lt;ref name="elpais1"/&gt;

On November 5, while King Juan Carlos I was visiting Ceuta, Abbas el Fassi compared the situation of Ceuta and Melilla to the Israeli occupation of Palestine during a special session of the Moroccan Parliament to discuss the issue.

{{Quote|Decolonization continues to be topical in the few spots that remain in the world, including occupied Palestine, the cities of Ceuta and Melilla ....}}

The same opinion was pronounced by the leader of the Moroccan Islamist Justice and Development Party, [[Mustafa Ramid]], by manifesting in the Parliament that "the Moroccans living under Spanish colonization are as our fellow Palestinians under Israeli colonization."&lt;ref name="israel"/&gt;

===Manifestations of King Mohamed VI===
On November 6, after holding a Council of Ministers before intervening in the acts of commemoration of the [[Green March]] in the Parliament, Moroccan King Mohamed VI issued a harsh condemnation through a personnel spokesman:&lt;ref name="condemnation"/&gt;
{{quotation|Strongly we express our strong condemnation and as firmly denounce this unprecedented visit. [...] Given this act was to overcome a nostalgic and dark era, the Spanish authorities must assume their responsibility for the consequences that could jeopardize the future and the development of relations between both countries. [...]}}

In the same statement Mohamed VI called for the formal opening of negotiations on the two cities:
{{quotation|It is well established that the best way to resolve conflict and manage this land requires respect for the virtues of an honest dialogue, frank and open about the future, a dialogue that ensures our right to sovereignty and to take into account the interests of Spain. [...] Morocco has continued to demand an end to the Spanish occupation of Ceuta and Melilla and nearby islands in the plundered north of the kingdom.}}

===Reactions of the Moroccan government after the visit of the King===
On 15 November, the government spokesman Khalid Naciri, after a Governing Council, stated that he hoped that the Spanish "place their hand into ours to overcome the crisis and privileging our bilateral relationship. The Spanish-Moroccan relations have undergone a crisis." Do not set a date for the return of the ambassador to Madrid, insist on the need for a dialogue between the parties about the future of the Spanish autonomous cities and it is expected for the future that "our Spanish friends will consider our feelings, our sensitivity and our claims; the purpose is not to create difficulties but to preserve our relations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Marruecos/quiere/Espana/le/coja/mano/superar/juntos/crisis/diplomatica/elpepuesp/20071115elpepunac_11/Tes|title= Marruecos quiere que España "le coja la mano" para superar juntos la crisis diplomática|first= Ignacio|last= Cembrero|date= December 15, 2007|publisher= [[El País]]|location= Madrid|language= Spanish|trans-title=Morocco wants Spain "to hold their hand" to overcome diplomatic crisis together|accessdate= December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 16 November, the Government of Morocco suspended two high-level visits of Spanish authorities:that of the [[Ministry of Public Works and Transport (Spain)|Minister of Public Works]], [[Magdalena Álvarez]], who had planned to deal with the Moroccan Minister of Equipment and Transport [[Karim Ghellab]] about the Gibraltar rail tunnel to link the two countries across the [[Strait of Gibraltar|strait]] (an issue on which both are officially working since 2005 when Tangier was treated evolving the fixed links between Europe and Africa and Chief of Staff of the [[Army of Spain]], Admiral [[Sebastian Zaragoza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/Marruecos/muestra/enfado/cancelando/visita/ministra/Fomento/elpepuint/20071117elpepuint_6/Tes|title= Marruecos muestra su enfado cancelando una visita de la ministra de Fomento|first= Ignacio|last= Cembrero|date= December 17, 2007|publisher= [[El País]]|location= Madrid|language= Spanish|trans-title=Morocco shows its anger by canceling a visit of the Minister of Development|accessdate= December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Position of the Spanish Government==
On the same day, November 1, the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs of Spain]], [[Miguel Angel Moratinos]], who was visiting the Moroccan city of [[Marrakech]], reported orally to the Moroccan Foreign Minister [[Taieb Fassi-Fihri]], despite the manifestations of the Prime Minister, that the King of Spain would visit the cities of Ceuta and Melilla on 5 and 6 November as planned. That same day, in the usual appearance of the Government of Spain after the conclusion of the regular meeting of the Council of Ministers, the Second Deputy Prime Minister [[Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega]] said that relations with the Moroccan government "were extraordinary" and the journey of the Kings fell within the "institutional normality."&lt;ref name="elpais1"/&gt; Foreign Affairs Minister, Moratinos ruled out an action similar withdrawing the ambassador of Spain in [[Rabat]], Spanish diplomatic sources said.&lt;ref name="elpais3"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Mohamed/VI/retira/embajador/pone/relacion/borde/crisis/elpepunac/20071103elpepinac_1/Tes|title= Mohamed VI retira a su embajador y pone la relación al borde de la crisis|first= Ignacio|last= Cembrero|date= December 3, 2007|publisher= [[El País]]|location= Madrid|language= Spanish|trans-title=Mohamed VI withdraws its ambassador and put the relationship on the verge of crisis|accessdate= December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 3, Defense Minister [[Jose Antonio Alonso]], in a statement to the [[Cadena SER]] said that he hoped the gesture of calling the ambassador-step prior to the breakdown of diplomatic relations, he repeated the words said by Deputy Prime Minister the previous day on the normality of the visit.&lt;ref name="elpais4"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Parlamentarios/marroquies/convocan/protesta/Embajada/Espana/lunes/elpepuesp/20071103elpepunac_2/Tes|title= Parlamentarios marroquíes convocan una protesta ante la Embajada de España el lunes|first= Ignacio|last= Cembrero|date= November 3, 2007|publisher= [[El País]]|location= Madrid|language= Spanish|trans-title=Moroccan parliamentarians convened a protest outside the Embassy of Spain on Monday|accessdate= December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Minister of Foreign Affairs expressed on November 14 its confidence in the return of the Moroccan ambassador in Madrid "as soon as possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/ElFinanciero/Portal/cfpages/contentmgr.cfm?docId=90114&amp;docTipo=1&amp;orderby=docid&amp;sortby=ASC|title= Confía Moratinos en rápido fin de la crisis con Marruecos|publisher= El Financiero|language= Spanish|trans-title=Moratinos confident quick end to the crisis with Morocco|accessdate= December 16, 2011|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080612084731/http://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/ElFinanciero/Portal/cfpages/contentmgr.cfm?docId=90114&amp;docTipo=1&amp;orderby=docid&amp;sortby=ASC|archivedate= June 12, 2008|deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political reactions==

===Political reactions in Spain===
The [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] and [[United Left (Spain)|United Left]] political parties, through [[Angel Acebes]] and [[Gaspar Llamazares]], respectively, announced their support for the visit of the King of Spain to Ceuta and Melilla.&lt;ref name="elpais1"/&gt; [[Gustavo de Arístegui]], of the People Party, termed Mohamed VI's reaction as "excessive" and criticized the Spanish Prime Minister for failing to make clear, in his view, the 'red lines' that Morocco could not cross.&lt;ref name="elpais3"/&gt; Meanwhile, [[Elena Valenciano]], International Relations Secretary of the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]], stressed that the visit was part of "the most absolute institutional normality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.europapress.es/00069/20071102152534/marruecos-psoe-cree-desafortunados-algunos-comentarios-rabat-visita-reyes-ceuta-melilla.html|title= PSOE cree desafortunados algunos comentarios de Rabat sobre la visita de los Reyes a Ceuta y Melilla|date= November 2, 2007|publisher= [[Europa Press (news agency)|Europa Press]]|language= Spanish|trans-title=PSOE believes Rabat's certain comments on the visit of the Kings to Ceuta and Melilla as unfortunate|accessdate= December 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''A Short History of the Confederate States of America''''' is a [[memoir]] written by [[Jefferson Davis]], completed shortly before his death in 1889.  Davis wrote most of this book while staying at [[Beauvoir (Biloxi, Mississippi)|Beauvoir]] along the [[Mississippi Gulf Coast]] near [[Biloxi, Mississippi]].

The book is much less a Davis memoir than an articulation of the [[secession]] argument.  In Davis' earlier work, ''[[The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government]]'', he had written what is probably the most thorough exegesis of the [[compact theory]] of the [[United States Constitution]] in existence, devoting the first fifteen chapters of the book to that topic.  Fearful that his readers might not understand, or might forget, he repeated the explanation every second or third chapter after that.&lt;ref&gt;Recent reprints of "Rise and Fall" contain a foreword written by [[James M. McPherson|James McPherson]], the author of ''[[Battle Cry of Freedom (book)|Battle Cry of Freedom]]'', who expresses this view.&lt;/ref&gt;  Still concerned that people might not understand the compact theory of the Constitution, he wrote '''''A Short History of the Confederate States of America''''' shortly before his death.

The book was first published in 1890 by Belford Co. in New York.&lt;ref&gt;Title page: “Published 1890 by Belford Company Publishers 18-22 east 18th St. New York Publishers of Belford's Magazine”.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Zonnewijzerherkenrode.jpg|upright|thumb|Analemmatic sundial on a [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] line in the garden of the [[Herkenrode Abbey]] in [[Hasselt]] ([[Flanders]] in [[Belgium]])]]
[[File:NPTM Photothon - Analemmatic sundial.jpg|upright|thumb|Analemmatic sundial, end of 19th century. Exhibit of the [[National Polytechnical Museum|National Polytechnic Museum]], Sofia]]

'''Analemmatic sundials''' are a type of horizontal [[sundial]] that has a vertical [[gnomon]] and hour markers positioned in an elliptical pattern. The gnomon is not fixed and must change position daily to accurately indicate time of day. Hence there are no hour lines on the dial and the time of day is read only on the ellipse.&lt;ref name="Budd-Sangwin"&gt;[http://pass.maths.org.uk/issue11/features/sundials/index.html "Analemmatic sundials: How to build one and why they work"], C.J. Budd and C.J. Sangwin, maths.org, 1 June 2000&lt;/ref&gt; As with most sundials, analemmatic sundials mark [[solar time]] rather than clock time. An analemmatic sundial is completely defined by&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, (1973) pp. 108-115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rohr 1970, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;
# The size of its ellipse (chosen by the designer).
# The latitude of its location (determines the location of the hour markers on the ellipse).
# The declination of the sun (determines the daily gnomon position).

Analemmatic sundials are sometimes designed with a human as the gnomon. In this case the size of the hour marker ellipse is constrained by human height and the latitude of the sundial location - since the human gnomon shadow must fall on the hour marker ellipse to accurately indicate the time of day.
Human gnomon analemmatic sundials are not practical at lower latitudes where a human shadow is quite short during the summer months. A 66 inch tall person casts a 4-inch shadow at 27 deg latitude on the [[summer solstice]].&lt;ref name="Budd-Sangwin" /&gt;

The use of the adjective "analemmatic" to describe this class of sundial can be misleading, because there is no use of the [[equation of time]] or the [[analemma]] in the design of an analemmatic sundial. Mayall refers to the analemmatic sundial as "the so-called Analemmatic Dial", implying a lack of connection to the analemma.&lt;ref&gt;Mayall 1994, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; The dial of Brou in front of the church of Brou in Bourg-en-Bresse, France is an example of the erroneous use of the analemma in the construction of an analemmatic sundial.  Rohr states "The gnomon is displaced on the short axis of the ellipse and not on the meridian, whose presence here in the shape of an 8 is a mistake."&lt;ref&gt;Rohr 1970, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
[[Image:Analemmatic_sundial.png|300px|right|thumb|Horizontal analemmatic sundial for 44°29' N drawn with ''Shadows Expert'' software. It shows local time]]
An analemmatic sundial uses a vertical gnomon and its hour lines are the vertical projection of the hour lines of a circular equatorial sundial onto a flat plane.&lt;ref&gt;Rohr (1965), pp. 100&amp;ndash;106; Waugh (1973), pp. 108–115; Mayall and Mayall, p. 60–61, 186–190.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the analemmatic sundial is an [[ellipse]], where the short axis is aligned North-South and the long axis is aligned East-West. The noon hour line points true North, whereas the hour lines for 6am and 6pm point due West and East, respectively; the ratio of the short to long axes equals the [[sine]] sin(Φ) of the local geographical [[latitude]], denoted Φ. All the hour lines converge to a single centre; the angle θ of a given hour line with the noon hour is given by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;
\tan \theta = \frac{\tan (15^{\circ} \times t)}{\sin \phi }
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''t'' is the time (in hours) before or after noon.&lt;ref&gt;Rohr (1965), p. 106; Waugh (1973), p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, the vertical gnomon does not always stand at the centre of the hour lines; rather, to show the correct time, the gnomon must be moved daily northwards from the centre by the distance

:&lt;math&gt;
Y = W \cos \phi \tan \delta \,
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''W'' is half the width of the ellipse and δ is the Sun's [[declination]] at that time of year.&lt;ref&gt;Rohr (1965), pp. 103, 111; Waugh (1973), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; The declination measures how far the sun is above the [[celestial equator]]; at the [[equinox]]es, δ=0 whereas it equals roughly ±23.5° at the summer and winter [[solstice]]s.

The '''Arts &amp; Entertainment District''', or previously known as '''Omni''', is a neighborhood of greater [[Downtown Miami|Downtown]], [[Miami]], [[Florida]], [[United States]], just south of [[Edgewater (Miami)|Edgewater]]. It is bound roughly by North 19th Street to the north, North 10th Street to the south, North East 2nd Avenue to the west, and Biscayne Boulevard to the east.&lt;ref&gt;http://aedistrictmiami.com/map/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arts &amp; Entertainment District is an urban, residential neighborhood with many high-rise residential towers, as well as some smaller scale historic buildings. It is home to the [[Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts]], the old ''[[Miami Herald]]'' headquarters (now located in [[Doral, Florida]]), and the [[Omni International Mall]].  Until 2014 it was one of the neighborhoods that hosted the annual [[Miami International Boat Show]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://seaislemarina.com/boat-show/]{{dead link|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Sea Isle Marina]]. The [[City of Miami Cemetery]], one of Miami's oldest cemeteries, is also located in the district, as well as the historic [[Miami Women's Club|Women's Club]], and some of Miami's oldest churches and synagogues.

The Arts &amp; Entertainment District is served by the Omni Loop branch of the [[Metromover]] and by the [[Metrorail (Miami)|Metrorail]] via Metromover at [[Government Center (MDT station)|Government Center]].

==History==
From the 1920s to the 1950s, the Omni area was a high-end shopping area with many major department stores along [[Biscayne Boulevard]], such as [[Sears, Roebuck and Company]] (whose tower still stands at the [[Arsht Center]]), [[Jordan Marsh]] (NE 15th Street and Biscayne Blvd) built in 1956, and a [[Burdines]] (NE 14th Street and Biscayne Blvd).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbase.com/donboyd/image/95013898|title=Late 1950's - east end of Jordan Marsh on NE 15th Street looking west toward Biscayne Boulevard by Don Boyd|author=|date=|website=PBase|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1930, this area of [[Biscayne Boulevard]] was the home of [[Sears, Roebuck and Company Department Store (Miami, Florida)|Sears (later Burdines) Store]], and the [[Shrine Building (Miami, Florida)|Shrine Building]] (which still stands at NE 14th Street and Biscayne  Blvd), all of which were designed and built by the Biscayne Boulevard Company in the [[Art Deco]] [[architectural style]]. The area from NE 13th to NE 16th Street was envisioned as a high-end shopping district.  By 1930, early tenants in the Shrine Building included the [[Piggly-Wiggly|Piggly-Wiggly grocery store]], Biscayne-Page Electric Company, and the John Turner Piano Store on the first floor. Other tenants in 1930 were the Home Drug Store and the Burroughs Adding Machine Company.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historicpreservationmiami.com/pdfs/Shrine Building.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, the [[Omni International Mall]] opened replacing much of the street-side stores with a suburban-style [[shopping mall]]. The mall brought many upscale stores to the Omni such as [[Emilio Pucci]], [[Givenchy]] and [[Hermes]]. By the 1990s, however, the mall began to falter, and in 1991, [[Jordan Marsh]] closed, and in 1998, so did [[JC Penney]]. In 2000, the mall closed, and the area was reconverted into offices in 2007. Today, it houses a few office tenants and the [[Miami International University of Art and Design]]. It is also the corporate home of the [http://www.miamichamber.com Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce]. The name of the neighborhood today, comes from the name of the Omni Mall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://michaelemilio.com/omni-mall-in-downtown-miami-is-getting-a-real-estate-facelift/]{{dead link|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/1999-12-30/news/the-fall-of-the-mall/|title=The Fall of the Mall|first=Victor|last=Cruz|date=30 December 1999|website=miaminewtimes.com|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2000s, rapid construction of [[high-rise]] residential [[skyscraper]]s has revitalized the neighborhood from [[urban blight]]. The area around Margaret Pace Park has seen large population growth from 2000 to 2010. Omni today has a large residential population, and with continued retail and residential construction in the neighborhood, has grown into its own unique neighborhood in the city.

==Transportation==
[[File:Crowded Metromover.jpg|thumb|right|[[Metromover]] is a popular way of getting around the Downtown area. It connects the area's neighborhoods and can get very busy during [[rush hour]].]]
{{see also|Transportation in Miami}}
[[Metromover]] train system runs three lines throughout Downtown (the Downtown Loop, the Omni Loop, and the Brickell Loop). The Metromover connects with Metrorail and is free. There are two Metromover stations in the district- School Board Station and Adrienne Arsht Center. Transfers can be made to the [[Miami Metrorail|Metrorail]], Miami's [[heavy rail]] system, at [[Government Center (MDT station)|Government Center]], as well as to the Brickell and Inner Metromover loops. Metrorail has stops throughout Miami with connections to [[Miami International Airport]], all Miami-Dade County bus lines, [[Tri-Rail]] and [[Amtrak]]. The main bus station is also located in the district, next to the Arsht Center at the [[Adrienne Arsht Center (Metromover station)|Adrienne Arsht Center]] station.

The Arts &amp; Entertainment District is served by [[Miami Metrobus|Metrobus]] throughout the area, the [[Miami Metrorail]], and the [[Metromover]]:

As an urban and [[pedestrian-friendly]] area with an extensive [[public transit]] network, the Arts &amp; Entertainment District and the greater Downtown area, is one of the areas in Miami where a car-free lifestyle is commonplace. Many residents get around by foot, bicycle, [[Metromover]] or by taxi. The Metromover is a popular alternative to walking in the area, especially on rainy, hot or cold days, as the Metromover is free, and stations are located roughly every two blocks throughout the area.

Recently, the City of Miami, along with the Downtown Development Authority, has begun bicycle initiaves promoting citywide bike parking and [[bike lanes]], that have made bicycling much more popular for residents. [[Bike lanes]] and [[Shared lane marking|bike sharrows]] are currently planned for the majority of Downtown streets to be painted by the end of 2010. The [[Venetian Causeway]] is a popular bicycle commuter route that connects [[South Beach]] to Omni. The [[Rickenbacker Causeway]] is very popular on weekends for recreational bicyclists, and often, bicycles can outnumber cars on the causeway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.transitmiami.com/2010/07/17/do-cyclists-and-pedestrians-outnumber-cars-on-the-rickenbacker-causeway-on-weekend-mornings/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106222951/http://www.transitmiami.com/2010/07/17/do-cyclists-and-pedestrians-outnumber-cars-on-the-rickenbacker-causeway-on-weekend-mornings/ |archivedate=2011-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Black Book of Carmarthen''' (known in Welsh as "'''Llyfr Du Caerfyrddin''") is thought to be the earliest surviving [[manuscript]] written solely in [[Welsh language|Welsh]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Huws of the [[National Library of Wales]] (''Llyfrau Cymraeg 1250–1400'', Aberystwyth 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; The book dates from the mid-13th century; its name comes from its association with the Priory of St. John the Evangelist and [[Teulyddog]] at [[Carmarthen]], and is referred to as black due to the colour of its binding. It is currently part of the collection of the [[National Library of Wales]], where it is catalogued as NLW Peniarth MS 1.

This was one of the collection of manuscripts amassed at the mansion of Hengwrt, near [[Dolgellau]], [[Gwynedd]], by Welsh [[antiquary]] [[Robert Vaughan (antiquary)|Robert Vaughan]] (c.1592–1667); the collection later passed to the newly established [[National Library of Wales]] as the [[Peniarth Manuscripts|Peniarth or Hengwrt-Peniarth Manuscripts]]. It is believed that the manuscript is first recorded when it came into the possession of [[John Prise|Sir John Price of Brecon]] (1502?–1555), whose work was to search the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|monasteries dissolved]] [[List of monasteries dissolved by Henry VIII of England|by Henry VIII]]. It was given to him by the treasurer of [[St David's Cathedral]], having come from Carmarthen Priory. ''Llyfr Du Caerfyrddin'' was described by [[William Forbes Skene]] (1809–92) as one of the [[Four Ancient Books of Wales]].

==Description==
Written before 1250, the manuscript is a small (170 x 125&amp;nbsp;mm; 7 x 5 inches),&lt;ref name=Cambridge2015&gt;{{cite news|title=Ghosts from the Past Brought Back to Life |work=University of Cambridge |date=2015-04-01 |url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/ghosts-from-the-past-brought-back-to-life}}&lt;/ref&gt; incomplete, [[vellum]] [[codex]] of 54 folios (108 pages) in eight [[gathering (bookbinding)|gatherings]]; several folios are missing. Although the product of a single scribe, inconsistency in the ruling of each folio, in the number of lines per folio, and in handwriting size and style, suggest an amateur writing over a long period of time.&lt;ref name="Peniarth MS 1" /&gt; The opening folios, written in a large [[blackletter|textura]] on alternating ruled lines, are followed by folios in a much smaller, cramped script.&lt;ref name="Cambridge2015" /&gt;

===Contents===
[[File:Black Book of Carmarthen (f.29.v).jpg|thumb|Black Book of Carmarthen (f.29.v)]]
The book contains a small group of [[Welsh triads|triads]] about the horses of Welsh heroes, but is chiefly a collection of 9th–12th century poetry falling into various categories: religious and secular subjects, and odes of praise and of mourning. Of greater interest are the poems which draw on traditions relating to the [[Welsh people|Welsh]] heroes associated with the [[Hen Ogledd]] (Old North, i.e. [[Cumbria]] and the surrounding area), and especially those connected with the legend of [[King Arthur|Arthur]] and [[Merlin (wizard)|Myrddin]], also known as Merlin, thus predating the descriptions of Merlin by [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]. One of the poems, ''The Elegy of Gereint son of Erbin'', refers to the "Battle of Llongborth", the location of which can no longer be pinpointed, and mentions Arthur's involvement in the battle.

The poems ''Yr Afallennau'' and ''Yr Oianau'' describe the mad Merlin in a forest talking to an apple tree and a pig, prophesying the success or failure of the Welsh army in [[Norman invasion of Wales|battles with the Normans in South Wales]].

Some of the other poems contained are:
*''Ymddiddan Myrddin a Thaliesin'' (A Conversation Between Merlin and Taliesin)
*''Dadl y Corff a'r Enaid'' (Dialogue between the Body and the Soul)
*''Elegy to [[Madog ap Maredudd]]'' (d. 1160)
*''[[Geraint son of Erbin|The Elegy of Gereint son of Erbin]]''
*''[[Englynion y Beddau|The Verses of the Graves]]''
*''[[Kyntaw geir]]'' (a penitential poem on pilgrimage)

==Recent developments==
There has been a call{{When|date=July 2010}} from the editor of the ''[[Carmarthen Journal]]'' newspaper to house the Black Book in its native Carmarthen, so that it might be seen by locals and tourists coming into the town.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In 2002, it was announced that the Black Book had been scanned, and made available online.&lt;ref name=BBC2002&gt;{{cite news|title=Ancient ‘Black Book’ Goes Online |work=BBC |date=2002-02-22 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/2502845.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 it was suggested an interactive display about the book could be created in Carmarthen's [[St Peter's Church, Carmarthen|St Peter's Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Carmarthen church needs to find £50k to stay open |url=http://www.carmarthenjournal.co.uk/Carmarthen-church-needs-50k-stay-open/story-20964809-detail/story.html |work=Carmarthen Journal |date=16 April 2014 |accessdate=2016-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, [[University of Cambridge]] Professor Paul Russell and Ph.D. student Myriah Williams reported that a variety of imaging techniques such as [[ultraviolet]] lamps and photo-editing software had revealed content that had been invisible under normal viewing conditions. Among the previously unknown material, erased half a millennium ago, were extensive [[Marginalia|marginal annotations]], including an inscription suggesting that the book was gifted by a previous owner to a family member; drawings of a fish and of two human faces; and a previously unattested Welsh poem.&lt;ref name="Cambridge2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent&gt;{{cite news|title=The Black Book of Carmarthen: Scholars left shaken after ultraviolet light reveals ghostly faces staring at them from medieval manuscripts |work=The Independent |date=2015-03-31 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/the-black-book-of-carmarthen-scholars-left-shaken-after-ultraviolet-light-reveals-ghostly-faces-staring-at-them-from-medieval-manuscripts-10147622.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC2015&gt;{{cite news|title=Doodles and Poems Found in Black Book of Carmarthen |work=BBC |date=2015-04-01 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-32133243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bohemian glass''', chiefly referred to as '''Bohemia crystal''', is [[glass]] produced in the regions of [[Bohemia]] and [[Silesia]], now parts of the [[Czech Republic]]. It has a centuries long history of being internationally recognised for its high quality, craftsmanship, beauty and often innovative designs. Hand-cut, engraved, blown and painted decorative glassware ranging from champagne flutes to enormous chandeliers, ornaments, figurines and other glass items are among the best known Czech exports and immensely popular as tourist souvenirs. The Czech Republic is home to numerous glass studios and schools attended by local and foreign students.

Oldest archaeological excavations of glass-making sites date to around 1250 and are located in the [[Lusatian Mountains]] of Northern Bohemia. Most notable Czech sites of glass-making throughout the ages are [[Skalice u České Lípy|Skalice]] ({{lang-de|Langenau}}), [[Jablonec nad Nisou]], [[Železný Brod]], [[Poděbrady]], [[Karlovy Vary]], [[Kamenický Šenov]] ({{lang-de|Steinschönau}}) and [[Nový Bor]] ({{lang-de|Haida}}). Several of these towns have their own glass museums with many items dating since around 1600. Jablonec nad Nisou in particular is famous for the local tradition of manufacturing glass costume jewellery. Its long history is documented by large collections in the Museum of Glass and Jewellery in Jablonec nad Nisou.

==Crystal vs. glass==
The meaning of crystal versus glass changes according to the country. The word "crystal" means, in most of the western world, the presence of [[lead]]. In the [[European Union]], labeling of "crystal" products is regulated by Council Directive 69/493/EEC, which defines four categories, depending on the chemical composition and properties of the material. Only glass products containing at least 24% of lead oxide may be referred to as "lead crystal". Products with less lead oxide, or glass products with other metal oxides used in place of lead oxide, must be labeled "crystallin" or "crystal glass".&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/ALL/;ELX_SESSIONID=l2btJx1QfVjGS26hd7RQHJT2pC6jtyHh219TZXbGQ3pPJZrSf8dP!-2071614142?uri=CELEX:31969L0493&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States it is the opposite - glass is defined as "crystal" if it contains only 1% lead. In the Czech Republic, the term "crystal" is used for any exquisite, high quality glass. Leaded crystal means crystal containing more than 24% lead oxide.

The presence of lead in crystal softens the glass and makes it more accessible for cutting and engraving. Lead increases the weight of the glass and causes the glass to diffract light. Glass can contain up to 40% lead, if maximum hardness is desired. On the other hand, crystal can contain less than 24% lead if it has a high proportion of barium oxide, which ensures high quality light diffraction.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecrystal.cz/en/czech-crystal/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Bohemia]], a part of the Czech Republic (formerly part of [[Czechoslovakia]], formerly part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], originally part of [[Czech Kingdom]] or [[Kingdom of Bohemia]]), became famous for its beautiful and colourful glass during the [[Renaissance]]. The history of Bohemian glass started with the abundant natural resources found in the countryside.

Bohemian glass-workers discovered [[potash]] combined with chalk created a clear colourless glass that was more stable than glass from Italy. In the 16th century the term Bohemian crystal was used for the first time to distinguish its qualities from glass made elsewhere. This glass contained no lead as is commonly suspected. This Czech glass could be cut with a wheel. In addition, resources such as wood for firing the kilns and for burning down to ashes were used to create [[potash]]. There were also copious amounts of [[limestone]] and [[silica]]. In the 17th century, [[Caspar Lehmann]], [[Gemstone|gem]] cutter to [[Emperor Rudolf II]] in [[Prague]], adapted to glass the technique of gem engraving with [[copper]] and [[bronze]] wheels. During the era, the Czech lands became the dominant producer of decorative glassware and the local manufacture of glass earned international reputation in high [[Baroque]] style from 1685 to 1750.

Czech glassware became as prestigious as jewellery and was sought-after by the wealthy and the aristocracy of the time. Czech crystal chandeliers could be found in the palaces of the French king [[Louis XV]], [[Maria Theresa]], Empress of Austria, and  [[Elizabeth of Russia]].

Bohemia turned out expert craftsmen who artfully worked with crystal. Bohemian crystal became famous for its excellent cut and engraving. They became skilled teachers of glass-making in neighbouring and distant countries. By the middle of the 19th century, a technical glass-making school system was created that encouraged traditional and innovative techniques as well as thorough technical preparation.

In the second half of the 19th century, Bohemia looked to the export trade and mass-produced coloured glass that was exported all over the world. Pairs of vases were produced either in a single colour of opaque glass or in two-colour cased glass. These were decorated in thickly enamelled flower subjects that were painted with great speed. Others were decorated with coloured lithographic prints copying famous paintings. These glass objects were made in huge quantities in large factories and were available by mail order throughout Europe and America. Many of them were not fine art but provided inexpensive decorative objects to brighten up ordinary homes. [[Reverse glass painting]] was also a Czech specialty. The image is carefully painted by hand on the back of a pane of glass, using a variety of techniques and materials, after which the painting is mounted in a bevelled wooden frame.

Glass [[artisan]]ship remained at a high level even under the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Communists]] because it was considered ideologically innocuous and it helped promote the good name of the country. Czech glass designers and manufacturers enjoyed international recognition and Czech glassware including art works such as sculptures was displayed and awarded in many international exhibitions, most notably in [[Expo 58]] world fair in [[Brussels]] and in [[Expo 67]] in [[Montréal]].

Today, Czech crystal chandeliers hang, for example, in [[Milan]]'s [[La Scala]], in [[Rome]]'s [[Teatro dell'Opera]], in [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], in the [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[St. Petersburg]] or in the royal palace in [[Riyadh]]. Various sorts of glassware, art glass, ornaments, figurines, costume jewellery, beads and others also remain internationally valued.

One of the glass items for which the Czech nation is still well known is the production of "druk" beads. Druks are small (3mm-18mm) round glass beads with small threading holes produced in a wide variety of colors and finishes and used mainly as spacers among beaded jewellery makers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

A '''Boston accent''' is a [[regional accent|local accent]] of [[Eastern New England English]] native specifically to the city of [[Boston]] and its suburbs. Eastern New England English also traditionally includes New Hampshire, Maine, all of eastern Massachusetts, and arguably Rhode Island, though some uniquely local vocabulary appears only around Boston.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Schneider | first = Edgar |author2=Bernd Kortmann | title = A Handbook of Varieties of English: A Multi-Media Reference Tool | publisher = Mouton de Gruyter | year = 2005 | page = 270 | isbn = 978-3-11-017532-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Millward | first = C.M. | title = A Biography of the English Language | publisher = Wadsworth Publishing | year = 1996 | page = 353 | isbn = 978-0-15-501645-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the characteristics of traditional Boston accents may be retreating, particularly among younger residents. However, linguist [[William Labov]] claims that, in the twenty-first century, there remains a relatively stable Boston accent.&lt;ref name="Labov 2010"&gt;Labov, William (2010).

Boston and surrounding northeastern [[New England]] form the only major region in North America where the [[Phonological history of the low back vowels|distinction between the vowel phonemes]] "broad ''a''" (as in ''father'') and "short ''o''" (as in ''bother'') is often maintained (with some [[New York accent]]s also following this pattern).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvp|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include words like ''father'' and ''spa'' which contain {{IPA|[aː]}} ({{IPA|[ˈfaːðə]}}, {{IPA|[spaː]}}) and ''bother'' and ''dock'' which contain {{IPA|[ɒː]}} ({{IPA|[ˈbɒːðə]}}, {{IPA|[dɒːk]}}) being different. This means that even though ''dark'' has no {{IPA|[ɹ]}} in many Boston accents, it remains distinct from ''dock'' because its vowel quality is different: {{IPA|[daːk]}} vs. {{IPA|[dɒːk]}}. In this way, Bostonians align with most Britons, but unlike most other Americans, who use the same vowel in both of these classes: {{IPA|[ɑː]}}.&lt;ref&gt;Labov et al. 2006 The Atlas of North American English Berlin: DeGruyter&lt;/ref&gt;{{pn|date=July 2018}}

On the other hand, the Boston accent merges the "short ''o''" with the "aw" phoneme: the two classes exemplified by [[Cot–caught merger|''caught'' and ''cot'']] thus both become an often long and rounded {{IPA|[ɒː]}}, so that ''caught'', ''cot'', ''law'', ''wand'', ''rock'', ''talk'', ''doll'', and ''wall'' all are pronounced with the same vowel.&lt;ref&gt;Labov et al. (2006), pp. 60-1.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, New York accents and southern New England accents have {{IPA|[kɔət]}} for ''caught'' and {{IPA|[kät]}} for ''cot'' and the London accents have {{IPA|[kɔːt~koːt]}} and {{IPA|[kɒt~kɔt]}}, respectively.  In Boston and some other parts of New England, a few words ending in {{IPA|/t/}}, e.g., ''hot'' and ''got'', can be pronounced with an entirely different phoneme, however, sounding instead like ''hut'' and ''gut'', respectively.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Eastern New England English has a so-called "[[Æ-tensing|nasal short-''a'' system]]". This means that the "short ''a''" vowel {{IPA|[æ]}} as in ''cat'' and ''rat'' becomes raised to a mid-high front diphthong {{IPA|[eə]}} when it precedes a [[nasal stop|nasal consonant]] (but also, on a continuous scale in some other environments); thus, ''man'' is {{IPA|[meən]}} and ''planet'' is {{IPA|[ˈpleənət]}}. Boston shares this system with some of the Midwest and most of the West, though the raising in Boston tends to be more noticeable and extreme than elsewhere. This system is not shared with London or New York City accents. In addition to raising before nasals, Bostonians (unlike nearby New Hampshirites, for example) also tend to somewhat "raise" or "break" the "short ''a''" sound the most before [[voiceless fricative]]s (followed by [[voiced stop]]s, laterals, voiceless stops, and voiced fricatives), so that words like ''half'', ''bath'', and ''glass'' become {{IPA|[hɛəf]}}, {{IPA|[bɛəθ]}} and {{IPA|[glɛəs]}}, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Jim. (2010). "[https://jimwood8.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/wood-2011-short-a-in-northern-new-england.pdf Short-a in Northern New England]". ''Journal of English Linguistics'' 20:1–31. pp. 146, 149.&lt;/ref&gt; This trend began around the early-mid to mid-twentieth century, replacing the older Boston accent's London-like "broad ''a''" system to an opener {{IPA|[a]}} sound in those same example words (see "Declining characteristics" below).&lt;ref&gt;Wood, 2010, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

Boston accents make a greater variety of distinctions between [[English-language vowel changes before historic r|short and long vowels before medial {{IPA|[ɹ]}}]] than many other modern American accents do: ''hurry'' {{IPA|[ˈhʌɹi]}} and ''furry'' {{IPA|[ˈfɝɹi]}}; and ''mirror'' {{IPA|[ˈmɪɹə]}} and ''nearer'' {{IPA|[ˈniəɹə]}}, though some of these distinctions are somewhat endangered as people under 40 in neighboring New Hampshire and Maine have lost them. Boston shares these distinctions with both New York and Received Pronunciation, but the Midwest, for instance, has lost them entirely.

The nuclei of the diphthongs {{IPA|/aɪ/}} and {{IPA|/aʊ/}} may be raised to something like {{IPA|[ɐ]}} before [[voiceless consonant]]s: thus ''write'' has a higher vowel than ''ride'' and ''lout'' has a higher vowel than ''loud''.  This effect is known usually as (one of the two phenomena of) [[Canadian raising]], though it is less extreme in New England than in most of [[Canadian English|Canada]]. Furthermore, some Boston accents have a tendency to raise the {{IPA|/aʊ/}} diphthong in both voiced and voiceless environments and some Boston accents may raise the {{IPA|/aɪ/}} diphthong in certain voiced environments.

The nuclei of {{IPA|/oʊ/}} and {{IPA|/uː/}} are significantly less fronted than in many American accents. Both have {{IPA|/uː/}} may be diphthongized to approximately {{IPA|[ʊu]}} or {{IPA|[ɵu]}}.

The more  deeply urban varieties of the Boston accent may use the [[dental stop]]s {{IPA|[t̪, d̪]}} to replace the normal English [[dental fricative]]s {{IPA|[θ, ð]}}.

===Non-rhoticity===
The traditional Boston accent is non-rhotic, particularly in the early 1900s. Recent studies have shown that younger speakers use more of a [[rhotic accent]] than older speakers from the Boston region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1009&amp;context=pwpl|title = Bostonians /r/ Speaking: A Quantitative Look at (R) in Boston|last = Irwin|first = Patricia|year = 2007|journal = University of Pennsylvania Working Papers in Linguistics|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Nagy|first2 = Naomi | volume = 13| issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[phoneme]] {{IPA|/r/}} does not appear in [[syllable coda|coda position]] (where in English [[phonotactics]] it must precede other consonants, see [[English phonology#Coda]]), as in most dialects of [[English language in England|English in England]] and [[Australian English|Australia]]; ''card'' therefore becomes {{IPA|[kaːd]}} "cahd". After high and mid-high vowels, the {{IPA|/r/}} is replaced by {{IPA|[ə]}} or another neutral central vowel like {{IPA|[ɨ]}}: ''weird'' {{IPA|[wiɨd]}}, ''square'' {{IPA|[ˈskweə]}}. Similarly, [[lexical stress|unstressed]] {{IPAc-en|ər}} is replaced by {{IPA|[ə]}}, {{IPA|[ɐ]}}, or {{IPA|[ɨ]}}, as in ''color'' {{IPA|[ˈkʌɫə]}}.  A [[shibboleth|famous example]] is "Park the car in Harvard Yard", pronounced {{IPA|[paːk ðə ˈkaːɹ‿ɪn ˈhaːvəd ˈjaːd]}}, or as if spelled "pahk the cah(r) in Hahvud Yahd".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vorhees|first=Mara|title=Boston. Con Pianta. Ediz. Inglese|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a0sQ5UzkiQUC&amp;pg=PA52|year=2009|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74179-178-5|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2015/08/25/blame-harvard-for-this-annoying-boston-accent-test/rvyip8zcAnwNmj1qpHtZqM/story.html|title=Blame Harvard for this annoying Boston accent test|author=Randall, Eric|date=August 25, 2015|work=The Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that the ''r'' in ''car'' would usually be pronounced in this case, because the following word begins with a vowel. The Boston accent possesses both [[linking R|linking R and intrusive R]]: That is to say, an {{IPA|/r/}} will not be lost at the end of a word if the next word begins with a vowel, and indeed an {{IPA|/r/}} will be inserted after a word ending with a central or low vowel if the next word begins with a vowel: ''the tuner is'' and ''the tuna is'' are both {{IPA|[ðə tʰuːnəɹɪz]}}.

===Declining features===
Many characteristics of the Boston accent may be retreating, particularly among some younger residents. In the most "old-fashioned" of Boston accents, there may be a lingering resistance to the [[horse–hoarse merger]], so that what in other dialects {{IPA|/ɔr/}} becomes a low back vowel {{IPA|[ɒ]}}: ''horse'' is {{IPA|[hɒːs]}}, pronounced the same or almost the same as ''hoss'', while the word ''hoarse'' is somewhat different {{IPA|[hoəs]}}. Other words fall into these distinct classes too, like ''for'' vs. ''four'': {{IPA|[fɒː]}} vs. {{IPA|[foə]}}. This distinction is rapidly fading out of currency, as it is in almost all regions of North America that still make it. Regardless, for some Boston speakers, the words ''tot'', ''tort'', and ''taught'' may all be [[homophone]]s.

A feature that Boston speakers once shared with greater London, though now uncommon, is the [[Broad A|"broad ''a''"]] of the {{Sc|BATH}} [[lexical set]] of words, making a distinction from the {{sc|TRAP}} set. In particular words that in other American accents have the "short ''a''" pronounced as {{IPA|[æ]}}, that vowel was replaced in the nineteenth century (if not earlier and often sporadically by speakers as far back as the late eighteenth century)&lt;ref&gt;Wood, 2010, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; with {{IPA|[aː~ɑː]}}: thus, ''half'' as {{IPA|[häːf]}} and ''bath'' as {{IPA|[bäːθ]}}.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=523}} Fewer words have the broad ''a'' in Boston English than in the London accents, and fewer and fewer Boston speakers maintain the broad ''a'' system as time goes on, with its transition into a decline occurring in speakers born from about 1930 to 1950 (and first documented as a decline in 1977).&lt;ref&gt;Wood, 2010, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; Boston speakers born before about 1930 used this broad ''a'' in the words ''after'', ''ask'', ''aunt'', ''bath'', ''calf'', ''can't'', ''glass'', ''half'', ''laugh'', ''pasture'', ''path'', and perhaps other words, and born from about 1930 to 1950 use it only in ''aunt'', ''calf'', ''half'', ''laugh'', and ''pass''. Speakers born since 1950 typically have no broad ''a'' whatsoever and, instead, slight [[æ-tensing|/æ/ raising]] (i.e. {{IPA|[ɛə]}}), for example, in ''craft'', ''bad'', ''math'', etc.){{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=523}} with this same set of words and, variably, other instances of short ''a'' too.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=523}} Only ''aunt'' maintains the broad ''a'' sound in even the youngest speakers, though this one word is a common exception throughout all of the Northeastern U.S.

==In popular culture==
Although not all Boston-area speakers are non-rhotic, [[Rhoticity in English|non-rhoticity]] remains the feature most widely associated with the region. As a result, it is frequently the subject of humor about Boston, as in comedian [[Jon Stewart]] joking in his book ''[[America (The Book)|America]]'' that, although [[John Adams]] drafted the 1780 [[Massachusetts Constitution]], "delegates from his state refused to ratify the letter 'R'."&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, John et al. (2014). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=eSycAAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=onepage&amp;q=%22refused%20to%20ratify%22 The Daily Show with Jon Stewart Presents America (The Book) Teacher's Edition: A Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction]''. Grand Central Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

Being conspicuous and easily identifiable as regional, Boston accents are routinely featured by actors in films set in Boston, particularly for working-class white characters, such as in ''[[Good Will Hunting]]'', ''[[Mystic River (film)|Mystic River]]'', ''[[The Departed]]'', ''[[Manchester by the Sea (film)|Manchester by the Sea]]'', ''[[The Town (2010 film)|The Town]]'', ''[[Ted (film)|Ted]]'', ''[[The Fighter]]'', and ''[[Black Mass (film)|Black Mass]]''.&lt;ref name="Gottlieb"&gt;Gottlieb, Jeremy (2017). ''[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2017/02/03/hollywood-has-a-boston-problem/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.5a738ce30062 Hollywood has a Boston problem]".

Bettah Get the Accent Right]". ''[[NPR]]''. August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Television series based within a Boston setting such as ''[[Boston Public]]'' and ''[[Cheers]]'' have featured the accent. ''[[The Simpsons|Simpsons]]'' character [[Joe Quimby|Mayor Quimby]] talks with an exaggerated Boston accent as reference to the former US Senator [[Ted Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = John Robbie | last = Brown | title = Kennedy backs city's 'Simpsons Movie' campaign | date = 2 July 2007 | publisher = NY Times Co. | work = Boston.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Television [[comedy sketch]]es have featured the accent, including "[[The Boston Teens]]" and "Dunkin Donuts" on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', as well as "Boston Accent Trailer" on ''[[Late Night with Seth Meyers]]''.&lt;ref name="Gottlieb"/&gt; The popular American TV series [[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]] had, from its sixth season onwards, the Boston-born upper-class surgeon character [[List of M*A*S*H characters#Charles Winchester|Major Charles Emerson Winchester III]], portrayed by [[David Ogden Stiers]], always spoken with his characterization'a noticeable Boston accent.  

In ''[[The Heat (film)|The Heat]]'', the family of Shannon Mullins all speak with the Boston accent and confusion arrises from the pronunciation of the word ''narc'' as ''nahk''. ''[[30 Rock]]'' character Nancy Donovan speaks with a pronounced Boston accent. In the video game ''[[Team Fortress 2]]'', the character Scout, who is himself a Boston native, talks with a distinct Boston accent, although it sometimes lapses into a Brooklyn accent. Many elements of the Boston accent can be heard on the animated TV series ''[[Family Guy]]'', which is set in the fictional city of Quahog, Rhode Island.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

&lt;!--A source here listed for Bill Simmons literally stated that he does NOT have a Boston accent! The Wahlberg brothers, Matt Damon, and Ben Affleck, though all capable of imitating the accent (to varying degrees, according to some critics), are certainly not primary or lifelong speakers of the accent.

[[Image:Lo Spinario.JPG|thumb|right|200px|''Lo Spinario'' ([[Musei Capitolini|Palazzo dei Conservatori, Musei Capitolini]]).]]
'''''Boy with Thorn''''', also called '''''Fedele''''' ('''Fedelino''') or '''''Spinario''''', is a Greco-Roman [[Hellenistic]] bronze sculpture of a boy withdrawing a [[Spine (botany)|thorn]] from the sole of his foot, now in the [[Palazzo dei Conservatori]], [[Rome]]. There is a Roman marble version of this subject from the [[Medici]] collections in a corridor of the [[Uffizi Gallery]], [[Florence]].&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis P. Bober and R. Rubinstein, ''Renaissance Artists and Antique Sculpture: A Handbook of Sources,'' (London and Oxford) 1986, p. 235, no. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sculpture was one of the very few Roman bronzes that was never lost to sight.{{clarify|date=January 2018|reason=Definition of lost to sight? Doesn't even seem clear when it was made except in the "Hellenistic" period.}} The work was standing outside the [[Lateran Palace]] when the [[Navarra|Navarrese]] rabbi [[Benjamin of Tudela]] saw it in the 1160s and identified it as [[Absalom]], who "was without blemish from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Borchardt, "The sculpture in front of the Lateran as described by Bejamin of Tudela and [[Magister Gregorius]]", ''Journal of Roman Studies'', '''26''' (1936), pp. 68&amp;ndash;70, noted in Haskell and Penny 1981:308 note 20.&lt;/ref&gt; It was noted around 1200 by the English visitor, Magister Gregorius, who noted in his ''[[De mirabilibus urbis Romae]]'' that it was ridiculously thought to be [[Priapus]].&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Roberto Weiss, ''The Renaissance Discovery of Classical Antiquity'', 1969:7f.&lt;/ref&gt;  It must have been one of the sculptures transferred to the Palazzo dei Conservatori by [[Pope Sixtus IV]] in the 1470s, though it is not recorded there until 1499-1500.&lt;ref&gt;Haskell and Penny 1981: 308.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the Early Renaissance, it was celebrated through being one of the first Roman sculptures to be copied. There are bronze reductions by [[Severo da Ravenna]] and [[Pier Jacopo Alari Bonacolsi|Jacopo Buonaccolsi]] (called "L'Antico" for his refined, classicizing figures). Buonaccolsi made a copy for [[Isabella d'Este]] around 1501 that is now in the Galleria Estense, Modena.&lt;ref&gt;Paolucci, A. ''I Gonzaga e l’Antico percorso di Palazzo Ducale a Mantova'' (Rome, 1988), p. 40, fig. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; He followed that work with an untraced [[pendant]] that perhaps reversed the pose. In 1500, [[Antonello Gagini]] made a full-size variant for a fountain in [[Messina]], which is probably the bronze version that now resides in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York.

[[Image:"Boy with Thorn" or "Spinario" (British Museum).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Roman marble c.25–50 CE, copy of lost 3rd century BCE Hellenistic original of the type, from the Castellani collection, Rome. Said to have been found on the [[Esquiline Hill|Esquiline]]. The base of the statue is worked as a rock, with a hole for a fountain pipe. ([[British Museum]])&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/gr/m/marble_statue_of_the_spinario.aspx British Museum Compass site]: GR 1880.8-7.1 (''Sculpture'' 1755)&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the sixteenth century, bronze copies made suitably magnificent ambassadorial gifts to the King of France and the King of Spain. [[Francis I of France]] was given a version by [[Ippolito II d'Este]]. The making of this copy was overseen by [[Giovanni Fancelli]] and [[Jacopo Sansovino]], and the transaction effected by the courtly [[Benvenuto Cellini]]. It now is held in the [[Musée du Louvre]]. [[Philip II of Spain]] received a copy from Cardinal [[Giovanni Ricci]]. In the following century, [[Charles I of England]] had a bronze ''Spinario'' made by [[Hubert Le Sueur]].&lt;ref&gt;(Haskell and Penny 1981: 308&lt;/ref&gt;

Small bronze reductions were suitable for the less grand. A ''Still Life with 'Spinario''' by [[Pieter Claesz]], 1628, is conserved at the [[Rijksmuseum]], and among the riches emblematic of the good life, it displays a small plaster model of the ''Spinario''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rijksmuseum.nl/aria/aria_assets/SK-A-3930?lang=en&amp;context_space=&amp;context_id= Rijksmuseum website illustration]; it is also illustrated in ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages'', II, ch. 24 fig. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also marble copies. The Medici Roman marble seems to have been among the collection of antiquities assembled in the gardens at San Marco, Florence, which were the resort{{clarify|date=January 2018}} of the humanists in the circle of [[Lorenzo il Magnifico]], who opened his collection to young artists to study from. The young [[Michelangelo]] profited from this early exposure to antique sculpture.{{clarify|date=January 2018|reason= How?}} and it has been discussed whether [[Masaccio]] was influenced by the Medici ''Spinario'' or by the bronze he saw in Rome in the 1420s.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Cocke, "Masaccio and the Spinario, Piero and the Pothos: Observations on the Reception of the Antique in Renaissance Painting", ''Zeitschrift für Kunstgeschichte'', '''43'''.1 (1980),  pp. 21&amp;ndash;32.&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] more certainly adapted the ''Spinario'''s pose for the left-hand attendant in 1401 for his bronze panel ''The Sacrifice of Isaac'', which was his trial piece for the competition to design the doors of the [[Battistero di San Giovanni (Florence)|Baptistery of San Giovanni]].{{clarify|date=January 2018|reason=References aren't required for "general knowledge", but some would certainly like to follow up on who said so and *why*.}}
&lt;!--the Spinario connection is even made in the Encyclopedia of World Biography, so a ref. isn't required here
--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the end [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]]'s panels were chosen for the doors.&lt;/ref&gt;

The formerly popular title ''Il Fedele'' ("The faithful boy") derived from an anecdote invented to give this intimate and naturalistic study a more heroic civic setting: the faithful messenger, a mere shepherd boy, had delivered his message to the Roman Senate first, only then stopping to remove a painful thorn from his foot: the Roman Senate commemorated the event. Such a story was already deflated in Paolo Alessandro Maffei's ''Raccolta di statue antiche e moderni...'' of 1704&lt;ref&gt;Haskell and Penny 1981: 308, note 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking into account Hellenistic marble variants that have been discovered, of which the best is the ''Thorn-Puller'' from the Castellani collection now in the [[British Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/gr/m/marble_statue_of_the_spinario.aspx British Museum: Collection Highlights]&lt;/ref&gt; none of which have the archaizing qualities of the bronze ''Spinario'', recent scholarship has tended to credit this as a Roman bronze of the first century CE, with a head adapted from an archaic prototype.&lt;ref&gt;Helbig, noted by Haskell and Penny 1981: 308, note 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''The Burial Act 1857''' is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. It is one of the [[Burial Acts 1852 to 1885]]. Its purpose is to regulate [[burial ground]]s.  It regulates where and how [[deceased]] people may be [[Burial|buried]], and provides for the [[exhumation]] of remains. The Act made it illegal to disturb a grave (other than for an officially sanctioned exhumation). The Act did not make it illegal to steal a dead body, and it is only the opening of the grave which constitutes an offence, not the removal of the contents.

== Guidance for Burial Ground Managers ==
The Government Department for Constitutional Affairs provides guidance for burial ground managers, and many aspect of it relate to provisions contained in the Burial Act 1857.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/326370/burial-ground-managers.pdf|title=Guide for Burial Ground Managers|last=Department for Constitutional Affairs|first=|date=2006|website=Gov.UK|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Disturbing a Burial and Exhumation ==
Concerns arose that due to pressures of population movement to urban areas during the [[Industrial Revolution in the United Kingdom|Industrial revolution]] that burial graves were reused too quickly&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/may/17/nation-cemeteries-full-graves|title=The nation's cemeteries are nearly full|last=Edemariam|first=Aida|date=17 May 2011|website=The Guardian|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The offence of disturbing a burial included in the Burial Act 1857 was based on the Victorian value that a burial was for eternity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Section 25 of the Burial Act 1857 makes it unlawful in England and Wales to disturb human burials except without a licence from the Secretary of State, or on ground consecrated by the rites of the [[Church of England]], without the permission of the church.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The mechanisms about how the Church of England provides this permission slightly differs depending if the remains are at a church or cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.churchcare.co.uk/cathedrals/getting-advice/human-remains|title=Human Remains|last=Locke|first=Anne|date=2017|website=www.churchcare.co.uk|language=en-gb|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Viewpoint of Licencing Authorities on Exhumation ==
The Blagdon Cemetery [2002] [[Court of arches|Court of Arches]] case is the basis of the Church of England exhumation guidelines. The viewpoint of the Church of England is burial is final and only grants exhumation in exceptional circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dioceseofnorwich.org/churches/registry/churchyards/exhumation/|title=Exhumation|last=The Church of England Diocese of Norwich|first=|date=2018|website=The Church of England Diocese of Norwich|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Advisory Panel on the Archaeology of Burials in England is a partnership between [[Historic England]], and the Church of England providing guidance based on the law, [[archaeological]] research, and [[theology]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archaeologyuk.org/apabe/pdf/APABE_ToHREfCBG_FINAL_WEB.pdf|title=Guidance for Best Practice for the Treatment of Human Remains Excavated from Christian Burial Grounds in England.

== Modern amendments ==

In 2004, the Government, in response to the problem of the lack of space for new burials, partly a consequence of the Burial Act 1857, held a consultation called, “Burial Law and Policy in the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; Century”. The consultation considered how to address the problem that when a burial ground became full, it generated no income from new burials, and without income, it may become difficult to maintain and fall into neglect.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/620092674|title=The matter of death : space, place and materiality|last=Woodthorpe|first=Kate|date=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2010|isbn=9780230224162|editor-last=Hockey|editor-first=Jennifer Lorna|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire|pages=117-132|chapter=Private Grief in Public Spaces. Interpreting Memorialisation in the Contemporary Cemetery|oclc=620092674|editor-last2=Komaromy|editor-first2=Carol|editor-last3=Woodthorpe|editor-first3=Kate}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

London Burial Authorities in some instances could reclaim and reuse a grave after 75 years, under the London Authorities Act 2007. Extending this provision elsewhere in the country was deliberated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The consultation considered the ‘Exclusive Rights for Burial’. When purchasing a grave, a person usually buys the right to exclusive be buried in it for a period, often 100 years, they do not buy the land. Noted was the possibility of reusing graves with the permission of the Church of England. Section 25 of the Burial Act 1857, amended by Section 2 of the Church of England (Miscellaneous Provisions) Measures 2014 permitted the disturbance of graves with Church of England permission.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Successive Government have considered the problem of lack of space for graves but not taken at this time taken any action. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

The 2015 amendments to the Burial Act 1857, allowing the Church of England to reuse graves, was controversial. Such changes have been criticised as offensive and distressing to the living, and disrespectful to the dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.burtonmail.co.uk/news/local-news/tutbury-church-reuse-graves-dead-1267256|title=Church to reuse old graves as it struggles for burial space|last=Kreft|first=Helen|date=6 March 2018|work=Burton Main|access-date=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chinook Jargon''' (also known as '''{{lang|chn|Chinuk Wawa}}''', or '''{{lang|chn|Chinook Wawa}}''') is a nearly extinct American indigenous language originating as a [[pidgin language|pidgin trade language]] in the [[Pacific Northwest]], and spreading during the 19th century from the lower [[Columbia River]], first to other areas in modern [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]], then [[British Columbia]] and as far as [[Alaska]] and [[Yukon Territory]], sometimes taking on characteristics of a [[creole language]].&lt;ref name=lang&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Lang  | first = George  | title = Making Wawa: The Genesis of Chinook Jargon  | publisher = UBC Press  | year = 2008 | location = Vancouver | pages = especially 127–128 | isbn = 978-0-7748-1526-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is partly descended from the [[Chinook language]], upon which much of its vocabulary is based.&lt;ref name=dene&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ydli.org/bcother/chinook.htm |title=Chinook Jargon |accessdate=2009-12-02 |publisher=Yinka Dene Language Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many words from Chinook Jargon remain in common use in the [[Western United States]], [[British Columbia]] and the [[Yukon Territory|Yukon]], in indigenous languages as well as regional English usage.&lt;ref name=dillard&gt;Dillard, Joey Lee. 1985. Toward a social history of American English, pp. 146-147&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of Jargon words in published lexicons numbered only in the hundreds, and so it was easy to learn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content.lib.washington.edu/curriculumpackets/treaties/Chinook_Dictionary_Abridged.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904223643/http://content.lib.washington.edu/curriculumpackets/treaties/Chinook_Dictionary_Abridged.pdf |archivedate=2012-09-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has its own grammatical system, but a very simple one that, like its word list, was easy to learn. Though existent in Chinook Jargon, the consonant {{IPA|/r/}} is rare, and English and French loan words, such as ''rice'' and {{lang|fr|merci}}, have changed in their adoption to the Jargon, to {{lang|chn|lice}} and {{lang|chn|mahsie}}, respectively.

==Overview and history==
[[File:Gill's Dictionary of the Chinook Jargon 01B.jpg|thumb|Cover, ''[[J. K. Gill Company|Gill]]'s Dictionary of the Chinook Jargon'', 13th Edition, 1891. Photographed at [[Log House Museum]], [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]].]]

The Jargon was originally constructed from a great variety of [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Amerindian]] words of the Pacific Northwest, arising as an intra-indigenous [[contact language]] in a region marked by divisive geography and intense linguistic diversity. The participating peoples came from a number of very distinct [[language family|language families]], speaking dozens of individual [[language]]s.&lt;ref name=holton&gt;Holton, Jim. 1999. Chinook Jargon: The Hidden Language of the Pacific Northwest.&lt;/ref&gt; It peaked in usage from approximately 1858 to 1900, and declined as a result of the [[Spanish Flu]], [[World War I]] and [[Canadian Indian residential school system|residential schools]].&lt;ref name="The Tyee"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thetyee.ca/Life/2006/01/10/StillSpeakChinook/|title=Can We Still Speak Chinook? - The Tyee|date=10 January 2006|work=The Tyee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After European contact, the Jargon also acquired [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] loans, as well as words brought by other [[Indo-European languages|European]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}, [[Languages of Asia|Asian]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}, and [[Polynesian languages|Polynesian]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} groups. Some individuals from all these groups soon adopted The Jargon as a highly efficient and accessible form of communication. This use continued in some business sectors well into the 20th century&lt;ref&gt;''Early Vancouver'', Maj. J.S. "Skit" Matthews, City of Vancouver, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lillard&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Lillard | first = Charles | authorlink = Charles Lillard |author2=Terry Glavin  | title = A Voice Great Within Us  | publisher = New Star Books  | year = 1998 | location = Vancouver | isbn = 0-921586-56-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and some of its words continue to feature in company and organization names as well as in the [[List of Chinook Jargon placenames|regional toponymy]].

In the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Kamloops|Diocese of Kamloops]], [[British Columbia]], hundreds of speakers also learned to read and write the Jargon using [[Duployan shorthand]] via the publication ''[[Kamloops Wawa]]''&lt;!--Fr Lejeune shlud be mentioned--&gt;.  As a result, the Jargon also had the beginnings of its own literature, mostly translated [[Bible|scripture]] and [[Classics|classical works]], and some local and [[Bishop (Catholic Church)#Diocesan bishops or eparchs|episcopal]] news, community gossip and events, and [[Personal journal|diaries]].&lt;ref name=holton /&gt; Novelist and early Native American activist [[Marah Ellis Ryan]] (c. 1860-1934) used Chinook words and phrases in her writing.&lt;ref&gt;''Squaw Elouise'', Chicago; New York: Rand, McNally, 1892; ''Told in the Hills'', Chicago; New York: Rand, McNally, 1891, 1905.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Oregon]], Chinook Jargon was widely used by Natives, trappers, traders, employees of the Hudson's Bay Company, missionaries, and pioneers who came across the Oregon Trail from the 1830s-1870s. In [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]]'s first half century (1840s-1890s) there were frequent trade interactions between pioneers and Native Americans. After about 1900, when such daily interactions were less frequent, Jargon was spoken among pioneer families to prove how early they arrived out west. Many Oregonians used Jargon in casual conversation—to add humor, whimsy or emphasis and to exhibit deep knowledge of Oregon's history. Though traditions of speaking Jargon faded away among the non-Native population, some of Oregon's tribal groups continued speaking Chinook Jargon, though usage was diminished. However, a strong revival occurred with the [[Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon]]'s 2012 "Chinuk Wawa" dictionary.&lt;ref name=prince&gt;{{cite news

According to [[Nard Jones]], Chinook Jargon was still in use in [[Seattle]] until roughly the eve of [[World War II]], especially among the members of the [[Arctic Club (Seattle)|Arctic Club]], making Seattle the last city where the language was widely used. Writing in 1972, he remarked that at that later date "Only a few can speak it fully, men of ninety or a hundred years old, like [[Henry Broderick (Seattle)|Henry Broderick]], the realtor, and [[Joshua Green (seaman and banker)|Joshua Green]], the banker."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Name==
Most books written in English still use the term Chinook Jargon, but some linguists working with the preservation of a [[creolized]] form of the language used in [[Grand Ronde, Oregon]] prefer the term ''Chinuk Wawa'' (with the spelling 'Chinuk' instead of 'Chinook'). Historical speakers did not use the name ''Chinook Wawa'', however, but rather ''"the Wawa"'' or ''"Lelang"'' (from Fr. ''la langue'', the language, or tongue).{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}  NB ''Wawa'' also means speech or words &amp;ndash; "have a wawa" means "hold a parley" even in idiomatic English today,&lt;ref name="lillard"/&gt;&lt;!--I'm from the Pacific Northwest, and no one who I have spoken to recognizes that phrase.--&gt;&lt;!--cite available for that usage is from Begbie's/Bushby's field notes c.1859-60, don't have 'em here--&gt; and ''lelang'' also means the physical bodypart, the tongue.&lt;ref name="chinuk wawa dictionary project"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Chinuk Wawa Dictionary Project |title= Chinuk Wawa / kakwa nsayka ulman-tili̩xam ɬaska munk-kəmtəks nsayka / as Our Elders Teach Us to Speak it |publisher= University of Washington Press |year= 2012 |isbn= 0295991860 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name for the Jargon varied throughout the territory in which it was used. For example: ''skokum hiyu'' in the [[Boston Bar, British Columbia|Boston Bar]]-[[Lytton, British Columbia|Lytton]] area of the [[Fraser Canyon]], or in many areas simply just "the old trade language" or "the Hudson Bay language".&lt;!--I'll try and get cite backup for that; it's first person reportage from Siska BC--&gt;&lt;!--This is what I've heard it called in Klemtu and Bella Coola --&gt;

==Origins and evolution==
{{More citations needed|date=August 2008}}
There is some controversy about the origin of the Jargon, but all agree that its glory days were during the 19th century. During this era many dictionaries were published to help settlers interact with the [[First Nations]] people living there. The old settler families' heirs in the Pacific Northwest sent communiques to each other, stylishly composed entirely in "the Chinook". Many residents of the [[British Columbia]] city of [[Vancouver]] spoke Chinook Jargon as their [[first language]], even using it at home in preference to English. Among the first Europeans to use Chinook Jargon were [[Merchant|traders]], [[animal trapping|trappers]], [[Voyageurs]], [[Coureur des bois|Coureurs des bois]] and [[Catholic missionaries]].&lt;ref&gt; Goulet, George and Terry Goulet. http://www.metismuseum.ca/media/document.php/149202.Chinook%20Jargon.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Barkwell, Lawrence. https://www.scribd.com/document/142973621/Chinook-Metis-Trade-Language&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawaiians and American in the region made much use of it as well. In some places [[Kanakas]] married into the First Nations and non-native families and their particular mode of the Jargon is believed to have contained Hawaiian words, or Hawaiian styles of pronunciation. Similarly the Jargon as spoken by a Chinese person or a Norwegian or a Scot will have been influenced by those individuals' native-speaker terms and accents. In some areas the adoption of further non-aboriginal words has been observed. The Chinook Jargon naturally became the first language in multi-racial households and in multi-ethnic work environments such as canneries and lumberyards and ranches where it remained the language of the workplace well into the middle of the 20th century. During the [[Gold Rush]], Chinook Jargon was used in British Columbia by gold prospectors and [[Royal Engineers, Columbia detatchment|Royal Engineers]]. As industry developed, Chinook Jargon was often used by cannery workers and hop pickers of diverse ethnic background. Loggers, fishermen and ranchers incorporated it in their [[jargon]].

A heavily creolized form of Chinook Jargon (Chinuk Wawa) is still spoken as a first language by some residents of [[Oregon]], much as the [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] language [[Michif]] is spoken in [[Canada]]. Hence, Chinuk Wawa as it is known in Oregon is now a [[creole language]], distinct from the widespread and widely varied pronunciation of the Chinook Jargon as it spread beyond the Chinookan homeland. There is evidence that in some communities (e.g., around [[Fort Vancouver]]) the Jargon had become creolized by the early 19th century and that would have been among the mixed French/Métis, Algonkian, Scots and Hawaiian population there as well as among the natives around the Fort. At Grand Ronde, the resettlement of tribes from all over Oregon in a multi-tribal agency led to the use of Chinuk Wawa as a common tongue among the linguistically diverse population. These circumstances led to the creolization of Chinuk Wawa at Grand Ronde.&lt;ref name=zenk&gt;{{Cite book | last = Zenk | first = Henry | authorlink = Henry Benjamin Zenk | title = Chinook Jargon and Native Cultural Persistence in the Grand Ronde Indian Community, 1856-1907: A Special Case of Creolization | publisher = University of Oregon | year = 1984 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evidence that creolization occurred at the [[Confederated Tribes of Siletz]] reservation paralleling Grand Ronde&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livingtongues.org/hotspots/hotspot.siletz.html|title=Siletz Dee-Ni Talking Online Dictionary Project Western North America -  Living Tongues Institute For Endangered Languages|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110013331/http://www.livingtongues.org/hotspots/hotspot.siletz.html|archivedate=2013-11-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although, due to language revitalization efforts being focused on the [[Tolowa language]], Chinuk fell out of use.

No studies of British Columbia versions of the Jargon have demonstrated creolization. The range of varying usages and vocabulary in different regions suggests that localization did occur — although not on the pattern of Grand Ronde where Wasco, Klickitat and other peoples adopted and added to the version of the Jargon that developed there. First-language speakers of the Chinook Jargon were common in BC (native and non-native), until the mid-20th century. It is a truism that while after 1850 the Wawa was mostly a native language in the United States portion of the Chinook-speaking world, it remained in wide use among non-natives north of the border for another century, especially in wilderness areas and work environments.&lt;ref name="lillard"/&gt; Local creolizations probably did occur in British Columbia, but recorded materials have not been studied as they were made due to the focus on the traditional aboriginal languages.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

Many{{who|date=November 2012}} believe that something similar to the Jargon existed before European contact — without European words in its vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Edward Harper. ''Chinook: A History and Dictionary''. Portland, Ore. Bin fords &amp; Mort. 1935. p. 10. {{ISBN|0-8323-0217-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There is some evidence for a Chinookan-Nuu-chah-nulth [[lingua franca]] in the writings of [[John Jewitt]] and in what is known as the Barclay Sound word-list, from the area of [[Ucluelet]] and [[Port Alberni|Alberni]]. Others{{who|date=November 2012}} believe that the Jargon was formed in the great cultural cauldron of the time of Contact and cannot be discussed separately from that context, with an appreciation for the full range of the Jargon-speaking community and its history.&lt;ref name=holton /&gt;

Current scholarly opinion{{who|date=November 2012}} holds that a trade language probably existed before European contact, which began "morphing" into the more familiar Chinook Jargon in the late 1790s, notably at a dinner party at Nootka Sound where Capts [[George Vancouver|Vancouver]] and [[Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra|Bodega y Quadra]] were entertained by Chief Maquinna and his brother Callicum performing a theatrical using mock English and [[mock Spanish]] words and mimicry of European dress and mannerisms. There evidently was a Jargon in use in the Queen Charlotte, but this "[[Haida language|Haida]] [[Jargon]]" is not known to have shared anything in common with Chinook Jargon, or with the Nooktan-Chinookan "proto-jargon" which is its main foundation.

[[Pacific Northwest]] historians are well acquainted with the Chinook Jargon, in name if not in the ability to understand it.  Mentions of and phrases of Chinook Jargon were found in nearly every piece of historical source material before 1900.  Chinook Jargon is relatively unknown to the rest of the population, perhaps due to the great influx of newcomers into the influential urban areas. However, the memory of this language is not likely to fade entirely. Many words are still used and enjoyed throughout [[Oregon]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[British Columbia]], the [[Yukon]], and [[Alaska]]. Old-timers still dimly remember it, although in their youth, speaking this language was discouraged as [[slang]].  Nonetheless, it was the working language in many towns and workplaces, notably in ranching country and in canneries on the [[British Columbia Coast]] where it was necessary in the strongly multi-ethnic workforce.  Place names throughout this region bear Jargon names (see [[List of Chinook Jargon placenames]]) and words are preserved in various rural industries such as logging and fishing.

The Chinook Jargon was [[multicultural]] and functional.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Edward Harper. Chinook: A History and Dictionary. Portland, Ore. Bin fords &amp; Mort. 1935. {{ISBN|0-8323-0217-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To those familiar with it, Chinook Jargon is often considered a wonderful cultural inheritance. For this reason, and because Jargon has not quite died, enthusiasts actively promote the revival of the language in everyday western speech.

The [[Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon]] is taking steps to preserve Chinook Jargon use through a full immersion head start/preschool which is conducted in Chinuk Wawa, in hopes of fostering fluency in the language.&lt;ref name=hhs&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nccic.acf.hhs.gov/tribal/effective/grandronde/litoutreach.html |title=Confederated Tribes of the Grande Ronde Community of Oregon|accessdate=2009-12-02 |publisher=US Department of Health and Human Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=register&gt;McCowan, Karen.

In March 2012, the Tribe published a Chinuk Wawa dictionary through [[University of Washington Press]].&lt;ref name="chinuk wawa dictionary project" /&gt;

At her swearing-in as lieutenant governor in 2001, [[Iona Campagnolo]] concluded her speech in Chinook, observing that "konoway tillicums klatawa kunamokst klaska mamook okoke huloima chee illahie" - Chinook for "everyone was thrown together to make this strange new country (British Columbia)."&lt;ref name="The Tyee"/&gt;

==Revival of the language==
Chinuk Wawa was classified as extinct until the 2000s when it was revived, notably in 2014 with the release of ''Chinuk Wawa—As our elders teach us to speak it'' by the [[Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon]]. In 2018 a textbook for Chinook Jargon in Esperanto ("[https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/889965 La Chinuka Interlingvo Per Esperanto]", ''The Chinook Bridge-Language Using Esperanto'') was published in both physical and e-book formats by Sequoia Edwards.

During termination of aboriginal peoples by the United States government, speaking of the language was forbidden, and as a result, developed a decline of speakers. After the conclusion of the termination era with the restoration of tribes in the pacific northwest area, revival of Chinuk Wawa began. To date, there are fluent speakers of Chinuk Wawa, primarily in the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde.

==Influence on English==
[[British Columbian English]] and [[Pacific Northwest English]] have several words still in current use which are loanwords from the Chinook Jargon, which was widely spoken throughout the Pacific Northwest by all ethnicities well into the middle of the 20th century. These words tend to be shared with, but are not as common in, the states of [[Oregon]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Alaska]] and, to a lesser degree, [[Idaho]] and western [[Montana]].

==Chinook Jargon words used by English-language speakers==&lt;!-- PLEASE RESPECT ALPHABETICAL ORDER --&gt;
{{refimprove section|date=January 2015}}
* '''Cheechako''' &amp;mdash; Newcomer; the word is formed from "chee" (new) + "chako" (come) and was used to refer to non-native people.
* '''Chuck''' &amp;mdash; Water; and thus "saltchuck" salt water.
* '''Cultus''' &amp;mdash; means bad, worthless, useless, ordinary, evil or taboo.  "Cultus Iktus" means "worthless stuff".
* '''Hiyu''' &amp;mdash;  less common nowadays, but still heard in some places to mean a party or gathering.  From the Chinook for "many" or "several" or "lots of". The Big Hiyu (also known as "The July") was a week-long joint celebration of [[Dominion Day]] and the [[Glorious Fourth]] in the Fraser Canyon town of [[Lillooet, British Columbia|Lillooet]], featuring horse races, gambling, a rodeo and other festivities. A ''tenas hiyu'' (small gathering) was on a much smaller scale. The community of [[West Seattle]] has celebrated the month of July for more than 75&amp;nbsp;years with the HiYu Summer Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hiyu.com|title=hiyu.com|work=hiyu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Iktus''' &amp;mdash; "stuff" in Chinook Jargon, also pronounced "itkus" with 't' and 'k' reversed.
* '''Klootchman or Klootch''' &amp;mdash; in the Jargon meaning simply "a woman" or the female of something &amp;ndash; ''klootchman kiuatan'' (mare), ''klootchman lecosho'' (sow), ''tenas klootchman'' or ''klootchman tenas'' (girl, female child).  Still in use in English in some areas and with people of an older background to mean a First Nations woman, or to refer to the wives/women attached to a certain group in a joking way e.g. "we sent all the klootchman to the kitchen while we played cards".  Unlike its male equivalent ''siwash'', ''klootchman'' does not generally have a derisive tone nowadays (when used).
* '''Masi'''  &amp;mdash; In northern BC and the [[Yukon]], and used in broadcast English in those areas, the Chinook Jargon adaption of the French ''merci'' remains common, i.e. ''mahsi'' or ''masi'', with the accent on the first syllable (unlike in French).
* It is possible that the slang term '''[[Slang terms for money|moolah]]''', meaning money in American slang, comes from the word 'moolah' meaning 'mill' in Chinook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cayoosh.net/hiyu/money.html#engl|title=Cayoosh|work=cayoosh.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Potlatch]]''' &amp;mdash; in Chinook Jargon is a ceremony among certain tribes involving food and exchange of gifts, nowadays sometimes used to refer to a [[potluck dinner]] or sometimes the giving away of personal items to friends.
* '''[[Quiggly|Quiggly, quiggly hole]]''' &amp;mdash; refers to the remains of an old Indian pit-house, or underground house, from "kickwillie" or "kekuli", which in the Jargon means "down" or "underneath" or "beneath".
* '''[[Siwash (disambiguation)|Siwash]]''' &amp;mdash; (SAI-wash) properly a First Nations man, but sometimes used for women as well.  Nowadays considered extremely derogatory but still in use, typically with the connotation of "drunken no-good Indian".  Historically it did not necessarily have this connotation and was the generic term for Natives to the point where some writers thought there was a "Siwash tribe" in the region.  The origin of the word is from the French ''sauvage''.  When pronounced Sa-WASH, with the rhythm of the original French, it is used by modern speakers of the Chinook Jargon in [[Grand Ronde, Oregon]] with the context of meaning a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], or as an adjective connoting connection to same (the SAI-wash pronunciation is considered offensive in Grand Ronde).
* '''[[Skookum]]''' &amp;mdash;  The most versatile  &amp;mdash; is ''skookum'', which was used in the Jargon either as a verb auxiliary for ''to be able'' or an adjective for ''able, strong, big, genuine, reliable'' &amp;ndash; which sums up its use in BC English, although there are a wide range of possible usages: a ''skookum house'' is a jail or prison (''house'' in the Jargon could mean anything from a building to a room).  "He's a skookum guy" means that the person is solid and reliable while "we need somebody who's skookum" means that a strong and large person is needed.  A carpenter, after banging a stud into place, might check it and decide, "Yeah, that's skookum".  Asking for affirmation, someone might say "is that skookum" or "is that skookum with you?"  ''Skookum'' can also be translated simply as "O.K." but it means something a bit more emphatic.
* '''Tillicum''' &amp;mdash; means "people/person", "family", and "people".
* '''Tolo''' &amp;mdash;  used in Western Washington to mean a semi-formal dance, analogous to the homecoming ball, to which girls ask boys. From the Chinook for "to win".
* '''Tyee''' &amp;mdash; leader, chief, boss.  Also "Big Tyee" in the context of "boss" or well-known person.  In Campbell River and in the sport-fishing business, a really big chinook salmon (Campbell River) is a Tyee.  In the Jargon Tyee meant chief, and could also be an adjective denoting "big", as with "tyee salmon" or ''tyee lamel'' (boss mule). A ''hyas tyee'' means "important/big ruler/leader", i.e. &amp;ndash; king, big boss, important ruler, and is also sometimes used in English in the same way as Big Tyee. e.g. "He was the undisputed hyas tyee of all the country between the [[Johnstone Strait]] and Comox" This was also the common title used for the famous chiefs of the early era, such as Maquinna, for whom it was applied by Captain Vancouver and others in the context of "king". The ''Hyas Klootchman Tyee'' &amp;ndash; "Great Woman Ruler", roughly "Her Majesty", was the historical term for [[Queen Victoria]].  The word tyee was commonly used and still occurs in some local English usages meaning "boss" or someone in charge. Business and local political and community figures of a certain stature from some areas are sometimes referred to in the British Columbia papers and histories by the old chiefly name worn by [[Maquinna]], [[Comcomly|Concomly]] and [[Nicola (Okanagan leader)|Nicola]]. A man called hyas tyee would have been a senator, a longtime MP or MLA, or a business magnate with a strong local powerbase, long-time connections, and wealth from and because of the area. There is a popular [[British Columbia|BC]] news site named ''The Tyee''. Beginning in 1900, ''Tyee'' was also the title of the University of Washington Yearbook.&lt;ref&gt;[https://content.lib.washington.edu/uwdocsweb/index.html University of Washington Yearbooks and Documents]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3057">'''The Collateral Consequences Calculator''' is a legal website designed to aid judges, attorney, and legal academics in their research of [[collateral consequences of criminal charges]]. It is currently being developed as a joint project between students in the Lawyering in the Digital Age Clinic at Columbia Law School and the Columbia Center for New Media Teaching and Learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/portfolio/law/collateral_consequen.html|title=Project Portfolio {{!}} Collateral Consequences Calculator}}&lt;/ref&gt; The content is overseen by legal experts in the covered areas.

==History==
Judith Kaye, former Chief Judge of the State of New York, initiated the Partners in Justice Colloquium in 2005 to bring together judges, legal practitioners, and law professors to improve collaboration between the different legal spheres concerning social justice issues. The focus of this initial conference was to gain a better understanding of [[collateral consequences of criminal charges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Partners in Justice: Introduction|url=http://law.nyu.edu/journals/reviewoflawandsocialchange/issues/ECM_PRO_066270}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the results was the development of the "Four C's" website, which provides a collection of resources in each of the substantive areas where collateral consequences may occur. Due to the success of this site, development began on the Collateral Consequences Calculator, a "groundbreaking initiative" that will provide a convenient, easy-to-use overview of collateral consequences associated with specific sections of [[New York State Penal Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaye|first=Chief Judge Judith|title=The State of the Judiciary (2007)|url=http://www.courts.state.ny.us/ctapps/asx/soj07.asx}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became publicly available on in May, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Storey|first=Jeff|title=Collateral Consequences Calculator is Launched|url=http://www.law.com/jsp/nylj/PubArticleNY.jsp?id=1202458170648&amp;News_In_Brief&amp;hbxlogin=1|accessdate=13 April 2011|newspaper=New York Law Journal|date=15 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current Status==
The Calculator currently provides information in two important areas: immigration and public housing eligibility in New York City. The immigration consequences have been determined for the top 51 crimes that are either commonly charged or have commonly misunderstood immigration consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collateral Consequences Calculator|url=http://calculator.law.columbia.edu/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The housing consequences have been determined for the entire New York penal code, but apply only to New York City public housing.

'''Davy Jones' Locker''' is an [[idiom]] for the bottom of the sea: the state of death among drowned [[sailor]]s and [[shipwrecks]].&lt;ref name=slang&gt;{{cite book|pages=128–129|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lUYVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA129|title=A Dictionary of slang and Colloquial English|author1=Farmer|first1=John S|last2=Henley|first2=William Ernest|year=1927}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's used as a [[euphemism]] for [[drowning]] or [[shipwrecks]] in which the sailors' and ships' remains are consigned to the bottom of the sea (to be ''sent to Davy Jones' Locker'').&lt;ref name="FarmerHenley1891"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farmer|first1=John Stephen|last2=Henley|first2=W.

The origins of the name of Davy Jones, the sailors' [[devil]],&lt;ref name=slang/&gt; are unclear, with a 19th-century dictionary tracing Davy Jones to a "ghost of Jonah".&lt;ref name="fable"&gt;{{cite web | last = Brewer| first =E. Cobham | title = Davy Jones’s Locker. | work = Dictionary of Phrase and Fable | date = 1898-01-01| url = http://www.bartleby.com/81/4705.html| accessdate = 2006-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other explanations of this [[Sailors' superstitions|nautical superstition]] have been put forth, including an incompetent sailor or a pub owner who kidnapped sailors.

==History==
The earliest known reference of the negative connotation of Davy Jones occurs in the ''Four Years Voyages of Capt. George Roberts'', by the author [[Daniel Defoe]], published in 1726 in London.

{{quote|Some of Loe's Company said, They would look out some things, and give me along with me when I was going away; but Ruffel told them, they should not, for he would toss them all into Davy Jones's Locker if they did.|Daniel Defoe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OWsBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA89|page=89|title=The four years voyages of capt. George Roberts. Written by himself|last=Defoe|first=Daniel|year=1726}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An early description of Davy Jones occurs in [[Tobias Smollett]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle]]'', published in 1751:&lt;ref name="fable"/&gt;

{{quote|This same Davy Jones, according to sailors, is the fiend that presides over all the evil spirits of the deep, and is often seen in various shapes, ''perching among the rigging on the eve of hurricanes'':, ship-wrecks, and other disasters to which sea-faring life is exposed, warning the devoted wretch of death and woe.|Tobias Smollett&lt;ref name="fable"/&gt;}}

In the story, Jones is described as having saucer eyes, three rows of teeth, horns, a tail, and blue smoke coming from his nostrils.

===Proposed origins of the tale===
The origin of the tale of Davy Jones is unclear, and many conjectural&lt;ref name=slang/&gt; or folkloric&lt;ref name=mq&gt;{{cite web|title=World Wide Words|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-dav1.htm|accessdate=15 January 2013|author=Michael Quinion|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; explanations have been told:
*'The Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue' by Francis Gros, published in 1811, includes the definitions: “DAVID JONES. The devil, the spirit of the sea: called Necken in the north countries, such as Norway, Denmark, and Sweden” and “DAVID JONES'S LOCKER. The sea”.&lt;ref name=dotwt&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue|url=https://archive.org/stream/1811dictionaryof05402gut/dcvgr10.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The 1898 ''Dictionary of Phrase and Fable'' connects Dave to the [[West Indies|West Indian]] ''[[duppy]]'' (''duppy'') and Jones to biblical [[Jonah]]: {{quote|''He’s gone to Davy Jones’s locker'', i.e. he is dead. Jones is a corruption of Jonah, the prophet, who was thrown into the sea. ''Locker'', in seaman’s phrase, means any receptacle for private stores; and ''duppy'' is a ghost or spirit among the West Indian negroes. So the whole phrase is, "He is gone to the place of safe keeping, where duppy Jonah was sent to."|E. Cobham Brewer&lt;ref name="fable"/&gt;}}
*David Jones, a real [[pirate]], although not a very well-known one, living on the [[Indian Ocean]] in the 1630s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Rogoziński | first =Jan | location = Hertfordshire| title = The Wordsworth Dictionary of Pirates | isbn = 1-85326-384-2| date = 1997-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Duffer Jones, a notoriously [[myopic]] sailor who often found himself overboard.&lt;ref name="jones"&gt;{{cite book | last = Shay | first =Frank  | title = A Sailor's Treasury |publisher= Norton |id = ASIN B0007DNHZ0| accessdate = 2006-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A British pub owner who supposedly threw drunken sailors into his ale locker and then gave them to be [[Conscription|drafted]] on any ship.&lt;ref name=mq/&gt;
*Linguists consider it most plausible that ''Davy'' was inspired by [[Saint David]] of Wales, whose name was often invoked by Welsh sailors, and ''Jones'' by the Biblical [[Jonah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=August 22, 2014 Word of the Day: Davy Jones's Locker|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day/2014/08/22/|accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all traditions dealing with Davy Jones are fearful. In traditions associated with sailors [[Line-crossing ceremony|crossing the Equatorial line]], there was a "raucous and rowdy" initiation presided over by those who had crossed the line before, known as shellbacks, or Sons of [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]]. The eldest shellback was called King Neptune, and Davy Jones would be re-enacted as his first assistant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wvKiBiWKrzMC&amp;lpg=PA79&amp;dq=davy%20jones&amp;pg=PA76#v=onepage&amp;q=davy%20jones&amp;f=false|pages=76–79|title=Naval Ceremonies, Customs, and Traditions|isbn=9781557503305|author1=Connell|first1=Royal W|last2=Mack|first2=William P|date=2004-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in media==

===19th century===
In 1824, [[Washington Irving]] mentions Jones's name in his ''Adventures of the Black Fisherman'':
{{quote|He came, said he, in a storm, and he went in a storm; he came in the night, and he went in the night; he came nobody knows whence, and he has gone nobody knows where. For aught I know he has gone to sea once more on his chest, and may land to bother some people on the other side of the world; though it is a thousand pities, added he, if he has gone to Davy Jones's locker.|[[Washington Irving]]&lt;ref name="irving"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://irving.thefreelibrary.com/Adventure-of-the-Black-Fisherman|first=Washington|last=Irving|title=Adventure of the Black Fisherman|publisher=Free Online Library|accessdate=2010-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s "[[s:King Pest|King Pest]]" of 1835, Davy Jones is referred to dismissively by the anti-hero, Tarpaulin, when King Pest refers to "that unearthly sovereign" "whose name is Death." Tarpaulin responds, "Whose name is Davy Jones!"&lt;ref name="poe"&gt;Poe, Edgar Allan (1835) "[[s:King Pest]]"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herman Melville]] mentions Jones in the 1851 classic ''[[Moby-Dick]]'':
{{quote|There was young Nat Swaine, once the bravest boat-header out of all Nantucket and the Vineyard; he joined the meeting, and never came to good. He got so frightened about his plaguy soul, that he shrinked and sheered away from the whales, for fear of after-claps, in case he got stove and went to Davy Jones.|[[Herman Melville]]&lt;ref name="melville"&gt;Melville, Herman (1851) [[s:Moby-Dick/Chapter 18]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[Bleak House]]'' (1852–53), the character Mrs. Badger quotes her former husband's work ethic, portraying Davy Jones in a formidable light:
{{quote|"It was a maxim of Captain Swosser's", said Mrs. Badger, "speaking in his figurative naval manner, that when you make pitch hot, you cannot make it too hot; and that if you only have to swab a plank, you should swab it as if Davy Jones were after you."|[[Charles Dickens]]&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Illustrated Dickens, page 229.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s 1883 novel ''[[Treasure Island]]'', Davy Jones appears three times, for example in the phrase "in the name of Davy Jones".&lt;ref name="stevenson_ch22"&gt;Stevenson, Robert Louis (1883) [[s:Treasure Island (1883)/Chapter 22]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stevenson_ch20"&gt;Stevenson, Robert Louis (1883) [[s:Treasure Island (1883)/Chapter 20]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
[[File:"Lubbers don't live - Oh learn a lesson from Joe Gotch" - NARA - 514926.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|World War II poster makes reference to Davy Jones's Locker.{{refn | group = n|Caption: Oh learn a lesson from Joe Gotch - Without a lifebelt he stood watch - "Abandon ship" came over the phones - He now resides with Davy Jones}} A "lubber" is a clumsy or careless sailor (from ''landlubber'', naval slang for a greenhorn).]]

In [[J. M. Barrie]]'s 1904 play and 1911 novel ''[[Peter and Wendy]]'', Captain Hook sings a song:
{{quote|Yo ho, yo ho, the pirate life,&lt;br /&gt;The flag o' skull and bones,&lt;br /&gt;A merry hour, a hempen rope,&lt;br /&gt;And hey for Davy Jones.|[[J. M. Barrie]]|&lt;ref name="barrie"&gt;Barrie, J. M. (1904 and 1911) [[s:Peter and Wendy/Chapter 15]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A [[United States Navy|US Navy]] song, "[[Anchors Aweigh]]", refers to Davy Jones in its current lyrics adopted in the 1920s:
{{quote|Roll out the TNT, Anchors Aweigh.&lt;br /&gt;Sail on to victory&lt;br /&gt;And sink their bones to Davy Jones! Hooray!!&lt;br /&gt;|&lt;ref name="US_Navy"&gt;{{cite web |year=2007 |url = http://www.navy.mil/navydata/navy_legacy_hr.asp?id=191#revised|title = The US Navy|publisher = The US Navy| accessdate = 2008-02-28 | last= George Lottman|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The comic strip [[Terry and the Pirates (comic strip)|Terry and the Pirates]] ([[Sunday strip]] March 3, 1935, 10th picture) contains the line "Boy! - I'm flirtin' with ol' Davey Jones! - this weepin' bomb had better work!". It is said by Terry as he is climbing the outside of a ship at sea while fighting pirates.

The 1959 Broadway musical ''Davy Jones' Locker'' with [[Bil Baird]]'s marionettes had a two-week run at the Morosco Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/production/davy-jones-locker-morosco-theatre-vault-0000002430|title=Davy Jones' Locker @ Morosco Theatre|accessdate=2016-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late 20th-century songs that refer to Davy Jones include [[Paul McCartney]]'s song "[[Morse Moose and the Grey Goose]]" and the [[Beastie Boys]]' song "Rhymin and Stealin".

In the English translations of ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'', the character [[Captain Haddock]] makes occasional references to Davy Jones.  Also, ''[[Secret of the Unicorn]]'', on page 17, while recounting [[Sir Francis Haddock|Sir Francis Haddock's]] manuscript to Tintin, references a pirate ship raising the red flag and says, "The red pennant!... No quarter given!... A fight to the death, no prisoners taken! You understand? If we're beaten, then it's every man to Davy Jones's locker!" However, it is not the case in the original version, since the idiom only exists in English (in French, he uses another archaic French idiom, "Que le Grand Cric me croque !", which is not particularly related to sailors and has nothing to do with Davy Jones).

In the Genesis song "Dodo/Lurker" from the 1981 album ''Abacab'', the sixth stanza has the lyrics: 
"One he got a dream of love, deep as the ocean 
Where does he go, what does he do? 
Will the siren team with Davy Jones, 
And trap him at the bottom of the sea?"

The [[Iron Maiden]] song "[[No Prayer for the Dying|Run Silent Run Deep]]" (about submarine warfare) contains the lines: "The lifeboats shattered, the hull is torn/The tar black smell of burning oil/On the way down to Davy Jones/Every man for himself – you're on your own..."

The band [[Clutch (band)|Clutch]] have a song entitled "Big News I", which says, when played backwards, "them bones, them bones, them dry, dry bones/ Come down to the locker of Davy Jones".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clutch Lyrics |accessdate=2 February 2013 |url=http://www.pro-rock.com/index.cfm?page=discography&amp;view=lyrics&amp;albumid=5&amp;lid=80 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702145620/http://pro-rock.com/index.cfm?page=discography&amp;view=lyrics&amp;albumid=5&amp;lid=80 |archivedate=2 July 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s television series ''[[The Monkees (TV series)|The Monkees]]'' episode "Hitting The High Seas", the character Davy Jones (played by musician [[Davy Jones (musician)|Davy Jones]]) receives special treatment while kidnapped in a ship as he claims to be related to "The Original" Davy Jones, his grandfather. Meanwhile, his fellow band members are held hostage, leading to various humorous situations. The fact that Jones the musician shared a name with the legendary seafarer has itself led to a number of [[pun]]s swapping the two in the decades that followed.

In the UK TV sitcom ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'' ("The Frog's Legacy"), Del Boy mentions "it's not going to end up in Davy Jones' locker" at the end.

In the [[1994 in film|1994]] movie ''[[The Pagemaster]]'', Adventure ([[Patrick Stewart]]) and Richard Tyler ([[Macaulay Culkin]]) are shipwrecked, and when Richard Tyler asks what happened to Fantasy and Horror, Adventure sadly replies, "I'm afraid they've gone below to Davey Jones."

The [[Tears for Fears]] song "Don't Drink the Water" from the 1995 album ''[[Raoul and the Kings of Spain]]'' contains the lines: "I saw you swim / Sink to your grave / Down to Davy Jones' locker / Under the waves..."

In the cartoon "The Haunted Ship", from the Aesop's Fables series produced by the Van Beuren animation studios, Davy Jones is depicted as a living skeleton wearing a pirate's bicorn.

===21st century===
The concept of Davy Jones was conflated with the legend of the ''[[Flying Dutchman]]'' in the ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' film series, in which [[Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Davy Jones]]'s locker is portrayed as a purgatory place of punishment for those who crossed Davy Jones. Jones is portrayed as a captain assigned to ferry those drowned at sea to the afterlife before he corrupted his purpose out of anger at his betrayal by his lover, the sea goddess Calypso. Davy Jones is portrayed in the movie as an enigma of the sea, featuring octopus arms for a beard and crab claw for a hand.

The origins of Davy Jones and Calypso are revealed in the stand-alone [[novella]] "Davy Jones &amp; the Heart of Darkness". The Scottish origins are consistent with the legend, but this novella includes Davy's training aboard Inferno with Charon, the ferryman of Hades. The tale is written by Dave Montalbano and illustrated by [[Rachel Galvin]].&lt;ref&gt;Montalbano, Dave/ Galvin, Rachel (Illustrator) 2013, ©2013

In the video game ''[[Banjo-Tooie]]'', in world 4 (Jolly Roger's Lagoon), the player can swim to the bottom of the lagoon and find a giant locker with the name "D. Jones" on it (among many other lockers bearing the names of various [[Rare (company)|Rare]] developers). Inside the locker is a cavern containing the level boss, an [[anglerfish]] named Lord Woo Fak Fak.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/wikis/banjo-tooie/Jolly_Roger's_Lagoon_Jiggies|title=Jolly Roger's Lagoon Jiggies - Banjo-Tooie Wiki Guide - IGN|website=IGN|language=en|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has also been used repeatedly in the animated TV series ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' to represent an actual locker in the bottom of the sea where [[Davy Jones (musician)|Davy Jones]] (of [[The Monkees]] fame) keeps his gym socks.&lt;ref name="spngepedia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.spongepedia.org/index.php?title=Davy_Jones%27_Locker |title=Davy Jones' Locker |accessdate=2018-08-05 |publisher=SpongePedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Players of the 21st-century real-world treasure-hunting game of [[Geocaching]] have been inspired to hide a number of geocaches containing a reference to Davy Jones's Locker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geocaching: GC5DJ07 | accessdate=2014-10-01 |url=http://coord.info/GC5DJ07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adam Carolla]] has repeatedly used or referenced the term on his daily podcast, ''[[The Adam Carolla Show (podcast)|The Adam Carolla Show]]''.

[[The Devil Makes Three (band)|The Devil Makes Three]] references the idiom on their single "The Plank".

[[Sleeping With Sirens]] references Davy Jones on their song "Don't Fall Asleep At The Helm".

In his novel ''[[The Last Dickens]]'', [[Matthew Pearl]] makes the Captain of the ''Samaria'' transatlantic liner assume that Herman the Parsee might be "sleeping soundly in Davy Jones's locker", namely that he ''"''has almost certainly perished in the depths''."'' Use of seamen jargon chimes with the Dickensian topic and environment of the novel.

In the novel ''[[The Amber Spyglass]]'' (the third and last book of [[Philip Pullman]]'s trilogy ''[[His Dark Materials]]''), [[Lyra Belacqua]] tells the tale (actually, a lie) that her friend [[List of His Dark Materials characters#Roger Parslow|Roger Parslow]] ''lost his footing and plunged down into Davy Jones's Locker''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Pullman]], [[His Dark Materials]], Scholastic edition (2012), p. 809&lt;/ref&gt;

French singer [[Nolwenn Leroy]] recorded a song titled "Davy Jones" for her 2012 album ''Ô Filles de l'Eau''. The English version contains the lines: "Davy Jones, oh Davy Jones / Where they gonna rest your bones / Down in the deep blue sea / Down in the deep blue sea..."

American surf-rock/punk band Rusty Shipp released a song in late 2012 titled "Davy Jones Ain't Got Nothin' On Me", which makes several references to Davy Jones's Locker, and also is believed to make reference to the "Flying Dutchman" myth. This is especially prevalent in the lines: "all of the sudden, a ghost ship appears/with a crew of souls whose singing I hear".

''[[Monster High]]'' character Dayna Treasura Jones is the pirate daughter of Davy Jones.

In the sixteenth episode of the [[Once Upon a Time (season 7)|seventh season]] of ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'', Davy Jones' Locker appears as a treasure chest at the bottom of the sea.

'''''Family Guy''''' is an American [[animated sitcom]] created by [[Seth MacFarlane]] for the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]]. The series centers on the [[Griffin family|Griffins]], a family consisting of parents [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] and [[Lois Griffin|Lois]]; their children, [[Meg Griffin|Meg]], [[Chris Griffin|Chris]], and [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]]; and their [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] pet dog, [[Brian Griffin|Brian]]. The show is set in the fictional city of Quahog, [[Rhode Island]], and exhibits much of its humor in the form of [[metafictional]] [[cutaway (filmmaking)|cutaway gags]] that often lampoon [[Culture of the United States|American culture]].

The family was conceived by MacFarlane after developing two animated films, [[The Life of Larry and Larry &amp; Steve|''The Life of Larry'' and ''Larry &amp; Steve'']]. MacFarlane redesigned the films' protagonist, Larry, and his dog, Steve, and renamed them Peter and Brian, respectively. MacFarlane pitched a seven-minute pilot to Fox in 1998, and the show was greenlit and began production. Shortly after the third season of ''Family Guy'' had aired in 2002, Fox canceled the series with [[When You Wish Upon a Weinstein|one episode]] left unaired. [[Adult Swim]] aired that episode in 2003, finishing the series' original run. However, favorable DVD sales and high [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] for syndicated reruns on Adult Swim convinced the network to renew the show in 2004 for a fourth season, which began airing on May 1, 2005.

Since its debut on January 31, 1999, [[List of Family Guy episodes|{{:Family Guy}} episodes]]&lt;!-- The episode number is updated in the infobox. Please do not update it directly here. --&gt; of ''Family Guy'' have been broadcast. Its [[Family Guy (season 17)|seventeenth season]] began on September 30, 2018. ''Family Guy'' has been nominated for 12 [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s and 11 [[Annie Award]]s, and has won three of each. In 2009, it was nominated for an [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series]], the first time an animated series was nominated for the award since ''[[The Flintstones]]'' in 1961. ''Family Guy'' has also received [[Criticism of Family Guy|criticism]], including unfavorable comparisons to ''[[The Simpsons]]''.

Many [[tie-in]] media have been released, including ''[[Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story]]'', a [[direct-to-video|straight-to-DVD]] special released in 2005; ''[[Family Guy: Live in Vegas]]'', a soundtrack-DVD combo released in 2005, featuring music from the show as well as original music created by MacFarlane and [[Walter Murphy]]; a [[Family Guy Video Game!|video game]] and [[pinball machine]], released in 2006 and 2007, respectively; since 2005, six books published by [[HarperCollins|Harper Adult]] based on the ''Family Guy'' universe; and ''[[Laugh It Up, Fuzzball: The Family Guy Trilogy]]'' (2010), a series of parodies of the [[Star Wars original trilogy|original ''Star Wars'' trilogy]]. In 2008, MacFarlane confirmed that the cast was interested in producing a feature film and that he was working on a story for a film adaptation.

A spin-off series, ''[[The Cleveland Show]]'', featuring [[Cleveland Brown]], aired from September 27, 2009, to May 19, 2013. "[[The Simpsons Guy]]", a crossover episode with ''The Simpsons'', aired on September 28, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Baldwin |first=Kristen |url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/07/18/simpsons-family-guy-crossover-episode |title='The Simpsons,' 'Family Guy' doing crossover episode |publisher=Insidetv.ew.com |date=July 18, 2013 |accessdate=February 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Family Guy'' is a joint production by [[Fuzzy Door Productions]] and [[20th Century Fox Television]] and syndicated by [[20th Television]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fox.com/familyguy/about |title=About the Show |publisher=Fox Broadcasting Company |accessdate=November 15, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102043038/http://www.fox.com/familyguy/about/ |archivedate=November 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked ''Family Guy'' the ninth Greatest TV Cartoon of All Time.&lt;ref name="tvguide1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Greatest-Cartoons-TV-Guide-Magazine-1071203.aspx |title=TV Guide Magazine's 60 Greatest Cartoons of All Time |publisher=Tvguide.com |date=September 24, 2013 |accessdate=February 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 12, 2018, Fox renewed the series for a seventeenth season, which premiered on September 30, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/family-guy-bobs-burgers-renewed-fox-1202800400/|title='Family Guy' and 'Bob's Burgers' Renewed by Fox|first=Danielle|last=Turchiano|date=May 12, 2018|website=variety.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|List of Family Guy characters}}
The show revolves around the adventures of the [[Griffin family]], consisting of father [[Peter Griffin]], a bumbling yet well-intentioned [[blue-collar worker]]; [[Lois Griffin|Lois]], a pretty stay-at-home mother and piano teacher who is a member of the wealthy [[Pewterschmidt family]]; [[Meg Griffin|Meg]], their often-bullied teenage daughter who is also constantly ridiculed or ignored by the family; [[Chris Griffin|Chris]], their awkward teenage son, who is overweight, unintelligent and, in many respects, is simply a younger version of his father; and [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]], their diabolical infant son of ambiguous sexual orientation who has adult mannerisms and uses stereotypical [[Archenemy|archvillain]] phrases. Living with the family is their witty, smoking, [[Martini (cocktail)|martini-swilling]], sarcastic, English-speaking anthropomorphic dog [[Brian Griffin|Brian]], though he is still considered a pet in many ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jefferson |last=Graham |title=Fox revisits ''Family Guy'' |publisher=Gannett Company|newspaper=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary setting of ''Family Guy'' is Quahog ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|oʊ|h|ɒ|ɡ}}  [pron. ko-hog or kwo-hog]), a [[List of fictional towns in animation|fictional district]] of [[Providence, Rhode Island]] that was founded by Peter's ancestor, Griffin Peterson. MacFarlane resided in Providence during his time as a student at [[Rhode Island School of Design]], and the show contains distinct Rhode Island landmarks similar to real-world locations.&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{cite web|first=Daniel Robert |last=Epstein |url=http://www.ugo.com/channels/filmTv/features/familyguy/sethmacfarlane.asp |title=Interview with Seth MacFarlane, creator of The Family Guy |website=[[UGO Networks]] |accessdate=April 8, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611145603/http://www.ugo.com/channels/filmTv/features/familyguy/sethmacfarlane.asp|archivedate=June 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=James |last=Bartlett |url=http://greatreporter.com/mambo/content/view/1383/11/ |title=Seth MacFarlane&amp;nbsp;– he's the "Family Guy" |work=Greatreporter.com |accessdate=June 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacFarlane often borrows the names of Rhode Island locations and icons such as [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island|Pawtucket]] and [[Buddy Cianci]] for use in the show. MacFarlane, in an interview with a news program on [[WNAC-TV]], Channel 64 in Providence, stated that the town is modeled after [[Cranston, Rhode Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Family Guy writer at Bryant |journal=[[The Providence Journal]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
{{Main|The Life of Larry and Larry &amp; Steve}}

These scripts generally include cutaway gags. Various gags are pitched to MacFarlane and the rest of the staff, and those deemed funniest are included in the episode. MacFarlane has explained that normally it takes 10 months to produce an episode because the show uses hand-drawn animation. The show rarely comments on current events for this reason.&lt;ref name="AOL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://television.aol.com/tv-celebrity-interviews/seth-macfarlane |title='American Dad' and 'Family Guy' Creator Seth MacFarlane Is Animated About Work and Play |website=The TV Tattler |publisher=[[AOL|AOL Inc.]] |accessdate=August 8, 2010 |date=August 5, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510223108/http://television.aol.com/tv-celebrity-interviews/seth-macfarlane |archivedate=May 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The show's initial writers had never written for an animated show; and most came from live-action sitcoms.&lt;ref name="Road to"/&gt;

MacFarlane explains that he is a fan of 1930s and 1940s radio programs, particularly the radio thriller anthology "[[Suspense (radio drama)|Suspense]]", which led him to give early episodes ominous titles like "[[Death Has a Shadow]]" and "[[Mind Over Murder]]". MacFarlane explained that the team dropped the naming convention after individual episodes became hard to identify, and the novelty wore off.&lt;ref name=TVIGNFest&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/696/696615p1.html|title=William S.

Credited with 19 episodes, Steve Callaghan is the most prolific writer on ''Family Guy'' staff. Many of the writers that have left the show have gone on to create or produce other successful series. [[Neil Goldman and Garrett Donovan]] co-wrote 13 episodes for the NBC sitcom ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'' during their eight-year run on the show, while also serving as co-producers and working their way up to executive producers.&lt;ref name="InAndOut"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/guide.aspx?id=in_and_out |title=the futon's guide to who's in and who's out |publisher=The Futon Critic |accessdate=September 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mike Barker (producer)|Mike Barker]] and [[Matt Weitzman]] left the show and went on to create the long-running and still ongoing adult animated series ''[[American Dad!]]'' MacFarlane is also a co-creator of ''American Dad!''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Alexandria | last=Stanley | title=Dad Is a C.I.A.

During the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike]], official production of the show halted for most of December 2007 and for various periods afterward. Fox continued producing episodes without MacFarlane's final approval, which he termed "a colossal dick move" in an interview with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''.

===Early history and cancellation===
''Family Guy'' officially premiered after Fox's broadcast of [[Super Bowl XXXIII]] on January 31, 1999, with "[[Death Has a Shadow]]". The show debuted to 22 million viewers, and immediately generated controversy regarding its adult content.&lt;ref name="Family Guy may return"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2003-11-18-family-guy_x.htm |title=''Family Guy'' may return |publisher= [[Gannett Company]]|work=[[USAToday]]|date=November 18, 2003|accessdate=December 6, 2009| first1=Gary | last1=Levin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show returned on April 11, 1999, with "[[I Never Met the Dead Man]]". ''Family Guy'' garnered decent ratings in Fox's 8:30&amp;nbsp;pm slot on Sunday, scheduled between ''The Simpsons'' and ''[[The X-Files]]''.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; At the end of its first season, the show ranked at #33 in the [[Nielsen ratings]], with 12.8 million households tuning in.&lt;ref name="Geocities"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/4616/ew0604.html|work=[[GeoCities]]|date=March 24, 2004|title=1998–99 Ratings|accessdate=September 16, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091029011819/http://geocities.com/Hollywood/4616/ew0604.html|archivedate=October 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show launched its second season in a new time slot, Thursday at 9&amp;nbsp;pm, on September 23, 1999. ''Family Guy'' was pitted against NBC's ''[[Frasier]]'', and the series' ratings declined sharply.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Subsequently, Fox removed ''Family Guy'' from its schedule, and began airing episodes irregularly. The show returned on March 7, 2000, at 8:30&amp;nbsp;pm on Tuesdays, where it was constantly beaten in the ratings by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s then-new breakout hit ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (U.S. game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire]]'', coming in at #114 in the Nielsen ratings with 6.32 million households tuning in.&lt;ref name="fbibler"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fbibler.chez.com/tvstats/recent_data/1999-00.html

The show returned November 8, 2001, once again in a tough time slot: Thursday nights at 8:00&amp;nbsp;pm [[Eastern Time Zone|ET]]; this slot brought it into competition with ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]'' and ''[[Friends]]'' (a situation that was later referenced in ''[[Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/dvd-reviews/family-guy-presents-stewie-griffin-the-untold-story/2006/01/23/1137864848861.html |publisher=Fairfax Media|work=The Age | location=Melbourne |title=Family Guy Presents Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story |first=Michael |last=Idato |date=January 23, 2006 |accessdate=September 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; During its second and third seasons, Fox frequently moved the show around to different days and time slots with little or no notice and, consequently, the show's ratings suffered.&lt;ref name="VanDerWerff, Todd"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/to-surveil-with-lovebrotherly-lovebrian-stewie%2C40698/ |title=To Surveil With Love"/"Brotherly Love"/"Brian &amp; Stewie |author=VanDerWerff, Todd |publisher=[[The Onion]], Inc. |website=[[The A.V.

===Lawsuits===
In March 2007 comedian [[Carol Burnett]] filed a $6 million lawsuit against 20th Century Fox, claiming that her [[charwoman]] cartoon character had been portrayed on the show without her permission. She stated it was a trademark infringement, and that Fox violated her publicity rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/03/17/us-burnett-idUSN1624604020070317 |title=Carol Burnett sues over ''Family Guy'' cartoon cleaning woman |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=March 16, 2007 |accessdate=July 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6462525.stm |title=Comedian Burnett sues Family Guy |date=March 17, 2007|accessdate=June 14, 2009 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2007/0316072carolburnett1.html |title=Carol Burnett v.

On October 3, 2007, [[Bourne Co. Music Publishers]] filed a lawsuit accusing the show of [[copyright infringement|infringing its copyright]] on the song "[[When You Wish Upon a Star]]", through a parody song entitled "I Need a Jew" appearing in the episode "[[When You Wish Upon a Weinstein]]". Bourne Co., the sole United States copyright owner of the song, alleged the parody pairs a "thinly veiled" copy of its music with [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] lyrics. Named in the suit were [[20th Century Fox Film Corporation|20th Century Fox Film Corp.]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Broadcasting Co.]], [[Cartoon Network]], [[Seth MacFarlane|MacFarlane]] and [[Walter Murphy|Murphy]]; the suit sought to stop the program's distribution and asked for unspecified damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Bourne Co., vs. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation, Fox Broadcasting Company, Twentieth Century Fox Television, Inc., Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment, Inc., Fuzzy Door Productions, Inc., The Cartoon Network, Inc., Seth MacFarlane, Walter Murphy |court=[[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|United States District Court, Southern District of New York]] |date=October 3, 2007|accessdate=September 5, 2010|url=http://www.schwimmerlegal.com/family%20guy%20complaint.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bourne argued that "I Need a Jew" uses the copyrighted melody of "When You Wish Upon a Star" without commenting on that song, and that it was therefore not a First Amendment-protected parody per the ruling in ''[[Campbell v.

In December 2007, ''Family Guy'' was again accused of copyright infringement when actor [[Art Metrano]] filed a lawsuit regarding a scene in ''[[Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story]]'', in which Jesus performs Metrano's signature "magic" act involving absurd "faux" magical hand gestures while humming the distinctive tune "[[Fine and Dandy (song)|Fine and Dandy]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2007/12/06/6128/magician_sues_over_cartoon_jesus |title=Magician sues over cartoon Jesus |website=Chortle |accessdate=September 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 20th Century Fox, MacFarlane, Callaghan and Borstein were all named in the suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Arthur Metrano, vs. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation, Seth MacFarlane, Steve Callaghan and Alex Borstein |court=[[United States District Court for the Central District of California|United States District Court, Central District of California]] |accessdate=April 27, 2010|date=December 5, 2007|url=http://www.aolcdn.com/tmz_documents/1206_metrano_fox_wm.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2009 a federal district court judge rejected Fox's motion to dismiss, saying that the first three fair use factors involved — "purpose and character of the use", "nature of the infringed work" and "amount and substantiality of the taking" — counted in Metrano's favor, while the fourth — "economic impact" — had to await more fact-finding. In denying the dismissal, the court held that the reference in the scene made light of Jesus and his followers — not Metrano or his act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://prawfsblawg.blogs.com/prawfsblawg/2009/07/the-amazing-metrano-family-guy-and-fair-use.html |title=The Amazing Metrano, Family Guy, and Fair Use |first=Dave |last=Fagundes |date=July 20, 2009 |website=PrawfsBlawg |accessdate=March 16, 2011}}

The first episode was directed by [[Dan Povenmire]], who would direct the rest of the "Road to" episodes until the episode "[[Road to Rupert]]", at which point he had left the show to create ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]''.&lt;ref name="QA"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i0bc78baf8235f8b4159fd786ff9f8736|title= Q&amp;A: Dan Povenmire|author= Bond, Paul.|date= June 7, 2009|publisher=e5 Global Media|work=The Hollywood Reporter}}{{dead link|date=April 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.film.com/tv/family-guy/season-3-2001/episode-20-road-to-europe/14647450|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024123628/http://www.film.com/tv/family-guy/season-3-2001/episode-20-road-to-europe/14647450|archivedate=October 24, 2008|publisher=[[RealNetworks]]|website=Film.com|title=Family Guy: Road to Europe|accessdate=October 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Series regular Greg Colton then took over Povenmire's role as director of the "Road to" episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.film.com/tv/family-guy/season-8-2008/episode-3-road-to-germany/23570232|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091017073610/http://www.film.com/tv/family-guy/season-8-2008/episode-3-road-to-germany/23570232|archivedate=October 17, 2009|publisher=RealNetworks|website=Film.com|title=Family Guy: Road to Germany|accessdate=August 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Road to" episodes are generally considered by critics and fans to be some of the greatest in the series, thanks to the developing relationship between Stewie and Brian, and the strong plotlines of the episodes themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2010/01/12/family-guy-stewie-and-brians-greatest-adventures |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111010101/http://uk.ign.com/articles/2010/01/12/family%2Dguy%2Dstewie%2Dand%2Dbrians%2Dgreatest%2Dadventures|archivedate=January 11, 2010|publisher=IGN|website=IGN|title=Family Guy: Stewie and Brian's Greatest Adventures |dead-url=yes |accessdate=December 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humor===
''Family Guy'' uses the filmmaking technique of [[Cutaway (filmmaking)|cutaways]], which occur in the majority of ''Family Guy'' episodes.&lt;ref name=fhm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fhm.com/reviews/tv/seth-macfarlane--exclusive-interview-with-the-family-guy-guy-20090624 |title=''Family Guy''{{'}}s Seth MacFarlane interviewed! |website=[[FHM]] |date=June 24, 2009 |accessdate=September 24, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831065643/http://www.fhm.com/reviews/tv/seth-macfarlane--exclusive-interview-with-the-family-guy-guy-20090624 |archivedate=August 31, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Emphasis is often placed on gags which make reference to current events and/or modern cultural icons.

Early episodes based much of their comedy on Stewie's "super villain" antics, such as his constant plans for total world domination, his evil experiments, plans and inventions to get rid of things he dislikes, and his constant attempts at [[matricide]]. As the series progressed, the writers and MacFarlane agreed that his personality and the jokes were starting to feel dated, so they began writing him with a different personality.&lt;ref name=matee/&gt; ''Family Guy'' often includes [[Meta-reference|self-referential]] humor. The most common form is jokes about Fox Broadcasting, and occasions where the characters [[Fourth wall|break the fourth wall]] by addressing the audience. For example, in "[[North by North Quahog]]", the first episode that aired after the show's revival, included Peter telling the family that they had been canceled because Fox had to make room in their schedule for shows like ''[[Dark Angel (2000 TV series)|Dark Angel]]'', ''[[Titus (TV series)|Titus]]'', ''[[Undeclared]]'', ''[[Action (TV series)|Action]]'', ''[[That '80s Show]]'', ''[[Wonderfalls]]'', ''[[Fastlane (TV series)|Fastlane]]'', ''[[Andy Richter Controls the Universe]]'', ''[[Skin (TV series)|Skin]]'', ''[[Girls Club (TV series)|Girls Club]]'', ''[[Cracking Up (TV series)|Cracking Up]]'', ''[[The Pitts]]'', ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', ''[[Get Real (U.S. TV series)|Get Real]]'', ''[[Freakylinks]]'', ''[[Wanda at Large]]'', ''[[Costello (TV series)|Costello]]'', ''[[The Lone Gunmen (TV series)|The Lone Gunmen]]'', ''[[A Minute with Stan Hooper]]'', ''[[Normal, Ohio]]'', ''[[Pasadena (TV series)|Pasadena]]'', ''[[Harsh Realm]]'', ''[[Keen Eddie]]'', ''[[The $treet]]'', ''[[The American Embassy]]'', ''[[Cedric the Entertainer Presents]]'', ''[[The Tick (2001 TV series)|The Tick]]'', ''[[Luis (TV series)|Luis]]'', and ''[[Greg the Bunny]]''. Lois asks whether there is any hope, to which Peter replies that if all these shows are canceled they might have a chance; the shows were indeed canceled during ''Family Guy''{{'}}s hiatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/2005/04/28/2005-04-28__dad__joins_macfarlane_s__fa.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206165055/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/2005/04/28/2005-04-28__dad__joins_macfarlane_s__fa.html|archivedate=December 6, 2010|title='Dad' Joins MacFarlane's 'Family'|work=New York Daily News|author=Bianculli, David|date=April 28, 2005|accessdate=September 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Back in the Fold|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=April 28, 2005|page=W37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=An amazing comeback cartoon&amp;nbsp;— Why Fox resurrected Family Guy|work=[[The Record (Bergen County)|The Record]]|location=Bergen County, New Jersey|date=May 1, 2005|author=Rohan, Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show uses [[catchphrase]]s, and most of the primary and secondary characters have them. Notable expressions include Quagmire's "Giggity giggity goo", Peter's "Freakin' sweet", Cleveland's "Oh, that's nasty", and Joe's "Bring it on!"&lt;ref name=matee&gt;{{cite web|publisher=New Corporation|website=IGN|author=Haque, Ahsan|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/987/987014p8.html|title= Top 25 Family Guy Characters|accessdate=May 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of many of these catchphrases declined in later seasons. The episode "[[Big Man on Hippocampus]]" mocks catchphrase-based humor: when Peter, who has forgotten everything about his life, is introduced to Meg, he exclaims "[[D'oh!]]", to which Lois replies, "No, Peter, that's not your catchphrase."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20318518,00.html |title=Tiffani Thiessen Is Expecting a Baby |publisher=Time Inc.|website=[[People (magazine)|People Magazine]] |author=Jordan, Julie |accessdate=September 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and legacy==
In 2016, a ''[[The New York Times]]'' study of the 50 TV shows with the most [[Facebook Like]]s found that like other satirical comedies, ''Family Guy'' "is most popular in cities. The show's popularity was more correlated with [[United States presidential election, 2016|support for Hillary Clinton]] than any other show".&lt;ref name="katz20161227"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/26/upshot/duck-dynasty-vs-modern-family-television-maps.html |title=‘Duck Dynasty’ vs. ‘Modern Family’: 50 Maps of the U.S. Cultural Divide |last=Katz |first=Josh |date=December 27, 2016 |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2008, the franchise has generated {{US$|1 billion|long=no}} in total revenue, including {{US$|400 million|long=no}} from [[TV syndication]], {{US$|400 million|long=no}} from [[DVD]] sales, and {{US$|200 million|long=no}} from merchandise sales.&lt;ref name="foxnews"/&gt;

One of the initial critics to give the show negative reviews was Ken Tucker from ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''; he called it "''The Simpsons'' as conceived by a singularly sophomoric mind that lacks any reference point beyond other TV shows".&lt;ref name="ew"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,273010,00.html|title=Family Guy|last=Tucker|first=Ken|date=June 9, 1999|publisher=Time Warner |work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=July 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Parents Television Council]] (PTC), a conservative non-profit [[Watchdog journalism|watchdog]], has attacked the series since its premiere and has branded various episodes as "Worst TV Show of the Week".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/publications/bw/2005/0123worst.asp| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070806125717/http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/publications/bw/2005/0123worst.asp| archivedate = August 6, 2007| title = Worst TV Show of the Week-Family Guy| website = [[Parents Television Council]]|last=Bowling|first=Aubree| accessdate =July 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.parentstv.org/ptc/publications/bw/2005/1229worst.asp| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080123075851/http://www.parentstv.org/ptc/publications/bw/2005/1229worst.asp| archivedate = January 23, 2008| title = Family Guy| website = Parents Television Council|last=Schulenburg|first=Caroline| accessdate =June 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/publications/bw/2007/0406worst.asp| title = Family Guy on Fox| website = Parents Television Council|last=Shirlen|first=Josh| accessdate =July 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2000 the PTC launched a letter-writing campaign to the Fox network in an effort to persuade the network to cancel the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parentstv.org/publications/cyberbites/ecyb20000505.html |title=E-Alerts |website=Parents Television Council |accessdate=July 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010702021728/http://www.parentstv.org/publications/cyberbites/ecyb20000505.html |archivedate=July 2, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The PTC has placed the show on their annual lists of "Worst Prime-Time Shows for Family Viewing" in 2000, 2005, and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/publications/reports/top10bestandworst/2000top/main.asp |title=PTC's Annual Top 10 Best &amp; Worst Family Shows on Network Television 1999–2000 TV Season |website=Parents Television Council |accessdate=July 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061212220452/http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/publications/reports/top10bestandworst/2000top/main.asp |archivedate=December 12, 2006 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parentstv.org/ptc/publications/reports/top10bestandworst/2005/main.asp |title=Top Ten Best and Worst Shows for family viewing on prime time broadcast television |website=Parents Television Council |date=October 19, 2005 |accessdate=July 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523142544/http://www.parentstv.org/ptc/publications/reports/top10bestandworst/2005/main.asp |archivedate=May 23, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parentstv.org/ptc/publications/reports/top10bestandworst/2006/main.asp |title=Rating the Top 20 Most Popular Prime Time Broadcast TV Shows Watched by Children Ages 2–17 |website=Parents Television Council |accessdate=June 28, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613060721/http://www.parentstv.org/ptc/publications/reports/top10bestandworst/2006/main.asp |archivedate=June 13, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Federal Communications Commission]] has received multiple petitions requesting that the show be blocked from broadcasting on [[Communications Decency Act|indecency]] grounds.&lt;ref name="Content2005"&gt;{{cite web|title=Content examples from NCIS, Family Guy, and The Vibe Awards|website=Parents Television Council|url=http://www.parentstv.org/ptc/action/sweeps/content.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916203532/http://www.parentstv.org/ptc/action/sweeps/content.htm|archivedate=September 16, 2012|accessdate=July 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tucker and the PTC have both accused the show of portraying religion negatively, and of being racist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,272168,00.html| title = The Worst/TV: 1999

Various episodes of the show have generated controversy. In "[[420 (Family Guy)|420]]" ([[Family Guy (season 7)|season seven]], 2009) Brian decides to start a campaign to [[Legality of cannabis#United States|legalize cannabis]] in Quahog; the [[Venezuelan government]] reacted negatively to the episode and banned ''Family Guy'' from airing on their local networks, which generally syndicate American programming.

===Books===
'''''Family Guy: It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One''''' was written by executive story editor [[Cherry Chevapravatdumrong]] and actress [[Alex Borstein]]. The book was first published on May 8, 2007.&lt;ref name="Publication"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/books/9780061143328/Family_Guy_It_takes_a_Village_Idiot_and_I_Married_One/index.aspx|title=Family Guy: It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|accessdate=December 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is a biographical monologue by Lois Griffin discussing her memories of growing up and to her attempted run for mayor in the town of Quahog. Though the book primarily consists of a loose narrative monologue by Lois, it is also interspersed with sections from other characters such as Peter Griffin. The book covers events featured in the ''Family Guy'' episode "[[It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One]]", with which it shares a title. It was published in the United Kingdom in 2007 by [[Orion Books]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orionbooks.co.uk/PB-39566/Family-Guy:-It-Takes-A-Village-Idiot-And-I-Married-One.htm It Takes A Village Idiot, And I Married One].

===Live performances===
As promotion for the show, and, as Newman described, "[to] expand interest in the show beyond its diehard fans",&lt;ref name="VarietyLive!"/&gt; Fox organized four ''Family Guy Live!'' performances, which featured cast members reading old episodes aloud. The cast also performed musical numbers from the ''[[Family Guy: Live in Vegas]]'' comedy album.&lt;ref name="VarietyLive!"&gt;{{cite news|title=Family Guy Center Stage|work=Variety|date=March 10, 2005|author=Adalian, Josef|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stage shows were an extension of a performance by the cast during the 2004 [[Montreal Comedy Festival]].&lt;ref name="VarietyLive!"/&gt; The ''Family Guy Live!'' performances, which took place in Los Angeles and New York, sold out and were attended by around 1,200 people each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,155143,00.html|author=Associated Press|title='Family Guy' Returns to FOX|publisher=Fox News|date=April 30, 2005|accessdate=July 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, at the [[59th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards]], MacFarlane performed (as the digitally inserted Stewie and Brian) the ceremony's opening number. He performed a song insulting modern television to the tune of the song "The Fellas At The Freakin' F.C.C." performed in the episode ''[[PTV (Family Guy)|PTV]]''. The song insulted TV shows such as ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'', ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'', and ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'', as well as the [[Made in America (The Sopranos)|final scene]] of ''[[The Sopranos]]''.

In 2009, a special televised performance show aired entitled ''Family Guy Presents Seth &amp; Alex's Almost Live Comedy Show'', in which voice actors [[Alex Borstein]] and MacFarlane performed songs from the show, as well as a parody of [[Lady Gaga]]'s song "[[Poker Face (Lady Gaga song)|Poker Face]]" in the voice of [[Marlee Matlin]], who appeared on stage as a guest during the performance. Some new animated gags also appeared in the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tucker |first=Ken |url=http://watching-tv.ew.com/2009/11/08/seth-macfarlane-comedy-show |title=Family Guy Presents Seth &amp; Alex's Almost Live Comedy Show': Almost pretty funny |website=Entertainment Weekly  |date=January 24, 2011 |accessdate=January 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ferdinand II, Archduke of Further Austria''' ([[Linz]], 14 June 1529 &amp;ndash; 24 January 1595, [[Innsbruck]]) was ruler of [[Further Austria]] including [[Tyrol (state)|Tirol]]. The son of [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor]], he was married to [[Philippine Welser]] in his first marriage. In his second marriage to [[Anna Juliana Gonzaga]], he was the father of [[Anna of Tyrol]], the would-be [[Holy Roman Empress]].

==Life account==
[[Image:William Scrots 002.jpg|thumb|left|Archduke Ferdinand at a young age]][[File:New-reformierte-Landts-Ordnung-der-fürstlichen-Grafschafft-Tyrol-1573 MG 0965.tif|thumb|Engraving of Ferdinand, published in ''New Reformierte Landts-Ordnung Der Fürstlichen Graffschafft Tyrol Wie Die Auss Lands-Fürstlichem Befelch, Im 1603'']]
Archduke Ferdinand of Austria was the second son of [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor]] and [[Anna of Bohemia and Hungary]]. He was a younger brother of Emperor [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]]. At the behest of his father, he was put in charge of the administration of [[Bohemia]] in 1547. He also led the campaign against the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] in [[Hungary]] in 1556.

In 1557 he was secretly married to Philippine [[Welser]], daughter of a patrician from [[Augsburg]], with whom he had several children. The marriage was only accepted by Emperor Ferdinand I in 1559 under the condition of secrecy. The children were to receive the name "of Austria" but would only be entitled to inherit if the House of [[Habsburg]] became totally extinct in the male line, and thus the marriage had many qualities of a [[morganatic marriage]]. The sons born of this marriage received the title [[Margrave of Burgau]], after the [[Margraviate of Burgau]], an ancient Habsburg possession in Further Austria. The younger of the sons, who survived their father, later received the princely title of ''Fürst zu Burgau''.

After his father's death in 1564, Ferdinand became the ruler of [[Tyrol (state)|Tirol]] and other [[Further Austria]]n possessions under his father's will. However, he remained governor of Bohemia in [[Prague]] until 1567 according to the wishes of his brother Maximilian II.

In his own lands, Ferdinand made sure that the Catholic [[counter-reformation]] would prevail. He also was instrumental in promoting the Renaissance in central Europe and was an avid collector of art. He accommodated his world-famous collections in a museum built specifically for that purpose, making [[Castle Ambras|Ambras Castle Innsbruck]] the oldest museum in the world, and as the only Renaissance Kunstkammer of its kind to have been preserved at its original location, the Chamber of Art and Curiosities at Ambras Castle Innsbruck represents an unrivalled cultural monument.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} The collection was started during Ferdinand's time in Bohemia and he subsequently moved it to Tyrol. In particular, the Chamber of Art and Curiosities, the gallery of portraits, and the collection of armor were very expensive, leading Ferdinand to incurred a high level of debt. Part of collections remained in Innsbruck, and part ultimately was moved to the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in [[Vienna]]. 

After the death of his wife Philippine in 1580, he married [[Anna Caterina Gonzaga]], a daughter of [[William I, Duke of Mantua]], in 1582.

Archduke Ferdinand died on 24 January 1595. Since his sons from the first marriage were not entitled to the inheritance, and the second produced only surviving daughters, Tirol was reunified with the other Habsburg lands. His daughter from the Mantuan marriage to Anna Caterina (later Anna Juliana) became [[Anna of Tyrol|Holy Roman Empress Anna]], consort of [[Emperor Mathias]], who received his Further Austrian inheritance.

==Children==

He and his first wife [[Philippine Welser]] were parents of four children:

[[File:Eli Pariser, author of The Filter Bubble - Flickr - Knight Foundation (1).jpg|thumb|The term was coined by Internet activist [[Eli Pariser]] circa 2010]]
A '''filter bubble''' – a term coined by Internet activist [[Eli Pariser]] – is a state of intellectual isolation&lt;ref name=twsTechnoP101&gt;Technopedia, [https://www.techopedia.com/definition/28556/filter-bubble Definition – What does Filter Bubble mean?], Retrieved October 10, 2017, "....A filter bubble is the intellectual isolation that can occur when websites make use of algorithms to selectively assume the information a user would want to see, and then give information to the user according to this assumption ...

[[File:Filter bubble illustration.png|thumb|350px|Social media, seeking to please users, can shunt information that they guess their users will like hearing, but inadvertently isolate what they know into their own ''filter bubbles'', according to Pariser.]]
The term was [[Neologism|coined]] by [[Internet activism|Internet activist]] [[Eli Pariser]] circa 2010 and discussed in his 2011 book of the same name; according to Pariser, users get less exposure to conflicting viewpoints and are isolated intellectually in their own informational bubble. He related an example in which one user searched Google for "BP" and got investment news about [[British Petroleum]], while another searcher got information about the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]], and noted that the two search results pages were "strikingly different".&lt;ref name=twsT43&gt;{{cite news|first1= Lynn | last1= Parramore|title= The Filter Bubble|work= The Atlantic|quote= Since Dec. 4, 2009, Google has been personalized for everyone.

Pariser defined his concept of a filter bubble in more formal terms as "that personal [[ecosystem]] of [[information]] that's been catered by these algorithms".&lt;ref name=twsT43/&gt;  An Internet user's past browsing and search history is built up over time when they indicate interest in topics by "clicking links, viewing friends, putting movies in [their] queue, reading news stories", and so forth.&lt;ref name=twsO15/&gt; An Internet firm then uses this information to [[targeted advertising|target advertising]] to the user, or make certain types of information appear more prominently in [[search engine results page|search results pages]].&lt;ref name=twsO15 /&gt; This process is not random either, and it operates under three step process. According to Eli Pariser's book, the process states, "First, you figure out who people are and what they like. Then, you provide them with content and services that best fit them. Finally, you tune to get the fit just right. Your identity shapes your media."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wcalrOI1YbQC&amp;pg=PT82&amp;lpg=PT82&amp;dq=Most+personalized+filters+are+based+on+a+three-|title=The Filter Bubble: How the New Personalized Web Is Changing What We Read and How We Think|last=Pariser|first=Eli|date=2011-05-12|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9781101515129|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This portrays how we are allowing the media to formulate our thoughts because of the repeated messages we encounter daily.

How the filter bubbles and algorithms work according to a Wall Street Journal Study is, "the top 50 Internet sites install 64 data-laden cookies and personal tracking beacons or tracking algorithms as stated above."&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fs.blog/2017/07/filter-bubbles/|title=How Filter Bubbles Distort Reality: Everything You Need to Know|last=Parrish|first=Shane|date=2017-07-31|website=https://www.fs.blog/2017/07/filter-bubbles/|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google specifically has 57 algorithms for the purpose of tailoring your searches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Pariser|first=Eli|title=Beware online "filter bubbles"|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/eli_pariser_beware_online_filter_bubbles|language=en|accessdate=2018-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, searching a word like "depression" on Dictionary.com allows the site to install over 200 tracking algorithms on your computer so that websites can target you with antidepressants.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Other terms have been used to describe this phenomenon, including "[[ideological frame]]s"&lt;ref name=twsO11/&gt; and "the figurative sphere surrounding you as you search the Internet".&lt;ref name=twsO15&gt;{{cite news|first= Shira | last= Lazar|title= Algorithms and the Filter Bubble Ruining Your Online Experience?|work= Huffington Post|quote= a filter bubble is the figurative sphere surrounding you as you search the Internet.|date= June 1, 2011|url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/shira-lazar/algorithms-and-the-filter_b_869473.html|accessdate= August 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A related term, "[[Echo chamber (media)|echo chamber]]", was originally applied to news media,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2004/6/24/12059/5698 |title=John Gorenfeld, Moon the Messiah, and the Media Echo Chamber |website=[[Daily Kos]] |author=sdf |date=2004-06-23 |accessdate=2017-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jamieson |first1=Kathleen Hall |author-link1=Kathleen Hall Jamieson |last2=Cappella |first2=Joseph N. |title=Echo Chamber: Rush Limbaugh and the Conservative Media Establishment |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=139Oa4MOsAgC |isbn=978-0-19-536682-2 |date=2008-07-22 |access-date=2017-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is now applied to social media as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Hosanagar |first1=Kartik |title=Blame the Echo Chamber on Facebook.

Pariser's idea of the filter bubble was popularized after the [[TED talk]] he gave in May 2011, in which he gives examples of how filter bubbles work and where they can be seen. In a test seeking to demonstrate the filter bubble effect, Pariser asked several friends to search for the word "Egypt" on Google and send him the results. Comparing two of the friends' first pages of results, while there was overlap between them on topics like news and travel, one friend's results prominently included links to information on the then-ongoing [[Egyptian revolution of 2011]], while the other friend's first page of results did not include such links.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ted.com/talks/eli_pariser_beware_online_filter_bubbles |title=Beware online 'filter bubbles' |last=Pariser |first=Eli |website=[[TED (conference)|TED.com]] |date=March 2011 |access-date=2017-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Filter Bubble'', Pariser warns that a potential downside to filtered searching is that it "closes us off to new ideas, subjects, and important information",&lt;ref name=twsT41&gt;{{cite news|title= First Monday: What's on tap this month on TV and in movies and books: The Filter Bubble by Eli Pariser|work= USA Today|quote= Pariser explains that feeding us only what is familiar and comfortable to us closes us off to new ideas, subjects and important information.|year= 2011|url= https://www.usatoday.com/money/companies/management/monday/2011-04-29-first-monday-business-media-in-may_n.htm|accessdate= April 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "creates the impression that our narrow self-interest is all that exists".&lt;ref name=twsO11/&gt; It is potentially harmful to both individuals and society, in his view. He criticized [[Google]] and [[Facebook]] for offering users "too much candy, and not enough carrots".&lt;ref name=twsT42&gt;{{cite news|first=Bianca|last=Bosker|title=Facebook, Google Giving Us Information Junk Food, Eli Pariser Warns|work=Huffington Post|quote=When it comes to content, Google and Facebook are offering us too much candy, and not enough carrots.|date=March 7, 2011|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/07/eli-pariser-facebook-google-ted_n_832198.html|accessdate=April 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He warned that "invisible algorithmic editing of the web" may limit our exposure to new information and narrow our outlook.&lt;ref name=twsT42/&gt; According to Pariser, the detrimental effects of filter bubbles include harm to the general society in the sense that they have the possibility of "undermining civic discourse" and making people more vulnerable to "propaganda and manipulation".&lt;ref name=twsO11/&gt; He wrote:

Many people are unaware that filter bubbles even exist. This can be seen in an article on The Guardian, which mentioned the fact that "more than 60% of Facebook users are entirely unaware of any curation on Facebook at all, believing instead that every single story from their friends and followed pages appeared in their news feed."&lt;ref name="Hern"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/22/social-media-election-facebook-filter-bubbles|title=How social media filter bubbles and algorithms influence the election|last=Hern|date=2017-05-22|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; A brief explanation for how Facebook decides what goes on a user's news feed is through an algorithm which takes into account "how you have interacted with similar posts in the past."&lt;ref name="Hern"/&gt;

A filter bubble has been described as exacerbating a phenomenon that has been called ''[[splinternet]]'' or ''cyberbalkanization'',&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The term ''cyber-balkanization'' (sometimes with a hyphen) is a hybrid of ''cyber'', relating to the Internet, and ''[[Balkanization]]'', referring to that region of Europe that was historically subdivided by languages, religions and cultures; the term was coined in a paper by [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] researchers Van Alstyne and Brynjolfsson.&lt;/ref&gt; which happens when the Internet becomes divided up into sub-groups of like-minded people who become insulated within their own online community and fail to get exposure to different views.  This concern dates back to the early days of the publicly accessible Internet, with the term "cyberbalkanization" being coined in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Van Alstyne |first1=Marshall |last2=Brynjolfsson |first2=Erik |title=Electronic Communities: Global Village or Cyberbalkans? |url=http://web.mit.edu/marshall/www/papers/CyberBalkans.pdf |date=March 1997 |orig-year=Copyright 1996 |access-date=2017-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Van Alstyne |first1=Marshall |last2=Brynjolfsson |first2=Erik |title=Could the Internet Balkanize Science? |journal=Science |date=November 1996 |volume=274 |issue=5292 |pages=1479–1480 |doi=10.1126/science.274.5292.1479 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/274/5292/1479.summary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="twsChicagoTribLATimes"&gt;{{cite web

{{Further|Echo chamber (media)}}
In [[news media]], '''echo chamber''' is a metaphorical description of a situation in which beliefs are amplified or reinforced by communication and repetition inside a closed system. By visiting an "echo chamber", people are able to seek out information which reinforces their existing views, potentially as an unconscious exercise of [[confirmation bias]]. This may increase political and social polarization and extremism.The term is a metaphor based on the acoustic [[echo chamber]], where sounds [[Reverberation|reverberate]] in a hollow enclosure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Echo chamber (media)|date=2018-10-05|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Echo_chamber_(media)&amp;oldid=862590835|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barack Obama's farewell address]] identified a similar concept to filter bubbles as a "threat to [Americans'] democracy", i.e., the "retreat into our own bubbles, ...especially our social media feeds, surrounded by people who look like us and share the same political outlook and never challenge our assumptions... And increasingly we become so secure in our bubbles that we start accepting only information, whether it's true or not, that fits our opinions, instead of basing our opinions on the evidence that is out there."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech

==Reactions and studies==

=== Media reactions ===
There are conflicting reports about the extent to which personalized filtering is happening and whether such activity is beneficial or harmful. Analyst Jacob Weisberg, writing in June 2011 for ''[[Slate Magazine|Slate]]'', did a small non-scientific experiment to test Pariser's theory which involved five associates with different ideological backgrounds conducting a series of searches, "[[John Boehner]]", "[[Barney Frank]]", "[[Ryan plan]]", and "[[Obamacare]]", and sending Weisberg screenshots of their results.  The results varied only in minor respects from person to person, and any differences did not appear to be ideology-related, leading Weisberg to conclude that a filter bubble was not in effect, and to write that the idea that most Internet users were "feeding at the trough of a ''[[Daily Me]]''" was overblown.&lt;ref name="twsO11" /&gt;  Weisberg asked Google to comment, and a spokesperson stated that algorithms were in place to deliberately "limit personalization and promote variety".&lt;ref name="twsO11" /&gt;  Book reviewer Paul Boutin did a similar experiment to Weisberg's among people with differing search histories, and again found that the different searchers received nearly identical search results.&lt;ref name="twsO13" /&gt; Interviewing programmers at Google off the record journalist Per Grankvist found that user data used to play a bigger role in determining search results but that Google, through testing, found that the search query is by far the best determinator on what results to display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grankvist|first1=Per|title=The Big Bubble: How Technology Makes It Harder to Understand the World|publisher=United Stories Publishing|isbn=978-9163959905|pages=179|date=2018-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are reports that Google and other sites maintain vast "dossiers" of information on their users which might enable them to further personalize individual Internet experiences if they chose to do so. For instance, the technology exists for Google to keep track of users' past histories even if they don't have a personal Google account or are not logged into one.&lt;ref name="twsO13" /&gt; One report stated that Google had collected "10 years' worth" of information amassed from varying sources, such as [[Gmail]], [[Google Maps]], and other services besides its search engine,&lt;ref name="twsO14" /&gt;{{failed verification|date=October 2017}} although a contrary report was that trying to personalize the Internet for each user was technically challenging for an Internet firm to achieve despite the huge amounts of available data.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Analyst Doug Gross of [[CNN]] suggested that filtered searching seemed to be more helpful for [[consumer]]s than for ''[[citizenship|citizens]]'', and would help a consumer looking for "pizza" find local delivery options based on a personalized search and appropriately filter out distant pizza stores.&lt;ref name="twsO14" /&gt;{{failed verification|date=October 2017}} Organizations such as the ''[[Washington Post]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', and others have experimented with creating new personalized information services, with the aim of tailoring search results to those that users are likely to like or agree with.&lt;ref name="twsO11" /&gt;

A scientific study from [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|Wharton]] that analyzed [[recommender system|personalized recommendations]] also found that these filters can actually create commonality, not fragmentation, in online music taste.&lt;ref name="Fleder" /&gt; Consumers reportedly use the filters to expand their taste rather than to limit it.&lt;ref name="Fleder"&gt;{{cite journal| last1= Hosanagar | first1= Kartik | first2= Daniel |last2= Fleder | first3= Dokyun | last3= Lee | first4= Andreas | last4= Buja |title=Will the Global Village Fracture into Tribes: Recommender Systems and their Effects on Consumers|journal=Management Science, Forthcoming |date=December 2013|ssrn=1321962}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harvard law professor [[Jonathan Zittrain]] disputed the extent to which personalization filters distort [[Google]] search results, saying that "the effects of search personalization have been light".&lt;ref name="twsO11" /&gt; Further, Google provides the ability for users to shut off personalization features if they choose,&lt;ref name="twsO12"&gt;{{cite news|first=Amber|last=Ludwig|title=Google Personalization on Your Search Results Plus How to Turn it Off|publisher=NGNG|quote=Google customizing search results is an automatic feature, but you can shut this feature off.|url=http://insightfuldevelopment.com/turn-off-google-personalized-search-results.html|accessdate=August 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; by deleting Google's record of their search history and setting Google to not remember their search keywords and visited links in the future.&lt;ref name="twsO13" /&gt;

A study by researchers from Oxford, Stanford, and Microsoft examined the browsing histories of 1.2 million U.S. users of the [[Bing Toolbar]] add-on for Internet Explorer between March and May 2013.  They selected 50,000 of those users who were active consumers of news, then classified whether the news outlets they visited were left- or right-leaning, based on whether the majority of voters in the counties associated with user IP addresses voted for Obama or Romney in the 2012 presidential election.  They then identified whether news stories were read after accessing the publisher's site directly, via the Google News aggregation service, via web searches, or via social media.  The researchers found that while web searches and social media do contribute to ideological segregation, the vast majority of online news consumption consisted of users directly visiting left- or right-leaning mainstream news sites, and consequently being exposed almost exclusively to views from a single side of the political spectrum.  Limitations of the study included selection issues such as Internet Explorer users skewing higher in age than the general Internet population; Bing Toolbar usage and the voluntary (or unknowing) sharing of browsing history selecting for users who are less concerned about privacy; the assumption that all stories in left-leaning publications are left-leaning, and the same for right-leaning; and the possibility that users who are ''not'' active news consumers may get most of their news via social media, and thus experience stronger effects of social or algorithmic bias than those users who essentially self-select their bias through their choice of news publications (assuming they are aware of the publications' biases).&lt;ref name="Flaxman"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flaxman|first1=Seth|last2=Sharad|first2=Goel|last3=Rao|first3=Justin M.|date=2016-03-22|title=Filter Bubbles, Echo Chambers, and Online News Consumption|url=https://5harad.com/papers/bubbles.pdf|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|volume=80|issue=Special Issue|pages=298–320|doi=10.1093/poq/nfw006|accessdate=2017-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While algorithms do limit political diversity, some of the filter bubble is the result of user choice.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://techland.time.com/2011/05/16/5-questions-with-eli-pariser-author-of-the-filter-bubble/|title=5 Questions with Eli Pariser, Author of 'The Filter Bubble'|last=|first=|date=|work=Time|access-date=2017-05-24|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a study by data scientists at Facebook, they found that for every four Facebook friends that share ideology, users have one friend with contrasting views.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2015/05/13/political-polarization-on-facebook/|title=Political polarization on Facebook {{!}} Brookings Institution|last=West|first=Joshua Bleiberg and Darrell M.|date=2017-05-24|work=Brookings|access-date=2017-05-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bakshy|first=Eytan|last2=Messing|first2=Solomon|last3=Adamic|first3=Lada|date=2015-05-07|title=Exposure to ideologically diverse news and opinion on Facebook|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2015/05/08/science.aaa1160|journal=Science|volume=348|issue=6239|language=en|pages=1130–2|doi=10.1126/science.aaa1160|issn=0036-8075|pmid=25953820}}&lt;/ref&gt;  No matter what Facebook's algorithm for its [[List of Facebook features#News Feed|News Feed]] is, people are simply more likely to befriend/follow people who share similar beliefs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The nature of the algorithm is that it ranks stories based on a user's history, resulting in a reduction of the "politically cross-cutting content by 5 percent for conservatives and 8 percent for liberals".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  However, even when people are given the option to click on a link offering contrasting views, they still default to their most viewed sources.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  "[U]ser choice decreases the likelihood of clicking on a cross-cutting link by 17 percent for conservatives and 6 percent for liberals."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A cross-cutting link is one that introduces a different point of view than the user's presumed point of view, or what the website has pegged as the user's beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3046111/why-scientists-are-upset-over-the-facebook-filter-bubble-study|title=Why Scientists Are Upset About The Facebook Filter Bubble Study|last=Lumb|date=2015-05-08|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Facebook study found that it was "inconclusive" whether or not the algorithm played as big a role in filtering [[News Feed]]s as people assumed.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@elipariser/fun-facts-from-the-new-facebook-filter-bubble-study-444d4a658f5d|title=Fun facts from the new Facebook filter bubble study|last=Pariser|first=Eli|date=May 7, 2015|website=Medium|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study also found that "individual choice", or confirmation bias, likewise affected what gets filtered out of News Feeds.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Some social scientists criticized this conclusion though, because the point of protesting the filter bubble is that the algorithms and individual choice work together to filter out News Feeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3046111/why-scientists-are-upset-over-the-facebook-filter-bubble-study|title=Why Scientists Are Upset About The Facebook Filter Bubble Study|last=Lumb|first=David|date=May 8, 2015|website=Fast Company|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also criticized Facebook's small sample size, which is about "9% of actual Facebook users", and the fact that the study results are "not reproducible" due to the fact that the study was conducted by "Facebook scientists" who had access to data that Facebook does not make available to outside researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/05/did-facebooks-big-study-kill-my-filter-bubble-thesis/|title=Did Facebook's Big Study Kill My Filter Bubble Thesis?|last=Pariser|first=Eli|date=May 7, 2015|journal=Wired|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the study found that only about 15–20% of the average user's Facebook friends subscribe to the opposite side of the political spectrum, Julia Kaman from [[Vox (website)|Vox]] theorized that this could have potentially positive implications for viewpoint diversity. These "friends" are often acquaintances with whom we would not likely share our politics without the [[Internet]]. Facebook may foster a unique environment where a user sees and possibly interacts with content posted or re-posted by these "second-tier" friends. The study found that "24 percent of the news items liberals saw were conservative-leaning and 38 percent of the news conservatives saw was liberal-leaning."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2016/12/28/14095452/fake-news-political-bubbles-democracy-facebook|title=Contrary to what you've heard, Facebook can help puncture our political "bubbles"|work=Vox|access-date=2018-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Liberals tend to be connected to fewer friends who share information from the other side, compared with their conservative counterparts."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6239/1130|title=Exposure to ideologically diverse news and opinion on Facebook|journal=Science|volume=348|issue=6239|pages=1130–1132|doi=10.1126/science.aaa1160|pmid=25953820|year=2015|last1=Bakshy|first1=E.|last2=Messing|first2=S.|last3=Adamic|first3=L. A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This interplay has the ability to provide diverse information and sources that could moderate users' views.

Similarly, a study of [[Twitter]]'s filter bubbles by [[New York University]] concluded that "Individuals now have access to a wider span of viewpoints about news events, and most of this information is not coming through the traditional channels, but either directly from political actors or through their friends and relatives. Furthermore, the interactive nature of [[social media]] creates opportunities for individuals to discuss political events with their peers, including those with whom they have weak social ties".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barberá|first=Pabló|date=August 2015|title=How Social Media Reduces Mass Political Polarization. Evidence from Germany, Spain, and the U.S.|journal=Wall Street Journal|volume=|pages=|citeseerx=10.1.1.658.5476}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to these studies, social media may be diversifying information and opinions users come into contact with, though there is much speculation around filter bubbles and their ability to create deeper [[Polarization (politics)|political polarization]].

When filter bubbles are in place they can create specific moments that scientists call 'Whoa' moments. A 'Whoa' moment is when an article, ad, post, etc. appears on your computer that is in relation to a current action or current use of an object. Scientists discovered this term after a young woman was performing her daily routine, which included drinking coffee, when she opened her computer and noticed an advertisement for the same brand of coffee that she was drinking. "Sat down and opened up Facebook this morning while having my coffee, and there they were two ads for [[Nespresso]]. Kind of a 'whoa' moment when the product you're drinking pops up on the screen in front of you."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bucher|first=Taina|date=25 Feb 2016|title=The algorithmic imaginary: exploring the ordinary affects of Facebook algorithms|url=|journal=Information, Communication, &amp; Society|volume=20|pages=|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Whoa' moments occur when people are "found." Which means advertisement algorithms target specific users based on their 'click behavior' in order to increase their sale revenue. 'Whoa' moments can also ignite discipline in users to stick to a routine and commonality with a product.

Several designers have developed tools to counteract the effects of filter bubbles (see {{section link||Counter measures}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How do we break filter bubble and design for democracy? |url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/wfd/engin-bozdag/how-do-we-break-filter-bubble-and-design-for-democracy|date=March 3, 2017|accessdate=March 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swiss radio station [[Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen|SRF]] voted the word ''filterblase'' (the German translation of filter bubble) word of the year 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=«Filterblase» ist das Wort des Jahres 2016|url=http://www.srf.ch/radio-srf-3/aktuell/filterblase-ist-das-wort-des-jahres-2016|date=December 7, 2016|accessdate=December 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Filter Bubble: What the Internet Is Hiding from You'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Eli Pariser|authorlink1=Eli Pariser|title=The Filter Bubble: What the Internet Is Hiding from You|date=May 2011|publisher=Penguin Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-59420-300-8|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; internet activist Eli Pariser highlights how the increasing occurrence of filter bubbles further emphasizes the value of one's bridging [[social capital]] as defined by Robert Putman. Indeed, while bonding capital corresponds on the one hand to the establishment of strong ties between like-minded people, thus reinforcing some sense of social homogeneity, bridging social capital on the other hand represents the creation of weak ties between people with potentially diverging interests and viewpoints, hence introducing significantly more heterogeneity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stephen Baron|author2=John Field|author3=Tom Schuller|title=Social Capital: Critical perspectives|date=November 30, 2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199243679|chapter=Social capital: A review and critique.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that sense, high bridging capital is much more likely to promote social inclusion by increasing our exposure to a space where we address the problems that transcend our niches and narrow self interests. Fostering one's bridging capital – for example by connecting with more people in an informal setting – can therefore be an effective way to reduce the influence of the filter bubble phenomenon.

Users can in fact take many actions to burst through their filter bubbles, for example by making a conscious effort to evaluate what information they are exposing themselves to, and by thinking critically about whether they are engaging with a broad range of content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.niemanlab.org/2012/07/are-we-stuck-in-filter-bubbles-here-are-five-potential-paths-out/|title=Are we stuck in filter bubbles? Here are five potential paths out|last=|first=|date=|website=Nieman Lab|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view argues that users should change the psychology of how they approach media, rather than relying on technology to counteract their biases. Users can consciously avoid news sources that are unverifiable or weak. Chris Glushko, the VP of Marketing at IAB, advocates using ''[[fact checking|fact-checking]] sites'' like ''Snopes.com'' to identify fake news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Glushko|first1=Chris|title=Pop the Personalization Filter Bubbles and Preserve Online Diversity|url=http://marketingland.com/pop-the-personalization-bubbles-205935|website=Marketing Land|accessdate=22 May 2017|date=2017-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Technology can also play a valuable role in combating filter bubbles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ritholtz|first1=Barry|title=Try Breaking Your Media Filter Bubble|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-02-02/try-breaking-your-media-filter-bubble|website=Bloomberg|accessdate=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some additional [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]] aimed to help people step out of their filter bubbles and make them aware of their  personal perspectives; thus, these media show content that contradicts with their beliefs and opinions. For instance, ''Escape Your Bubble'' asks users to indicate a specific political party they want to be more informed about.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.escapeyourbubble.com/|title=Be More Accepting of Others – EscapeYourBubble|website=escapeyourbubble.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The plug-in will then suggest articles from well-established sources to read relating to that political party, encouraging users to become more educated about the other party.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In addition to plug-ins, there are apps created with the mission of encouraging users to open their echo chambers. ''Read Across the Aisle'' is a news app that reveals whether or not users are reading from diverse new sources that include multiple perspectives.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.niemanlab.org/2017/03/a-news-app-aims-to-burst-filter-bubbles-by-nudging-readers-toward-a-more-balanced-media-diet/|title=A news app aims to burst filter bubbles by nudging readers toward a more "balanced" media diet|work=Nieman Lab|access-date=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each source is color coordinated, representing the political leaning of each article.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; When users only read news from one perspective, the app communicates that to the user and encourages readers to explore other sources with opposing viewpoints.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Although apps and plug-ins are tools humans can use, Eli Pariser stated "certainly, there is some individual responsibility here to really seek out new sources and people who aren't like you."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Since web-based advertising can further the effect of the filter bubbles by exposing users to more of the same content, users can block much advertising by deleting their search history, turning off targeted ads, and downloading browser extensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock|title=uBlock Origin – An efficient blocker for Chromium and Firefox.

In light of recent concerns about information filtering on social media, Facebook acknowledged the presence of filter bubbles and has taken strides toward removing them.&lt;ref name="Fortune.com"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Vanian |first1=Jonathan |title=Facebook Tests Related Articles Feature to Fight Filter Bubbles |url=http://fortune.com/2017/04/25/facebook-related-articles-filter-bubbles/ |website=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune.com]] |date=2017-04-25 |accessdate=2017-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017, Facebook removed personalization from its Trending Topics list in response to problems with some users not seeing highly talked-about events there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sydell|first1=Laura|title=Facebook Tweaks its 'Trending Topics' Algorithm to Better Reflect Real News|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2017/01/25/511641939/facebook-tweaks-its-trending-topics-algorithm-to-better-reflect-real-news|agency=NPR|publisher=KQED Public Media|date=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook's strategy is to reverse the Related Articles feature that it had implemented in 2013, which would post related news stories after the user read a shared article. Now, the revamped strategy would flip this process and post articles from different perspectives on the same topic. Facebook is also attempting to go through a vetting process whereby only articles from reputable sources will be shown. Along with the founder of [[Craigslist]] and a few others, Facebook has invested $14 million into efforts "to increase trust in journalism around the world, and to better inform the public conversation".&lt;ref name="Fortune.com"/&gt; The idea is that even if people are only reading posts shared from their friends, at least these posts will be credible.

Similarly, [[Google]], as of January 30, 2018, has also acknowledged the existence of a filter bubble difficulties within its platform. Because current Google searches pull algorithmically ranked results based upon "authoritativeness" and "relevancy" which show and hide certain search results, Google is seeking to combat this. By training its search engine to recognize the intent of a search inquiry rather than the literal syntax of the question, Google is attempting to limit the size of filter bubbles. As of now, the initial phase of this training will be introduced in the second quarter of 2018. Questions that involve bias and/or controversial opinions will not be addressed until a later time, prompting a larger problem that exists still: whether the search engine acts either as an arbiter of truth or as a knowledgeable guide by which to make decisions by.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://qz.com/1194566/google-is-finally-admitting-it-has-a-filter-bubble-problem/|title=Google is finally admitting it has a filter-bubble problem|last=Hao|first=Karen|work=Quartz|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017 news surfaced that Facebook, [[Mozilla]], and [[Craigslist]] Craig contributed to the majority of a $14M donation to [[City University of New York|CUNY]]'s "News Integrity Initiative," poised at eliminating fake news and creating more honest news media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/08/08/mozilla-information-trust-initiative-building-movement-fight-misinformation-online/|title=The Mozilla Information Trust Initiative: Building a movement to fight misinformation online – The Mozilla Blog|website=The Mozilla Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, in August, Mozilla, whose services host the [[Firefox]] web engine, announced the formation of the Mozilla Information Trust Initiative (MITI). The MITI would serve as a collective effort to develop products, research, and community-based solutions to combat the effects of filter bubbles and the proliferation of fake news. Mozilla's Open Innovation team leads the initiative, striving to combat misinformation, with a specific focus on the product with regards to literacy, research and creative interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/04/03/news_integrity_initiative_launched/|title=Facebook, Mozilla and Craigslist Craig fund fake news firefighter|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethical implications==
As the popularity of [[Cloud computing|cloud services]] increases, personalized [[algorithm]]s used to construct filter bubbles are expected to become more widespread.&lt;ref name="researchgate.net"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bozdag|first1=Engin|last2=Timmerman|first2=Job|title=Values in the filter bubble Ethics of Personalization Algorithms in Cloud Computing|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238369914|website=Research Gate|accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars have begun considering the effect of filter bubbles on the users of [[social media]] from an [[Ethics|ethical standpoint]], particularly concerning the areas of [[personal freedom]], [[security]], and [[Information bias (psychology)|information bias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Al-Rodhan|first1=Nayef|title=The Many Ethical Implications of Emerging Technologies|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-many-ethical-implications-of-emerging-technologies/|website=Scientific American|accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filter bubbles in popular social media and personalized search sites can determine the particular content seen by users, often without their direct consent or cognizance,&lt;ref name="researchgate.net"/&gt; due to the algorithms used to curate that content.  Critics of the use of filter bubbles speculate that individuals may lose autonomy over their own social media experience and have their identities socially constructed as a result of the pervasiveness of filter bubbles.&lt;ref name="researchgate.net"/&gt;

Technologists, social media engineers, and computer specialists have also examined the prevalence of filter bubbles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ran.org/the_filter_bubble_raises_important_issues_you_just_need_to_filter_them_out_for_yourself|title=The Filter Bubble Raises Important Issues – You Just Need to Filter Them Out For Yourself |website=Rainforest Action Network|accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Zuckerberg]], founder of Facebook, and Eli Pariser, author of ''The Filter Bubble'', have even expressed concerns regarding the risks of privacy and information polarization.&lt;ref name="marketingland.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sterling|first1=Greg|title=Mark Zuckerberg's manifesto: How Facebook will connect the world, beat fake news and pop the filter bubble|url=http://marketingland.com/zuckerbergs-manifesto-well-connect-world-beat-fake-news-pop-filter-bubble-207126|website=Marketing Land|accessdate=6 March 2017|date=2017-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Your Own Facts"&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Morozov|first1=Evgeny|title=Your Own Facts|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/12/books/review/book-review-the-filter-bubble-by-eli-pariser.html|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=6 March 2017|date=2011-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The information of the users of personalized search engines and social media platforms is not private, though some people believe it should be.&lt;ref name="marketingland.com"/&gt;  The concern over privacy has resulted in a debate as to whether or not it is moral for information technologists to take users' online activity and manipulate future exposure to related information.&lt;ref name="Your Own Facts"/&gt;

Since the content seen by individual social media users is influenced by algorithms that produce filter bubbles, users of social media platforms are more susceptible to confirmation bias,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=El-Bermawy|first1=Mostafa|title=Your Filter Bubble is Destroying Democracy|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/11/filter-bubble-destroying-democracy/|journal=Wired|accessdate=6 March 2017|date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may be exposed to biased, misleading information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Burst the "Filter Bubble" that Protects Us from Opposing Views|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/522111/how-to-burst-the-filter-bubble-that-protects-us-from-opposing-views/|website=MIT Technology Review|accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social sorting]] and other unintentional [[Discrimination|discriminatory practices]] are also anticipated as a result of personalized filtering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Borgesius|first1=Frederik|last2=Trilling|first2=Damian|last3=Möller|first3=Judith|last4=Bodó|first4=Balázs|last5=de Vreese|first5=Claes|last6=Helberger|first6=Natali|title=Should we worry about filter bubbles?|url=https://policyreview.info/articles/analysis/should-we-worry-about-filter-bubbles|journal=Internet Policy Review|accessdate=6 March 2017|date=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In light of the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 U.S. presidential election]] scholars have likewise expressed concerns about the effect of filter bubbles on [[democracy]] and democratic processes, as well as the rise of "ideological media".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; These scholars fear that users will be unable to "[think] beyond [their] narrow self-interest" as filter bubbles create personalized social feeds, isolating them from diverse points of view and their surrounding communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Filter Bubble: How the New Personalized Web is Changing What We Read and How We Think|last=Pariser|first=Eli|publisher=Penguin Press|year=2011|isbn=978-1-59420-300-8|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular interest is how filter bubbles manipulate news feeds via algorithms, which contributes to proliferation of "[[fake news]]" and may influence political leaning, including how users vote.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/28/magazine/inside-facebooks-totally-insane-unintentionally-gigantic-hyperpartisan-political-media-machine.html|title=Inside Facebook's (Totally Insane, Unintentionally Gigantic, Hyperpartisan) Political-Media Machine|last=Herrman|first=John|date=August 24, 2016|newspaper=The New York Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Revelations in March 2018 of [[Cambridge Analytica]]'s harvesting and use of user data for at least 87 million Facebook profiles during the 2016 presidential election highlight the ethical implications of filter bubbles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/technology/facebook-cambridge-analytica-explained.html|title=Facebook and Cambridge Analytica: What You Need to Know as Fallout Widens|last=Granville|first=Kevin|date=19 March 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Co-Founder and whistleblower of Cambridge Analytica Christopher Wylie, detailed how the firm had the ability to develop "psychographic" profiles of those users and use the information to shape their voting behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/10/facebook-cambridge-analytica-a-timeline-of-the-data-hijacking-scandal.html|title=Facebook-Cambridge Analytica: A timeline of the data hijacking scandal|last=Meredith|first=Sam|date=10 April 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Access to user data by third parties such as Cambridge Analytica can exasperate and amplify existing filter bubbles users have created, artificially increasing existing biases and further divide societies.

[[File:Freising manuscript.jpg|thumb|The beginning of the second Freising manuscript]]
The '''Freising manuscripts''' (also ''Freising folia'', ''Freising fragments'', or ''Freising monuments''; {{lang-de|Freisinger Denkmäler}}, {{lang-la|Monumenta Frisingensia}}, {{lang-sl|Brižinski spomeniki}} or {{lang|sl|Brižinski rokopisi}}) are the first [[Latin alphabet|Latin-script]] continuous text in a [[Slavic languages|Slavic language]] and "the oldest document in [[Slovene language|Slovene]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

| accessdate = 2014-06-02
| url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/13451/
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description and origin==
The manuscripts were found bound into a Latin [[codex]] (manuscript book). Four [[parchment]] leaves and a further quarter of a page have been preserved. They consist of three texts in the oldest [[Slovene dialects|Slovene dialect]]. Linguistic, stylistic and contextual analyses reveal that these are church texts of careful composition and literary form.

The precise date of the origin of the Freising Manuscripts cannot be exactly determined; the original text was probably written in the 9th century. In this [[liturgy|liturgic]] and [[homily|homiletic]] manuscript, three Slovene records were found and this miscellany was probably an episcopal manual (pontificals). The Freising Manuscripts in it were created between 972 and 1039, most likely before 1000. The main support for this dating is the writing, which was used in the centuries after [[Charlemagne]] and is named [[Carolingian minuscule]].

During the time of the writing of the two manuscripts (sermons on sin and repentance, a confessional form), [[Abraham of Freising|Bishop Abraham]] was active (from 957 to 994) in Freising. It is believed that the manuscripts were written in the [[Möll River]] Valley in [[Carinthia (duchy)|Carinthia]]. For this reason some linguists (e.g. [[Jernej Kopitar]] and [[Rajko Nahtigal]]) linked Abraham closely to the origin of the Freising Manuscripts and even attributed to him the authorship of one of the texts and suspected that he was of Slovene origin, although this was later disproven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://nl.ijs.si/e-zrc/bs/html/bsBK.html |title=Brižinski spomeniki: Monumenta Frisingiensia: elektronska znanstvenokritična izdaja |language=Slovenian |trans-title=The Freising Manuscripts: Monumenta Frisingiensa: The Electronic Scientifically Critical Edition |editor-first=Matija |editor-last=Ogrin |publisher=Institute of the Slovene Literature and the Slovene language, Scientific Research Centre, Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts |date=6 April 2007 |isbn=961-6568-33-7 |chapter=Oris raziskav |trans-chapter=Outline of Research |first=Igor |last=Grdina |at=§309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern history==
The manuscripts were discovered in [[Freising]], [[Bavaria]]. The Slovene name ''Brižinski spomeniki'' (literally 'Brižinj Monuments') was coined by the [[Carinthian Slovenes|Carinthian Slovene]] philologist [[Anton Janežič]], who Slovenized the German name Freising to ''Brižinj'' in 1854.&lt;ref&gt;Pogačnik, Jože &amp; Franc Zadravec. 1968. ''Zgodovina slovenskega slovstva: Srednji vek, reformacija in protireformacija, manirizem in barok.'' Maribor: Obzorja, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1803, the manuscript came to the [[Bavarian State Library]] in [[Munich]] and the Freising Manuscripts were discovered there in 1807. The texts were translated into modern Slovene in 1854 by the philologist Anton Janežič. Before World War II, a [[facsimile]] of the Freising Manuscripts was published by [[Silvester Škerl]] at ''[[Akademska založba]]'' (Academic Publisher) in [[Ljubljana]].

==Exhibitions==
The manuscripts are still kept at the Bavarian State Library in Munich and have left it only twice. In the 1970s, they were exhibited in the [[Vatican Museums]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.druzina.si/icd/spletnastran.nsf/knjigarna/DE355EBEC92986CAC1256EFD004D74FA/$FILE/CD97.PDF |title=Cerkev in kulturne dobrine |language=Slovenian |trans-title=The Church and Cultural Goods |volume=97 |journal=Cerkveni dokumenti |publisher=Družina; Pontifical Commission for the Cultural Goods of the Church |year=2002 |first=Rafko |last=Valenčič |isbn=961-222-418-8 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May and June 2004, they were exhibited at the [[National and University Library of Slovenia|National and University Library]] in [[Ljubljana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tvslo.si/kultura/knjige/vrnitev-brizinskih-spomenikov/131528 |title=Vrnitev Brižinskih spomenikov |language=Slovenian |trans-title=The Return of the Freising Monuments |date=23 June 2004 |work=MMC RTV Slovenija |publisher=RTV Slovenija |issn=1581-372X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Geraldine Kennedy''' (nee '''Granger''') is a fictional female vicar, the central character to the successful British BBC [[sitcom]] ''[[The Vicar of Dibley]]''. She is portrayed by [[Dawn French]] (who is 8 years older than Granger), described by the British Comedy Guide as "the jolly, down-to-earth female vicar of Dibley, a small country village inhabited by oddballs. After overcoming the town's initial shock at her gender Geraldine helps to improve the village."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/the_vicar_of_dibley/|title=The Vicar Of Dibley|publisher=British Comedy Guide|accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Much of the source of comedy comes from the way French plays the female vicar with her extroverted and fun-loving nature,&lt;ref name="Berman2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Berman|first=Garry|title=Best of the Britcoms: From Fawlty Towers to The Office|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V-SLkIap93wC&amp;pg=PA113|accessdate=29 March 2013|year=2011|publisher=Taylor Trade Publications|isbn=978-1-58979-566-2|page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; frequent colourful language, and behaviour as a vicar which would usually be frowned on by the church.

The character made a debut in 1994,&lt;ref name="The New Yorker"&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Yorker|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7qceAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=29 March 2013|date=February 2010|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 15 March 2013, French reprised her role as  Granger as part of her [[French and Saunders]] marathon on [[BBC Radio 2]].

==Character==
Granger arrived at the parish church to a shocked congregation, leading her to remark: "You were expecting a bloke - beard, bible, bad breath. And instead, you got a babe with a [[bob cut]] and a magnificent bosom."&lt;ref name="Florence2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Florence|first=Anna Carter|title=Preaching As Testimony|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7JZPO0T1DEcC&amp;pg=PA112|accessdate=29 March 2013|year=2007|publisher=Presbyterian Publishing Corp|isbn=978-0-664-22390-8|page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is a [[wikt:bon vivant|bonne vivante]] and a liberal woman who enjoys nothing more than a good laugh, much to the consternation of her primary antagonist David Horton. Despite her fun-loving and sometimes outrageous behaviour, she is deeply caring and does her best to help those in her parish in any way she can. She is well aware of her obesity but seems to take a relatively laid-back attitude toward it. A self-confessed [[Chocoholism|chocoholic]],&lt;ref name="The New Yorker"/&gt; her favourite being [[Smarties]] and [[Curly Wurly]]s, she often will go on a diet only to break it within minutes by eating one of the innumerable chocolate bars that she has hidden throughout her house (even in hollowed-out [[Bible]]s). On one occasion, she gives up chocolate for [[Lent]] and nearly goes mad but does succeed. She has an enormous crush on actor [[Sean Bean]].

Despite her kind-hearted nature, Geraldine is not above occasional arrogance. In the second-season episode "Celebrity Vicar", after a spot on local radio led to several high-profile media appearances, Geraldine allowed fame to go to her head, and became overconfident and self-absorbed, caring more about her public image and TV career than she did about her parishioners or her duties as a priest. She was later humbled after the tabloids printed several offensive articles about the members of the village council, and she struggled to regain their trust.

Her unusual first name [[Boudica|Boadicea]] is revealed later in the series, much to David Horton's ongoing amusement, although in the final episode her full name is given as '''Geraldine Julie Andrews Dick van Dyke Supercalifragilisticexpialidocius Chim-Chiminey Chim-Chiminey Chim-Chim-Cheree Granger''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gold.uktv.co.uk/vicar-dibley/article/reverend-geraldine-granger/|title=The Reverend Geraldine Granger|publisher=[[Gold (UK TV channel)|GOLD]]|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the latter due to her mother's favourite book being ''[[Mary Poppins]]'' and the fact that the [[Mary Poppins (film)|film]] was released in 1964, supposedly the year of Geraldine's birth. Geraldine celebrated her 40th birthday in an episode first broadcast on [[List of The Vicar of Dibley episodes#A Very Dibley Christmas (2004–2005)|1 January 2005]]. Dawn French was 48 at the time. 

Her best friend is Alice Tinker ([[Emma Chambers]]);&lt;ref name="Paietta2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Paietta|first=Ann C.|title=Saints, Clergy, and Other Religious Figures on Film and Television: 1895 - 2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-PBkAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=29 March 2013|year=2005|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Pub.|isbn=978-0-7864-2186-2|page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the end of each episode she tells a joke to Alice, but Alice rarely understands the humour. Geraldine was once going to marry David Horton but decided not to after all. In 2006, she receives a proposal from [[accountant]] Harry Jasper Kennedy and accepts by running around the village, screaming. In the final episode she marries him in a bizarre wedding with touches of ''[[Doctor Who]]'', including the two bridesmaids being dressed as [[Daleks]] and with parts of the church decorated with vegetables. She ends up getting married in her pyjamas because her wedding dress has been accidentally covered with mud by Owen Newitt.

'''Juliet Clutton-Brock''', [[Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London|FSA]], [[Fellow of the Zoological Society of London|FZS]] (6 September 1933 – 21 September 2015) was an English [[zooarchaeologist]] and [[curator]], specialising in domesticated mammals. From 1969 to 1993, she worked at the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]]. Between 1999 and 2006, she was the [[managing editor]] of the ''[[Journal of Zoology]]''.

==Early life==
Clutton-Brock was born on 6 September 1933 in London. She was the daughter of [[Alan Clutton-Brock]] (1904-1976), an art critic of ''[[The Times]]'' and [[Slade Professor of Fine Art]] at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], and his first wife, Sheelah Mabel Stoney Archer.&lt;ref name="obit - Times"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/obituaries/article4573664.ece|title=Juliet Clutton-Brock|date=2 October 2015|publisher=The Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, she and her brother were sent to [[Southern Rhodesia]] (now [[Zimbabwe]]) to live with an aunt after the death of their mother in a car-accident.&lt;ref name="obit - Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grigson|first1=Caroline|title=Juliet Clutton-Brock obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/oct/07/juliet-clutton-brock|accessdate=9 October 2015|work=The Guardian|date=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, her brother died from [[polio]]. Juliet enjoyed the wildlife in her aunt's garden, but was terrified of snakes. Having returned to England after the end of the war in 1945, she was educated at Runton Hill School, an all-girls [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|independent]] [[boarding school]] in [[Norfolk]] described as "icy" by Caroline Grigson. There she developed an interest in [[paleontology]] and studied the fossils in the nearby sea-cliffs.&lt;ref name="obit - Guardian" /&gt;

In 1953, she took a course on [[archaeology|Archaeological Techniques]] at the [[UCL Institute of Archaeology|Institute of Archaeology]], then an independent Institute and part of the [[University of London]].&lt;ref name="obit - Times" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obit - Guardian" /&gt; Professor [[Frederick Zeuner]], then Professor of Environmental Archaeology at the Institute of Archaeology and one of the founders of zoo-archaeology  recommended that she take a degree in [[zoology]] before undertaking further study in [[zooarchaeology]]. She therefore studied zoology at the [[Chelsea College of Science and Technology]] and graduated with a [[first class honours|first class]] [[Bachelor of Science]] (BSc) degree.&lt;ref name="obit - Guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bio - FSA" /&gt; She returned to the Institute of Archaeology to undertake [[post-graduate study]] in zooarchaeology under Zeuner. She completed her [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (PhD) degree in 1962 with a [[thesis]] on "mammalian faunas from sites in India and western Asia".&lt;ref name="obit - Times" /&gt; She also attended lectures by [[Gordon Childe]], [[Kathleen Kenyon]] and [[Max Mallowan]],&lt;ref name="obit - Guardian" /&gt; which gave her a solid background in the archaeology of Central Europe and the Middle East. Her father had inherited Chastleton House in the Cotswolds (built in 1603) in 1955, and Clutton-Brock would spend her vacations there.

==Career==
Clutton-Brock obtained part-time employment at the Natural History Museum and was a full-time senior research worker in the [[Mammal]] Section at the [[Natural History Museum, London]] from 1969 until her retirement in 1993, subsequently maintaining a position there as a research associate.&lt;ref name="obit - Times" /&gt; She acted as an editor of the ''[[Journal of Zoology]]'' from 1994, and its managing editor between 1999 and 2006.&lt;ref name="obit - Guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/journal.asp?ref=0952-8369&amp;site=1 ''Journal of Zoology''.]&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1976, Clutton-Brock became a member of the executive committee of the [[International Council for Archaeozoology]] during a meeting of the  [[UISPP]] in [[Nice]], and in 1982 organised a meeting of the International Council for Archaeozoology at the Institute of Archaeology on London together with Caroline Grigson.&lt;ref name="obit - Guardian" /&gt;

She published more than 90 scientific reports, papers, books and popular articles on [[zooarchaeology]] and the history of [[Domestication|domesticated mammals]]. Her most popular books include ''A Natural History of Domesticated Mammals'' ([[Cambridge University Press]]) and the ''Cat'', ''Dog'', and ''Horse'' volumes of the ''[[Eyewitness Books]]'' series ([[Dorling Kindersley|DK Publishing]]). Other works include ''Horse Power: A History of the Horse and the Donkey in Human Societies'' (Harvard University Press) and ''Cats: Ancient and Modern'' (also Harvard University Press).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;um=1&amp;q=%22Juliet%20Clutton-Brock%22&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=np List of published works] at [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt; Her "Natural History of Domesticated Mammals" became the standard text-book for most zoo-archaeology courses in the UK and abroad.

==Personal life==
Clutton-Brock married Peter Jewell (1925-1998), also a biologist and interested in zoo-archaeology, in 1958.&lt;ref name="Obituary - Peter Jewell"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hinde|first1=Robert A.|authorlink1=Robert Hinde|title=Obituary: Professor Peter Jewell|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-professor-peter-jewell-1162596.html|accessdate=9 October 2015|work=The Independent|date=3 June 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Saving the Breeds: A History of the Rare Breeds Survival Trust|first1=Lawrence|last1=Alderson|first2=Valerie|last2=Porter|publisher=Pica Press|year=1994|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Natural History of Domesticated Mammals|first=Juliet|last=Clutton-Brock|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999|page=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, they had three daughters; Sarah, Rebecca and Topsy.&lt;ref name="obit - Guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Obituary - Peter Jewell" /&gt; In 1966, when Jewell was made Professor of Biological Sciences at the [[University of Nigeria]], the family moved to [[Nsukka]]. They had to flee across the [[Niger]] in 1967 during the [[Biafran war]].&lt;ref name="obit - Guardian" /&gt; Jewell died in 1998.&lt;ref name="obit - Guardian" /&gt;

==Honours==
Clutton-Brock was elected a [[Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London]] (FSA) on 3 May 1979.&lt;ref name="bio - FSA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr Juliet Clutton-Brock FSA|url=https://www.sal.org.uk/about-us/fellows-directory/?fs=Juliet+Clutton-Brock|website=Society of Antiquaries of London|accessdate=9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also an elected [[Fellow of the Zoological Society of London]] (FZS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Fellows|url=http://www.zsl.org/join-our-family/zsl-fellowship/our-fellows|website=Zoological Society of London|accessdate=9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anneke Clason, Sebastian Payne and Hans-Peter Uerpmann published a [[festschrift]] in her honour in 1993, entitled ''Skeletons in Her Cupboard''.&lt;ref name="obit - Guardian" /&gt;

'''Legal executives''' are a form of trained persons in the legal professional in certain jurisdictions. They often specialise in a particular area of [[law]]. The training that a  Legal Executive undertakes usually includes both vocational training (a minimum of 3 years for those in England and Wales) and academic qualifications.

Legal executives are associated with different membership bodies and different rights according to geographical regions. Legal executives are recognised in both [[Northern Ireland]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], [[Singapore]],  [[Hong Kong]] and The Bahamas. There is no direct equivalent to a legal executive in [[Scotland]]. In England and Wales they hold Chartered status and are members of the Chartered Institute of Legal Executives (CILEx).

==England and Wales==
Chartered Legal Executives in England and Wales are lawyers.  They can become partners in law firms and are eligible to become judges and advocates subject to meeting eligibility requirements. As lawyers, they are subject to stringent regulation and a code of ethics as with barristers and solicitors.

Chartered Legal Executives (formerly known as Fellows of CILEx) qualify after completing their CILEX training followed by a minimum of 3 years qualifying employment. Chartered Legal Executives may do a wide range of legal work although, like solicitors, they generally specialise in one area:

* residential and commercial [[conveyancing]]
* [[will (law)|wills]] probate work and [[trusts]]
* personal injury
* family law
* criminal law
* employment law
* immigration law
* [[litigation]]
* practice management
 
After completing their academic training, trainee Legal Executives often occupy paralegal roles to satisfy the 3 year vocational stage of qualifying as Chartered Legal Executives.

===History===
The modern chartered legal executive evolved from the 19th-century managing clerk. When solicitor firms started to grow in the 19th century, they increasingly relied on an ever-expanding number of law clerks for drafting and organizing documents.  Some of these clerks in turn became knowledgeable about the law and were allowed to manage their fellow clerks; hence, they were called managing clerks.

In the 1950s and 1960s England suffered a shortage of solicitors when [[Post-World War II baby boom|population growth]] unexpectedly exceeded the number of entrants into the profession.  To improve the availability of legal services, the Law Society began aggressive recruitment efforts to convince young people to choose law as a career.  As part of this effort, the Law Society decided to turn the managing clerk into a true legal profession of its own and sponsored the ILEX's creation in 1963 as well as the change in title to legal executive. In the Law Society's own words, ILEX was intended "to stimulate recruitment to the unadmitted ranks of the professional status [...] and would offer [...] a career with proper incentives."&lt;ref&gt;Brian Abel-Smith and Robert Stevens, ''Lawyers and the Courts: A Sociological Study of the English Legal System, 1750-1965'' (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1967), 397.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute of Legal Executives was granted a royal charter to chartered professional body status in October 2011 and on 30 January 2012, officially received its charter, from the Minister of Justice, Jonathan Djanogly and was officially launched as the 'Chartered Institute of Legal Executives'.

===CILEx===
The Chartered [[Institute of Legal Executives]] (CILEx) was founded in 1892 as the Solicitors Managing Clerks' Association and became the Institute of Legal Executives, a company limited by guarantee, in 1963 with the support of the [[Law Society of England and Wales]].  In England and Wales the Institute of Legal Executives received a Royal Charter in early 2012 to become the Chartered Institute of Legal Executives (CILEx). Fully qualified members of CILEx in England and Wales are now therefore referred to as "Chartered Legal Executives".

CILEx is a professional body which represents Chartered legal executive lawyers and other legal practitioners and law staff. It has around 20,000 members.  All members of CILEx are independently regulated by ILEX Professional Standards (IPS), regardless of grade.

To qualify as a Chartered Legal Executive, aspiring Chartered Legal Executives undertake a series of training courses and are required to pass qualifications relevant to the area of practice in which they intend to specialise. The first stage for the full vocational route to qualifying is called the CILEx Level 3 Professional Diploma in Law and Practice&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cilex.org.uk/study/lawyer_qualifications/level_3_qualifications/diploma_in_law_and_practice.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; and is set at the equivalent to A-level law. The second and final qualifications are equivalent to an honours degree course - the CILEx Level 6 Diploma in Law and Practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cilex.org.uk/study/lawyer_qualifications/level_6_qualifications/level_6_diploma_law__practice.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; Trainees will often work at the same time as studying in order to acquire practical skills. The courses can be undertaken at a college, university or through an open learning programme. The courses are open to graduates and non-graduates.

A trainee must also gain 3 years' vocational experience before being admitted as a Fellow.

====Membership Grades====

=====Fellows=====
Only Fellows of CILEx (FCILEx) can lawfully hold themselves out as Chartered Legal Executives and are qualified by law (by way of CILEx) to be [[commissioner of oaths|commissioners of oaths]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cilex.org.uk/professional_issues/comm_oaths.asp]&lt;/ref&gt; able to take [[Deposition (law)|depositions]] and [[affidavits]]. Fellows also can bring action in [[court]] and appear for clients in certain courts. Appearance in courts requires a separate CILEx qualification to become a Chartered Legal Executive Advocate.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cilex.org.uk/about_cilex_lawyers/cilex_advocates.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Fellows (that is, Chartered Legal Executives) are also eligible to apply and compete with barristers and solicitors for appointment to certain judicial offices, such as the position of deputy or district judge.

=====Membership levels=====
In September 2009, the CILEx training in England and Wales changed.  The CILEx qualification now emphasises and examines the practical work of the law as well as continuing with the necessary academic examinations. At the same time, a number of new membership grades were introduced by CILEx. CILEx now offers the following membership categories which can be joined according to experience and qualifications held:

*student member - for those wishing to enter the legal profession, who have no relevant legal qualification, or those with less than three years’ work experience of a predominantly legal nature. 
*affiliate member - for those with at least one CILEx level-3 unit-qualifications, or who have completed a relevant level-2 legal qualification, or gained at least three years’ work of a predominantly legal nature. 
*associate member – for those who have completed their CILEx level-3 Professional Diploma in Law and Practice (the first stage of CILEx qualifications), or who are graduates with qualifying law degrees. Associate members will be entitled to use the designatory letters ACILEx after their name and be required to undertake [[continuing professional development]] (CPD). 
*graduate member - for those who have completed both their CILEx level-3 Professional Diploma in Law and Practice and their CILEx level-6 Professional Higher Diploma in Law and Practice (including the CILEx Graduate ‘Fast-Track’ Diploma,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cilex.org.uk/study/lawyer_qualifications/graduate_fast_track_diploma.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; or who are Legal Practice Course (LPC) or Bar Vocational Course (BVC) graduates. Graduate members will be entitled to use the designatory letters GCILEx after their name and be required to undertake CPD.

Students already holding a [[Legal Practice Course]] (LPC) or [[Bar Professional Training Course]] (BPTC) qualifications are exempt from the CILEx academic qualifications and can immediately apply to become a graduate member. Graduate members must then work under the supervision of a qualified legal executive or a solicitor at a firm, either in-house at a private company or in government (provided their work is substantially of a legal rather than administrative nature). To apply to become a Fellow of the Chartered Institute they must have a minimum of three years' practical legal experience.

Once a student has successfully completed a period of qualifying employment, he or she will become a Fellow of CILEx, a qualified lawyer and will be allowed to hold themselves out as a Chartered Legal Executive and use the designatory letters FCILEx. Fellows (and other member grades) are required to maintain and improve their knowledge by undertaking CPD each year.  A proportion of those hours must relate to their area of specialism.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cilex.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt; Fellows are issued an annual practising certificate. Only qualified and practicing Fellows of the Chartered Institute of Legal Executives may use the designatory title 'Chartered Legal Executives' which is a protected designation for practicing Fellows under its Royal Charter.

A CILEx Fellow who wishes to go on to qualify as a solicitor is usually allowed to forego the training contract aspect. For this exemption to apply, they must have attained fellowship level by the time they complete the vocational stage of solicitor training, i.e. the LPC. It goes without saying they must also have completed the academic stage; however, having come through the CILEx route to qualification, this usually means taking advanced modules of the CILEx level-6 qualification.

==Other Jurisdictions==

===Australia===
The Institute of Legal Executives (Victoria) was set up in 1966 and represents legal executives in the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], it works with the Institute of Legal Executives (Australia) which was formed in 1994 and represents legal executives in the rest of Australia.

===Hong Kong===
The Law Society of Hong Kong set benchmark standards for those using the title 'legal executive' in Hong Kong.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hklawsoc.org.hk/pub_e/circular/12-349a1.pdf|title=Benchmarks for Legal Executive Courses|last=Law Society of Hong Kong|first=|date=December 2011|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; HKUSPACE (an extension of the University of Hong Kong) runs two programs to meet the Law Society of Hong Kong benchmarks&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hkuspace.hku.hk/prog/cls|title=Certificate in Legal Studies - HKU SPACE: Common Law, Professional Legal Studies courses|website=hkuspace.hku.hk|language=en|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hkuspace-plk.hku.hk/programme/detail/higher-diploma-for-legal-executives|title=HKU SPACE Po Leung Kuk Stanley Ho Community College|website=hkuspace-plk.hku.hk|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Legal executive may be given certain limited rights of audience in accordance with the Court’s Practice Direction to represent lay clients.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Republic of Ireland===
The Irish Institute of Legal Executives [[IILEX]] is the professional body representing legal executives in Ireland and with the stated aim to provide a system of training and examination and to obtain a recognised professional qualification for those engaged in legal work in Ireland.

====Categories of IILEX Membership====
*Senior Legal Executive Member S.I.I.L.Ex.
*Legal Executive Member M.I.I.L.Ex.
*Associate Member ACILEx
*Student Legal Executive Member &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishinstituteoflegalexecutives.com/members.html Categories of IILEX Membership] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106183258/http://www.irishinstituteoflegalexecutives.com/members.html |date=2009-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
The New Zealand Institute of Legal Executives&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzile.org.nz]&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[incorporated society]] which advances and protects the status and interests of legal executives. At present it has approximately 650 members.

===The Bahamas===
In The Bahamas, Legal Executives, like other members of the legal profession, are governed by and regulated in accordance with the provisions of the Legal Profession Act. The Legal Profession Act tasks the Registrar of the Supreme Court of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas with keeping a register which is known simply as the Register of Legal Executives.

Whereas Legal Executives practising in England and Wales now enjoy certain rights of audience, in The Bahamas, Legal Executives may only appear before a particular tribunal or authority after the attorney-general has had consultations with the Bar Council of the Bahamas Bar Association.

In The Bahamas, under the Legal Profession Act, it is unlawful for a person to hold himself or herself out as a Legal Executive if their name does not appear on the Register of Legal Executives. Any person who is found to be guilty of pretending to be a Legal Executive can be liable upon conviction to a fine of B$5,000.00, or imprisonment for a period of three years, or both.

'''Legend tripping''' is a name bestowed by [[folklorist]]s and [[anthropology|anthropologists]] on an [[adolescent]] practice (containing elements of a [[rite of passage]]) in which a usually furtive [[night|nocturnal]] [[pilgrimage]] is made to a site which is alleged to have been the scene of some [[tragedy|tragic]], [[Horror (emotion)|horrific]], and possibly [[supernatural]] event or [[haunting]]. The practice has been documented most thoroughly to date in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="CHE"&gt;Peter Monaghan, "The Surprising Online Life of Legends" ''The Chronicle of Higher Education '' Dec 12, 2011 [http://chronicle.com/blogs/pageview/the-surprising-online-life-of-legends/29221?sid=cr ]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sites for legend trips ==
While the stories that attach to the sites of legend tripping vary from place to place, and sometimes contain a kernel of historical truth, there are a number of motifs and recurring themes in the legends and the sites.  Abandoned buildings, remote bridges, tunnels, [[cave]]s, rural roads, specific woods or other uninhabited (or semi-uninhabited) areas, and especially [[cemetery|cemeteries]] are frequent sites of legend-tripping pilgrimages.

== Reactions and controversies ==
Legend-tripping is a mostly harmless, perhaps even beneficial, youth recreation.  It allows young people to demonstrate their courage in a place where the actual physical risk is likely slight.&lt;ref name="Ellis"&gt;Ellis, Bill. "Legend Trips and Satanism: Adolescents' Ostensive Traditions as 'Cult' Activity." In ''The Satanism Scare'', ed. James T. Richardson, Joel Best, and David G. Bromley, 279-95. NY: Aldme DeGreyter&lt;/ref&gt; However, in what Ellis calls "ostensive abuse," the rituals enacted at the legend-tripping sites sometimes involve [[trespassing]], [[vandalism]], and other [[misdemeanor]]s, and sometimes acts of [[animal sacrifice]] or other [[blood ritual]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ellis|first1=Bill|title=Death by Folklore: Ostension, Contemporary Legend, and Murder|journal=Western Folklore|date=July 1989|volume=48|issue=3|pages=201–220|doi=10.2307/1499739}}&lt;/ref&gt; These transgressions then sometimes lead to local [[moral panic]]s that involve adults in the community, and sometimes even the [[mass media]].  These panics often further embellish the prestige of the legend trip to the adolescent mind.&lt;ref name="Ellis" /&gt; In at least one notorious case, years of destructive legend-tripping, amounting to an "ostensive frenzy," led to the fatal shooting of a legend-tripper near [[Lincoln, Nebraska]] followed by the wounding of the woman whose house had become the focus of the ostension.&lt;ref&gt;Summers, Wynne, L. "Bloody Mary: When Ostension Becomes a Deadly and Destructive Teen Ritual." ''Midwestern Folklore'' 26 (2000):1 19-26.&lt;/ref&gt; The panic over youth [[Satanism]] in the 1980s was fueled in part by [[graffiti]] and other ritual activities engaged in by legend-tripping youths.&lt;ref name="Ellis" /&gt;

Most ancient, surviving minarets were constructed adjacent to a [[mosque]], for the Muslim call to prayer ([[Adhan]]) five times each day by a [[muezzin]] (crier).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Minaret |url=https://www.britannica.com/art/minaret-architecture |website=britannica.com |accessdate=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few minarets were built as watchtowers, landmarks or symbols of victory or glory of a Muslim [[Khanate]] or empire. In some instances, like the [[Minaret of Jam]] only the minaret tower survives today while the adjoining mosques and other structures were destroyed over time by nature and invaders.

A separate category for "Advice, How-To and Miscellaneous" books was created January 1, 1984. Its number one bestseller (''The Body Principal'' by Victoria Principal) had been number ten and number twelve on the non-fiction lists for the two preceding weeks.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Marsh Chapel Experiment''', also called the "'''Good Friday Experiment'''", was a 1962 experiment conducted on [[Good Friday]] at [[Boston University]]'s [[Marsh Chapel]]. [[Walter N. Pahnke]], a graduate student in theology at [[Harvard Divinity School]], designed the experiment under the supervision of [[Timothy Leary]] and the [[Harvard Psilocybin Project]].&lt;ref name="Pahnke 1966"/&gt; Pahnke's experiment investigated whether [[psilocybin]] (the active principle in [[psilocybin mushroom]]s) would act as a reliable [[entheogen]] in religiously predisposed subjects.&lt;ref name="Pahnke PhD" /&gt;

==Experiment==
Prior to the Good Friday service, graduate degree divinity student volunteers from the [[Boston]] area were randomly divided into two groups. In a [[double-blind]] experiment, half of the students received psilocybin, while a [[control group]] received a large dose of [[niacin]]. Niacin produces clear physiological changes and thus was used as an [[active placebo]]. In at least some cases, those who received the niacin initially believed they had received the psychoactive drug.&lt;ref name="Doblin 1991"/&gt;{{Rp|5}} However, the feeling of face flushing (turning red, feeling hot and tingly) produced by niacin subsided after about an hour after receiving the dose. However, the effects of the psilocybin intensified over the first few hours. 

Almost all of the members of the experimental group reported experiencing profound religious experiences, providing empirical support for the notion that [[psychedelic drug]]s can facilitate religious experiences. One of the participants in the experiment was religious scholar [[Huston Smith]], who would become an author of several textbooks on [[comparative religion]]. He later described his experience as "the most powerful cosmic homecoming I have ever experienced".&lt;ref name= "Smith 2000"/&gt;

==Doblin's follow-up==
In a 25-year follow-up to the experiment, all of the subjects given psilocybin described their experience as having elements of "a genuine mystical nature and characterized it as one of the high points of their spiritual life".&lt;ref name="Doblin 1991"/&gt;{{Rp|13}} Psychedelic researcher [[Rick Doblin]] considered Pahnke's original study partially flawed due to incorrect implementation of the [[double-blind]] procedure, and several imprecise questions in the mystical experience questionnaire. Nevertheless, Doblin said that Pahnke's study cast "a considerable doubt on the assertion that mystical experiences catalyzed by drugs are in any way inferior to non-drug mystical experiences in both their immediate content and long-term effects".&lt;ref name="Doblin 1991"/&gt;{{Rp|24}} A similar sentiment was expressed by clinical psychologist William A. Richards, who in 2007 stated "[psychedelic] mushroom use may constitute one technology for evoking revelatory experiences that are similar, if not identical, to those that occur through so-called spontaneous alterations of brain chemistry."&lt;ref name="Richards 2008"/&gt;

==Griffiths' study==
In 2002 (published in 2006), a more rigorously controlled version of this experiment was conducted at [[Johns Hopkins University]] by [[Roland R. Griffiths]], yielding similar results.&lt;ref name="Griffiths 2006"/&gt; In a 14-month follow-up to this study, over half of the participants rated the experience among the top five most meaningful spiritual experiences in their lives, and considered the experience to have increased their personal well-being and life satisfaction.&lt;ref name="Griffiths 2008"/&gt;

'''MediaSmarts''' (formerly the '''Media Awareness Network''') is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[non-profit organization]] based in [[Ottawa]], Ontario that focuses on [[media literacy]] programs. In particular, the organization promotes [[critical thinking]] via education resources and analyzes the content of various types of [[mass media]]. Surveys and studies performed by MediaSmarts have explored youth [[media consumption]], such as television and internet use, as well as media issues. In recent years the organization's focus has shifted more heavily to digital literacy, although it continues to produce resources on traditional media.

The funding for MediaSmarts is primarily derived from private sector sponsors and Canadian Government grants.&lt;ref name=drive&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.zdnet.com/2009-1040_22-6057231.html |title=Teaching kids to drive the Net |accessdate=2008-12-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303214043/http://news.zdnet.com/2009-1040_22-6057231.html |archivedate=March 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediasmarts.ca/about-us "MediaSmarts - About Us"], MediaSmarts&lt;/ref&gt; The group partnered with [[Microsoft]] and [[Bell Canada]] to produce web resources for teachers and parents to protect kids online.&lt;ref name=drive/&gt; MediaSmarts has received a number of awards for its work, including an award from the [[Canadian Race Relations Foundation]] and several online awards for web-based content.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediasmarts.ca/about-us/awards-recognitions "MediaSmarts Awards &amp; Recognition"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
One of the large studies undertaken by MediaSmarts is ''Young Canadians in a Wired World'', a research study to investigate and track and the "behaviours, attitudes, and opinions" of [[Internet]] use in Canadian children and youth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediasmarts.ca/research-policy "MediaSmarts Research and Policy"], MediaSmarts&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Taylor, Anne|title=Young Canadians in a Wired World: How Canadian Kids Are Using the Internet |journal=Education Canada |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=32–35 |date=Fall 2001 |url=http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ643772&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ643772|issn=0013-1253 |accessdate=2008-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results from this study, which indicate high levels of personal information collection by websites popular with children,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/ottawa/story/2008/02/04/ot-marketing-080204.html "Market researchers target kids with online games"], [[CBC News]], February 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; have been cited to argue that parental supervision of child internet use alone "cannot adequately protect children" that have the highest levels of social internet use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Steeves, Valerie  |author2=Webster, Cheryl  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Closing the Barn Door: The Effect of Parental Supervision on Canadian Children's Online Privacy  |journal=Bulletin of Science, Technology &amp; Society|volume=28|issue=1|pages=4–19 |year=2008|doi=10.1177/0270467607311488}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rebranding==
Formerly Media Awareness Network, MediaSmarts was launched on May 29, 2012 with a new name, logo and website. The new brand was developed pro-bono by Toronto-based advertising agency, Brandworks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediasmarts.ca/press-centre/mnet-launches-its-new-brand-digital-age "MNet launches its new brand for the digital age"], MediaSmarts&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media Literacy Week==
Media Literacy Week.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medialiteracyweek.ca "Media Literacy Week"], Media Literacy Week&lt;/ref&gt; is an annual event that takes place every November. Co-led by MediaSmarts and the Canadian Teachers’ Federation, the week puts a spotlight on the importance of digital and media literacy as a key component in the education of children and young people. Working with Canadian schools, libraries, and educational associations and organizations, Media Literacy Week participants seek to inspire a leap in Canadians’ thinking towards media education as an important – and innovative – approach towards creating thoughtful, engaged and informed young people.

'''Middle East Studies Association''' (often referred to as '''MESA''') is a [[learned society]], and according to its website, "a non-profit association that fosters the study of the [[Middle East]], promotes high standards of scholarship and teaching, and encourages public understanding of the region and its peoples through programs, publications and services that enhance education, further intellectual exchange, recognize professional distinction, and defend [[academic freedom]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mesa.arizona.edu/about/index.html|title=Middle East Studies Association|date= |accessdate=2014-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
MESA was founded in 1966 with 50 original members. Its current{{When|date=August 2015}} membership exceeds 2,900 and it "serves as an umbrella organization for more than sixty institutional members and thirty-nine affiliated organizations".{{Cite quote|date=August 2015}} It is a constituent society of the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] and the [[National Council of Area Studies Associations]], and a member of the [[National Humanities Alliance]].

Regions of interest to MESA members include Iran, Turkey, Afghanistan, Israel, Pakistan, and the countries of the Arab world from the seventh century to modern times. Spain, Southeastern Europe, the Soviet Union and other regions also are included for the periods in which their territories were part of the Middle Eastern empires or were under the influence of Middle Eastern civilization. Historians comprise the largest group of disciplinary specialists in MESA followed by political science/international relations, anthropology, and language and literature. The interdisciplinary gender and sexuality studies group is quite strong.{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=August 2015}}

==Activities==
The current president is [[Judith E Tucker (Historian)|Judith E Tucker]], [[Georgetown University]].

===Publications===
''[[The International Journal of Middle East Studies]]'' (IJMES) is a quarterly journal published by [[Cambridge University Press]] under the auspices of MESA. The editor is Akram Khater of [[North Carolina State University]].

The '''''Review of Middle East Studies''''' ('''RoMES''') is MESA’s journal of review. MESA policy has established the focus of RoMES as the state of the craft in all fields of Middle East studies. The Editor is Richard C. Martin and the journal is based at [[Virginia Tech]].

MESA has a very active Committee on [[Academic Freedom]] (CAF) that has two wings: CAFMENA (Middle East and North Africa, established in 1990) and CAFNA (North America, established in 2005). Through CAF, MESA monitors infringements on [[Academic Freedom in the Middle East|academic freedom on the Middle East and North Africa]] worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mesa.arizona.edu/committees/academic-freedom/index.html|title=Committee on Academic Freedom (CAF)|work=arizona.edu|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year CAF nominates candidates for MESA’s Academic Freedom Award. The winners are confirmed by the Board of Directors.

===Controversies===
In 2007  [[Bernard Lewis]]  and [[Fouad Ajami]] started  [[Association for the Study of the Middle East and Africa]] as  a rival to MESA, as they saw MESA as "dominated by academics who have been critical of Israel and of America's role in the Middle East."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nysun.com/new-york/group-formed-to-improve-middle-east-scholarship/66110/ Group Formed To Improve Middle East Scholarship], Annie Karni, [[New York Sun]], November 8, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://electronicintifada.net/content/new-middle-east-scholars-group-seen-close-white-house/7223 The Electronic Intifada, 20 November 2007: ''New Middle East scholars group seen as close to White House''] Retrieved 2012-09-22&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards ===
'''Albert Hourani Book Award'''

Since 1991 MESA has awarded the [[Albert Hourani Book Award]] to recognize "the very best in Middle East studies scholarship". The prize is named after [[Albert Hourani]], "to recognize his long and distinguished career as teacher and mentor".&lt;ref&gt;[https://mesana.org/awards/category/albert-hourani-book-award Albert Hourani Book Award]&lt;/ref&gt; The MESA Dissertation Awards were established in 1982 to recognize exceptional achievement in research and writing for/of dissertations in Middle East studies. In 1984 the award was named for Malcolm H. Kerr to honor his significant contributions to Middle East studies. Awards are given in two categories: Social Sciences and Humanities.

'''MESA Mentoring Award'''

Since 1996 the MESA Mentoring Award has recognized exceptional contributions retired faculty have made to the education and training of others.

'''Jere L. Bacharach Service Award'''

Since 1997 [[Jere L. Bacharach]] Service Award has recognized the contributions of individuals through their outstanding service to MESA or the profession. Service is defined broadly to include work in diverse areas, including but not limited to outreach, librarianship, and film.

The '''''Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Cultures''''' is a three-volume set of articles by many specialists under the general editorship of [[David Carrasco]].&lt;ref&gt;David Carrasco, ed. ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Cultures'', 3 vols. New York: Oxford University Press 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Published in 2001, the encyclopedia builds on and updates the sixteen-volume ''Handbook of Middle American Indians'' (1964-76). The work’s coverage spans [[Mesoamerica]] from the [[pre-Columbian|prehispanic]] era to the turn of the twenty-first century. Articles are presented alphabetically, but a synoptic outline of contents gives the titles of principal articles. These include geography and history; Mesoamerican cultures and ethnicities; Mesoamerican studies, with an overview article and articles on approaches, methods, and institutions; written and oral sources divided into prehispanic manuscripts and colonial manuscripts and sources; economy and subsistence; social political and religious organization, with principal articles on civil-religious hierarchy, ethnicity, family and kinship, gender, labor, law, political organization, land tenure, slavery, social stratification, an urbanization; social differentiation; institutions and organizations; cultural interaction and processes of social change; cosmovision and ritual performance, creative expressions and material forms; Mesoamerican sites, cities, and ceremonial centers. There are also biographies of historical figures as well as scholars of Mesoamerican culture.&amp;nbsp; There is no coverage of [[colonialism]] per se, or race and racial conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Francie Chassen-López, “Review, ''Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Cultures''”, ''The Americas'' vol. 61, No. 3.

'''Top With a Lid, Tricolor''', from the 16th - 15th centuries BC was discovered in [[Karashamb]]. It is included in the [[History Museum of Armenia]]'s collection under the number 3060-200.

== Description ==
The pot is in the form of a [[barrel]]. The lip is straight, broken, and has two pairs of holes at the edge for hanging. Its surface is black, sealed, polished, and split into four sectors which are intermittently decorated with red okra and lit white paint triangles. The sectors are separated from each other by a pair of vertical lines resembling waves. The lid is round, grooved, decorated by four triangles equally composing a cross image. In the intersection of the wings of the cross, there is a hole.&lt;ref name="sculpture"&gt;Հայացք բրոնզե դարից, Ալբոմ-կատալոգ, Հայաստանի պատմության թանգարան, 2016, 160 էջ: A Glance from the Bronze Age.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7109">'''Raymond Ibrahim''' (born 1973) is an American research librarian, translator, author and columnist. His focus is [[Arab people#History|Arabic history]] and [[Arabic language|language]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2005/oct/18/20051018-095334-5433r/ "Terrorist letter's validity doubted"], ''[[The Washington Times]], October 18, 2005''&lt;/ref&gt; and current events. He is the author of three books, ''Sword and Scimitar: Fourteen Centuries of War between Islam and the West'' (Da Capo, 2018), ''Crucified Again: Exposing Islam's New War on Christians'' (Regnery, 2013) and ''The Al Qaeda Reader'' (Doubleday, 2007).

Ibrahim was born in the United States to [[Copt]]ic immigrants from Egypt.&lt;ref name="WPost1"&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/1359108451.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Oct+7%2C+2007&amp;author=&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=T.5&amp;desc=In+Their+Own+Words%3B+Bin+Laden+and+al-Zawahiri+explain+their+bloody+actions. "In Their Own Words; Bin Laden and al-Zawahiri explain their bloody actions."], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', October 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He is fluent in Arabic and English. Ibrahim studied at [[California State University, Fresno]], where he wrote a Master's thesis under [[Victor Davis Hanson]] on  an early military encounter between [[Byzantine–Arab Wars|Islam and Byzantium]] based on medieval Arabic and Greek texts. Ibrahim also took graduate courses at Georgetown University's [[Center for Contemporary Arab Studies]] and studied toward a PhD in medieval Islamic history at [[The Catholic University of America|Catholic University]].&lt;ref name=hoover&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoover.org/profiles/raymond-ibrahim|title=Raymond Ibrahim|accessdate=April 21, 2017|work=Hoover Institution}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Ibrahim was previously an [[Arabic language]] specialist for the Near East section of the [[Library of Congress]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2005-01-20-bin-laden-translations_x.htm "Bin Laden writings to be translated"], ''[[USA Today]]'', [[Associated Press]], January 20, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and the associate director of the [[Middle East Forum]]. He is currently the Judith Friedman Rosen Writing Fellow at the [[Middle East Forum]], an American conservative think tank.&lt;ref name="meforum.com"&gt;[http://www.meforum.com/fellows.php]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibrahim is the editor and translator of ''The Al Qaeda Reader'', which he published after discovering a hitherto unknown Arabic [[al-Qaeda]] document; Ibrahim believes the document "proves once and for all that, despite the propaganda of al-Qaeda and its sympathizers, radical Islam's war with the West is not finite and limited to political grievances— real or imagined- but is existential, transcending time and space and deeply rooted in faith".&lt;ref name="WPost1" /&gt;

Ibrahim has appeared on and been interviewed by Al Jazeera, MSNBC, C-SPAN, NPR, and Reuters, and "regularly lectures, briefs governmental agencies, provides expert testimony for Islam-related lawsuits, and testifies before Congress."&lt;ref name="meforum.com"/&gt;

==Reception==
An article Ibrahim wrote on [[taqiyya]], which was commissioned and published by ''[[Jane's Information Group|Jane's Islamic Affairs Analyst]]'' on September 26, 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meforum.org/2094/taqiyya-revisited|title=Taqiyya Revisited: A Response to the Critics|first=Raymond|last=Ibrahim|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jiaa.janes.com/public/jiaa/special_reports.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303150030/http://jiaa.janes.com/public/jiaa/special_reports.shtml |archivedate=2009-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was later characterized by another author in ''Jane's Islamic Affairs Analyst'' as being "well-researched, factual in places but ... ultimately misleading".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110811212138/http://articles.janes.com/articles/Janes-Islamic-Affairs-Analyst-2008/Interpreting-Taqiyya.html "Interpreting Taqiyya: Special Report"], ''Jane's Islamic Affairs Analyst''. [[IHS Inc.|IHS]] [[Jane's Information Group]].

'''The Right to Censor''' (frequently referred to as '''RTC''') was a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] [[professional wrestling]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|faction]] in the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] from mid-2000 to early 2001. The group was a [[parody]] of the [[Parents Television Council]] (PTC),&lt;ref name="btr167"&gt;{{cite book|title=Between the Ropes: Wrestling's Greatest Triumphs and Failures|last1=Fritz|first1=Brian|last2=Murray|first2=Christopher|page=167|publisher=[[ECW Press]]|year=2006|isbn=978-1-55022-726-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="steelchair148"&gt;{{cite book|title=Steel Chair to the Head|last=Sammond|first=Nicholas|page=148|publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|year=2005|isbn=978-0-8223-3438-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was protesting the level of violence and sexual content in WWF programming, and threatening to boycott several of their sponsors.

The Right to Censor uniform was a white button up shirt and black tie, with black slacks for the men (although [[Val Venis]] wore white slacks on occasion) and a long black skirt for the women, which parodies the look of a [[Mormon]] missionary.&lt;ref name="steelchair148"/&gt; Eventually Ivory, the only woman recruited to the group, was forced to adopt the black slacks out of necessity, due to the skirt limiting her in-ring abilities.

Entrances of RTC members were accompanied not by the standard musical theme but by the sound of shrill alarms and buzzers, with an underlying swing jazz beat, along with a monotone voice repeating the word "warning" over and over again.

==History==

===Formation and feuds===
The group was formed when wrestler [[Stevie Richards|Steven Richards]] began to randomly appear on WWF programming to cover up the bodies of scantily clad women or remove "[[Hardcore wrestling|hardcore]]" weapons such as tables from matches. He apparently took offense to the [[Acolytes Protection Agency|Acolytes]]' rowdy reputation and disapproved of the [[The Dudley Boyz|Dudleys]]' use of tables. He was eventually joined by [[Barry Buchanan|Bull Buchanan]], [[The Godfather (wrestler)|The Goodfather]] (formerly the Godfather), [[Val Venis]], and [[Ivory (wrestler)|Ivory]]. The group temporarily forced [[Stacy Carter|The Kat]] into its fold, but The Kat and the WWF parted ways before that [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|storyline]] could completely play itself out. Before being forced into the group, The Kat was starting a group called Right to Nudity, which was to play on The Kat's infamous [[pay-per-view]] stunt where she appeared completely topless. Her group was what brought her to Right to Censor's attention.

The Right to Censor came out victorious in at least one match of every pay-per-view they participated in from mid-2000 to early 2001. At [[SummerSlam (2000)|SummerSlam 2000]], Richards, Buchanan, and The Goodfather won a 6-man tag match against [[Too Cool]] ([[Brian Christopher|Grandmaster Sexay]] and [[Scott Garland (wrestler)|Scotty 2 Hotty]]) and [[Solofa Fatu|Rikishi]]. At the next pay-per-view, [[Unforgiven (2000)|Unforgiven]], the RTC (now with Val Venis) won an 8-man tag match against the [[The Acolytes Protection Agency|APA]] and the Dudley Boyz. Even though The Goodfather and Bull Buchanan lost the Dudley Invitational at [[No Mercy (2000)|No Mercy 2000]], Venis and Richards managed to defeat [[Chyna]] and [[Billy Gunn|Mr. Ass]] in a tag match. When [[WWE Women's Championship (1956–2010)|Women's Champion]] Ivory joined the group, she won 3 pay-per-view matches in a row for the group. She defeated Lita in a title match at [[Survivor Series (2000)|Survivor Series 2000]] while The Goodfather and Buchanan lost a Survivor Series Elimination Match. At [[Armageddon (2000)|Armageddon 2000]], Ivory came out victorious once again in a triple-threat title match against [[Molly Holly]] and [[Trish Stratus]], and Val Venis also was victorious over Chyna. Meanwhile, Buchanan and The Goodfather continued the losing streak when they lost the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|Tag Team titles]] to [[Adam Copeland|Edge]] and [[Christian Cage|Christian]] in a Fatal Four-Way tag match. At the [[Royal Rumble (2001)|2001 Royal Rumble]], Ivory once again retained her title by defeating Chyna; on the other hand, Buchanan, The Goodfather, and Venis all failed in their attempt to win the Royal Rumble Match. [[No Way Out (2001)|No Way Out 2001]] that year marked the last time the RTC would win a match at a pay-per-view when Steven Richards defeated [[Jerry Lawler]].

The group had a moderate level of success, with Buchanan and The Goodfather holding the Tag Team Championship and Ivory capturing the WWF Women's Championship before entering into a high-profile [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] with [[Chyna]].

===Split===
''[[WrestleMania X-Seven]]'' was the symbolic end of the Right to Censor, as the stable lost all of the matches they were scheduled to participate in,&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia&gt;{{cite book|title=[[WWE Encyclopedia]]|last1=Shields|first1=Brian|last2=Sullivan|first2=Kevin|page=251|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7566-4190-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buchanan, Venis, and The Goodfather lost a 6-man tag match against the APA and [[Tazz]] while Ivory lost her title to Chyna.

On the April 26, 2001 episode of SmackDown!, Richards, Buchanan, Val Venis, and The Goodfather faced the Undertaker in a 4-on-1 handicap match. The group was finally disbanded when Steven Richards was hit with the [[Powerbomb#Elevated powerbomb|Last Ride]] by [[The Undertaker]].&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia/&gt; The Goodfather, Buchanan and Val Venis all walked out and left him lying in the ring. The group’s last match was contested on May 24, 2001 on SmackDown!, when Bull Buchanan, The Goodfather &amp; Ivory lost to [[Steve Blackman]], [[Grand Master Sexay]] &amp; [[Trish Stratus]] in a tag match. Following this match, RTC was officially disbanded, with Ivory appearing for the last time under the Right to Censor gimmick on the June 16, 2001 episode of Metal. Ivory &amp; Steven Richards would return as members of WCW/ECW Alliance during the Invasion angle and Val Venis &amp; Goodfather returned at the 2002 Royal Rumble under their old personas. Steven Richards adopted a [[Heel (professional wrestling)#Types|psychotic]] [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] while Bull Buchanan was briefly rebranded as '''B&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''' (B-Squared) and made a bodyguard for [[John Cena]] before departing the WWE. The rest of the group reverted to their previous [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|personas]] before the advent of the faction.

'''Saint-Étienne''' ({{IPA-fr|sɛ̃t‿etjɛn}}; {{lang-frp|Sant-Etiève}}; ''Saint Stephen'') is a city in eastern central France, in the [[Massif Central]], {{convert|55|km|0|abbr=on|lk=out}} southwest of [[Lyon]] in the [[Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes|Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region]], on the trunk road that connects [[Toulouse]] with Lyon. Saint-Étienne is the capital of the [[Loire (department)|Loire]] department and has a population of approximately 172,023 (2013) in the city itself and over 508,000 in the metropolitan area (2011).

In the last years Saint-Étienne made important transformations for transitioning from a 19th century industrial city to the 21st century "European capital of design". This approach led to important urban renovations of the main districts of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Saint-Étienne|date=2018-11-04|url=https://fr.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Saint-%C3%89tienne&amp;oldid=153673794|work=Wikipédia|language=fr|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Saint-Étienne}}
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}

Named after [[Saint Stephen]], the city first appears in the historical record in the Middle Ages as ''Saint-Étienne de Furan'' (after the [[Furan (river)|River Furan]], a tributary of the [[Loire]]). In the 13th century, it was a small borough around the church dedicated to Saint Etienne. On the upper reaches of the Furan, near the [[Way of St. James]], the [[Abbey of Valbenoîte]] had been founded by the [[cistercians]] in 1222. In the late 15th century, it was a fortified village defended by walls built around the original nucleus.

From the 16th century, Saint-Étienne developed an arms manufacturing industry and became a market town. It was this which accounted for the town's importance, although it also became a centre for the manufacture of [[ribbons]] and [[passementerie]] starting in the 17th century. During the [[French revolution]], Saint-Étienne was briefly renamed '''Armeville''' – 'arms town' – because of this activity.

Later, it became a mining centre of the [[Loire coal mining basin]], and more recently, has become known for its bicycle industry.

In the first half of the 19th century, it was only a chief town of an arrondissement in the ''{{Lang|fr|département}}'' of the [[Loire (department)|Loire]], with a population of 33,064 in 1832. The concentration of industry prompted these numbers to rise rapidly to 110,000 by about 1880. It was this growing importance of Saint-Étienne that led to its being made seat of the prefecture and the departmental administration on 25 July 1855, when it became the chief town in the ''{{Lang|fr|département}}'' and seat of the prefect, replacing [[Montbrison, Loire|Montbrison]], which was reduced to the status of chief town of an {{Lang|fr|arrondissement}}. Saint-Étienne absorbed the commune of Valbenoîte and several other neighbouring localities on 31 March 1855.

==Demographics==
Population of the city at the 1999 census was 180,210 (177,300 as of February 2004 estimates). Population of the whole metropolitan area at the 1999 census was 321,703.

Inhabitants of Saint-Étienne are called ''Stéphanois'' in French. They are named so because "Étienne" derives from the Greek ''Stephanos''.

==Culture==
&lt;!--Cathedral and Castle should be mentioned at least!--&gt;
Saint-Étienne became a popular stop for automobile travelers in the early 20th century (sometimes referred to as The Golden Age of Travel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lapl.org/virgal/travel/index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051101031510/http://www.lapl.org/virgal/travel/index.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=1 November 2005 |title=LAPL Virtual Photo: Far and Wide |publisher=Lapl.org |date= |accessdate=14 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

In 1998, Saint-Étienne set up a design [[wikt:biennale|biennale]] – the largest of its kind in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.citedudesign.com//fr/biennale/ |title=La Biennale Internationale Design Saint-Étienne |website=Cité du design |accessdate=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It lasts around two weeks. A landmark in the history of the importance ascribed to design in Saint-Étienne was the inauguration of ''La Cité du design'' on the site of the former arms factory in 2009.

The city also launched the [[Massenet Festival]]s, (the composer [[Jules Massenet]] hailed from the area) devoted mainly to perform Massenet's operas. In 2000, the city was named one of the [[French Towns and Lands of Art and History]]. On 22 November 2010, it was nominated as "City of Design" as part of [[UNESCO]]’s [[Creative Cities Network]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120712134526/http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/ev.php-URL_ID=41427&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html St-Etienne and Sydney nominated UNESCO Creative Cities ], 22 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint-Étienne has four museums:

# the ''[[Musée d'art moderne et contemporain de Saint-Étienne|Musée d'Art Moderne]]'' has one of the largest collections of modern and contemporary art in France
# ''[[Saint-Étienne Mine Museum|Musée de la Mine]]''
# ''Musée de l'Art et de l'Industrie''
# ''Musée du vieux Saint-Etienne''

==Climate==
Saint-Étienne has an anormal type of the [[oceanic climate]] that is heavily influenced by its relative distance to the sea. Summer days are very warm for a marine climate type, but fall into the range due to the cool nights that keep the mean average temperatures below the subtropical threshold of {{convert|22|C|F}}. Winters are cool but rarely very cold, although minor frosts are common. Precipitation levels are very low for this type of climate regime during winter, although the wet and humid summers compensate.

'''Salvador Freixedo''', ([[O Carballiño]], [[Province of Ourense|Ourense Province]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], 1923) is a former [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Catholic]] [[priest]] and a former member of the [[Jesuit Order]]. An [[Ufologist]] and researcher of ''paranormal subjects'', he has written a number of books on the relationship between religion and extraterrestrial beings, and has been a speaker in several international UFO congresses in [[Europe]], the [[Americas]], and  [[Asia]]. He is also a contributor to a number of parascientific magazines, such as ''Mundo Desconocido'' (''Unknown World''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://andreas.faber.cat/mundo-desconocido/|title=Mundo Desconocido|accessdate=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Karma 7'' and ''Más allá'' (''Beyond'')&lt;ref&gt;[[:es:Más allá de la Ciencia|Más Allá de la Ciencia]]. In its first issue there was a very controversial article from the author about ''El informe Matrix'' (''The Matrix Report'').&lt;/ref&gt; among others. He has also appeared in a number of TV and radio shows dedicated to these subjects.

== Biography ==
He was born in [[O Carballiño]] ([[Province of Ourense|Ourense Province]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], Spain), in 1923,&lt;ref name=bio_salvador_freixedo&gt;{{cite book|last=Domingo Cuadriello|first=Jorge|title=Los Españoles En Las Letras Cubanas Durante El Siglo XX: Diccionario Bio-Bibliográfico|year=2002|publisher=Editorial Renacimiento|location=Spain|isbn=84-8472-069-1|pages=74|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iWix-UC0VL8C&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq=salvador+freixedo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QKnfUNaGC9DOqAGiuoGQCA&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwCTha#v=onepage&amp;q=salvador%20freixedo&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the bosom of a deeply religious family (his brother was a [[Jesuit]] and his sister was a [[nun]]). When he was five his family moved to Orense, and it is there where he started his first studies, attending primary school at the''Saint Vicent Paul'' nuns and secondary school at the ''Institute Otero Pedrayo''. At the age of 16 he joins the [[Jesuits|Jesuit Order]] and is ordained [[priest]] in 1953, in [[Santander, Spain|Santander]], Spain. He was a member of the jesuit order for thirty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Denzler|first=Brenda|title=The Lure of the Edge: Scientific Passions, Religious Beliefs, and the Pursuit of Ufos|year=2001|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|location=USA|isbn=0-520-22432-9|pages=127|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BnQU2Q65lWsC&amp;pg=PA127&amp;dq=salvador+freixedo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=t5vfUPrhKILkqQHRwYCoCA&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=salvador%20freixedo&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He lived in a number of countries in the Americas from 1947, in his role as Jesuit, teaching ''History of the Church'' in the ''Interdiocese Seminary'' of [[Santo Domingo]], and founding the ''Movement of the Christian Working Youth'' in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]]. He was the national vice-assesor of this movement in [[La Habana]].

He studied&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Freixedo | first=Salvador| title=¡Defendámonos de los dioses! | publisher=Editorial Quintá | location=Madrid | year=1984 | isbn=84-398-2245-6 | pages=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[humanities]] in [[Salamanca]], [[philosophy]] in [[Universidad Pontificia Comillas|Universidad de Comillas]] ([[Santander, Spain|Santander]]),&lt;ref name="bio_salvador_freixedo"/&gt; [[theology]] in [[Alma College]] in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] (California), [[Asceticism|ascetics]] in [[Mont Laurier]] (Canada), [[psychology]] in the ''University of Los Angeles'' (California) and in [[Fordham University]] of [[New York City]].

Since the 1950s, his critical position on the postures of the [[Catholic Church]] and the publication of some books led him to jail and to the expulsion from countries like [[Cuba]] and [[Venezuela]], and also to his exclusion from the Jesuit Order in 1969.&lt;ref name="expelled1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Uría|first=Ignacio|title=Iglesia y revolución en Cuba|year=2011|publisher=Ediciones Encuentro|location=Spain|isbn=978-84-9920-088-0|pages=227–229|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N1klq7qCG4gC&amp;pg=PA227&amp;dq=salvador+freixedo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=D67fUMCoNJKTqwGu-4GgBA&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwBjhk#v=onepage&amp;q=salvador%20freixedo&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="expelled2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Virtuoso Arrieta|first=Francisco José|title=Justicia Social en Venezuela: La Preocupación Social de la Compañía de Jesús en Venezuela, 1968-1992|year=2004|publisher=[[Universidad Catolica Andres Bello]]|location=Venezuela|isbn=980-244-380-8|pages=87|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BlowUplteEQC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=freixedo+venezuela&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9LPfUPiiE4WzqgGL5IDwAg&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=freixedo%20venezuela&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1970s he has dedicated himself to research in the field of [[parapsychology]], in particular the [[UFO]] phenomenon and its relation to religion and human history. He has published a number of books on the subject, and founded the ''Mexican Institute of Paranormal Studies'', of which he presided over the ''First Great International Congress''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ridpath|first=Ian|title=Flying saucers thirty years on|journal=New Scientist|date=14 July 1977|volume=75|issue=1060|pages=79|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0ev36vp4V9UC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=salvador+freixedo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RqTfUKv0F9SzqQHWpIG4BQ&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=salvador%20freixedo&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  organized by the former.

*In 1968, while in [[Puerto Rico]], he wrote ''My Church Sleeps'' in which he stated the Church was narrow-minded and denounced what he saw as the poor evangelical spirit of some of its leaders and what he believed to be the irrationality of some of its dogmas, for which he was excluded from the [[Jesuit Order]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bucchioni |first1=Eugene |title=The Puerto Rican Experience: A Sociological Sourcebook |year=1973 |publisher=Littlefield, Adams &amp; Co.|location=USA|isbn=0-87471-162-2|pages=98 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IEJ51NRWvfUC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=salvador+freixedo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=t5vfUPrhKILkqQHRwYCoCA&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=salvador%20freixedo&amp;f=false|author2=Francesco Cordasco}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Badillo|first=David A.|title=Latinos and the New Immigrant Church|year=2006|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location=USA|isbn=0-8018-8388-1|pages=184|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A9W3OekHm6kC&amp;pg=PA184&amp;dq=salvador+freixedo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=t5vfUPrhKILkqQHRwYCoCA&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=salvador%20freixedo&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Spain]] his book was banned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jesuit suspended in Puerto Rico|url=http://archive.catholicherald.co.uk/article/22nd-august-1969/2/jesuit-suspended-in-puerto-rico|accessdate=2 January 2013|newspaper=Catholic Herald|date=22 August 1969|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the U.S. [[National Center for Education Statistics]], [[school violence]] is a serious problem.&lt;ref name="NCES"&gt;National Center for Education Statistics. (2008).

The rate was three times higher among males than among females.  In the 12 months antedating the survey, 7.8% of high school students reported having been threatened or injured with a weapon on school property at least once, with the prevalence rate among males twice that as among females.  In the 12 months antedating the survey, 12.4% of students had been in a physical fight on school property at least once.  The rate among males was twice the rate found among females.  In the 30 days antedating the survey, 5.5% of students reported that because they did not feel safe, they did not go to school on at least one day. The rates for males and females were approximately equal.

Five percent of teachers in urban schools were physically attacked, with smaller percentages in suburban and rural schools.  Other members of school staffs are also at risk for violent attack, with school bus drivers being particularly vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1097/00043764-199701000-00009 | last1 = Peek-Asa | first1 = C. | last2 = Howard | first2 = J. | last3 = Vargas | first3 = L. | last4 = Kraus | first4 = J.

During 2007–08, teachers’ reports of being threatened or physically attacked by students varied according to the instructional level of their school. A greater percentage of secondary school teachers (8 percent) than elementary school teachers (7 percent) reported being threatened with injury by a student, and this pattern held for teachers in suburban schools as well as for teachers in rural schools (figure 5.2 and table 5.1).&lt;ref&gt;Robers, S., Kemp, J., and Truman, J.

==Controversies==

===Lax school authorities===
In 2005, on a school bus in Montgomery County, Maryland, an 11-year-old girl was attacked by a group of several older boys who, the girl said, grabbed her breasts and feigned sex acts.  Also in 2005 on a school bus in [[Colonial Heights, Virginia]], south of Richmond, three boys and two girls aged 8 to 13 held an 11-year-old girl down in the back of the bus and sexually assaulted her.&lt;ref name = "Williamson"&gt;Williamson, E., &amp; Aratani, L. (June 14, 2005). [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/13/AR2005061301642.html As school bus sexual assaults rise, danger often overlooked]. ''Washington Post''. B01.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Maryland case, the child's mother, not the school, called the police, although a school administrator did notify the girl's mother (the students were not charged with sexual assault because the police mishandled the paperwork). In the Virginia case, the girl told her mother and was taken to a police station, prompting coordinated investigations by the police and the school. The bus driver testified she saw the incident happening but never stopped the bus. The girl was dropped off at her normal bus stop.

In 2008, the [[Baltimore]] School District failed to intervene in an act of violence committed against a teacher. A student had taken a [[video]] of a peer beating her art teacher. School officials ignored the problem until the video was posted on [[MySpace]].&lt;ref name="nuefeld"&gt;Nuefeld, S. (April 10, 2008). [http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/local/baltimore_city/bal-te.md.ci.teacher10sapr10,0,601646] School violence appalls officials]. ''Baltimore Sun''.&lt;/ref&gt; Some cases of school violence have not been brought to the attention of the authorities because school administrators have not wanted their schools labeled unsafe under the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act.&lt;ref name="Williamson"/&gt; With or without NCLB, in the US, there has been a history of underreporting violent incidents occurring in schools.&lt;ref name="Schon"&gt;Schonfeld, I.S. (2006). School violence. In E.K. Kelloway, J. Barling, &amp; J.J. Hurrell, Jr. (Eds). [http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED494566.pdf] ''Handbook of workplace violence'' (pp. 169–229). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Office of the New York State Comptroller. (2006). ''Reporting of violent and disruptive incidents by public schools'' (Rep. No. 2005-S-38). Albany: Author.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;California Legislative Analyst Office. (2009). ''Review of school crime reporting''. Sacramento: Author.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The media===
[[School shootings]] are rare and unusual forms of school violence, and account for less than 1% of violent crimes in public schools, with an average of 16.5 deaths per year from 2001–2008.&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt; There exists an uneven number of male versus female perpetrators of school shootings, where males outnumber females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robertz|first1=F.J.|title=Deadly Dreams: What Motivates School Shootings?|journal=Scientific American|date=August 1, 2007|pages=54-59|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/deadly-dreams/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators claim that media coverage encourages school violence.&lt;ref name="brown"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/09620210802492807 | last1 = Brown | first1 = J. | last2 = Munn | first2 = P. | year = 2008 | title = School violence as a social problem: Charting the rise of the problem and the emerging specialist field | url = | journal = International Studies in Sociology of Education | volume = 18 | issue = 3–4| pages = 219–230 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the press would likely have been faulted if it did not cover serious threats to public safety such as the [[Virginia Tech massacre]], [[Columbine High School massacre|Columbine massacre]], and [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]].&lt;ref&gt;Zarembo, A. (June 18, 2016). Are the media complicit in mass shootings? ''Los Angeles Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stephen Gilson''' is an American [[Theory|theorist]] and [[Policy analysis|policy analyst]] who is best known for his work in [[disability]], [[Multiculturalism|diversity]], and [[health policy]] through the lens of legitimacy theory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccids.umaine.edu/contact-info-directions/orono/gilson/ |title=Orono Office - Stephen Gilson |publisher=University of Main |accessdate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cgpublisher1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://t05.cgpublisher.com/proposals/14/index_html |title=cgpublisher.com is being upgraded |publisher=T05.cgpublisher.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QvFGAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22Explanatory+legitimacy+theory%22&amp;q=Depoy&amp;pgis=1 |title=Encyclopedia of disability - Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QvFGAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22Explanatory+legitimacy+theory%22&amp;q=Explanatory+legitimacy+theory&amp;pgis=1 |title=Encyclopedia of disability - Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and disjuncture theory.  Co-authored with [[Elizabeth DePoy]], Gilson developed ''Explanatory Legitimacy Theory''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Rethinking+Disability&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;btnG=Search |title=Rethinking Disability - Google Scholar |publisher=Scholar.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through that lens, Gilson analyzes how [[Social group|population group]] membership is assigned, is based on [[Politics|political]] purpose, and is met with formal responses that serve both intentionally and unintentionally to perpetuate segregation, economic [[status quo]], and inter-group tension.  Additionally, co-authored with DePoy, Gilson developed ''Disjuncture Theory''.  This theory explains disability as an interactive “ill-fit” between bodies (broadly defined) and environments (broadly defined).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a906422769~db=all~jumptype=rss |title=Taylor &amp; Francis Online :: Designer diversity: moving beyond categorical branding - Journal of Comparative Social Welfare - Volume 25, Issue 1 |publisher=Informaworld.com |date=2008-12-12 |accessdate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h5c3EdbYWUkC&amp;pg=PA267&amp;lpg=PA267&amp;dq=Healing+the+disjuncture:+Social+work+disability+practice&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=i1HbwVsoja&amp;sig=kqUPhMYExyvqLaPh-YS1Y-7tXlQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7etlSsm4HYaeMdbWracB&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1 |title=Comprehensive Handbook of Social Work and Social Welfare: The profession of ... - Karen Marlaine Sowers, Barbara W. White, Catherine N. Dulmus - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilson has applied legitimacy theory and disjuncture theory to the analysis and enactment of health policy and practices related to [[Health care system|access]] and to [[Preventive medicine|illness prevention]].  Along with DePoy, Gilson has implemented his vision of socially just policy based on universal access principles through the creation of a [[web portal]] that renders existing illness prevention information accessible to individuals across diversity category boundaries.&lt;ref name="cgpublisher1"/&gt;

Gilson has received invitations to keynote at national and international [[Academic conference|conference]]s on disability studies and distinguished lectures at [[University of Illinois at Chicago]], [[University of Michigan|University of Michigan at Ann Arbor]], [[Smith College]], [[New York University|NYU]], [[University of North Carolina]], [[Ono Academic College]], Research Institute for Health and Medical Professions, and others.

== Biography ==
Gilson was born in 1950 in [[Long Beach, California]], to a family of three—an older brother, Michael, and his mother and father, Janet and Arnold Gilson.  Later, in 1955, a younger sister, Nancy, would join them.  He spent years as an [[artist]] before earning a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in 1973, and [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in 1991 from the [[University of Nebraska Medical Center]].

===Recent activities===
In ''Rethinking Disability'', first published in 2004, and ''Disability as Disjuncture'', currently in press, Gilson with co-author [[Elizabeth DePoy]], takes on the essentialist nature of current diversity categories with a particular focus on disability, laying bare the value foundation and political and economic purpose of “disability category” assignment and social, professional and community response.  His subsequent works, also co-authored with DePoy, include ''The Human Experience'', published in 2007, ''Evaluation Practice'' (2008), ''Studying Disability'' (2010), and selected [[essay]]s and [[Academic publishing|paper]]s.  This [[scholarship]] applies legitimacy and disjuncture theories to understanding theories of human description and explanation and their purposive, political use in diverse “helping professional” worlds.

Recently, Gilson, with co-author DePoy, applies design theory and practice to the analysis of diversity categories, their membership and their maintenance.  In his non-profit work, he has applied this theory to the development of inexpensive, aesthetically designed [[prototype]]s, [[Plan|strategies]], and products that enhance the ability of all people to engage in healthy behaviors.  In the spring 2010, Gilson received funding to study campus architectures as symbols of campus cultural policy.{{Clarify|date=March 2012}}  He has also applied design and branding to the development of [[robotics]] for non-stigmatized [[Human enhancement|augmentation of human function]].

Gilson is currently [[professor]] and co-coordinator of Interdisciplinary Disability Studies at the [[University of Maine]] and a principal of ASTOS Innovations, a non-profit corporation devoted to improving equality of access to community resources in local, national, and global environments.  ASTOS Innovations designs and develops model access [[solution]]s.{{what|date=January 2018}}  Gilson also holds an appointment as Senior Research Fellow.{{Clarify|date=March 2012}} Ono Academic College's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ono.ac.il/?lang=en |title=Ono Academic College website}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research Institute for Health and Medical Professions, [[Kiryat Ono]], [[Israel]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3079">The '''Tellurometer''' was the first successful microwave [[electronic distance measurement]] equipment. The name derives from the Latin ''tellus'', meaning Earth.

[[File:Line of sight to Plynlimon - geograph.org.uk - 963435.jpg|thumb|Typical distance measurements were between mountain tops]]

==History==
The original Tellurometer, known as the Micro-Distancer MRA 1, was introduced in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;[http://celebrating200years.noaa.gov/distance_tools/tellurometermra1.html Tellurometer MRA 1]&lt;/ref&gt; It was invented by [[Trevor Wadley|Dr. Trevor Lloyd Wadley]] of the Telecommunications Research Laboratory of the [[South Africa]]n [[Council for Scientific and Industrial Research]] (CSIR), also responsible for the [[Wadley Loop]] receiver, which allowed precision tuning over wide bands, a task that had previously required switching out multiple [[crystal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qsl.net/vk3jeg/b_wadley.html Wadley Loop HF receivers]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
The Tellurometer emits an electronic wave: the remote station reradiates the incoming wave in a similar wave of more complex [[modulation]], and the resulting phase shift was a measure of the distance travelled. The results appear on a [[cathode ray tube]] with circular sweep. This instrument penetrates haze and mist in daylight or darkness and has a normal range of 30–50&amp;nbsp;km but can extend up to 70&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name=history&gt;[http://www.fig.net/pub/fig2008/papers/hs01/hs01_03_sturman_wright_2833.pdf History of the Tellurometer]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==
The Tellurometer design yields high accuracy distance measurements over [[geodesy|geodetic]] distances, but it is also useful for second order survey work, especially in areas where the terrain was rough and/or the temperatures extreme.

Examples of remote locations mapped using Tellurometer surveys are [[Adams Bluff]], [[Churchill Mountains]], [[Cook Mountains]], [[Jacobsen Glacier]], [[Mount Albright]], [[Mount Predoehl]], [[Mount Summerson]], [[Queen Elizabeth Range (Antarctica)|Sherwin Peak]] and [[Vogt Peak]].

The MRB2 or Hydrodist was a marine version&lt;ref name=history /&gt; that was used in coastal surveys and calibrating ships using other survey navigation systems.

They were used by the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] in the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ham (Editor)|first=Paul|title=Captain Bullen's War|year=2009|publisher=Harper Collins|location=Australia|isbn=978 0 7322 8843 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial exploitation==
[[Plessey]], the [[United Kingdom|British]] electronics company, formed a new subsidiary known as ''Tellurometer (Pty) Limited'' in the 1960s to manufacture the product and to develop and sell derivatives.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;  The Company subsequently introduced numerical displays, solid state transmitters, integrated circuits and eventually [[microprocessor]]s for the product.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3097">"'''The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Scheherazade'''" is a short-story by American author [[Edgar Allan Poe]] (1809–1849). It was published in the February 1845 issue of ''[[Godey's Lady's Book]]'' and was intended as a partly humorous sequel to the celebrated collection of Middle Eastern tales ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sova, Dawn B. (2001). ''Edgar Allan Poe A to Z: The Essential Reference to His Life and Work'' (Paperback ed.). New York: Checkmark Books, pg 237. {{ISBN|978-0-8160-4161-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
The tale depicts the eighth and final voyage of [[Sinbad the Sailor]], along with the various mysteries Sinbad and his crew encounter; the anomalies are then described as footnotes to the story. While [[List of One Thousand and One Nights characters#Shahryar|the King]] is uncertain — except in the case of the elephants carrying the world on the back of the turtle — that these mysteries are real, they are actual modern events that occurred in various places during, or before, Poe's lifetime. The story ends with the king in such disgust at the outlandish tales [[Scheherazade]] has just woven, that he has her executed the next day.

;Wonders and anomalies described
*[[Coral rag|Coralite]] ("an island, many hundreds of miles in circumference ... built in the middle of the sea by a colony of little things like caterpillars")
*[[Maelzel's Chess Player]] ("a man out of brass and wood, and leather ... with such ingenuity that he would have beaten at chess, all the race of mankind")
*[[Antlion]] pits ("myriads of monstrous animals with horns resembling scythes upon their heads ... dig for themselves vast caverns in the soil, of a funnel shape")
*[[Mammoth Cave]] ("a cave that ran to the distance of thirty or forty miles within the bowels of the earth ... far more spacious and more magnificent palaces ... there flowed immense rivers as black as ebony, and swarming with fish that had no eyes")
*[[Difference engine|Babbage's calculating machine]] ("constructed ... a creature ... so great were its reasoning powers that, in a second, it performed calculations of ... the united labor of fifty thousand fleshy men for a year")
* [[Hot air balloon]] ("This terrible fowl had no head that we could perceive, but was fashioned entirely of belly, which was of a prodigious fatness and roundness, of a soft-looking substance, smooth, shining and striped with various colors. ... in the interior of which we distinctly saw human beings ...  and then let fall upon our heads a heavy sack which proved to be filled with sand!'")

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7176">'''Tolerance tax''' (Toleranzgebührer) was a [[tax]] that was levied against [[Jews]] of [[Hungary]], then part of the [[Austrian Empire]], between 1747 and 1797.&lt;ref name="jg"&gt;JewishGen. Hungary: Assorted Census Records, 1781-1850 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: The Generations Network, Inc., 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tax was based on the German statute that a Jew was obliged to pay a certain tax to be "tolerated".&lt;ref&gt;Wine and thorns in Tokay Valley: Jewish life in Hungary : the history of Abaújszántó, by Zahava Szász Stessel, Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 1995, p. 50-51&lt;/ref&gt;

==Under Maria Theresa (1740–1780)==

In 1747, during the reign of Empress [[Maria Theresa]], the Jews of Hungary were taxed for the privilege of remaining in the empire, and were threatened with expulsion if they did not pay.&lt;ref name="jg"/&gt; 

On September 1, 1749, the delegates of the Hungarian Jews, except those from [[Szatmár]] County, assembled at Pressburg and met a royal commission, which informed them that they would be expelled from the country if they did not pay this tax. The frightened Jews at once agreed to do so; and the commission then demanded a yearly tax of 50,000 [[Austro-Hungarian gulden|gulden]]. This sum being excessive, the delegates protested; and although the queen had fixed 30,000 gulden as the minimum tax, they were finally able to compromise on the payment of 20,000 gulden a year for a period of eight years. The delegates were to apportion this amount among the districts; the districts, their respective sums among the communities; and the communities, theirs among the individual members.

The queen confirmed this agreement of the commission, except the eight-year clause, changing the period to three years, which she subsequently made five. The agreement, thus ratified by the queen, was brought on November 26 before the courts, which were powerless to relieve the Jews from the payment of this ''Malkegeld'' (queen's money), as they called it.

The Jews, thus burdened by new taxes, thought the time ripe for taking steps to remove their oppressive [[Disabilities (Jewish)|disabilities]]. While still at Presburg the delegates had brought their grievances before the mixed commission that was called ''delegata in puncto tolerantialis taxae et gravaminum Judeorum commissio mixta''. These complaints pictured the distress of the Jews of that time. They were not allowed to live in [[Croatia]] and [[Slavonia]], in [[Baranya (county)|Baranya]] and [[Heves County (former)|Heves]] Counties, or in several free royal towns and localities; nor might they visit the markets there. At Stuhlweissenburg ([[Székesfehérvár]]) they had to pay a poll-tax of 1 gulden, 30 [[kreuzer]] if they entered the city during the day, if only for an hour. In many places they might not even stay overnight. They therefore begged permission to settle, or at least to visit the fairs, in Croatia and Slavonia and in those places from which they had been driven in consequence of the jealousy of the [[Greeks]] and the merchants.

The Jews also had to pay heavier bridge-and ferry-tolls than the Christians; at Nagyszombat ([[Trnava]]) they had to pay three times the ordinary sum, namely, for the driver, for the vehicle, and for the animal drawing the same; and in three villages belonging to the same district they had to pay [[Toll road|toll]], although there was no toll-gate. Jews living on the estates of the nobles had to give their wives and children as [[Security interest#Pledge|pledge]]s for [[arrears]] of taxes. In Upper Hungary they asked for the revocation of the Tolerance tax imposed by the chamber of Zips County ([[Szepes]], [[Spiš]]), on the ground that otherwise the Jews living there would have to pay two such taxes; and they asked also to be relieved from a similar tax paid to the Diet. Finally, they requested that Jewish [[artisan]]s might be allowed to follow their trades in their homes undisturbed.

The commission laid these complaints before the Queen, indicating the manner in which they could be relieved; and their suggestions were subsequently willed by the queen and made into law.

The queen relieved the Jews from the Tolerance tax in Upper Hungary only. In regard to the other complaints she ordered that the Jews should specify them in detail, and that the government should remedy them insofar as they came under its jurisdiction.

The Tolerance tax had hardly been instituted when [[Michael Hirsch]] petitioned the government to be appointed primate of the Hungarian Jews in order to be able to settle difficulties that might arise among them, and to collect the tax. The government did not recommend Hirsch, but decided that in case the Jews should refuse to pay, it might be advisable to appoint a primate to adjust the matter.

Before the end of the period of five years the delegates of the Jews again met the commission at Pressburg ([[Bratislava]]) and offered to increase the amount of their tax to 25,000 gulden a year if the queen would promise that it should remain at that sum for the next ten years. The queen had other plans, however; not only did she dismiss the renewed ''gravamina'' of the Jews, but rather imposed stiffer regulations upon them. Their tax of 20,000 gulden was increased to 30,000 gulden in 1760; to 50,000 in 1772; to 80,000 in 1778; and to 160,000 in 1813.

The method of calculating the Tolerance tax varied over time and location, according to the size of household, occupation, and income-producing assets.&lt;ref name="jg"/&gt;

==Under Joseph II==

In 1783, Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], the son of Maria Theresa, allowed Jews to settle in [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]], while enacting a tolerance tax, which the Jews had to pay to the town.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Budapest.html The Virtual Jewish History Tour Budapest, By Rebecca Weiner]&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1789, the Jews paid a tolerance tax of 4 guilder per family, a [[Kosher tax|tax on kosher meat]], a marriage tax, a tax on the synagogues and cemeteries of 100 guilder per year, and a quota tax of 50 guilder per year.&lt;ref name="jg2"/&gt;

In 1797, after the death of Joseph II, the tolerance tax and the taxes on homes and properties were replaced by a candle tax on Jewish religious candles.&lt;ref name="jg2"&gt;[http://www.jewishgen.org/Yizkor/rzeszow/rze047.html JewishGen, The History of the Jews of Rzeszow, Chapter 7, p. 47]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Croatia, Slavonia, and Dalmatia, further rights were granted to Jews in 1840, but the "tolerance tax" remained in force. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.porges.net/JewishHistoryOfYugoslavia.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Twentieth Century Society''' ('''C20''') is a British [[Charitable organization|charity]] which campaigns for the [[Historic preservation|preservation]] of [[architectural]] heritage from 1914 onwards.&lt;ref name="C20about"&gt;{{cite web |title=About us |publisher=Twentieth Century Society |url=http://www.c20society.org.uk/about-us/ |accessdate=25 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The society's interests embrace buildings and artefacts that characterise 20th-century Britain.&lt;ref name="C20about"/&gt; It is formally recognised as one of the [[Amenity society|National Amenity Societies]], and as such is a statutory consultee on alterations to [[listed building]]s within its period of interest, and must be notified of any proposed work to a listed building which involves any element of demolition.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=[[Department for Communities and Local Government]] |title=Arrangements for handling heritage applications Direction 2015 |publisher=www.gov.uk |date=24 March 2015 |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/arrangements-for-handling-heritage-applications-direction-2015 |accessdate=5 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The society was formed as The Thirties Society in 1979, the year in which the prominent "Thirties – British art and design before the War" exhibition was shown at the [[Hayward Gallery]].&lt;ref name=c20history&gt;{{cite web |first1=Gavin |last1=Stamp |authorlink1=Gavin Stamp |first2=Alan |last2=Powers |authorlink2=Alan Powers |title=A Brief History |publisher=Twentieth Century Society |url=http://www.c20society.org.uk/about-us/ |accessdate=25 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its establishment was inspired by and loosely modelled on the [[Victorian Society]], which aims to protect pre-1914 Victorian and Edwardian buildings. [[Bevis Hillier]] was the first president, and [[Clive Aslet]] the first honorary secretary.&lt;ref name=c20history/&gt; In 1992, the society changed its name to The Twentieth Century Society, as it was felt that "Thirties Society" failed to indicate its interest in the protection of buildings from other periods as well.&lt;ref name=c20history/&gt;

==Notable cases and campaigns==
*The catalyst for establishing the society in 1979 was the proposal to replace Sir [[Edwin Cooper (architect)|Edwin Cooper]]'s classical 1928 building for [[Lloyds of London]] with a new building by [[Richard Rogers]]. The society's protests were too late, and Rogers' [[Lloyd's building]] was completed in 1986 (and was itself [[listed building|listed]] Grade I in 2011).&lt;ref name=c20history/&gt;
*The society's first serious high-profile case was that of the [[Art Deco]] [[Firestone tyre factory]] of 1928 on the [[Golden Mile (Brentford)|Great West Road]] in West London. The building was demolished by its owners over a [[bank holiday]] weekend in August 1980 in anticipation of its being listed.&lt;ref name=c20history/&gt;
*In 1985–6 the society campaigned against the wholesale replacement of the traditional K-series [[red telephone box]]es designed by Sir [[Giles Gilbert Scott]] between 1926 and 1936. The campaign attracted much public support, and led to a number of boxes being listed.&lt;ref name=c20history/&gt;
*In 1987, the society successfully campaigned for the listing of [[Bracken House, London]], the former home of the ''[[Financial Times]]'', designed by Sir [[Albert Richardson]] and built between 1955 and 1958. This was the first post-[[Second World War]] building to be listed, the previous cut-off date having been 1939.&lt;ref name=c20history/&gt; 
*In 1993–4, the society successfully persuaded the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] to take into care and open to the public [[2 Willow Road]], [[Hampstead]], completed in 1939, and designed by the Hungarian architect [[Ernő Goldfinger]] for his own occupation.&lt;ref name="C20about"/&gt; 
* In the 1980s and 1990s the society campaigned repeatedly for the preservation and listing of [[Bankside Power Station]], designed by Sir [[Giles Gilbert Scott]], constructed in two phases in 1947–52 and 1958–63, and decommissioned in 1981. The campaign was ultimately successful, and the building reopened as the [[Tate Modern]] art gallery in 2000.&lt;ref name="C20about"/&gt;

'''University of Florida Center for African Studies''' (CAS) is a center within of the [[University of Florida College of Liberal Arts and Sciences|College of Liberal Arts and Sciences]] at the [[University of Florida]]. The Center provides teaching and research into issues of African languages, humanities, social sciences, agriculture, business, engineering, education, fine arts, environmental studies, conservation, journalism, and law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.africa.ufl.edu/ Overall Scope of CAS]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center for African Studies currently offers undergraduate and postgraduate study programs in numerous Africa-related fields.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.africa.ufl.edu/graduateminor.html African Studies offered at UF]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
The Center for African Studies is in the College of Liberal Arts &amp; Sciences at the University of Florida. As a National Resource Center for African Studies, their mission&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://africa.ufl.edu/about/|title=About Us|website=africa.ufl.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; is to promote excellence in teaching and research on Africa in all the disciplines at the University of Florida. The Center also disseminates knowledge about Africa to the wider community through an integrated outreach program to schools, colleges, community groups, and businesses. Central to this mission is sustaining contacts and expanding interactive linkages with individuals and institutions on the African continent. In addition to undergraduate education, the Center promotes and supports graduate studies as essential for the development of a continuing community of Africanist scholars.

The Center has over 100 affiliated teaching and research faculty in a wide variety of fields, including: languages, the humanities, the social sciences, agriculture, business, engineering, education, fine arts, environmental studies and conservation, journalism, and law. A number of faculty members with appointments wholly or partially within the Center have facilitated the development of a core curriculum in African Studies in support of the undergraduate minor and graduate certificate programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://africa.ufl.edu/people/faculty/|title=Faculty|website=africa.ufl.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A full-time Outreach Director&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://africa.ufl.edu/people/center-staff/|title=Center Staff|website=africa.ufl.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; oversees an active program that provides ongoing training opportunities for K-12 teachers and educators from postsecondary institutions as well as outreach for business, media, and community groups.

CAS is funded in part by the U.S. Department of Education Title VI National Resource Center program&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.ed.gov/programs/iegpsnrc/index.html|title=National Resource Centers|date=2017-11-27|website=www2.ed.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; which supports research, teaching, outreach, and development of international linkages. It is the only National Resource Center for Africa located in the southeastern US, and the only one in a sub-tropical zone.
[[File:UF CAS Historical Marker.jpg|thumb|Center for African Studies Historical Marker on Grinter Lawn]]
The Center thus plays a pivotal role in addressing issues critical for understanding Africa in the global context. At a time when the University of Florida is expanding its international dimension, a major component of the Center for African Studies’ mission is to work with the rest of the University in promoting Africa-related programs on the campus and beyond.

== Program in African Languages ==
The Program in African Languages&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://africa.ufl.edu/african-languages/|title=African Languages|website=africa.ufl.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the Center for African Studies’ central components in its mission to work with the rest of the University in promoting Africa-related studies on the campus and beyond. In addition to undergraduate education, the Center for African Studies promotes and supports graduate studies as essential part for the development of a continuing community of Africanist scholars. In this regard, the CAS, in close collaboration with the Department of Languages, Literatures, &amp; Cultures&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://languages.ufl.edu/|title=Languages, Literatures, and Cultures {{!}} University of Florida|website=languages.ufl.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;, has committed itself to developing and maintaining a viable, comprehensive and dynamic program in African languages.

Currently the Center for African Studies offers language training in Akan, Amharic, Arabic, Swahili, Wolof, Xhosa, and Yoruba, although other languages have been offered in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://africa.ufl.edu/african-languages/pal/|title=Program in African Languages (PAL)|website=africa.ufl.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Florida is only the second university nationwide to offer an African languages major.

== African Studies Library Collection ==
The African Studies Collection at the University of Florida Libraries&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cms.uflib.ufl.edu/|title=George A. Smathers Libraries|last=Libraries|first=George A. Smathers|website=cms.uflib.ufl.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; is recognized as a unique resource within the University of Florida's George A. Smathers libraries, ranking among the best such collections in the U.S. Its holdings include disciplinary topics from the natural sciences and applied fields such as agriculture and public health, to the social sciences, humanities, and professions. Reflecting the great breadth and depth of these academic and professional programs, the African Studies Collection facilitates interdisciplinary and applied approaches to the study of the continent, its flora and fauna, peoples and cultures, natural resources and wildlife for which UF's African Studies programs are best known. The African Studies Collection has a collaborative partnership with the UF Center for African Studies, which contributes generous funding for library materials and services through its U.S. Department of Education Title VI grant as a National Resource Center. 

Some of the African Studies collections are available through the UF Digital Collections, accessible online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ufdc.ufl.edu/africa1|title=African Studies Collections|website=ufdc.ufl.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sub-collections within the African Studies Library Digital Collection include The Arts of Africa = Les Arts d'Afrique&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ufdc.ufl.edu/artaf|title=The Arts of Africa = Les Arts d'Afrique|website=ufdc.ufl.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Photographs of Africa Collection&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ufdc.ufl.edu/fotoaf|title=Photographs of Africa Collection|website=ufdc.ufl.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Wildlife Conservation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ufdc.ufl.edu/wildlife|title=Wildlife Conservation|website=ufdc.ufl.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Jean Marie Derscheid&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ufdc.ufl.edu/derscheid|title=Jean Marie Derscheid|website=ufdc.ufl.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Onitsha Market Literature&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ufdc.ufl.edu/onitsha|title=Onitsha Market Literature|website=ufdc.ufl.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;, George Fortune Collection&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ufdc.ufl.edu/fortune|title=George Fortune Collection|website=ufdc.ufl.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and Martin Rikli Photographs Collection&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ufdc.ufl.edu/rikli|title=Martin Rikli Photographs Collection|website=ufdc.ufl.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Notable print holdings (from which many of the digital collections derive) include the George Fortune collection of Southern Bantu linguistics (especially Shona), the Donald Abraham collection of Lusophone culture and history (concentrating on Angola and Mozambique), Gwendolen M. Carter’s materials relating to the South African liberation struggle,  Bob Campbell's photographs of Dian Fossey&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-03-01|title=Dian Fossey|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dian_Fossey&amp;oldid=828260452|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Karisoke Research Center&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-02-19|title=Karisoke Research Center|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Karisoke_Research_Center&amp;oldid=826527977|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and Martin Rikli’s photographic albums of Ethiopia during the Italian invasion and occupation of 1935-1936. Finding aids for these and related manuscript collections, most of which are yet to be digitized, are available online. 

For maps of Africa, see also the African Map Collection&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ufdc.ufl.edu/mapaf|title=African Maps|website=ufdc.ufl.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; which offers maps dating from the 16th through the 21st centuries, including examples of work from the most important cartographers and representing some of the most important maps from the Age of Exploration to the present day.

== African Studies Quarterly ==
The Center for African Studies founded the African Studies Quarterly (ASQ)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://asq.africa.ufl.edu/about/|title=About|website=asq.africa.ufl.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; to promote research on Africa beyond that undertaken by University of Florida faculty and graduate students. It is an interdisciplinary, fully refereed, online open access journal dedicated to publishing the finest scholarship relating to the African continent.

ASQ invites the submission of original manuscripts on a full range of topics related to Africa in all areas. To qualify for consideration, submissions must meet the scholarships standards within the appropriate discipline and be of interest to an interdisciplinary readership. As an electronic journal, ASQ welcomes submissions that are of a time-sensitive nature.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1072">A '''voting bloc''' is a group of [[voting|voters]] that are strongly motivated by a specific common concern or group of concerns to the point that such specific concerns tend to dominate their voting patterns, causing them to vote together in [[election]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bloc&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Beliefnet]] identifies 12 main religious blocs in [[American politics]], including e.g. the "Religious Right", whose concerns are dominated by [[Religion and politics in the United States |religious]] and sociocultural issues and "White Bread Protestants", who, while also conservative, tend to care more about economic issues.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.beliefnet.com/News/Politics/2004/10/The-Twelve-Tribes-Of-American-Politics.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;  The result is that each of these groups votes [[wikt:en bloc|en bloc]] in elections.

[[Women]] played a variety of roles in the [[Arab Spring]], but its impact on women and [[women's rights|their rights]] is unclear. The Arab Spring was a series of [[demonstration (people)|demonstrations]], [[protests]], and [[civil wars]] against [[authoritarian]] regimes that started in [[Tunisia]] and spread to much of the [[Arab world]].

At this time, [[Muslim female political leaders|women's political participation]] was expanding greatly compared to before. They were participating in anti-government demonstrations and the protection of their rights for higher education by establishing a higher education system. Egyptian women have had a history of being active members of trade unions, organizations, informal networks, and online communities. Even though there are only a few women in politics in Egypt, those involved have advanced activism. Women's involvement in the Arab Spring went beyond direct participation in the protests to include [[cyberactivism]]. Social media has enabled women to be able to contribute to demonstrations as organizers, journalists, and political activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Non-Western Social Movements and Participatory Democracy: Protest in the Age of Transnationalism|last1=Arbatli|first1=Ekim|last2=Rosenberg|first2=Dina|date=2007|publisher=Springer International Publishing|pages=161–170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arab women played a key role in changing the views of many. They were important revolutionists during the Arab Spring, and many activists hoped the Spring would boost women's rights, but its impact has not matched expectations. Women face discrimination in the Arab world and since expanding their roles and participation was not a priority for other revolutionary forces, they ended up sacrificing a lot with no gain in the end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Arab Women and Arab Spring: Challenges and Opportunities|last1=Olimat|first1=Muhamad|date=2014|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Islamist]] parties have risen to power in [[sovereign state|states]] that experienced changes of government, and some view their power as a major threat to women's status.

==Background==
Sixty percent of the population of the Arab world is under the age of 30, and over half are female.&lt;ref name="Ms. Magazine"&gt;{{cite news|last=Morgan|first=Robin|title=Women of the Arab Spring|url=http://www.msmagazine.com/spring2011/womenofthearabspring.asp|accessdate=18 March 2013|work=Ms. Magazine|date=Spring 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arab Spring countries have a poor record on most gender issues, but have successfully reduced gender gaps in areas like education and healthcare.&lt;ref name="World Bank report" /&gt; In the years leading up to the Arab Spring, there had been an authoritarian form of government. These nations intended to make more comprehensive political frameworks that depended on the rule of law and accountable governance. Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya faced this distinctly. In Tunisia, a Revolution was taking place, and the people from neglected rural areas were holding demonstrations. These protesters were able to find a common cause which empowered them to start a labor movement that was direct it towards the capital. In Egypt, uprisings composed of urban and cosmopolitan people all throughout cities. Meanwhile, in Libya, ragtag groups of armed rebels in the eastern regions touched off the challenges, uncovering the tribal and territorial differences that have affected the nation for a considerable length of time. In spite of the fact that they shared a joint call for personal dignity and responsive government, the upsets over these three nations reflected economic grievances and social progression. Women of all-encompassing countries have taken the path to challenge the transgressions of their countries. This being particularly apparent during the anti-regime in Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya.

===Political participation===
"Syrian women have been active in the fight against Bashar al-Assad's regime from the start, dating back to the peaceful demonstrations in early 2011 in the southern city of Dara'a." &lt;ref name="foreignaffairs.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/syria/2013-03-06/how-syrian-women-are-fueling-resistance|title=How Syrian Women Are Fueling the Resistance|date=2013-03-07|website=Foreign Affairs|access-date=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other armed conflicts, like the Iraq war and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, women revolutionaries, both in and outside of Syria, have been involved in humanitarian efforts, providing food and medical supplies to displaced and injured citizens.&lt;ref name="foreignaffairs.com"/&gt;  Although women there have had the legal [[right to vote]] for years,&lt;ref name="Suffrage Timeline"&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson Lewis|first=Jone|title=International Woman Suffrage Timeline|url=http://womenshistory.about.com/od/suffrage/a/intl_timeline_2.htm|publisher=About.com: Women's History|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[authoritarian]] nature of the old authoritarian regimes meant that both women and men had very few political rights. [[Freedom House]], a [[non-governmental organization]] that promotes political freedom, stated that the Middle East and North Africa region "has historically been the least free region in the world".&lt;ref name="Freedom House"&gt;{{cite web|title=Middle East and North Africa|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/regions/middle-east-and-north-africa|publisher=Freedom House|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even given the general [[democracy deficit]], women had lower rates of political participation and representation in the legislatures.&lt;ref name="World Bank report"&gt;{{cite book|title=Opening Doors: Gender Equality and Development in the Middle East and North Africe|year=2013|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington D.C.|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/12552/751810PUB0EPI002060130Opening0doors.pdf?sequence=1#page=135 |page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pink hijab libya.jpg|thumb|Medical students in Libya raising breast cancer awareness]]

===Education===
The Arab Spring countries besides [[Yemen]] have largely closed the gender gap in education. The female [[literacy rate]] and female-to-male [[primary school]] enrollment rate have grown faster than in most other developing countries. In [[Tunisia]], [[Libya]], and [[Syria]] more women than men are enrolled in [[universities]]. Despite these high levels of educational achievement, female participation in the workforce remains low due to cultural norms.

===Health===
Countries in the Middle East and North Africa have also improved women's health outcomes, resulting in one of the world's lowest excess female mortality rates (how many fewer women would have died each year had they been living in a high-income country). The region has reduced its [[maternal mortality]] and [[infant mortality]] rates and increased female [[life expectancy]] from 55 to 73 years in the past four decades. [[Birth rates]] are higher than in the developed world, but have been dropping as women stay in school longer and delay marriage.&lt;ref name="World Bank report" /&gt;

===Role of Islam===
All of the states in the Arab world are [[List of Muslim-majority countries|majority-Muslim]] and [[Islam]] plays an important role in social and political life.&lt;ref name="Islam in Arab world"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Assl|first=Nima|title=The Role of Islam on the Arab Street|journal=Foreign Policy Journal|date=31 Jan 2011|url=http://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2011/01/31/the-role-of-islam-on-the-arab-street/|accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither the [[Quran]] nor the [[Hadith]] clearly defines the role of [[women in Islam]], so the impact of [[Islamic law|Sharia law]] on women's rights varies depending on a country's interpretation of it and how it connects to local traditions. Most countries in the Arab world place family matters under the jurisdiction of religious rather than civil courts.&lt;ref name="Battle for the Arab Spring"&gt;{{cite book|last=Noueihed|first=Lin|title=The Battle for the Arab Spring: Revolution, Counter-Revolution and the Making of a New Era|year=2012|publisher=Yale University Press|location=Great Britain|isbn=978-0300180862}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many countries have religiously-justified "guardianship laws" that give women the status of minors and make them dependent on spouses or male relatives.&lt;ref name="Ms. Magazine" /&gt; In Syria, marriage contracts are between the groom and the bride's father, and Syrian law does not recognize the concept of marital rape.&lt;ref name="Syria Capabilities Approach" /&gt; However, official recognition of [[Islam]] does not necessarily reduce women's rights. Certain interpretations of Sharia define fertility decisions as a private matter.&lt;ref name="Poverty in Muslim Countries"&gt;{{cite book|last=Iqbal|first=Munawar|title=Poverty in Muslim Countries and the New International Economic Order|year=2005|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=978-1403947208|author2=Habib Ahmed}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tunisia]]'s pre-Spring constitution named Islam as the state religion, but since the 1950s and 1960s its laws have been more secular and have supported some women's rights. [[Women in Tunisia]] have access to [[contraceptives]] and [[abortions]]; [[polygamy]] is illegal; there is a minimum marriage age; and women have many marital and divorce rights. However, daughters have fewer inheritance rights than sons and husbands take control of wives' property after marriage.&lt;ref name="Ms. Magazine" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Battle for the Arab Spring" /&gt;

===Pre-Spring regimes' policies===
Pre-Spring regimes enacted some pro-women's rights policies. The regimes strongly opposed Islamist movements and these policies stemmed from the desire to make society more [[secular]].&lt;ref name="Battle for the Arab Spring" /&gt; In [[Egypt]], [[Hosni Mubarak]] gave women the right to sue for [[divorce]] from their husbands and implemented a female-friendly quota system for elections. Observers credited his wife, [[Suzanne Mubarak]], with pushing the reforms.&lt;ref name="Better under Mubarak"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ramdani|first=Nabila|title=Egyptian women: 'They were doing better under Mubarak'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/04/egyptian-women-better-under-mubarak|accessdate=18 March 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Syria's [[Bashar al-Assad]] made it legal for news outlets to report on [[honor killings]], although judges could still reduce penalties if murder was justified that way.&lt;ref name="Syria Capabilities Approach" /&gt; Libyan ruler [[Muammar Gaddafi]] made it illegal for men to marry additional women without their current wives' consent.&lt;ref name="Ghaziri- Al-Arabiya"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ghaziri|first=Sophie|title=Arab Women must fight back|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/views/2013/02/23/Arab-Women-must-fight-back.html|accessdate=18 March 2013|newspaper=Al-Arabiya|date=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also discouraged women from wearing the [[hijab]], describing it as an "act of the devil" that forced women to "sit at home." This policy drew criticism for reducing women's freedom to choose their attire, but it also promoted secularism.&lt;ref name="Libya - Qaddafi book"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pargetter|first=Alison|title=Libya: The Rise and Fall of Qaddafi|year=2012|publisher=Yale University Press|location=Great Britain|isbn=978-0300139327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women in the protests==
Women helped spark the [[Arab Spring]] protests in several countries and actively participated in all of them. The demonstrations were based on the issues of freedom from tyranny and patriotism, not religious ones. [[Bahraini uprising (2011-present)|Bahrain's uprising]] has had some religious influence because many protesters are [[Shia Islam|Shi'ites]] angry about the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] monarchy's power and discrimination against Shi'ites. However, the protests promoted democracy and the end of discrimination rather than a religious agenda. Many women's rights activists hoped the revolutions would lead to more democracy and thereby more women's rights.&lt;ref name="Ms. Magazine" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Battle for the Arab Spring" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nebula article"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shihada|first=Isam|title=Women and the Arab Spring: Expectations and Concerns|journal=Nebula|date=Dec 2011|volume=8|issue=1|pages=283–295|url=http://www.nobleworld.biz/images/Shihada7.pdf|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they did not explicitly push for women's rights during any of the demonstrations.&lt;ref name="Ms. Magazine" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Arab Women and Social Media"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Newsom|first=Victoria|author2=Lara Lengel |title=Arab Women, Social Media, and the Arab Spring: Applying the framework of digital reflexivity to analyze gender and online activism|journal=Journal of International Women's Studies|date=Oct 2012|volume=13|issue=4|pages=31–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Starting the protests===
[[File:Flickr - Kodak Agfa - All ladies against Mubarak.jpg|thumb|Women in Tahrir Square protest the rule of Hosni Mubarak]]
Individual women had played key roles in starting the protests. On 17 December 2010, Tunisian policewoman Fedia Hamdi's confiscation of [[Mohamed Bouazizi]]'s street vending wares led him to set himself on fire in protest. This incident provoked protests in his hometown of [[Sidi Bouzid]] and eventually spread throughout the country to become the [[Tunisian Revolution]]. His family members and outside observers have hypothesized that Hamdi's gender compounded his embarrassment and frustration and drove him to the point of immolating himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Day|first=Elizabeth|title=The slap that sparked a revolution|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/15/arab-spring-tunisia-the-slap|accessdate=18 March 2013|newspaper=The Observer|date=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bouazizi's brother"&gt;{{cite news|title=Tunisia: 'I have lost my son, but I am proud of what he did'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/tunisia-i-have-lost-my-son-but-i-am-proud-of-what-he-did-2190331.html|accessdate=18 March 2013|newspaper=The Independent|date=21 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the protests spread, blogger [[Lina Ben Mhenni]] reported from the rural areas where the protests started, including covering the security forces' attack on protesters in [[Kasserine]]. Her work provided vital information to other Tunisian activists and brought the events there to the world's attention.&lt;ref name="Lina Ben Mhenni"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ryan|first=Yasmine|title=Tunisian blogger becomes Nobel Prize nominee|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2011/10/2011106222117687872.html|accessdate=18 March 2013|publisher=Al Jazeera English|date=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Egypt, activist [[Asmaa Mahfouz]] posted a video urging Egyptians to protest the regime of [[Hosni Mubarak]] in [[Tahrir Square]] on 25 January 2011, which is [[National Police Day]]. Her video went viral and the 25 January protests drew a large crowd, setting off the [[2011 Egyptian Revolution]].&lt;ref name="Asmaa Mahfouz"&gt;{{cite news|title=Revolutionary blogger Asma threatened|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/region/egypt/revolutionary-blogger-asma-threatened-1.757171|accessdate=18 March 2013|newspaper=Gulf News|date=5 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yemeni activist [[Tawakkol Karman]] organized protests and student rallies against the rule of [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]], which culminated in the [[2011 Yemeni revolution]] and the abdication of President Saleh. Yemenis referred to her as the "Mother of the Revolution" and she was awarded a [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 2011. Libyan human rights lawyer [[Salwa Bugaighis]] helped organize the [[2011 Libyan Civil War#Uprising and civil war|"Day of Rage" protests]] on 17 February 2011. Those protests drove the Libyan army out of [[Benghazi]], which marked a turning point in the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Revolution]].&lt;ref name="Salwa Bugaighis"&gt;{{cite web|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Salwa Bugaighis |work= |publisher=Vital Voices |year=2014 |url=http://www.vitalvoices.org/node/2680 |format= |doi= |accessdate=18 March 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6cM0qQLHq?url=http://www.vitalvoices.org/vital-voices-women/featured-voices/salwa-bugaighis |archivedate=17 October 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women were instrumental in every facet of the movement ascribing to a post-colonial feminism that rejected their powerlessness and gave them unique, thoughtful roles.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Melissa. "A Season Of Change: Egyptian Women's Organizing In The Arab Spring." Undercurrent 11.1 (2015): 38-45. Academic Search Complete. Web. 18 Nov. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; While women joined men with a similar cause, to fight for regime change, they ultimately were pursuing different goals unique to their gendered status in society. In some cases women had set backs and suffered from more oppression than pre-Arab Spring. But, more than anything they made the issues of women's rights vulnerable again to conservative values. While a democratic election is a right for all citizens, women had very little influence on the election and most often a leader was chosen that did not address their concerns or bring justice for women.&lt;ref&gt;Johansson-Nogués, Elisabeth.

===During the protests===
Thousands of women of all ages, classes, and religions participated in the protests in every country.&lt;ref name="Nebula article" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schattle-Egypt"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schattle|first=Hans|title=Globalization and Citizenship|year=2012|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc.|location=United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the police became unable to provide neighborhood security, women organized their own street patrols and guarded each other's tents. Women in Libya smuggled medicine and weapons and gathered intelligence for the rebels as the protests turned into [[civil war]].&lt;ref name="8 women to watch"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bohn|first=Lauren|title=Women and the Arab uprisings: 8 'agents of change' to follow|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/02/03/world/africa/women-arab-uprisings|accessdate=18 March 2013|publisher=CNN|date=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Egypt, a country notorious for high levels of [[sexual harassment]], male protesters treated the female protesters respectfully.&lt;ref name="Schattle-Egypt" /&gt; On the other hand, male protesters in Bahrain have formed human chains to block women from taking part, and in Yemen's Change Square a rope divided the men and women.&lt;ref name="Maryam al-Khawaja"&gt;{{cite news|last=Leigh|first=Karen|title=Exiled and 24: The Young Woman Fighting for Bahrain|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/06/exiled-and-24-the-young-woman-fighting-for-bahrain/241190/|accessdate=20 March 2013|work=The Atlantic|date=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brookings - Mabrouk"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mabrouk|first=Mirette|title=The Precarious Position of Women and Minorities in Arab|url=http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/up-front/posts/2012/06/01-egypt-mabrouk|publisher=The Brookings Institution|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women were subject to the same or worse treatment as the male protesters, including being "harassed, tortured, shot by snipers, and teargassed."&lt;ref name="Nebula article" /&gt; Women who were imprisoned were threatened with sexual violence or subject to virginity tests, and in Libya there were reports of mass rape committed by government mercenaries.&lt;ref name="Ms. Magazine" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nebula article" /&gt;

Coverage of women in the Arab spring came at a somewhat perplexing rate. While [[CNN]] and other major American news outlets covered muslim women more, they often gave them a passive role in the commentary of their coverage. Most of the women were also shown wearing hijabs and more traditional muslim clothing than before, pointing to a change in coverage by US media outlets. This, however, was not reflective of the realities of the Arab Spring.&lt;ref&gt;Dastgeer, Shugofa, and Peter J. Gade. "Visual Framing Of Muslim Women In The Arab Spring: Prominent, Active, And Visible." International Communication Gazette 78.5 (2016): 432-450. Academic Search Complete. Web. 18 Nov. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cyberactivism and social media==
New technologies, particularly [[social media]], enabled women to participate in the Arab Spring as organizers, journalists, and activists. Protesters used [[Facebook]] to mobilize supporters and organize events, and [[YouTube]] videos and [[Flickr]] photos gave the rest of the world visuals of the events of the Spring. [[Twitter]] functioned as a live newsfeed for other domestic and international activists as well as international media organizations. [[Mobile phones]], especially those with cameras and Internet access, served as a key tool for [[cyberactivism|cyber-activists]]. [[Blogs]] were another vital method for women to disseminate information. The numbers of female and male bloggers from Arab Spring countries were relatively even.&lt;ref name="Baker Inst Cyberactiv"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Radsch|first=Courtney|title=Unveiling the Revolutionaries: Cyberactivism and the Role of Women in the Arab Uprisings|journal=James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy|url=http://www.bakerinstitute.org/publications/ITP-pub-CyberactivismAndWomen-051712.pdf|accessdate=18 March 2013|date=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Internet access in the Arab World (2011).svg|thumb|left|Internet access in the Arab World (2011)]]
Since older males dominate most conventional media networks in the Arab Spring countries, cyber-activism gave women their own voice, both domestically and abroad.&lt;ref name="Arab Women and Social Media" /&gt; Younger women, generally the most excluded from traditional news outlets, thus benefited the most from the rise of social media. The new platforms also enabled protesters, both male and female, to get their messages out without the filter of [[state-run media]]. Social media helped women engage more people in the revolutions by reducing distinctions between social and political networks.&lt;ref name="Baker Inst Cyberactiv" /&gt;

While [[internet access]] remains relatively low in most of the Spring countries, the people whom online activities reached included key groups like power brokers, journalists, the [[intelligentsia]], and Western governments and media. Women split their messaging evenly between raising domestic awareness of their causes and sharing information about the Spring with other countries, while men tended to focus only on domestic awareness. The use of social media allowed for an increased awareness of the contributions of individual women in the demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Newsom|first1=Victoria|last2=Lengel|first2=Lara|title=Arab Women, Social Media, and the Arab Spring: Applying the framework of digital reflexivity to analyze gender and online activism - ProQuest|journal=Journal of International Women's Studies|date=Oct 2012|volume=13|issue=4|url=http://search.proquest.com/openview/86a40493973a5f1c38a1c5a5e35fcaaa/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=38976|accessdate=30 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women's updates ensured that the West's [[24-hour news cycle]] always had firsthand sources.&lt;ref name="Baker Inst Cyberactiv" /&gt; Bahraini activists [[Maryam Al-Khawaja]] and [[Zainab Al-Khawaja]], Egyptian journalist [[Mona Eltahawy]], and Libyan activist Danya Bashir were called the "Twitterati" (a [[portmanteau]] of ''Twitter'' and ''[[Intellectual|literati]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/Twitterati Definition of Twitterati in Oxford Dictionaries (US English) (US)]&lt;/ref&gt;) because their Twitter accounts of the revolutions were praised by international media outlets.&lt;ref name="Baker Inst Cyberactiv" /&gt;

Social media plays a key role for women in Tunisia while they face political issues. The internet has become an alternative way for women to defend their rights and also women's mobilization. Having access to the internet has helped women in Tunisia become more visible to the public, they have utilized social networks such as Facebook to promote women's movements. In this space they are able to express their issues and allow their actions to be known. Even though the country is heavy on internet filtering and press censorship, information and communications technology and social networks have help mobilize the push for political change. A prime example is the fall of Ben Ali's regime, even though the battle was won in the streets a big part of the Tunisian revolution was due to the support of information and communications technology. Tunisian women took part of the fall of Ben Ali's on January 14, 2011 by engaging in unions, marches, demonstrations, and their activism done on social networks. Another blog that became viral was by [[Lina Ben Mhenni]]. Her blog, ''A Tunisian Girl'' was also talked about on the blogs of many other women. With Mhenni's courage and bravery she was able to cover the battle in the western Tunisia. Mhenni was awarded in 2011 the Deutsche Welle International Blog Award and El Mundo's International Journalism.&lt;ref&gt;Olimat, Muhamad.

==After the protests==
Some women's rights activists fear that the new [[Islamist]]-led governments in Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya will curtail women's rights.&lt;ref name="Dalia Ziada on Egypt"&gt;{{cite news|last=Eckel|first=Mike|title=Egypt's leading female voice for change warns that revolution is backsliding|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Global-News/2012/1005/Egypt-s-leading-female-voice-for-change-warns-that-revolution-is-backsliding|accessdate=18 March 2013|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|date=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spring can't neglect women" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daily Star"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ennaji|first=Mona|title=Arab revolutions have made women worse off|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Opinion/Commentary/2013/Mar-06/208986-arab-revolutions-have-made-women-worse-off.ashx#axzz2MxNFc9xk|accessdate=19 March 2013|newspaper=The Daily Star|date=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, [[Women's rights in Saudi Arabia|women in Saudi Arabia]] were allowed to sit on the Saudi Shura council if they are "committed to Islamic [[Shariah]] disciplines without any violations" and must be "restrained by the religious veil." However, women in Saudi Arabia "are not allowed to travel, work, study abroad, marry, get divorced or gain admittance to a public hospital without permission from a male guardian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2013/01/12/saudi-women-shura.html Saudi women get seats on Shura council for 1st time]&lt;/ref&gt; Although Saudi Arabia "experienced almost no mayhem during this Arab Spring" (81), it was still ranked last in a study that was based on reports from women across the state based on issues such as freedom of person and economic rights.&lt;ref&gt;Sutherlin, John W. "Middle East Turmoil and Human Rights: How Will the 'New' Regimes Expand Civil Liberties." Perspectives on Global Development and Technology, vol. 11, no. 1, Jan. 2012, pp. 75–87., doi:10.1163/156914912x620743&lt;/ref&gt; However, women in Saudi Arabia now have the right to vote.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Johansson-Nogues, Elisabeth (October 2013). "Gendering the Arab Spring? Rights and (in)security of Tunisian, Egyptian and Libyan women". Security Dialogue. 44: 393–409 – via EBSCO.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the first year women were allowed to vote, multiple women were elected to different councils in the Saudi government, with King Abdullah adding 30 women to the Shura Council, which is a group of advisors. The male guardianship system is still an important part of Saudi society, even though Saudi Arabia has told the UN twice that it would abolish the system. One of Saudi Arabia's most senior clerics has said that repealing the system would threaten the existence of Saudi society and be a crime against the religion of Islam. Many activists hope that with the inclusion of more women in the workforce, Saudi society will be more open to this change.&lt;ref&gt;Stancati, Margherita (September 26, 2016). "Saudi Women Ask King to Bring an End to Male Guardianship". The Wall Street Journal. Retrieved October 18, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2017, the Saudi Arabian government announced that women would receive the right to drive, effective June 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com|title=Saudi Arabia Agrees to Let Women Drive|last=Hubbard|first=Ben|date=September 26, 2017|work=New York Times|access-date=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the General National Congress of Libya saw women obtain 33 of the 200 seats. However, there is controversy concerning whether or not women and men can mix in a public setting, which leads women parliamentarians and activists to believe that women will not be fairly represented in the new Constitution. Violence against women has also seen an increase, as the number of women who are being intimidated and threatened with sexual harassment, virginity tests, and incarceration is rising. These women are usually the women who are trying to be politically active, and who are also struggling to vote, but can't because they are being chased out of polling places by people who believe that men and women should not intermix. So far, the government does not appear to by trying to help stop this violence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Of the states that underwent change in the Middle East during the Arab Spring, Egypt was the first to hold democratic elections.&lt;ref&gt;Francois-Cerrah, Myriam, and Noreen Sadik. "Has the Arab Spring Failed?" New Internationalist, no. 466, Oct. 2013, pp. 30–32&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, Egypt had also seen some increase in the number of women who were in a seat of government, with 12 of the 498 seats in the Egyptian People's Assembly being occupied by women. This Assembly disbanded in 2013 and was replaced with the Constituent Assembly. The Constituent Assembly saw 6 seats out of the 100 go to women, all of whom walked out before the new constitution could be finished, which lead many Egyptian and United Nations legal experts to believe that the Constitution "did not prevent discrimination against women or safeguard the limited women's rights inherent in the PSL (Personal Status Law)".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Due to the number of military sexual harassment cases, a movement called No To Military Trials helped to bring justice against the generals who committed the crimes.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, Sally. "A Year Later, Still Dreaming of Change." ''Maclean's'', vol. 125, no. 7, 2 Feb. 2012, pp. 30-31&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of this movement, and laws passed that made sexual harassment a crime punishable with jail sentences and fines, the public sexual harassment surge is starting to slow down. Human rights groups are reporting that more women are reporting the crime and more men are being jailed for harassing. One organization reported that it had won more than 15 cases for sexual harassment between the years of 2013 and 2016. President Sissi has also helped combat the harassment, with seven men sentenced to life in prison, and two men sentenced to 20 years for their participation in assaults in Tahrir Square.&lt;ref&gt;Farouk, Menna A. "Egypt's Women Find Their Voice against Sexual Harassment." Deutsche Welle, 28 Dec. 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In Tunisia, the number of women who are participating in government is increasing, with women securing 61 of the 217 seats in the Tunisian Constituent Assembly in the 2012 elections. They have also gained many rights, such as the ability to obtain a divorce and gain custody of their children, and polygamy was also outlawed in the area. However, in Tunisia's new constitution, Elisabeth Johansson-Nogues notes that there is much controversy about the inclusion of gender specific amendments. In relation to the ambiguity of the language, there is no guarantee that women will be treated equally in society and the private sector. Because of this ambiguity, women are being publicly harassed for the way they dress, with very little help from the government in helping to stop it. In one case, "...a young woman was raped by police officers and, when she took the officers to trial, was in turn charged by the justice system for public indecency...". The government of Tunisia has yet to make a law protecting women against this type of violence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Arab Spring setback all economies involved in the conflict. While these Middle Eastern countries tried to reintegrate into the global economy, uncertainty about their political future shunned investors and did little to promote economic growth. With a large refugee crisis, unstable regional governments and currency, and a questionable future, many of these economies and countries will suffer compounding future effects.&lt;ref&gt;Karam, Fida, and Chahir Zaki. "How Did Wars Dampen Trade In The MENA Region?" Applied Economics 48.60 (2016): 5909-5930. Business Source Complete. Web. 18 Nov. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The Arab Spring could prove to be detrimental to women's rights for economic reasons as well. In a 2012 World Bank Report, they highlighted how greater access to economic resources can increase women's agency. As the economies of countries in the MENA region have suffered, slowing due to the Arab Spring, then so could the advancement of women's rights.&lt;ref&gt;Adnane, Souad. "Economic Freedom And Women's Emancipation In The MENA Region." Economic Affairs 35.3 (2015): 416-427. Business Source Complete. Web. 19 Nov. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
