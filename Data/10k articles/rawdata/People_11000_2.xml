The '''!Kora Wars''' was a period of raiding by the !Kora people and subsequent military action by the Boer authorities. The mid-nineteenth century experienced [[Human migration|migration]] as a result of the protracted frontier wars that forced the movement of certain indigenous groups further north of the [[Cape Colony]]. These included the [[Khoisan]], the [[Bastaards|Bastaard]] (a derogatory terms used to distinguish people of mixed [[Europe]]an and Khoi heritage) and the [[!Kora]], a people whom the colonial authorities considered more of a bandit community.{{cn|date=August 2018}} The !Kora were known to loot communities living around the lower to middle [[Orange River]].&lt;ref name= "Les12"&gt;{{harvnb|Leśniewski|2010|pp=12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The raids increased in volume and intensity during the mid eighteen hundreds. This forced the authorities to launch a series of expeditions aimed at countering the raids. The !Kora were finally crushed in 1879, but their intimate knowledge of the Gariep (Orange River) rendered them the most significant threat to settler colonies outside of the Bantu nations at the time.

==Origins==
Recent studies has come to consider the !Kora people as more of a loose group of communities. Initially they consisted of two groupings, the Little Korana and the Great Korana. Movement and divisions would come to separate them into even smaller groups. Some of these differences were caused by quarrels over grazing rights, livestock and water sources.&lt;ref name&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The !Ikora were a nomadic people, who were not bound to any one place for long stretches of time, even then they were considered to be semi-pastoral communities. Many of them shunned life in the [[Cape Colony]] because it meant living a life of servitude and hard labour. Instead, they looked northwards for a free life. Their ability to use guns and ride horses effectively were skills adopted under colonial life and these were skills that would prove beneficial to their cause. This made them highly adept at raiding livestock belonging to colonial settler communities.&lt;ref name= Ross562&gt;{{harvnb|Ross|1975|p=562}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life Along The Gariep==
Many groups within the !Kora community lived all along the expansive [[Orange River]]. They became highly knowledgeable of it and used its [[islands]] and riverbanks to their advantage. During this time the banks of the Orange were dense with foliage and reeds. On the river itself were numerous islands dotted about, which revealed themselves when water levels were low. The combination of tall reeds and the islands provided an advantage for the !Kora, because they were able to ambush their targets much easier.&lt;ref name=Couzens142&gt;{{harvnb|Couzens|2004|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Legend of Stuurman==
In the 1830’s the sparse settler communities along the Orange River region were able to counter some of the raids from the !Kora people, however a highly skilled and organised group of !Kora marauders began to emerge. A former slave known as Stuurman who belonged to a family in Griqualand led this group. Little is recorded on his ancestry. With a growing number of disgruntled! !Kora under his leadership, he gained notoriety 1832 when he and his followers stole livestock on cattle farms south of the Orange River. It is reported that they stole 5 wagons, 3000 sheep, 70 horses and 200 head of cattle. Over the next two years they proceeded to loot the border towns of [[Clanwilliam, Western Cape|Clanwilliam]], [[Beaufort West]] and [[Graaf Reinet]]. These were areas leading out of the Cape Colony; policing presence in these areas was scattered. Stuurman also launched attacks on the Tswana of Griqualand. Stuurman was however shot and killed by a white cattle farmer.&lt;ref name= Ross568&gt;{{harvnb|Ross|1975|pp=566-568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outlaws==
The 1860’s in Southern Africa brought about a serious drought, which had a profound impact on the movement of the [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] communities; the trekbroers who were beginning to concentrate on a life in the interior; and the Khoi and San communities that were being forced further north by the latter's migration. The communities around the Orange River were beginning to grow in their numbers, a reality that some !Kora leaders took full advantage of.&lt;ref name=Ross569&gt;{{harvnb|Ross|1975|p=569}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most notorious leaders of this time were Klaas Springbokke of the Springbokke group, Klaas Lukas of the Cat Korana group, with Cupido Pofadder occupying the more westerly region of the Orange River. These fractured groups put a lot of roving Trekboers and Bastaard communities under pressure, with their cattle being a prime target.&lt;ref name= Couzens143&gt;{{harvnb|Couzens|2004|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of !Kora were also rumoured to have secured smuggling networks further in the interior that could supply them with arms. Jan Kivido and Piet Rooi formed a partnership and were the most consistent raiders.&lt;ref name=Ross569/&gt;

==Conflict==
The first recorded significant incident between the !Kora people and the colonial government occurred in 1869, when a [[Griqua people|Griqua]] and Scottish trader were robbed along the southern bank of the Orange River. Piet Rooi, the leader of another nomadic !Kora group, was held responsible for the robbery, and as punishment was lashed and committed to three months hard labour. He was subsequently released on account of insufficient evidence against him. The treatment he received did not sit well with many of the !Ikora raiders, and this spurred them into increased levels of livestock pillaging that belonged to the settlers throughout the region.&lt;ref name= Ross551&gt;{{harvnb|Ross|1975|p=551}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A three hundred-man strong commando under Special Magistrate Maxmillian Jackson was deployed to try and deal with Rooi and Kivido’s activities, and although Kivido was killed in the insurgence, the attack was considered a failure as the [[commando]] struggled to navigate the islands due to limited understanding of the river's layout.&lt;ref name=Couzens143/&gt; As a result, the efforts to deter the !Kora from any more raids were increased. The authorities bribed two leaders of the most powerful groups, Lukas and Cupido Pofadder. They were given protection in exchange for information on the other marauding groups. Lukas orchestrated the recapture of Rooi and some of his cohorts, and handed them over to the Special Magistrate, and about 400 men were sentenced to [[Robben Island]].&lt;ref name= Couzens145&gt;{{harvnb|Couzens|2004|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Those who were able to evade capture retreated into the [[Kalahari Desert]]. Some among the captured !Kora were forced back into manual labour on white farms, while others succumbed to smallpox.&lt;ref name= Ross574&gt;{{harvnb|Ross|1975|p=574}}&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, the entire !Kora community was destroyed, and some of their prominent lead raiders spent decades behind bars. By the time they were released, they were too old and frail to resume their activities, and the !Kora people were too scattered to mobilise once more.

'''Mohammad Kazem Khorasani''' or '''Akhund-e Khorasani''' ({{lang-fa|محمد کاظم خراسانی}}, (1839-1911))&lt;ref name="Iranica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Hairi|first1=A.|last2=Murata|first2=S.|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/akund-molla-mohammad-kazem-korasani|title=AḴŪND ḴORĀSĀNĪ|date=1984|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Irannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; was [[Twelver]] [[Shi'a]] [[Marja'|Marja]], politician, philosopher, reformer. He's regarded as one of the most important Shia ''[[Mujtahid]]'' at the time.&lt;ref name="Meir"/&gt; He was a lecturer at Najaf seminary for years and significant number of students from "different regions of the Muslim world" used to participate his lectures. His most famous work is ''The Sufficiency'' ({{lang-ar|کفایه}}) where he gathered the jurispurdential ideas such as `continuity` and "presented them in a yet more rigorous fashion as a unified theory of jurisprudence."

He is known for using his position as a [[Marja'|marja]] for political use in the [[Persian Constitutional Revolution]] (1905-1911) where he was one of the main clerical supporters of the revolution. He believed that "constitutional form of government" would be the best possible choice in the absence of [[The Twelve Imams|Imam]] and regarded the "Persian revolution" a ''[[Jihad]]'' ("holy war") in which all Muslims had to participate.

He died "suddenly" and "mysteriously", when he aimed to leave Iraq for Iran in order against support constitutionalists' resistance to the [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran|Anglo-Russian invasion in 1911]].

==Early life and education==
Khorasani was born in [[Mashhad]] where he did his early educations. Then he left for [[Sabzevar]] at 20&lt;ref name="EI3"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Amir-Moezzi|first1= Mohammad Ali|url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-3/akhund-al-khurasani-COM_23052?s.num=131&amp;s.start=120|title=Ākhūnd al- Khurāsānī|date=2010|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Islam|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he got familiar with [[Islamic philosophy]] under [[Hadi Sabzavari|Molla Hadi Sabzavari]]. He continued Islamic philosophy under Molla Hosayn Khoʾi at the Sadr [[seminary]] in [[Tehran]],&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; the city where he learnt [[Logic]] and Hekmat. In 1861 he moved to [[Iraq]] and in [[Najaf]] worked on complementary studies under [[Grand Ayatollah Mirza Hassan Shirazi]], famous for his campaign against [[Tobacco Protest|the tobacco concession]].&lt;ref name="Prophet"/&gt; Also he studied about two years under [[Morteza Ansari]].&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; Both Morteza Ansari and Mirza Hassan Shirazi were ''[[Marja'|marja-e taqlid]]'' ("models for emulation") at the time.&lt;ref name="EI3"/&gt;

==Leader of Shia Muslims==
Shirazi's move [[Samarra]] provided a suitable opportunity for Akhund Khorasani to show his skill in ''[[Fiqh|feqh]]'' and ''osul'' in Najaf while being supported by Shirazi. After Shirazi's death he was recognized as a "a great religious leader." Some authors such as [[Ali Davani]] and Shahrestani regard him as the "sole ''marja-e taqlid'' immediately after Shirazi." He's also regarded as "an unquestionable master of [[Principles of Islamic jurisprudence|osul al-feqh]] before [[Mohammad Fazel Sarabiani]]’s death."&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;

He was a lecturer at Najaf seminary for years and significant number of students from "different regions of the Muslim world" used to participate his lectures.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; His most famous work is ''The Sufficiency'' ({{lang-ar|کفایه}}) which ranks "only after Morteza Ansari's treatice on commercial law" among the legal works written by mullahs in the last two centuries. In ''The Sufficiency'', Khorasani gathered the jurispurdential ideas such as `continuity` and "presented them in a yet more rigorous fashion as a unified theory of jurisprudence."  Khorasani was not a [[sayyed]] but "owed his position almost purely to his intellectual accomplishments."&lt;ref name="Prophet"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mottahedeh|first1=Roy|title=The Mantle of the Prophet|publisher=Oneworld Publications|isbn=9781780747385|pages=218–219|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YlsQBwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Mantle+of+the+Prophet&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjanJjJ7obQAhVISRoKHXL6DJsQ6AEIGzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Mantle%20of%20the%20Prophet&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 November 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Khorasani's leadership, the [[Usuli]] position became the dominant view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Acevedo|first1=Gabriel A.|last2=Shah|first2=Sarah|title=Sectarian Affiliation and Gender Traditionalism|journal=Sociology of Islam|date=25 August 2015|volume=3|issue=1-2|pages=1–29|doi=10.1163/22131418-00301001|url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/22131418-00301001|publisher=Brill}}{{subscription required|via=Brill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==
Although he warned the scholars for not involving in political activities as he believed that they had other responsibilities, he believed that scholars could act as "warning voices in society" and criticize the officials who were not doing their responsibilities correctly. He compared the role of scholars with "[[salt]] of the earth" in the sense that they prevent "decay of power", should fight against injustice and that they are against "[[autocratic]] attitudes"&lt;ref name="Religion"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hustinx|first1=Lesley|last2=Essen|first2=Johan Von|last3=Haers|first3=Jacques|last4=Mels|first4=Sara|title=Religion and Volunteering: Complex, contested and ambiguous relationships|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319045856|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FsokBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=akhund+khorasani&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwje3sXWmp3QAhXDBcAKHWbqB-QQ6AEIMDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=akhund%20khorasani&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 November 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political activities==
The first known Akhund Khorasani's anti-government political activities is related to "the unrest following the two Russian loans to [[Mozaffar-al-din Shah]]."&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;

Mohammad Kazem Khorasani was also one of the main clerical supporters of the [[Iranian Constitutional Revolution]]&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; and along with [[Mirza Hosayn Tehrani]] and [[Shaikh Abdallah Mazandarani]] he led people against what they called a "state tyranny"&lt;ref name="Kamali"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kamali|first1=Mohammad Hashim|last2=Ramadan|first2=Tariq|title=The Middle Path of Moderation in Islam: The Quranic Principle of Wasatiyyah|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780190226831|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HffzCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA109&amp;lpg=PA109&amp;dq=Mirza+Hosayn+Tehrani&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PRtXZUkIgK&amp;sig=8Fmq_0kOJidZE2LDy-2Lykx1nrQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjavv2v04rQAhXJShQKHTaTAzUQ6AEIODAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Mirza%20Hosayn%20Tehrani&amp;f=false|accessdate=2 November 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and issued fatwas and "sent telegrams to tribal chiefs, prominent national and political leaders, and heads of state in England, France, Germany, and Turkey." When [[Mohammad Ali Shah]] became king of Iran, Mohammad Kazem Khorasani sent him a "ten-point" instruction including points on ptotecting Islam, promoting domestic industries and modern science, stopping foreign powers' intervention in Iran "while retaining diplomatic relations", and establishing "justice and equality".&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;

He believed that "constitutional form of government" would be the best possible choice in the absence of [[The Twelve Imams|Imam]] and regarded the "Persian revolution" a ''[[Jihad]]'' ("holy war") in which all Muslims had to participate.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; When [[Sheikh Fazlollah Noori]] declared journalists non-Muslims for their support of the new Constitutional Assembly, Khorasani retaliated by announcing that Sheikh Fazlollah was himself no longer a Muslim, leading to Fazlollah's execution.&lt;ref name="Prophet"/&gt;{{rp|222}} The reaction to Noori's execution in Najaf harmed Khorasani and other constitution supporters and led to a rivalry with [[Mohammed Kazem Yazdi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Turban for the Crown|author=Said Amir Arjomand|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press US

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khorsani acted more intensively against Mohammad Ali Shah when he shelled the parliament building and executed many "constitutionalists".&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;

He apparently did not have ties with [[Oudh Bequest]] nor he favored British, despite the allegations. He were in an "equal opposition" to Russia and Britain, two powers at the time.&lt;ref name="EI2"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Hairi|first1=Abdul-Hadi|url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/khurasani-SIM_4337?s.num=17&amp;s.au=%22Hairi%2C+Abdul+Hadi%22|title=K̲h̲urāsānī|date=|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Islam|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works and pupils==
He authored many books hence titled "Innovator" (''al-mujaddid'') of ''Usul al-feqh''. Kifayat al-usul, Khorasani's most important book, is taught in advanced classes at the seminaries as the main text on the methodology of law. It has received "hundreds of commentaries".&lt;ref name="EI3"/&gt; The book suppressed ''Qvanin al-Osul'' by Qummi, one of seminary main texts taught at sotuh level.&lt;ref name="Meir"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Litvak|first1=Meir|title=Shi'i Scholars of Nineteenth-Century Iraq: The 'Ulama' of Najaf and Karbala'|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521892964|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3pYRFQQG5kEC&amp;pg=PA92&amp;dq=akhund+khorasani&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwje3sXWmp3QAhXDBcAKHWbqB-QQ6AEIKjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=akhund%20khorasani&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 November 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, he wrote one of the most important commentaries on [[Morteza Ansari|Shaykh Morteza al-Ansari]]'s ''Durar al-fawaid fi sharh al-Faraid'', also taught alongside  Kifayat al-usul.&lt;ref name="EI3"/&gt;

[[Ayatollah Mirza Hussein Naini]], [[Muhammad Hossein Qaravi|Ayatollah Muhammad Hossein Qaravi]], [[Agha Zia Addin Araghi]] were among his students.&lt;ref name="EI3"/&gt;

==Death==
He died "suddenly" and "mysteriously", when he aimed to leave Iraq for Iran in order against support constitutionalists' resistance to the [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran|Anglo-Russian invasion in 1911]].&lt;ref name="EI3"/&gt;

'''Alwyn Howard Gentry''' (6 January 1945 – 3 August 1993) was an American botanist and plant collector, who made major contributions to the understanding of the vegetation of tropical forests.

==Education==

Gentry was born on 6 January 1945 in [[Clay Center, Kansas]], and received his schooling at the [[List of high schools in Kansas#Clay County|Clay Center Community High School]], from which he graduated in 1963. He graduated from [[Kansas State University]] in 1967 with a B.A. in physical science and a B.S. in botany and zoology. He earned his master's degree in 1969 at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] as a student of botanist [[Hugh Iltis]], with a thesis on the genus ''[[Tabebuia]]'' ([[Bignoniaceae]]) of Central America, a subject which he continued to study at [[Washington University in St. Louis]], Missouri, from which he received his doctorate in 1972, with a Ph.D. thesis entitled ''An Eco-evolutionary Study of the Bignoniaceae of South Central America''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=James S|first2=Theodore M |last2=Barkley |first3=Hugh H |last3=Iltis |first4=Walter H |last4=Lewis |first5=Enrique |last5=Forero |first6=Mark |last6=Plotkin |first7=Oliver |last7=Phillips |first8=Ricardo |last8=Rueda |first9=Peter H |last9=Raven|year=1996|title=Alwyn Howard Gentry, 1945-1993: A Tribute|journal=Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden|volume=83|issue=4|pages=433–60|jstor=2399988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Gentry spent his entire working career at the [[Missouri Botanical Garden]], starting as an assistant curator in October 1972. In 1974, he made his first visit to Peru, a country that became the major focus of much of his subsequent work; he made his second trip there in 1976 and by the time of his death had visited the country 33 times. He also maintained his interest in the Bignoniaceae: he contributed treatments of the family to nine volumes, including the ''Flora of Panama'', and had a further five in press when he died.

One of Gentry's major innovations was the use of transect samples as a tool for assessing the composition and structure of tropical forests, known as the [[Gentry Forest Transect]]. His method, allied to his encyclopedic knowledge of tropical plants, allowed him to sample a site in a matter of days, and over the course of his career he amassed data from over 200 such transects worldwide.

Alwyn Gentry was prolific both as an author and as a plant collector: he published over 200 works and had many more on hand at the time of his death; and he collected over 80,000 plant specimens, hundreds of which have proved to be species new to science. Because many of the plants that he encountered during his transect sampling were not flowering, Gentry developed the ability to identify species from vegetative specimens, not just from flowers and fruits, an ability that led to the publication of his ''Field Guide to the Families and Genera of Woody Plants of Northwest South America'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2996602|title=Reviewed Work: ''A Field Guide to the Families of Woody Plants of Northwest South America'' by A. H. Gentry|author=Gonzalez, Favio|journal=Journal of the Torrey Botanical Society|volume=124|issue=1|year=1997|pages=98–100|doi=10.2307/2996602}}&lt;/ref&gt; completed just months before his death.

In 1990, [[Conservation International]] established a Rapid Assessment Program (RAP) to undertake quick assessments of areas deemed to be significant for conservation. Gentry's transect method was well suited to such work and he became increasingly involved as a member of the RAP team.

==Death==
On 3 August 1993, Alwyn Gentry was on a RAP mission in western Ecuador, when the light aircraft in which he was travelling crashed into a mountain ridge near [[Guayaquil]]. Four people&amp;mdash;the pilot, Gentry, American ornithologist [[Theodore A. Parker III]], and Ecuadorian ecologist Eduardo Aspiazu&amp;mdash;died in the crash; three other researchers survived. Parker and Gentry are memorialized in the annual Parker/Gentry Award for Conservation Biology of the [[Field Museum of Natural History]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fieldmuseum.org/research_collections/ecp/ecp_sites/Parker_Gentry/award.htm|title=Parker/Gentry Award for Conservation Biology|year=2007|publisher=The Field Museum|accessdate=27 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317192904/http://www.fieldmuseum.org/research_collections/ecp/ecp_sites/Parker_Gentry/award.htm|archive-date=2009-03-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several plant species have been named after Gentry, including: ''[[Acidocroton gentryi]], [[Citharexylum gentryi]], [[Crossothamnus gentryi]], [[Eleutherodactylus gentryi]], [[Hedyosmum gentryi]], [[Metalepis gentryi]], [[Palicourea gentryi]], [[Phyllanthus gentryi]], [[Sobralia gentryi]]'' and ''[[Zamia gentryi]]'', as well as a bird, ''[[Herpsilochmus gentryi]]''. In several instances, Gentry had been involved in the collection of the [[type specimen]]s of these plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Loran Whitelock|Whitelock]]|first=Loran M|title=The Cycads|year=2002|publisher=[[Timber Press]]|location=Portland, OR|isbn=0-88192-522-5|pages=304–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Téllez-Valdés|first=Oswaldo|year=1996|title=Two new species of Dioscorea (Dioscoreaceae) from Peru|journal=Brittonia|publisher=[[New York Botanical Garden]]|volume=48|issue=1|pages=100–103|doi=10.2307/2807670}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=D'Arcy|first=W G|author2=Ronald L Liesner|year=1981|title=Hedyosmum (Chloranthaceae) in Panama|journal=Systematic Botany|publisher=[[American Society of Plant Taxonomists]]|volume=6|issue=1|pages=74–86|jstor=2418637|doi=10.2307/2418637}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''animalier''' is an [[artist]], mainly from the 19th century, who specializes in, or is known for, skill in the realistic portrayal of [[animal]]s. "[[Animal painter]]" is the more general term for earlier artists.  Although the work may be in any genre or format, the term is most often applied to [[sculptors]] and [[painters]].

'''''Animalier''''' as a collective plural noun, or '''''animalier bronzes''''', is also a term in [[antiques]] for small-scale sculptures of animals, of which large numbers were produced, often mass-produced, primarily in 19th-century [[France]] and to a lesser extent elsewhere in continental Europe.

Although many earlier examples can be found, animalier sculpture became more popular, and reputable, in early 19th-century [[Paris]] with the works of [[Antoine-Louis Barye]] (1795–1875), for whom the term was coined, derisively, by critics in 1831,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/animalier-sculpture-1 |title="Animalier sculpture." '&amp;#39;The Concise Grove Dictionary of Art'&amp;#39;. Oxford University Press, Inc., 2002.

Metz and His Collection |publisher=Indiana.edu |date= |access-date=23 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of [[Émile-Coriolan Guillemin]]. By the mid-century, a taste for animal subjects was very widespread among all sections of the middle-classes.

In [[French language|French]], a ''parc animalier'' is a [[zoo]].

== Controversy ==
On March 4, 2018, during tea in the 1st Test between [[Australian cricket team in South Africa in 2017–18|Australia and South Africa]] in Durban, Warner’s husband was involved in a heated exchange with South African Wicket-Keeper [[Quinton de Kock]] regarding vulgar comments about her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/22648767/david-warner-involved-heated-exchange-quinton-de-kock|title=Warner involved in heated exchange with de Kock|last=|first=|date=|work=ESPNcricinfo|access-date=27 March 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Warner fired back at De Kock and was forcibly restrained by teammates [[Usman Khawaja]] and [[Steve Smith (cricketer)|Steve Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/sport/cricket/david-warner-shown-in-fiery-confrontation-with-quinton-de-kock-20180305-p4z2t9.html|title=David Warner shown in fiery confrontation with Quinton de Kock|last=Barrett|first=Chris|date=2018-03-05|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/22673885/david-warner-contest-charge-quinton-de-kock-does|title=David Warner doesn't contest charge, but de Kock does|last=|first=|date=|work=ESPNcricinfo|access-date=27 March 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cricket/2018/03/05/icc-investigate-ugly-off-field-row-david-warner-quinton-de-kock/|title=ICC to investigate ugly off-field row between David Warner and Quinton de Kock|last=Hoult|first=Nick|date=2018-03-05|work=The Telegraph|access-date=27 March 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christon Michael Gray''' (born July 18, 1986) is an [[United States|American]] [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]] [[Singing|singer]] and [[Rapping|rapper]] born and raised in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. He is a [[Christian]] and calls his music ‘about being human’. It’s this approach that has allowed him to be successful as a mainstream artist.

==Background==
Gray was born Christon Michael Gray on July 18, 1986, in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. His parents, Arthur Gray (a former choir leader), and his mother Leigh Ann (a trained [[soprano]]) have two other children; Christon’s older brother, [[Taelor Gray]], who is also a rapper and [[pastor]], and his younger sister Aubrey, who is currently a college student. He resides in Columbus and has a daughter named Mya Blue.

==Music career==

=== 2006 - 11: Elevationists &amp; EWEWM ===

In 2006, Gray was a part of The Elevationists with his brother, Taelor and childhood friend BJ (James Hazley). After a few years together, they disbanded the group.

In 2011, Gray, with the help of writing partner and music director Marlo Scott, released an album entitled ''[[Even With Evil With Me]].'' The independent release spawned the timeless track ‘Isle of You’, which quickly led to record label interest.  Before the year was out, he was signed to Collision Records.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newreleasetoday.com/albumdetail.php?album_id=13892|title=School Of Roses by Christon Gray {{!}} CD Reviews And Information {{!}} NewReleaseToday|website=www.newreleasetoday.com|access-date=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2012 – 14: Collision Records &amp; School of Roses ===
In 2012, he began working on his retail and label debut for Collision, but as it morphed, he decided to release it as a free mixtape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rapzilla.com/rz/music/freemp3s/5063-christon-gray-body-art|title=Christon Gray 'Body Art'|last=Horton|first=Chad|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Body Art''  was a hit among Gray's fans and featured the label's roster as well as other artists and producers from the [[Christian hip hop|CHH]] genre. It caught many fans off guard because it was more of a rap album than EWEWM, which was the album’s intention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wadeoradio.com/christon-gray-body-art-putting-the-art-back-in-artist/|title=Christon Gray "Body Art" – Putting the 'Art' back in Artist|date=2012-09-28|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in 2013, the label released the collective album [[W.L.A.K. (album)|''We Live As Kings (W.L.A.K.)'''''.''']] As a member of the four-man group, Christon was featured on the majority of the tracks. The album went on to top the [[Billboard charts|Billboard]] Gospel chart and crack the top 10 on the Rap and Christian charts. It also contained the cut '[[The Glory Album|King In Me]]' which was used as the theme song to [[American Idol]]’s [[Super Bowl]] commercial in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Christon Gray|title=American Idol Superbowl Ad (2014) ft. 'King In Me' by Swoope and Christon Gray|date=2015-03-30|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxbDZ8Irfo8|accessdate=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 25, 2014, Gray released his 2nd studio album entitled ''[[School of Roses]]''. It included fan favorites ‘[[School of Roses|Vanish]]’ (feat. [[Swoope]]) and ‘[[School of Roses|Wanna]]’ (feat. [[JGivens]]) which peaked at #15 on the [[Billboard charts|Billboard]] Live Trending chart. This was more of an R&amp;B album than ''Body Art'', and it debuted at the top of the overall charts on [[iTunes]], and hit #44 on the [[Billboard Top 200]] and #5 on Top R&amp;B Albums.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.christongray.com/promo/|title=PROMO|website=CHRISTON GRAY|access-date=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2015 - January 2017: FYS/RCA &amp; The Glory Album ===
In early 2015, Gray began releasing music on his own, prompting fans to question whether or not he was still a part of Collision and [[W.L.A.K.]] The first track [[The Glory Album|'Open Door (See You Later)']] was posted on his [[SoundCloud|Soundcloud]] page in March of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wadeoradio.com/new-music-christon-gray-open-door-see-you-later/|title=New Music: Christon Gray - "Open Door (See You Later)"|date=2015-03-20|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still not addressing his status, one week later he posted the beautiful piano led love ballad, [[The Glory Album|'Afraid With You']]. Lastly, he posted ‘Light On’ featuring [[B.Reith]] the following week. On April 28, 2015, after confirming he was leaving Collision in an interview with Wade-O&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wadeoradio.com/christon-gray-talks-leaving-collision-the-demos-drops-new-freestyle/|title=Christon Gray Talks Leaving Collision &amp; 'The Demos' + Drops New Freestyle|date=2015-04-09|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp; [[Rapzilla]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rapzilla.com/rz/news/38-backstage/10579-christon-gray-pens-open-letter-about-collision-records-departure-announces-ep|title=Christon Gray announces departure from Collision Records, new EP|last=Daniels|first=David|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gray released an EP called ''The Demos'' to be streamed exclusively on the Christian music-streaming app, "The Overflow&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theoverflow.com/blog/christon-gray-to-release-exclusive-ep-on-theoverflow/|title=Christon Gray to release EXCLUSIVE EP on TheOverflow! - TheOverflow.com: Streaming Christian Music|date=2015-04-07|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;".  The album went to be the most streamed project on the entire service for 2015, with all 5 tracks occupying spots #1 - #5 the week of its release.

It became clear that he was using these songs to get himself a new record deal, and in June 2015, he revealed that he had signed with [[Kirk Franklin|Kirk Franklin's]] label, Fo Yo Soul Recordings/[[RCA Records|RCA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://christongray.com/|title=BLOG|website=CHRISTON GRAY|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirk himself made the announcement via video screen at ''Alive Fest'' in Ohio on June 20, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gospelpundit.com/2015/06/kirk-franklin-signs-singerrapper-christon-gray-to-fo-yo-soul-recordings/|title=Kirk Franklin Signs Singer/Rapper Christon Gray to Fo Yo Soul Recordings|date=2015-06-23|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently removed ''The Demos'' to work on his third retail album and label debut.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://christongray.com/|title=BLOG|website=CHRISTON GRAY|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 18, 2015, [[Rapzilla|Rapzilla.com]] released an interview via email with Gray in which he said his debut with Fo Yo Soul had been completed and was being scheduled for release during "the colder part of 2016".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rapzilla.com/rz/features/interviews/12000-christon-gray-talks-upcoming-album-kirk-franklin-and-says-he-has-a-song-called-50-shades|title=Christon Gray talks upcoming album, Kirk Franklin and says he has a song called '50 Shades'|last=Daniels|first=David|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A couple weeks later, on December 2, 2015, Gray released a freestyle video that included the name and release date of his next project, ''[[The Glory Album]]''. Gray's debut album with Fo Yo Soul/RCA was set to be released on March 11, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rapzilla.com/rz/news/38-backstage/12079-christon-gray-reveals-release-date-of-new-album-alongside-freestyle|title=Christon Gray reveals release date of new album alongside freestyle|last=Daniels|first=David|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two weeks after that, he debuted the first new track off the album on [[Vevo]] called ‘[[The Glory Album|Connor McDees]]’ featuring [[Brooklyn]] emcee, [[Skyzoo]] and his brother Taelor.

[[The Glory Album]] was released on March 11, 2016.  The LP went on to again claim the #5 position on the [[Billboard R&amp;B charts]], while also hitting #6 on the Christian chart.

Gray was chosen as the first ever Youth Ambassador&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://rapzilla.com/rz/news/38-backstage/13666-christon-gray-was-first-ever-youth-ambassador-at-the-bet-awards|title=Christon Gray was First Ever Youth Ambassador at the BET Awards|last=Sarachik|first=Justin|work=Rapzilla.com|access-date=2017-04-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[BET Awards]] in June 2016.

After just one album with the label, Gray let fans know that he had officially left RCA in January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.christongray.com/|title=HOME|website=CHRISTON GRAY|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not elaborate on the reasons, but said when the time was right he would speak about it. According to the post, it was a business decision and he wishes all parties involved well.

=== 2017 - No Hesitation and Return to FYS/RCA Records ===
In March 2017, Gray, along with Chris Shaban started their own Podcast entitled 'Chris' Podcast'. The first two episodes included guests [[Ty Montgomery]], [[Chris Broussard]] and [[Darren M. Haynes|Darren Haynes]]. Gray mentioned that this was a pilot program and that they were looking to bring it back sometime in 2019.

On July 28, Gray dropped a single called 'No Hesitation' independently. This was his first release since leaving Fo Yo Soul/RCA Records. In an interview with Wade-O, Gray said, "You know the inspiration for the song came from me watching the BET Awards, and I saw 'Crae's speech, and I know he caught some flack for that... I talked to Lecrae the other day, and I told him, I come from that world... I grew up listening to them and without them, you (Wade) would not be having an interview with me... so I told him (Lecrae), yo, I didn't expect you to go back and apologize, so I did it for you.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=The Wade-O Radio Video Channel|title=Christon Gray on Story Behind "No Hesitation", Leaving RCA, and More|date=2017-08-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRy3B3VmH6E|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;" The song would become another hit for Gray, and he went on to perform it live at the 2018 [[Stellar Awards]].

A week later, on August 4th, he released 'Shoulda Known', which included a sample of his song, '[[School of Roses|Burning House (Roses 102)]]' off the School of Roses album&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BXi0W19hyaG/?taken-by=christongray|title=Christon Gray on Instagram: “My 2nd single 'Shoulda Known' featuring my brother @pray4jgivens is now available to stream worldwide. I've heard from a lot of School of…”|website=Instagram|language=en|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It featured long-time collaborator and friend, [[JGivens]].

On Sunday November 5, Christon Gray was announced as the new Worship Leader at Christ's Church in [[Mason, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fccmasoncampus%2Fvideos%2F2111942965486135%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=560" width="560" height="315" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true" allowFullScreen="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the year, an agreement had been reached for him to rejoin Fo Yo Soul and the new staff at [[RCA Inspiration]] in Nashville. It would not become public until later on in 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rapzilla.com/2018-10-christon-gray-rapzilla-chris-chicago-ep-115/|title=Christon Gray on Rapzilla.com LIVE with Chris Chicago - Ep. 115|website=rapzilla.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== 2018 - Clear The Heir ===
By the end of 2017 and leading into 2018, Gray let fans know that he was back writing, but did not elaborate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BcnRz4dh58O/?taken-by=christongray|title=Christon Gray on Instagram: “WRITING // 2018”|website=Instagram|language=en|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; There weren't anymore indications until a post on Instagram in February with Chris Shaban and Ty Montgomery, taken from a writing session in [[Cambridge, Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BfUDkEXBEhF/?taken-by=christongray|title=Christon Gray on Instagram: “All Amour”|website=Instagram|language=en|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;He would later go on to tell that 4 songs were already written by this point, with two making the album, 'Seekrets' and 'Together Forever'.

In March, there came a string of posts from the studio that included MD and producer Marlo Scott, Producer GiAngelo Power, Pastor Trevor DeVage, Montgomery and Shaban. Gray said in a post on Twitter, "...there was a week in March 2018 when everything started to come together. That week we did 'Grow Up', 'You &amp; I (Sampson's Lament)' and brushed up a few other songs that made the cut."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/christongray/status/1048606296893808646|title=Christon Gray on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-10-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those other songs were 'Seekrets', 'Together Forever' and the instrumental to 'Clear The Heir'.

In April at the Stellar Awards, rumors started swirling that Christon had re-signed with Fo Yo Soul/RCA Records, and while it had happened months before, it was a post with Kirk Franklin that said "Welcome home" that started the buzz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BhhiF08l83q/?taken-by=christongray|title=Christon Gray on Instagram: “Welcome home”|website=Instagram|language=en|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; One more studio picture that month and Gray took some time off of his social media and no further updates came until late in the summer.

On August 2, a post from famed Canadian studio [[Metalworks Studios|Metalworks]] that read "October 19" and had no sound, but a studio full of his collaborators started his promotion run for the album.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bl_-DvdgWoM/?taken-by=christongray|title=Christon Gray on Instagram: “October 19”|website=Instagram|language=en|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;It would come to light later on that October 19 would be the release date for the album.

On August 24, he dropped the first single 'Together Forever' with credit going to Fo Yo Soul/Essential Sound/Sony. The track contained a portion of his September 2016 interview on Sirius XM's 'Sway In The Morning' where he discussed divorce.

On September 14, he released the albums second single 'Time Out', produced by Toronto's GiAngelo Power. That instrumental had come from a writing session with JGivens in November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/christongray/status/1048612615449186304|title=Christon Gray on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-10-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 21, RCA released the music video for 'Time Out' and it featured a host of Christian athletes including Ty Montgomery, [[Mike Conley Jr.|Mike Conley]], [[A.J. Styles]], [[Steven Souza Jr.|Steven Sousa Jr]]., [[Andre Ward]], [[Michelle Plouffe]] and more. The songs co-writer and video director, Chris Shaban said, "Growing up as a Christian kid (in Toronto), I was always inspired by athletes who excelled at a high level and love Jesus, so we decided we'd like to try and motivate the next generation the same way." It was accompanied by the #TimeOutChallenge that asked fans to rap over the songs instrumental with the winner receiving a signed pair of [[Air Jordan|Jordan Brand]] shoes from Conley and a signed [[Green Bay Packers]] jersey from Montgomery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BohDzU_B6S9/?taken-by=christongray|title=Christon Gray on Instagram: “Listen to my boy @mac11 aka ‘Captain Clutch’ and join the #TimeOutChallenge right now. His signed Jordan’s and @ty_kingdomcitizen signed…”|website=Instagram|language=en|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 12, Gray released the third single from the album, 'Grow Up'. It was immediately added to numerous playlists on [[Spotify]], including 'New Music Friday', 'New Music Friday Christian', 'Blessings', and 'The Flow'.

==Early life and education==
Originally from [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], Wilson was [[student body president]] at [[Cabot High School]] in [[Cabot, Arkansas]]; he graduated in 2006.

Wilson graduated from the [[University of Central Arkansas]] (UCA) with a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[English studies|English]] in 2010, where he had a [[scholarship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304753504579284593005519808|title=Cody Wilson Rattled Lawmakers With Plastic Gun, Now on to Bitcoin Transactions   - WSJ|author=Danny Yadron|date=1 January 2014|work=WSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at UCA, Wilson was a member of [[Sigma Phi Epsilon]] [[fraternity]] and was elected president of UCA's [[Student Government Association]]. He traveled to China with UCA's study-abroad program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cqrcengage.com/mnmajority/app/document/1369157;jsessionid=0qt57PTm6rKNKpYAakyb5XPV.undefined |title=Document: Cody Wilson: troll, genius, patriot, provocateur, anarchist, attention whore, gun nut or Second Amendment champion? |publisher=Cqrcengage.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Defense Distributed===
In 2012, Wilson and associates at Defense Distributed initiated the ''Wiki Weapon Project'' to raise funds for designing and releasing the files for a 3D printable gun.&lt;ref name="Forbes1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2012/08/23/wiki-weapon-project-aims-to-create-a-gun-anyone-can-3d-print-at-home|first=Andy|last=Greenberg|title='Wiki Weapon Project' Aims To Create A Gun Anyone Can 3D-Print At Home|publisher=[[Forbes]]|date=August 23, 2012|accessdate=January 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson is, to date, the only spokesperson on behalf of the organization, of which he describes himself as "co-founder" and "director".&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/nov/25/3d-wiki-weapons-guns|first=Alexander|last=Hotz|title=3D 'Wiki Weapon' guns could go into testing by end of year, maker claims|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=November 25, 2012|accessdate=January 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Learning of his organization's plans, manufacturer [[Stratasys]] threatened legal action and demanded the return of a 3D printer it had leased to Wilson.&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt; On September 26, 2012, before the printer was assembled for use, Wilson received an email from Stratasys suggesting he was using the printer "for illegal purposes".&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/10/3d-gun-blocked|title=3-D Printer Company Seizes Machine From Desktop Gunsmith|first=Robert|last=Beckhusen|publisher=[[Wired News]]|date=October 1, 2012|accessdate=October 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stratasys immediately cancelled its lease with Wilson and sent a team to confiscate the printer the next day.&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NBC1&gt;{{cite news|last=Coldewey|first=Devin|title=3-D printed gun project derailed by legal woes|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/futureoftech/3-d-printed-gun-project-derailed-legal-woes-6213570|accessdate=December 15, 2012|newspaper=NBC News|date=October 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While visiting the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms|ATF]] enforcement office in Austin to inquire about legalities related to his project, Wilson was subsequently interrogated by the officers there.&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt; Six months later, he was issued a [[Federal Firearms License]] (FFL) to manufacture and deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Farivar|first=Cyrus|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/03/3d-printed-gunmaker-now-has-federal-firearms-license-to-manufacture-deal-guns|title=3D-printed gun maker now has federal firearms license to manufacture, deal guns|publisher=[[Ars Technica]]|date=March 17, 2013|accessdate=May 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, Wilson successfully test-fired a pistol, called "the [[Liberator (gun)|Liberator]]", reportedly made by a Stratasys Dimension series 3D printer bought on [[eBay]].&lt;ref name="Guardian-May2013"/&gt; After test firing, Wilson released the blueprints of the gun's design online through a Defense Distributed website named DEFCAD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Steven Rex|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/plastic-gun-maker-rebukes-nanny-state-article-1.1342166|title=Man who used 3-D printer to create gun hopes efforts can 'destroy the spirit of gun control itself'|newspaper=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|date=May 13, 2013|accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The State Department Office of Defense Trade Controls Compliance then demanded that he remove the files, threatening prosecution for violations of the [[International Traffic in Arms Regulations]] (ITAR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/05/09/state-department-demands-takedown-of-3d-printable-gun-for-possible-export-control-violation/|title=State Department Demands Takedown Of 3D-Printable Gun Files For Possible Export Control Violations|author=Andy Greenberg|date=9 May 2013|work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 6, 2015, Defense Distributed and the gun rights group the [[Second Amendment Foundation]] filed a lawsuit against the State Department claiming a violation of their first amendment rights to free speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/05/3-d-printed-gun-lawsuit-starts-war-arms-control-free-speech/|title=3-D Printed Gun Lawsuit Starts the War Between Arms Control and Free Speech|date=6 May 2015|work=WIRED}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 10, 2018, it was reported that the company won this lawsuit and would begin again its work at [[DEFCAD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Greenberg |first1=Andy |title=A Landmark Legal Shift Opens Pandora’s Box for DIY Guns |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=2018-07-10 |url=https://www.wired.com/story/a-landmark-legal-shift-opens-pandoras-box-for-diy-guns/ |issn=1059-1028 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of being charged with sexual assault, Wilson resigned from and ended all ties with [[Defense Distributed]] on September 21, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/09/cody-wilson-resigns-from-defense-distributed-which-is-now-under-new-leadership/|title=Defense Distributed’s new era—Cody Wilson resigns, former arts professional steps in|publisher=[[Ars Technica]]|date=25 September 2018|accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dark Wallet===
In 2013, Wilson, along with [[Amir Taaki]], began work on a [[Bitcoin]] [[cryptocurrency wallet]] called 'Dark Wallet',&lt;ref name="New Yorker: Dark Wallet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbesbtc1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/10/31/darkwallet-aims-to-be-the-anarchists-bitcoin-app-of-choice/|last=Greenberg|first=Andy|title=Dark Wallet Aims To Be The Anarchist's Bitcoin App Of Choice|publisher=[[Forbes]]|date=October 31, 2013|accessdate=December 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTbtc&gt;{{cite news|last=Feuer|first=Alan|title=The Bitcoin Ideology|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/15/sunday-review/the-bitcoin-ideology.html?_r=0|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 14, 2013|accessdate=December 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a project by which he plans to help [[Anonymity|anonymize]] financial transactions. He appeared in support of the 'Dark Wallet' project at the [[South by Southwest|SXSW festival]] in [[Austin, Texas]] in 2014, speaking to publications such as [[Reason (magazine)#Reason TV|ReasonTV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5fhBBipU3w|title=Cody Wilson: Happiness is a 3-D Printed Gun|publisher=[[Reason (magazine)#Reason TV|ReasonTV]] - [[Youtube.com]]|date=April 18, 2014|accessdate=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bitcoin Foundation===
On [[United States elections, 2014|U.S. election day]], November 4, 2014, Wilson announced in an interview that he would stand for election to a seat on the Board of Directors of the [[Bitcoin Foundation]], with "the sole purpose of destroying the Foundation." And Wilson stated: "I will run on a platform of the complete dissolution of the Bitcoin Foundation and will begin and end every single one of my public statements with that message."&lt;ref name="Upstart"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://upstart.bizjournals.com/entrepreneurs/hot-shots/2014/11/04/cody-wilson-to-run-for-bitcoin-foundation-board.html?page=all|last=del Castillo|first=Michael|title=Exclusive: Cody Wilson to run for Bitcoin Foundation board, plans its destruction|publisher=[[American City Business Journals]]|date=November 4, 2014|accessdate=November 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hatreon===
In 2017, Wilson launched [[Hatreon]], a crowdfunding site that provided crowdfunding and payment services for groups and individuals who were banned from crowdfunders such as Kickstarter, [[Patreon]], [[PayPal]], and [[Stripe (company)|Stripe]].&lt;ref name="Popescu"/&gt; It was notable for featuring the controversial [[alt-right]] personalities [[Andrew Anglin]] and [[Richard B. Spencer|Richard Spencer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fox|first1=Megan|title=Alt-Tech Bad Boy Cody Wilson Explains Hatreon, an Alternative to Online Censorship|url=https://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/08/18/hatreon-alt-tech-bad-boy-cody-wilsons-alternative-to-online-censorship/|website=PJ Media|accessdate=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hicks|first1=William|title=MEET HATREON, THE NEW FAVORITE WEBSITE OF THE ALT-RIGHT|url=http://www.newsweek.com/hatreon-alt-right-richard-spencer-andrew-anglin-white-nationalism-white-644546|website=Newsweek|accessdate=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite news|title='Hatreon' is The new Crowdfunding platform For The alt-right|url=https://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/nation/2017/08/05/hatreon-new-crowdfunding-platform-alt-right/104313784/|accessdate=18 December 2017|agency=usa today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Popescu"/&gt; 
Wilson said that Hatreon clients included "right-wing women, people of color, and transgender people", but according to Adam Popescu of [[Bloomberg News]], "most" of the donations went to "white supremacists."&lt;ref name="Popescu"/&gt; According to Hannah Shearer, staff attorney at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, Hatreon users were inciting violence contrary to Hatreon’s terms of service, which forbid illegal activity.&lt;ref name="Popescu"/&gt;

The site claimed to have received about $25,000 a month in donations, an amount that was "doubling from month to month." Hatreon took a 5-percent cut of donations.&lt;ref name="Popescu"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Popescu |first1=Adam |title=This Crowdfunding Site Runs on Hate |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-04/this-crowdfunding-site-runs-on-hate |accessdate=18 December 2017 |agency=Bloomberg|date=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] suspended Hatreon and the site became dormant.

==Political and economic views==
Wilson claims an array of influences from [[Anti-statism|anti-state]] and [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] political thinkers,&lt;ref name="PCmag"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2418761,00.asp|last=Steele|first=Chandra|title=Dismantle the State: Q&amp;A With 3D Gun Printer Cody Wilson|publisher=[[PC Magazine]]|date=May 9, 2013|accessdate=May 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; including leftist [[market anarchists]] like the [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualist]] scholar [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]],&lt;ref name="Guardian-May2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2013/may/06/3d-printable-guns-cody-wilson|last=Rayner|first=Alex|title=3D-printable guns are just the start, says Cody Wilson|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=May 6, 2013|accessdate=May 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/03/13/sxsw-printed-guns-wiki-weapons-cody-wilson_n_2868465.html|last=Ostroff|first=Joshua|title='Wiki Weapons' Maker Cody Wilson Says 3D Printed Guns 'Are Going To Be Possible Forever'|publisher=[[Huffington Post]]|date=March 12, 2013|accessdate=May 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Capitalism|capitalist]] [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] such as the [[Austrian School]] scholar [[Hans-Herman Hoppe]], and [[Classical liberalism|classical liberals]] including [[Frederic Bastiat]].&lt;ref name="blink"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PCmag"/&gt; His political thought has been compared to the "[[Conservative revolutionary movement|conservative revolutionary]]" ideas of [[Ernst Jünger]].&lt;ref name="Baffler1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thebaffler.com/salvos/anarchists-guns-and-money-siegel | last=Siegel|first=Jacob|title=Send Anarchists, Guns, and Money|publisher=[[The Baffler]]|date=May 1, 2018|accessdate=July 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacob Siegel wrote that "Cody Wilson arrives at a place where left, right—and democracy—disappear" and that he oscillates "somewhere between [[Anarch (sovereign individual)|anarch]] and anarchist."&lt;ref name="Baffler1"/&gt;

Wilson is an avowed [[crypto-anarchist]], and has discussed his work in relation to the cypherpunks and Timothy May's vision.&lt;ref name=DailyW1&gt;{{cite web|title=How This ‘Crypto-Anarchist’ Could Completely Destroy Gun Control|url=https://www.dailywire.com/news/22283/diy-untraceable-handguns-crypto-anarchist-cody-amanda-prestigiacomo/|publisher=The Daily Wire|date=October 16, 2017|accessdate=July 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He frequently cites the work of [[post-Marxist]] thinkers in public comments,&lt;ref name="VICE001"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Cody Wilson on 3D Printed Guns |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTYWGrfo-ao |access-date=July 7, 2018 |series=VICE MEETS |series-link= |first=Eddy|last=Moretti |network=VICE |station= |date=April 9, 2013 |season=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially that of [[Jean Baudrillard]], whom he has claimed as his "master."&lt;ref name=WiredDES&gt;{{cite web|title=Cody Wilson Wants to Destroy Your World|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/03/cody-wilson-wants-to-destroy-your-world/|publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=March 11, 2015|accessdate=July 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jacobite1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jacobitemag.com/2017/08/23/silicon-valley-struggle-sessions/ | last=Wilson|first=Cody|title=Silicon Valley Struggle Sessions|publisher=Jacobite|date=August 23, 2017|accessdate=July 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asked during an interview with ''[[Popular Science]]'' if the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]] affected his thinking or plans in any way, Wilson responded, "... understanding that rights and civil liberties are something that we protect is also understanding that they have consequences that are also protected, or tolerated. The exercise of civil liberties is antithetical to the idea of a completely totalizing state. That's just the way it is."''&lt;ref name="popsci2"/&gt;

Wilson is generally opposed to [[intellectual property]] rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Cody Wilson |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/n3cstlkp |access-date=July 7, 2018 |series=BBC HARDtalk |first=Stephen|last=Sackur |network=BBC |station= |date=March 11, 2014 |season=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has indicated that although his primary goal is the subversion of state-structures, he also hopes that his contributions may help to dismantle the existing system of capitalist property relations.&lt;ref name="BBC-March 2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIJThk-eTAM|title=Barack Obama Is A Grocery Clerk!

In a January 2013 interview with [[Glenn Beck]] on the nature of and motivations behind his effort to develop and share gun 3D printable files Wilson said, "That's a real political act, giving you a magazine, telling you that it will never be taken away. ... That's real politics. That's radical equality. That's what I believe in. ... I'm just resisting. What am I resisting? I don't know, the [[collectivism|collectivization]] of manufacture?  The institutionalization of the human psyche? I'm not sure. But I can tell you one thing: this is a symbol of irreversibility. They can never eradicate the gun from the earth."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glennbeck.com/2013/01/17/wiki-weapons-founder-they-can-never-eradicate-the-gun-from-the-earth/], January 17, 2013; accessed November 21, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual assault charge==
In September 2018, charges were filed against Wilson for allegedly [[Ages of consent in the United States#Texas|having sexual intercourse with a  16-year-old girl]] he met on SugarDaddyMeet, a website that matches older men with younger women. He is accused of committing a second-degree [[Felony#United States|felony]] after paying $500 to the girl for sex in a hotel room in [[Austin, Texas]] in August 2018. Austin police said they were alerted by a counselor who had been working with the girl.&lt;ref&gt;Hsu, Tiffany (September 19, 2018) [https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/19/business/cody-wilson-3d-guns-sexual-assault.html "3-D Printed Gun Promoter, Cody Wilson, Is Charged With Sexual Assault of Child."] New York Times.

It is alleged that after Wilson was told that a police investigation was underway, he fled&lt;ref name="Wired19092018"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dreyfuss |first1=Emily |last2=Lapowsky |first2=Issie |title=DIY Gun Activist Cody Wilson Accused of Child Sexual Assault |url=https://www.wired.com/story/cody-wilson-accused-child-sexual-assault/ |accessdate=21 September 2018 |publisher=Wired |date=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]], which does not have an [[extradition]] treaty with the U.S.&lt;ref name = "CBSNews20180919"&gt;{{cite news |title=Man at center of 3D-printed gun dispute charged with child sex assault |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cody-wilson-man-center-of-3d-printed-gun-dispute-charged-child-sex-assault-today-2018-09-19/ |work=CBS News|date = September 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = Owen| first = Tess|date = September 19, 2018|url = https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/vbnd5x/3d-printed-gun-activist-cody-wilson-charged-with-sexual-assault-of-a-minor|title = 3D-printed gun activist Cody Wilson charged with sexual assault of a minor|work =  [[Vice (website)|Vice]]|access-date = September 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dyer Brainerd Holmes''' (May 24, 1921 – January 11, 2013), known professionally as '''D. Brainerd Holmes''', was an [[United States|American]] engineer and business executive. He was perhaps best known for directing [[NASA]]'s manned spaceflight program from September 1961 to June 1963, when [[John Glenn]] made the pivotal first US orbital spaceflight, but Holmes was also the president of international defense contractor [[Raytheon]]. He retired from that post in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;OBITUARY: D. Brainerd Holmes, ''[[Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology]]'', January 21, 2013, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Holmes studied engineering at [[Cornell University]], receiving a degree in electrical engineering. He first worked for [[Bell Labs]] and [[Western Electric]], then moved to [[RCA]], becoming heavily involved in military contracting with that firm. He helped to develop the [[RIM-8 Talos|Talos antiaircraft missile]], and the electronic heart of the [[SM-65 Atlas|Atlas missile]]. He was part of the team that developed the US [[Ballistic Missile Early Warning System]], and was therefore highly visible in government circles. In 1961, in response to the [[Cold War]] fears that had been fueled by the October 1957 Soviet launch of the [[Sputnik]] satellite, US President [[John F. Kennedy]] had publicly vowed that his government would put a man on the moon, and safely return him to Earth, before the end of the decade. Holmes was hired to get it done.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/news/science/d-brainerd-holmes-a-leader-in-space-race-dies-at-91-670848/] Obituary, ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'', January 17, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

During his two-year tenure, he oversaw the Mercury program and planning for [[Project Gemini]] and the [[Apollo program]]. Possibly due to tensions with NASA Administrator [[James E. Webb]] over the extent of his authority to shape and schedule the various facets of the space program, he resigned in 1963 to become an executive at Raytheon. At that company he is credited with helping develop several of that company's missile developments, including the [[MIM-104 Patriot|Patriot antiballistic system]].&lt;ref&gt;Obituary, ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette''&lt;/ref&gt;

Holmes’ leadership in the space program was highlighted by ''TIME'' magazine in 1962, wherein he was quoted: "When a great nation is faced with a technological challenge, it has to accept or go backward. Space is the future of man, and the US must keep ahead in space."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/obituaries/2013/01/19/dyer-holmes-former-director-manned-spaceflight-nasa/bNdkShs8KaV7555667SXJN/story.html] D. Brainerd Holmes; guided manned space flight at NASA, ''[[The Washington Post]]'', January 19, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

At Raytheon, Holmes became a top executive, and was its president when it developed the Patriot missile in the 1970s. He also served as chairman of the [[Beechcraft|Beech Aircraft Corporation]] after it was acquired by Raytheon in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/news/science/d-brainerd-holmes-a-leader-in-space-race-dies-at-91-670848/] D. Brainerd Holmes, A Leader In Space Race, Dies At 91  ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'', January 17, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors and recognitions==
After Holmes was selected to lead the ballistic-missile-tracking program at RCA, Elmer Engstrom, the company president, told an interviewer, "The problem with systems engineering is to find people with a special knack for marrying men, machines, tactics and everything else into one large system. We could see right away that Holmes had the knack."

Holmes was featured on August 10, 1962 cover of [[Time (magazine)|TIME]] magazine, featuring the series ''Reaching For The Moon''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19620810,00.html] Time covers (website)&lt;/ref&gt;

NASA official Robert R. Gilruth compiled a history of that administration during his tenure. Gilruth had worked hard to persuade Holmes of the merit of a lunar-orbit rendezvous as part of the Moon-landing project, and he wrote of this time that the project's success owed much to Holmes' management-team approach, in which NASA officials "argued out our different opinions" before a course was set. He wrote, "A less skillful leader might have forced an early arbitrary decision that would have made the whole task of getting to the Moon virtually impossible."&lt;ref&gt;Obituary, ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette''&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Holmes was nominated in 1977 by Raytheon for membership in the [[List of members of the National Academy of Engineering (Electronics)|National Academy of Engineering]]. He was a member of the Electronics section of that group.

==Personal life==
Holmes was a resident of [[Wellesley, Massachusetts]] at the time of his death, but he died in a hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, due to complications of pneumonia. He was survived by his wife, Mary Margaret England Wilkes Holmes. He had two children from a previous marriage and three step-children at the time of death.

'''Ehud "Udi" Tenenbaum''' ({{lang-he|אהוד "אודי" טננבאום}}, born August 29, 1979) also known as '''The Analyzer''', is an [[Israelis|Israeli]] [[Software cracking|cracker]].

== Biography ==
Tenenbaum was born in [[Hod HaSharon]] in 1979. He is known under the infamous hacker alias "Pink Pony". Tenenbaum became widely famous in 1998, when aged 19 years and while he was the head of a small group of hackers, he was arrested for hacking computers belonging to [[NASA]], [[The Pentagon]], the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]], the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]], the [[Knesset]], [[MIT]] and other American and Israeli universities such as Dharma and ComTEC. The [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] and other federally funded research sites, and the computer of Israeli President [[Ezer Weizman]], as well as attempting to infiltrate the [[Israel Defense Forces]]' classified files. He also hacked into the computers of Palestinian groups, and claimed to have destroyed the website of [[Hamas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1998/apr/27/news/mn-43491 Hacker Case Taps Into Fame, Fury - Los Angeles Times]&lt;/ref&gt; Tenenbaum installed on some of the servers [[packet analyzer]] and [[trojan horse]] software.&lt;ref name="arrest"&gt;{{cite news|last=Reed|first=Dan|title=Whiz-kid hacker caught|url=http://www.mercurycenter.com/archives/reprints/hacker110698.htm|newspaper=San Jose Mercury News|date=November 6, 1998|author2=Wilson, David L.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001007150311/http://www.mercurycenter.com/archives/reprints/hacker110698.htm|archivedate=October 7, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time then-US Deputy Defense Secretary [[John Hamre]] insisted was "the most organized and systematic attack to date" on US military systems.&lt;ref name="solar_sunrise_hacker_analyzer_escapes"&gt;{{cite web |date=  15 June 2001&lt;!-- 21:27 GMT--&gt;|url = https://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/06/15/solar_sunrise_hacker_analyzer_escapes/|title = Solar Sunrise hacker ‘Analyzer’ escapes jail|publisher = [[The Register]]| accessdate = 2008-09-11 | last=[[Kevin Poulsen]] |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The military thought that they were witnessing a sophisticated Iraqi '[[information warfare]]'.&lt;ref name="solar_sunrise_hacker_analyzer_escapes"/&gt; In an effort to stop the supposed Iraqi hackers the United States government assembled agents from the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], the [[Air Force Office of Special Investigations]], [[NASA]], the [[United States Department of Justice|US Department of Justice]], the [[Defense Information Systems Agency]], the [[National Security Agency|NSA]], and the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]].&lt;ref name="FBI_Movie"&gt;{{cite video  |people     =Catherine M.

Later, the FBI sent agents to Israel to question Tenenbaum.

Before he was sentenced, Tenenbaum served briefly in the [[Israel Defense Forces]], but was released soon thereafter after he was involved in a [[traffic collision]]. 

In 2001, Tenenbaum pleaded guilty, while stating that he wasn't attempting to infiltrate the computer systems to get a hold of secrets but rather to prove that the systems were flawed. Tenenbaum was sentenced to a year and a half in prison,&lt;ref&gt;[http://info1.court.gov.il/Prod01/ManamHTML.nsf/77A6E341622C192242256BCF00692196/$FILE/7D4FD7EF6652B63E42256BBE003CBD5B.html?OpenElement]&lt;/ref&gt; from which he served only 8 months following the "[[Deri Law]]". After the attack the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] made a short 18 minutes training video called, ''Solar Sunrise: Dawn of a New Threat'' that was sold as part of hacker defense course &lt;ref name="Video.Solar.Sunrise"/&gt; that was discontinued in September 2004.&lt;ref name="iase.disa.mil"&gt;{{cite web |year= 2009 |url = http://iase.disa.mil/eta/iaetafaq.html|title = Information Assurance Training Products/ Courses Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs):|publisher = [[USA.gov]]| accessdate = May 23, 2009 | last= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, after being freed from prison, Tenenbaum founded his own [[Information security]] company called "2XS".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrg.co.il/online/10/ART/988/487.html]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In September 2008, following an investigation by Canadian police and the [[United States Secret Service|US Secret Service]], Tenenbaum and three accomplices were arrested in [[Montreal]]. Tenenbaum was charged with six counts of [[credit card fraud]], in the sum of approx. US$1.5 million.&lt;ref name="wired_2009"&gt;{{cite web |date= March 24, 2009|url = https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/tag/ehud-tenenbaum/|title = ‘The Analyzer’ Hack Probe Widens; $10 Million Allegedly Stolen From U.S. Banks|format = |publisher = [[Wired News]]| accessdate = May 23, 2009 | last=Kim Zetter |quote=}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. investigators suspected Tenenbaum of being part of a scam, in which the hackers penetrated financial institutions around the world to steal credit card numbers. They then sold these numbers to other people, who used them to perpetrate massive credit card fraud.&lt;ref name="Haaretz_2008"&gt;{{cite web |date= October 7, 2008|url = http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1026626.html|title = Israeli hacker said behind global ring that stole millions|publisher = [[Haaretz]]| accessdate = May 23, 2009 | last=Ofri Ilani |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later extradited to the United States to stand trial,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3709692,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; and was in the custody of the [[United States Marshals Service|US Marshals]] for more than a year. In August 2010, he was released on bond after agreeing to plead guilty.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4252506,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, after Tenenbaum accepted a [[plea bargain]] which may have involved cooperation in the investigation, New York district judge [[Edward Korman]] sentenced Tenenbaum to the time already served in prison. Tenenbaum was also ordered to pay $503,000 and given three years' probation.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name="wired_2012"&gt;{{cite web |date= July 5, 2012|url = https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/07/tenenbaum-sentenced/|title = ‘The Analyzer’ Gets Time Served for Million-Dollar Bank Heist|format = |publisher = [[Wired News]]| accessdate = July 6, 2012 | last= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emilio Prud’Homme y Maduro'''&lt;ref name=Clio&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ventura Almonte|first1=Juan|title=Historiadores puertoplateños miembros de la Academia Dominicana de la Historia|journal=Clío|date=2007|issue=173|pages=214–215|url=http://clio.academiahistoria.org.do/trabajos/clio173/Clio_2007_No_173-11.pdf|accessdate=13 April 2015|publisher=Academia Dominicana de la Historia|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; (August 20, 1856- July 21, 1932) was a [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] lawyer, writer, and educator. Prud’Homme is known for having authored the lyrics of the [[National Anthem of the Dominican Republic|Dominican National Anthem]]. He is also attributed with helping establish a national identity, for what was at the time a nascent [[republic]].

==Biography==
Emilio Prud’Homme was born in [[San Felipe de Puerto Plata|Puerto Plata]], [[Dominican Republic]] on August 20, 1856 to Ana Maduro and Gen.&amp;nbsp;Pedro Prud’Homme; he had a brother: Lorenzo Fenelón Prud’Homme.&lt;ref name=Clio/&gt;

Prud’Homme excelled in teaching, an activity to which he devoted most of his life. He was a great collaborator and disciple of [[Eugenio María de Hostos]] and taught at "Perserevancia of Azua" and also in the "Liceo Dominicano" in 1892 and was director of the "[[Normal School#Latin America|Normal School]]", a teaching college founded by Hostos in 1880.

He married to Manuela Batista on August 19, 1880, and had one daughter: Ana Emilia  Prud’Homme.&lt;ref name=Clio/&gt;

==Politics==
Prud’Homme was a [[legislator]] in the [[Congress of the Dominican Republic]]. He also served as the Secretary of Justice and Social Instruction in the administration of [[Francisco Henríquez y Carvajal]].&lt;ref name="Google books"&gt;{{cite book|title=Bulletin of the Pan American Union | volume=43 | publisher=Pan American Union, Union of American Republics|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HspmAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA401&amp;lpg=PA401&amp;dq=Emilio+Prud%27Homme+Secretary+of+Justice#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|via=google.com|accessdate=31 March 2011|page=401| year=1916 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prud’Homme was publicly critical of the [[United States occupation of the Dominican Republic (1916–1924)|United States occupation]] and as a result was forced to resign his teaching post. As a result, he pursued a career as a lawyer.

==Writing career==
Most of his literary works were directed to the exaltation of patriotic values, respect and love for the defense of sovereignty and national independence.

His [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] being the [[National Anthem of the Dominican Republic|Dominican National Anthem]], which was written in 1883, with music by [[José Rufino Reyes y Siancas]]. He later modified his work in 1897, when it began to be used at official state functions. Yet, it was not officially the National Anthem until 1934, when then dictator [[Rafael Leónidas Trujillo]] consecrated it as a national symbol and made mandatory its use at state and public functions.

Captain '''Frederick John Holroyd''' was a British soldier who was based at the [[British Army]]'s 3 Brigade HQ in mid-Ulster, [[Northern Ireland]] during the 1970s. He enlisted as a gunner in the [[Royal Artillery]], and three years later, in 1964, he was commissioned into the [[Royal Army Service Corps]] (later the [[Royal Corps of Transport]]). He volunteered for the Special Military Intelligence Unit in Northern Ireland in 1969, and he was trained at the [[Joint Services School of Intelligence]]. Once his training was finished, he was stationed in [[Portadown]], where, for two and a half years up to 1975, he ran a series of intelligence operations. He resigned from the Army in 1976.

==Collusion allegations==
Holroyd described a policy of assassinations and [[collusion]] between the [[British Army]] [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Intelligence Corps]] and [[Ulster loyalist]] paramilitaries in [[Northern Ireland]]. Holroyd was one of a number of former members of British forces who either exposed or admitted to such activity, the most prominent being [[Colin Wallace]] and [[John Weir (loyalist)|John Weir]] (see [[Dublin and Monaghan bombings]]).

Holroyd also claimed that during the mid-1970s the [[Special Air Service]] (SAS) used the cover name, "4 Field Survey Troop, Royal Engineers" (see [[14 Intelligence Company]]) during operations. This [[modus operandi]] was introduced in 1973 and abandoned in 1975. Fred Holroyd claimed this was an SAS unit under cover at the Royal Engineers' base at [[Castledillon]], [[County Armagh]], which he visited (see [[14 Intelligence Company]]). Holroyd said he worked with the members of this unit and that members were told that it was a NITAT (Northern Ireland Training and Tactics Team), whose personnel were "former, serving or recently trained"&lt;ref name="bambridge"&gt;''Ambush: the war between the SAS and the IRA'', James Adams, Robin Morgan &amp; Anthony Bambridge, Pan, London 1988 {{ISBN|0-330-30893-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; SAS soldiers, with the commanders being infantry officers attached to the SAS. One of these was Captain [[Robert Nairac]], described as, "seconded to 14th Intelligence", otherwise known as 14 Intelligence Company" or '14 Int'.&lt;ref name="bambridge"/&gt;

He also added to allegations that a cabal of right-wing British intelligence operatives from [[MI5]] and the [[Secret Intelligence Service|SIS]], along with figures from the British establishment, had been involved in a plot to destabilise/overthrow Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] through a secret organization known as ''"Group 13"''. The former intelligence officer [[Peter Wright]], author of ''[[Spycatcher]]'', was said to have been part of this group. Holroyd's allegations surfaced again in a ''[[New Statesman]]'' article written by [[Duncan Campbell (journalist)|Duncan Campbell]] in 1984. Holroyd's allegations helped form the basis for the 1990 [[Ken Loach]] film, ''[[Hidden Agenda (1990 film)|Hidden Agenda]]''. {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==Involvement with Ken Livingstone MP==
Labour Member of Parliament in the UK, [[Ken Livingstone]], formerly Head of the Greater London Council, latterly Mayor of London, took up the case of Fred Holroyd, and used his maiden speech as MP to highlight Holroyd's allegations.

{{quote|During my election campaign in Brent, East, there was an unusual public meeting. An individual was invited to it who has never been a Socialist, who will never be prepared to vote Labour and who thinks that the Tory party is the natural governing party of Britain.

He was invited to share a platform with myself and some of the relative's of those who have been subjected to miscarriages of justice by the British courts over issues of bombing here in Britain. We invited Mr. Fred Holroyd.  For those who do not know, Mr. Holroyd served in Northern Ireland with distinction. As I said, he is no Socialist. He comes from a military family. He went to a Yorkshire grammar school. His whole objective in life was to serve in the British Army. He believed in it totally. He enlisted as a private in the gunners, and 3 years later he was commissioned into the Royal Corps of Transport. He volunteered for the Special Military Intelligence unit in Northern Ireland when the present troubles began, and he was trained at the Joint Services School of Intelligence. Once his training was finished, he was stationed in Portadown, where, for two and a half years, he ran a series of intelligence operations.

When he was recruited as an MI6 officer, he said of them that they were not disagreeable; their ethics were reasonable; they were seeking a political solution.  His complaint, which eventually led to his removal from the Army and an attempt to discredit him, which has been largely successful, was made when the MI6 operation was taken over by MI5 in 1975 - by many of the same people who are dealt with in Peter Wright's book (''[[Spycatcher]]''), and many of the same people who are alleged to have been practicing treason against the elected Labour Government of the time. He said that once the MI5 took over the reasonable ethics of MI6 were pushed aside by operatives in the intelligence world who supported the views of [[Frank Kitson|Mr. Kitson]] and the policies and tactics of subverting the subverters. I recommend Brigadier Kitson's words to those who are not aware of them. His attitude was to create a counter-terror group, to have agents provocateur, to infiltrate and to run a dirty tricks campaign in an attempt to discredit the IRA.

Mr Holroyd continued to believe that what he was doing was in the best interests of the British state until early in 1975, when Captain [[Robert Nairac]], who, as many hon. Members will know, was later murdered by the IRA, went into his office, fresh from a cross-border operation -- something that of course is completely illegal -- and showed him the colour photographs that had been taken by Captain Nairac's team. Captain Nairac had crossed the border with some volunteers from the UVF. He had assassinated [[John Francis Green]], an active member of the IRA who was living south of the border. As an agent of the British Government operating across the border as an assassin he had brought back photographs as proof of that operation.

When Captain Nairac showed the photographs, Mr. Holroyd started to object, not because he objected to an active member of IRA being assassinated in a highly illegal cross-border raid but because he realised that once the British state started to perpetrate such methods there was no way that eventually Britain would not alienate vast sections of the community and eventually lose the struggle for the hearts and minds of the Irish people.

Holroyd then started to object to the use of such illegal methods by MI5 officers. He was immediately shuffled to one side by the expedient method of being taken to a mental hospital and being declared basically unfit for duty. During the month he spend in the British mental hospital, the three tests that were administered to him were completely successfully passed.

...What is particularly disturbing is that what looked at the time like a random act of maniacal violence and sectarian killing now begins to take on a much more sinister stance. It begins to emerge that Captain Robert Nairac is quite likely the person who organised the killing of the three Miami showband musicians. The evidence for that allegation is forensic and members of the UVF are prepared to say that they were members of the UVF gang who actually undertook the murder of the Miami showband musicians. The evidence is quite clear. The same gun that was used by Captain Nairac on his cross-border trip to assassinate John Francis Green was used in the Miami showband massacre.&lt;ref&gt;Excerpt from Ken Livingstone's maiden speech, Hansard Parliamentary Debates, vol 118, 7 July 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Livingstone also asked a series of questions in the parliament session about Holroyd's treatment following his allegations of collusion between British Army Intelligence and loyalist paramilitaries. {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==Life after the military==
Following the surfacing of these allegations Holroyd claims to have been forcibly retired from [[MI6]] and placed in a mental health institution. Holroyd has campaigned since then to have the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] admit that he was wrongly institutionalised. {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Holroyd wrote the book ''War without Honour'' with [[Nick Burbridge]]. It was published in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;''War without Honour: True Story of Military Intelligence in Northern Ireland'', Fred Holroyd &amp; Nick Burbridge, Medium: 1989; {{ISBN|1-872398-00-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Barron report into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings==
Holroyd gave evidence to Mr Justice Henry Barron during his inquiry into the [[Dublin and Monaghan Bombings]] of 17 May 1974. Holroyd stated that ''"the bombings were part of a pattern of collusion between elements of the security forces in Northern Ireland and loyalist paramilitaries."''&lt;ref&gt;Report of the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan Bombings, December 2003, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;

Barron was asked about a seeming contradiction in Holroyd's input to the report during public hearings:

{{quote|Since that time Captain Holroyd has persistently accused the British army of having engaged in serious unlawful acts, including murder and kidnapping, of encouraging assisting Loyalist paramilitaries in the commission of such acts, of recruiting agents from the ranks of the security forces of this State and of acts of gross incompetence which resulted in loss of life".&lt;ref&gt;Interim Barron report (2003), p. 179, paragraph 2&lt;/ref&gt;

For that reason, his [Holroyd's] claims justify careful scrutiny.  At the same time it must be acknowledged that Holroyd is, in some ways, a compromise source".&lt;ref&gt;Page 179, paragraph 5, of the Interim Barron report 2003&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When asked at a public hearing what he meant by "compromise source", Barron replied:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are many reports on him suggesting that he is a [[Walter Mitty]] type. That is probably the easiest way of explaining it... We said his detail was totally unreliable but the substance related to events which took place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irlgov.ie/oireachtas/Committees-29th-D%25C3%25A1il/jcjedwr-debates/scbr030204a.rtf&amp;e=9797 3 February 2004 Sub-Committee on the Barron Report public hearings]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his official statement to the Oireachtas joint Committee, Barron stated: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;A number of Holroyd's allegations are not completely true, but they relate to events that did happen. Insofar as they raise serious questions concerning the behaviour of the security forces, North and South during the 1970s, they are of relevance to the work of this Inquiry, and have contributed to the Inquiry's view on the possibility of collusion between elements of the security forces in Northern Ireland and loyalist paramilitaries.&lt;ref name=barron&gt;Mr Justice Henry Barron's statement to the Oireachtas Joint Committee, 10 December 2003, also repeated up to word "... inquiry", p. 203 of Barron Report&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Barron also stated in his Report,

&lt;blockquote&gt;It must be said that when interviewed by the Inquiry [Holroyd] made no effort to avoid any questions asked of him; nor did he appear to be withholding information. He gave his answers openly, fairly and with conviction. He is aware that he has been misquoted and misinterpreted on occasion and has sought to correct any misapprehensions where they have arisen. He has also shown a willingness to take on board evidence and information which seem to contradict his claims, though for the most part he has maintained the truth of his allegations and of their provenance.&lt;ref&gt;''Report on the Report of the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan Bombings'', Dublin: 2003, p. 262&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his report Barron found that members of the Gardaí and of the RUC attempted to unfairly and unjustly undermine the evidence and character of Holroyd. For instance 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Holroyd was also proven correct in his allegation that a Garda officer arranged a meeting in Dublin between an Irish Army EOD officer and his British counterpart. The denial of the Garda officer concerned that he requested Holroyd organise the meeting should be read in the light of his attempts to deny knowing or meeting Holroyd at all, which are not convincing.&lt;ref name=barron/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Barron also noted, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Some of the RUC officers interviewed by the Inquiry, in their apparent eagerness to deny Holroyd any credibility whatsoever, themselves made inaccurate and misleading statements which have unfortunately tarnished their own credibility.&lt;ref name=barron/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Then Assistant Commissioner of the Gardaí (Republic of Ireland police force), Edmund Garvey denied that he had met Holroyd at Garda headquarters in 1975. Holroyd named Garvey, and another Garda (codename: "the badger"), as being on the ''"British side"''.&lt;ref name=barron/&gt; Justice Barron found: "The visit by Holroyd to Garda Headquarters unquestionably did take place, notwithstanding former Commissioner Garvey's inability to recall it".&lt;ref name=barron/&gt; Barron further noted: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;On the Northern side, there is conflicting evidence as to how, why and by whom the visit was arranged. Regrettably, Garda investigations have failed to uncover any documentary evidence of the visit, or to identify any of the officers involved in arranging it from the Southern side.&lt;ref name=barron/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 19 January 1978, then Commissioner Edmund Garvey was sacked without explanation by the incoming Fianna Fáil Government, which stated that it no longer had ''"confidence"'' in him as Garda Commissioner. {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

{{Geronimo chronology}}

'''Geronimo''' ({{lang-apm|Goyaałé}} {{IPA-ath|kòjàːɬɛ́|}} "the one who yawns"; June 16, 1829&amp;nbsp;– February 17, 1909) was a prominent leader and medicine man from the Bedonkohe band of the [[Apache]] tribe.  From 1850 to 1886 Geronimo joined with members of three other Chiricahua Apache bands—the Tchihende, the Tsokanende and the Nednhi—to carry out numerous raids as well as resistance to US and Mexican military campaigns in the northern Mexico states of [[Chihuahua (State)|Chihuahua]] and [[Sonora]], and in the southwestern American territories of [[New Mexico]] and [[Arizona]].  Geronimo's raids and related combat actions were a part of the prolonged period of the [[Apache Wars|Apache–United States]] conflict, which started with American settlement in Apache lands following the end of the [[Mexican–American War|war with Mexico]] in 1848.

While well known, Geronimo was not a chief among the Chiricahua or the Bedonkohe band.&lt;ref name= Debo1989&gt;{{cite book |last=Debo |first=Angie |title=Geronimo: The Man, His Time, His Place |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N-jGArzx7hkC&amp;pg=PA13 |accessdate=February 2, 2012 |year=1989 |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |location=Oklahoma City |isbn=978-0-8061-1828-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|38}}&lt;ref name= Utley2012&gt;{{cite book |last=Utley |first=Robert M. |title=Geronimo |year=2012 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven CT |isbn=978-0-8061-1828-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1–2}}  At any one time, about 30 to 50 Apaches would be following him.{{sfn|Utley|2012|pp=1, 2}} However, since he was a superb leader in raiding and warfare he frequently led large numbers of men and women beyond his own following.{{sfn|Utley|2012|pp=1, 2}}

During Geronimo's final period of conflict from 1876 to 1886 he "surrendered" three times and accepted life on the Apache reservations in Arizona.{{sfn|Debo|1986. When Geronimo surrendered to General Nelson Miles for the last time in 1886, he said "This is the fourth time I have surrendered"|p=293}}  Reservation life was confining to the free-moving Apache people, and they  resented restrictions on their customary way of life.{{sfn|Utley|2012.  These restrictions included directives against wife beating and mutilation of women for adultery, and directives against the manufacture of Tiswin, an alcoholic drink fermented from corn.|pp=152, 153}}

In 1886, after an intense pursuit in Northern Mexico by U.S. forces that followed Geronimo's third 1885 reservation "breakout", Geronimo surrendered for the last time to Lt. [[Charles B. Gatewood|Charles Bare Gatewood]], an Apache-speaking [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] graduate who had earned Geronimo's respect a few years before. Geronimo was later transferred to General [[Nelson Miles]] at [[Skeleton Canyon]], just north of the Mexican/American boundary.  Miles treated Geronimo as a [[prisoner of war]] and acted promptly to remove Geronimo first to [[Fort Bowie]], then to the railroad at Bowie Station, Arizona where he and 27 other Apaches were sent off to join the rest of the Chiricahua tribe which had been previously exiled to [[Florida]].{{sfn|Debo|1986|p=268}}

In his old age, Geronimo became a celebrity. He appeared at fairs, including the [[1904 World's Fair]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], where he reportedly rode a ferris wheel and sold souvenirs and photographs of himself. However, he was not allowed to return to the land of his birth. He died at the [[Fort Sill]] hospital in 1909.{{sfn|Debo|1986|pp=440, 441}}  He was still a prisoner of war.  He is buried at the Fort Sill Indian Agency Cemetery surrounded by the graves of relatives and other Apache prisoners of war.{{sfn|Debo|1986|pp=443, 444}}

==Background==
Apache is the collective term for several culturally related groups of Native Americans originally from the Southwest United States. The current division of Apachean groups includes the Western Apache, [[Chiricahua]], Mescalero, Jicarilla, [[Lipan Apache people|Lipan]] and Plains Apache (formerly Kiowa-Apache).

During the centuries of [[Apache-Mexico Wars|Apache-Mexican]] and [[Apache Wars|Apache-United States]] conflict, raiding had become embedded in the Apache way of life, used not only for strategic purposes but also as an economic enterprise,{{sfn|Debo|1986 Speaking of the start of the Spanish/Mexican Apache conflict Debo states, "Thus the Apaches were driven into the mountains and raiding the settled communities became a way of life for them, an economic enterprise as legitimate as gathering berries or hunting deer..."|p=28}} and often there was overlap between raids for economic need and warfare.{{sfn|Utley|2012, "Raids in Mexico and New Mexico and Arizona had become a way of life, blurring the distinction between raids and war. Chiricahua culture held raids justified by need, but not always confined to need. It could also be rationalized as war since hostilities provided constant justification for revenge." p. 130.}} Raids ranged from stealing livestock and other plunder, to the capture and/or killing of victims, sometimes by torture.{{sfn|Utley|2012|pp=1, 130}} Mexicans and Americans responded with retaliatory attacks against the Apache which were no less violent and were very seldom limited to identified individual adult enemies. The raiding and retaliation fed the fires of a virulent revenge warfare that reverberated back and forth between Apaches and Mexicans and later, Apaches and Americans. From 1850 to 1886 Geronimo, as well as other Apache leaders, conducted attacks, but Geronimo was driven by a desire to take revenge for the murder of his family and accumulated a record of brutality during this time that was unmatched by any of his contemporaries.{{sfn|Utley|2012|p=1 "Geronimo practiced all forms of raiding and accumulated a record of brutality that matched any of his comrades."}} His fighting ability extending over 30 years forms a major characteristic of his persona.{{sfn|Utley|2012|p=130}}

Among Geronimo's own Chiricahua tribe many had mixed feelings about him. While respected as a skilled and effective leader of raids or warfare, he emerges as not very likable, and he was not widely popular among the other Apache.{{sfn|Utley|2012|pp=1, 2}} This was primarily because he refused to give in to American government demands leading to some Apaches fearing the American responses to Geronimo's sense of Indian nationalism.  Nevertheless, Apache people stood in awe of Geronimo's "powers" which he demonstrated to them on a series of occasions. These powers indicated to other Apaches that Geronimo had super-natural gifts that he could use for good or ill.  In eye-witness accounts by other Apaches, Geronimo was able to become aware of distant events as they happened,{{sfn|Utley|2012|p=140}} and he was able to anticipate events that were in the future.{{sfn|Utley|2012|pp=130–131}}  He also demonstrated powers to heal other Apaches.{{sfn|Utley|2012|p=2}}

==Early life==
[[File:Ta-ayz-slath, wife of Geronimo, and one child.jpg|thumb|Ta-ayz-slath, wife of Geronimo, and child]]

Geronimo was born to the [[Chiricahua|Bedonkohe]] band of the Apache, near Turkey Creek, a tributary of the [[Gila River]] in the modern-day state of [[New Mexico]], then part of [[Mexico]], though the Apache disputed Mexico's claim.&lt;ref name=story/&gt; His grandfather, Mahko, had been chief of the Bedonkohe Apache. He had three brothers and four sisters.&lt;ref name="Adams"&gt;{{cite book |last=Adams |first=Alexander B. |title=Geronimo: a Biography |publisher=Da Capo Press |year=1990 |page=391 |isbn=978-0-306-80394-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His parents raised him according to Apache traditions; after the death of his father, his mother took him to live with the [[Chiricahua#Bands|Tchihende]] and he grew up with them. Geronimo married a woman named Alope, from the Nedni-Chiricahua band of Apache when he was 17; they had three children. She was the first of nine wives. On March 5, 1858, a company of 400&amp;nbsp;Mexican soldiers from [[Sonora]] led by Colonel José María Carrasco attacked Geronimo's camp outside Janos (Kas-Ki-Yeh in Apache) while the men were in town trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Haugen |first=Brenda |title=Geronimo: Apache Warrior |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0cGqKcWIlTIC&amp;pg=PA9 |year=2005 |publisher=Capstone |pages=9–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Geronimo His own story |url=http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/biographies/geronimo/kas-ki-yeh.php |website=American History – From Revolution to Reconstruction and what happened afterwards |accessdate=May 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those killed were his wife, children and mother. The loss of his family led Geronimo to hate all Mexicans for the rest of his life; he and his followers would frequently attack and kill any group of Mexicans that they encountered. Recalling that at the time his band was at peace with the Mexicans, Geronimo remembered the incident as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Late one afternoon when returning from town we were met by a few women and children who told us that Mexican troops from some other town had attacked our camp, killed all the warriors of the guard, captured all our ponies, secured our arms, destroyed our supplies, and killed many of our women and children. Quickly we separated, concealing ourselves as best we could until nightfall, when we assembled at our appointed place of rendezvous&amp;nbsp;— a thicket by the river. Silently we stole in one by one, sentinels were placed, and when all were counted, I found that my aged mother, my young wife, and my three small children were among the slain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sweeney |first=Edwin R. |editor-first= Charles Leland |editor-last= Sonnichsen |title=Geronimo and the End of the Apache Wars |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HcM0JnSsHcEC&amp;pg=PA36 |year=1986 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Geronimo's chief, [[Mangas Coloradas]], sent him to [[Cochise]]'s band for help in his revenge against the Mexicans. It was during this incident that the name ''Geronimo'' came about. This appellation stemmed from a battle in which, ignoring a deadly hail of bullets, he repeatedly attacked Mexican soldiers with a knife. The origin of the name is a source of controversy with historians, some writing that it was appeals by the soldiers to [[Jerome|Saint Jerome]] ("Jeronimo!") for help. Others source it as the mispronunciation of his name by the Mexican soldiers.{{sfn|Debo|1986|p=13}}

===Religion===
Geronimo was raised with the traditional religious views of the Bedonkohe. When questioned about his views on life after death, he wrote in his 1905 autobiography, &lt;blockquote&gt;As to the future state, the teachings of our tribe were not specific, that is, we had no definite idea of our relations and surroundings in after life. We believed that there is a life after this one, but no one ever told me as to what part of man lived after death&amp;nbsp;... We held that the discharge of one's duty would make his future life more pleasant, but whether that future life was worse than this life or better, we did not know, and no one was able to tell us. We hoped that in the future life, family and tribal relations would be resumed. In a way we believed this, but we did not know it.&lt;ref name=Barrett1971&gt;{{cite book |author=Geronimo |editor-first= S. M. | editor-last= Barrett |title=Geronimo, His Own Story |year=1971 |publisher=Ballantine Books |location=New York, New York |id=LCCCN 72-113457 |isbn=0-349-10260-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|178}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his later years Geronimo embraced Christianity, and stated
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Since my life as a prisoner has begun, I have heard the teachings of the white man's religion, and in many respects believe it to be better than the religion of my fathers&amp;nbsp;... Believing that in a wise way it is good to go to church, and that associating with Christians would improve my character, I have adopted the Christian religion. I believe that the church has helped me much during the short time I have been a member. I am not ashamed to be a Christian, and I am glad to know that the President of the United States is a Christian, for without the help of the Almighty I do not think he could rightly judge in ruling so many people. I have advised all of my people who are not Christians, to study that religion, because it seems to me the best religion in enabling one to live right.&lt;ref name=Barrett1971 /&gt;{{rp|181}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He joined the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] in 1903, but four years later was [[Excommunication|expelled]] for gambling.&lt;ref name=Barrett1971 /&gt;{{rp|181}} To the end of his life, he seemed to harbor ambivalent religious feelings, telling the Christian missionaries at a summer camp meeting in 1908 that he wanted to start over, while at the same time telling his tribesmen that he held to the old Apache religion.&lt;ref name= Debo1989 /&gt;{{rp|437–438}}

==Life after the massacre at Kas-Ki-Yeh==
The first Apache raids on [[Sonora]] and [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] took place during the late 17th century. To counter the early Apache raids on [[Spaniards|Spanish]] settlements, [[presidio]]s were established at Janos (1685) in [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua]] and at [[Fronteras]] (1690) in northern eastern modern state of Chihuahua (then [[Opata people|Opata]] country). In 1835, Mexico had placed a bounty on Apache scalps. Two years later, [[Mangas Coloradas]] became principal chief and war leader and began a series of retaliatory raids against the [[Mexican people|Mexicans]]. Apache raids on Mexican villages were so numerous and brutal that no area was safe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epcc.edu/nwlibrary/borderlands/18_apache.htm Apache Indians Southwest]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007202003/http://www.epcc.edu/nwlibrary/borderlands/18_apache.htm |date=October 7, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1820 and 1835 alone, some 5000 Mexicans died in Apache raids, and 100 settlements were destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Spring |last=Hermann |year=1997 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W63NQtM-if4C |title=Geronimo: Apache freedom fighter |publisher=Enslow Publishers |page=26 |isbn=0-89490-864-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, as a leader, Geronimo was notorious for urging raids and war on Mexican Provinces and American locations in the southwest.&lt;ref name=Geronimoraids&gt;{{cite book |last=Ball |first=Eve |title=Indeh: An Apache Odyssey |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |year=1988 |isbn=0-8061-2165-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in his life, Geronimo became invested in the continuing and relentless cycle of revenge warfare between the Apaches and Mexicans. On March 5, 1851,{{sfn|Utley|2012 Utley provides a specific date of March 5, 1851, whereas Debo places the date at about 1850. Utley, in his preface notes that he has the benefit of more research in 2012 than Debo in her book first published in 1976, including deeper review of Mexican records providing insight into specific events in Sonora and Chihuahua.|p=27}} when Geronimo was in his 20s, a force of Mexican militia from Sonora under Colonel Jose Maria Carrasco attacked and surprised an Apache camp outside of Janos, Chihuahua, slaughtering the inhabitants, including Geronimo's family. Col. Carrasco claimed he had followed the Apaches to [[Janos, Chihuahua]] after they had conducted a raid in Sonora, taken livestock and other plunder and badly defeated Mexican militia.{{sfn|Debo|1986|p=34}}{{sfn|Utley|2012|pp=26–27}} Geronimo was absent at the time of the attack on the Apache camp, but when he returned he found that his mother, wife, and his three children were among the dead.{{sfn|Utley|2012|p=27, 28}} In retaliation, Geronimo joined in an extended series of revenge attacks against the Mexicans.&lt;ref name=GeronimoStory/&gt; This event left Geronimo with a bitter and very personal hatred for Mexicans, and he often killed them indiscriminately and with a special vehemence.{{sfn|Utley|2012|p=130}} Throughout Geronimo's adult life his antipathy, suspicion and dislike for Mexicans was demonstrably greater than for Americans.{{sfn|Debo|1986|pp=37–39}}

Attacks and counter-attacks were common. In December 1860, 30 miners launched a surprise attack on an encampment of Bedonkohes Apaches on the west bank of the [[Mimbres River]] of modern New Mexico. According to historian Edwin R. Sweeney, the miners "...killed four Indians, wounded others, and captured thirteen women and children." Retaliation by the Apache again followed, with raids against U.S. citizens and property.&lt;ref name="GeronimoStory2"/&gt;

According to ''National Geographic'', "the governor of Sonora claimed in 1886 that in the last five months of Geronimo's wild career, his band of 16 warriors slaughtered some 500 to 600 Mexicans."&lt;ref name=autobio&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Pt3ys6DmI1cC |title=My Life: The Autobiography of Geronimo |year=2010 |publisher=Fireship Press |isbn=978-1-935585-25-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' Vol 182 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I have killed many Mexicans; I do not know how many, for frequently I did not count them. Some of them were not worth counting. It has been a long time since then, but still I have no love for the Mexicans. With me they were always treacherous and malicious.|Geronimo|My Life: The Autobiography of Geronimo, 1905.}}

===Massacre at Casas Grandes===
[[File:Goyaale.jpg|thumb|Geronimo (Goyaałé), a Bedonkohe Apache; kneeling with rifle, 1887]]

In 1873 the Mexicans once again attacked the Apache.&lt;ref name=GeronimoCasaGrande&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/B/geronimo/geroni10.htm |title=Geronimo's story of his life |accessdate=May 10, 2011 |chapter=Heavy Fighting | editor-first= S. M. | editor-last= Barrett |origyear=1909 |year=1915 |publisher=New York: Duffield &amp; Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; After months of fighting in the mountains, the Apaches and Mexicans decided on a peace treaty at [[Casas Grandes Municipality|Casas Grandes]], Chihuahua, Mexico.&lt;ref name=GeronimoCasaGrande /&gt; After terms were agreed, the Mexican troops gave [[mescal]] to the Apaches and, while they were intoxicated, they attacked and killed 20 Apaches and captured some.&lt;ref name=GeronimoCasaGrande /&gt; The Apache were forced to retreat into the mountains once again.&lt;ref name=GeronimoCasaGrande /&gt;

Though outnumbered, Geronimo fought against both Mexican and United States troops and became famous for his daring exploits and numerous escapes from capture from 1858 to 1886.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/05/movies/film-geronimo-still-with-a-few-rough-edges.html?pagewanted=4&amp;src=pm FILM; Geronimo, Still With a Few Rough Edges]". ''The New York Times''. December 5, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; One such escape, as legend has it, took place in the [[Robledo Mountains]] of southwest New Mexico. The legend states that Geronimo and his followers entered a cave, and the U.S. soldiers waited outside the entrance for him, but he never came out. Later, it was heard that Geronimo was spotted outside, nearby. The second entrance through which he escaped has yet to be found and the cave is still called Geronimo's Cave, even though no reference to this event or this cave has been found in the historic or oral record. Moreover, there are many stories of this type with other caves referenced that state that Geronimo or other Apaches entered to escape troops, but were not seen exiting. These stories are in all likelihood apocryphal.&lt;ref name=GeronimoStory2&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/B/geronimo/geroni12.htm |title=Geronimo's story of his life |accessdate=May 10, 2011 |chapter=Coming of the White Men | editor-first= S.

&lt;blockquote&gt;After about a year some trouble arose between them and the Indians, and I took the war path as a warrior, not as a chief. I had not been wronged, but some of my people had been, and I fought with my tribe; for the soldiers and not the Indians were at fault.&lt;ref name=GeronimoStory2&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/B/geronimo/geroni12.htm |title=Geronimo's story of his life |accessdate=May 10, 2011 |chapter=Coming of the White Men | editor-first= S.

At the end of his military career, he led a small band of 38 men, women, and children. They evaded thousands of Mexican and American troops for over a year, making him the most famous Native American of the time and earning him the title of the "worst Indian who ever lived" among white settlers.&lt;ref name="The American Experience, We Shall Remain: Geronimo"&gt;{{cite web |title=The American Experience, We Shall Remain: Geronimo |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/weshallremain/the_films/episode_4_trailer |accessdate=November 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to James L. Haley, "About two weeks after the escape there was a report of a family massacred near [[Silver City, New Mexico|Silver City]]; one girl was taken alive and hanged from a meat hook jammed under the base of her skull."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=James L. |last=Haley |year=1997 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RAfJwmMeq5IC&amp;pg=PA381 |title=Apaches: a history and culture portrait |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |page=381 |isbn=0-8061-2978-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; His band was one of the last major forces of independent Native American warriors who refused to accept the United States occupation of the [[American West]].

===Geronimo Campaign===
The [[Apache Wars|Apache–United States]] conflict was itself a direct outgrowth of the much older [[Apache-Mexico Wars|Apache–Mexican]] conflict which had been ongoing in the same general area since the beginning of Mexican/Spanish settlement in the 1600s.

On May 17, 1885, a number of Apache including [[Nana (chief)|Nana]], Mangus (son of [[Mangas Coloradas]]), [[Chihuahua (chief)|Chihuahua]], [[Naiche]], Geronimo, and their followers fled the [[San Carlos Reservation]] in Arizona after a show of force against the reservation's commanding officer [[Britton Davis]]. The people, who had lived as semi-nomads for generations, disliked the restrictive reservation system. Department of Arizona General [[George Crook]] dispatched two columns of troops into Mexico, the first commanded by Captain [[Emmet Crawford]] and the second by Captain Wirt Davis. Each was composed of a troop of cavalry (usually about forty men) and about 100 Apache scouts. They pursued the Apache through the summer and fall through Mexican Chihuahua and back across the border into the United States. The Apache continually raided settlements, killing other Native Americans and civilians and stealing horses.&lt;ref name=hurst&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hurst |first1=James |title=Geronimo's surrender – Skeleton Canyon, 1886 |url=http://www.southernnewmexico.com/Articles/People/Geronimossurrender-Skelet.html |accessdate=September 18, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150826013352/http://www.southernnewmexico.com/Articles/People/Geronimossurrender-Skelet.html |archivedate=August 26, 2015 |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Apaches were shielded from the violence of warfare on the reservation, disability and death from diseases like malaria was much more prevalent.{{sfn|Utley|2012|p=96, 108}}  On the other hand, rations were provided by the government, though at times the corruption of Indian agents caused rationing to become perilously scarce.{{sfn|Utley|2012|p=1, 2, 96}}  Rebelling against reservation life, other Apache leaders had led their bands in "breakouts" from the reservations.  On three separate occasions — August 1878;{{sfn|Utley|2012. Utley gives the date of the breakout as August 1, in contrast to the April date cited by Debo – see next footnote.

The Apache knew the rough terrain of the Sierras intimately,{{sfn|Utley|2012|p=160}} which helped them elude pursuit and protected them from attack.  The Sierra Madre mountains lie on the border  between the Mexican states of Sonora and  Chihuahua, which allowed the Apache access to raid and plunder the small villages, haciendas, wagon trains, worker camps and travelers in both states.{{sfn|Utley|2012|p=160}}   From Mexico, Apache bands also staged surprise raids back into the United States, often seeking to replenish his band's supply of guns and ammunition.{{sfn|Utley|2012. This reference in Utley is to a specific raid in March 1883, in which Geronimo's people split up with Geronimo and Chihuahua raiding in the Sonora River valley to collect livestock and provisions, while Chatto and Bonito raided through southern Arizona to gather weapons and cartridges.|p=133}}  In these raids into the United States the Apaches moved swiftly and attacked isolated ranches, wagon trains, prospectors, and travelers.  During these raids the Apaches often killed all the persons they encountered{{sfn|Utley|2012.  The reference is to the March 1883 raid in southern Arizona, by Chatto and Bonito in which Utley notes, "They killed anyone they encountered...", which totaled "Eleven whites..."|p=133}} in order to avoid detection and pursuit as long as possible before they slipped back over the border into Mexico.

The "breakouts" and the subsequent resumption of Apache raiding and warfare caused the Mexican Army and militia, as well as United States forces to pursue and attempt to kill or apprehend off-reservation "renegade" Apache bands, including Geronimo's, wherever they could be found.  Because the Mexican army and militia units of Sonora and Chihuahua were unable to suppress the several Chiricahua bands based in the Sierra Madre mountains, in 1883 Mexico allowed the United States to send troops into Mexico to continue their pursuit of Geronimo's band and the bands of other Apache leaders.{{sfn|Utley|2012|p=136}}  The United States Army operating under the command of General [[George Crook]] successfully utilized [[Apache Scouts|scout/combat]] units recruited from among the Apache people and led by American officers.{{sfn|Utley|2012|p=135}}  These Apache units proved effective in finding the mountain strongholds of the Apache bands, and killing or capturing them.{{sfn|Utley|2012|pp=130, 179, 200}} It was highly unsettling for Geronimo's band to realize their own tribesmen had helped find their hiding places.{{sfn|Utley|2012|pp=178, 179}}  Over time this persistent pursuit by both Mexican and American forces discouraged Geronimo and other similar Apache leaders, and caused a steady and irreplaceable attrition of the members of their bands, which taken all together eroded their will to resist and led to their ultimate capitulation.

Crook was under increased pressure from the government in Washington. He launched a second expedition into Mexico and on January 9, 1886, Crawford located Geronimo and his band. His Indian scouts attacked the next morning and captured the Apache's herd of horses and their camp equipment. The Apaches were demoralized and agreed to negotiate for surrender. Before the negotiations could be concluded, Mexican troops arrived and mistook the Apache scouts for the enemy Apache. The Mexican government had accused the scouts of taking advantage of their position to conduct theft, robbery, and murder in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Geronimo at Work |url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn96060682/1886-04-16/ed-1/seq-3/#date1=1873&amp;sort=date&amp;date2=1922&amp;words=Geronimo&amp;sequence=0&amp;lccn=&amp;index=1&amp;state=&amp;rows=20&amp;ortext=geronimo&amp;proxtext=geronimo&amp;year=&amp;phrasetext=&amp;andtext=&amp;proxValue=&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;page=101 |website=Library of Congress, Chronicling America |publisher=Daily Tombstone epitaph., April 16, 1886, Image 3 |accessdate=September 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They attacked and killed Captain Crawford.

Geronimo, camped on the Mexican side of the border, agreed to Crook's surrender terms. That night, a soldier who sold them whiskey said that his band would be murdered as soon as they crossed the border. Geronimo, Nachite, and 39 of his followers slipped away during the night. Crook exchanged a series of heated telegrams with General [[Philip Sheridan]] defending his men's actions, until on April 1, 1886, he sent a telegram asking Sheridan to relieve him of command, which Sheridan was all too willing to do.&lt;ref name=vaughan/&gt;

Sheridan replaced Crook with General [[Nelson A. Miles]]. In 1886, General Miles selected Captain [[Henry Lawton]] to command B Troop, [[4th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|4th Cavalry]], at [[Fort Huachuca]], and First Lieutenant [[Charles B. Gatewood]], to lead the expedition that brought Geronimo and his followers back to the reservation system for a final time.&lt;ref name="Chiefs"&gt;{{cite book |last=Capps |first=Benjamin |title=The Great Chiefs |publisher=Time-Life Education |year=1975 |page=240 |isbn=978-0-316-84785-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawton was given orders to head up actions south of the U.S.–Mexico boundary, where it was thought that Geronimo and a small band of his followers would take refuge from U.S. authorities.&lt;ref name="Chiefs"/&gt; Lawton was to pursue, subdue, and return Geronimo to the U.S., dead or alive.&lt;ref name="Chiefs"/&gt;

Lawton's official report dated September 9, 1886 sums up the actions of his unit and gives credit to a number of his troopers for their efforts. Geronimo gave Gatewood credit for his decision to surrender as Gatewood was well known to Geronimo, spoke some Apache, and was familiar with and honored their traditions and values. He acknowledged Lawton's tenacity for wearing the Apaches down with constant pursuit. Geronimo and his followers had little or no time to rest or stay in one place. Completely worn out, the little band of Apaches returned to the U.S. with Lawton and officially surrendered to General Miles on September 4, 1886 at [[Skeleton Canyon]], [[Arizona]].&lt;ref name=GeronimoStory&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/B/geronimo/geroni15.htm |title=Geronimo's Story of His Life |accessdate=May 12, 2011 |chapter=In Prison and on the war path | editor-first= S.

It is on display at the [[United States Military Academy]], [[West Point, New York]]. Additionally, he had a [[Colt Single Action Army]] revolver with a nickel finish and ivory stocks bearing the serial number 89524, and a [[Sheffield, England|Sheffield]] [[Bowie knife]] with a dagger type blade and a stag handle made by George Wostenholm in an elaborate silver-studded holster and cartridge belt.

The debate remains as to whether Geronimo surrendered unconditionally. He pleaded in his memoirs that his people who surrendered had been misled, and that his surrender as a war prisoner in front of uncontested witnesses (especially General Stanley) was conditional. General [[Oliver O. Howard]], chief of US Army Division of the Pacific, said on his part that Geronimo's surrender was accepted as that of a dangerous outlaw without condition. Howard's account was contested in front of the [[US Senate]].

Geronimo and other Apaches, including the Apache scouts who had helped the army track him down, were sent as prisoners to Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio Texas. The Army held them there for about six weeks before they were sent to [[Fort Pickens]], in [[Pensacola]], Florida, and his family was sent to [[Fort Marion]] (the Castillo de San Marcos in [[St. Augustine, Florida]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/guis/historyculture/the-apache.htm |work=nps.gov |title=Gulf Islands National Seashore&amp;nbsp;– The Apache (U.S. National Park Service) |accessdate=May 24, 2009 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; This prompt action prevented the [[Arizona]] [[civil authorities]] from intervening to arrest and try Geronimo for the death of the many Americans who had been killed during the previous decades of raiding.{{sfn|Utley|2012|pp=214–220}}{{sfn|Debo|1986|pp=295, 296, 298}}

"In that alien climate," the ''[[Washington Post]]'' reported, "the Apache died 'like flies at frost time.' Businessmen there soon had the idea to have Geronimo serve as a tourist attraction, and hundreds of visitors daily were let into the fort to lay eyes on the 'bloodthirsty' Indian in his cell."&lt;ref name=smithsonian &gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/geronimos-appeal-to-theodore-roosevelt-117859516/ |newspaper=Smithsonian Magazine |date=November 9, 2012|access-date=November 4, 2017 |title=Geronimo’s Appeal to Theodore Roosevelt |quote=Held captive far longer than his surrender agreement called for, the Apache warrior made his case directly to the president |first=Gilbert |last=King}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the POWs were in Florida, the government relocated hundreds of their children from their Arizona reservation to the [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School]] in Pennsylvania. More than a third of the students quickly perished from tuberculosis, "died as though smitten with the plague," the ''Post'' reported.&lt;ref name=smithsonian /&gt;

The Chiricahuas remained at [[Fort Pickens]] in Florida until 1888 when they were relocated to [[Mount Vernon Arsenal|Mt. Vernon Barracks]] in [[Alabama]],{{sfn|Utley|2012|pp=221–254}} where they were reunited with their families. After 1/4 of the population died of [[tuberculosis]],&lt;ref name=smithsonian /&gt; the Chiricahuas, including Geronimo, were relocated to [[Fort Sill, Oklahoma]], in 1894; they built villages scattered around the post based on kindred groups.{{sfn|Debo|1986|p=372}} Geronimo, like other Apaches, was given a plot of land on which he took up farming activities.{{sfn|Debo|1986|pp=374, 376}}

On the train ride to Fort Sill, many tourists wanted a "piece" of Geronimo so they paid 25 cents for a button that he cut off his shirt or a hat he took off his head. As the train would pull into depots along the way, Geronimo would buy more buttons to sew on and more hats to sell.&lt;ref&gt;In Geronimo's Footsteps by Corine Sombrun &amp; Haiyln Geronimo, Skyhorse publishing, Inc., 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1898 Geronimo was part of a Chiricahua delegation from Fort Sill to the [[Trans-Mississippi International Exposition]] in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]. Previous newspaper accounts of the [[Apache Wars]] had impressed the public with Geronimo's name and exploits, and in Omaha he became a star attraction. The Omaha Exposition launched Geronimo to celebrity status, and for the rest of his life he was in demand as an attraction in fairs large and small. The two largest were the [[Pan American Exposition]] at [[Buffalo, New York]], in 1901, and the [[St. Louis World’s Fair]] in 1904. Under Army guard, Geronimo dressed in traditional clothing and posed for photographs and sold his crafts.{{sfn|Utley|2012|p=256}}

After the fair, [[Pawnee Bill]]’s Wild West Show brokered an agreement with the government to have Geronimo join the show, again under Army guard. The Indians in Pawnee Bill’s show were depicted as "lying, thieving, treacherous, murderous" monsters who had killed hundreds of men, women and children and would think nothing of taking a scalp from any member of the audience, given the chance.  Visitors came to see how the "savage" had been "tamed," and they paid Geronimo to take a button from the coat of the vicious Apache "chief." (Geronimo was not a chief.) The shows put a good deal of money in his pockets and allowed him to travel, though never without government guards.&lt;ref name=smithsonian /&gt;

In President [[Teddy Roosevelt]]'s 1905 Inaugural Parade Geronimo rode horseback down Pennsylvania Avenue with five real Indian chiefs, who wore full headgear and painted faces. The intent, one newspaper stated, was to show Americans "that they have buried the hatchet forever."&lt;ref name=smithsonian /&gt; They created a sensation and brought the crowds along the parade route to their feet.{{sfn|Utley|2012|pp=257–258}}  Later that same week Geronimo met with the President and made a moving request for the Chiricahuas at  Fort Sill to be relieved of their status as prisoners of war, and allowed to return to their homeland in Arizona. President Roosevelt refused, referring to the continuing animosity in Arizona for the deaths of civilian men, women, and children associated with Geronimo's raids during the prolonged [[Apache Wars]].{{sfn|Debo|1986|p=421}}{{sfn|Utley|2012|pp=254–259}} Through an interpreter, Roosevelt told Geronimo that the Indian had a "bad heart."  "You killed many of my people; you burned villages…and were not good Indians."  The president would have to wait a while "and see how you and your people act" on their reservation.&lt;ref name=smithsonian /&gt;

In 1905, Geronimo agreed to tell his story to S. M. Barrett, Superintendent of Education in [[Lawton, Oklahoma]]. Barrett had to appeal to President Roosevelt to gain permission to publish the book. Geronimo came to each interview knowing exactly what he wanted to say. He refused to answer questions or alter his narrative. Barrett did not seem to take many liberties with Geronimo's story as translated by Asa Daklugie. Frederick Turner re-edited this autobiography by removing some of Barrett's footnotes and writing an introduction for the non-Apache readers. Turner notes the book is in the style of an Apache reciting part of his oral history.&lt;ref name="Turner"&gt;Barrett, Stephen Melvil and Turner, Frederick W.

Reportedly inspired by the film [[Geronimo (1939 film)|''Geronimo'']] (1939), US Army paratroopers testing the practice of parachuting from planes began a tradition of shouting, "[[Geronimo (exclamation)|Geronimo!]]", to show they have no fear of jumping out of an airplane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2011/01/where-the-tradition-of-yelling-geronimo-when-jumping-out-of-a-plane-came-from/|website=Today I Found Out: Feed Your Brain|title= WHERE THE TRADITION OF YELLING "GERONIMO" WHEN JUMPING OUT OF A PLANE CAME FROM |date=January 20, 2011|author=Hiskey, Daven }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Native American-based traditions were also adopted in WWII, such as "Mohawk" haircuts, face paint, and sporting spears on their unit patches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Chuck |last=Anderson |url=http://www.b-westerns.com/geronimo.htm |title=Geronimo yell of World War II paratroopers |website=B-westerns.com |accessdate=February 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hafsa Sultan'''&lt;ref&gt;Though generally known as "Hafsa Sultan", she is sometimes incidentally referred to as "Ayşe Hafsa Sultan" by some authors, without indication of the origin of this name. Name "Hafsa" referred to [[Muhammad]]'s wive [[Hafsa bint Umar|Hafsa]] (حفصة) daughter of [[Umar|Umar ibn Al Kattab]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-ota|حفصه سلطان}}&amp;lrm;; died 19 March 1534) was the wife of [[Selim I]] and the first [[valide sultan]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] as the mother of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]. Hence, the marriage between Selim I and Hafsa Sultan was the last marriage between an Ottoman sultan and a member of a neighboring [[Muslim]] royal family. During the period between her son's enthronement in 1520 and her death in 1534, she was one of the most influential persons in the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Pietro Bragadin, [[Venetian Republic]]'s ambassador in the early years of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]'s reign notes "a very beautiful woman of 48, for whom the sultan bears great reverence and love..." {{cite book | title = The Imperial Harem : Women and Sovereignty in the Ottoman Empire  p. 62 {{ISBN|0-19-508677-5}}|author= Leslie Peirce|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year= 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The traditional view of Hafsa Sultan's origins is that she was the daughter of [[Meñli I Giray]], the [[khan (title)|khan]] of the [[Crimean Tatars]]. Several notable historians have supported this view, including [[Brian Glyn Williams]],&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{citation |last= Glyn Williams|first=Brian|year=2001|title=The Crimean Tatars: The Diaspora Experience and the Forging of a Nation|page=56|publisher=[[Brill Publishers|BRILL]]|isbn=0295801492|quote=Ottoman princes, such as the future Ottoman Sultans Selim I (who married Mengli Giray Khan's daughter, Hafsa Hatun...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reşat Kasaba claims that the marriage between Selim I and Hafsa Sultan was the "last marriage between an Ottoman sultan and a member of a neighboring Muslim royal family".&lt;ref name=Kasaba&gt;{{citation |last=Kasaba|first=Resat|year=2011|title=A Moveable Empire: Ottoman Nomads, Migrants, and Refugees|page=44|publisher=[[University of Washington Press]]|isbn=0295801492|quote=The last marriage between an Ottoman sultan and a member of a neighboring Muslim royal family was the one between Selim I and Hafsa Sultan, the daughter of the Crimean ruler Mengli Giray Khan.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Esin Atıl, however, states that whilst some historians state that she was the daughter of Giray, others have mentioned that the Crimean princess named "Ayse" was another one of Selim I's wives and that "Hafsa" may have been of slave origin.&lt;ref name=Atıl&gt;{{citation |last=Atıl|first=Esin

==Life==
[[File:AyseHafsaSultanHospice&amp;MentalHospital 16thcentury ManisaTurkey.jpg|thumb|left|220px|The [[külliye]] built on the orders of Hafsa Sultan in Manisa]]
Having resided in the city of [[Manisa]] in western [[Turkey]] with her son, who administered the surrounding region between 1513 and 1520, the town being one of the traditional residences for Ottoman [[crown prince]]s ([[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|şehzade]]) in apprenticeship for future power, Hafsa Sultan is the initiator of the Manisa's "Mesir Festival", a local tradition still continued today. She also had a large complex built in the city consisting of a mosque, a primary school, a college and a hospice.

She was also the first Ottoman imperial women who held title "sultan" after her given name, replacing title "hatun". This usage reflected the Ottoman conception of sovereign power as "family prerogative".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Imperial Harem: Women and Sovereignty in the Ottoman Empire|last = Peirce|first = Leslie P.|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1993|isbn = 0-19-508677-5|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}} Consequently, the title valide hatun (title for living mother of the reigning Ottoman sultan before 16th century) also turned into valide sultan, made Hafsa the first [[valide sultan]]. Her period signalled the shifting status of the sultan's mother and her increased share in power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Constructing Ottoman beneficence: An imperial soup kitchen in [[Jerusalem]] p. 90 {{ISBN|0-7914-5351-0}}|author= Amy Singer|publisher=[[State University of New York Press]]|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After the birth of her son [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman]], born on 6 November 1494 in [[Trabzon]], she gave birth to four daughters: [[Hatice Sultan (daughter of Selim I)|Hatice]], [[Fatma Sultan (daughter of Selim I)|Fatma]], [[Beyhan Sultan (daughter of Selim I)|Beyhan]] and Hafsa.

She was the most powerful woman of the Ottoman Empire during her son's reign.

Hafsa Sultan died in March 1534 and was buried near her husband in a [[mausoleum]] behind the [[qiblah]] wall of [[Yavuz Selim Mosque]], in [[Fatih]], [[Istanbul]]. The mausoleum was largely destroyed in an earthquake in 1884, a reconstruction effort started in the 1900s (decade) having been left discontinued, and her tomb today is much simpler than it was built originally.

'''Heinrich Conried''' (September 3, 1855 – April 27, 1909) was a theatrical manager and director of the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author= |encyclopedia =The Cyclopædia of American Biography |title=[[s:The Cyclopædia of American Biography/Conried, Heinrich|Heinrich Conried]]  |year=1918 |publisher= |page= |quote= | url= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He was born on September 3, 1855 in [[Bielsko-Biała|Bielitz]], [[Austrian Silesia]] (now Poland). His father was a weaver of Jewish origin. He received his education at the [[Realschule]] in [[Vienna]]. Early on, he was an actor in at the [[Burgtheater]] in Vienna. Only 21 years old he became manager of the failed [[Bremen|Bremer]] Stadttheater. His success in rescuing the theater not only moved the Senate of the city to pass a resolution thanking him, but also brought him to the attention of [[Adolf Neuendorff]], who was the manager of the [[Germania Theatre]] in New York. On invitation of Neuendorff Conried moved in 1878 to New York City, where he became chief stage manager of the Germania Theatre. In 1881 he moved to the [[Bowery Theatre|Thalia Theatre]] as artistic manager and in 1882 he became artistic manager of the [[New York Concert Company]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

In 1893 he assumed the management of the [[Irving Place Theatre]]. In 1903, he succeeded [[Maurice Grau]] as director of the Metropolitan Opera until 1908. His first season at the Met was notable through the first production of ''[[Parsifal]]'' outside of [[Bayreuth]], against the wishes of [[Cosima Wagner]], who went to court but failed in her attempt to forbid the production. By December 31, 1913, when the copyright of ''Parsifal'' expired, the work had been represented 43 times at the Metropolitan Opera. [[Enrico Caruso]], who until then had refused all offers to come to America, was persuaded by Conried to come to New York and sing at the Met. Soon after he had become director of the Metropolitan Opera, he conceived the [[Century Theatre (New York City)|New Theatre]].

On May 1, 1908 he retired from the Metropolitan Opera House due to his poor health. Immediately afterwards he voyaged to Europe. He died on April 27, 1909 in the Hotel Meranerhof in the city of Meran from an apoplectic stroke in the presence of his wife and sister.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |author= |agency= |title=Heinrich Conried Dies In Austria.

'''Helio Koa'eloa''' (ca. 1815–1846), was a [[Hawaii]]an [[Catholic]] lay [[missionary]] called as the "Apostle of Maui" for converting about 4,000 natives to the Catholic faith. Landmarks and memorials were dedicated to him at Maui. A cross (called Hâna cross) was erected in Wailua valley in his memory in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/8607645/helio-koaeloa|title=Helio Koaeloa (1815-1848)|website=findagrave.com|date=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/ajg7678.0001.001.umich.edu?q=Helio+Koaeloa|title=History of the Catholic Mission in the Hawaiin Islands|publisher=archive.org|date=|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Koa'eloa was born in 1815 on [[Wailua, Maui County, Hawaii|Wailua]] Valley, [[Maui]], Hawaii. He was living in [[Hāna]] when he heard about the arrival of a new religion, [[Catholicism]]. He paddled a [[canoe]] to [[Honolulu]] to be personally instructed in the faith and to join the church. Then he returned to Maui and instructed over 4,000 people for the Catholic Mission. His boundless enthusiasm for the promotion of the Catholic faith earned him the title "Apostle of Maui". Before the Catholic Mission was properly established in Maui, Koa'eloa died in 1848 and was buried in Wailua, the valley of his birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=Nrw8rIO1dlQC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=helio+koaeloa&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aC7GUiqqri&amp;sig=JVrNQnSzJ5RxRnXljlWr1AOFv_I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiIyYbahNLaAhXCmZQKHShEC64Q6AEIOzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=helio%20koaeloa&amp;f=false|title=The Beaches of Maui County by John R.

''Vintage: The Story of Wine'', pg 284, Simon and Schuster 1989. {{ISBN|0-671-68702-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
He was born the son of Guy F. Johnson and Grace Kittel, educated at [[Rugby School]] and read [[English studies|English]] at [[King's College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref name= WW&gt;{{cite book|title=The International Who's Who 2004|first= Europa|last= Publications| page=824}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Johnson became a member of the [[Cambridge University Wine Society|Cambridge University Wine and Food Society]] while an undergraduate in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=OCW-hj/&gt; On describing his introduction to wine-tasting Johnson has recalled:
{{quote|...my room-mate Adrian Cowell, committee member of the [[Cambridge University Wine Society|University Wine &amp; Food Society]] came in after dinner with two glasses and said, "Come on, Hugh, are they the same? Or different?" Both were, I am sure, red Burgundy, but one was magic and one was ordinary. This caught my imagination. It was my [[Conversion of Paul|Damascene moment]].&lt;ref name=ind-hj/&gt;&lt;ref name="cam"&gt;{{cite news |title = University library plans new expansion |work = Cam |publisher = [[University of Cambridge]] Development Office |pages = 45–46 |volume = No 47, Lent Term 2006 |accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Johnson has been writing about wine since 1960, was taken on as a feature writer for [[Condé Nast Publications]] upon graduation,&lt;ref name=OCW-hj/&gt; and started work on ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' and ''[[House &amp; Garden (magazine)|House &amp; Garden]] '', becoming in 1962 editor of ''Wine &amp; Food'' and in the same year wine correspondent of ''The Sunday Times'', of which in 1967 he became Travel Editor. From 1968 to 1970 he edited ''Queen'' magazine in succession to [[Jocelyn Stevens]].&lt;ref name=wd-hj&gt;{{cite web|last= Kissack |first= Chris, thewinedoctor.com |url= http://www.thewinedoctor.com/otherresources/johnson.shtml |title= Wine Books: Hugh Johnson }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has published a wide array of books, starting with the publication of ''Wine'' in 1966. ''[[The World Atlas of Wine]]'' (1971) was considered the first serious attempt to map the world's wine regions, described by the director of the [[Institut National des Appellations d'Origine|INAO]] as "a major event in wine literature".&lt;ref name=OCW-hj/&gt;

Since its launch in 1973 Johnson has been President of the Sunday Times Wine Club, part of Laithwaites, now the world's largest mail-order wine merchant. From 1986 to 2001 he was a Director of the Bordeaux First Growth Chateau Latour and in 1990 was a co-founder of the Royal Tokaji Wine Company in an attempt to rebuild the foundering Tokaji industry after Communism. In 1986 he started the Hugh Johnson Collection, which sold (until 2010) wine glasses and other artefacts related to wine, mainly in the Far East, with a shop in St James's Street, London.

His book ''Vintage: The Story of Wine'', an authoritative 500-page compendium, was first published in 1989 by Octopus, and re-edited in 2004 as a fully illustrated edition published by Mitchell Beazley. It also was made into a 13-part TV series for Channel 4 and Boston P.B.S., first airing in 1989. Since 1977 he has compiled his annual ''Pocket Wine Book'', selling many million copies in up to 14 languages.

In 1973 Johnson wrote ''The International Book of Trees''. In 1975 he became Editorial Director of the journal of the Royal Horticultural Society (''The Garde''n) and its columnist, "Tradescant". "Trad's Diary", now in its 37th year, appears online and in ''Hortus'' magazine. In 1979 he published The Principles of Gardening and in 2010 a new rewritten edition of ''Trees''. "Trad's Diary" has twice been anthologised, as ''Hugh Johnson on Gardening'' (1993) and ''Hugh Johnson in the Garden'' (2009).

He was selected ''Decanter'' Man of the Year in 1995, and was promoted Officer in the French Order Nationale du Mérite in 2004 and Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2007 "for services to wine-making and horticulture". He was awarded the [[Veitch Memorial Medal]] of the Royal Horticultural Society in 2000.&lt;ref name= WW/&gt;

Johnson is known as one of the wine world's most vocal opponents to awarding numerical scores to wine.&lt;ref name=OCW-hj/&gt; In the autobiography ''A Life Uncorked'', he also expressed regret over the wine critic [[Robert M. Parker, Jr.|Robert Parker]]'s influence on the world of wine, which has in his view moved winemaking in many regions towards a more uniform, bigger and richer style.&lt;ref name=wd-hj/&gt; In 2005 Johnson stated, "Imperial hegemony lives in Washington and the dictator of taste in Baltimore".&lt;small&gt;{{Ref_label|A|a|none}}&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref name=deca06&gt;{{cite web| last = Styles | first = Oliver, ''Decanter.com'' | title = Parker: I'm targeted and misunderstood | date = 23 March 2006 | page = 8 | url = http://www.decanter.com/news/82062.html | accessdate = 1 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Igor Anvar Kufayev''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|uː|f|ə|j|ɛ|v}} ({{lang-rus|И́горь Анва́р Kу́фаев|p=ˈiɡərʲ ɐnˈvar ˈkufəɪf}}; born January 5, 1966), is a [[Russian British]] [[artist]], [[yogi]] and spiritual teacher. Also known as '[[Vamadeva]]' ([[Sanskrit]]), which means "preserving aspect of [[Shiva]] in his peaceful, graceful and poetic form".

==Early years==
Igor Kufayev was born in [[Tashkent]], Uzbekistan. In his childhood he had many spiritual experiences associated with awakening of [[Kundalini energy|Kundalini]]. Classically trained in art from an early age he attended a private studio of a martial artist and painter Shamil Rakhimov, a place of underground meetings between liberal thinkers, poets and painters. The violent death of his mentor lead to young Igor's decision to become an artist. Kufayev  received his formal education at the Art College in Tashkent, and after two years of compulsory military service, resumed his studies at the Theater and Art Institute, at the department of Mural painting. In 1988 he was accepted as a student of a second year to the Academy of Arts (now [[Imperial Academy of Arts]]) in [[St Petersburg, Russia]]. Independently of his official program, he studied and painted directly from the masterpieces of western art, in the [[Hermitage Museum]].

==Artistic career==

[[File:Purusha Tondo.pdf|thumb|Igor Kufayev, ''[[Purusha]]'', 1995, tondo, oil on canvas, diameter 80 cm, London, Private Collection]]

In 1990 Kufayev left Russia and moved to [[Warsaw, Poland]]. This was a formative time. An encounter with the art critic Andrzej Matynia lead to Kufayev's first solo exhibition, ''Eternal Compromise''&lt;ref&gt;''Eternal Compromise''&amp;nbsp;– title of the show [http://www.igorkufayev.com/theme1.html igorkufayev.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517191347/http://www.igorkufayev.com/theme1.html |date=2008-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; at the Monetti Gallery, Warsaw. Igor was invited to take part in ''The Meeting of Sacred Images'', at the National Museum of Ethnography in Warsaw, with his triptych ''Compromise'',&lt;ref&gt;''Compromise'' triptych [http://www.igorkufayev.com/theme1_files/a4w-triptix.html igorkufayev.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209163138/http://www.igorkufayev.com/theme1_files/a4w-triptix.html |date=2012-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; alongside such [[Icon]]s as the [[Black Madonna of Częstochowa]] and Mexican [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]] as well as modern masters as [[Christian Boltanski]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

He moved to London in August 1991, the same year his six year old daughter from his first marriage died in a road accident. He remained in a prolonged period of grief unable to paint until he was able to come to terms with the personal tragedy and embarked on the series of dramatic paintings. The turning point came in 1994, on the wake of the one-man exhibition, entitled ''Burnt Earth''&lt;ref&gt;''Burnt Earth''&amp;nbsp;– title of the show [http://www.igorkufayev.com/theme2.html igorkufayev.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426050856/http://www.igorkufayev.com/theme2.html |date=2012-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and dedicated to the memory of his daughter Laura, he put his name on the map of London's art scene as one of the most promising young painters. In less than a decade Kufayev managed to establish himself as a successful artist, and opened his own studio in London where he held private views of his work annually. The ''Zauber'' tondo was created in response to the commission Igor Kufayev received from [[Elton John AIDS Foundation]], which was to accompany the performance of Mozart's opera ''[[Die Zauberflote]]'' at [[Christie's]] head-quarters at [[St James's]] in London, in the autumn of 1995. A few months later, in January 1996 he was granted British Citizenship.

The following series of four tondos under the same title, ''Zauber''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.igorkufayev.com/theme4_files/tondas.html ''Zauber Series'']&lt;/ref&gt; was an achievement which took two years to complete (1995–1997).

Kufayev traveled widely visiting major art-fairs around Europe, as well as painting in France and Italy. Despite his unquestionable success he was deeply disillusioned about the state of art and all its prevalent trends.

{{quote |text= Kufayev is one of a rare breed of artists who believe in going back to go forward... Born in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, in 1966, he studied at the Tashkent School of Art, where his early love of drawing was honed and refined for four years. He had, in fact, been drawing professionally since the age of 12, and recognized as something of a prodigy... His zeal to perfect drawing technique led him to move to St Petersburg and The Academy of Fine Art and, independently of his studies, he began making numerous copies of the great Western masterpieces hanging in The Hermitage... The whole of his show, ''Burnt Earth'', is redolent of archeological finds&amp;nbsp;– the secrets masquerading as treasures only a few feet under the surface. Blood and earth are unified in Kufayev's vision, emphasising our origins and our certain end.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art--burnt-offerings-robin-dutt-discovers-an-eastern-attitude-to-life-mortality-and-tragedy-as-seen-through-the-eyes-of-the-uzbek-artist-igor-kufayev-1410879.html ART / Burnt offerings: Robin Dutt, ''The Independent'', July 1, 1994, London]&lt;/ref&gt; |sign= Robin Dutt, writer and art journalist, [[The Independent]]}}

==Inner transformation==

An early interest towards spirituality lead to his practice of [[Yoga]] with initiation in 1996 to [[Transcendental Meditation]], founded by [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]]. He immerses himself in the study of diverse spiritual traditions with special emphasis on [[Indian Philosophy]], [[Sufi]] and [[Zen]]. At the age of thirty six Igor had undergone a radical transformation of consciousness&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seva.ru/oborot/guests/?id=646 Сева Новгородцев, ''Севаоборот''&amp;nbsp;– Igor Kufayev, interview for BBC Russian Service, 21.10.2006]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://batgap.com/igor-kufayev/ Buddha at the Gas Pump&amp;nbsp;– ''Interviews with 'Ordinary' Spiritually Awakened People'' (1st interview)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://conscious.tv/nonduality.html?bcpid=45947084001&amp;bclid=46629186001&amp;bctid=2673988603001;– Conscious TV Interview - ''Igor Kufayev -  The Impact Of Awakening'' (1st interview)]&lt;/ref&gt; which subsequently blossomed into spontaneous unfoldment of Grace.

He abandoned his art career and for the next five years he continued long hours of meditation, integrating expanded state of awareness throughout his daily activities. During that time he discovered the teachings of [[Muktananda|Swami Muktananda]] which led him to the tradition of [[Kashmir Shaivism]]. Its 'transcendental physicalism' appealed to his down to earth, creative sensibility, unique to that tradition's doctrine of ''Spanda'' ([[Sanskrit]]: "throb, vibration") which had been verified by direct experience, in ''perceiving the World as a Throb of Pure Consciousness in the Heart of his own''.

In October 2006, in an interview with [[Seva Novgorodsev]] for the [[BBC Russian Service]], Kufayev talked about his years as an artist and the decision to leave painting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seva.ru/oborot/guests/?id=646 Сева Новгородцев, ''Севаоборот''&amp;nbsp;– Igor Kufayev, interview for BBC Russian Service, 21.10.2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy and Teaching==

[[File:Sangha2_with_Igor_Kufayev,_Gut_Saunstorf,_Germany,_2017.jpg|thumb|Igor Kufayev leading the retreat at Gut Saunstorf, Germany, August 2017]]

Since 2002 Kufayev has been sharing his insights into the nature of Being.&lt;ref&gt;[http://batgap.com/igor-kufayev-2/ Buddha at the Gas Pump&amp;nbsp;– ''Interviews with 'Ordinary' Spiritually Awakened People'' (2nd interview)]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite many requests, he declined to place himself in the role of a teacher until he made the conscious decision to give his full time to teaching in February 2008. Since 2012 he has offered online webinars and in-person gatherings and retreats worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.igorkufayev.com/darshan|title=Igor Kufayev Darshans}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.igorkufayev.com/events|title=Igor Kufayev Events}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his video-podcasts and recorded gatherings are freely available on his [[YouTube]] channel.

Although his initial spiritual training occurred in the Transcendental Meditation program, Igor now teaches mainly using the methodologies of Tantric [[Kashmir Shaivism]], stating that the doctrines of Kashmir Shaivism most closely match his direct experience of spiritual transformation and the nature of reality. However, Igor has studied widely, and draws from many other traditions such as Sufi and Zen. He remains elusive to categorization, maintaining that:

{{quote |text=Abiding in a state of spontaneous absorption transcends the boundaries of any given truth based on an intellectual grasp of ultimate reality...|sign=}}

Igor often refers to his teaching as “The Path of the Heart,” and explains that it is a non-intellectual and direct cognition of the essence of one’s reality — one which transcends any tradition, because by definition it cannot be contained by a set of doctrines. Here, knowledge is not mental or intellectual, nor spoken of in terms of acquisition; it is simple direct knowingness itself — beyond concepts and precepts, understanding, and language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Yoga Aktuell|issue=102|date=January 2017|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.igorkufayev.com/spontaneous-yoga|title=Spontaneous Yoga ~ Touched by Grace}}&lt;/ref&gt; Igor explains this:

{{quote |text=So when I said I don’t belong to any tradition, I want to make one little adjustment to that. I do belong to a tradition and that is the tradition which could be called simply, “the heart.” And don’t try to decipher it again through any “isms” or spiritual traditions, because the experience of the heart transcends all traditions. And the time has come when we have to transcend those traditions that calcify to themselves...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.igorkufayev.com/gnosis|title=Igor Kufayev Gnosis}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Central to Igor's teaching methodology is the transmission of spiritual energy, which occurs primarily during in-person events. He has commented that "the real work happens at the immersions — the real work happens in these specifically created containers." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10MnP97xsJc|time=40s|title="What Happens at Your Retreats That's Not Available Online...?"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants at his immersions commonly experience spontaneous, involuntary [[kriyas]], in the form of [[asanas]], [[pranayama]], [[glossolalia]], and vocal [[Harmonization|harmonizing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHUdJO2Mt08|title= SONG OF THE DEVI ~ Involuntary Vocalizations}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the unusual but constant features of Igor's live events is spontaneous vocalization and overtoning by the participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDkZ_jY1rWY|title=Spontaneous Choir of The Holy Spirit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Igor states that these phenomena are both a result of release of stress, as well as the "Song of the Goddess" — literally a manifestation of [[Shakti]] through a group of people in meditative trance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of4K3Ntci6M|title=Freiburg Darshan: Dynamic Aspects of Meditation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Participants at Igor's retreats have reported experiencing profound states of expansion, higher states of consciousness, permanent relief from depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_V2X0sK-pY|title= Entering the Heart – The Work of Igor Kufayev (Documentary)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fxSH4aKSYE|title=Expansion &amp; Deepening – Immersion with Igor Kufayev}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Igor emphasizes the psycho-physiological aspects of the awakening process, stressing the importance of the physical transformation of the nervous system. He states that the physiology acts as a support for individual consciousness to mature into what is often termed as "enlightenment". He also stresses the necessity of sitting meditation in spiritual practice, stating that while other methodologies may give peak experiences, it is only in sitting meditation that integration takes place, which is required for a permanent shift in consciousness.

In 2014, Igor consecrated the Flowing Wakefulness Fellowship, with a stated mission to serve "as a platform for revealing and realizing possibilities for a Consciousness-based culture, aimed at the recognition, development and actualization of the fullest potential present in human birth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.igorkufayev.com/fellowship|title=Flowing Wakefulness Fellowship}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013 Igor Kufayev was interviewed for the 'Conscious TV' (London based Channel), where he shared his views on the subtleties of awakening process based on biographical events of his life,&lt;ref&gt;[http://conscious.tv/nonduality.html?bcpid=45947084001&amp;bclid=46629186001&amp;bctid=2673988603001;– Conscious TV Interview - ''Igor Kufayev -  The Impact Of Awakening'' (1st interview)]&lt;/ref&gt; and addressed the unifying complexity of self-realization and integration of higher states  of awareness as seen from the biological perspective of human consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conscious.tv/nonduality.html?bcpid=45947084001&amp;bclid=46629186001&amp;bctid=2674126409001;– Conscious TV Interview - ''Igor Kufayev -  Flowing Wakefulness'' (2nd interview)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Private life==
Igor now lives with his partner and their two small children in [[Mallorca]], [[Balearic Islands]], [[Spain]]. In 2006 he moved back to Uzbekistan and lived in his birth city of Tashkent for almost four years. Between April 2011 and December 2012 he and his family were traveling in Central America with the base in [[Costa Rica]], followed by spending nine months, until September 2013, in [[Mallorca]]
Kufayev has a grown-up daughter from a previous relationship who lives in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]].

==Early career==
While at Oxford, Nkangi  studied law at Lincoln’s Inn of Courts in London, then returned to Uganda in 1960 where he set up his law practice. He also joined pre-independence Ugandan politics. He formed a political party called the "United Party"; later called the "United National Party" (UNP). In 1962, he abandoned the UNP and joined the [[Kabaka Yekka]] (KY) political party. He was elected to represent Masaka East Constituency in the [[Parliament of Uganda|Ugandan Parliament]], in May 1962. Following independence on 9 October 1962, Nkangi served as minister without portfolio in the ministry of economic affairs. Then as the commerce and industry minister. On 17 August 1964, Nkangi, at age 33 years and a bachelor, was elected Buganda’s katikkiro by the Lukiiko in a landslide. &lt;ref name="Story"/&gt; Looking back, Nkangi says his humble beginnings must have marketed him. "The Kabaka did not know me personally.&lt;ref name="Story" /&gt;

Trouble started in early 1966. On 15 April 1966, the 1962 Uganda constitution was abrogated during a parliamentary session in which [[Milton Obote]], the then prime mister, was surrounded by [[Uganda Army]] troops. The Buganda [[lukiiko]] (parliament) passed a resolution to eject the central government from Buganda; essentially declaring Buganda's [[secession]] from Uganda. In response, Obote ordered [[Idi Amin]], the army commander at the time to attack the Kabaka's palace at [[Mengo, Uganda| Mengo]]. The assault came on 24 May 1966. Both Muteesa and Nkangi fled to the [[United Kingdom]]. Nkangi went via [[Nairobi]], in [[Kenya]]. In 1967, Obote abolished the cultural kingdoms and put a new constitution in place. &lt;ref name="Mem"/&gt; &lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Story"/&gt;

==Exile==
While in exile, he was able to find work as a [[research fellow]] at [[Lancaster University]].&lt;ref name="Mem"/&gt; &lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Story"/&gt; Also while there, he was able to witness the Kabaka's written desire to have his son Ronald Muwenda Mutebi succeed the Buganda throne, when that time came. After Muteesa passed away on 21 November 1969, Mayanja Nkangi, in his capacity as Katikkiro, proclaimed the death, as is the custom. He returned to Uganda in April to arrange and partly oversee the deceased king's funereal in April 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|location=Kampala| url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/artsculture/Reviews/60-years-in-the-life-of-a-Kabaka/691232-2683592-10k6x7z/index.html | title=60 years in the life of a Kabaka |date=13 April 2015 |accessdate=13 July 2017 |last=Nampewo |
first=Angela |newspaper=[[Daily Monitor]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==After exile==
Following the removal of the Obote I regime in 1971, Nkangi returned to Uganda and re-opened his law practice. Although Amin spied on him, he generally left him alone, once he learnt that Nkangi had no plans to undermine his government.&lt;ref name="Story"/&gt; Following the overthrow of Idi Amin in 1979, Nkonge formed the [[Conservative Party (Uganda)]].&lt;ref name="Mem"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Story"/&gt;

When the Obote II government (1980 - 1985) was overthrown by the military junta led by [[Tito Okello|Tito Okello Lutwa]], Nkangi was appointed [[Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development (Uganda)|minister of labour]], serving in that capacity from August 1985 until January 1986.&lt;ref name="Story"/&gt;

Under the [[National Resistance Movement]] administration, led by [[Yoweri Museveni]], Nkangi served as [[Ministry of Education and Sports (Uganda)|minister of education]], minister of planning, [[Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development (Uganda)|minister of finance]] and [[Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs (Uganda)|ministry of justice]]. His tenure in Museveni's cabinet lasted from 1986 until 2001. After his retirement from cabinet, he was appointed chairman of the Uganda Land Commission, serving in that capacity from 2002 until 2012.&lt;ref name="Mem"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Story"/&gt;

In 2010, he was appointed Chairman of the Uganda Land Commission, which he held from 2010 until 2013.&lt;ref name=ntv/&gt; In later life, he wrote an [[autobiography]], titled "Out of Empire into Servitude."&lt;ref name=ntv/&gt;

==Other considerations==
During his tenure as the minister of education (1986 - 1989), he oversaw the creation of [[Kyambogo University]]. While he served as the minister of planning (1989 - 1982), he oversaw the creation of the [[Uganda Investment Authority]].&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt;

==Death==
He died on 6 March 2017 at [[Nakasero Hospital]] where he had been hospitalized since February 2017, at the age of 85.&lt;ref name=parlug/&gt; The cause of death was reported to be [[pneumonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redpepper.co.ug/veteran-politician-mayanja-nkangi-is-dead/ | title=Veteran Politician, Mayanja Nkangi is Dead |accessdate=13 July 2017 |date=6 March 2017 | first=Serestino | last=Tusingwire |newspaper=[[Red Pepper (newspaper)|Red Pepper]] | location=Mukono}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried on 10 March 2017 at his ancestral home in Kalungu District.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2573">'''Joseph Dugas''' (1714 &amp;ndash; January 11, 1779) was a merchant, [[privateer]] and militia officer of [[Acadian]] descent.&lt;ref name=cdob/&gt;

==Early life==
The son of Joseph Dugas and Marguerite Richard, he was born in [[Grand-Pré, Nova Scotia]] and came to [[Île-Royale (New France)|Île-Royale]] (later [[Cape Breton Island]]) with his family soon afterwards. 

==Adult life==
In 1729, he was commander of the ''Nouveau Commerçant'', a ship involved in the trade between [[Louisbourg]] and [[Isle Saint-Jean]] and supplied the garrison at Louisbourg with firewood. In 1737, with two partners, he was given a charter for three years to supply the town and garrison at Louisbourg with fresh beef. Dugas continued to supply the garrison until 1745. After his ship was plundered at [[Tatamagouche]], he retired to Minas. Dugas moved to [[Port-Toulouse]] after Île-Royale was returned to France at the end of the [[War of the Austrian Succession]]. After the second fall of Louisbourg in 1758, Dugas fled to Quebec where he was commissioned as a privateer. By winter 1760, he was a major in the militia based in the [[Chaleur Bay|Baie des Chaleurs]] area. He was captured by British Captain Roderick MacKenzie and sent to [[Fort Beauséjour|Fort Cumberland]] and then [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]]. He escaped the following year, going to [[Guysborough, Nova Scotia|Chedabouctou]].&lt;ref name=cdob&gt;{{cite DCB |ID=1867 |last=Pothier |first=Bernard |volume=4 |name=Joseph Dugas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years later, Dugas was living in [[Miquelon-Langlade|Miquelon]]. Because of French policy, he left there for [[Saint-Malo]] but then was forced to return. In 1768, the British captured [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]] and deported the inhabitants to France. Dugas died at [[Saint-Servan]] in January the following year.&lt;ref name=cdob/&gt;Ad

==Personal life==
He was married twice: first to Marguerite, the daughter of [[Joseph Leblanc dit Le Maigre|Joseph Leblanc]], and then to Louise Arseneau in 1762.&lt;ref name=cdob/&gt;

His sister [[Jeanne Dugas|Jeanne]] was named a Person of National Historic Significance by the Canadian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.capebretonpost.com/Living/2016-03-01/article-4452560/Cape-Bretoner-named-nationally-significant-person-after-200-years/1 |title=Cape Bretoner named nationally significant person after 200 years |newspaper=Cape Breton Post |date=March 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marion Ironquill Meadmore''' (born 1936) [[Ojibwe|Ojibwa]]-[[Cree]] Canadian was the first woman of the [[First Nations]] to attain a law degree in Canada. She founded the first Indian and Métis Friendship Centre in Canada to assist indigenous people who had relocated to urban areas with adjustments to their new communities. She edited the native newspaper ''The Prairie Call'', bringing cultural events as well as socio-economic challenges into discussion for native communities. She was the only woman on the Temporary Committee of the National Indian Council, which would later become the [[Assembly of First Nations]], and would become the secretary-treasurer of the organization when it was formalized. She was one of the women involved in the launch of the Kinew Housing project, to bring affordable, safe housing to indigenous urban dwellers and a founder of the [[Indigenous Bar Association of Canada]]. She has received the [[Order of Canada]] as well as many other honors for her activism on behalf of indigenous people. She was a founder and currently serves on the [[National Indigenous Council of Elders]].

==Early life==
Marion Ironquill was born in 1936 on the [[List of Indian reserves in Saskatchewan#P|Peepeekisis First Nation Reserve]] near [[Balcarres, Saskatchewan]], Canada to Helen and Joseph Ironquill. Her mother was of [[Cree]] heritage and her father was [[Ojibwe|Ojibwa]]. She grew up on her family's farm and attended school ten months of the year at a residential school twelve miles away because there was no school available locally.{{sfn|Chalmers-Brooks|2015|p=14}} She graduated from [[Birtle, Manitoba#Facilities and tourism|Birtle Collegeate]],{{sfn|''The Birtle Eye-Witness''|1985|p=4}} a [[Parochial school|parochial institution]] which left her with a feeling that she did not belong in either the aboriginal world or the non-native world.{{sfn|The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada|2015|p=373}} At the age of 16, she enrolled in pre-med courses at the [[University of Manitoba]] in [[Winnipeg]]. After two years of science studies in 1954, Ironquill left school to marry [[Ron Meadmore|Ronald Hector Meadmore]],{{sfn|''The Montreal Gazette''|1986|p=B-8}} who would go on to earn fame in the [[Canadian Football League]]. The couple had three children,{{sfn|Goldsborough|2013}} Glen, Neil and Jim.{{sfn|''The Ottawa Citizen''|1970|p=29}} For nearly twenty years, Meadmore raised her children and participated in social projects.{{sfn|''The Montreal Gazette''|1986|p=B-8}}

==Career and activism==
During this time, in 1959 Meadmore helped establish a gathering place where urban native people around Winnipeg could gather, called the [[Indian and Métis Friendship Centre]] (IMFC). The center was the first one in Canada and has since been replicated dozens of times.{{sfn|Chalmers-Brooks|2015|p=15}} Meadmore worked full-time as a liaison at the IMFC.{{sfn|''The Ottawa Citizen''|1970|p=29}} As the center grew, it established a newspaper, ''The Prairie Call'', which was organized in 1961 as a means of featuring aboriginal writings and notifications of activities. Meadmore, who was the editor of ''The Prairie Call'' recognized that it was a means to build a community concerned with the legal and socio-economic issues facing indigenous people and used the paper to discuss realities of urban life as well as human rights issues.{{sfn|Cariou|Sinclair|2011|p=155}} Simultaneously, she joined with Telford Adams, A.H. Brass, Joe Keeper, David Knight and George Manuel to form the Temporary Committee of the [[National Indian Council]], which would later become the [[Assembly of First Nations]]. The goal was to create a national body committed to both advancement of native peoples and preservation of their identity,{{sfn|Miller|2000|pp=329-330}} where native people could come up with their own solutions to the problems facing their cultures.{{sfn|Chalmers-Brooks|2015|p=15}} When the organization's board was formalized the following year, Meadmore was elected secretary-treasurer.{{sfn|''The Brandon Sun''|1962|p=9}}

In 1970, Meadmore was appointed to the [[National Council of Welfare]].{{sfn|''The Ottawa Citizen''|1970|p=29}} That same year, after witnessing the struggles a friend had in securing safe housing on a limited budget, Meadmore helped launch the Kinew Housing project, under the sponsorship of the IMFC.{{sfn|Chalmers-Brooks|2015|p=15}}{{sfn|Miller|Roche|2009|pp=196-197}} She and Mary Guilbault were instrumental in both founding the Kinew project and advocating for a social housing policy.{{sfn|Miller|Roche|2009|p=212}} Seeking the cooperation of private funding and the [[Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation]] (CMHC), they secured houses at favorable prices.{{sfn|Miller|Roche|2009|p=197}} Renovations were completed by indigenous workers,{{sfn|Chalmers-Brooks|2015|p=15}} to make the homes livable and safe, and they were then offered to Native Canadians at reasonable rates.{{sfn|Marks|2015}} Then counselors from IMFC met with tenants to give advice on a range of issues including housing concerns and tips to dealing with employers and the urban environment.{{sfn|Miller|Roche|2009|p=198}} Because the housing purchases required use of a lawyer, Meadmore began to think about returning to school,{{sfn|Chalmers-Brooks|2015|p=15}} to better understand the legal impact on business and economic development programs.{{sfn|''The Montreal Gazette''|1986|p=B-8}}

When Meadmore completed her law degree in 1977 at the University of Manitoba, she became the first Canadian indigenous woman lawyer.{{sfn|Marks|2015}} First working at Legal Aid Manitoba, practicing criminal and family law,{{sfn|''The Montreal Gazette''|1986|p=B-8}} Meadmore soon opened Winnipeg's first all-female law firm,{{sfn|Chalmers-Brooks|2015|p=15}}&lt;ref&gt;https://umlarchives.lib.umanitoba.ca/marion-meadmore-fonds&lt;/ref&gt; which focused on corporate law.{{sfn|''The Montreal Gazette''|1986|p=B-8}} She was one of the founders of the Canadian Indian Lawyers Association, now known as the [[Indigenous Bar Association of Canada]].{{sfn|Lagimodiere|2013|p=4}} In 1982, she left the active practice of law and began the Indian Business Development Group to encourage growth in native businesses.{{sfn|''The Montreal Gazette''|1986|p=B-8}}

Meadmore was one of the founders of the [[National Indigenous Council of Elders]] (NICE), which strives to join First Nation elders from across Canada to develop economic programs which will enable Canada's indigenous people to operate without government funding. Because the tribes have trusts in the billions of dollars, and understand the needs of their own communities in a way that the government cannot, they are pushing to be able to manage their own funds and solve their own social problems.{{sfn|Marks|2014}}

==Awards and honors==
In 1985, Meadmore was awarded membership in the [[Order of Canada]].{{sfn|''The Ottawa Citizen''|1984|p=A-4}} In 2010 she was honored with the title of "Grandmother" from the Ka Ni Kanichihk service organization, which hosts the annual Keeping the Fires Burning Aboriginal Awards to recognize women who serve as role models for younger indigenous women.{{sfn|Preprost|2010}} In 2014, she was awarded an [[Indspire Awards]] laureate designation for law by the [[Indspire|Indspire Foundation]]{{sfn|Indspire Canada|2014}} and the University of Manitoba granted a Lifetime Achievement Award to Meadmore in 2015.{{sfn|Marks|2015}}

==Ideas==

Emoto said that water was a "blueprint for our reality" and that emotional "energies" and "vibrations" could change the physical structure of water.&lt;ref name= "Gray2003"&gt;{{cite news |last= Gray |first= Donna |date= July 26, 2003 |title= Message in the water |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/245079696 |newspaper= [[Calgary Herald]] |page= S8 |via= [[ProQuest]] |subscription= yes |accessdate= 2014-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emoto's water crystal experiments consisted of exposing water in glasses to different words, pictures, or music and then freezing and examining the [[aesthetic]] properties of the resulting crystals with microscopic photography.&lt;ref name= "Reville2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= How to Take a Water Crystal Photograph |url= http://www.masaru-emoto.net/english/ediary200609.html#0915 |website= masaru-emoto.net |accessdate= 2011-10-10 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111018110026/http://www.masaru-emoto.net/english/ediary200609.html |archivedate= 2011-10-18}}{{Failed verification|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emoto made the claim that water exposed to positive speech and thoughts would result in visually "pleasing" crystals being formed when that water was frozen and that negative intention would yield "ugly" frozen crystal formations.&lt;ref name= "Reville2011"/&gt;

Emoto held that different water sources would produce different crystalline structures when frozen. For example, he held that a water sample from a mountain stream when frozen would show structures of beautifully shaped geometric design, but those structures would be distorted and randomly formed if the sample were taken from a polluted water source. Emoto held that these changes could be eliminated by exposing water to [[ultraviolet|ultraviolet light]] or certain [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic waves]].&lt;ref name= "Gray2003"/&gt;

In 2008, Emoto published his findings in the [[Journal of Scientific Exploration]], a [[peer review]]ed [[scientific journal]] of the [[Society for Scientific Exploration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Volume 22, Number 4 (2008) {{!}} Society for Scientific Exploration|url = http://www.scientificexploration.org/journal/volume-22-number-4-2008|website = www.scientificexploration.org|access-date = 2016-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was conducted and authored by Masaru Emoto and Takashige Kizu of Emoto’s own IHM General Institute, along with [[Dean Radin]] and Nancy Lund of the [[Institute of Noetic Sciences]], which is on [[Stephen_Barrett#Consumer_information|Stephen Barrett's]] [[Quackwatch]] list of questionable organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barrett|first=Stephen|title=Questionable Organizations: An Overview|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/nonrecorg.html|publisher=[[Quackwatch]]|accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the experiment, more than 1,900 of Emoto's followers focused feelings of gratitude toward water stored in bottles, which was then frozen and its crystalline formations inspected.&lt;ref name= "Kiesling2009"/&gt; The gratitude-focused crystals were rated slightly more "beautiful" than one set of control crystals and slightly less "beautiful" than the other controls. An objective comparison of the samples did not reveal any significant differences.&lt;ref name= "Kiesling2009"/&gt;

==Scientific criticism==
Commentators have criticized Emoto for insufficient [[experimental control]]s and for not sharing enough details of his approach with the scientific community.&lt;ref name= "Reville2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Koh |first= Lay Chin |date= January 28, 2009 |title= A 'hado' will never replace a home full of life |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/272168250 |newspaper= [[New Straits Times]] |location= Kuala Lumpur, MY |page= 17 |via= [[ProQuest]] |subscription= yes |accessdate= 2014-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William A. Tiller]], another researcher featured in the documentary ''[[What The Bleep Do We Know?]]'', states that Emoto's experiments fall short of proof since they do not control for other factors in the [[supercooling]] of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= What the Bleep do we Know!?: A Personal Narrative |last= Tiller |first= William |authorlink= William A.

Writing about Emoto's ideas in the ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'', physician [[Harriet A. Hall]] concluded that it was "hard to see how anyone could mistake it for science".&lt;ref name=MasaruWonderful&gt;Hall, Harriet. (2007). ''Masaru Emoto's Wonderful World of Water''. Skeptical Inquirer 31: 49-51.&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on Emoto's ideas about clearing water polluted by algae, biologist [[Tyler Volk]] stated, "What he is saying has nothing to do with science as I know it."&lt;ref name= "Neimark2005"/&gt;  Stephen Kiesling wrote in ''Spirituality &amp; Health Magazine'', "Perhaps Emoto is an evangelist who values the message of his images more than the particulars of science; nevertheless, this spiritual teacher might focus his future practice less on gratitude and more on honesty."&lt;ref name= "Kiesling2009"/&gt;

Emoto was personally invited to take the [[One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge]] by [[James Randi]] in 2003 and would have received US$1,000,000 if he had been able to reproduce the experiment under test conditions agreed to by both parties. He did not participate.&lt;ref name="Mason2010"&gt;{{cite book |last= Mason |first= Phil |authorlink= Phil Mason |title= Quantum Glory: The Science of Heaven Invading Earth |year= 2010 |location= Maricopa, AZ |publisher= XP Publishing |isbn= 9781936101597|page= [https://books.google.com/books?id=EbSuDtaOH_cC&amp;pg=PA150 150]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Randi |first= James |authorlink= James Randi |date= May 23, 2003 |title= Chiropractic Crackup, Talking to Water, Sylvia Emerges!, Bidlack's Lumps, An MS Miracle, and a Korean Magic Stone... |url= http://www.randi.org/jr/052303.html |publisher= [[James Randi Educational Foundation]] |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20030602141607/http://www.randi.org/jr/052303.html |archivedate= 2003-06-02 |work= Swift |type= online newsletter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Merrill Singer''' (b. October 6, 1950 McKeesport, PA, USA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhsn.med.miami.edu/documents/cv/m_singer_cv_11.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726115922/http://www.nhsn.med.miami.edu/documents/cv/m_singer_cv_11.pdf |archivedate=2014-07-26 |df= }}  Resume&lt;/ref&gt;  is a [[medical anthropologist]] and professor in Anthropology at The University of Connecticut and in Community Medicine at The University of Connecticut Health Center. He is a prolific writer and best known for his research on [[substance abuse]], [[HIV/AIDS]], syndemics, health disparities, and minority health.&lt;ref&gt;http://medanth.wikispaces.com/Merrill+Singer  MedAnth wiki page with photo&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Singer studied anthropology at [[California State University, Northridge]] (Master of Arts, Anthropology,1975) and completed a PhD in Anthropology at the [[University of Utah]] in 1979.

He held a National Institute of Alcohol and Alcohol Abuse Postdoctoral Fellowship in the Department of Psychiatry, [[George Washington University]] (1979–80) and another at the University of Connecticut Medical School from 1982-3.

He was a researcher, rising to Associate Director, at the Hispanic Health Council in Hartford, Connecticut from 1982-2007, and moved to the University of Connecticut in 2007, becoming Professor in 2008.

==Scholarship==
As Director of the Center for Community Health Research at the Hispanic Health Council, he helped to develop the theoretical perspective within medical anthropology known as ''[[critical medical anthropology]]''. Dr. Singer also developed the public health concepts of ''[[syndemic]]s'' and ''oppression illness''. Most recently, he has published a number of articles on ''pluralea''.

The first of these terms refers to the clustering of diseases in populations and the biological interaction of diseases in individual bodies. Moreover, the term syndemics also points to the determinant importance of social conditions in disease concentrations, interactions, and health consequences. In syndemics, the interaction of diseases or other adverse health conditions commonly arises because of adverse social conditions (e.g., poverty, exploitation, stigmatization, oppressive social relationships) that put socially devalued groups at heightened risk. The term oppression illness refers to the internalization of social discrimination and the health consequences of coming to accept one does not deserve to be healthy. The term pluralea refers to the adverse intersection of environmental crises and their health effects.

In his work on alcohol and drug use, Singer explains that all drugs are commodities and draws attention to social constructions of legitimate or legal and illegitimate or illegal drugs. In his book Drugging the Poor: Legal and Illegal Drugs and Social Inequality, Singer notes that all drugs are forms of self-medicating, and that distinctions of legal or illegal serve to reinforce social hierarchies and inequalities. Furthermore, Singer argues that drug use among the poor is a type of self-medicating in response to the pressures of being poor. Responding to ways illegal drug users are vilified, Singer argues that by using language of blame to describe drug users as responsible for deteriorating urban centers, “attention is diverted from the role of class inequality as a source of social misery.”&lt;ref&gt;http://medanth.wikispaces.com/Merrill+Singer  MedAnth wiki page&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Singer has been the Principal Investigator on a series of U.S. Federal and foundation funded drinking, drug use, and AIDS prevention grants since 1984.  Recent grants include:
*Community-based HIV Education Research Program for Diverse Racial, Ethnic and Disadvantaged Groups. (National Institute of Mental Health,2010-2015). 
*Surveillance of emergent drug use trends (CDC)
*Sexual  communication and risk among inner city young adults (CDC)
*Assessing the implementation of oral HIV testing among injection drug users in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil ([[National Institute on Drug Abuse|NIDA]])
*Ethical issues in research with active drug users ([[National Institute on Drug Abuse|NIDA]])
*Evaluation of the Work and Learn Model in Connecticut (DCF)

Additionally, he is co-editor with Pamela Erickson of the book series '''Advances in Critical Medical Anthropology'' with Left Coast Press.

==Recognition==
* Society for Medical Anthropology (SMA) Career Award (2017). 
  Solon T. Kimball Award for Public and Applied Anthropology from the [[American Anthropological Association]]. (2010)
* Selected as the first recipient of the Practicing Anthropology Award by the [[Society for Medical Anthropology]] in 2004
* Career Recognition Award from the [[Society for the Anthropology of North America]] in 2005.  
* AIDS and Anthropology Paper Prizes and the [[Rudolf Virchow Award]] through the [[Society for Medical Anthropology]].
* [[Rudolf Virchow Award|Rudolf Virchow Prize]], Critical Anthropology of Health Caucus, Society for Medical Anthropology (1991).

}}'''Michael Alan Steinberg''' (born February 6, 1959) is an [[Americans|American]] [[lawyer]] and politician. He has been an unsuccessful candidate in several [[Florida state legislature]] elections, and a candidate for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016|presidential nomination]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 election]]. He was also the [[Reform Party of the United States|Reform Party]]'s nominee for [[Vice President of the United States]] in the 2016 election.

Steinberg has been practicing law for over 30 years, and his firm, Michael Steinberg &amp; Associates, provides legal services to clients in [[social security]], [[Veterans' benefits|veteran's compensation]], long-term [[disability insurance]], and [[State disability benefits|state disability]] matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ssalawyers.com/practice-areas.html|title=Michael Steinberg And Associates - Disability Lawyers|website=Michael Steinberg and Associates|language=en|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Tampa Bay Times]]'' cited him saying that the aging population of Tampa Bay and the area's declining economy were the cause of an increase in local legal claims. Between 2008 and 2009, the 21 percent increase in social security disability legal claims in Tampa Bay broke the nationwide record.&lt;ref name=rise&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/aging/socialsecurity/social-security-disability-claims-on-the-rise-in-tampa-bay/1122340 |title=Social Security disability claims on the rise in Tampa Bay |author=Kameel Stanley |date=September 17, 2010 |publisher=''[[Tampa Bay Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, his wife Miriam ran for a Florida state legislature seat in District 64, where he had run unsuccessfully in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://floridapolitics.com/archives/tag/miriam-steinberg |title=Lawsuit seeks to remove Jamie Grant from 2018 ballot |website=floridapolitics.com |access-date=August 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Steinberg received his bachelor's degree in economics and a law degree from the [[University of Florida]]. In addition to his career as an attorney practicing social security law, he has served on the [[Florida Bar Association]]'s military law subcommittee.&lt;ref name=47series&gt;{{cite news|title=STATE HOUSE DISTRICT 47 Series: Know Your Candidates: November 5th General Election; Election 2002: |last=Zimmer |first=Josh |publisher=''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' |date=October 31, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political involvement==

===2002 Florida state legislature election===
In 2002, Steinberg ran for election for the Florida state legislature in District 64; his candidacy was endorsed by the ''[[St. Petersburg Times]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=For a better state House Series: TIMES RECOMMENDS |publisher=St. Petersburg Times |date= August 23, 2002 |page=16A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months after losing the election, Steinberg filed a lawsuit against the [[Florida Republican Party|state Republican party]] for [[push polling]] against him in the election. The Florida Republican Party hired Tarrance Group, a Virginia-based polling company, to survey voters across the state. Towson Fraser, spokesman for the Republican Party of Florida at the time, denied that his party used push polls.&lt;ref name="push"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=''St. Petersburg Times'' |title=Push polling unfair, says candidate |last=Zimmer |first=Josh |page=6 |date=2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steinberg ran again for this seat in 2010, and lost.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

===2006 congressional election===
In 2006, Steinberg received 1,334 votes (3.4% of the popular vote) in the Democratic primary race for [[Florida's 11th congressional district]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=ELECTION RESULTS: [STATE / SUNCOAST Edition]
|publisher=''St. Petersburg Times'' |date=September 7, 2006 |page=3B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014 wife's candidacy===
When his wife, Miriam Steinberg, was running for office in 2014, he filed a lawsuit to disqualify a competing [[write-in candidate]]. Although the lawsuit was successful, the election was ruled invalid, and the seat was vacant until a special election could be held. As a result, [[J. W. Grant]], who was out of office for a period, was automatically the winner of the election despite having reached his [[term limit]].&lt;ref name="tbo"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tbo.com/news/politics/candidates-proof-of-residency-sign-on-his-bedroom-door-20140717/ |title=Candidate’s proof of residency: Sign on his bedroom door |last=Rosica |first=James L. |publisher=[[Scripps Capital Bureau]] |work=[[Tampa Tribune]] |date=July 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Miriam lost the election to Grant by a 59:40 margin.&lt;ref name="throws"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/elections/court-ruling-throws-tampa-bay-house-district-election-back-up-in-the-air/2202429 |title=Court ruling leaves Tampa Bay area state House election up in the air |first=Tia |last=Mitchell  |publisher=''Tampa Bay Times'' |date=October 16, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was later ruled that write-in candidate should not have been disqualified, and subsequently, the election was ruled unconstitutional and the Florida legislature voted not to accept the result.&lt;ref name="rejects"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/stateroundup/florida-house-rejects-election-returns-for-tampas-district-64-special/2206941 |title=Florida House rejects Tampa's District 64 election results; special vote to come |date=November 18, 2014 |first=Kathleen |last=McCrory |publisher=''Tampa Bay Times'' }}&lt;/ref&gt; Miriam then failed to file new fees to run again against Grant in a special election; although Michael filed a claim against the [[Florida Election Commission]] disputing the fee requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fec.state.fl.us/FECWebFi.nsf/0/F3E338910390EA4185257E430071587A/$file/14-455+Steinberg,+Miriam_Redacted.pdf |title=lawsuit |publisher=FECWebFi ? }}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in Grant's only opponent being a write-in candidate. No write-in candidate has ever won an election in Florida.&lt;ref name="Watkins"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baynews9.com/content/news/baynews9/news/article.html/content/news/articles/bn9/2015/1/16/_1_name_on_ballot_fo.html|title=1 name on ballot for District 64 special election|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saintpetersblog.com/archives/171168 |title=Nancy Watkins will not run for the Tampa HD 60 seat |publisher=SaintPetersBlog |date=2016-03-25 |accessdate=2016-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grant was about to be running up against a Florida term limit law, but because the regular election was ruled invalid the seat was vacant for most of 2015 legislative session.&lt;ref name="Watkins" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/elections/court-ruling-throws-tampa-bay-house-district-election-back-up-in-the-air/2202429 Tampa Bay Times addresses Michael]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Join the discussion: Click to view comments, add yours |url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/state-house-district-64/2192944 |title=State House, District 64 &amp;#124; Tampa Bay Times |publisher=Tampabay.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016 presidential election campaign===
Steinberg filed papers with the [[Federal Election Commission|U.S. Federal Election Commission]] in November 2013 to run for President in the 2016 election as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]].&lt;ref name="FECfiling"&gt;{{cite web |title=FEC filing: Michael Steinberg for President committee |url=http://docquery.fec.gov/pdf/521/13031141521/13031141521.pdf |publisher= FEC.gov |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/12/16/here-is-a-primer-to-people-other-than-jeb-bush-who-are-running-for-president-in-2016/ | title=Here is a primer on people other than Jeb Bush who are running for president in 2016| work=[[The Washington Post]] | date= December 16, 2014| accessdate= | author= Fuller, Jaime }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016 vice-presidential candidacy===
After failing to gain traction for his presidential bid, he was then nominated by the Reform Party of the United States as the vice-presidential running mate of 2016 Reform presidential nominee [[Rocky De La Fuente]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegreenpapers.com/G16/FL|title=Florida 2016 General Election|website=www.thegreenpapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Winger|Winger, Richard]] (August 9, 2016) [http://ballot-access.org/2016/08/09/reform-party-nominates-rocky-de-la-fuente-for-president/ "Reform Party Nominates Rocky De La Fuente for President"],  ''[[Ballot Access News]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7384">'''Natvar Bhavsar''' (born 1934) is an [[India]]n - American artist, based in [[Soho]], [[New York City]] for nearly 50 years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bhavsar, Natvar (American, born India 1934) |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hi/hi_bhavsarnatvar.htm |date= |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |accessdate=May 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted as an [[abstract expressionist]] and [[color field]] artist. Bhavsar's paintings appear in more than 800 private and public collections, including the collections of the [[Boston Museum of Fine Arts]], the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York, the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]], the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] in New York, the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney|Museum of Contemporary Art]] in Sydney, Australia, the [[Library of Congress]], NYU's Grey Art Gallery, and the [[Australian National Gallery]]. In addition, his works have been purchased and displayed by corporations such as the American Express Company, AT&amp;T, Chase Manhattan Bank, and NBC.  Bhavsar and his works have been the subject of books, including: ''Natvar Bhavsar: The Sound of Color,'' ([[Robert C. Morgan]], 2002) and ''Natvar Bhavsar: Painting and the Reality of Color,'' ([[Irving Sandler]], 1999).

==Early life and education==
Bhavsar is a [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YStfwHuo32A|title=Indian- American artist Natvar Bhavsar reveals the essence of his art}}&lt;/ref&gt; Born 1934 &lt;ref name=zim/&gt; in village [[Gothava]], near [[Visnagar]] in [[Gujarat]],&lt;ref name=toi/&gt; India to a wealthy family, he studied at the Seth CN College of Fine Arts in [[Ahmedabad]]. He also graduated in English literature from [[Gujarat University]]. Bhavsar earned a Master of Fine Arts degree from the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Design]] in 1965, and received a Rockefeller grant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Biography |url=http://www.natvarbhavsar.com/?page_id=18 |date= |publisher=Basvar website |accessdate=May 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Guj painter too pricey for India!|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-01-05/ahmedabad/28367633_1_painting-art-world-zimmerli-art-museum |publisher=The Times of India |date= Jan 5, 2011 |accessdate=May 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Bhavsar attained prominence as an artist in India by age 19, working primarily in the [[Cubist]] vein. After moving to New York City, he became influenced by the freedom of abstract painting. His style evolved into [[abstract expressionism]] and color field painting, and his works often feature a hazy object (absent of direct lines or geometric shapes) in the center of a solid canvas, that projects an astral-like mass of color.

Employing some techniques from the Indian tradition of [[sand painting]], Bhavsar paints in an improvisational manner, "soaking the canvas with acrylic-based liquid binders that absorb and hold the fine pigment powder. He applies the base using a sifting technique with a screen, during which layers of fine, concentrated pigment are sprinkled and drizzled over the canvas (or paper), which is laid out on the floor so that the artist can walk around the painting and work on it from all sides."&lt;ref&gt;Genocchio, Benjamin, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/06/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/06artsnj.html?fta=y ''The Details Are in the Beauty ''], Art Review, New York Times, May 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bhavsar primarily shows his work at the Sundaram Tagore Gallery in New York and the ACP Viviane Ehrli Gallery in Zurich, Switzerland, along with Pundole Art Gallery in Bombay, India. He has been exhibiting his works in one-man shows since 1970. In 2007, the [[Jane Voorhees Zimmerli Art Museum]] at [[Rutgers University]] sponsored an exhibition of about 50 of Bhavsar’s works. It was the first United States university to hold a one-man show of a South Asian artist.&lt;ref name=zim&gt;{{cite web |title=Natvar Bhavsar: The Dimensions of Color |url=http://www.zimmerlimuseum.rutgers.edu/exhibitions/natvar-bhavsar-dimensions-color#.UZGrKKJTCHg |date=July 2007 |publisher=Jane Voorhees Zimmerli Art Museum |accessdate=May 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier in his career, Bhavsar was a [[Asian Cultural Council|John D. Rockefeller III Fund]] Fellow (1965 –1966), a [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]] Fellow (1975 – 1976), and an Instructor of Art at the [[University of Rhode Island]] (1967 – 1969). In 1980 and 1983, he participated in Executive Seminars at the Aspen Institute and, more recently, participated as a Cultural Leader at the World Economic Forums in Davos, Switzerland (2000) and New York (2002). Throughout his career, Bhavsar has associated with a number of acclaimed artists, most prominently, [[Mark Rothko]] (1903 – 1970) and [[Barnett Newman]] (1905 – 1970).

Bhasvar has been included in the [[Asian American Arts Centre]]'s artasiamerica digital archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artasiamerica.org/artist/detail/48|title=Bhavsar, Natvar|accessdate=24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2011, a documentary on his life and works, ''The Poetics of Color: Natvar Bhavsar, a Painter's Journey'' was made by Sundaram Tagore.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|1811345|The Poetics of Color: Natvar Bhavsar, a Painter's Journey}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Indian colours on American soil |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-04-04/art-culture/29379357_1_art-world-natvar-bhavsar-documentary-film |publisher=The Times of India |date= Apr 4, 2011 |accessdate=May 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

'''Oscar Palmer Robertson''' (born November 24, 1938), nicknamed "'''The Big O'''", is an American retired professional basketball player who played for the [[Cincinnati Royals]] and [[Milwaukee Bucks]].&lt;ref name="orstats"&gt;{{cite web |title=Oscar Robertson stats |url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/roberos01.html |publisher=Basketball-reference.com|accessdate=2007-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{convert|6|ft|5|in|abbr=on}}, {{convert|205|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;basketball-reference.com, [https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/roberos01.html], accessed January 25, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Robertson played  [[point guard]] and was a 12-time [[NBA All-Star Game|All-Star]], 11-time member of the [[All-NBA Team]], and one-time winner of the [[National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] award in 14 professional seasons. In [[1961–62 NBA season|1962]], he became the first player in NBA history to average a [[triple-double]] for a season.&lt;ref name="nbasummary"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Nba.com|title=Oscar Robertson nba.com summary |url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/robertson_bio.html |accessdate=2007-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[1970–71 NBA season]], he was a key player on the team that brought the Bucks their only NBA title. His playing career, especially during high school and college, was plagued by [[racism]].&lt;ref name="nbasummary" /&gt;

Robertson is a two-time [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] inductee, having been inducted in 1980 for his individual career, and in 2010 as a member of the [[1960 United States men's Olympic basketball team]] and president of the [[National Basketball Players Association]]. He also was voted one of the [[50 Greatest Players in NBA History]] in 1996.&lt;ref name="hoophall"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Hoophall.com |title=Oscar Robertson Basketball Hall of Fame summary |url=http://www.hoophall.com/halloffamers/Robertson.htm|accessdate = 2007-01-25 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070121083634/http://www.hoophall.com/halloffamers/Robertson.htm |archivedate = 2007-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Basketball Writers Association]] renamed their College Player of the Year Award the [[Oscar Robertson Trophy]] in his honor in 1998, and he was one of five people chosen to represent the inaugural [[National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame]] class in 2006.&lt;ref name="chof"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Abc.com |title=Wooden, Russell lead founding class into Collegiate Hall of Fame |url=http://nabc.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/112106aae.html |accessdate=2007-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was ranked as the 36th best American athlete of the 20th century by ESPN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/athletes.html |title=Top N.

Robertson was also an integral part of ''[[Robertson v. National Basketball Ass'n]]'' of 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00016428.html |title=Oscar defined the triple-double |publisher=Espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The landmark NBA [[antitrust]] suit, named after the then-president of the [[NBA Players' Association]], led to an extensive reform of the league's strict [[Free agent|free agency]] and [[draft (sports)|draft]] rules and, subsequently, to higher salaries for all players.&lt;ref name="nbasummary"/&gt;

==Early years==
Robertson was born in poverty in [[Charlotte, Tennessee]], and grew up in a [[Racial segregation|segregated]] housing project in [[Indianapolis]]. In contrast to many other boys who preferred to play [[baseball]], he was drawn to basketball because it was "a poor kids' game". Because his family could not afford to buy a basketball, he learned how to shoot by tossing tennis balls and rags bound with rubber bands into a peach basket behind his family's home.&lt;ref name="nbasummary"/&gt; Robertson attended [[Crispus Attucks High School]], an all-black high school.

==Crispus Attucks High School==
At Crispus Attucks, Robertson was coached by [[Ray Crowe]], whose emphasis on a fundamentally sound game had a positive effect on Robertson's style of play. As a sophomore in 1954, he starred on an Attucks team that lost in the semi-state finals (state quarterfinals) to [[1954 Milan High School basketball team|eventual state champions Milan]], whose story would later be the basis of the classic 1986 movie ''[[Hoosiers (film)|Hoosiers]]''.  When Robertson was a junior, Crispus Attucks dominated its opposition, going 31–1 and winning the 1955 state championship, the first for any all-black school in the nation. The following year the team finished with a perfect 31–0 record and won a second straight [[IHSAA Men's Basketball Championship|Indiana state title]], becoming the first team in Indiana to secure a perfect season and compiling a state-record 45 straight victories. The state championships were also the first ever by an Indianapolis team in the Hoosier tourney. After their championship game wins, the team was paraded through town in a regular tradition, but they were then taken to a park outside downtown to continue their celebration, unlike other teams. Robertson stated, "[Officials] thought the blacks were going to tear the town up, and they thought the whites wouldn't like it."&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Dorsey, [http://espn.go.com/high-school/boys-basketball/story/_/id/3932457/attucks-win-helped-race-relations/ ''Attucks' win helped race relations''], ESPN.com, February 27, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Robertson scored 24.0 points per game in his senior season and was named [[Indiana Mr. Basketball|Indiana "Mr. Basketball"]] in 1956.&lt;ref name="nbasummary"/&gt; After his graduation that year, Robertson enrolled at the [[University of Cincinnati]].

==University of Cincinnati (1957–1960)==
Robertson continued to excel while at the [[Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball|University of Cincinnati]], recording an incredible scoring average of 33.8 points per game, the third highest in college history. In each of his three years, he won the national scoring title, was named an All-American, and was chosen College Player of the Year, while setting 14 [[NCAA]] and 19 school records.&lt;ref name="hoophall"/&gt;

Robertson's stellar play led the [[Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball|Bearcats]] to a 79–9 overall record during his three varsity seasons, including two [[Final Four]] appearances. However, a championship eluded Robertson, something that would become a repeated occurrence until late in his professional career. When Robertson left college he was the all-time leading NCAA scorer until fellow Hall of Fame player [[Pete Maravich]] topped him in 1970.&lt;ref name="nbasummary"/&gt; Robertson took Cincinnati to national prominence during his time there, but the university's greatest success in basketball took place immediately after his departure, when the team won national titles in 1961, 1962, and just missed a third title in 1963.

He continues to stand atop the Bearcats' record book. The many records he still holds include: points in one game, 62 (one of his six games of 50 points or more); career triple-doubles, 10; career rebounds per game, 15.2; and career points, 2,973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/cinn/sports/m-baskbl/auto_pdf/1011UCMBKMEDIASUP.pdf |format=PDF |title=2010-11 Men's basketball Media Supplement |publisher=Grfx.cstv.com |accessdate=2015-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson had many outstanding individual game performances, including 10 triple-doubles. His personal best might have been his line of 45 points, 23 rebounds and 10 assists vs. [[Indiana State]] in 1959.

Despite his success on the court, Robertson's college career was soured by racism. In those days, southern university programs such as those of Kentucky, Duke, and North Carolina did not recruit black athletes, and road trips to segregated cities were especially difficult, with Robertson often sleeping in college dorms instead of hotels. "I'll never forgive them", he told ''[[The Indianapolis Star]]'' years later.&lt;ref name="nbasummary"/&gt; Decades after his college days, Robertson's stellar NCAA career was rewarded by the United States Basketball Writers Association when, in 1998, they renamed the trophy awarded to the NCAA Division I Player of the Year the [[Oscar Robertson Trophy]]. This honor brought the award full circle for Robertson since he had won the first two awards ever presented.&lt;ref name="oscarrobertsontrophy"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Usbwa.com |title=Oscar Robertson Trophy |url=http://www.sportswriters.net/usbwa/awards/robertson/index.html |accessdate=2007-01-25 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070213004535/http://www.sportswriters.net/usbwa/awards/robertson/index.html |archivedate = 2007-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1960 Olympics==

After college, Robertson and [[Jerry West]] co-captained the U.S. [[Basketball at the 1960 Summer Olympics|basketball]] team at the [[1960 Summer Olympics]]. The team, described as the greatest assemblage of amateur basketball talent ever, steamrollered the competition to win the [[gold medal]]. Robertson was a starting [[forward (basketball)|forward]] along with [[Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball|Purdue]]'s [[Terry Dischinger]], but played [[point guard]] as well. He was the co-leading scorer with fellow NBA legend [[Jerry Lucas]], as the U.S. team won its nine games by a margin of 42.4 points. Ten of the twelve college players on the American squad later played in the NBA, including Robertson as well as future Hall-of-Famers West, Lucas, and [[Walt Bellamy]].&lt;ref name="olympics"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Usabasketball.com |title=Games of the XVIIth Olympiad -- 1960 |url=http://www.usabasketball.com/history/moly_1960.html |accessdate=2007-01-31 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061231090025/http://www.usabasketball.com/history/moly_1960.html |archivedate = 2006-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career==

===Cincinnati Royals===
[[File:Oscar Robertson 1960s.jpeg|thumb|Robertson displaying his ball-handling talent with the Cincinnati Royals]]
Prior to the [[1960–61 NBA season]], Robertson made himself eligible for the [[1960 NBA draft]]. He was drafted by the Cincinnati Royals as a territorial pick. The Royals gave Robertson a $33,000 signing bonus, a far cry from his childhood days when he was too poor to afford a basketball.&lt;ref name="nbasummary"/&gt; In his rookie season, Robertson averaged 30.5 [[point (basketball)|points]], 10.1 [[rebound (basketball)|rebounds]] and 9.7 [[assist (basketball)|assists]] (leading the league), almost averaging a [[triple-double]] for the entire season. He was named [[NBA Rookie of the Year]], was elected into the [[All-NBA First Team]] – which would happen in each of Robertson's first nine seasons – and made the first of 12 consecutive [[National Basketball Association All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] appearances.&lt;ref name="orstats"/&gt; In addition, he was named the [[1961 NBA All-Star Game]] MVP following his 23-point, 14-assist, 9-rebound performance in a West victory. However, the Royals finished with a 33–46 record and stayed in the cellar of the Western Division.

In the [[1961–62 NBA season|1961–62 season]], Robertson became the first player in NBA history to average a triple-double for an entire season, with 30.8 points, 12.5 rebounds and 11.4 assists.&lt;ref name="orstats"/&gt; Robertson also set a then-NBA record for the most triple-doubles during the regular season with 41 triple-doubles; the record would stand for over half a century when, in [[2016–17 NBA season|2016–17]], [[Russell Westbrook]] recorded 42 and joined Robertson as the only other player to average a triple-double for an entire season. He broke the assists record by [[Bob Cousy]], who had recorded 715 assists two seasons earlier, by logging 899. The Royals [[1962 NBA Playoffs|earned a playoff berth]]; however, they were eliminated in the first round by the [[Detroit Pistons]].&lt;ref name="1962royals"&gt;{{cite web |title=1962 Cincinnati Royals |url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CIN/1962.html|publisher=Basketball-reference.com |accessdate=2007-01-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the next [[1962–63 NBA season|season]], Robertson further established himself as one of the greatest players of his generation, averaging 28.3 points, 10.4 rebounds and 9.5 assists, narrowly missing out on another triple-double season.&lt;ref name="orstats"/&gt; The Royals advanced to the Eastern Division Finals, but succumbed in a seven-game series against a Boston Celtics team led by [[Bill Russell]].&lt;ref name="1963royals"&gt;{{cite web |title=1963 Cincinnati Royals |url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CIN/1961.html|publisher=Basketball-reference.com |accessdate=2007-01-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[1963–64 NBA season|1963–64 season]], the Royals achieved a 55–25 record,&lt;ref name="1964royals"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Basketball-reference.com |first= |title=1964 Cincinnati Royals |url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CIN/1964.html |accessdate=2007-01-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which put them second place in the Eastern Division. Under new coach [[Jack McMahon]], Robertson flourished, and for the first time in his career, he had a decent supporting cast: second scoring option [[Jack Twyman]] was now supplemented by [[Jerry Lucas]] and [[Wayne Embry]], and fellow guard [[Adrian Smith (basketball)|Adrian Smith]] helped Robertson in the backcourt. Robertson led the NBA in free-throw percentage, scored a career-high 31.4 points per game, and averaged 9.9 rebounds and 11.0 assists per game.&lt;ref name="orstats"/&gt; The averages for his first five NBA seasons are a triple-double: 30.3 points, 10.4 rebounds and 10.6 assists per game. He won the [[NBA MVP]] award and became the only player other than [[Bill Russell]] and [[Wilt Chamberlain]] to win it from 1960 to 1968.&lt;ref name="nbasummary"/&gt; Robertson also won his second All-Star Game MVP award that year after scoring 26 points, grabbing 14 rebounds, and dishing off 8 assists in an East victory. [[1964 NBA Playoffs|In the postseason]], the Royals defeated the [[Philadelphia 76ers]], but then were dominated by the Celtics 4 games to 1.&lt;ref name="nbasummary"/&gt;

Robertson averaged a triple-double for his first five seasons in the NBA with the Royals, recording averages of 30.3 points, 10.4 rebounds, and 10.6 assists per game. From the [[1964–65 NBA season|1964–65 season]] on, things began to turn sour for the franchise. Despite Robertson's stellar play, never failing to record averages of at least 24.7 points, 6.0 rebounds and 8.1 assists in the six following seasons,&lt;ref name="orstats"/&gt; the Royals were eliminated in the first round from 1965 to 1967, then missed the playoffs from 1968 to 1970. In the [[1969–70 NBA season|1969–70 season]], the sixth disappointing season in a row, fan support was waning. To help attract the public, 41-year-old head coach Bob Cousy made a short comeback as a player. For seven games, the former Celtics [[point guard]] partnered with Robertson in the Royals' backcourt, but they missed the playoffs.&lt;ref name="nbasummary"/&gt;

===Milwaukee Bucks and the 'Oscar Robertson suit'===
[[File:Oscar Robertson Bucks.jpeg|thumb|Robertson as a member of the Milwaukee Bucks]]
Prior to the 1970–71 season, the Royals stunned the basketball world by trading Robertson to the Bucks for [[Flynn Robinson]] and [[Charlie Paulk]]. No reasons were officially given, but many pundits suspected head coach [[Bob Cousy]] was jealous of all the attention Robertson was getting.&lt;ref name="nbasummary"/&gt; Robertson himself said: "I think he was wrong and I will never forget it."&lt;ref name="nbasummary"/&gt; The relationship between Oscar and the Royals had soured to the point that Cincinnati had also approached the Lakers and Knicks about deals involving their star player (the Knicks players who were discussed in those scenarios are unknown, but Los Angeles stated publicly that the Royals asked about Jerry West and Wilt Chamberlain, with the Lakers saying they would not consider trading either star).

However, the trade proved highly beneficial for Robertson. After being stuck with an under-performing team the last six years, he now was paired with the young Lew Alcindor, who would years later become the all-time NBA scoring leader as [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]]. With Alcindor in the low post and Robertson running the backcourt, the Bucks charged to a league-best 66–16 record, including a then-record [[List of National Basketball Association longest winning streaks|20-game win streak]], a dominating 12–2 record [[1971 NBA Playoffs|in the playoffs]], and crowned their season with the NBA title by sweeping the [[Baltimore Bullets (1963–73)|Baltimore Bullets]] 4–0 in the [[1971 NBA Finals]]. For the first time in his career, Robertson had won an NBA championship.&lt;ref name="nbasummary"/&gt;

From a historical perspective, however, Robertson's most important contribution was made not on a basketball court, but rather in a [[court|court of law]]. It was the year of the landmark ''[[Robertson v. National Basketball Ass'n]]'', an [[antitrust]] suit filed by the NBA's Players Association against the league. As Robertson was the president of the Players Association, the case bore his name. In this suit, the proposed [[American Basketball Association–National Basketball Association merger|merger]] between the NBA and [[American Basketball Association]] was delayed until 1976, and the college draft as well as the free agency clauses were reformed.&lt;ref name="nbasummary"/&gt; Robertson himself stated that the main reason was that clubs basically owned their players: players were forbidden to talk to other clubs once their contract was up, because free agency did not exist back then.&lt;ref name="faq"&gt;{{cite web |title=Oscar Robertson FAQ |url=http://www.thebigo.com/FAQs/FAQsIndex.html |accessdate=2007-01-31 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070430012327/http://www.thebigo.com/FAQs/FAQsIndex.html |archivedate = 2007-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six years after the suit was filed, the NBA finally reached a settlement, the [[ABA–NBA merger]] took place, and the Oscar Robertson suit encouraged signing of more free agents and eventually led to higher salaries for all players.&lt;ref name="nbasummary"/&gt;

On the hardwood, the veteran Robertson still proved he was a valuable player. Paired with Abdul-Jabbar, two more division titles with the Bucks followed in the [[1971–72 NBA season|1971–72]] and [[1972–73 NBA season|1972–73 season]]. In Robertson's last season, he helped lead Milwaukee to a league-best 59–23 record and helped them to reach the [[1974 NBA Finals]]. There, Robertson had the chance to end his stellar career with a second ring. The Bucks were matched up against a Boston Celtics team powered by an inspired [[Dave Cowens]], and the Bucks lost in seven games.&lt;ref name="nbasummary"/&gt; As a testament to Robertson's importance to the Bucks, in the season following his retirement the Bucks fell to last place in their division with a 38–44 record in spite of the continued presence of Abdul-Jabbar.&lt;ref name="1975bucks"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Basketball-reference.com |title=1975 Milwaukee Bucks |url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/teamsMIL/1975.html |accessdate=2007-01-31 }} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson was elected to the [[Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame]] in 1995.

===Post-NBA career===
[[File:O-Train.jpg|thumb|left|Robertson in 2010]]

After he retired as an active player, Robertson stayed involved in efforts to improve living conditions in his native Indianapolis, especially concerning fellow [[African-American]]s.&lt;ref name="nbasummary"/&gt; In addition, he worked as a color commentator with [[Brent Musburger]] on games televised by [[CBS]] during the [[1974–75 NBA season]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web  |title=Oscar Robertson Company Information |url=http://www.thebigo.com/Autobiography/contents.html |accessdate=2007-01-31 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070501181021/http://www.thebigo.com/Autobiography/contents.html |archivedate = 2007-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; His trademark expression was "Oh, Brent, did you see that!" in reaction to flashy or spectacular situations such as fast breaks, slam dunks, player collisions, etc.

After his retirement, the Kansas City Kings (the Royals moved there while Robertson was with the Bucks) retired his #14; the retirement continues to be honored by the Kings in their current home of [[Sacramento Kings|Sacramento]]. The Bucks also retired the #1 he wore in Milwaukee.

In 1994, a nine-foot bronze statue of Robertson was erected outside the [[Fifth Third Arena|Fifth Third Arena at Shoemaker Center]], the current home of Cincinnati Bearcats basketball.&lt;ref name="hoophall"/&gt; Robertson attends many of the games there, viewing the Bearcats from a chair at courtside. In 2006, the statue was relocated to the entrance of the Richard E. Lindner Athletics Center at the University of Cincinnati.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harris|first=Gregory|title=Varsity Village Hits a Home Run On University Campus|url=http://www.landscapeonline.com/research/article/10707|work=LandscapeOnline.com|accessdate=2011-11-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425154327/http://www.landscapeonline.com/research/article/10707|archivedate=2012-04-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2000, Robertson served as a director for Countrywide Financial Corporation, until the company's sale to Bank of America in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/25191/000119312507093783/ddef14a.htm |title=Definitive Notice &amp; Proxy Statement |publisher=Sec.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After many years out of the spotlight, Robertson was recognized on November 17, 2006 for his impact on college basketball when he was chosen to be a member of the founding class of the [[National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame]]. He was one of five people, along with [[John Wooden]], [[Bill Russell]], [[Dean Smith]] and [[Dr. James Naismith]], selected to represent the inaugural class.&lt;ref name="chof"/&gt;

In July 2004, Robertson was named interim head coach of the [[Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball]] team for approximately a  month while head coach [[Bob Huggins]] served a suspension stemming from a drunk-driving conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/news/story?id=1843460 |title=Hall of Famer will serve until Huggins returns |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |accessdate=2015-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011, Robertson joined a [[O'Bannon v. NCAA|class action lawsuit against the NCAA]], challenging the organization's use of the images of its former student athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wetzel |first=Dan |authorlink=Dan Wetzel |title=Robertson joins suit vs. NCAA |date=January 26, 2011 |work=[[Yahoo!

In 2015, Robertson was among a group of investors who placed a [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] legalization initiative on the Ohio ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='The Big O' backs pot legalization|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/12258558/oscar-robertson-backing-marijuana-legalization-campaign-ohio|accessdate=May 26, 2016|work=ESPN|agency=Associated Press|date=January 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The initiative sought exclusive grow rights for the group members while prohibiting all other cultivation except small amounts for personal use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Borchardt|first1=Jackie|title=What you need to know about Issue 3 -- Ohio's marijuana legalization measure|url=http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2015/09/what_you_need_to_know_about_is.html|accessdate=May 26, 2016|work=Northeast Ohio Media Group|date=September 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Robertson appeared in a television advertisement advocating for passage of the initiative,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Saker|first1=Anne|title=Deters, Big O star in pro-Issue 3 ads|url=http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2015/10/27/deters-stars-pro-issue-3-ad/74685124/|accessdate=May 26, 2016|work=The Cincinnati Enquirer|date=October 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was ultimately defeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Borchardt|first1=Jackie|title=Ohio marijuana legalization measure fails|url=http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2015/11/ohio_marijuana_legalization_me.html|accessdate=May 26, 2016|work=cleveland.com|date=November 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

Robertson is regarded as one of the greatest players in NBA history, a triple threat who could score inside, outside and also was a stellar playmaker. His rookie scoring average of [[List of National Basketball Association top rookie scoring averages|30.5 points per game]] is the third highest of any rookie in NBA history, and Robertson averaged more than 30 points per game in six of his first seven seasons.&lt;ref name="orstats"/&gt; Only three other players in the NBA have had more 30+ point per game seasons in their career. Robertson was the first player to average more than 10 assists per game, doing so at a time when the criteria for assists were more stringent than today.&lt;ref name="nbasummary"/&gt; Furthermore, Robertson is the first guard in NBA history to ever average more than 10 rebounds per game, doing so three times. It was a feat that would not be repeated until [[Russell Westbrook]] managed to achieve it during the [[2016–17 NBA season|2016–17 season]]. In addition to his 1964 regular season MVP award, Robertson won three All-Star Game MVPs in his career (in 1961, 1964, and 1969).  He ended his career with 26,710 points (25.7 per game, ninth-highest all time), 9,887 assists (9.5 per game) and 7,804 rebounds (7.5 per game).&lt;ref name="orstats" /&gt; He led the league in assists six times, and at the time of his retirement, he was the NBA's all-time leader in career assists and free throws made, and was the second all-time leading scorer behind Wilt Chamberlain.&lt;ref name="nbasummary"/&gt;

Robertson also set yardsticks in versatility. If his first five NBA seasons are strung together, Robertson averaged a triple-double over those, averaging 30.3 points, 10.4 rebounds and 10.6 assists.&lt;ref name="greatestpg"&gt;{{cite web |title=Daily Dime: Special Edition – The 10 Greatest Point Guards Ever |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/dailydime?page=dailydime-GreatestPointGuards |accessdate=2007-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For his career, Robertson had 181 triple-doubles, a record that has never been approached.&lt;ref name="tripledouble"&gt;{{cite web |last=Wojnarowski |first=Adrian |title=Making triple trouble |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/news?slug=aw-kidd111806&amp;prov=yhoo&amp;type=lgns |accessdate=2007-01-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These numbers are even more astonishing if it is taken into account that the three-point shot, which benefits sharpshooting backcourt players, did not exist when he played. In [[1967–68 NBA season|1967–68]], Robertson also became the first of only two players in NBA history to lead the league in both scoring average and assists per game in the same season (also achieved by [[Nate Archibald]]). The official scoring and assist titles went to other players that season, however, because the NBA based the titles on point and assist totals (not averages) prior to the [[1969–70 NBA season|1969–70 season]]. Robertson did, however, win a total of six NBA assist titles during his career. For his career, Robertson shot a high .485 field goal average and led the league in free-throw percentage twice—in the 1963–64 and 1967–68 seasons.&lt;ref name="orstats"/&gt;

Robertson is recognized by the NBA as the first legitimate "big guard", paving the way for other oversized backcourt players like [[Magic Johnson]].&lt;ref name="nbasummary"/&gt; Furthermore, he is also credited with having invented the head fake and the fadeaway jump shot, a shot which [[Michael Jordan]] later became famous for.&lt;ref name="espnflatter"&gt;{{cite web |last=Flatter |first=Ron |title=ESPN Classic – Oscar defined the triple-double |url=http://espn.go.com/classic/biography/s/Robertson_Oscar.html |accessdate=2007-01-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the Cincinnati Royals, now relocated and named the [[Sacramento Kings]], he scored 22,009 points and 7,731 assists, and is all-time leader in both statistics for the combined Royals/Kings teams.&lt;ref name="nbasummary"/&gt;
[[File:Oscar Robertson.png|thumb|Robertson at the ceremony announcing inclusion in the Old National Bank Sports Legends Avenue of Champions, at The Children's Museum of Indianapolis.]]
Robertson was enshrined in the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] on April 28, 1980. He received the "Player of the Century" award by the [[National Association of Basketball Coaches]] in 2000 and was ranked third on SLAM Magazine's Top 75 NBA Players in 2003, behind fellow NBA legends Michael Jordan and [[Wilt Chamberlain]]. Furthermore, in 2006, [[ESPN]] named Robertson the second greatest point guard of all time, praising him as the best post-up guard of all time and placing him only behind [[Los Angeles Lakers]] legend Magic Johnson.&lt;ref name="greatestpg" /&gt; In 2017, it was announced that a life-sized bronze sculpture of Robertson would be featured alongside other Indiana sports stars at [[The Children's Museum of Indianapolis]]' Old National Bank Sports Legends Avenue of Champions, located in the museum's sports park opening in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ibj.com/articles/65356-childrens-museum-unveils-sports-legends-for-new-outdoor-exhibit|title=Children's Museum unveils 'sports legends' for new outdoor exhibit|last=|first=|date=2017-09-12|work=Indiana Business Journal|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959, the Player of the Year Award was established to recognize the best college basketball player of the year by the [[United States Basketball Writers Association]]. Five nominees are presented and the individual with the most votes receives the award during the NCAA Final Four. In 1998, it was renamed the [[Oscar Robertson Trophy]] in honor of the player who won the first two awards because of his outstanding career and his continuing efforts to promote the game of basketball. In 2004, an 18" bronze statue of Robertson was sculpted by world-renowned sculptor [[Harry Weber (sculptor)|Harry Weber]].&lt;ref name="oscarrobertsontrophy"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Robertson is the son of Mazell and Bailey Robertson. He has two brothers, Bailey Jr. and Henry. He remembers a tough childhood, plagued by poverty and racism.&lt;ref name="autoindex"&gt;[http://www.thebigo.com/Autobiography/autobioIndex.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060531222823/http://www.thebigo.com/Autobiography/autobioIndex.html |date=May 31, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When a biography was going to be written about him in the 1990s, Robertson joked that his life had been "dull", and that he had been "married to the same woman for a long time".&lt;ref name="espnflatter"/&gt; In 1997, Robertson donated one of his kidneys to his daughter Tia, who suffered [[lupus erythematosus|lupus]]-related [[kidney failure]].&lt;ref name="espnflatter"/&gt;  He has been an honorary spokesman for the [[National Kidney Foundation]] ever since. In 2003, he published his own autobiography, ''The Big O: My Life, My Times, My Game''. Robertson also owns the chemical company Orchem, based in Cincinnati, Ohio.&lt;ref name="orchem"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Orchemcorp.com|title=Orchem Corporation |url=http://www.orchemcorp.com |accessdate=2008-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding basketball, Robertson has stated that legendary [[Harlem Globetrotters]] players [[Marques Haynes]] and "clown prince" [[Goose Tatum]] were his idols.&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt; Now in his seventies, he is long retired from playing basketball, although he still follows it on TV and attends most home games for the University of Cincinnati, his alma mater.  He now lists woodworking as his prime hobby.&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt; Robertson adds that he still could average a triple-double season in today's basketball, and that he is highly skeptical that anyone else could do it (it was later done by Russell Westbrook in the 2016–17 season). On June 9, 2007, Oscar received an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from the University of Cincinnati for both his philanthropic and entrepreneurial efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uc.edu/news/NR.asp?id=5627 |title=UC Legend Oscar Robertson to be Honored at Spring Commencement |publisher=Uc.edu |date=2007-10-04 |accessdate=2015-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018, Robertson auctioned off his 1971 championship ring, Hall of Fame ring, and one of his Milwaukee Bucks game jerseys.  Each item sold between $50,000 and $91,000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/24411321/oscar-robertson-1971-nba-title-ring-sells-91000&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Patrick Harpur''' (July 14, 1950; [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]], [[England]]) is an English writer. He lives in [[Dorset]], [[United Kingdom]]. He is best known for the work ''Daimonic Reality: A Field Guide to the Otherworld'' which deals with the [[paranormal]] in a similar way that [[Jacques Vallee]], [[Allen Hynek]] and [[John Keel]] have done in the past.

==Theories==
Harpur's topics deal with forteana and folklore, Daimonic Reality, traditions of Western religion—[[Alchemy]], [[Neoplatonism]], [[Hermeticism]], and [[Depth Psychology]].

In his book, ''Daimonic Reality'', Harpur argues that the human [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] extends beyond the confines of the physical human body, and that it may in fact be a part of our [[reality]]. He also notes that during most of human history, [[civilization]] has had another, "shadow reality" of [[folklore]], except the current society which is strongly attached to the material. The following is a quotation from ''Daimonic Reality'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Hitherto, I have taken "soul" to refer to two distinct, but unrelated, images. Firstly, soul is synonymous with the daimonic realm itself, the realm of Imagination, and is really an abbreviation for the collective ''[[Anima Mundi]]'', or World-Soul. Secondly, soul refers to whatever images the World-Soul itself uses to represent itself. Archetypally, this image is usually feminine and appears, for example, as a female daimon or goddess who, as Jung would say, "personifies the collective unconscious." Now the third use of "soul" refers to the image by which we, as individuals, are represented in the World-Soul.

      Traditional views of human nature have always allowed for (at least) two "souls" of the latter kind. In ancient Egypt, for instance, they were known as the ''ka'' and the ''ba''; in China, ''[[hun and p'o]]''. One of these souls inhabits the body and is the equivalent of what, ''faute de mieux'', we call the ego. I will call it the ''rational ego'' to distinguish it from the second soul, variously called, in other cultures, the shadow-soul, ghost-soul, death-soul, image-soul and dream-soul, for which our culture has either the word "soul" or else no word, because it is not generally believed to exist. However, it does exist and can be thought of as an ego, in the sense that it confers identity and individuality. It enables us, that is - like the rational ego - to say "I." But it is an ego, not of consciousness, but of the unconscious; not a waking, but a dream ego; not a rational ego, but an irrational ego. I will call it the ''daimonic ego''. Like the rational ego, it has a body - not a physical one but a dream-body, a "subtle" body such as daimons are imagined as having, an "astral" body as some esoteric doctrines say: in short, a daimonic body. 
&lt;ref&gt;[http://deoxy.org/soulbody.htm "Soul and Body" a chapter excerpted from ''Daimonic reality'' at deoxy.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His follow-up ''The Philosophers' Secret Fire: A History of the Imagination'' Harpur traces the evolution of the [[Imagination]] in the west, and how ideas of reality have been shaped over time using this faculty. Starting with the shamanistic traditions on to modern science. He claims that not only myths, poetry, and religions rely on the imagination for new concepts of reality to be created, but even modern scientific methods and models.

'''Phyllis Evalina Seckler''' (1917–2004), also known as '''Soror Meral''', was a ninth degree (IX°) member of the "Sovereign Sanctuary of the Gnosis" of [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] (O.T.O.), and a student of [[Jane Wolfe]], herself a student of [[Aleister Crowley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last  = Starr | first = Martin P. | title = The Unknown God: W. T. Smith and the Thelemites| year  = 2003 | publisher = Teitan Press |location = Bolingbrook, Illinois |isbn = 0-933429-07-X |ref=Starr }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Under her pen name '''Soror Meral''', Seckler was Master of 418 Lodge of O.T.O. in California from its inception in 1979 until her death.&lt;ref name="Thelemapedia.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Thelemapedia: Phyllis Seckler |url=http://www.thelemapedia.org/index.php/Phyllis_Seckler|website=Thelemapedia.org
|accessdate=2011-02-01|date=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also founder of the College of Thelema; and co-founder (with Anna-Kria King and James A. Eshelman) of the Temple of Thelema, both of which organizations she also led until her death.  Prior to her death, she also warranted the founding of the International College of Thelema (formerly known as the College of Thelema of Northern California) as an autonomous continuation of her work, as well as the Temple of the Silver Star (the initiatory Order within the International College of Thelema.)  She was a writer for and editor of ''In the Continuum'', the journal of the College of Thelema, for nearly 25 years.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

For a brief period in the 1970s, she was married to [[Grady McMurtry]]. It was as a result of a 1968 letter from Seckler that McMurtry (Frater Hymenaeus Alpha) invoked his "emergency powers" to reconstitute Ordo Templi Orientis, which had flagged following the death of [[Aleister Crowley|Aleister Crowley's]] successor as Outer Head of the Order, [[Karl Germer]].  It was under their combined leadership that O.T.O. was incorporated under [[California]] law  and began to grow in North America for the first time since Crowley's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5497">'''Sir Sagramore''' of Hungary (or '''Sagremor''') is a [[Knights of the Round Table|Knight]] of the [[Round Table (Camelot)|Round Table]] in the [[Arthurian legend]]. His characterization varies from story to story, though he is surprisingly prolific; he appears in a number of early stories, such as [[Chrétien de Troyes]]' works, and he turns up in all the cyclical versions. He gains a number of nicknames, including "The Impetuous" and "le Desirous."  Generally he is characterized as a [[virtue|virtuous]] but hot-tempered knight who fights fiercely and ragefully.

==Lancelot-Grail==
According to the [[Lancelot-Grail]] Cycle, Sagramore is the son of the King of Hungary and the daughter of the [[List of Byzantine Emperors|Eastern Roman Emperor]]; he is even an heir to the throne of [[Constantinople]]. His father dies while he was still young, and his mother accepts the proposal of King Brandegoris of Estangore in [[Sub-Roman Britain|Britain]]. When he is fifteen, Sagramore travels to Britain to join them and to become one of [[King Arthur]]'s knights. Upon arrival in Britain Sagramore engages Arthur's [[Saxons|Saxon]] enemies, and receives aid from Arthur's nephew [[Gawain]] and his brothers. The group are subsequently knighted by Arthur.

The Lancelot-Grail describes him as a good knight, but quick to anger. When fighting, he would go into a frenzy not unlike the Irish hero [[Cúchulainn]]'s [[warp spasm]]; when he came down, he would feel ill and hungry. As he was wont to do, [[Sir Kay]] gave him a nickname, "Morte Jeune" (dead youth), because he would sometimes go into [[epilepsy]]-like fits. The Lancelot-Grail recounts a number of his adventures, often centered around rescuing damsels, and mentions that he had a daughter by one of his paramours who was raised at Arthur's court by [[Guinevere]]. His half-sister, Brandegoris' beautiful daughter Claire, falls in love with [[Sir Bors]] and sleeps with him; their child is [[Elyan the White]]. He dies by [[Mordred]]'s hand at the [[Battle of Camlann]] as one of Arthur's last remaining warriors.

==Other stories==
The [[Post-Vulgate Cycle]] contains a different backstory for Sagramore. His family rescues Mordred from the sea (afraid of [[Merlin]]'s prophecy that a child born on [[May Day]] will destroy him, Arthur sends children born that day out on a leaky boat) and raises him for the next several years as Sagramore's stepbrother.

In the [[Prose Tristan|Prose ''Tristan'']], Sagramore is portrayed as a great friend to the [[Cornwall|Cornish]] knight [[Tristan]], and even alerts the rest of the Round Table to his death.

In Sir [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', Sagramore's prowess varies from situation to situation; he usually serves to lose jousts to better knights, but at times he is a valiant fighter. He is also the subject of a fragmentary [[German language|German]] romance, ''Segremors'', the surviving portions of which describe his journey to an island ruled by a [[fairy|fay]] and his undesired combat with his friend Gawain.

In the 16th-century Portuguese novel ''Triunfos de Sagramor'' ("Triumphs of Sagramore") or ''Memorial das Proezas da Segunda Távola Redonda'' ("Memorial of the Deeds of the Second Round Table"), by [[playwright]] Jorge Ferreira de Vasconcelos, Sagramore and [[List of legendary kings of Britain|legendary British king]] [[Constantine (Briton)|Constantine III]] are fused into a single person, ''Sagramor Constantino'', portrayed as the heir to Arthur, who forms a new Round Table to fight the Saxons and keep the glory of Arthurian Britain&lt;ref&gt;[http://ler.letras.up.pt/uploads/ficheiros/3762.pdf Os livros de cavalarias renascentistas nas histórias da literatura portuguesa], Aurelio Vargas Díaz-Toledo&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cvc.instituto-camoes.pt/conhecer/biblioteca-digital-camoes/estudos-literarios-critica-literaria/30-30/file.html A novelística portuguesa do século XVI], Ettore Finazzi-Agró, Lisbon, ''Instituto de Cultura Portuguesa'', 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern fiction==
Sagramore appears with some regularity in modern Arthurian literature and other fiction. 
* In [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]]'s "Merlin and Vivien", one of the ''[[Idylls of the King]]'', he stumbles into bed with a maiden, thinking he is in his own room; to save their reputation the two strangers wed, but their purity and goodness make their marriage a happy one. 
* [[Mark Twain]] characterized Sagramore (as "Sir Sagramor le Desirous") as an angry, backwards knight in ''[[A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court]]'' (portrayed by [[William Bendix]] in the [[A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (1949 film)|1949 film version]]), who challenges the Yankee to a duel to the death and is defeated by the Yankee's modern weaponry; his armor, later displayed in a museum featuring a gunshot hole inflicted by the Yankee, serves as a setpiece to the start of the story. 
* The knight appears in the musical ''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]'' and was played by [[Peter Bromilow]] in the [[Camelot (film)|film version]]. 
* In [[Bernard Cornwell]]'s ''[[The Winter King (novel)|The Winter King]]'', "Sagramor" is a fierce [[Numidia]]n veteran of the old Roman army, and follows Arthur to Britain after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire.

She is the founding director of the [[Belize Zoo|Belize Zoo and Tropical Education Center]], a [[zoo]] which was started in 1983 to protect native animals that had been used in a [[documentary film]] in [[Belize]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;http://www.bfbs-radio.com/pages/extranet/sharon-matola-i-1303.php, BFBS radio presenters, Sharon Matola, Retrieved September 6, 2010.{{dead link|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Belize zoo==

Matola, the founder and driving force behind Belize's first [[zoo]], arrived in that country after a colorful career that included a stint with a Romanian lion-tamer and a [[circus]] tour through Mexico.

Matola was hired by filmmaker [[Richard Foster (filmmaker)|Richard Foster]] in 1982 to care for 20 animals being used in the making of a wildlife documentary film. When shooting of the film was completed, she was left to decide how to dispose of the animals. Many of them were too tame for life in the wild, so the idea of an unusual zoo cropped up. Matola hung signs around the country to raise awareness about the wealth of Belizean wildlife and the country's deteriorating habitat; and she went outside Belize to raise money from [[environmental groups]].&lt;ref&gt;Discovery Channel. Ed. Huw Hennessy: "Insight Guide Belize." Insight Print Services (Pte) Ltd., 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The zoo is now home to over 125 native species, and instructs people about Belize's wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;Maynard, Caitlin and Thane: "Rainforests and Reefs: A Kid's Eye View of the Tropics." Zoological Society of Cincinnati, Inc., 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other environmental work ==

Matola fought to stop Belize's [[Chalillo Dam]] project. Her struggle was documented in the book ''The Last Flight of the Scarlet Macaw: One Woman's Fight to Save the World's Most Beautiful Bird'' (2008), by [[Bruce Barcott]].

She's also been a contributor to [[BFBS]] Radio in Belize since 1992, starting with a popular wildlife series called "Walk on the Wildside", in which she explored the lives of Belize's flora and fauna.  She now freelances for the BFBS.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

General '''Sir John Doyle, 1st Baronet''' [[Order of the Bath|GCB]], [[Royal Guelphic Order|KCH]] (1756{{spaced ndash}}8 August 1834) was an officer in the [[British Army]], which he joined in March 1771.  He served with distinction in the [[American War of Independence]] and the [[French Revolutionary Wars]].&lt;ref name="BBC1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DoyleClan"/&gt;

He was elected Member of Parliament for [[Mullingar (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Mullingar]] in the [[Irish House of Commons]] in 1783, and went on to serve as [[Secretary of War]] in the Irish administration of [[Dublin Castle]].&lt;ref name="BBC1"/&gt;

Doyle raised his own regiment, the [[87th (Royal Irish Fusiliers) Regiment of Foot]], for the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in 1793 and served in [[Holland]], [[Gibraltar]] and [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name="BBC1"/&gt;

His efforts were greatly appreciated by [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]], who took the trouble to write to the [[Earl Marshall]], "... so that his [Doyle's] zeal and exertions in our service may be known to posterity".&lt;ref name="DoyleClan"/&gt;

The latter part of his career included his appointment as [[Private Secretary]] to [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] the [[Prince of Wales]]. He was also appointed [[Lieutenant Governor of Guernsey]] in 1803 where he served until 1813. He was also active in Guernsey as Deputy Grand Master of the [[Freemasons]].&lt;ref name="FreeM"&gt;[http://www.freemasonry.london.museum/showcase/the-doyle-cup/. London Freemasonry – The Doyle cup]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was appointed [[Knight Bachelor]] in 1813 and General in 1819.&lt;ref name="BBC1"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/guernsey/content/articles/2009/03/12/sir_john_doyle_feature.shtml BBC Guernsey – Profile of General Sir John Doyle]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DoyleClan"&gt;[http://www.doyle.com.au/history_pt6.htm Doyle Clan History, part 6.

==Personal life==
John Doyle was born in [[Dublin]] in 1756, the fourth son of Charles and Elizabeth Doyle of Bramblestown, County Kilkenny.  He entered [[Trinity College Dublin]] in July 1768 to study law, but when his father died in March 1771 he joined the army in March 1771.&lt;ref name="DictofIrshBio"&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary of Irish Biography|year=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|url=http://dib.cambridge.org/viewReadPage.do?articleId=a2754|author=Murphy, David|editor=James Mcguire, James Quin|accessdate=18 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doyle was the uncle of women's political rights campaigner [[Anna Wheeler (author)|Anna Wheeler]], previously Doyle, who in 1812 took her daughters to stay with him and his family in Guernsey, having walked out on her husband in [[County Limerick]].&lt;ref name="WomenPhil"&gt;[https://archive.is/20130105082841/http://www.women-philosophers.com/Anna-Doyle-Wheeler.html Biography of Anna Wheeler at Women philosophers.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military career==
Doyle started his military career in March 1771 when he purchased an [[Ensign (rank)|ensigncy]]&lt;ref name="Bio1806"&gt;{{cite book |title=Biographical Sketch of the Honourable Lieutenant General Sir John Doyle |publisher=T Greenslade, Guernsey |date=1 November 1806}}&lt;/ref&gt; and joined the [[48th (Northamptonshire) Regiment of Foot]]. He purchased a promotion and rose to the rank of Lieutenant in 1773.&lt;ref name="BBC1"/&gt;

===American War of Independence===

Doyle transferred to the [[40th (2nd Somersetshire) Regiment of Foot]] on its being ordered overseas, where he served with distinction in the [[American War of Independence]] (1775–1783). Serving as lieutenant of light cavalry at Boston he became Adjutant to the battalion. He was involved in the [[Battle of Long Island]] in August 1776, where he recovered the body of his commanding officer, [[Order of battle of the Battle of Long Island|Lieutenant-Colonel James Grant]], under enemy fire.&lt;ref name=Bio1806/&gt;{{rp|5}} He then fought at the [[Battle of Harlem Heights]], In 1777 he fought at the [[Battle of Brandywine]] and [[Battle of Germantown]] (where he was wounded).&lt;ref name=Bio1806/&gt;{{rp|6}}

His wound changed the course of his American campaign because he was appointed to assist Lord Rawdon ([[Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings]]) to raise the [[Volunteers of Ireland]] regiment (also known as 2nd American Regiment and which would shortly become a regular unit, the 105th Regiment of Foot), and wherein he was promoted to [[Captain (land)|Captain]]. This unit then fought at the [[Battle of Monmouth Courthouse]] in 1778, and now appointed and acting Major of Brigade moved with the Regiment to South Carolina participating in the [[Siege of Charleston]] in 1780,&lt;ref name="BBC1"/&gt; before being mentioned in dispatches after fighting at the [[Battle of Camden]].&lt;ref name=Bio1806/&gt;{{rp|7}} He also fought at the [[Battle of Springfield (1780)|Battle of Springfield]].

Following the peace in America in 1782 Captain Doyle returned to Ireland, entering politics.

===French Revolutionary Wars===

Following [[French Revolutionary Wars|France declaring war on Great Britain]], in September 1793, Doyle raised his own regiment, the [[87th (Royal Irish Fusiliers) Regiment of Foot|87th (The Prince of Wales's Irish) Regiment]];&lt;ref name=Bio1806/&gt;{{rp|16}} they were also known as ''The Prince of Wales Irish Heroes''.&lt;ref name="BBC1"/&gt;

Raised in rank to brevet [[Colonel]], he led the unit under the Duke of York in the [[Flanders Campaign]] 1793–1795. He served at the [[Siege of Valenciennes (1793)|siege of Valenciennes]] 13 June-28 July 1793 and distinguished himself at Alost during [[Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings|Moira]]'s retreat 1794 where he was wounded in a cavalry action, needing to return to Britain to recover. His Regiment, sent in his absence, to [[Bergen op Zoom]] where the Catholic town promptly surrendered to the French, making the whole Regiment prisoners of war.&lt;ref name=Bio1806/&gt;{{rp|18–9}}

Returning to Ireland he was appointed head of the war department and from 1796 until 1799 as Secretary of War. The release of his Regiment as prisoners saw Doyle appointed Colonel of the 87th Foot on 3 May 1796.

Appointed a brevet [[Brigadier-General]] he was appointed in charge of the land forces in the proposed assault on the [[Texel]] in October 1796 with the hope of destroying the Dutch fleet, however storms resulted in the ships abandoning the attempt.&lt;ref name=Bio1806/&gt;{{rp|21}} Brigadier General Doyle was then ordered to Gibraltar, however on his way to the port of embarkation was attacked by highwaymen and badly wounded twice. Having recovered, he proceeded to join the staff in Gibraltar.&lt;ref name=Bio1806/&gt;{{rp|21–2}}

Costing considerable sums of money, he managed to persuade, through eloquence, the Island to pay for these costs, as the Islands were in imminent danger of invasion from France.&lt;ref name=Bio1806/&gt;{{rp|33}}

Doyle actively organised the defence in the [[Bailiwick of Guernsey]], he oversaw the draining of land at [[Braye du Valle, Guernsey|Braye du Valle]] to connect the tidal north of the island to the main island, using the proceeds of the sale of the land to pay for the construction of military quality roads.&lt;ref name=Bio1806/&gt;{{rp|39–40}} He organised three [[Martello tower]]s to be built, including [[Fort Grey]], to supplement the existing [[Guernsey loophole towers]], progressing and completing [[Fort George, Guernsey|Fort George]].

In addition he improved, in a like manner, the defences of [[Alderney]].&lt;ref name=Bio1806/&gt;{{rp|38}}

==Public administration and diplomacy==

Doyle was 'Deputy Grand Master' of the 'Orange Lodge 116' of the [[Freemasons]].

Born in the village of [[Cerovec Stanka Vraza|Cerovec]] in [[Lower Styria]], [[Austrian Empire]] (today in [[Slovenia]]), Vraz was one of the most important figures of the [[Illyrian Movement]] in the [[Kingdom of Croatia and Slavonia]].&lt;ref&gt;Baynes,Thomas Spencer. ''The Encyclopædia Britannica''. Vol. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first Croatian to earn his living as a professional writer. He wrote poems and travelogues and collected folk poems. He also translated foreign literature into [[Croatian language|Croatian]].

While in [[Samobor]], he met Julijana "Ljubica" Cantilly, the niece of his friend and colleague, [[Ljudevit Gaj]].&lt;ref&gt;Stančić, Nikša. Gajeva "''Još Horvatska ni propala" iz 1832–33: ideologija Ljudovita Gaja u pripremnom razdoblju hrvatskog narodnog preporoda''. Globus, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; She served as his muse, and he wrote and dedicated many poems and works to her.

Stanko Vraz died in [[Zagreb]] in 1851.

In 1842, he and two of his other contributors founded ''[[Kolo (magazine)|Kolo]]'', one of Croatia's first literary magazines.&lt;ref&gt;Kann, Robert A. ''A History of the Habsburg Empire, 1526–1918''. Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine, as well as his works, were influenced by [[national romanticism]].

Regarding the [[Slovene language]], Vraz's most notable work is the work ''Narodne pesmi ilirske, koje se pevaju po Štajerskoj, Kranjskoj, Koruškoj i zapadnoj strani Ugarske'' (Illyrian Folk Songs Sung in [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]], [[Carniola]], [[Carinthia (duchy)|Carinthia]] and the Western Part of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]]). It contains folk songs and art songs in Slovene, accompanied by comments in Croatian. These songs are the first Slovene texts in [[Gaj's Latin Alphabet]]. This orthography was already used at the time by [[Croats]] and spread among Slovenes a few years later. Vraz created numerous poems in Slovene but for the most part they have never been published.

He also translated works of [[Lord Byron]] and [[Adam Mickiewicz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pomurski-muzej.si/izobrazevanje/gradiva-pomurja/gradivo/prevajalci |title=Prevajalci Pomurja in Porabja |language=Slovenian |trans-title=The Translators of the Mura Region and the Raba Valley |publisher=Murska Sobota Regional Museum |first=Franc |last=Kuzmič |date=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Coles''' is a colloquial term referring to Corey Cole and Lori Ann Cole, a husband and wife team who are both game designers.  While they are most well known working together designing the ''[[Quest for Glory]]'' series, both are notable separately for designing games and (in the case of [[programmer]] Corey Cole) [[game engine]]s independently of each other.

They formed Far Studio, which was the developer of ''[[Shannara (video game)|Shannara]]''&lt;ref name="Adventure Classic Gaming"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adventureclassicgaming.com/index.php/site/interviews/208/ |title=Lori Ann Cole - Interview |accessdate=2012-10-27 |date=2003-09-08 |publisher=[[Adventure Classic Gaming]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is now used for art and web development.&lt;ref name="mixnmojo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mixnmojo.com/news/Hero-U-is-a-Kickstarter-for-a-new-RPG-Adventure-Hybrid |title=Hero-U is a Kickstarter for a new RPG-Adventure Hybrid |publisher=[[The International House of Mojo]] |date=2012-10-28 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also formed a studio called Transolar Entertainment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.igda.org/summit/speakers/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704065051/http://www.igda.org/summit/speakers/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-07-04 |publisher=[[International Game Developers Association]] |accessdate=2013-07-14 |title=IGDA Summit 2013 Speakers }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is the developer of the upcoming [[adventure game|adventure]] [[video role-playing game|RPG]] [[Hero-U: Rogue to Redemption]].&lt;ref name="mixnmojo" /&gt;

==Corey Cole==
'''Corey Cole''' is an American game designer, programmer, and writer who co-created various iterations of the [[Sierra Creative Interpreter|SCI engine]], co-designed the first four games in the ''[[Quest for Glory|Quest for Glory series]]'' with his wife, and designed and directed ''[[Castle of Dr. Brain]]''.

===Biography===
Corey Cole is an avid ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' fan, playing the game for 10 years before joining [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra]], and ultimately selling one [[role-playing game|role-playing]] module to [[Judges Guild]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adventuregamers.com/articles/view/17520 |title=Corey Cole Interview |accessdate=2012-10-29 |date=2002-05-20 |publisher=[[Adventure Gamers]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time he and his wife, Lori Cole published ''The Spell Book'', a role-playing game newsletter.  They ran fantasy campaigns for years that had a unique rule system that later became the core of their ''Quest for Glory'' games.&lt;ref name="NYPost"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/gamereport/interview_with_cori_cole_creator_fo3JcablCc214MdZhtEh1M |title=Interview with Corey Cole, creator of Quest for Glory, on upcoming Kickstarter: Hero U |date=2012-10-18 |accessdate=2012-10-27 |publisher=[[New York Post]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130207163851/http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/gamereport/interview_with_cori_cole_creator_fo3JcablCc214MdZhtEh1M |archivedate=2013-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career at Sierra===
Corey Cole started his programming career at [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra On-line]] in 1988, porting the [[Sierra Creative Interpreter|SCI engine]] to [[Atari ST]].  He later co-programmed new iterations the SCI engine for use in many Sierra games during much of his tenure at Sierra.

He began his career as a game developer, alongside his wife Lori Ann Cole, with ''[[Quest for Glory: So You Want to Be a Hero|Hero's Quest]]'' (which was later renamed ''Quest for Glory'') in 1989.  He wasn't credited as co-developer of the game, but he was acknowledged as such by the games industry.  ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' recognized both Corey Cole and Lori Ann Cole as the game's designers when they awarded ''Hero's Quest'' the Adventure Game of the Year award.&lt;ref name = "CGWaward"&gt;{{Cite news | date = September 1990 | periodical = [[Computer Gaming World]] | title = Computer Gaming World's 1990 Game of the Year Awards | pages = 70 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He and his wife were co-designers of the next three games in the ''Quest for Glory'' series as well.

He designed the puzzle adventure game ''[[Castle of Dr. Brain]]'', the first game in the [[Dr. Brain|''Dr. Brain'' series]], in 1991.  The series is notable for being Sierra's only property to be licensed for use in television, as the [[Children's Television Workshop]] licensed it for use in their programming on December 9, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/SIERRA+ON-LINE+INC.+SIGNS+LICENSING+AGREEMENT+WITH+CHILDREN'S...-a014703639 |title=Sierra On-Line Inc.

After briefly leaving Sierra in 1996 due to issues with management, he returned to work on ''[[Quest for Glory V: Dragon Fire|Quest for Glory V]]'', which was released in 1998.  Corey did not take a development role on the game, but he did serve as a programmer.  That same year, a photograph of his face was used as a head shot for a character in ''[[Police Quest: SWAT 2]]''.  Corey's final role at Sierra was as a programmer on ''[[Hoyle Casino]]''. which was released in 2000.

==Lori Ann Cole==
'''Lori Ann Cole''' is an American game designer, director and writer who co-designed the first four ''[[Quest for Glory]]'' series with her husband, designed ''[[Quest for Glory V: Dragon Fire]]'', and designed and directed ''[[Mixed-Up Fairy Tales]]''.  She is also a voice actor, voicing Queen Isabella in ''[[King's Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder!]]''.

===Biography===
Cole's varied background includes elementary education, film animation, and writing. She is a fanatic [[role-playing video game]] player who became involved in game designing because of her husband's involvement in [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra On-line]].

===Career at Sierra===
Lori Ann Cole co-designed the ''Quest for Glory'' series with her husband Corey Cole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-10-23-quest-for-glory-creators-take-to-kickstarter-with-hero-u-rogue-to-redemption |title=Quest for Glory creators take to Kickstarter with Hero U: Rogue to Redemption | date=2012-10-23 | accessdate=2012-10-27 |publisher=[[Eurogamer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She was the sole designer of the final chapter, ''Quest for Glory V'', although her husband was a programmer for that game.

She was also the designer of the second and final game in Sierra's ''Mixed-Up'' children's adventure game series, ''[[Mixed-Up Fairy Tales]]''.  While at Sierra, she also was a voice actor, voicing Queen Isabella in the [[CD-ROM]] version of ''King's Quest V''.

After briefly leaving Sierra in 1996 due to issues with management, she returned as the sole designer of ''Quest for Glory V'', which was released in 1998.  That same year, a photograph of her face was used as a head shot for a character in ''[[SWAT series#Police Quest: SWAT2|SWAT 2]]''.

===Games===

*{{vgy|1990}} ''[[Quest for Glory II: Trial by Fire]]'' - co-designer, FACS Manual Writer (Sierra)

*{{vgy|1998}} ''[[Police Quest: SWAT 2]]'' - photograph model for a character (Sierra)
*{{vgy|2018}} ''[[Hero-U: Rogue to Redemption]]'' - co-designer (Transolar Games)

==Far Studio/Transolar Games==
Since Sierra didn't give the ''[[Quest for Glory V: Dragon Fire|Quest for Glory V]]'' team the budget and time that the Coles felt the game needed, they decided to create games for other publishers.  As a result, they formed FAR Productions and created ''[[Shannara (game)|Shannara]]'' for [[Legend Entertainment]] in 1995.&lt;ref name="Adventure Classic Gaming"/&gt;

In 2003, Corey and Lori decided to make a game based on a book that she was co-writing that was never published called ''How to Be a Hero''.  After losing the website{{why|date=August 2016}} named after the book after running it for three years, they decided to rename the idea ''School of Heroes''.  They originally planned to make the game a text adventure, which Corey programmed using [[Inform]], but they were not satisfied with the feel of the game and put it aside.  At the same time, they decided to create a website to pre-promote the book.  Corey programmed the interactive parts of the site, which would automise the original ''How to Be A Hero'' website's theme of allowing users to become "students" and complete "assignments". They planned to expand the site into a full interactive game, but those ideas never materialized.&lt;ref name="NYPost" /&gt;

In late 2011, the Coles decided to stop taking assignments at ''School of Heroes'' and instead make the idea into a game.  On October 19, 2012, after the success from successful projects by fellow Sierra alumni and at the encouragement of fans, Lori Ann and Corey Cole launched a Kickstarter for 2D adventure RPG based on that idea, ''Hero-U: Rogue to Redemption''.  Since Far Studio is now used for art and web design, development is being overseen by The Cole's other development company, Transolar Games.&lt;ref name="mixnmojo" /&gt;

==Recognition==
''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' awarded Corey and Lori Ann Cole (and producer Guruka Singh Khalsa) the Adventure Game of the Year award for ''[[Quest for Glory: So You Want to Be a Hero|Hero's Quest]]'' in 1990.&lt;ref name = "CGWaward" /&gt;

'''The Four Musketeers''', ({{lang-fr|Les Quatre Mousquetaires}}) after a popular 1920s [[The Three Musketeers (1921 film)|film adaptation]] of [[Alexandre Dumas, père|Alexandre Dumas']] [[The Three Musketeers|classic]],&lt;ref name="Bowers"&gt;Chris Bowers, [http://www.daviscup.com/en/news/articles/the-new-musketeers.aspx "The New Musketeers"], ''Davis Cup News'', February 27, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; were [[French people|French]] [[tennis]] players who dominated the game in the second half of the 1920s and early 1930s, winning 20 [[Grand Slam in tennis|Grand Slam]] titles and 23 Grand Slam doubles.&lt;ref name="Tandon"&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/aus09/columns/story?columnist=tandon_kamakshi&amp;id=3851105 "French foursome remains fearsome"], ''[[ESPN|ESPN.com]]'', January 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Grasso|2011|pp=104–105|ps=}} They also led France to six straight [[Davis Cup]] wins, 1927–32, in an era when Cup matches enjoyed a prestige similar to today's [[FIFA World Cup]] finals. At its creation in 1927, the tournament that would later be known as [[French Open]]'s trophy was named the ''[[Coupe des Mousquetaires]]'' in honour of the quartet.&lt;ref name="Bowers"/&gt;

==The Musketeers==
The Musketeers were:

*[[René Lacoste]] (1904–1996){{sfnp|Grasso|2011|p=167|ps=}}

While Brugnon was primarily a doubles specialist, Borotra, Cochet, and Lacoste won many singles titles. Between them, they won three [[US Open (tennis)|United States Championships]] at [[West Side Tennis Club|Forest Hills]], six consecutive [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] titles from 1924 through 1929, and 10 titles in 11 years at the [[French Championships]], 1922 through 1932 (up to and including 1924, though, the tournament was only open to members of French tennis clubs, therefore wasn't a major tournament until 1925).{{sfnp|Wilson|2014|p=80–87|ps=}} From 1926 until 1930 a musketeer, Lacoste or Cochet, was ranked No. 1 in the world and in 1926 and 1927 all four musketeers were ranked in the top-10.&lt;ref name=collins&gt;{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Bud|authorlink=Bud Collins|title=The Bud Collins History of Tennis|year=2010|publisher=New Chapter Press|location=[New York]|isbn=978-0942257700|page=716|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The only player capable of challenging their dominance was the great American [[Bill Tilden]] ([[World number one male tennis player rankings|world number-one]] from 1920 until 1926, when Lacoste took over the position). The Musketeers were finally eclipsed by the arrival of [[Ellsworth Vines]], [[Fred Perry]] and [[Jack Crawford (tennis)|Jack Crawford]] on the international tennis scene in the first half of the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17029176 |title=French Tennis. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=2 December 1933  |page=15 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The success of The Four Musketeers in winning the [[1927 International Lawn Tennis Challenge|1927 Davis Cup]] against the United States was directly responsible for the decision by the [[French Tennis Federation]] to build the [[Stade Roland Garros|Roland Garros]] venue at Porte d'Auteuil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roland-Garros – History of the Stadium|url=http://www.rolandgarros.com/en_FR/rg_year_round/201408271409194686687.html|website=www.rolandgarros.com|publisher=[[French Tennis Federation]] (FFT)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four men were national icons in France and all of them lived to be at least 83 years old, basking in glory for many years after their retirement from tennis. They were simultaneously inducted into the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] in Newport, Rhode Island, in 1976.

{{About|the Cajun/Creole healer}}
In Louisiana, the term '''traiteur''' (sometimes spelled ''treateur'') describes a man or woman (a ''traiteuse'') who practises what is sometimes called [[faith healing]]. A '''traiteur''' is Native Creole healer or a  traditional healer of the French-speaking [[Houma Tribe]], whose primary method of treatment involves using the [[laying on of hands]]. An important part of Creole folk religion, the traiteur combines [[Catholic]] prayer and medicinal remedies. They are called to treat a variety of ailments, including:  [[earache]]s, [[toothache]]s, [[wart]]s, [[tumor]]s, [[angina]], and [[bleeding]]. In the past, they substituted for trained physicians in remote rural areas of [[Acadiana]]. Most traiteurs  consider their healing abilities a gift from God, and therefore refuse to accept payment in exchange for their services.

Traiteurism is a very old tradition that is dying out, and very few traiteurs now exist. Traditionally, the rituals of the traiteur are passed down to the opposite gender. So a male must pass it down to a female, and vice versa. The traiteur must be asked to perform the treatments and will rarely offer them outright unless the need is great, and they can not ask for a payment of any kind, although it is acceptable to accept gifts for treating a person. However gifts for a true traiteur are never required.

In Southern Louisiana, the co-existence of conventional medicine and traiteurs offers patients a range of resources for treating illness. Traiteurs and their patients do not view the two systems as conflicting. For example, if treating someone with a Coup-de-Soleil, or sunstroke, one would perform the ritual, then have the patient drink as much water as they could while lying down and then wiping the patient with a towel dampened in cool water. When a traiteur becomes ill, he goes to the doctor, yet he also employs week-long ceremonial candles (which are highly commercialized), Catholic [[Novenas]] (a Catholic rite involving nine days or weeks of recitation of a series of prayers), native traditional herbs, and perhaps a visit by another traiteur to get well. Some will use herbal remedies if they are known, the herbal remedies begin to cross over into [[Louisiana Voodoo|voodoo]] being that both originated with the Creole people. Switching from one healing system to another is common among these practitioners and their patients, whose religious syncretism is matched by [[syncretism]] among medical systems. Another example of this fluidity is evident in the language with which the patients label their illnesses. Lousay A., a healer, is shown at his weekly home "clinic" hours one Saturday treating patients. One woman describes her condition as ''la mal angle'', Louisiana French for [[shingles]], while another woman explains that she has ''herpes zoster," the medical term for the virus. Even in language, the traditional and the biomedical is heard to exist side by side without conflict.

The rituals involved with traiteurism are simple and time-honored, and they are careful to not transgress the teachings of the Catholic Church. The methods of the traiteurs are purported to be able to work on a person regardless of faith, should one be so moved as to ask for a treatment.

==In popular culture==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
* In the ''[[Band of Brothers (TV miniseries)|Band of Brothers]]'' episode "Bastogne", Cajun medic Eugene Roe tells fellow medic Ralph Spina that his grandmother was a traiteuse. This detail was invented for the show and has no basis in the real Eugene Roe's family history.
* A video game of the same name is being created by Raconteur Games, though it does not specifically focus on Cajun folklore.

He left the 7th Dragoon Guards in March 1903 to become Assistant Quartermaster-General of the [[II Corps (United Kingdom)|II Corps]] ([[British Commands and Army groups|Southern Command]]), being promoted to full colonel. In May 1905, he went to the Northern Command as colonel in charge of cavalry records and staff officer for the [[Imperial Yeomanry]].&lt;ref name="tms7"/&gt;  He was made a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27926|supp=y|page=4460|date=1906-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on half-pay in March 1907 and retired a year later.&lt;ref name="tms7"/&gt;

==Easter Rising==
On the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]] in 1914, Lowe rejoined the army as Inspector of Cavalry, and was appointed as a Brigade Commander with rank of [[Brigadier-General]] in 1915.&lt;ref name="who701"/&gt; He was commander of the 3rd Reserve Cavalry Brigade, stationed at the [[Curragh Camp]], at the outbreak of the [[Easter Rising]] on Monday, 24 April 1916.  On being informed of the Rising by phone, he ordered the brigade to Dublin by train.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Easter Rising 1916: Birth of the Irish Republic |last=McNally |first=Michael |authorlink= |author2=Peter Dennis  |year=2007 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |location= |isbn=978-1-84603-067-3 |pages=20, 47 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X_LY5lZ62w8C}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Arriving himself at [[Dublin Heuston railway station|Kingsbridge railway station]] in the early hours of Tuesday morning, Lowe assumed command of British forces in Dublin and set about securing the line between the station, [[Dublin Castle]] and [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]], thus dividing the rebel positions north and south of the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Easter 1916: The Irish Rebellion |last=Townshend |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles Townshend (historian) |year=2006 |publisher=Penguin Books |location=London |isbn=978-0-14-101216-2 |page=186 |pages= |url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=xZzIAQAACAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was Lowe who ordered the shelling of [[Liberty Hall]] by field guns from Trinity College, and who ordered the Sherwood Foresters to continue advancing on Mount Street Bridge with a high cost in casualties.&lt;ref&gt;McNally 2007, pp. 68, 71&lt;/ref&gt;  On Saturday, 29 April, after being approached by Nurse [[Elizabeth O'Farrell]], he agreed to negotiate with the leaders only if they would [[Unconditional surrender|surrender unconditionally]], and at 2.30 pm that day, accompanied by Nurse O'Farrell, [[Patrick Pearse]] surrendered to Lowe.&lt;ref&gt;McNally 2007, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

He was awarded the honorary rank of major-general when he finally retired in March 1919.&lt;ref name="tms7"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Lowe married, in 1895, Frances Broster (died 29 September 1942), the widow of Captain Robert Harry Johnson of the 64th Foot Regiment and daughter of Francisco de Salvo, of Salerno, Sicily.&lt;ref&gt;''Genealogists' Magazine'', vol.27, no.7, Society of Genealogists, London, 2002, pps:332-326, "Another Englishman Abroad - John Loder and Hedy Lamarr" by Charles Kidd, editor of ''Debrett's Peerage &amp; Baronetage''.&lt;/ref&gt;  They had a son, and a daughter Elizabeth, who became a nun. Their son, [[John Loder (actor)|John]], was a British Army officer who with his father also took part in the suppression of the Rising and accepting the surrender of Pearse&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/easterrising/gallery/gallery06.shtml BBC, 1916 Easter Rising Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt; —fought at [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]] and [[Battle of the Somme|the Somme]] and subsequently became a Hollywood actor under the screen name John Loder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irishplayography.com/search/play.asp?play_id=2401 |title=Hedy Lamarr and the Easter Rising |accessdate=2009-03-30 |work= |publisher=Irish Theatre Institute |date=17 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  General Lowe died in [[London]] on 7 February 1944, aged 82.
