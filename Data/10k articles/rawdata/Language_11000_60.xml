      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1067">'''Actual notice''' is a [[law]] term, used most frequently in [[civil procedure]].  It is notice (usually to a defendant in a civil proceeding) delivered in such a way as to give legally sufficient assurance that actual knowledge of the matter has been conveyed to the recipient.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.law.com/default2.asp?selected=2320 Law.com Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Service of process|Personal service]], that is, physically handing something to an individual, is usually considered the least-disputable method of giving actual notice.

Actual notice may be contrasted with [[constructive notice]], which is a way of giving notice that may not immediately bring the matter to the attention of the individual that is intended to receive the notice.  Constructive notice includes, among other methods, service on an agent or family member, service by posting (on the front door), and service by publication (as in a newspaper).

[[File:Phoneme-allophone-determination-chart.svg|thumb|A simplified procedure to determine whether two sounds represent the same or different phonemes. The cases on the extreme left and the extreme right are those in which the sounds are allophones.]]
In [[phonology]], an '''allophone''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|l|ə|f|oʊ|n}}; from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἄλλος}}, ''állos'', "other" and {{lang|grc|φωνή}}, ''phōnē'', "voice, sound") is one of a set of multiple possible spoken sounds, or ''[[phone (phonetics)|phones]]'', or signs used to pronounce a single [[phoneme]] in a particular language.&lt;ref name="ref00qacid"&gt;{{Citation | title=Structure of Language and Its Mathematical Aspects: Proceedings of symposia in applied mathematics | author=R. Jakobson | publisher=AMS Bookstore, 1980 | isbn=978-0-8218-1312-6 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ou_zOzU9wEwC | quote=''...An allophone is the set of phones contained in the intersection of a maximal set of phonetically similar phones and a primary phonetically related set of phones....''}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, {{IPAblink|t}} (as in ''stop'' {{IPA|[stɑp]}}) and {{IPAblink|ɾ}} (as in ''Letter {{IPA|[ˈɫɛɾɚ]}}'') are allophones for the phoneme {{IPA|/t/}} in [[English language|English]], while these two are considered to be different phonemes in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. On the other hand {{IPAblink|d}} (as in ''dolor'' {{IPA|[do̞ˈlo̞r]}}) and {{IPAblink|ð}} (as in ''nada'' {{IPA|[ˈnaða]}}) are allophones for the phoneme {{IPA|/d/}} in Spanish, while these two are considered to be different phonemes in English.

The specific allophone selected in a given situation is often predictable from the phonetic context, with such allophones being called '''positional variants''', but some allophones occur in [[free variation]]. Replacing a sound by another allophone of the same phoneme usually does not change the meaning of a word, but the result may sound non-native or even unintelligible.

Native speakers of a given language perceive one phoneme in the language as a single distinctive sound and are "both unaware of and even shocked by" the allophone variations that are used to pronounce single phonemes.&lt;ref name="ref89rahec"&gt;{{Citation | title=Linguistics and Phonetics | author=B.D.

==History of concept==
The term "allophone" was coined by [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]] in the 1940s. In doing so, he placed a cornerstone in consolidating early [[phoneme]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Penny|year=1996|title=The Whorf Theory Complex&amp;nbsp;— A Critical Reconstruction|publisher=John Benjamins | ref = harv |pages=46, 88}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was popularized by [[George L. Trager]] and [[Bernard Bloch (linguist)|Bernard Bloch]] in a 1941 paper on English phonology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trager|first=George L.|title=The Systematization of the Whorf Hypothesis|journal=Anthropological Linguistics|volume= 1|issue=1|publisher=Operational Models in Synchronic Linguistics: A Symposium Presented at the 1958 Meetings of the American Anthropological Association|year= 1959|pages=31–35 |jstor=30022173 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; and went on to become part of standard usage within the American structuralist tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Dell H. |last=Hymes|first2=John G. |last2=Fought|title=American Structuralism|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year= 1981|ref=harv|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complementary and free-variant allophones and assimilation==
Whenever a user's speech is vocalized for a given phoneme, it is slightly different from other utterances, even for the same speaker. That has led to some debate over how real and how universal phonemes really are (see [[phoneme]] for details). Only some of the variation is significant, by being detectable or perceivable, to speakers.

There are two types of allophones, based on whether a phoneme must be pronounced using a specific allophone in a specific situation or whether the speaker has the unconscious freedom to choose the allophone that is used.

If a specific allophone from a set of allophones that correspond to a phoneme must be selected in a given context, and using a different allophone for a phoneme would cause confusion or make the speaker sound non-native, the allophones are said to be ''complementary''. The allophones then complement each other, and one of them is not used in a situation in which the usage of another is standard. For complementary allophones, each allophone is used in a specific phonetic context and may be involved in a [[phonology|phonological]] process.&lt;ref name="ref47qoref"&gt;{{Citation | title=English L2 reading: getting to the bottom | author=Barbara M. Birch | publisher=Psychology Press, 2002 | isbn=978-0-8058-3899-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kiHSOxn0zX4C | quote=''...When the occurrence of one allophone is predictable when compared to the other, as in this case, we call this complementary distribution. Complementary distribution means that the allophones are 'distributed' as complements....''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other cases, the speaker can freely select from ''[[free variation|free variant]]'' allophones on personal habit or preference.

Another example of an allophone is [[assimilation (phonology)|assimilation]], in which a phoneme is to sound more like another phoneme. One example of assimilation is [[consonant voicing and devoicing]], in which voiceless consonants are voiced before and after voiced consonants, and voiced consonants are devoiced before and after voiceless consonants.

==Allotone==
An '''allotone''' is a [[tone (linguistics)|tonic]] allophone, such as the [[neutral tone]] in [[Standard Mandarin]].

== Examples ==

=== English ===
{{main|English phonology#Allophones of consonants|English phonology#Allophones of vowels}}
 
There are many allophonic processes in English: lack of plosion, nasal plosion, partial devoicing of sonorants, complete devoicing of sonorants, partial devoicing of obstruents, lengthening and shortening vowels, and retraction.

* [[Aspirated consonant|Aspiration]]: In English, a voiceless plosive {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} is aspirated (has a string explosion of breath) if it is at the beginning of the first or a stressed syllable in a word. For example, {{IPA|[pʰ]}} as in ''pin'' and {{IPA|[p]}} as in ''spin'' are allophones for the phoneme {{IPA|/p/}} because they cannot distinguish words (in fact, they occur in [[complementary distribution]]). English-speakers treat them as the same sound, but they are different: the first is aspirated and the second is [[unaspirated]] (plain). Many languages [[Aspirated consonant#Usage patterns|treat the two phones differently]].
* Nasal plosion – In English, a plosive ({{IPA|/p, t, k, b, d, ɡ/}}) has nasal plosion if it is followed by a nasal, whether within a word or across a word boundary.
* Partial devoicing of [[sonorant]]s: In English, sonorants ({{IPA|/j, w, l, r, m, n, ŋ/}}) are partially devoiced after a voiceless sound in the same syllable.
* Complete devoicing of sonorants: In English, a sonorant is completely devoiced after an aspirated plosive ({{IPA|/p, t, k/}}).
* Partial devoicing of [[obstruent]]s: In English, a voiced obstruent is partially devoiced next to a pause or next to a voiceless sound within a word or across a word boundary.
* Retraction: In English, {{IPA|/t, d, n, l/}} are [[Retracted (phonetics)|retracted]] before {{IPA|/r/}}.

Because the choice among allophones is seldom under conscious control, few people realize their existence. English-speakers may be unaware of the differences among six allophones of the phoneme {{IPA|/t/}}: unreleased {{IPA|[ t̚]}} as in ''cat'', aspirated {{IPA|[tʰ]}} as in ''top'', glottalized {{IPA|[ʔ]}} as in ''button'', flapped {{IPA|[ɾ]}} as in [[American English]] ''water'', nasalized flapped as in ''winter'', and none of the above {{IPA|[t]}} as in ''stop''. However, they may become aware of the differences if, for example, they contrast the pronunciations of the following words:

*''Night rate'': unreleased {{IPA|[ˈnʌɪt̚.ɹʷeɪt̚]}} (without a [[word space]] between {{IPA|.}} and {{IPA|ɹ}})
*''Nitrate'': aspirated {{IPA|[ˈnaɪ.tʰɹ̥eɪt̚]}} or retracted {{IPA|[ˈnaɪ.tʃɹʷeɪt̚]}}

A flame that is held before the lips while those words are spoken flickers more for the aspirated ''nitrate'' than for the unaspirated ''night rate.'' The difference can also be felt by holding the hand in front of the lips. For a [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]-speaker, for whom {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/tʰ/}} are separate phonemes, the English distinction is much more obvious than for an English-speaker, who has learned since childhood to ignore the distinction.

Allophones of English {{IPA|/l/}} may be noticed if the 'light' {{IPA|[l]}} of ''leaf'' {{IPA|[ˈliːf]}} is contrasted with the 'dark' {{IPA|[ɫ]}} of ''feel'' {{IPA|[ˈfiːɫ]}}. Again, the difference is much more obvious to a [[Turkish language|Turkish]]-speaker, for whom {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/ɫ/}} are separate phonemes, than to an English speaker, for whom they are allophones of a single phoneme.

===Other languages===
There are many examples for allophones in languages other than English. Typically, languages with a small phoneme inventory allow for quite a lot of allophonic variation: examples are [[Hawaiian language#Consonants|Hawaiian]] and [[Toki Pona#Allophony|Toki Pona]]. Here are some examples (the links of language names go to the specific article or subsection on the phenomenon):

== Representing a phoneme with an allophone ==
Since phonemes are abstractions of speech sounds, not the sounds themselves, they have no direct [[phonetic transcription]]. When they are realized without much allophonic variation, a simple [[broad transcription]] is used. However, when there are complementary allophones of a phoneme, the allophony becomes significant and things then become more complicated. Often, if only one of the allophones is simple to transcribe, in the sense of not requiring diacritics, that representation is chosen for the phoneme.

However, there may be several such allophones, or the linguist may prefer greater precision than that allows. In such cases, a common convention is to use the "elsewhere condition" to decide the allophone that stands for the phoneme. The "elsewhere" allophone is the one that remains once the conditions for the others are described by phonological rules.

For example, English has both oral and nasal allophones of its vowels. The pattern is that vowels are nasal only before a nasal consonant in the same syllable; elsewhere, they are oral. Therefore, by the "elsewhere" convention, the oral allophones are considered basic, and nasal vowels in English are considered to be allophones of oral phonemes.

In other cases, an allophone may be chosen to represent its phoneme because it is more common in the languages of the world than the other allophones, because it reflects the historical origin of the phoneme, or because it gives a more balanced look to a chart of the phonemic inventory.

An alternative, which is commonly used for [[archiphoneme]]s, is to use a capital letter, such as /N/ for [m], [n], [ŋ].

In rare cases, a linguist may represent phonemes with abstract symbols, such as [[dingbat]]s, to avoid privileging any particular allophone.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

'''Barranquenho''' (''Barranquenhu''; [[English language|English]]: Barranquian&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=PT Ethnologue report for Portugal]&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Romance languages|Romance linguistic variety]] spoken in the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] town of [[Barrancos]], near the [[Spain|Spanish]] border. It is a [[mixed language]], and can be considered either a variety of [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (Alentejan Portuguese) heavily influenced by the Spanish dialects of neighbouring areas in Spain in [[Extremadura]] and [[Andalusia]] (especially those from [[Encinasola]] and [[Rosal de la Frontera]]),&lt;ref&gt;[[José Leite de Vasconcelos]], ''Filologia Barranquenha - apontamentos para o seu estudo'', 1940.&lt;/ref&gt; or a Spanish dialect (Extremaduran / Andalusian) heavily influenced by Portuguese.

Barranquian speakers say that they speak neither Spanish nor Portuguese but a third language altogether different. Although unlike some sources may state, Barranquenho is very easy to understand by speakers of both Portuguese and Spanish, as it is very close to both, and especially similar to the [[Andalusian Spanish|Andalusian]] dialect. [[Ethnologue]] lists Barranquian as a dialect of [[Extremaduran language|Extremaduran]], perhaps because Barrancos was populated by settlers from [[Badajoz]], a city in [[Extremadura]], though not in a [[Extremaduran language]] speaking area.&lt;ref&gt;José Ignacio Hualde, Antxon Olarrea, Erin O'Rourke (2012) ''The Handbook of Hispanic Linguistics'', p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of Barranquenho seems to be relatively recent (in the past 200 years), unlike other minority linguistic varieties in the Iberian Peninsula which have medieval roots.

==Characteristics==
The Portuguese base of this dialect is extremely hidden behind the Spanish dialects that mold it. The most characteristic aspect of this dialect is the aspiration of the 's' and 'z' in the end of the words, like in the Extremaduran and Andalusian dialects: 'cruh' (Portuguese/Spanish: cruz; English: cross), 'buhcá' (Portuguese/Spanish: buscar; English: search) ... 
Sometimes the letters can be completely muted: 'uma bê' (Portuguese: uma vez; English: once).
The Portuguese 'j', 'ge' and 'gi' are pronounced like the Spanish [x].

The 'l' and 'r' in the end of the words are not pronounced: 'Manué' (Manuel), 'olivá' (olivar). But they appear again in the plural form: 'olivareh' (olivares). If the 'l' is at the end of a syllable it turns into 'r': 'argo' (algo). Like in Spanish, there is no differentiation between 'b' and 'v': vaca ['baka']. Just like in Extremaduran (or Brazilian Portuguese), the '-e' (English 'eh') in the end is pronounced like '-i' (English 'ee'): 'pobri' (pobre).

The Portuguese form of the first person of the plural 'nós' is replaced by 'nusotrus' - a variation of the Spanish 'nosotros'. The placing of the pronouns is closer to the Spanish norm than to the Portuguese: 'se lavô' (Portuguese: lavou-se; Spanish: se lavó; English: has been washed).

It also contains many verbal forms of clearly Spanish conjugation: 'andubi' (Portuguese: andei, Spanish: anduve); 'supimos' (Portuguese: soubemos; Spanish: supimos).

==Recognition==
The Portuguese government does not recognize nor protect the use of Barranquenho.

'''Bhikari Thakur''' ([[Devanagari]]: भिखारी ठाकुर; [[Nastaʿlīq]]: بھکھڑی ٹھاکر [[Kaithi]]: 𑂦𑂱𑂎𑂰𑂩𑂲 𑂘𑂰𑂍𑂳𑂩;{{Audio|BhikhariThakur2.ogg|listen}}) was an Indian playwright, lyricist, actor, [[folk dance]]r, [[folk singer]] and social activist in [[Bhojpuri]] language popularly known as the "[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] of [[Bhojpuri]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/article3534122.ece|title=On the Shakespeare of Bhojpuri|author=Shalaja Tripathi|publisher=''[[The Hindu]]''date=16 June 2012|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thakur was born in a barber-family on 18 December 1887 in a village named Kutubpur (Diyara), [[Saran District]], Bihar, India. His father and mother were Dal Singar Thakur and Shivkali Devi respectively. He had a younger brother named Bahor Thakur, hid elder son and many coleguse  are still alive named as- Bada ram chandra, Lakhi Chandra Manji, Ram Chandra Manji, Gopal Prasad and Kishun Dev Sharma .

He travelled to [[Kharagpur]] to earn a livelihood. Here he made money, but was unsatisfied with the job. A [[Ramlila]] aficionado, he then travelled to [[Jagannath Puri]] as he had heard that the pilgrimage city organises some of the best [[Ramlila]] plays.

He put together a play group at his native village and began to perform [[Ramlila]], songs recitals and took an interest in social works. He started writing dramas, songs and novels etc. The language of the books was simple and attracted many. The books were published from [[Varanasi]], [[Chhapra]] and [[Howrah]].

His literary creations including dramas (Bidesiya, Beti-Bechawa, Bidhawa-Bilaap etc.) and songs continue to be appreciated and performed even today. He died at the age of 83 on 10 July 1971. Upcoming Hindi Film [[Chaarfutiya Chhokare]] directed by Manish Harishankar dedicates its one song 'Kaun Si Nagariya' to his work that is based on his one of the song of Beti-Bechawa. Bihar Kokila [[Sharda Sinha]] has sung the song.

In [[computing]], a '''blacklist''' or '''block list''' is a basic [[access control]] mechanism that allows through all elements (email addresses, users, passwords, [[URLs]], [[IP address]]es, [[domain name]]s, file [[MD5 Hash|hashes]], etc.), except those explicitly mentioned. Those items on the list are denied access. The opposite is a [[whitelist]], which means only items on the list are let through whatever gate is being used. A [[Greylisting|greylist]] contains items that are temporarily blocked (or temporarily allowed) until an additional step is performed.

Blacklists can be applied at various points in a security architecture, such as a [[Host (network)|host]], [[web proxy]], [[DNS]] servers, [[email]] server, [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]], [[directory server]]s or application authentication gateways. The type of element blocked is influenced by the access control location.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Introduction to Information Security: A Strategic-Based Approach|url = https://booksì.google.com/books?id=eZBqAAAAQBAJ|publisher = Newnes|date = 2013-11-12|isbn = 9781597499729|language = en|first = Timothy|last = Shimeall|first2 = Jonathan|last2 = Spring}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNS servers may be well-suited to block domain names, for example, but not URLs. A firewall is well-suited for blocking IP addresses, but less so for blocking malicious files or passwords.

Example uses include a company that might prevent a list of software from running on its network, a school that might prevent access to a list of web sites from its computers, or a business that wants to ensure their computer users are not choosing easily guessed, poor passwords.

==Example systems to protect==
Blacklists are used to protect a variety of systems in computing. The content of the blacklist is likely needs to be targeted to the type of system defended.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Domain Blacklist Ecosystem - A Case Study|url = https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/cert/2015/06/domain-blacklist-ecosystem---a-case-study.html|website = insights.sei.cmu.edu|access-date = 2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Information systems===

An information system includes end-point hosts like user machines and servers. A blacklist in this location may include certain types of software that are not allowed to run in the company environment. For example, a company might blacklist peer to peer file sharing on its systems. In addition to software, people, devices and Web sites can also be blacklisted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rainer | first=Watson|title=Introduction to Information Systems|year=2012|publisher=Wiley Custom Learning Solutions|isbn=978-1-118-45213-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Email===

Most email providers have a [[Email spam|anti-spam]] feature that essentially blacklists certain [[email address]]es if they are deemed unwanted. How this happens is when a successful [[phishing]] attack (from an address that is forged from reliable accounts to try to recover personal information) is executed, then the email device deems the address to be spam, and proceeds to blacklist the address.

An [[e-mail spam]] [[mail filter|filter]] may keep a blacklist of email addresses, any mail from which would be prevented from reaching its intended destination. It may also use sending domain names or sending IP addresses to implement a more general block.

In addition to private email blacklists, there are lists that are kept for public use, examples are

* China Anti-Spam Alliance &lt;ref&gt;http://anti-spam.org.cn/?locale=en_US&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fabel Spamsources &lt;ref&gt;https://mxtoolbox.com/problem/blacklist/fabelsources&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Spam and Open Relay Blocking System]]
* The DrMX Project

===Web browsing===
The goal of a blacklist in a web browser is to prevent the user from visiting a malicious or deceitful web page via filtering locally. A common web browsing blacklist is Google's [[Google Safe Browsing|Safe Browsing]], which is installed by default in Firefox, Safari, and Chrome.

===Usernames and passwords===
Blacklisting can also apply to user credentials. It is common for systems or websites to blacklist certain reserved usernames that are not allowed to be chosen by the system or website's user populations.  These reserved usernames are commonly associated with built-in system administration functions.

Password blacklists are very similar to username blacklists but typically contain significantly more entries than username blacklists. Password blacklists are applied to prevent users from choosing passwords that are easily guessed or are well known and could lead to unauthorized access by malicious parties. Password blacklists are deployed as an additional layer of security, usually in addition to a password policy, which sets the requirements of the password length and/or character complexity.  This is because there are a significant number of password combinations that fulfill many password policies but are still easily guessed (i.e., Password123, Qwerty123).

==Distribution methods==
Blacklists are distributed in a variety of ways. Some use simple [[mailing list]]s. A [[DNSBL]] is a common distribution method that leverages the [[Domain Name System|DNS]] itself. Some lists make use of [[rsync]] for high-volume exchanges of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Guidelines|url = http://www.surbl.org/guidelines|website = www.surbl.org|access-date = 2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Web-server functions may be used; either simple [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|GET]] requests may be used or more complicated interfaces such as a [[RESTful API Modeling Language|RESTful]] API.

==Examples==
* For a list of some DNS-based blacklists, see the [[Comparison of DNS blacklists]].
* Companies like [[Google]], [[Symantec]] and [[Sucuri]] keep internal blacklists of sites known to have malware and they display a warning before allowing the user to click them.
* [[Content-control software]] such as [[DansGuardian]] and [[SquidGuard]] may work with a blacklist in order to block [[Uniform Resource Locator|URLs]] of sites deemed inappropriate for a work or educational environment. Such blacklists can be obtained free of charge or from commercial vendors such as [[Squidblacklist.org]].
* A [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]] or [[Intrusion detection system|IDS]] may also use a blacklist to block known hostile IP addresses and/or networks. An example for such a list would be the [[OpenBL]] project.
* Many [[copy protection]] schemes include [[software blacklist]]ing.
* The company [https://www.passwordrbl.com Password RBL] offers a password blacklist for Microsoft's [[Active Directory]], web sites and apps, distributed via a [[RESTful API Modeling Language|RESTful]] API.
* Members of [[online auction]] sites may add other members to a personal blacklist. This means that they cannot bid on or ask questions about your auctions, nor can they use a "buy it now" function on your items.
* Yet another form of list is the yellow list which is a list of email server IP addresses that send mostly good email but do send some spam. Examples include [[Yahoo]], [[Hotmail]], and [[Gmail]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} A yellow listed server is a server that should never be accidentally blacklisted. The yellow list is checked first and if listed then blacklist tests are ignored.
* In [[Linux]] [[modprobe]], the &lt;code&gt;blacklist modulename&lt;/code&gt; entry in a modprobe configuration file indicates that all of the particular [[loadable kernel module|module]]'s internal aliases are to be ignored. There are cases where two or more modules both support the same devices, or a module invalidly claims to support a device.
* Many web browsers have the ability to consult anti-[[phishing]] blacklists in order to warn users who unwittingly aim to visit a [[Internet fraud|fraudulent website]].
* Many [[peer-to-peer file sharing]] programs support blacklists that block access from sites known to be owned by companies enforcing copyright.  An example is the Bluetack&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bluetack.co.uk/forums/index.php?autocom=faq&amp;CODE=02&amp;qid=18 |title= B.I.S.S. Forums - FAQ - Questions about the Blocklists |work=Bluetack Internet Security Solutions |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020052855/http://www.bluetack.co.uk/forums/index.php?autocom=faq&amp;CODE=02&amp;qid=18 |archivedate=2008-10-20 |accessdate=2015-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; blocklist set.

==Considerations of usage==
As expressed in a recent conference paper focusing on blacklists of domain names and IP addresses used for Internet security, "these lists generally do not intersect. Therefore, it appears that these lists do not converge on one set of malicious indicators."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Blacklist Ecosystem Analysis: Spanning Jan 2012 to Jun 2014|url = http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2808129|publisher = ACM|journal = Proceedings of the 2nd ACM Workshop on Information Sharing and Collaborative Security|date = 2015-01-01|pages = 13–22|first = Leigh|last = Metcalf|first2 = Jonathan M.|last2 = Spring}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Paint It Black: Evaluating the Effectiveness of Malware Blacklists|url = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-11379-1_1|publisher = Springer International Publishing|date = 2014-09-17|isbn = 9783319113784|pages = 1–21|series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science|doi = 10.1007/978-3-319-11379-1_1|language = en|first = Marc|last = Kührer|first2 = Christian|last2 = Rossow|first3 = Thorsten|last3 = Holz|editor-first = Angelos|editor-last = Stavrou|editor-first2 = Herbert|editor-last2 = Bos|editor-first3 = Georgios|editor-last3 = Portokalidis}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concern combined with an economic model&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Modeling malicious domain name take-down dynamics: Why eCrime pays|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=6805779|publisher = IEEE|journal = eCrime Researchers Summit (eCRS), 2013|date = 2013-01-01|pages = 1–9|first = Jonathan M.|last = Spring}}&lt;/ref&gt; means that, while blacklists are an essential part of network defense, they need to be used in concert with whitelists and greylists.

An example would be the Adblock Plus blocklist that includes a number of features including whitelists within the blacklist by adding a prefix of two at symbols and two pipe symbols e.g. "@@||www.blocksite.com".

The '''Cherokee syllabary''' is a [[syllabary]] invented by [[Sequoyah]] to write the [[Cherokee language]] in the late 1810s and early 1820s. His creation of the syllabary is particularly noteworthy as he could not previously read any script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Diamond|first1=Jared|title=Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies|date=1999|publisher=Norton|location=New York, New York|isbn=0393317552|page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; He first experimented with [[logogram]]s, but his system later developed into a syllabary. In his system, each symbol represents a [[syllable]] rather than a single [[phoneme]]; the 85 (originally 86){{sfn|Sturtevant|Fogelson|2004|p=337}} characters provide a suitable method to write Cherokee. Although some symbols resemble [[Latin alphabet|Latin]], [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], and [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] letters, the relationship between symbols and sounds is different.

==Description==
[[File:Sequoyah.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Sequoyah]], inventor of the Cherokee syllabary]]
Each of the characters represents one syllable, as in the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] ''[[kana]]'' and the [[Bronze Age]] Greek [[Linear B]] writing systems. The first six characters represent isolated [[Cardinal vowel|vowel]] syllables. Characters for combined consonant and vowel syllables then follow.

The charts below show the syllabary in recitation order, left to right, top to bottom as arranged by [[Samuel Worcester]], along with his commonly used transliterations.{{Sfn | Walker | Sarbaugh | 1993 | p = 72, 76}}{{Sfn | Giasson | 2004 | p = 42}} He played a key role in the development of [[Cherokee printing]] from 1828 until his death in 1859.

The Latin letter 'v' in the transcriptions, seen in the last column, represents a [[nasal vowel]], /ə̃/.

The Cherokee character Ꮩ ''do'' has a different orientation in old documents, resembling a Greek Λ (or barless A) rather than a Latin V as in modern documents.{{refn|group=note|name=old-do| There is a difference between the old form of ''do'' (Λ-like) and the modern form of ''do'' (V-like). The standard Digohweli font displays the modern form. Old Do Digohweli and Code2000 fonts both display the old form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.languagegeek.com/font/fontdownload.html#Cherokee | title = Language geek font download | contribution = Cherokee}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Note that the 86th character (Ᏽ, ''mv'') is obsolete.{{refn|group=note|name=mv|Most sources, including materials produced by the Cherokee Nation, state that this character represented the ''mv'' syllable.&lt;ref name="SyllabaryChart"&gt;{{cite web|title=Syllabary Chart|url=http://cherokee.org/Portals/0/Documents/Language/syllabary%20chart.pdf?ver=2017-08-04-145035-983|publisher=Cherokee Nation|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cushman2013p93"&gt;Cushman 2013, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="unicode9"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cherokee: Range: 13A0–13FF|url=https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U13A0.pdf|website=The Unicode Standard, Version 9.0|accessdate=10 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Worcester wrote that it represented a syllable similar to ''hv'', but more open.{{Sfn | Walker | Sarbaugh | 1993 | p = 77, 89–90}}}} There is also a handwritten cursive form of the syllabary;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.omniglot.com/images/writing/cherokee_orig.gif&lt;/ref&gt; notably, the handwritten glyphs bear little resemblance to the printed forms.

=== Detailed considerations ===
The phonetic values of these characters do not equate directly to those represented by the letters of the Latin script. Some characters represent two distinct phonetic values (actually heard as different syllables), while others may represent multiple variations of the same syllable.{{Sfn | Walker | Sarbaugh | 1993 | p = 72–75}} Not all [[phoneme|phonemic]] distinctions of the spoken language are represented.  For example, while /d/ + vowel syllables are mostly differentiated from /t/+vowel by use of different graphs, syllables beginning with /g/ are all conflated with those beginning with /k/, so that in most cases, /k/ is written with a glyph in the ''g'' row.  Also, long vowels are not ordinarily distinguished from short vowels, tones are not marked, and there is no regular rule for representing consonant clusters. However, in more recent technical literature, length of vowels can actually be indicated using a colon.

Six distinctive vowel qualities are represented in the Cherokee syllabary based on where they are pronounced in the mouth, including the high vowels ''i'' and ''u'', mid vowels ''e, v'', and ''o'', and low vowel ''a''. The syllabary also does not distinguish among syllables that end in vowels, ''h,'' or glottal stop.  For example, the single symbol, Ꮡ, is used to represent ''su'' in ''su:dali'', meaning ''six'' (ᏑᏓᎵ).  This same symbol Ꮡ represents ''suh'' as in ''suhdi,'' meaning 'fishhook' (ᏑᏗ). Therefore, there is no differentiation among the symbols used for syllables ending in a single vowel versus that vowel plus "h."

When consonants other than ''s, h,'' or glottal stop arise with other consonants in clusters, the appropriate consonant plus a "dummy vowel" is used. This dummy vowel is not pronounced and is either chosen arbitrarily or for etymological reasons (reflecting an underlying etymological vowel). For example, ᏧᎾᏍᏗ (tsu-na-s-di) represents the word ''ju:nsdi'', meaning 'small.' ''Ns'' in this case is the consonant cluster that requires the following dummy vowel, ''a''. ''Ns'' is written as ᎾᏍ /nas/. The vowel is included in the transliteration, but is not pronounced in the word (''ju:nsdi''). (The transliterated ''ts'' represents the affricate ''j'').{{Sfn | Scancarelli | 2005}}{{Rp | needed = yes|date=December 2012}} Adult speakers can distinguish words by context.

If a labial consonant such as ''p'' or ''b'' appears in a borrowed word or name, it is written using the ''qu'' row. This /kw/ ~ /p/ correspondence is a known linguistic phenomenon that exists elsewhere (cf. [[P-Celtic]], [[Osco-Umbrian]], [[Telerin]]).

=== Transliteration issues ===
Some Cherokee words pose a problem for transliteration software because they contain adjacent pairs of single letter symbols that (without special provisions) would be combined when doing the back conversion from Latin script to Cherokee. Here are a few examples:
* ᎢᏣᎵᏍᎠᏁᏗ = ''itsalisanedi'' = ''i-tsa-li-s-a-ne-di''
* ᎤᎵᎩᏳᏍᎠᏅᏁ = ''uligiyusanvne'' = ''u-li-gi-yu-s-a-nv-ne''
* ᎤᏂᏰᏍᎢᏱ = ''uniyesiyi'' = ''u-ni-ye-s-i-yi''
* ᎾᏍᎢᏯ = ''nasiya'' = ''na-s-i-ya''
For these examples, the back conversion is likely to join ''s-a'' as ''sa'' or ''s-i'' as ''si''. One solution is to use an apostrophe to separate the two,{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} as is done in Japanese (e.g.: [[Man'yogana]]): ''itsalis'anedi''.

Other Cherokee words contain character pairs that entail overlapping transliteration sequences. Examples:
* ᏀᎾ transliterates as ''nahna'', yet so does ᎾᎿ. The former is ''nah-na'', the latter is ''na-hna''.
If the Latin script is parsed from left to right, longest match first, then without special provisions, the back conversion would be wrong for the latter. There are several similar examples involving these character combinations: ''naha nahe nahi naho nahu nahv''.

A further problem encountered in transliterating Cherokee is that there are some pairs of different Cherokee words that transliterate to the same word in the Latin script. Here are some examples:
* ᎠᏍᎡᏃ and ᎠᏎᏃ both transliterate to ''aseno''
* ᎨᏍᎥᎢ and ᎨᏒᎢ both transliterate to ''gesvi''
Without special provision, a round trip conversion may change ᎠᏍᎡᏃ to ᎠᏎᏃ and change ᎨᏍᎥᎢ to ᎨᏒᎢ.

==Character orders==
[[File:Cherokee syllabary original order.png|thumb|Original Cherokee syllabary order, with the now obsolete letter Ᏽ in red]]
# The usual alphabetical order for Cherokee runs across the rows of the syllabary chart from left to right, top to bottom—this is the one used in the Unicode block: Ꭰ (a), Ꭱ (e), Ꭲ (i), Ꭳ (o), Ꭴ (u), Ꭵ (v), Ꭶ (ga), Ꭷ (ka), Ꭸ (ge), Ꭹ (gi), Ꭺ (go), Ꭻ (gu), Ꭼ (gv), Ꭽ (ha), Ꭾ (he), Ꭿ (hi), Ꮀ (ho), Ꮁ (hu), Ꮂ (hv), Ꮃ (la), Ꮄ (le), Ꮅ (li), Ꮆ (lo), Ꮇ (lu), Ꮈ (lv), Ꮉ (ma), Ꮊ (me), Ꮋ (mi), Ꮌ (mo), Ꮍ (mu), Ꮎ (na), Ꮏ (hna), Ꮐ (nah), Ꮑ (ne), Ꮒ (ni), Ꮓ (no), Ꮔ (nu), Ꮕ (nv), Ꮖ (qua), Ꮗ (que), Ꮘ (qui), Ꮙ (quo), Ꮚ (quu), Ꮛ (quv), Ꮜ (sa), Ꮝ (s), Ꮞ (se), Ꮟ (si), Ꮠ (so), Ꮡ (su), Ꮢ (sv), Ꮣ (da), Ꮤ (ta), Ꮥ (de), Ꮦ (te), Ꮧ (di), Ꮨ (ti), Ꮩ (do), Ꮪ (du), Ꮫ (dv), Ꮬ (dla), Ꮭ (tla), Ꮮ (tle), Ꮯ (tli), Ꮰ (tlo), Ꮱ (tlu), Ꮲ (tlv), Ꮳ (tsa), Ꮴ (tse), Ꮵ (tsi), Ꮶ (tso), Ꮷ (tsu), Ꮸ (tsv), Ꮹ (wa), Ꮺ (we), Ꮻ (wi), Ꮼ (wo), Ꮽ (wu), Ꮾ (wv), Ꮿ (ya), Ᏸ (ye), Ᏹ (yi), Ᏺ (yo), Ᏻ (yu), Ᏼ (yv).
# Cherokee has also been alphabetized based on the six columns of the syllabary chart from top to bottom, left to right: Ꭰ (a), Ꭶ (ga), Ꭷ (ka), Ꭽ (ha), Ꮃ (la), Ꮉ (ma), Ꮎ (na), Ꮏ (hna), Ꮐ (nah), Ꮖ (qua), Ꮝ (s), Ꮜ (sa), Ꮣ (da), Ꮤ (ta), Ꮬ (dla), Ꮭ (tla), Ꮳ (tsa), Ꮹ (wa), Ꮿ (ya), Ꭱ (e), Ꭸ (ge), Ꭾ (he), Ꮄ (le), Ꮊ (me), Ꮑ (ne), Ꮗ (que), Ꮞ (se), Ꮥ (de), Ꮦ (te), Ꮮ (tle), Ꮴ (tse), Ꮺ (we), Ᏸ (ye), Ꭲ (i), Ꭹ (gi), Ꭿ (hi), Ꮅ (li), Ꮋ (mi), Ꮒ (ni), Ꮘ (qui), Ꮟ (si), Ꮧ (di), Ꮨ (ti), Ꮯ (tli), Ꮵ (tsi), Ꮻ (wi), Ᏹ (yi), Ꭳ (o), Ꭺ (go), Ꮀ (ho), Ꮆ (lo), Ꮌ (mo), Ꮓ (no), Ꮙ (quo), Ꮠ (so), Ꮩ (do), Ꮰ (tlo), Ꮶ (tso), Ꮼ (wo), Ᏺ (yo), Ꭴ (u), Ꭻ (gu), Ꮁ (hu), Ꮇ (lu), Ꮍ (mu), Ꮔ (nu), Ꮚ (quu), Ꮡ (su), Ꮪ (du), Ꮱ (tlu), Ꮷ (tsu), Ꮽ (wu), Ᏻ (yu), Ꭵ (v), Ꭼ (gv), Ꮂ (hv), Ꮈ (lv), Ꮕ (nv), Ꮛ (quv), Ꮢ (sv), Ꮫ (dv), Ꮲ (tlv), Ꮸ (tsv), Ꮾ (wv), Ᏼ (yv).
# Sequoyah used a completely different alphabetical order: Ꭱ (e), Ꭰ (a), Ꮃ (la), Ꮵ (tsi), Ꮐ (nah), Ꮽ (wu), Ꮺ (we), Ꮅ (li), Ꮑ (ne), Ꮌ (mo), Ꭹ (gi), Ᏹ (yi), Ꮟ (si), Ꮲ (tlv), Ꭳ (o), Ꮇ (lu), Ꮄ (le), Ꭽ (ha), Ꮼ (wo), Ꮰ (tlo), Ꮤ (ta), Ᏼ (yv), Ꮈ (lv), Ꭿ (hi), Ꮝ (s), Ᏺ (yo), Ꮁ (hu), Ꭺ (go), Ꮷ (tsu), Ꮍ (mu), Ꮞ (se), Ꮠ (so), Ꮯ (tli), Ꮘ (qui), Ꮗ (que), Ꮜ (sa), Ꮖ (qua), Ꮓ (no), Ꭷ (ka), Ꮸ (tsv), Ꮢ (sv), Ꮒ (ni), Ꭶ (ga), Ꮩ (do), Ꭸ (ge), Ꮣ (da), Ꭼ (gv), Ꮻ (wi), Ꭲ (i), Ꭴ (u), Ᏸ (ye), Ꮂ (hv), Ꮫ (dv), Ꭻ (gu), Ꮶ (tso), Ꮙ (quo), Ꮔ (nu), Ꮎ (na), Ꮆ (lo), Ᏻ (yu), Ꮴ (tse), Ꮧ (di), Ꮾ (wv), Ꮪ(du), Ꮥ (de), Ꮳ (tsa), Ꭵ (v), Ꮕ (nv), Ꮦ (te), Ꮉ (ma), Ꮡ (su), Ꮱ (tlu), Ꭾ (he), Ꮀ (ho), Ꮋ (mi), Ꮭ (tla), Ꮿ (ya), Ꮹ (wa), Ꮨ (ti), Ꮮ (tle), Ꮏ (hna), Ꮚ (quu), Ꮬ (dla), Ꮊ (me), Ꮛ (quv).

==Numerals==
Cherokee uses [[Arabic numerals]] (0–9). Sequoyah proposed a system of numerals for Cherokee, but his system was never adopted.{{Sfn | Giasson | 2004 | p = 7}} Sequoyah's system included symbols for 1–20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 as well as a symbol for three zeros for numbers in the thousands and a symbol for six zeros for numbers in the millions.  These last two symbols representing 000 and 000,000 are made up of three separate symbols each.

==Early history==
{{main|Sequoyah}}
[[File:Original Cherokee Syllabary.jpg|thumb|Sequoyah's original syllabary characters, showing both the script forms and the print forms]]
{{external media | width = 210px | float = right |
 | video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3QKRzq5M5Y The Cherokee Syllabary], NCLLP&lt;ref name="ncllp"&gt;{{cite web | title =The North Carolina Language and Life Project | work = | publisher = | date = | url =https://ncsu.edu/linguistics/ncllp/index.php | accessdate =April 2, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}
Around 1809, impressed by the "talking leaves" of European written languages, Sequoyah began work to create a writing system for the Cherokee language. After attempting to create a character for each word, Sequoyah realized this would be too difficult and eventually created characters to represent syllables. Sequoyah took some ideas from his copy of the Bible, which he studied for characters to use in print, noticing the simplicity of the Roman letters and adopting them to make the writing of his syllabary easier. He worked on the syllabary for twelve years before completion, and dropped or modified most of the characters he originally created.

After the syllabary was completed in the early 1820s, it achieved almost instantaneous popularity and spread rapidly throughout Cherokee society.{{Sfn | Walker | Sarbaugh | 1993 | p = 70–72}} By 1825, the majority of Cherokees could read and write in their newly developed orthography.{{Sfn | McLaughlin | 1986 | p = 353}}

Some of Sequoyah's most learned contemporaries immediately understood that the syllabary was a great invention. For example, when [[Albert Gallatin]], a politician and trained linguist, saw a copy of Sequoyah's syllabary, he believed it was superior to the English alphabet. He recognized that even though the Cherokee student must learn 85 characters instead of 26 for English, the Cherokee could read immediately after learning all the symbols. The Cherokee student could accomplish in a few weeks what students of English writing might require two years to achieve.&lt;ref&gt;Langguth, A. J. (2010). ''Driven West: Andrew Jackson and the Trail of Tears to the Civil War''. New York, Simon &amp; Schuster. p. 71. {{ISBN|978-1-4165-4859-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1828, the order of the characters in a chart and the shapes of the characters were modified by Cherokee author and editor [[Elias Boudinot (Cherokee)|Elias Boudinot]] to adapt the syllabary to printing presses.&lt;ref name = ict&gt;[http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2010/03/16/cherokee-nation-creates-syllabary-keypad-81743 "Cherokee Nation creates syllabary keypad."] ''Indian Country Today.'' 17 March 2010 (retrieved 1 October 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; The 86th character was dropped entirely.{{Sfn | Kilpatrick | Kilpatrick | 1968 | p = 23}} Following these changes, the syllabary was adopted by the ''[[Cherokee Phoenix]]'' newspaper, later ''[[Cherokee Advocate]]'', followed by the ''Cherokee Messenger'', a bilingual paper printed in [[Indian Territory]] in the mid-19th century.{{Sfn | Sturtevant | Fogelson | 2004 | p = 362}}

In 1834, Worcester made changes to several characters in order to improve the readability of Cherokee text. Most notably, he inverted the ''do'' character (Ꮩ) so that it could not be confused with the ''go'' character (Ꭺ).{{Sfn | Giasson | 2004 | p = 29–33}} Otherwise, the characters remained remarkably invariant until the advent of new typesetting technologies in the 20th century.{{Sfn | Giasson | 2004 | p = 35}}

==Later developments==
[[File:Cherokee Central Schools.jpg|thumb|Sign in [[Cherokee, North Carolina]]]]
[[File:Cherokee stop sign.png|thumb|right|175px|Cherokee syllabary in use today, [[Tahlequah, Oklahoma]]]]
In the 1960s, the Cherokee Phoenix Press began publishing literature in the Cherokee syllabary, including the ''Cherokee Singing Book''.{{Sfn | Sturtevant | Fogelson | 2004 | p = 750}} A Cherokee syllabary typewriter ball was developed for the [[IBM Selectric]] in the late 1970s. Computer fonts greatly expanded Cherokee writers' ability to publish in Cherokee. In 2010, a Cherokee keyboard cover was developed by [[Roy Boney, Jr.]] and [[Joseph Erb]], facilitating more rapid typing in Cherokee. The keyboard cover is now used by students in the [[Cherokee Nation]] Immersion School, where all coursework is written in syllabary.&lt;ref name = ict/&gt;

In August 2010, the [[Oconaluftee Institute for Cultural Arts]] in [[Cherokee, North Carolina]] acquired a letterpress and had the Cherokee syllabary recast to begin printing one-of-a-kind fine art books and prints in syllabary.&lt;ref name="SCC"&gt;[http://www.southwesterncc.edu/news/10-jul-sept/letterpress.htm "Letterpress arrives at OICA"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130021125/http://www.southwesterncc.edu/news/10-jul-sept/letterpress.htm |date=November 30, 2010 }} ''Southwestern Community College'' (retrieved 21 Nov 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Artists Jeff Marley and [[Frank Brannon]] completed a collaborative project on October 19, 2013, in which they printed using Cherokee syllabary type from [[Southwestern Community College (North Carolina)|Southwestern Community College]] in the print shop at [[New Echota]]. This was the first time syllabary type has been used at New Echota since 1835.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.northwestgeorgianews.com/calhoun_times/news/local/new-echota-days-begin-this-saturday/article_5da73114-37fd-11e3-91e7-0019bb30f31a.html|title=New Echota days begin this Saturday|publisher=Calhoun Times|date=Oct 18, 2013|accessdate=21 July 2017|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the Unicode Consortium encoded a lowercase version of the script, since typists would often set Cherokee with two different point sizes, so as to mark beginnings of sentences and given names (as in the Latin alphabet). Handwritten Cherokee also shows a difference in lower- and uppercase letters, such as descenders and ascenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2014/14064-n4537-cherokee.pdf |format=PDF |title=Working group Document : Revised proposal for the addition of Cherokee characters to the UCS |publisher=Unicode.org |accessdate=2015-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lowercase Cherokee has already been encoded in the font [[Everson Mono]].

The syllabary is finding increasingly diverse usage today, from books, newspapers, and websites to the street signs of [[Tahlequah, Oklahoma]] and [[Cherokee, North Carolina]]. An increasing corpus of children's literature is printed in Cherokee syllabary to meet the needs of Cherokee students in the Cherokee language immersion schools in Oklahoma and North Carolina.{{citation needed| date= June 2017}}

==Possible influence on Liberian Vai syllabary==
In recent years evidence has emerged suggesting that the Cherokee syllabary provided a model for the design of the [[Vai script|Vai syllabary]] in [[Liberia]], Africa. The Vai syllabary emerged about 1832/33. The link appears to have been Cherokee who emigrated to Liberia after the invention of the Cherokee syllabary (which in its early years spread rapidly among the Cherokee) but before the invention of the Vai syllabary. One such man, Austin Curtis, married into a prominent [[Vai people|Vai]] family and became an important Vai chief himself. It is perhaps not coincidence that the "inscription on a house" that drew the world's attention to the existence of the Vai script was in fact on the home of Curtis, a Cherokee.{{Sfn | Tuchscherer | 2002}}  There also appears to be a connection between an early form of written [[Bassa language|Bassa]] and the earlier Cherokee syllabary.

==Classes==
[[File:Cherokeeclass.png|thumb|right|Oklahoma [[Cherokee language]] immersion school student writing in the Cherokee syllabary.]]
Cherokee languages classes typically begin with a transliteration of Cherokee into Roman letters, only later incorporating the syllabary.  The Cherokee language classes offered through [[Haskell Indian Nations University]], [[Northeastern State University]],&lt;ref name=ict/&gt; the [[University of Oklahoma]], the [[University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma]], [[Western Carolina University]], and the elementary school immersion classes offered by the Cherokee Nation and the [[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians]] Immersion School&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wcu.edu/6314.asp "Cherokee Language Revitalization Project."] ''Western Carolina University.'' (retrieved 23 Aug 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; all teach the syllabary. The fine arts degree program at [[Southwestern Community College (North Carolina)|Southwestern Community College]] incorporates the syllabary in its printmaking classes.&lt;ref name="SCC" /&gt;

==Unicode==
Cherokee was added to the [[Unicode]] Standard in September, 1999 with the release of version 3.0. On June 17, 2015, with the release of version 8.0, Cherokee was redefined as a [[bicameral script]]; the character repertoire was extended to include a complete set of lowercase Cherokee letters as well as the archaic character (Ᏽ).

===Blocks===
{{Main|Cherokee (Unicode block)|Cherokee Supplement|l2=Cherokee Supplement (Unicode block)}}

The first Unicode block for Cherokee is U+13A0&amp;ndash;U+13FF. It contains all 86 uppercase letters, together with six lowercase letters:{{refn|group=note|The PDF Unicode chart shows the modern form of the letter ''do''.}}

The Cherokee Supplement block is U+AB70&amp;ndash;U+ABBF. It contains the remaining 80 lowercase letters.

===Fonts===
A single Cherokee Unicode font, Plantagenet Cherokee, is supplied with [[macOS]], version 10.3 (Panther) and later. [[Windows Vista]] also includes a Cherokee font. Several free Cherokee fonts are available including Digohweli, Donisiladv, and [[Noto fonts|Noto Sans Cherokee]]. Some pan-Unicode fonts, such as [[Code2000]], [[Everson Mono]], and [[GNU FreeFont]], include Cherokee characters. A commercial font, Phoreus Cherokee, published by TypeCulture, includes multiple weights and styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Phoreus Cherokee|url=http://typeculture.com/foundry/font-collection/phoreus-cherokee/|website=TypeCulture|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''consumer complaint''' or '''customer complaint''' is "an expression of dissatisfaction on a consumer's behalf to a responsible party" (Landon, 1980). It can also be described in a positive sense as a report from a consumer providing documentation about a problem with a product or service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-consumer-complaint.htm |title=What Is a Consumer Complaint? |publisher=Wisegeek.com |date= |accessdate=December 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, some modern business consultants urge businesses to view customer complaints as a gift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bj-gallagher/a-complaint-is-a-gift_b_914505.html |title=BJ Gallagher: A Customer Complaint Is a Gift |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= August 1, 2011|accessdate=December 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bleuel |first=William |url=http://gbr.pepperdine.edu/2010/08/a-complaint-is-a-gift-by-janelle-barlow-and-claus-moller/ |title=The GBR Book Corner Reviews: A Complaint Is a Gift by Janelle Barlow and Claus Moller &amp;#124; Graziadio Business Review &amp;#124; Graziadio School of Business and Management &amp;#124; Pepperdine University |publisher=Gbr.pepperdine.edu |date=December 20, 2010 |accessdate=December 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consumer complaints are usually informal complaints directly addressed to a company or public service provider, and most consumers manage to resolve problems with products and services in this way, but it sometimes requires persistence.

If the grievance is not addressed in a way that satisfies the consumer, the consumer sometimes registers the complaint with a third party such as the Better Business Bureau, a county government (if it has a "consumer protection" office) and Federal Trade Commission (in the United States). These and similar organizations in other countries accept for consumer complaints and assist people with customer service issues, as do government representatives like [[state attorney general|attorneys general]]. Consumers however rarely file complaints in the more formal legal sense, which consists of a formal legal process (see the article on [[complaint]]).

In some countries (for example [[Ombudsmen in Australia|Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fido.gov.au/fido/fido.nsf/byheadline/Financial+services+complaints+schemes?openDocument|title=Australian Approved Complaint Services|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the United Kingdom,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/alia|title=Financial Ombudsman - UK|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many countries of the [[European Community]]), the making of consumer complaints, particularly regarding the sale of [[financial services]], is governed by [[statute]] (law). The [[statutory authority]] may require companies to reply to complaints within set time limits, publish written procedures for handling customer dissatisfaction, and provide information about arbitration schemes.

Internet forums and the advent of [[social media]] have provided consumers with a new way to submit complaints. Consumer news and advocacy websites often accept and publish complaints. Publishing complaints on highly visible websites increases the likelihood that the general public will become aware of the consumer's complaint. If, for example, a person with many "followers" or "friends" publishes a complaint on social media, it may go "viral".  Internet forums in general and on complaint websites have made it possible for individual consumers to hold large corporations accountable in a public forum.

A '''daybill''' is one variety of [[Australia]]n [[film poster]] issued to [[movie theater|cinemas]] at the time of a film's release. A daybill measures approximately {{convert|13|by|30|in|mm}}, however during [[World War II]] some daybills measured {{convert|10|by|30|in|mm}} because it allowed an additional daybill to fit onto the sheet of paper.&lt;ref name=moviemem&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian daybills 1941-1960|url=http://www.moviemem.com/pages/page.php?page=30|work=Australian Movie Posters|publisher=Movie Memorabilia|accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Daybills were folded twice and sold to cinemas for 5 to 10 cents.&lt;ref name=moviemem/&gt;

Until the 1970s, most daybills were printed as [[lithograph]]s. In the 1960s some posters began copying [[United States|American]] [[printing]] techniques to achieve a 'gloss' finish that suited the [[photograph]]ic images that were becoming prevalent in poster design. Today, daybills are printed on thick glossy paper and are much more durable.

Daybills are sought-after by [[Collecting|collectors]] for their rarity and unique [[Visual arts|artwork]]. Some of the more famous daybills include:

* [[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]] ([[John Carpenter]], 1978). Features a unique image of villain [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]]. Australia was the only country to depict Myers on the poster.
* [[The Empire Strikes Back]] ([[George Lucas]], 1980). Features artwork developed in [[Japan]], but considered superior among many collectors.

In sports, a '''depth chart''' is used to show the placements of the starting players and the secondary players. Generally a starting player will be listed first or on top while a back-up will be listed below. Depth charts also tend to resemble the actual position locations of certain players.&lt;ref name="LongCzarnecki2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Howie Long|author2=John Czarnecki|title=Football For Dummies, USA Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=an8ZIHOMda0C&amp;pg=PA244|accessdate=31 July 2013|date=12 May 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-01265-9|pages=244–|quote=A depth chart lists the starting lineups for both teams by their positions on offense and defense.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The typical [[Major League Baseball]] depth chart consists of  a list of players at each position, with the starter or first-string player listed first, followed by replacement and [[Platoon system|platoon players]].  For [[fantasy baseball]], typical preseason projection systems such as [[PECOTA]] construct depth charts that specify not just the order of the players at each position (starter, replacement or [[List of baseball jargon (B)#bench|bench player]]) but also the amount of playing time each person at that position will have. For example, at first base one player may be projected as playing 60 percent of the innings, and another 40 percent for the coming season, while at catcher one player may be projected as playing 80 percent of the innings, and another 20 percent.  For pitchers, the depth charts project the number of innings each roster player will pitch.

The [[line (ice hockey)|line system]] in [[ice hockey]] follows the same structure as a depth chart.

==Outside of sports==
The term depth chart is now also being used from the perspective of management theory, to address the process of key positioning leaders within the organization, considering a dynamic [[Product lifecycle (engineering)|life cycle]] perspective which includes developmental tasks such as those cited in books and articles related to the leadership pipeline subject.  A depth chart analysis for key positioning leaders should affect the development of leadership training programs and high performance development initiatives in modern corporations and enterprises.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3161">{{See also|Interpretation (logic)}}

According to [[Rudolf Carnap]], in [[logic]], an interpretation is a '''descriptive interpretation''' (also called a '''factual interpretation''') if at least one of the undefined symbols of its [[formal system]] becomes, in the interpretation, a ''[[descriptive sign]]'' (i.e., the name of single objects, or observable properties).&lt;ref name="itslaia"&gt;[[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap, Rudolf]], ''Introduction to Symbolic Logic and its Applications''&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Introduction to Semantics'' (Harvard Uni. Press, 1942) he makes a distinction between formal interpretations which are ''[[logical interpretation]]s'' (also called ''mathematical interpretation'' or ''logico-mathematical interpretation'') and ''descriptive interpretations'': a formal interpretation is a ''descriptive interpretation'' if it is not a ''logical interpretation''.&lt;ref name="itslaia"/&gt;

Attempts to [[Axiomatic system|axiomatize]] the [[empirical science]]s, Carnap said, use a ''descriptive interpretation'' to model reality.:&lt;ref name="itslaia"/&gt;  the aim of these attempts is to construct a [[formal system]] for which [[reality]] is the only interpretation.&lt;ref name="tcarotmim"&gt;The Concept and the Role of the Model in Mathematics and Natural and Social Sciences&lt;/ref&gt; - the world is an interpretation (or model) of these sciences, only insofar as these sciences are true.&lt;ref name="tcarotmim"/&gt;

Any non-empty set may be chosen as the domain of a descriptive interpretation, and all n-ary relations among the elements of the domain are candidates for assignment to any predicate of degree n.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Mates
  | first = Benson
  | title = Elementary Logic, Second Edition
  | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]
  | year = 1972
  | location = New York
  | pages = 56
  | isbn = 0-19-501491-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

A sentence is either ''true'' or ''false'' under an ''interpretation'' which assigns values to the logical variables. We might for example make the following assignments:

'''Individual constants'''
* a: Socrates
* b: Plato
* c: Aristotle
'''Predicates''':
* Fα:  α is sleeping
* Gαβ:  α hates β
* Hαβγ: α made β hit γ

'''Sentential variables:'''
* ''p''  "It is raining."

Under this interpretation the sentences discussed above would represent the following English statements:
* ''p'': "It is raining."
* ''F''(''a''): "Socrates is sleeping."
* ''H''(''b'',''a'',''c''):  "Plato made Socrates hit Aristotle."
* {{all}}''x''(''F''(''x'')): "Everybody is sleeping."
* {{exist}}''z''(''G''(''a'',''z'')):  "Socrates hates somebody."
* {{exist}}''x''{{all}}''y''{{exist}}''z''(''H''(''x'',''y'',''z'')):  "Somebody made everybody hit somebody."
* {{all}}''x''{{exist}}''z''(''F''(''x''){{and}}''G''(''a'',''z'')): Everybody is sleeping and Socrates hates somebody.
* {{exist}}''x''{{all}}''y''{{exist}}''z'' (''G''(''a'',''z''){{or-}}''H''(''x'',''y'',''z'')): Either Socrates hates somebody or somebody made everybody hit somebody.

'''Dhansukhlal Krishnalal Mehta''' was a [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] writer from [[Gujarat]], India. He is considered a pioneer of Gujarati short stories. His humorous novel ''[[Ame Badha]]'', co-written with [[Jyotindra Dave]], is widely regarded as one of the best humorous novels in [[Gujarati literature]]. He received the [[Ranjitram Suvarna Chandrak]] in 1940 and the [[Narmad Suvarna Chandrak]] in 1957.

==Life==
Dhansukhlal Mehta was born on October 20th, 1890 in the city of [[Wadhwan]], which is on the [[Kathiawar]] peninsula (now in [[Surendranagar district]], Gujarat). His family was native to [[Surat]]. After completing his schooling in Wadhwan, [[Palitana]] and Surat, he obtained a diploma from [[Victoria Jubilee Technical Institute]], [[Mumbai]]. From 1914 to 1925, he worked at various places in Mumbai, before joining [[Scindia Steam Navigation Company Ltd.]] in 1925.

He died on August 29th, 1974{{where|date=June 2018}}.&lt;ref name="Gujarati Sahitya Parishad"/&gt;

==Works==
Dhansukhlal Mehta wrote short stories, plays, literary criticism, book reviews, an autobiography, and humorous essays. According to [[Mansukhlal Jhaveri]], he was a pioneer of Gujarati short stories, and one of the first writers who depicted psychological conflicts in his characters.&lt;ref name="JhaveriAkademi1978"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mansukhlal Maganlal Jhaveri|authorlink=Mansukhlal Jhaveri|title=History of Gujarati Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DA0RAAAAMAAJ|year=1978|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|location=New Delhi|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; His short stories dealt with contemporary family life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Maharashtra State Gazetteers: Language and literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lMBd9PJ1sCoC|accessdate=19 April 2018|year=1953|publisher=Directorate of Government Printing, Stationery and Publications|page=371}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the ''Encyclopedia of Indian Literature'', he couldn't develop the short stories as an art form.&lt;ref name="Lal1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mohan Lal|title=Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature: Sasay to Zorgot|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KnPoYxrRfc0C&amp;pg=PA4041|accessdate=22 April 2018|year=1992|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-81-260-1221-3|page=4041}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began earnestly studying humorous writers of the West and wrote humorous essays, short stories, and sketches. In 1908, his short stories appeared in ''Jnanasudha'', a magazine edited by [[Ramanlal Desai]].&lt;ref name="Datta1988"&gt;{{cite book|author=Amaresh Datta|title=Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature: Devraj to Jyoti|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zB4n3MVozbUC&amp;pg=PA1602|accessdate=22 April 2018|year=1988|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-81-260-1194-0|page=1602}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Krishnalal Jhaveri]] wrote in ''Further Milestone in Gujarati Literature'', "Dhansukhlal Mehta never goes far afield in search of humor, but finds it in the actual work-a-day life around him. His art can be fully enjoyed only by a man who has lived in a small town in Gujarat, and as one read his works, he almost comes to love the everyday life of modern Gujarat in spite of its shortcomings."&lt;ref name="Jhaveri1956"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jhaveri|first=Krishnalal Mohanlal |author-link=Krishnalal Jhaveri |title=Further milestones in Gujarāti literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rqxHAAAAMAAJ|year=1956|edition=2nd|publisher=Forbes Gujarati Sabha|location=Mumbai|pages=321}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''East Flemish''' ({{lang-nl|Oost-Vlaams}}, {{lang-fr|flamand oriental}}) is a collective term for the two easternmost subdivisions ("true" East Flemish, also called Core Flemish,&lt;ref name="hoppenb"&gt;Hoppenbrouwers, Cor; Hoppenbrouwers, Geer (2001): De Indeling van de Nederlandse streektalen. {{ISBN|90 232 3731 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Waaslandic and their transitional and city dialects) of the so-called [[Flemish]] dialects, native to the southwest of the [[Dutch language]] area, which also include [[West Flemish]].&lt;ref name="wvdinl"&gt;Taeldeman, Johan (1979): Het klankpatroon van de Vlaamse dialecten. Een inventariserend overzicht. In ''Woordenboek van de Vlaamse Dialecten''. Inleiding.&lt;/ref&gt; Their position between West Flemish and [[Brabantian dialect|Brabantian]] has caused East Flemish dialects to be grouped with the latter as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{ELL2|Belgium}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are spoken mainly in the province of [[East Flanders]] and a narrow strip in the southeast of [[West Flanders]] in [[Belgium]] and eastern [[Zeelandic Flanders]] in the [[Netherlands]]. Even though the dialects of the Dender area are often discussed together with the East Flemish dialects because of their location, the latter are actually South Brabantian.&lt;ref name="tiselovl"&gt;Taeldeman, Johan (2005): Taal in Stad en Land: Oost-Vlaams.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Before the occurrence of written records, the [[dialect continuum]] that took shape in the [[Old Dutch]] language area was characterised mainly by differences from east to west, with the east showing more continental Germanic traits and the west having more coastal Germanic features.&lt;ref name="tiselovl" /&gt; In [[East Flanders]], it can be noted that not a single typical eastern [[Low Franconian]] trait has reached the region, but coastal characteristics are fairly common, albeit less so than more to the west.&lt;ref name="tiselovl" /&gt;

In the 15th century, the dominant position in the [[Low Countries]] shifted from the [[County of Flanders]] to the [[Duchy of Brabant]], which brought an expansian of linguistic traits from Brabant, the so-called 'Brabantic Expansion'. As the [[Scheldt]] formed a large barrier in the north, those traits were introduced mainly from [[South Brabant]], particularly the city of [[Brussels]].&lt;ref name="tiselovl" /&gt; The [[Dender]] area probably already started the process in the 14th century, but Ghent (and probably the rest of the province) resisted those changes for at least another century, as writings from [[Ghent]] still indicated a phonology that was typically [[West Flemish]] phonology in the mid-16th century.&lt;ref name="tiselovl" /&gt; Eventually, two processes caused the spread of Brabantian traits in eastern Flanders:
* The slow infiltration from the east, the Dender area;
* The spead of a trait in the biggest city (usually [[Ghent]]) from where it spread to the smaller cities and rural areas. For example, the Brussels pronunciation [yə] for [oə] was first used in Ghent and later spread to most of the province.

While the second process has caused a fairly wide extension of some traits, the traits spread by the first process have reached only the eastern quarter of the province: the Dender and [[Waasland]] areas.&lt;ref name="tiselovl" /&gt;

Having been dominated by the [[France|French]], the [[Austria|Austrians]] and the [[Spain|Spanish]], their languages have been other influences on the vocabulary of East Flemish.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==Subdivisions==
===Principal dialects===
* Core Flemish
** "True" East Flemish (often called "Boers", Dutch for peasant language, by speakers of city dialects)
*** Northeast Flemish&lt;ref name="dialectcd"&gt;Taeldeman, Johan (2004): Variatie binnen de Oost-Vlaamse dialecten. In: ''Azuuë Gezeid, Azuuë Gezoeng'n'', Vol. II: Oost-Vlaanderen. Wild Boar Music WBM 21902.&lt;/ref&gt;
*** Southeast Flemish&lt;ref name="dialectcd" /&gt;
** The [[Ghent]] dialect (insular city dialect)
** The [[Ronse]] dialect (insular city dialect)
** Central Flemish&lt;ref name="hoppenb" /&gt; (transitional with [[West Flemish]] with which it is also commonly classified)
* [[Waasland]]ic (transitional with [[Brabantian]])
** Waas
** Eastern Zeelandic Flemish or the Land-van-Hulst dialect
** The Hulst dialect (insular city dialect)

===Transitional and mixed dialects===
* The [[Maldegem]] dialect (transitional with coastal West Flemish though it also shows several innovative and intermediary traits) &lt;ref name="tiselovl" /&gt;
* The [[Philippine, Netherlands|Philippine]] dialect (mixing East Flemish and [[Zeelandic]] Flemish traits)&lt;ref name="tiselzeeuws"&gt;Van Driel, Lo (2004): Taal in Stad en Land: Zeeuws.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zvl"&gt;Taeldeman, Johan (1979): Op fonologische verkenning in Zeeuws-Vlaanderen. ''Taal en Tongval. Tijdschrift voor de studie van de Nederlandse volks- en streektalen'', 31, 143-193&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Sas van Gent]] dialect, a mixture of several dialects, as Sas van Gent was a colonial town with many people from different regions.&lt;ref name="tiselzeeuws" /&gt;
A special mention should go to continental West Flemish, which, despite being a [[West Flemish]] dialect, has some East Flemish colouring, as [[Kortrijk]] was historically governed under [[Ghent]].&lt;ref name="kortrijk"&gt;Debrabandere, Frans (1999), "Kortijk", in Kruijsen, Joep; van der Sijs, Nicoline, [http://dbnl.org/arch/sijs002hond01_01/pag/sijs002hond01_01.pdf Honderd Jaar Stadstaal], Uitgeverij Contact, pp. 289–299&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable characteristics==
Even though the East Flemish dialect area is one of the most diverse linguistic landscapes in Belgium,&lt;ref name="tiselovl" /&gt; the dialects share some traits that set them apart from [[Standard Dutch]] as well as the neighbouring dialects:
* The vowels in ''ziek'' ("ill") and ''voet'' ("foot") are pronounced as a short [i] and [u], respectively, like in Standard Dutch.&lt;ref name="wvdinl" /&gt; In Brabantian, they are long [i:] and [u:],&lt;ref name="tiselbrab"&gt;Ooms, Miet; Van Keymeulen, Jacques (2005): Taal in Stad en Land: Vlaams-Brabants en Antwerps.&lt;/ref&gt; and in West Flemish the ancient diphthongs [iə] and [uə] have been retained though the sound [u] occurs before [[velar]]s and [[labial consonant|labials]].&lt;ref name="tiselwvl"&gt;Devos, Magda; Vandekerckhove, Reinhild (2005): Taal in Stad en Land: West-Vlaams.&lt;/ref&gt; A notable exception is the dialects of Ghent and Rknse, which, apart from having a general tendency to stretch vowels, have diphthongised them in certain positions to [ɪ.i] and [o.u], respectively.&lt;ref name="tiselovl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="l-c"&gt;Lievevrouw-Coopman, Lodewijk (1950-1954): ''Gents Woordenboek''. Gent, Erasmus.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stadstaalgent"&gt;Taeldeman, Johan (1999), "Gent", in Kruijsen, Joep; van der Sijs, Nicoline, [http://dbnl.org/arch/sijs002hond01_01/pag/sijs002hond01_01.pdf Honderd Jaar Stadstaal], Uitgeverij Contact, pp. 273–288&lt;/ref&gt; The latter sound can also be heard in Central Flemish before velars and labials.&lt;ref name="tiselwvl" /&gt;
* The so-called sharp 'oo' in ''boom'' ("tree") is pronounced [yə], monophthongised to [y(:)] in the city dialects of [[Ghent]] and [[Ronse]], but surrounding dialects have [uə], [wo] or [ɔə].&lt;ref name="wvdinl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tiselovl" /&gt; That trait originally came from the dialect of [[Brussels]] and was spread through [[East Flanders]] via [[Ghent]]. Therefore, that pronunciation also occurs in the southernmost [[Brabantian dialect]]s.&lt;ref name="tiselovl" /&gt; Also, [y(ə)] has not spread across the entire East Flemish dialect area: the [[Maldegem]] dialect, the easternmost dialects of the [[Waasland]] and most dialects in [[Zeelandic Flanders]] use [uə] instead, and the Central Flemish dialects use [yə] or [uə], depending on the following consonant.&lt;ref name="wvdinl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="zvl" /&gt;
* The [[Old Dutch]] long vowels in ''ijs'' ("ice") and ''huis'' ("house") are pronounced as the soft diphthongs [ɛi] and [œi], respectively. Depending on their dialect and position, they have often been monophthongised to [ɛ] and [œ], respectively.&lt;ref name="wvdinl" /&gt; Coastal West Flemish has retained the old monophthongs [i] and [y], but western Brabantian uses very dark and heavy diphthongs.&lt;ref name="tiselovl" /&gt; In Maldegem and continental West Flemish, intermediary monophthongs also occur: [e] and [ø] and [ɪ] and [ʏ], respectively.&lt;ref name="wvdinl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tiselovl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kortrijk" /&gt; Exceptions are the city dialects of Ghent and Ronse as well as the Central Flemish dialects, which use heavy diphthongs similar to those of Brabantian.&lt;ref name="tiselovl" /&gt;
* Plural pronouns usually end in "ulder", like ''wulder'' ("we"), ''gulder'' ("you") and ''zulder'' ("they").&lt;ref name="tiselovl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MAND2"&gt;Goeman, Ton; Van Oostendorp, Marc; Van Reenen, Pieter; Koornwinder, Oele; Van den Berg, Boudewijn; Van Reenen, Anke (2008) Morfologische Atlas van de Nederlandse Dialecten, deel II. {{ISBN|9789053567746}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RND"&gt;Blancqaert, Edgar; Pée, Willem (1925 - 1982) Reeks Nederlandse Dialectatlassen&lt;/ref&gt; Those pronouns are also used in continental West Flemish, but [[Maldegem]] appears to use the coastal pronouns.&lt;ref name="tiselwvl" /&gt; 
* The past tense of [[weak inflection|weak verbs]] is formed with "-tege" or "-dege", as opposed to "-te" and "-de" of Standard Dutch and the surrounding dialects. While present in most East Flemish dialects as well as continental West Flemish and some [[Dender]] Brabantian dialects, that phenomenon seems to be diminishing in all but the Core Flemish area.&lt;ref name="tiselovl" /&gt;
* The ''-n'' of plurals and infinitives is usually retained, like in West Flemish, but it has been lost in Brabantian and in the dialects of Ghent and some Waaslaandic towns on the banks of the [[Scheldt]].&lt;ref name="tiselovl" /&gt;
* Subordinating conjunctions are conjugated. The Dutch combination ''...dat ze...'' would be in East Flemish ''...da(t) ze...'', pronounced /dɑ sə/, in the singular, and ''...dan ze ...'', pronounced /dɑn zə/, in the plural. That occurs also im West Flemish and [[Zeelandic]].&lt;ref name="synt"&gt;De Vogelaer, Gunther; Neuckermans, Annemie; Van den Heede, Vicky; Devos, Magda; van der Auwera, Johan (2004): De indeling van de Nederlandse dialecten: een syntactisch perspectief.&lt;/ref&gt;
* As in West Flemish and Brabantian, the subject is doubled or even tripled.&lt;ref name="synt" /&gt; Standard Dutch "ik ga" becomes East Flemish "'k goa-kik". In the dialects of Ghent and its surroundings, that duplication can occur even after nouns and names.&lt;ref name="tiselovl" /&gt;
* As in West Flemish, Zeelandic and Brabantian, infinitive clusters are always ordered V1-V2-V3, with the [[auxiliary verb]] first.&lt;ref name="synt" /&gt;
* As in most Belgian dialects, except those from the coast and [[Westhoek (region)|Westhoek]] and Brabantian dialects, double negations like ''niemand niet'' are commonly used.&lt;ref name="synt" /&gt;

==Phonology==
{{IPA notice}}
As the realisation of phonemes can be quite divergent in different East Flemish dialects, the phonemes represented here are based on the most common Core East Flemish realisations.

Notes:
* {{IPA|/g/}} occurs only in the consonant cluster {{IPA|/gz/}} or as an allophone of {{IPA|/k/}} when it undergoes the [[assimilation (phonology)|assimilation]] of [[Consonant voicing and devoicing|voicing]] or, for Core Flemish, intervocalic [[lenition]].&lt;ref name="tiselovl" /&gt;
* The most common realization of the {{IPA|/r/}} phoneme is an [[alveolar trill]] {{IPA|[r]}}, but [[uvular consonant|uvular]] realisations {{IPA|[ʀ]}} or {{IPA|[ʁ]}} are used in the dialects of [[Ronse]] and [[Ghent]] and are spreading from the latter.&lt;ref name="tiselovl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="stadstaalgent" /&gt;
* The lateral {{IPA|/l/}} is velarised postvocalically.&lt;ref name="wvdinl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="l-c" /&gt; In the dialects around [[Maldegem]], syllable-final {{IPA|/l/}} is omitted altogether.&lt;ref name="tiselovl" /&gt;
* In the western dialects, {{IPA|/ɣ/}} is usually realised as an approximant.&lt;ref name="wvdinl" /&gt;
* {{IPA|/ʃ/}} and {{IPA|/ʒ/}} are not native to many East Flemish dialects and usually occur from the [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalisation]] of {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/z/}}, respectively. That is especially common close to the Dender area.&lt;ref name="tiselovl" /&gt; Similarly, {{IPA|/tʃ/}} may merge into {{IPA|/ts/}} in some dialects like Platgents that lack postalveolar fricatives.&lt;ref name="l-c" /&gt;
* As in Standard Dutch, all plosives and fricatives are devoiced word-finally, but Core Flemish tends to voice plosives between a coloured vowel and {{IPA|/ə/}}.&lt;ref name="tiselovl" /&gt; In some dialects, /k/ also has the allophone {{IPA|[ʔ]}} in that position.&lt;ref name="wvdinl" /&gt;

===Vowels===
The following table gives an overview of some common phonemes in stressed syllables. Many East Flemish dialects have lost the phonemic vowel length distinction, but the distincition is made in the following table for the dialects that have kept it. Also, the central vowel /ə/ occurs only in unstressed syllables and is often heavily reduced or even omitted in many dialects.&lt;ref name="wvdinl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="l-c" /&gt;

Notes:
* In the true East Flemish dialects, {{IPA|/ɪ ʏ/}} are usually diphthongised to {{IPA|[ɪə øə]}}. In the dialects of Ghent and Ronse, on the other hand, {{IPA|/e ø/}} are diphthongised to {{IPA|/ɛɪ œʏ/}}.&lt;ref name="tiselovl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="stadstaalgent" /&gt;
* {{IPA|/ʏ/}} is merged into {{IPA|/ɪ/}} in several dialects.&lt;ref name="wvdinl" /&gt; That included a now-extinct lower-class Ghent dialect,&lt;ref name="winkler"&gt;Winkler, Johan (1974): ''Algemeen Nederduitsch en Friesch Dialecticon''. 's-Gravenhage.&lt;/ref&gt; which had the indirect effect of current Platgents rounding {{IPA|/ɪ/}} to {{IPA|/ʏ/}} in multiple words as a counterreaction.&lt;ref name="l-c" /&gt;
* {{IPA|/ɛ œ/}} are diphthongised to {{IPA|[ɛi œi]}} before /z/ and /v/. In some northwestern dialects, that is the common pronunciation in most positions. The same goes for {{IPA|/æi/}}, which has merged with {{IPA|/æ/}} in most dialects.&lt;ref name="wvdinl" /&gt;
* After /d/ or word-finally, {{IPA|/ɛ/}} is pronounced [æ] in most dialects. In the dialect of Ghent, it is pronounced [æ] or even [a] in most positions except before {{IPA|/ŋ/}}.&lt;ref name="wvdinl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="stadstaalgent" /&gt;
* {{IPA|/ɪ ɛ æ/}} are merged into {{IPA|[ɛ(i)]}} when they are followed by {{IPA|/ŋ/}}.&lt;ref name="wvdinl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="l-c" /&gt;
* When followed by alveolars, {{IPA|/ɔ/}} is diphthongised to {{IPA|[oə]}} in most dialects.&lt;ref name="wvdinl" /&gt; In the dialect of [[Ronse]], it is always pronounced [u].&lt;ref name="tiselovl" /&gt;
* In many dialects, /o/ and /o:/ have merged.&lt;ref name="tiselovl" /&gt; In the dialect of Ghent, the phoneme has later split, based on its position: {{IPA|[ɔu]}} before velars and labials and {{IPA|[o]}} before alveolars.&lt;ref name="l-c" /&gt;&lt;ref name="stadstaalgent" /&gt; One exception is the short /o/ in front of nasal consonants nasals, which has consistently become [u] in Ghent.&lt;ref name="wvdinl" /&gt; 
* {{IPA|/æ/}} and {{IPA|/ɑ/}} have become {{IPA|[ɪ] or [ɪə]}} and {{IPA|[æ]}}, respectively, when followed by an /r/, but that is no longer productive on more recent borrowings or when the /r/ is followed by an alveolar. When they are followed by /rm/, they become {{IPA|[oə]}} in many dialects.&lt;ref name="wvdinl" /&gt;
* In the Ghent dialect, /i/ has diphthongised to {{IPA|[ɪi]}}, /y/ has diphthongised to {{IPA|[yə]}} when followed by an /r/ or /l/, and /u/ has inconsistently diphthongised to [ou].&lt;ref name="l-c" /&gt;&lt;ref name="stadstaalgent" /&gt; The same diphthongisations of /i/ and /u/ occur consistently in the dialect of Ronse.&lt;ref name="tiselovl" /&gt;
* Word-finally or before {{IPA|/β̞/}}, /y/ can be pronounced [œ], [ɔ], [ʏ] etc., depending on the dialect.&lt;ref name="wvdinl" /&gt;
* In Platgents, {{IPA|/ə/}} has an allophone [o] when it is followed by /l/.&lt;ref name="stadstaalgent" /&gt;

===Diphthongs===

Notes:
* In most dialects, {{IPA|/yə̯/}} is realised {{IPA|[yə̯]}}, but some peripheral dialects have {{IPA|[uə̯]}}. Central Flemish has both sounds, depending on its position, but in the southeast of the [[Waasland]], it is pronounced {{IPA|[uə̯]}} or {{IPA|[iə̯]}}, depending on its position.&lt;ref name="wvdinl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tiselovl" /&gt;
* In the city dialects of [[Ghent]] and [[Ronse]], {{IPA|/yə̯/}} and {{IPA|/iə̯/}} are monophthongised to {{IPA|[y]}} and {{IPA|[i]}}, respectively.&lt;ref name="wvdinl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tiselovl" /&gt; In the Ghent dialect, diphthongs, however, are still realised before /r/ and /l/.&lt;ref name="l-c" /&gt;
* {{IPA|[ɪə̯]}} and {{IPA|[øə̯]}} are the "true" East Flemish realisations of {{IPA|/ɪ/}} and {{IPA|/ʏ/}}.&lt;ref name="tiselovl" /&gt;
* {{IPA|[oə̯]}} is an allophone of {{IPA|/ɔ/}}.&lt;ref name="wvdinl" /&gt;
* {{IPA|[ɛi̯]}} and {{IPA|[œi̯]}} are northwestern realisations of {{IPA|/ɛ/}} and {{IPA|/œ/}}, respectively, but {{IPA|/æi̯/}} is a separate phoneme from {{IPA|/æ/}} only in the same area.&lt;ref name="wvdinl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RND" /&gt; In many other dialects, diphthongs occur occur only before /v/ or /z/.&lt;ref name="wvdinl" /&gt; In the Central Flemish and the city dialects, those phonemes are generally realised as dark diphthongs.&lt;ref name="tiselovl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tiselwvl" /&gt;
* {{IPA|/ɛə̯/}} used to be an allophone of /e/ before /r/. Because of [[elision]] the elision of /r/, {{IPA|/ɛə̯/}} can now also be found before other consonants, and the elision of /d/ and [[French language|French]] loanwords have reintroduced [e] before /r/.&lt;ref name="wvdinl" /&gt; In the dialect of Ghent, {{IPA|/ɛə̯/}} is either similar or identical to {{IPA|/ɪ/}}.&lt;ref name="l-c" /&gt;
* In the dialect of Ghent, {{IPA|/u/}} has inconsistently split into two phonemes {{IPA|/ou̯/}} and {{IPA|/u/}}.&lt;ref name="l-c" /&gt; In the dialect of Ronse, {{IPA|[ou̯]}} is the common realisation for {{IPA|/u/}},&lt;ref name="tiselovl" /&gt; but in Central Flemish, {{IPA|[ɔu̯]}} is an allophone of {{IPA|/u/}} after velars or labials.&lt;ref name="tiselwvl" /&gt;
* {{IPA|[ɔu̯]}} is an allophone of /o/ in the dialect of Ghent, and its most common realisation in the dialect of Ronse.&lt;ref name="tiselovl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="l-c" /&gt;&lt;ref name="stadstaalgent" /&gt;
* {{IPA|/ɑu̯/}} is a highly-divergent phoneme in [[East Flanders]]. In most dialects, it has two different realisations:&lt;ref name="wvdinl" /&gt; when followed by /d/ or /w/, {{IPA|[ɑu̯]}} and {{IPA|[æu̯]}} are common realisations, bur before /t/ and /s/, it is usually pronounced {{IPA|[ɑi̯]}} or {{IPA|[æ]}}.&lt;ref name="tiselovl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="l-c" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RND" /&gt; Other realisations may, however, occur in both positions.

==Grammar==
===Verbs===
As in many other southern [[Dutch dialects]], verbal constructions can take several forms, depending on stress, the position of the subject and the next word.&lt;ref name="tiselovl"/&gt; Unlike [[West Flemish]], however, there is no [[subjunctive mood]].&lt;ref name="tiselwvl"/&gt; The following table gives the general rules of [[grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] in the present tense and the regular example of ''zwieren'' ("to toss"). The spelling is based on [[Dutch orthography]] with the addition of&amp;nbsp; ̊ &amp;nbsp;to show devoicing and&amp;nbsp; ̆  &amp;nbsp;to show vowel shortening.

Notes:
* The first-person singular varies depending on the dialect: western dialects tend to add ''-e'', but Waaslandic simply uses the stem.&lt;ref name="tiselovl" /&gt; For verbs with a vocal stem, like ''doen'' ("to do") Waaslandic and the dialects around Maldegem add ''-n'', but Core Flemish simply uses the stem.&lt;ref name="tiselovl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tiselwvl" /&gt;
* The ending ''-t'' in the second-person and the third-person singular has several realisations. When it is followed by a consonant or the neuter pronoun ''et'', it is not pronounced even if it devoices the following consonant. Before a pause, it is pronounced [t]. In front of vowels, it is usually prononounced [d] except when it follows a voiceless consonant, when it becomes [t].&lt;ref name="tiselovl" /&gt;
* In dialects that differentiate between long and short vowels, the stem vowel tends to be shortened in the third-person singular.&lt;ref name="wvdinl" /&gt; Compare Waaslandic "''gij sloapt''" with "''ij slopt''".
* Inversed forms tend to contract with the subject: verb + ''ge''"l becomes ''-de'' (''-te'' after a voiceless consonant), verb + singular ''ze'' becomes ''-se'' (written as ''-̊ze'' in the table above) and verb + ''we'' becomes ''-me''. When it is stressed, the pronoun is simply added to contracted form. In the first-person plural the contracted form also commonly occurs in the regular indicatives in main clauses.&lt;ref name="tiselovl" /&gt;

====Preterite====
Like most other [[Germanic languages]], East Flemish differentiates between [[Germanic strong verb|strong verbs]] and [[Germanic weak verb|weak verbs]]. Even though there are a few strong verbs in East Flemish that are weak in [[Standard Dutch]], the overall tendency is that East Flemish has more weak verbs.&lt;ref name="tiselovl" /&gt; Unlike many other Germanic languages, the rules for the conjugation  of the strong preterite are exactly the same as in the present tense.&lt;ref name="MAND2" /&gt; The weak preterite is formed by adding the suffix "-''dege''" ("-''tege''" when the stem ends in a voiceless consonant) to the verbal stem.&lt;ref name="tiselovl" /&gt; While an ''-n'' is usually added in the first-person and the third-person plural, the t-ending is not added except in a few southwestern dialects.&lt;ref name="MAND2" /&gt;

==Ghent dialect==
The dialect of the province's capital, [[Ghent]], is also different from the language of the surrounding region. The Brabantic expansion is believed to have started in Ghent, which has separated its speech from the other Flemish dialects. Some Brabantic traits were exported to other East Flemish dialects, but many were not. The most notable differences include ''n''-dropping and the more extreme diphthongisation of ''ii'' and ''uu''. At the same time, Ghent resisted many innovations characteristic for rural East Flanders. In the 19th and the early 20th centuries, the French uvular ''r'' was adopted.&lt;ref&gt;Johan Taeldeman (1985): ''De klankstructuren van het Gentse dialect. Een synchrone beschrijving en een historische en geografische situering''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Example-based machine translation''' ('''EBMT''') is a method of [[machine translation]] often characterized by its use of a bilingual [[text corpus|corpus]] with [[parallel text]]s as its main knowledge base at run-time. It is essentially a translation by [[analogy]] and can be viewed as an implementation of a [[case-based reasoning]] approach to [[machine learning]].

==Translation by analogy==
At the foundation of example-based machine translation is the idea of translation by analogy. When applied to the process of human translation, the idea that translation takes place by analogy is a rejection of the idea that people translate sentences by doing deep linguistic analysis. Instead, it is founded on the belief that people translate by first decomposing a sentence into certain phrases, then by translating these phrases, and finally by properly composing these fragments into one long sentence. Phrasal translations are translated by analogy to previous translations. The principle of translation by analogy is encoded to example-based machine translation through the example translations that are used to train such a system.

Other approaches to machine translation, including [[statistical machine translation]], also use bilingual corpora to learn the process of translation.

==History==
Example-based machine translation was first suggested by [[Makoto Nagao]] in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author= [[Makoto Nagao]] |title= Artificial and Human Intelligence |chapter= A framework of a mechanical translation between Japanese and English by analogy principle |editor= A. Elithorn and R. Banerji |year= 1984 |publisher= [[Elsevier Science Publishers]] |url= http://www.mt-archive.info/Nagao-1984.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; He pointed out that it is especially adapted to translation between two totally different languages, such as English and Japanese. In this case, one sentence can be translated into several well-structured sentences in another language, therefore, it is no use to do the deep linguistic analysis characteristic of [[rule-based machine translation]].

==Example==
{|align=center
|+'''Example of bilingual corpus'''
|-
!English |||| Japanese
|-
|How much is that '''red umbrella'''? |||| Ano '''akai kasa''' wa ikura desu ka.
|-
|How much is that '''small camera'''? |||| Ano '''chiisai kamera''' wa ikura desu ka.
|}

Example-based machine translation systems are trained from bilingual parallel corpora containing sentence pairs like the example shown in the table above. Sentence pairs contain sentences in one language with their translations into another. The particular example shows an example of a ''minimal pair'', meaning that the sentences vary by just one element. These sentences make it simple to learn translations of portions of a sentence. For example, an example-based machine translation system would learn three units of translation from the above example:
# ''How much is that'' '''X''' ''?'' corresponds to ''Ano '''X''' wa ikura desu ka.''
#  ''red umbrella'' corresponds to ''akai kasa''
#  ''small camera'' corresponds to ''chiisai kamera''

Composing these units can be used to produce novel translations in the future. For example, if we have been trained using some text containing the sentences:

''President Kennedy was shot dead during the parade.'' and ''The convict escaped on July 15th.'' We could translate the sentence ''The convict was shot dead during the parade.'' by substituting the appropriate parts of the sentences.

==Phrasal verbs==
Example-based machine translation is best suited for sub-language phenomena like [[phrasal verb]]s. Phrasal verbs have highly context-dependent meanings. They are common in English, where they comprise a verb followed by an [[adverb]] and/or a [[preposition]], which are called the [[particle (grammar)|particle]] to the verb. Phrasal verbs produce specialized context-specific meanings that may not be derived from the meaning of the constituents. There is almost always an ambiguity during word-to-word translation from source to the target language.

As an example, consider the phrasal verb "put on" and its [[Urdu/Hindi]] meaning. It may be used in any of the following ways:
*Ram put on the lights. (Switched on) (Urdu/Hindi translation: ''Jalana'')
*Ram put on a cap. (Wear) (Urdu/Hindi translation: ''Pahenna'')

A '''gazette''' is an [[official journal]], a [[newspaper of record]], or simply a [[newspaper]].

In English- and French-speaking countries, newspaper publishers have applied the name ''Gazette'' since the 17th century; today, numerous weekly and daily newspapers bear the name ''The Gazette''.

==Etymology==
''Gazette'' is a [[loanword]] from the French language; in turn, the French word is a 16th-century permutation of the Italian ''gazzetta'', which is the name of a particular [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] coin. ''Gazzetta'' became an [[epithet]] for ''newspaper'' during the early and middle 16th century, when the first Venetian newspapers cost one gazzetta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Etymological Dictionary of the Romance Languages |last=Diez |first=Friedrich |authorlink=Friedrich Christian Diez |year=1864 |publisher=Williams |location=[[London]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Compare with other vernacularisms from publishing lingo, such as the British ''[[penny dreadful]]'' and the American ''[[dime novel]]''.) This loanword, with its various [[Corruption (linguistics)|corruptions]], persists in numerous modern languages.

==Government gazettes==
{{Main|Government gazette}}
{{See also|List of government gazettes}}

In [[England]], with the 1665 founding of ''The Oxford Gazette'' (which became the ''[[London Gazette]]''), the word ''gazette'' came to indicate a public journal of the government; today, such a journal is sometimes called a [[government gazette]]. For some governments, publishing information in a gazette was or is a legal necessity by which official documents [[Coming into force|come into force]] and enter the [[public domain]]. Such is the case for documents published in ''[[Royal Thai Government Gazette]]'' (est. 1858), and in ''[[The Gazette of India]]'' (est. 1950).

The [[government of the United Kingdom]] requires government gazettes of its member countries. Publication of the ''[[Edinburgh Gazette]]'', the official government newspaper in Scotland, began in 1699. The ''[[Dublin Gazette]]'' of [[Ireland]] followed in 1705, but ceased when the [[Irish Free State]] seceded from the United Kingdom in 1922; the ''[[Iris Oifigiúil]]'' (Irish: ''Official Gazette'') replaced it. The ''[[Belfast Gazette]]'' of [[Northern Ireland]] published its first issue in 1921.

=={{Anchor|Gazettal}}''Gazette'' as a verb==&lt;!--linked from [[Adrian Johns]]--&gt;
In English, the [[transitive verb]] ''to gazette'' means "to announce or publish in a gazette"; especially where ''gazette'' refers to a public journal or a newspaper of record. For example, "[[Nakuru|Lake Nakuru]] was gazetted as a bird sanctuary in 1960 and upgraded to [[National Park]] status in 1968."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/sitefactsheet.php?id=6439 |title=Lake Nakuru National Park |website=birdlife.org |publisher=[[BirdLife International]] |date=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[British Army]] personnel decorations, promotions, and officer commissions are gazetted in the ''London Gazette'', the "Official Newspaper of Record for the United Kingdom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/about/info|title=Information Available |work=London Gazette |publisher=[[The Stationery Office]] |accessdate=3 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gazettal'' (a noun) is the act of gazetting; for example, "the gazettal of the bird sanctuary".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gazettal |title=gazettal |website=m-w.com |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] |accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''R. Ranganathan''' (7 October 1938 – 27 July 2016), known professionally as '''Gnanakoothan''', was an Indian poet. Writing in [[Tamil language|Tamil]], he was the author of ''Anru veru kizhamai'' ("That was another day"), ''Suriyanukku Pinpakkam'' ("The rear side of Sun"), ''Kadarkaraiyil Sila Marankal'' ("Few trees in the seashore"), ''Meendum Avarkal'' ("Them again"), and ''Pencil Padangal'' ("Pencil pictures"). He was one of the modern Tamil poet in [[Tamil literature]], and a regular contributor to topical columns in Tamil periodicals such as Kalki, Kalachuvadu and Uyirmai. He was one of the founder-editors of the little magazine Kacatathapara along with N. Krishnamurthy, Sa. Kandasamy, and N. Muthusamy. He started and ran Gavanam for a brief period. He was also one of the editors of Zha, along with Atmanam and R. Rajagopalan. He contributed to several little magazines including Maiyam, Vrutcham (now Naveena Vrutcham), and Kanaiyazhi. His works also appeared in little magazines like Illakkiya Vattam of Ka. Na. Subramaniam and C. Mani's Nadai, in which his poems appeared first. His works are known for its social satire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Five decades of Tamil Poetry by Rajaram Brammarajan|url=http://www.museindia.com/viewarticle.asp?myr=2006&amp;issid=9&amp;id=399|work=museindia.com|accessdate=5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indian Poets Writing in Tamil|url=http://www.oocities.org/indian_poets/tamil.html|work=oocities.org|accessdate=5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A slice of the sixties brought to life by T.

[[Image:Abiword grammar.jpg|thumb|[[AbiWord]] checks English grammar using [[Link Grammar]]]] 
A '''grammar checker''', in [[computing]] terms, is a [[Computer program|program]], or part of a program, that attempts to verify written text for [[grammatical correctness]]. Grammar checkers are most often implemented as a feature of a larger program, such as a [[word processor]], but are also available as a stand-alone [[application software|application]] that can be activated from within programs that work with editable text.

The implementation of a grammar checker makes use of [[natural language processing]].

==History==

The earliest "grammar checkers" were programs that checked for punctuation and style inconsistencies, rather than a complete range of possible grammatical errors. The first system was called [[Writer's Workbench]], and was a set of writing tools included with [[Unix]] systems as far back as the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2000/05/05/LivingLinux.html|title=Ideas - O'Reilly Media|website=www.linuxdevcenter.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsl.org/cookbook/cookbook_15.html  A. Walker: ''The Linux Cookbook'']&lt;/ref&gt; The whole ''Writer's Workbench'' package included several separate tools to check for various writing problems. The "diction" tool checked for wordy, trite, clichéd or misused phrases in a text. The tool would output a list of questionable phrases, and provide suggestions for improving the writing. The "style" tool analyzed the writing style of a given text. It performed a number of readability tests on the text and output the results, and gave some statistical information about the sentences of the text.

Aspen Software of [[Albuquerque, NM]] released the earliest version of a diction and style checker for personal computers, ''[[Grammatik]]'', in 1981. ''Grammatik'' was first available for a [[Radio Shack]] - [[TRS-80]], and soon had versions for [[CP/M]] and the [[IBM PC]]. Reference Software of San Francisco, CA, acquired ''Grammatik'' in 1985. Development of ''Grammatik'' continued, and it became an actual grammar checker that could detect writing errors beyond simple style checking.

Other early diction and style checking programs included ''Punctuation &amp; Style'', ''Correct Grammar'', ''RightWriter'' and ''PowerEdit''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dT0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA68|title=InfoWorld|first=InfoWorld Media Group|last=Inc|date=28 October 1991|publisher=InfoWorld Media Group, Inc.|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; While all the earliest programs started out as simple diction and style checkers, all eventually added various levels of language processing, and developed some level of true grammar checking capability.

Until 1992, grammar checkers were sold as add-on programs. There were a large number of different word processing programs available at that time, with [[WordPerfect]] and [[Microsoft Word]] the top two in market share. In 1992, [[Microsoft]] decided to add grammar checking as a feature of Word, and  licensed CorrecText, a grammar checker from [[Houghton Mifflin]] that had not yet been marketed as a standalone product. WordPerfect answered Microsoft's move by acquiring Reference Software, and the direct descendant of ''Grammatik'' is still included with WordPerfect.

There are [[Free and open-source software|free and open-source]] grammar checking software like [[LanguageTool]].

==Technical issues==
The earliest writing style programs checked for wordy, [[wikt:trite|trite]], [[cliché]]d, or misused phrases in a text. This process was based on simple [[pattern matching]]. The heart of the program was a list of many hundreds or thousands of phrases that are considered poor writing by many experts. The list of questionable phrases included alternative wording for each phrase. The checking program would simply break text into sentences, check for any matches in the phrase dictionary, flag suspect phrases and show an alternative. These programs could also perform some mechanical checks. For example, they would typically flag doubled words, doubled punctuation, some [[capitalization]] errors, and other simple mechanical mistakes.

True grammar checking is more complex. While a [[computer programming language]] has a very specific syntax and grammar, this is not so for [[natural language]]s. One can write a somewhat complete [[formal grammar]] for a natural language, but there are usually so many exceptions in real usage that a formal grammar is of minimal help in writing a grammar checker. One of the most important parts of a natural language grammar checker is a [[dictionary]] of all the words in the language, along with the part of speech of each word. The fact that a natural word may be used as any one of several different parts of speech (such as "free" being used as an adjective, adverb, noun, or verb) greatly increases the complexity of any grammar checker.

A grammar checker will find each sentence in a text, look up each word in the dictionary, and then attempt to [[parse]] the sentence into a form that matches a grammar. Using various rules, the program can then detect various errors, such as agreement in [[Grammatical tense|tense]], number, [[word order]], and so on. It is also possible to detect some stylistic problems with the text. For example, some popular style guides such as [[The Elements of Style]] deprecate excessive use of the [[passive voice]]. Grammar checkers may attempt to identify passive sentences and suggest an active-voice alternative.

The software elements required for grammar checking are closely related to some of the development issues that need to be addressed for [[voice recognition software]]. In voice recognition, parsing can be used to help predict which word is most likely intended, based on part of speech and position in the sentence. In grammar checking, the parsing is used to detect words that fail to follow accepted grammar usage.

Recently, research has focused on developing algorithms which can recognize grammar errors based on the context of the surrounding words. Context-based grammar checkers appear in [[Microsoft Office 2010]], [[Microsoft Office 2007]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/public/article/SB116786111022966326-T8UUTIl2b10DaW11usf4NasZTYI_20080103.html?mod=tff_main_tff_top |title=Review |author=Walt Mossberg |date= 4 January 2007|work= |publisher=Wall Street Journal |accessdate=24 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Google Wave]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2009/05/googles-context-sensitive-spell-checker.html |title=Google Operating System  |author= |date= |work= |publisher=googlesystem.blogspot.com |accessdate=25 September 2010}} {{cite web |url=http://googlesystem.blogspot.co.uk/2009/05/googles-context-sensitive-spell-checker.html|title=Google's Context-Sensitive Spell Checker |author= |date=May 29, 2009 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=25 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghotit Dyslexia Software,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.tauscher.org/2011/04/contextual-spell-checker-evaluation.html |title=Contextual Spell Checker Evaluation | author= Dr. Linda Tauscher |date=  April 21, 2011|work= |publisher= Assistive Technology And Accessibility |accessdate=14 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grammarly]],&lt;ref name=TheHindu&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/metroplus/article2473074.ece |title=Cool tool |author=Geeta Padmanabhan |publisher=''[[The Hindu Group]]'' |newspaper=''[[The Hindu]]'' |date=September 21, 2011 |accessdate=December 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://smallseo.tools/grammar-checker |title=Grammar Checker Tool |accessdate=November 1, 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/cherylsnappconner/2012/10/21/i-dont-tolerate-poor-grammar/ |title=I Don't Tolerate Poor Grammar |author=Cheryl Conner |publisher=''Forbes publishing'' |magazine=''[[Forbes]]'' |pages=1–2 |date=October 21, 2012 |accessdate=December 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[SpellCheckPlus.com]], Nounplus.net, GrammarCheck.net, PaperRater, [[Ginger Software]], [[VirtualWritingTutor.com]], and WhiteSmoke.

==Criticism==
Grammar checkers are considered as a type of [[foreign language writing aid]] which non-native speakers can use to proofread their writings as such programs endeavor to identify syntactical errors.&lt;ref name=Bustamante&gt;Bustamante, F.R., &amp; León, F.S, (1996). [http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/1000000/992661/p175-bustamante.pdf?ip=220.255.2.169&amp;acc=OPEN&amp;CFID=91589205&amp;CFTOKEN=38095021&amp;__acm__=1332492182_c3de2b2c34a6a2a43caa1b79d36e60ea GramCheck: a grammar and style checker]. ''Proceedings of the 16th conference on Computational linguistics'', August 05–09, Copenhagen, Denmark. Retrieved 19 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as with other computerized writing aids such as [[spell checker]]s, popular grammar checkers are often criticized when they fail to spot errors and incorrectly flag correct text as erroneous.  The linguist [[Geoffrey K. Pullum]] argued in 2007 that they were generally so inaccurate as to do more harm than good: "for the most part, accepting the advice of a computer grammar checker on your prose will make it '''much''' worse, sometimes hilariously incoherent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005061.html |author=Geoffrey K.

[[File:Acker Winter.JPG|thumb|Arable land in winter. The headland in the foreground&lt;!-- Ackerfläche im Winter, im Vordergrund das parallel zum Ackerrand bestellte Vorgewende--&gt;]]

A '''Headland''', in [[agriculture]], is the area at each end of a planted field. In some areas of the [[United States]], this area is known as the '''Turnrow'''. It is used for turning around with [[Agricultural machinery|farm implements]] during field operations and is the first area to be [[harvest]]ed to minimize [[crop]] damage. The rows run perpendicular to the lay of the field and are usually two, three or four times the width of the implement used for planting the field.

==Characteristics==
The soil on headlands is subject to greater levels of [[soil compaction]] because it receives more traffic per unit of area than the field as a whole. Yields are generally lower than in the field itself due to additional implement traffic and crop damage from implements turning on them as well as compaction. [[Soil fertility]] levels are frequently higher than in the main part of the field due to overlapping applications of fertilizer coupled with reduced yields.

==Steam ploughing==
[[File:Fowler ploughing engine in Staplehurst.jpg|thumb|A steam ploughing engine]]
In the days when [[Ploughing engine|steam ploughing]] was common, the engine would often remain on the headland and pull the [[plough]] across the field by a [[wire rope]].  There would be severe compaction of the headland but little compaction of the rest of the field. There would usually be two engines, one on each headland, and they would [[winch]] the plough to and fro between them.

'''Highland East Cushitic''', or '''Sidamic''', is a branch of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic language family]] spoken in south-central [[Ethiopia]]. They are often grouped with [[Lowland East Cushitic languages|Lowland East Cushitic]], [[Dullay languages|Dullay]], and [[Yaaku language|Yaaku]] as ''East Cushitic'', but that group is not well defined and considered dubious.

The languages are: 
*[[Burji language|Burji]] (divergent)
*Sidamic proper
**[[Sidamo language|Sidamo]]
**[[Gedeo language|Gedeo]]
**[[Hadiyya language|Hadiyya]]–[[Libido language|Libido]]
**[[Kambaata language|Kambaata]]–[[Alaba-K'abeena language|Alaba]].

Except for Burji, they are closely related. Hadiyya and Libido are especially close, as are Kambaata and Alaba. The most populous language is [[Sidamo language|Sidamo]], with close to two million speakers.

[[File:Ispell aŭtonome 485.png|thumb|Ispell suggesting words in [[Esperanto]]]]
'''Ispell''' is a [[spelling checker]] for [[Unix]] that supports most Western languages.  It offers several interfaces, including a programmatic interface for use by editors such as [[emacs]].  Unlike [[GNU Aspell]], ispell will only suggest corrections that are based on a [[Damerau–Levenshtein distance]] of 1; it will not attempt to guess more distant corrections based on English pronunciation rules.
Ispell has a very long history that can be traced back to 
a program that was originally written in 1971 in [[PDP-10]] [[Assembly language]] by [[R. E. Gorin]], and later ported to the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] and expanded by many others.
It is currently maintained by Geoff Kuenning.
The generalized affix description system introduced by ispell has since been imitated by other spelling
checkers such as [[MySpell]].

Like most computerized spelling checkers, ispell works by reading an input file word by word, stopping when a word is not found in its dictionary.  Ispell then attempts to generate a list of possible corrections and presents the incorrect word and any suggestions to the user, who can then choose a correction, replace the word with a new one, leave it unchanged, or add it to the dictionary.

Ispell pioneered the idea of a  [[Application programming interface|programming interface]], which was originally intended for use by [[emacs]].  Other applications have since used the feature to add spell-checking to their own interface, and [[GNU Aspell]] has adopted the same interface so that it can be used with the same set of applications.

There are ispell dictionaries for most widely spoken Western languages.

Ispell is available under a specific [[open-source license]].

{{Culture of Australia}}

Although Australia has no official languages, English has been entrenched as the ''[[de facto]]'' national language since European settlement.&lt;ref name=language&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dss.gov.au/our-responsibilities/settlement-and-multicultural-affairs/programs-policy/a-multicultural-australia/programs-and-publications/1995-global-cultural-diversity-conference-proceedings-sydney/culture-education-and-language/pluralist-nations-pluralist-language |title=Pluralist Nations: Pluralist Language Policies? |work=1995 Global Cultural Diversity Conference Proceedings, Sydney |publisher=[[Department of Social Services]] |accessdate=10 July 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220020910/http://www.immi.gov.au/media/publications/multicultural/confer/04/speech18b.htm |archivedate=20 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }} "English has no de jure status but it is so entrenched as the common language that it is de facto the official language as well as the national language."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Australian English]] is a major variety of the language with a distinctive accent and lexicon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nma.gov.au/libraries/attachments/exhibitions/vocabulary_of_australian_english/files/5471/Vocabulary%20of%20Australian%20English.pdf |title=The Vocabulary Of Australian English |last=Moore |first=Bruce |publisher=National Museum of Australia |accessdate=5 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110320004658/http://www.nma.gov.au/libraries/attachments/exhibitions/vocabulary_of_australian_english/files/5471/Vocabulary%20of%20Australian%20English.pdf |archivedate=20 March 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and differs slightly from other varieties of English in grammar and spelling.&lt;ref name="Fourth Edition 2005"&gt;"The Macquarie Dictionary", Fourth Edition. The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; [[General Australian]] serves as the standard dialect. 

According to the 2016 census, English is the only language spoken in the home for close to 73% of the population. The next most common languages spoken at home are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/2071.0~2016~Main%20Features~Cultural%20Diversity%20Article~20 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-07-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170709233002/http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/2071.0~2016~Main%20Features~Cultural%20Diversity%20Article~20 |archivedate=9 July 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] (2.5%), [[Arabic language|Arabic]] (1.4%), [[Cantonese]] (1.2%), [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] (1.2%) and [[Italian language|Italian]] (1.2%). 

A considerable proportion of first- and second-generation migrants are bilingual.

Over 250 [[Indigenous Australian languages]] are thought to have existed at the time of first European contact, of which less than 20 are still in daily use by all age groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/news/2011/08/a-mission-to-save-indigenous-languages/|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131224075354/http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/news/2011/08/a-mission-to-save-indigenous-languages/|archivedate= 24 December 2013| title=A mission to save indigenous languages| publisher=Australian Geographic|accessdate=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nilsr/&gt; About 110 others are spoken exclusively by older people.&lt;ref name=nilsr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arts.gov.au/sites/default/files/pdfs/nils-report-2005.pdf |title=National Indigenous Languages Survey Report 2005 |publisher=Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts |accessdate=5 September 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709141342/http://www.arts.gov.au/indigenous/national_indigenous_languages_survey_report_2005 |archivedate=9 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the 2006 census, 52,000 Indigenous Australians, representing 12% of the Indigenous population, reported that they spoke an Indigenous language at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/4713.0 |title=4713.0 – Population Characteristics, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, 2006 |last=Australian Bureau of Statistics |date=4 May 2010 |publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics |location=Canberra |accessdate=7 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia has a [[sign language]] known as [[Auslan]], which is the main language of about 5,500 deaf people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/ABSNavigation/prenav/ViewData?action=404&amp;documentproductno=0&amp;documenttype=Details&amp;order=1&amp;tabname=Details&amp;areacode=0&amp;issue=2006&amp;producttype=Census%20Tables&amp;javascript=true&amp;textversion=false&amp;navmapdisplayed=true&amp;breadcrumb=POTLD&amp;&amp;collection=Census&amp;period=2006&amp;productlabel=Language%20Spoken%20at%20Home%20(full%20classification%20list)%20by%20Sex&amp;producttype=Census%20Tables&amp;method=Place%20of%20Usual%20Residence&amp;topic=Language&amp; |title=20680-Language Spoken at Home (full classification list) by Sex – Australia |last=Australian Bureau of Statistics |date=27 June 2007 |work=2006 Census Tables : Australia |location=Canberra |publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics |accessdate=7 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australian Aboriginal languages==
{{Main|Indigenous Australian languages}}
It is believed that there were almost 400 Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait languages at the time of first European contact. Most of these are now either [[language death|extinct or moribund]], with only about fifteen languages still being spoken among all age groups of the relevant tribes.&lt;ref&gt;McConvell, P. &amp; N.Thieberger. 2001. State of Indigenous Language Report. http://www.environment.gov.au/soe/2001/publications/technical/indigenous-languages.html&lt;/ref&gt;

An indigenous language remains the main language for about 50,000 (0.25%) people. Australia has a sign language known as [[Auslan]], which is the main language that approximately 10,000 deaf people use. Chinese is by far the most spoken foreign language, with 715,000 speakers as of 2016, and has even been considered to be put on signs across Australia, to encourage tourists to explore and interact with other people{{citation required|date=February 2017}}.

The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island languages with the most speakers today are [[Upper Arrernte language|Upper Arrernte]], [[Kalaw Lagaw Ya]], [[Tiwi language|Tiwi]], [[Walmajarri language|Walmajarri]], [[Warlpiri language|Warlpiri]], and the [[Western Desert language]].

===Tasmanian languages===
{{Main|Tasmanian languages}}

===Torres Strait languages===
{{Main|Torres Strait Island languages}}
Two languages are spoken on the islands of the [[Torres Strait]], within Australian territory, by the Melanesian inhabitants of the area: [[Kalaw Lagaw Ya]] and [[Meriam language|Meriam]]. Meriam Mir is a [[Papuan languages|Papuan language]], while Kalaw Lagaw Ya is an Australian language.

===Pidgins and creoles===
Two English-based [[creole language|creole]]s have arisen in Australia after European contact: [[Australian Kriol language|Kriol]] and [[Torres Strait Creole]]. Kriol is spoken in the [[Northern Territory]] and [[Western Australia]], and [[Torres Strait Creole]] in Queensland and south-west Papua.

[[Broome Pearling Lugger Pidgin]] was a [[pidgin]] used as a [[lingua franca]] between [[Malay race|Malays]], Japanese, [[Viet Nam|Vietnamese]], [[Torres Strait Islanders]] and [[Australian Aborigines|Aborigines]] on [[pearl hunting|pearling]] boats.

==Immigrant languages==

There has been a steady decline in the percentage of Australians who speak only English at home since at least 2001. According to the 2001 census, English was the only language spoken in the home for around 80% of the population. By the 2006 census it had fallen to  close to 79%, while in the 2011 census, that number had fallen to 76.8%. According to the 2016 census, English is the only language spoken in the home for close to 72.7% of the population. The next most common languages spoken at home are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/2071.0~2016~Main%20Features~Cultural%20Diversity%20Article~20 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-07-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170709233002/http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/2071.0~2016~Main%20Features~Cultural%20Diversity%20Article~20 |archivedate=9 July 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''liana''' is any of various long-[[Plant stem|stemmed]], [[Woody plant|woody]] [[vine]]s that are [[root]]ed in the soil at ground level and use trees, as well as other means of vertical support, to climb up to the [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] to get access to well-lit areas of the forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/338786/liana |title=liana|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lianas are characteristic of [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist deciduous forests]] (especially [[Tropical seasonal forest|seasonal forests]]), but may be found in [[temperate rainforests]]. There are also [[temperate]] lianas, for example the members of the ''[[Clematis]]'' or ''[[Vitis]]'' (wild grape) genera. Lianas can form bridges amidst the forest canopy, providing [[Arboreal locomotion|arboreal]] animals with paths across the forest. These bridges can protect weaker trees from strong winds. Lianas compete with forest trees for sunlight, water and nutrients from the soil.&lt;ref name="SCHNITZER-BONGERS"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schnitzer |first1=S. A. |last2=Bongers |first2=F. |year=2002 |title=The ecology of lianas and their role in forests |journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution |volume=17 |issue=5 |pages=223–230 |doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(02)02491-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forests without lianas grow 150% more fruit; trees with lianas have twice the probability of dying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Landers|first1=Jackson|title=Tarzan's Favorite Mode of Travel, the Liana Vine, Chokes Off a Tree's Ability to Bear Fruit|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/tarzans-mode-travel-liana-vine-chocking-tropical-forests-180963636/|accessdate=20 June 2017|work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]|date=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "liana" is not a [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] grouping, but rather a description of the way the plant grows – much like "[[tree]]" or "[[shrub]]". Lianas may be found in many different plant [[family (biology)|families]]. One way of distinguishing lianas from trees and shrubs is based on the [[stiffness]], specifically, the [[Young's modulus]] of various parts of the stem. Trees and shrubs have young twigs and smaller branches which are quite flexible and older growth such as [[Trunk (botany)|trunks]] and large branches which are stiffer. A liana often has stiff young growths and older, more flexible growth at the base of the stem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.3732/ajb.92.8.1381 | title = Evolution of shrub-like growth forms in the lianoid subfamily Secamonoideae (Apocynaceae s.l.) of Madagascar: phylogeny, biomechanics, and development | year = 2005 | author = Lahaye, R. | journal = American Journal of Botany | volume = 92 | pages = 1381–96 | last2 = Civeyrel | first2 = L. | last3 = Speck | first3 = T. | last4 = Rowe | first4 = N.

For example, in the Eastern [[tropical forest]]s of [[Madagascar]], many [[lemur]]s achieve higher mobility from the web of lianas draped amongst the vertical tree species. Many lemurs prefer trees with lianas for their roost sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rendigs |first1=A. |last2=Radespiel |first2=U. |last3=Wrogemann |first3=D. |last4=Zimmermann |first4=E. |year=2003 |title=Relationship between microhabitat structure and distribution of mouse lemurs (Microcebus spp.) in northwestern Madagascar |journal=International Journal of Primatology |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=47–64 |doi=10.1023/A:1021494428294}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lianas also provide support for trees when strong winds blow.&lt;ref name="GarridoPerez"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Garrido-Pérez |first1=E.

As noted by [[Charles Darwin]], because lianas are supported by other plants, they may conserve resources that other plants must allocate to the development of structure and use them instead for growth and reproduction. In general, lianas are detrimental to the trees that support them. Growth rates are lower for trees with lianas; they directly damage hosts by mechanical abrasion and strangulation, render hosts more susceptible to ice and wind damage, and increase the probability that the host tree falls. Lianas also make the canopy of trees more accessible to animals which eat leaves. Because of these negative effects, trees which remain free of lianas are at an advantage; some species have evolved characteristics which help them avoid or shed lianas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.2307/2387889| jstor = 2387889| pages = 19–23| title = How trees avoid and shed lianas| journal = Biotropica| volume = 16| issue = 1| year = 1984| author1 = Putz | first1 = F.

'''Novial''' [''nov-'' ("new") + ''IAL, International Auxiliary Language''] is a [[constructed language|constructed]] [[international auxiliary language]] (IAL) for universal communication between speakers of different [[native language]]s.  It was devised by [[Otto Jespersen]], a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[linguistics|linguist]] who had been involved in the [[Ido (language)|Ido]] movement, and later in the development of [[Interlingua de IALA]].

Its vocabulary is based largely on the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] and [[Romance languages]] and its grammar is influenced by [[English language|English]].

Novial was introduced in Jespersen's book ''An International Language'' in 1928.&lt;ref name="Jesp"&gt;Jespersen, Otto (1928). [http://www.feedbooks.com/userbook/14934 ''An international language'']. London: Allen &amp; Unwin. LC no 29000603.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was updated in his dictionary ''Novial Lexike'' in 1930,&lt;ref&gt;Jespersen, Otto (1930). [http://www.blahedo.org/novial/nl.html ''Novial lexike, international dictionary, dictionnaire international, internationales Wörterbuch'']. London: G. Allen &amp; Unwin. LC no 31014004.&lt;/ref&gt; and further modifications were proposed in the 1930s, but the language became dormant with Jespersen's death in 1943.&lt;ref name="Ager"&gt;Ager, Simon. [http://www.omniglot.com/writing/novial.htm Novial (Nov International Auxiliari Lingue)]. Retrieved from [http://www.omniglot.com omniglot.com] on the 20th Dec. 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, with the revival of interest in constructed languages brought on by the [[Internet]], some people rediscovered Novial.&lt;ref name="Ager"/&gt;

==''An International Language''==
Novial was first described in Jespersen’s book ''An International Language'' (1928). Part One of the book discusses the need for an IAL, the disadvantages of ethnic languages for that purpose, and common objections to constructed IALs. He also provides a critical overview of the history of constructed IALs with sections devoted to [[Volapük]], [[Esperanto]], [[Idiom Neutral]], [[Ido language|Ido]], [[Latino sine Flexione]] and [[Occidental language|Occidental]] ([[Interlingue]]). The author makes it clear that he draws on a wealth of earlier work on the problem of a constructed IAL, not only the aforementioned IALs.

Part Two of ''An International Language'' describes Novial in detail. Alternative possible solutions for problems in the phonology, orthography, grammar and vocabulary are considered. The choices made are explained by comparison with ethnic languages and previously constructed IALs.

*The letter S occurring among vowels may sound /z/.
*The letter J may be pronounced /dʒ/.
*The digraph CH may be pronounced /ʃ/.
Jespersen suggested that it might be possible instead of the digraph SH to use the phonetic symbol ʃ.&lt;ref name="Jesp"/&gt;

In Novial, nominative and oblique pronouns are identical.

The standard [[word order]] is subject-verb-object, as in English. Therefore, the object need not be marked to distinguish it from the subject:
E.g.:
* ''me observa vu'' – "I observe you"
* ''vu observa me'' – "you observe me"

The accusative (direct object) is therefore most often identical to the nominative (subject). However, in case of an ambiguity problem, an optional accusative ending, '''''-m''''' ('''''-em''''' after a consonant), is available but is rarely used. The preposition '''''em''''' is equivalent to this ending.

The personal possessive adjectives are formed from the pronouns by adding '''''-n''''' or after a consonant '''''-en'''''. This is in fact the genitive (possessive) of the pronoun so ''men'' means both "my" and "mine" ("of me"):
E.g.:
* "My dog" = Men Hunde
* "The dog is mine" = Li Hunde es men

Possession may also be expressed with the preposition '''''de''''': ''de me'', ''de vu'', and so on.

===Verbs===
Verb forms never change with person or number. Most verb tenses, moods and voices are expressed with auxiliary verbs preceding the root form of the main verb. The auxiliaries follow the same word order as the English equivalent. The pronouns are indicated with parentheses and are given for example purposes.

* Present active participle: ''protektent'' – "protecting"
* Past passive participle: ''protektet'' – "protected"

Novial clearly distinguishes the passive of becoming and the passive of being.  In English the forms are often the same, using the auxiliary verb ''to be'' followed by the past participle. However, the passive of becoming is also often expressed with the verb ''to get'' which is used in the examples below.

The passive voice of becoming is formed with the auxiliary '''''bli''''' followed by the root verb form.

|}

===Articles===
The definite article is ''li'' which is invariant. It is used as in English.

There is no indefinite article, although ''un'' (one) can be used.

===Nouns===
The plural noun is formed by adding '''''–s''''' to the singular ('''''-es''''' after a consonant).

The [[accusative case]] is generally identical to the [[nominative case|nominative]] but can optionally be marked with the ending '''''-m''''' ('''''-em''''' after a consonant) with the plural being '''''-sem''''' ('''''-esem''''' after a consonant) or with the preposition '''''em'''''.

The genitive is formed with the ending '''''-n''''' ('''''-en''''' after a consonant) with the plural being '''''-sen''''' ('''''-esen''''' after a consonant) or with the preposition '''''de'''''.

Other cases are formed with prepositions.

===Adjectives===
All adjectives end in '''''-i''''', but this may be dropped if it is easy enough to pronounce and no confusion will be caused. Adjectives precede the noun qualified. Adjectives do not agree with the noun but may be given noun endings if there is no noun present to receive them.

Comparative adjectives are formed by placing various particles (''plu, tam,'' and ''min'') in front of the adjective receiving the comparison. Likewise, the superlative particles (''maxim'' and ''minim'') precede the adjective. The adjective does not receive an inflection to its ending.

===Adverbs===
An adjective is converted to a corresponding adverb by adding '''''-m''''' after the '''''-i''''' ending of the adjective.

Comparative and superlative adverbs are formed in the same manner as comparative and superlative adjectives: by placing a specific particle before the adverb receiving the comparison.

==Vocabulary==
===Affixes===
See the [[b:Novial/Hound Appendix 1|Table of Prefixes]] and [[b:Novial/Hound Appendix 2|Table of Suffixes]] at the Novial Wikibook.

==Novial compared to Esperanto and Ido==
{{See also|Comparison between Esperanto and Novial|Comparison between Ido and Novial}}

Jespersen was a professional linguist, unlike Esperanto's creator. He disliked the arbitrary and artificial character that he found in Esperanto and Ido.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} Additionally, he objected to those languages' [[inflection]]al systems, which he found needlessly complex. He sought to make Novial at once euphonious and regular while also preserving useful structures from natural languages.

In Novial:
* Syntax is largely a matter of word order, as in [[English language|English]] and modern [[Scandinavian language]]s. There is no obligatory [[Accusative case|accusative]] marker as in Esperanto, but the accusative may optionally be marked with either an accusative ending or an accusative preposition.
* A [[genitive]] or [[possessive case]] is available as an alternative to the preposition ''de''. This is based on Jespersen's observation that many modern languages have lost complex noun inflections, yet retain a possessive form.
* Auxiliary particles express most [[verb]] [[Grammatical tense|tenses]]. An inflectional ending is available as a shorthand for the simple [[past tense]].

A major difference between Novial and Esperanto/Ido concerns [[noun]] endings. Jespersen rejected a single vowel to terminate all nouns (-o in Esperanto/Ido), finding it unnatural and potentially confusing.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} Instead, Novial nouns may end in ''-o'', ''-a'', ''-e'', or ''-u'' or ''-um''. These endings may be taken to indicate natural sex according to the custom in Romance languages. Also there is no grammatical gender or requirement for [[adjective]]s to agree with nouns.

==Language sample for comparison==
Here is [[the Lord's Prayer]] in Novial and several related languages:

Amen.

==Criticism==
As Jespersen relates in his autobiography, in 1934 he proposed an orthographic reform to Novial, which displeased a part of the users. Jespersen abandoned the essential principle of ''one sound, one letter'' :&lt;ref&gt;Jespersen, Otto (1995 [1938]). ''A linguist’s life: an English translation of Otto Jerpersen’s autobiography'' [''En Sprogmands Levned''] ''with notes, photos and a bibliography''. Edited by Arne Juul, Hans F. Nielsen, Jørgen Erik Nielsen. Odense: Odense University Press. {{ISBN|87-7838-132-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|I proposed some not inconsiderable amendments, especially by introducing an "orthographic" Novial alongside the original phonetically written language. (...) Thus the sound [k], besides being represented by the letters ''k'' and ''q'' and the first part of ''x'', also acquired the new sign ''c'' (before ''a, o, u'' and consonants), a practice with which nearly all Europeans, Americans, and Australians are familiar from childhood. (...) I know that this orthographic form has displeased several of Novial's old and faithful friends, but it is my impression that many others have applauded it.|Otto Jespersen (1995 [1938], pp. 227–8)}}

Revue québécoise de linguistique théorique et appliquée 10:1.215–88.[http://www.nou-la.org/ling/1991a-class.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been strongly influenced by [[American Sign Language]] since the establishment in 1907 of the School for the Deaf and Blind (SDB) (now the Philippine School for the Deaf) by Delia Delight Rice (1883-1964), an [[American people|American]] [[Thomasite]] teacher born to deaf parents.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071115152643/http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2007/feb/25/yehey/weekend/20070225week1.html A century of absolute commitment] - The Manila Times Internet Edition (archived from [http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2007/feb/25/yehey/weekend/20070225week1.html the original] on 2007-02-25)&lt;/ref&gt; The school was run and managed by American principals until the 1940s. In the 1960s, contact with American Sign Language continued through the launching of the Deaf Evangelistic Alliance Foundation and the Laguna Christian College for the Deaf. Another source of ASL influence was the assignment of volunteers from the United States [[Peace Corps]], who were stationed at various places in the Philippines from 1974 through 1989, as well as religious organizations that promoted ASL and [[Manually Coded English]].&lt;ref name=Abat&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110728043151/http://web.kssp.upd.edu.ph/linguistics/plc2006/papers/FullPapers/V-3_Abat-Martinez.pdf_Abat-Martinez.pdf Abat, Rafaelito M., and Liza B.

Dennis Drake, established a series of residential elementary programs in [[Bohol]] using Philippine Sign Language as the primary language of instruction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ideadeaf.org/education/ Education], July 17, 2012, International Deaf Education Association, retrieved on August 25, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ideadeaf.org/the-founder-and-history/ The Founder And History], August 16, 2012, International Deaf Education Association, retrieved on August 25, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bohol Deaf Academy]] also primarily emphasizes Philippine Sign Language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://boholdeafacademy.ideadeaf.org/academics/ Academics], Bohol Deaf Academy, retrieved on August 25, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to sign language researcher Dr. Lisa Martinez, FSL and ASL deviate across three important metrics: different overall form (especially a differing [[handshape]] inventory), different methods of sign formation, and different grammar.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Status==
Usage of Filipino Sign Language was reported in 2009 as being used by 54% of sign-language users in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120325173851/http://carillon.up.edu.ph/?p=798 ''Calls made for a national language for the deaf''] - The Carillon (archived from [http://carillon.up.edu.ph/?p=798 the original] on 2012-03-25)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the [[Department of Education (Philippines)|Department of Education]] declared [[Signing Exact English]] the language of deaf education in the Philippines.&lt;ref name=HB450s2012&gt;[http://congress.gov.ph/download/basic_16/HB00450.pdf House Bill No. 450 : Explanatory Note], Congress of the Philippines, July 1, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Department of Education officials announced in a forum that hearing-impaired children were being taught and would continue to be taught using [[Signing Exact English]] (SEE) instead of Filipino Sign Language (FSL).&lt;ref&gt;[http://opinion.inquirer.net/12233/the-right-of-the-deaf-to-their-language The right of the deaf to their language], Philippine Daily Inquirer, September 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, House Bill No. 450 was introduced in the [[Philippine House of Representatives]] to declare FSL as the National Sign Language of the Philippines and to mandate its use as the medium of official communication in all transactions involving the deaf and the language of instruction of deaf education.&lt;ref name=HB450s2012 /&gt; {{as of|2014|5}}, that bill was pending with the Committee on Social Services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://congress.gov.ph/members/search.php?id=tinio-a&amp;pg=auth Hon. Tinio, Antonio L : HOUSE MEASURES SPONSORED/AUTHORED], Retrieved on 2014-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 30, 2018, Republic Act 11106 or The Filipino Sign Language Act was signed into law by President [[Rodrigo Duterte]]  declaring the Filipino Sign Language as the national sign language of the Filipino Deaf. The law also declares the country's national sign language as the official sign language of the government in all transactions involving the deaf.&lt;ref name=officialgazette&gt;[https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2018/10/30/republic-act-no-11106/ ''An  Act Declaring The Filipino Sign Language as the National Sign Language of the Filipino Deaf and the Official Sign Language of Government in All Transactions involving the Deaf, and Mandating its use in Schools, Broadcast Media and Workplaces''] - The Philippine Official Gazette&lt;/ref&gt;

The law, which seeks to eliminate all forms of discrimination against the Filipino Deaf, also mandates the use of the Filipino Sign Language in schools, broadcast media, and workplaces. It also mandates the '''Komisyon sa Wikang Filipino''', in consultation with the stakeholders, to establish a national system of standards and procedures for the interpretation of the Filipino Sign Language. The '''University of the Philippines''' and other education agencies are tasked to develop guidelines for the development of training materials in the education of the Deaf. The law also require the availability of qualified sign language interpreters in all hearings, proceedings, and government transactions involving the Deaf. &lt;ref&gt;[https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/11/12/18/duterte-signs-filipino-sign-language-into-law ''Duterte Signs Filipino Sign Language Into Law''] - ABS-CBN News&lt;/ref&gt;

“The FSL shall be recognized, promoted and supported as the medium of official communication in all transactions involving the deaf, and as the language of instruction of deaf education, without prejudice to the use of other forms of communications depending on individual choice or preference,” the law states.  The '''Department of Education (DepEd)''', '''Commission on Higher Education (CHEd)''', '''Technical Education, and Skills Development Authority (Tesda)''', and all other national and local government agencies involved in the education of the deaf, are tasked to use and coordinate with each other on the use of FSL as the medium of instruction in deaf education.&lt;ref&gt;[https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1052970/duterte-signs-filipino-sign-language-act ''Duterte Signs Filipino Sign Language Act''] - Inquirer News&lt;/ref&gt;

The law will become effective on November 27, 2018.&lt;ref name=officialgazette/&gt;

{{Expand list|date=December 2014}}

The term '''phoenix club''' is one used in professional team sports to refer to a new parent company that is set up to replace the parent company of a club that has failed in business terms but not in sporting terms, ideally while maintaining the continuity of the sporting activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/33470801|title=Phoenix from the flames: How do you resurrect a football club?|author=|date=10 July 2015|publisher=|accessdate=2 March 2017|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sport.stv.tv/football/clubs/rangers/277115-what-happens-when-a-club-in-administration-sets-up-a-phoenix-company/ | title=Administration: How a 'phoenix' club can play in Scottish football | publisher=Stv.tv | date=1 November 2011 | accessdate=8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some cases, the phoenix club is created by the supporters of the club which has ended (or appears to be on the point of ending).  A phoenix club will often have the same or similar name, logo and playing uniform to the original club. The term is particularly prevalent in the United Kingdom in relation to [[association football]], though it is also used in other countries.

The term is also occasionally used to refer to a club formed by disgruntled supporters of a major team when a change of ownership or policy causes them to lose faith in the management of their favoured side (as happened in 2005 when [[F.C. United of Manchester]] were formed by fans of [[Manchester United]] as a protest at the sale of the latter to [[Malcolm Glazer]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://supportersnotcustomers.com/2012/11/25/phoenix-football/ | title=Phoenix football&amp;nbsp;– the clubs that would not die | publisher=Supportersnotcustomers.com | date=25 November 2012 | accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; although their status as such may be disputed if the original club is still in existence at the time.

The term is taken from the mythical [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] bird, which is said to resurrect itself from its own ashes. In the Australia-New Zealand [[A-League]] the demise of the sole New Zealand team, [[New Zealand Knights FC|New Zealand Knights]], resulted in the newly created club actually calling itself the [[Wellington Phoenix FC|Phoenix]], albeit that the club moved to a different city, Wellington.

In some cases, phoenix clubs will retain the name of the club which they replaced, implying a continuation from the former team. In other cases, name changes occur, perhaps due to proprietorial ownership existing on the old club's name.  An American football example is the [[Cleveland Browns]], the original franchise of which moved to Baltimore in 1995 to become the [[Baltimore Ravens]]; the [[NFL]] however stipulated as part of the move the franchise would not be able to keep the team history and records of the Browns, a cornerstone NFL franchise.  In 1999, the "new" Browns were granted an expansion franchise and were awarded all of the former team's history by the league, even though the extant Ravens had the original Browns players and personnel.

It does not also include teams that relocated and/or have been renamed as a going concern, although many of the former may have their founding date as the day they have moved and still have strong links to their past, however they are considered to be the same club and therefore cannot be a phoenix (unless their previous entity officially folded and was liquidated).

However, the term ''phoenix club'' is one that could be disputed depending on the criteria used, as there is no single universally accepted definition. Furthermore, there may be changes in what each country's [[List of Football Associations by date of foundation|football governing body]] and legal system defines as a phoenix club and not a resurrected club.

'''Pragmatics''' is a subfield of [[linguistics]] and [[semiotics]] that studies the ways in which [[context (language use)|context]] contributes to meaning. Pragmatics encompasses [[speech act]] theory, conversational [[implicature]], [[Conversation analysis|talk in interaction]] and other approaches to language behavior in [[Philosophy of language|philosophy]], [[Sociology of language|sociology]], linguistics and [[anthropology]].&lt;ref name=Mey&gt;Mey, Jacob L. (1993) ''Pragmatics: An Introduction''. Oxford: Blackwell (2nd ed. 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[semantics]], which examines meaning that is conventional or "coded" in a given language, pragmatics studies how the transmission of meaning depends not only on structural and linguistic knowledge (e.g., [[grammar]], [[lexicon]], etc.) of the speaker and listener, but also on the context of the utterance,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linguisticsociety.org/resource/meaning-semantics-and-pragmatics|title=Meaning (Semantics and Pragmatics) {{!}} Linguistic Society of America|website=www.linguisticsociety.org|access-date=2017-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; any pre-existing knowledge about those involved, the inferred [[intention|intent]] of the speaker, and other factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;  In this respect, pragmatics explains how language users are able to overcome apparent [[ambiguity]], since meaning relies on the manner, place, time, etc. of an utterance.&lt;ref name=Mey/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/pragmatics-language-1691654|title=What Is Pragmatics?|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability to understand another speaker's intended meaning is called ''pragmatic competence''.&lt;ref&gt;Daejin Kim ''et al.'' (2002) "[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1540-4781.00153 The Role of an Interactive Book Reading Program in the Development of Second Language Pragmatic Competence]", ''The Modern Language Journal'', Vol. 86, No. 3 (Autumn, 2002), pp. 332-348&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Masahiro Takimoto (2008) "The Effects of Deductive and Inductive Instruction on the Development of Language Learners' Pragmatic Competence", ''The Modern Language Journal'', Vol. 92, No. 3 (Fall, 2008), pp. 369-386&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dale April Koike (1989) "[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-4781.1989.tb06364.x Pragmatic Competence and Adult L2 Acquisition: Speech Acts in Interlanguage]", ''The Modern Language Journal'', Vol. 73, No. 3 (Autumn, 1989), pp. 279-289&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ambiguity==
{{main article|Ambiguity}}
The sentence "You have a green light" is ambiguous. Without knowing the context, the identity of the speaker or the speaker's intent, it is difficult to infer the meaning with certainty. For example, it could mean:
* the space that belongs to you has green ambient lighting;
* you are driving through a green traffic signal;
* you no longer have to wait to continue driving;
* you are permitted to proceed in a non-driving context;
* your body is cast in a greenish glow; or
* you possess a light bulb that is tinted green.
Similarly, the sentence "Sherlock saw the man with binoculars" could mean that Sherlock observed the man by using binoculars, or it could mean that Sherlock observed a man who was holding binoculars (''[[syntactic ambiguity]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Linguistics-and-Philosophy/24-903Spring-2005/CourseHome/| title= 24.903 / 24.933 Language and its Structure III: Semantics and Pragmatics | website= MIT.edu| publisher= MIT [[OpenCourseWare]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]| date= 2004| access-date= October 17, 2017|deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100409033734/http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Linguistics-and-Philosophy/24-903Spring-2005/CourseHome/| archivedate= April 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning of the sentence depends on an understanding of the context and the speaker's intent. As defined in linguistics, a sentence is an abstract entity—a string of words divorced from non-linguistic context—as opposed to an [[utterance]], which is a concrete example of a [[speech act]] in a specific context. The more closely conscious subjects stick to common words, idioms, phrasings, and topics, the more easily others can surmise their meaning; the further they stray from common expressions and topics, the wider the variations in interpretations. This suggests that sentences do not have intrinsic meaning, that there is no meaning associated with a sentence or word, and that either can only represent an idea symbolically. ''The cat sat on the mat'' is a sentence in English. If someone were to say to someone else, "The cat sat on the mat," the act is itself an utterance. This implies that a sentence, term, expression or word cannot symbolically represent a single true meaning; such meaning is underspecified (which cat sat on which mat?) and potentially ambiguous. By contrast, the meaning of an utterance can be inferred through knowledge of both its linguistic and non-linguistic contexts (which may or may not be sufficient to resolve ambiguity). In mathematics, with [[Berry's paradox]], there arises a similar systematic ambiguity with the word "definable".

==Etymology==
The word ''pragmatics'' derives via [[Latin]] ''pragmaticus'' from the [[Greek language|Greek]] πραγματικός (''pragmatikos''), meaning amongst others "fit for action",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpragmatiko%2Fs πραγματικός], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;  which comes from πρᾶγμα (''pragma''), "deed, act",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpra%3Dgma πρᾶγμα], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and that from πράσσω (''prassō''), "to pass over, to practise, to achieve".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpra%2Fssw πράσσω], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the field==
{{Ref improve section|date=April 2018}}
Pragmatics was a reaction to [[Structuralism|structuralist]] linguistics as outlined by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]. In many cases, it expanded upon his idea that language has an analyzable structure, composed of parts that can be defined in relation to others. Pragmatics first engaged only in [[Course in General Linguistics#Synchronic and diachronic axes|synchronic]] study, as opposed to examining the historical development of language. However, it rejected the notion that all meaning comes from [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]] existing purely in the abstract space of ''langue''. Meanwhile, [[historical pragmatics]] has also come into being. This field only gained linguists' attention in the 70s. This is when two different schools emerged; notably the Anglo-American pragmatic thought and the European continental pragmatic thought (also called the perspective view).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zora.uzh.ch/57900/1/Jucker_Pragmatics_in_the_history_of_linguistic_thought.pdf|title=Pragmatics in the history of linguistic thought|last=Jucker|first=Andreas H|date=2012|website=www.zora.uzh.ch|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170923010723/http://www.zora.uzh.ch/57900/1/Jucker_Pragmatics_in_the_history_of_linguistic_thought.pdf|archive-date=2017-09-23|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas of interest==
{{Ref improve section|date=April 2018}}
* The study of the speaker's meaning,  not focusing on the phonetic or grammatical form of an utterance, but instead on what the speaker's intentions and beliefs are.
* The study of the meaning in context, and the influence that a given context can have on the message. It requires knowledge of the speaker's identities, and the place and time of the utterance.
* The study of [[implicature]]s, i.e. the things that are communicated even though they are not explicitly expressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-pragmatics-definition-examples.html|title=What is Pragmatics? - Definition &amp; Examples - Video &amp; Lesson Transcript {{!}} Study.com|website=study.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The study of relative distance, both social and physical, between speakers in order to understand what determines the choice of what is said and what is not said.
* The study of what is not meant, as opposed to the intended meaning, i.e. that which is unsaid and unintended, or unintentional.
* [[Information structure]], the study of how utterances are marked in order to efficiently manage the common ground of referred entities between speaker and hearer
* [[Formal Pragmatics]], the study of those aspects of meaning and use for which context of use is an important factor, by using the methods and goals of formal semantics.

==Referential uses of language==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2009}}
When we speak of the referential uses of language we are talking about how we use [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]] to refer to certain items. Below is an explanation of, first, what a sign is, second, how meanings are accomplished through its usage.

A sign is the link or relationship between a [[Sign (semiotics)|signified and the signifier]] as defined by Saussure and Huguenin. The signified is some entity or concept in the world. The signifier represents the signified. An example would be:

:''Signified: the concept cat
:''Signifier: the word "cat"

The relationship between the two gives the sign meaning. This relationship can be further explained by considering what we mean by "meaning." In pragmatics, there are two different types of meaning to consider: '''semantico-referential meaning''' and '''indexical meaning.''' Semantico-referential meaning refers to the aspect of meaning, which describes events in the world that are independent of the circumstance they are uttered in. An example would be propositions such as:

:''"Santa Claus eats cookies."''

In this case, the proposition is describing that Santa Claus eats cookies. The meaning of this proposition does not rely on whether or not Santa Claus is eating cookies at the time of its utterance. Santa Claus could be eating cookies at any time and the meaning of the proposition would remain the same. The meaning is simply describing something that is the case in the world. In contrast, the proposition, "Santa Claus is eating a cookie right now," describes events that are happening at the time the proposition is uttered.

Semantico-referential meaning is also present in meta-semantical statements such as:

:''Tiger: carnivorous, a mammal''

If someone were to say that a tiger is a carnivorous animal in one context and a mammal in another, the definition of tiger would still be the same. The meaning of the sign tiger is describing some animal in the world, which does not change in either circumstance.

[[Indexical]] meaning, on the other hand, is dependent on the context of the utterance and has rules of use. By rules of use, it is meant that indexicals can tell you when they are used, but not what they actually mean.

:''Example'': "I"

Whom "I" refers to depends on the context and the person uttering it.

As mentioned, these meanings are brought about through the relationship between the signified and the signifier. One way to define the relationship is by placing signs in two categories: '''referential indexical signs,''' also called "shifters," and '''pure indexical signs.'''

Referential indexical signs are signs where the meaning shifts depending on the context hence the nickname "shifters." 'I' would be considered a referential indexical sign. The referential aspect of its meaning would be '1st person singular' while the indexical aspect would be the person who is speaking (refer above for definitions of semantico-referential and indexical meaning). Another example would be:

:''"This"''
:''Referential: singular count''
:''Indexical: Close by''

A pure indexical sign does not contribute to the meaning of the propositions at all. It is an example of a "non-referential use of language."

A second way to define the signified and signifier relationship is [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C.S. Peirce]]'s '''Peircean Trichotomy'''. The components of the trichotomy are the following:

:1. '''Icon''': the signified resembles the signifier (signified: a dog's barking noise, signifier: bow-wow)
:2. '''Index''': the signified and signifier are linked by proximity or the signifier has meaning only because it is pointing to the signified
:3. '''Symbol''': the signified and signifier are arbitrarily linked (signified: a cat, signifier: the word cat)

These relationships allow us to use signs to convey what we want to say. If two people were in a room and one of them wanted to refer to a characteristic of a chair in the room he would say "this chair has four legs" instead of "a chair has four legs." The former relies on context (indexical and referential meaning) by referring to a chair specifically in the room at that moment while the latter is independent of the context (semantico-referential meaning), meaning the concept chair.

==Non-referential uses of language==

===Silverstein's "pure" indexes===

[[Michael Silverstein]] has argued that "nonreferential" or "pure" indices do not contribute to an utterance's referential meaning but instead "signal some particular value of one or more contextual variables."&lt;ref&gt;Silverstein 1976&lt;/ref&gt; Although nonreferential indexes are devoid of semantico-referential meaning, they do encode "pragmatic" meaning.

The sorts of contexts that such indexes can mark are varied. Examples include:
* '''Sex indexes''' are affixes or inflections that index the sex of the speaker, e.g. the verb forms of female [[Koasati language|Koasati]] speakers take the suffix "-s".
*  '''Deference indexes''' are words that signal social differences (usually related to status or age) between the speaker and the addressee. The most common example of a deference index is the V form in a language with a [[T-V distinction]], the widespread phenomenon in which there are multiple second-person pronouns that correspond to the addressee's relative status or familiarity to the speaker. [[Honorific]]s are another common form of deference index and demonstrate the speaker's respect or esteem for the addressee via special forms of address and/or self-humbling first-person pronouns.
* An '''Affinal taboo index''' is an example of [[avoidance speech]] that produces and reinforces sociological distance, as seen in the Aboriginal [[Dyirbal language]] of Australia. In this language and some others, there is a social taboo against the use of the everyday lexicon in the presence of certain relatives (mother-in-law, child-in-law, paternal aunt's child, and maternal uncle's child). If any of those relatives are present, a Dyirbal speaker has to switch to a completely separate lexicon reserved for that purpose.

In all of these cases, the semantico-referential meaning of the utterances is unchanged from that of the other possible (but often impermissible) forms, but the pragmatic meaning is vastly different.

===The performative===
{{main article|Performative utterance|Speech act theory}}

[[J.L. Austin]] introduced the concept of the [[Performative utterance|performative]], contrasted in his writing with "constative" (i.e. descriptive) utterances. According to Austin's original formulation, a performative is a type of utterance characterized by two distinctive features:

* It is not [[logical value|truth-evaluable]] (i.e. it is neither true nor false)
* Its uttering ''performs'' an action rather than simply describing one

Examples:
* "I hereby pronounce you man and wife."
* "I accept your apology."
* "This meeting is now adjourned."

To be performative, an utterance must conform to various conditions involving what Austin calls [[felicity conditions|felicity]]. These deal with things like appropriate context and the speaker's authority. For instance, when a couple has been arguing and the husband says to his wife that he accepts her apology even though she has offered nothing approaching an apology, his assertion is infelicitous—because she has made neither expression of regret nor request for forgiveness, there exists none to accept, and thus no act of accepting can possibly happen.

===Jakobson's six functions of language===
{{main article|Jakobson's functions of language}}
[[File:Roma jakobson theory.png|right|thumb|The six factors of an effective verbal communication. To each one corresponds a communication function (not displayed in this picture).&lt;ref name="Middleton"&gt;Middleton, Richard (1990/2002). ''Studying Popular Music'', p. 241. Philadelphia: Open University Press. {{ISBN|0-335-15275-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Roman Jakobson]], expanding on the work of [[Karl Bühler]], described six "constitutive factors" of a [[speech act|speech event]], each of which represents the privileging of a corresponding function, and only one of which is the referential (which corresponds to the '''context''' of the speech event). The six constitutive factors and their corresponding functions are diagrammed below.

'''The six constitutive factors of a speech event'''

:::Context
:::Message
Addresser---------------------Addressee
:::Contact
:::Code
&lt;br /&gt;
'''The six functions of language'''

:::Referential
:::Poetic
Emotive-----------------------Conative
:::Phatic
:::Metalingual

* The Referential Function corresponds to the factor of Context and describes a situation, object or mental state. The descriptive statements of the referential function can consist of both definite descriptions and [[deixis|deictic]] words, e.g. "The autumn leaves have all fallen now."
* The Expressive (alternatively called "emotive" or "affective") Function relates to the Addresser and is best exemplified by [[interjections]] and other sound changes that do not alter the [[denotation|denotative meaning]] of an utterance but do add information about the Addresser's (speaker's) internal state, e.g. "Wow, what a view!"
* The Conative Function engages the Addressee directly and is best illustrated by [[vocative]]s and [[imperative mood|imperatives]], e.g. "Tom! Come inside and eat!"
* The Poetic Function focuses on "the message for its own sake"&lt;ref name="Duranti 1997"&gt;Duranti 1997&lt;/ref&gt; and is the operative function in poetry as well as slogans.
* The [[Phatic]] Function is language for the sake of interaction and is therefore associated with the Contact factor. The Phatic Function can be observed in greetings and casual discussions of the weather, particularly with strangers.
* The Metalingual (alternatively called "metalinguistic" or "reflexive") Function is the use of language (what Jakobson calls "Code") to discuss or describe itself.

==Related fields==
There is considerable overlap between pragmatics and [[sociolinguistics]], since both share an interest in [[linguistic meaning]] as determined by usage in a speech community. However, sociolinguists tend to be more interested in variations in language within such communities.

Pragmatics helps anthropologists relate elements of language to broader social phenomena; it thus pervades the field of [[linguistic anthropology]]. Because pragmatics describes generally the forces in play for a given utterance, it includes the study of power, gender, race, identity, and their interactions with individual speech acts. For example, the study of [[Code-switching|code switching]] directly relates to pragmatics, since a switch in code effects a shift in pragmatic force.&lt;ref name="Duranti 1997"/&gt;

According to [[Charles W. Morris]], pragmatics tries to understand the relationship between signs and their users, while [[semantics]] tends to focus on the actual objects or ideas to which a word refers, and [[syntax]] (or "syntactics") examines relationships among signs or symbols. Semantics is the literal meaning of an idea whereas pragmatics is the implied meaning of the given idea.

[[Speech act|Speech Act Theory]], pioneered by [[J.L. Austin]] and further developed by [[John Searle]], centers around the idea of the [[performative]], a type of utterance that performs the very action it describes. Speech Act Theory's examination of [[Illocutionary act|Illocutionary Acts]] has many of the same goals as pragmatics, as outlined [[Pragmatics#Areas of interest|above]].

Computational Pragmatics, as defined by [[Victoria Fromkin]], concerns how humans can communicate their intentions to computers with as little ambiguity as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Language|last=Fromkin|first=Victoria|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|year=2014|isbn=1133310680|location=Boston, Ma.|pages=508}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process, integral to the science of [[natural language processing]] (seen as a sub-discipline of [[artificial intelligence]]), involves providing a computer system with some database of knowledge related to a topic and a series of algorithms which control how the system responds to incoming data, using contextual knowledge to more accurately approximate natural human language and information processing abilities. Reference resolution, how a computer determines when two objects are different or not, is one of the most important tasks of computational pragmatics. 

==Formalization==

There has been a great amount of discussion on the boundary between semantics and pragmatics &lt;ref&gt;[http://web.stanford.edu/group/cslipublications/cslipublications/site/9781575866673.shtml see for instance F.Domaneschi. C. Penco, What is Said and What is Not, CSLI Publication, Stanford]&lt;/ref&gt; and there are many different formalizations of aspects of pragmatics linked to context dependence. Particularly interesting cases are the discussions on the semantics of indexicals and the problem of referential descriptions, a topic developed after the theories of [[Keith Donnellan]].&lt;ref&gt;see for instance S. Neale, Descriptions, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; A proper logical theory of formal pragmatics has been developed by [[Carlo Dalla Pozza]], according to which it is possible to connect classical semantics (treating propositional contents as true or false) and intuitionistic semantics (dealing with illocutionary forces). The presentation of a formal treatment of pragmatics appears to be a development of the Fregean idea of assertion sign as formal sign of the act of assertion.

==In literary theory==

Pragmatics (more specifically, [[Speech act|Speech Act Theory's]] notion of the [[performative]]) underpins [[Judith Butler]]'s theory of [[gender performativity]]. In ''[[Gender Trouble]]'', she claims that gender and sex are not natural categories, but socially constructed roles produced by "reiterative acting."

In [[Judith Butler#Excitable Speech: A Politics of the Performative|''Excitable Speech'']] she extends her theory of [[performativity]] to [[hate speech]] and [[censorship]], arguing that censorship necessarily strengthens any discourse it tries to suppress and therefore, since the state has sole power to define hate speech legally, it is the state that makes hate speech performative.

[[Jacques Derrida]] remarked that some work done under Pragmatics aligned well with the program he outlined in his book ''[[Of Grammatology]]''.

[[Émile Benveniste]] argued that the [[pronouns]] "I" and "you" are fundamentally distinct from other pronouns because of their role in creating the [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]].

[[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]] discuss linguistic pragmatics in the fourth chapter of ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'' ("November 20, 1923--Postulates of Linguistics"). They draw three conclusions from Austin: (1) A [[performative utterance]] does not communicate information about an act second-hand—it is the act; (2) Every aspect of language ("semantics, syntactics, or even phonematics") functionally interacts with pragmatics; (3) There is no distinction between language and speech. This last conclusion attempts to refute [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure's]] division between [[langue and parole|''langue'' and ''parole'']] and [[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky's]] distinction between [[surface structure]] and [[deep structure]] simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gilles Deleuze|Deleuze, Gilles]] and [[Félix Guattari]] (1987) [1980].

'''Propitiation''', also called '''expiation''', is the act of appeasing or making well-disposed a deity, thus incurring divine favor or avoiding divine retribution.&lt;ref&gt;http://englishdictionary.education/en/propitiation&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian theology==

In [[Romans 3:25]] the NASB translates "propitiation" from the Greek word ''hilasterion''.  Concretely it specifically means the lid of The Ark of The Covenant.&lt;ref&gt;Strong's Greek Dictionary G2435&lt;/ref&gt;  The only other occurrence of ''hilasterion'' in the NT is in [[Hebrews 9:5]], where the NASB translates it as "[[mercy seat]]".

For many Christians it has the meaning of "that which expiates or propitiates" or "the gift which procures propitiation". {{bibleref2|1 John|2:2}} (KJV) reads: "And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world." There is frequent similar use of ''hilasterion'' in the [[Septuagint]], {{bibleref2|Exodus|25:17-22}} ff. The mercy seat was sprinkled with blood on Yom Kippur ({{bibleref2|Leviticus|16:14}}), representing that the righteous sentence of the Law had been executed, changing a judgment seat into a mercy seat ({{bibleref2|Hebrews|9:11–15}}; compare with "throne of grace" in {{bibleref2|Hebrews|4:14–16}}; place of communion, ({{bibleref2|Exodus|25:21–22}}).

Another Greek word, ''hilasmos'', is used for Christ as our propitiation in 1 John 2:2; 4:10; and in the Septuagint ({{bibleref2|Leviticus|25:9}}; {{bibleref2|Numbers|5:8}}; {{bibleref2|Amos|8:14}}). The thought in the OT sacrifices and in the NT fulfillment, is that Christ completely satisfied the just demands of the Holy Father for judgment on sin, by his death at Calvary ({{bibleref2|Hebrews|7:26-28}}). ''TDNT,'' however, takes a different view of ''Hebrews: "''If the author uses the ritual as a means to portray Christ’s work, he also finds that in the new covenant the literal offerings of the ritual are replaced by the obedience of Christ (10:5ff.; cf. Ps. 40) and the Christian ministry of praise and mutual service (13:15-16; cf. Ps. 50). In other words, total self-giving, first that of Christ, and then, on this basis, that of his people, is the true meaning of sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;“Sacrifice” (Gk: ''hilasterion)'' article in ''Theological Dictionary of the New Testament,'' Grand Rapids, MI:  Eerdmans (1984) {{ISBN|0802823246}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

God, in view of the cross, is declared righteous in having been able to justify sins in the OT period, as well as in being able to forgive sinners under the New Covenant ({{bibleref2|Romans|3:25,26}}; cf. {{bibleref2|Exodus|29:33}}, note).
&lt;ref&gt;NOT OR, it's a paraphase of the text referenced: Romans 3:25-26 (NASB) "whom God displayed publicly as a propitiation in His blood through faith. This was to demonstrate His righteousness, because in the forbearance of God He passed over the sins previously committed; for the demonstration, I say, of His righteousness at the present time, so that He would be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus." ~ Exodus 29:33 (NASB) "Thus they shall eat those things by which atonement was made at their ordination and consecration; but a layman shall not eat them, because they are holy."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Propitiation and expiation==

The case for translating ''hilasterion'' as "expiation" instead of "propitiation" was put forward by C. H. Dodd in 1935 and at first gained wide support. ''Hilasterion'' is translated as "expiation" in the New American Bible (Revised Edition) and as "sacrifice of atonement" in the New Revised Standard Version. Dodd argued that in pagan Greek the translation of ''hilasterion'' was indeed to propitiate, but that in the Septuagint (the oldest Greek translation of the Hebrew OT) that ''kapporeth'' (Hebrew for "covering")&lt;ref&gt;Easton's Bible Dictionary, p.965&lt;/ref&gt; is often translated with words that mean "to cleanse or remove".&lt;ref&gt;Dodd, The Bible and the Greeks, p.93&lt;/ref&gt; This view was challenged by Leon Morris who argued that because of the focus in the book of Romans on God's wrath, that the concept of ''hilasterion'' needed to include the appeasement of God's wrath.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Apostolic Preaching of the Cross, p.155&lt;/ref&gt; Dodd's study is also criticized by David Hill in his semantic study of ''hilasterion'', in the book ''Greek Words and Hebrew Meanings: Studies in the Semantics of Soteriological Terms''{{Citation needed|reason=Please provide the book's proper literary citation, as is done with Morrison's book just before that. THX!|date=August 2018}}. Hill claims that Dodd leaves out several Septuagint references to propitiation, and also cites apocryphal sources.

Theologians stress the idea of propitiation because it specifically addresses dealing with God's wrath. Critics of penal substitutionary atonement state that seeing the Atonement as appeasing God is a pagan idea that makes God seem tyrannical.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, ''Stricken by God?'', ed. Brad Jersak, Eerdmans: 2007 or ''Be Ye Reconciled'' by Paul Peter Waldenstrom.&lt;/ref&gt;

J.I. Packer in "Knowing God" designates a distinct difference between pagan and Christian propitiation: "In paganism, man propitiates his gods, and religion becomes a form of commercialism and, indeed, of bribery. In Christianity, however, God propitiates his wrath by his own action. He set forth Jesus Christ... to be the propitiation of our sins."&lt;ref&gt;J.I. Packer, Knowing God, p.207&lt;/ref&gt;

John Stott writes that propitiation "does not make God gracious...God does not love us because Christ died for us, Christ died for us because God loves us".&lt;ref&gt;The Cross of Christ, p.174&lt;/ref&gt; John Calvin, quoting Augustine from ''John's Gospel'' cx.6, writes, "Our being reconciled by the death of Christ must not be understood as if the Son reconciled us, in order that the Father, then hating, might begin to love us".&lt;ref&gt;John Calvin, Institutes, Book 2:16:4&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing the quote: "... but that we were reconciled to him already, loving, though at enmity with us because of sin. To the truth of both propositions we have the attestation of the Apostle, 'God commendeth his love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us,' (Rom. 5: 8.) Therefore he had this love towards us even when, exercising enmity towards him, we were the workers of iniquity. Accordingly in a manner wondrous and divine, he loved even when he hated us." &lt;ref&gt;John Calvin, Institutes, Book 2:16:4&lt;/ref&gt;

Packer also cites God's love as the impetus that provides Christ's sacrifice for the reconciliation of mankind and hence the removal of God's wrath.&lt;ref&gt;J.I. Packer, Knowing God, p.208; John Murrey, The Atonement, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; According to Packer, propitiation (and the wrath of God that propitiation implies) is necessary to properly define God's love; God could not be righteous and "His love would degenerate into sentimentality (without Christ's death containing aspects of propitiation).The wrath of God is as personal, and as potent, as his Love."&lt;ref&gt;J.I. Packer, Knowing God, p.206&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus the definition of Christian propitiation asserted by Calvin, Packer and Murray holds that within God there is a dichotomy of love and anger, but through propitiation love trumps anger, abolishing it. "'The doctrine of the propitiation is precisely this that God loved the objects of His wrath so much that He gave His own Son to the end that He by His blood should make provision for the removal of this wrath... (John Murray, The Atonement, p.15)'"&lt;ref&gt;J.I. Packer, Knowing God, p.208 (Packer here quoting John Murray)&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''New Jerome Biblical Commentary'' consistently argues that in the NT sacrifice (''hilasterion'') does not appease God’s wrath but is best expressed from its Jewish roots (76.89-95) as atonement or expiation (82.73).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=New Jerome Biblical Commentary|last=Brown|first=Raymond E.|publisher=Pearson|year=1990|isbn=0136149340|location=|pages=1399|chapter=Pauline Theology, 82, #73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] studies have depended heavily on the [[Trinity|Trinitarian]] perspective presented by Edward J. Kilmartin:
&lt;blockquote&gt;  Sacrifice is not, in the first place, an activity of human beings directed to God and, in the second place, something that reaches its goal in the response of divine acceptance and bestowal of divine blessing on the cultic community. Rather, sacrifice in the New Testament understanding – and thus in its Christian understanding – is, in the first place, the self-offering of the Father in the gift of his Son, and in the second place the unique response of the Son in his humanity to the Father, and in the third place, the self-offering of believers in union with Christ by which they share in his covenant relationship with the Father.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Eucharist in the West, History and Theology|last=Kilmartin|first=Edward J.|publisher=Liturgical Press, 1999|year=1999|isbn=0814661726|location=Collegeville, MN|pages=381f.}} See also Robert Daly, “Sacrifice Unveiled or Sacrifice Revisited”.

[[File:Grand Turk(28).jpg|thumb|250px|An early naval cannon, which is allowed to roll backwards slightly when fired, and therefore must be tethered with strong ropes.]]

'''Recoil''' (often called '''knockback''', '''kickback''' or simply '''kick''') is the backward movement of a [[gun]] when it is discharged. In technical terms, the recoil [[momentum]] acquired by the gun exactly balances the forward momentum of the projectile and exhaust gases (ejecta), according to [[Newton's third law]], known as [[conservation of momentum]]. In hand-held [[small arms]], the recoil momentum is transferred to the ground through the body of the shooter; while in heavier guns such as mounted [[machine gun]]s or [[cannon]]s, recoil momentum is transferred to the ground through the [[Weapon mount|mount]]. 

In order to bring the rearward moving gun to a halt, the momentum acquired by the gun is dissipated by a forward acting counter-recoil force applied to the gun over a period of time after the projectile exits the muzzle. To apply this counter-recoiling force, modern mounted guns may employ recoil buffering comprising springs and [[hydraulic recoil mechanism]]s, similar to shock absorbing suspension on automobiles.  Early cannons used systems of ropes along with rolling or sliding friction to provide forces to slow the recoiling cannon to a stop.  Recoil buffering allows the maximum counter-recoil force to be lowered so that strength limitations of the gun mount are not exceeded.  Gun chamber pressures and projectile acceleration forces are tremendous, on the order of tens of thousands of pounds per square inch and tens of thousands of times the acceleration of gravity ([[g's]]), both necessary to launch the projectile at useful velocity during the very short travel distance of the barrel.  However, the same pressures acting on the base of the projectile are acting on the rear face of the gun chamber, accelerating the gun rearward during firing.  Practical weight gun mounts are typically not strong enough to withstand the maximum forces accelerating the projectile during the short time the projectile is in the barrel, typically only a few milliseconds.  To mitigate these large recoil forces, recoil buffering mechanisms spread out the counter-recoiling force over a longer time, typically ten to a hundred times longer than the duration of the forces accelerating the projectile.  This results in the required counter-recoiling force being proportionally lower, and easily absorbed by the gun mount.  Modern cannons also employ [[muzzle brake]]s very effectively to redirect some of the propellant gasses rearward after projectile exit.  This provides a counter-recoiling force to the barrel, allowing the buffering system and gun mount to be more efficiently designed at even lower weight. "Recoilless" guns, ([[recoilless rifle]]), also exist where much of the high pressure gas remaining in the barrel after projectile exit is vented rearward though a nozzle at the back of the chamber, creating a large counter-recoiling force sufficient to eliminate the need for heavy recoil mitigating buffers on the mount.  

The same physics affecting recoil in mounted guns and cannons applies to hand-held guns.  However, the shooter's body assumes the role of gun mount, and must similarly dissipate the gun's recoiling momentum over a longer period of time than the bullet travel-time in the barrel, in order not to injure the shooter.  Hands, arms and shoulders have considerable strength and elasticity for this purpose, up to certain practical limits.  Nevertheless, "perceived" recoil limits vary from shooter to shooter, depending on body size, the use of [[recoil pad]]ding, individual pain tolerance, the weight of the firearm, and whether recoil buffering systems and muzzle brakes are employed.  For this reason, establishing recoil safety standards for small arms remains challenging, in spite of the straight-forward physics involved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a277862.pdf A Limited Performance Tradeoff Analysis of a Novel Closed-Breech, Shoulder-Fired Weapon System, 1992; Appendix: Recoil in Shoulder-Fired Weapons: A Review of the Literature, Robert J. Spine, US Army Human Engineering Laboratory, 1982]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recoil: momentum, energy and impulse ==

=== Momentum ===
A change in momentum of a [[mass]] requires a [[force]]; according to [[Newton's first law]], known as the law of [[inertia]], inertia simply being another term for mass. That force, applied to a mass, creates an [[acceleration]], which when applied over time, changes the velocity of a mass.  According to [[Newton's second law]], the law of momentum -- changing the velocity of the mass changes its momentum, (mass multiplied by velocity). It is important to understand at this point that velocity is not simply speed.  Velocity is the speed of a mass in a particular direction.  In a very technical sense, speed is a [[scalar (mathematics)]], a magnitude, and velocity is a [[vector (physics)]], magnitude and direction.  [[Newton's third law]], known as conservation of momentum, recognizes that changes in the motion of a mass, brought about by the application of forces and accelerations, does not occur in isolation; that is, other bodies of mass are found to be involved in directing those forces and accelerations.  Furthermore, if all the masses and velocities involved are accounted for, the vector sum, magnitude and direction, of the momentum of all the bodies involved does not change; hence, momentum of the system is conserved.  This conservation of momentum is why gun recoil occurs in the opposite direction of bullet projection -- the mass times velocity of the projectile in the positive direction equals the mass times velocity of the gun in the negative direction.  In summation, the total momentum of the system equals zero, surprisingly just as it did before the trigger was pulled. From a practical engineering perspective, therefore, through the mathematical application of conservation of momentum, it is possible to calculate a first approximation of a gun’s recoil momentum and [[kinetic energy]], and properly design recoil buffering systems to safely dissipate that momentum and energy, simply based on estimates of the projectile speed (and mass) coming out the barrel. To confirm analytical calculations and estimates, once a prototype gun is manufactured, the projectile and gun recoil energy and momentum can be directly measured using a [[ballistic pendulum]] and ballistic [[Gun chronograph|chronograph]].

There are two conservation laws at work when a gun is fired: [[conservation of momentum]] and [[conservation of energy]]. Recoil is explained by the law of conservation of momentum, and so it is easier to discuss it separately from [[energy]].

The nature of the recoil process is determined by the force of the expanding gases in the barrel upon the gun (recoil force), which is equal and opposite to the force upon the ejecta. It is also determined by the counter-recoil force applied to the gun (e.g. an operator's hand or shoulder, or a mount). The recoil force only acts during the time that the ejecta are still in the barrel of the gun. The counter-recoil force is generally applied over a longer time period and adds forward momentum to the gun equal to the backward momentum supplied by the recoil force, in order to bring the gun to a halt. There are two special cases of counter recoil force: [[Free recoil|Free-recoil]], in which the time duration of the counter-recoil force is very much larger than the duration of the recoil force, and zero-recoil, in which the counter-recoil force matches the recoil force in magnitude and duration. Except for the case of zero-recoil, the counter-recoil force is smaller than the recoil force but lasts for a longer time. Since the recoil force and the counter-recoil force are not matched, the gun will move rearward, slowing down until it comes to rest. In the zero-recoil case, the two forces are matched and the gun will not move when fired. In most cases, a gun is very close to a free-recoil condition, since the recoil process generally lasts much longer than the time needed to move the ejecta down the barrel. An example of near zero-recoil would be a gun securely clamped to a massive or well-anchored table, or supported from behind by a massive wall.  However, employing zero-recoil systems is often neither practical nor safe for the structure of the gun, as the recoil momentum must be absorbed directly through the very small distance of [[elastic deformation]] of the materials the gun and mount are made from, perhaps exceeding their strength limits.  For example, placing the butt of a large caliber gun directly against a wall and pulling the trigger risks cracking both the gun stock and the surface of the wall.   

The recoil of a firearm, whether large or small, is a result of the law of conservation of momentum. Assuming that the firearm and projectile are both at rest before firing, then their total momentum is zero. Assuming a near free-recoil condition, and neglecting the gases ejected from the barrel, (an acceptable first estimate), then immediately after firing, conservation of momentum requires that the total momentum of the firearm and projectile is the same as before, namely zero. Stating this mathematically:
:&lt;math&gt;p_f + p_p = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;p_f\,&lt;/math&gt; is the momentum of the firearm and &lt;math&gt;p_p\,&lt;/math&gt; is the momentum of the projectile. In other words, immediately after firing, the momentum of the firearm is equal and opposite to the momentum of the projectile.

Since momentum of a body is defined as its mass multiplied by its velocity, we can rewrite the above equation as:
:&lt;math&gt;m_f v_f + m_p v_p = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;
where:
:&lt;math&gt;m_f\,&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the firearm
:&lt;math&gt;v_f\,&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the firearm immediately after firing
:&lt;math&gt;m_p\,&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the projectile
:&lt;math&gt;v_p\,&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the projectile immediately after firing

A force integrated over the time period during which it acts will yield the momentum supplied by that force. The counter-recoil force must supply enough momentum to the firearm to bring it to a halt. This means that:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^{t_{cr}}F_{cr}(t)\,dt=-m_f v_f=m_p v_p&lt;/math&gt;

where:
:&lt;math&gt;F_{cr}(t)\,&lt;/math&gt; is the counter-recoil force as a function of time (''t'')
:&lt;math&gt;t_{cr}\,&lt;/math&gt; is duration of the counter-recoil force

A similar equation can be written for the recoil force on the firearm:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^{t_r}F_r(t)\,dt=m_f v_f=-m_p v_p&lt;/math&gt;

where:
:&lt;math&gt;F_r(t)\,&lt;/math&gt; is the recoil force as a function of time (''t'')
:&lt;math&gt;t_r\,&lt;/math&gt; is duration of the recoil force

Assuming the forces are somewhat evenly spread out over their respective durations, the condition for free-recoil is &lt;math&gt;t_r \ll t_{cr}&lt;/math&gt;, while for zero-recoil, &lt;math&gt;F_r(t)+F_{cr}(t)=0&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Angular momentum ===

For a gun firing under free-recoil conditions, the force on the gun may not only force the gun backwards, but may also cause it to rotate about its center of mass or recoil mount. This is particularly true of older firearms, such as the classic [[Kentucky rifle]], where the butt stock angles down significantly lower than the barrel, providing a pivot point about which the muzzle may rise during recoil.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}  Modern firearms, such as the [[M16 rifle]], employ stock designs that are in direct line with the barrel, in order to minimize any rotational effects.  If there is an angle for the recoil parts to rotate about, the torque (&lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;) on the gun is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; \tau=I \frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2}=h F(t)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the perpendicular distance of the center of mass of the gun below the barrel axis, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;F(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the force on the gun due to the expanding gases, equal and opposite to the force on the bullet, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the moment of inertia of the gun about its center of mass, or its pivot point, and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angle of rotation of the barrel axis "up" from its orientation at ignition (aim angle). The angular momentum of the gun is found by integrating this equation to obtain:

:&lt;math&gt;I \frac{d\theta}{dt}=h\int_0^t F(t)\,dt = h m_g V_g(t)=h m_b V_b(t)&lt;/math&gt;

where the equality of the momenta of the gun and bullet have been used. The angular rotation of the gun as the bullet exits the barrel is then found by integrating again:

:&lt;math&gt;I \theta_f=h\int_0^{t_f} m_b V_b\,dt = h m_b L&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\theta_f&lt;/math&gt; is the angle above the aim angle at which the bullet leaves the barrel, &lt;math&gt;t_f&lt;/math&gt; is the time of travel of the bullet in the barrel and ''L'' is the distance the bullet travels from its rest position to the tip of the barrel. The angle at which the bullet leaves the barrel above the aim angle is then given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\theta_f=\frac{h m_b L}{I}&lt;/math&gt;

The momentum of the ejected gases will not contribute very much to this result, since the ejected gases have relatively low mass compared to the bullet, and only that portion of gas exiting closely behind the bullet has significantly high velocity to contribute to recoil momentum.  However, one should understand that total recoil momentum is slightly more than the simple product of the mass and velocity of the exiting projectile, for this reason.

=== Energy ===

A consideration of the energy released during the firing of a gun leads to an additional [[equation]] useful in recoil analysis. Using [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law]], force equals mass times acceleration, the energy within a moving body due to its velocity change caused by that acceleration can be stated mathematically from the [[Kinetic energy#Kinetic energy of rigid bodies|translational kinetic energy]] as:
:&lt;math&gt;E = {\frac 1 2} m v^2 = \frac{p^2}{2m}&lt;/math&gt;
where:
:&lt;math&gt;E\,&lt;/math&gt; is the translational kinetic energy
:&lt;math&gt;m\,&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the body
:&lt;math&gt;v\,&lt;/math&gt; is its velocity
:&lt;math&gt;p\,&lt;/math&gt; is its momentum (''mv'')

This equation is known as the "classic statement" and yields a measurement of energy in [[joule]]s (or [[Foot-pound (energy)|foot-pound force]] in non-SI units). &lt;math&gt;E_t\,&lt;/math&gt; is the amount of [[work (physics)]], force acting through a distance, that can be done by the recoiling firearm, firearm system, or projectile because of its momentum, and is also called the translational kinetic energy. In the firearms lexicon, the energy of a recoiling firearm can be described as "felt recoil", (what the shooter literally feels from the force applied to the shooter's hand, arms and shoulder during the distance the gun recoils to a stop), [[free recoil]], and recoil energy. This same energy equation applies to the projectile exiting the barrel and is called: muzzle energy, bullet energy, remaining energy. Further along on the trajectory, the energy of the projectile at the point of impact is known as the down range energy or impact energy and generally will be slightly smaller than the muzzle energy due to wind resistance slowing the projectile.

Again assuming free-recoil conditions and assuming all forward momentum is due to the projectile, the energy of the projectile will be &lt;math&gt;E_p=p_p^2/2m_p&lt;/math&gt; and the energy of the firearm due to recoil will be &lt;math&gt;E_f=p_f^2/2m_f&lt;/math&gt;. Since, by Newton's third law, &lt;math&gt;p_f+p_p=0&lt;/math&gt;, it follows that the ratios of the energies is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{E_p}{E_f}=\frac{m_f}{m_p}&lt;/math&gt;

The mass of the firearm (&lt;math&gt;m_f&lt;/math&gt;) is generally much greater than the projectile mass (&lt;math&gt;m_p&lt;/math&gt;) which means that most of the kinetic energy produced by the firing of the gun is given to the projectile. (This, of course, is the design intent, to deliver a projectile a great distance forward, as opposed to sending a launcher uselessly rearward).  The source of the kinetic energy is the heat energy rapidly released during propellant combustion.  Rapidly burning propellant in a sealed container generates tremendous pressure.  Pressure is a force applied over an area; in this case the base area of the projectile, driving the projectile down the barrel at high speed.  However, whereas momentum is balanced between the projectile and the recoiling firearm, energy is not.  Energy of the system is certainly conserved, [[conservation of energy]], but in only the general sense that all the energy in the system, kinetic and [[potential energy]], before the event equals all the energy after the event.  That is, some of the potential energy stored in the propellant is released to create kinetic energy in the subsequently moving parts.  Some of the propellant energy, by creating high pressure and recoiling forces, briefly deforms the barrel, gun mount, and projectile materials, which heats these materials internally in the process.  Additional excess heat energy from the propellant escapes through the muzzle blast as the hot gases exit behind the projectile.  All of this heat energy, that does not directly become system kinetic energy, slowly dissipates into the atmosphere as the gun cools.  Therefore, whereas momentum between the gun and projectile balances, through conservation of momentum, kinetic energy does not balance between the two. For example, with a rifle weighing 5 pounds firing a 150 grain bullet, at 2840 feet per second, the recoil energy will be only about 0.43 percent of the total kinetic energy developed. The bullet receives about 2685 foot-pounds of energy, and the rifle only 11.5 ft-lbs of energy, even though the rifle and the bullet both receive about 1.89 pound-sec momentum.  Given the following calculations:

convert the bullet and rifle weights to [[slug (mass)]]

the bullet:  150 grains/7000 grains per pound/32.17 ft/sec^2(g) = .000666 slugs

the rifle:  5 lbs/32.17 = .155 slugs

calculate the bullet momentum first, as its velocity is easiest to estimate from interior ballistics or directly measure at a firing range:

Momentum (bullet) = mass x velocity = .000666 x 2840 ft/sec = 1.89 pound-second

(Admittedly, calculations can be confusing with units of grains, slugs, feet per second, pound-second, foot-pounds, etc., but calculations have to use consistent units, ([[dimensional analysis]]), even if inconsistent units are customary in casual conversation; for example, stating the rifle weight in pounds but the bullet weight in grains.)

Working backwards to find the recoil velocity of the rifle:

Momentum (rifle) = 1.89 = .155 x V(rifle); V(rifle) = 12.2 ft/sec

Calculate bullet and rifle kinetic energy:  1/2 M V^2; 2685 foot-pounds and 11.5 ft-lbs, respectively.  Of the total kinetic energy developed (2685 + 11.5), the rifle receives only 0.43%.

Understanding where all the energy goes during the combustion process is important to properly designing gun and recoil systems.  Recoil energy is initially absorbed by the springs and hydraulic cylinders of the buffering system, or the body of the shooter, which produces the counter-recoil force.  The kinetic energy of recoil is then slowly dissipated as heat energy. For a hand-held firearm, the energy is absorbed by the shooter's body, creating a small amount of heat in muscles and bones. For the naval cannon from the figure above, it will roll backwards and the recoil energy will be mostly absorbed by the friction forces in the wheel axles and between the wheel and the ship deck and this energy is again converted to heat.

=== Including the ejected gas ===

The backward momentum applied to the firearm is actually equal and opposite to the momentum of not only the projectile, but the ejected gas created by the combustion of the charge as well. Likewise, the recoil energy given to the firearm is affected by the ejected gas.  By [[conservation of mass]], the mass of the ejected gas will be equal to the original mass of the propellant. As a rough approximation, the ejected gas can be considered to have an effective exit velocity of &lt;math&gt;\alpha V_0&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;V_0&lt;/math&gt; is the muzzle velocity of the projectile and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is approximately constant. The total momentum &lt;math&gt;p_e&lt;/math&gt; of the propellant and projectile will then be:

:&lt;math&gt;p_e=m_pV_0 + m_g \alpha V_0\,&lt;/math&gt;

where: &lt;math&gt;m_g\,&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the propellant charge, equal to the mass of the ejected gas.

This expression should be substituted into the expression for projectile momentum in order to obtain a more accurate description of the recoil process. The effective velocity may be used in the energy equation as well, but since the value of α used is generally specified for the momentum equation, the energy values obtained may be less accurate. The value of the constant α is generally taken to lie between 1.25 and 1.75. It is mostly dependent upon the type of propellant used, but may depend slightly on other things such as the ratio of the length of the barrel to its radius.

== Perception of recoil ==

[[File:Csa04katherine500smith1.jpg|thumb|right|Recoil while firing [[Smith &amp; Wesson Model 500]] [[revolver]]]]
For small arms, the way in which the shooter perceives the recoil, or ''kick'', can have a significant impact on the shooter's experience and performance. For example, a gun that is said to "kick like a [[mule]]" is going to be approached with trepidation, and the shooter may anticipate the recoil and flinch in anticipation as the shot is released. This leads to the shooter jerking the trigger, rather than pulling it smoothly, and the jerking motion is almost certain to disturb the alignment of the gun and may result in a miss.  The shooter may also be physically injured by firing a weapon generating recoil in excess of what the body can safely absorb or restrain; perhaps getting hit in the eye by the rifle scope, hit in the forehead by a handgun as the elbow bends under the force, or soft tissue damage to the shoulder, wrist and hand; and these results vary for individuals.  In addition, as pictured on the right, excessive recoil can create serious range safety concerns, if the shooter cannot adequately restrain the firearm in a down-range direction.

Perception of recoil is related to the deceleration the body provides against a recoiling gun, deceleration being a force that slows the velocity of the recoiling mass.  Force applied over a distance is energy.  The force that the body feels, therefore, is dissipating the kinetic energy of the recoiling gun mass.  A heavier gun, that is a gun with more mass, will manifest lower recoil kinetic energy, and, generally, result in a lessened perception of recoil.  Therefore, although determining the recoiling energy that must be dissipated through a counter-recoiling force is arrived at by conservation of momentum, kinetic energy of recoil is what is actually being restrained and dissipated.  The ballistics analyst discovers this recoil kinetic energy through analysis of projectile momentum.

One of the common ways of describing the felt recoil of a particular gun-cartridge combination is as "soft" or "sharp" recoiling; soft recoil is recoil spread over a longer period of time, that is at a lower deceleration, and sharp recoil is spread over a shorter period of time, that is with a higher deceleration.  Like pushing softer or harder on the brakes of a car, the driver feels less or more deceleration force being applied, over a longer or shorter distance to bring the car to a stop.  However, for the human body to mechanically adjust recoil time, and hence length, to lessen felt recoil force is perhaps an impossible task.  Other than employing less safe and less accurate practices, such as shooting from the hip, shoulder padding is a safe and effective mechanism that allows sharp recoiling to be lengthened into soft recoiling, as lower decelerating force is transmitted into the body over a slightly greater distance and time, and spread out over a slightly larger surface.  

Keeping the above in mind, you can generally base the relative recoil of firearms by factoring in a small number of parameters:  bullet momentum (weight times velocity), (note that momentum and impulse are interchangeable terms), and the weight of the firearm. Lowering momentum, lowers recoil, all else being the same.  Increasing the firearm weight also lowers recoil, again all else being the same.  The following are base examples calculated through the [http://handloads.com Handloads.com] free online calculator, and bullet and firearm data from respective reloading manuals (of medium/common loads) and manufacturer specs:

In addition to the overall mass of the gun, reciprocating parts of the gun will affect how the shooter perceives recoil.  While these parts are not part of the ejecta, and do not alter the overall momentum of the system, they do involve moving masses during the operation of firing.  For example, [[gas operation|gas-operated]] shotguns are widely held to have a "softer" recoil than fixed breech or [[recoil operation|recoil-operated]] guns.  (Although many semi-automatic recoil and gas-operated guns incorporate recoil buffer systems into the stock that effectively spreads out peak felt recoil forces.)  In a gas-operated gun, the bolt is accelerated rearwards by propellant gases during firing, which results in a forward force on the body of the gun.  This is countered by a rearward force as the bolt reaches the limit of travel and moves forwards, resulting in a zero sum, but to the shooter, the recoil has been spread out over a longer period of time, resulting in the "softer" feel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chuckhawks.com/shotgun_recoil.htm |title=Controlling shotgun recoil |author=Randy Wakeman |publisher=Chuck Hawks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mounted guns ==
[[File:Geb Kan Ord 1877, Rückstoss.jpg|thumb|Real kickback of a canon (Exposed in the [[Morges Castle]], [[Switzerland]])]] 
[[File:AT4 rocket launcher.jpg|thumb|Recoilless designs allow larger and faster projectiles to be shoulder-launched.]]
A recoil system absorbs recoil energy, reducing the peak force that is conveyed to whatever the gun is mounted on.  Old-fashioned [[cannon]]s without a recoil system roll several meters backwards when fired.  First was introduced in Russia as [[Baranovsky gun]] [[:pl:Oporopowrotnik]] by [[Wladimir Baranovsky]] [[:ru:Барановский, Владимир Степанович]] in 1872 ([[short recoil operation]]) and later in France (based on [[Wladimir Baranovsky|Baranovsky]] construction) - [[Canon de 75 modèle 1897|75mm field gun of 1897]] ([[Recoil operation#Long recoil operation|long recoil operation]]). The usual recoil system in modern [[quick-firing gun]]s is the [[Hydraulic recoil mechanism|hydro-pneumatic recoil]] system.  In this system, the barrel is mounted on rails on which it can recoil to the rear, and the recoil is taken up by a cylinder which is similar in operation to an automotive gas-charged [[shock absorber]], and is commonly visible as a cylinder mounted parallel to the barrel of the gun, but shorter and smaller than it.  The cylinder contains a charge of compressed air, as well as hydraulic oil; in operation, the barrel's energy is taken up in compressing the air as the barrel recoils backward, then is dissipated via hydraulic damping as the barrel returns forward to the firing position.  The recoil impulse is thus spread out over the time in which the barrel is compressing the air, rather than over the much narrower interval of time when the projectile is being fired.  This greatly reduces the peak force conveyed to the mount (or to the ground on which the gun has been emplaced).

In a ''soft-recoil system'', the spring (or air cylinder) that returns the barrel to the forward position starts out in a nearly fully compressed position, then the gun's barrel is released free to fly forward in the moment before firing; the charge is then ignited just as the barrel reaches the fully forward position.  Since the barrel is still moving forward when the charge is ignited, about half of the recoil impulse is applied to stopping the forward motion of the barrel, while the other half is, as in the usual system, taken up in recompressing the spring.  A latch then catches the barrel and holds it in the starting position.  This roughly halves the energy that the spring needs to absorb, and also roughly halves the peak force conveyed to the mount, as compared to the usual system.  However, the need to reliably achieve ignition at a single precise instant is a major practical difficulty with this system;&lt;ref name=famag69&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sill-www.army.mil/FAMAG/1969/APR_1969/APR_1969_PAGES_43_48.pdf|title=Soft Recoil System|work=Field Artillery Bulletin|date=April 1969|pages=43–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; and unlike the usual hydro-pneumatic system, soft-recoil systems do not easily deal with [[hang fire|hangfires]] or [[wikt:misfire|misfire]]s.  One of the early guns to use this system was the French [[Canon de 65 M(montagne) modele 1906|65 mm mle.1906]]; it was also used by the World War II British [[PIAT]] man-portable anti-tank weapon.

[[Recoilless rifle]]s and [[shoulder-launched missile weapon|rocket launchers]] exhaust gas to the rear, balancing the recoil. They are used often as light [[anti-tank]] weapons.  The Swedish-made [[Carl Gustav recoilless rifle|Carl Gustav 84mm recoilless gun]] is such a weapon.

In machine guns following [[Hiram Maxim]]'s design - e.g. the [[Vickers machine gun]] - the recoil of the barrel is used to drive the feed mechanism.

== Misconceptions about recoil ==
[[Hollywood]] and [[video game]] depictions of firearm shooting victims being thrown several feet backwards are inaccurate, although not for the often-cited reason of conservation of energy, which would also be in error because conservation of momentum would apply.  Although energy (and momentum) must be conserved (in a [[closed system]]), this does not mean that the kinetic energy or momentum of the bullet must be fully deposited into the target in a manner that causes it to fly dramatically away.  

For example, a bullet fired from an M16 rifle has approximately 1763 Joules of kinetic energy as it leaves the muzzle, but the recoil energy of the gun is less than 7 Joules. Despite this imbalance, energy is still conserved because the total energy in the system before firing (the chemical energy stored in the propellant) is equal to the total energy after firing (the kinetic energy of the recoiling firearm, plus the kinetic energy of the bullet and other ejecta, plus the heat energy from the explosion). In order to work out the distribution of kinetic energy between the firearm and the bullet, it is necessary to use the law of conservation of momentum in combination with the law of conservation of energy.

The same reasoning applies when the bullet strikes a target. The bullet may have a kinetic energy in the hundreds or even thousands of joules, which in theory is enough to lift a person well off the ground. This energy, however, cannot be efficiently given to the target, because total momentum must be conserved, too. Approximately, the fraction of energy transferred to the target (energy transferred to the target divided by the total kinetic energy of the bullet) cannot be larger than the inverse of the ratio of the masses of the target and the bullet itself.

The rest of the bullet's kinetic energy is spent in the deformation or shattering of the bullet (depending on bullet construction), damage to the target (depending on target construction), and heat dissipation. In other words, because the bullet strike on the target is an [[inelastic collision]], only a minority of the bullet energy is used to actually impart momentum to the target. This is why a [[ballistic pendulum]] relies on conservation of bullet momentum and pendulum energy rather than conservation of bullet energy to determine bullet velocity; a bullet fired into a hanging block of wood or other material will spend much of its kinetic energy to create a hole in the wood and dissipate heat as friction as it slows to a stop.

Gunshot victims frequently (but not always) simply collapse when shot, which is usually due to psychological expectation when hit, a direct hit to the central nervous system, or rapid blood pressure drop causing immediate unconsciousness (see [[stopping power]]), or the bullet shatters a leg bone, and not the result of the momentum of the bullet pushing them over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=One-Shot Drops Surviving the Myth |author=Anthony J.

'''SATEB''' (Workers’ Esperanto Movement) is the British affiliate of the non-nationalist world organisation SAT ([[Sennacieca Asocio Tutmonda]]) which is a worldwide worker movement active in [[socialist]], [[peace]], [[trade union]], [[feminist]] and [[natural environment|environmental]] issues.

SATEB organizes an annual residential weekend at The [[Wedgwood Memorial College]], [[Barlaston]], [[Stoke-on-Trent]]. The main feature of these meetings is the visit of [[Esperanto]]-speaking lecturers from abroad (e.g. from Cuba, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and other countries).

Members of SATEB receive the bilingual quarterly magazine ''La Verda Proleto''.

== Proposed suspension ==

At the 2007 annual meeting of SATEB, which seven people attended including the guest speaker, the committee proposed a motion to suspend activity of SATEB until there emerged sufficient people to perform its essential roles.  However, after debate it was decided to continue at a minimal level of activity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4291">'''Shankar Dattatraya Javdekar''' ({{lang-mr|शंकर दत्तात्रय जावडेकर}}) (1894–1955, alternatively ''Javadekar'' or ''Jawadekar''), popularly known as '''Acharya Javdekar''', was a [[Marathi people|Marathi]] writer from [[Maharashtra]], [[India]].&lt;ref name=lederle/&gt;

He was born on 26 September 1894. His schooling was in [[Kolhapur]], and he did his B.A. from [[Fergusson College]], [[Pune]], specialising in philosophy.&lt;ref name=dap/&gt;

While studying for his M.A. degree, he set aside his studies to join [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s [[non-cooperation movement]] against the [[British Raj]]. During 1923-26, he operated a dormitory for students belonging to the [[Dalit|untouchable]] community in the Indian society of his times. This dormitory was located in a village near [[Islampur, Sangli|Islampur]] in Maharashtra.

Subsequently, Javdekar served as the editor of the dailies ''Navashakti'' (New Power) and ''Lok Shakti'' (People's Power). He was the editor of the weekly ''[[Sadhana (weekly)|Sadhana]]'' from 1950 to 1952.&lt;ref name=mml/&gt;

Javdekar was a [[social democrat]] in his political thinking, and was influenced by the political and social views of [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. In his 1954 book ''सर्वोदय आणि समाजवाद'' (Sarwodaya and Samajwad), he propounded ''Satyagrahi Samajwad'' (सत्याग्रही समाजवाद) philosophy, attempting to amalgamate [[Marxism]] and [[Gandhism]]. He also attempted to reconcile the views of [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak|Tilak]] and [[Gandhi]] in his book ''लो. टिळक व म. गांधी'' (Lokamnya Tilak Wa Mahatma Gandhi).&lt;ref name=useful/&gt;

In his literary work "आधुनिक भारत" (''Adhunik Bharat'') (1938), he described the philosophical evolution of India through its struggle for freedom from the British rule.&lt;ref name=dap/&gt;

He presided over [[Marathi Sahitya Sammelan]] in [[Pune]] in 1949. He died in December 1955.&lt;ref name=mml/&gt;

'''Shlomo Zemach''' ({{lang-he|שלמה צמח}}; born 2 June 1886, died 6 November 1974) was an Israeli author, agriculturalist and early [[Zionism|Zionist]] pioneer.

==Biography==
Zemach was born in 1886 in [[Płońsk]], [[Poland]], then part of the [[Russian Empire]], and was a descendant of Rabbi [[Avraham Gombiner]] (known as the "Magen Avraham") and his descendant, Rabbi [[Zvi Hirsch HaLevi of Plonsk]] (known as the "Plant (Zemach) of Avraham", from where Zemach's surname originates). He was a childhood friend of [[David Ben-Gurion]]. Zemach received a traditional Jewish education at [[cheder]] and [[beit midrash]]. In 1900, at the age of 14, Ben-Gurion and Zemach founded a Zionist youth association in Płońsk, under the name [[Ezra Association]], whose members spoke only Hebrew.

In 1904, Zemach [[Aliyah|emigrated]] to [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Palestine]]. He worked as an agricultural worker for five years. In 1905, he was among the founders of the [[Hapoel Hatzair]] Zionist organization.

From 1909 to 1914, Zemach studied agriculture, literature and philosophy in [[France]]. In 1914, he qualified as an agricultural engineer, and went to visit his parents' home in Płońsk, where he was caught up in the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]]. He was engaged in literary work in [[Warsaw]] and later on in [[Odessa]]. In 1921, he returned to then [[Mandatory Palestine|British-administered Palestine]]. He was employed as a teacher at the [[Mikveh Israel]] agricultural school and, in 1933, he was the principal founder of the [[Kadoorie Agricultural High School]] and served as its first headmaster.

He wrote a number of books and articles on agriculture. He was also a literary critic and edited the literary journal ''Maazanim''.

==Awards==
* In 1944, Zemach was awarded the [[Bialik Prize]] for Literature, jointly with [[Yehuda Karni]].&lt;ref name=bialik&gt;{{Cite web|title=List of Bialik Prize recipients 1933-2004 (in Hebrew), Tel Aviv Municipality website |url=http://www.tel-aviv.gov.il/Hebrew/_MultimediaServer/Documents/12516738.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217143811/http://www.tel-aviv.gov.il/Hebrew/_MultimediaServer/Documents/12516738.pdf |archivedate=December 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Southern Daly languages''' are a proposed family of two distantly related [[Australian aboriginal languages]].  They are: 

*[[Murrinh-patha language|Murrinh-patha]] (Murinbata)
*[[Ngan'gityemerri language|Ngan’gityemerri]] (Ngan’gi)

==Classification==
Southern Daly is a distant and problematic relationship.
Murrinh-Patha was once thought to be an isolate, due to lexical data:  It has, at most, an 11-percent shared vocabulary with any other language against which it has been compared.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, N.J. ''Ngan’gityemerri''. Unpublished PhD thesis, Australian National University, Canberra, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Murrinh-patha and Ngan’gityemerri correspond closely in their verbal inflections. Green (2003) makes a case that the formal correspondences in core morphological sequences of their finite verbs are too similar (in their complexities and their irregularities) to have come about through anything other than a shared genetic legacy from a common parent language.&lt;ref name="Green 2003"&gt;Green, I. "The Genetic Status of Murrinh-patha" in Evans, N., ed. "The Non-Pama-Nyungan Languages of Northern Australia: comparative studies of the continent’s most linguistically complex region". ''Studies in Language Change'', 552. Canberra: Pacific Linguistics, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, lexically they have almost nothing in common, other than cognates in their words for 'thou' ''(nhinhi'' and ''nyinyi)'' and 'this' ''(kanhi'' and ''kinyi),''&lt;ref&gt;Note that Ngan’gityemerri has no ''nh,'' and so one would expect it to have ''ny'' where its relatives have ''nh.''&lt;/ref&gt; and it is not clear what could explain this discrepancy.

Depending on context, the term "spime" can refer to both—the archetype, as designed by the developer, or a user-specific instance of it.

==Origin==
The term spime was coined for this concept by author [[Bruce Sterling]]. It is a contraction of “space” and “time” which derives from his thought of a spime being an “object precisely localized in time and space [...] always associated with a history.”&lt;ref name="Pelet"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pelet |first=Jean-Eric |author2=Benoît Lecat|author3=Panagiota Papadopoulou |title=Enhancing learning and cooperatio n through digital virtual worlds |journal=IPEDR vol.18 |year=2011 |url=http://www.ipedr.com/vol18/6-ICERI2011-R00013.pdf |accessdate=June 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was probably first used in a large public forum by Sterling at [[SIGGRAPH]] Los Angeles, August 2004.&lt;ref name="SIGGRAPH"/&gt; The idea was further expanded upon in his book [[Shaping Things]].&lt;ref name="Shaping Things"/&gt; Since, the use of the term by researchers and in industry has grown&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bonanni|first=Leonardo|last2=Vargas|first2=Greg|last3=Chao|first3=Neil|last4=Pueblo|first4=Stephen|last5=Ishii|first5=Hiroshi|date=2009-01-01|title=Spime Builder: A Tangible Interface for Designing Hyperlinked Objects|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1517664.1517719|journal=Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Tangible and Embedded Interaction|series=TEI '09|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=263–266|doi=10.1145/1517664.1517719|isbn=9781605584935}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.basen.net/pages/basen_spime.html|title=BaseN|website=www.basen.net|access-date=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/02/spime-watch-way-way-beyond-internet-things/|title=Spime Watch: way, way beyond the Internet of Things|last=Sterling|first=Bruce|newspaper=WIRED|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Concept==
The six facets of spimes are&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-0-387-46264-6|title=Ambient Intelligence with Microsystems - Springer|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|doi=10.1007/978-0-387-46264-6|quote=|lay-source=|lay-date=|via=|url-access=limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

# Small, inexpensive means of remotely and uniquely identifying objects over short ranges; for example [[RFID|radio-frequency identification]].
# A mechanism to precisely locate something on Earth, such as a [[GPS|global-positioning system]].
# A way to [[data mining|mine]] large amounts of data for things that match some given criteria, like internet [[search engines]].
# Tools to virtually construct nearly any kind of object; [[computer-aided design]].
# Ways to [[rapid prototyping|rapidly prototype]] virtual objects into real ones. Sophisticated, automated fabrication of a specification for an object, through “[[3D printing|three-dimensional printers]].”
# "[[Cradle-to-cradle design|Cradle-to-cradle]]" life-spans for objects. Cheap, effective [[recycling]].

With all six of these, one could track the entire existence of an object, from before it was made (its virtual representation), through its manufacture, its ownership history, its physical location, until its eventual obsolescence and breaking-down back into raw material to be used for new instantiations of objects. If recorded, the lifetime of the object can be archived and queried.

Spimes are not defined merely by these six technologies; rather, if these technologies converge within the manufacturing process then spimes could indeed arise. Due to physical limitations and cost-effectiveness, objects that perform similar functions to a spime but exist in a heterogeneous ecosystem where some of their spime-like functionality is performed by and/or shared with other entities may be precursors to spimes. For example, integrating a GPS receiver into every object is currently impractical because of size, power, and cost, among other reasons, but a base station that provides location services for one or many nearby devices may be more practical&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

The '''Tagalog Wikipedia''' ({{lang-tl|{{#property:P1448}}}}) is the [[Tagalog language]] edition of [[Wikipedia]], which was launched on December 1, 2003. It has {{formatnum:{{#expr:{{NUMBEROF|ARTICLES|tl}} round-0}}}} articles and is the [[meta:List of Wikipedias#All Wikipedias ordered by number of articles|68th largest Wikipedia according to the number of articles]] as of {{Currentmonthday}}, {{Currentyear}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[:tl:Unang Pahina|"Wikipedia, ang malayang ensiklopedya: Unang Pahina".]] ''Tagalog Wikipedia'' (in Tagalog). Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. July 24, 2015. Retrieved 24 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  This has fewer articles than the [[Cebuano Wikipedia]], the largest [[Philippines|Philippine]]-based language version of Wikipedia, which currently has more than {{formatnum:{{#expr:{{NUMBEROF|ARTICLES|ceb}} round -3}}}} articles and the [[Waray Wikipedia]], which has more than {{formatnum:{{#expr:{{NUMBEROF|ARTICLES|war}} round -3}}}} articles.&lt;ref&gt;[[:ceb:Special:Mga Estadistika|Mga Estadistika]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/article/88828/maupay--waray-wikipedia-hits-more-than-one-million-articles|title=MAUPAY: Waray Wikipedia hits more than one million articles|date=11 June 2014|newspaper=[[News5|InterAksyon]]|access-date=23 October 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611153410/http://www.interaksyon.com/article/88828/maupay--waray-wikipedia-hits-more-than-one-million-articles|archivedate=11 June 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Tagalog Wikipedia has an [[meta:Depth|article depth]] of {{Depth|tl|2}}, compared to {{Depth|war|2}} for the Waray Wikipedia and {{Depth|ceb|2}} for the Cebuano Wikipedia, as of {{Currentmonthday}}, {{Currentyear}}.&lt;ref name="WikipediaArticleDepth"&gt;[https://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_article_depth&amp;oldid=11727135 Wikipedia article depth - Meta]&lt;/ref&gt;

By active users, it has {{NUMBEROF|ACTIVEUSERS|tl|N}}, compared to {{NUMBEROF|ACTIVEUSERS|ceb|N}} for the Cebuano Wikipedia and {{NUMBEROF|ACTIVEUSERS|war|N}} for the Waray language edition.

==History==
The Tagalog Wikipedia was launched on December 1, 2003 as the first Wikipedia in a [[Languages of the Philippines|language of the Philippines]] requested at the [[Wikimedia Incubator]], where potential Wikimedia project wikis in new language versions can be proposed.

As of February 3, 2011, it has more than [[:tl:Special:Statistics|50,000 articles]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:tl:Unang Pahina|Tagalog Wikipedia]], retrieved on February 3, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[:tl:Bantayan, Cebu|Bantayan, Cebu]] became the 10,000th article on October 20, 2007 while ''[[:tl:Pasko sa Pilipinas|Pasko sa Pilipinas]]'' ([[Christmas in the Philippines]]) became the 15,000th article on December 24, 2007.&lt;ref name=WPPinoy&gt;From the ''Announcements'' at ''[[Wikipedia:Tambayan Philippines]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Localization of software messages through the [[:betawiki:Main Page|Betawiki]] (or [[translatewiki.net]]) was finished on February 6, 2009.&lt;ref name=Betawiki&gt;[http://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&amp;translations=only&amp;trailer=/{{CONTENTLANGUAGE}} List of tasks at Translatewiki.net (Betawiki)]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, on February 6, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Tagalog Wikipedia was part of the [[meta:Research:WikiHistories fellowship|WikiHistories fellowship]] research project of the [[Wikimedia Foundation]]. The project tries to capture the triumphs, failures, and daily struggles of the editors working to make the dream of globally shared knowledge a reality.&lt;ref&gt;[[meta:Research:WikiHistories fellowship|From the project page of WikiHistories]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===First steps of Tagalog Wikipedia===
The very first article created in the Tagalog Wikipedia (aside from ''[[:tl:Unang Pahinga|Unang Pahinga]]'' or the main page) is about [[:tl:Wikipedia|Wikipedia]]. It was created on March 25, 2004. During the times when Tagalog Wikipedia's standards on articles were not strict, the very first featured article was ''[[:tl:Livestrong wristband|Livestrong wristband]]'', but this was replaced by the article ''[[:tl:Kimika|kimika]]'' ([[chemistry]]) in line with the revised standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Česky |url=http://tl.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Mga_napiling_artikulo&amp;direction=next&amp;oldid=22753 |title=From the archive of the Tagalog Wikipedia |publisher=Tl.wikipedia.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-15|language=tl}}&lt;/ref&gt; But ''kimika'' along with the second featured article [[:tl:Wiki|wiki]] were eventually replaced by a review process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tl.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3APagbabalik-tanaw_sa_mga_napiling_artikulo&amp;diff=190910&amp;oldid=187843 |title=From the review of ''Kimika'' on the Tagalog Wikipedia, Marso 25-26, 2008 |publisher=Tl.wikipedia.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-15|language=tl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Česky |url=http://tl.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Mga_napiling_artikulo&amp;direction=next&amp;oldid=33192 |title=From the history of the ''Wikipedia:Mga napiling artikulo'' |publisher=Tl.wikipedia.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-15|language=tl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technically, the very first featured article that survived the review process is about [[:tl:Keso|keso]] ([[cheese]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Česky |url=http://tl.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Mga_napiling_artikulo&amp;direction=next&amp;oldid=33368 |title=From the history of the ''Wikipedia:Mga napiling artikulo'' |publisher=Tl.wikipedia.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-15|language=tl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''File:Flutterbye.jpg'' was the first [[:tl:Wikipedia:Sinupan ng mga nagdaang napiling larawan/Sinupan 1|featured picture]] for the article ''[[:tl:Paru-parong Viceroy|paru-parong Viceroy]]'' ([[Viceroy butterfly]]). Because the file was deleted, it was replaced by ''[[:File:St Vitus stained glass.jpg|File:St Vitus stained glass.jpg]]'' for the article ''[[:tl:Katedral ng San Vitus|Katedral ng San Vitus]]'' ([[St. Vitus Cathedral]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tl.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Supnayan_ng_mga_nagdaang_napiling_larawan&amp;direction=next&amp;oldid=32917 |title=From the archive of the Tagalog Wikipedia |publisher=Tl.wikipedia.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-15|language=tl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[:tl:Wikipedia:Sinupan ng mga nagdaang napiling larawan/Sinupan 1|featured picture archive]] lists ''[[:File:Viceroy Butterfly.jpg|File:Viceroy Butterfly.jpg]]'' as the first featured picture.

The first three articles that appeared in ''[[:tl:Wikipedia:Mga huling dinagdag|Alam Ba Ninyo?]]'' ([[Wikipedia:Did you know?|Did you know?]]) were ''[[:tl:Web browser|web browser]]'' ([[Web browser|en]]), ''[[:tl:Wikang Bulgaro|Wikang Bulgaro]]'' ([[Bulgarian language]]) and ''[[:tl:Pilipinas|Pilipinas]]'' ([[Philippines]]).&lt;ref name=TW2005&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tl.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:UnangPahinaAlam&amp;oldid=14215 |title=From the history of template of ''Alam Ba Ninyo?'' |publisher=Tl.wikipedia.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-15|language=tl}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a section entitled ''[[:tl:Wikipedia:Mga pangyayari noong unang panahon|On This Day]]'' at the main page in April 2, 2008, but this was hidden on May 3, 2008 because of lack of contributors of this section.&lt;ref name=SaArawnaIto&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tl.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Mga_pangyayari_noong_unang_panahon&amp;oldid=193523 |title=From the history of ''Wikipedia:Mga pangyayari noong unang panahon'' |publisher=Tl.wikipedia.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-15|language=tl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SaArawnaIto2&gt;{{cite web|author=Česky |url=http://tl.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Unang_Pahina&amp;oldid=201870 |title=From the history of ''Unang Pahina'' |publisher=Tl.wikipedia.org |date=2011-08-24 |accessdate=2012-02-15|language=tl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
The Tagalog Wikipedia has several characteristics which define it differently from other language editions of Wikipedia. According to [[Michael Tan]], a Filipino [[anthropologist]] and ''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]'' columnist, the Tagalog Wikipedia greatly depends on the [[UP Diksyonaryong Filipino]] for basic definitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/9149/%E2%80%98utak%E2%80%99 |title=''Pinoy Kasi'': 'Utak' |last=Tan |first= Michael |author-link=Michael Tan |newspaper=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date=2 August 2011|access-date=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though focused on the Tagalog language, it has pages that helps non-Tagalog speakers on anything related about the online project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/120098/hold-up-half-the-sky-not-there-yet |title=The Artist Abroad: Hold up half the sky? Not there yet |last=Francia |first=Luis |newspaper=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date=27 March 2015|access-date=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coverage===
The Tagalog Wikipedia has significant coverage of topics related to the Philippines, as well as [[anime]] and [[manga]]-related topics. In 2010, [[GMA News and Public Affairs]] released a report criticizing the Tagalog Wikipedia's lack of science-related articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/202631/scitech/google-translate-spews-profanities-in-filipino |title=Google Translate spews profanities in Filipino |last1=Dimacali |first1= Timothy James M. |author-link1=TJ Dimacali |newspaper=[[GMA News]] |date=5 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Project name===
According to Wikipedians from the Tagalog and English Wikipedias, the Tagalog Wikipedia also represents the [[Filipino language]].&lt;ref name=Wika&gt;[[:tl:Wikipedia:Pamantayang pangwika]] ; [[:tl:Wikipedia:Gabay sa abakada at pagbabaybay]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tl.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Kapihan&amp;oldid=352405 |title=Wikipedia:Kapihan: "Filipino Wikipedia (on Wikimedia Incubator)" |publisher=Tl.wikipedia.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-15|language=tl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaugnay: [[Wikipedia talk:Tambayan Philippines/Archive14#The Filipino Wiktionary Debate .28formerly It.27s official.29|''The Filipino Wiktionary Debate (formerly It's official)'']] ([[:en:Wikipedia talk:Tambayan Philippines/Archive14#The Filipino Wiktionary Debate (formerly It's official)|WP:Tambay Archive14]])&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Vibal Foundation, a foundation that started [[WikiPilipinas]], the Tagalog Wikipedia is different from WikiFilipino, the [[wiki]] that they manage because WikiFilipino uses Filipino language while Tagalog Wikipedia uses Tagalog language.&lt;ref name="vibal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vibalfoundation.org/?p=16 |title=WikiFilipino, Isang Pagsusuri |work=Kristine Mandigma |publisher=Vibal Foundation |accessdate=2009-05-15}} {{dead link|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference or sameness of Tagalog and Filipino sparked a [[:tl:Wikipedia:Pagsalin ng mga nilalaman ng Wikipedia na ito sa Filipino|debate]] among Tagalog Wikipedians about the name of the project. This debate was mentioned in an article by DILA (''Defenders of the Indigenous Languages of the Archipelago''),&lt;ref name="DILA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dila.ph/subdialect_filipino.pdf |title=''The Subdialect Filipino'' |work=Guerrero de la Paz |publisher=Defenders of the Indigenous Languages of the Archipelago |accessdate=2009-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; an organization that defends indigenous languages of the Philippines.

'''Yiddish Wikipedia''' is the [[Yiddish]]-language version of [[Wikipedia]]. It was founded on March 3, 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1 = |last1 = |first2 = |last2 = |first3 = |last3 = |first4 = |last4 = |title = Yiddish Wikipedia now active |url = http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.science.linguistics.wikipedia.international/2933|date = March 16, 2004|publisher = wikipedia.international mailinglist|website = |accessdate = September 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first article was written November 28 of that year.

==Current status==
The Yiddish Wikipedia now has {{NUMBEROF|ARTICLES|yi|N}} articles. There are {{NUMBEROF|USERS|yi|N}} registered users (including bots); {{NUMBEROF|ACTIVEUSERS|yi|N}} are active, including {{NUMBEROF|ADMINS|yi|N}} administrators.

Like all Wikipedias it generates hits from Yiddish words typed in Google, with Wikipedia articles appearing at the top of the results for that word.

In accordance with the norms for the Yiddish language, it is written almost exclusively in Hebrew script, and not in Latin script.

== Milestones ==
The Yiddish Wikipedia reached 6,000 articles on March 8, 2009. The 6,000th article is [[:yi:יהושע העשיל תאומים-פרענקל (ב)|יהושע העשיל תאומים-פרענקל]], a rabbi. The 7,000th article is [[:yi:חנינא סגן הכהנים|חנינא סגן הכהנים]], a page about the [[Tannaim|tanna]] [[Hanina Segan ha-Kohanim]] created on December 24, 2009.

==Point of view==
Combined, the different [[Hasidic]] groups form the largest Yiddish-speaking community in the world today. Most new articles are about Hasidic rabbis.&lt;ref&gt;[[:yi:באַזונדער:נייע בלעטער]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Youssof Kohzad''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: &lt;big&gt;يوسف كهزاد&lt;/big&gt;; also spelled '''Youssef Kohzad''') (born 1935) is an ethnic [[Tajiks|Tajik]] [[writer]], [[Painting|painter]], [[playwright]], [[artist]], [[poet]], [[actor]], and [[art consultant]] from Afghanistan.  He has now taken residence in [[Tracy, California]], United States since his [[emigration]] from [[Afghanistan]]. He is married to [[Zakia Kohzad]].

== Background ==

Youssef Kohzad was born in 1935 in the Chendawol district of Kabul, Afghanistan. During his high school years, he wrote plays and created artwork for [[Kabul Theater]]. Kohzad graduated from Nejat (Amani) High School in Kabul in 1953. He finished his formal art education from the [[Academy of Art]] in [[Rome, Italy]] in 1965. After returning from Italy, he traveled to the former [[Soviet Union]], India and former Eastern Germany to exhibit his art along with other contemporary Afghan artists. Many of his works are showcased in the Middle Eastern Studies museums in [[Moscow]].

From 1966-1969 he held executive positions at the [[Ministry of Media and Culture]], in which he was the head of the [[Fine Arts]] Department.

In 1971 he became the art consultant of Kabul Theater. He wrote eight dramas and all were played on stage. In many of the plays, he played the lead role.

In 1975 he returned to the Ministry of Media and Culture and held the position as the president of the ministry until 1992.

In 1976, he founded the [[National Gallery]] in Kabul, which included 700 paintings, and some work dating back a hundred years. Unfortunately, out of the 700 works of art only 30 remain today.

From 1992 until August 2000, Kohzad became a [[Afghan refugees|refugee]] along with his family and was forced to immigrate to India. In August 2000, he moved to the United States and has been residing in [[Northern California]] since then. His first art exhibit in the United States was held in August 2001 in [[Palo Alto]].

'''ǀXam''' (/Kham) ({{IPA-all|{{!}}͡xam}}, English pronunciation {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɑː|m}}), or ''ǀXam Kaǃkʼe'', is an [[list of extinct languages|extinct]] [[Khoisan language]] of South Africa, part of the [[Tuu languages|ǃUi branch of the Tuu languages]]. It is closely related to the [[Endangered language|moribund]] [[Nǁng language]]. Much of the scholarly work on ǀXam was performed by [[Wilhelm Bleek]], a German [[linguistics|linguist]] of the 19th century, who studied a variety of ǀXam spoken at Achterveld, and (with [[Lucy Lloyd]]) another spoken at Strandberg and Katkop.&lt;ref&gt;Güldemann (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name ==
The pipe at the beginning of the name "ǀXam" represents a [[dental click]], like the English [[interjection]] ''tsk, tsk!'' used to express pity or shame. The {{angbr|x}} denotes a [[voiceless velar fricative]] click accompaniment.

Compared to other Khoisan languages, there is little variation in rendering the name though it is sometimes seen with the simple orthographic variant ''ǀKham'', as well as a different grammatical form, ''ǀKhuai''.

== Phonology ==

=== Consonants ===
Compared to other Tuu languages like [[Taa language|Taa]], ǀXam has a more restricted inventory of consonants particularly the clicks, where there are only 8 series of click accompaniments, far fewer than East !Xoon Taa's 18.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QvpwwRLYai0C|title=The Khoesan Languages|last=Vossen|first=Rainer|date=1 January 2013|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780700712892|page=210|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A preliminary consonant inventory of ǀXam, including egressive stops, fricatives, and affricates as well as ingressive clicks, is listed below.

=== Mythological characters ===
Bleek notes that particular animal figures in ǀXam mythology have distinctive speech patterns, including [[Ingressive sound|ingressive]] sounds and changes in click type. For example, the Tortoise speaks with predominantly bilabial clicks, the Ichneumon uses palatal and dental click-sibilant clusters, and the Jackal is even said to use an unusual lateralised bilabial click. The Moon, Hare and Anteater even use an "unpronounceable" click in place of all clicks save the bilabial. Other changes noted include the Blue Crane's speech, who ends the first syllable of almost every word with a /t/.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://repository.up.ac.za/handle/2263/12485|title=A brief account of Bushman folklore and other texts|last=1827–1875|first=Bleek, W.H.I. (Wilhelm Heinrich Immanuel),|last2=1834–1914|first2=Lloyd, Lucy,|website=repository.up.ac.za|language=en|access-date=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motto of South Africa ==

ǀXam was used for the [[South Africa]]n motto on the [[Coat of arms of South Africa|coat of arms]] adopted on 27 April 2000:
: ''{{lang|xam|ǃke e: ǀxarra ǁke}}''
The intended meaning is ''Diverse people unite'' or, on a collective scale, ''Unity in Diversity''. The word-for-word translation is ''people who are different meet.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bushmandictionar00blee|title=Bushman dictionary|last=Bleek|first=Dorothea Frances|date=1 January 1956|publisher=New Haven,: American Oriental Society|pages=419, 36, 363, 566}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is not known if that phrase would have been [[idiom]]atic in ǀXam.&lt;ref&gt;Bleek's ''Bushman Dictionary'' records ''!k'e e: |xarra'' with the meaning "strangers".&lt;/ref&gt; Because it is extinct, ǀXam is not one of the [[Languages of South Africa|eleven official languages of South Africa]].
