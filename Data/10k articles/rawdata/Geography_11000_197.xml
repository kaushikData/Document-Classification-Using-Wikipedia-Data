'''Alexey V. Postnikov''' (born 1939) is an internationally known specialist on the History of Science, with particular emphasis on the geography and cartography of Russia and these countries that have been under Russian influence from the 17th through the 20th centuries.

He analyzed the development of Earth Sciences and Cartography in a broad social-cultural context. It reveals the limitation of Eurocetric approach&lt;ref&gt;[http://ndsmcobserver.com/2011/09/eurocentrism-it-affects-you-too/ Eurocentrism: it affects you, too ], The Observer. Retrieved 29 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; by including the rich traditions of old Asian and American countries and people, as well as historical processes of their interaction and mutual influences with European geographical practices and theories. His work ''Mapping of Russian America: A History of Russian–American Contacts in Cartography'' is the most representative examples of this. Besides that fundamental monograph, the article ''Learning from Each Other – a History of Russian-native contacts in late Eighteenth - early Nineteenth Century Exploration and Mapping of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands'' in the ''International Hydrographic Review'' may be mentioned in this connection, whiсh deals with Native Americans' geographical data's use by Russian in Alaska and Aleutian Island.

In addition to their value as fundamental research on the development of cosmographical and geographical ideas and methods in different periods of the human history, Prof. Postnikov's studies in the History of Science, are important research tools for historical geographers who deal with detailed studies of territorial aspects of changes in nature and society.

==Biography==
Born in Moscow in 1939 in the family of a diplomat (father Vladimir M. Konstantinov) and a military doctor (mother Maria A. Postnikova). He was graduated with a degree in [[geodesy]] from Moscow Institute of Engineers of Geodesy (the faculty of  Air Surveying and Cartography) in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aihs-iahs.org/en/system/files/postnikov_alexey.pdf Alexey Vladimirovich Postnikov] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529210014/http://www.aihs-iahs.org/en/system/files/postnikov_alexey.pdf |date=29 May 2014 }}, International Academy of the History of Science. Retrieved 29 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1965 Alexey Postnikov was a research fellow aboard of the exploring ship "Bataysk", in 1967 he obtained the post of editor and author of historical Maps for the Soviet Atlas of World History and Atlas of the History of the USSR. From 1974 till 1977 he was a member of chief administration of geodesy and cartography of the Soviet of Ministers of the USSR.

His academic career in the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Soviet Academy of Sciences]] was in 1972, when Alexei Postnikov was employed in the Institute of Russian History as a junior researcher. In 1980 Postnikov began his work in the Institute for the History of Science and Technology named after S.I. Vavilov, first as researcher and finally as director.

Nowadays Prof. Postnikov is working as chief researcher at the Institute for the History of Science and Technology named after S.I. Vavilov [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], a director of ''[[Imago Mundi]]'' International Journal on the History of Cartography, the expert at [[John Brian Harley|Harley Fellowships]], co-editor of the collective monography ''The History of Cartography'', the director of [[Nicholas Roerich|Roerich's]] fund.

'''At-location mapping''' ('''ALM''') is closely related to [[location-based service]]s (LBS). However, ALM focuses on the delivery of maps 'at location', using mobile devices that are enabled with [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) technology. At-location mapping devices, like [[personal digital assistant]]s (PDAs) or [[cellular telephone]]s, deliver maps on small screens that can be used for navigation or [[wayfinding]]. The attributes of these maps are that they are small, perhaps only 100&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;100 [[pixel]]s and they must work adequately on small colour screens. ALM is a developing area that contributes geographical content to services provided by mobile devices using the mobile Internet of cellular telephone services.

A '''borrow ditch''' is a roadside channel dug for [[drainage]] purposes. Typically, the dirt is "borrowed" from the ditch, and used to crown the road. It is a variation of a Bar (borrow) Pit, in construction, when dirt is removed and used for construction purposes, and later left to fill with water, forming ponds or lakes. Also, adjacent to pasturage, confines cattle keeping livestock from straying onto road [cattle country, western USA] [Possibly archaic]  &lt;ref&gt;Avis, Walter S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4223">The '''Burkle addressing system''' is a system of assigning road names and addresses over a large, [[rural area|rural]] geographical area.  It is used in the state of [[North Dakota]] for rural addresses to be used for the 911 system as well as mail delivery to rural properties.  Because of its use in the 911 system, it is enshrined in [[North Dakota Century Code|North Dakota state law]] and is used across the state.&lt;ref name="century-code"&gt;{{cite act | title=Emergency Services Communications Systems | type=North Dakota Century Code | number=57-40.6-10 part d. | url=http://www.legis.nd.gov/cencode/t57c40-6.pdf | accessdate=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The system was created by the [[Stark County, North Dakota]] emergency coordinator [[Komard Burkle|Kornard Burkle]] as a way of assigning addresses to houses for use in the then soon to be implemented [[enhanced 911]] services in Stark County.&lt;ref name="farm-show"&gt;{{Citation | last=Bailey | first=Ann | title=Promising new addressing system for rural areas | journal=Farm Show | volume=12 | issue=3 | pages=20 | date=1988 | url=https://www.farmshow.com/a_article.php?aid=4428}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A key problem for the system was that since most of the county was rural farmland a significant number of farms in the county either lacked a proper address, or the address they had was not in any uniform system.  After a meeting on the proposed E911 implementation, Burkle went home and devised what would become the Burkle addressing system to address the challenges faced by the county.&lt;ref name="farm-show"/&gt;  Because other counties implementing the E911 system in North Dakota faced the same problem and to add a measure of consistency across the state, it was decided that the Burkle system would be used state wide for addressing rural properties.&lt;ref name="stark-faq"&gt;{{Cite web | title=Questions and Answers About the Stark County Emergency E-9-1-1 Telephone System | access-date=2017-06-07 | url=http://nd911.homestead.com/Burkle-Kostelecky_Addressing_Q___A.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time it was proposed, no state had adopted a statewide addressing system&lt;ref name="farm-show"/&gt; but since then other states have adopted similar systems.&lt;ref name="sd-address"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://dps.sd.gov/emergency_services/emergency_management/images/ra_handbook.pdf | title=South Dakota Rural Addressing Procedural Handbook | date=September 1992 | publisher=South Dakota 9-1-1 Task Force | access-date=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design of the system ==
=== Road names ===

The basic idea of the system was inspired by the existing address system used in many towns where streets and avenues are numbered outwards from a starting "main street" near the center of town.  To number rural [[section line road]]s in the state the rough geographical centerlines of the state were designated as "Main Street" (running east-west) and "Main Avenue" (running north-south).  Roads are assigned an increasing number moving out from these centerlines with the number of the road determined by the number of miles it is from the corresponding centerline.  For roads on half section lines an M is added to the road name and for quarter section lines an F is added.&lt;ref name="stark-faq"/&gt;

=== Addresses ===

In addition to providing names for the many rural roads, the system also provides a method of assigning addresses to properties along these roads.  As with most city house numbering systems, the first digits of the house number are simply taken from the lower numbered crossing street or avenue on the "[[city block|block]]" that the property resides on.  For the final two digits of the house number the one mile section lines are divided into segments of 1/50th of a mile and this is used to assign the final two digits; choosing an odd number if the property is on the north or west side of the road or an even number for properties on the south or east side.&lt;ref name="stark-faq"/&gt;  In areas of subdivisions where the system is employed but a higher address accuracy is required, the increments are reduced to 1/100th of a mile.&lt;ref name="stark-faq"/&gt;

In [[astronomy]], a '''celestial coordinate system''' (or '''celestial reference system''') is a system for specifying positions of celestial objects: [[Natural satellite|satellites]], [[Planet|planets]], [[Star|stars]], [[Galaxy|galaxies]], and so on. [[Coordinate system]]s can specify an object's position in [[three-dimensional space]] or [[plot (graphics)|plot]] merely its direction on a [[celestial sphere]], if the object's distance is unknown or trivial.

The coordinate systems are implemented in either [[spherical coordinate system|spherical]] or [[Cartesian coordinate system|rectangular coordinates]]. Spherical coordinates, projected on the [[celestial sphere]], are analogous to the [[geographic coordinate system]] used on the surface of [[Earth]]. These differ in their choice of [[fundamental plane (spherical coordinates)|fundamental plane]], which divides the celestial sphere into two equal [[sphere|hemisphere]]s along a [[great circle]]. Rectangular coordinates, in appropriate [[Units of measurement|units]], are simply the cartesian equivalent of the [[Spherical coordinate system|spherical coordinates]], with the same fundamental ({{math|''x, y''}}) plane and primary ({{math|''x''}}-axis) direction. Each coordinate system is named after its choice of fundamental plane.

== Coordinate systems ==
The following table lists the common coordinate systems in use by the astronomical community. The [[Fundamental plane (spherical coordinates)|fundamental plane]] divides the [[celestial sphere]] into two equal [[Celestial sphere|hemispheres]] and defines the baseline for the latitudinal coordinates, similar to the [[equator]] in the [[geographic coordinate system]]. The poles are located at ±90° from the fundamental plane. The primary direction is the starting point of the longitudinal coordinates. The origin is the zero distance point, the "center of the celestial sphere", although the definition of [[celestial sphere]] is ambiguous about the definition of its center point.

===Horizontal system===
{{Main|Horizontal coordinate system}}
The ''horizontal'', or [[Horizontal coordinate system|altitude-azimuth]], system is based on the position of the observer on Earth, which revolves around its own axis once per [[sidereal day]] (23 hours, 56 minutes and 4.091 seconds) in relation to the star background. The positioning of a celestial object by the horizontal system varies with time, but is a useful coordinate system for locating and tracking objects for observers on Earth.  It is based on the position of stars relative to an observer's ideal horizon.

===Equatorial system===
{{Main|Equatorial coordinate system}}
The ''equatorial'' coordinate system is centered at Earth's center, but fixed relative to the celestial poles and the [[Equinox (celestial coordinates)|vernal equinox]]. The coordinates are based on the location of stars relative to Earth's equator if it were projected out to an infinite distance.  The equatorial describes the sky as seen from the solar system, and modern star maps almost exclusively use equatorial coordinates.

The ''equatorial'' system is the normal coordinate system for most professional and many amateur astronomers having an equatorial mount that follows the movement of the sky during the night. Celestial objects are found by adjusting the telescope's or other instrument's scales so that they match the equatorial coordinates of the selected object to observe.

Popular choices of pole and equator are the older [[B1950]] and the modern [[J2000]] systems, but a pole and equator "of date" can also be used, meaning one appropriate to the date under consideration, such as when a measurement of the position of a planet or spacecraft is made. There are also subdivisions into "mean of date" coordinates, which average out or ignore [[astronomical nutation|nutation]], and "true of date," which include nutation.

===Ecliptic system===
{{Main|Ecliptic coordinate system}}
The fundamental plane is the plane of the Earth's orbit, called the ecliptic plane.  There are two principal variants of the ecliptic coordinate system: geocentric ecliptic coordinates centered on the Earth and heliocentric ecliptic coordinates centered on the center of mass of the solar system.

The geocentric ecliptic system was the principal coordinate system for ancient astronomy and is still useful for computing the apparent motions of the Sun, Moon, and planets.&lt;ref&gt;[[Asger Aaboe|Aaboe, Asger]]. 2001 ''Episodes from the Early History of Astronomy.'' New York: Springer-Verlag., pp. 17–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The heliocentric ecliptic system describes the planets' orbital movement around the Sun, and centers on the [[Center of mass#Barycenter in astrophysics and astronomy|barycenter]] of the solar system (i.e. very close to the center of the Sun). The system is primarily used for computing the positions of planets and other solar system bodies, as well as defining their [[orbital elements]].

===Galactic system===
{{Main|Galactic coordinate system}}
The galactic coordinate system uses the approximate plane of our galaxy as its fundamental plane.  The solar system is still the center of the coordinate system, and the zero point is defined as the direction towards the galactic center. Galactic latitude resembles the elevation above the galactic plane and galactic longitude determines direction relative to the center of the galaxy.

===Supergalactic system===
{{Main|Supergalactic coordinate system}}
The supergalactic coordinate system corresponds to a fundamental plane that contains a higher than average number of local galaxies in the sky as seen from Earth.

  \tan\left(A\right) &amp;= {\sin\left(h\right) \over \cos\left(h\right) \sin\left(\phi_\text{o}\right) - \tan\left(\delta\right) \cos\left(\phi_\text{o}\right)}; \qquad \begin{cases}
    \cos\left(a\right) \sin\left(A\right) = \cos\left(\delta\right) \sin\left(h\right) ;\\
    \cos\left(a\right) \cos\left(A\right) = \cos\left(\delta\right) \cos\left(h\right) \sin\left(\phi_\text{o}\right) - \sin\left(\delta\right) \cos\left(\phi_\text{o}\right)

\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In solving the {{math|tan(''A'')}} equation for {{math|''A''}}, in order to avoid the ambiguity of the [[arctangent]], use of the [[atan2|two-argument arctangent]], denoted {{math|arctan(''x'',''y'')}}, is recommended. The two-argument arctangent computes the arctangent of {{math|{{sfrac|''y''|''x''}}}}, and accounts for the quadrant in which it is being computed. Thus, consistent with the convention of azimuth being measured from the south and opening positive to the west,
:&lt;math&gt;A = -\arctan(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;,

where
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  x &amp;= -\sin\left(\phi_\text{o}\right) \cos\left(\delta\right) \cos\left(h\right) + \cos\left(\phi_\text{o}\right) \sin\left(\delta\right) \\
  y &amp;=  \cos\left(\delta\right) \sin\left(h\right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;.

If the above formula produces a negative value for {{math|''A''}}, it can be rendered positive by simply adding 360°.

    \cos\left(\delta\right)\cos\left(h\right) \\
    \cos\left(\delta\right)\sin\left(h\right) \\
    \sin\left(\delta\right)
  \end{bmatrix} \\
                          &amp;= \begin{bmatrix}
    \sin\left(\phi_\text{o}\right) &amp; 0 &amp; -\cos\left(\phi_\text{o}\right) \\
    0                              &amp; 1 &amp;  0                              \\

  \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
    \cos\left(\delta\right)\cos\left(\alpha\right) \\
    \cos\left(\delta\right)\sin\left(\alpha\right) \\

       \tan\left(h\right) &amp;= {\sin\left(A\right) \over \cos\left(A\right) \sin\left(\phi_\text{o}\right) + \tan\left(a\right) \cos\left(\phi_\text{o}\right)}; \qquad \begin{cases}
    \cos\left(\delta\right) \sin\left(h\right) = \cos\left(a\right) \sin\left(A\right); \\
    \cos\left(\delta\right) \cos\left(h\right) = \sin\left(a\right) \cos\left(\phi_\text{o}\right) + \cos\left(a\right) \cos\left(A\right) \sin\left(\phi_\text{o}\right)
  \end{cases} \\[3pt]

\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Depending on the azimuth convention in use, the signs of {{math|cos ''A''}} and {{math|sin ''A''}} appear in all four different combinations. Karttunen et al., Taff and Roth define {{math|''A''}} clockwise from the south. Lang defines it north through east, Smart north through west. Meeus (1991), p.&amp;nbsp;89: {{math|sin ''δ'' {{=}} sin ''φ'' sin ''a'' − cos ''φ'' cos ''a'' cos ''A''}}; ''Explanatory Supplement'' (1961), p.&amp;nbsp;26: {{math|sin ''δ'' {{=}} sin ''a'' sin ''φ'' + cos ''a'' cos ''A'' cos ''φ''}}. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

Again, in solving the {{math|tan(''h'')}} equation for {{math|''h''}}, use of the two-argument arctangent that accounts for the quadrant is recommended. Thus, again consistent with the convention of azimuth being measured from the south and opening positive to the west,
: &lt;math&gt;h = \arctan(x, y)&lt;/math&gt;,

where
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
              x &amp;= \sin\left(\phi_\text{o}\right)\cos\left(a\right) \cos\left(A\right) + \cos\left(\phi_\text{o}\right)\sin\left(a\right) \\
              y &amp;= \cos\left(a\right)\sin\left(A\right) \\[3pt]

=== Equatorial ↔ galactic ===
These equations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.2945.pdf|title=Transformation of the equatorial proper motion to the Galactic system|last=Poleski|first=Radosław|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; are for converting equatorial coordinates to Galactic coordinates.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \sin\left(l - l_\text{NCP}\right)\cos(b) &amp;= \sin\left(\delta\right) \cos\left(\delta_\text{G}\right) - \cos\left(\delta\right)\sin\left(\delta_\text{G}\right)\cos\left(\alpha - \alpha_\text{G}\right) \\
  \cos\left(l - l_\text{NCP}\right)\cos(b) &amp;= \cos(\delta)\sin\left(\alpha - \alpha_\text{G}\right) \\
                        \sin\left(b\right) &amp;= \sin\left(\delta\right) \sin\left(\delta_\text{G}\right) + \cos\left(\delta\right) \cos\left(\delta_\text{G}\right) \cos\left(\alpha - \alpha_\text{G}\right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\alpha_\text{G}, \delta_\text{G}&lt;/math&gt; are the equatorial coordinates of the North Galactic Pole and &lt;math&gt;l_\text{NCP}&lt;/math&gt; is the Galactic longitude of the North Celestial Pole. Referred to [[Epoch (astronomy)|J2000.0]] the values of these quantities are:
: &lt;math&gt;\alpha_G = 192.85948^\circ \qquad \delta_G = 27.12825^\circ \qquad l_\text{NCP}=122.93192^\circ&lt;/math&gt;

If the equatorial coordinates are referred to another [[Equinox (celestial coordinates)|equinox]], they must be [[Axial precession|precessed]] to their place at J2000.0 before applying these formulae.

These equations convert to equatorial coordinates referred to [[Epoch (astronomy)|B2000.0]].

  \sin\left(\alpha - \alpha_\text{G}\right)\cos\left(\delta\right) &amp;= \cos\left(b\right) \cos\left(l - l_\text{NCP}\right) \\
  \cos\left(\alpha - \alpha_\text{G}\right)\cos\left(\delta\right) &amp;= \sin\left(b\right) \cos\left(\delta_\text{G}\right) - \cos\left(b\right) \sin\left(\delta_\text{G}\right)\sin\left(l - l_\text{NCP}\right) \\

=== Notes on conversion ===

* Angles in the degrees ( ° ), minutes ( ′ ), and seconds ( ″ ) of [[Minute of arc|sexagesimal measure]] must be converted to decimal before calculations are performed. Whether they are converted to decimal [[Degree (angle)|degrees]] or [[radian]]s depends upon the particular calculating machine or program. Negative angles must be carefully handled; {{nowrap|–10° 20′ 30″}} must be converted as {{nowrap|−10° −20′ −30″}}.
* Angles in the hours ( &lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt; ), minutes ( &lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; ), and seconds ( &lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt; ) of time measure must be converted to decimal [[Degree (angle)|degrees]] or [[radian]]s before calculations are performed. 1&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;15°; 1&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;15′; 1&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;15″
* Angles greater than 360° (2{{pi}}) or less than 0° may need to be reduced to the range 0°−360° (0−2{{pi}}) depending upon the particular calculating machine or program.
* The cosine of a latitude (declination, ecliptic and Galactic latitude, and altitude) are always positive by definition, since the latitude varies between −90° and +90°.
* [[Inverse trigonometric functions]] arcsine, arccosine and arctangent are [[quadrant (plane geometry)|quadrant]]-ambiguous, and results should be carefully evaluated. Use of  the [[Atan2|second arctangent function]] (denoted in computing as &lt;tt&gt;atn2(''y'',''x'')&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;atan2(''y'',''x'')&lt;/tt&gt;, which calculates the arctangent of {{math|{{sfrac|''y''|''x''}}}} using the sign of both arguments to determine the right quadrant) is recommended when calculating longitude/right ascension/azimuth. An equation which finds the [[Trigonometric functions|sine]], followed by the [[Inverse trigonometric functions|arcsin function]], is recommended when calculating latitude/declination/altitude.
* Azimuth ({{math|''A''}}) is referred here to the south point of the [[horizon]], the common astronomical reckoning. An object on the [[Meridian (astronomy)|meridian]] to the south of the observer has {{math|''A''}} = {{math|''h''}} = 0° with this usage. However, n [[Astropy]]'s AltAz, in the [[Large Binocular Telescope]] FITS file convention, and in [[XEphem]] for example, the azimuth is East of North.  In [[navigation]] and some other disciplines, azimuth is figured from the north.
* The equations for altitude ({{math|''a''}}) do not account for [[atmospheric refraction]].
* The equations for horizontal coordinates do not account for [[diurnal parallax]], that is, the small offset in the position of a celestial object caused by the position of the observer on the [[Earth]]'s surface. This effect is significant for the [[Moon]], less so for the [[planet]]s, minute for [[star]]s or more distant objects.
* Observer's longitude ({{math|''λ''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;}}) here is measured positively westward from the [[prime meridian]]; this is contrary to current [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] standards.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3899">'''Charles H. Smith''' (born September 30, 1950) is Professor of Library Public Services and Science Librarian at [[Western Kentucky University]] (WKU).  He is best known for his work as a historian/philosopher and bibliographer of science, especially for his expertise on the career of [[Alfred Russel Wallace]].

Smith was born in [[Winsted, Connecticut]], and grew up in the nearby town of [[New Hartford, Connecticut|New Hartford]]. Since his undergraduate college years he has lived in Georgia, Connecticut, Indiana, Illinois, Australia, Pennsylvania, and, from 1995, Bowling Green, Kentucky.

He created and maintains the website ''The Alfred Russel Wallace Page'' hosted by WKU and devoted to Wallace scholarship, which includes a comprehensive bibliography of Wallace's publications and interviews, texts of many of Wallace's works, and writings on Wallace by Smith and others. Smith has also produced a number of conventional writings on Wallace including the anthology ''Alfred Russel Wallace: An Anthology of His Shorter Writings'' published in 1991, a three-volume collection ''Alfred Russel Wallace: Writings on Evolution, 1843–1912'' published in 2004, an edited collection of writings ''Natural Selection and Beyond: The Intellectual Legacy of Alfred Russel Wallace'' published in 2008, ''Alfred Russel Wallace's 1886–1887 Travel Diary: The North American Lecture Tour'' published in 2013, ''Enquête sur un Aventurier de l'Esprit: Le Véritable Alfred Russel Wallace'' (translated by Antoine Guillemain) published in 2013, ''Dear Sir: Sixty-Nine Years of Alfred Russel Wallace Letters to the Editor'' published in 2014, and about three dozen journal articles.

Smith was originally trained as a [[biogeography|biogeographer]] and has produced written work in that and cognate fields, including the bibliographic compilation ''Biodiversity Studies: A Bibliographic Review'' published in 2000, and journal-based philosophical, historical and empirical studies; he additionally hosts several related websites. He has also created and maintains three well known sites on music education hosted by WKU: ''The 111  Greatest Acts of the Anglo-American Folk Music Tradition'', ''The Classical Music Navigator'', and ''[[Malvina Reynolds]]: Song Lyrics and Poems''.

In April 2013 Smith was a recipient of the national President's Call to Service Award, given to individuals who over their lifetime have volunteered at least 4000 hours of their time to public service, for his "website development for global awareness and education."

Smith received a B.A. (1972) in Geology, [[Wesleyan University]], [[Middletown, Connecticut]]; M.A. (1980), in Geography, [[Indiana University]]; Ph.D. (1984), in Geography (emphasis: Biogeography; minor: History &amp; Philosophy of Science), [[University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana]]; M.L.S. (1995), [[University of Pittsburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chorography''' (from [[wikt:χῶρος|χῶρος]] ''khōros'', "place" and [[wikt:γράφω|γράφειν]] ''graphein'', "to write") is the art of describing or mapping a region or district,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Chorography|volume=6|page=270}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by extension such a description or map.&lt;ref name=Merriam-Webster&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/chorography Merriam-Webster]&lt;/ref&gt; This term derives from the writings of the ancient geographer [[Pomponius Mela]] and  [[Ptolemy]], where it meant the geographical description of regions. However, its resonances of meaning have varied at different times. Richard Helgerson states that "chorography defines itself by opposition to [[chronicle]]. It is the genre devoted to place, and chronicle is the genre devoted to time".&lt;ref&gt;Helgerson 1992, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Darrell Rohl prefers a broad definition of "the representation of space or place".&lt;ref&gt;Rohl 2011, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ptolemy 16century.jpg|thumb|Ptolemy as imagined by a 16th-century artist]]

==Ptolemy's definition==
In his text of the ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'' (2nd century CE), Ptolemy defined [[geography]] as the study of the entire world, but chorography as the study of its smaller parts—provinces, regions, cities, or ports. Its goal was "an impression of a part, as when one makes an image of just an ear or an eye"; and it dealt with "the qualities rather than the quantities of the things that it sets down". Ptolemy implied that it was a ''graphic'' technique, comprising the making of views (not simply maps), since he claimed that it required the skills of a draftsman or landscape artist, rather than the more technical skills of recording "proportional placements". Ptolemy's most recent English translators, however, render the term as "regional cartography".&lt;ref&gt;J.L. Berggren and Alexander Jones (eds), ''Ptolemy's Geography'' (Princeton, 2000), pp. 57-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renaissance revival==
Ptolemy's text was rediscovered in the west at the beginning of the fifteenth century, and the term "chorography" was revived by [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] scholars.&lt;ref&gt;See Lucia Nuti, 'Mapping Places: Chorography and Vision in the Renaissance', in Denis Cosgrove (ed.), ''Mappings'' (London, 1999), pp. 90-108.&lt;/ref&gt; An early instance is a small-scale map of [[Great Britain|Britain]] in an early fifteenth-century manuscript, which is labelled a ''tabula chorographica''.&lt;ref&gt;British Library Harleian MS 1808, fol. 9v; reproduced in Catherine Delano-Smith and R.J.P Kain, ''English Maps: a History'' (London, 1999), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Dee]] in 1570 regarded the practice as "an underling, and a twig of ''Geographie''", by which the "plat" [plan or drawing] of a particular place would be exhibited to the eye.&lt;ref&gt;John Dee, 'Mathematicall Praeface', in Euclid, ''The Elements of Geometrie'', trans. H. Billingsley (London, 1570), sig. A4r.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William Camden by Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger.jpg|thumb|left|upright|William Camden]]
The term also came to be used, however, for ''written'' descriptions of regions.  These regions were extensively visited by the writer, who then combined local topographical description, summaries of the historical sources, and local knowledge and stories, into a text. The most influential example (at least in Britain) was probably [[William Camden]]'s ''Britannia'' (first edition 1586), which described itself on its title page as a ''Chorographica descriptio''. [[William Harrison (priest)|William Harrison]] in 1587 similarly described his own "Description of Britaine" as an exercise in chorography, distinguishing it from the historical/chronological text of Holinshed's [[Holinshed's Chronicles|''Chronicles'']] (to which the "Description" formed an introductory section).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William |last=Harrison |authorlink=William Harrison (priest) |chapter=An Historicall Description of the Iland of Britaine |editor-first=Raphael |editor-last=Holinshed |editor-link=Raphael Holinshed |title=The First and Second Volumes of Chronicles |edition=2nd |place=London |year=1587 |page=sig. [A2]v |url=http://english.nsms.ox.ac.uk/holinshed/texts.php?text1=1587_0002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Heylin]] in 1652 defined chorography as "the exact description of some Kingdom, Countrey, or particular Province of the same", and gave as examples [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]'s ''Description of Greece'' (2nd century AD); Camden's ''Britannia'' (1586); [[Lodovico Guicciardini]]'s ''Descrittione di  tutti i Paesi Bassi'' (1567) (on the [[Low Countries]]); and [[Leandro Alberti]]'s ''Descrizione d'Italia'' (1550).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Peter |last=Heylyn |authorlink=Peter Heylin |title=Cosmographie |location=London |year=1652 |page=27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Camden's ''Britannia'' was predominantly concerned with the history and antiquities of Britain, and, probably as a result, the term chorography in English came to be particularly associated with [[antiquarian]] texts. [[William Lambarde]], [[John Stow]], [[John Hooker (English constitutionalist)|John Hooker]], [[Michael Drayton]], [[Tristram Risdon]], [[John Aubrey]] and many others used it in this way, arising from a gentlemanly [[topophilia]] and a sense of service to one's county or city, until it was eventually often applied to the genre of [[English county histories|county history]]. A late example was William Grey's ''Chorographia'' (1649), a survey of the antiquities of the city of [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. Even before Camden's work appeared, [[Andrew Melville]] in 1574 had referred to chorography and [[chronology]] as the "twa lights" [two lights] of [[history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=G. R. |editor-last=Kinloch |editor-link=George Ritchie Kinloch |title=The Diary of Mr James Melvill, 1556–1601 |publisher=Bannatyne Club |location=Edinburgh |year=1829 |pages=38–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Saxton pamberforest.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Example of [[Christopher Saxton]]'s cartography]]
However, the term also continued to be used for maps and map-making, particularly of sub-national or [[Counties of England|county]] areas. William Camden praised the county mapmakers [[Christopher Saxton]] and [[John Norden]] as "most skilfull Chorographers";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William |last=Camden |translator-first=Philemon |translator-last=Holland |translator-link=Philemon Holland |title=Britain, or a Chorographicall Description of the most flourishing Kingdomes, England, Scotland, and Ireland, and the Ilands adjoyning, out of the depth of Antiquitie |chapter=The Author to the Reader |place=London |year=1610 |page=sig. [*5]v |url=http://www.philological.bham.ac.uk/cambrit/fronteng.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Robert Plot]] in 1677&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Plot |authorlink=Robert Plot |title=The Natural History of Oxford-shire |location=Oxford |year=1677 |page=299 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Christopher Packe (physician and cartographer)|Christopher Packe]] in 1743&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Christopher |last=Packe |authorlink=Christopher Packe (physician and cartographer) |title=A New Philosophico-Chorographical Chart of East-Kent |location=[Canterbury] |year=1743 }}&lt;/ref&gt; both referred to their county maps as chorographies.

By the beginning of the eighteenth century the term had largely fallen out of use in all these contexts, being superseded for most purposes by either "[[topography]]" or "[[cartography]]". [[Samuel Johnson]] in his ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language|Dictionary]]'' (1755) made a distinction between geography, chorography and topography, arguing that geography dealt with large areas, topography with small areas, but chorography with intermediary areas, being "less in its object than geography, and greater than topography".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Samuel |last=Johnson |authorlink=Samuel Johnson |title=A Dictionary of the English Language |location=London |year=1755 |chapter=chorography |page=373 |url=https://johnsonsdictionaryonline.com/page-view/?i=373 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, however, the term is only rarely found in English by this date.

[[File:Ferdinand von Richthofen.jpg|thumb|upright|Ferdinand von Richthofen]]

==Modern usages==
In more technical geographical literature, the term had been abandoned as city views and [[city map]]s became more and more sophisticated and demanded a set of skills that required not only skilled draftsmanship but also some knowledge of scientific [[surveying]]. However, its use was revived for a second time in the late nineteenth century by the geographer [[Ferdinand von Richthofen]]. He regarded chorography as a specialization within geography, comprising the description through field observation of the particular traits of a given area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.valpo.edu/geomet/geo/courses/geo466/topics/germany.html GEO 466/566: The Profession of Geography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211150811/http://www.valpo.edu/geomet/geo/courses/geo466/topics/germany.html |date=2012-02-11 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also now widely used by historians and literary scholars to refer to the [[Early modern period|early modern]] genre of topographical and antiquarian literature.&lt;ref&gt;Particularly influential in reviving the term has been Helgerson 1992, esp. pp. 105-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Csepel Island''' (Hungarian: ''Csepel-sziget'') {{IPAc-en|'|tʃ|ei|p|əl}} is the largest island on the [[Danube River]] in [[Hungary]]. It is [[1 E4 m|48 km]] long; its width after 3&amp;ndash;km sections of [[river bifurcation|bifurcation]] and rejoining ([[confluence]]) is 6–8 km. Its area comprises [[1 E8 m²|257 km²]] and its population is 165,000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11837760_Speciation_of_beryllium_nickel_and_vanadium_in_soil_samples_from_Csepel_Island_Hungary_Fresenius_Journal_of_Analytical_Chemistry_370_768-775 Speciation of beryllium, nickel, and vanadium in soil samples from Csepel Island, Hungary. Fresenius Journal of Analytical Chemistry, 370, 768-775]&lt;/ref&gt;

The isle extends south from [[Budapest]]; its northern point or section is [[Csepel]] &amp;ndash; Budapest's District XXI. Most of the island is accessible from Budapest by [[HÉV|the suburban railway]]. Notable towns include [[Ráckeve]], [[Szigetszentmiklós]], [[Szigethalom]] and [[Tököl]].
Csepel island was the first centre of the [[Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin]] ({{lang-hu|honfoglalás}}: "conquest of the homeland"), being the early homestead of [[Árpád]]'s tribe.  The island is named after Árpád's [[Groom (horses)|horse groom]], Csepel.

It features Hungary's tallest structure, [[Lakihegy Tower]], a {{convert|314|m}} radio mast used today intermittently for power network control purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baaa-acro.com/1929/archives/crash-of-a-fokker-f3-in-hungary-2-killed/ Crash of a Fokker F3 in Csepel Island: 2 killed]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cLY1z-XLd_IC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;lpg=PA109&amp;dq=csepel+island&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=51aK3rDRn8&amp;sig=VMLuOSnf9jB8JEgdXxc4NyFkICA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwji9MOI8fXKAhUiJJoKHao0B9w4HhDoAQhEMAY#v=onepage&amp;q=csepel%20island&amp;f=false The Battle for Budapest]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1913">'''Deadheading''' is the [[horticultural]] practice of removing spent [[flowers]] from [[ornamental plants]]. 

Deadheading is a widespread form of [[pruning]],&lt;ref name="Bob"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Bob |last=Flowerdew|author-link=Bob Flowerdew|title=Pruning, Training, and Tidying: Bob's Basics|volume=|publisher=	Skyhorse Publishing, Inc|year=2012|isbn=1620872668|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; since fading flowers are not as appealing and direct a lot of energy into [[seed development]] if pollinated.&lt;ref name="rhs"/&gt; The goal of deadheading is thus to preserve the attraction of the plants in [[bedding (horticulture)|beds]], [[herbaceous border|borders]], [[container garden|containers]] and [[hanging baskets]], as well as to encourage further blooming. Deadheading flowers with many petals, such as [[rose]]s, [[peonies]], and [[camellia]]s prevents them from littering. Deadheading can be done with finger and thumb or with [[pruning shears]], knife, or scissors.&lt;ref name="rhs"&gt;{{cite web|title=Deadheading plants|url=https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?PID=129|publisher=Royal Horticultural Society|year=|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ornamental plants that do not require deadheading are those that do not produce a lot of seed or tend to deadhead themselves. These include [[lobelia]]s, [[salvia]]s, and [[fuchsia]]s. Deadheading is undesirable if the plant's seed is [[wildlife garden|enjoyed by birds]], as is the case with many species from the [[sunflower family]]. Likewise, if the plant bears attractive seeds or fruits, deadheading is normally avoided.&lt;ref name="rhs"/&gt;

'''Drygalski Basin''' ({{coord|74|50|S|166|30|E|source:GNIS|display=inline,title}}) is an undersea basin named as such by the [[Advisory Committee for Undersea Features]] (ACUF) in April 1980, in association with [[Drygalski Ice Tongue]]. The name was changed to "Von Drygalski" in November 1995, in agreement with the [[General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans]] Sub-Committee on Undersea Feature Names, but was changed back to Drygalski Basin by ACUF in June 2003.&lt;ref name=gnis/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7429">'''Erle Christopher Ellis''' (born 11 March 1963 in Washington, DC) is an [[United States of America|American]] environmental scientist. Ellis's work investigates the causes and consequences of long-term ecological changes caused by humans at local to global scales, including those related to the [[Anthropocene]]. As of 2016 he is a professor of Geography and Environmental Systems at the [[University of Maryland, Baltimore County]] where he directs the Laboratory for Anthropogenic Landscape Ecology.

==Education and Career==
Ellis received an A.B. in Biology in 1986 and a Ph.D. in Plant Biology from [[Cornell University]] in 1990. After receiving his Ph.D., Ellis taught English at [[Nanjing Agricultural University]] in 1990/1991, and returned to China to study nitrogen cycling in China's village landscapes from 1993-1996.&lt;ref name=touch/&gt;&lt;ref name=trad&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ellis|first1=Erle|last2=Wang|first2=Si Ming|title=Sustainable traditional agriculture in the Tai Lake Region of China|journal=Agriculture, Ecosystems &amp; Environment|date=1997|volume=61|pages=177-193|doi=10.1016/S0167-8809(96)01099-7|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0167-8809(96)01099-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1996 to 2000, he worked with Stephen Gliessman at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]].  
In 2000 he was hired as an assistant professor in the department of Geography and Environmental Systems of the [[University of Maryland, Baltimore County]]; he was promoted to professor in 2015.
He is a fellow of the [[Global Land Project|Global Land Programme]] (Scientific Steering Committee 2012-2017) of [[Future Earth]] and the [http://quaternary.stratigraphy.org/working-groups/anthropocene/ Anthropocene Working Group] of the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]] and a Senior Fellow at the [[Breakthrough Institute]]. He has taught ecology as a visiting professor at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]] (2013-2015) and was a visiting professor at the [[Carnegie Institution|Carnegie Institution's Department of Global Ecology]] (2006/2007).

'''International''' mostly means something (a [[company]], [[language]], or [[organization]]) involving more than a single [[country]]. The term international as a word means involvement of, interaction between or encompassing more than one nation, or generally beyond national boundaries. For example, [[international law]], which is applied by more than one [[country]] and usually everywhere on [[Earth]], and [[world language|international language]] which is a language spoken by residents of more than one country.

== Origin of the word==
The term ''international'' was coined by the [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] [[philosopher]] [[Jeremy Bentham]] in his ''[[Introduction to Principles of Morals and Legislation]]'', which was printed for publication in 1780 and published in 1789.  Bentham wrote: "The word ''international'', it must be acknowledged, is a new one; though, it is hoped, sufficiently analogous and intelligible.  It is calculated to express, in a more significant way, the branch of law which goes commonly under the name of the ''[[Public international law|law of nations]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The word was adopted in French in 1801.&lt;ref&gt;''Le Nouveau Petit Robert 2010''.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Thomas Erskine Holland]] noted in his article on Bentham in the 11th edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' that "Many of Bentham's phrases, such as 'international,' 'utilitarian,' 'codification,' are valuable additions to our language; but the majority of them, especially those of Greek derivation, have taken no root in it."

== Meaning in particular fields ==
*In [[team sports]], "international" is a [[game|match]] between two [[national team]]s, or two players [[cap (sport)|capped]] by a national team.
*In [[politics]], "The International" may refer to a [[political international]].
*In [[law]], "international" may refer to several disciplines of [[International law]] like [[public international law]], [[international criminal law]] etc.
*In linguistics, an international language is one spoken by the people of more than one nation, usually by many. Also called [[world language]]. [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] are considered to be world languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allcountries.org/maps/world_language_maps.html Language Map]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[interlinguistics]], international often has to do with languages rather than nations themselves. An "international word" is one that occurs in more than one language. These words are collected from widely spoken source or control languages, and often used to establish language systems that people can use to communicate internationally, and sometimes for other purposes such as to learn other languages more quickly. The vocabulary of [[Interlingua and eligibility of international words|Interlingua]] has a particularly wide range, because the [[Interlingua and eligibility of international words|control languages]] of Interlingua were selected to give its words and affixes their maximum geographic scope.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Gode|Gode, Alexander]], ''[[Interlingua: A Grammar of the International Language]].'' New York: Frederick Ungar, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; In part, the language [[Ido (language)|Ido]] is also a product of interlinguistic research.

'''Joshua Slocum''' (February 20, 1844&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Short History of the Slocums, Slocumbs and Slocombs of America|last=Slocum|first=Charles Elihu|publisher=Charles Elihu Slocum|year=1882|volume=1|location=Syracuse, NY|pages=542, 551|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; – on or shortly after November 14, 1909) was the first man to [[Sailing|sail]] single-handedly around the world. He was a [[Nova Scotia]]n-born, [[naturalised]] American seaman and adventurer, and a noted writer. In 1900 he wrote a book about his journey; ''[[Sailing Alone Around the World]]'', which became an international best-seller. He [[Unexplained disappearances|disappeared]] in November 1909 while aboard his boat, the ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]''.

==Nova Scotian childhood==
Joshua Slocum was born on February 20, 1844&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; in [[Mount Hanley]], [[Annapolis County, Nova Scotia]] (officially recorded as Wilmot Station),&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; a community on the [[North Mountain (Nova Scotia)|North Mountain]] within sight of the [[Bay of Fundy]]. The fifth of eleven children of John Slocombe&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wolff&gt;Geoffrey Wolff, ''The Hard Way Around: The Passages of Joshua Slocum'', p 8: spelling of family name given as "Slocombe".&lt;/ref&gt; and Sarah Jane Slocombe ''née'' Southern,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Joshua descended, on his father's side, from a [[Quaker]], known as "John the Exile" who left the United States shortly after 1780 because of his opposition to the [[American War for Independence]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Wolff, ''The Hard Way Around: The Passages of Joshua Slocum'', p 11&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] migration to Nova Scotia, the Slocombes were granted {{convert|500|acre|km2}} of farmland in [[Annapolis County, Nova Scotia|Nova Scotia's Annapolis County]].
[[Image:Mt. Hanley Sch.JPG|thumb|left|Slocum's childhood school, now the [[Mount Hanley Schoolhouse Museum]]]]
Joshua Slocum was born in the family's farm house in [[Mount Hanley, Nova Scotia|Mount Hanley]] and learned to read and write at the nearby [[Mount Hanley Schoolhouse Museum|Mount Hanley School]]. His earliest ventures on the water were made on coastal schooners operating out of the small ports such as Port George and Cottage Cove near Mount Hanley along the [[Bay of Fundy]].

When Joshua was eight years old, the Slocombe family moved from Mount Hanley to [[Brier Island]] in [[Digby County]], at the mouth of the Bay of Fundy. Slocum's maternal grandfather was the keeper of the [[lighthouse]] at Southwest Point there. His father, a stern man and strict disciplinarian, took up making leather boots for the local fishermen, and Joshua helped in the shop. However, the boy found the scent of salt air much more alluring than the smell of shoe leather. He yearned for a life of adventure at sea, away from his demanding father and his increasingly chaotic life at home among so many brothers and sisters.

He made several attempts to run away from home, finally succeeding, at age fourteen, by hiring on as a [[cabin boy]] and cook on a fishing [[schooner]], but he soon returned home. In 1860, after the birth of the eleventh Slocombe (Joshua changed the spelling of his last name later in his life)&lt;ref name="GeoffreyWolff"&gt;Geoffrey Wolff, ''The Hard Way Around: The Passages of Joshua Slocum'')&lt;/ref&gt; child and the subsequent death of his kindly mother, Joshua, then sixteen, left home for good. He and a friend signed on at [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] as ordinary seamen on a merchant ship bound for [[Dublin]], Ireland.

==Early life at sea==
From Dublin, he crossed to [[Liverpool]] to become an ordinary seaman on the British [[merchant ship]] ''Tangier'' (also recorded as ''Tanjore''), bound for China. During two years as a seaman, he rounded [[Cape Horn]] twice, landed at [[Jakarta|Batavia]] (now Jakarta) in the [[Dutch East Indies]], and visited the [[Maluku Islands]], [[Manila]], Hong Kong, [[Saigon]], Singapore, and San Francisco. While at sea, he studied for the [[Board of Trade]] examination, and, at the age of eighteen, he received his certificate as a fully qualified [[Second Mate]]. Slocum quickly rose through the ranks to become a [[Chief Mate]] on British ships transporting coal and grain between the British Isles and San Francisco.

In 1865, he settled in San Francisco, became an American citizen, and, after a period of [[salmon]] fishing and [[fur trading]] in the [[Oregon Territory]] of the northwest, he returned to the sea to pilot a schooner in the coastal trade between San Francisco and [[Seattle]]. His first blue-water command, in 1869, was the [[barque]] ''Washington'', which he took across the Pacific, from San Francisco to Australia, and home via [[Alaska]].

He sailed for thirteen years out of the port of San Francisco, transporting mixed cargo to China, Australia, the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]], and Japan. Between 1869 and 1889, he was the master of eight vessels, the first four of which (the ''Washington'', the ''Constitution'', the ''Benjamin Aymar'' and the ''Amethyst'') he commanded in the employ of others. Later, there would be four others that he himself owned, in whole or in part.

==Family at sea==
Shortly before Christmas 1870, Slocum and the ''Washington'' put in at Sydney. There, in about a month's time, he met, courted, and married a young woman named Virginia Albertina Walker. Their marriage took place on January 31, 1871. Miss Walker, quite coincidentally, was an American whose New York family had migrated west to California at the time of the [[California gold rush|1849 gold rush]] and eventually continued on, by ship, to settle in Australia. She sailed with Slocum, and, over the next thirteen years, the couple had seven children, all born at sea or foreign ports. Four children, sons Victor, Benjamin Aymar, and Garfield, and daughter Jessie, survived to adulthood.

In Alaska, the ''Washington'' was [[shipwreck|wrecked]] when she dragged her anchor during a gale, ran ashore, and broke up. Slocum, however, at considerable risk to himself, managed to save his wife, the crew, and much of the cargo, bringing all back to port safely in the ship's open boats. The owners of the shipping company that had employed Slocum were so impressed by this feat of ingenuity and leadership, they gave him the command of the ''Constitution'' which he sailed to Hawaii and the west coast of [[Mexico]].

His next command was the ''Benjamin Aymar'', a merchant vessel in the [[Pacific Ocean|South Seas]] trade. However, the owner, strapped for cash, sold the vessel out from under Slocum, and he and Virginia found themselves stranded in the [[Philippines]] without a ship.

=== The ''Pato'' ===
While in the Philippines, in 1874, under a commission from a British architect, Slocum organized native workers to build a 150-ton [[Steamboat|steamer]] in the shipyard at [[Subic Bay]]. In partial payment for the work, he was given the ninety-ton schooner, ''Pato'' (Spanish for "Duck"), the first ship he could call his own.

Ownership of the ''Pato'' afforded Slocum the kind of freedom and autonomy he had never experienced before. Hiring a crew, he contracted to deliver a cargo to [[Vancouver]] in British Columbia. Thereafter, he used the ''Pato'' as a general freight carrier along the west coast of North America and in voyages back and forth between San Francisco and Hawaii. During this period, Slocum also fulfilled a long-held ambition to become a writer; he became a temporary correspondent for the ''San Francisco Bee''.

The Slocums sold the ''Pato'' in Honolulu in the spring of 1878. Returning to San Francisco, they purchased the ''Amethyst.'' He worked this ship until June 23, 1881.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Wolff, ''The Hard Way Around: The Passages of Joshua Slocum, pgs. 70–75''&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Slocums next bought a third share in the ''Northern Light 2''. This large clipper was 233 feet in length, 44 feet beam, 28 feet in the hold. It was capable of carrying 2000 tons on three decks. Although Joshua Slocum called this ship "my best command", it was a command plagued with mutinies and mechanical problems. Under troubling legal circumstances (caused by his alleged treatment of the chief mutineer) he sold his share in the ''Northern Light 2'' in 1883.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Wolff, ''The Hard Way Around: The Passages of Joshua Slocum, pgs. 76–111''&lt;/ref&gt;

===The ''Aquidneck''===
The Slocum family continued on their next ship, the 326-ton ''Aquidneck''.  In 1884, Slocum's wife Virginia became ill aboard the ''Aquidneck'' in [[Buenos Aires]] and died.  After sailing to Massachusetts, Slocum left his three youngest children, Benjamin Aymar, Jessie, and Garfield in the care of his sisters; his oldest son Victor continued as his first mate.&lt;ref&gt;Berthold pg xix&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886, at age 42, Slocum married his 24-year-old cousin, Henrietta "Hettie" Elliott. The Slocum family, with the exception of Jessie and Benjamin Aymar, again took to the sea aboard the ''Aquidneck'', bound for [[Montevideo]], Uruguay.  Slocum's second wife would find life at sea much less appealing than his first.  A few days into Henrietta's first voyage, the ''Aquidneck'' sailed through a hurricane.  By the end of this first year, the crew had contracted [[cholera]], and they were quarantined for six months.&lt;ref name=BertholdXX&gt;Berthold pg xx&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Slocum was forced to defend his ship from pirates, one of whom he shot and killed; he was tried and acquitted of murder.  Next, the ''Aquidneck'' was infected with [[smallpox]], leading to the death of three of the crew.  Disinfecting of the ship was performed at considerable cost. Shortly afterward, near the end of 1887, the unlucky ''Aquidneck'' was wrecked in southern Brazil.&lt;ref name=BertholdXX/&gt;&lt;ref name=VoyageLiberdade/&gt;

===The ''Liberdade''===
After being stranded in Brazil with his wife and sons Garfield and Victor, he started building a boat that could sail them home. He used local materials, salvaged materials from the ''Aquidneck'' and worked with local workers. The boat was launched on May 13, 1888, the very day slavery was [[Slavery in Brazil#Steps towards freedom#Princess Isabel|abolished in Brazil]], and therefore the ship was given the Portuguese name ''Liberdade''.
It was an unusual {{convert|35|ft|m|adj=on}} [[junk (ship)|junk]]-rigged design which he described as "half [[Cape Ann dory]] and half Japanese [[sampan]]".&lt;ref name=VoyageLiberdade&gt;Slocum (1890), ''Voyage of the Liberdade''&lt;/ref&gt; He and his family began their voyage back to the United States, his son Victor (15) being the mate.

After fifty-five days at sea and 5510 miles,&lt;ref&gt;Victor Slocum (1950), p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; the Slocums reached Cape Roman, [[South Carolina]]&lt;ref&gt;Cape Roman {{Coord|33|3|48|N|79|20|43|W|display=inline|name=Cape Roman}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued inland to Washington D.C. for winter and finally reaching Boston via New York in 1889.&lt;ref name=VoyageLiberdade/&gt; This was the last time Henrietta sailed with the family. In 1890, Slocum published the accounts of these adventures in ''Voyage of the Liberdade''.&lt;ref name=VoyageLiberdade/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berthold pg xxi–xxii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Voyage of the ''Destroyer''==
In the northern winter of 1893/94, Slocum undertook what he described as at that time being "the hardest voyage that I have ever made, without any exception at all."&lt;ref name="Eldritch Press: Voyage of the Detroyer"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Slocum|first1=Joshua|title=Voyage of the Destroyer  from  New York to Brazil|url=http://www.eldritchpress.org/js/destroyer.htm|publisher=Eldritch Press|date=1894|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involved delivering the steam-powered torpedo boat ''Destroyer'' from the east coast of the United States to Brazil.

''Destroyer'' was a ship 130 feet in length, conceived by the Swedish-American inventor and mechanical engineer [[John Ericsson]], and intended for the defence of harbours and coastal waters. Equipped in the early 1880s with sloping armour plate and a bow-mounted submarine gun it was an evolution of the [[Monitor (warship)|Monitor warship type]] of the American Civil War. ''Destroyer'' was intended to fire an early form of torpedo at an opposing ship from a range of 300 feet, and was a "vessel of war partially armored to attack bows-on at short range".&lt;ref name="Archive.org: Ericsson's Destroyer and Submarine Gun"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jaques|first1=William H.|title=Ericsson's Destroyer and Submarine Gun|url=https://archive.org/stream/ericssonsdestro00jaqugoog#page/n4/mode/2up|website=Archive.org|publisher=GP Putnam|accessdate=13 September 2016|date=1885}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the loss of the ''Aquidneck'' and the privations of his family's voyage in the self-built ''Liberdade'', Slocum retained a fondness for Brazil. During 1893, Brazil was faced with a political crisis in Rio Grande do Sul and an attempt at civil war that was intensified by the revolt of the country's navy in September.&lt;ref name="Stanford University Press: A Modern History of Brazil"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bello|first1=José Maria|title=A Modern History of Brazil: 1889-1964|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O26rAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA134|publisher=Stanford University Press|accessdate=13 September 2016|date=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slocum agreed to a request by the Brazilian government to deliver the ''Destroyer'' to Pernambuco, Brazil. His motive was also financial. As Slocum describes, his contract with the commander of government forces at Pernambuco was, "to go against the rebel fleet, and sink them all, if we could find them – big and little – for a handsome sum of gold …" In addition, Slocum saw the possibility of getting even with the "arch rebel" Admiral Melo (whom he writes as "Mello"): "Confidentially: I was burning to get a rake at Mello and his ''Aquideban''. He it was, who in that ship expelled my bark, the ''Aquidneck'', from lIha Grand some years ago, under the cowardly pretext that we might have sickness on board. But that story has been told. I was burning to let him know and palpably feel that this time I had in dynamite instead of hay".

Towed by the ''Santuit'', Slocum and a small crew aboard the ''Destroyer'' left Sandy Hook, New Jersey, on 7 December 1893. The following day the ship was already taking on water: "A calamity has overtaken us. The ship's top seams are opening and one of the new sponsons, the starboard one, is already waterlogged". Despite all hands pumping and bailing, by midnight the seas were extinguishing the fires in the boilers which were kept alight only by throwing on rounds of pork fat and tables and chairs from the vessel.

With a storm continuing to blow on the 9th, the crew was able to lower the level of water in the hold and plug some of the holes and leaks. Bailing out water using a large improvised canvas bag continued from the 9th to the 13th and succeeded in maintaining the level of water in the hold below three feet. On the 13th they were again hit by a storm and cross seas and had to bail all night. On the 14th, heavy seas disabled the rudder. By the afternoon of 15 December, the ''Destroyer'' was to the southwest of Puerto Rico, heading for Martinique, and still weathering storms.

By this time, with the fires in the boilers extinguished, all hands were bailing for their lives: "The main hull of the ''Destroyer'' is already a foot under water, and going on down". The crew had no other option than to keep bailing and try to keep the ship afloat, as the vessel "could not be insured for the voyage; nor would any company insure a life on board". By the morning of the 16th the storm had abated, allowing the ''Destroyer'' to anchor to the south of Puerto Rico.

Although the ship's best steam pump had been put out of action on 19 December, more favourable seas allowed the crew to reach Martinique, where repairs were made before again setting sail on 5 January 1894. On 18 January the ''Destroyer'' arrived at Fernando de Noronha, an island some 175 miles from the coast of Brazil, before finally reaching Recife, Pernambuco, on the 20th.

Slocum wrote: "My voyage home from Brazil in the canoe ''Liberdade'', with my family for crew and companions, some years ago, although a much longer voyage was not of the same irksome nature".

At Pernambuco, the ''Destroyer'' joined up with the Brazilian navy and the crew was again engaged in repairs as the long tow in heavy seaways had severed rivets at the bow, resulting in leaks.

Wet powder led to a failed test firing of the submarine gun and the ship was grounded to remove the projectile. But the strain of the swell led to a further leak. Following further repairs the ''Destroyer'' made for Bahia with replenishments of powder for the Brazilian fleet, arriving on 13 February. Once there, however, Admiral Goncalves of the Brazilian navy seized the ship. At the Arsenal at Bahia, an apparently incompetent alternative crew grounded the ''Destroyer'' on a rock in the basin. The vessel was holed and subsequently abandoned.

==The ''Spray'': First solo circumnavigation of the earth==
[[Image:Spray.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Spray (sailing vessel)|''Spray'']]]]
In [[Fairhaven, Massachusetts]], he rebuilt the {{convert|36|ft|9|in|abbr=on}} [[gaff rigged]] [[sloop]] oyster boat named ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]''.

On April 24, 1895, he set sail from [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. In his famous book, ''[[Sailing Alone Around the World]]'',&lt;ref name=SailingAlone&gt;Slocum (1899), ''Sailing Alone Around the World''&lt;/ref&gt; now considered a classic of [[travel literature]], he described his departure in the following manner:

:"I had resolved on a voyage around the world, and as the wind on the morning of April 24, 1895 was fair, at noon I weighed anchor, set sail, and filled away from Boston, where the ''Spray'' had been moored snugly all winter. The twelve o'clock whistles were blowing just as the sloop shot ahead under full sail. A short board was made up the harbor on the port tack, then coming about she stood to seaward, with her boom well off to port, and swung past the ferries with lively heels. A photographer on the outer pier of East Boston got a picture of her as she swept by, her flag at the peak throwing her folds clear. A thrilling pulse beat high in me. My step was light on deck in the crisp air. I felt there could be no turning back, and that I was engaging in an adventure the meaning of which I thoroughly understood."

After an extended visit to his boyhood home at [[Brier Island, Nova Scotia|Brier Island]] and visiting old haunts on the coast of Nova Scotia, Slocum departed North America at [[Sambro Island Lighthouse]] near Halifax, Nova Scotia on July 3, 1895.

Slocum intended to sail eastward around the world, using the [[Suez Canal]], but when he got to [[Gibraltar]] he realized that sailing through the southern Mediterranean would be too dangerous for a lone sailor because of the piracy that still went on there at that time. So he decided to sail westward, in the southern hemisphere. He headed to Brazil, and then the [[Straits of Magellan]]. At that point he was unable to start across the Pacific for forty days because of a storm. Eventually he made his way to Australia, sailed north along the east coast, crossed the Indian Ocean, rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]], and then headed back to North America.

Slocum navigated without a [[Marine chronometer|chronometer]], instead relying on the traditional method of [[dead reckoning]] for longitude, which required only a cheap tin clock for approximate time, and noon-sun sights for latitude. On one long passage in the Pacific, Slocum also famously shot a [[Lunar distance (navigation)|lunar distance]] observation, decades after these observations had ceased to be commonly employed, which allowed him to check his longitude independently. However, Slocum's primary method for finding longitude was still dead reckoning; he recorded only one lunar observation during the entire circumnavigation.

Slocum normally sailed the ''Spray'' without touching the helm. Due to the length of the sail plan relative to the hull, and the long keel, the ''Spray'' was capable of self-steering (unlike faster modern craft), and he balanced it stably on any course relative to the wind by adjusting or reefing the sails and by lashing the [[Steering wheel (ship)|helm]] fast. He sailed {{convert|2000|mi|km}} west across the Pacific without once touching the helm.&lt;ref name=SailingAlone/&gt;

More than three years later, on June 27, 1898, he returned to [[Newport, Rhode Island]], having [[circumnavigation|circumnavigated]] the world, a distance of more than 46,000 miles (74,000&amp;nbsp;km). Slocum's return went almost unnoticed. The [[Spanish–American War]], which had begun two months earlier, dominated the headlines. After the end of major hostilities, many American newspapers published articles describing Slocum's amazing adventure.

===''Sailing Alone Around the World''===
[[Image:Sailing-Alone-Around-the-World-cover.jpg|thumb|left|Original cover 1900.]]
[[File:Spray1901ErieCanal.jpg|thumb|right|Spray being hauled up the Erie Canal to the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo 1901.]]
In 1899 he published his account of the epic voyage in ''[[Sailing Alone Around the World]]'', first serialized in ''The Century Magazine'' and then in several book-length editions. Reviewers received the slightly anachronistic [[Age of Sail|age-of-sail]] adventure story enthusiastically. [[Arthur Ransome]] went so far as to declare, "Boys who do not like this book ought to be drowned at once."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mywire.com/a/Oxford-Companion-World-Exploration/Slocum-Joshua/9516558 Arthur Ransome on ''Sailing Alone Around the World'']&lt;/ref&gt; In his review, Sir [[Edwin Arnold]] wrote, "I do not hesitate to call it the most extraordinary book ever published."

Slocum's book deal was an integral part of his journey: his publisher had provided Slocum with an extensive on-board library, and Slocum wrote several letters to his editor from distant points around the globe.

Slocum's ''Sailing Alone'' won him widespread fame in the English-speaking world. He was one of eight invited speakers at a dinner in honor of [[Mark Twain]] in December 1900. Slocum hauled the ''Spray'' up the Erie Canal to Buffalo, New York for the [[Pan-American Exposition]] in the summer of 1901, and he was well compensated for participating in the fair.

==Later life==
In 1901, Slocum's book revenues and income from public lectures provided him enough financial security to purchase a small farm in [[West Tisbury, Massachusetts|West Tisbury]], on the island of [[Martha's Vineyard]], in Massachusetts. After a year and a half, he found he could not adapt to a settled life and Slocum sailed the ''Spray'' from port to port in the northeastern US during the summer and the [[West Indies]] during the winter, lecturing and selling books wherever he could. Slocum spent little time with his wife on the Vineyard and preferred life aboard the ''Spray'', usually wintering in the Caribbean.

Slocum's mental health deteriorated during his later years. Visiting Riverton, New Jersey in May 1906, Slocum was charged with raping a 12-year-old girl. After further investigation and questioning, it became apparent that the crime was indecent exposure, but Slocum claimed to have no memory of any wrongdoing and that, if anything had happened, it must have occurred during one of his mental lapses. Slocum spent 42 days in jail awaiting trial. At his trial he pleaded "no contest" and was released for time-served. The judge at his trial told him, "upon request of the family, I can deal leniently with you".&lt;ref name=Teller&gt;{{Cite book|author=Teller, Walter Magnes |title=Joshua Slocum |publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]] |location=New Brunswick, N.J |year=1971 |pages= |isbn=0-8135-0700-6 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few weeks after his conviction in New Jersey, Slocum and the ''Spray'' visited [[Sagamore Hill]], the estate of US President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] on the north shore of Long Island, New York. Roosevelt and his family were interested in the tales of Slocum's solo [[circumnavigation]]. The President's young son, [[Archibald Roosevelt|Archie]], along with a guardian, spent the next few days sailing with Slocum up to Newport aboard the ''Spray'', which, by then, was a decrepit, weather-worn vessel. Slocum again met with President Roosevelt in May 1907, this time at the [[White House]] in Washington. Supposedly, Roosevelt said to him, "Captain, our adventures have been a little different." Slocum answered, "That is true, Mr. President, but I see you got here first."&lt;ref name=Teller/&gt;

By 1909, Slocum's funds were running low; book revenues had tailed off. He prepared to sell his farm on Martha's Vineyard and began to make plans for a new adventure in South America.  He had hopes of another book deal.&lt;ref name=Teller/&gt;

==Disappearance==
On November 14, 1909,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.joshuaslocumsocietyintl.org/jshistory.htm|title=Joshua Slocum and His Travels|author=E.G.Consulting &amp; Computer Services. |website=www.joshuaslocumsocietyintl.org |accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slocum set sail for the West Indies on one of his usual winter voyages. He had also expressed interest in starting his next adventure, exploring the [[Orinoco River|Orinoco]], [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] and [[Amazon River]]s.&lt;ref name=SailingAlone/&gt; Slocum was never heard from again. In July 1910, his wife informed the newspapers that she believed he was lost at sea.

At the time, most who knew Slocum believed that the ''Spray'' had been run down by a steamer&lt;ref&gt;[This was the theory of [[Edward Rowe Snow]]; see [https://books.google.com/books?id=OCuUrlhaP68C&amp;pg=PT142#v=onepage&amp;q=Edward%20Rowe%20Snow%20theory%20on%20Joshua%20Slocum Ann Spencer's "Alone At Sea: The Adventures of Joshua Slocum"]&lt;/ref&gt; or struck by a whale, the ''Spray'' being too sound a craft and Slocum too experienced a mariner for any other cause to be considered likely.&lt;ref name="spencer"&gt;{{cite book |last=Spencer |first=Ann |date=1998 |title=Alone At Sea: The Adventures of Joshua Slocum |url= |location= |publisher=Doubleday Canada |page= |isbn=0385257201 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being an experienced mariner, Slocum never learned to swim&lt;ref name="spencer"/&gt; and considered learning to swim to be useless.

In 1924, Joshua Slocum was declared legally dead.&lt;ref name="spencer"/&gt;

==Legacy==

Joshua Slocum's achievements have been well publicised and honoured. The name ''Spray'' has become a choice for cruising yachts ever since the publication of Slocum's account of his [[circumnavigation]].  Over the years, many versions of ''Spray'' have been built from the plans in Slocum's book, more or less reconstructing the sloop with various degrees of success.

Similarly, the French long-distance sailor [[Bernard Moitessier]] christened his {{convert|39|ft|m|adj=on}} [[ketch]]-rigged boat ''Joshua'' in honor of Slocum. It was this boat that Moitessier sailed from Tahiti to France, and he also sailed ''Joshua'' in the 1968 [[Sunday Times Golden Globe Race]] around the world, making great time, only to abandon the race near the end and sail on to the Polynesian Islands.

Ferries named in Slocum's honour (''Joshua Slocum'' and ''Spray'') served the two [[Digby Neck]] runs in Nova Scotia between 1973 and 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valleyweb.com/westport/tsdbrier.html|title= valleyweb Resources and Information.|website=valleyweb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Joshua Slocum'' was featured in the film version of ''[[Dolores Claiborne (film)|Dolores Claiborne]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newscotland1398.net/digbyco/slocumjmem.html|title=Joshua Slocum Memorial|first=Ivan|last=Smith|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[underwater glider]]—an [[autonomous underwater vehicle]] (AUV), designed by the [[Scripps Institute of Oceanography]], was named after Slocum's ship ''Spray''. It became the first AUV to cross the Gulf Stream, while operated by the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://spray.ucsd.edu/|publisher=UC San Diego|title=Spray AUV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another AUV has been named after Slocum himself: the Slocum Electric Glider, designed by Douglas Webb of Webb Research (since 2008, [[Teledyne Technologies#Companies|Teledyne Webb Research]]).

In 2009, a [[Slocum glider]], modified by Rutgers University, crossed the Atlantic in 221 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://rucool.marine.rutgers.edu/atlantic/status_updates.html| title=Flight Across the Atlantic - RU27 - RU17| website=marine.rutgers.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RU27 traveled from Tuckerton, New Jersey, to [[Baiona, Pontevedra]], Spain — the port where [[Christopher Columbus]] landed on his return from his first voyage to the New World. Like Slocum himself, the Slocum glider is capable of traveling over thousands of kilometers. These gliders continue to be used by various research institutions, including Texas A&amp;M University's Department of Oceanography and Geochemical and Environmental Research Group (GERG), to explore the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and other [[bodies of water]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://today.tamu.edu/2013/07/31/gliders-give-key-ocean-data-from-gulf/|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University|title=Gliders give key ocean data from gulf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A monument to Slocum exists on [[Brier Island, Nova Scotia]], not far from his family's boot shop. Slocum is commemorated in museum exhibits at the [[New Bedford Whaling Museum]] in Massachusetts, the [[Maritime Museum of the Atlantic]] in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and the [[Mount Hanley Schoolhouse Museum]] near his birthplace.  Several biographies about Slocum are published.

The Slocum River in [[Dartmouth, Massachusetts]] was named for him, as was a newly discovered plant in [[Mauritius]] while he was there: "Returning to the ''Spray'' by way of the great flower conservatory near Moka, the proprietor, having only that morning discovered a new and hardy plant, to my great honor named it 'Slocum'".&lt;ref&gt;Slocum, J (1899), Chapter XVII&lt;/ref&gt; Slocum himself discovered an island by accident, and named it ''Alan Erric Island''.&lt;ref&gt;Slocum, J (1899), chapter X&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kirkwood Farm, Ayrshire.JPG|thumb|300px|Kirkwood Farm from the road]]
The '''Lands of Kirkwood''' (NS3947) formed a small estate in the Parish of [[Stewarton]], [[East Ayrshire]] lying between Stewarton and [[Corsehill|Dunlop]], which in 1678 became part of the lands of Lainshaw, known as the Lainshaw, Kirkwood and Bridgehouse Estate. Kirkwood was anciently known as Bloak Cunninghame.&lt;ref&gt;Lainshaw, Page 253&lt;/ref&gt; Kirkwood remains as a farm in 2010.

==History==

===The lairds of Kirkwood===
[[File:Townend of Kirkwood, Ayrshire.JPG|left|200px|thumb|Townend of Kirkwood Farm]]
Kirkwood was the possession of the [[Niven]] family for several generations from circa 1532.&lt;ref name="N"/&gt;&lt;ref name="D273"&gt;Dobie, Page 273&lt;/ref&gt; John Niving (sic), a [[notary public]] held the property in the early 17th century and died in December 1616. His son, also John Niven, is on record in September 1606. The wife of John Niven was Kathrein Fairnlie and his children were Hew and Christiane Nevingis.&lt;ref name="D273"/&gt; In January 1635, James Nevein (sic) is on record as the heir to his grandfather James Nevein of Kirkwood in the two and a half merk land of Kirkwood.&lt;ref name="D273"/&gt;

Stephen Nevin, was the father of James Nevin, the first laird of Kirkwood. At Edinburgh, on 15 December 1543, Christine Boyd daughter of Patrick Boyd in Clerkland near Stewarton, married John Nevin son and heir apparent of James Nevin of Kirkwood. James had held the nearby lands of Nether Oldhall with mansion, houses, tenants, etc.&lt;ref name="N"&gt;[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nivenfamily/genealogica_chapter5.html Niven Genealogica. Accessed : 27 August 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

John Nevin, the third laird of Kirkwood, and Christine Boyd his wife, had a son John; the fourth laird of Kirkwood. In 1579 the estate of Oldhall was granted to Adam Cunningham of Colynane and Jean Mure his wife, which had been held by John Nevin son and heir of John Nevin of Kirkwood, and [[liferent]] of John the elder and Christian Boyd mother of the said John younger.&lt;ref name="N"/&gt;

The marriage contract of John Nevin is dated 9 December 1580. The King granted to John Neving younger, son and heir apparent of John Nevin of Kirkwood, and Cristine Montomerie his wife, half of the 2½ mercates of the lands of Kirkwood. John Elder resigned personally in favour of John Younger and Cristine. John elder and Cristine Boyd his wife kept the free tenement of one half of the lands with the dwelling house.&lt;ref name="N"/&gt;
[[File:Cauldhame Farm, Ayrshire.JPG|thumb|200px|Cauldhame Farm from near the Linn Spout]]
The fifth laird of Kirk wood was also named John Nevin, and his wife was Katherine Fairnellie, Hew and Christine Nevings being their children. The inventory of his estate in 1618 showed it to be free from debt, the value amounting to £313. Their son Hugh, died before succeeding, leaving a son James as sixth laird of Kirkwood, who is retoured heir male of John Nevin of Kirkwood, his grandfather, 22 January 1635, in the 2½ lands of Kirkwood. James married Margaret Montgomery, but left no children and the property passes to Hugh Nevin, seventh laird of Kirkwood.&lt;ref name="N"/&gt;

Hugh Nevin had been portioner of Auchenmade and inherited the 2½ merklands of Kirkwood called Kirkwode-Nevein. Hugh Nevin, was a baillie burgess of [[Irvine, North Ayrshire|Irvine]] and Jonet Pawtoun was his wife. Hugh was the brother of Andrew Nevin of Monkredding. Jonet died 28 April 1591, her will mentions one child, a daughter, also Jonet. Whether there was a son Hugh who became portioner of Achinmade or whether it was Andrew's son is not clear. Stephan of Oldhall may have been the common ancestor of the Kirkwood and Monkredding families.&lt;ref name="N"/&gt;

Hugh of Kirkwood died in December 1645, and Hugh, his son, succeeded him. The sum of the inventory was £662-13-8. Hugh of Kirkwood was baillie to Sir Alexander Cunningham as appears in Corshill Baron-Court Book, 7 March 1673, ''Court holden within the hall of Corshill, the threttene day of January 1673 be the Rycht honourabill Sir Alexander Cunyhame of Corshil, and Hughe Niven of Kirkwood, his honouris balizee, with all other members needful.''&lt;ref name="N"/&gt;
[[File:Chapel-lands park, Kirkwood, Ayrshire.JPG|thumb|200px|left|The Chapel-lands Park with Kirkwood or Bloak Moss in the background]]
On 25 July 1666, a summons was issued of ''Hew Neving of Kirkwood against John Richie in Byres of Kilwinning, for non-payment of £67 being the silver maill and duty of the lands of Darnboig, which belong to the pursuer.'' Darnboig, was in 1585, the property of Hugh Nevin, brother of Andrew Nevin of Monkredding.

Hugh appears to have been the last of Nevin laird of Kirkwood; on 2 May 1667, the lands were incorporated into the [[Eglinton Castle|Eglinton estates]]. A charter reads:''Charter, granting to Hugh, [[Earl of Eglinton]], Lord Montgomery and Kilwinning his heirs &amp;c the 2½ merk lands of the same called Kirkwood Neivine with building etc, the 2½ merk lands of Craiglie with the commomty of Large &amp;c . . . all of which lands (except Kirkwood Neivine and Craglis) formerly belonged to Hugh, Earl of Eglinton, Kirkwood Neivine to Hugh Neivine of Kirkwood, and Craiglie to Robert Montgomerie of Heaslehead, and were resigned by them for new infeftments.''&lt;ref name="N"/&gt;

Hugh Nevin died in September 1677 and Agnes Dick was his wife. A will, dated at Over Kirkwood, 28 August 1677, states ''the said umquhile Hew Nevin of Kirkwood, he ordains that his body be buried in the churchyard of Kilwinning in his father's burial place of Kilwinning''.&lt;ref name="N"/&gt;

===Baillie of Corsehill barony court===
[[Image:CorsehillHouse.jpg|thumb|200px|A 1791 View of Corsehill House, where the Barony Court. Only the Tower of Masonry remains today.]]
The [[Moot Hill|Baron-Baillie]] was the principal administrative officer of a barony court, his insignia of office was a Cap of Justice, a Black legal Robe, and a medal of office on a chain. The [[Barony and Castle of Corsehill|Corsehill Baron-Court]] records show that Hughe Niven of Kirkwood was one of the baillies from at least January 1673 as he participates as the ''honouris balizee' of Sir Alexander Cunynghame of Corshil (sic) from that date&lt;ref name="C105"&gt;Corsehill Baron-Court Book. Page 105&lt;/ref&gt; Another baillie at this time was one John Deanes, a merchant of the Kirkton of Stewarton.&lt;ref name="C109"&gt;Corsehill Baron-Court Book. Page 109&lt;/ref&gt; The last record of a Hew Nevine of Kirkwood as baillie in 1677 as he died in September&lt;ref name="N"/&gt; of that year.&lt;ref name="C137"&gt;Corsehill Baron-Court Book. Page 137&lt;/ref&gt;

A David Stewart of Kirkwood is named as the baillie to the Corsehill court from November 1680 for Sir Alexander Cuninghame,&lt;ref name="C151"&gt;Corsehill Baron-Court Book. Page 151&lt;/ref&gt; however by 1698 he is baillie to David Boyle of Kelburn.&lt;ref name="C195"&gt;Corsehill Baron-Court Book. Page 195&lt;/ref&gt;

The position of baillie was a powerful one and they had many ways of making money for themselves, such as the bailie's 'darak', as it was called, or a day's labour in the year from every tenant on the estate; confiscations, as they generally seized on all the goods and effects of such as suffered capitally; all fines for killing game, blackfish, or cutting green wood were laid on by themselves, and sometimes went into their own pockets. The level of fines was not closely regulated. Another lucrative right was the so called 'Herial Horse', which was the best horse, cow, ox, or other article which any tenant on the estate possessed at the time of his death. This was taken from the widow and children for the baillie, at the time they had most need of assistance. This amounted to a great deal of extra income for the baillie of a large barony.&lt;ref name="Bailies"&gt;[http://www.electricscotland.com/history/cairngorm/16.htm ''In the Days of the Baron Bailies.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Nevins===
The surname was spelt Niven, Nevin, Nevins, Nivens, Navin, Newin, Nevane, Niffen, Nifen, Nephin, Niving, Neving, Neiven, and Nivine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electricscotland.com/webclans/scotsirish/navin.htm Clan Nevin. Accessed : 28 August 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; It is derived from 'little saint' and is recorded in Ayrshire and Galloway from the end of the 13th century.&lt;ref name="C458"&gt;Coventry, Page 458&lt;/ref&gt;

The small tower house, later a mansion, of [[Monkredding House, North Ayrshire|Monkredding House]] near [[Kilwinning]], was held by the Nievans or Nevins from at least the 16th to the late 17th centuries, being passed to the Cunninghams of Clonbeith by William Nevin in 1698.&lt;ref name="C458"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R321"&gt;Robertson, Page 321&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Nevins of Kirkwood, along with the Nevins of Kilwinning were exiled to Ireland at the end of the 18th Century. These Nevins were, as previously stated, related to the Nevin's of Kirkwood.&lt;ref name="N"/&gt; Thomas Nevin built the present house in 1602; it was extended in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;Ness, Page 64&lt;/ref&gt;

A James Nevin of Drumbuie was a witness to the will of Hugh Nevin of Kirkwood in 1677.&lt;ref name="N"/&gt;

===The estate===

The 1799 plan records a number of properties within the Kirkwood Estate, namely Gunshill, Smiddy Farm, Townend, Drawkiln, Coldhame, Bloak Mill, Bowhouse, Bloak North Crofts, Bloak South Crofts, Bankend, South Bloakhill Head, West Bloakhill Head, East Bloakhill Head, [[Bloak|South Bloak Holm]], [[Bloak|North Bloak Holm]], Law, Moss House, Waulkmill, Struthers, Moss Park, Lugton, Brae, Kirkwood Moss, and the Cottar houses in Bloak. The estate came to a land area of {{convert|911|acre|km2}}, with the Lainshaw Estate totalling {{convert|1628|acre|km2}}.&lt;ref name="L"/&gt;
[[File:Linn Spout on the Gunshill Burn, Kirkwood.JPG|thumb|200px|The Linn Spout on the Gunshill Burn from above]]
Townhead of Kirkwood's entrance previously ran up to the Kirkwood lane. The nearby Bloak Moss behind Law Farm was previously known as Kirkwood Moss.&lt;ref name="L"&gt;Plan of Lainshaw&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922 Richard John Cunninghame of Lainshaw sold Townhead of Kirkwood to James and Thomas Paterson, Farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Lainshaw, Page 314&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1779 a mansion still stood at Kirkwood near the middle of a small enclosure, with an apparently raised area in front, delineated by trees.&lt;ref name="L"/&gt; The first 6-inch OS map shows a well laid out garden complex in front of Kirkwood, corresponding to the raised area shown on the 1779 map, with paths that led, following field boundaries, to the old toll road near North Kilbride Farm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geo.nls.uk/os6inch/ NLS Maps. Accessed : 27 August 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304132533/http://geo.nls.uk/os6inch/ |date=4 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1799 a 'smiddy park' is shown with three buildings to the west of the house. Gunshill nearby is shown as a single building with a small enclosure in front of it.&lt;ref name="L"/&gt; The field or 'Park' names of Kirkwood and Gunshill are of interest, including Whin, Johnshill, Stone, Byrestead, Gooseward, Ward, Wood, Long Crooks, Hillock Holm and the Chapel-lands across the road.&lt;ref name="L"/&gt; 

The 1775 map shows a mansion house surrounded by substantial woodland policies,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nls.uk/maps/joins/view/?rsid=74400204&amp;sid=74400947&amp;mid=797&amp;pdesc=North%20West%20section Andrew Armstrongs Map. Accessed : 27 August 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; as does Thomson's map of 1820.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nls.uk/maps/atlas/thomson/view/?rsid=74400168&amp;sid=74400168&amp;mid=547 Thomson's Map. Accessed : 26 August 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; William Aiton's map of 1808 shows a mansion house at Kirkwood.&lt;ref&gt;Aiton, Map&lt;/ref&gt;

A field going by the curious name of 'Kilwinning Butts' was located on the Lands of Kirkwood on the road leading to Dunlop Church in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Lainshaw, Page 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Whinstone, limestone and sandstone quarries were present in the area, with a limekiln near Kirkwood itself. The Spout Lynn is a waterfall on the Gunshill Burn near Kirkwood.

Gouknest Park lies nearby and coal pits are shown in the area in 1799, as well as at North Kilbride, where a Coalpit Park is recorded.&lt;ref name="L"/&gt; Gouknest produced gas coal and was abandoned in November 1903.&lt;ref&gt;Mines Department, Page 45&lt;/ref&gt;

====Religious connections====
[[File:North Kilbride, Ayrshire.JPG|thumb|200px|left|North Kilbride Farm]]
The plethora of apparently religious names in this area – Kirkwood, Chapel-lands Park, Kirkmuirs, Kirkhill, Lady Moss, High Cross, Canaan and the Kilbride farms, suggest that in the past pre-Christian and/or Christian site or sites were located here. No documentary evidence remains and the earliest record is for Kirkry in 1654, now Kilbride. [[Bride]], [[Brigit]] or St. Brigid was originally a Celtic Goddess linked with the festival of [[Imbolc]], held on the eve of the first of February. Brigid was the goddess of Spring and was associated with healing and sacred wells. The name Canaan at Kirkmuir was in use as early as 1779.

==The Tam o'Shanter connection==
Towards the end of the 17th century several Niven brothers from Monkridding and Brigend areas of Kilwinning parish moved to the Girvan area. John Niven set up as a blacksmith and was well known for designing a building a cart, with wheels that rotated on a fixed axle, at a time when most farmers still used sleds.

:''Thou sat as lang as thou had siller;''.
:''That every naig was ca'd a shoe on,''
:''The smith and thee gat roaring fou on; "''
&lt;/div&gt;
|}&lt;/div&gt;

It is thought that John is the smith mentioned in Robert Burns's poem 'Tam o'Shanter' and his son Robert may have been the miller in the classic poem.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, Pages 70–71&lt;/ref&gt;

==Micro-history==
A Mill of Kilbride and the mill lands of Kilbride are recorded in the register of sasines.&lt;ref&gt;Lainshaw,page 126&lt;/ref&gt;

Stories of ghosts at North Kilbride include an old man often seen in a rocking chair and horses cantering by onto the abandoned road to Irvinehill Farm.

'''Leopold von Schrenck''' ({{lang-ru|Леопольд Иванович фон Шренк}}; 1826 &amp;ndash; 8 January 1894) was a [[Baltic German]] [[zoologist]], [[geographer]] and [[ethnographer]] from [[Russian Empire|Russia]].

==Biography==
Schrenck came from a [[Baltic German]] family, and was born and brought up near Chotenj, south-west of [[St Petersburg]]. He received his doctorate from the [[University of Tartu]], and then studied natural science in [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]] and [[University of Königsberg|Königsberg]]. He joined the crew of the ''Aurora'' in the circumnavigation of the world.

In 1853 Schrenck was sent by the [[St Petersburg Academy of Sciences]] to explore the [[Amurland]] on board the schooner ''Vostok''. He reached the mouth of the [[Amur River|Amur]] in September 1854 with the botanist [[Carl Maximowicz]]. In February 1855 he visited [[Sakhalin]] and then explored the Amur in the spring and summer. In 1856 he returned overland to [[Europe]], via [[Lake Baykal]]. He published his findings in his ''Reisen und Forschungen im Amur-Lande'' (1860). He was awarded the Konstantin medal by the Russian Geographical Society.

In later years Schrenck turned his attention to the study of the native peoples of Russia. On 10 November, 1879 he was appointed director of the [[Peter the Great Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography]] in [[St Petersburg]].

A number of animals are named after Schrenck, including the following [[species]].
* Schrenck's limpet, ''[[Notoacmea]] schrenckii''
* [[Amur sturgeon]], ''Acipenser shrenckii''
* [[Elaphe schrenckii|Manchurian black water snake]], ''Elaphe schrenckii'' &lt;ref&gt;Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). ''The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. {{ISBN|978-1-4214-0135-5}}. ("Schrenck", p. 238).&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Schrenck's bittern]], ''Ixobrychus eurhythmus''
* A butterfly, ''[[:ru:Переливница Шренка|Apatura schrenckii]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5470">'''Longhurst code''' refers to a set of [[geomatics|geospatial]] four-letter [[geocode]]s for referencing [[physical geography|geographic regions]] in [[oceanography]].

The set of 56 geocodes represent biogeochemical provinces that partition the [[pelagic]] environment.  It is assumed that each province represents a unique set of environmental conditions.&lt;ref name="ReygondeauLonghurst2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reygondeau|first1=Gabriel|last2=Longhurst|first2=Alan|last3=Martinez|first3=Elodie|last4=Beaugrand|first4=Gregory|last5=Antoine|first5=David|last6=Maury|first6=Olivier|title=Dynamic biogeochemical provinces in the global ocean|journal=Global Biogeochemical Cycles|volume=27|issue=4|year=2013|pages=1046–1058|issn=0886-6236|doi=10.1002/gbc.20089}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are named after [[Alan Longhurst|Alan R. Longhurst]], the author of "Ecological Geography of the Sea", the textbook in which these codes are defined.&lt;ref&gt;Ecological Geography of the Sea ({{ISBN|0124555217}}), Academic Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

These codes have also been used in [[bioinformatics|bioinformatic databases]] such as [[Integrated Microbial Genomes System|IMG]] to represent sample origins for sequenced microbial [[genomics|genomes]], as a supplement to [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] [[geographic coordinate system|coordinate metrics]].&lt;ref name="MarkowitzChen2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Markowitz|first1=V.

__NOTOC__
'''Malin to Mizen''' most commonly refers to a journey from [[Malin Head]] (Ireland's most northerly point in [[County Donegal]]) to [[Mizen Head]] in [[County Cork]] (commonly thought to be Ireland's most southerly point, although nearby [[Brow Head]] is approximately 9 metres further south). The journey is most often attempted by cyclists and walkers as a challenge route with the goal of [[fundraising|raising money]] for charities. [[As the crow flies]], the two points are {{convert|466|km|mi|abbr=on}} apart. The shortest road distance from Malin to Mizen is approximately {{convert|612|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The distance of the routes commonly taken have been reported as between 644 and 715&amp;nbsp;km (400 and 444 miles).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mizen-malin.org/|author=Mizen Malin Organisation|title=Mizen-Malin Challenge|accessdate=8 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cycling==
A record cycling time of 19 hours 3 mins was set in 1993 by Alex Barry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.irishcycling.com/publish/exec/view.cgi?archive=8&amp;num=1925 | author=IrishCycling.com | title=O'Donoghue goes for Mizen to Malin record  |author2=Rose Leith | date=17 July 2006 | accessdate=8 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the route is most commonly completed in around 5–6 days by cyclists.

The [[charitable organizations|charity]] [[Marie Curie Cancer Care]] uses the route as a [[fundraising]] opportunity and provides logistical support for cyclists who are able to raise a minimum sponsorship amount and pay a registration fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mariecurie.org.uk/events/cycling/malin_to_mizen_cycle_challenge/ |title=Malin Head to Mizen Head Cycle Challenge |author=Marie Curie Cancer Care|accessdate=8 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In July 2014, 26 members of the Over The Hill Cycling Club from Watergrasshill in County Cork completed the cycle from Mizen Head to Malin Head in 23 hours (21:16:15 moving time). The cycle was organised to raise funds for Pieta House, the centre for the prevention of self-harm or suicide. 
CLIC Sargent, the children and young people's cancer charity, also holds a Malin to Mizen cycle challenge,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clicsargent.org.uk/event/malin-mizen-cycle |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130519101343/http://www.clicsargent.org.uk/event/malin-mizen-cycle |archivedate=19 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; as does the Neurofibromatosis Association of Ireland, where again logistical support and accommodation are provided for cyclists who raise a minimum sponsorship amount. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfaireland.ie/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218225027/http://www.nfaireland.ie/index.html |archivedate=18 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Merchant Kings: When Companies Ruled the World, 1600 to 1900''''' is a 2009 non-fiction popular history book by Stephen. R. Bown, which discusses the age of "heroic commerce" through biographical profiles of six of the leading "merchant kings" of the great [[chartered company|chartered companies]] which held colonial trade monopolies: [[Jan Pieterszoon Coen]] of the [[Dutch East India Company]], [[Pieter Stuyvesant]] of the [[Dutch West India Company]], [[Robert Clive]] of the [[English East India Company]], [[Alexander Andreyevich Baranov|Alexander Baranov]] of the [[Russian American Company]], [[George Simpson (HBC administrator)|George Simpson]] of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], and [[Cecil John Rhodes]] of the [[British South Africa Company]].

Each of these companies blurred the line between corporation and state, taking on certain roles of civil government over its employees, customers, and native peoples and settlers within their domains. The men who ran them operated with impunity, far from the oversight and control of their home countries' governments and their companies' directors (many of whom never stepped foot on the territories whose commerce they profited from).&lt;ref name="collins"/&gt; These men, often from humble beginnings, grew fantastically wealthy and powerful through the activities of their companies, while serving as quasi-official representatives of their home government—roles which were often at odds. They achieved their successes as much through military conquest and treachery—against their competitors, their employees, and native peoples—as through equitable trade.&lt;ref name="burrough"/&gt; Though each helped to shape the modern world, their reputations are largely tarnished by their moral failings.&lt;ref name="PW"/&gt;

==Reception==
Mainstream reviews of the book were mixed. ''[[The New York Times]]'' criticized the book, finding "problems with Mr. Bown’s approach. His focus on individuals means that the book deals with the companies themselves in only the most glancing way, and what analysis he offers is less than eye-opening...The ideal reader of ''Merchant Kings'' would appear to be an eighth-grade boy. Both the prose and the analysis are simplistic, occasionally purple — soldiers are not shot but 'blasted' — and largely devoid of business insight." However, the ''Times'' credited the book for its "easily digestible overview" of the period, and praised Bown's coining of the phrase "the Age of Heroic Commerce".&lt;ref name="burrough"/&gt;

''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' was also critical of the author's decision to structure the book around the biographies of the companies' leaders, declaring, "Mr. Bown writes smoothly, but he appears to have done no original research and his potted biographies are linked by the barest of thematic threads." The ''Journal'' concluded that "''Merchant Kings'' is not a robust popular history but a flimsy one, a collection of anecdotes strung together by generalizations."&lt;ref name="collins"/&gt;

However, ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' praised the book as an "ingenious" distillation of multinational history, and noted that "though Bown focuses on individuals, he does not leave states and companies to plead innocence."&lt;ref name="brook"/&gt; ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' called the book "a magnificent description of the six great companies, and their leaders".&lt;ref name="PW"/&gt;

[[Image:vinalesvalley1.jpg|thumb|250px|Dome-like rounded mogotes in Viñales Valley, Cuba.]]

A '''mogote''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|g|əʊ|t|i}})&lt;ref&gt;https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/mogote&lt;/ref&gt; is a generally isolated steep-sided residual hill composed of either [[limestone]], [[marble]], or [[Dolostone|dolomite]]. Mogotes are surrounded by nearly flat [[alluvial plain]]s. These hills typically have a rounded, tower-like form.

==Overview==
This term is used for hills, isolated or linked, with very steep - almost vertical - walls, surrounded by alluvial plains, in the tropics regardless of whether the carbonate strata in which they have formed is folded or not.&lt;ref name="Neuendorf Other2005a"&gt;Neuendorf, K.

'''Nogales''' is a city in [[Santa Cruz County, Arizona]]. The population was 20,837 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]] and estimated 20,407 in 2014. Nogales forms part of the larger [[List of Combined Statistical Areas|Tucson-Nogales combined statistical area]], with a total population of 1,027,683 as of the 2010 Census. The city is the [[county seat]] of [[Santa Cruz County, Arizona|Santa Cruz County]].&lt;ref name="GR6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |accessdate=June 7, 2011 |title=Find a County |publisher=National Association of Counties |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531210815/http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |archivedate=May 31, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nogales, Arizona, borders the city of [[Nogales, Sonora|Nogales]], [[Sonora]], [[Mexico]], and is Arizona's largest [[U.S.-Mexico border|international border]] community. The southern terminus of [[Interstate 19]] is located in Nogales at the U.S.-Mexico border; the highway continues south into Mexico as [[Mexico Federal Highway 15]]. The highways meeting in Nogales are a major road intersection in the [[CANAMEX Corridor]], connecting Canada, the United States, and Mexico. Nogales also is the beginning of the [[Arizona Sun Corridor]], an economically important trade region stretching from Nogales to [[Prescott, Arizona|Prescott]], including the [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] and [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] metropolitan areas.

Nogales is home to four international ports of entry, including the [[Nogales-Morley Gate Port of Entry|Morley Pedestrian Port of Entry]], [[Nogales-Grand Avenue Port of Entry|Dennis Deconcini Pedestrian and Passenger Vehicle Port of Entry]], [[Nogales International Airport]], and the Mariposa Port of Entry. The [[Nogales-Mariposa Port of Entry]] has twelve passenger vehicle inspection lanes and eight commercial inspection lanes.

Due to its location on the border and its major ports of entry, Nogales funnels an estimated $30 billion worth of international trade into Arizona and the United States, per year, in fresh produce and manufactured goods from Mexico and the world through the deep sea port in [[Guaymas|Guaymas, Sonora, Mexico]]. This trade helps to support tens of thousands of jobs and the overall economies in Ambos Nogales and throughout the American state of Arizona and the Mexican state of Sonora.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biztucson.com/azmexico-commission/26-billion-in-cross-border-trade |title=$26 Billion in Cross-Border Trade |publisher=Biztucson.com |date=June 13, 2012 |accessdate=August 30, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730071640/http://www.biztucson.com/azmexico-commission/26-billion-in-cross-border-trade |archivedate=July 30, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Known in [[O'odham language|O'odham]] as ''Nowa:l'',{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} (which translates as "[[prickly pear cactus]]" or the Spanish ''nopal'') the name Nogales means "black walnuts" in Spanish, and the walnut trees which once grew abundantly in the mountain pass between the cities of Nogales, Arizona, and Nogales, Sonora, can still be found around the town.

==Geography==

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|20.8|sqmi|km2}}, all of it land.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

The city is at an elevation of {{convert|3829|ft}}.&lt;ref name=gnis/&gt;

===Climate===
Nogales has a [[semi-arid]] steppe climate, which is less hot and more rainy than a typical [[arid]] climate classification such as Phoenix. In the winter months, Nogales averages in the mid to upper 60s, with January averaging daily highs of around {{convert|63|°F|°C|1|disp=or}}. Lows typically settle just below the freezing mark ({{convert|32|°F|°C|disp=or}}) on a majority of nights, but it is not uncommon to see temperatures tumble below {{convert|25|°F|°C|1|disp=or}} on some winter nights.

On the other hand, in the summer months, highs average between {{convert|90|and|100|°F|°C|1}}, with the month of June being the hottest with an average daytime high of {{convert|96|°F|°C|1|disp=or}}. Nighttime lows for the summer months remain in the upper 50s and lower 60s for the duration of the season. The Arizona Monsoon generally runs through July and August, and these months typically see eight inches or more of combined rainfall, which brings the average annual [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] for Nogales to about {{convert|16|in|mm|-1|disp=or}}. Some monsoon season storms are capable of producing several inches of rain in a short amount of time, creating flash flood hazards.

Nogales’ all-time highest recorded temperature is {{convert|112|°F|°C|1|disp=or}}, which was reached on June 26, 1990. The lowest recorded temperature was {{convert|-4|°F|°C|disp=or}} on December 8, 1978.

==History==
[[File:Nogales 1899.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Nogales, Santa Cruz County, Arizona, US, circa 1899. Showing boundary line between Arizona, (right); and Sonora, México, (left).]]
The name "Nogales" is derived from the Spanish word for "walnut" or "walnut tree." It refers to the large stands of walnut trees that once stood in the mountain pass where Nogales is located.&lt;ref name=cityofnogales&gt;{{cite web| url=http://cityofnogales.net/visitors| title=Welcome to Nogales, AZ| publisher=City of Nogales| accessdate=February 1, 2009}}A view of the center of town from hillside, looking west along International Street, c. 1898–99&lt;/ref&gt;

Nogales was at the beginning of the 1775–1776 [[Juan Bautista de Anza]] Expedition as it entered the present day U.S. from [[New Spain]], and the town is now on the [[Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail]]. On the second floor of the 1904 Nogales Courthouse is a small room dedicated to the 1775–1776 Anza Expedition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/juba/planyourvisit/anza-related-sites.htm |title=Anza Related Sites - Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail (U.S. National Park Service) |publisher=Nps.gov |date=February 9, 2014 |accessdate=March 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1841, a land grant from the Mexican government to the Elías family established ''Los Nogales de Elías.'' Following the [[Gadsden purchase]] in 1853, Nogales became a part of the [[United States|United States of America]]. In 1880, Russian immigrant Jacob Isaacson built a trading post at present-day Nogales. The U.S. Postal Service opened the Isaacson post office but renamed it as Nogales in 1883.&lt;ref name=nogaleshistory&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nogaleshistory.com/nogales_history.html |title=Nogales History |publisher=Pimeria Alta Museum |accessdate=February 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915, according to historian David Leighton, Sonora Gov. Jose M. Maytorena ordered construction of an 11-wire fence, separating Nogales, Sonora from Nogales, Arizona, but it was taken down four months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tucson.com/news/blogs/streetsmarts/street-smarts-first-fence-built-to-hold-back-cattle/article_53067fa5-9ef9-53a2-bd6a-b44d3e67c2f4.html|title=Street Smarts: First fence built to hold back cattle|first=David Leighton For the Arizona Daily|last=Star|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 27, 1918, a [[Battle of Ambos Nogales|battle]] between United States Army forces and Mexican militia - mostly civilian in composition - took place. Culminating as the result of a decade's worth of tensions originating from the Mexican Revolution and earlier battles in Nogales along the border in 1913 and 1915, the main consequence of the 1918 violence saw the building of the first permanent border wall between Nogales, Arizona, and Nogales, Sonora, along the previously unobstructed boundary line on International Street.

==Economy==
The economy of Nogales is heavily dependent on the cross-border trade through its Ports of Entry by produce distributors and American-based manufacturing plants in Nogales, Sonora and throughout the rest of the Mexican states of Sonora and Sinaloa. Most of Nogales' economy is based on [[agribusiness]] and produce distributors, which comes from large farms in the Mexican agri-belt. Despite its small population, Nogales actually receives much patronage from its bordering sister-city, Nogales, Sonora, Mexico. Most observers guess the population of Nogales, Sonora, at roughly 300,000.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} International commerce is a big part of Nogales’ economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nogalesinternational.com/articles/2010/04/16/news/doc4bc88657edc9e220093797.txt |title=Kyl, McCain to DHS: Speed up Nogales border crossings |publisher= ''[[Nogales International]]'' |accessdate=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 60 percent of Nogales’ sales tax comes from the estimated 30,000 Mexican shoppers crossing the border daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nogalesinternational.com/articles/2010/06/05/news/doc4c091c8de7d1f463433316.txt |title=Sales tax hike met with mixed response |publisher= ''Nogales International'' |accessdate=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} Nogales, Arizona, and Nogales, Sonora, are home to one of the largest [[maquiladora]] clusters.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} This enables American manufacturing plants on both sides of the border to take advantage of favorable wage and operating costs and excellent transportation and distribution networks.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

The [[Diplomatic missions of Mexico|Consulate-General of Mexico in Nogales]] is located on 135 W. Cardwell St.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sre.gob.mx/index.php/consulados/nogales |title=Información sobre el consulado |language=Spanish |publisher= [[Diplomatic missions of Mexico|Consulate-General of Mexico in Nogales]] |accessdate=May 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States Department of Homeland Security is a major economic driver in the Ambos Nogales region, with thousands of employees working for both the Border Patrol and Customs and Border Protection. Due to the large federal, state, and local police presence, Nogales has one of the highest police per-capita levels in the United States.

==In popular culture==
Nogales, Arizona, was the filming location for the motion picture musical, ''[[Oklahoma! (1955 film)|Oklahoma!]]''.

It was made an "honorary" part of the state of Oklahoma for the duration of the film shoot by order of the governor of Arizona.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Many dozens of motion pictures have been filmed around the Nogales area.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nogalesaz.gov/Film-Locations/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/search/title?locations=Nogales,%20Arizona,%20USA&amp;page=1&amp;ref_=adv_prv&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1603">'''Pattern gardening''' is a method of designing gardens influenced by the concepts of [[patterns]] and [[pattern language]] originated by [[Christopher Alexander]]. It reflects the archetypal patterns of garden making, based on proportions and how the senses react. Patterns give coherence to [[garden design]] and communicate creativity and aesthetics.

Specific elements are instinctively looked for in a garden. Working with these elements is the basis for all good garden design.  Each such element, or pattern, is archetypal, and therefore any pattern can be easily adapted to any garden situation. The fourteen pattern elements are:

*Scale, which relates the garden to the environment; 
*Garden rooms, which divide and connect the garden; 
*Pathways, which define what we see in the garden; 
*Bridges, which differentiate garden spaces and create compelling focal points; 
*Gates, which are the portal to the garden; 
*Shelters, which anchor the garden in space; 
*Borders, which separate and make distinct garden sections; 
*Patios, which tie the house to the landscape; 
*Sheds, which add texture; 
*Focal points, which create destinations in the garden; 
*Water, which fully engages the senses; 
*Ornamentation, which creates mood; 
*Containers, which allow artistic flexibility; and, 
*Materials, which add bulk, solidity, and softness to the garden.

In [[cartography]], '''rubbersheeting''' refers to the process by which a layer is distorted to allow it to be seamlessly joined to an adjacent geographic layer of matching imagery, such as [[satellite imagery]] (most commonly vector cartographic data) which are digital maps. This is sometimes referred to as image-to-vector [[conflation]]. Often this has to be done when layers created from adjacent map sheets are joined together. Rubber-sheeting is necessary because the imagery and the vector data will rarely match up correctly due to various reasons, such as the angle at which the image was taken, the [[curvature]] of the surface of the earth, minor movements in the imaging platform (such as a [[satellite]] or [[aircraft]]), and other errors in the imagery.

==Applications in history and historical geography==
Rubbersheeting is a useful technique in [[Historical geographic information system|HGIS]], where it is used to digitize and add old maps as feature layers in a modern [[Geographic information system|GIS]]. Before aerial photography arrived, most maps were highly inaccurate by modern standards. Rubbersheeting may improve the value of such sources and make them easier to compare to modern maps.

==Software==
* [[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI's]] [[ArcGIS]] 8.3+ has the capability of rubbersheeting [[vector graphics|vector data]], and ArcMap 9.2+ may also rubber-sheet [[Raster graphics|raster layers]].

A '''slippery slope argument''' ('''SSA'''), in [[logic]], [[critical thinking]], political [[rhetoric]], and [[caselaw]], is a [[consequentialist]] logical device&lt;ref name="Haigh et al. 2016"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haigh|first=Matthew|last2=Wood|first2=Jeffrey S.|last3=Stewart|first3=Andrew J.|date=July 2016|title=Slippery slope arguments imply opposition to change|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13421-016-0596-9|journal=Memory &amp; Cognition|language=en|volume=44|issue=5|pages=819–836|doi=10.3758/s13421-016-0596-9|issn=0090-502X}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which a party asserts that a relatively small first step leads to a [[Chain of events|chain of related events]] culminating in some significant (usually negative) effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=July 19, 2007 |title=Learning to reason clearly by understanding logical fallacies |website=makethestand.com |url= http://makethestand.com/ftopict-353.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120220014717/http://makethestand.com/ftopict-353.html |archive-date=February 20, 2012 |access-date=February 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The core of the slippery slope argument is that a specific decision under debate is likely to result in [[unintended consequences]]. The strength of such an argument depends on the [[Warrant (rhetoric)|warrant]], i.e. whether or not one can demonstrate a process that leads to the significant effect. This type of argument is sometimes used as a form of [[fear mongering]], in which the probable consequences of a given action are exaggerated in an attempt to scare the audience.  The fallacious sense of "slippery slope" is often used synonymously with [[continuum fallacy]], in that it ignores the possibility of middle ground and assumes a discrete transition from category A to category B.  In a non-fallacious sense, including use as a legal principle, a middle-ground possibility is acknowledged, and reasoning is provided for the likelihood of the predicted outcome.

Other idioms for the slippery slope argument are the ''thin end/edge of the wedge'', the ''[[camel's nose]] in the tent'', or ''[[If You Give a Mouse a Cookie]]''.

== Slopes, arguments and fallacies ==
Some writers distinguish between a slippery slope ''event'' and a slippery slope ''argument''.&lt;ref name="Rizzo 2003 p.541"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The camel's nose is in the tent: rules, theories, and slippery slopes |journal=UCLA Law Review |year=2003 |last=Rizzo |first=Mario |last2=Whitman |first2=Douglas |volume=51 |issue=2 |pages=539–592 |url=http://www.csun.edu/~dgw61315/camelsnose.html |accessdate=2017-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kelley 2014"&gt;{{cite book | last=Kelley | first=David | title=The art of reasoning: an introduction to logic and critical thinking | edition=4th | publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc | location=New York London | year=2014 | isbn=978-0-393-93078-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|122}} A slippery slope event can be represented by a series of conditional statements, namely:
:if p then q; if q then r; if r then{{nbsp}}…{{nbsp}}z. 
The idea being that through a series of intermediate steps p will imply z. Some writers point out that strict necessity isn't required and it can still be characterized as a slippery slope if at each stage the next step is plausible.&lt;ref name="Rizzo 2003 p.541"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tindale 2007"&gt;{{cite book | last=Tindale | first=Christopher | title=Fallacies and argument appraisal | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=Cambridge New York | year=2007 | isbn=978-0-521-60306-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|186}} This is important for with strict implication p will imply z but if at each step the probability is say 90% then the more steps there are the less likely it becomes that p will cause z.

A slippery slope ''argument'' is typically a negative argument where there is an attempt to dissuade someone from taking a course of action because if they do it will lead to some unacceptable conclusion.&lt;ref name="Haigh et al. 2016" /&gt; Some writers point out that an argument with the same structure might be used in a positive way in which someone is encouraged to take the first step because it leads to a desirable conclusion.&lt;ref name="Groarke 1997 p.246"&gt;{{cite book | last=Groarke | first=Leo | title=Good reasoning matters!: a constructive approach to critical thinking | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=Toronto New York | year=1997 | isbn=0-19-541225-7 | page=246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If someone is ''accused'' of using a slippery slope argument then it is being suggested they are guilty of fallacious reasoning and whilst they are claiming that p implies z, for whatever reason, this is not the case. In logic and critical thinking textbooks slippery slopes and slippery slope arguments are normally discussed as a form of fallacy although there may be an acknowledgement that non-fallacious forms of the argument can also exist.&lt;ref name="Walton 2015"/&gt;{{rp|273–311}}

== Types of slippery slope argument ==
Different writers have classified slippery slope arguments in different and often contradictory ways,&lt;ref name="Walton 2015"/&gt;{{rp|273–311}} but there are two basic types of argument that have been described as slippery slope arguments.&lt;ref name="The Fallacy Files"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fallacyfiles.org/slipslop.html |title=Logical fallacy: slippery slope |website=fallacyfiles.org |accessdate=2017-03-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kahane 2001 p.84 "&gt;{{cite book | last=Kahane | first=Howard | title=Logic and contemporary rhetoric: the use of reason in everyday life | publisher=Wadsworth Thomson Learning | location=Australia Belmont, CA | year=2001 | isbn=0-534-53578-X | page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; One type has been called ''the causal slippery slope'',&lt;ref name="Johnson 2006 p. 180"&gt;{{cite book | last=Johnson | first=Ralph | title=Logical self-defense | publisher=International Debate Education Association | location=New York | year=2006 | isbn=1-932716-18-1 | page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Govier 2010"&gt;{{cite book | last=Govier | first=Trudy | title=A practical study of argument | publisher=Cengage Learning | location=Belmont, CA | year=2010 | isbn=0-495-60340-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|308}} and the distinguishing feature of this type is that the various steps leading from p to z are events with each event being the cause of the next in the sequence.&lt;ref name="Fogelin 2001 p. 358"&gt;{{cite book | last=Fogelin | first=Robert | title=Understanding arguments: an introduction to informal logic | publisher=Harcourt College Publishers | location=Fort Worth, TX | year=2001 | isbn=978-0-15-507548-1 | page=358}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second type might be called ''the judgmental slippery slope'' with the idea being that the 'slope' does not consist of a series of events but is such that, for whatever reason, if a person makes one particular judgment they will rationally have to make another and so on. The judgmental type may be further sub-divided into conceptual slippery slopes and decisional slippery slopes.

Conceptual slippery slopes, which [[Trudy Govier]] calls ''the fallacy of slippery assimilation'',&lt;ref name="Govier 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pattinson|first=Shaun D.|date=2000|title=Regulating Germ-Line Gene Therapy to avoid Sliding down the Slippery Slope|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/096853320000400404|journal=Medical Law International|language=en|volume=4|issue=3-4|pages=213–222|doi=10.1177/096853320000400404|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; are closely related to the [[sorites paradox]] so, for example, in the context of talking about slippery slopes Merilee Salmon can say, "The slippery slope is an ancient form of reasoning. According to [[Bas van Fraassen|van Fraassen]] (''The Scientific Image''), the argument is found in [[Sextus Empiricus]] that incest is not immoral, on the grounds that 'touching your mother's big toe with your little finger is not immoral, and all the rest differs only by degree.'"&lt;ref name="Salmon 1995 p.128 "&gt;{{cite book | last=Salmon | first=Merrilee | title=Introduction to logic and critical thinking | publisher=Harcourt Brace College Publishers | location=Fort Worth | year=1995 | isbn=0-15-543064-5 | page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decisional slippery slopes are similar to conceptual slippery slopes in that they rely on there being a continuum with no clear dividing lines such that if you decide to accept one position or course of action then there will, either now or in the future, be no rational grounds for not accepting the next position or course of action in the sequence.

The difficulty in classifying slippery slope arguments is that there is no clear consensus in the literature as to how terminology should be used. It has been said that whilst these two fallacies "have a relationship which may justify treating them together", they are also distinct, and "the fact that they share a name is unfortunate".&lt;ref name="The Fallacy Files"/&gt; Some writers treat them side by side but emphasize how they differ.&lt;ref name="Fogelin 2001 p. 358"/&gt; Some writers use the term ''slippery slope'' to refer to one kind of argument but not the other, but don't agree on which one, whilst others use the term to refer to both. So, for example, 
*[[Christopher Tindale]] gives a definition that only fits the causal type. He says, "Slippery Slope reasoning is a type of negative reasoning from consequences, distinguished by the presence of a causal chain leading from the proposed action to the negative outcome."&lt;ref name="Tindale 2007"/&gt;{{rp|185}}
*Merrilee Salmon describes the fallacy as a failure to recognise that meaningful distinctions can be drawn and even casts the "[[domino theory]]" in that light.&lt;ref name="Salmon 1995 p.128 "/&gt;
*[[Doug Walton]] says that an essential feature of slippery slopes is a "loss of control" and this only fits with the decisional type of slippery slope. He says that, "The domino argument has a sequence of events in which each one in the sequence causes the next one to happen in such a manner that once the first event occurs it will lead to the next event, and so forth, until the last event in the sequence finally occurs…(and)…is clearly different from the slippery slope argument, but can be seen as a part of it, and closely related to it."&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Global Bioethics 2016"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Walton |first=Douglas |editor-last=Have |editor-first=Henk |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of global bioethics |pages=2623–2632 |title=Slippery slope |publisher=Springer Nature |location=Berlin |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-09483-0_394 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The metaphor and its alternatives==
===Thin end of a wedge===
Walton suggests Alfred Sidgwick should be credited as the first writer on informal logic to describe what would today be called a slippery slope argument.&lt;ref name="Walton 2015"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The basic slippery slope argument |journal=Informal Logic |year=2015 |last=Walton |first=Douglas |volume=35 |issue=3 |ssrn=2655360 |url=https://ojs.uwindsor.ca/ojs/leddy/index.php/informal_logic/article/view/4286}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|275}}
{{quote|1="We must not do this or that, it is often said, because if we did we should be logically bound to do something else which is plainly absurd or wrong. If we once begin to take a certain course there is no knowing where we shall be able to stop within any show of consistency; there would be no reason for stopping anywhere in particular, and we should be led on, step by step into action or opinions that we all agree to call undesirable or untrue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sidgwick |first=Alfred |title=The application of logic |location=London |publisher=MacMillan and Co. |year=1910 |page=40 |url=https://www.archive.org/stream/applicationoflog00sidgiala?ref=ol#page/40/mode/2up |access-date=2017-03-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Sidgwick says this is "popularly known as the objection to a thin end of a wedge" but might be classified now as a decisional slippery slope. However, the wedge metaphor also captures the idea that unpleasant end result is a wider application of a principle associated with the initial decision which is often a feature of decisional slippery slopes due to their incremental nature but may be absent from causal slippery slopes.

===Domino fallacy===
[[T. Edward Damer]], in his book ''[[Attacking Faulty Reasoning]]'', describes what others might call a causal slippery slope but says,
{{quote|1="While this image may be insightful for understanding the character of the fallacy, it represents a misunderstanding of the nature of the causal relations between events. Every causal claim requires a separate argument. Hence, any "slipping" to be found is only in the clumsy thinking of the arguer, who has failed to provide sufficient evidence that one causally explained event can serve as an explanation for another event or for a series of events."&lt;ref name="Damer 1995"&gt;{{cite book | last=Damer | first=T. Edward | title=Attacking faulty reasoning: a practical guide to fallacy-free arguments | publisher=Wadsworth Pub. Co | location=Belmont, Calif | year=1995 | isbn=0-534-21750-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|135}}}}
Instead Damer prefers to call it the ''domino fallacy''. [[Howard Kahane]] suggests that the domino variation of the fallacy has gone out of fashion because it was tied the [[domino theory]] for the [[United States]] becoming involved in the war in Vietnam and although the U.S. lost that war "it is primarily communist dominoes that have fallen".&lt;ref name="Damer 1995"/&gt;{{rp|84}}

===Dam burst===
Frank Saliger notes that "in the German-speaking world the dramatic image of ''the dam burst'' seems to predominate, in English speaking circles talk is more of the slippery slope argument"&lt;ref name="Saliger"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The dam burst and slippery slope argument in medical law and medical ethics |journal=Zeitschrift für Internationale Strafrechtsdogmatik |year=2007 |last=Saliger |first=Frank |volume=9 |pages=341–352 |issn=1863-6470 |url=http://www.zis-online.com/dat/artikel/2007_9_159.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|341}} and that "in German writing dam burst and slippery slope arguments are treated as broadly synonymous. In particular the structural analyses of slippery slope arguments derived from English writing are largely transferred directly to the dam burst argument."&lt;ref name="Saliger"/&gt;{{rp|343}} In exploring the differences between the two metaphors he comments that in the dam burst the initial action is clearly in the foreground and there is a rapid movement towards the resulting events whereas in the slippery slope metaphor the downward slide has at least equal prominence to the initial action and it "conveys the impression of a slower 'step-by-step' process where the decision maker as participant slides inexorably downwards under the weight of its own successive (erroneous) decisions."&lt;ref name="Saliger"/&gt;{{rp|344}} Despite these differences Salinger continues to treat the two metaphors as being synonymous. Walton arges that although the two are comparable "the metaphor of the dam bursting carries with it no essential element of a sequence of steps from an initial action through a gray zone with its accompanying loss of control eventuated in the ultimate outcome of the ruinous disaster. For these reasons, it seems best to propose drawing a distinction between dam burst arguments and slippery slope arguments."&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Global Bioethics 2016"/&gt;

===Other metaphors===
Eric Lode notes that "commentators have used numerous different metaphors to refer to arguments that have this rough form. For example, people have called such arguments "wedge" or "thin edge of the wedge", "[[camel's nose]]" or "camel's nose in the tent", "parade of horrors" or "[[parade of horribles]]", "[[domino effect|domino]]", [[Boiling_frog|Boiling Frog]] and "[[snowball effect|this could snowball]]" arguments. All of these metaphors suggest that allowing one practice or policy could lead us to allow a series of other practices or policies."&lt;ref name="Lode 1999"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Slippery slope arguments and legal reasoning |journal=California Law Review |year=1999 |last=Lode |first=Eric |volume=87 |issue=6/3 |pages=1469–1543 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1470}} [[Bruce Waller]] says it is lawyers who often call it the "parade of horribles" argument while politicians seem to favor "the camel's nose is in the tent".&lt;ref name="Waller 1998"&gt;{{cite book | last=Waller | first=Bruce | title=Critical thinking: consider the verdict | publisher=Prentice Hall | location=Upper Saddle River, N.J | year=1998 | isbn=0-13-744368-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|252}}

==Defining features of slippery slope arguments==
Given the disagreement over what constitutes a genuine slippery slope argument, it is to be expected that there are differences in the way they are defined. Lode says that "although all SSAs share certain features, they are a family of related arguments rather than a class of arguments whose members all share the same form."&lt;ref name="Lode 1999"/&gt;{{rp|1476}}

Various writers&lt;ref name="Govier 1982 pp. 303–316"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Govier | first=Trudy | title=What's wrong with slippery slope arguments? | journal=Canadian Journal of Philosophy | volume=12 | issue=2 | year=1982 | pages=303–316 | doi=10.1080/00455091.1982.10715799 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walton 1992"&gt;{{cite book | last=Walton | first=Douglas | title=Slippery slope arguments | publisher=Clarendon Press; Oxford University Press | location=Oxford; New York | year=1992 | isbn=0-19-823925-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lode 1999"/&gt; have attempted to produce a general taxonomy of these different kinds of slippery slope. Other writers have given a general definition that will encompass the diversity of slippery slope arguments. [[Eugene Volokh]] says, "I think the most useful definition of a slippery slope is one that covers all situations where decision A, which you might find appealing, ends up materially increasing the probability that others will bring about decision B, which you oppose."&lt;ref name="Volokh 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Eugene |last=Volokh |title=The mechanisms of the slippery slope |volume=116 |journal=Harvard Law Review |pages=1026–1137 |date=February 2003 |url=http://www.law.ucla.edu/volokh/slippery.pdf |jstor=1342743 |issue=4 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1030}}

Those who hold that slippery slopes are causal generally give a simple definition, provide some appropriate examples and perhaps add some discussion as to the difficulty of determining whether the argument is reasonable or fallacious. Most of the more detailed analysis of slippery slopes has been done by those who hold that genuine slippery slopes are of the decisional kind.

Lode, having claimed that SSAs are not a single class of arguments whose members all share the same form, nevertheless goes on to suggest the following common features.&lt;ref name="Lode 1999"/&gt;
{{Ordered list |list_style_type=upper-alpha |The series of intervening and gradual steps |The idea that the slope lacks a non-arbitrary stopping place |The idea that the practice under consideration is, in itself, unobjectionable}}

Rizzo and Whitman identify slightly different features. They say, "Although there is no paradigm case of the slippery slope argument, there are characteristic features of all such arguments. The key components of slippery slope arguments are three:
{{Ordered list |list_style_type=decimal |An initial, seemingly acceptable argument and decision; |A "danger case"—a later argument and decision that are clearly unacceptable; |A "process" or "mechanism" by which accepting the initial argument and making the initial decision raise the likelihood of accepting the later argument and making the later decision."&lt;ref name="Rizzo 2003 p.541"/&gt;}}

Walton notes that these three features will be common to all slippery slopes but objects that there needs to be more clarity on the nature of the 'mechanism' and a way of distinguishing between slippery slope arguments and arguments from negative consequences.&lt;ref name="Walton 2015"/&gt;{{rp|275}}

Corner et al. say that a slippery slope has "four distinct components:
{{Ordered list |list_style_type=lower-roman |An initial proposal (A). |An undesirable outcome (C). |The belief that allowing (A) will lead to a re-evaluation of (C) in the future. |The rejection of (A) based on this belief.}}
The alleged danger lurking on the slippery slope is the fear that a presently unacceptable proposal (C) will (by any number of psychological processes—see, e.g., {{harvnb|Volokh|2003}}) in the future be re-evaluated as acceptable."&lt;ref name="Corner Hahn Oaksford 2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Corner | first=Adam | last2=Hahn | first2=Ulrike | last3=Oaksford | first3=Mike | title=The psychological mechanism of the slippery slope argument | journal=Journal of Memory and Language | publisher=Elsevier BV | volume=64 | issue=2 | year=2011 | pages=133–152 | doi=10.1016/j.jml.2010.10.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walton adds the requirement that there must be a loss of control. He says, there are four basic components, "One is a first step, an action or policy being considered. A second is a sequence in which this action leads to other actions. A third is a so-called gray zone or area of indeterminacy along the sequence where the agent loses control. The fourth is the catastrophic outcome at the very end of the sequence. The idea is that as soon as the agent in question takes the first step he will be impelled forward through the sequence, losing control so that in the end he will reach the catastrophic outcome. Not all of these components are typically made explicit..."&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Global Bioethics 2016"/&gt;

==Non-fallacious usage==
Logic and critical thinking textbooks typically discuss slippery slope arguments as a form of fallacy but usually acknowledge that "slippery slope arguments can be good ones if the slope is real—that is, if there is good evidence that the consequences of the initial action are highly likely to occur. The strength of the argument depends on two factors. The first is the strength of each link in the causal chain; the argument cannot be stronger than its weakest link. The second is the number of links; the more links there are, the more likely it is that other factors could alter the consequences."&lt;ref name="Kelley 2014"/&gt;{{rp|123}}

If the conditional ''if p then{{nbsp}}…{{nbsp}}z'' is understood strictly then slippery slope arguments about the real world are likely to fall short of the standards required for sound deductive reasoning and might be dismissed as a fallacy but, as Walton points out, slippery slope arguments are not formal proofs, they are practical arguments about likely consequences.&lt;ref name="Walton 1992"/&gt; Rizzo says, "first and foremost, slippery slopes are slopes of arguments: One practical argument tends to lead to another, which means that one justified action, often a decision, tends to lead to another. When we say that one argument (and its supported action) tends to lead to another, we mean that it makes the occurrence of the subsequent argument more likely, not that it necessarily makes it highly likely or, still less, inevitable. Hence the transition between arguments is not based on strict logical entailment."&lt;ref name="Rizzo 2003 p.541"/&gt; Essentially, if accepting p raises the probability of z sufficiently that the risk of it happening passes a tolerable threshold the argument will be considered reasonable. There is, of course, considerable room for disagreement as to the likelihood of z occurring&lt;ref name="Waller 1998"/&gt;{{rp|255}} and what would be a tolerable level of risk.

Kahane says, "The slippery slope fallacy is committed only when we accept without further justification or argument that once the first step is taken, the others are going to follow, or that whatever would justify the first step would in fact justify the rest."&lt;ref name="Kahane 2001 p.84 "/&gt; The problem then arises as to how to evaluate the likelihood that certain steps would follow.

Volokh's article "The Mechanisms of the Slippery Slope"&lt;ref name="Volokh 2003"/&gt; sets out to examine the various ways in which making one decision might render another decision more likely. He considers such things as implementing A making B more cost effective and implementing A changing attitudes such that acceptance of B will become more likely. He says, "If you are faced with the pragmatic question "Does it make sense for me to support A, given that it might lead others to support B?," you should consider all the mechanisms through which A might lead to B, whether they are logical or psychological, judicial or legislative, gradual or sudden ... You should think about the entire range of possible ways that A can change the conditions—whether those conditions are public attitudes, political alignments, costs and benefits, or what have you—under which others will consider B."&lt;ref name="Volokh 2003"/&gt;{{rp|1030–1031}} Volokh concludes by claiming that the analysis in his article "implicitly rebuts the argument that slippery slope arguments are inherently logically fallacious: the claim that A's will inevitably lead to B's as a matter of logical compulsion might be mistaken, but the more modest claim that A's may make B's more likely seems plausible."&lt;ref name="Volokh 2003"/&gt;{{rp|1134}} A similar conclusion was reached by Corner et al., who after investigating the psychological mechanism of the slippery slope argument say, "Despite their philosophical notoriety, SSAs are used (and seem to be accepted) in a wide variety of practical contexts. The experimental evidence reported in this paper suggests that in some circumstances, their practical acceptability can be justified, not just because the decision-theoretic framework renders them subjectively rational, but also because it is demonstrated how, objectively, the slippery slopes they claim do in fact exist.&lt;ref name="Corner Hahn Oaksford 2011"/&gt;{{rp|147}}

'''TanDEM-X''' ('''T'''erraSAR-X '''a'''dd-o'''n''' for '''D'''igital '''E'''levation '''M'''easurement) is the name of [[TerraSAR-X]]'s twin satellite, a German Earth observation satellite using SAR ([[Synthetic Aperture Radar]]) - a modern radar imaging technology.  Implemented in a Public-Private-Partnership between the German Aerospace centre ([[DLR Institute for Planetary Research|DLR]]) and [[EADS Astrium]] (now [[Airbus Defence and Space]]), it is a second, almost identical spacecraft to TerraSAR-X. TanDEM-X is also the name of the satellite mission flying the two satellites in a closely controlled formation with typical distances between 250 and 500 m.&lt;ref name=dlr1&gt;[[German Aerospace Center]]. [http://www.dlr.de/hr/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-2317/ TanDEM-X - A New High Resolution Interferometric SAR Mission] Verified 2010-10-16.&lt;/ref&gt; This unique twin satellite constellation will allow the generation of  the [[WorldDEM]], the seamless global digital elevation models available from 2014.

==Mission==
The primary mission objective is the generation of WorldDEM,  a consistent global [[Digital Elevation Model]] (DEM) with an unprecedented accuracy according to better than [[DTED]] Level 2 specifications. WorldDEM resolution will correspond to DTED Level 3 (post spacing of better than 12 meters) and a height accuracy of better than 2m  (relative)- a standard not yet defined. Digital Elevation Models of posting better than DTED Level 2 are often called HRTI (High Resolution Terrain Information) DEM.&lt;ref name="dlr1"/&gt;

== WorldDEM ==
With an unprecedented accuracy, coverage and quality, WorldDEM is a consistent DEM of the Earth’s entire land surface, acquired and generated within three years after launch. Available from 2014, WorldDEM is to feature a vertical accuracy of 2m (relative) and 4m (absolute), within a horizontal raster of approximately 12x12 square meters, slightly varying depending on the geographic latitude. Infoterra GmbH, a 100% subsidiary of Astrium, holds the exclusive commercial marketing rights for the WorldDEM and is responsible for the adaptation of the elevation model to the needs of commercial users worldwide. Accuracy over forested areas is unknown at this time however.

== First 3D Image ==
Researchers at the German Aerospace Center facility in [[Oberpfaffenhofen]] published the first 3D images from the TanDEM-X satellite mission.  A group of Russian islands of the [[Severnaya Zemlya]] group in the Arctic Ocean was selected for the first test.&lt;ref&gt;[[German Aerospace Center]].

The rocks comprising Patagonia occurred along the southwestern margin of the ancient [[supercontinent]] of [[Gondwana]].

Patagonia contain two ancient regions: the [[North Patagonian Massif]] and [[Deseado Massif]].

Prior to the collision of Patagonia, the nucleus of modern-day South America was contained within a portion of the southwest margin of [[Gondwana]].

== Early Paleozoic ==
The Early Paleozoic tectonic regime in southwestern Gondwana involved a period of rifting during the Cambrian which affected the southern margin of the supercontinent, while at the same time the western margin experienced a compressional setting that saw the accretion of several exotic terranes.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; It has been hypothesized that following the Cambrian rifting event the Patagonian landmass collided with Antarctica,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; though evidence for this event is not conclusive.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pankhurst|first=R.

=== Cambrian rifting ===
Early Cambrian rifting of the southwestern Gondwana margin is evidenced by the presence of [[granite]]s bearing an extensional [[Geochemistry|geochemical]] signature in the [[Sierra de la Ventana (mountains)|Sierra de la Ventana]] fold belt north of the Patagonian limits.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The occurrence of this rifting event is also documented in the [[Ellsworth Mountains]] of Antarctica, the [[Cape Fold Belt]] of South Africa, and the Falkland/Malvinas microplate (present day [[Falkland Islands]]), and resulted in the formation of a proto-Pacific passive margin.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This rifting stage formed the final outline of southern Gondwana and is thought to have been the beginning of the supercontinent stage in Gondwana.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Evidence found in rocks in the [[Tierra del Fuego]] region indicates that this Cambrian rifting event might have resulted in the separation of the southern tip of South America from Gondwana.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;[[File:Southern Gondwana.png|thumb|The Cambrian rifting event in southwestern Gondwana, which included at least a portion of Patagonia.|227x227px]]

This rifting event and the detachment of a portion of Patagonia are agreed upon by the two prominent theories regarding Patagonia's origin; however, they disagree on the extent of the displaced terrane. The theory supporting an allochthonous Patagonia cites the entirety of the region, including the North Patagonian Massif, as being separated from southwestern Gondwana.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Comparison of the [[Paleomagnetism|paleomagnetic]] poles of Patagonia and Gondwana from the [[Devonian]] to [[Permian]] periods allows for the separation of the two landmasses by up to 1000 kilometres;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; however, though such a separation is permitted by the evidence, it is not required in order to explain differences in the pole positions.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The autochthonous theory meanwhile states that the North Patagonian Massif was not separated during this event, and suggests that rifting resulted only in the separation of a terrane represented by the Deseado Massif.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The large, continuous passive margin produced during this rifting event led to the formation of several associated basins. [[Sediment]]s derived from Gondwana infilled these basins throughout the early Paleozoic until the Devonian period, resulting in the accumulation of thick sedimentary units which later underwent extensive deformation due to the transition to a compressional tectonic regime.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Collision of Exotic Terranes ===
While rifting was occurring in the southern portion of Gondwana, the margin further west (along the proto-Andean belt) was experiencing a compressional regime that introduced several allochthonous terranes to the western margin of South America.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The first of these, the Pampean orogeny (mentioned above), resulted in the accretion of the Pampia terrane. This was followed by the formation of the Famatina-Eastern Puna [[Volcanic arc|magmatic arc]] during the [[Famatinian orogeny]] in the [[Ordovician]] period, which culminated in the accretion of the [[Cuyania]] (Precordillera) terrane.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Paleomagnetic evidence suggests that this Cuyania terrane is of Laurentian origin,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and it has been hypothesized that the terrane may have been a plateau attached to [[Laurentia]] which was involved in the Cambrian rifting event and later accreted during collision between Laurentia and Gondwana.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Geochronology|Geochronological]] evidence shows that the Famatinian magmatic belt extends south from the Andean margin into the North Patagonian massif,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and paleomagnetic studies of these rocks indicate that separation between these bodies has not occurred at least since the Devonian,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gregori|first=Daniel A.|last2=Kostadinoff|first2=José|last3=Strazzere|first3=Leonardo|last4=Raniolo|first4=Ariel|date=2008-10-01|title=Tectonic significance and consequences of the Gondwanide orogeny in northern Patagonia, Argentina|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1342937X08000956|journal=Gondwana Research|volume=14|issue=3|pages=429–450|doi=10.1016/j.gr.2008.04.005|bibcode=2008GondR..14..429G}}&lt;/ref&gt; both lending support to the theory of an autochthonous component of Patagonia.

=== Patagonia-Antarctica collision ===
Following the early Cambrian rifting event, Antarctica underwent a deformational event resulting in uplift of the [[Transantarctic Mountains]] in the mid-Cambrian, an event that has been ascribed to the [[Ross orogeny]].&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; It has recently been proposed that during middle to late Cambrian times Patagonia was accreted to East Antarctica,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; an event that led to the initiation of the Ross orogeny. Following this collision, a transition to extension in the late Ordovician-[[Silurian]] resulted in the separation of Patagonia from Antarctica and the formation of a passive margin. Deposition along this passive margin is represented by the Devonian-age lower section of the [[Beacon Supergroup]]. Proposed evidence for this connection exists in both the North Patagonian and Deseado Massifs, where remnants of the fossil species of [[archeocyathids]] have been discovered, a species preserved in the Shackleton Limestone of the Transantarctic Mountains.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Additionally, segments of the Sierra Grande Formation in both massifs show possible correlation with the Beacon Supergroup bearing a common Devonian age. Correlation between granites found in northeastern Patagonia and others involved in the Ross orogeny has also been suggested, but such a connection is lacking geochronological evidence.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Late Paleozoic ==
=== Carboniferous-Permian collision ===
Lasting throughout the early to middle Paleozoic, rifting in the region was interrupted in the mid-Devonian when the tectonic scheme switched from an [[extensional tectonics|extensional]] to compressional one, a process that resulted in the collision of the Patagonian terrane with the southwestern Gondwanan margin. Subduction-related igneous rocks from beneath the North Patagonian Massif have been dated at 320–330 million years old, indicating that the subduction process initiated in the early Carboniferous.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This was relatively short lived (lasting about 20 million years), and initial contact of the two landmasses occurred in the mid-Carboniferous,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; with broader collision during the early Permian.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This collision resulted in the formation of two distinct magmatic and [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] belts in the North Patagonian Massif, one in the north and one in the west.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Isotopic dating of [[zircon]] from the [[magmatic belt]]s provides evidence that the activity forming the western magmatic arc ceased during the late Carboniferous and may have involved collision of the Antarctic Peninsula with the southwest margin.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Deformation and metamorphism resulting from this terrane collision may have begun in the late Carboniferous period&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and continued into the Permian period. Such deformation is postulated to have had a role in the initiation of the [[Gondwanide orogeny|Gondwanide Orogeny]] and formation of the Gondwanide Fold Belt, which includes the [[Sierra de la Ventana]] mountains north of Patagonia and the [[Cape Fold Belt]] of South Africa.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The collisions in this portion of the southwest margin of Gondwana during this time were likely the precursor to the [[Terra Australis Orogen|Terra Australis orogen]] that later affected this region.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Also in the Late Paleozoic the two main landmasses of Patagonia; the North Patagonian Massif and Deseado Massif inferred to have [[continental collision|collided]] following a period of subduction of the plate of Deseado Massif beneath the plate containing the North Patagonian Massif. This subduction is postulated to have [[subduction erosion|eroded]] the [[Subcontinental lithospheric mantle|lithospheric mantle]] beneath the North Patagonian Massif.&lt;ref name=Schillingetal2017/&gt;{{efn-ua|The removal of the Precambrian lithospheric mantle of the North Patagonian Massif might explain why this region is poorer in [[gold]] compared to the Deseado Massif. This could be so since gold at Earth's surface comes ultimately from the mantle, but not all parcels of the mantle are equally rich in gold.&lt;ref name=Schillingetal2017/&gt;}}     

As the prominent tectonic models for Patagonian accretion to Gondwana differ in their interpretation of the extent of the terrane that was detached during the Cambrian rifting, by definition they disagree on the extent of the terrane that was accreted in the Permian.[[File:Late Paleozoic Collision of Patagonia.png|thumb|The two primary models for the collision of the Patagonian terrane against Gondwana in the late Paleozoic period: the allochthonous theory (above) and the autochthonous theory (below).|334x334px]]

==== Allochthonous theory ====
The allochthonous theory hypothesizes that the entirety of Patagonia, including both basement massifs were separated from Gondwana during rifting in the Cambrian.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; One version of this model includes a hypothetical independent collision of the two massifs following rifting in the Cambrian to form the Patagonia terrane prior to its eventual collision with Gondwana.&lt;ref&gt;Ramos, V. A. (2004). La Plataforma Patagónica y sus relaciones con la Plataforma Brasilera. ''Mantesso-Neto, V., Bartorelli, A., Carneiro, CDR, and Brito-Neves, BB (Eds.). Geologia do Continente Sul-Americano, Sao Paulo,'' vol. 22, pp. 371–381.&lt;/ref&gt; The two magmatic belts found in the North Patagonian Massif are inferred to represent collision of this portion of Patagonia against the margin of Gondwana following the closure of an ocean basin during convergence and subduction.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; By this model, the western belt in the North Patagonian Massif would have been formed due to subduction of oceanic crust under its southern margin, with termination of subduction resulting from collision of the Antarctic Peninsula during the mid-late Carboniferous. Meanwhile, the northern belt would have been created during subduction of oceanic crust underneath its northern margin. [[Geophysics|Geophysical]] studies in the region discovered a large subsurface structure along the northern Patagonian border, which cuts off the suture boundaries between the Rio de la Plata craton and its westward accreted terranes. This feature has been hypothesized as representing the suture zone of Patagonia with Gondwana.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Autochthonous theory ====
According to the autochthonous theory, the North Patagonian Massif is an autochthonous portion of former Gondwana that has been in its current position since at least the Ordovician.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Deseado Massif, however, is believed to be an allochthonous (or parautochthonous) component, detached from Gondwana during the Cambrian rifting episode and accreted again in the Permian. There is evidence that crustal magnetic signatures on either side of the Huincul fault zone are the same, indicating the North Patagonian Massif and southwestern Gondwana may have been one continuous landmass through the Paleozoic.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The late Paleozoic collision then is believed to have occurred between the Deseado Massif and the southwestern edge of the North Patagonian Massif, with oceanic crust being subducted below the southern margin of the North Patagonian Massif to form the observed magmatic belts in that region.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Late Permian break off of the subducting slab resulted in upwelling of the mantle and extensive melting of the crust followed by a transition to [[post-orogenic collapse]], an episode which is preserved in the [[Choiyoi Group]] volcanic province.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; There is a possibility that the collision of the Deseado Massif terrane with the Gondwana margin may have produced a tear in the subducting slab, leading to its eventual break-off.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Mesozoic extension ==

=== Rifting of Gondwana ===
Following the period of late Paleozoic convergence that led to the collision of Patagonia with Gondwana, a transition to extensional tectonics in the Triassic period induced rifting within Patagonia.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; This extension began northwest of Patagonia along the pre-existing suture zone between the Chilenia and Cuyania terranes and led to the formation of the [[Cuyo Basin|Cuyo basin]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Giambiagi|first=Laura|last2=Martinez|first2=Amancay N.|date=2008-11-01|title=Permo-Triassic oblique extension in the Potrerillos-Uspallata area, western Argentina|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895981108000813|journal=Journal of South American Earth Sciences|volume=26|issue=3|pages=252–260|doi=10.1016/j.jsames.2008.08.008|bibcode=2008JSAES..26..252G}}&lt;/ref&gt; More widespread rifting began in the Jurassic, by which time the breakup of Gondwana was underway.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This was accompanied by the initiation and evolution of the Southern Atlantic rift system which led to the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The extension led to formation of fault-bounded basins, including the Cañadon Asfalto Basin&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; and Rocas Verdes Basin.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Though initially a continental rift basin, the Rocas Verdes Basin transitioned to a [[back-arc basin]] with the introduction of [[oceanic crust|proto-oceanic crust]], for which evidence is preserved in the Sarmiento and Tortuga [[ophiolite]] sequences.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Rotations within Patagonia ===
During the early breakup of Gondwana and associated continental rifting, the Patagonian landmass underwent large-scale rotations. Paleomagnetic data from late Jurassic-early Cretaceous rocks in the southern portion of the North Patagonian Massif indicate that clockwise rotation of up to 30 degrees occurred in that area during the Early Cretaceous, affecting a crustal block at least tens of kilometers in size.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Additional findings from within the Deseado Massif revealed that similar rotations occurred in that area as well, either during the same Early Cretaceous episode or in an earlier deformational event during the Late Jurassic.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Similar processes are reported to have affected the Falkland Islands, and may have been operating at the same time as those in Patagonia.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The mechanism behind these rotations is unclear, and evidence of associated deformational structures is scarce. It has been proposed that the [[Gastre Fault|Gastre Fault System]] is one such structure that accommodated much of the deformation involved with crustal rotations;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; however, this hypothesis lacks supporting evidence.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== Cretaceous-Cenozoic ==

=== Compression and foreland basin formation ===
During the Cretaceous, accelerating spreading rates of mid-ocean ridges in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans as well as increased subduction below the western margin caused a shift from extensional tectonics towards compression, concurrent with the initiation of the Andean orogeny.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This transition resulted in [[Inversion (geology)|inversion]] of the Rocas Verdes Basin and ultimately led to its closure in the Late Cretaceous. Associated with closure of the basin was the development of the Andean [[fold and thrust belt]]. Deep-water sediment deposition during the Late Cretaceous contractional phase formed the thick Cerro Toro Formation, and subsequent formations record the progressive movement of deposition from deep-water to shallow-water and ultimately [[River delta|deltaic]] environments.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Basin uplift and deformation ===
Continued compression through the [[Tertiary]] period and the associated horizontal shortening resulted in uplift and associated deformation of the Andean fold and thrust belt and provided exposure of formations within the [[Magallanes Basin]].&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Though the sequence of deformational events leading to the present day formation is unclear, observational evidence from the region indicates that there were three notable periods of deformation, occurring in the Late Cretaceous period, the [[Oligocene|Oligocene epoch]], and some time following the [[Miocene|Miocene epoch]].&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Reconstructions of the events that resulted in deformation of the basin are complicated by variability in the style and extent of deformation along the Patagonian Andes, ranging from intense folding and steep thrust faulting with accompanying metamorphism to broad fold sequences lacking metamorphism.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; However, evidence from sedimentary relationships and the absolute dating of igneous rocks cutting across sedimentary layers allow for the inference of the relative ages given above. Additional data from the dating of metamorphosed layers provide bracket ages for the timing of exhumation of the Magallanes Basin, and suggest that this basin, as well as the Andean fold-thrust belt, were exhumed from below the surface between 10 and 4 million years ago.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

The Antarctic Plate started to [[subduction|subduct]] beneath South American 14 million years ago in the [[Miocene|Miocene epoch]]. At first it subducted only in the southernmost tip of Patagonia, meaning that the [[Chile Triple Junction]] lay near the [[Strait of Magellan]]. As the southern part of the [[Nazca Plate]] and the [[Chile Rise]] became consumed by subduction the more northerly regions of the Antarctic Plate began to subduct beneath Patagonia so that the Chile Triple Junction lies at present offshore [[Taitao Peninsula]] at 46°15' S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author-last=Cande|author-first=S.C.|author-last2=Leslie|author-first2=R.B.  |date=1986|title=Late Cenozoic Tectonics of the Southern Chile Trench|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research-Solid Earth and Planets |volume=91|issue=|pages= 471–496}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pedojaetal2011/&gt;

===Quaternary tectonics===
The eastern coast of Patagonia has experienced some considerable uplift during the [[Pleistocene]] as evidenced by [[marine terrace]]s and beaches found above sea level. Uplift rates eastern coast of Patagonia exceeds those of the Atlantic coast of South America (except [[Recife]]). Uplift in Patagonia contrast starkly with the Río de la Plata which has been a region of [[subsidence]]. The causes of the uplift trend have been attributed to a decreased [[dynamic topography|downward drag induced by flow]] in [[mantle (geology)|Earth's mantle]] beneath Patagonia. This change is in turn derived from the [[Deep time|geologically recent]] [[subduction]] of the [[Antarctic Plate]] beneath South America, which as a new subducting plate with a short subducting slab, would have less capacity to induce flow in Earth's mantle.&lt;ref name=Pedojaetal2011&gt;{{cite journal|author-last=Pedoja|author-first=Kevin|author-last2=Regard|author-first2=Vincent |author-last3=Husson|author-first3=Laurent | author-last4=Martinod|author-first4=Joseph| author-last5=Guillaume|author-first5=Benjamin| author-last6=Fucks|author-first6=Enrique| author-last7=Iglesias|author-first7=Maximiliano| author-last8=Weill|author-first8=Pierre |date=2011|title=Uplift of quaternary shorelines in eastern Patagonia: Darwin revisited |journal=[[Geomorphology (journal)|Geomorphology]] |volume=127 |issue=|pages=121–142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''TopoFusion''' [[GPS]] Mapping [[software]] designed to plan and analyze [[trail]]s using [[topographic map]]s and [[GPS tracking unit|GPS tracks]].

==History==

The software was created in 2002 by two brothers who were outdoor [[bikepacking]] enthusiasts and felt software could help them plan better [[trail]]s.&lt;ref name="BP-review"/&gt;  They developed the first version of the software in 2002 and one included it as part of his doctorate dissertation on ''GPS Driven Trail Simulation and Network Production''.&lt;ref name="SM-thesis"/&gt;  In 2004 the developers and one other jointly presented the paper ''Digital Trail Libraries'' which illustrated some of the [[graph theory]] [[algorithm]]s used by the software.&lt;ref name="DTL-paper-2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lauer-Zipf"/&gt;  {{As of|2018}} the software remains supported with refined functionality and improved support for additional maps and GPS Devices.&lt;ref name=&lt;ref name="TopoF-revhist"/&gt;

==Features==
The software was designed to plan and analyze trails.&lt;ref name="TopoF-about"/&gt;  When used for planning proposed routes may be planned and checked against different maps, and the result(s) downloaded to a [[GPS tracking unit|GPS tracking device]].&lt;ref name="TopoF-about"/&gt;  Topofusion is particularly noted for eased of switch and combining maps and for capability of simultaneously managing multiple trails.&lt;ref name="DogHouse"/&gt;  After a trail has been executed the resultant GPS log can be uploaded to TopoFusion and the actual route analyzed with the addition of any photographic images recorded on route.&lt;ref name="TopoF-about"/&gt;

The product is marketed as a fully featured 'professional version and a more basic version with reduced functionality at lower cost.  A fully featured trial version which is not time limited is available which restricts usability by [[watermark|watermarking]] map display tiles by overlaying the word 'DEMO'.&lt;ref name="TopoF-down"/&gt;  The software is available directly Microsoft Windows only,&lt;ref name="Dummy-GPS"/&gt; however TopoFusion has claimed users have reported success using [[VMWare Fusion]] and [[Parallels Desktop for Mac|Parallels]] emulation on Mac OS.&lt;ref name="BP-review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TopoF-faq"/&gt;

==Applications==
TopoFusion has been found useful by those engaged in the sport of [[geocaching]].&lt;ref name="Dummy-GEO"/&gt;

The software has been used in assisting analysis of GPS routes.  A survey reported in 2004 of GPS tracking of motorists visiting the [[Acadia National Park]] in [[Maine]], United States was assisted by use of Topofusion to review the scenes visited.&lt;ref name="GPS4free"/&gt;  It has also been used in studies of agriculture transportation logistics.&lt;ref name="Lauer-Zipf"/&gt;

TopoFusion can also assist in determining where photographs have been taken on a trail and can [[geocoding|geocoded photo]] the image or tag it onto a map.  For this to be successful the digital camera's time must be synchronized with the GPS unit time, and both the GPS track and digital images made available to Topofusion.  The time when the image was taken can then be matched to the time on the GPS log and this enables the image to be enhanced with geocode fields when [[Real-time geotagging]] was not available when the image was taken.  TopoFusion can also optionally [[annotate]] maps with images.&lt;ref name="Hacks"/&gt;

[[File:Image of Outrigger Watercraft in Marshall or Caroline Islands (Before 1911).png|thumb|300px|''Wa'' in the [[Marshall Islands]]/[[Caroline Islands]] area, prior to 1911]]
'''''Wa''''' are a traditional [[proa]]-style [[sailing]] [[outrigger canoe]] of the [[Caroline Islands]].{{sfn|Doran|1972|pages=144–159}} They have a single outrigger.{{sfn|Doran|1972|pages=144–159}}{{sfn|Hornell|1932|pages=131–143}}

==Design and construction==
[[File:Making paddle with adze, Tobi, Western Caroline Islands, Micronesia.jpg|thumb|Islander of [[Tobi (island)|Tobi]], [[Palau]], making a paddle with an adze]]
[[File:Lithograph of Caroline Islands Wa Watercraft - Admiral Fracois-Edmond Paris (1826-1829).png|thumb|right|Plan of a Caroline Islands ''wa'' featuring sunshades. Lithograph by [[François-Edmond Pâris|Admiral François-Edmond Pâris]], ca. 1826&amp;ndash;1829.]]
''Wa'' are [[proa]] — vessels with identical bow and aft, allowing the craft to reverse without turning.{{efn-ua|"How dextrously they are fitted for ranging this collection of Islands called the Ladrones: since as these Islands bear nearly N and S of each other, and are all within the limits of the trade winds, the Proas, by sailing most excellently on a wind, and with either end foremost, can run from one of these Islands to the other and back again, only by shifting the sail, without even putting about; and by the flatness of their lee side, and their small breadth, they are capable of lying much nearer the wind than any vessel hitherto known, and thereby have an advantage, which no vessels that go large can ever pretend to: The advantage I mean is that of running with a velocity nearly as great, and perhaps sometimes greater than what the wind blows with."{{sfn|Parsonson|Golson|1962|page=29}}}}
They are made from hewn-out hulls, typically [[breadfruit]] trunks,{{efn-ua|"[[Repunglug]] and [[Repunglap]] chose to use a canoe belonging to their clan and it was made ready for the voyage. The canoe, adzed from breadfruit planks in the traditional Carolinian manner, is approximately 26 feet long, and at the time was equipped with a canvas sail."{{sfn|McCoy|1973|page=355}}}} with single wide top-[[strake]]s, and carved head and stern pieces.{{efn-ua|"These hewn-out hulls with single wide top-strakes sewn on, and carved head and stern pieces, remind us of New Zealand craft."{{sfn|Morrell|2014|pages=340–341}}}} [[Sail]]s are [[lateen]] rigged{{efn-ua|"The sail is of the lateen form, with two yards, and the mast nearly upright"{{sfn|Morrell|2014|pages=340–341}}}} and were traditionally made of [[pandanus]] mat [[sailcloth]].{{sfn|McCoy|1973|pages=355–365}} [[Benjamin Morrell]] recorded in the 1830s that sails were "made in small pieces of about three feet square, sewed together. In cutting the sail to its proper shape, the pieces which come off one side answer to go on the other; this gives it the proper form, and causes the halliards to be bent on in the middle of the yard."{{efn-ua|"The sails are made in small pieces of about three feet square, sewed together. In cutting the sail to its proper shape, the pieces which come off one side answer to go on the other; this gives it the proper form, and causes the halliards to be bent on in the middle of the yard."{{sfn|Morrell|2014|pages=340–341}}}} After [[World War II]] sails switched to [[canvas]], and after 1973 the use of [[dacron]] began to increase.{{efn-ua|"As of 1973, all canoes on [[Satawal]] were using [[dacron]] sails sewn by the men themselves. Most Carolinian canoes had used canvas acquired during the Japanese presence in the islands. The people of Satawal, however, were reluctant to switch from the cumbersome [[pandanus]]-mat sails, probably because canoes and voyaging were included in the elaborate pre-Christian taboo system. Christianity took hold on Satawal during the decades after World War II, and the islanders then used canvas. When I and Gary Mount, as Peace Corps volunteers, demonstrated the obvious superiority of dacron over canvas with only a 4-inch square sample, the men agreed to purchase sails for the canoes of the island. As word of the superiority of dacron spread, the people of [[Ifalik]], [[Elato]], [[Woleai]], [[Pulusuk]], [[Pulap]] and [[Puluwat]] have equipped at least one canoe on each island with dacron."{{sfn|McCoy|1973|page=365, note 7}}}}

Early accounts agreed upon "a [[leeward|lee]]-platform on the side opposite to the [[outrigger]]-frame, which also has a large platform of poles laid athwart its booms, whereon men are stationed to counterbalance any excessive [[heeling (sailing)|heeling]] over toward the lee side when the wind increases in force".{{sfn|Hornell|1932|pages=131–143}} The windward float stabilizes the craft. This occurs "by its weight rather than its buoyancy. When the float becomes submerged in a wave its increased drag swings the canoe slightly around into the wind, thereby relieving some of the wind pressure on the sail. The canoe slows down temporarily and allows the float to rise again."{{efn-ua|"The outrigger with its float also adds considerably to the sailing performance, as it is always turned windward. As Gladwin points out in reference to Caroline Island canoes, this 'is done so that the force of the wind on the sail will tend to lift the outrigger float out of the water, not push it down'. Thus the float acts as a stabilising agent by its weight rather than its buoyancy. When the float becomes submerged in a wave its increased drag swings the canoe slightly around into the wind, thereby relieving some of the wind pressure on the sail. The canoe slows down temporarily and allows the float to rise again."{{sfn|Lauer|1970|pages=393}}}} This design feature also acts to reduce drift by tending to place the wind toward the [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] or side of the craft.{{efn-ua|"an outrigger canoe will tend to position itself with the wind on the beam and thus lessen the drift" {{sfn|McCoy|1973|page=359}}}}

On [[Poluwat]], the skill of canoe building is called ''héllap'' ("great rigging"), and different schools of canoe carpentry include  ''hálinruk'' ("Rope of [[Chuuk State|Truk]]") and ''hálinpátu'' ("Rope of [[Pattiw|the four Western Islands]]").{{efn-ua|"Non-''yitang'' knowledge is organised differently. Some skills are called ''háák'' (pandanus mat), e.g., ''hákinpwe'' (mat of divination). Or the word for the sleeping mat, ''loh'', may be used, e.g., ''lohanppalô'' (mat of navigator). Tawuweru refers to his non-''yitang'' navigational knowledge as his ''kiyen nóómw'' (mat of the atoll; ''kiy-'' is another name for pandanus mat and is most commonly used as a possessive classifier for such mats). The skill of canoe building is called a"rigging", ''Héllap'' (Great rigging), as are the different schools of canoe carpentry, e.g., ''Hálinruk'' (Rope of Truk), ''Hálinpátu'' (Rope of the four Western Islands).{{sfn|Riesenberg|Elbert|1971|page=220}}}}

==Speed and means of propulsion==
''Wa'' may be sailed over long distances, paddled, or moved by [[Punt (boat)#Punting technique|punting]].&lt;ref&gt;National Geographic, 1921.&lt;/ref&gt; One analysis of ''wa'' under sail indicated "conclusively that these primitive craft are superior to a modern boat on significant points of sailing."{{sfn|Doran|1972|pages=144–159}} They were estimated by Anson in 1776 to be able to move at or perhaps beyond wind speed, and to have better windward [[Point of sail|pointing]] ability than any craft previously encountered.{{efn-ua|"... and by the flatness of their lee side, and their small breadth, they are capable of lying much nearer the wind than any vessel hitherto known, and thereby have an advantage, which no vessels that go large can ever pretend to: The advantage I mean is that of running with a velocity nearly as great, and perhaps sometimes greater than what the wind blows with."{{sfn|Parsonson|Golson|1962|page=29}}}} Several early western observers stated they were "capable of {{convert|22|kn}} for sustained periods".{{efn-ua|"The Micronesian flying proa is said by several witnesses to have been capable of 22 knots for sustained periods."{{sfn|Parsonson|Golson|1962|page=38}}}} Edwin Doran, author of ''Wangka: Austronesian Canoe Origins'' (1981), cited a {{convert|14|kn|adj=on}} average for a ''wa'' traveling from [[Guam]] to [[Manila]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jps.auckland.ac.nz/document/Volume_92_1983/Volume_92%2C_No._2/Reviews%2C_p_269-282/p1?page=0&amp;action=searchresult&amp;target=|year=1983 |volume=92 |number=2 |pages=269–282 |accessdate=8 January 2015|title=Reviews|journal=[[Journal of the Polynesian Society]] |publisher=[[Auckland University]]|quote=Doran cites, for example, a 14-knot average for a Caroline Island canoe on a trip from Guam to Manila (p.62).}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Morrell]] reported in 1831 that he had "seen these boats going at the rate of {{convert|8|mph|spell=in}}, within four points of the wind" and that he had "no doubt but they will go at the rate of twelve or thirteen [{{Convert|13|miles|km|abbr=on}}] miles an hour in smooth water".{{efn-ua|"I have seen these boats going at the rate of eight miles an hour, within four points of the wind. But let them run large, or before the wind, with a strong breeze, and I have no doubt but they will go at the rate of twelve or thirteen miles an hour in smooth water."{{sfn|Morrell|2014|pages=340–341}}}}

In the past, voyages of {{Convert|150|miles|km|abbr=on}} across open ocean were commonplace,{{sfn|Doran|1972|pages=144–159}} and a "brisk trade" was carried on with the [[Mariana Islands]] to the north.{{efn-ua|"The people belong to the brown Polynesian stock, are strongly built, and are gentle, amiable, and intelligent; they are bold sailors, and carry on a brisk trade with the [[Mariana Islands|Ladrones]] to the north, where they have several settlements."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=The Illustrated Chambers's[sic] Encyclopædia |volume=II: Beaugency to Cataract|article=Caroline Islands|pages=782|location=[[London]]|year=1906}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Trade items included shells, [[tapa cloth]], wooden vessels, [[coir|cordage]], iron, copper, nails and knives.{{efn-ua|"In the 19th century, the people of the Carolines resumed their ancient expeditions to the Marianas, bringing with them shells, tapa, wooden vessels and cordage in exchange for pieces of iron, copper, nails and knives."{{sfn|Parsonson|Golson|1962|page=30}}}} [[Rai stones]] were brought from [[Palau]] to [[Yap]].{{efn-ua|"The natives of Yap in Micronesia went 300 miles to the Palau Islands for"stone money", great calcite disks, six to twelve feet in diameter.}} Physical evidence of contact with the [[Chamorro people]] of [[Guam]] in the far southern [[Mariana Islands]] includes pestles, fish hooks, and shell rings from the Caroline Islands."{{sfn|Parsonson|Golson|1962|page=30}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guampedia.com/carolinians-on-guam/|title=Carolinians on Guam|publisher=Guampedia|accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest documentary evidence is Friar Juan Cantova's 1721 letter to Friar William D'Aubenton in which he describes the June 19, 1721 landing of canoes from [[Woleai]] on Guam.{{efn-ua|"The first fully documented and detailed account of Carolinians on Guam was given by Fr. Juan Cantova in a letter to Fr. Wm. D'Aubenton in which he describes the landing of canoes from Woleai in the Central Carolines on Guam June 19, 1721."{{sfn|McCoy|1973|page=355}}}} During the same [[Saipan#Spanish colonial period|Spanish colonial period]], many Chamorro people died due to introduced disease or were forcibly relocated from [[Saipan]] to Guam, and Caroline Islanders emigrated to Saipan in their place.{{efn-ua|"The Carolinian people of the island of Saipan are descended from adventurers who sailed their canoes to the Marianas Islands from their atoll homes in the south. But it has been many years, almost 70 by those still able to remember, since the Carolinians of Saipan have seen the sails of canoes approach the island from their ancestral homes. 1 During the preceding centuries, the people of the Central Carolines had made contact with the Spanish on Guam and had colonised the island of Saipan."{{sfn|McCoy|1973|page=355}}}} By 1788 fleets from the Caroline Islands were sailing to Guam near annually to trade in iron and other goods.{{efn-ua|"By 1788, large groups of canoes from the Carolines were sailing to Guam almost annually for trade goods and iron."{{sfn|McCoy|1973|page=355}}}} In the same year, a canoe from Woleai arrived at Guam and told the Spanish that "they had always been trading with Guam and had only discontinued their voyaging after witnessing the cruelty of the Europeans."{{efn-ua|"There is also evidence which would seem to confirm pre-European contacts between the Carolines and Marianas.

{{cquote|The captain of a sea-going canoe in the Central Carolines commands as aids to his navigation far more than knowledge of the mountain tops that rise just above the level of the sea to form the dozen or two dozen islands that he visits. To him, the ocean's surface is studded with hundreds, perhaps thousands, of other things, whose names, locations, and relationships he knows, and which function as sea-marks for him. Some of them are real enough phenomena; some must seem to us to be in the realm of the fabulous. There are the islets, the reefs, the sandbanks; perhaps also the discoloured patch of water or the shark that is always to be found at a particular reef is also real; but then there are the two-headed whale, the hovering frigate bird with the plover constantly flying circles around it, the spirit who lives in a flame, the man in a canoe made of ferns. And all of these, the real islands and the fantastic monsters alike, are permanent geographical features; all of them are more or less useful sea-marks, all of them bear names, and all of them are seriously regarded—though not all are equally important—as navigational aids.|author=Saul H.

There are a larger number of stars grouped around the east–west axis of this navigation system – since the Caroline Islands are an east–west island chain, most voyages occur in those directions, and for seven to eight months of the year the dominant winds are north easterly.{{efn-ua|"Gladwin also points out that the large number of stars grouped around the east–west axis of this imaginary diagram is useful in sailing in the Carolines for the islands lie in an east–west chain, and most voyages are made in these directions. This is one more difficulty the men faced in their voyage, for they were sailing a course almost due north and the lack of navigational stars in that part of the sky made their allowable margin of error small indeed. However, Repunglug and the rest of his crew weren't worried, for in this instance they had the wind in their favour. During other times of the year, prevailing winds often make sailing difficult. When travelling east in the Carolines, one must often tack against the north-east trades 7 or 8 months of the year; if travelling west one has a relatively easier time. In contrast, when sailing on a northerly course (the geographical bearing from [[Saipan]] to [[Piagailoe|West Fayu]] is 353 degrees) one must wait for an easterly wind."{{sfn|McCoy|1973|page=358–359}}}} These dominant winds are referred to as ''etiu-mai-rakena-efang'' (or "a wind coming from north of east").{{efn-ua|"a true wind direction of 60&amp;ndash;70 degrees (a wind direction of Etiu-mai-rakena-efang, or 'a wind coming from north of east.'"{{sfn|McCoy|1973|page=355, note 11}}}}

The praus were liable to be overset, and both Kotzebue and de Freycinet give pictures of the trouble the crews had in righting them. [...] The Caroline praus, as de Freycinet said, were suited to the fact that in the Micronesian areas the winds in the main sailing season were not unduly violent."{{sfn|Sharp|1962|page=391}}}}

After the [[German–Spanish Treaty (1899)|German–Spanish Treaty of 1899]], inter-island voyaging was discouraged by the [[German New Guinea]] and [[Japanese settlement in the Federated States of Micronesia#Japanese colonial era .281914.E2.80.931945.29|Japanese]] colonial governments and by the commercial availability of trade goods. This discouragement was, however, not very effective.{{efn-ua|"During the occupation of the islands by first the Germans and then the Japanese, inter-island voyaging was discouraged by the foreign administrations and by the fact that trade goods were easily obtainable throughout the Carolines from ships operated by copra-buying companies. This did not stop movement between the islands, however, and today on [[Satawal]] there are four families with close marriage ties on [[Saipan]] dating from that period. None the less, the use of inter-island steamers capable of carrying passengers and cargo did much to discourage the long-distance voyages that had been undertaken during the nineteenth century to trade for iron tools and other modern commodities."{{sfn|McCoy|1973|page=356}}}}

A 1966 [[Peace Corps]] volunteer reported a fleet of 20 canoes of various sizes, that sailed from five islands within the [[Woleai]] atoll to greet an arriving ship, and stated there was only one motorboat at the time. By 1973, only a handful of the canoes were still actively sailed on Woleai, and there were more than 20 motorboats. In 1973 voyaging traditions were reportedly most alive on [[Satawal]], [[Namonabetiu]], and to a lessert extent [[Nanonuito]] and [[Ifalik]].{{efn-ua|"In all of the central Carolines, only the islanders of Satawal, and the atolls known collectively as Namonabetiu (Puluwat, Pulap, Tamatam, and Pulusuk), and to a lesser extent the Nanonuito islands, still regularly sail inter-island canoes. Occasional canoes from Ifalik to the west visit Woleai, and there is one large voyaging canoe on Elato. The state of sailing and inter-island voyaging throughout the rest of the Carolines can be typified by Woleai atoll. In discussions with the first American Peace Corps volunteer to visit the island in late 1966, he remarked about the fleet of - 364 canoes, perhaps 20 of various sizes, that sailed from five islands within the atoll to greet the arriving ship. There was one motorboat in the lagoon at the time. Today, only a handful of the canoes are still actively sailed, and there are over 20 outboard motorboats on Woleai."{{sfn|McCoy|1973|page=364–365}}}}

"Long-distance noninstrument voyaging" was still practiced in the area in the late 1980s.{{efn-ua|"even in the Caroline Islands of Micronesia, where long-distance noninstrument voyaging is an ongoing concern, Thomas (1987) suggests that we soon may witness 'the last navigator'."{{sfn|Feinberg|1991}}}}

In 2012, the charity [[Habele]] and community-based organization Waa'gey were supporting younger outer-islanders from [[Lamotrek]] to gain experience in ''wa'' building.{{efn-ua|"Habele directors and volunteers have been working to support young men from the Atoll of Lamotrek living on Yap Proper. Yap is the state capital of one of four states in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM). A club was organized in November of 2011, with weekly meetings in Gargey. The group has set itself very ambitious goals. Working with elders from the Outer Island community on Yap, club members have put coconuts husks to sea, which will be ready for local twine rope making by early 2012. They also started carving a midsize traditional dugout canoe, building towards the goal of initiating the creation a second, much larger canoe by mid 2012. Habele donors will help bear the costs of sending traditional building materials and tools from Lamotrek to Yap and back on the state owned cargo ship to facilitate the process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://habele.blogspot.com/2012/02/traditional-canoes-in-caroline-islands.html|title=Traditional Canoes in Caroline Islands |year=2010 |publisher=Habele Outer Island Education Fund |accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{efn-ua|"Men and youths on the remote Pacific atoll of Lamotrek are hard at work, carving and shaping a massive sailing canoe.

A '''waterway''' is any [[Navigability|navigable]] [[body of water]]. Broad distinctions are useful to avoid ambiguity, and disambiguation will be of varying importance depending on the nuance of the equivalent word in other languages. A first distinction is necessary between maritime shipping routes and waterways used by inland water craft. Maritime shipping routes cross oceans and seas, and some lakes, where navigability is assumed, and no engineering is required, except to provide the draft for deep-sea shipping to approach seaports ([[Channel (geography)|channels]]), or to provide a short cut across an isthmus; this is the function of [[Ship canal|ship canals]]. Dredged channels in the sea are not usually described as waterways. There is an exception to this initial distinction, essentially for legal purposes, see under [[international waters]].

Where seaports are located inland, they are approached through a waterway that could be termed "inland" but in practice is generally referred to as a "maritime waterway" (examples Seine Maritime, [[Loire Maritime]], Seeschiffahrtsstraße Elbe). The term "inland waterway" refers to navigable rivers and canals designed to be used by inland waterway craft only, implicitly of much smaller dimensions than seagoing ships.

In order for a waterway to be '''navigable''', it must meet several criteria:

* it must be deep enough to accommodate [[Ship|vessels]] loading to the design [[draft (hull)|draft]];
* it must be wide enough to allow passage of the vessels with the design width or [[beam (nautical)|beam]];
* it must be free of obstacles to navigation such as [[waterfall]]s and [[rapids]], or offer a way around them (such as [[canal lock]]s or [[boat lift]]s);
* its [[Current (stream)|current]] must be mild enough to allow vessels to make headway upstream without undue difficulty;
* the wave height (on lakes) must not exceed the value for which the class of vessel is designed.

Vessels using waterways vary from small [[animal]]-drawn [[barge]]s to immense ocean [[Tanker (ship)|tanker]]s and [[ocean liner]]s, such as [[cruise ship]]s.

== Example of classification of inland waterways ==
The European Conference of Ministers of Transport established in 1953 a classification of waterways that was later expanded to take into account the development of push-towing. Europe is a continent with a great variety of waterway characteristics, which makes this classification valuable to appreciate the different classes of waterway. There is also a remarkable variety of waterway characteristics in many countries of Asia, but there has not been any equivalent international drive for uniformity. This classification is provided by the UN Economic Commission for Europe, Inland Transport Committee, Working Party on Inland Water Transport. A low resolution version of that map is shown here.

The '''World Geodetic System''' ('''WGS''') is a standard  for use in [[cartography]], [[geodesy]], and [[satellite navigation]] including [[GPS]]. It comprises a standard [[Geographic coordinate system|coordinate system]] for the [[Earth]], a standard [[spheroid]]al reference surface (the ''datum'' or ''[[reference ellipsoid]]'') for raw [[altitude]] data, and a [[gravitation]]al [[equipotential surface]] (the ''[[geoid]]'') that defines the ''nominal sea level''.

The latest revision is '''WGS&amp;nbsp;84''' (also known as  '''WGS&amp;nbsp;1984''', '''EPSG:4326'''), established in 1984 and last revised in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www1.nga.mil/ProductsServices/GeodesyandGeophysics/WorldGeodeticSystem/Pages/default.aspx |publisher=[[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]] |title=World Geodetic System  website of the NGA ''(archived April 2012)'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402143802/https://www1.nga.mil/ProductsServices/GeodesyandGeophysics/WorldGeodeticSystem/Pages/default.aspx |archivedate=April 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Earlier schemes included '''WGS&amp;nbsp;72''', '''WGS&amp;nbsp;66''', and '''WGS&amp;nbsp;60'''.  WGS&amp;nbsp;84 is the reference coordinate system used by the [[Global Positioning System]].

==Main parameters==
The coordinate origin of WGS&amp;nbsp;84 is meant to be located at the Earth's [[center of mass]]; the uncertainty is believed to be less than 2&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://cddis.nasa.gov/926/egm96/doc/S11.HTML | publisher = [[NASA]] | title = The EGM96 Geoid Undulation with Respect to the WGS84 Ellipsoid}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WGS&amp;nbsp;84 meridian of zero longitude is the [[IERS Reference Meridian]],&lt;ref name = "Manual"&gt;[[EUROCONTROL|European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation]] and [[Institute of Geodesy and Navigation|IfEN]]: WGS&amp;nbsp;84 Implementation Manual, p. 13. 1998&lt;/ref&gt; 5.3 [[Minute of arc|arc seconds]] or {{convert|102|m|ft|}} east of the [[Greenwich meridian]] at the latitude of the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich|Royal Observatory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gpsinformation.net/main/greenwich.htm |title=Greenwich Meridan, Tracing its History |website=Gpsinformation.net |date= |accessdate=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Malys et al. 2015"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Why the Greenwich meridian moved | first1 = Stephen | last1 = Malys | first2 = John H. | last2 = Seago | first3 = Nikolaos K. | last3 = Palvis | first4 = P.

Currently, WGS&amp;nbsp;84 uses the Earth Gravitational Model 1996 ([[EGM96]]) geoid, revised in 2004.  This geoid defines the nominal sea level surface by means of a [[spherical harmonics]] series of degree 360 (which provides about 100&amp;nbsp;km latitudinal resolution near the Equator).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/wgs84/gravitymod/egm96/egm96.html |title=NGA: NGA/NASA EGM96, N=M=360 Earth Gravitational Model |website=Earth-info.nga.mil |date=2014-10-24 |accessdate=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deviations of the EGM96 geoid from the WGS&amp;nbsp;84 reference ellipsoid range from about −105&amp;nbsp;m to about +85&amp;nbsp;m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/images/ww15mgh2.gif |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923013646/http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/images/ww15mgh2.gif |archivedate=2008-09-23 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;  EGM96 differs from the original WGS&amp;nbsp;84 geoid, referred to as EGM84.

==History==
Efforts to supplement the various national [[surveying]] systems began in the 19th century with [[Friedrich Robert Helmert|F.R. Helmert's]] famous book {{lang|de|Mathematische und Physikalische Theorien der Physikalischen Geodäsie}} (''Mathematical and Physical Theories of Physical Geodesy''). [[Austria]] and [[Germany]] founded the ''Zentralbüro für die Internationale Erdmessung'' (Central Bureau of International [[Geodesy]]), and a series of global [[ellipsoid]]s of the Earth were derived (e.g., Helmert 1906, [[John Fillmore Hayford|Hayford]] 1910/ 1924).

A unified geodetic system for the whole world became essential in the 1950s for several reasons:
* International [[space science]] and the beginning of [[astronautics]].
* The lack of inter-continental geodetic information.
* The inability of the large [[geodetic system]]s, such as European Datum ([[ED50]]), [[North American Datum]] (NAD), and [[Tokyo Datum]] (TD), to provide a worldwide geo-data basis
* Need for global maps for [[navigation]], aviation, and [[geography]].
* Western [[Cold War]] preparedness necessitated a standardised, [[NATO]]-wide geospatial reference system, in accordance with the NATO [[STANAG|Standardisation Agreement]]

In the late 1950s, the [[United States Department of Defense]], together with [[scientist]]s of other institutions and countries, began to develop the needed world system to which geodetic data could be referred and compatibility established between the coordinates of widely separated sites of interest. Efforts of the U.S. Army, Navy and Air Force were combined leading to the DoD World Geodetic System 1960 (WGS&amp;nbsp;60). The term ''datum'' as used here refers to a smooth surface somewhat arbitrarily defined as zero elevation, consistent with a set of surveyor's measures of distances between various stations, and differences in elevation, all reduced to a grid of [[latitude]]s, [[longitude]]s, and [[elevation]]s. Heritage surveying methods found elevation differences from a local horizontal determined by the [[spirit level]], [[plumb-bob|plumb line]], or an equivalent device that depends on the local gravity field (see [[physical geodesy]]). As a result, the elevations in the data are referenced to the [[geoid]], a surface that is not readily found using [[satellite geodesy]]. The latter observational method is more suitable for global mapping.  Therefore, a motivation, and a substantial problem in the WGS and similar work is to patch together data that were not only made separately, for different regions, but to re-reference the elevations to an ellipsoid model rather than to the [[geoid]].

In accomplishing WGS&amp;nbsp;60, a combination of available surface [[gravity]] data, [[astro-geodetic]] data and results from  HIRAN &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.noaa.gov/stories_tales/ak7.html |title=NOAA History - Stories and Tales of the Coast &amp; Geodetic Survey - Personal Tales/Earth Measurer/Aslakson Bio |website=History.noaa.gov |date= |accessdate=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Canadian [[SHORAN]] surveys  were used to define a best-fitting [[ellipsoid]] and an earth-centered orientation for each of initially selected datum. (Every datum is relatively oriented with respect to different portions of the geoid by the astro-geodetic methods already described.)  The sole contribution of [[satellite]] data to the development of WGS&amp;nbsp;60 was a value for the [[ellipsoid]] flattening which was obtained from the nodal motion of a satellite.

[[Image:GRAVIMETRIC DATUM ORIENTATION.SVG|thumb|225px|Gravimetric datum orientation]]

Prior to WGS&amp;nbsp;60, the U.S. Army and [[U.S. Air Force]] had each developed a world system by using different approaches to the gravimetric datum orientation method.  To determine their gravimetric orientation parameters, the Air Force used the mean of the differences between the gravimetric and astro-geodetic [[vertical deflection|deflections]] and geoid heights (undulations) at specifically selected stations in the areas of the major datums. The Army performed an adjustment to minimize the difference between astro-geodetic and [[gravimetric]] [[geoid]]s. By matching the relative astro-geodetic geoids of the selected datums with an earth-centered gravimetric geoid, the selected datums were reduced to an earth-centered orientation. Since the Army and Air Force systems agreed remarkably well for the NAD, ED and TD areas, they were consolidated and became WGS&amp;nbsp;60.

==The United States Department of Defense World Geodetic System 1966==
Improvements to the global system included the Astrogeoid of [[Irene Fischer]] and the astronautic Mercury datum. In January 1966, a World Geodetic System Committee composed of representatives from the United States Army, Navy and Air Force was charged with developing an improved WGS, needed to satisfy [[map]]ping, charting and geodetic requirements. Additional surface [[gravity]] observations, results from the extension of [[triangulation]] and [[trilateration]] networks, and large amounts of [[Doppler radar|Doppler]] and [[optical]] satellite data had become available since the development of WGS 60. Using the additional data and improved techniques, WGS 66 was produced which served DoD needs for about five years after its implementation in 1967. The defining parameters of the WGS 66 Ellipsoid were the flattening (1/298.25 determined from satellite data) and the semimajor axis (6,378,145 meters determined from a combination of Doppler satellite and astro-geodetic data). A worldwide 5° &amp;times; 5° mean free air [[gravity anomaly]] field provided the basic data for producing the WGS 66 gravimetric geoid. Also, a geoid referenced to the WGS 66 Ellipsoid was derived from available astrogeodetic data to provide a detailed representation of limited land areas.

== {{anchor|WGS72}} The United States Department of Defense World Geodetic System 1972 ==
After an extensive effort over a period of approximately three years, the Department of Defense World Geodetic System 1972 was completed. Selected satellite, surface gravity and astrogeodetic data available through 1972 from both DoD and non-DoD sources were used in a Unified WGS Solution (a large scale [[least squares]] adjustment). The results of the adjustment consisted of corrections to initial station coordinates and coefficients of the gravitational field.

The largest collection of data ever used for WGS purposes was assembled, processed and applied in the development of WGS 72. Both optical and electronic satellite data were used. The electronic satellite data consisted, in part, of Doppler data provided by the U.S. Navy and cooperating non-DoD satellite tracking stations established in support of the Navy's Navigational Satellite System (NNSS). Doppler data was also available from the numerous sites established by GEOCEIVERS during 1971 and 1972. Doppler data was the primary data source for WGS 72 (see image). Additional electronic satellite data was provided by the SECOR (Sequential Collation of Range) Equatorial Network completed by the U.S. Army in 1970. Optical satellite data from the Worldwide Geometric Satellite Triangulation Program was provided by the BC-4 camera system (see image). Data from the [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]] was also used which included camera ([[Schmidt camera#Baker–Nunn|Baker–Nunn]]) and some laser ranging.

[[Image:WORLDWIDE GEOMETRIC SATELLITE TRIANGULATION NETWORK, BC-4 CAMERAS.GIF|thumb|225px|Worldwide geometric satellite triangulation network, BC-4 cameras]]

The surface gravity field used in the Unified WGS Solution consisted of a set of 410 10° &amp;times; 10° equal area mean free air gravity anomalies determined solely from terrestrial data. This gravity field includes mean anomaly values compiled directly from observed gravity data wherever the latter was available in sufficient quantity. The value for areas of sparse or no observational data were developed from geophysically compatible gravity approximations using gravity-geophysical correlation techniques. Approximately 45 percent of the 410 mean free air gravity anomaly values were determined directly from observed gravity data.

The astrogeodetic data in its basic form consists of deflection of the vertical components referred to the various national geodetic datums. These deflection values were integrated into astrogeodetic geoid charts referred to these national datums. The geoid heights contributed to the Unified WGS Solution by providing additional and more detailed data for land areas. Conventional ground survey data was included in the solution to enforce a consistent adjustment of the coordinates of neighboring observation sites of the BC-4, SECOR, Doppler and Baker–Nunn systems. Also, eight geodimeter long line precise traverses were included for the purpose of controlling the scale of the solution.

The Unified WGS Solution, as stated above, was a solution for geodetic positions and associated parameters of the gravitational field based on an optimum combination of available data. The WGS 72 ellipsoid parameters, datum shifts and other associated constants were derived separately. For the unified solution, a normal equation matrix was formed based on each of the mentioned data sets. Then, the individual normal equation matrices were combined and the resultant matrix solved to obtain the positions and the parameters.

The value for the semimajor axis (a) of the WGS 72 Ellipsoid is 6&amp;nbsp;378&amp;nbsp;135 meters. The adoption of an a-value 10 meters smaller than that for the WGS 66 Ellipsoid was based on several calculations and indicators including a combination of satellite and surface gravity data for position and gravitational field determinations. Sets of satellite derived station coordinates and gravimetric deflection of the vertical and geoid height data were used to determine local-to-geocentric datum shifts, datum rotation parameters, a datum scale parameter and a value for the semimajor axis of the WGS Ellipsoid. Eight solutions were made with the various sets of input data, both from an investigative point of view and also because of the limited number of unknowns which could be solved for in any individual solution due to computer limitations. Selected Doppler satellite tracking and astro-geodetic datum orientation stations were included in the various solutions. Based on these results and other related studies accomplished by the Committee, an a-value of 6&amp;nbsp;378&amp;nbsp;135 meters and a flattening of 1/298.26 were adopted.

In the development of local-to WGS 72 datum shifts, results from different geodetic disciplines were investigated, analyzed and compared. Those shifts adopted were based primarily on a large number of Doppler TRANET and GEOCEIVER station coordinates which were available worldwide. These coordinates had been determined using the Doppler point positioning method.

== {{anchor|WGS84}} A new World Geodetic System: WGS&amp;nbsp;84 ==
[[File:WGS_84_reference_frame_(vector_graphic).svg|thumbnail|left|WGS&amp;nbsp;84 reference frame. The oblateness of the ellipsoid is exaggerated in this image.]]
[[File:Garmin GPS at Greenwich Observatory.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Handheld GPS receiver indicating the Greenwich meridian is 0.089 arcminutes (or 5.34 arcseconds) west to the WGS&amp;nbsp;84 datum]]
In the early 1980s the need for a new world geodetic system was generally recognized by the geodetic community and also within the US Department of Defense. WGS 72 no longer provided sufficient data, information, geographic coverage, or product accuracy for all then-current and anticipated applications. The means for producing a new WGS were available in the form of improved data, increased data coverage, new data types and improved techniques. [[GRS 80]] parameters together with available Doppler, satellite laser ranging and Very Long Baseline Interferometry ([[VLBI]]) observations constituted significant new information. An outstanding new source of data had become available from satellite radar altimetry. Also available was an advanced [[least squares]] method called collocation which allowed for a consistent combination solution from different types of measurements all relative to the Earth's gravity field, i.e. geoid, gravity anomalies, deflections, dynamic Doppler, etc.

The new World Geodetic System was called WGS&amp;nbsp;84. It is the reference system used by the [[Global Positioning System]]. It is geocentric and globally consistent within ±1&amp;nbsp;m. Current geodetic realizations of the geocentric reference system family [[International Terrestrial Reference System]] (ITRS) maintained by the [[IERS]] are geocentric, and internally consistent, at the few-cm level, while still being metre-level consistent with WGS&amp;nbsp;84.

The WGS&amp;nbsp;84 originally used the GRS&amp;nbsp;80 [[reference ellipsoid]], but has undergone some minor refinements in later editions since its initial publication. Most of these refinements are important for high-precision [[Earth orbit|orbital]] calculations for satellites but have little practical effect on typical topographical uses. The following table lists the primary ellipsoid parameters.

The very small difference in the flattening thus results in a tiny difference of 0.105&amp;nbsp;mm in the semi polar axis.

===Longitudes on WGS&amp;nbsp;84===
WGS&amp;nbsp;84 uses the [[IERS Reference Meridian]] as defined by the [[International Time Bureau|Bureau International de l'Heure]],&lt;ref name = "Manual" /&gt; which was defined by compilation of star observations in different countries.

The longitude positions on WGS&amp;nbsp;84 agree with those on the older [[North American Datum|North American Datum 1927]] at roughly [[85th meridian west|85° longitude west]], in the east-central United States.

===Updates and new standards===
The latest major revision of WGS&amp;nbsp;84 is also referred to as "[[EGM96|Earth Gravitational Model 1996]]" ([[EGM96]]), first published in 1996, with revisions as recent as 2004. This model has the same reference ellipsoid as WGS&amp;nbsp;84, but has a higher-fidelity geoid (roughly 100&amp;nbsp;km resolution versus 200&amp;nbsp;km for the original WGS&amp;nbsp;84).

Many of the original authors of WGS&amp;nbsp;84 contributed to a new higher-fidelity model, called [[EGM2008]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/wgs84/gravitymod/egm2008/index.html |title=Earth Gravitational Model 2008 (EGM2008) |website=Earth-info.nga.mil |date=2013-05-06 |accessdate=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new model will have a geoid with accuracy approaching 10&amp;nbsp;cm, requiring over 4.6 million terms in the spherical expansion (versus 130,317 in EGM96 and 32,757 in WGS&amp;nbsp;84).
