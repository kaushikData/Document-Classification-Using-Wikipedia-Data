'''Access to public information''' and '''[[freedom of information]] (FOI)''' refer to the right to access information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right to access public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information Freedom of Information, UNESCO. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Access to information, just as [[media independence]] and pluralism remain critical issues in the [[Moldova|Republic of Moldova]].&lt;ref name=FH&gt;{{cite web |url=https://freedomhouse.org/article/moldova-stakeholder-submission-universal-periodic-review |title=Moldova: stakeholder Submission for the Universal Periodic Review |last= |first= |date=28 March 2016 |website=Freedomhouse.org |publisher= Freedom House|access-date=23 January 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite numerous calls for media legislation reform, the government of Moldova has not made significant steps to improve access to information according to the country's international obligations, including a convention with the [[Council of Europe]].&lt;ref name=Jurnal&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jurnal.md/en/politic/2016/10/14/access-to-information-more-and-more-difficult-in-moldova-things-that-are-in-fact-of-public-interest-are-excessively-and-abusively-kept-secret/  |title=Access to information, more and more difficult in Moldova; “Things that  are, in fact, of public interest are excessively and abusively kept secret” |last= |first= |date=14 October 2016 |website=Jurnal.md |publisher=Jurnal online |access-date=23 January 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public officials widely impede access to public information through refusals, delays or incomplete answers, without sanctions.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt; In 2014, the [[Independent Journalism Center (IJC)]] presented to Parliament amendments to improve the law on access to information, provide additional guarantees for journalists and limit unjustified limitations of access to public information by public officials. However, the draft law has not yet been adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= November 2015 |title= Report on the State of Media in Eastern Partnership Countries |url= http://archive.eap-csf.eu/assets/files/Report%20on%20state%20of%20media%20in%20EaP%20countries_Nov%202015.pdf |publisher= Eastern Partnership. Civil Society Forum |access-date= 23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Executive Director of the [[Association of Independent Press]], Petru Macovei, overall the law on access to information is good, but it is compromised by a non-collaborative attitude of the public authorities.&lt;ref name=Jurnal/&gt;

==Legal framework==

The right to access public information in guaranteed by Article 34 of the Moldovan Constitution and is regulated by the Law on Access to Information which was adopted in 2000.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rti-rating.org/wp-content/themes/twentytwelve/files/pdf/Moldova.pdf Republic of Moldova. The Law on Access Information. Retrieved 23 January 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; The law establishes that information of public interest can be requested in writing or orally. Information can be consulted at the institution’s premises or can be received stored in an electronic support or in hardcopy.  Viewing documents on the institution’s premises is free of charge, while reasonable fees can be charged for the cost of photocopying, transcribing, translating or delivering the documents.&lt;ref name=BIRN&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016 |title=Transparency in the Balkans and Moldova |url= http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/file/show/Transparency-in-the-Balkans-and-Moldova.pdf |publisher= Balkan Investigative Report Network (BIRN) |access-date= 23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the law, documents of public interest must be provided within 15 working days, which can be extended by five days in case of requests of large numbers of documents.&lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt; If the request is rejected, the applicant can exercise its right of appeal to the relevant courts, and if the court decides on behalf of the applicant, the law imposes penalties in form of fines to the government body which has violated the law.&lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt; Exceptions justifying limitation to the disclosure regime are specified in the law and include state secrets, information on the military, intelligence, economic, foreign policy or criminal proceedings, information concerning ongoing lawsuit, personal data, confidential business data, and preliminary results of scientific and technical research.&lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt;

==Access to information in practice==

In practice, compliance with the Law on Access to Information remains weak just as its implementation which is not supported by the full authority of the bodies responsible for its enforcement. The [[Ombudsman]] in Moldova has the authority to supervise the implementation of the law, but this office lacks the capacity and the resources to exercise its role.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt; Investigative journalists and civil society organisations face numerous difficulties when requesting access to public information, including obstruction by public officials, refusals and delays in replying to requests, as well as incomplete responses to requests for information.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt; To justify their denials, public officials frequently cite laws that conflict with the Law on Access to Information, in particular the Law on State Secrets and the Law on Trade Secrets.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;

One of the problem in enforcing the right to access public information is impunity, meaning that the law establishes only insignificant fines on public offices who fail to provide due access to information. Also, in many cases, the information provided by state bodies is shaped in the officials' favor, giving the impression that authorities are behaving in compliance with the law, while in fact depriving the requester the information they are seeking. Moreover, in many cases officials do not provide public interest information without the approval from a supervisor and often refuse to answers telephone calls from journalists, thus increasing the time for getting the required information.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;

Another problem concerns the costs for obtaining public information and the fees charged to the requester, despite some improvements made recently, such as the introduction of a public register through the [[E-government|E-Government]] service in 2014. This affects in particular newsrooms and investigative journalists that must pay large sums of money for getting data useful for their investigative work.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;

'''Akshardham''' (from the words ''Akshar'' meaning indestructible, and ''Dham'' meaning abode or home) is believed to be the divine abode of [[Swaminarayan]] by his [[satsangi|followers]].&lt;ref name="Williams 83"&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Raymond|title=Introduction to Swaminarayan Hinduism|year=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0 521 65279 0|pages=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The followers of Swaminarayan believe that the [[jiva]] or soul goes to Akshardham after salvation to attain [[moksha]]. 

Akshardham in actuality is a reference to a metaphysical form known as Gunatit (Like [[Brahman]]), this state or form is of euphoria whereby the followers of the Swaminarayan Sampraday reach what is known as [[Moksha]] and receive infinite peace, and happiness in this very life (Chati deha Akshardham nu sukh). This metaphysical entity or Tattva is embodied into the Satpurush who is the manifestation of Akshar and Purushottam (God), service unto the Satpurush filled with divine understanding and glory is in its entirety Moksha, in this very life as opposed to the next. &lt;ref name="Williams 239"&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Raymond|title=Introduction to Swaminarayan Hinduism|year=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0 521 65279 0|pages=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akshardham is the immortal abode of God or the abode of [[Swaminarayan]]. This is a common term used in the [[Swaminarayan]] [[Hindu]] philosophy.

The movement has an intense [[chromaticism]] with a great representation of [[ayahuasca]] experience psychedelic —a delirious artistic style that is seen strongly in the non-Amazonian pop art works of [[Pablo Amaringo]]. Originally, it is an [[mural]] art that blends prominently the colorful amazonian culture, European motifs and commercial characters, which could be influenced by American [[pop art]] when the era of [[cable television]] came to the city, like [[MTV]].&lt;ref name="El país" /&gt;

Amazonian pop art grew [[self-taught]]. Mainly started in the suburbs of Iquitos, where there was no [[art market]], or some kind of [[art school]], because that too is considered a [[naive art|naive]] style.&lt;ref name=SobrePeru /&gt;

Essentially, the Amazonian pop art originated from various mixes of popular culture Iquitos received through the media, including [[movie poster]]s, typography of [[Cinema of Mexico|film in Mexico]] and [[Bollywood|India]]. Another important feature is the visual style that originated from [[music video]]s.&lt;ref name="El país" /&gt; Typically, in most of the Amazonian pop art works is denoted [[nightclub]]s, [[bar (establishment)|bar]]s and pubs video scene. In several other compositions, it also becomes large presence of the feminine and the [[erotic]].&lt;ref name=SobrePeru /&gt;

In the visual, Amazonian pop art is divided into two categories: the ''diurnal'' works have consistent and complete colors, and the ''nocturn'' works, the most attractive, are painted with [[phosphorescent]] material —often taking infinite forms as a collection of [[neon light]]s—, that glow under [[black light]] or simple night.&lt;ref name="El país" /&gt;

Currently, several artists engaged in decorating the rustic architecture of the city —such as [[hut (dwelling)|hut]]s and [[stilt house|palafittes]]— in areas such as the [[Belén District, Maynas|Belen District]] as a method of [[artistic expression]] and cultural influence. The cultural impact of art was so attractive that comes up in cemeteries.&lt;ref name="El país" /&gt;

'''Artificial life''' (often abbreviated '''ALife''' or '''A-Life''') is a field of study wherein researchers examine [[system]]s related to natural [[life]], its processes, and its evolution, through the use of [[simulation]]s with [[computer models]], [[robotics]], and [[biochemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/artificial%20life|title=Dictionary.com definition|accessdate=2007-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discipline was named by [[Christopher Langton]], an American theoretical biologist, in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-wt1aZrGXLYC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;cd=1#v=onepage The MIT Encyclopedia of the Cognitive Sciences], The MIT Press, p.37. {{ISBN|978-0-262-73144-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three main kinds of alife,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reed.edu/~mab/publications/papers/BedauTICS03.pdf|title=Artificial life: organization, adaptation and complexity from the bottom up|author=Mark A.

== Overview ==
Artificial life studies the fundamental processes of [[living system]]s in artificial environments in order to gain a deeper understanding of the complex information processing that define such systems.  These topics are broad, but often include [[Evolutionary algorithm|evolutionary dynamics]], [[Emergence|emergent properties of collective systems]], [[Biomimetics|biomimicry]], as well as related issues about the [[Philosophy of biology|philosophy of the nature of life]] and the use of lifelike properties in artistic works.

== Philosophy ==

The modeling philosophy of artificial life strongly differs from traditional modeling by studying not only "life-as-we-know-it" but also "life-as-it-might-be".&lt;ref&gt;See Langton, C. G. 1992. [http://www.probelog.com/texts/Langton_al.pdf Artificial Life] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311225322/http://www.probelog.com/texts/Langton_al.pdf |date=March 11, 2007 }}. Addison-Wesley. ., section 1&lt;/ref&gt;

A traditional model of a biological system will focus on capturing its most important parameters. In contrast, an alife modeling approach will generally seek to decipher the most simple and general principles underlying life and implement them in a simulation. The simulation then offers the possibility to analyse new and different lifelike systems.

Vladimir Georgievich Red'ko proposed to generalize this distinction to the modeling of any process, leading to the more general distinction of "processes-as-we-know-them" and "processes-as-they-could-be".&lt;ref&gt;See Red'ko, V. G. 1999. [http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/MATHME.html Mathematical Modeling of Evolution]. in: F. Heylighen, C. Joslyn and V. Turchin (editors): Principia Cybernetica Web (Principia Cybernetica, Brussels). For the importance of ALife modeling from a cosmic perspective, see also Vidal, C. 2008.[https://arxiv.org/abs/0803.1087 The Future of Scientific Simulations: from Artificial Life to Artificial Cosmogenesis]. In Death And Anti-Death, ed. Charles Tandy, 6: Thirty Years After Kurt Gödel (1906-1978) p. 285-318. Ria University Press.)&lt;/ref&gt;

At present, the commonly accepted [[Life#Definitions|definition of life]] does not consider any current alife simulations or [[software]] to be alive, and they do not constitute part of the evolutionary process of any [[ecosystem]]. However, different opinions about artificial life's potential have arisen:

* The ''strong alife'' (cf. [[philosophy of artificial intelligence#Strong AI vs. weak AI|Strong AI]]) position states that "life is a process which can be abstracted away from any particular medium" ([[John von Neumann]]) {{citation needed|date=April 2018|reason=There seems to be no original source for this quote, and in fact if you restrict a web search to pages that don't contain the phrase artificial life, there are only a handful left.}}. Notably, [[Thomas S. Ray|Tom Ray]] declared that his program [[Tierra (computer simulation)|Tierra]] is not simulating life in a computer but synthesizing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ray|first1=Thomas|authorlink1=Thomas S. Ray|editor1-last=Taylor|editor1-first=C. C.|editor2-last=Farmer|editor2-first=J. D.|editor3-last=Rasmussen|editor3-first=S|title=An approach to the synthesis of life|journal=Artificial Life II, Santa Fe Institute Studies in the Sciences of Complexity|date=1991|volume=XI|pages=371–408|url=http://life.ou.edu/pubs/alife2/tierra.tex|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Redwood City, CA|language=English|quote=The intent of this work is to synthesize rather than simulate life.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711051305/http://life.ou.edu/pubs/alife2/tierra.tex|archivedate=2015-07-11|accessdate=24 January 2016|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''weak alife'' position denies the possibility of generating a "living process" outside of a chemical solution. Its researchers try instead to simulate life processes to understand the underlying mechanics of biological phenomena.

==Software-based ("soft")==

=== Techniques ===
*[[cellular automaton|Cellular automata]] were used in the early days of artificial life, and are still often used for ease of [[scalability]] and [[parallelization]].  Alife and cellular automata share a closely tied history.
*[[Artificial neural network]]s are sometimes used to model the brain of an agent.  Although traditionally more of an [[artificial intelligence]] technique, neural nets can be important for simulating [[population dynamics]] of organisms that can ''learn''.  The symbiosis between learning and evolution is central to theories about the development of instincts in organisms with higher neurological complexity, as in, for instance, the [[Baldwin effect]].

====Program-based====
{{Further|programming game}}
Program-based simulations contain organisms with a complex DNA language, usually [[Turing complete]].  This language is more often in the form of a computer program than actual biological DNA.  Assembly derivatives are the most common languages used. An organism "lives" when its code is executed, and there are usually various methods allowing [[self-replication]]. Mutations are generally implemented as random changes to the code. Use of [[cellular automata]] is common but not required. Another example could be an [[artificial intelligence]] and [[Multi-agent system|multi-agent system/program]].

====Module-based====
Individual modules are added to a creature.  These modules modify the creature's behaviors and characteristics either directly, by hard coding into the simulation (leg type A increases speed and metabolism), or indirectly, through the emergent interactions between a creature's modules (leg type A moves up and down with a frequency of X, which interacts with other legs to create motion).  Generally these are simulators which emphasize user creation and accessibility over mutation and evolution.

====Parameter-based====
Organisms are generally constructed with pre-defined and fixed behaviors that are controlled by various parameters that mutate.  That is, each organism contains a collection of numbers or other ''finite'' parameters. Each parameter controls one or several aspects of an organism in a well-defined way.

====Neural net–based====
These simulations have creatures that learn and grow using neural nets or a close derivative.  Emphasis is often, although not always, more on learning than on natural selection.

===Complex systems modelling===

Mathematical models of complex systems are of three types: [[black-box]] (phenomenological), [[White box (software engineering)|white-box]] (mechanistic, based on the [[first principles]]) and [[Grey box model|grey-box]] (mixtures of phenomenological and mechanistic models).&lt;ref name="Kalmykov Lev V., Kalmykov Vyacheslav L.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In black-box models, the individual-based (mechanistic) mechanisms of a complex dynamic system remain hidden. [[File:Mathematical models for complex systems.jpg|thumb|Mathematical models for complex systems]] Black-box models are completely nonmechanistic. They are phenomenological and ignore a composition and internal structure of a complex system. We cannot investigate interactions of subsystems of such a non-transparent model. A white-box model of complex dynamic system has ‘transparent walls’ and directly shows underlying mechanisms. All events at micro-, meso- and macro-levels of a dynamic system are directly visible at all stages of its white-box model evolution. In most cases mathematical modelers  use the heavy black-box mathematical methods, which cannot produce mechanistic models of complex dynamic systems. Grey-box models are intermediate and combine black-box and white-box approaches. [[File:Logical deterministic individual-based cellular automata model of single species population growth.gif|thumb|Logical deterministic individual-based cellular automata model of single species population growth]] Creation of a white-box model of complex system is associated with the problem of the necessity of an a priori basic knowledge of the modeling subject. The deterministic logical [[Cellular automaton|cellular automata]] are necessary but not sufficient condition of a white-box model. The second necessary prerequisite of a white-box model is the presence of the physical [[ontology]] of the object under study. The white-box modeling represents an automatic hyper-logical inference from the [[first principle]]s because it is completely based on the deterministic logic and axiomatic theory of the subject. The purpose of the white-box modeling is to derive from the basic axioms a more detailed, more concrete mechanistic knowledge about the dynamics of the object under study. The necessity to formulate an intrinsic [[axiomatic system]] of the subject before creating its white-box model distinguishes the cellular automata models of white-box type from cellular automata models based on arbitrary logical rules. If cellular automata rules have not been formulated from the first principles of the subject, then such a model may have a weak relevance to the real problem.&lt;ref name="Kalmykov Lev V., Kalmykov Vyacheslav L. White-box model" /&gt;

==Hardware-based ("hard")==
{{Further|Robot}}
Hardware-based artificial life mainly consist of ''robots'', that is, [[automation|automatically]] guided [[machine]]s able to do tasks on their own.

==Biochemical-based ("wet")==
{{Further|Synthetic biology}}
Biochemical-based life is studied in the field of [[synthetic biology]]. It involves e.g. the creation of [[synthetic DNA]]. The term "wet" is an extension of the term "[[wetware (brain)|wetware]]".

[[File:DickinsoniaCostata.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''[[Dickinsonia|Dickinsonia costata]]'' is one of the enigmatic [[fossil]]s, possibly an early [[animal]], in the [[Precambrian]] [[Ediacaran biota]].]]
The '''Avalon explosion''', named from the [[Precambrian]] fauna of the [[Avalon Peninsula]], is a proposed [[evolutionary radiation]] in the history of the [[Animalia]], about 575 million years ago, some 33 million years earlier than the [[Cambrian explosion]].

==Evidence==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2001">In [[general relativity]] and [[differential geometry]], the '''Bel–Robinson tensor''' is a tensor defined in the [[abstract index notation]] by:
:&lt;math&gt;T_{abcd}=C_{aecf}C_{b} {}^{e} {}_{d} {}^{f} + \frac{1}{4}\epsilon_{ae}{}^{hi} \epsilon_{b}{}^{ej}{}_{k} C_{hicf} C_{j}{}^{k}{}_{d}{}^{f}&lt;/math&gt;
Alternatively,
:&lt;math&gt;T_{abcd}=C_{aecf}C_{b} {}^{e} {}_{d} {}^{f} - \frac{3}{2} g_{a[b} C_{jk]cf} C^{jk}{}_{d}{}^{f}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;C_{abcd}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Weyl tensor]].  It was introduced by Lluís Bel in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=L.|last1=Bel|title=Introduction d'un tenseur du quatrième ordre|journal=Comptes rendus hebdomadaires des séances de l'Académie des sciences|volume=248|page=1297|year=1959|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k32002/f1321.image.langEN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=J.

Like the electromagnetic stress–energy tensor, the Bel–Robinson tensor is totally symmetric and traceless:
:&lt;math&gt;T_{abcd}=T_{(abcd)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T^{a}{}_{acd} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
In general relativity, there is no unique definition of the local energy of the gravitational field. The Bel–Robinson tensor is a possible definition for local energy, since it can be shown that whenever the [[Ricci tensor]] vanishes (i.e. in vacuum), the Bel–Robinson tensor is divergence-free:
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^{a} T_{abcd} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29702">The '''Bilingual Education Act (BEA)''' ({{USStat|81|816}}), also known as '''Title VII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Amendments of 1967''' ({{USPL|90|247}}), approved by the [[90th United States Congress]] on January 2, 1968, and was the first [[United States]] [[Act of Congress|federal legislation]] recognized the needs of [[Limited English proficiency|limited English speaking ability]] (LESA) students. The BEA was introduced in 1967 by Texas senator [[Ralph Yarborough]] and was signed by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] on January 2, 1968. While some states, such as California and Texas, and numerous local [[school districts]] around the country already had policies and programs designed to meet the special educational needs of [[Primary education in the United States|elementary]] and [[Secondary education in the United States|secondary]] school students not [[language proficiency|fluent]] in the English language, this act signaled that the federal government now also recognized the need for and value of bilingual education programs in [[State school#United States|U.S. public education]]. Passed on the heels of the Civil Rights movement, its purpose was to provide school districts with federal funds, in the form of competitive grants, to establish innovative educational programs for students with limited English speaking ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewner-Manzanares|first=Gloria|title=Bilingual Education Act: Twenty Years Later|journal=National Clearinghouse for Bilingual Education|date=Fall 1988|volume=6|pages=1|url=http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/files/rcd/BE021037/Fall88_6.pdf|accessdate=9 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415073628/http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/files/rcd/BE021037/Fall88_6.pdf|archivedate=15 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural implications==
{{Education in the U.S.}}
The BEA was a significant piece of education legislation. Its passage signaled "a shift from the notion that students should be afforded equal educational opportunity to the idea that educational policy should work to equalize academic outcomes, even if such equity demanded providing different learning environments."&lt;ref&gt;Petrzela, Natalia M. "Before the Federal Bilingual Education Act: Legislation and Lived Experience in California." Peabody Journal of Education, 85 (2010):408.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, it reflected changes in cultural perspectives towards diversity and immigration. The BEA was an important shift away from the late 1950s anticommunist sentiment where anything foreign was suspect, which had destroyed many earlier local and state attempts at bilingual education.&lt;ref&gt;Petrzela, Natalia M. "Before the Federal Bilingual Education Act: Legislation and Lived Experience in California." Peabody Journal of Education, 85 (2010): 414.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it recognized that the federal government was responsible for educating immigrants to the US and opened doors for bilingual education projects on local, state, and federal levels.

Furthermore, this legislation, successfully enacted into law largely thanks to the efforts of Spanish speakers, has become an important part of the "polemic between assimilation and multiculturalism" and the role that language education in our society.&lt;ref&gt;Wiese, Ann-Marie and Eugene E. Garcia. "The Bilingual Education Act: Language Minority Students and Equal Educational Opportunity." Bilingual Research Journal, 22 (1998):3.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the BEA in its original form promoted celebrating linguistic and cultural differences and diversity in the U.S., it in many ways challenged assimilationist theories and the "melting pot" concept of the U.S. And yet, in its final form when passed, it did not mention the important link between language and culture, leaving the language vague.

The act additionally opened up a larger need for teachers who could teach language and other content within a language besides English.  This placed a strain on the teaching pool available in 1968 and even today there is a shortage of teachers for these highly specialized positions.   Culturally, it was argued in this time period that by teaching in a certain language it also taught specific values instead of just a way of communication.&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez, Armando "Bilingual Education and the Foreign Language Teacher." Paper presented at the National Convention of the American Association of Teachers of Spanish and Portuguese (50th, San Antonio, Texas, August 28–30, 1968)., 8 (1968), http://search.proquest.com/docview/64405323&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation and funding==
When Senator Yarborough introduced the bill to the Senate in 1967, he envisioned it as a way of addressing the "'poor performance in school and high dropout rates... and great psychological harm' caused by 'English-only policies, no Spanish-speaking rules, and cultural degradation'" that was evident in many schools at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Petrzela, Natalia M. "Before the Federal Bilingual Act: Legislation and Lived Experience in California." Peadbody Journal of Education, 85: 406, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the passage of the act was a bipartisan effort on behalf of Republicans and Democrats, it underwent significant changes between 1967 and 1968. Many of these changes were in the wording and framing of the act, which ultimately did not recognize the importance of biculturalism or the benefit of bilingualism or even the link between language and culture. Rather, it framed students of LESA as a "problem" that needed to be fixed. In addition, unlike what Yarborough had conceived, it provided no funding for permanent programs regarding students of LESA, as many people feared promoting a sense of entitlement in students and families benefitting from the act.

The BEA provided school districts with federal funds, in the form of competitive grants, to establish innovative educational programs for students with limited English speaking ability. The grants that the act provided were given directly to school districts and were to be used to buy resources for educational programs, to train teachers and teachers' aides, to develop and distribute materials and to create meaningful parental involvement projects. Although the act did not require the use of bilingual instruction or the use of a student's native language, its aim was to encourage innovative programs designed to teach students English. The act also gave school districts the opportunity to provide bilingual education programs without violating segregation laws, but at this time, participation was voluntary. Program effectiveness was evaluated at the end of every year and successful programs were eligible to receive federal funding for up to five years.

Because the BEA funding was provided in the form of grants, most of the financial clout lay with local and state education agencies (LEAs and SEAs). However, the federal government limited the reach of these funds in a few significant ways. To begin with, from a simple framing standpoint, the original 1968 BEA did not include any mention of instruction in or maintenance of a student's native language, limiting the potential impact of the act.

From a financial perspective, the BEA was also limited. The only programs eligible for receiving funding were programs for children between the ages of 3 and 8. Because it was meant to redress the dropout issue, the act with this caveat on funding viewed high school students of LESA somewhat of a lost cause. In addition, the act did not fund any permanent programs for educating students of LESA, but only funding exploratory programs. As a result, it did not seek to truly address the burgeoning issue of how to educate students who were not English dominant. Lastly, the funds were at first reserved for communities whose average income was below the poverty line stated in the ESEA ($3,000 in 1968). This limitation on funding had the unfortunate side effect of framing the act as a somewhat of a handout to poor, Latino communities.&lt;ref&gt;Petrzela, Natalia M. "Before the Federal Bilingual Education Act: Legislation and Lived Experience in California." Peabody Journal of Education, 85 (2010): 411.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to many of these limitations and the vague wording of much of the BEA, funding was limited in the first three years to $85 million. By 1972, "only 100,391 students nationally, out of approximately 5,000,000 in need were enrolled in a Title VII-funded program."&lt;ref&gt;Petrzala, Natalia M. "Before the Federal Bilingual Education Act: Legislation and Lived Experience in California. Peabody Journal of Education, 85: 414.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amendments to the Bilingual Education Act==

===1974 amendments===
The Bilingual Education Act of 1968 was not specific and participation by school districts was voluntary. As a result, Civil rights activists argued that the rights of minority-language students were being violated under this act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewner-Manzanares|first=Gloria|title=Bilingual Education Act: Twenty Years Later|journal=National Clearinghouse for Bilingual Education|date=Fall 1988|volume=6|pages=1|url=http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/files/rcd/BE021037/Fall88_6.pdf|accessdate=9 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415073628/http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/files/rcd/BE021037/Fall88_6.pdf|archivedate=15 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, three amendments were made to the original act in an attempt to clarify the intent and design of programs designated for the education of LESA students. There were two significant events that impacted these changes: the Lau V. Nichols case and the Equal Educational Opportunity Act of 1974.

''[[Lau v. Nichols]]'' was a class-action suit brought against the San Francisco School District and alleged that due to their inability to speak English, there were 1,800 Chinese students who were being denied an equal education. In 1974, the Supreme Court overruled the ruling of the lower courts and determined that the same resources, teachers and curriculum did not imply that the education was equal for students who had a limited command of the English language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Developing Programs for English Language Learners: Lau v. Nichols|url=http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/files/rcd/BE021037/Fall88_6.pdf|publisher=Office for Civil Rights|accessdate=9 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415073628/http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/files/rcd/BE021037/Fall88_6.pdf|archivedate=15 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year as the Supreme Court's ruling, the Equal Education Opportunity Act was passed. By citing instructional programs as the means through which language barriers were to be broken, it effectively extended the Lau ruling to all students and school districts. Furthermore, school districts were required to have special programs for LESA students regardless of federal or state funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewner-Manzanares|first=Gloria|title=Bilingual Education Act: Twenty Years Later|journal=National Clearinghouse for Bilingual Education|date=Fall 1988|volume=6|pages=3|url=http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/files/rcd/BE021037/Fall88_6.pdf|accessdate=9 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415073628/http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/files/rcd/BE021037/Fall88_6.pdf|archivedate=15 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amendments in 1974 served to do the following: 
* define "Bilingual Education Program" as one that provided instruction in English and in the native language of the student to allow the student to progress effectively through the educational system
* define the program's goal to prepare LESA students to participate effectively in the regular classroom as quickly as possible while simultaneously maintaining the native language and culture of the student
* create regional support centers of consultants and trainers to provide support to school systems
* stipulate capacity-building efforts by providing funds to school districts' efforts to expand curricula, staff and research for bilingual programs
Funding increased from $7.5 million in 1968 to $68 million and as a result, programs were able to impact 368,000 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewner-Manzanares|first=Gloria|title=Bilingual Education Act: Twenty Years Later|journal=National Clearinghouse for Bilingual Education|date=Fall 1988|volume=6|pages=4|url=http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/files/rcd/BE021037/Fall88_6.pdf|accessdate=9 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415073628/http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/files/rcd/BE021037/Fall88_6.pdf|archivedate=15 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1978 amendments===
In 1978, further amendments were made to extend the act and broaden the definition of eligible students. Specifically, these amendments served to do the following:  
* emphasize the strictly transitional nature of native language instruction
* expand eligibility to students who are [[limited English proficient]] (LEP)
* permit  enrollment of English-speaking students in bilingual programs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chronology of Federal and State Law Impacting Language Minority Students|url=http://www2.sfasu.edu/enlace/modules/Chronology%20of%20Federal%20Law%20Guiding%20ELL%20Policy%20and%20Practice%20from%20TEA.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding increased from $68 million in 1974 to $135 million which was enough to provide funding for 565 school districts and for secondary programs including service centers, graduate school fellowships and training for undergraduate students interested in becoming bilingual educators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewner-Manzanares|first=Gloria|title=Bilingual Education Act: Twenty Years Later|journal=National Clearinghouse for Bilingual Education|date=Fall 1988|volume=6|pages=5|url=http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/files/rcd/BE021037/Fall88_6.pdf|accessdate=9 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415073628/http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/files/rcd/BE021037/Fall88_6.pdf|archivedate=15 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1984 amendments===
In 1984, the Bilingual Education Act was further modified. The amendments enacted during this time served to: 
* increase the flexibility in the implementation of programs for LEP students by providing school districts with more autonomy and independence in deciding how these students should be taught
* allow school districts to apply for funding for different, innovative programs that best met the needs of their students&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chronology of Federal and State Law and Policy Impacting Language Minority Students|url=http://www2.sfasu.edu/enlace/modules/Chronology%20of%20Federal%20Law%20Guiding%20ELL%20Policy%20and%20Practice%20from%20TEA.pdf|accessdate=9 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding for these amendments was $139.4 million and there was a heavy emphasis placed on districts using the funding to build enough capacity to eventually be able to support LEP programs without federal government funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewner-Manzanares|first=Gloria|title=Bilingual Education Act: Twenty Years Later|journal=National Clearinghouse for Bilingual Education|date=Fall 1988|pages=6|url=http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/files/rcd/BE021037/Fall88_6.pdf|accessdate=9 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415073628/http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/files/rcd/BE021037/Fall88_6.pdf|archivedate=15 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1988 amendments===
The BEA was amended again in 1988. The changes this year served to:
* increase funding to state education agencies
* expand funding for "special alternative" programs
* create fellowship programs for professional training&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Funding for the 1988 amendments was $159 million, with regulations for how the money should be divided. Specifically, at least 60% should be spent developing programs and at least 25% of funds should be spent on training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewner-Kajzajares|first=Gloria|title=Bilingual Education Act: Twenty Years Later|journal=National Clearinghouse for Bilingual Education|date=Fall 1988|pages=9|url=http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/files/rcd/BE021037/Fall88_6.pdf|accessdate=9 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415073628/http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/files/rcd/BE021037/Fall88_6.pdf|archivedate=15 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1994 reauthorization===
The Bilingual Education Act (BEA) reauthorization in 1994 maintained the same tenets as the original BEA,  introduced new grant categories, set up preference to programs promoting bilingualism, and took into account indigenous languages.  Overall, the premise of this addition was to introduce a more systemic reform.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wiese|first=Ann-Marie|title=The Bilingual Education Act:Language minority students and equal educational opportunity|journal=Bilingual Research Journal|date=Winter 1998|pages=22|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/222023139|accessdate=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Priority given to bilingualism programs: Though the Bilingual Education Act legislation did not prescribe specific instructional practices, it did provide a guide to help language minority students.  The 1994 reauthorization gave preference to grant applications that developed bilingual proficiency, which Local Education Agencies had the right to develop themselves based on the guidelines of the BEA.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;
*In the FY2000 691 Bilingual Education Instructional Service Grants were given out totaling just over $162 million.  The largest grants in FY2000 were given to the state of California and New York at approximately $58 million and $22.5 million respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Osorio-O’Dea|first=Patricia|title=Bilingual Education:  An Overview|journal=CRS Report for Congress|date=June 2001|pages=12|url=http://www.policyalmanac.org/education/archive/bilingual.pdf|accessdate=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1994 California Proposition 187 was introduced in order to prevent illegal immigrants from obtaining state provided health care, social services and public education.  This was voted on by the public and became a law in November 1994.  Citizens challenged the constitutionality of this proposition and in March 1998 it was ruled unconstitutional and was taken away.  Though the law did not last, it impacted students who were ELL throughout the mid-to-late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Cerda|first=Natalie|title=Bilingual Education Legislative Timeline|year=2006|url=http://cerdahdz.webs.com/legislationtimeline.htm|accessdate=11 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920181947/http://cerdahdz.webs.com/legislationtimeline.htm|archivedate=20 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significant court decisions==
*''[[Meyer v. Nebraska]]'' was the first U.S. Supreme Court case that addressed American education of foreign-languages.  This case did away with a Nebraska law that prevented public and private schools from offering instruction in any language but English. '"The protection of the [U.S.] Constitution extends to all, to those who speak other languages as well as to those born with English on the tongue," Supreme Court Justice James C. McReynolds wrote. The decision established the principle that parents have a constitutional right to direct the upbringing of their children, including their education.'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walsh|first=Mark|title=BELLs and the Law: Statues and Precedents|journal= Education Week|date=Jan 8, 2009|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Lau v. Nichols]]'' was a case brought forward, in which Chinese-American students attending a public school in San Francisco alleged that the failure to provide bilingual instruction to all non-English speaking students violated their rights to education due to limited English comprehension.  The case did not create a specific remedy, yet in conjunction with the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], ruled in favor of the students, thus expanding the rights of students with limited English proficiency.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grant|first=Joseph|title=Bilingual Education and the Law: An Overview|journal=Dissemination Center for Bilingual Bicultural Education|year=1976|pages=25|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/63668329|accessdate=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Serna v. Portales was a case that dictated when a "substantial group" of students with limited English proficiency was present, bilingual education was required.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;
*Aspira v. N.Y. Board of Education required testing for students in English and their native language in order to understand if they should receive additional services and bilingual education.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;
*Keyes v. School District No. 1, Denver, Colorado stated that students should receive instruction in their native language and English until proficiency in English is achieved.&lt;ref&gt;Keyes v. School District No.1, Denver, Colorado, 413 U.S. 189|(1973)|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0413_0189_ZS.html| n.d. 9 Oct 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
*Flores v. Arizona stated that Arizona must do more to fund instruction for ELL students.  The Arizona courts rejected tenets of the NCLB law that changed the services provided to ELL students.  This case was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walsh|first=Mark|title=ELLs and the Law: Statues and Precedents|journal= Education Week|date=Jan 8, 2009|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Castaneda v. Pickard in 1981 created a basis for pedagogically addressing Limited English Proficiency (LEP) students.  It required that districts have a plan for addressing LEP students, that schools provide qualified staff to implement that plan, and that the district has developed an effective evaluation protocol for the program.  Though this case did create a more structured plan pedagogically it did not require bilingual education programs to meet these same standards. "It required only that 'appropriate action to overcome language barriers' be taken through well implemented programs."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Kerper Mora Ed.D|first=Jill|title=LEGAL HISTORY OF BILINGUAL EDUCATION: Federal Law|publisher=San Diego State University|date=Jan 26, 2005|url=http://www.moramodules.com/Pages/HistoryBE.htm|accessdate=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Bilingual Education Act and No Child Left Behind==
No Child Left Behind (NCLB), passed in 2002, had a significant impact on bilingual education and the Bilingual Education Act in the United States due to its emphasis on high-stakes testing. As a result of NCLB and its emphasis on testing, the Bilingual Education Act was renamed the English Language Acquisition, Language Enhancement, and Academic Achievement Act.

The name change alone of BEA under NCLB is significant in that it signals a shift in the philosophical approach to bilingual education. Essentially, even though the act still leaves with state and local educators the ability to choose from instructional methods, "the statement of purpose and accountability requirements make clear that the primary objective is English acquisition."&lt;ref&gt;Moran, Rachel F. "Bilingual Education Act: Equal Education Opportunities: History, Politics, Theory, and Practice. JRank. JRank. n.d. 9 Oct 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Under NCLB, school success and failure is linked to performance on standardized tests. However, this measure subjects English Language Learners (ELLs) "to critical assessments without adequate preparation."&lt;ref&gt;Hilner, Benjamin. "'Bad Policy and Bad Law'": The Shortcomings of the No Child Left Behind Act in Bilingual Educational POlicy and its Frustration of the Equal Protection Clause." Educational Law Consortium Journal. (2005): 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of preparation is due to the fact that NCLB caps funding for bilingual education programs at half of what it had been and does not require that any bilingual education programs undergo periodic evaluation, a measure required by the ''Castenada v. Pickard'' court case. And yet, despite this lack of preparation, ELLs performance on standardized tests can jeopardize a school's access to funding. In essence, "This turns the question of whether or not a school receives a failing label into a question of how many ELLs attend."&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Hilner, Benjamin. "'Bad Policy and Bad Law'": The Shortcomings of the No Child Left Behind Act in Bilingual Educational Policy and its Frustration of the Equal Protection Clause." Educational Law Consortium Journal. (2005): 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the impact of NCLB on ELLs has significant implications on ELLs and their communities' access to education, NCLB is in conflict with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in that it denies "access to a federally funded program based on their skin color or race."&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;  The changes in the BEA under NCLB created a grant program that attempted to enhance English language acquisition.  The ruling placed ELL students in a similar classroom environment as their peers for whom English is not a second language.  The law did not require schools to provide bilingual programs and placed them against the rigorous content standards put in place by State Education Agencies. When ELLs were tested with the same state assessments or the National Assessment for Educational Progress (NAEP), it was shown that compared to their fluently English-speaking peers the ELL students displayed larger deficits in both reading and math.  The 2007 NAEP test, showed increased deficits in both math and reading following a surge of the ELL population in the United States.  By 2005 the number of English-learners throughout the US had risen 57% over the prior decade to approximately 5.1 million students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Zehr, Mary Ann|title=English-Learners Pose Policy Puzzle |journal=Education Week|url=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2009/01/08/17ell.h28.html |date= 8 January 2009 |volume=28 |issue=17 |pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After NCLB was enacted it was shown that there were sufficient numbers of prospective teachers, yet there were insufficient numbers of these teachers entering certain fields.  Among these specializations were science, math, foreign languages, special education and namely bilingual education.  Several initiatives formed to specifically recruit teachers to these specialization fields and allowed for alternative certification paths.  These teacher shortages continue to exist today and are seen to a greater extent in high-poverty districts.&lt;ref&gt;Salinas, Roselia.

The Lamar University – Electronic Journal of Student Research (2006): 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The act and NCLB say that the accommodations that it provides should be interpreted in concordance with federal civil rights laws.  "As interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court, Congress, and federal civil rights officials, these provisions rely on terms like “affirmative steps” and “appropriate action” that give school districts the discretion to use a range of instructional approaches. As a result, under both Title VI and the EEOA, courts and federal enforcement agencies must decide on a case-by-case basis whether programs are in fact overcoming linguistic barriers to full participation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Moran, Rachel F.|title=Bilingual Education Act Equal Educational Opportunities Act, Bilingual Education: History, Politics, Theory, and Practice |url=http://www.jrank.org/cultures/pages/3644/Bilingual-Education-Act.html |date= 11 Oct 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy still remains highly debated at both the state and federal level.

'''Bisection''' is a method used in [[software development]] to identify [[Patch (computing)|change sets]] that result in a specific behavior change. It is mostly employed for finding the patch that introduced a [[software bug|bug]]. Another application area is finding the patch that indirectly fixed a bug.

==Overview==
The process of locating the [[changeset]] that introduced a specific [[software regression|regression]] was described as "source change isolation" in 1997 by Brian Ness and Viet Ngo of [[Cray Research]]. [[Regression testing]] was performed on Cray's [[compiler]]s in editions comprising one or more changesets. Editions with known regressions could not be validated until developers addressed the problem. Source change isolation narrowed the cause to a single changeset that could then be excluded from editions, unblocking them with respect to this problem, while the author of the change worked on a fix. Ness and Ngo outlined [[linear search]] and [[binary search]] methods of performing this isolation.&lt;ref name="Ness 97"&gt;{{cite conference |title=Regression containment through source change isolation |last=Ness |first=Brian |last2=Ngo |first2=Viet |date=1997 |conference=Computer Software and Applications Conference |doi=10.1109/CMPSAC.1997.625082 |publisher=IEEE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Code bisection has the goal of minimizing the effort to find a specific change set.
It employs a [[divide and conquer algorithm]] that
depends on having access to the code history which is usually preserved by
[[revision control]] in a [[Repository (version control)|code repository]].

==Bisection method==
===Code bisection algorithm===
Code history has the structure of a [[directed acyclic graph]] which can be [[Topological ordering|topologically sorted]]. This makes it possible to use a divide and conquer search algorithm which:
* splits up the [[Computational geometry#Geometric query problems|search space]] of candidate revisions
* tests for the behavior in question
* reduces the search space depending on the test result
* re-iterates the steps above until a range with at most one bisectable [[Candidate solution|patch candidate]] remains

===Algorithmic complexity===
Bisection is in [[L (complexity)|LSPACE]] having an [[Analysis of algorithms|algorithmic complexity]] of &lt;math&gt;O(\log N)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; denoting the number of revisions in the search space, and is similar to a [[binary search]].

===Desirable repository properties===
For code bisection it is desirable that each revision in the search space can be built and tested independently.

==Automation support==
Although the bisection method can be completed manually, one of its main advantages is that it can be easily automated.&lt;ref name="Ness 97" /&gt; It can thus fit into existing [[test automation]] processes: failures in exhaustive automated regression tests can trigger automated bisection to localize faults. Ness and Ngo focused on its potential in Cray's [[continuous delivery]]-style environment in which the automatically-isolated bad changeset could be automatically excluded from builds.&lt;ref name="Zeller 99"&gt;{{cite conference |first=Andreas |last=Zeller |title=Yesterday, my program worked. Today, it does not. Why? |date=1999 |conference=European Software Engineering Conference |location=Toulouse, France |doi=10.1145/318774.318946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The revision control systems [[Git (software)|Git]] and [[Mercurial]] have built-in functionality for code bisection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect |title=git-bisect(1) |website=git-scm.com |accessdate=2017-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.selenic.com/mercurial/hg.1.html#bisect |title=hg |website=Selenic.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The user can start a bisection session with a specified range of revisions from which the revision control system proposes a revision to test, the user tells the system whether the revision tested as "good" or "bad", and the process repeats until the specific "bad" revision has been identified. Other revision control systems, such as [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]] or [[Apache Subversion|Subversion]], support bisection through plugins&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://doc.bazaar.canonical.com/plugins/en/bisect-plugin.html |title=bisect - Find the revision introducing a bug using a binary search — Bazaar 2.8.0dev1 documentation |website=Doc.bazaar.canonical.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; or external scripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://metacpan.org/module/INFINOID/App-SVN-Bisect-1.1/bin/svn-bisect |title=svn-bisect |website=Metacpan.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Phoronix Test Suite]] can do bisection automatically to find performance regressions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11595">'''Body transfer illusion''' is the [[illusion]] of owning either a part of a body or an entire body other than one's own, thus it is sometimes referred to as "body ownership" in the research literature. It can be induced experimentally by manipulating the [[visual perspective]] of the subject and also supplying visual and sensory signals which correlate to the subject's body.&lt;ref&gt;Petkova VI, Ehrsson HH, 2008 [http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0003832 If I Were You: Perceptual Illusion of Body Swapping]. [[PLoS ONE]] 3(12): e3832. {{doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0003832}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. P.M. Kammers, I.J.M. van der Ham, H.C. Dijkerman, "Dissociating body representations in healthy individuals: Differential effects of a kinaesthetic illusion on perception and action", [[Neuropsychologia]], Volume 44, Issue 12, 2006, Pages 2430–2436, ISSN 0028-3932, {{doi|10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.04.009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For it to occur, [[Top-down and bottom-up design|bottom-up]] perceptual mechanisms, such as the input of visual information, must override [[Top-down and bottom-up design|top-down]] knowledge that the certain body (or part) does not belong. This is what results in an illusion of transfer of body ownership.&lt;ref name="slater2010"&gt;Slater M, Spanlang B, Sanchez-Vives MV, Blanke O, 2010 [http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0010564 First Person Experience of Body Transfer in Virtual Reality]. PLoS ONE 5(5): e10564. {{doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0010564}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typically induced using [[virtual reality]].&lt;ref name="slater2010" /&gt;

==Rubber hand illusion==
Ehrsson, Spence, and [[Richard Passingham|Passingham]] (2004) did studies on the "rubber hand illusion". Subjects with normal brain function were positioned with their left hand hidden out of sight. They saw a lifelike rubber left hand in front of them. The experimenters stroked both the subjects hidden left hand and the visible rubber hand with a paintbrush. The experiment showed that if the two hands were stroked synchronously and in the same direction, the subjects began to experience the rubber hand as their own. When asked to use their right hand to point to their left hand, most of the time they pointed toward the rubber hand. If the real and rubber hands were stroked in different directions or at different times, the subjects did not experience the rubber hand as their own.

While the experiment was going on the experimenters also recorded the activity of their brains with a functional MRI scanner. The scans showed increased activity in the parietal lobe and then, right after, as the subjects began to experience the rubber hand as their own, in the [[premotor cortex]], the region of the brain involved in planning movements. On the other hand, when the stroking of the real and rubber hands was uncoordinated and the subjects did not experience the rubber hand as their own, the premotor cortex did not become activated. From this the experimenters concluded that the parietal cortex was involved with visual and touch processing. The premotor cortex, getting transmitted information from the parietal cortex, was involved with the feeling of ownership of the rubber hand.

Another study from the same laboratory provided further evidence of this ownership of the rubber hand (Ehrsson et al., 2007; Slater et al., 2009). The experimenters used the same procedure as the previous experiment to establish that feeling of ownership involved with the stimulation of the premotor cortex. Then, threatened the rubber hand by making a stabbing movement toward it with a needle (not actually making contact with the rubber hand). MRI scans showed increase activity in a region of the brain called the anterior cingulate cortex that is normally activated when a person anticipates pain, along with the supplementary motor area, that is normally activated when a person feels the urge to move his or her arm (Fried et al., 1991; Peyron, Laurent, and Garcia-Larrea, 2000). The anticipation of the needle made the subjects react as if the rubber hand was their own, moving their real hand to avoid the needle even though it was never actually in danger.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, N. R. (2010). Physiology of behavior, 11th Edition. New York: Allyn &amp; Bacon. A LA CARTE version MyPsychLab w/e-Text.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illusion induced through virtual reality==
One of the ways in which  body transfer illusion has been studied is through [[virtual reality]] simulation where a first person perspective of a life-sized virtual human female body has appeared to substitute the male subjects' own body. This was demonstrated subjectively by questionnaire and physiologically through heart-rate deceleration in response to a threat to the [[virtual body]]. The results support the notion that bottom-up perceptual mechanisms, such as those involving the [[premotor cortex]] and [[cerebellum]], can temporarily override top down knowledge therefore resulting in a radical illusion of transfer of body ownership. In the study, male participants  entered the virtual reality simulation and experienced various forms of stimulation including arm-stroking and other physical sensations. Afterwards the heart rate was monitored and  a questionnaire was completed.&lt;ref&gt;Slater M, Spanlang B, Sanchez-Vives MV, Blanke O, 2010. First Person Experience of Body Transfer in Virtual Reality. PLoS ONE 5(5): e10564. {{doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0010564}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Body transfer illusion has been used in order to treat the experience of [[phantom limb pain]] by giving visual feedback of the missing limb. The [[mirror box]] gives visual feedback that can allow a person using it the opportunity to "see" the missing hand, and to manipulate the hand in an attempt to relieve pain or discomfort. [[Virtual reality]] is also used to treat phantom limb pain in a similar way, by allowing the user to "see" the missing limb within the virtual world and manipulate it however they choose.

==Neural basis==
The integration of touch stimulation via the [[somatosensory system]] with visual input is essential for creating the body transfer illusion. When the body is not in motion, it perceives its position in space through the integration of multi-modal afferent signals. Motion of the body adds efferent signal information and leads to a more fluid perception of body transfer. When information from one form of signal (e.g. touch) does not match the signals from another sense (e.g. vision), the body still attempts to integrate this information.&lt;ref&gt;Manos Tsakiris, Simone Schutz-Bosbach, Shaun Gallagher, "One agency and body-ownership: Phenomenologial and neurocognitive reflections" Consciousness and Cognition Volume 16, 2007, Pages 645-660 {{doi|10.1016/j.concog.2007.05.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically the [[Multisensory integration#Rubber hand illusion|rubber hand illusion]] is associated with activity in the multisensory areas, most notably the ventral premotor cortex. However, it remains to be demonstrated that this illusion does not simply reflect the dominant role of vision and that the premotor activity does not reflect a visual representation of an object near the hand.&lt;ref&gt; H. Henrik Ehrsson,1 Nicholas P. Holmes,2 and Richard E. Passingham1[http://www.jneurosci.org/content/25/45/10564.short Touching a Rubber Hand: Feeling of Body Ownership Is Associated with Activity in Multisensory Brain Areas] The Journal of Neuroscience, November 9, 2005, 25(45):10564-10573; {{doi|10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0800-05.2005}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Drug-induced enhancement==
With [[ketamine]], the body transfer illusion is ultimately enhanced and participants are more vulnerable to a false sense of limb ownership than without the use of ketamine. Although the precise nature of ketamine's impact is speculative, two features of its effects are noteworthy. First, it promotes an overall increase in the subjective and behavioral indexes of the illusion. Second, this effect is found even when a sensory asynchrony is present, a manipulation that would normally reduce the experience of the illusion. This pattern may be understood in terms of the drug's impact on the top-down–bottom-up balance that would normally account for the illusion's characteristic features since ketamine produces an overall increase in tendency to the illusion, whereas this sensitivity to the coherence of visual and tactile input is preserved. A further possibility is that ketamine enhances the salience of the visual input (the sight of a rubber hand in a position compatible with one's own hand) at the expense of information arising from the temporal asynchrony between sensory inputs. This would explain why the presence of the rubber hand is enough to enable the illusion to persist, even when in attenuated form, when visuo-tactile inputs are asynchronous.&lt;ref&gt;L. Morgana, Danielle C. Turnerb, Philip R. Corlett, "Exploring the Impact of Ketamine on the Experience of Illusory Body Ownership" Biological Psychiatry Volume 69, Issue 1, 1 January 2011, Pages 35-41 {{doi|10.1016/j.biopsych.2010.07.032}} &lt;/ref&gt;

A very similar effect occurs with the administration of the [[dopamine]] and [[noradrenaline]] releasing agent [[dextroamphetamine]]. The similarities include increased subjective reports of embodiment of the rubber hand during the illusion, and that the dextroamphetamine enhancing effect is also seen during sensory asynchrony. &lt;ref&gt;MA Albrecht, MT Martin-Iverson, G Price, J Lee, R Iyyalol, F Waters, "Dexamphetamine effects on separate constructs in the rubber hand illusion test" Psychopharmacology Volume 217, Issue 1, 2011, Pages 39-50 {{doi|10.1007/s00213-011-2255-y}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Mind-body connection==
Human bodily experience is characterized by the immediate and continuous experience that our body and its parts belong to us, often called [[attribution (psychology)|self-attribution]], body ownership and or mineness. It is unknown if the origin of body representation is innate or if it is constructed from sensory experience.&lt;ref&gt;Marcello Costantini, Patrick Haggard, "The rubber hand illusion: Sensitivity and reference frame for body ownership", [[Consciousness and Cognition]], Volume 16, Issue 2, June 2007, Pages 229–240, ISSN 1053-8100, {{doi|10.1016/j.concog.2007.01.001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  A related, but distinct, bodily experience is self-localization or embodiment that is defined as the experience that the self is localized at the position of our body at a certain position in space. Recent philosophical and neurological theories converge on the relevance of such bodily experiences and associated processing of bodily information as one promising approach for the development of a comprehensive neurobiological model of self-consciousness. Yet, the scientific investigation of bodily experiences in general, and self-attribution/body ownership and self-localization/embodiment more specifically, have proven difficult and have not received the attention they deserve given their importance for neuroscientific models of self and self-consciousness.&lt;ref&gt; C. Lopez, P. Halje, O. Blanke, "Body ownership and embodiment: Vestibular and multisensory mechanisms" Neurophysiologie Clinique/Clinical Neurophysiology Volume 38, Issue 3, June 2008, Pages 149-161 {{doi|10.1016/j.neucli.2007.12.006}} &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bullying''' is the use of force, threat, or [[coercion]] to [[abuse]], [[intimidate]] or aggressively [[wikt:domination|dominate]] others. The behavior is often repeated and habitual. One essential prerequisite is the perception, by the bully or by others, of an imbalance of [[Power (social and political)|social]] or physical power, which distinguishes bullying from conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Juvonen, J. |author2=Graham, S. | title =Bullying in Schools: The Power of Bullies and the Plight of Victims | journal =Annual Review of Psychology| volume =65 | publisher =Annual Reviews | date =2014| pages=159–85 | url =http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-psych-010213-115030 | doi=10.1146/annurev-psych-010213-115030 | pmid=23937767}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behaviors used to assert such domination can include verbal [[harassment]] or [[threat]], physical [[assault]] or coercion, and such acts may be directed repeatedly towards particular targets.

Bullying ranges from one-on-one, individual bullying through to group bullying called [[mobbing]], in which the bully may have one or more "lieutenants" who may seem to be willing to assist the primary bully in his or her bullying activities. Bullying in school and the workplace is also referred to as peer abuse.&lt;ref name="Bennett2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Elizabeth Bennett|title=Peer Abuse Know More!: Bullying from a Psychological Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GF06aB7mLdIC|accessdate=2013-10-29|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Infinity|isbn=978-0-7414-3265-0|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914150852/http://books.google.com/books?id=GF06aB7mLdIC|archivedate=14 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert W.

There is no universal definition of bullying, however, it is widely agreed upon that bullying is a subcategory of aggressive behavior characterized by the following three minimum criteria: (1) hostile intent, (2) imbalance of power and (3) repetition over a period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Burger |first=Christoph |last2=Strohmeier |first2=Dagmar |last3=Spröber |first3=Nina |last4=Bauman |first4=Sheri |last5=Rigby |first5=Ken |date=2015 |title=How teachers respond to school bullying: An examination of self-reported intervention strategy use, moderator effects, and concurrent use of multiple strategies |journal=Teaching and Teacher Education |pages=191–202 |doi=10.1016/j.tate.2015.07.004 |volume=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bullying may thus be defined as the activity of repeated, aggressive behavior intended to hurt another individual, physically, mentally or emotionally.

He says negative actions occur "when a person intentionally inflicts injury or discomfort upon another person, through physical contact, through words or in other ways."&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; Individual bullying is usually characterized by a person behaving in a certain way to gain [[Power (social and political)|power]] over another person.&lt;ref name="Besag1989"&gt;{{cite book|author=Valerie E.

== Types ==
Individual bullying can be classified into four types.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Invitation to the Life Span|last = Berger|first = Kathleen Stassen|publisher = Worth Publishers|year = 2014|isbn = 1464172056|location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Collective bullying is known as mobbing, and can include any of the individual types of bullying.

Physical, verbal, and relational bullying are most prevalent in primary school and could also begin much earlier whilst continuing into later stages in individuals lives. It is stated that Cyber-bullying is more common in secondary school than in primary school.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Individual ===
Individual bullying tactics can be perpetrated by a single person against a target or targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://respect2all.org/bullying-definitions/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304140405/http://respect2all.org/bullying-definitions/ |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Physical ====
This is any bullying that hurts someone's body or damages their possessions. Stealing, shoving, hitting, fighting, and destroying property all are types of physical bullying. Physical bullying is rarely the first form of bullying that a target will experience. Often bullying will begin in a different form and later progress to physical violence. In physical bullying the main weapon the bully uses is their body when attacking their target. Sometimes groups of young adults will target and alienate a peer because of some adolescent prejudice. This can quickly lead to a situation where they are being taunted, tortured, and beaten-up by their classmates. Physical bullying will often escalate over time, and can lead to a tragic ending, and therefore must be stopped quickly to prevent any further escalation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nobullying.com/physical-bullying/|title=no bullying|last=|first=|date=|website=nobullying.com/physical-bullying/|publisher=|access-date=30 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201023450/https://nobullying.com/physical-bullying/|archivedate=1 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Verbal ====
This is any bullying that is conducted by speaking. Calling names, spreading rumors, threatening somebody, and making fun of others are all forms of verbal bullying. Verbal bullying is one of the most common types of bullying. In verbal bullying the main weapon the bully uses is their ''voice''. In many cases, verbal bullying is the province of girls. Girls are more subtle (and can be more devastating), in general, than boys. Girls use verbal bullying, as well as social exclusion techniques, to dominate and control other individuals and show their superiority and power. However, there are also many boys with subtlety enough to use verbal techniques for domination, and who are practiced in using words when they want to avoid the trouble that can come with physically bullying someone else.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bullyingstatistics.org/content/verbal-bullying.html|title=What is Verbal Bullying and How to Handle Verbal Bullies - Bullying Statistics|date=2015-07-08|newspaper=Bullying Statistics|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-30|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161125110622/http://www.bullyingstatistics.org/content/verbal-bullying.html|archivedate=2016-11-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Relational ====
This is any bullying that is done with the intent to hurt somebody's reputation or social standing which can also link in with the techniques included in physical and verbal bullying. Relational Bullying is a form of bullying common amongst youth, but particularly upon girls. Relational bullying can be used as a tool by bullies to both improve their social standing and control others. Unlike physical bullying which is obvious, relational bullying is not overt and can continue for a long time without being noticed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://antibullyingsoftware.com/what-is-the-definition-of-relational-bullying-social-bullying/|title=What is the Definition of Relational Bullying / Social Bullying  - BRIM Anti-Bullying Software|last=Norton|first=Chris|newspaper=BRIM Anti-Bullying Software|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-30|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201080421/https://antibullyingsoftware.com/what-is-the-definition-of-relational-bullying-social-bullying/|archivedate=2016-12-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cyber-bullying ====
Cyber bullying is the use of technology to harass, threaten, embarrass, or target another person. When an adult is involved, it may meet the definition of '''cyber-harassment''' or '''cyberstalking''', a crime that can have legal consequences and involve jail time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kidshealth.org/en/parents/cyberbullying.html|title=Cyberbullying|website=kidshealth.org|access-date=2016-11-30|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201165708/http://kidshealth.org/en/parents/cyberbullying.html|archivedate=2016-12-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes email, instant messaging, social networking sites (such as Facebook), text messages, and cell phones.

=== Collective ===
Collective bullying tactics are employed by more than one individual against a target or targets. [[Internet troll|Trolling behavior]] on social media, although generally assumed to be individual in nature by the casual reader, is sometime organized efforts by sponsored [[astroturfing|astroturfers]].

==== Mobbing ====
{{Main|Mobbing}}
Mobbing refers to the bullying of an individual by a group, in any context, such as a [[family]], [[peer group]], [[school]], [[workplace]], [[neighborhood]], [[community]], or online. When it occurs as [[emotion]]al [[abuse]] in the workplace, such as "ganging up" by co-workers, [[Hierarchy|subordinate]]s or [[Superior (hierarchy)|superior]]s, to force someone out of the workplace through [[rumor]], [[innuendo]], [[intimidation]], [[humiliation]], [[discrediting]], and [[Isolation to facilitate abuse|isolation]], it is also referred to as malicious, nonsexual, nonracial / racial, general [[harassment]].&lt;ref&gt;Mobbing: Emotional Abuse in the American Workplace by Noa Davenport, Ruth D.

Dr. Cook says that "a typical bully has trouble resolving problems with others and also has trouble academically.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peer groups often promote the bully's actions, and members of these peer groups also engage in behaviors, such as mocking, excluding, punching, and insulting one another as a source of entertainment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other researchers also argued that a minority of the bullies, those who are not in-turn bullied, enjoy going to school, and are least likely to take days off sick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title ='Bullies are the healthiest pupils' | newspaper =BBC News | department =Education | publisher =BBC | date =1999-12-14 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/564923.stm | accessdate =2013-10-29 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131030192122/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/564923.stm | archivedate =2013-10-30 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Of typical bystanders ===
Often, bullying takes place in the presence of a large group of relatively uninvolved bystanders. In many cases, it is the bully's ability to create the illusion that he or she has the support of the majority present that instills the fear of "speaking out" in protestation of the bullying activities being observed by the group. Unless the "bully mentality" is effectively challenged in any given group in its early stages, it often becomes an accepted, or supported, [[Norm (social)|norm]] within the group.&lt;ref name="bystander attitudes"&gt;{{cite web | title =Bullies, Victims, and Bystanders | work =athealth.com: Consumer: Issues | publisher =Athealth.com | url =http://www.athealth.com/Consumer/issues/BulliesVictimsBystanders3.html | accessdate =2013-10-29 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20140305091427/http://www.athealth.com/Consumer/issues/BulliesVictimsBystanders3.html | archivedate =2014-03-05 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =New Tactics To Tackle Bystander's Role In Bullying | newspaper =Science Daily | department =Science News | publisher =Science Daily, LLC | date =2009-01-27 | url =https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/01/090125193150.htm | accessdate =2013-10-29 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131029184804/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/01/090125193150.htm | archivedate =2013-10-29 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unless action is taken, a "[[Bullying culture|culture of bullying]]" is often perpetuated within a group for months, years, or longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =419: Petty Tyrant | work =This American Life: Radio Archive | publisher =Chicago Public Media &amp; Ira Glass | date =2010-11-12 | url =http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/419/petty-tyrant | accessdate =2013-10-29 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131010093611/http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/419/petty-tyrant | archivedate =2013-10-10 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bystanders who have been able to establish their own "friendship group" or "support group" have been found to be far more likely to opt to speak out against bullying behavior than those who have not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Pasco students get 'hero' training to stop bullying | newspaper =[[The Tampa Tribune]] | department =Pasco County | publisher =Tampa Media Group, LLC | date =2010-10-12 | url =http://tbo.com/pasco-county/pasco-students-get-hero-training-to-stop-bullying-24060 | accessdate =2013-10-29 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20140502001344/http://tbo.com/pasco-county/pasco-students-get-hero-training-to-stop-bullying-24060 | archivedate =2014-05-02 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title =Program Helps Students Combat Bullying - Students participate with enthusiasm | journal =Winning Harmony Counselling | date =2010-10-04 | url =http://www.winningharmony.com/News_and_Events.php | accessdate =2013-10-29 | postscript =&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

In addition to communication of clear expectations that bystanders should intervene and increasing individual self-efficacy, there is growing research that suggests interventions should build on the foundation that bullying is morally wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Thornberg | first =Robert | last2 =Tenenbaum | first2 =Laura | last3 =Varjas | first3 =Kris | last4 =Meyers | first4 =Joel | last5 =Jungert | first5 =Tomas | last6 =Vanegas | first6 =Gina | title =Bystander Motivation in Bullying Incidents: To Intervene or Not to Intervene? | journal =Western Journal of Emergency Medicine | volume =13 | issue =3 | pages =247–252 | date =August 2012 | language =  | doi =10.5811/westjem.2012.3.11792| pmc =3415829 | pmid =22900122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among adults, being a bystander to workplace bullying was linked to depression, particularly in women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Jensen | first =I.

=== Of victims ===
Dr. Cook says that "A typical victim is likely to be aggressive, lack social skills, think negative thoughts, experience difficulties in solving social problems, come from a negative family, school and community environments and be noticeably rejected and isolated by peers".&lt;ref name="APS2010"/&gt; Victims often have characteristics such as being physically weak, as well as being easily distraught emotionally. They may also have physical characteristics that make them easier targets for bullies such as being overweight or having some type of physical deformity. Boys are more likely to be victims of physical bullying while girls are more likely to be bullied indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Paediatrics and Child Health|year= 2010 |volume=20 |issue=7|pages=315–320|last=Vanderbilt |first=Douglas |last2=Augustyn |first2=Marilyn |url =http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751722210000715|title=The effects of bullying |doi=10.1016/j.paed.2010.03.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of a [[meta-analysis]] conducted by Cook and published by the [[American Psychological Association]] in 2010 concluded the main risk factors for children and adolescents being bullied, and also for becoming bullies, are the lack of [[social problem-solving]] skills.&lt;ref name="APS2010"/&gt;

Children who are bullied often show physical or emotional signs, such as: being afraid to attend school, complaining of headaches or a loss of appetite, a lack of interest in school activities and spending time with friends or family, and having an overall sense of sadness.

=== Positive development ===
Some have argued that bullying can teach life lessons and instill strength. Helene Guldberg, a child development academic, sparked controversy when she argued that being a target of bullying can teach a child "how to manage disputes and boost their ability to interact with others", and that teachers should not intervene, but leave children to respond to the bullying themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author =Tanya | title =Child Development Academician Says Bullying Is Beneficial To Kids | work =Med India | department =News | publisher =Medindia | date =2009-02-02 | url =http://www.medindia.net/news/Child-Development-Academician-Says-Bullying-Is-Beneficial-To-Kids-46992-1.htm | accessdate =2013-10-29 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131101060052/http://www.medindia.net/news/Child-Development-Academician-Says-Bullying-Is-Beneficial-To-Kids-46992-1.htm | archivedate =2013-11-01 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Projection ==
{{Main|Psychological projection}}
A bully may project his/her own feelings of vulnerability onto the target(s) of the bullying activity. Despite the fact that a bully's typically denigrating activities are aimed at the bully's targets, the true source of such negativity is ultimately almost always found in the bully's own sense of personal insecurity and/or vulnerability.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Gilbert, ''Overcoming Depression'' (1999) p.&amp;nbsp;185–6&lt;/ref&gt; Such aggressive projections of displaced negative emotions can occur anywhere from the micro-level of interpersonal relationships, all the way up through to the macro-level of international politics, or even international armed conflict.&lt;ref name="micro and macro projection"&gt;Carl G.

Bullying is abusive social interaction between peers which can include aggression, harassment, and violence. Bullying is typically repetitive and enacted by those who are in a position of [[Abusive power and control|power]] over the victim. A growing body of research illustrates a significant relationship between bullying and [[emotional intelligence]] (EI). [[John D. Mayer|Mayer]] et al., (2008) defines the dimensions of overall EI as: "accurately perceiving emotion, using emotions to facilitate thought, understanding emotion, and managing emotion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mayer | first1 = J.D. | last2 = Roberts | first2 = R.D | last3 = Barasade | first3 = S.G. | year = 2008 | title = Human abilities: Emotional intelligence | url = | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 59 | issue = 1| pages = 507–536 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.59.103006.093646 | pmid = 17937602 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept combines emotional and intellectual processes.&lt;ref name="Tolegenova"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.12.142|title = A Theoretical Formation of Emotional Intelligence and Childhood Trauma among Adolescents| journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences| volume=69| pages=1891–1894|year = 2012|last1 = Tolegenova|first1 = A.A.| last2=Jakupov| first2=S.M.| last3=Chung| first3=Man Cheung| last4=Saduova| first4=S.| last5=Jakupov| first5=M.S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lower emotional intelligence appears to be related to involvement in bullying, as the bully and/or the victim of bullying. EI seems to play an important role in both bullying behavior and [[victimization]] in bullying; given that EI is illustrated to be malleable, EI education could greatly improve bullying prevention and intervention initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mckenna | first1 = J. | last2 = Webb | first2 = J. | year = 2013 | title = Emotional intelligence | url = | journal = British Journal of Occupational Therapy | volume = 76 | issue = 12| page = 560 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cyberbullying ===
{{Main|Cyberbullying}}
Cyberbullying is any bullying done through the use of technology. This form of bullying can easily go undetected because of lack of parental/authoritative supervision. Because bullies can pose as someone else, it is the most anonymous form of bullying. Cyberbullying includes, but is not limited to, abuse using email, instant messaging, text messaging, websites, social networking sites, etc.&lt;ref name="BoltonGraeve2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jose Bolton|author2=Stan Graeve|title=No Room for Bullies: From the Classroom to Cyberspace|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WOUWBckRIBIC|accessdate=2013-10-29|year=2005|publisher=Boys Town Press|isbn=978-1-889322-67-4|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101120429/http://books.google.com/books?id=WOUWBckRIBIC|archivedate=2014-01-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the creation of social networks like [[Facebook]], [[Myspace]], [[Instagram]], and [[Twitter]], cyberbullying has increased.

It has been noted that disabled people are disproportionately affected by bullying and abuse, and such activity has been cited as a hate crime.&lt;ref name="Quarmby2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Katherine Quarmby|title=Scapegoat: Why We Are Failing Disabled People|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lglMYgEACAAJ|accessdate=2013-10-29|year=2011|publisher=Portobello Books Limited|isbn=978-1-84627-321-6|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101120453/http://books.google.com/books?id=lglMYgEACAAJ|archivedate=2014-01-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bullying is not limited to those who are visibly disabled, such as wheelchair-users or physically deformed such as those with a cleft lip, but also those with learning disabilities, such as [[autism]]&lt;ref name="Sainsbury2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Clare Sainsbury|title=Martian in the Playground: Understanding the Schoolchild with Asperger's Syndrome|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TbGwEaH8eAIC|accessdate=2013-10-29|date=30 September 2009|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4462-4398-5|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101120424/http://books.google.com/books?id=TbGwEaH8eAIC|archivedate=1 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Attwood2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tony Attwood|title=The Complete Guide to Asperger's Syndrome|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZwQGsuCNMPYC|accessdate=2013-10-29|year=2006|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|isbn=978-1-84310-495-7|pages=95–111|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101120355/http://books.google.com/books?id=ZwQGsuCNMPYC|archivedate=2014-01-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[developmental coordination disorder]].&lt;ref name="Kirby2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Amanda Kirby|title=Dyspraxia: The Hidden Handicap|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=so-3-vIf0lkC|accessdate=2013-10-29|date=1 October 2002|publisher=Souvenir Press|isbn=978-0-285-63512-8|pages=106–113|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101120440/http://books.google.com/books?id=so-3-vIf0lkC|archivedate=1 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brookes2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Geoff Brookes|title=Dyspraxia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wZDqe-SckjIC|accessdate=2013-10-29|date=January 2005|publisher=Continuum|isbn=978-0-8264-7581-7|pages=43–46|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101120352/http://books.google.com/books?id=wZDqe-SckjIC|archivedate=2014-01-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an additional problem that those with learning disabilities are often not as able to explain things to other people, so are more likely to be disbelieved or ignored if they do complain.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

=== Gay bullying ===
{{Main|Gay bashing}}
Gay bullying and gay bashing designate direct or indirect [[verbal abuse|verbal]] or [[physical abuse|physical]] actions by a person or group against someone who is gay or lesbian, or perceived to be so due to rumors or because they are considered to fit gay stereotypes. Gay and lesbian youth are more likely than straight youth to report bullying.&lt;ref name="Berlan et al., 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last =Berlan | first =Elise D. | last2 =Corliss | first2 =Heather L. | last3 =Field | first3 =Alison E. | last4 =Goodman | first4 =Elizabeth | last5 =Austin | first5 =S.

=== Legal bullying ===
{{Main|Legal abuse}}
Legal bullying is the bringing of a [[Vexatious litigation|vexatious legal action]] to control and punish a person. Legal bullying can often take the form of frivolous, repetitive, or burdensome lawsuits brought to intimidate the defendant into submitting to the litigant's request, not because of the legal merit of the litigant's position, but principally due to the defendant's inability to maintain the legal battle. This can also take the form of [[Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation]] (SLAPP). It was partially concern about the potential for this kind of abuse that helped to fuel the [[protests against SOPA and PIPA]] in the United States in 2011 and 2012.

=== Military bullying ===
{{Main|Bullying in the military}}
In 2000, the UK [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] (MOD) defined bullying as "the use of physical strength or the [[abuse of authority]] to intimidate or victimize others, or to give unlawful punishments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Dannatt | first =Sir Richard | title =Values and Standards of the British Army | chapter =Lawful: Paragraph 20 | publisher =the British Army | year =2008 | url =http://www.army.mod.uk/documents/general/v_s_of_the_british_army.pdf | accessdate =2013-10-29 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20130817150435/http://www.army.mod.uk/documents/general/v_s_of_the_british_army.pdf | archivedate =2013-08-17 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that this behaviour should be allowed, due to ways in which "soldiering" is different from other occupations. Soldiers expected to risk their lives should, according to them, develop strength of body and spirit to accept bullying.&lt;ref name="CallaghanKernic2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jean M.

=== Parental bullying of children ===
{{See also|Child abuse|Narcissistic parent|Parental narcissistic abuse}}
Parents who may [[Displacement (psychology)|displace]] their anger, insecurity, or a persistent need to dominate and [[Abusive power and control|control]] upon their children in excessive ways have been proven to increase the likelihood that their own children will in turn become overly aggressive or controlling towards their peers.&lt;ref name="parent bullying"&gt;{{cite web | last =Priesnitz | first =Wendy | title =Parental Bullying Creates Bullies | work =Natural Child Magazine | publisher =Wendy Priesnitz | url =http://www.naturalchildmagazine.com/news/parental_bullying_creates_bullies.htm | accessdate =2013-10-29 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131031134551/http://www.naturalchildmagazine.com/news/parental_bullying_creates_bullies.htm | archivedate =2013-10-31 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[American Psychological Association]] advises on its website that parents who may suspect that their own children may be engaging in bullying activities among their peers should carefully consider the examples which they themselves may be setting for their own children regarding how they typically interact with their own peers, colleagues, and children.&lt;ref name = "APA on parental bullying"&gt;{{cite web | title =Bullying: How parents, teachers, and kids can take action to prevent bullying | work =American Psychological Association | publisher =American Psychological Association | url = http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/bullying.aspx# | accessdate = 2013-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prison bullying ===
{{Main|Prisoner abuse}}
An environment known for bullying is in prisons. An additional complication is the staff and their relationships with the inmates. Thus the following possible bullying scenarios are possible:
* Inmate bullies inmate (echoing school bullying)
* Staff bullies inmate
* Staff bullies staff (a manifestation of workplace bullying)
* Inmate bullies staff

=== School bullying (bullying of students in schools) ===
{{Main|School bullying}}
Bullying can occur in nearly any part in or around the school building, although it may occur more frequently during physical education classes and activities such as recess. Bullying also takes place in school hallways, bathrooms, on school buses and while waiting for buses, and in classes that require group work and/or after school activities. Bullying in school sometimes consists of a group of students taking advantage of or isolating one student in particular and gaining the loyalty of bystanders who want to avoid becoming the next target. In the 2011 documentary [[Bully (2011 film)|''Bully'']], we see first hand the torture that kids go through both in school and while on the school bus. As the movie follows around a few kids we see how bullying affects them both at school as well as in their homes. While bullying has no age limit, these bullies may taunt and tease their target before finally physically bullying them. Bystanders typically choose to either participate or watch, sometimes out of fear of becoming the next target.

Bullying can also be perpetrated by teachers and the school system itself; there is an inherent power differential in the system that can easily predispose to subtle or covert abuse ([[relational aggression]] or [[passive aggression]]), [[humiliation]], or exclusion — even while maintaining overt commitments to anti-bullying policies.&lt;ref name="GarbarinodeLara2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=James Garbarino|author2=Ellen deLara|title=And Words Can Hurt Forever: How to Protect Adolescents from Bullying, Harassment, and Emotional Violence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3XPx-OLgQjQC|accessdate=2013-10-29|date=2 September 2003|publisher=Free Press|isbn=978-0-7432-2899-2|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101120850/http://books.google.com/books?id=3XPx-OLgQjQC|archivedate=1 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Witted | first =Kathryn Suzanne | title =Student Reports of Physical and Psychological Maltreatment in Schools: An Under Explored Aspect of Student Victimization in Schools | work =PhD dissertation, University of Tennessee | year =2005 | url =http://trace.tennessee.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3874&amp;context=utk_graddiss | accessdate =2013-10-29 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131031121558/http://trace.tennessee.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3874&amp;context=utk_graddiss | archivedate =2013-10-31 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1177/0013124507304487 |title=Do Teachers Bully Students?: Findings From a Survey of Students in an Alternative Education Setting |year=2007 |last1=Whitted |first1=K.

In 2016, in Canada, a North American legal precedent was set by a mother and her son, after the son was bullied in his public school. The mother and son won a court case against the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board, making this the first case in North America where a school board has been found negligent in a bullying case for failing to meet the standard of care (the "duty of care" that the school board owes to its students). Thus, it sets a precedent of a school board being found liable in negligence for harm caused to a child, because they failed to protect a child from the bullying actions of other students. There has been only one other similar bullying case and it was won in Australia in 2013 (Oyston v. St. Patricks College, 2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ottawacommunitynews.com/news-story/6773614-family-wins-precedent-setting-case-against-public-school-board/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170210080755/http://www.ottawacommunitynews.com/news-story/6773614-family-wins-precedent-setting-case-against-public-school-board/ |archivedate=2017-02-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexual bullying ===
{{Main|Sexual bullying}}
{{See also|Slut-shaming}}
Sexual bullying is "Any bullying behaviour, whether physical or non-physical, that is based on a person's sexuality or gender. It is when sexuality or gender is used as a weapon by boys or girls towards other boys or girls – although it is more commonly directed at girls. It can be carried out to a person's face, behind their back or through the use of technology."&lt;ref name=NSPCC02&gt;{{cite web |url=http://w1.qehs.net/moodle2/pluginfile.php/10744/mod_resource/content/1/Sexual%20bullying.pdf |title=The NSPCC working definition of Sexual Bullying |publisher=[[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children|NSPCC]] |accessdate=13 September 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220065205/http://w1.qehs.net/moodle2/pluginfile.php/10744/mod_resource/content/1/Sexual%20bullying.pdf |archivedate=20 December 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trans bullying ===
{{Main|Trans bashing}}
'''Trans bashing''' is the act of [[victimizing]] a person physically, sexually, or verbally because they are [[transgender]] or [[Transsexualism|transsexual]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,20774504-5005961,00.html Guilty plea over transsexual bashing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502173830/http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0%2C21985%2C20774504-5005961%2C00.html |date=2008-05-02 }} By Mariza O'Keefe in ''Herald Sun''&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[gay bashing]], it is committed because of the target's actual or perceived [[gender identity]], not [[sexual orientation]].

=== Workplace bullying ===
{{Main|Workplace bullying}}
Workplace bullying occurs when an employee experiences a persistent pattern of mistreatment from others in the workplace that causes harm.&lt;ref&gt;Rayner, C. &amp; Keashley, L. (2005). Bullying at work: A perspective from Britain and North America. In S. Fox &amp; P. E. Spector (eds.) Counterproductive work behavior: Investigations of actors and targets (pp. 271-296). Washington DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt; Workplace bullying can include such tactics as [[verbal abuse|verbal]], [[nonverbal]], [[psychological abuse|psychological]], [[physical abuse|physical]] abuse and [[humiliation]]. This type of [[workplace aggression]] is particularly difficult because, unlike the typical forms of [[school bullying]], workplace bullies often operate within the established rules and policies of their organization and their society. Bullying in the workplace is in the majority of cases reported as having been perpetrated by someone in authority over the target. However, bullies can also be peers, and occasionally can be subordinates.&lt;ref&gt;Rayner, C., &amp; Cooper, C. L. (2006). Workplace Bullying. In Kelloway, E., Barling, J. &amp; Hurrell Jr., J. (eds.), Handbook of workplace violence (pp. 47-90). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known documented use of "workplace bullying" is in 1992 in a book by [[Andrea Adams]] called ''Bullying at Work: How to Confront and Overcome It''.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=workplace+bullying&amp;case_insensitive=on&amp;year_start=1990&amp;year_end=2008&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t4%3B%2Cworkplace%20bullying%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bworkplace%20bullying%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BWorkplace%20Bullying%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BWorkplace%20bullying%3B%2Cc0 Google ngrams]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrea Adams|Adams, Andrea]] with contributions from Crawford, Neil ''Bullying at Work: How to Confront and Overcome It'' (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has also investigated the impact of the larger organizational context on bullying as well as the group-level processes that impact on the incidence, and maintenance of bullying behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsay, S., Troth, A &amp; Branch, S . (2010). Work-place bullying: A group processes framework ''Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 84(4), 799-816.''&lt;/ref&gt; Bullying can be covert or overt. It may be missed by superiors or known by many throughout the organization. Negative effects are not limited to the targeted individuals, and may lead to a decline in [[employee morale]] and a change in [[organizational culture]].&lt;ref name="SilentEpidemic" /&gt; A [[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane Collaboration]] [[systematic review]] has found very low quality [[Scientific evidence|evidence]] to suggest that organizational and individual interventions may prevent bullying behaviors in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009778.pub2/abstract|title=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|last=Gillen|first=Patricia A|last2=Sinclair|first2=Marlene|last3=Kernohan|first3=W George|last4=Begley|first4=Cecily M|last5=Luyben|first5=Ans G|date=2017-01-30|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|issn=1465-1858|language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd009778.pub2/full|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307203800/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009778.pub2/abstract|archivedate=2017-03-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== In academia ====
{{Main|Bullying in academia}}
Bullying in academia is workplace bullying of scholars and staff in academia, especially places of higher education such as colleges and universities. It is believed to be common, although has not received as much attention from researchers as bullying in some other contexts.&lt;ref&gt;

==== In blue collar jobs ====
Bullying has been identified as prominent in blue collar jobs, including on oil rigs and in mechanic shops and machine shops. It is thought that intimidation and fear of retribution cause decreased incident reports. In industry sectors dominated by males, typically of little education, where disclosure of incidents are seen as effeminate, reporting in the socioeconomic and cultural milieu of such industries would likely lead to a [[vicious circle]]. This is often used in combination with [[psychological manipulation|manipulation]] and [[coercion]] of facts to gain favour among higher-ranking [[administrator (business)|administrators]].&lt;ref&gt;

It is believed that its adversarial, hierarchical tradition contributes towards this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unswlawjournal.unsw.edu.au/sites/default/files/t1_le_mire_and_owens.pdf Le Mire, Suzanne; Owens, Rosemary ''A propitious moment?: Workplace bullying and regulation of the legal profession'' University of New South Wales Law Journal, The Volume 37 Issue 3 (Dec 2014)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201001112/http://www.unswlawjournal.unsw.edu.au/sites/default/files/t1_le_mire_and_owens.pdf |date=2015-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women, trainees and solicitors who have been qualified for five years or less are more impacted, as are ethnic minority lawyers and lesbian, gay and bisexual lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journalonline.co.uk/News/1009923.aspx#.VMfxpyzp-24 Society publishes guidance on tackling bullying in solicitor profession] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201001313/http://www.journalonline.co.uk/News/1009923.aspx |date=2015-02-01 }} The Journal of the Law Society of Scotland 27 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==== In medicine ====
{{Main|Bullying in medicine}}
Bullying in the [[medical profession]] is common, particularly of student or trainee doctors and of nurses. It is thought that this is at least in part an outcome of conservative traditional hierarchical structures and teaching methods in the medical profession, which may result in a bullying cycle.

==== In nursing ====
{{Main|Bullying in nursing}}
Even though The [[American Nurses Association]] believes that all nursing personnel have the right to work in safe, non-abusive environments, bullying has been identified as being particularly prevalent in the nursing profession although the reasons are not clear. It is thought that relational aggression (psychological aspects of bullying such as gossipping and intimidation) are relevant. Relational aggression has been studied among girls but not so much among adult women.&lt;ref name="RichardsEdwards2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nursingworld.org/Bullying-Workplace-Violence Workplace Violence Statistics {{cite journal | last =Dellasega | first =Cheryl A. | title =Bullying Among Nurses | journal =American Journal of Nursing | volume =109 | issue =1 | pages =52–58 | publisher =Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins | year =2009 | url =http://journals.lww.com/ajnonline/Abstract/2009/01000/Bullying_Among_Nurses.28.aspx | doi =10.1097/01.NAJ.0000344039.11651.08 | accessdate =2013-10-28 | pmid =19112267 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131031224030/http://journals.lww.com/ajnonline/Abstract/2009/01000/Bullying_Among_Nurses.28.aspx | archivedate =2013-10-31 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== In teaching ====
{{Main|Bullying in teaching}}
[[School]] [[teachers]] are commonly the subject of bullying but they are also sometimes the originators of bullying within a school environment.

=== In other areas ===
As the verb ''to bully'' is defined as simply "forcing one's way aggressively or by intimidation", the term may generally apply to any life experience where one is motivated primarily by intimidation instead of by more positive goals, such as mutually shared interests and benefits. As such, any figure of authority or power who may use intimidation as a primary means of motivating others, such as a neighborhood "protection racket don", a national dictator, a childhood ring-leader, a terrorist, a terrorist organization, or even a ruthless business CEO, could rightfully be referred to as a bully. According to psychologist Pauline Rennie-Peyton, we each face the possibility of being bullied in any phase of our lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Karim | first =Nadiya | title =Bullying in Universities: It exists | newspaper =The Independent | department =News: Education: Higher | publisher =The Independent | date =2010-01-15 | url =https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher/bullying-in-universities-it-exists-1869267.html | accessdate =2013-10-29 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131216063925/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher/bullying-in-universities-it-exists-1869267.html | archivedate =2013-12-16 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inanimate objects ===
Children have been observed bullying anthropomorphic robots designed to assist the elderly. Their attacks start with blocking the robots' paths of movement and then escalate to verbal abuse, hitting and destroying the object. Seventy-five percent of the kids interviewed perceived the robot as "human-like" yet decided to abuse it anyway, while 35% of the kids who beat up the robot actually did so "for enjoyment.".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/kids-attack-bully-robot-japanese-mall-danger-avoidance-ai-2015-8?IR=T|title=Scientists are teaching robots to avoid children — because kids can be surprisingly mean|work=Business Insider|access-date=2017-11-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responding to bullying ==
Bullying is typically ongoing and not isolated behaviour. Common ways that people try to respond, are to try to ignore it, to confront the bullies or to turn to an authority figure to try and address it.

Ignoring it often does nothing to stop the bullying continuing, and it can become worse over time.&lt;ref&gt;W. Craig et al., [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0143034307084136 "Responding to bullying, what works"]&lt;/ref&gt;
It can be important to address bullying behaviour early on, as it can be easier to control the earlier it is detected.&lt;ref&gt;W. Ci, [https://carleton.ca/economics/wp-content/uploads/bullying_paper_1-6.pdf "What can be done to stop bullying among children? Evidence from Canada"]&lt;/ref&gt;
Bystanders play an important role in responding to bullying, as doing nothing can encourage it to continue, while small steps that oppose the behaviour can reduce it.&lt;ref&gt;Bully-zero Australia Foundation, [http://bzaf.org.au/respond-to-bullying/ "Respond to bullying"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Authority figures can play an important role, such as parents in child or adolescent situations, or supervisors, human-resources staff or parent-bodies in workplace and volunteer settings. Authority figures can be influential in recognising and stopping bullying behaviour, and creating an environment where it doesn't continue.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.stopbullying.gov/respond/on-the-spot/index.html "Stop bullying on the spot"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Safe work Australia, [https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/doc/guide-preventing-and-responding-workplace-bullying "Guide for preventing and responding to workplace bullying"]&lt;/ref&gt;
In many situations however people acting as authority figures are untrained and unqualified, do not know how to respond, and can make the situation worse.&lt;ref&gt;Veronica Birkett, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/bullied-dont-tell-the-teacher-1361862.html "Bullied? Don't tell the teacher"]&lt;/ref&gt;
In some cases the authority figures even support the people doing the bullying, facilitating it continuing and increasing the isolation and marginalising of the target.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ethicsinvolunteering.wordpress.com/responding-to-bullying-in-arc-unsw-sports/ "Responding to bullying in Arc UNSW sports"]&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of the most effective ways to respond, are to recognise that harmful behaviour is taking place, and creating an environment where it won't continue.&lt;ref name=field03&gt;E. Field, [http://www.aph.gov.au/parliamentary_business/committees/house_of_representatives_committees?url=ee/bullying/subs/sub58.pdf "The prevalence of workplace bullying in Australia"]&lt;/ref&gt;
People that are being targeted have little control over which authority figures they can turn to and how such matters would be addressed, however one means of support is to find a counsellor or psychologist that is trained in handling bullying.

== Etymology ==
The word "[[bully]]" was first used in the 1530s meaning "sweetheart", applied to either sex, from the Dutch ''boel'' "lover, brother", probably diminutive of [[Middle High German]] ''buole'' "brother", of uncertain origin (compare with the German ''buhle'' "lover"). The meaning deteriorated through the 17th century through "fine fellow", "blusterer", to "harasser of the weak". This may have been as a connecting sense between "lover" and "ruffian" as in "protector of a prostitute", which was one sense of "bully" (though not specifically attested until 1706). The verb "to bully" is first attested in 1710.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =bully | work =Online Etymology Dictionary | publisher =Douglas Harper | url =http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bully | accessdate =2013-10-28 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131029195402/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bully | archivedate =2013-10-29 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, in American culture, the term has been used differently, as an exclamation/exhortation, in particular famously associated with [[Theodore Roosevelt]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shapell.org/manuscript/theodore-roosevelt-bully-for-you ''TR Correspondence 27 September 1907''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416024951/http://www.shapell.org/manuscript/theodore-roosevelt-bully-for-you |date=16 April 2016 }} "bully for you" in the positive sense&lt;/ref&gt; and continuing to the present in the [[bully pulpit]] and also as faint/deprecating praise ("bully for him").

The '''Cognitive Research Trust''' was founded by the [[Malta|Maltese]] physician and cognitive specialist [[Edward de Bono]] in July 1969. The trust uses a number of thinking tools based on the premise that thinking is a skill that can be developed and learned. CoRT lessons have been taught in schools worldwide, including the third world. [[Bangladesh]] has profited by application of CoRT tools.{{Clarify|date=March 2009}}&lt;ref&gt;Journal of the creative Bangladeshi, 1979, v3, p315-319.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bangladesh, Self, and Creative Juices, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2938">'''Compossibility''' is a philosophical concept from [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]. According to Leibniz, a complete individual thing (for example a person) is characterized by all its properties, and these determine its relations with other individuals. The existence of one individual may contradict the existence of another. A possible world is made up of individuals that are '''compossible'''&amp;mdash;that is, individuals that can exist together. Leibniz indicates that a world is a set of compossible things, however, that a world is a kind of collection of things that God could bring into existence. For not even God can bring into existence a world in which there is some contradiction among its members or their properties.&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/leibniz-modal/&lt;/ref&gt;

When Leibniz speaks of a possible world, he means a set of compossible, finite things that God could have brought into existence if he were not constrained by the goodness that is part of his nature. The actual world, on the other hand, is simply that set of finite things that is instantiated by God, because it is greatest in goodness, reality and perfection. Naturally, the fact that we are here experiencing this world—the actual world—means that there is at least one possible world. In Leibniz's view, there are an infinite number of possible worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brown |first=Gregory |year=1987 |title=Compossibility, Harmony, and Perfection in Leibniz |journal=The Philosophical Review |volume=96 |issue=2 |pages=173–203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' entry on Leibniz's Modal Metaphysics by Brandon C. Look, views on "compossibility" and the closely related [[best of all possible worlds]] argument are to be found  in ''On the Ultimate Origination of Things'', ''The Discourse in Metaphysics'', ''On Freedom'', and throughout his works. The term itself is found in ''The Philosophical Writings III'' [''Die philosophischen Schriften III''] when Leibniz writes to [[Louis Bourguet]].&lt;ref name="Leibniz's Modal Mechanics"&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/leibniz-modal/ | title = Leibniz's Modal Metaphysics | date = 2008-05-23 | accessdate = 2010-01-22 | publisher = ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' | location = Palo Alto, California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alain Badiou]] borrows this concept in defining philosophy as the creation of a "space of compossibility" for heterogeneous [[truth]]s.

[[Gilles Deleuze]] uses it in ''Cinema II'' taking support from Leibniz's explanation of the [[problem of future contingents]].

In modern [[literary criticism]], in particular of [[genre fiction]], '''conceit''' frequently means an extended [[rhetorical device]], summed up in a short phrase, that refers to a situation which either does not exist or exists very infrequently but which is necessary to the plot. "Faster than light travel" and "superior alien science" are examples from [[science fiction]]; the "hardboiled private gumshoe" is an example from [[detective stories]].

The word conceit was originally coined in the context of [[poetry]], deriving from the root ''concept, conceive''. It has subsequently been extended to other forms of literature, the [[performing arts]], [[painting]], [[photography]], and even [[architecture]].

== Use as praise versus criticism ==

The term '''conceit''' can be used positively or derogatorily.

* In the positive sense, a conceit originally referred to an [[extended metaphor]] with a complex [[logic]] that governs a poetic passage or entire [[poem]]. By juxtaposing, [[:wikt:usurp|usurping]] and [[Psychological manipulation|manipulating]] images and ideas in surprising ways, a conceit invites the reader into a more sophisticated understanding of an object of comparison. Conceits in English are part of the poetic idiom of [[Mannerism]], during the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century. This has been extended to describe presentation of any material whose creator uses one or more techniques to effectively induce a desired effect on the reader or viewer, such as setting a mood. In movie-making, examples include deliberately filming in black and white, emphasizing shadows, using panoramic views or employing extended zoom for a scene.
* In a derogatory sense, "conceit" refers to an excessively elaborate, contrived or unconvincing approach to the material being presented, such as a fundamentally flawed idea, preposterous plot device, or pretentious dialog or phrasing. Again, this was originally applied to poetry that someone disliked, and the areas of application later broadened. An example of derogatory use is in the title of economist [[Friedrich Hayek]]'s book, "The Fatal Conceit: The Errors of Socialism" &lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Hayek. The Fatal Conceit: The Errors of Socialism.. https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0226321150&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern writing (e.g., reviews of movies or books, or descriptions of others' inventions or ideas), the word "conceit", when used by itself without preceding adjectives (such as "brilliant" or "unpersuasive"), tends to be used more often as criticism than as praise. Such use is especially common when writing for a broad audience rather than specialists in poetry or literary criticism. Which sense is actually intended, however, must be inferred from the overall content and tone of the passage containing the phrase.

== In poetry ==
===Metaphysical===
[[File:Jonquil Masquerade.jpg|thumb|The flowers are beginning their masquerade as people. [[Narcissus jonquilla|Sir Jonquil]] begins the fun. ([[Walter Crane]], 1899)]]
In [[English literature]] the term is generally associated with the 17th century [[metaphysical poets]], an extension of contemporary usage. The [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] conceit differs from an extended analogy in the sense that it does not have a clear-cut relationship between the things being compared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stephen Cushman|author2=Clare Cavanagh|author3=Jahan Ramazani|author4=Paul Rouzer|title=The Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics: Fourth Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uKiC6IeFR2UC&amp;pg=PA290|date=26 August 2012|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|isbn=1-4008-4142-9|page=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Helen Gardner (critic)|Helen Gardner]]&lt;ref&gt;Helen Gardner (1961) ''The Metaphysical Poets'' ([[Oxford University Press]]) "Introduction" p. xxiii.&lt;/ref&gt; observed that "a conceit is a comparison whose ingenuity is more striking than its justness" and that "a comparison becomes a conceit when we are made to concede likeness while being strongly conscious of unlikeness." An example of the latter occurs in [[John Donne]]'s "A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning", in which a couple faced with absence from each other is likened to a compass.

&lt;poem&gt;
Dull sublunary lovers' love
   (Whose soul is sense) cannot admit
Absence, because it doth remove
   Those things which elemented it.

But we by a love so much refined,
   That our selves know not what it is,
Inter-assured of the mind,
   Care less, eyes, lips, and hands to miss.

Our two souls therefore, which are one,
   Though I must go, endure not yet
A breach, but an expansion,
   Like gold to airy thinness beat.

If they be two, they are two so
   As stiff twin compasses are two;
Thy soul, the fixed foot, makes no show
   To move, but doth, if the other do.

And though it in the center sit,
   Yet when the other far doth roam,
It leans and hearkens after it,
   And grows erect, as that comes home.

Such wilt thou be to me, who must,
   Like th' other foot, obliquely run;
Thy firmness makes my circle just,
   And makes me end where I begun. &lt;/poem&gt;

The metaphysical conceit is often imaginative, exploring specific parts of an experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert H. Ray|title=An Andrew Marvell Companion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_buTeQdwnKsC&amp;pg=PA106|year=1998|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|isbn=978-0-8240-6248-4|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Donne]]'s "[[s:The Flea|''The Flea'']]" is a poem seemingly about fleas in a bed. When [[Philip Sydney|Sir Philip Sidney]] begins a [[sonnet]] with the conventional idiomatic expression "My true-love hath my heart and I have his",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luminarium.org/renlit/truelove.htm |title=Sir Philip Sidney. "My true love hath my heart, and I have his." Love sonnet from "Arcadia." |publisher=Luminarium.org |accessdate=2013-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; he takes the metaphor literally and teases out a number of literal possibilities in the exchange of hearts. The result is a fully formed conceit.

===Petrarchan===
The [[Petrarch]]an conceit is a form of love poetry wherein a man's love interest is referred to in [[hyperbole]]. For instance, the lover is a ship on a stormy sea, and his mistress is either "a cloud of dark disdain" or the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Najat Ismaeel Sayakhan|title=THE TEACHING PROBLEMS OF ENGLISH POETRY IN THE ENGLISH DEPARTMENTS|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mhlBBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA58|date=8 July 2014|publisher=[[Author House]]|isbn=978-1-4969-8399-2|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The paradoxical pain and pleasure of lovesickness is often described using [[oxymoron]], for instance uniting peace and war, burning and freezing, and so forth. But images which were novel in the sonnets of [[Petrarch]], in his innovative exploration of human feelings, became clichés in the poetry of later imitators. Romeo uses hackneyed Petrarchan conceits when describing his love for Rosaline as "bright smoke, cold fire, sick health".

== Etymology ==
In the [[Renaissance]], the term (which is related to the word [[concept]]) indicated any particularly fanciful expression of [[wit]], and was later used pejoratively of outlandish poetic metaphors.

Recent [[literary criticism|literary critics]] have used the term to mean simply the style of extended and heightened metaphor common in the Renaissance and particularly in the 17th century, without any particular indication of value. Within this critical sense, the Princeton Encyclopedia makes a distinction between two kinds of conceits: the Metaphysical conceit, described above, and the [[Petrarch]]an conceit. In the latter, human experiences are described in terms of an outsized metaphor (a kind of metaphorical [[hyperbole]]), like the stock comparison of eyes to the sun, which [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] makes light of in his [[Sonnet 130]]: "My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1094">'''Conceptual necessity''' is a property of the certainty with which a state of affairs, as presented by a certain description, occurs: it occurs by conceptual necessity if and only if it occurs just by virtue of the meaning of the description. If someone is a [[bachelor]], for instance, then he is bound to be unmarried by conceptual necessity, because the meaning of the word "bachelor" determines that he is.

Alternatively, there is [[metaphysical necessity]], which is a certainty determined, not by the meaning of a description, but instead by facts in the world described.

Historically, [[Baruch Spinoza]] was a subscriber to this belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza-modal/notes.html |title=Notes to Spinoza's Modal Metaphysics |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=2013 |accessdate=May 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5331">The '''contorsion tensor''' in [[differential geometry]] is the difference between a [[connection (vector bundle)|connection]] with and without [[Torsion tensor|torsion]] in it.  It commonly appears in the study of [[spin connection]]s. Thus, for example, a [[vielbein]] together with a spin connection, when subject to the condition of vanishing torsion, gives a description of Einstein gravity. For [[supersymmetry]], the same constraint, of vanishing torsion, gives (the field equations of) 11-dimensional [[supergravity]].&lt;ref&gt;Urs Schreiber, "[https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/11d-gravity-just-torsion-constraint/ 11d Gravity From Just the Torsion Constraint]" (2016)&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the contorsion tensor, along with the connection, becomes one of the dynamical objects of the theory, demoting the metric to a secondary, derived role.

The elimination of torsion in a connection is referred to as the ''absorption of torsion'', and is one of the steps of [[Cartan's equivalence method]] for establishing the equivalence of geometric structures.

==Metric geometry==
In [[metric geometry]], the contorsion tensor expresses the difference between a [[Metric_connection#Metric_compatibility|metric-compatible]]  [[affine connection]] with [[Christoffel symbol]] &lt;math&gt; \Gamma_{ij}{}^k&lt;/math&gt;  and the unique torsion-free [[Levi-Civita connection]] for the same metric.

The contorsion tensor &lt;math&gt;{K_{ab}}^c&lt;/math&gt; is defined in terms of the [[torsion tensor]] &lt;math&gt;{T_{ij}}^k= {\Gamma_{ij}}^k -{\Gamma_{ji}}^k &lt;/math&gt; as 

:&lt;math&gt;K_{ijk}= \frac{1}{2} (T_{ijk} - T_{jki} + T_{kij}  ),&lt;/math&gt;

where  the indices  are being raised and lowered with respect to the metric:

:&lt;math&gt;T_{ijk} \equiv  g_{kl} {T_{ij}}^l&lt;/math&gt;.

The reason for the non-obvious sum in the definition  is that   the  contorsion tensor, being  the difference between two metric-compatible Christoffel symbols, must be   antisymmetric in the last two indices, whilst the torsion tensor itself is antisymmetric in its first two indices.

The  connection can now be written as 

:&lt;math&gt; {\Gamma_{kj}}^i =\bar\Gamma_{kj}{}^i + {K_{kj}}^i,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \bar\Gamma_{kj}{}^i &lt;/math&gt; is the torsion-free Levi-Civita connection.

It can be shown that the geodesics for both connections are the same: that is, the any geodesic of &lt;math&gt; \bar\Gamma_{kj}{}^i &lt;/math&gt; is also a geodesic of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{kj}{}^i &lt;/math&gt; and ''vice-versa''.

==Affine geometry==
In [[affine geometry]], one does not have a metric nor a metric connection, and so one is not free raise and lower indices on demand. One can still achieve a similar effect by making use of the [[solder form]], allowing the bundle to be related to what is happening on its base space. This is an explicitly geometric viewpoint, with tensors now being geometric objects in the [[vertical and horizontal bundles]] of a [[fiber bundle]], instead of being indexed algebraic objects defined only on the base space. In this case, one may construct a contorsion tensor, living as a [[one-form]] on the tangent bundle. 

Recall that the [[torsion form|torsion]] of a connection &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as 
:&lt;math&gt;\Theta_\omega = D\theta = d\theta + \omega \wedge \theta&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the [[solder form]] ([[tautological one-form]]). The subscript &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; serves only as a reminder that this torsion tensor was obtained from the connection.

That is, one may construct a tensor 
:&lt;math&gt;\Sigma_\omega(X,Y,Z)=\langle\theta(Z), \Theta_\omega(X,Y)\rangle +
\langle\theta(Y), \Theta_\omega(Z,X)\rangle 
- \langle\theta(X), \Theta_\omega(Y,Z)\rangle
&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;\langle,\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is the scalar product. This tensor can be expressed as&lt;ref&gt;David Bleecker, "[https://zulfahmed.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/88623149-bleecker-d-gauge-theory-and-variational-principles-aw-1981-ka-t-201s-pqgf.pdf Gauge Theory and Variational Principles]" (1982) D. Reidel Publishing ''(See theorem 6.2.5)''&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Sigma_\omega(X,Y,Z)=2\langle\theta(Z), \sigma_\omega(X)\theta(Y)\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

The quantity &lt;math&gt;\sigma_\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the '''contorsion form''' and is ''exactly'' what is needed to add to an arbitrary connection to get the torsion-free Levi-Civita connection.  That is, given an [[Ehresmann connection]] &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;, there is another connection &lt;math&gt;\omega+\sigma_\omega&lt;/math&gt; that is torsion-free.

The vanishing of the torsion is then equivalent to having 

:&lt;math&gt;\Theta_{\omega+\sigma_\omega} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
or 
:&lt;math&gt;d\theta = - (\omega +\sigma_\omega) \wedge \theta&lt;/math&gt;

This can be viewed as a [[field equation]] relating the dynamics of the connection to that of the contorsion tensor.

==Relationship to teleparallelism==
In the theory of [[teleparallelism]], one encounters a connection, the Weitzenböck connection, which is flat (vanishing Riemann curvature) but has a non-vanishing torsion. The flatness is exactly what allows parallel frame fields to be constructed. These notions can be extended to [[supermanifold]]s.&lt;ref name="dewitt"&gt;[[Bryce DeWitt]], ''Supermanifolds'', (1984) Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0521 42377 5}} ''(See the subsection "distant parallelism" of section 2.7.)''&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''corner solution''' is a special solution to an [[Agent (economics)|agent]]'s [[Maximization (economics)|maximization]] problem in which the quantity of one of the arguments in the maximized function is [[0 (number)|zero]]. In non-technical terms,:3 a corner solution is when the chooser is either unwilling or unable to make a tradeoff.  In economics when someone says "I wouldn't buy that at any price" or "I will do X no matter the cost", those are corner solutions.  Another example is "zero-tolerance" policies, or parents who are unwilling to expose their children to any risk, no matter how small and no matter what the benefits of the activity might be.  "Nothing is more important than my child's safety" is a corner solution in its refusal to admit there might be tradeoffs.  The term "corner solution" is sometimes used by economists in a more colloquial fashion to refer to these sorts of situations.  The word "corner" refers to the fact that if one graphs the maximization problem, the optimal point will occur at the "corner" created by the budget constraint and one axis.

A corner solution is an instance where the "best" solution (i.e. maximizing profit, or utility, or whatever value is sought) is achieved based not on the market-efficient maximization of related quantities, but rather based on brute-force boundary conditions. Such a solution lacks [[mathematical elegance]], and most examples are characterized by externally forced conditions (such as "variables ''x'' and ''y'' cannot be negative") that put the actual [[local extrema]] outside the permitted values.

The more usual solution will lie in the non-zero interior at the point of tangency between the [[objective function]] and the constraint. For example, in [[consumer theory]] the objective function is the [[indifference curve|indifference-curve]] map (the [[utility function]]) of the consumer.  The budget line is the constraint.  In the usual case, constrained utility is maximized on the budget constraint with strictly positive quantities consumed of both goods.  For a corner solution, however, utility is maximized at a point on one axis where the budget constraint intersects the highest attainable indifference curve at zero consumption for one good with all income used for the other good.  Furthermore, a range of lower prices for the good with initial zero consumption may leave quantity demanded unchanged at zero, rather than increasing it as in the more usual case.

Another technical way to state it is that a corner solution is a solution to a minimization or maximization problem where the non-corner solution is infeasible, that is, not in the domain. Instead, the solution is a corner solution on an axis where either ''x'' or ''y'' is equal to zero. For instance, from the example above in economics, if the maximal utility of two goods is achieved when the quantity of goods ''x'' and ''y'' are (−2,&amp;nbsp;5), and the utility is subject to the constraint ''x'' and ''y'' are greater than or equal to 0 (one cannot consume a negative quantity of goods) as is usually the case, then the actual solution to the problem would be a corner solution where ''x'' = 0.

The '''Defence Evaluation and Research Agency''' (normally known as '''DERA''') was a part of the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|UK Ministry of Defence]] (MoD) between 1995 and 2 July 2001. At the time it was the United Kingdom's largest science and technology organisation. 

== Formation and Operation ==
DERA was formed in April 1995 as an [[wikt:amalgamation|amalgamation]] of the following organisations: 
*[[Defence Research Agency]] (DRA) which was set up in April 1991 and comprised 
**[[Royal Aircraft Establishment|Royal Aerospace Establishment]] (RAE)
**[[Admiralty Research Establishment]] (ARE)
**[[Royal Armament Research and Development Establishment]] (RARDE)
**[[Royal Signals and Radar Establishment]] (RSRE)
*[[Defence Test and Evaluation Organisation]] (DTEO)
*[[Defence CBRN Centre|Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment]] (CBDE at [[Porton Down]]), which became part of the Protection and Life Sciences Division (PLSD)
*[[Centre for Defence Analysis]] (CDA).

The chief executive throughout DERA's existence was [[John Chisholm (executive)|John Chisholm]]. DERA's staffing level was around 9000 scientists, technologists and support staff.

== Dissolution ==
DERA was split into two organisations, based on short-lived transition bodies known as PDERA ("privatised" DERA) - becoming a [[commerce|commercial]] firm, [[QinetiQ]] - and "RDERA" ( "retained" in Government DERA) - becoming the [[Defence Science and Technology Laboratory]] (Dstl).

At the split, QinetiQ was formed from the majority (about 3/4 of the staff and most of the facilities) of DERA, with Dstl assuming responsibility for those aspects which were best done in government. A few examples of the work undertaken by Dstl include [[nuclear reaction|nuclear]], [[chemical]], and [[Biological warfare|biological]] [[research]]. In the time since the split both organisations have undergone significant change programmes. QinetiQ has increased its focus on overseas research with a number of US and other foreign acquisitions, whereas Dstl has a major rationalisation programme.

In [[Rinzai school|Rinzai-Zen]], ''inka shōmei'' is ideally "the formal recognition of Zen's deepest realisation",{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=54}} but practically it is being used for the transmission of the "true lineage" of the masters (''shike'') of the training halls.{{sfn|Borup|2008|p=13}} There are only about fifty&lt;ref name=Antaiji10 group=web /&gt; to eighty&lt;ref group=web name="Buddhadharma"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://archive.thebuddhadharma.com/issues/2002/winter/dictionary-roshi_winter02.htm |title=Buddhadharma, Dharma Dictionary, ''Roshi'' |access-date=2012-12-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121204133920/http://archive.thebuddhadharma.com/issues/2002/winter/dictionary-roshi_winter02.htm |archive-date=2012-12-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of such ''inka shōmei''-bearers in Japan.

In [[Sōtō|Sōtō-Zen]], dharma transmission (shiho) provides access to only a relatively low grade. It is listed as a requirement for the very lowest ecclesiastical status, that of an instructor third class (''[[Zen ranks and hierarchy|santō kyōshi]]''){{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=276}} further training is required to become an [[oshō]].&lt;ref name =Antaiji2 group=web /&gt;

==History==
{{see also|Chinese Chán|Bodhidharma}}

The notion and practice of Dharma Transmission developed early in the history of Chán, as a means to gain credibility{{sfn|McRae|2003}} and to foster institutional ties among the members of the Chán-community.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008}} Charts of dharma-lineages were developed, which represented the continuity of the Buddhist dharma. Originally these lineages only included the Chinese Patriarchs, but they were later extended to twenty-eight Indian Patriarchs and seven Buddhas.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005}}

===Chán lineage===
{{See also|Zen lineage charts}}

The Chán-tradition developed from the established tradition of "Canonical Buddhism",{{sfn|Chappell|1993|p=177}}{{clarify|reason=This sfn reference missing long-form citation|date=August 2014}} which "remained normative for all later Chinese Buddhism".{{sfn|Chappell|1993|p=177}}{{clarify|reason=This sfn reference missing long-form citation|date=August 2014}} It was established by the end of the sixth century, as a result of the Chinese developing understanding of Buddhism in the previous centuries.{{sfn|Chappell|1993|p=177-184}}{{clarify|reason=This sfn reference missing long-form citation|date=August 2014}}{{sfn|Lai}}{{clarify|reason=This sfn reference missing long-form citation; missing year;|date=August 2014}}

One of the inventions of this Canonical Buddhism were transmission lists, a literary device to establish a lineage. Both [[Tiantai|T'ien Tai]] and Chán took over this literary device, to lend authority to those developing traditions, and guarantee its authenticity:{{sfn|Chappell|1993|p=181}}{{clarify|reason=This sfn reference missing long-form citation|date=August 2014}}{{sfn|McRae|p=2-9}}{{clarify|reason=This sfn reference missing year|date=August 2014}}
{{quote|Chan texts present the school as Buddhism itself, or as ''the'' central teaching of Buddhism, which has been transmitted from the seven Buddhas of the past to the twenty-eight patriarchs, and all the generations of Chinese and Japanese Chan and Zen masters that follow.{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=4}}}}

The concept of dharma transmission took shape during the Tang period, when establishing the right teachings became important, to safeguard the authority of specific schools.{{sfn|Ford|2006|pp=22-25}} The emerging Zen-tradition developed the ''Transmission of the Lamp''-genre, in which lineages from Shakyamuni Buddha up to their own times were described.{{sfn|McRae|2003}}

Another literary device for establishing those traditions was given by the ''Kao-seng-chuan'' (Biographies of Eminent Monks), compiled around 530.{{sfn|Chappell|1993|p=181}}{{clarify|reason=This sfn reference missing long-form citation|date=August 2014}} The Chán-tradition developed its own corpus in this genre, with works such as ''Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall'' (952) and the ''[[Transmission of the Lamp|Jingde Records of the Transmission of the Lamp]]'' (published 1004). McRae considers Dumoulin's ''A History of Zen'' to be a modern example of this genre, disguised as scientific history.{{sfn|McRae|2005}}{{clarify|reason=This sfn reference missing long-form citation|date=August 2014}}

===Chinese Patriarchs===
The Chán-lineages picture the Indian monk Bodhidharma as the patriarch who brought Chán to China. Only scarce historical information is available about him, but his hagiography developed when the Chan tradition grew stronger and gained prominence in the early 8th century.

====Six Chinese Patriarchs====
By this time a lineage of the six ancestral founders of Chán in China was developed.{{sfn|McRae|2003}} In the late 8th century, under the influence of Huineng's student [[Shenhui]], the traditional form of this lineage had been established:{{sfn|McRae|2003}}
# [[Bodhidharma]] ({{lang|zh|達摩}}) ca. 440 – ca. 528
# [[Huike]] ({{lang|zh|慧可}}) 487–593
# [[Sengcan]] ({{lang|zh|僧燦}}) ?–606
# [[Daoxin]] ({{lang|zh|道信}}) 580–651
# [[Daman Hongren|Hongren]] ({{lang|zh|弘忍}}) 601–674
# [[Huineng]] ({{lang|zh|慧能}}) 638–713

====Shenhui and Huineng====
[[File:Huineng-tearing-sutras.svg|thumb|left|100px|Huineng tearing sutras]]
According to tradition, the sixth and last ancestral founder, [[Huineng]] (惠能; 638–713), was one of the giants of Chán history, and all surviving schools regard him as their ancestor. The dramatic story of Huineng's life tells that there was a controversy over his claim to the title of patriarch. After being chosen by [[Daman Hongren|Hongren]], the fifth ancestral founder, Huineng had to flee by night to [[Nanhua Temple]] in the south to avoid the wrath of Hongren's jealous senior disciples.

Modern scholarship, however, has questioned this [[Zen#Zen narratives|narrative]]. Historic research reveals that this story was created around the middle of the 8th century, beginning in 731 by [[Shenhui]], a successor to Huineng, to win influence at the Imperial Court. He claimed Huineng to be the successor of Hongren's, instead of the then publicly recognized successor Shenxiu.{{sfn|McRae|2003}} In 745 Shen-hui was invited to take up residence in the Ho-tse temple in Lo-yang. In 753 he fell out of grace, and had to leave the capital to go into exile. The most prominent of the successors of his lineage was [[Guifeng Zongmi]]{{sfn|Yampolski|2003|p=9}} According to Tsung-mi, Shen-hui's approach was officially sanctioned in 796, when "an imperial commission determined that the Southern line of Ch'an represented the orthodox transmission and established Shen-hui as the seventh patriarch, placing an inscription to that effect in the shen-lung temple".{{sfn|Gregory|1991|p=279}}

Doctrinally the Southern School is associated with the teaching that [[Subitism|enlightenment is sudden]], while the [[Northern School]] is associated with the teaching that enlightenment is gradual. This was a polemical exaggeration, since both schools were derived from the same tradition, and the so-called Southern School incorporated many teachings of the more influential Northern School.{{sfn|McRae|2003}} Eventually both schools died out, but the influence of Shenhui was so immense that all later Chan schools traced their origin to Huineng, and "sudden enlightenment" became a standard doctrine of Chan.{{sfn|McRae|2003}}

===Indian Patriarchs===
In later writings this lineage was extended to include twenty-eight Indian patriarchs. In the ''[[Song of Enlightenment]]'' (證道歌 ''Zhèngdào gē'') of [[Yongjia Xuanjue]] (永嘉玄覺, 665–713), one of the chief disciples of [[Huineng|Huìnéng]], it is written that Bodhidharma was the 28th patriarch in a line of descent from Mahākāśyapa, a disciple of [[Gautama Buddha|Śākyamuni Buddha]], and the first patriarch of Chán Buddhism. {{sfn|Chang|1967}}

====Twenty-eight Indian Patriarchs====
[[Keizan|Keizan's]] ''Transmission of the Light'' gives twenty-eight patriarchs up to and including Bodhidharma in this transmission:{{sfn|Keizan|2003}}{{sfn|Diener|1991|p=266}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|For narratives in English of most patriarchs see Houn Jiyu (Peggy Teresa Nancy Kennett), 1999, ''Zen is Eternal Life'' (''Selling Water by the River''), Mount Shasta, California: Shasta Abbey Press.}}

{{Zen Lineage 28 Patriarchs}}

====Mahākāśyapa====
According to the traditional Chán accounts, the first Dharma transmission occurred as described in the [[Flower Sermon]]. The Buddha held up a golden [[lotus (plant)|lotus]] flower before an assembly of "gods and men". None who were in attendance showed any sign of understanding except his disciple [[Mahākāśyapa]], who offered only a smile. The Buddha then said, 
{{quote|I have the right Dharma Eye Treasury, the wondrous mind of nirvana, the reality beyond appearance. The Dharma-door of mind to mind transmission has been entrusted to Kāśyapa.&lt;ref name="epstein"&gt;Epstein, 130&lt;/ref&gt; Epstein comments, "Thus Mahākāśyapa received the transmission of Dharma and became the first Buddhist patriarch."&lt;ref name="epstein"/&gt;}}

==Function of Dharma Transmission==
Though dharma transmission implies the acknowledgement of insight into the teachings of Buddhism as understood by the Zen tradition, especially [[kensho|seeing into one's true nature]], dharma transmission is also a means to establish a person into the Zen tradition:{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=23}}
{{quote|The procedure establishes the disciple as a transmitting teacher in their own right and successor in an unbroken [[Lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]] of teachers and disciples, a spiritual 'bloodline' (''[[kechimyaku]]'') theoretically traced back to the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] himself."&lt;ref name="Haskel, 2"/&gt;}}

The dharma lineage reflects the importance of family-structures in ancient China, and forms a symbolic and ritual recreation of this system for the monastical "family".{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=264}}

===Esoteric and exoteric transmission===
According to Borup the emphasis on 'mind to mind transmission' is a form of esoteric transmission, in which "the tradition and the enlightened mind is transmitted face to face".{{sfn|Borup|2008|p=9}} Metaphorically this can be described as the transmission of a flame from one candle to another candle,{{sfn|Borup|2008|p=9}} or the transmission from one vein to another.{{sfn|Faure|2000|p=58}} In exoteric transmission the requirement is  "direct access to the teaching through a personal discovery of one's self. This type of transmission and identification is symbolized by the discovery of a shining lantern, or a mirror."{{sfn|Borup|2008|p=9}}

This polarity is recognizable in the emphasis that the Zen-tradition puts on maintaining the correct Dharma transmission, while simultaneously stressing seeing into one's nature:
{{quote|The matter of learning from a teacher is most essential. People of old who arrived at the source of [[Kensho|seeing nature]], passed through many barriers clearly and completely without a dot of doubt, and traveled freely through the world opening big mouths in discussion, only came to know the transcendental message of Zen after they finally ran into Zen masters of great vision. Then they sincerely sought certainty and wound up with the duty of the teacher's succession, bearing the debt of Dharma, never to forget it for a moment. This is called dharma succession. Since ancient times the designated succession of the ancestral teachers has always been like this.{{sfn|Torei|2010|p=88}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The modern framing of Zen as the ''experience'' of 'ultimate truth' or reality{{sfn|Sharf|2005}} may influence the institutional shape western Zen is going to take, where individual freedom is highly appraised. See also Bodiford 2008, pp 277-279}}}}

Nevertheless, while the Zen tradition has always stressed the importance of formal Dharma transmission, there are well known examples of [[Mushi dokugo]], such as [[Nōnin]], [[Jinul]] and [[Suzuki Shōsan]] who attained awakening on their own, though all of them were familiair with the Zen-teachings.

===Family structure===
According to Bodiford, "Zen is the predominant form of Buddhism because of dharma transmission":{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=264}}
{{quote|[I]t has ancestors whom it honors. It honors those ancestors by transmitting their legacy to proper descendants, from generation to generation, who will maintain and carry on their family traditions [...] [I]n Zen this process of transmitting a family legacy is given structural form through the ritual of dharma transmission.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=264}}}}

Bodiford distinguishes seven dimensions which are discernible in both family relationships and in dharma lineages:
# Ancestral dimension: "Ancestors (''so'') constitute a fundamental source of power".{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=264}} Performing rituals in honour of the ancestors keeps them in high regard "among the living".{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=264}}
# Biological dimension: the dharma lineage creates (spiritual) offspring, just as the family creates new life.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|pp=264-265}}
# Linguistic dimension: dharma heirs receive new names, which reflect their tie to the dharma 'family'.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=265}}
# Ritual dimension: rituals confirm the family relationships. One's teacher is honored in rituals, as are deceased teachers.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|pp=265-266}}
# Legal dimension: teachers have the obligation to discipline their students, just as students have the obligation to obey their teachers.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=266}}
# Institutional and financial dimension: dharma heirs have an obligation to support their home temple, both financially and ritually.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|pp=266-267}}
# Temporal dimension: long-term relationships foster the previous dimensions.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=267}}

The family-model is easier recognized when East Asian languages are being used, because the same terminology is used to describe both earthly and spiritual family relations.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|pp=267-268}}

Dharma transmission is both concrete and abstract:{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=268}}
{{quote|Every link in the genealogy of dharma transmission occurs in documented historical circumstances: a specific place and time, identifiable individuals, and specific words and actions. At the same time, though, Zen texts also assert that true transmission consists of no transmission. In other words, it occurs only mind-to-mind.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=268}}}}

This feature gives dharma transmission a great flexibility:{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=268}}
{{quote|[W]hen the historical evidence is in one's favor, one can demonstrate the validity of dharma transmission by citing any number of the aforementioned seven dimensions. When the historical evidence is less favorable, then one can shift the argument to the religious realm by arguing that the only facts that really matter are the depths and quality of one's Buddha realization.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=268}}}}

==Contemporary use in the Zen-traditions==
Within the various Zen traditions dharma transmission got various meanings. A difference is made in most schools between 
{{quote|...acknowledgement of awakening itself [which] remained separate from monastic leadership.{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=54}}}}

===Chinese Chán===
Traditional Chinese Chán still exists in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, though it is less known in the west than Japanese Zen.

In the Chinese Buddhist tradition, there are 3 systems of transmission:&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.182828165075325.43405.100000444276511&amp;type=3 Ven Huei Guang Facebook photo album with dharma transmission explanation]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Tonsure system: a person becomes tonsured as a novice monastic under the Master's school. He/she is given a Dharma name 法號 at the time of tonsure based on the Master's lineage. This name is also called "the outer name 外號" because it is used by all people to address you. This name is used for life. At the same time, the Master will give the novice sramanera (or sramanerika) ten precepts.
# Ordination system: a novice will become fully ordained as a Bhikṣu monk/ Bhikṣuni nun with the Triple Platform Ordination (Observing the Śrāmanera, Bhikṣu and Bodhisattva precepts). This ordination must be presided by 10 monks with at least 10 years of seniority with a pure practice in upholding the monastic precepts. In this ceremony, the 10 Masters represent the Triple Gem accepting the novice into the Sangha. At this time, another Dharma name 法名 is given. This name is also called "precept name 戒名 or inner name 內號" because it is used only by one's Master. This name represents your precept lineage transmission.
# Dharma transmission system:{{sfn|Sharf|2005}}{{sfn|Adamek|2006}} This system upholds the Treasury of the True Dharma Eye through the generations of transmission. This is the Mind to Mind seal of the Dharma that is beyond the scriptures. At this time, another Dharma name 法名 is given. This is also called "the inner name 內號" and use only by one's Master. This name represents your Dharma lineage transmission. After receiving this name, one will use this name instead of the name received during precept ordination to write one's Dharma name (Inner Name)(Outer Name).

It is customary to refer to one's own tonsure Master as "Gracious Master", precept Master as "Root Master" and Dharma transmission Master as "Venerable Master". In [[Chinese Buddhism]], these 3 systems are separate and are not performed by the same Masters. Moreover, due to the strong emphasis on the Dharma, when a person receives the Dharma transmission, he/she is recognized as that Ch'an Master's Dharma son/daughter. Of course lay Buddhists may also receive this Dharma transmission, but there are very few incidences. Most of the monk/nun who received the transmission has already been tonsured and ordained by other Masters.

===Rinzai===
{{main article|Rinzai school}}

All Rinzai lineages pass through [[Hakuin Ekaku]], the 18th century revivalist, who considered himself to be an heir of Shoju Rojin (Shoju Ronin, Dokyu Etan, 1642–1721), though Hakuin never received formal dharma transmission from Shoju Rojin,{{sfn|Mohr|2003|p=311-312}} nor from any other teacher.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.patheos.com/blogs/monkeymind/2009/02/teaching-credentials-in-zen.html James Ford (2009), ''Teaching Credentials in Zen'']&lt;/ref&gt; When he was installed as head priest of Shōin-ji in 1718, he had the title of ''Dai-ichiza'', "First Monk":{{sfn|Waddell|2010|p=xxix}}
{{quote|It was the minimum rank required by government regulation for those installed as temple priests and seems to have been little more than a matter of paying a fee and registering Hakuin as the incumbent of Shōin-ji.{{sfn|Waddell|2010|p=xxix}}}}

All contemporary Rinzai-lineages stem from Inzan Ien (1751–1814) and Takuju Kosen (1760–1833),{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005|p=392}}{{sfn|Stevens|1999|p=90}} both students of Gasan Jito (1727–1797). Gasan is considered to be a dharma heir of Hakuin, though "he did not belong to the close circle of disciples and was probably not even one of Hakuin's dharma heirs".{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005|p=391}}

Through Hakuin, all contemporary Japanese Rinzai-lineages are part of the [[Ōtōkan]] lineage, brought to Japan in 1267 by [[Nanpo Jomyo]], who received dharma transmission in China in 1265.&lt;ref group=web name=ROZ&gt;[http://zen.rinnou.net/whats_zen/history.html#The%20Transmission%20of%20Zen%20to%20Japan Rinzai-Obaku Zen - What is Zen? - History]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Insight and succession====
In the [[Rinzai school]], a difference is made between acknowledgement of insight and succession in the organisation:
{{quote|From the Rinzai perspective, true realization (jisshō) and succession to a master (shijō) are two different stages in the course of practice, the latter implying a comprehensive integration of awakening in the activities of everyday life.{{sfn|Mohr|1994|p=359}}}}

According to Mohr, 
{{quote|In the Rinzai school the issue of Dharma transmission is essentially subjective, that is, left to the discretion of the master, and the ambiguity of terms such as "successor in the Dharma" (hassu 法嗣) has persisted down to the present. According to the context or the circumstances, it can signify either spiritual recognition or inheritance of a temple lineage.{{sfn|Mohr|1994|p=358}}}}

The most common form of transmission in Rinzai Zen is the acknowledgement that one has stayed in the monastery for a certain amount of time, and may later become a temple priest.{{sfn|Borup|2008|p=13}}

====Further practice====
After finishing the koan-study, further practice is necessary:
{{quote|[I]t would take 10 years to solve all the kôans [...] in the sôdô. After the student has solved all koans, he can leave the sôdô and live on his own, but he is still not considered a roshi. For this he has to complete another ten years of training, called "go-go-no-shugyô" in Japanese. Literally, this means "practice after satori/enlightenment", but [[Keido Fukushima|Fukushima]] preferred the translation "special practice". Fukushima would explain that the student builds up a "religious personality" during this decade. I would say it is a kind of period that functions to test if the student is actually able to live in regular society and apply his koan understanding to daily life, after he has lived in an environment that can be quite surreal and detached from the lives of the rest of humanity. Usually, the student lives in a small parish temple during this decade, not in a formal training monastery.&lt;ref name=Antaiji10 group=web&gt;[http://antaiji.dogen-zen.de/eng/201201.shtml Muho Noelke, ''Part 10: What does it take to become a full-fledged Sōtō-shu priest and is it really worth the whole deal?'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Inka shōmei====
The common transmission does not include ''inka shōmei''. Ideally ''inka shōmei'' is "the formal recognition of Zen's deepest realisation",{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=54}} but practically it is being used for the transmission of the "true lineage" of the masters (''shike'') of the training halls.{{sfn|Borup|2008|p=13}} Training halls are temples which are authorised for further training after being qualified as a temple priest.

There are only about fifty&lt;ref name=Antaiji10 group=web /&gt; to eighty&lt;ref group=web name="Buddhadharma" /&gt; of such ''inka shōmei''-bearers in Japan:
{{quote|In Rinzai Zen, it is relatively easy to say who is a roshi and who is not. Anyone who is authorized by another roshi (i.e. his teacher) is a roshi. This authorization (officially the "inka-shômei" document) is documented on a piece of paper, that is why it is also called colloquially "ichi-mai", that is "one sheet (of paper)". The transmission is totally vertical from teacher to student, no peer control is involved. That means that the Rinzai sect has no means to control who is made a roshi and who is not. In spite of that, the number of Rinzai roshis is relatively low, maybe around 50 or so.&lt;ref name=Antaiji10 group=web /&gt;}}

According to roshi Sokun Tsushimoto, the title of ''roshi'' is equivalent to ''Zen master'' and ''shike'':&lt;ref name="BD" /&gt;
{{quote|'Roshi' is the title compatible with the most formal title ‘Shike’ who got officially authorized as a Dharma successor by authentic master.&lt;ref name="BD"&gt;[http://boeddhistischdagblad.nl/rients-ritskes-op-beschuldiging-raksu-formeel-uitgereikt-als-bewijs-van-een-competent-zenleader/ Boeddhistisch Dagblad, 17 april 2013, ''Rients Ritskes op beschuldiging: ‘Raksu formeel uitgereikt als bewijs van competent zenleiderschap’''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420011852/http://boeddhistischdagblad.nl/rients-ritskes-op-beschuldiging-raksu-formeel-uitgereikt-als-bewijs-van-een-competent-zenleader/ |date=April 20, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For more information on Sokun Tsushimoto, see [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/fl20090802x1.html The Japan Times online: Caring for body and soul. Interview with Sokun Tsushimoto]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A qualified [[Zen master]] bestows inka only upon "those select few"{{sfn|Sharf|1995a|p=433}} who have successfully completed the entire Rinzai koan curriculum,{{sfn|Seager|1999|p=107}}&lt;ref&gt;Matthiessen, 277&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Sharf|1995a|p=433}} and "are eligible to serve as ''sōdō'' roshi,{{sfn|Sharf|1995a|p=433}} that is, master of a training hall, in distinction from a common temple:
{{quote|[D]isciples today are expected to spend a dozen or more years with a master to complete a full course of training in koan commentary. Only when a master is satisfied that a disciple can comment appropriately on a wide range of old cases will he recognize the latter as a dharma heir and give him formal "proof of transmission" (J. ''[[inka shomei]]''). Thus, in reality, a lot more than ''satori'' is required for one to be recognized as a master (J. ''shike'', ''roshi'') in the Rinzai school of Zen at present. The accepted proof of ''satori'' is a set of literary and rhetorical skills that takes many years to acquire.{{sfn|Griffith Foulk|2000|p=42}}}}

According to roshi Sokun Tsushimoto,
{{quote|Authorization as a Roshi should be done in the most formal and explicit way. In Rinzai tradition a master gives a calligraphy of Inka-certificate to disciple as a proof of authorization. Needless to say authorization must be backed up by the fact that the disciple spent many years in zen training under the master earnestly and continuously.&lt;ref name="BD" /&gt;}}

{{Nihongo|'''Inka Shōmei'''|印可証明|}} (''[[Korean language|Korean]]:'' '''Inga''') literally means "the legitimate seal of clearly furnished proof":{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=54}} 
{{quote|The ideogram for ''inka'' has two parts: ''in'' is on one side, ''ka'' is on the other. The root meaning resides in the character for ''in'' (''yin'' in Chinese). The right half of this ''in'' consists of an ancient character shaped like our modern ''P''. In ancient times the character represented an actual object. It stood for the image of just the right half ('''P''') of the emperor's official seal ('''IP'''), ''after'' the Emperor had broken in half the whole seal."&lt;ref name="austin"&gt;Austin, 266-267&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The right-hand portion of the seal was given to an individual who would then work by authority of the emperor, while the emperor himself would retain the left-hand portion. In ancient times inka usually came in the form of an actual document, but this practice is no longer commonplace.&lt;ref&gt;Hori, 674&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sōtō===
In Sōtō, dharma transmission is the acknowledgement of the ties between teacher and student. It has been subject to changes over the history of the Sōtō-school.{{sfn|Bodiford|1991}}

Though [[Dōgen]] emphasized the importance of the purity of the teachings, and highly valued lineage and dharma transmission, the Sōtō-school has its origins in various lineages and dharma transmissions.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|pp=270-271}} Dogen received dharma transmission from his Chinese teacher [[Rujing]], with whom he studied two years, but in medieval Sōtō he was also considered to be a dharma heir of Myōzen, a Rinzai-teacher, with whom he studied eight years.{{sfn|Bodiford|1991|p=426}} And [[Tettsū Gikai]], the dharma-grandson of Dogen, was also lineage-holder of [[Nōnin]], the founder of the Dharuma-shu, also a Rinzai-school.{{sfn|Bodiford|1991|pp=426-427}} Gikai passed this linegae over to [[Keizan]], who thereby was also lineage-holder in at least two lineages.{{sfn|Bodiford|1991|p=427}}

To make the history of Sōtō even more complicated, the [[Caodong]]-lineage that Dogen inherited through Rujing was passed on previously from the Caodong-master [[Dayang Jingxuan]] to [[Touzi Yiqing]] via the Rinzai-master Fushan Fayuan. Fushan Fayuan had once studied under Dayang Jingxuan. When Jingxuan died Fayuan had received Jingxuan's "portrait, robe, and a verse that expressed his teaching",{{sfn|Bodiford|1991|p=428}} promising "to pass them on to a suitable successor". Fayuan chose his student Touzi Yiqing to inherit this lineage,{{sfn|Bodiford|1991|p=428}} a fact that was acknowledged in Keizan's Denkoroku, but "[i]n the standard versions of Dogen's writings, however, all direct references to Yiqing's indirect succession have been eliminated".{{sfn|Bodiford|1991|p=428}}

====Criteria====
Manzan Dokahu (1636–1714), a Sōtō reformer,
{{quote|[P]ropagated the view that Dharma transmission was dependent on personal initiation between a Master and disciple rather than on the disciple's enlightenment. He maintained this view in the face of strong opposition, citing as authority the towering figure of Japanese Zen, Dogen [...] This became and continues to this day to be the official Sōtō Zen view. {{sfn|Lachs|1999}}}}

According to Manzan, even an unenlightened student could receive dharma transmission:
{{quote|Manzan argued that as long as master and disciple fulfill the condition of a personal relationship, then Dharma transmission 'with either an enlightened or an unenlightened disciple are both equivalent in [maintaining] the true tradition'.{{sfn|Bodiford|1991|p=444}}}}

In Sōtō-zen, since Manzan Dokahu, two criteria are applied for dharma transmission:
# ''Isshi inshō'' – "Exclusive authentication from no more than one teacher".{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=270}} This criterion "prohibits clerics inheriting more than one lineage"{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=270}}
# ''Menju shihō'' – "Face-to-face bestowal of succession".{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=270}} This criterion "prohibits conferral by proxy, conferral at a distance to strangers, or posthumous conferral".{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=270}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The origins of Sōtō-zen, or Dogen-shu, are in contradiction to this criterium. Gikai, the third abbot of Ehei-ji, was also lineage-holder of [[Nōnin]]. According to the ''Denkoroku'', Dogen himself had also received dharma transmission from Myōzen.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005}}{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|pp=270-271}}{{sfn|Faure|2000}}}}

====Status====
In contrast to the status that dharma transmission has begotten in the west, in Sōtō it has a relatively low status:
{{quote|[D]harma transmission provides access to only a relatively low grade. It is listed as a requirement for the very lowest ecclesiastical status, that of an instructor third class (''[[Zen ranks and hierarchy|santō kyōshi]]''). Thus, in present day Sōtō Zen, dharma transmission constitutes a preliminary step, after which one's real development begins [...] Today, the key authority conferred by dharma transmission is that it qualifies a priest to manage an ordinary (''jun hōchi'') local temple. These temples are not ascetic training but of ceremonial services on behalf of lay patrons.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=276}}}}

To supervise the training of monks, further qualifications are necessary:
{{quote|The relatively low status of dharma transmission means that in and of itself it does not qualify one to accept students or to train disciples. According to the regulations, Zen students should be supervised only by a teacher who has attained supervisory certification (i.e. ''sanzen dōjō shike'' status), that is, someone who in the popular literature might be called a [[Zen master]]. To attain supervisory certification requires not just high ecclesiastical grades and dharma seniority but also at least three years' experience as an assistant supervisor at a specially designated training hall (''tokubetsu sōdō''), during which time one undergoes an apprenticeship.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=276}}}}

The duties which come with this full qualification were not always appreciated. In the medieval organisation of the Sōtō-shu, when rotation of abbotship was the norm. Dharma transmission at a branch temple obliged one to serve at least one term as abbot at the main temple. Abbotship gave severe duties, and financial burdens, for which reason many tried to avoid the responsibility of abbotship:{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=273}}
{{quote|Tsūgen, Baisan and Jochū each demanded that future generations excommunicate any Zen teacher who failed to fulfill his obligation to serve as abbot of a head temple. Baisan decreed that the obedient Zen successors should seize defiant ones and then burn the offender's succession's certificate (''shisho'') before his eyes. Note the remarkable inversion that has occurred here. Instead of dharma transmission being a qualification for becoming an abbot, successful service as abbot has become a requirement for being allowed to retain one's dharma transmission.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=273}}}}

====Spiritual realization====
The Sōtō-shu also confers inka shōmyō (or ''inshō'') "[granting] the seal of approval to a realization of enlightenment",{{sfn|Bodiford|1991|p=423}} upon students. This is an 
{{quote|... idealized religious aspect of the Dharma transmission process. Zen master and disciple may evoke this mystical paradigm through ritual ceremony in the master's room (''shi-tsunai''), but other, more mundane institutional concerns can govern the actual selection and promotion of Dharma 'heirs'.{{sfn|Bodiford|1991|p=423}}}}

Dharma transmission is part of the maintenance of the Sōtō-institutions. Authority and temple-property are handed down, often from father to son.{{sfn|Tetsuo|2003}} It is not a guarantee for spiritual attainment:
{{quote|dharma transmission is no guarantee for anything. It only shows that the person who gave the transmission – and only that one person – was convinced that the student was qualified as a teacher. Could he have been wrong? Yes, he could have been wrong. Therefore, if you want to make sure that a teacher is actually a good teacher, you should not only ask if he or she has dharma transmission or not. The question is: Where does this dharma transmission come from? What lineage does it represent? And even more important: What practice did accompany it? What kind of student was the teacher before he or she became a teacher? What is his or her practice now?&lt;ref name =Antaiji2 group=web&gt;[http://antaiji.dogen-zen.de/eng/201005.shtml Muho Noelke, ''Part 2: Ten points to keep in mind about dharma transmission'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Shiho====
[Please note that this section provides only one reference from a single individual. Help Wikipedia by including more sources.]

Dharma transmission is also called ''shiho''.{{sfn|Seager|1999|p=107}} In the [[Sōtō]] school a student receives Dharma transmission during a ''denbō'' ceremony, which is the last ceremony of their [[shiho]] ceremony: 
{{quote|The usual practice...is for a Sōtō monk to be given Dharma transmission by the priest who ordained him (in most cases his own father), after he returns from his minimum period of monastery training. Because Dharma transmission is a prerequisite to becoming the head priest of a Sōtō branch temple, virtually all Sōtō priests meet this ritual requirement at a relatively early stage in their careers."&lt;ref name="kraft"&gt;Kraft, 20; 173&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Shiho is...
{{quote|...the recognition of the transmission that took place long before the ceremony itself. In fact, it has nothing to do at all with the paper, with philosophy or with mystical experience. The 24 hours of the daily life shared by teacher and student are the content of the transmission, and nothing else [...] In Antaiji, when you receive shiho after, say, eight or nine years, you will have sat for 15.000 hours of zazen with your teacher. Not only that, you also shared many thousands of meals with him, worked together in the fields for thousands of hours, spread manure, cut grass and wood together, side by side, you sweat together in the summer and froze together in the winter. You cooked for him and filled the bath tub for him, you know how he likes the temperature both of his soup and the bathing water. You also shared many drinks, probably. In each of these activities, the dharma is transmitted. None should be left out.&lt;ref name=Antaiji2 group=web/&gt;}}

Shiho is done "one-to-one in the abbot's quarters (hojo)".&lt;ref name=Antaiji2 group=web /&gt; Three handwritten documents certify the dharma transmission;
{{quote|a) Shisho (the scripture of transmission, the names of the ancestors arranged in a circle – the dharma has passed on from to Shakyamuni to yourself, and now you give it back to Shakyamuni. There is a small piece of papaer, probably originally written by Sawaki Roshi, with some comments. This paper is also copied by the student when doing dharma transmission at Antaiji.)
b) Daiji (the great matter, a cryptic symbolization of the content of the teaching. Again, there is a small extra sheet of paper that explains about the meaning of the symbols.)
c) Kechimyaku (the blood lineage, looks quite similar to the blood line transmission that you already wrote at the time of ordination) 
d) Actually, in the lineage of Sawaki Roshi (and maybe other lineages as well) a student is told to write a fourth document on an extra sheet of paper, which is called Hisho (the secret document, which is encoded, but the code for decyphering is on the same paper, so once you hold it in your hands it is not so "secret" anymore.)&lt;ref name=Antaiji2 group=web /&gt;}}

The procedure has to take place only once in one's life, and binds the student to the teacher forever:
{{quote|Dharma transmission can happen once, and only once, or never at all. Multiple dharma transmission is nonsense. If you receive dharma transmission from one teacher, from then on that is your one and only teacher, your real teacher (jap. hon-shi). The multiple lineage holders that you hear of in the West are bullshit. Therefore it is important that both sides, but especially the student, make sure that this is the right time for them to make this important step.&lt;ref name =Antaiji2 group=web /&gt;}}

If a students does not have the feeling he wants to be tied to this teacher for the rest of his life, he may refuse to take dharma transmission from this particular teacher.&lt;ref name=Antaiji2 group=web /&gt; Since the time of Manzan Dokahu (1636–1714), multiple dharma transmissions are impossible in Sōtō Zen.&lt;ref name=Antaiji2 group=web /&gt;{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005}}

====Further study====
According to [[Muho Noelke]], dharma transmission marks the beginning of the real learning:
{{quote|Dharma transmission is not the last and final step in a student's practice. Quite the opposite, one might call it the real first step on the way of practice. The way has just begun, but now the student has decided which exact way he wants to follow to the end. But all the real hardships still lay ahead of him. To use the example of boy-meets-girl again: At this point of time they have decided that they are made for each other, so to speak, they want to get married and have kids. Hopefully, that does not mean that the romance is over. It just means that both are prepared for the real struggle to begin.&lt;ref name =Antaiji2 group=web /&gt;{{refn|group=lower-alpha|This is reflected by the [[Five Ranks|Five ranks of enlightenment]]. The same notion can be found within the Rinzai-tradition. See [[Linji Yixuan#Expressing the inexpressible|Three mysterious Gates]], and the [[Hakuin#Four ways of knowing|Four Ways of Knowing]]}}}}

After Dharma transmission one has become a member of the "blood line" of Zen, but is not yet qualified as an [[Oshō]]. After the [[Zen ranks and hierarchy|ten-e]] and [[Zen ranks and hierarchy|zuise]] ceremonies, one is qualified as an oshō. There-after one has to practice for some time, at least six months, in an ''sôdô-ango'', an officially recognized Sōtō-shu training centre.&lt;ref name=Antaiji5 group=web&gt;[http://antaiji.dogen-zen.de/eng/adult50.shtml Muho Noelke, ''Part 5: Sessa-takuma - ango as life in a rock grinder'']&lt;/ref&gt;

After that one can start to work in a temple. The newly acquired status is confirmed in the ''kyoshi-honin'' ceremony. There-after follows the first practice-period in one's own temple, with the aid of a ''susho'' (head monk). This is followed by the ''Jushoku-himei'' ceremony, which confirms one's status as ''dai-oshō''.&lt;ref name=Antaiji5 group=web /&gt;

===Sanbo Kyodan===
The [[Sanbo Kyodan]] mixes Sōtō and Rinzai-elements.{{sfn|Sharf|1995a}} Students in this school follow the [[Kōan#Sanbo Kyodan|Harada-Yasutani koan curriculum]], in which great emphasis is placed on [[kensho]], the initial insight into one's true nature.{{sfn|Sharf|1995a|p=430-431}} Having attained kensho is publicly acknowledged in a ''jahai''-ceremony.{{sfn|Sharf|1995a|p=430}} After working through the Harada-Yasutani koan curriculum, which may take as short as five years,{{sfn|Sharf|1995a|p=432}} the student receives a calligraphy testifying that het or she "has finished the great matter".{{sfn|Sharf|1995a|p=432}} This is publicly acknowledged in the ''hasansai''-ceremony, giving the status of ''hasan''.{{sfn|Sharf|1995a|p=432}}

The Sanbo Kyodan has two levels of teaching authority, namely ''junshike'' ("associate zen master"), and ''shōshike'' ("authentic zen master").{{sfn|Sharf|1995a|p=432}} Junshikes can give dokusan, authorize kensho, and supervise part of the koan-study. Shoshikes can supervise the advanced koan-study, and perform religious ceremonies, such as the precept-ceremony and wedding ceremonies.{{sfn|Sharf|1995a|p=433}}

The process toward gaining these titles has seen some variations within the Sanbo Kyodan. ''Hasansai'' may be preparatory to the ''junshike''-title, but may also be the promotion to this title. And promotion to ''shoshike'' may be preparatory to dharma transmission, but may also be equivalent to it.{{sfn|Sharf|1995a|p=433}}

In dharma transmission, the student receives the ''sanmotsu'', akin to the Sōtō shiho ceremony.{{sfn|Sharf|1995a|p=433}} This is coupled with the Rinzai notion on ''inka''.{{sfn|Sharf|1995a|p=433}} In Rinzai, only students who have completed the complete Rinzai koan curriculum and "are eligible to serve as ''sōdō'' roshi,{{sfn|Sharf|1995a|p=433}} that is, master of a training hall, in distinction from a common temple, receive inka. In the Sanbo Kyodan, ''inka'' is derived from Harada's Rinzai master Dokutan Sōsan.{{sfn|Sharf|1995a|p=433}}

===White Plum Asanga===
[[File:Shiho ceremony.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Michel Genko Dubois (left) and [[Dennis Genpo Merzel]] performing "mind to mind" in Dubois's [[shiho]] ceremony.]]

In the [[White Plum Asanga]], Dharma transmission comes first, and qualifies one as a [[sensei]].{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=102}} This may be followed by inka, the final acknowledgemment:{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=102}}{{sfn|Seager|1999}}&lt;ref&gt;Aitken, 25-26&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|… once you have transmission then your teacher is sort of watching to see how you’re doing as a teacher – on how you are conducting yourself and, after a period of time, if the teacher has confidence in your understanding and ability to teach (that you are conducting yourself with integrity and clarity) then, at some point, the person will get the final seal of approval – which is what inka is. There is nothing particularly mysterious about it.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://sweepingzen.com/inka SweepingZen, ''Inka shomi'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Korean Soen===
In Korean Soen, Inka (In'ga) typically refers to the private acknowledgement of dharma transmission from a teacher to their student. "Transmission" is used to refer to the public ceremonial version of the same acknowledgement.

Both are considered equal in authority and "realization". A monk with either In'ga or the public "transmission" is qualified to hold the post of Soen Sa, or "Zen Master" for a temple, and give transmission to their own students (either, In'ga or public "transmission"). The majority of Zen Masters in Korea have only received, and only give In'ga, with the formal transmission ceremony being far more rare.&lt;ref&gt;Buswell&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Western [[Kwan Um School of Zen]] created by the Korean Zen Master [[Seung Sahn]], "Inka" is granted to an individual who has completed their koan training and is granted the title [[Ji Do Poep Sa Nim]]. Dharma transmission in the Kwan Um School of Zen comes after inka, denoting the individual is now a [[Soen Sa Nim]].&lt;ref name="ford"&gt;Ford, 93; 220&lt;/ref&gt; Seung Sahn himself is quoted saying in reference to the administration of his Western organization, 
{{quote|Inka and transmission are different. Our 'Ji Do Poep Sa Nim' title is like the Japanese title 'sensei.' In Korea, we call it 'Chong Yong Sun'—your practice is okay, teaching other people is possible. This title has almost disappeared in Korea, although it still exists in China. In Korea we now have the title 'Ip Sung Sunim.'—'head monk.'" This innovation applies only to Seung Sahn's Western organization, and is not normative for Korean Soen/Zen practice either historically, or currently.&lt;ref&gt;Seung Sahn&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Vietnamese Thien===
[[Thich Nhat Hanh]] has created a ritual known as "Lamp Transmission", making a teacher a Dharmacharya—an individual with "limited teaching authority."&lt;ref name="ford"/&gt; According to author [[James Ishmael Ford]], 
{{quote|Regarding the issue of Dharma transmission, Thich Nhat Hanh has said no single student will succeed him. Instead his community of practice will itself be his successor. He is quoted as saying [[Maitreya]], the Buddha of future birth, may be a community of practice rather than an individual. What this actually means will only become apparent over the next decades.&lt;ref name="ford"/&gt;}}

==Criticism==
In the western understanding, dharma transmission stands solely for recognition of authentic insight, whereas in the Japanese monastery system dharma transmission is a formal notification that someone is fully qualified to take a leading role in this system.{{sfn|Sharf|1995}}{{sfn|Lachs|2006}} In the USA and Europe dharma transmission is linked to the unofficial title [[Rōshi|roshi]], older teacher. In the Western understanding roshis are "part of a tradition that imputes to them quasi-divine qualities",{{sfn|Lachs|2006}} someone who "is defined by simplicity, innocence, and lack of self-interest or desire".{{sfn|Lachs|2006}} Nevertheless, the authorisation of teachers through dharma transmission does not mean that teachers are infallible,{{sfn|Ford}} as is clear from the repeated appearance of scandals:{{sfn|Lachs|2006}}
{{quote|In this complicated world of living Zen, we can meet teachers guiding communities of practice with compassion and grace. But we also find Zen teachers having inappropriate sexual relationships, abusing the power dynamics of their relationships and otherwise acting in ways contrary to the mythic status of their positions as teachers. In recent years there have been a number of books and essays exposing the ills of Zen institutions east and west as well as the foibles of individual Zen teachers. Here in the west there are few lineages that have passed unscathed by scandals, mostly of a sexual nature. And in the east, particularly in the Japanese institutions, we’ve learned how masters and whole schools were at various times co-opted by the state, most notoriously in the years leading up to and including the Second World War.{{sfn|Ford}}}}

According to Lachs,{{who|date=August 2017}} those scandals have also been possible because of the status given to roshis by dharma transmission, and "a desire for the master’s aura, recognition, and approval":{{sfn|Lachs|2006}}
{{quote|The students expect the real teacher to be an ideal teacher and look forward to having such an ideal teacher lead and instruct them. The student who enters the practice having read a myth will expect to find the myth and will think they have found the myth. Unfortunately, they have found the myth without recognizing it for what it is. What they really have found, all too often, is another story of ordinary, flawed human behavior.{{sfn|Lachs|2006}}}}

== Origin and effect ==
Downcycling can help to keep materials in use, reduce consumption of [[raw materials]], and avoid the energy usage, [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, [[air pollution]], and [[water pollution]] of primary production and resource extraction. 
[[File:Downcycling of steel, recovered from scrap cars but only deemed reusable in the construction sector.svg|thumb|Downcycling of steel from scrap cars into buildings. Vehicle steel scrap, which is contaminated with other metals, is often remelted into construction steel that can contain up to 0.4% of copper.&lt;ref name=Savov2003 /&gt;]]

The term ''downcycling'' was first used by Reiner Pilz in an interview by Thornton Kay in SalvoNEWS in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.salvoweb.com/files/sn99sm24y94tk181119.pdf Thornton Kay, Salvo in Germany - Reiner Pilz, p14 SalvoNEWS No99 11 October 1994]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; We talked about the impending EU Demolition Waste Streams directive. "Recycling, he said, "I call it downcycling. They smash bricks, they smash everything. What we need is [[upcycling]] where old products are given more value not less." He despairs of the German situation and recalls the supply of a large quantity of reclaimed woodblock from an English supplier for a contract in Nuremberg while just down the road a load of similar blocks was scrapped. It was a pinky looking aggregate with pieces of handmade brick, old tiles and discernible parts of useful old items mixed with crushed concrete. Is this the future for Europe?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term ''downcycling'' was also used by [[William McDonough]] and [[Michael Braungart]] in their 2002 book ''[[Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things]]''.
&lt;ref  name=CradletoCradle/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt; As we have noted, most recycling is actually ''downcycling''; it reduces the quality of a material over time. When plastics other than those found in soda and water bottles are recycled, they are mixed with different plastics to produce a hybrid of lower quality, which is then molded into something amorphous and cheap, such as a park bench or a speed bump... Aluminum is another valuable but constantly downcycled material. The typical soda can consists of two kinds of aluminum: the walls are composed of aluminum, manganese alloy with some magnesium, plus coatings and paint, while the harder top is aluminum magnesium alloy. In conventional recycling these materials are melted together, resulting in a weaker—and less useful—product.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Similar operations ==
Downcycling is related to but different from 'open-loop recycling'. While downcycling implies quality loss the term open-loop recycling denotes a situation where the secondary material is used in a different product system than the original material; it thus comprises both upcycling and downcycling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=38498 ISO 14044:2006] (ISO)&lt;/ref&gt; A detailed discussion on the relation between downcycling, open loop recycling and their [[environmental impact]] is provided by Geyer et al. (2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Geyer|first=R.|last2=Kuczenski|first2=B.| last3=Henderson|first3=A.|date=2016|title=Common Misconceptions about Recycling. |journal=Journal of Industrial Ecology|volume=20|issue=5|pages= 1010–1017|doi=10.1111/jiec.12355}}&lt;/ref&gt; They write that "Poor product design and EOL management can lead to recycled materials of poor quality, which, in turn, limits the applications these materials can be used in." They also argue that "closed-loop recycling neither intrinsically displaces more primary material owing to multiple loops (quantity argument) nor per se generates higher environmental benefits on a unit basis (quality argument)." The reason for their argument lies in the necessity to include the product system of the target application, in which the recycled material is used or not, into the assessment of overall primary material demand and environmental impact.

Sherrington]] in a passage from his 1942 book ''Man on his nature'', in which he poetically describes his conception of what happens in the cerebral cortex during arousal from sleep:{{Ref label|A|a|none}}

{{quote|The great topmost sheet of the mass, that where hardly a light had twinkled or moved, becomes now a sparkling field of rhythmic flashing points with trains of traveling sparks hurrying hither and thither. The brain is waking and with it the mind is returning. It is as if the Milky Way entered upon some cosmic dance. Swiftly the head mass becomes an enchanted loom where millions of flashing shuttles weave a dissolving pattern, always a meaningful pattern though never an abiding one; a shifting harmony of subpatterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sherrington |first=C.S. |title=Man on his nature |year=1942 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=178 |isbn=978-0-8385-7701-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The "loom" he refers to was undoubtedly meant to be a [[Jacquard loom]], used for weaving fabric into complex patterns. The Jacquard loom, invented in 1801, was the most complex mechanical device of the early 19th century. It was controlled by a [[punch card]] system that was a forerunner of the system used in computers until the 1970s. With as many as thousands of independently movable shuttles, a Jacquard loom in operation must have appeared very impressive. If Sherrington had written a decade later, however, he might perhaps have chosen the flashing lights on the front panel of a computer as his metaphor instead.

According to the neuroscience historian Stanley Finger,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Minds Behind the Brain |author=Finger, S. |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1999 |pages=1 |isbn=978-0-19-508571-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sherrington probably borrowed the loom metaphor from an earlier writer, the psychologist Fredric Myers, who asked his readers to "picture the human brain as a vast manufactory, in which thousands of looms, of complex and differing patterns, are habitually at work".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Multiplex personality |author=Myers, F.W.H. |journal=Proc Soc Psych Res |volume=4 |year=1887 |pages=496–514}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps in part because of its slightly cryptic nature, the "enchanted loom" has been an attractive metaphor for many writers about the brain, and has supplied the title for several books, including the following:

An '''entity–relationship model''' ('''ER model''' for short) describes interrelated things of interest in a specific domain of knowledge. A basic ER model is composed of entity types (which classify the things of interest) and specifies relationships that can exist between instances of those entity types.

[[Image:ER Diagram MMORPG.png|thumb|450px|An entity–relationship diagram for an [[MMORPG]] using Chen's notation.]]

In [[software engineering]], an ER model is commonly formed to represent things that a business needs to remember in order to perform business processes. Consequently, the ER model becomes an abstract [[data modeling|data model]], that defines a data or information structure which can be implemented in a [[database]], typically a [[relational database]].

Entity–relationship modeling was developed for database design by [[Peter Chen]] and published in a 1976 paper.&lt;ref name=Chen&gt;{{cite journal  |last=Chen  |first=Peter |authorlink = Peter Chen |title = The Entity-Relationship Model - Toward a Unified View of Data |journal = ACM Transactions on Database Systems| volume = 1 | issue = 1 |pages = 9–36 | date = March 1976 | doi = 10.1145/320434.320440}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, variants of the idea existed previously.&lt;ref&gt;A.P.G. Brown, "Modelling a Real-World System and Designing a Schema to Represent It", in Douque and Nijssen (eds.), ''Data Base Description'', North-Holland, 1975, {{ISBN|0-7204-2833-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some ER models show super and subtype entities connected by generalization-specialization relationships,&lt;ref&gt;[https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc505839.aspx “Designing a Logical Database: Supertypes and Subtypes”]&lt;/ref&gt; and an ER model can be used also in the specification of domain-specific [[ontology (computer science)|ontologies]].

== Introduction ==
An entity–relationship model is usually the result of systematic analysis to define and describe what is important to processes in an area of a business. It does not define the business processes; it only presents a business data schema in graphical form.  It is usually drawn in a graphical form as boxes (''entities'') that are connected by lines (''relationships'') which express the associations and dependencies between entities. An ER model can also be expressed in a verbal form, for example: ''one building may be divided into zero or more apartments, but one apartment can only be located in one building.''

Entities may be characterized not only by relationships, but also by additional properties (''attributes''), which include identifiers called "primary keys". Diagrams created to represent attributes as well as entities and relationships may be called entity-attribute-relationship diagrams, rather than entity–relationship models. 

An ER model is typically implemented as a [[database]]. In a simple relational database implementation, each row of a table represents one instance of an entity type, and each field in a table represents an attribute type. In a [[relational database]] a relationship between entities is implemented by storing the primary key of one entity as a pointer or "foreign key" in the table of another entity

There is a tradition for ER/data models to be built at two or three levels of abstraction. Note that the conceptual-logical-physical hierarchy below is used in other kinds of specification, and is different from the [[three schema approach]] to [[software engineering]].
;[[Conceptual data model]]
:This is the highest level ER model in that it contains the least granular detail but establishes the overall scope of what is to be included within the model set. The conceptual ER model normally defines master reference data entities that are commonly used by the organization.  Developing an enterprise-wide conceptual ER model is useful to support documenting the [[data architecture]] for an organization.
:A conceptual ER model may be used as the foundation for one or more ''logical data models'' (see below). The purpose of the conceptual ER model is then to establish structural [[metadata]] commonality for the [[master data]] entities between the set of logical ER models. The conceptual data model may be used to form commonality relationships between ER models as a basis for data model integration.
;[[Logical data model]]
:A logical ER model does not require a conceptual ER model, especially if the scope of the logical ER model includes only the development of a distinct information system. The logical ER model contains more detail than the conceptual ER model. In addition to master data entities, operational and transactional data entities are now defined. The details of each data entity are developed and the relationships between these data entities are established. The logical ER model is however developed independently of the specific [[database management system]] into which it can be implemented. 
;[[Physical data model]]
:One or more physical ER models may be developed from each logical ER model. The physical ER model is normally developed to be instantiated as a database. Therefore, each physical ER model must contain enough detail to produce a database and each physical ER model is technology dependent since each database management system is somewhat different.
:The physical model is normally instantiated in the structural metadata of a database management system as relational database objects such as [[database table]]s, [[database index]]es such as [[unique key]] indexes, and database constraints such as a [[foreign key constraint]] or a commonality constraint.  The ER model is also normally used to design modifications to the relational database objects and to maintain the structural metadata of the database.

The first stage of [[information system]] design uses these models during the [[requirements analysis]] to describe information needs or the type of [[information]] that is to be stored in a [[database]]. The [[data modeling]] technique can be used to describe any [[ontology (computer science)|ontology]] (i.e. an overview and classifications of used terms and their relationships) for a certain [[universe of discourse|area of interest]]. In the case of the design of an information system that is based on a database, the [[conceptual data model]] is, at a later stage (usually called logical design), mapped to a [[logical data model]], such as the [[relational model]]; this in turn is mapped to a physical model during physical design. Note that sometimes, both of these phases are referred to as "physical design."

== Entity–relationship modeling ==
[[Image:Erd-entity-relationship-example1.svg|frame|Two related entities]]
[[Image:Erd-entity-with-attribute.svg|frame|An entity with an attribute]]
[[Image:erd-relationship-with-attribute.png|width=100|frame|A relationship with an attribute]]
[[Image:Erd-id-as-primary-key.png|frame|[[Primary key]]]]
An [[entity]] may be defined as a thing capable of an independent existence that can be uniquely identified. An entity is an abstraction from the complexities of a domain. When we speak of an entity, we normally speak of some aspect of the real world that can be distinguished from other aspects of the real world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beynon-Davies |first=Paul |date=2004 |title=Database Systems |location=Basingstoke, UK: Palgrave |publisher=Houndmills |page= |isbn=1403916012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An entity is a thing that exists either physically or logically. An entity may be a physical object such as a house or a car (they exist physically), an event such as a house sale or a car service, or a concept such as a customer transaction or order (they exist logically—as a concept). Although the term entity is the one most commonly used, following Chen we should really distinguish between an entity and an entity-type. An entity-type is a category. An entity, strictly speaking, is an instance of a given entity-type. There are usually many instances of an entity-type. Because the term entity-type is somewhat cumbersome, most people tend to use the term entity as a synonym for this term

Entities can be thought of as [[noun]]s. Examples: a computer, an employee, a song, a mathematical theorem, etc.

A relationship captures how entities are related to one another. Relationships can be thought of as [[verb]]s, linking two or more nouns.  Examples: an ''owns'' relationship between a company and a computer, a ''supervises'' relationship between an employee and a department, a ''performs'' relationship between an artist and a song, a ''proves'' relationship between a mathematician and a conjecture, etc.

The model's linguistic aspect described above is utilized in the [[declarative programming language|declarative]] database [[query language]] ERROL, which mimics [[natural language]] constructs. ERROL's [[semantics]] and implementation are based on reshaped relational algebra (RRA), a relational algebra that is adapted to the entity–relationship model and captures its linguistic aspect.

Entities and relationships can both have attributes. Examples: an ''employee'' entity might have a ''Social Security Number'' (SSN) attribute, while a ''proved'' relationship may have a ''date'' attribute.

Every entity (unless it is a [[weak entity]]) must have a minimal set of uniquely identifying attributes, which is called the entity's [[Unique key|primary key]].

Entity–relationship diagrams don't show single entities or single instances of relations. Rather, they show entity sets (all entities of the same entity type) and relationship sets (all relationships of the same relationship type). Examples: a particular ''song'' is an entity; the collection of all songs in a database is an entity set; the ''eaten'' relationship between a child and her lunch is a single relationship; the set of all such child-lunch relationships in a database is a relationship set.
In other words, a relationship set corresponds to a [[relation (mathematics)|relation in mathematics]], while a relationship corresponds to a member of the relation.

Certain [[cardinality (data modeling)|cardinality constraint]]s on relationship sets may be indicated as well.

=== Mapping natural language ===
Chen proposed the following "rules of thumb" for mapping natural language descriptions into ER diagrams: [http://bit.csc.lsu.edu/~chen/pdf/ER_C.pdf "English, Chinese and ER diagrams"] by Peter Chen.

{|class="wikitable"
|-
! English grammar structure !! ER structure
|-
| [[Common noun]] || Entity type
|-
| [[Proper noun]] || Entity
|-
| [[Transitive verb]] || Relationship type
|-
| [[Intransitive verb]] || Attribute type
|-
| [[Adjective]] || Attribute for entity 
|-
| [[Adverb]] || Attribute for relationship
|}

Physical view show how data is actually stored.

===Relationships, roles and cardinalities===
In Chen's original paper he gives an example of a relationship and its roles. He describes a relationship "marriage" and its two roles "husband" and "wife".

A person plays the role of husband in a marriage (relationship) and another person plays the role of wife in the (same) marriage. These words are nouns. That is no surprise; naming things requires a noun.

Chen's terminology has also been applied to earlier ideas. The lines, arrows and crow's-feet of some diagrams owes more to the earlier [[Data structure diagram|Bachman diagrams]] than to Chen's relationship diagrams.

Another common extension to Chen's model is to "name" relationships and roles as verbs or phrases.

===Role naming===
It has also become prevalent to name roles with phrases such as ''is the owner of'' and ''is owned by''. Correct nouns in this case are ''owner'' and ''possession''. Thus ''person plays the role of owner'' and ''car plays the role of possession'' rather than ''person plays the role of'', ''is the owner of'', etc.

The use of nouns has direct benefit when generating physical implementations from semantic models. When a ''person'' has two relationships with ''car'' then it is possible to generate names such as ''owner_person'' and ''driver_person'', which are immediately meaningful.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pangrammaticon.blogspot.de/2013/01/emotion-and-society.html Thomas Basboell: Motion and society. On meaningfulness of concepts]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cardinalities===
Modifications to the original specification can be beneficial. Chen described [[look-across cardinality|look-across cardinalities]]. As an aside, the [[Barker's notation|Barker–Ellis]] notation, used in Oracle Designer, uses same-side for minimum cardinality (analogous to optionality) and role, but look-across for maximum cardinality (the crows foot).{{clarify|This whole section is almost incomprehensible!  Please define 'cardinalities', 'look-across', etc.|date=April 2012}}

In [[Merise]],&lt;ref&gt;Hubert Tardieu, Arnold Rochfeld and René Colletti La methode MERISE: Principes et outils (Paperback - 1983)&lt;/ref&gt; Elmasri &amp; Navathe&lt;ref&gt;Elmasri, Ramez, B. Shamkant, Navathe, Fundamentals of Database Systems, third ed., Addison-Wesley, Menlo Park, CA, USA, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; and others&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=odZK99osY1EC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;img=1&amp;pgis=1&amp;dq=genova&amp;sig=ACfU3U3tDC_q8WOMqUJW4EZCa5YQywoYLw&amp;edge=0 ER 2004 : 23rd International Conference on Conceptual Modeling, Shanghai, China, November 8-12, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; there is a preference for same-side for roles and both minimum and maximum cardinalities. Recent researchers (Feinerer,&lt;ref&gt;[http://publik.tuwien.ac.at/files/pub-inf_4582.pdf A Formal Treatment of UML Class Diagrams as an Efficient Method for Configuration Management 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Dullea et al.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ischool.drexel.edu/faculty/song/publications/p_DKE_03_Validity.pdf James Dullea, Il-Yeol Song, Ioanna Lamprou - An analysis of structural validity in entity-relationship modeling 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;) have shown that this is more coherent when applied to n-ary relationships of order greater than&amp;nbsp;2.

In Dullea et al. one reads "A 'look across' notation such as used in the UML does not effectively represent the semantics of participation constraints imposed on relationships where the degree is higher than binary."

In Feinerer it says "Problems arise if we operate under the look-across semantics as used for UML associations. Hartmann&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann, Sven. "[http://crpit.com/confpapers/CRPITV17Hartmann.pdf Reasoning about participation constraints and Chen's constraints]". Proceedings of the 14th Australasian database conference-Volume 17. Australian Computer Society, Inc., 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; investigates this situation and shows how and why different transformations fail." ''(Although the "reduction" mentioned is spurious as the two diagrams 3.4 and 3.5 are in fact the same)'' and also "As we will see on the next few pages, the look-across interpretation introduces several difficulties that prevent the extension of simple mechanisms from binary to n-ary associations."

[[Image:ERD Representation.svg|thumb|320px|Various methods of representing the same one to many relationship. In each case, the diagram shows the relationship between a person and a place of birth: each person must have been born at one, and only one, location, but each location may have had zero or more people born at it.]]
[[Image:ERD-artist-performs-song.svg|thumb|320px|Two related entities shown using Crow's Foot notation. In this example, an optional relationship is shown between Artist and Song; the symbols closest to the song entity represents "zero, one, or many", whereas a song has "one and only one" Artist. The former is therefore read as, an Artist (can) perform(s) "zero, one, or many" song(s).]] Chen's notation for entity–relationship modeling uses rectangles to represent entity sets, and diamonds to represent relationships appropriate for [[first-class object]]s: they can have attributes and relationships of their own. If an entity set participates in a relationship set, they are connected with a line.

Attributes are drawn as ovals and are connected with a line to exactly one entity or relationship set.

Cardinality constraints are expressed as follows:
* a double line indicates a ''participation constraint'',  [[total relation|totality]] or [[surjective function|surjectivity]]: all entities in the entity set must participate in ''at least one'' relationship in the relationship set;
* an arrow from entity set to relationship set indicates a [[unique key|key constraint]], i.e. [[injective relation|injectivity]]: each entity of the entity set can participate in ''at most one'' relationship in the relationship set;
* a thick line indicates both, i.e. [[bijection|bijectivity]]: each entity in the entity set is involved in ''exactly one'' relationship.
* an underlined name of an attribute indicates that it is a [[unique key|key]]: two different entities or relationships with this attribute always have different values for this attribute.

Attributes are often omitted as they can clutter up a diagram; other diagram techniques often list entity attributes within the rectangles drawn for entity sets.

===Crow's foot notation===
Crow's foot notation, the beginning of which dates back to an article by Gordon Everest (1976),&lt;ref&gt;G. Everest, "BASIC DATA STRUCTURE MODELS EXPLAINED WITH A COMMON EXAMPLE", in Computing Systems 1976, Proceedings Fifth Texas Conference on Computing Systems, Austin,TX, 1976 October 18-19, pages 39-46. (Long Beach, CA: IEEE Computer Society Publications Office).&lt;/ref&gt; is used in [[Barker's notation]], [[Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method]] (SSADM) and [[information technology engineering]]. Crow's foot diagrams represent entities as boxes, and relationships as lines between the boxes. Different shapes at the ends of these lines represent the relative cardinality of the relationship.

Crow's foot notation was used in the consultancy practice [[CACI]]. Many of the consultants at CACI (including Richard Barker) subsequently moved to [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] UK, where they developed the early versions of Oracle's [[computer-aided software engineering|CASE]] tools, introducing the notation to a wider audience.

With this notation, relationships cannot have attributes. Where necessary, relationships are promoted to entities in their own right: for example, if it is necessary to capture where and when an artist performed a song, a new entity "performance" is introduced (with attributes reflecting the time and place), and the relationship of an artist to a song becomes an indirect relationship via the performance (artist-performs-performance, performance-features-song). 
&lt;!-- 
Three symbols are used to represent cardinality:
* the ''ring'' represents "zero"
* the ''dash'' represents "one"
* the ''crow's foot'' represents "more" or "many"

These symbols are used in pairs to represent the four types of cardinality that an entity may have in a relationship.
* ''ring'' and ''dash'' → '''zero or one'''
* ''dash'' and ''dash'' → '''exactly one'''
* ''ring'' and ''crow's foot'' → '''zero or more'''
* ''dash'' and ''crow's foot'' → '''one or more'''

These are notations of a side in the ER diagrams.

You can see an example of the Crow's Foot notation in the diagram above.
In the diagram, the following facts are detailed:
* An Artist can perform '''zero or more''' Songs
* A Song is performed by '''exactly one''' Artist

=== Model usability issues ===

{{expand section|fan trap causes|date=February 2018}}
In using a modeled database, users can encounter two well known issues where the returned results mean something other than the results assumed by the query author.

The first is the 'fan trap'. It occurs with a (master) table that links to multiple tables in a one-to-many relationship. The issue derives its name from the way the model looks when it's drawn in an entity–relationship diagram: the linked tables 'fan out' from the master table. This type of model looks similar to a [[star schema]], a type of model used in [[data warehouse]]s. When trying to calculate sums over aggregates using standard SQL over the master table, unexpected (and incorrect) results&lt;!-- insert fan trap causes here--&gt;. The solution is to either adjust the model or the SQL. This issue occurs mostly in databases for decision support systems, and software that queries such systems sometimes includes specific methods for handling this issue.

The second issue is a 'chasm trap'. A chasm trap occurs when a model suggests the existence of a relationship between entity types, but the pathway does not exist between certain entity occurrences. For example, a Building has one-or-more Rooms, that hold zero-or-more Computers. One would expect to be able to query the model to see all the Computers in the Building. However, Computers not currently assigned to a Room (because they are under repair or somewhere else) are not shown on the list. Another relation between Building and Computers is needed to capture all the computers in the building. This last modelling issue is the result of a failure to capture all the relationships that exist in the real world in the model. See [http://db.grussell.org/section005.html Entity-Relationship Modelling 2] for details.

== Entity–relationships and semantic modeling ==

=== Semantic model ===
A semantic model is a model of concepts, it is sometimes called a "platform independent model". It is an intensional model. At the latest since [[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap]], it is well known that:&lt;ref&gt;http://wenku.baidu.com/view/8048e7bb1a37f111f1855b22.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
:''"...the full meaning of a concept is constituted by two aspects, its intension and its extension. The first part comprises the embedding of a concept in the world of concepts as a whole, i.e. the totality of all relations to other concepts. The second part establishes the referential meaning of the concept, i.e. its counterpart in the real or in a possible world".''

=== Extension model ===
An extensional model is one that maps to the elements of a particular methodology or technology, and is thus a "platform specific model". The UML specification explicitly states that associations in class models are extensional and this is in fact self-evident by considering the extensive array of additional "adornments" provided by the specification over and above those provided by any of the prior candidate "semantic modelling languages".[http://www.tdan.com/view-articles/8589 "UML as a Data Modeling Notation, Part 2"]

=== Entity–relationship origins ===
Peter Chen, the father of ER modeling said in his seminal paper:
: "''The entity-relationship model adopts the more natural view that the real world consists of entities and relationships. It incorporates some of the important semantic information about the real world.''" &lt;ref name=Chen /&gt;

In his original 1976 article Chen explicitly contrasts entity–relationship diagrams with record modelling techniques:
:"''The [[Bachman diagram|data structure diagram]] is a representation of the organization of records and is not an exact representation of entities and relationships.''"

Several other authors also support Chen's program:&lt;ref&gt;Kent in [http://www.bkent.net/Doc/darxrp.htm "Data and Reality"] : 
: "One thing we ought to have clear in our minds at the outset of a modelling endeavour is whether we are intent on describing a portion of "reality" (some human enterprise) or a data processing activity."&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-Raymond Abrial|Abrial]] in "Data Semantics" : "... the so called "logical" definition and manipulation of data are still influenced (sometimes unconsciously) by the "physical" storage and retrieval mechanisms currently available on computer systems."&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Stamper: "They pretend to describe entity types, but the vocabulary is from data processing: fields, data items, values. Naming rules don't reflect the conventions we use for naming people and things; they reflect instead techniques for locating records in files."&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;In [[Jackson Structured Programming|Jackson's]] words: "The developer begins by creating a model of the reality with which the system is concerned, the reality that furnishes its [the system's] subject matter ..."&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Elmasri, Navathe: "The ER model concepts are designed to be closer to the user’s perception of data and are not meant to describe the way in which data will be stored in the computer."&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Philosophical alignment ====
Chen is in accord with philosophic and theoretical traditions from the time of the Ancient Greek philosophers: Socrates, Plato and Aristotle (428 BC) through to modern [[epistemology]], [[semiotics]] and [[First-order logic|logic]] of [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]], [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]] and [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]].

[[Plato]] himself associates knowledge with the apprehension of unchanging Forms (The forms, according to Socrates, are roughly speaking archetypes or abstract representations of the many types of things, and properties) and their relationships to one another.

== Limitations ==
* ER assume information content that can readily be represented in a relational database. They describe only a relational structure for this information.
* They are inadequate for systems in which the information cannot readily be represented in relational form{{citationneeded|date=July 2016}}, such as with [[semi-structured data]].
* For many systems, possible changes to information contained are nontrivial and important enough to warrant explicit specification.
* Some{{Who|date=June 2012}} authors have extended ER modeling with constructs to represent change, an approach supported by the original author;&lt;ref&gt;P. Chen. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/5160x2634402663r/ Suggested research directions for a new frontier: Active conceptual modeling]. ER 2006, volume 4215 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pages 1–4. Springer Berlin / Heidelberg, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; an example is [[Anchor Modeling]]. An alternative is to model change separately, using a [[process modeling]] technique. Additional techniques can be used for other aspects of systems. For instance, ER models roughly correspond to just 1 of the 14 different modeling techniques offered by [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]].
* Even where it is suitable in principle, ER modeling is rarely used as a separate activity. One reason for this is today's abundance of tools to support diagramming and other design support directly on relational [[database management system]]s. These tools can readily extract database diagrams that are very close to ER diagrams from existing databases, and they provide alternative views on the information contained in such diagrams.
* In a survey, Brodie and Liu&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.deri.ie/content/power-and-limits-relational-technology-age-information-ecosystems The power and limits of relational technology in the age of information ecosystems]. On The Move Federated Conferences, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; could not find a single instance of entity–relationship modeling inside a sample of ten Fortune 100 companies.  Badia and Lemire&lt;ref&gt;A. Badia and D. Lemire. [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.297.4916&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf A call to arms: revisiting database design]. Citeseerx, &lt;/ref&gt; blame this lack of use on the lack of guidance but also on the lack of benefits, such as lack of support for data integration.
* The [[enhanced entity–relationship model]] (EER modeling) introduces several concepts not in ER modeling, but are closely related to [[object-oriented]] design, like [[is-a]] relationships.
* For modelling [[temporal database]]s, numerous ER extensions have been considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gregersen | first1 = Heidi | first2 = Christian S. | last2 = Jensen | title = Temporal Entity-Relationship models—a survey | citeseerx = 10.1.1.1.2497 | journal = IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering| volume = 11 | issue = 3 | date = 1999 | pages = 464–497 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the ER model was found unsuitable for [[multidimensional database]]s (used in [[OLAP]] applications); no dominant conceptual model has emerged in this field yet, although they generally revolve around the concept of [[OLAP cube]] (also known as ''data cube'' within the field).&lt;ref name="Rafanelli2003"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Maurizio Rafanelli|title=Multidimensional Databases: Problems and Solutions|year=2003|publisher=Idea Group Inc (IGI)|isbn=978-1-59140-053-0|url=http://torlone.dia.uniroma3.it/pubs/idea03.pdf|chapter=Conceptual Multidimensional Models|author=RICCARDO TORLONE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hochschild's 1983 book, "The Managed Heart: Commercialization of Human Feeling," discusses feeling rules in greater depth, especially in the occupational worlds of flight attendants and bill collectors. Hochschild draws on the work of sociologist [[Erving Goffman]] as well as labor scholar [[Harry Braverman]] to discuss the dramaturgical demands and emotional labor entailed by jobs in the service sector, in which workers must "perform" certain roles that entail abiding by certain feeling rules (e.g. "friendly and dependable"). She notes that women are more likely to have such jobs than men, and that analysis of feeling rules may therefore be especially relevant to understanding the gendered dimensions of labor. This work foreshadows themes from her later analyses of women's work, both paid and unpaid, e.g. in "The Commercialization of Intimate Life" (2003).

This work is part of the broader [[sociology of emotions]], which notes that [[socialization]] plays an important role in how people experience, interpret, and express emotions, including the situations that evoke a range of feelings. All human beings learn certain feeling rules, but these feeling rules may differ widely depending on the society in which one grows up and one's social position and [[Identity (social science)|social identity]], including gender and ethnic identity and socio-economic status. Feeling rules are flexible and the ways in which they impinge on one's experience in different settings influences one's personality, both in specific contexts (e.g. at work, home, school, or in different social groups) and over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Russell Hochschild | first = Arlie | author-link = Arlie Russell Hochschild | contribution = Section IX Transitions and challenges: symbolic interactionism: Airlie Russell Hochschild (1940- ) | editor-last1 = Adams | editor-first1 = Bert | editor-last2 = Sydie | editor-first2 = R.A. | title = Sociological theory | pages = 517–523 | publisher = Pine Forge Press | location = Thousand Oaks, California | year = 2001 | isbn = 9780761985570 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://leroy.cc.uregina.ca/~gingrich/n1302.htm Available from the University of Regina.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects  ==

===Race and the workplace===

[[Race (human categorization)|Race]] not only plays an important role in the way that employees act with each other, but also how employees act toward customers based on what race they are associated with. People expect others to behave in a certain manner due to what race they identify or associate with. Race influences and changes the way we see and view others.

Roxana Harlow, a sociologist, conducted extensive research on black colleges and professors. Harlow's research showed that white college students viewed their professors as "unintelligent" and "inferior" simply because of the color of their skin and not the measurement of their knowledge. In a classroom setting, white students were shown to give black professors a hard time and question every statement that their professor made. Whereas, if they were in a classroom with a white professor that had made the same statement that a black professor had made previously, the white professor was not questioned and was viewed as knowledgeable. In spite of this baseless challenge to their authority, the black professor maintained their composure and adhered to the feeling rules demanded by the setting.

In a workplace, feeling rules are established and are expected to be followed, but there is a double standard on the feeling rules applied to the white workers versus black workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wingfield|first=Adia Harvey|date=2010-05-01|title=Are Some Emotions Marked "Whites Only"? Racialized Feeling Rules in Professional Workplaces|url=http://socpro.oxfordjournals.org/content/57/2/251|journal=Social Problems|language=en|volume=57|issue=2|pages=251–268|doi=10.1525/sp.2010.57.2.251|issn=0037-7791}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Status===

Due to feeling rules, people of lower status or standing are expected to behave in an ashamed or emotional manner versus a cold or angry manner. By showing that they are ashamed of their current standing, the people of higher status are more likely to help them out and have pity on them versus those who do not show shame or pity for their current state. People respond better to seeing people on the streets asking for money or rambling through trash to find items. People of higher standings respond back by giving that individual of lower status clothes, food, and money. Our generosity is dependent on the manner of the poor individual. A poor individual who acted in an indifferent or prissy manner would not receive any response from the financially stable individual, not because his or her current situation had changed, in fact that person is still the poor individual you saw a few minutes ago, but in fact your demeanor had changed due to feeling rules.

Feeling rules gives people the expectancy that individuals of lower status should act in a pitiful and ashamed manner just because of their standing. Feeling rules affect our status because it dictates how one should act just because of their economic/ financial standing.

An experiment was conducted to show how people would react if they saw an ad with a person who was angry about being poor and another person who was shameful about being in poverty. After viewing the ad, people were more willingly to give money to the person who ashamed about being poor versus the person who was angry about being poor. Since the individual who was angry about being in poverty broke the feeling rule of what is expected our people of lower class, little to none donations were received in their favor. People of lower status that displayed no sense of self-pity or dissatisfaction gave people of higher status a harder time to sympathize with them thus proving that expressing shame was more effective and when anger was expressed there was little to no help being provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1177/0959353510384125 |title=Poor women and the expression of shame and anger: The price of breaking social class feeling rules |journal=Feminism &amp; Psychology |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=179 |year=2010 |last1=Power |first1=C. A. |last2=Cole |first2=E. R. |last3=Fredrickson |first3=B. L. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender ===
Around the world, males get paid more than females. Feeling rules require men and women to act a certain way, and in fear of breaking that norm, these rules stay in place. Women are associated with being sweet and innocent, whereas men are associated with being tough and strong. People are assigned jobs based on their gender. Since women are usually seen as beings that can control their anger, they are most likely enlisted in jobs that require them to use their looks or charms. Men, who are seen as tough, are usually in jobs that require them to use that toughness or anger in order to deliver some type of means.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://caringlabor.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/the-managed-heart-arlie-russell-hochschild.pdf|title=The Managed Heart: Commercialization of Human Feeling|last=Hochschild|first=Arlie Russell|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women in traditional and middle-class families rely on men to make or give them money. In response to the men providing, the women in a sense feel as if they have to repay the men back by hugging, kissing or celebrating the man. Since the women do not have the financial capability of repaying the man, the women use emotional means in order to thank or repay the man for what he has provided for them. If the man had provided the money for the woman and she in return did not act by hugging or kissing him, she would be seen an ungrateful because the feeling rules calls for her to feel joy or happiness for what the man has done for her.

Children learn their habits and emotional skills from their parents. Men are seen as beings that are not capable of controlling their feelings or emotions because they were not taught or required to as a child. Males obtain jobs such as bill collector, taxi driver, and construction worker because many of those jobs do not rely heavily on emotional labor. Hochschild showed that male flight attendants showed more power and tolerated less abuse from passengers than female flight attendants. Since people generally associate males with being tough and associate females with being sweet, feeling rules makes them feel appalled when a women behaves in a tough manner, but when a male behaves in the same way, it is seen as acceptable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Exploitation  ==
A large portion of workers have jobs or careers that requires them to use their feelings, or "emotional labor" as Hochschild calls it, in the workplace. Their reactions and actions are based on the way they see how other people react or express their feelings. Companies and corporations see this and use it to exploit workers in order to maximize profits.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Hochschild gives a clear example on how companies maximize their profits through the use of feeling rules by viewing the job of a flight attendant. A flight attendant's job requires emotional labor. The flight attendance uplifts the customer through his or her demeanor and expression of feelings. A flight attendant who is constantly smiling or asking the customer how they are doing is more comforting to a customer versus if a flight attendant who rolls their eyes and rarely smiles. The feeling rules for a flight attendant calls for them to be happy, calm, and to suppress their negative feelings. Customers who see the way the flight attendant upholds themselves are more likely to come back if the experience was pleasant. Which is why many airlines like Delta, which was rated as one of the top airlines calls and requires these feeling rules at the workplace. In a way, this is beneficial to the companies and the customer because the customer is satisfied and keeps coming back, which makes the company more money. However, at the same time, it can be harmful to the flight attendant because they are not able to express their feelings, but rather suppress their feelings for the benefit of others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Fidelity''' is the quality of [[faithfulness]] or [[loyalty]]. Its original meaning regarded [[duty]] in a broader sense than the related concept of ''[[fealty]]''. Both derive from the [[Latin]] word ''fidēlis'', meaning "faithful or loyal". In the [[City of London]] financial markets it has traditionally been used in the sense encompassed in the motto "My word is my bond".

==&lt;span id="lofi"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Audio and electronics==
{{redirect|Low fidelity|the aesthetic|Lo-fi music}}
{{see also|Sound recording and reproduction}}
In audio, "fidelity" denotes how accurately a copy reproduces its source. For example, a worn [[gramophone record]] will have a lower fidelity than one in good condition, and a recording made by a low budget record company in the early 20th century is likely to have significantly less audio fidelity than a good modern recording. In the 1950s, the terms "[[high fidelity]]" or "hi-fi" were popularized for equipment and recordings which exhibited more accurate [[sound reproduction]]. Similarly in [[electronics]], fidelity refers to the correspondence of the output signal to the input signal, rather than sound quality, as in the popular internet connection technology "[[Wi-Fi]]".

==&lt;span id="scimodsim"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Scientific modelling and simulation==
In the fields of [[scientific modelling]] and [[simulation]], fidelity refers to the degree to which a model or simulation reproduces the state and behaviour of a real world object, feature or condition.  Fidelity is therefore a measure of the realism of a model or simulation.&lt;ref name=SISO/&gt;  Simulation fidelity has also been described in the past as "degree of similarity".&lt;ref name=HaysSinger/&gt; In quantum mechanics and optics,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bowman|first=D.|last2=Harte|first2=T.

In the field of [[program evaluation]], the term fidelity denotes how closely a set of procedures were implemented as they were supposed to have been.

[[File:Foot whipping.JPG|thumb|262px|Bastinado demonstration using a cane]]
'''Foot whipping''' or '''bastinado''' is a method of [[corporal punishment]] which consists of hitting the soles of a person's bare [[feet]]. Unlike most types of flogging, this punishment was meant to be more painful than it was to cause actual injury to the victim. Blows were generally delivered with a light rod, knotted cord, or lash.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/flogging#ref177595&lt;/ref&gt;

The receiving person is required to be [[barefoot]]. The uncovered [[sole (foot)|soles]] of the feet need to be placed in an exposed position. The beating is typically performed with an object in the type of a [[caning|cane]] or [[Switch (corporal punishment)|switch]]. The strokes are usually aimed at the [[arches of the foot|arches of the feet]] and repeated a certain number of times.

Bastinado is also referred to as ''foot (bottom) caning'' or ''sole caning'', depending on the instrument in use. The particular Middle East method is called ''falaka'' or ''falanga'',&lt;ref&gt;Cfr. [[Wolfgang Schweickard]], [http://www.uni-saarland.de/lehrstuhl/schweickard/turkisms-in-italian-french-and-german/articles.html ''Turkisms in Italian, French and German (Ottoman Period, 1300-1900). A historical and etymological dictionary'' s.v. ''falaka'']&lt;/ref&gt; derived from the Greek term ''[[phalanx]]''. The German term is ''Bastonade'', deriving from the Italian noun ''bastonata'' (''stroke with the use of a stick''). In former times it was also referred to as ''Sohlenstreich'' (corr. ''striking the soles''). The Chinese term is ''da jiao xin''.

==Overview==
The first scripted documentation of bastinado in Europe dates back to the year 1537, in China to 960.{{sfn|Rejali|2009|p=274}} References to bastinado have been hypothesised to be found in the [[Bible]] (Prov. 22:15; Lev. 19:20; Deut. 22:18), suggesting the practice since antiquity.&lt;ref name="www.biblegateway.com"&gt;{{cite web| title=BASTINADO| url=http://www.biblegateway.com/resources/dictionaries/dict_meaning.php?source=1&amp;wid=T0000469| publisher=www.biblegateway.com| accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This subform of [[flagellation]] differentiates from most other forms by limiting the strokes to a very narrow section of the body. The beatings typically aim at the vaults of the feet where the soles are particularly pain sensitive, at this usually avoiding hitting the balls and heels directly but concentrating on the small area in between.

As the skin texture under the soles of the feet can naturally endure high levels of strain, injuries demanding medical attention, such as lacerations or bruises, are rarely inflicted if certain precautions are observed by the executant. The undersides of the feet have therefore become a common target for corporal punishment in many cultures while basically different methods exist.

Foot whipping is typically carried out within [[prison]]s and similar institutions. Besides inflicting intense physical suffering it trades on the significance of bare feet as a dishonouring socio-cultural attribute. Therefore, it is regarded to be a particularly humiliating as well as degrading form of punishment.

As wearing shoes is an integral element of societal appearance since antiquity, the visual exposure of bare feet is a traditional and sometimes even [[Barefoot#Religious aspects|ritualistic practice]] to display the subjection or submission of a person under a manifestation of superior power. At this was often used as a visual indicator of a subservient standing within a social structure and to display the imbalance in power. It was therefore routinely imposed as a visual identifier and obstacle on [[Barefoot#Imprisonment and slavery|slaves]] and [[prisoner]]s, often divested of rights and liberties in a similar manner. Exploiting its socio-cultural significance, people have been forced to go barefoot as a formal [[Badge of shame#Bare feet|shame sanction]] and for [[Public humiliation#Shameful exposure|public humiliation]] as well. Keeping prisoners barefoot is common practice [[Barefoot#Imprisonment|in several countries]] of today.

Foot whipping therefore poses a distinct threat and is often particularly dreaded by potential victims (usually prisoners). Exploiting the effects this penalty is typically used to maintain discipline and compliance in prisons.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Eysenck, Meili: Lexikon der Psychologie (Encyclopedia of Psychology), Band 3, 1973, S. 476f, {{ISBN|3-451-16113-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bastinado is commonly associated with Middle and Far Eastern nations, where it is occasionally executed in public, therefore covered by occasional reports and photographs. However it has been frequently practised within in the Western World as well, particularly in [[prison]]s, [[reformatory|reformatories]], [[boarding school]]s and similar institutions.

In Europe bastinado was a frequently encountered form of corporal punishment particularly in German areas, where it was mainly carried out to enforce [[Discipline#Prison discipline|discipline]] within penal and reformatory institutions, culminating during the [[Nazi-Germany|Third Reich]] era. In several German and Austrian institutions it was still practised during the 1950s.&lt;ref name="kurier.at"&gt;{{cite web| title=Wimmersdorf: 270 Schläge auf die Fußsohlen| url=http://kurier.at/chronik/niederoesterreich/wimmersdorf-270-schlaege-auf-die-fusssohlen/30.980.261| language=de| publisher=kurier.at| accessdate=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="krone.at"&gt;"krone.at" vom 29.

Instead it was carried out on a rather low level within the confines of the institutions, typically to punish inmates during incarceration. If not specifically authorized the practice was usually condoned, while happening unbeknown to the public. Also foot whipping hardly attracts public interest in general as it appears unspectacular and relatively inoffensive compared to other punishment methods. As it was not executed publicly in the western world, it came to be witnessed only by the individuals directly involved. At this former prisoners rarely communicate incidents as bastinado is widely perceived as a degrading punishment (see [[Public humiliation#Shameful exposure|public humiliation]]), while former executants are usually obliged to confidentiality.

Bastinado is still used as prison punishment in several countries (see below). As it causes a high level of suffering for the victim and [[physical evidence]] remains largely undetectable after some time, it is frequently used for [[interrogation]] and [[torture]].

== Appearance ==
Bastinado usually requires a certain amount of collaborative effort and an authoritarian presence on the executing party to be enforced. Therefore, it typically appears in settings where corporal punishment is officially approved to be exerted on predefined group of people. This can be situations of imprisonment and incarceration as well as [[slavery]]. This moderated subform of [[flagellation]] is characteristically prevalent where subjected individuals are forced to remain barefoot.

=== Regional ===
Foot whipping was common practice as means of disciplinary punishment in different kinds of institutions throughout Central Europe until the 1950s, especially in German territories.&lt;ref name="kurier.at" /&gt;&lt;ref name="krone.at" /&gt; &lt;br&gt;
In German prisons this method consistently served as the principal disciplinary punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hawkins |first=Francis Bisset |title=Germany: The Spirit of Her History, Literature, Social Condition and National Economy : Illustrated by Reference to Her Physical, Moral, and Political Statistics, and by Comparison with Other Countries |publisher=Charles Jugel at the German and foreign library |date=1839 |page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] era it was frequently used in German penal institutions and labour camps.&lt;br&gt;It was also inflicted on the population in occupied territories, notably Denmark and Norway.{{sfn|Rejali|2009|p=275}}

During the era of slavery in Brazil and the American South it was often used whenever so-called "clean beating" instead of the prevalent more radical forms of [[flagellation]] was demanded. This was the case when a loss in market value through visible injuries especially on females was to be avoided. As many so-called "slave-codes" included a barefoot constraint, bastinado required minimal effort to be performed.&lt;ref name="WCG"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cape Town and Surrounds.|url=https://www.westerncape.gov.za/general-publication/places-slave-rememberance-western-cape?toc_page=3|publisher=Western Cape Government| accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As it was sufficiently effective but usually left no visible or relevant injuries, bastinado was often used as an alternative for female slaves with higher market value.{{sfn|Rejali|2009|p=277}}

Bastinado is still practised in penal institutions of several countries around the world. In a 1967 survey 83% of the inmates in Greek prisons reported about frequent infliction of bastinado. It was also used against rioting students. In Spanish prisons 39% of the inmates reported about this kind of treatment. The French [[Sûreté]] reportedly used it to extract confessions. British occupants used it in Palestine, French occupants in Algeria. Within colonial India it was used to punish tax offenders. Within penal institutions in Europe bastinado was reportedly used in Germany, Austria, France, Spain, Greece, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Portugal, Macedonia, Lithuania, Georgia, Ukraine, Cyprus, Slovakia and Croatia. Other nations with documented use of bastinado are Syria, Israel, Turkey, Morocco, Iran, Egypt, Iraq, Libya, Lebanon, Tunisia, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Brazil, Argentina, Nicaragua, Chile, South Africa, Venezuela, Rhodesia, Zimbabwe, Paraguay, Honduras, Bolivia, Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya, Cameroon, Mauritius, Philippines, South Korea, Pakistan and Nepal.{{sfn|Rejali|2009|p=275}}

*[[Bahá'u'lláh]] (founder of the [[Bahá'í Faith]]) underwent foot whipping in August 1852 as a follower of the Babi religion. (Esslemont, 1937).
*It was used throughout the [[Ottoman Empire]].
*Foot whipping was used at the [[Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum|S-21]] prison in [[Phnom Penh]] during the rule of the [[Khmer Rouge]] and is mentioned in the ten regulations to prisoners now on display in the [[Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum]].
*This punishment has, at various times, been used in [[China]], as well as the [[Middle East]]. "No crimes pass unpunished in China. The bastinado is the common punishment for slight faults, and the number of blows is proportionable to the nature of the fault... When the number of blows does not exceed twenty, it is accounted a fatherly correction. The emperor himself sometimes commands it to be inflicted on great persons, and afterwards sees them and treats them as usual." &lt;ref&gt;https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/mod/1680halde3.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==
[[File:Antoin Sevruguin 12 Falak Whipping the soles of a criminal.jpg|thumb|left|Middle Eastern falaka using a plank; [[Iran]], early 20th century]]
[[File:Third Reich bastonade table.jpg|thumb|Depiction of punishment bench as used for bastinado in several German prisons during the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] era]] 
The prisoner is barefooted and restrained in such manner, that the feet cannot be shifted out of position. The intention is to avert serious injuries of the forefoot by stray hitting, especially of the fracturable [[toe]]s. The energy of the stroke impacts is typically meant to be absorbed by the muscular tissue inside the vaults of the feet.

The Middle Eastern ''falaka'' method entails tying up the person's feet into an elevated position while lying on the back, the beating is generally performed with a rigid wooden stick, a club or a truncheon. The term ''falaka'' describes the wooden plank used to tie up the ankles, however different items are used for this purpose. The essentially different German method, which was practiced until the end of the [[Nazism|Third Reich]] era, consisted in strapping the barefoot prisoner prone onto a wooden bench or a plank. Hereby the feet were forced into a pointed posture ([[Plantarflexion#Flexion and extension of the foot|plantar flexion]]) with their bare undersides facing upward. For this purpose the upper body and both ankles were strapped onto the bench. The prisoner's hands were tied behind the back, usually using a cord or a leather strap. Hereby the person was rendered largely immobile and was especially not able to move the feet out of their forced position. The typically occurring contortions of the body during the execution were largely halted as well. This way the punishment could be inflicted with a certain degree of accuracy to not cause unwanted lesions or other severe injury. It was typically executed with a slightly flexible beating accessory such as a [[caning|cane]] or a [[switch (corporal punishment)|switch]]. More infrequently also short [[whip]]s or leather straps were used. This form of punishment was mainly employed in women's penal institutions and [[labor camp]]s where prisoners were often kept barefoot.&lt;ref name="Cesereanu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AI Newsletter 09-1987 [http://ob.nubati.net/wiki/Illustrated_Reports_of_Amnesty_International Illustrated Reports of Amnesty International] 20 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The middle eastern ''falaka'' is more inclined to cause serious injuries such as bone fractures and nerve damage than the German method, as the person undergoing falaka can move the body and feet to a certain degree. As a result, the strokes impact more or less randomly and injury-prone areas are frequently affected. As falaka is usually carried out with a rigid and often heavy stick, it accordingly causes [[blunt trauma]] leaving the person unable to walk and often impeded for life. For the German form, the prisoner was principally unable to move and the beatings were performed with lightweight objects that were relatively thin in diameter and usually slightly flexible. The physical aftereffects of the procedure remained mostly superficial and unwanted injuries were relatively rare. Therefore, the person usually remained capable of walking right after the punishment. Still, the German form of bastinado caused severe levels of pain and suffering for the receiving person.

== Effects ==
The beatings usually aim at the tender [[longitudinal arch of the foot]] avoiding the bone structure of the ball and the heel. The vaults are particularly touch-sensitive and therefore susceptible to pain due to the tight clustering of [[nerve|nerve ending]]s.

=== Corporal ===
[[File:Bastinado visible aftereffects.JPG|thumb|160px|Visible welts typically sustained after bastinado]]
When exerted with a thin and flexible object of lighter weight the corporal effects usually remain temporary. The numerous [[bone]]s and [[tendon]]s of the foot are sufficiently protected by [[muscular tissue]] so the impact is absorbed by the skin and muscular tissue. The skin under the soles of the human feet is of high elasticity and consistence similar to the palms of the hands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medizinfo.de/hautundhaar/anatomie/lederhaut.htm Lederhaut] in „MedizInfo“ about the dermis; 20 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Lesions and [[hematoma]] therefore rarely occur while beating marks are mostly superficial. Depending on the characteristics of the beating device in use and the intensity of the beatings the emerging visible aftereffects remain ascertainable over a time frame of a few hours to several days. The receiving person usually remains able to walk without help right after the punishment.

When the beating is executed with heavy sticks like clubs or truncheons according to the falaka method, bone fractures commonly occur as well as nerve damage and severe hematoma. The sustained injuries can take a long time to heal with even lasting or irreversible physical damage to the [[human musculoskeletal system]].

When thin and flexible instruments are used the immediate experience of pain is described as acutely stinging and searing. The instant sensations are disproportionally intense compared to the applied force and reflexively radiate through the body. The subsequent pain sensations of a succession of strokes are often described as throbbing, piercing or burning and gradually ease off within a few hours. A slightly stinging or nagging sensation often remains perceptible for a couple of days, especially while walking.

As the nerve endings under the soles of the feet do not adapt to recurring sensations or impacts, the pain reception does not alleviate through continuous beatings. On the contrary the perception of pain is further intensified over the course of additional impacts through the activation of [[nociceptor]]s. Over a sequence of impacts applied with nearly constant force the perception of pain is therefore progressively intensifying until a maximum level of activation is reached. For that reason a facile impact can already cause an acute pain sensation after a certain number of preceding strokes.

The subjective experience of corporal suffering can however largely diverge according to a person's individual [[pain tolerance]]. The pain reception itself is hereby aggravated through feelings of anxiety and agitation. The subjective pain susceptibility is accordingly higher the more apprehensive the individual feels about it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medizinfo.de/schmerz/rezeptor.htm Schmerzrezeptoren] in „MedizInfo“ about pain receptors; 20 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weiss.de/krankheiten/fibro/ursachen/schmerz-angst/ Schmerz und Angst] in „Praxisklinik Dr. med. Thomas Weiss“ about intensification of pain through anxiety; 20 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Further the female gender generally experiences physical pain notably more intensive and typically reacts with a higher level of anxiety. At the same time women are distinctly sensitive to pressure pain. According to respective assertions women's subjective suffering under the infliction of foot whipping therefore is significantly more severe. The acute pain sensations can hereby be experienced as largely intolerable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geschlechterstudien.de/1-1-schmerzforschung.html Schmerzforschung] in „GeschlechterStudien“ (gender studies) about pain research; 17 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mental ===
Seizing and withholding the footwear from a person in a situation of imprisonment, which is commonplace in many countries ([[Barefoot#Imprisonment and slavery]]), often has a disconsolating and victimizing effect on the individual. As bare feet are traditionally regarded as a token of subjection and captivity, the unaccustomed and largely reluctant exposure is often perceived as humiliating or oppressive. The increased physical [[vulnerability]] by having to remain barefoot often leads to trepidation and the feeling of insecurity.
This measure alone can therefore already cause significant distress.&lt;ref name="zimbabwe_prisoners"&gt;{{cite news|title=Long hours in a Harare Jail.|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/2018917.stm|accessdate=6 October 2014|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=1 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This circumstance is usually aggravated if the bare feet are the target for corporal punishment.
The feet are typically hidden away and protected by footwear in most social situations, hereby avoiding unwanted exposure. Therefore, the enforced exposure for the purpose of punishment is mostly perceived as a form of harassment. The obligatory restraints further add to the anxiety and humiliation of the captive.

Any form of methodical corporal punishment typically causes a high level of distress through the inflicted pain and the experience of being defenseless and unable to evade the situation. The mostly occurring loss of composure during the punishment as well as the experience of weakness and vulnerability often permanently damages a person’s [[self-esteem]].

Beating the undersides of a person's feet moreover conveys an especially steep imbalance in power between the executing party (prison staff or similar) towards the receiving individual (typically prison inmate). A rather private area of the body, which traditionally remains covered or not visible in the presence of other people, is forcibly exposed and beaten. This act represents a blunt intrusion into the sphere of personal privacy and an according elimination of [[personal boundaries]]. By this means the receiving person experiences his or her individual powerlessness against the executing authority in a particularly manifest way. This experience can also change or deconstruct the individual's [[Self-perception theory|self-perception]] and [[self-awareness]].

As a result, the experience of bastinado leads to drastic physical and mental suffering for the receiving individual and is therefore regarded as a highly effectual method of corporal punishment. 
Exploiting the effects of bastinado on a person, it is still frequently employed on prisoners in several countries.

'''''How Rude!''''' is an American series of comic [[manners]] books for [[teens]] written by educator and psychologist Alex J. Packer, PhD.

==Titles==
Titles include:
* ''How Rude!: The Teenagers' Guide to Good Manners, Proper Behavior and Not Grossing People Out''
* ''The How Rude! Handbook of School Manners for Teens''
* ''The How Rude! Handbook of Family Manners for Teens''
* ''The How Rude! Handbook of Friendship and Dating Manners for Teens''

==Contents==
In 465 pages, ''How Rude!: The Teenagers' Guide to Good Manners, Proper Behavior and Not Grossing People Out'' covers most aspects of life that teens are likely to encounter. The text is broken up into short, "bite-sized" chunks for easy reading.

According to Packer, "Good manners are good for you. They impress people. They build self-esteem. They can help you get what you want from life: friends, fun, success and respect. ''And they don't cost anything''." Seeking to avoid the stereotype of [[etiquette]] books as preachy and dull, ''How Rude!'' keeps teenage readers amused as they learn the basics of polite behavior in all kinds of situations: at home, at school, in public, with friends, with strangers, at the mall, at the movies, on the phone, online, in conversations, at job interviews, in restaurants, on elevators, in cars, on skateboards, at parties, at formal dinners, on the bus and anywhere they go.

Young readers find out how to cope with cliques, handle friendship problems, be a host with the most (and a guest with the best), offer someone their seat, fight fair, answer invitations, deal with rude adults, respond to bigoted remarks, write a letter, dress properly for any occasion, master the proper techniques for civilized spitting, scratching, sneezing, yawning, coughing, hiccuping, nose-picking and much more.

Hundreds of "Dear Alex" questions and answers cover everything from dating to breaking up, thank-you notes to table manners, ethnic jokes to obscene phone calls, skiing to driving. "True Stories from the Manners Frontier" divulge the shocking consequences of ''not'' having good manners. Survey results reveal what teens, parents and teachers think about manners and why they are important.

==Reception==
''How Rude!'' was selected by [[Young Adult Library Services Association]] (YALSA) as a "Popular Paperback for Young Adults" and a "Quick Pick for Reluctant Young Adult Readers."

''[[Voice of Youth Advocates]]'' called ''How Rude!'' "the most incredibly readable, enjoyable, laughable, enlightening and insightful book." ''College Bound'' magazine described ''How Rude!'' as "...one fast-paced, fun-to-read book that covers the basics of good behavior for teens... Just one look at the table of contents will convince you that this isn't your grandma's guidebook. This is a wonderfully hip and humorous easy read!"

''[[School Library Journal]]'' wrote, "From its intriguing title to the tongue-in-cheek ideas for dealing with many kinds of situations, readers will find this manual humorous, non-threatening, entertaining and educational."

==Author==
Packer is an author of many books on parenting. He is President Emeritus of FCD Educational Services, which provides [[drug education]] to colleges and schools.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen R. Delisio, "[http://www.education-world.com/a_issues/chat/chat139.shtml Teaching Manners in a Manner-less World]", ''Education World'', July 4, 2005. Accessed October 9, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other books by Packer include: ''Wise Highs!: How to Thrill, Chill and Get Away from It All Without Alcohol or Other Drugs''; ''Parenting One Day at a Time''; ''Bringing Up Parents: The Teenager's Handbook''; ''365 Ways to Love Your Child''; and with co-author John Dacey, Ph.D., ''The Nurturing Parent: How to Rasie Creative, Loving, Responsible Children''. Packer's books have been translated into many languages including Spanish, German, Serbian, Mandarin, Romanian, Greek, Japanese, Korean and Thai.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18949">'''Human rights in cyberspace''' is a relatively new and uncharted area of law. The [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] ([[UNHRC]]) has stated that the freedoms of expression and information under Article 19('''2''') of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] ([[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|ICCPR]]) include the freedom to receive and communicate information, ideas and opinions through the Internet.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx|title=International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|last=United Nations Human Rights Committee|first=|date=|website=|page=|at=General Comment no.34, note 4, para 12|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important clause is Article 19('''3''') of the ICCPR, which provides that:&lt;blockquote&gt;The exercise of the right provided in paragraph two of this article carries with it special duties and responsibilities. It may therefore be subjected to certain restrictions, but these shall only be such as are provided by law and are necessary:&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;('''a''') For respect of the rights or reputations of others;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;('''b''') For the protection of national security or of public order, or of public health and morals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The HRC has stated that "the same rights that people have offline must also be protected online" (mentioning, in particular, freedom of expression).&lt;ref name="UN Doc A/HRC/RES/20/8 (2012), para1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/G12/153/25/PDF/G1215325.pdf|title=The promotion, protection and enjoyment of human rights on the Internet|last=|first=|date=|website=Human Rights Council Resolution|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=April 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely regarded that this freedom of information must be balanced with other rights. The question is raised whether people's expectations of human rights are different in cyberspace.&lt;ref name="AHRC" /&gt;

==Public privacy==
Public privacy encompasses [[freedom of information]] and expression on the Internet on the one side, and security and privacy in cyberspace on the other side.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{rp|3}} In the context of cyberspace, privacy means using the Internet as a service tool for private purposes without the fear of third parties accessing and using user data in various ways without their consent.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{rp|3}} 

The right to freedom encompasses the [[Freedom of expression|right of expression]] and is stated in several international treaties.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mihr|first1=Anja|date=2013|title=Public Privacy Human Rights in Cyberspace|url=http://www.anjamihr.com/app/download/21133105/Public%2BPrivacy-WP-AnjaMihr%245B1%245D.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} The right includes freedom to receive and impart information and ideas and to hold opinions without any state interference. It also includes the right to express oneself in any medium including exchanging ideas and thoughts through Internet platforms or social networks.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;{{rp|3}} Freedom means the right to political expression especially when it raises matters of public importance.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;{{rp|3}} 

Most democratic countries advance the installation of the Internet for economic and communication purposes; therefore, political expression is given some protection on the Internet. Some governments actively move to protect citizen's data on the Internet. However, these intergovernmental agreements can lead to misuse and abuse of private data, which in turn can affect many other fundamental freedoms and basic human rights.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;{{rp|4}} The challenge for governments is balancing private interests with rules against privacy and freedom rights for all.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;{{rp|3}}

==Governance in cyberspace==
German political scientist [[Anja Mihr]] says that cyberspace harbors more individuals than any other country in the world, yet it is without any government, legislative bodies, law enforcement or any other sort of constitution. Without these mechanisms difficulties arise in protecting and enjoying citizen's rights.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{rp|1}} [[Intergovernmental organization|International Governmental Organisations]] (IGO's), such as the [[United Nations]] (UN), the [[Organization of American States]], the [[African Union]] or the [[European Union]] aim to set international standards for the use of cyberspace and the Internet to be enforced by national governments, but commonly fail to do so. The problem is that state powers and their mechanisms of enforcement do not extend past the state's borders.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{rp|2}} 

Because cyberspace has no borders, the ways and means to govern it are as-yet undefined. This leads to problems wherein those who are willing to commit crimes find it easier to cross borders through the web, as it is unclear where jurisdiction lies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fanchiotti|first1=Vittoriio|last2=Pierini|first2=Jean Paul|date=2012|title=Impact of Cyberspace on Human Rights and Democracy|pages=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a governing regime was ever established, it would most likely consist of multiple stakeholders and actors including national, international, and private actors such as representatives of companies, social networks, nongovernmental organizations as well as individuals.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;{{rp|2}}

==Liability of Internet service providers==
A question arises when there is a breach of an individual's basic human rights. Should the liability fall only on the originator of the breached right, or should the burden also fall on the [[Internet service provider]] (ISP)? This is an especially relevant issue when it comes to balancing free speech against defamation.&lt;ref name="mansell"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/3707/1/Introduction%E2%80%93Human_Rights_and_Equity_in_Cyberspace_%28LSERO%29.pdf|title=Human Rights and Equality in Cyberspace|last1=Mansell|first1=Robin|date=2015-04-01|website=|accessdate=April 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing speed and limitless audience of the Internet pose a greater danger to individuals and their reputations.&lt;ref name=AHRC&gt;{{cite web|title=Background Paper: Human Rights in Cyberspace |url= https://www.humanrights.gov.au/sites/default/files/document/publication/human_rights_cyberspace.pdf |website=Australian Human Right Commission|accessdate=April 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

ISPs may not have the means to monitor content published on their websites, and may be unaware that a defamatory statement exists on their site.&lt;ref name="humanrights.ee" /&gt; This was demonstrated in the case [[Cubby, Inc. v. CompuServe Inc.]]&lt;ref name="Rowland D, Free expression and Defamation"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Klang, Murray|first1=M. A. |title=Human Rights in the Digital Age|date=2005|pages=Chapter 5, p65}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it was found that the ISP was acting as a mere distributor and could not be liable for the content posted on its bulletin. However, in [[Stratton Oakmont, Inc. v. Prodigy Services Co.]]&lt;ref name="Rowland D, Free expression and Defamation" /&gt; the [[New York Supreme Court]] held that Prodigy acted as a publisher with an editorial function, and so was found liable. 

These cases highlight the ambiguity surrounding the liability placed upon ISPs.&lt;ref name="humanrights.ee"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humanrights.ee/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Kijanen_research.pdf|title=New Generation for Human rights in Cyberspace|last1=Kijanen|first1=Pekka|date=|website=|accessdate=2015-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further question is whether ISPs will take it upon themselves to function as “moral guardians”&lt;ref name="mansell" /&gt; of cyberspace. If over-fanatical ISPs start refusing to host certain Internet sites, this may, in turn, compromise rights for the freedom of speech and freedom of expression. In comparison, ambiguity about ISPs liability could mean ISPs permit content without regard to its potentially harmful effects.&lt;ref name="mansell" /&gt;

==Cybersecurity==
Given the prevalence of hacking, viruses and zero day exploits, the [[World Wide Web]] ([[World Wide Web|WWW]]) is a non-secure storage space for the storage of sensitive private information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-08/smiley-credit-check-australians-financial-information-at-risk/8887198|title=Australians' financial information at risk in data breach of US company|date=2017-09-08|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-02-26|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thesslstore.com/blog/cybercrime-super-bowl-lii-not-get-hacked/|title=Cybercrime at Super Bowl LII - How not to get Hacked|date=2018-01-31|work=Hashed Out by The SSL Store™|access-date=2018-02-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://face2faceafrica.com/article/8-ways-stay-safe-online|title=8 ways to stay safe online - Face2Face Africa|date=2018-02-06|work=Face2Face Africa|access-date=2018-02-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/16/10-ways-keep-personal-data-safe|title=Internet security: 10 ways to keep your personal data safe from online snoopers|last=Naughton|first=John|date=2013-09-16|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gigaom.com/2018/02/23/ransomware-attacks-rose-rapidly-in-2017-heres-how-you-can-protect-your-data/|title=Ransomware Attacks Rose Rapidly in 2017: Here’s How You Can Protect Your Data|last=Thompson|first=Jessica|date=2018-02-23|website=gigaom.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529015231/http://www.netindex.com/|title=Global Broadband and Mobile Performance Data Compiled by Ookla {{!}} Net Index|date=2015-05-29|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyberspace is a tool where individuals can exercise their freedom rights, but cyberspace cannot guarantee our freedom.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{rp|11}} Today there are around 2.5 billion internet users.

Countries will do this in various ways. For example, using [[Internet police]]. There are many methods of filtering and censoring the exercise of freedom rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kelly|last2=Truong|last3=Earp|last4=Reed|last5=Shahbaz|last6=Groco-Stoner|first1=Sanja|first2=Mai|first3=Madeline|first4=Laura|first5=Adrian|first6=Ashley|title=A Global Assessment of Internet and Digital Media|url=http://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/resurces/FOTN%202013_Full%20Report_0.pdf|website=Freedom on the net 2013|publisher=Freedom House 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mass surveillance and fear of private communications being made public lead to self-censorship. This results in individuals no longer using search engines or social networks to express their personal beliefs, ideas or opinions, as certain keywords may trigger concerns with national security agencies, resulting in the Internet becoming a political tool of manipulation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;{{rp|13}}

==Discriminatory behaviors==

===Cyber bullying===
Discriminatory behaviors that occur ‘offline’ also occur ‘online’ One of these behaviors is ‘cyber bullying’. [[Cyberbullying]] affects at least one in ten students in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amf.org.au/FactSheets|title=See the Alannah and Madeline Foundation's Bullying hurts brochure at|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=2015-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyberbullying can impact on a range of human rights including: the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UDHR, art 25|website=ICESCR, art 12 (1); CRC art 24}}&lt;/ref&gt; rights to work and fair working conditions;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UDHR, art 23|website=ICESCR, arts 6 and 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; the right to freedom of expression and to hold opinions without interference;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UDHR, art 19|website=ICESCR, art 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; a child or young person’s right to leisure and play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CRC, art 31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/technology/contents-removed-from-racist-facebook--page-20120808-23tr1.html|title=Contents removed from racist Facebook page|last=Lowe|first=Asher Moses and Adrian|date=2012-08-08|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cyber-racism===
[[Cyber racism]] can be in the form of individuals posting racist comments or participating in group pages specifically set up for a racist purpose.&lt;ref name=AHRC/&gt; A well publicised example of this was an Aboriginal memes Facebook page that consisted of various images of indigenous people with racist captions. It was reported that Facebook classified the page as ‘controversial humour’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/contents-removed-from-racit-facebook--page-20120808-23tr1.html|title=Contents removed from racist Facebook page|last1=Moses|first1=A|last2=Lowe|first2=A|date=|website=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=2015-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hate speech===
Article 20 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|ICCPR]] states “Any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence shall be prohibited by law.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx |title=International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights |publisher=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights |accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hate speech]] is intended to disturb violence or prejudicial actions against a group of people based on their ethnicity, race, nationality or sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="humanrights.ee"/&gt; Cyberspace has also been used in this way as a medium for destruction. 

The danger to human rights becomes apparent when terrorists form together to scheme and agitate people to commit violence towards a common good. “[[Al-Qaeda]]” moved to cyberspace, “the ultimate ungoverned territory” where schools were set up for promotion of ideological and military training and active propaganda arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/world/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9472498|title=A world wide web of terror|last=|first=|date=|website=The Economist|accessdate=2015-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has become a stated subject of importance that these situations are monitored to prepare for future generations of cyber-terrorists.&lt;ref name="humanrights.ee" /&gt;

==Future of human rights in the Digital Age==
The future of human rights in cyberspace depends on the evolution of the law and its interpretation by national and international governing bodies.&lt;ref name=mansell/&gt; [[Jon Bing]] warns that once rules and regulations are automated, they become extremely arduous to subject to judicial review.&lt;ref name=mansell/&gt; Bing states that we face a situation in which “technology [is] implementing the law”.&lt;ref name=mansell/&gt; 

Roger Brownsword looked at some of the issues associated with developments in biotechnology and human rights alongside those raised by digital technologies and suggested three ethical positions on the issues: a utilitarian pragmatic stance, a defense of human rights, and a “dignitarian alliance”.&lt;ref name="mansell" /&gt; Of the three positions, [[Andrew Brownsword|Brownsword]] claims the first two are popular in the UK, stating that technologies are being developed that treat human subjects as if they lack autonomy and the capacity to choose for themselves.&lt;ref name="mansell" /&gt; 

Recent official discussions have taken place as to the future of cyberspace. In April 2008, the Virtual Law Conference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virtuallawconference.com/|title=More Information available at|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=2015-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; was held in New York. The conference included participants such as [[Microsoft]], [[Sony]], and the [[Walt Disney Company]]. The agenda included discussion of intellectual property enforcement, legal issues arising from virtual currency, legal issues arising from virtual property, ethical concerns for attorneys and executives in virtual worlds, and how to litigate a virtual lawsuit.&lt;ref name="humanrights.ee" /&gt; 

The US Congressional Hearing on Virtual Worlds took place with the purpose of education and exploring the prospects of virtual worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energycommerce.house.gov/cmte_mtgs/110-ti-hrg.040108.VirtualWorlds.shtml|title=Online Virtual World: Applications in a User Generated Medium|last=|first=|date=|website=The Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet|accessdate=2015-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agenda included an analysis of concerns related to consumer protection, intellectual property protection, and child protection, among others. This hearing was one of the first legislative inquiries into virtual worlds. It remains to be seen whether either of these gatherings hold any lasting impact on the field, which continues to rapidly evolve in lockstep with advancing technology.&lt;ref name="humanrights.ee" /&gt;

'''John Richard Perry''' (born 1943) is Henry Waldgrave Stuart Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at [[Stanford University]] and Distinguished Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at the [[University of California, Riverside]]. He has made significant contributions to philosophy in the fields of [[philosophy of language]], [[metaphysics]], and [[philosophy of mind]]. He is known primarily for his work on [[situation semantics]] (together with [[Jon Barwise]]), [[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]], [[indexicality]], [[personal identity]], and [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|self-knowledge]].

==Life and career==
John Perry was born in [[Lincoln, Nebraska]] on January 16, 1943. He received his B.A. in philosophy from [[Doane College]] in 1964 and his Ph.D. in philosophy from [[Cornell University]] in 1968 under the supervision of [[Sydney Shoemaker]]. He taught philosophy at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], before joining the faculty at [[Stanford University]] where he is Henry Waldgrave Professor of Philosophy Emeritus.   He subsequently taught at the [[University of California, Riverside]], where he is now Distinguished Professor of Philosophy Emeritus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophy.ucr.edu/john-perry/ University of California, Riverside, Department of Philosophy Faculty Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was awarded the [[Jean Nicod Prize]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Biographical details from John Perry's ''curriculum vitae'', https://web.archive.org/web/20110629220034/http://www-csli.stanford.edu/~jperry//vita/vita.html.&lt;/ref&gt; He is a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://humsci.stanford.edu/faculty/awards/academy_arts_sciences American Academy of Arts and Sciences - School of Humanities and Sciences&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311022715/http://humsci.stanford.edu/faculty/awards/academy_arts_sciences |date=2016-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnva.no/c26849/artikkel/vis.html?tid=40104 |title=Gruppe 3: Idéfag |publisher=[[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=16 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109221405/http://www.dnva.no/c26849/artikkel/vis.html?tid=40104 |archivedate= 9 January 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, he became co-host, with [[Kenneth Allen Taylor|Kenneth Taylor]], of ''[[Philosophy Talk]],'' the radio program that "questions everything... except your intelligence." He is also part of the Center for the Study of Language and Information ([[Stanford University centers and institutes#Center_for_the_Study_of_Language_and_Information|CSLI]])&amp;mdash;an independent research center founded in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-csli.stanford.edu/ CSLI Center for the Study of Language and Information - Stanford University&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical work==
Perry has made contributions to many areas of philosophy, including [[logic]], [[philosophy of language]], [[metaphysics]], and [[philosophy of mind]].

Perry's 1978 book ''[[A Dialogue on Personal Identity and Immortality]]'' deals with standard problems in the theory of [[personal identity]] in the form of a dialogue between a mortally wounded university professor, Gretchen Weirob, and her two friends, Sam Miller and Dave Cohen. The views represented include those of [[Bernard Williams]], [[John Locke]], and [[Derek Parfit]]. The format of associating different philosophical positions with different characters in a dialogue recalls [[David Hume]]'s ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]''.

In 1979, Perry published "The Problem of the Essential Indexical" in which he combined his work on philosophy of language and philosophy of mind. Essential indexicals (I, here, and now) are parts of language that cannot be paraphrased away. They are seen as locating beliefs and are essential to understand the speaker's belief. Perry presents a now famous example to illustrate his point:

"I once followed a trail of sugar on a supermarket floor, pushing my cart down the aisle on one side of a tall counter and back the aisle on the other, seeking the shopper with the torn sack to tell him he was making a mess. With each trip around the counter, the trail became thicker. But I seemed unable to catch up. Finally it dawned on me. I was the shopper I was trying to catch."

In this example, the pronoun "I" is essentially indexical because it allowed Perry to realize that it was he himself making the mess. This realization caused him to change his behavior. Essential indexicals create the impetus for action. They cannot be paraphrased away while retaining their immediacy. If Perry were to say "Perry realized that Perry was making a mess", it would still not be essentially indexical because Perry would still have to understand that he himself is Perry. Without that extra step, there would be no reason for him to change his action. "I" is the only essential indexical in that situation.

In logic, Perry and [[Jon Barwise]] are known for discussion of the [[slingshot argument]], especially in their 1981 article "Semantic Innocence and Uncompromising Situations".

In his 2001 book ''Knowledge, Possibility and Consciousness'', Perry argues for what he calls "antecedent physicalism", according to which [[physicalism]] is antecedently taken to be a plausible and reasonable position, provided that there are no better rival theories. Thus, Perry defends a version of [[type physicalism]] against three major philosophical arguments for [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]]: the [[Philosophical zombie|zombie argument]], the [[Mary's Room|knowledge argument]], and the [[Saul Kripke|modal argument]].

Perry also produces non-technical work that reaches a wider audience, such as his humorous 1996 online essay entitled "Structured Procrastination".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/How-to-ProcrastinateStill/93959|title=How to Procrastinate and Still Get Things Done|last=Perry|first=John|authorlink=John Perry (philosopher)|date=February 23, 1996|website=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218090944/http://www.chronicle.com/article/How-to-ProcrastinateStill/93959|archive-date=February 18, 2017|dead-url=no|access-date=February 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Perry was awarded an [[List of Ig Nobel Prize winners#2011|Ig Nobel Prize in Literature]] for this essay in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Winners of the 2011 Ig Nobel Awards, http://articles.boston.com/2011-09-29/news/30218720_1_throwers-ig-nobel-awards-improbable-research{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://chronicle.com/article/10-Ig-Nobels-Awarded-/129224/ | title=15 Years After an Essay on Procrastination, a Philosopher Wins an Ig Nobel (&amp; his reaction) | publisher=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] | date=September 29, 2011 | accessdate=November 3, 2011 | author=Troop, Don}}&lt;/ref&gt; It states that "[t]o be a high achiever, always work on something important, using it as a way to avoid doing something that's even more important".

'''Kammaññatā''' (Pali) is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] term translated as  "wieldiness", and it is the basis for the following pair of [[Mental_factors_(Buddhism)|mental factors]] within the Theravada Abhidharma teachings:
* ''Kāya-kammaññatā'' - wieldiness of mental body (or "wieldiness of cetisakas")
* ''Citta-kammaññatā'' - wieldiness of consciousness (or "wieldiness of citta")

These two mental factors have the characteristic of the subsiding of unwieldiness (''akammaññabhāva'') in the mental body and consciousness, respectively.

==Definition==
Bhikkhu Bodhi states:{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2012|loc=Kindle Locations 2370-2373}}
:The twofold wieldiness has the characteristic of the subsiding of unwieldiness (akammaññabhāva) in the mental body and consciousness, respectively. Its function is to crush unwieldiness. It is manifested as success of the mental body and consciousness in making something an object. Its proximate cause is the mental body and consciousness. It should be regarded as opposed to the remaining hindrances, which create unwieldiness of the mental body and consciousness.

Nina van Gorkom explains:{{sfn|van Gorkom|2010|pp=227-228}}
:Kammaññatā can be translated as wieldiness or workableness. The ''[[Atthasālinī]]'' (I, Book I, Part IV, Chapter I, 131) explains that they suppress unwieldiness in cetasikas and citta, and that they should be regarded as “bringing faith in objects of faith, and patient application in works of advantage, and are like purity of gold.”
:When there is wieldiness, citta and cetasikas are like gold which has been made workable. The ''Mula-Tīkā'' expresses this as follows:
::Workableness signifies that specific or suitable degree of pliancy or softness which makes the gold, that is, the mind, workable. While the mind is in the flames of passion it is too soft to be workable, as molten gold is. If, on the contrary, the mind is too rigid then it is comparable to untempered gold.
:Wieldiness is the opponent of the “[[Five hindrances|hindrances]]”, such as sensuous desire (''kamacchanda'') and anger or hate (''vyapada''), which cause mental unwieldiness.

'''Mahatma''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|h|ɑː|t|m|ə|,_|-|ˈ|h|æ|t|-}}) is [[Sanskrit]] for "Great Soul"  (महात्मा ''mahātmā'': महा ''mahā'' (great) + आत्मं or आत्मन ''ātman'' [soul]).  It is similar in usage to the modern English term [[saint]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Mahātma |year=1905}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This [[epithet]] is commonly applied to prominent people like [[Basava|Basaveshwara]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archivepmo.nic.in/drmanmohansingh/speech-details.php?nodeid=333|title=PM's address on the occasion of release of Commemorative Coin in honour of Mahatma Basaveshwara :

It has also been historically used for a class of Jain scholars.

==Mohandas Gandhi's title "Mahatma"==
{{Main article|Mahatma Gandhi}}
According to  [[Rabindranath Tagore]] is said to have used on March 6, 1915, this title for Gandhi.&lt;ref&gt;Dutta, Krishna and Andrew Robinson, ''Rabindranath Tagore: An Anthology'', p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Some claim that he was called Mahatma by the residents of Gurukul Kangadi in April 1915,&lt;ref&gt;[http://inextlive.jagran.com/mahatma-gandhi-201210010040 और इस तरह गांधी महात्मा बन गए, 01-Oct-2012]&lt;/ref&gt; and he in turn called the founder Munshiram a Mahatma (who later became [[Swami Shraddhananda]]). However, a document honoring him with the title "Mahatma" on Jan 21, 1915, in [[Jetpur, Navagadh|Jetpur]], Gujarat, by [[Nautamlal Bhagavanji Mehta|Nautamlal Bhagvanji Mehta]] is preserved at the National Gandhi Museum in New Delhi, India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gandhimuseum.org/site/sections/photo-section/ National Gandhi Museum, New Delhi]; [http://www.kamdartree.com/index.php?id=57&amp;stitle=Mahatma%20&amp;%20Kamdars KamdarTree.com]&lt;/ref&gt; This document remains the earliest record of the title "Mahatma" being bestowed upon Gandhi. The use of the term Mahatma in [[Jainism]] to denote a class of lay priests, has been noted since the 17th century. A Mahatma is someone who practices [[Trikaranasuddhi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sankar R N|first1=Ajith|title=Ascertaining Linkages between Trikaranasuddhi and ‘Tapping Spirituality as the Context of Leadership’|journal=IPE Journal of Management|date=Jul–Dec 2012|volume=1|issue=2|pages=81–105|ssrn=2212138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Theosophy}} Theosophy&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Order of the Star in the East]] --&gt;==
The word, used in a technical sense, was popularized in [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] literature in the late 19th century, when Madame [[Helena Blavatsky]], one of the founders of the [[Theosophical Society]], claimed that her teachers were [[adept]]s (or Mahatmas) who reside in [[Asia]].

According to the Theosophical teachings, the Mahatmas are not disembodied beings, but highly evolved people involved in overseeing the spiritual growth of individuals and the development of civilizations. Blavatsky was the first person in modern times to claim contact with these Adepts, especially the "Masters" [[Koot Hoomi]] and [[Morya (Theosophy)|Morya]]. [[Alvin Boyd Kuhn]] wrote about mahātmās:&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn (1930), – p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Masters whom Theosophy presents to us are simply high-ranking students in life's school of experience. They are members of our own evolutionary group, not visitants from the celestial spheres. They are supermen only in that they have attained knowledge of the laws of life and mastery over its forces with which we are still struggling.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In September and October 1880, Blavatsky visited [[Alfred Percy Sinnett|A. P. Sinnett]] at [[Shimla|Simla]] in northern India. Sinnett wrote ''[[The Occult World]]'' (1881) and [[Esoteric Buddhism (book)|''Esoteric Buddhism'']] (1883).

There has been a great deal of controversy concerning the existence of adepts. Blavatsky's critics have doubted the existence of her Masters.  See, for example, W. E. Coleman's "exposes".

After Blavatsky's death in 1891, numerous individuals have claimed to be in contact with her Adept Teachers. These individuals have stated that they are new "messengers" of the Masters and they have conveyed various esoteric teachings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blavatskyarchives.com/latermessengers.htm Madame Blavatsky &amp; the Latter-Day Messengers of the Masters].&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, various [[New Age]], [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]], and religious organizations refer to them as [[Ascended Master]]s, although their character and teachings are in several respects different from those described by Theosophical writers.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C. W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1929 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Partridge, Christopher ed. ''New Religions: A Guide: New Religious Movements, Sects and Alternative Spiritualities'' Oxford University Press, USA 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some individuals{{who|date=August 2017}} believe that Mahatma Maitreya (also called World Teacher) will make contact with all Humanity in January 2017.

==Divine Light Mission==
The [[Divine Light Mission]] (DLM) was a [[Contemporary Sant Mat movements|Sant Mat]]-based movement begun in India in the 1930s by [[Hans Ji Maharaj]] and formally incorporated in 1960. The DLM had as many as 2,000 Mahatmas, all from India or Tibet, who taught the DLM's secret meditation techniques called "Knowledge".  The Mahatmas, called "realised souls",&lt;ref name="Price, Maeve 1979 Page 279-296"&gt;Price, Maeve (1979): The Divine Light Mission as a social organization. (1) Sociological Review, 27, Page 279-296&lt;/ref&gt; or "apostles",  also served as local leaders.&lt;ref&gt;[[Saul V. Levine|Levine, Saul V.]] in {{cite book |author=Galanter, Marc |title=Cults and New Religious Movements: A Report of the American Psychiatric Association |publisher=American Psychiatric Pub., Inc |location= |year=1989 |pages= |isbn=0-89042-212-5 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Hans Ji's death in 1966 his youngest son,  [[Prem Rawat]] (known then as Guru Maharaj Ji or Bagyogeshwar), succeeded him. The young guru appointed some new Mahatmas, including one from the United States.  In one incident, a prominent Indian Mahatma nearly beat a man to death in Detroit for throwing a pie at the guru.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Who's Who in Gurus|first=Dennis |last=Bartel|page= 55|work=Harper's|date=November 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early 1980s, Prem Rawat replaced the Divine Light Mission organization with the Elan Vital and replaced the Mahatmas with initiators. The initiators did not have the revered status of the Mahatmas, and they were drawn mostly from Western followers.&lt;ref name="Price, Maeve 1979 Page 279-296"/&gt; In the 2000s, the initiators were replaced by a video in which Rawat teaches the techniques himself.

==In popular culture==
[[W. C. Fields#At Paramount|W.C. Fields]] used the pseudonym Mahatma Kane Jeeves when writing the script for ''[[The Bank Dick]]'' (1940), in a play on both the word "Mahatma" and a phrase an aristocrat might use when addressing a servant, before leaving the house: "My hat, my cane, Jeeves".

==Jain Mahatmas==
{{Further|Yati}}
[[File:MewarRamayanaP22MahatmaHirananda.jpg|thumb|Mewad Ramayana manuscript: The colophon in red: states text was written by the Mahatma Hirananda,  was commissioned by Acarya Jasvant for the  library of Maharana Jagat Singh I of Mewar. Finished on Friday 25 November 1650]]
Among the [[Jain]]s the term  Mahatma is used for class for scholars who are householders.

===Mahatma Hirananda of Mewad===
The Mewad Ramayana&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-26670449 In pictures: Stunning Ramayana manuscript goes digital, BBC, 21 March 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; described as "one of the most beautiful manuscripts in the world"&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/indiaatlse/2014/06/13/mewar-ramayana/ The Mewar Ramayana at the British Library: How the complete digital version came to be]&lt;/ref&gt; has been digitally reunited after being split between organisations in the UK and India for over 150 years, by the British Library and CSMVS Museum in Mumbai.  The colophon states that the text,  commissioned by Acarya Jasvant for the library of Maharana Jagat Singh I of Mewar, was written by the Mahatma Hirananda,   was finished on Friday 25 November 1650.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/ttp/ramayana/accessible/pages21and22.html#content  Ramayana - Pages 21 and 22 (British Library Add. MSS 15296-15297 and IO San 3621)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Mahatma Hirananda being a Jain scribe, incorporated traditional Jain scribal elements into the manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/ttp/ramayana/accessible/pages3and4.html#content  Ramayana - Pages 3 and 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jain Mahatmas in the [[Dabestan-e Mazaheb]]===
The famous [[Dabestan-e Mazaheb]] often attributed to one Mohsin Fani, written around 1655 CE. is a text written in the Mughal period that describes various religions and philosophies the author encountered.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cxJgAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=THE+DABIST%C3%81N,+OR+SCHOOL+OF+MANNERS&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q=THE%20DABIST%C3%81N%2C%20OR%20SCHOOL%20OF%20MANNERS&amp;f=false  The Dabistán: Or, School of Manners: The Religious Beliefs, Observances, Philosophic Opinions and Social Customs of the Nations of the East, Fani Muhsin, Translated by David Shea, Anthony Troyer, Publisher, M. Walter Dunne, 1901 p. 275-276]&lt;/ref&gt; Its Section 11 is dedicated to Jainism. It states: "Similar to the durvishes of both classes (Srivaras and [[Yati|Jatis]]) is a third sect, called Mahá-átma; they have the dress and appearance of Jatis; only they do not pluck their hair with tweezers, but cut it. They accumulate money, cook their meal in their houses, drink cold water, and take to them a wife." The term Mahatma was thus used for priest/scholars who were not celibate. The present [[Persian language|Persian]] edition of the text by Rezazadeh Malik attributes it to the son and successor of [[Azar Kayvan]], 'Kay Khosrow Esfandiyar'.

==Criticism==
[[K. Paul Johnson]] in his books&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (1994), Johnson (1995) – p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; speculates that the "Masters" that [[Helena Blavatsky|Blavatsky]] wrote about and produced letters from were actually idealizations of people who were her [[mentor]]s. Aryel Sanat,&lt;ref&gt;"Aryel Sanat (Miguel Angel Sanabria) is currently Adjunct Professor in the Department of Philosophy and Religion at the American University in Washington, D.C." // [https://books.google.ru/books?id=0dHP2f_6k4YC&amp;dq=editions:jYIKHxJulMgC&amp;hl=ru&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s About author of ''The inner life of Krishnamurti'' in 1999.]&lt;/ref&gt; author of ''The inner life of Krishnamurti: private passion and perennial wisdom'', wrote that Johnson "claims in all of his books that there were no Masters at all in early [[Theosophical Society|[Theosophical Society]]] history, &amp; that [[Helena Blavatsky|[Helena Blavatsky]]] '''invented''' them (as others had claimed she had invented her travels)." Sanat wrote that Johnson "'''deliberately''' ignores the main sources of evidence for their real physical existence."&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.theos-talk.com/archives/200005/tt00087.html ''Theosophy World.'']&lt;/ref&gt; What Sanat thought these were is not made quite clear.

In [[general relativity]], a '''manifestly covariant''' equation is one in which all expressions are [[tensor]]s.  The operations of addition, [[tensor multiplication]], [[tensor contraction]], [[raising and lowering indices]], and [[covariant differentiation]] may appear in the equation.  Forbidden terms include but are not restricted to [[partial derivatives]].  [[Tensor density|Tensor densities]], especially integrands and variables of integration, may be allowed in manifestly covariant equations if they are clearly weighted by the appropriate power of the [[determinant]] of the metric.  

Writing an equation in manifestly covariant form is useful because it guarantees [[general covariance]] upon quick inspection.  If an equation is manifestly covariant, and if it reduces to a correct, corresponding equation in [[special relativity]] when evaluated instantaneously in a [[local inertial frame]], then it is usually the correct generalization of the special relativistic equation in general relativity.

== Example ==

An equation may be [[Lorentz covariance|Lorentz covariant]] even if it is not manifestly covariant.  Consider the [[electromagnetic field tensor]]

:&lt;math&gt;F_{ab} \, = \, \partial_a A_b \, - \, \partial_b A_a \,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A_a&lt;/math&gt; is the [[electromagnetic four-potential]] in the [[Lorenz gauge]].  The equation above contains partial derivatives and is therefore not manifestly covariant.  Note that the partial derivatives may be written in terms of covariant derivatives and [[Christoffel symbol]]s as

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_a A_b = \nabla_a A_b + \Gamma^c_{ab} A_c&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\partial_b A_a = \nabla_b A_a + \Gamma^c_{ba} A_c&lt;/math&gt;

For a [[Torsion tensor|torsion]]-free metric assumed in general relativity, we may appeal to the symmetry of the Christoffel symbols

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma^c_{ab} - \Gamma^c_{ba} = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

which allows the field tensor to be written in manifestly covariant form

:&lt;math&gt;F_{ab} \, = \, \nabla_a A_b \, - \, \nabla_b A_a .&lt;/math&gt;

'''Metric time''' is the measure of time interval using the [[metric system]], which defines the [[second]] as the base unit of time, and multiple and submultiple units formed with [[metric prefix]]es, such as kiloseconds and milliseconds. It does not define the time of day, as this is defined by various time scales, which may be based upon the metric definition of the second. Other units of time, the [[minute]], [[hour]], and [[day]], are accepted for use with the [[SI|modern metric system]], but are not part of it.

==History==
Although part of the decimal metric system, the second derives its name from the [[sexagesimal]] system, which originated with the [[Sumer|Sumerians]] and [[Babylonia]]ns, and divides a base unit into sixty minutes, minutes into sixty seconds, seconds into sixty [[Sexagesimal#Modern usage|tierces]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://findwords.info/term/tierce|title=What does tierce mean|website=findwords.info|access-date=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; etc.  The word "minute" comes from the Latin ''pars minuta prima'', meaning first small part, and "second" from ''pars minuta secunda'' or second small part.  [[Angular measure]] also uses these sexagesimal units; in that field, it is the [[Degree (angle)|degree]] that is subdivided into minutes and seconds, while in time, it is the hour.

When the metric system was introduced in [[France]] in 1795, it included units for length, area, dry volume, liquid capacity, weight or mass, and even currency, but not for time. [[Decimal time]] of day had been introduced in France two years earlier, but was set aside at the same time the metric system was inaugurated, and did not follow the metric pattern of a base unit and prefixed units. [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and [[Elihu Thomson]] (through the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] - BAAS) introduced the [[Centimetre gram second system of units]] (cgs) in 1874, in order to derive electric and magnetic metric units, following the recommendation of [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] in 1832.

The ephemeris second (defined as 1/86400 of a mean solar day) was made one of the original base units of the modern metric system, or International System of Units ([[SI]]), at the 10th [[Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures|General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (CGPM) in 1954. Because the planet Earth's rotation is [[Leap second|slowly decelerating at an irregular rate]] and was thus unsuitable as a reference point for precise measurements, the SI second was later redefined more precisely as
the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the [[ground state]] of the [[caesium]]-133 atom. The international standard [[atomic clock]]s use caesium-133 measurements as their main benchmark.

==Alternative units==
Numerous proposals have been made for alternative base units of metric time. On March 28, 1794, the president of the commission which developed the [[metric system]], [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]], proposed in a report to the commission the names ''déci-jour'' and ''centi-jour'' ([[deci]]day and [[centi]]day in English).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JlsoAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage#PPA606,M1 Procès-verbaux du Comité d'instruction publique de la Convention nationale by James Guillaume]&lt;/ref&gt; Base units equivalent to decimal divisions of the day, such as 1/10, 1/100, 1/1000, or 1/100,000 day, or other divisions of the day, such as 1/20 or 1/40 day, have also been proposed, with various names, and multiple and submultiple units formed with metric prefixes. Such alternative units have not gained any notable acceptance.

A decimal second = 1/100,000 of a day = 0.864 s is an obvious alternative. Any redefinition of the second, however, creates conflicts with anything based on its precise current definition.

[[Swatch Internet Time]] introduced a time unit called .beat, equal to the French decimal minute, with 1,000 decimal minutes in a day. In the French decimal time system there are 100 decimal seconds in a decimal minute. As there are 100,000 decimal seconds in the day, the decimal second is shorter than its counterpart. See [[Decimal time#Conversions]].

Another unit for time, more familiar than some other suggestions, could be 14.4 minutes, i.e. a shorter ''quarter of an hour'', or a ''centiday'', as proposed by Lagrange. The centiday (called ''[[Traditional Chinese timekeeping|kè]]'' in [[Chinese language|Chinese]]) was used in [[China]] for thousands of years.{{CN|date=December 2018}}

In the 19th century, Joseph Charles François de Rey-Pailhade proposed using the centiday, abbreviated ''cé'', divided into 10 ''decicés'', 100 ''centicés'', 1000 ''millicés''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://heuresdumonde.com/histoire-dheure.html?start=2 Histoire d'heure - Fractionnement du temps] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522083043/http://heuresdumonde.com/histoire-dheure.html?start=2 |date=2015-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 10000 ''dimicés''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FTsCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA189 AJB, Volume 9, 1907]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xMgBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA255 Report of the Sixth International Geographical Congress: Held in London, 1895]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897, the ''Commission de décimalisation du temps'' was created by the French [[Bureau of Longitude]], with the mathematician [[Henri Poincaré]] as secretary. The commission proposed making the standard [[hour]] the base unit of metric time, but the proposal did not gain acceptance and was eventually abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0393326047 Einstein's Clocks, Poincare's Maps: empires of time By Peter Louis Galison]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative meaning==
{{see also|Decimal time}}
Metric time is sometimes used to mean [[decimal time]]. Metric time properly refers to measurement of time interval, while decimal time refers to the time of day. Standard time of day is usually measured by the [[24-hour clock]] or its closely related derivative, the [[12-hour clock]].  These measurement systems are now based on the metric base unit of time, the second. Some proposals for alternative units of metric time are accompanied by decimal time scales for telling the time of day. Other proposals called "metric time" refer only to decimal time and are therefore not truly metric.

[[France|French]] decimal time is sometimes called "metric time" because it was introduced around the same time as the metric system and both were decimal.  The April 7, 1795 decree creating the original metric units and prefixes actually suspended decimal time, which had named its units the (decimal) [[hour]], [[minute]] and [[second]] instead of using metric prefixes.

==In computing==
In computing, at least internally, metric time gained widespread use for ease of computation. [[Unix time]] gives date and time as the number of seconds since January 1, 1970, and Microsoft's FILETIME as multiples of 100ns since January 1, 1601.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms724284.aspx FILETIME documentation on MSDN]&lt;/ref&gt; [[OpenVMS#Timekeeping|VAX/VMS]] uses the number of 100ns since November 17, 1858 and [[RISC OS]] the number of centiseconds since January 1, 1900.

None of these systems is strictly linear, as they each have discontinuities at [[leap second]]s.

==Fractions of a second==
While larger metric prefixes of a second are rarely used, subdivision prefixes are well established within science and technology. Milliseconds, microseconds and smaller units (but not centiseconds) are well established.

==Problems==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}
One problem lies in the size of time units created using metric prefixes. The [[International System of Units]] has developed [[metric prefix|prefixes]] to express units as [[exponentiation|exponential]] multiples or sub-multiples. The first three multiples would be viable for use within a metric time system; they are:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center; margin-left: 2.5%; table-layout: fixed"
! Multiple
! Name of Unit
! Seconds
! Minutes
|-
| 10&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; || decasecond || 10 || 0.166
|-
| 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; || hectosecond || 100 || 1.666
|-
| 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; || kilosecond || 1&amp;nbsp;000 || 16.666
|}

However, the next multiples are:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center; margin-left: 2.5%; table-layout: fixed"
! Multiple !! Name of Unit !! Seconds !! Minutes !! Hours !! Days !! Years
|-
| 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; || megasecond || 1&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;000 || 16&amp;nbsp;666.666 || 277.777 || 11.574 || 0.032
|-
| 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; || gigasecond || 1&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;000 || 16&amp;nbsp;666&amp;nbsp;666.666 || 277&amp;nbsp;777.777 || 11&amp;nbsp;574.074 || 31.688
|}

Such lengths of time are relatively impractical for measuring human activities.

For decimal multiples of the metric time unit to be practical, [[si units|standard units]] and prefixes would need to be developed or revived for the 4th and 5th exponents so that it becomes viable for measuring human life. Historically, the metric system included a ''[[myria-]]'' prefix to represent 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; (and a counterpart ''dimi-'' prefix for 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;), but SI (introduced in 1960) omitted the prefixes and prohibited using multiple prefixes such as decahecto-, a workaround also in use prior to the SI, leaving no way to name those orders of magnitude. 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; was represented using various ''[[ad hoc]]'' solutions; 100 000 [[Metre|meters]] composed a [[Gradian|grade]], 100 000 [[Pascal (unit)|pascals]] composed a [[bar (unit)|bar]], and 100 000 [[dyne]]s composed a [[Newton (unit)|newton]]; most of these conversions stem from compatible units that were used in the SI (and its predecessor, [[MKS system of units|MKS]]) and the [[Centimetre–gram–second system of units|CGS system of units]]. Meteorologists currently use a unit of 100 000 seconds (a quantity on the order of a day) to quantify atmospheric [[vorticity]] at the synoptic scale; the unit, however, does not have a formal name.

The only way to express a nonstandard order of magnitude as an SI unit is to combine two prefixed [[SI derived unit]]s whose component base units cancel out; for example, units of 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; seconds could be expressed as ''[[kilojoule]]s per centiwatt'' (kJ/cW) or ''hectocoulombs per [[milliampere]]'' (hC/mA). Such misuse of SI derived units can create a [[cognitive dissonance]]; to do so requires the invocation of units not directly related to the quantity being measured (coulombs and amperes, for example, quantify electricity, making it awkward to combine the two in a way that creates a unit of time with no electrical component).

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center; margin-left: 2.5%; table-layout: fixed"
! Multiple !! Name of Unit !! Seconds !! Minutes !! Hours !! Days
|-
| 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; || "myriasecond" || 10&amp;nbsp;000 || 166.6 || 2.777 || 0.116
|-
| 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; || ''No formal name'' ||  100&amp;nbsp;000 || 1&amp;nbsp;666.6 || 27.77 || 1.157

'''Moral example''' is trust in the [[moral core]] of another, a [[role model]].  It was cited by [[Confucius]], [[Muhammad]], [[Mohandas Gandhi]] and other important philosophers and theologians as the prime duty of a ruler - including the head of a family or the owner of a business.  

It is the case that since the exact circumstances and decisions of the lives of such moral examples cannot be reproduced or repeated, followers are often reduced to following their [[etiquette]] and customs, e.g. in [[ancestor worship]].

[[Storytelling]] can take a central role in any culture built on moral example, particularly when the provider of the moral example does not refer to an explicit ethical theory or philosophy as the basis for his behavior. A complex culture built on such stories can fall prey to a clique of experts who interpret them for the lay public.  This has led in the past to institutions that sort through anecdotes to decide which of them are true, e.g. [[isnad]] in [[Islam]] by which the [[hadith]] are validated.

[[Christian]]s still see [[Jesus]] as the ultimate [[divine]] example- in [[Epistle to the Hebrews]]: "looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith" (12:2).

The ''z''-axis is vertical, and the foci are at&amp;nbsp;±2.  The red oblate spheroid (flattened sphere) corresponds to ''μ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, whereas the blue half-hyperboloid corresponds to ''ν''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;45°.  The azimuth ''φ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−60° measures the [[dihedral angle]] between the green ''x''-''z'' half-plane and the yellow half-plane that includes the point&amp;nbsp;'''P'''.  The [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] of '''P''' are roughly (1.09,&amp;nbsp;−1.89,&amp;nbsp;1.66).]]

'''Oblate spheroidal coordinates''' are a three-dimensional [[orthogonal coordinates|orthogonal]] [[coordinate system]] that results from rotating the two-dimensional [[elliptic coordinates|elliptic coordinate system]] about the non-focal axis of the ellipse, i.e., the symmetry axis that separates the foci. Thus, the two foci are transformed into a ring of radius &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; in the ''x''-''y'' plane.  (Rotation about the other axis produces [[prolate spheroidal coordinates]].)  Oblate spheroidal coordinates can also be considered as a [[limiting case (mathematics)|limiting case]] of [[ellipsoidal coordinates]] in which the two largest [[semi-axis|semi-axes]] are equal in length.

Oblate spheroidal coordinates are often useful in solving [[partial differential equation]]s when the boundary conditions are defined on an [[oblate spheroid]] or a [[hyperboloid|hyperboloid of revolution]].  For example, they played an important role in the calculation of the [[Perrin friction factors]], which contributed to the awarding of the 1926 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] to [[Jean Baptiste Perrin]].  These friction factors determine the [[rotational diffusion]] of molecules, which affects the feasibility of many techniques such as [[protein NMR]] and from which the hydrodynamic volume and shape of molecules can be inferred.  Oblate spheroidal coordinates are also useful in problems of electromagnetism (e.g., dielectric constant of charged oblate molecules), acoustics (e.g., scattering of sound through a circular hole), fluid dynamics  (e.g., the flow of water through a firehose nozzle) and the diffusion of materials and heat (e.g., cooling of a red-hot coin in a water bath)

==Definition (µ,ν,φ)==
[[File:OblateSpheroidCoord.png|thumb|350 px|right|Figure 2: Plot of the oblate spheroidal coordinates &amp;mu; and &amp;nu; in the ''x''-''z'' plane, where φ is zero and ''a'' equals one. The curves of constant ''&amp;mu;'' form red ellipses, whereas those of constant ''&amp;nu;'' form cyan half-hyperbolae in this plane. The ''z''-axis runs vertically and separates the foci; the coordinates ''z'' and ν always have the same sign. The surfaces of constant &amp;mu; and &amp;nu; in three dimensions are obtained by rotation about the ''z''-axis, and are the red and blue surfaces, respectively, in Figure 1.]]
The most common definition of oblate spheroidal coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\mu, \nu, \varphi)&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;
x = a \ \cosh \mu \ \cos \nu \ \cos \varphi
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
y = a \ \cosh \mu \ \cos \nu \ \sin \varphi
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
z = a \ \sinh \mu \ \sin \nu 
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is a nonnegative real number and the angle &lt;math&gt;\nu\in\left[-\pi/2,\pi/2\right]&lt;/math&gt;.  The azimuthal angle &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; can fall anywhere on a full circle, between &lt;math&gt;\pm\pi&lt;/math&gt;.  These coordinates are favored over the alternatives below because they are not degenerate; the set of coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\mu, \nu, \varphi)&lt;/math&gt; describes a unique point in Cartesian coordinates &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt;. The reverse is also true, except on the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-axis and the disk in the &lt;math&gt;xy&lt;/math&gt; plane inside the focal ring.

===Coordinate surfaces===

The surfaces of constant μ form [[Oblate spheroid|oblate]] [[spheroids]], by the trigonometric identity

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{x^{2} + y^{2}}{a^{2} \cosh^{2} \mu} + 
\frac{z^{2}}{a^{2} \sinh^{2} \mu} = \cos^{2} \nu + \sin^{2} \nu = 1
&lt;/math&gt;

since they are [[ellipse]]s rotated about the ''z''-axis, which separates their foci.   An ellipse in the ''x''-''z'' plane (Figure 2) has a [[semi-major axis|major semiaxis]] of length ''a'' cosh μ along the ''x''-axis, whereas its [[semi-minor axis|minor semiaxis]] has length ''a'' sinh μ along the ''z''-axis.  The foci of all the ellipses in the ''x''-''z'' plane are located on the ''x''-axis at ±''a''.

Similarly, the surfaces of constant ν form one-sheet half [[hyperboloid]]s of revolution by the hyperbolic trigonometric identity

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{x^{2} + y^{2}}{a^{2} \cos^{2} \nu} - 
\frac{z^{2}}{a^{2} \sin^{2} \nu} = \cosh^{2} \mu - \sinh^{2} \mu = 1
&lt;/math&gt;

For positive ν, the half-hyperboloid is above the ''x''-''y'' plane (i.e., has positive ''z'') whereas for negative ν, the half-hyperboloid is below the ''x''-''y'' plane (i.e., has negative ''z'').  Geometrically, the angle ν corresponds to the angle of the [[asymptote]]s of the hyperbola.  The foci of all the hyperbolae are likewise located on the ''x''-axis at ±''a''.

===Inverse transformation===

The (μ, ν, φ) coordinates may be calculated from the Cartesian coordinates (''x'', ''y'', ''z'') as follows.  The azimuthal angle φ is given by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;
\tan \phi = \frac{y}{x}
&lt;/math&gt;

The cylindrical radius ρ of the point P is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\rho^{2} = x^{2} + y^{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

and its distances to the foci in the plane defined by φ is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
d_{1}^{2} = (\rho + a)^{2} + z^{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
d_{2}^{2} = (\rho - a)^{2} + z^{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

The remaining coordinates μ and ν can be calculated from the equations

:&lt;math&gt;
\cosh \mu = \frac{d_{1} + d_{2}}{2a}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\cos \nu = \frac{d_{1} - d_{2}}{2a}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the sign of μ is always non-negative, and the sign of ν is the same as that of ''z''.

Another method to compute the inverse transform is

:&lt;math&gt;
\mu = \operatorname{Re} \operatorname{arcosh} \frac{\rho + z i}{a}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\nu = \operatorname{Im} \operatorname{arcosh} \frac{\rho + z i}{a}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\phi = \arctan \frac{y}{x}
&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;
\rho = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Scale factors===

The scale factors for the coordinates μ and ν are equal

:&lt;math&gt;
h_{\mu} = h_{\nu} = a\sqrt{\sinh^{2}\mu + \sin^{2}\nu}
&lt;/math&gt;

whereas the azimuthal scale factor equals

:&lt;math&gt;
h_{\phi} = a \cosh\mu \ \cos\nu
&lt;/math&gt;

Consequently, an infinitesimal volume element equals

:&lt;math&gt;
dV = a^{3} \cosh\mu \ \cos\nu \ 
\left( \sinh^{2}\mu + \sin^{2}\nu \right) d\mu d\nu d\phi
&lt;/math&gt;

and the Laplacian can be written

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla^{2} \Phi = 
\frac{1}{a^{2} \left( \sinh^{2}\mu + \sin^{2}\nu \right)} 
\left[
\frac{1}{\cosh \mu} \frac{\partial}{\partial \mu} 
\left( \cosh \mu \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \mu} \right) + 
\frac{1}{\cos \nu} \frac{\partial}{\partial \nu}
\left( \cos \nu \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \nu} \right)
\right] +
\frac{1}{a^{2} \cosh^{2}\mu \cos^{2}\nu}
\frac{\partial^{2} \Phi}{\partial \phi^{2}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Other differential operators such as &lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in the coordinates (μ, ν, φ) by substituting the scale factors into the general formulae found in [[orthogonal coordinates]].

===Basis Vectors===

The orthonormal basis vectors for the &lt;math&gt;\mu,\nu,\phi&lt;/math&gt; coordinate system can be expressed in Cartesian coordinates as

:&lt;math&gt;
\hat{e}_{\mu} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\sinh^2 \mu + \sin^2 \nu}}
\left( \sinh \mu \cos \nu \cos \phi \boldsymbol{\hat{i}} + \sinh \mu \cos \nu \sin \phi \boldsymbol{\hat{j}} + \cosh \mu \sin \nu \boldsymbol{\hat{k}}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\hat{e}_{\nu} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\sinh^2 \mu + \sin^2 \nu}}
\left(
-\cosh \mu \sin \nu \cos \phi \boldsymbol{\hat{i}} - \cosh \mu \sin \nu \sin \phi \boldsymbol{\hat{j}} + \sinh \mu \cos \nu \boldsymbol{\hat{k}}
\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\hat{e}_{\phi} = -\sin \phi \boldsymbol{\hat{i}} + \cos \phi \boldsymbol{\hat{j}}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\hat{i}}, \boldsymbol{\hat{j}}, \boldsymbol{\hat{k}}&lt;/math&gt; are the Cartesian unit vectors. Here, &lt;math&gt;\hat{e}_{\mu}&lt;/math&gt; is the outward normal vector to the oblate spheroidal surface of constant &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\hat{e}_{\phi}&lt;/math&gt; is the same azimuthal unit vector from spherical coordinates, and &lt;math&gt;\hat{e}_{\nu}&lt;/math&gt; lies in the tangent plane to the oblate spheroid surface and completes the right-handed basis set.

==Definition (ζ, ξ, φ)==

Another set of oblate spheroidal coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\zeta,\xi,\phi)&lt;/math&gt; are sometimes used where &lt;math&gt;\zeta = \sinh \mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\xi = \sin \nu&lt;/math&gt; (Smythe 1968).  The curves of constant &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt; are oblate spheroids and the curves of constant &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; are the hyperboloids of revolution. The coordinate &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt; is restricted by &lt;math&gt;0 \le \zeta &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; is restricted by &lt;math&gt;-1 \le \xi &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;.

The relationship to [[Cartesian coordinates]] is

:&lt;math&gt;x = a\sqrt{(1+\zeta^2)(1-\xi^2)}\,\cos \phi&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;y = a\sqrt{(1+\zeta^2)(1-\xi^2)}\,\sin \phi&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;z  = a \zeta \xi&lt;/math&gt;

===Scale factors===

The scale factors for &lt;math&gt;(\zeta, \xi, \phi)&lt;/math&gt; are:

:&lt;math&gt;
h_{\zeta} = a\sqrt{\frac{\zeta^2 + \xi^2}{1+\zeta^2}}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
h_{\xi} = a\sqrt{\frac{\zeta^2 + \xi^2}{1 - \xi^2}}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
h_{\phi} = a\sqrt{(1+\zeta^2)(1 - \xi^2)}
&lt;/math&gt;

Knowing the scale factors, various functions of the coordinates can be calculated by the general method outlined in the [[orthogonal coordinates]] article. The infinitesimal volume element is:

:&lt;math&gt;
dV = a^{3} (\zeta^2+\xi^2)\,d\zeta\,d\xi\,d\phi
&lt;/math&gt;

The gradient is:
:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla V = 
\frac{1}{h_{\zeta}} \frac{\partial V}{\partial \zeta} \,\hat{\zeta}+
\frac{1}  {h_{\xi}} \frac{\partial V}{\partial \xi}   \,\hat{\xi}+
\frac{1} {h_{\phi}} \frac{\partial V}{\partial \phi}  \,\hat{\phi}
&lt;/math&gt;

The divergence is:

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} = \frac{1}{a(\zeta^2+\xi^2)}
\left\{
\frac{\partial}{\partial \zeta} \left(\sqrt{1+\zeta^2}\sqrt{\zeta^2+\xi^2}F_\zeta\right)        +
\frac{\partial}  {\partial \xi} \left(\sqrt{1-\xi^2}\sqrt{\zeta^2+\xi^2}F_\xi\right)
\right\}
+\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\zeta^2}\sqrt{1-\xi^2}} \frac{\partial F_\phi}{\partial \phi}
&lt;/math&gt;

and the Laplacian equals

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla^{2} V = 
\frac{1}{a^2 \left( \zeta^2 + \xi^2 \right)}
\left\{
\frac{\partial}{\partial \zeta} \left[ 
\left(1+\zeta^2\right) \frac{\partial V}{\partial \zeta}
\right] + 
\frac{\partial}{\partial \xi} \left[ 
\left( 1 - \xi^2 \right) \frac{\partial V}{\partial \xi}
\right]
\right\}
+ \frac{1}{a^2 \left( 1+\zeta^2 \right) \left( 1 - \xi^{2} \right)}
\frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial \phi^{2}}
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Oblate spheroidal harmonics ===

: ''See also [[Oblate spheroidal wave function]].''

As is the case with [[spherical coordinates]] and [[spherical harmonics]], Laplace's equation may be solved by the method of [[separation of variables]] to yield solutions in the form of '''oblate spheroidal harmonics''', which are convenient to use when boundary conditions are defined on a surface with a constant oblate spheroidal coordinate.

Following the technique of [[separation of variables]], a solution to Laplace's equation is written:

:&lt;math&gt;V=Z(\zeta)\,\Xi(\xi)\,\Phi(\phi)&lt;/math&gt;

This yields three separate differential equations in each of the variables:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{d\zeta}\left[(1+\zeta^2)\frac{dZ  }{d\zeta}\right]+\frac{m^2Z  }{1+\zeta^2}-n(n+1)Z  =0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{d\xi  }\left[(1-\xi^2  )\frac{d\Xi}{d\xi  }\right]-\frac{m^2\Xi}{1-\xi^2  }+n(n+1)\Xi=0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2\Phi}{d\phi^2}=-m^2\Phi&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is a constant which is an integer because the &amp;phi; variable is periodic with period 2&amp;pi;. ''n'' will then be an integer. The solution to these equations are:

:&lt;math&gt;Z_{mn}   =A_1P_n^m(i\zeta)+A_2Q_n^m(i\zeta)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Xi_{mn} =A_3P_n^m(\xi)+A_4Q_n^m(\xi)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_m   =A_5e^{im\phi}+A_6e^{-im\phi}&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; are constants and &lt;math&gt;P_n^m(z)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q_n^m(z)&lt;/math&gt; are [[associated Legendre polynomial]]s of the first and second kind respectively. The product of the three solutions is called an ''oblate spheroidal harmonic'' and the general solution to Laplace's equation is written:

:&lt;math&gt;V=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\sum_{m=0}^\infty\,Z_{mn}(\zeta)\,\Xi_{mn}(\xi)\,\Phi_m(\phi)&lt;/math&gt;

The constants will combine to yield only four independent constants for each harmonic.

==Definition (σ, τ, φ)==

[[File:Oblate spheroidal coordinates full hyperboloid.png|thumb|right|350px|Figure 3: Coordinate isosurfaces for a point P (shown as a black sphere) in the alternative oblate spheroidal coordinates (σ, τ, φ). As before, the oblate spheroid corresponding to σ is shown in red, and φ measures the azimuthal angle between the green and yellow half-planes. However, the surface of constant τ is a full one-sheet hyperboloid, shown in blue. This produces a two-fold degeneracy, shown by the two black spheres located at (''x'', ''y'', ±''z'').]]

An alternative and geometrically intuitive set of oblate spheroidal coordinates (σ, τ, φ) are sometimes used, where σ = [[Cosh (mathematical function)|cosh]] μ and τ = [[cosine|cos]] ν.&lt;ref&gt;Abramowitz and Stegun, p. 752.&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, the coordinate σ must be greater than or equal to one, whereas τ must lie between ±1, inclusive.  The surfaces of constant σ are oblate spheroids, as were those of constant μ, whereas the curves of constant τ are full hyperboloids of revolution, including the half-hyperboloids corresponding to ±ν.  Thus, these coordinates are degenerate; ''two'' points in Cartesian coordinates (''x'', ''y'', ±''z'') map to ''one'' set of coordinates (σ, τ, φ).  This two-fold degeneracy in the sign of ''z'' is evident from the equations transforming from oblate spheroidal coordinates to the [[Cartesian coordinates]]

:&lt;math&gt;
x = a\sigma\tau \cos \phi
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
y = a\sigma\tau \sin \phi
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
z^{2}  = a^{2} \left( \sigma^{2} - 1 \right) \left(1 - \tau^{2} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

The coordinates &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; have a simple relation to the distances to the focal ring.  For any point, the ''sum'' &lt;math&gt;d_{1}+d_{2}&lt;/math&gt; of its distances to the focal ring equals &lt;math&gt;2a\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, whereas their ''difference'' &lt;math&gt;d_{1}-d_{2}&lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;2a\tau&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, the "far" distance to the focal ring is &lt;math&gt;a(\sigma+\tau)&lt;/math&gt;, whereas the "near" distance is &lt;math&gt;a(\sigma-\tau)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Coordinate surfaces===

Similar to its counterpart μ, the surfaces of constant σ form [[Oblate spheroid|oblate]] [[spheroids]]

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{x^{2} + y^{2}}{a^{2} \sigma^{2}} + 
\frac{z^{2}}{a^{2} \left(\sigma^{2} -1\right)} = 1
&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, the surfaces of constant τ form full one-sheet [[hyperboloid]]s of revolution

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{x^{2} + y^{2}}{a^{2} \tau^{2}} - 
\frac{z^{2}}{a^{2} \left( 1 - \tau^{2} \right)} = 1
&lt;/math&gt;

===Scale factors===

The scale factors for the alternative oblate spheroidal coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\sigma, \tau, \phi)&lt;/math&gt; are

:&lt;math&gt;
h_\sigma = a\sqrt{\frac{\sigma^2 - \tau^2}{\sigma^2 - 1}}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
h_\tau = a\sqrt{\frac{\sigma^2 - \tau^2}{1 - \tau^{2}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

whereas the azimuthal scale factor is &lt;math&gt;h_{\phi} = a \sigma \tau&lt;/math&gt;.

Hence, the infinitesimal volume element can be written

:&lt;math&gt;
dV = a^3 \sigma \tau \frac{\sigma^2 - \tau^2}{\sqrt{\left( \sigma^2 - 1 \right) \left( 1 - \tau^2 \right)}} \, d\sigma \, d\tau \, d\phi
&lt;/math&gt;

and the Laplacian equals

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla^2 \Phi = 
\frac{1}{a^2 \left( \sigma^2 - \tau^2 \right)}
\left\{
\frac{\sqrt{\sigma^2 -1}}{\sigma}
\frac{\partial}{\partial \sigma} \left[ 
\left( \sigma\sqrt{\sigma^2 - 1} \right) \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \sigma}
\right] + 
\frac{\sqrt{1 - \tau^2}}{\tau}
\frac{\partial}{\partial \tau} \left[ 
\left( \tau\sqrt{1 - \tau^2} \right) \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \tau}
\right]
\right\}
+ \frac{1}{a^2 \sigma^2 \tau^2 }
\frac{\partial^2 \Phi}{\partial \phi^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

Other differential operators such as &lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in the coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\sigma, \tau)&lt;/math&gt; by substituting  the scale factors into the general formulae  found in [[orthogonal coordinates]].

As is the case with [[spherical coordinates]], Laplaces equation may be solved by the method of [[separation of variables]] to yield solutions in the form of '''oblate spheroidal harmonics''', which are convenient to use when boundary conditions are defined on a surface with a constant oblate spheroidal coordinate (See Smythe, 1968).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4216">In [[mathematical logic]], '''positive set theory''' is the name for a class of alternative [[set theory|set theories]] in which the [[axiom of comprehension]]

*"&lt;math&gt;\{x \mid \phi\}&lt;/math&gt; exists"

holds for at least the '''positive formulas''' &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; (the smallest class of formulas containing atomic membership and equality formulas and closed under conjunction, disjunction, existential and universal quantification).

Typically, the motivation for these theories is topological:  the sets are the classes which are closed under a certain [[topology]].  The closure conditions for the various constructions allowed in building positive formulas are readily motivated (and one can further justify the use of universal quantifiers bounded in sets to get '''generalized positive comprehension'''):  the justification of the existential quantifier seems to require that the topology be [[compact spaces|compact]].

The set theory &lt;math&gt;GPK^+_{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; of Olivier Esser consists of the following axioms:

* The [[axiom of extensionality]]: &lt;math&gt;x=y \Leftrightarrow\forall a\, (a\in x \Leftrightarrow a\in y)&lt;/math&gt;.
* The [[axiom of empty set]]: there exists a set &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\,\neg \exists x\; x\in\emptyset\,&lt;/math&gt; (this axiom can be neatly dispensed with if a false formula &lt;math&gt;\perp&lt;/math&gt; is included as a positive formula).
* The axiom of generalized positive [[axiom of comprehension|comprehension]]: if &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is a formula in predicate logic using only &lt;math&gt;\vee&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt;, then the set of all &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; is also a set. Quantification (&lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt;) may be bounded.
** Note that negation is specifically not permitted.
* The axiom of [[topological closure|closure]]: for every formula &lt;math&gt;\phi(x)&lt;/math&gt;, a set exists which is the intersection of all sets which contain every ''x'' such that &lt;math&gt;\phi(x)&lt;/math&gt;; this is called the '''closure of &lt;math&gt;\{x \mid \phi(x)\}&lt;/math&gt;''' and is written in any of the various ways that topological closures can be presented.  This can be put more briefly if class language is allowed (any condition on sets defining a class as in [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory|NBG]]):  for any class ''C'' there is a set which is the intersection of all sets which contain ''C'' as a subclass.  This is obviously a reasonable principle if the sets are understood as closed classes in a topology.
* The [[axiom of infinity]]: the [[von Neumann]] [[ordinal number|ordinal]] &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; exists.  This is not an axiom of infinity in the usual sense; if Infinity does not hold, the closure of &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; exists  and has itself as its sole additional member (it is certainly infinite); the point of this axiom is that &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; contains no additional elements at all, which boosts the theory from the strength of second order arithmetic to the strength of [[Morse–Kelley set theory]] with the proper class ordinal a [[weakly compact cardinal]].

== Interesting properties ==

* The [[universal set]] is a proper set in this theory.
* The sets of this theory are the collections of sets which are closed under a certain [[topology]] on the classes.
* The theory can interpret [[ZFC]] (by restricting oneself to the class of well-founded sets, which is not itself a set).  It in fact interprets a stronger theory ([[Morse–Kelley set theory]] with the proper class ordinal a [[weakly compact cardinal]]).
&lt;!--* ... many more --&gt;

== Researchers ==

* [[Isaac Malitz]] originally introduced Positive Set Theory in his 1976 PhD Thesis at UCLA
* [[Alonzo Church]] was the chairman of the committee supervising the aforementioned thesis
* [[Olivier Esser]] seems to be the most active in this field.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5160">In [[physics]] and [[mathematics]], a '''pseudotensor''' is usually a quantity that transforms like a [[tensor]] under an orientation-preserving [[coordinate transformation]], ''e.g.'' a [[proper rotation]], but additionally changes sign under an orientation reversing coordinate transformation, ''e.g.'', an [[improper rotation]], that is a transformation expressed as a proper rotation followed by [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]]. This is a generalization of a [[pseudovector]].

There is a second meaning for '''pseudotensor''', restricted to [[general relativity]]. Tensors obey strict transformation laws, but pseudotensors are not so constrained. Consequently, the form of a pseudotensor will, in general, change as the [[frame of reference]] is altered. An equation containing pseudotensors which holds in one frame will not necessarily hold in a different frame. This makes pseudotensors of limited relevance because equations in which they appear are not [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|invariant]] in form.

==Definition==
Two quite different mathematical objects are called a pseudotensor in different contexts. 

The first context is essentially a tensor multiplied by an extra sign factor, such that the pseudotensor changes sign under reflections when a normal tensor does not. According to one definition, a pseudotensor '''P''' of the type {{nowrap|(''p'', ''q'')}} is a geometric object whose components in an arbitrary basis are enumerated by {{nowrap|(''p'' + ''q'')}} indices and obey the transformation rule
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{P}^{i_1\ldots i_q}_{\,j_1\ldots j_p} =
(-1)^A A^{i_1} {}_{k_1}\cdots A^{i_q} {}_{k_q}
B^{l_1} {}_{j_1}\cdots B^{l_p} {}_{j_p}
P^{k_1\ldots k_q}_{l_1\ldots l_p}&lt;/math&gt; 
under a change of basis.&lt;ref&gt;Sharipov, R.A. (1996). Course of Differential Geometry, Ufa:Bashkir State University, Russia, p. 34, eq. 6.15. {{ISBN|5-7477-0129-0}}, {{arxiv|math/0412421v1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawden, Derek F. (1982). An Introduction to Tensor Calculus, Relativity and Cosmology. Chichester:John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd., p. 29, eq. 13.1. {{ISBN|0-471-10082-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borisenko, A. I. and Tarapov, I. E. (1968). Vector and Tensor Analysis with Applications, New York:Dover Publications, Inc., p. 124, eq. 3.34. {{ISBN|0-486-63833-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;\hat{P}^{i_1\ldots i_q}_{\,j_1\ldots j_p}, P^{k_1\ldots k_q}_{l_1\ldots l_p}&lt;/math&gt; are the components of the pseudotensor in the new and old bases, respectively, &lt;math&gt;A^{i_q} {}_{k_q}&lt;/math&gt; is the transition matrix for the [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant]] indices, &lt;math&gt;B^{l_p} {}_{j_p}&lt;/math&gt; is the transition matrix for the [[Covariance|covariant]] indices, and &lt;math&gt; (-1)^A = \mathrm{sign}(\det(A^{i_q} {}_{k_q})) = \pm{1}&lt;/math&gt;.
This transformation rule differs from the rule for an ordinary tensor only by the presence of the factor (−1)&lt;sup&gt;''A''&lt;/sup&gt;.

The second context where the word "pseudotensor" is used is [[general relativity]]. In that theory, one cannot describe the energy and momentum of the gravitational field by an energy–momentum tensor. Instead, one introduces objects that behave as tensors only with respect to restricted coordinate transformations. Strictly speaking, such objects are not tensors at all. A famous example of such a pseudotensor is the [[Landau–Lifshitz pseudotensor]].

==Examples==
On [[orientable manifold|non-orientable manifolds]], one cannot define a [[volume form]] globally due to the non-orientability, but one can define a [[volume element]], which is formally a [[density on a manifold|density]], and may also be called a ''pseudo-volume form'', due to the additional sign twist (tensoring with the sign bundle).  The volume element is a pseudotensor density according to the first definition.

A [[Integration by substitution|change of variable]]s in multi-dimensional integration may be achieved through the incorporation of a factor of the absolute value of the [[determinant]] of the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian matrix]].  The use of the absolute value introduces a sign change for improper coordinate transformations to compensate for the convention of keeping integration (volume) element positive; as such, an [[integrand]] is an example of a pseudotensor density according to the first definition.

The [[Christoffel symbols]] of an [[affine connection]] on a manifold can be thought of as the correction terms to the partial derivatives of a coordinate expression of a vector field with respect to the coordinates to renders the vector field's covariant derivative.  While the affine connection itself doesn't depend on the choice of coordinates, its Christoffel symbols do, making them a pseudotensor quantity according to the second definition.

'''Random Acts of Kindness Day''' is a day to celebrate and encourage [[random acts of kindness]]. "It's just a day to celebrate kindness and the whole [[pay it forward]] mentality", said Tracy Van Kalsbeek, executive director of the Stratford Perth Community Foundation, in 2016, where the day is celebrated on November 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Beitz, Mike |publisher=The Beacon Herald|url=http://www.stratfordbeaconherald.com/2016/10/21/stratford-and-area-set-to-celebrate-random-acts-of-kindness-day |title=Stratford and area set to celebrate Random Acts of Kindness Day |accessdate=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is celebrated on September 1 in New Zealand and on February 17 in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cain, Brenda Cain |publisher=cleveland.com|url=http://www.cleveland.com/best/2016/02/feb_17_is_random_acts_of_kindn.html |title=Today is Random Acts of Kindness Day; nominate someone for February Person of the Month |accessdate=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Random Acts of Kindness Foundation|url=https://www.randomactsofkindness.org/ |title=Random Acts of Kindness Day |accessdate=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.azcentral.com/story/inside-12/2015/02/16/12-news-12-random-acts-of-kindness/23523321/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7601">'''Reginald Hawkins''' (1923–2007) was a civil rights activist in [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], NC for most of his life. He was the first African-American to run for Governor of North Carolina. He fought to desegregate Charlotte schools and businesses. His son-in-law was [[Hamaas Abdul Khaalis]] whose [[1973 Hanafi Muslim massacre|family was murdered in 1973]] and who went on to commit the [[1977 Hanafi Siege]].

Reginald Hawkins was born in [[Beaufort, North Carolina|Beaufort, NC]] in 1923. He served as captain in the [[United States Army|US Army]] during [[World War II]]. After completing his time in the service he attended [[Howard University]] where he got his degree in dentistry in 1948. He also received his MA of Divinity from [[Johnson C. Smith University|Johnson C Smith University]] in 1973. He married Catherine Richardson while he was still in dental school and they had four children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/charlotte/obituary.aspx?n=reginald-armistice-hawkins&amp;pid=94263646|title=Dr. Reginald Armistice Hawkins's Obituary on Charlotte Observer|website=Charlotte Observer|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil rights advocacy==
Hawkins and members of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] differed over the best way to end school desegregation. Kelly Alexander wanted to sue the city of Charlotte over civil injustice. Hawkins believed that a confrontational approach was best through utilizing media coverage to help mobilize citizens, arguing  "The only way to move forward is to engage bigots in direct controversy within their own community.&lt;ref name="jfl"&gt;{{cite web|title=Reginald Hawkins (1923-2007)|url=http://northcarolinahistory.org/encyclopedia/reginald-hawkins-1923-2007/|website=North Carolina History Project|publisher=The John Locke Foundation|accessdate=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to make his point  about the only way to move forward, Hawkins escorted Dorthy Counts, a young black girl to Harding High School, a white school in Charlotte. On September 4, 1957 Hawkins and Counts walked through a shower of spit and insults to integrate the first Mecklenburg County School.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://clclt.com/charlotte/the-militant-dentist-dr-reginald-hawkins/Content?oid=3003665|title=The Militant Dentist: Dr. Reginald Hawkins|last=Wright|first=Emiene|website=Creative Loafing Charlotte|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His actions that day created a lot of stir in both the white and African- American neighborhoods,creating  a national name for Hawkins. From then on Hawkins became a prominent civil rights activist in Charlotte. In 1961 Hawkins  led a [[boycott]] of Irwin Avenue Junior High School. He urged African-American Students to stay home instead of attending a second rate educational institution.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Due to his disagreement with NAACP policies and in an attempt to distance himself from their "communist" label, Hawkins resigned his membership in 1958 and created the Mecklenburg Organization for Political Affairs (MOPA). MOPA used community activists within the African -American community to call for desegregation. Members took part in marches, picketing, protests, boycotts, and sit-in's, usually near schools or hospitals in the Charlotte area.Hawkins work helped successfully integrate many restaurants downtown including those in Belk's and Ivey's department stores.&lt;ref name="jfl" /&gt;

In 1962 Hawkins filed suit against the North Carolina Dental Society for discrimination due to the fact they would not let him practice at [[Charlotte Memorial Hospital]]. He frequently led demonstrations outside the Mercy, Charlotte Memorial , Presbyterian and Good Samaritan hospitals in the Charlotte area. These demonstrations usually attracted a lot of press and generated controversy in the medical community. Hawkins continued to protest by writing [[Attorney general|Attorney General]] [[Robert F. Kennedy|Robert Kennedy]] claiming that the hospitals were breaking their nondiscrimination policy that was one of the conditions of them receiving federal funding. By the end of 1962 the [[Department of Health]] ordered Memorial to desegregate their maternity and dentistry wards. Hawkins continued to protest until 1963 when the hospital declared an open door policy for all patients.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On November 22, 1965 four bombs exploded across Charlotte in the span of about 15 minutes. Hawkins home was hit as well as the homes of [[Kelly Alexander Sr]], president of the NAACP, [[Frederick D Alexander|Fred Alexander]], first African American City Council man, and [[Julius L. Chambers|Julius Chambers]], a civil rights lawyer. The bombings caught the attention of the local news and put Charlotte into the violent category that cities like [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] and [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]] had already been placed in. No one was ever arrested for the bombings even though there was a state wide man hunt and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] still holds an open file on the event. Many people believe the bombings were resistance to efforts of desegregation that all four men were part of.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/article45744905.html|title=50 years ago: Bombs ignited night of terror|newspaper=charlotteobserver|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also helped organize the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]] and was a great friend to [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]&lt;ref name="jfl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jstor"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Richardson|first1=Michael B.|title="Not Gradually... But Now": Reginald Hawkins, Black Leadership, and Desegregation in Charlotte, North Carolina|jstor=23523030|publisher=North Carolina Office of Arcives and History}}&lt;/ref&gt; King was originally scheduled to stop in Charlotte and speak at one of Hawkins campaign events, but changed his plans and went to Memphis instead, where he was assassinated only a few days later.

==Politics==
In 1968 Hawkins announced his campaign for governor of North Carolina. His political actions had earned him many friends but also many enemies. He lost the Democratic primary to [[Robert W. Scott]] in a three-way race, earning 18.52% of the vote; Scott went on to win the election. He ran again governor again in 1972 and lost in the Democratic primary, winning 8.16% of the vote in a six-way race; the winner of the primary, [[Skipper Bowles]], lost in the general election to Republican candidate [[James Holshouser]]. Even though he did not win, Hawkins' campaigns were symbolically important, showing that African-Americans did have the ability to run for office and try to make political changes.

Throughout his life Hawkins was an ardent supporter of equal rights and integration. He continued his work, giving speeches and calling for change right up until his death in 2007.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18640">'''Relational frame theory''' ('''RFT''') is a [[psychological]] theory of human [[language]]. It was developed originally by [[Steven C. Hayes]] of [[University of Nevada, Reno]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayes|first=Steven|chapter=A relational control theory of stimulus equivalence.|editors= L. J. Hayes &amp; P. N. Chase|year=1991|title=Dialogues on verbal behavior |pages=19–40|publisher=Context Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been extended in research notably by  [[Dermot Barnes-Holmes]] of [[Ghent University]].{{When|date=January 2017}}

Relational frame theory argues that the building block of human language and higher [[cognition]] is relating, i.e. the human ability to create bidirectional links between things. It can be contrasted with [[associative learning]], which discusses how animals form links between stimuli in the form of the strength of associations in memory. However, relational frame theory argues that natural human language typically specifies not just the strength of a link between stimuli but also the type of relation as well as the dimension along which they are to be related. For example, a tennis ball is not just associated with an orange, but can be said to be the same shape, but a different colour and not edible. In the preceding sentence, 'same', 'different' and 'not' are cues in the environment that specify the type of relation between the stimuli, and 'shape', 'colour' and 'edible' specify the dimension along which each relation is to be made. Relational frame theory argues that while there are an arbitrary number of types of relations and number of dimensions along which stimuli can be related, the core unit of relating is an essential building block for much of what is commonly referred to as human language or higher cognition.

Several hundred studies have explored many testable aspects and implications of the theory&lt;ref name="O'Connor2017"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=O'Connor, M.; Farrell, L.; Munnelly, A. &amp; McHugh, L.|year=2017 |title=Citation analysis of relational frame theory: 2009–2016|journal=Journal of Contextual Behavioral Science|volume=6|pages=152–158|doi=10.1016/j.jcbs.2017.04.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the emergence of specific frames{{clarify|date=January 2018}} in childhood,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McHugh|first=Louise|author2=Barnes-Holmes|author3=Barnes-Holmes|displayauthors=1|title=Perspective-taking as relational responding: A developmental profile|journal=The Psychological Record|year=2004|url=http://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/tpr/vol54/iss1/8}}&lt;/ref&gt; how individual frames can be combined to create verbally complex phenomena such as metaphors and analogies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Ian|last2=Barnes-Holmes|first2=Dermot|title=Understanding metaphor: a relational frame perspective|journal=Behaviour Analysis|year=2001|pmc=2731509|pmid=22478364|volume=24|issue=2|pages=191–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and how the rigidity or automaticity of relating within certain domains is related to [[psychopathology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nicholson|first=Emma|author2=Barnes-Holmes |title=Developing an implicit measure of disgust propensity and disgust sensitivity: examining the role of implicit disgust propensity and sensitivity in obsessive-compulsive tendencies|pmid=22387628|journal=Journal of Behaviour Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry|year=2012|doi=10.1016/j.jbtep.2012.02.001|volume=43|pages=922–930}}&lt;/ref&gt; In attempting to describe a fundamental building block of human language and higher cognition, RFT explicitly states that its goal is to provide a general theory of psychology that can provide a bedrock for multiple domains and levels of analysis.

Relational frame theory focuses on how humans learn language (i.e., communication) through interactions with the environment and is based on a philosophical approach referred to as [[functional contextualism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayes|first=Steven C.|last2=Brownstein|first2=Aaron J.|date=1986-01-01|title=Mentalism, behavior-behavior relations, and a behavior-analytic view of the purposes of science|journal=The Behavior Analyst|volume=9|issue=2|pages=175–190|issn=0738-6729| pmc=2741891|pmid=22478660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
RFT is a [[behaviorism|behavioral]] account of language and higher cognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Blackledge, J.T.|year=2003|title=An Introduction to Relational Frame Theory: Basics and Applications|journal=The Behavior Analyst Today|volume=3|issue=4|pages=421–34|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bar/3/4/421.html|doi=10.1037/h0099997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1957 book ''[[Verbal Behavior]]'', [[B.F. Skinner]] presented an interpretation of language. However, this account was intended to be an interpretation as opposed to an experimental research program, and researchers commonly acknowledge that the research products are somewhat limited in scope. For example, Skinner's behavioral interpretation of language has been useful in some aspects of language training in developmentally disabled children, but it has not led to a robust research program in the range of areas relevant to language and cognition, such as problem-solving, reasoning, metaphor, logic, and so on. RFT advocates are fairly bold in stating that their goal is an experimental behavioral research program in all such areas, and RFT research has indeed emerged in a large number of these areas, including grammar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Louise McHugh &amp; Phil Reed|year=2008|title=Using Relational Frame Theory to build grammar in children with Autistic Spectrum Conditions|journal=Journal of Speech-Language Pathology and Applied Behavior Analysis|volume=3|issue=2–3|page=241|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/slp/3/1/60.pdf&amp;productCode=pa|doi=10.1037/h0100247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of Skinner's book, linguist [[Noam Chomsky]] argued that the [[generative grammar|generativity]] of language shows that it cannot simply be learned, that there must be some innate "[[language acquisition device]]". Many have seen this review as a turning point, when [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]] took the place of [[behaviorism]] as the mainstream in psychology. Behavior analysts generally viewed the criticism as somewhat off point,&lt;ref&gt;For a behavior analytic response to Chomsky, see MacCorquodale (1970), ''[http://www.behavior.org/resources/324.pdf On Chomsky's Review Of Skinner's Verbal Behavior]''&lt;/ref&gt; but it is undeniable that psychology turned its attention elsewhere and the review was very influential in helping to produce the rise of cognitive psychology.

Despite the lack of attention from the mainstream, [[behavior analysis]] is alive and growing. Its application has been extended to areas such as language and cognitive training.&lt;ref name="Cullinan08"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Cullinan, V. &amp; Vitale, A.|year=2008|title=The contribution of Relational Frame Theory to the development of interventions for impairments of language and cognition|journal=Journal of Speech-Language Pathology and Applied Behavior Analysis|volume=3|issue=1|pages=122–35|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/slp/3/1/122.pdf&amp;productCode=pa|doi=10.1037/h0100237}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behavior analysis has long been extended as well to animal training, business and school settings, as well as hospitals and areas of research.

RFT distinguishes itself from Skinner's work by identifying and defining a particular type of [[operant conditioning]] known as ''arbitrarily applicable derived relational responding'' (AADRR). In essence the theory argues that language is not associative but is learned and relational. For example, young children learn relations of coordination between names and objects; followed by relations of difference, opposition, before and after, so on. These are "frames" in the sense that once relating of that kind is learned, any event can be related in that way mutually and in combination with other relations, given a cue to do so. This is a learning process that to date appears to occur only in humans possessing a capacity for language: to date relational framing has not yet been shown unambiguously in non-human animals despite many attempts to do so. AADRR is theorized to be a pervasive influence on almost all aspects of human behavior. The theory represents an attempt to provide a more empirically progressive account of complex human behavior while preserving the naturalistic approach of behavior analysis.&lt;ref name="Cullinan08"/&gt;

==Evidence==
Approximately 300 studies have tested RFT ideas.&lt;ref name="O'Connor2017"/&gt; Supportive data exists in the areas needed to show that an action is "operant" such as the importance of multiple examples in training derived relational responding, the role of context, and the importance of consequences. Derived relational responding has also been shown to alter other behavioral processes such as classical conditioning, an empirical result that RFT theorists point to in explaining why relational operants modify existing behavioristic interpretations of complex human behavior. Empirical advances have also been made by RFT researchers in the analysis and understanding of such topics as metaphor, perspective taking, and reasoning.&lt;ref name="Barnes-Holmes04"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Barnes-Holmes, Y.; Barnes-Holmes, D. &amp; McHugh, L.|year=2004 |title=Teaching Derived Relational Responding to Young Children|journal=JEIBI|volume=1|issue=1|pages=4–16|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/eib/1/1/3.html|doi=10.1037/h0100275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of RFT often indicate the failure to establish a vigorous experimental program in language and cognition as the key reason why behavior analysis fell out of the mainstream of psychology despite its many contributions, and argue that RFT might provide a way forward. The theory is still somewhat controversial within behavioral psychology, however. At the current time the controversy is not primarily empirical since RFT studies&lt;ref name="Dawson2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dawson | first1 = D.L. | last2 = Barnes-Holmes | first2 = D. | last3 = Gresswell | first3 = D.M. | last4 = Hart | first4 = A.J. | last5 = Gore | first5 = N.J. | year = 2009 | title = Assessing the Implicit Beliefs of Sexual Offenders Using the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure: A First Study | url = | journal = Sexual Abuse: A Journal of Research and Treatment | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = 57–75 | doi = 10.1177/1079063208326928 | pmid=19218478}}&lt;/ref&gt; publish regularly in mainstream behavioral journals and few empirical studies have yet claimed to contradict RFT findings. Rather the controversy seems to revolve around whether RFT is a positive step forward, especially given that its implications seem to go beyond many existing interpretations and extensions from within this intellectual tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editors=Hayes, S.C.; Barnes-Holmes, D. &amp; Roche, B.|year=2001|title=Relational Frame Theory: A Post-Skinnerian account of human language and cognition|location=New York|publisher=Plenum Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n4RmapzrihAC|isbn=9780306466007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Acceptance and commitment therapy===
RFT has been argued to be central to the development of the psychotherapeutic tradition known as [[acceptance and commitment therapy]] and [[clinical behavior analysis]] more generally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ijpsy.com/volumen4/num2/88.html|title=Why Relational Frame Theory Alters the Relationship between Basic and Applied Behavioral Psychology {{!}} IJPSY|last=Orellana|first=Javier|website=www.ijpsy.com|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the psychologist [[Steven C. Hayes|Steven C Hayes]] was involved with the creation of both [[acceptance and commitment therapy]] and RFT, and has credited them as inspirations for one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayes|first=Steven C.|date=2004-01-01|title=Acceptance and commitment therapy, relational frame theory, and the third wave of behavioral and cognitive therapies|url=https://zenodo.org/record/850397|journal=Behavior Therapy|volume=35|issue=4|pages=639–665|doi=10.1016/S0005-7894(04)80013-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the extent and exact nature of the interaction between RFT as basic behavioral science and applications such as ACT has been an ongoing point of discussion within the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118489857.ch18/summary|title=The Wiley Handbook of Contextual Behavioral Science|last=Barnes-Holmes|first=Yvonne|last2=Hussey|first2=Ian|last3=McEnteggart|first3=Ciara|last4=Barnes-Holmes|first4=Dermot|last5=Foody|first5=Mairéad|date=2015-01-01|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|isbn=9781118489857|editor-last=Zettle|editor-first=Robert D.|pages=365–382|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781118489857.ch18|editor-last2=Hayes|editor-first2=Steven C.|editor-last3=Barnes-Holmes|editor-first3=Dermot|editor-last4=Biglan|editor-first4=Anthony}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.guilford.com/books/Mastering-the-Clinical-Conversation/Villatte-Villatte-Hayes/9781462523061|title=Mastering the Clinical Conversation: Language as Intervention|website=Guilford Press|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autism spectrum disorder===
RFT provides conceptual and procedural guidance for enhancing the cognitive and language development capability (through its detailed treatment and analysis of derived relational responding and the transformation of function) of early intensive behavior intervention (EIBI) programs for young children with autism and related disorders.&lt;ref name="Barnes-Holmes04"/&gt; The Promoting the Emergence of Advanced Knowledge (PEAK) Relational Training System is heavily influenced by RFT.&lt;ref name="Reed16"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Reed, D.; Luiselli, J.|year=2016 |title=Promoting the emergence of advanced knowledge: A review of peak relational training system: Direct training module by Mark R. Dixon|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|volume=49|issue=1|pages=205-211|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/jaba.281|doi=10.1002/jaba.281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution science===
More recently, RFT has also been proposed as a way to guide discussion of language processes within evolution science, whether within [[evolutionary biology]] or [[evolutionary psychology]], toward a more informed understanding of the role of language in shaping human social behavior. The effort at integrating RFT into evolution science has been led by, among others, [[Steven C. Hayes]], a co-developer of RFT, and [[David Sloan Wilson]], an evolutionary biologist at [[Binghamton University]]. For example, in 2011, Hayes presented at a seminar at Binghamton, on the topic of "Symbolic Behavior, Behavioral Psychology, and the Clinical Importance of Evolution Science",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://evolution.binghamton.edu/evos/seminars/spring-2011/hayes/ |title=Symbolic Behavior, Behavioral Psychology, and the Clinical Importance of Evolution Science [Abstract] |website=evolution.binghamton.edu |accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Wilson likewise presented at a symposium at the annual conference in Parma, Italy, of the [[Association for Contextual Behavioral Science]], the parent organization sponsoring RFT research, on the topic of "Evolution for Everyone, Including Contextual Psychology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://contextualpsychology.org/evolution_for_everyone |title=Evolution for Everyone, Including Contextual Psychology |website=contextualpsychology.org |accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hayes, Wilson, and colleagues have recently linked RFT to the concept of a symbotype&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Wilson, D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6084">{{Redirect|Selfish}}
'''Selfishness''' is being concerned excessively or exclusively, for oneself or one's own advantage, pleasure, or welfare, regardless of others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/selfish?show=0&amp;t=1408827003 "Selfish"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019174738/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/selfish?show=0&amp;t=1408827003 |date=2014-10-19 }}, Merriam-Webster Dictionary, accessed on 23 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/selfish Selfishness - meaning], reference.com, accessed on 23 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Selfishness is the opposite of [[altruism]] or selflessness; and has also been contrasted (as by [[C. S. Lewis]]) with [[Egocentrism|self-centeredness]].&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Lewis, ''Surprised by Joy'' (1988) p. 116-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divergent views==
The implications of selfishness have inspired divergent views within [[religion|religious]], [[philosophy|philosophical]], [[psychology|psychological]], [[economy|economic]], and [[sociobiology|evolutionary]] contexts.

===Classical===
[[Aristotle]] joined a perceived majority of his countrymen in condemning those who sought only to profit themselves; but he approved the man of reason who sought to gain for himself the greatest share of that which deserved social praise.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Ethics'' (1976) p. 301-3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] proposed a cultivation of the self within a wider community – a care for the self which he opposed to mere selfishness in a theme that would later be taken up by [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Gutting ed., ''The Cambridge Companion to Foucault'' (2003) p. 138-30&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval/Renaissance===
Selfishness was viewed in the Western Christian tradition as a central [[vice]] – as standing at the roots of the [[Seven deadly sins]] in the form of pride.&lt;ref&gt;Dante, ''Purgatorio'' (1971) p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francis Bacon]] carried forward this tradition when he characterised “Wisdom for a man's self...[a]s the wisdom of rats”.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Bacon, ''The Essays'' (1985) p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modernity===
With the emergence of a commercial society, [[Bernard Mandeville]] proposed the paradox that social and economic advance depended on private vices – on what he called the sordidness of selfishness.&lt;ref&gt;Mandeville, ''The Fable of the Bees'' (1970) p. 410 and p. 81-3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adam Smith]] with the concept of the [[invisible hand]] saw the economic system as usefully channelling selfish self-interest to wider ends;&lt;ref&gt;M. Skousen, ''The Big Three in Economics'' (2007) p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; while [[John Locke]] based society upon the solitary individual, arguably opening the door for later thinkers like [[Ayn Rand]] to argue for selfishness as a social virtue and the root of social progress.&lt;ref&gt;P. L. Nevins, The Politics of Selfishness'' (2010) p. xii-iii&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman Catholic philosopher [[Jacques Maritain]] opposed the latter view by way of the Aristotelian argument that framing the fundamental question of politics as a choice between altruism and selfishness is a basic and harmful mistake of modern states. Rather, cooperation ought to be the norm: human beings are by nature social animals, and so individual persons can only find their full good in and through pursuing [[Common good#Catholic social teaching|the good of the community]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maritain|first=Jacques|title=The Person and the Common Good|year=1973|publisher=University of Notre Dame Press|location=Notre Dame, IN|isbn=978-0268002046}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==
Lack of [[empathy]] has been seen as one of the roots of selfishness, extending as far as the cold [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]] of the [[psychopath]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Goleman, ''Emotional Intelligence'' (1996) p. 104-10&lt;/ref&gt;

The contrast between self-affirmation and selfishness has become a conflictual arena in which the respective claims of individual/community are often played out between parents and children&lt;ref&gt;R. D. Laing, ''Self and Others'' (1969) p. 142-3&lt;/ref&gt; or men and women, for example.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/singletons/201008/what-is-selfish What is Selfish?]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Psychoanalysts]] favor the development of a genuine sense of self, and may even speak of a healthy selfishness,&lt;ref&gt;N. Symington, ''Narcissism'' (1993) p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to the self-occlusion&lt;ref&gt;Terence Real, ''I Don't Want to Talk About It'' (1997) p. 203-5&lt;/ref&gt; of what [[Anna Freud]] called 'emotional surrender'.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips, ''On Flirtation''  (1994) p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminology==
Self-centeredness was marked as a key feature in a phenomenological theory of criminality named "The [[Criminal Spin]]" model. Accordingly, in most criminal behaviors there is an heightened state of self-centeredness, that differently manifests itself in different situations and in different forms of criminality.&lt;ref&gt;Ronel, N. (2011). Criminal behavior, criminal mind: Being caught in a criminal spin. International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology, 55(8), 1208 - 1233&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Synderesis''' or '''synteresis''', in [[scholasticism|scholastic]] [[moral philosophy]], is the natural ''capacity'' or disposition (habitus) of the ''[[practical reason]]'' to apprehend intuitively the universal ''[[first principles]]'' of human ''action''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14384a.htm | title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Synderesis | work=Catholic Encyclopedia | access-date=2 January 2016 | quote=Synderesis, or more correctly synteresis, is a term used by the Scholastic theologians to signify the habitual knowledge of the universal practical principles of moral action.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reason]] is a single faculty, but is called differently according to the end that it assigns to its search for [[truth]]; when its goal is the mere consideration (contemplation) of truth, it is called ''speculative reason''; when it considers truth in view of action ([[Praxis (process)|praxis]]), it is called ''practical reason''. In both cases reason uses demonstration ([[syllogism]]) as its tool; it proceeds from the understanding of previously known truths ([[premise]]s) to the statement of a proposition ([[logical consequence|conclusion]]) whose truth follows necessarily from the premises.

How does one know that those premises (and consequently their conclusion) are true? Because they are themselves conclusions of previous demonstrations. Although one could take back this process of demonstration of the truth of premises as far as we want, a [[Infinite regress|regression ad infinitum]] would deprive the demonstrative chain of certitude. Consequently, it is necessary that the point of departure of human reasoning be some immediately knowable, i.e. [[self-evident]], [[proposition]]s called ''first principles'', whose truth is not, indeed cannot be grasped through demonstration, but only by [[intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] (noûs).

The habit or disposition that allows the speculative reason to apprehend intuitively the principles that preside over its [[discursive reasoning]] is called "understanding of principles" (intellectus principiorum).  The principles of "[[principle of non-contradiction|non contradiction]]", of "[[principle of identity|identity]]" and of "[[law of excluded middle|excluded middle]]", all of which are ultimately based on the notion of "[[being]]", which is the first that our reason apprehends absolutely, are all examples of those principles.

Similarly, the capacity or disposition that allows the practical reason to apprehend intuitively the principles or laws that preside over its discursive reasoning regarding human action is called ''synderesis''. Just as "being" is the first notion apprehended absolutely, so also "[[goodness and value theory|good]]" is the first thing that is apprehended by the practical reason, since everything that acts does so for an end which possesses the quality of goodness. That is why the first principle or law of the practical reason is "good is to be done and pursued, and evil is to be avoided". Also the precepts of natural law can be considered object of synderesis insofar as all the things towards which the human being has a natural inclination are naturally apprehended by the intellect as good and therefore as objects to be pursued, and their opposites as evils to be avoided.

Synderesis is the capacity not only to apprehend the first principles, but also to judge every step of the practical discourse in the light of those principles. But, as an intellectual disposition concerned with knowledge of the first principles of action, synderesis provides only the [[universal premise]] of the practical syllogism. Every human ''action'', however, is singular, [[contingent]] and takes place in particular circumstances. To complete the practical discourse and reach a conclusion regarding what has to be done ''hic et nunc'' [here and now] and what means are  to be used, other capacities are necessary besides synderesis, and to actually effect the action other faculties are required besides reason. That is why the whole picture concerning human action includes powers, dispositions and acts such as conscience, desire, will, etc.

The origin of the notion of synderesis as presented here can be traced, on the one hand, to the Commentary on [[Ezechiel]] by [[Saint Jerome]] (A.D. 347–419), where ''syntéresin'' (συντήρησιν) is mentioned among the powers of the [[soul]] and is described as the spark of conscience (''scintilla conscientiae'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/s/synderes.htm | title=Synderesis &amp;#124; Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | author=Anonymous | work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | access-date=2 January 2016 | quote="Synderesis" is a technical term from scholastic philosophy, signifying the innate principle in the moral consciousness of every person which directs the agent to good and restrains him from evil. It is first found in a single passage of St Jerome (d. 420) in his explanation of the four living creatures in Ezekiel's vision. }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, on the other, to the interpretation of Jerome's text given, in the 13th century, by [[Albertus|Albert the Great]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] in the light of Aristotelian psychology and [[Aristotelianism|ethics]]. The word ''synderesis'' is by most scholars reckoned to be a corruption of the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for shared knowledge or conscience, ''syneidêsis'' ({{lang|grc|συνείδησις}}), the corruption appearing in the medieval manuscripts of Jerome's Commentary.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Kries in ''Traditio'' vol. 57: ''Origen, Plato, and Conscience (Synderesis) in Jerome's Ezekiel Commentary'', p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative interpretation of synderesis was proposed by [[Bonaventure]], who considered it as the natural inclination of the ''[[will (philosophy)|will]]'' towards moral good.

The term is found applied in psychiatric studies too, with particular reference to [[psychopathy]].&lt;ref&gt;''Martha Stout'', (2005) ''The Sociopath Next Door'', Broadway Books, {{ISBN|0-7679-1582-8}} (term ''synderesis'' in pages 27, 28, 29, 33)&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Altshuller's insight, the theory developed on a foundation of extensive research covering hundreds of thousands of inventions across many different fields to produce a theory which defines generalisable patterns in the nature of inventive solutions and the distinguishing characteristics of the problems that these inventions have overcome&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vidal|first=Rosario|last2=Salmeron|first2=Jose L.|last3=Mena|first3=Angel|last4=Chulvi|first4=Vicente|title=Fuzzy Cognitive Map-based selection of TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) trends for eco-innovation of ceramic industry products|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.04.131|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|volume=107|pages=202–214|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.04.131}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

An important part of the theory has been devoted to revealing patterns of [[evolution (disambiguation)|evolution]] and one of the objectives which has been pursued by leading practitioners of TRIZ has been the development of an [[algorithm|algorithmic approach]] to the invention of new [[system]]s, and to the refinement of existing ones.

TRIZ includes a practical [[methodology]], tool sets, a [[knowledge base]], and model-based technology for generating innovative solutions for [[problem solving]]. It is useful for problem formulation, [[system analysis]], [[failure analysis]], and patterns of system evolution.  There is a general similarity of purposes and methods with the field of [[pattern language]], a cross discipline practice for explicitly describing and sharing holistic patterns of design.

The research has produced three primary findings:
# problems and solutions are repeated across industries and sciences
# patterns of technical evolution are also repeated across industries and sciences
# the innovations used scientific effects outside the field in which they were developed

TRIZ practitioners apply all these findings in order to create and to improve products, services, and systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.triz-journal.com/whatistriz.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111201172928/http://www.triz-journal.com/whatistriz.htm |archivedate=2011-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
TRIZ in its classical form was developed by the Soviet inventor and science fiction writer Genrich Altshuller and his associates.
He started developing TRIZ in 1946 while working in the "Inventions Inspection" department of the [[Caspian Sea Flotilla|Caspian Sea flotilla]] of the [[Soviet Navy]]. His job was to help with the initiation of invention proposals, to rectify and document them, and to prepare applications to the patent office. During this time he realised that a problem requires an inventive solution if there is an unresolved contradiction in the sense that improving one parameter impacts negatively on another. He later called these "technical contradictions".

His work on what later resulted in TRIZ was interrupted in 1950 by his arrest and sentencing to 25 years in the [[Vorkuta]] [[Gulag|Gulag labor camps]]. The arrest was partially triggered by letters which he and Raphael Shapiro sent to [[Josef stalin|Stalin]], ministers and newspapers about certain decisions made by the Soviet Government, which they believed were erroneous.&lt;ref name="dotrubiog"&gt;{{cite web|title=Генрих Саулович Альтшуллер (Genrich Saulovich Altshuller - short biography)|url=http://www.altshuller.ru/biography/|publisher=www.altshuller.ru|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104001718/http://www.altshuller.ru/biography|archivedate=2010-11-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Altshuller and Shapiro were freed during the [[Khrushchev Thaw]] following Stalin's death in 1953 &lt;ref name=Salon1 /&gt; and returned to [[Baku]].

The first paper on TRIZ titled "On the psychology of inventive creation" was published in 1956 in "Issues in Psychology" (Voprosi Psichologii) journal.&lt;ref name="1956VP"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Altshuller|first=G. S.|author2=Shapiro, R.

By 1969, Altshuller had reviewed about 40,000 [[patent]] abstracts in order to find out in what way the [[innovation]] had taken place and developed the concept of technical contradictions, the concept of ideality of a system, contradiction matrix, and [[40 principles of invention]]. In the years that followed he developed the concepts of physical contradictions, SuField analysis (structural substance-field analysis), standard solutions, several [[laws of technical systems evolution]], and numerous other theoretical and practical approaches.

Altshuller also observed clever and creative people at work: he uncovered patterns in their thinking, and developed thinking tools and techniques to model this "talented thinking". These tools include Smart Little People&lt;ref&gt;[reference to p 110] Alshuller, G.S. (1984) [http://matriz.org/resources/literature/ Creativity as an Exact Science: the Theory of the Solution of Inventive Problems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530025029/http://matriz.org/resources/literature/ |date=2015-05-30 }} Translated by Williams, A. Gordon and Breach Science Publishers Inc]&lt;/ref&gt; and Thinking in Time and Scale (or the Screens of Talented Thought).&lt;ref&gt;[reference to p 121] Alshuller, G.S. (1984) Creativity as an Exact Science: the Theory of the Solution of Inventive Problems Translated by Williams, A. Gordon and Breach Science Publishers Inc]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971 Altshuller convinced The Inventors Society to establish in Baku the first TRIZ teaching facility, called the Azerbaijan Public Institute for Inventive Creation and the first TRIZ research lab called The Public Lab for Inventive Creation. Altshuller was appointed the head of the lab by the society. The lab incubated the TRIZ movement and in the years that followed other TRIZ teaching institutes were established in all major cities of the USSR.

From 1986 Altshuller switched his attention away from technical TRIZ, and started investigating the development of individual creativity. He also developed a version of TRIZ for children, which was trialled in various schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xtriz.com/BriefHistoryOfTRIZ.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922153214/http://www.xtriz.com/BriefHistoryOfTRIZ.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 the TRIZ Association was formed, with Altshuller chosen as President.

Following the end of the [[cold war]], the waves of emigrants from the former Soviet Union brought TRIZ to other countries and drew attention to it overseas.&lt;ref name="Webb1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Webb|first=Alan|title=TRIZ: an inventive approach to invention|journal=Manufacturing Engineer|date=August 2002|pages=171–177}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 the Altshuller Institute for TRIZ Studies was established in [[Boston, MA|Boston]], USA.

== Basic principles ==

TRIZ presents a systematic approach for understanding and defining challenging problems: difficult problems require an inventive solution, and TRIZ provides a range of strategies and tools for finding these inventive solutions. One of the earliest findings of the massive research on which the theory is based is that the vast majority of problems that require inventive solutions typically reflect a need to overcome a dilemma or a trade-off between two contradictory elements. The central purpose of TRIZ-based analysis is to systematically apply the strategies and tools to find superior solutions that overcome the need for a compromise or trade-off between the two elements.

[[File:Prism of TRIZ Oxford Creativity.png|thumb|Prism of TRIZ]]
By the early 1970s two decades of research covering hundreds of thousands of patents had confirmed Altshuller's initial insight about the patterns of inventive solutions and one of the first analytical tools was published in the form of 40 inventive principles, which could account for virtually all of those patents that presented truly inventive solutions. Following this approach the "Conceptual solution" shown in the diagram can be found by defining the contradiction which needs to be resolved and systematically considering which of the 40 principles may be applied to provide a specific solution which will overcome the "contradiction" in the problem at hand, enabling a solution that is closer to the "ultimate ideal result".

[[File:Contradictions Matrix image.jpg|thumb|Contradictions Matrix]]
The combination of all of these concepts together – the analysis of the contradiction, the pursuit of an ideal solution and the search for one or more of the principles which will overcome the contradiction, are the key elements in a process which is designed to help the inventor to engage in the process with purposefulness and focus.

[[File:40_principles_of_TRIZ_method_720dpi.jpg|thumb|40 principles of TRIZ method rendered schematically]]

One of the tools which evolved as an extension of the 40 principles was a contradiction matrix&lt;ref name="triz.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.triz.co.uk/pwpcontrol.php?pwpID=13122|title=Contradictions Matrix - TRIZ Tools Oxford Creativity|website=www.triz.co.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522141958/http://www.triz.co.uk/pwpcontrol.php?pwpID=13122|archivedate=2015-05-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the contradictory elements of a problem were categorized according to a list of 39 factors which could impact on each other. The combination of each pairing of these 39 elements is set out in a matrix (for example, the weight of a stationary object, the use of energy by a moving object, the ease of repair etc.) Each of the 39 elements is represented down the rows and across the columns (as the negatively affected element) and based upon the research and analysis of patents: wherever precedent solutions have been found that resolve a conflict between two of the elements, the relevant cells in the matrix typically contain a sub-set of three or four principles that have been applied most frequently in inventive solutions which resolve contradictions between those two elements.

The main objective of the contradiction matrix was to simplify the process of selecting the most appropriate Principle to resolve a specific contradiction. It was the core of all modifications of ARIZ till 1973. But in 1973, after introducing the concept of physical contradictions and creating SuField analysis, Altshuller realized that the contradiction matrix was comparatively an inefficient tool and stopped working on it. Beginning ARIZ-71c contradiction matrix ceased to be the core of ARIZ and therefore was not a tool for solving inventive problems that Altshuller believed should be pursued.

Physical contradictions and separation principles as well as SuField analysis, etc. became the core. Despite this, the [[40 principles of invention]] has remained the most popular tool taught in introductory seminars and has consistently attracted the most attention amongst the tens of thousands of individuals who visit TRIZ-focused web sites in a typical month. Therefore,  many of those who learn TRIZ or have attended seminars are taught quite wrongly that TRIZ is primarily composed of the 40 principles and contradiction matrix, the truth is ARIZ is the core methodology of TRIZ.

[[TRIZ#ARIZ - algorithm of inventive problems solving|ARIZ]] is an algorithmic approach to finding inventive solutions by identifying and resolving contradictions. This includes the "system of inventive standards solutions" which Altshuller used to replace the 40 principles and contradiction matrix, it consists of SuField modeling and the 76 inventive standards. A number of TRIZ-based computer programs have been developed whose purpose is to provide assistance to engineers and inventors in finding inventive solutions for technological problems. Some of these programs are also designed to apply another TRIZ methodology whose purpose is to reveal and forecast emergency situations and to anticipate circumstances which could result in undesirable outcomes.

One of the important branches of TRIZ is focused on analysing and predicting trends of evolution in the characteristics that existing solutions are likely to develop in successive generations of a system.

== Essentials ==

===Basic terms===
*''Ideal final result'' (IFR) - the ultimate idealistic solution of a problem when the desired result is achieved by itself. Note that the Ideal Final Result is also an ARIZ term for the formulation of the inventive problem in the form of a Technical Contradiction (IFR-1) and a Physical Contradiction (IFR-2);
*''Administrative contradiction'' - contradiction between the needs and abilities;
*''Technical contradiction'' - an inverse dependence between parameters/characteristics of a machine or technology;
*''Physical contradiction'' - opposite/contradictory physical requirements to an object;
*''Separation principle'' - a method of resolving physical contradictions by separating contradictory requirements;
*''Vepol'' or ''Su-field'' - a minimal technical system consisting of two material objects (substances) and a "field". "Field" is the source of energy whereas one of the substances is "transmission" and the other one is the "tool";
*''Fepol'' or ''Ferfiel'' - a sort of Vepol (Su-field) where "substances" are ferromagnetic objects;
*''[[Level of invention]]'';
*''Standard solution'' - a standard inventive solution of a higher level;
*''[[Laws of technical systems evolution]]'';
*''[[Algorithm of inventive problems solving]] (ARIZ), which combines various specialized methods of TRIZ into one universal tool'';
*''Talented Thinking or Thinking in Time and Scale'';
*Effect : Scientific knowledge to solve problem listed by not alphabetical order but functional order

=== Identifying a problem: contradictions ===
Altshuller has shown that at the heart of some inventive problems lie [[contradiction]]s (one of the basic TRIZ concepts) between two or more elements, such as, "If we want more acceleration, we need a larger engine; but that will increase the cost of the car," that is, more of something desirable also brings more of something less desirable, or less of something else also desirable.

These are called ''technical contradictions'' by Altshuller. He also defined so-called physical or inherent contradictions: More of one thing and less of the same thing may both be desired in the same system. For instance, a higher temperature may be needed to melt a compound more rapidly, but a lower temperature may be needed to achieve a homogeneous mixture.

An ''inventive situation'' which challenges us to be inventive, might involve several such contradictions. Conventional solutions typically "trade"  one contradictory parameter for another; no special inventiveness is needed for that. Rather, the inventor would develop a creative approach for resolving the contradiction, such as inventing an engine that produces more acceleration without increasing the cost of the engine.

===Inventive principles and the matrix of contradictions===
Altshuller screened patents in order to find out what kind of contradictions were resolved or dissolved by the invention and the way this had been achieved. From this he developed a set of 40 inventive principles and later a matrix of contradictions.&lt;ref name="triz.co.uk"/&gt; Rows of the matrix indicate the 39 system features that one typically wants to improve, such as speed, weight, accuracy of measurement and so on. Columns refer to typical undesired results. Each matrix cell points to principles that have been most frequently used in patents in order to resolve the contradiction.

For instance, Dolgashev mentions the following contradiction: increasing accuracy of measurement of machined balls while avoiding the use of expensive microscopes and elaborate control equipment. The matrix cell in row "accuracy of measurement" and column "complexity of control" points to several principles, among them the Copying Principle, which states, "Use a simple and inexpensive optical copy with a suitable scale instead of an object that is complex, expensive, fragile or inconvenient to operate." From this general invention principle, the following idea might solve the problem: Taking a high-resolution image of the machined ball. A screen with a grid might provide the required measurement. As mentioned above, Altshuller abandoned this method of defining and solving "technical" contradictions in the mid 1980s and instead used SuField modeling and the 76 inventive standards and a number of other tools included in the algorithm for solving inventive problems, ARIZ.

===Laws of technical system evolution===
{{Main|Laws of technical systems evolution}}

Altshuller also studied the way technical systems have been developed and improved over time. From this, he discovered several trends (so called Laws of Technical Systems Evolution) that help engineers predict the most likely improvements that can be made to a given product. The most important of these laws involves the ideality of a system.

===Substance-field analysis===

One more technique that is frequently used by inventors involves the analysis of substances, fields and other resources that are currently not being used and that can be found within the system or nearby. TRIZ uses non-standard definitions for substances and fields. Altshuller developed methods to analyze resources; several of his invention principles involve the use of different substances and fields that help resolve contradictions and increase ideality of a technical system. For instance, [[videotex]]t systems used television signals to transfer data, by taking advantage of the small time segments between TV frames in the signals.

SuField analysis produces a structural model of the initial technological system, exposes its characteristics, and with the help of special laws, transforms the model of the problem. Through this transformation the structure of the solution that eliminates the shortcomings of the initial problem is revealed. SuField analysis is a special language of formulas with which it is possible to easily describe any technological system in terms of a specific (structural) model. A model produced in this manner is transformed according to special laws and regularities, thereby revealing the structural solution of the problem.

===ARIZ - algorithm of inventive problems solving===

ARIZ (Russian acronym of алгоритм решения изобретательских задач - АРИЗ) (algorithm of inventive problems solving) is a list of about 85 step-by-step procedures to solve complicated invention problems, where other tools of TRIZ alone (Sufield analysis, 40 inventive principles, etc.) are not sufficient.

Various TRIZ software (see [[Invention Machine]]'s Goldfire, ideation international, Guided Innovation Toolkit, TriSolver, Innovation Suite, TRIZ GB) are based on this algorithm.

Starting with an updated matrix of contradictions, semantic analysis, subcategories of inventive principles and lists of scientific effects, some new interactive applications are other attempts to simplify the problem formulation phase and the transition from a generic problem to a whole set of specific solutions. (See the external links for details.)

===Use of TRIZ on Management Problems===
Although TRIZ was developed from the analysis of technical systems, it has been used widely as a method for understanding and solving complex management problems. Examples include finding additional cost savings for the legal department of a local government body: the inventive solution generated was to generate additional revenue [insert reference to cost-cutting in local government case study]. The results of the TRIZ work are expected to generate £1.7 m in profit in the first 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legalbusiness.co.uk/index.php/lb-blog-view/2727-the-overall-benefits-are-potentially-enormous-bucks-county-council-granted-abs-licence-with-emergency-services-group |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810060018/http://www.legalbusiness.co.uk/index.php/lb-blog-view/2727-the-overall-benefits-are-potentially-enormous-bucks-county-council-granted-abs-licence-with-emergency-services-group |archivedate=2014-08-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Use of TRIZ methods in industry==
Case studies on the use of TRIZ are difficult to acquire as many companies believe TRIZ gives them a competitive advantage and are reluctant to publicise their adoption of the method. However some examples are available: Samsung is the most famous success story, and has invested heavily in embedding TRIZ use throughout the company, right up to and including the CEO; "In 2003 TRIZ led to 50 new patents for Samsung and in 2004 one project alone, a DVD pick-up innovation, saved Samsung over $100 million. TRIZ is now an obligatory skill set if you want to advance within Samsung".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/haydnshaughnessy/2013/03/07/why-is-samsung-such-an-innovative-company/2/|title=What Makes Samsung Such An Innovative Company?|first=Haydn|last=Shaughnessy|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180220152921/https://www.forbes.com/sites/haydnshaughnessy/2013/03/07/why-is-samsung-such-an-innovative-company/2/|archivedate=2018-02-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

The application of TRIZ tools in numerous German industrial companies in the recent decade has followed the principles of the [[Advanced Innovation Design Approach]], which recommends application of the selected TRIZ tools in the early stage of the innovation process for the identification of customer needs, comprehensive problem definition and ideation, new concept development and optimization.

The '''Tetrapharmakos''' ({{lang|grc|τετραφάρμακος}}) "four-part remedy" is a summary of the first four of the Κύριαι Δόξαι (''Kuriai Doxai'', the forty Epicurean ''Principal Doctrines'' given by [[Diogenes Laertius]] in his ''[[Lives of the Eminent Philosophers|Life of Epicurus]]'') in [[Epicureanism]],  a recipe for leading the happiest possible life.  
They are recommendations to avoid [[anxiety]] or [[existential dread]].&lt;ref&gt;"The fundamental obstacle to happiness, says Epicurus, is [[anxiety]],"  Hutchinson 1994, p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "[[tetrapharmacum|tetrapharmakos]]" was originally a compound of four drugs ([[wax]], [[tallow]], [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]] and [[resin]]); the word has been used metaphorically by Roman-era Epicureans.&lt;ref&gt;The name cannot be traced further back than [[Cicero]] and [[Philodemos]].

This is a summary of the first four of the forty Epicurean ''Principal Doctrines'' (''Sovran Maxims'') given by [[Diogenes Laertius]], which in the [[:wikisource:Lives_of_the_Eminent_Philosophers/Book_X#Kuriai_Doxai|translation]] by [[Robert Drew Hicks]] (1925) read as follows:

:1. A happy and eternal being has no trouble himself and brings no trouble upon any other being; hence he is exempt from movements of anger and partiality, for every such movement implies weakness 
:2. Death is nothing to us; for the body, when it has been resolved into its elements, has no feeling, and that which has no feeling is nothing to us. 
:3. The magnitude of pleasure reaches its limit in the removal of all pain. When pleasure is present, so long as it is uninterrupted, there is no pain either of body or of mind or of both together. 
:4. Continuous pain does not last long in the body; on the contrary, pain, if extreme, is present a short time, and even that degree of pain which barely outweighs pleasure in the body does not last for many days together. Illnesses of long duration even permit of an excess of pleasure over pain in the body. 

===Don't fear god===
In Hellenistic religion, the gods  were conceived as hypothetical beings in a perpetual state of bliss,  indestructible entities that are completely invulnerable. Gods in this view are mere role models for human beings, who are to "emulate the happiness of the gods, within the limits imposed by human nature."&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson 1994, p. ix–x.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Don't worry about death===
As D. S. Hutchinson wrote concerning this line, "While you are alive, you don't have to deal with being dead, but when you are dead you don't have to deal with it either, because you aren't there to deal with it." In Epicurus' own words, "Death means nothing to us...when we exist, death is not yet present, and when death is present, then we do not exist,"&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.epicurus.net/en/menoeceus.html Letter to Menoeceus]'', 125&lt;/ref&gt; for there is no [[afterlife]]. Death, says Epicurus, is the greatest anxiety of all, in length and intensity. This anxiety about death impedes the quality and happiness of one's life by the theory of afterlife: the worrying about whether or not one's deeds and actions in life will translate well into the region of the gods, the wondering whether one will be assigned to an eternity of pain or to an eternity of pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson 1994, p. viii–ix.&lt;/ref&gt;

===What is good is easy to get===
Sustenance and shelter, these things can be acquired by anyone — by both animal and human — with minimal effort, regardless of wealth. But if one wants more than one needs (over indulgency, gluttony, etc.), one is limiting the chances of satisfaction and happiness, and therefore creating a “needless anxiety” in one’s life. "What is good is easy to get" implies that the minimum amount of necessity it takes to satisfy an urge is the maximum amount of interest a person should have in satisfying that urge.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson 1994, p. vii–viii.&lt;/ref&gt;

===What is terrible is easy to endure===
The Epicureans understood that, in nature, illness and pain is not suffered for very long, for pain and suffering is either "brief or chronic ... either mild or intense, but discomfort that is both chronic and intense is very unusual; so there is no need to be concerned about the prospect of suffering." Like "What is good is easy to get," recognizing one's physical and mental limit and one's threshold of pain — understanding how much pain the body or mind can endure — and maintaining confidence that pleasure only follows pain (and the avoidance of anxiety about the length of pain), is the remedy against prolonged suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson 1994, p. viii.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2316">[[File:Line integral convolution visualisation (color).png|thumb|Line integral convolution visualisation of a flow field.]]

In [[scientific visualization]], '''texture advection''' is a family of methods to densely visualize [[vector field]]s or flows (like the wind movement of a tornado). Scientists can use the created images and animations to better understand these flows and reason about them. 
In comparison to techniques that visualise [[Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines|streamlines]], [[streakline]]s, or [[timeline]]s, methods of this family don't need any seed points and can produce a whole image at every step.

The methods have in common that they bend a whole image (or texture) according to the flow to create a new image that is warped by the flow. If that is done in small enough time steps and often enough, the images can be combined to create an animation visualising the flow.

'''Thomas Harold Gamboa''' (born February 28, 1948) is the former manager of the [[Brooklyn Cyclones]].

In [[general relativity]], the '''topogravitic tensor''' is one of the three pieces of the [[Bel decomposition]] of the [[Riemann tensor]].

The topogravitic tensor can be interpreted as representing the [[sectional curvature]]s for the spatial part of a [[frame fields in general relativity|frame field]].

'''Yun Chi-ho''' ([[Hangul|Korean]]: 윤치호, [[hanja]]: 尹致昊, 1864 – 1945) was an important political activist and thinker during the late 1800s and early 1900s in [[Joseon]] Korea. His penname was '''Jwa-ong''' (좌옹, 佐翁&lt;ref&gt;Korean spelling for Sitdown is old man&lt;/ref&gt;); his courtesy name was '''Sungheum''' (성흠;聖欽), '''Sungheum''' (성흠;成欽). a member of Korean early NGO's [[Independence Club]] (독립협회;獨立協會) and [[People's joint association]] (만민공동회;萬民共同會), [[Shinminhwae]] (신민회;新民會). He was a strong nationalist especially in his early years; pushing for reform and modernization in the Joseon government.&lt;ref name="Clark, Donald N 1945 pp 37-42"&gt;Clark, Donald N. Yun Ch'i-ho (1864-1945): “Portrait of a Korean Intellectual in an Era of Transition”. Source: Occasional Papers on Korea, No. 4 (September 1975),pp 37-42, 46-50, 54-56, 57, 58&lt;/ref&gt; He was involved in important organizations such as the [[Independence Club]] led by [[Seo Jae-pil]]. He also served in various government positions and was a strong supporter of Christianity in Korea.&lt;ref name="Chandra, Vipan 1988 pp 89-91"&gt;Chandra, Vipan. “Imperialism, Resistance, and Reform in Late Nineteenth-Century Korea: Enlightenment and the Independence Club”. (1988) Regents of the University of California {{ISBN|0-912966-99-8}}, pp 89-91, 137, 172&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Yun's early years were filled with strong support of patriotic and nationalist movements, there seemed to have been a change in Yun’s approach to Korean independence in the wake of the Japanese dominance in Korea, starting with Korea becoming a protectorate of Japan in 1904, and then fully annexed into the [[Japanese Empire]] in 1910. Because of Yun’s apparent change in attitude toward Korean independence and his lack of support of nationalist movements, like the 1919 Samil Movement, many Koreans today see him as a collaborator with the Japanese.&lt;ref name="Caprio, Mark 2007"&gt;Caprio, Mark (2007). "Loyal Patriot? Traitorous Collaborator? The Yun Ch'iho Diaries and the Question of National Loyalty." ''Journal of Colonialism and Colonial History'', Volume 7, Number 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yun Chi-ho was a member of one of the prominent ''[[yangban]]'' families of Korea.&lt;ref name="nyt1913"&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1913/03/21/100257080.pdf  "100 Koreans Freed; But Baron Yun Chi-ho and Other Prominent Men Are Found Guilty,"] ''New York Times.''

[http://www.yunposun.com/technote/read.cgi?board=doc&amp;y_number=19&amp;nnew=1  "A Search for Truth; Yun Chi-Ho's Legacy is Rediscovered by his Great-granddaughter,"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718150204/http://www.yunposun.com/technote/read.cgi?board=doc&amp;y_number=19&amp;nnew=1 |date=July 18, 2011 }} ''Emory Magazine,''  Vol 80, No. 1, Spring 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also an early leader of the Korean [[YMCA]] and a South Korean [[Methodist]].

==Early life==
Yun Chi-ho was born on December 26, 1864 in a small village in Dunpo-myeon, [[Asan]], [[Chungcheong Province]]. His father, [[Yun Ung-yeol]], was an official in the Joseon government and as a member of the [[yangban]] aristocracy saw that Chi-ho received a proper education. Yun Chi-ho excelled in his studies of the [[Confucian classics]] at the local seodang and even tried to apply to take the civil-service exams ([[gwageo]]) at age twelve.&lt;ref name="Clark, Donald N 1945 pp 37-42"/&gt;

Yun's family was one of [[Joseon dynasty]]'s most illustrious noble families; his 9G-Great grandfather [[Yun Doo-su]] (윤두수;尹斗壽) was [[Yeonguijeong]] under [[King Seonjo]]. But his father Yun Ung-ryeol was an illegitimate son of his grandfather Yun Chui-dong (윤취동;尹取東).

From 1871 to 1878, Yun studied Confucianism at Chang's private village school.

===Trip to Japan===
Because of Yun Ung-yeol’s position in the government, he was able to arrange for Yun Chi-ho’s participation in a delegation of representatives from Korea to observe the process of modernization in Japan in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;Schmid, Andre. “Korea Between Empires”. (2002) Columbia University Press {{ISBN|0-231-12538-0}} pp. 47, 49, 76, 112&lt;/ref&gt; Yun was only sixteen years old at the time, but this experience greatly influenced his thoughts on modernization and opened his eyes to world beyond the isolated “Hermit Kingdom” that Korea had become. He frequently compared the lack of progress in Joseon Korea to the rapid modernization of Japan and often lamented in his diaries that he wanted nothing more than for Korea to become the kind of advanced, modern nation that Japan had become.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Yun, Chi-ho. "Yun Chi-Ho's Diaries". Vol I-X. 1975 National History Compilation Committee. Seoul, Korea&lt;/ref&gt;

===Studying in China===
Yun would later travel to [[Shanghai]], [[China]] in 1885 where he would attend the Anglo-Chinese College studying English and mathematics, among other things. While in Shanghai he also converted to Christianity, something that would play a major role throughout the rest of his life. Yun Chi-ho viewed Christianity as a strong progressive philosophy that could help Korea catch up with the advancements of Japan and the West.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Time in America===
He eventually even studied in America, starting in 1888 at [[Vanderbilt University]] and then [[Emory University]]. He strongly admired many aspects of American culture, but was also frustrated with the racial prejudices he experienced while living in the South. In particular, he would identify tensions and contradictions between Christian universalism, and the belief that any individual could earn respect and equality as long as they were pious, and the arbitrary demonstrations of white supremacy that he routinely witnessed and experienced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Urban|first1=Andrew|title=Yun Ch’i-ho’s Alienation by Way of Inclusion: A Korean International Student and Christian Reform in the 'New' South, 1888–1893|journal=Journal of Asian American Studies|date=October 2014|volume=17|issue=3|pages=305–336}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While in America he studied English, theology and speech and he gained a great deal of proficiency in the English language; writing most of his diaries in English.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
[[File:Yun Chiho Emory Univ 1892.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Yun Chi-ho as a student at [[Emory University]] (1892).]]

==Government Service==

===Interpreter===
Yun served in several important government positions throughout his life. He served as an interpreter for the first American Foreign Minister in Korea, [[Lucius Foote]]. Upon arriving in Korea Foote had inquired to the Japanese Foreign Minister [[Inoue Kaoru]] about finding someone to interpret for him while in Seoul, and Minister Inoue, who knew Yun Chi-ho from his days in Japan, recommended Yun to help serve Minister Foote. It was also Foote who helped Yun with arranging his studies in Shanghai.&lt;ref name="Clark, Donald N 1945 pp 37-42"/&gt;

===Vice President of the Privy Council and banishment===
Yun also served as the Vice President of the Privy Council of the Joseon Court from 1898 until he was banished in 1899 due to pressure from opposing factions in the government. While banished to the countryside, Yun served as magistrate for a town called Wonsan in Northern Korea. His banishment was not long lived and in 1903 he was called to serve as the Vice Foreign Minister.&lt;ref name="Clark, Donald N 1945 pp 37-42"/&gt;

==Korean Independence Movements==

===The Independence Club===
When Yun arrived back in Korea from his studies abroad, there were small groups of scholars who were beginning to call for social and political reform in Korea. One such group was the Independence club, which Yun began to participate in. Among other things, the club promoted educating the Korean people on their unique history, promoted the use of Hangeul, the Korean vernacular alphabet, and pushed for government reform. While in the Independence Club Yun called for the government to be more representative of its people and even supported the elevation of [[Gojong of the Korean Empire|King Kojong]] to the title of Gwangmu Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Neff, Robert D. “Korea through Western Eyes”. (2009) Seoul National University Press. {{ISBN|978-89-521-1003-9}} pp 137&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the group was met with pressure from opposing factions in the government that believed the club was gaining too much influence and so in 1899, the club disbanded.&lt;ref name="Chandra, Vipan 1988 pp 89-91"/&gt;

===The Enlightenment Movement===
As Japanese influence on the Korean peninsula began to tighten, Yun also began to support groups that were part of the Enlightenment movement. These groups, such as the Korean Self-Strengthening Society and the New People’s Society, were picking up the pieces where the independence club had left off, and Yun Chi-ho helped them out by giving speeches and writing pamphlets for them. During his time of Banishment, these groups gave Yun something to work for in the hopes of creating a stronger Korean society.&lt;ref name="Chandra, Vipan 1988 pp 89-91"/&gt;

=== Japanese Annexation of Korea ===
{{Main|105-Man Incident}}

{{quote|Joseon people are 10 percent rationality and 90 percent emotion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.munhwa.com/news/view.html?no=2001022101011830074004 The Yun Chi-ho's Diary] The Munhwa 2001.02.21&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From his early years, he was disappointed in the Joseon people for always having an emotional response and frustrated in their irrationality.
In January 1910, he participated in the World Missionary Conference in America and that May, he attended to [[Edinburgh World Missionary Conference]] in [[England]]. In December 1910, he returned to his country.

When the [[Korean Empire]] was overrun by Japanese military forces in 1910 (see [[Japan-Korea Treaty of 1910]]), Yun Chi-ho joined with others in resisting Japanese occupation. He became an anti-Imperialist speaker and independence activist.&lt;ref name="ng2003"/&gt; In 1911, he was Judgment for alleged assassination of the Governor General of Korea. He suffered from malicious punishment and torture as a result of the [[105-Man Incident]].

In 1913, along with 104 others, he was charged with conspiracy against the Japanese Governor-General at the time, [[Count Terauchi]]. He was one of six who were convicted and sentenced to long prison terms.&lt;ref name="nyt1913"/&gt;  His experiences in prison tempered his willingness to express his nationalist ardor,&lt;ref name="ng2003"/&gt; but he was still considered active in the independence movement.&lt;ref&gt;Chung, Henry. (1921). ''The Case of Korea,'' p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conspiracy Trial and Imprisonment==
In 1911 Yun was implicated in assisting with an assassination attempt on Japanese governor-general, Terauchi Masatake. Sources from within some of the Enlightenment Movement groups that Yun had taken part in had informed Japanese officials that he had a hand in planning this attempted assassination. He was put on trial and given the maximum sentence. However, after a series of retrials his sentence was shortened and he eventually gained amnesty after only six years in jail.&lt;ref name="Caprio, Mark 2007"/&gt; During this time, he didn’t write down anything in his diaries, but his experience in the Japanese prison system seemed to have a significant effect on his actions after his release. In fact, his release can be seen as a turning point for Yun Chi-ho where he began to make many pro-Japanese statements and gives much less support to Korean nationalistic movements.&lt;ref name="Clark, Donald N 1945 pp 37-42"/&gt;

==March 1 Movement==
Inspired by Woodrow Wilson’s idea of “self-determination” presented at the Paris Peace Conference the previous year, on March 1, 1919 many Koreans took to the streets in a peaceful protest to demonstrate that Korea was ready for independence from Japan. Yun knew that the European nations would not take this demonstration seriously. Yun said the following about the movement:
“He who buys a field and keeps it from falling into irredeemable hands is a wiser patriot than he who sells his lands to finance the independent movement. He who sends a poor boy to school to become more intelligent than his fathers is doing a greater service than he who stirs up students for political agitations. He who leads an erring man into decent religious life is serving the Korean race better than he who sends ignorant folks to jail for yelling ‘mansei.’ Now is the time for Koreans to learn and wait.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Japanese Support==
Yun’s reversal in opinion took an even larger turn from his previous nationalistic rhetoric when he began supporting the Japanese war efforts during WWII. He urged the young men of Korea to help the Japanese to victory by assisting in the war effort. He celebrated as the Japanese pushed Western imperialist powers out of Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, Hyung-chan. “Portrait of a Troubled Korean Patriot: Yun Ch'i-ho's Views of the March First Independence Movement and World War II”. Korean Studies, Volume 13, 1989, pp. 76-91 (Article) Published by University of Hawai'i Press. DOI: 10.1353/ks.1989.0014&lt;/ref&gt; According to Yun the Korean people’s part in the Japanese Empire them opportunity and access to education and resources they previously never had. Yun said, “The intellectuals of Korea today all realize that destiny of the Korean people can be promoted by becoming one with the Japanese people and that Manchuria and North China have opened up a field for the development of the Korean people never before dreamed of.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=== Asia-Pacific War time ===
In 1936, outbreak of 'case of Suyang club'. he was all related person personal reference, release. that thim, he was endeavor of [[Ahn Chang-ho]]'s acquittal, also Ahn Chang-ho's file a petition. but refused of [[Japanese Government-General of Korea]].
