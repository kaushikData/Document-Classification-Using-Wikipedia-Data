'''1''' ('''one''', also called '''unit''', '''unity''', and '''(multiplicative) identity''') is a [[number]], [[Numeral (linguistics)|numeral]], and [[glyph]]. It represents a single entity, the [[unit (measurement)|unit]] of [[counting]] or [[measurement]]. For example, a [[line segment]] of ''unit length'' is a line segment of [[length]]&amp;nbsp;1. It is also the first of the [[sequence (mathematics)|infinite sequence]] of [[natural number]]s, followed by&amp;nbsp;[[2]].

== Etymology ==

The word ''one'' can be used as a noun, an adjective and a pronoun.&lt;ref name="etymonline"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=one |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |website=etymonline.com |publisher=Douglas Harper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It comes from the English word ''an'',&lt;ref name="etymonline" /&gt; which comes from the Proto-Germanic root ''*ainaz''.&lt;ref name="etymonline" /&gt; The Proto-Germanic root ''*ainaz'' comes from the Proto-Indo-European root ''*oi-no-''.&lt;ref name="etymonline" /&gt;

Compare the Proto-Germanic root ''*ainaz'' to [[Old Frisian]] ''an'', [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''ains'', [[Danish language|Danish]] ''en'', [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''een'', [[German language|German]] ''eins'' and [[Old Norse]] ''einn''.

Compare the Proto-Indo-European root ''*oi-no-'' (which means "one, single"&lt;ref name="etymonline" /&gt;) to [[Greek language|Greek]] ''oinos'' (which means "ace" on dice&lt;ref name="etymonline" /&gt;), [[Latin]] ''unus'' (one&lt;ref name="etymonline" /&gt;), [[Old Persian]] ''aivam'', [[Old Church Slavonic]] ''-inu'' and ''ino-'', [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] ''vienas'', [[Old Irish]] ''oin'' and [[Breton language|Breton]] ''un'' (one&lt;ref name="etymonline" /&gt;).

== As a number ==
One, sometimes referred to as '''unity''',&lt;ref&gt;Skoog, Douglas. ''Principles of Instrumental Analysis''. Brooks/Cole, 2007, p. 758.&lt;/ref&gt; is the first non-zero [[natural number]]. It is thus the [[integer]] before [[two]] and after [[zero]], and the first positive [[odd number]].

Any number multiplied by one remains that number, as one is the [[Identity element|identity]] for [[multiplication]]. As a result, 1 is its own [[factorial]], its own [[Square (algebra)|square]] and [[square root]], its own [[Cube (algebra)|cube]] and [[cube root]], and so on. One is also the result of the [[empty product]], as any number multiplied by one is itself. It is also the only natural number that is neither [[composite number|composite]] nor [[prime number|prime]] with respect to [[Division (mathematics)|division]], but instead considered a [[unit (ring theory)|unit]] (meaning of [[ring theory]]).

== As a digit ==
[[File:Evolution1glyph.svg|thumb|alt=Script progression from left to right: simple horizontal stroke, an upward-curved horizontal arc, another arc with a thick dot on left vertex, a sinewave-shaped upward then downward arc with dot on left, then a nearly-vertical version like a musical eighth-note with dot on top vertex, and finally a simple vertical stroke|left]]
The glyph used today in the Western world to represent the number 1, a vertical line, often with a [[serif]] at the top and sometimes a short horizontal line at the bottom, traces its roots back to the [[Indian subcontinent|Indians]], who wrote 1 as a horizontal line, much like the [[Written Chinese|Chinese]] character {{lang|zh|[[‰∏Ä]]}}. The [[Gupta script|Gupta]] wrote it as a curved line, and the [[Devanagari|Nagari]] sometimes added a small circle on the left (rotated a quarter turn to the right, this 9-look-alike became the present day numeral 1 in the [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] scripts). The [[Nepali language|Nepali]] also rotated it to the right but kept the circle small.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Georges |last=Ifrah |author2=others |title=The Universal History of Numbers: From Prehistory to the Invention of the Computer |display-authors=1 |translator-first=David |translator-last=Bellos |others=yes |place=London |publisher=The Harvill Press |year=1998 |page=392, Fig. 24.61}}&lt;/ref&gt; This eventually became the top serif in the modern numeral, but the occasional short horizontal line at the bottom probably originates from similarity with the [[Roman numeral]] {{math|I}}. In some countries, the serif at the top is sometimes extended into a long upstroke, sometimes as long as the vertical line, which can lead to confusion with the glyph for seven in other countries. Where the 1 is written with a long upstroke, the number 7 has a horizontal stroke through the vertical line.

While the shape of the 1 character has an [[Ascender (typography)|ascender]] in most modern [[typeface]]s, in typefaces with [[text figures]], the character usually is of [[x-height]], as, for example, in [[File:TextFigs148.svg|alt=Horizontal guidelines with a one fitting within lines, a four extending below guideline, and an eight poking above guideline]].

[[File:Clock 24 J.jpg|thumb|alt=Decorative clay/stone circular off-white sundial with bright gold stylized sunburst in center of 24 hour clock face, one through twelve clockwise on right, and one through twelve again clockwise on left, with J shapes where ones' digits would be expected when numbering the clock hours. Shadow suggests 3 PM toward lower left.|The 24-hour tower clock in [[Venice]], using ''J'' as a symbol for 1.]]
Many older typewriters do not have a separate symbol for ''1'' and use the lowercase letter ''l'' instead. It is possible to find cases when the uppercase ''J'' is used, while it may be for decorative purposes.

== Mathematics ==
Mathematically, 1 is:
*in [[arithmetic]] ([[algebra]]) and [[calculus]], the [[natural number]] that follows [[0 (number)|0]] and precedes [[2 (number)|2]] and the multiplicative [[identity element]] of the [[integer]]s, [[real number]]s and [[complex number]]s;
*more generally, in [[algebra]], the '''multiplicative identity''' (also called ''unity''), usually of a [[group (mathematics)|group]] or a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]].

[[Tally mark|Tallying]] is often referred to as "base 1", since only one mark&amp;nbsp;‚Äì the tally itself&amp;nbsp;‚Äì is needed. This is more formally referred to as a [[unary numeral system]]. Unlike [[base&amp;nbsp;2]] or [[base&amp;nbsp;10]], this is not a [[positional notation]].

Since the base 1 exponential function (1&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;) always equals 1, its [[inverse function|inverse]] does not exist (which would be called the [[logarithm]] base&amp;nbsp;1 if it did exist).

There are two ways to write the real number 1 as a [[recurring decimal]]: as 1.000..., and as [[0.999...]].

Formalizations of the natural numbers have their own representations of 1:
*in the [[Peano axioms]], 1 is the [[Successor function|successor]] of 0;
*in ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', 1 is defined as the set of all [[singleton (mathematics)|singletons]] (sets with one element);
*in the [[Von Neumann cardinal assignment]] of natural numbers, 1 is defined as the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] {0}.

In a multiplicative [[group (mathematics)|group]] or [[monoid]], the [[identity element]] is sometimes denoted 1, but ''e'' (from the German ''Einheit'', "unity") is also traditional. However, 1 is especially common for the multiplicative identity of a ring, i.e., when an addition and 0 are also present. When such a ring has [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] ''n'' not equal to 0, the element called 1 has the property that {{nowrap|''n''1 {{=}} 1''n'' {{=}} 0}} (where this 0 is the additive identity of the ring). Important examples are [[finite field]]s.

1 is the first [[figurate number]] of every kind, such as [[triangular number]], [[pentagonal number]] and [[centered hexagonal number]], to name just a few.

In many mathematical and engineering problems, numeric values are typically ''normalized'' to fall within the [[unit interval]] from 0 to 1, where 1 usually represents the maximum possible value in the range of parameters.  Likewise, [[vector space|vectors]] are often normalized to give [[unit vector]]s, that is vectors of magnitude one, because these often have more desirable properties. Functions, too, are often normalized by the condition that they have [[integral]] one, maximum value one, or [[square integrable|square integral]] one, depending on the application.

Because of the multiplicative identity, if ''f''(''x'') is a [[multiplicative function]], then ''f''(1) must equal 1.

It is also the first and second number in the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci]] sequence (0 is the zeroth) and is the first number in many other mathematical sequences.

1 is neither a [[prime number]] nor a [[composite number]], but a [[unit (ring theory)|unit]] (meaning of [[ring theory]]), like ‚àí1 and, in the [[Gaussian integers]], ''[[imaginary unit|i]]'' and ‚àí''i''. The [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]] guarantees [[factorization|unique factorization]] over the integers only up to units. (For example, {{nowrap|4 {{=}} 2{{sup|2}}}}, but if units are included, is also equal to, say, {{nowrap|(‚àí1){{sup|6}} √ó 1{{sup|23}} √ó 2{{sup|2}},}} among infinitely many similar "factorizations".)

The definition of a [[field (mathematics)|field]] requires that 1 must not be equal to [[zero|0]]. Thus, there are no fields of characteristic 1. Nevertheless, abstract algebra can consider the [[field with one element]], which is not a singleton and is not a set at all.

1 is the only positive integer divisible by exactly one positive integer (whereas prime numbers are divisible by exactly two positive integers, composite numbers are divisible by more than two positive integers, and zero is divisible by all positive integers). 1 was formerly considered prime by some mathematicians, using the definition that a prime is divisible only by 1 and itself. However, this complicates the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, so modern definitions exclude units.

By definition, 1 is the [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]], [[absolute value]], or [[Norm (mathematics)|norm]] of a [[unit complex number]], [[unit vector]], and a [[identity matrix|unit matrix]] (more usually called an identity matrix). Note that the term ''unit matrix'' is sometimes used to mean something [[Matrix of ones|quite different]].

By definition, 1 is the [[probability]] of an event that is [[almost certain]] to occur.

1 is the most common leading digit in many sets of data, a consequence of [[Benford's law]].

1 is the only known [[Tamagawa number]] for a simply connected algebraic group over a number field.

The [[generating function]] that has all coefficients 1 is given by

&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{1-x} = 1+x+x^2+x^3+ \ldots &lt;/math&gt;

This power series converges and has finite value [[if and only if]], &lt;math&gt; |x| &lt; 1 &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;!--Probably not needed, really should look at convergence theorem as there are other series that converge iff &lt;math&gt; |x| &lt; 1 &lt;/math&gt; --&gt;

In [[category theory]], 1 is sometimes used to denote the [[terminal object]] of a [[category (mathematics)|category]].

In [[Number theory|number theory]], 1 is the value of [[Legendre's constant]], which was introduced in 1808 by [[Adrien-Marie Legendre]] in expressing the [[Asymptotic analysis|asymptotic behavior]] of the [[prime-counting function]]. Legendre's constant was originally conjectured to be approximately 1.08366, but was proven to equal exactly 1 in 1899.

[[File:Kaskaskia Island 1993 flooding.jpg|thumb|[[Mississippi River]] at [[Kaskaskia, Illinois]] during the [[Great Flood of 1993]].]]
A '''one-hundred-year flood''' is a [[flood]] event that has a 1% probability of occurring in any given year.

The 100-year flood is also referred to as the 1% flood, since its annual exceedance probability is 1%.&lt;ref name="Holmes"&gt;Holmes, R.R., Jr., and Dinicola, K. (2010) ''100-Year flood‚Äìit's all about chance '' [http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/106/ U.S. Geological Survey General Information Product 106]&lt;/ref&gt;  For river systems, the 100-year flood is generally expressed as a flowrate.   Based on the expected 100-year flood flow rate, the flood [[water]] level can be mapped as an area of inundation.  The resulting [[floodplain]] map is referred to as the 100-year floodplain.  Estimates of the 100-year flood flowrate and other streamflow statistics for any stream in the United States are available.&lt;ref name="Ries"&gt;Ries, K.G., and others (2008) ''StreamStats: A water resources web application '' [http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2008/3067/ U.S. Geological Survey, Fact Sheet 2008-3067]  [http://water.usgs.gov/osw/streamstats/ Application home page] URL accessed 2015-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK The [[Environment Agency]] publishes a comprehensive map of all areas at risk of a 1 in 100 year flood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maps.environment-agency.gov.uk/wiyby/wiybyController?x=460730.0&amp;y=189442.0&amp;topic=floodmap&amp;ep=map&amp;scale=9&amp;location=OX10%200AJ&amp;lang=_e&amp;layerGroups=default&amp;distance=&amp;textonly=off|publisher=[[Environment Agency]]|title=Flood Map for Planning (Rivers and Sea)|access-date=25 August 2016|date=2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916225532/http://maps.environment-agency.gov.uk/wiyby/wiybyController?x=460730.0&amp;y=189442.0&amp;topic=floodmap&amp;ep=map&amp;scale=9&amp;location=OX10%200AJ&amp;lang=_e&amp;layerGroups=default&amp;distance=&amp;textonly=off|archive-date=2016-09-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Areas near the coast of an ocean or large lake also can be flooded by combinations of [[tide]], [[storm surge]], and [[wind wave|waves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coastal Flooding|url=https://www.floodsmart.gov/floodsmart/pages/coastal_flooding/cf_overview.jsp|website=FloodSmart|publisher=National Flood Insurance Program|accessdate=7 March 2016|ref=NFIP coastal|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308052549/https://www.floodsmart.gov/floodsmart/pages/coastal_flooding/cf_overview.jsp|archive-date=2016-03-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maps of the riverine or coastal 100-year floodplain may figure importantly in building permits, environmental regulations, and [[flood insurance]].

==Probability==
A common misunderstanding is that a 100-year flood is likely to occur only once in a 100-year period.  In fact, there is approximately a 63.4% chance of one or more 100-year floods occurring in any 100-year period. On the [[Danube]] River at [[Passau]], Germany, the actual intervals between 100-year floods during 1501 to 2013 ranged from 37 to 192 years.&lt;ref name="Eychaner"&gt;Eychaner, J.H. (2015) ''Lessons from a 500-year record of flood elevations  '' [http://www.floods.org/ace-files/documentlibrary/publications/asfpmpubs-techrep7_2015.pdf Association of State Floodplain Managers, Technical Report 7] URL accessed 2015-06-27.&lt;/ref&gt; The probability '''P&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''' that one or more floods occurring during any period will exceed a given flood threshold can be expressed, using the [[binomial distribution]], as

&lt;math&gt;P_{e}=1-\left[ 1-\left( \frac{1}{T} \right) \right]^{n}&lt;/math&gt;

where  '''T''' is the threshold [[return period]] (e.g. 100-yr, 50-yr, 25-yr, and so forth), and '''n''' is the number of years in the period. The [[probability of exceedance]] '''P&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''' is also described as the natural, inherent, or hydrologic risk of failure.&lt;ref name="Mays"&gt;Mays, L.W (2005) ''Water Resources Engineering, chapter 10, Probability, risk, and uncertainty analysis for hydrologic and hydraulic design'' Hoboken: J. Wiley &amp; Sons&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maidment"&gt;Maidment, D.R. ed.(1993) ''Handbook of Hydrology, chapter 18, Frequency analysis of extreme events''  New York: McGraw-Hill&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[expected value]] of the number of 100-year floods occurring in any 100-year period is 1.

Ten-year floods have a 10% chance of occurring in any given year (P&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; =0.10); 500-year have a 0.2% chance of occurring in any given year (P&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; =0.002); etc. The percent chance of an X-year flood occurring in a single year is 100/X. A similar analysis is commonly applied to [[coastal flood]]ing or rainfall data. The [[return period|recurrence interval]] of a storm is rarely identical to that of an associated riverine flood, because of rainfall timing and location variations among different [[drainage basin]]s.

The field of [[extreme value theory]] was created to model rare events such as 100-year floods for the purposes of civil engineering.  This theory is most commonly applied to the maximum or minimum observed stream flows of a given river. In desert areas where there are only ephemeral washes, this method is applied to the maximum observed rainfall over a given period of time (24-hours, 6-hours, or 3-hours). The extreme value analysis only considers the most extreme event observed in a given year. So, between the large spring runoff and a heavy summer rain storm, whichever resulted in more runoff would be considered the extreme event, while the smaller event would be ignored in the analysis (even though both may have been capable of causing terrible flooding in their own right).

==Statistical assumptions==

There are a number of [[Statistical assumption|assumptions]] which are made to complete the analysis which determines the 100-year flood. First, the extreme events observed in each year must be [[statistical independence|independent]] from year-to-year. In other words, the maximum river flow rate from 1984 cannot be found to be [[Statistical significance|significantly]] [[correlation and dependence|correlated]] with the observed flow rate in 1985.  1985 cannot be correlated with 1986, and so forth. The second assumption is that the observed extreme events must come from the same [[probability distribution function]]. The third assumption is that the probability distribution relates to the largest storm (rainfall or river flow rate measurement) that occurs in any one year. The fourth assumption is that the probability distribution function is stationary, meaning that the [[mean]] (average), [[standard deviation]] and [[Minima and maxima (introduction)|max/min]] values are not increasing or decreasing over time.  This concept is referred to as [[Stationary process|stationarity]].&lt;ref name="Maidment"/&gt;&lt;ref name="B17C"&gt;{{cite book |last1=England |first1=John |last2=and seven others |title=Guidelines for determining flood flow frequency‚ÄîBulletin 17C |date=29 March 2018 |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |url=https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/tm4B5 |accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first assumption is often but not always valid and should be tested on a case by case basis. The second assumption is often valid if the extreme events are observed under similar climate conditions. For example, if the extreme events on record all come from late summer thunder storms (as is the case in the southwest U.S.), or from snow pack melting (as is the case in north-central U.S.), then this assumption should be valid. If, however, there are some extreme events taken from thunder storms, others from snow pack melting, and others from hurricanes, then this assumption is most likely not valid. The third assumption is only a problem when trying to forecast a low, but maximum flow event (for example, an event smaller than a 2-year flood). Since this is not typically a goal in extreme analysis, or in civil engineering design, then the situation rarely presents itself. The final assumption about stationarity is difficult to test from data for a single site because of the large uncertainties in even the longest flood records&lt;ref name="Eychaner"/&gt; (see next section). More broadly, substantial evidence of [[climate change]] strongly suggests that the probability distribution is also changing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/319/5863/573.full |work=Science Magazine |title=Stationarity is Dead |publisher=Sciencemag.org |date=2008-02-01 |accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that managing flood risks in the future will become even more difficult.&lt;ref name=IPPC&gt;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2012) ''Managing the risks of extreme events and disasters to advance climate change adaptation,'' [http://ipcc-wg2.gov/SREX/images/uploads/SREX-SPMbrochure_FINAL.pdf Summary for policymakers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150719211442/http://ipcc-wg2.gov/SREX/images/uploads/SREX-SPMbrochure_FINAL.pdf |date=2015-07-19 }}  Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 19 p.&lt;/ref&gt; The simplest implication of this is that not all of the historical data are, or can be, considered valid as input into the extreme event analysis.

==Probability uncertainty==

When these assumptions are violated there is an ''unknown'' amount of uncertainty introduced into the reported value of what the 100-year flood means in terms of rainfall intensity, or flood depth. When all of the inputs are known the uncertainty can be measured in the form of a confidence interval. For example, one might say there is a 95% chance that the 100-year flood is greater than X, but less than Y.&lt;ref name="Holmes"/&gt;

Direct statistical analysis&lt;ref name="B17C"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ACWI"&gt;{{cite web |title=Bulletin 17C |url=https://acwi.gov/hydrology/Frequency/b17c/ |publisher=Advisory Committee on Water Information |accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to estimate the 100-year riverine flood is possible only at the relatively few locations where an annual series of maximum instantaneous flood discharges has been recorded. In the United States as of 2014, taxpayers have supported such records for at least 60 years at fewer than 2,600 locations, for at least 90 years at fewer than 500, and for at least 120 years at only 11.&lt;ref name="NWIS"&gt;[http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis ''National Water Information System database''] U.S. Geological Survey. URL accessed 2014-01-30.&lt;/ref&gt;  For comparison, the total area of the nation is about {{convert|3,800,000|sqmi|km2}}, so there are perhaps 3,000 stream reaches that drain watersheds of {{convert|1,000|sqmi|km2}} and 300,000 reaches that drain {{convert|10|sqmi|km2}}. In urban areas, 100-year flood estimates are needed for watersheds as small as {{convert|1|sqmi|km2}}. For reaches without sufficient data for direct analysis, 100-year flood estimates are derived from [[regression analysis|indirect statistical analysis]] of flood records at other locations in a hydrologically similar region or from other [[Hydrology#Modeling|hydrologic models]]. Similarly for coastal floods, [[tide gauge]] data exist for only about 1,450 sites worldwide, of which only about 950 added information to the global data center between January 2010 and March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Obtaining Tide Gauge Data|url=http://www.psmsl.org/data/obtaining/|website=Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level|publisher=PSMSL|accessdate=7 March 2016|ref=PSMSL_data}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Passau flood scale Sept 2012.JPG|thumb|High-water scale 1501-2002 at [[Passau|Passau, Germany]], as of September 2012]]
Much longer records of flood elevations exist at a few locations around the world, such as the [[Danube]] River at [[Passau]], Germany,  but they must be evaluated carefully for accuracy and completeness before any statistical interpretation.

For an individual stream reach, the uncertainties in any analysis can be large, so 100-year flood estimates have large individual uncertainties for most stream reaches.&lt;ref name="Eychaner"/&gt;{{rp|24}}  For the largest recorded flood at any specific location, or any potentially larger event, the recurrence interval always is poorly known.&lt;ref name="Eychaner"/&gt;{{rp|20,24}}  Spatial variability adds more uncertainty, because a flood peak observed at different locations on the same stream during the same event commonly represents a different recurrence interval at each location.&lt;ref name="Eychaner"/&gt;{{rp|20}}  If an extreme storm drops enough rain on one branch of a river to cause a 100-year flood, but no rain falls over another branch, the flood wave downstream from their junction might have a recurrence interval of only 10 years. Conversely, a storm that produces a 25-year flood simultaneously in each branch might form a 100-year flood downstream. During a time of flooding, news accounts necessarily simplify the story by reporting the greatest damage and largest recurrence interval estimated at any location. The public can easily and incorrectly conclude that the recurrence interval applies to all stream reaches in the flood area.&lt;ref name="Eychaner"/&gt;{{rp|7,24}}

==Observed intervals between floods==
Peak elevations of 14 floods as early as 1501 on the [[Danube]] River at [[Passau]], Germany, reveal great variability in the actual intervals between floods.&lt;ref name="Eychaner"/&gt;{{rp|16‚Äì19}}  Flood events greater than the 50-year flood occurred at intervals of 4 to 192 years since 1501, and the 50-year flood of 2002 was followed only 11 years later by a 500-year flood. Only half of the intervals between 50- and 100-year floods were within 50 percent of the nominal average interval. Similarly, the intervals between 5-year floods during 1955 to 2007 ranged from 5 months to 16 years, and only half  were within 2.5 to 7.5 years.
[[File:Passau flood history.svg|thumb|left|Observed intervals between floods at Passau, 1501-2013]]

==Regulatory use==
In the United States, the 100-year flood provides the risk basis for [[flood insurance]] rates. Complete information on the [[National Flood Insurance Program]] (NFIP) is available [http://www.floodsmart.gov/ here.] A ''regulatory flood'' or ''base flood'' is routinely established for river reaches through a science-based rule-making process targeted to a 100-year flood at the historical average recurrence interval. In addition to historical flood data, the process accounts for previously established regulatory values, the effects of flood-control reservoirs, and changes in land use in the watershed. [[Coastal flood]] hazards have been mapped by a similar approach that includes the relevant physical processes. Most areas where serious floods can occur in the United States have been mapped consistently in this manner. On average nationwide, those 100-year flood estimates are well sufficient for the purposes of the NFIP and offer reasonable estimates of future flood risk, if the future is like the past.&lt;ref name="Eychaner"/&gt;{{rp|24}} Approximately 3% of the U.S. population lives in areas subject to the 1% annual chance coastal flood hazard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crowell|first1=Mark|last2=others|title=An estimate of the U.S. population living in 100-year coastal flood hazard areas|journal=Journal of Coastal Research|date=2010|volume=26|issue=2|pages=201‚Äì211|doi=10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-09-00076.1|url=http://www.floods.org/PDF/JCR_Est_US_Pop_100y_CFHA_2010.pdf|accessdate=6 March 2016|ref=Crowell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In theory, removing homes and businesses from areas that flood repeatedly can protect people and reduce insurance losses, but in practice it is difficult for people to retreat from established neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="schwartz"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schwartz |first1=Jen |title=Surrendering to rising seas |journal=Scientific American |date=1 August 2018 |volume=319 |issue=2 |pages=44-55 |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/surrendering-to-rising-seas/ |accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alex James Wilkie''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (born 1948 in  [[Northampton]]&lt;ref&gt;Wilkie, Alex James, Who's Who in Education,Inglewood Books, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[mathematician]] known for his contributions to [[Model theory]] and [[Mathematical logic|logic]]. Previously Reader in Mathematical Logic at the [[University of Oxford]],  he was appointed to  the [[Fielden Chair of Pure Mathematics]] at the [[School of Mathematics, University of Manchester|University of Manchester]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manchester.ac.uk/research/alex.wilkie/ Research profile of Alex Wilkie at Manchester]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/~awilkie/ Home page of Alex Wilkie at Manchester]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mathgene&gt;{{MathGenealogy |id=43944}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{AcademicSearch|id=12524356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Alex Wilkie attended [[Aylesbury Grammar School]] and went on to gain his  BSc in mathematics with first class honours from [[University College London]] in 1969, his  MSc (in mathematical logic) from the [[University of London]] in 1970, and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] from the [[Bedford College, University of London]] in 1973 under the supervision of [[Wilfrid Hodges]] with a dissertation titled ''Models of Number Theory''. 

==Career and research==
After his PhD he went on to an appointment as a lecturer in mathematics at [[Leicester University]] from 1972 to 1973, then a research fellow  at the [[Open University]] from 1973 until 1978. He spent two periods as a junior lecturer in mathematics at [[Oxford University]] (1978‚Äì80 and 1981-2) with (1980-1) as a visiting assistant professor at [[Yale University]].  In 1980 Wilkie solved [[Tarski's high school algebra problem]].

In October 1982 Wilkie was appointed as a research fellow in the department of mathematics at the [[University of Paris VII]], then returned to England the following year to take up a three-year  SERC (now [[EPSRC]]) advanced research fellowship at the  University of Manchester. After two years he was appointed lecturer in the Department of Mathematics. In 1986 he went on to Oxford where he was appointed to the readership in mathematical logic there which had become vacant upon the retirement of [[Robin Gandy]]. He remained in this post until appointment to the Fielden Chair at Manchester.

==Awards and honours==
Wilkie was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society|Fellow]] of the [[Royal Society]] in 2001. To quote the citation
:''Wilkie has combined logical techniques and differential-geometric techniques to establish fundamental Finiteness Theorems for sets definable using the exponential function, and more general [[Pfaffian function]]s. The results, going far beyond those obtained by conventional methods, have already had striking applications to Lie groups.''&lt;ref&gt;NOTICES, Bulletin of Symbolic Logic, Vol 7, No 3, p436, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilkie received the [[Karp Prize|Carol Karp Prize]] (the highest award made by the [[Association for Symbolic Logic]], every five years) jointly with [[Ehud Hrushovski]] in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;NOTICES Carol Karp Prize, J. Symbolic logic, Volume 58, Number 2, June 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=karpprize&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aslonline.org/Karp_recipients.html |title=Karp Prize Recipients | publisher=[[Association for Symbolic Logic]] |accessdate=10 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He  was elected to the Council of the [[London Mathematical Society]] in 2007, vice-president of the Association for Symbolic Logic (2006) and president of the Association for Symbolic Logic in 2009. In 2012 he became a fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved 2013-09-01.&lt;/ref&gt; He received the Karp Prize again in 2013, jointly with Moti Gitik, Ya'acov Peterzil, [[Jonathan Pila]], and Sergei Starchenko.&lt;ref name=karpprize /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7746">In [[mathematical physics]], the '''almost Mathieu operator'''&lt;!--, named after [[?????? Mathieu]], --&gt; arises in the study of the [[quantum Hall effect]]. It is given by
: &lt;math&gt; [H^{\lambda,\alpha}_\omega u](n) = u(n+1) + u(n-1) + 2 \lambda \cos(2\pi (\omega + n\alpha)) u(n), \, &lt;/math&gt;

acting as a [[self-adjoint operator]] on the Hilbert space &lt;math&gt;\ell^2(\mathbb{Z})&lt;/math&gt;. Here &lt;math&gt;\alpha,\omega \in\mathbb{T}, \lambda &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; are parameters. In [[pure mathematics]], its importance comes from the fact of being one of the best-understood examples of an [[ergodic]] [[Schr√∂dinger operator]].  For example, three problems (now all solved) of [[Barry Simon]]'s fifteen problems about Schr√∂dinger operators "for the twenty-first century" featured the almost Mathieu operator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Barry |last=Simon |chapter=Schr√∂dinger operators in the twenty-first century |title=Mathematical Physics 2000 |pages=283‚Äì288 |publisher=Imp. Coll. Press |location=London |year=2000 |isbn=978-1860942303 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For &lt;math&gt;\lambda = 1&lt;/math&gt;, the almost Mathieu operator is sometimes called '''Harper's equation'''.

==The spectral type==
If &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a [[rational number]], then &lt;math&gt;H^{\lambda,\alpha}_\omega&lt;/math&gt;
is a periodic operator and by [[Floquet theory]] its [[spectrum (functional analysis)|spectrum]] is purely [[absolutely continuous]].

Now to the case when &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is [[Irrational number|irrational]].
Since the transformation &lt;math&gt; \omega \mapsto \omega + \alpha &lt;/math&gt; is minimal, it follows that the spectrum of &lt;math&gt;H^{\lambda,\alpha}_\omega&lt;/math&gt; does not depend on &lt;math&gt; \omega &lt;/math&gt;. On the other hand, by ergodicity, the supports of absolutely continuous, singular continuous, and pure point parts of the spectrum are almost surely independent of &lt;math&gt; \omega &lt;/math&gt;.
It is now known, that
*For &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; \lambda &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;H^{\lambda,\alpha}_\omega&lt;/math&gt; has surely purely absolutely continuous spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |first=A. |last=Avila |year=2008 |title=The absolutely continuous spectrum of the almost Mathieu operator |journal= |eprint=0810.2965|class=math.DS }}&lt;/ref&gt; (This was one of Simon's problems.)
*For &lt;math&gt;\lambda= 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;H^{\lambda,\alpha}_\omega&lt;/math&gt; has almost surely purely singular continuous spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gordon |first=A.

That the spectral measures are singular when &lt;math&gt; \lambda \geq 1 &lt;/math&gt; follows (through the work of Last and Simon)
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Y. |last=Last |first2=B. |last2=Simon |title=Eigenfunctions, transfer matrices, and absolutely continuous spectrum of one-dimensional Schr√∂dinger operators |journal=[[Inventiones Mathematicae|Invent.

from the lower bound on the [[Lyapunov exponent]] &lt;math&gt;\gamma(E)&lt;/math&gt; given by
: &lt;math&gt; \gamma(E) \geq \max \{0,\log(\lambda)\}. \, &lt;/math&gt;

This lower bound was proved independently by Avron, Simon and [[Michael Herman (mathematician)|Michael Herman]], after an earlier almost rigorous argument of Aubry and Andr√©.  In fact, when &lt;math&gt; E &lt;/math&gt; belongs to the spectrum, the inequality becomes an equality (the Aubry‚ÄìAndr√© formula), proved by [[Jean Bourgain]] and [[Svetlana Jitomirskaya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. |last=Bourgain |first2=S. |last2=Jitomirskaya |title=Continuity of the Lyapunov exponent for quasiperiodic operators with analytic potential |journal=[[Journal of Statistical Physics]] |volume=108 |year=2002 |issue=5‚Äì6 |pages=1203‚Äì1218 |doi=10.1023/A:1019751801035 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The structure of the spectrum==
[[Image:Hofstadter's_butterfly.png|thumb|Hofstadter's butterfly]]

Another striking characteristic of the almost Mathieu operator is that its spectrum is a [[Cantor set]] for all irrational &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. This was shown by [[Artur Avila|Avila]] and [[Svetlana Jitomirskaya|Jitomirskaya]] solving the by-then famous "ten martini problem"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=A. |last=Avila |first2=S. |last2=Jitomirskaya |title=The Ten Martini problem |journal= |volume=690 |pages=5‚Äì16 |year=2005 |arxiv=math/0503363 |bibcode=2006LNP...690....5A |doi=10.1007/3-540-34273-7_2 |chapter=Solving the Ten Martini Problem |series=Lecture Notes in Physics |isbn=978-3-540-31026-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (also one of Simon's problems) after several earlier results (including generically&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. |last=Bellissard |first2=B. |last2=Simon |title=Cantor spectrum for the almost Mathieu equation |journal=[[Journal of Functional Analysis|J. Funct. Anal.]] |volume=48 |year=1982 |issue=3 |pages=408‚Äì419 |doi=10.1016/0022-1236(82)90094-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and almost surely&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Puig |first=Joaquim |title=Cantor spectrum for the almost Mathieu operator |journal=Comm.

Furthermore, the [[Lebesgue measure]] of the spectrum of the almost Mathieu operator is known to be
: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Leb}(\sigma(H^{\lambda,\alpha}_\omega)) = |4 - 4 \lambda| \, &lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;\lambda &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt; \lambda = 1 &lt;/math&gt; this means that the spectrum has zero measure (this was first proposed by [[Douglas Hofstadter]] and later became one of Simon's problems&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=A. |last=Avila |first2=R. |last2=Krikorian |title=Reducibility or non-uniform hyperbolicity for quasiperiodic Schr√∂dinger cocycles |journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]] |volume=164 |year=2006 |issue=3 |pages=911‚Äì940 |doi=10.4007/annals.2006.164.911 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). For &lt;math&gt; \lambda \neq 1 &lt;/math&gt;, the formula was discovered numerically by Aubry and Andr√© and proved by Jitomirskaya and Krasovsky.

The study of the spectrum for &lt;math&gt; \lambda =1 &lt;/math&gt; leads to the [[Hofstadter's butterfly]], where the spectrum is shown as a set.

In [[mathematics]],  '''antiholomorphic functions''' (also called '''antianalytic functions''') are a family of  [[Function (mathematics)|function]]s closely related to but distinct from [[holomorphic function]]s.

A function of the complex variable z defined on an [[open set]] in the [[complex plane]] is said to be '''antiholomorphic''' if its [[derivative]] with respect to {{overline|''z''}} exists in the neighbourhood of each and every point in that set, where {{overline|''z''}} is the [[complex conjugate]]. 

One can show that if ''f''(''z'') is a [[holomorphic function]] on an open set ''D'', then ''f''({{overline|''z''}}) is an antiholomorphic function on {{overline|''D''}}, where {{overline|''D''}} is the reflection against the ''x''-axis of ''D'', or in other words, {{overline|''D''}} is the set of complex conjugates of elements of ''D''. Moreover, any antiholomorphic function can be obtained in this manner from a holomorphic function. This implies that a function is antiholomorphic [[if and only if]] it can be expanded in a [[power series]] in {{overline|''z''}} in a neighborhood of each point in its domain.

If a function is both holomorphic and antiholomorphic, then it is constant on any [[connected space|connected component]] of its domain.

In [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] [[mathematics]], the '''Bell polynomials''', named in honor of [[Eric Temple Bell]], are used in the study of set partitions. They are related to [[Stirling numbers|Stirling]] and [[Bell numbers]]. They also occur in many applications, such as in the [[Fa√† di Bruno's formula]].

==Bell polynomials==

===Exponential Bell polynomials===
The ''partial'' or ''incomplete'' exponential Bell polynomials are a [[triangular array]] of polynomials given by

:&lt;math&gt;B_{n,k}(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_{n-k+1}) = \sum{n! \over j_1!j_2!\cdots j_{n-k+1}!}
\left({x_1\over 1!}\right)^{j_1}\left({x_2\over 2!}\right)^{j_2}\cdots\left({x_{n-k+1} \over (n-k+1)!}\right)^{j_{n-k+1}},&lt;/math&gt;

where the sum is taken over all sequences ''j''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''j''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''j''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''j''&lt;sub&gt;''n''‚àí''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt; of non-negative integers such that these two conditions are satisfied:

:&lt;math&gt;j_1 + j_2 + \cdots + j_{n-k+1} = k, &lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;j_1 + 2 j_2 + 3 j_3 + \cdots + (n-k+1)j_{n-k+1} = n.&lt;/math&gt;

The sum

:&lt;math&gt;B_n(x_1,\dots,x_n)=\sum_{k=1}^n B_{n,k}(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_{n-k+1})&lt;/math&gt;

is called the ''n''th '''complete exponential Bell polynomial'''.

===Ordinary Bell polynomials===
Likewise, the partial ''ordinary'' Bell polynomial, in contrast to the usual exponential Bell polynomial defined above, is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{B}_{n,k}(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_{n-k+1}) = \sum \frac{k!}{j_1! j_2! \cdots j_{n-k+1}!} x_1^{j_1} x_2^{j_2} \cdots x_{n-k+1}^{j_{n-k+1}}, &lt;/math&gt;

where the sum runs over all sequences ''j''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''j''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''j''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''j''&lt;sub&gt;''n''‚àí''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt; of non-negative integers such that

:&lt;math&gt;j_1 + j_2 + \cdots + j_{n-k+1} = k,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;j_1 + 2 j_2 + \cdots + (n-k+1)j_{n-k+1} = n.&lt;/math&gt;

The ordinary Bell polynomials can be expressed in the terms of exponential Bell polynomials:
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{B}_{n,k}(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_{n-k+1}) = \frac{k!}{n!}B_{n,k}(1!\cdot x_1,2!\cdot x_2,\ldots,(n-k+1)!\cdot x_{n-k+1}).&lt;/math&gt;

In general, Bell polynomial refers to the exponential Bell polynomial, unless otherwise explicitly stated.

==Combinatorial meaning==

The exponential Bell polynomial encodes the information related to the ways a set can be partitioned. For example, if we consider a set {A, B, C}, it can be partitioned into two non-empty, non-overlapping subsets, which is also referred to as parts or blocks, in 3 different ways:

:{{A}, {B, C}}
:{{B}, {A, C}}
:{{C}, {B, A}}

Thus, we can encode the information regarding these partitions as

:&lt;math&gt;B_{3,2}(x_1,x_2) = 3 x_1 x_2. &lt;/math&gt;

Here, the subscripts of ''B''&lt;sub&gt;3,2&lt;/sub&gt; tells us that we are considering the partitioning of set with 3 elements into 2 blocks. The subscript of each ''x''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; indicates the presence of block with ''i'' elements (or block of size ''i'') in a given partition. So here, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; indicates the presence of a block with two elements. Similarly, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; indicates the presence of a block with a single element. The exponent of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt; indicates that there are ''j'' such blocks of size ''i'' in a single partition. Here, since both ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has exponent 1, it indicates that there is only one such block in a given partition. The coefficient of the [[monomial]] indicates how many such partitions there are. For our case, there are 3 partitions of a set with 3 elements into 2 blocks, where in each partition the elements are divided into two blocks of sizes 1 and 2.

Since any set can be divided into a single block in only one way, the above interpretation would mean that ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n'',1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. Similarly, since there is only one way that a set with ''n'' elements be divided into ''n'' singletons, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n'',''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

As a more complicated example, consider

:&lt;math&gt;B_{6,2}(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5)=6x_5x_1+15x_4x_2+10x_3^2.&lt;/math&gt;

This tells us that if a set with 6 elements is divided into 2 blocks, then we can have 6 partitions with blocks of size 1 and 5, 15 partitions with blocks of size 4 and 2, and 10 partitions with 2 blocks of size 3.

Note that the sum of the subscripts in a monomials is equal to the total number of elements. Thus, the number of monomials that appear in the partial Bell polynomial is equal to the number of ways the integer ''n'' can be expressed as a summation of ''k'' positive integers. This is the same as the [[integer partition]] of ''n'' into ''k'' parts. For instance, in the above examples, the integer 3 can be partitioned into two parts as 2+1 only. Thus, there is only one monomial in ''B''&lt;sub&gt;3,2&lt;/sub&gt;. However, the integer 6 can be partitioned into two parts as 5+1, 4+2, and 3+3. Thus, there are three monomials in ''B''&lt;sub&gt;6,2&lt;/sub&gt;.  Indeed, the subscripts of the variables in a monomial are the same as those given by the integer partition, indicating the sizes of the different blocks. The total number of monomials appearing in a complete Bell polynomial ''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is thus equal to the total number of integer partitions of&amp;nbsp;''n''.

Also note that the degree of each monomial, which is the sum of the exponents of each variable in the monomial, is equal to the number of blocks the set is divided into. That is, ''j''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''j''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... = ''k'' . Thus, given a complete Bell polynomial ''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', we can separate the partial Bell polynomial ''B&lt;sub&gt;n,k&lt;/sub&gt;'' by collecting all those monomials with degree ''k''.

Finally, if we disregard the sizes of the blocks and put all ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x'', then the summation of the coefficients of the partial Bell polynomial ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n'',''k''&lt;/sub&gt; will give the total number of ways that a set with ''n'' elements can be partitioned into ''k'' blocks, which is the same as the [[Stirling numbers of the second kind]]. Also, the summation of all the coefficients of the complete Bell polynomial ''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' will give us the total number of ways a set with ''n'' elements can be partitioned into non-overlapping subsets, which is the same as the Bell number.

In general, if the integer ''n'' is [[integer partition|partitioned]] into a sum in which "1" appears ''j''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; times, "2" appears ''j''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; times, and so on, then the number of [[partition of a set|partitions of a set]] of size ''n'' that collapse to that partition of the integer ''n'' when the members of the set become indistinguishable is the corresponding coefficient in the polynomial.

===Examples===

For example, we have

:&lt;math&gt;B_{6,2}(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5)=6x_5x_1+15x_4x_2+10x_3^2&lt;/math&gt;

because there are

:6 ways to partition a set of 6 as 5&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1,
:15 ways to partition a set of 6 as 4&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2, and

Similarly,

because there are

==Properties==

===Generating function===
The exponential partial Bell polynomials can be defined by the double series expansion of its generating function:

:&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
\Phi(t,u) &amp;= \exp\left( u \sum_{j=1}^\infty x_j \frac{t^j}{j!} \right) = \sum_{n,k \geq 0} B_{n,k}(x_1,\ldots,x_{n-k+1}) \frac{t^n}{n!} u^k\\
 &amp;= 1 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{t^n}{n!} \left\{ \sum_{k=1}^n u^k B_{n,k}(x_1,\ldots,x_{n-k+1})\right\}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, by what amounts to the same, by the series expansion of the exponential:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{k!}\left( \sum_{j=1}^\infty x_j \frac{t^j}{j!} \right)^k = \sum_{n=k}^\infty B_{n,k}(x_1,\ldots,x_{n-k+1}) \frac{t^n}{n!}, \qquad k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots  &lt;/math&gt;
 
The complete exponential Bell polynomial is defined by &lt;math&gt;\Phi(t,1)&lt;/math&gt;, or in other words:

:&lt;math&gt; \Phi(t,1) = \exp\left( \sum_{j=1}^\infty x_j \frac{t^j}{j!} \right) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty B_n(x_1,\ldots, x_n) \frac{t^n}{n!}.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the ''n''-th complete Bell polynomial is given by
:&lt;math&gt; B_n(x_1,\ldots, x_n) = \left. \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\right)^n \exp\left( \sum_{j=1}^\infty x_j \frac{t^j}{j!} \right) \right|_{t=0}. &lt;/math&gt;

Likewise, the ''ordinary'' partial Bell polynomial can be defined by the generating function
:&lt;math&gt; \hat{\Phi}(t,u) = \exp \left( u \sum_{j=1}^\infty x_j t^j \right) = \sum_{k \leq n} \hat{B}_{n,k}(x_1,\ldots,x_{n-k+1}) t^n \frac{u^k}{k!}.&lt;/math&gt;

Or, equivalently, by series expansion of the exponential

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\sum_{j=1}^\infty x_j t^j\right)^k = \sum_{n=k}^\infty \hat{B}_{n,k}(x_1, \ldots, x_{n-k+1}) t^n. &lt;/math&gt;

See also [[Generating_function_transformation#Powers_of_an_OGF_and_composition_with_functions|generating function transformations]] for Bell polynomial generating function expansions of compositions of sequence [[generating functions]] and [[Exponentiation|powers]], [[logarithm]]s, and [[exponential function|exponentials]] of a sequence generating function. Each of these formulas is cited in the respective sections of Comtet.

===Recurrence relations===

The complete Bell polynomials can be [[Recurrence relation|recurrently]] defined as
:&lt;math&gt; B_{n+1}(x_1, \ldots, x_{n+1}) = \sum_{i=0}^n {n \choose i} B_{n-i}(x_1, \ldots, x_{n-i}) x_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt;
with the initial value &lt;math&gt;B_0 = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

The partial Bell polynomials can also be computed efficiently by a recurrence relation:
:&lt;math&gt; B_{n,k} = \sum_{i=1}^{n-k+1} \binom{n-1}{i-1} x_i B_{n-i,k-1},&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt; B_{0,0} = 1; &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; B_{n,0} = 0 \text{ for } n \geq 1; &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; B_{0,k} = 0 \text{ for } k \geq 1. &lt;/math&gt;

The complete Bell polynomials also satisfy the following recurrence differential formula:{{Sfn|Alexeev|Pologova|Alekseyev|2017|loc=sect. 4.2}}
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
B_n(x_1, \ldots, x_n) = \frac{1}{n-1} \left[ \sum_{i=2}^n \right. &amp; \sum_{j=1}^{i-1} (i-1) \binom{i-2}{j-1} x_j x_{i-j}\frac{\partial B_{n-1}(x_1,\dots,x_{n-1})}{\partial x_{i-1}} \\[5pt]
&amp; \left. {} + \sum_{i=2}^n \sum_{j=1}^{i-1} \frac{x_{i+1}}{\binom i j} \frac{\partial^2 B_{n-1}(x_1,\dots,x_{n-1})}{\partial x_j \partial x_{i-j}} \right. \\[5pt]
&amp; \left. {} + \sum_{i=2}^n x_i \frac{\partial B_{n-1}(x_1,\dots,x_{n-1})}{\partial x_{i-1}} \right].
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Determinant form===

The complete Bell polynomial can be expressed as a [[determinant]]:

:&lt;math&gt;B_n(x_1,\dots,x_n) = \det\begin{bmatrix}x_1 &amp; {n-1 \choose 1} x_2 &amp; {n-1 \choose 2}x_3 &amp; {n-1 \choose 3} x_4 &amp; {n-1 \choose 4} x_5 &amp; \cdots &amp; \cdots &amp; x_n \\  \\
-1 &amp; x_1 &amp; {n-2 \choose 1} x_2 &amp; {n-2 \choose 2} x_3 &amp; {n-2 \choose 3} x_4 &amp; \cdots &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{n-1} \\  \\
0 &amp; -1 &amp; x_1 &amp; {n-3 \choose 1} x_2 &amp; {n-3 \choose 2} x_3 &amp; \cdots &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{n-2} \\  \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; x_1 &amp; {n-4 \choose 1} x_2 &amp; \cdots  &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{n-3} \\  \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; x_1 &amp; \cdots &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{n-4} \\  \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; \cdots &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{n-5} \\  \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp;  \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots  \\  \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; -1 &amp; x_1  \end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Stirling numbers and Bell numbers===

The value of the Bell polynomial ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n'',''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...) on the sequence of [[factorial]]s equals an unsigned [[Stirling number of the first kind]]:

:&lt;math&gt;B_{n,k}(0!,1!,\dots,(n-k)!)=c(n,k)=|s(n,k)| = \left[{n\atop k}\right].&lt;/math&gt;

The value of the Bell polynomial ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n'',''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...) on the sequence of ones equals a [[Stirling number of the second kind]]:
:&lt;math&gt;B_{n,k}(1,1,\dots,1)=S(n,k)=\left\{{n\atop k}\right\}.&lt;/math&gt;
The sum of these values gives the value of the complete Bell polynomial on the sequence of ones:
:&lt;math&gt;B_n(1,1,\dots,1)=\sum_{k=1}^n B_{n,k}(1,1,\dots,1) = \sum_{k=1}^n \left\{{n\atop k}\right\},&lt;/math&gt;
which is the ''n''th [[Bell number]].

===Inverse relations===
If we define

:&lt;math&gt;y_n = \sum_{k=1}^n B_{n,k}(x_1,\ldots,x_{n-k+1}),&lt;/math&gt;

then we have the inverse relationship

:&lt;math&gt;x_n = \sum_{k=1}^n (-1)^{k-1} (k-1)! B_{n,k}(y_1,\ldots,y_{n-k+1}).&lt;/math&gt;

===Touchard polynomials===

{{main|Touchard polynomials}}

Touchard polynomial &lt;math&gt;T_n(x) = \sum_{k=0}^n \left\{{n\atop k}\right\}\cdot x^k&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as the value of the complete Bell polynomial on all arguments being ''x'':
: &lt;math&gt;T_n(x) = B_n(x,x,\dots,x).&lt;/math&gt;

===Convolution identity===

For sequences ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n'' = 1, 2, ..., define a sort of [[convolution]] by:

:&lt;math&gt;(x \mathbin{\diamondsuit} y)_n = \sum_{j=1}^{n-1} {n \choose j} x_j y_{n-j}.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the bounds of summation are 1 and ''n''&amp;nbsp;‚àí&amp;nbsp;1, not 0 and ''n'' .

Let &lt;math&gt;x_n^{k\diamondsuit}\,&lt;/math&gt; be the ''n''th term of the sequence

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\underbrace{x\mathbin{\diamondsuit}\cdots\mathbin{\diamondsuit} x}_{k \text{ factors}}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Then

:&lt;math&gt;B_{n,k}(x_1,\dots,x_{n-k+1}) = {x_n^{k\diamondsuit} \over k!}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

For example, let us compute &lt;math&gt; B_{4,3}(x_1,x_2) &lt;/math&gt;.  We have

:&lt;math&gt; x = ( x_1 \ , \ x_2 \ , \ x_3 \ , \ x_4 \ , \dots ) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; x \mathbin{\diamondsuit} x = ( 0,\  2 x_1^2 \ ,\  6 x_1 x_2 \ , \  8 x_1 x_3 + 6 x_2^2 \ , \dots ) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; x \mathbin{\diamondsuit} x \mathbin{\diamondsuit} x = (  0 \ ,\ 0 \  , \ 6 x_1^3 \ , \ 36 x_1^2 x_2 \ , \dots ) &lt;/math&gt;

and thus,

:&lt;math&gt; B_{4,3}(x_1,x_2) = \frac{ ( x \mathbin{\diamondsuit} x \mathbin{\diamondsuit} x)_4 }{3!} = 6 x_1^2 x_2. &lt;/math&gt;

==Other identities==

* &lt;math&gt;B_{n,k}(1!,2!,\ldots,(n-k+1)!) = \binom{n-1}{k-1} \frac{n!}{k!} = L(n,k)&lt;/math&gt; which gives the [[Lah number]].

* &lt;math&gt;B_{n,k}(1,2,3,\ldots,n-k+1) = \binom{n}{k} k^{n-k} &lt;/math&gt; which gives the [[Idempotence|idempotent number]].

* The complete Bell polynomials satisfy the binomial type relation:
*:&lt;math&gt; B_n(x_1 + y_1, \ldots, x_n + y_n) = \sum_{i=0}^n {n \choose i} B_{n-i}(x_1, \ldots, x_{n-i})B_i(y_1, \ldots, y_i).&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==

The first few complete Bell polynomials are:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
B_0 = {} &amp; 1, \\[8pt] 
B_1(x_1) = {} &amp; x_1, \\[8pt]
B_2(x_1,x_2) = {} &amp; x_1^2 + x_2, \\[8pt]
B_3(x_1,x_2,x_3) = {} &amp; x_1^3 + 3x_1 x_2 + x_3, \\[8pt]
B_4(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4) = {} &amp; x_1^4 + 6 x_1^2 x_2 + 4 x_1 x_3 + 3 x_2^2 + x_4, \\[8pt]
B_5(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5) = {} &amp; x_1^5 + 10 x_2 x_1^3 + 15 x_2^2 x_1 + 10 x_3 x_1^2 + 10 x_3 x_2 + 5 x_4 x_1 + x_5 \\[8pt]
B_6(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5,x_6) = {} &amp; x_1^6 + 15 x_2 x_1^4 + 20 x_3 x_1^3 + 45 x_2^2 x_1^2 + 15 x_2^3 + 60 x_3 x_2 x_1 \\
&amp; {} + 15 x_4 x_1^2 + 10 x_3^2 + 15 x_4 x_2 + 6 x_5 x_1 + x_6, \\[8pt]
B_7(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5,x_6,x_7) = {} &amp; x_1^7 + 21 x_1^5 x_2 + 35 x_1^4 x_3 + 105 x_1^3 x_2^2 + 35 x_1^3 x_4 \\
&amp; {} + 210 x_1^2 x_2 x_3 + 105 x_1 x_2^3 + 21 x_1^2 x_5 + 105 x_1 x_2 x_4 \\
&amp; {} + 70 x_1 x_3^2 + 105 x_2^2 x_3 + 7 x_1 x_6 + 21 x_2 x_5 + 35 x_3 x_4 + x_7. 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==

===Fa√† di Bruno's formula===
{{main|Fa√† di Bruno's formula}}

[[Fa√† di Bruno's formula]] may be stated in terms of Bell polynomials as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;{d^n \over dx^n} f(g(x)) = \sum_{k=1}^n f^{(k)}(g(x)) B_{n,k} \left(g'(x),g''(x), \dots, g^{(n-k+1)}(x)\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, a power-series version of Fa√† di Bruno's formula may be stated using Bell polynomials as follows.  Suppose

:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty {a_n \over n!} x^n \qquad \text{and} \qquad g(x) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty {b_n \over n!} x^n.&lt;/math&gt;

Then

:&lt;math&gt;g(f(x)) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty
\frac{\sum_{k=1}^n b_k B_{n,k}(a_1,\dots,a_{n-k+1})}{n!} x^n.&lt;/math&gt;

In particular, the complete Bell polynomials appear in the exponential of a [[formal power series]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\exp\left(\sum_{i=1}^\infty {a_i \over i!} x^i \right)
= \sum_{n=0}^\infty {B_n(a_1,\dots,a_n) \over n!} x^n,&lt;/math&gt;
which also represents the [[exponential generating function]] of the complete Bell polynomials on a fixed sequence of arguments &lt;math&gt;a_1, a_2, \dots&lt;/math&gt;.

===Reversion of series===
{{main|Lagrange inversion theorem}}

Let two functions ''f'' and ''g'' be expressed in formal power series as

:&lt;math&gt;f(w) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty f_k \frac{w^k}{k!}, \qquad \text{and}  \qquad  g(z) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty g_k \frac{z^k}{k!},&lt;/math&gt;

such that ''g'' is the compositional inverse of ''f'' defined by ''g''(''f''(''w'')) = ''w'' or ''f''(''g''(''z'')) = ''z''. If ''f''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ‚â† 0, then an explicit form of the coefficients of the inverse can be given in term of Bell polynomials as{{sfn|Charalambides|2002|p=437|loc=Eqn (11.43)}}

:&lt;math&gt; g_n = \frac{1}{f_1^n} \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k n^{\bar{k}} B_{n-1,k}(\hat{f}_1,\hat{f}_2,\ldots,\hat{f}_{n-k}), \qquad n \geq 2, &lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt; \hat{f}_k = \frac{f_{k+1}}{(k+1)f_{1}},&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n^{\bar{k}} = n(n+1)\cdots (n+k-1) &lt;/math&gt; is the rising factorial, and &lt;math&gt;g_1 = \frac{1}{f_{1}}. &lt;/math&gt;

===Asymptotic expansion of Laplace-type integrals===
Consider the integral of the form

:&lt;math&gt;I(\lambda) = \int_a^b e^{-\lambda f(x)} g(x) \, \mathrm{d}x, &lt;/math&gt;

where (''a'',''b'') is a real (finite or infinite) interval, Œª is a large positive parameter and the functions ''f'' and ''g'' are continuous. Let ''f'' have a single minimum in [''a'',''b''] which occurs at ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a''. Assume that as ''x''&amp;nbsp;‚Üí&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; f(x) \sim f(a) + \sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k (x-a)^{k+\alpha}, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; g(x) \sim \sum_{k=0}^\infty b_k (x-a)^{k+\beta-1}, &lt;/math&gt;

with ''Œ±'' &gt; 0, Re(''Œ≤'') &gt; 0; and that the expansion of ''f'' can be term wise differentiated. Then, Laplace‚ÄìErdelyi theorem states that the asymptotic expansion of the integral ''I''(''Œª'') is given by

:&lt;math&gt; I(\lambda) \sim e^{-\lambda f(a)} \sum_{n=0}^\infty \Gamma \Big(\frac{n+\beta}{\alpha} \Big) \frac{c_n}{\lambda^{(n+\beta)/\alpha}} \qquad \text{as} \quad \lambda \rightarrow \infty, &lt;/math&gt;

where the coefficients ''c&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' are expressible in terms of ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''b&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' using partial ''ordinary'' Bell polynomials, as given by Campbell‚ÄìFroman‚ÄìWalles‚ÄìWojdylo formula:

:&lt;math&gt; c_n = \frac{1}{\alpha a_0^{(n+\beta)/\alpha}} \sum_{k=0}^n b_{n-k} \sum_{j=0}^k \binom{-\frac{n+\beta}{\alpha}}{j} \frac{1}{a_0^j} \hat{B}_{k,j}(a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{k-j+1}). &lt;/math&gt;

===Symmetric polynomials=== 
{{main|Newton's identities}}
The [[elementary symmetric polynomial]] &lt;math&gt;e_n&lt;/math&gt; and the [[power sum symmetric polynomial]] &lt;math&gt;p_n&lt;/math&gt; can be related to each other using Bell polynomials as:
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
e_n &amp; = \frac{(-1)^n}{n!}\; B_{n}(p_1, -1! p_2, 2! p_3, -3! p_4, \ldots, (-1)^{n-1}(n-1)! p_n ), \\[6pt]
p_n &amp; = \frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{(n-1)!} \sum_{k=1}^n (-1)^{k-1} (k-1)!\; B_{n,k}(e_1,2! e_2, 3! e_3,\ldots,(n-k+1)! e_{n-k+1}) = (-1)^n\; n\; \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k} \; \hat{B}_{n,k}(-e_1,\dots,-e_{n-k+1}).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

These formulae allow one to express the coefficients of monic polynomials in terms of the Bell polynomials of its zeroes. For instance, together with [[Cayley‚ÄìHamilton theorem]] they lead to expression of the determinant of a ''n'' √ó ''n'' square matrix ''A'' in terms of the traces of its powers: 
: &lt;math&gt; \det (A) = \frac{(-1)^{n}}{n!} B_n(s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n), ~\qquad \text{where }  s_k = (-1)^{k-1} (k - 1)! \operatorname{tr}(A^k).&lt;/math&gt;

===Cycle index of symmetric groups===
{{main|Cycle index}}

The [[cycle index]] of the [[symmetric group]] &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in terms of complete Bell polynomials as follows:
:&lt;math&gt; Z(S_n) = \frac{B_n(0!\,a_1, 1!\,a_2, \dots, (n-1)!\,a_n)}{n!}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Moments and cumulants===

The sum

:&lt;math&gt;\mu_n' = B_n(\kappa_1,\dots,\kappa_n)=\sum_{k=1}^n B_{n,k}(\kappa_1,\dots,\kappa_{n-k+1})&lt;/math&gt;

is the ''n''th raw [[moment (mathematics)|moment]] of a [[probability distribution]] whose first ''n'' [[cumulant]]s are ''Œ∫''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''Œ∫''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.  In other words, the ''n''th moment is the ''n''th complete Bell polynomial evaluated at the first ''n'' cumulants. Likewise, the ''n''th cumulant can be given in terms of the moments as

:&lt;math&gt;\kappa_n = \sum_{k=1}^n (-1)^{k-1} (k-1)! B_{n,k}(\mu'_1,\ldots,\mu'_{n-k+1}).&lt;/math&gt;

===Hermite polynomials===
The probabilists' [[Hermite polynomials]] can be expressed in terms of Bell polynomials as

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{He}_n(x) = B_n(x,-1,0,\ldots,0),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 for all ''i'' &gt; 2; thus allowing for a combinatorial interpretation of the coefficients of the Hermite polynomials. This can be seen by comparing the generating function of the Hermite polynomials

:&lt;math&gt;\exp \left(xt-\frac{t^2}{2} \right) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \operatorname{He}_n(x) \frac {t^n}{n!}&lt;/math&gt;

with that of Bell polynomials.

===Representation of polynomial sequences of binomial type===

For any sequence ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ‚Ä¶, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of scalars, let

:&lt;math&gt;p_n(x)=\sum_{k=1}^n B_{n,k}(a_1,\dots,a_{n-k+1}) x^k.&lt;/math&gt;

Then this polynomial sequence is of [[binomial type]], i.e. it satisfies the binomial identity

:&lt;math&gt;p_n(x+y)=\sum_{k=0}^n {n \choose k} p_k(x) p_{n-k}(y).&lt;/math&gt;

:'''Example:''' For ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ‚Ä¶ = ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1, the polynomials &lt;math&gt;p_n(x)&lt;/math&gt; represent [[Touchard polynomials]].

More generally, we have this result:

:'''Theorem:''' All polynomial sequences of binomial type are of this form.

If we define a formal power series

:&lt;math&gt;h(x)=\sum_{k=1}^\infty {a_k \over k!} x^k,&lt;/math&gt;

then for all ''n'',

:&lt;math&gt;h^{-1}\left( {d \over dx}\right) p_n(x) = n p_{n-1}(x).&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5566">In [[mathematics]], the '''Bombieri norm''', named after [[Enrico Bombieri]], is a [[Norm (mathematics)|norm]] on [[homogeneous polynomial]]s with coefficient in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb C&lt;/math&gt; (there is also a version for non homogeneous univariate polynomials). This norm has many remarkable properties, the most important being listed in this article.

==Bombieri scalar product for homogeneous polynomials==

To start with the geometry, the ''Bombieri scalar product'' for [[homogeneous polynomial]]s with ''N'' variables can be defined as follows using [[multi-index notation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\forall \alpha,\beta \in \mathbb{N}^N&lt;/math&gt;

by definition different monomials are orthogonal, so that

:&lt;math&gt;\langle X^\alpha | X^\beta \rangle = 0&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\alpha \neq \beta,&lt;/math&gt;

while

:&lt;math&gt;\forall \alpha \in \mathbb{N}^N&lt;/math&gt;

by definition

:&lt;math&gt;\|X^\alpha\|^2 = \frac{\alpha!}{|\alpha|!}.&lt;/math&gt;

In the above definition and in the rest of this article the following notation applies:

if

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = (\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_N) \in \mathbb{N}^N,&lt;/math&gt;

write

:&lt;math&gt;|\alpha| = \Sigma_{i=1}^N \alpha_i&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha! = \Pi_{i=1}^N (\alpha_i!)&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;X^\alpha = \Pi_{i=1}^N X_i^{\alpha_i}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Bombieri inequality==
The fundamental property of this norm is the Bombieri inequality:

let &lt;math&gt;P,Q&lt;/math&gt; be two homogeneous polynomials respectively of degree &lt;math&gt;d^\circ(P)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d^\circ(Q)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; variables, then, the following inequality holds:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^\circ(P)!d^\circ(Q)!}{(d^\circ(P)+d^\circ(Q))!}\|P\|^2 \, \|Q\|^2 \leq 
 \|P\cdot Q\|^2 \leq \|P\|^2 \, \|Q\|^2.&lt;/math&gt;

Here the Bombieri inequality is the left hand side of the above statement, while the right side means that the Bombieri norm is an [[algebra norm]]. Giving the left hand side is meaningless without that constraint, because in this case, we can achieve the same result with any norm by multiplying the norm by a well chosen factor.

This multiplicative inequality implies that the product of two polynomials is bounded from below by a quantity that depends on the multiplicand polynomials. Thus, this product can not be arbitrarily small. This multiplicative inequality is useful in metric [[algebraic geometry]] and [[number theory]].

==Invariance by isometry==
Another important property is that the Bombieri norm is invariant by composition with an 
[[isometry]]:

let &lt;math&gt;P,Q&lt;/math&gt; be two homogeneous polynomials of degree &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; variables and let &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; be an isometry
of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^N&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb C^N&lt;/math&gt;). Then, the we have &lt;math&gt;\langle P\circ h|Q\circ h\rangle = \langle P|Q\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. When &lt;math&gt;P=Q&lt;/math&gt; this implies &lt;math&gt;\|P\circ h\|=\|P\|&lt;/math&gt;.

This result follows from a nice integral formulation of the scalar product:

: &lt;math&gt;\langle P|Q\rangle = {d+N-1 \choose N-1} \int_{S^N} P(Z)\overline{Q(Z)}\,d\sigma(Z)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;S^N&lt;/math&gt; is the unit sphere of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb C^N&lt;/math&gt; with its canonical measure &lt;math&gt;d\sigma(Z)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Other inequalities==
Let &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; be a homogeneous polynomial of degree &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; variables and let &lt;math&gt;Z \in \mathbb C^N&lt;/math&gt;. We have:

* &lt;math&gt;|P(Z)| \leq \|P\| \, \|Z\|_E^d&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\|\nabla P(Z)\|_E \leq d \|P\| \, \|Z\|_E^d&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|_E&lt;/math&gt; denotes the Euclidean norm.

The Bombieri norm is useful in polynomial factorization, where it has some advantages over the [[Mahler measure]], according to Knuth (Exercises 20-21, pages 457-458 and 682-684).

The [[algebraic structure]] that naturally builds on a Boolean domain is the [[two-element Boolean algebra|Boolean algebra with two elements]]. The [[initial object]] in the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of [[bounded lattice]]s is a Boolean domain.

In [[computer science]], a Boolean variable is a [[Variable (programming)|variable]] that takes values in some Boolean domain. Some [[programming language]]s feature [[reserved word]]s or symbols for the elements of the Boolean domain, for example &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;. However, many programming languages do not have a [[Boolean datatype]] in the strict sense. In [[C (programming language)|C]] or [[BASIC]], for example, falsity is represented by the number 0 and truth is represented by the number 1 or ‚àí1, and all variables that can take these values can also take any other numerical values.

== Generalizations ==
The Boolean domain {0,‚Äâ1} can be replaced by the [[unit interval]] {{closed-closed|0,1}}, in which case rather than only taking values 0 or 1, any value between and including 0 and 1 can be assumed. Algebraically, negation (NOT) is replaced with &lt;math&gt;1-x,&lt;/math&gt; conjunction (AND) is replaced with multiplication (&lt;math&gt;xy&lt;/math&gt;), and disjunction (OR) is defined via [[De Morgan's law]] to be &lt;math&gt;1-(1-x)(1-y)&lt;/math&gt;.

Interpreting these values as logical [[truth value]]s yields a [[multi-valued logic]], which forms the basis for [[fuzzy logic]] and [[probabilistic logic]]. In these interpretations, a value is interpreted as the "degree" of truth ‚Äì to what extent a proposition is true, or the probability that the proposition is true.

A '''boolean flag''', '''truth bit''' or '''truth flag''' in [[computer science]] is a [[Boolean value]] represented as one bit

==Memory usage==
A single [[byte]] can contain up to 8 separate Boolean flags, making it a very economical method of storage.
==Efficiency==
Most [[computer language]]s support the setting and testing of single or multiple bits in combination for use as truth indicators and usually up to 256 different combinations of conditions can be tested for with just a single instruction on one byte.
==Usage==
Sometimes, programs are written to simply set flags when certain conditions are detected, rather than have multiple nested [[Conditional (programming)|conditional statement]]s (e.g. IF's) that can get quite complex. When all the conditions are tested for and all flags set on or off appropriately, testing can commence on various combinations of conditions - by reference to the flags instead of the variables themselves. This can simplify processing considerably and allows [[decision table]]s to be implemented by mapping to their binary representations in memory.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3363">In [[algebraic geometry]], the '''Castelnuovo‚ÄìMumford regularity''' of a [[coherent sheaf]] ''F'' over [[projective space]] '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;  is the smallest integer ''r'' such that it is '''r-regular''', meaning that

:&lt;math&gt;H^i(\mathbf{P}^n, F(r-i))=0 \, &lt;/math&gt;

whenever ''i''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0.  The regularity of a [[subscheme]] is defined to be the regularity of its sheaf of ideals. The regularity controls when the [[Hilbert function]] of the sheaf becomes a polynomial; more precisely dim ''H''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(''P''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, ''F''(''m'')) is a polynomial in ''m'' when ''m'' is at least the regularity. The concept of ''r''-regularity  was introduced by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=David Mumford|last=Mumford|year=1966|loc=lecture 14}}, who attributed the following results to  {{harvs|txt|first=Guido| last=Castelnuovo|authorlink=Guido Castelnuovo|year=1893}}:
*An ''r''-regular sheaf is ''s''-regular for any ''s'' ‚â• ''r''.
*If a coherent sheaf is ''r''-regular then   ''F''(''r'') is [[generated by its global sections]].

==Graded modules==
A related idea exists in [[commutative algebra]].  Suppose ''R'' = ''k''[''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;] is a [[polynomial ring]] over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''k'' and ''M'' is a [[Finitely-generated module|finitely generated]] [[Graded algebra#Graded module|graded ''R''-module]].  Suppose ''M'' has a [[Resolution (algebra)#Graded modules and algebras|minimal graded free resolution]]
:&lt;math&gt;\cdots\rightarrow F_j \rightarrow\cdots\rightarrow F_0\rightarrow M\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;
and let ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; be the maximum of the degrees of the generators of ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;.  If ''r'' is an integer such that ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; - ''j'' ‚â§ ''r'' for all ''j'', then ''M'' is said to be ''r''-regular.  The regularity of ''M'' is the smallest such ''r''.

These two notions of regularity coincide when ''F'' is a coherent sheaf such that Ass(''F'') contains no closed points.  Then the graded module {{nowrap|''M''{{=}} &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;d‚àà'''Z'''&lt;/sub&gt; ''H''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;('''P'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;,''F''(''d''))}} is finitely generated and has the same regularity as ''F''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2696">A '''Cauchy problem''' in mathematics asks for the solution of a [[partial differential equation]] that satisfies certain conditions that are given on a [[hypersurface]] in the domain.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques  Hadamard (1923), Lectures on Cauchy's Problem in Linear Partial Differential Equations, Dover Phoenix editions&lt;/ref&gt; A Cauchy problem can be an [[initial value problem]] or a [[boundary value problem]] (for this case see also [[Cauchy boundary condition]]) or it can be neither of them. It is named after [[Augustin Louis Cauchy]].

==Formal statement==

For a partial differential equation defined on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n+1''&lt;/sup&gt; and a [[smooth manifold]] ''S'' ‚äÇ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n+1''&lt;/sup&gt; of dimension ''n'' (''S'' is called the [[Cauchy surface]]), the Cauchy problem consists of finding the unknown functions &lt;math&gt;u_1,\dots,u_N&lt;/math&gt; of the differential equation with respect to the independent variables &lt;math&gt;t,x_1,\dots,x_n&lt;/math&gt; that satisfies&lt;ref&gt;Petrovskii, I. G. (1954). Lectures on partial differential equations. Interscience Publishers, Inc, Translated by A. Shenitzer, (Dover publications, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}&amp;\frac{\partial^{n_i}u_i}{\partial t^{n_i}} = F_i\left(t,x_1,\dots,x_n,u_1,\dots,u_N,\dots,\frac{\partial^k u_j}{\partial t^{k_0}\partial x_i^{k_1}\dots\partial x_n^{k_n}},\dots\right) \\
&amp;\text{for } i,j = 1,2,\dots,N;\, k_0+k_1+\dots+k_n=k\leq n_j;\, k_0&lt;n_j
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
subject to the condition, for some value &lt;math&gt;t=t_0&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^k u_i}{\partial t^k}=\phi_i^{(k)}(x_1,\dots,x_n)
\quad \text{for } k=0,1,2,\dots,n_i-1&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\phi_i^{(k)}(x_1,\dots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt; are given functions defined on the surface &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; (collectively known as the '''Cauchy data''' of the problem). The derivative of order zero means that the function itself is specified.

The [[Cauchy‚ÄìKowalevski theorem]] states that ''If all the functions &lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt; are [[analytic function|analytic]] in some neighborhood of the point &lt;math&gt;(t^0,x_1^0,x_2^0,\dots,\phi_{j,k_0,k_1,\dots,k_n}^0,\dots)&lt;/math&gt;, and if all the functions &lt;math&gt;\phi_j^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; are analytic in some neighborhood of the point &lt;math&gt;(x_1^0,x_2^0,\dots,x_n^0)&lt;/math&gt;, then the Cauchy problem has a unique analytic solution in some neighborhood of the point &lt;math&gt;(t^0,x_1^0,x_2^0,\dots,x_n^0)&lt;/math&gt;''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44890">'''Chen‚ÄìHo encoding''' is a memory-efficient alternate system of [[Binary numeral system|binary]] encoding for [[decimal]] digits.

The traditional system of binary encoding for decimal digits, known as [[binary-coded decimal]] (BCD), uses four bits to encode each digit, resulting in significant wastage of binary data bandwidth (since four bits can store 16 states and are being used to store only 10).&lt;ref name="Muller_2010"/&gt;

The encoding reduces the storage requirements of two decimal digits (100 states) from 8 to 7 bits, and those of three decimal digits (1000 states) from 12 to 10 bits using only simple [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean]] transformations avoiding any complex arithmetic operations like a [[base conversion]].

==History==
In what appears to have been a [[multiple discovery]], some of the concepts behind what later became known as Chen‚ÄìHo encoding were independently developed by [[Theodore M. Hertz]] in 1969&lt;ref name="Hertz_1969"/&gt; and by [[Tien Chi Chen]] in 1971.&lt;ref name="Chen_2015"/&gt;

Hertz of [[North American Rockwell Corporation|Rockwell]] filed a patent for his encoding in 1969, which was granted in 1971.&lt;ref name="Hertz_1969"/&gt;

Chen first discussed his ideas with [[Irving Tze Ho]]&lt;ref name="Tseng_1988"/&gt; in 1971. Chen and Ho were both working for [[IBM]] at the time, although in different locations.&lt;ref name="Chen_1971_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chen_1971_2"/&gt; Chen also consulted with [[Frank C. Tung]]&lt;ref name="Tung_2016"/&gt; to verify the results of his theories independently.&lt;ref name="Chen_1971_2"/&gt; IBM filed a patent in their name in 1973, which was granted in 1974.&lt;ref name="Chen_1973_US3842414A"/&gt; At least by 1973 Hertz's earlier work must have been known to them, as the patent cites his patent as [[prior art]].&lt;ref name="Chen_1973_US3842414A"/&gt;

The final version of the Chen‚ÄìHo encoding was circulated inside IBM in 1974&lt;ref name="Chen_Ho_1974"/&gt; and published in 1975 in the journal ''[[Communications of the Association for Computing Machinery]] (CACM)''.&lt;ref name="Chen_Ho_1975"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cowlishaw_2000_CH"/&gt; This version included several refinements, primarily related to the application of the encoding system. It constitutes a [[Huffmann code|Huffman]]-like [[prefix code]].

The encoding became known as ''Chen‚ÄìHo encoding'' or ''Chen‚ÄìHo algorithm'' only since 2000.&lt;ref name="Cowlishaw_2000_CH"/&gt; After having filed a patent in 2001,&lt;ref name="Cowlishaw_2001_US6525679B1"/&gt; [[Michael F. Cowlishaw]] published a further refinement of Chen‚ÄìHo encoding known as [[Densely Packed Decimal]] (DPD) encoding in ''IEE Proceedings ‚Äì Computers and Digital Techniques'' in 2002.&lt;ref name="Cowlishaw_2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cowlishaw_2007"/&gt; Densely Packed Decimal has subsequently been adopted as the ''decimal encoding'' used in the [[IEEE 754-2008]] and [[ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011]] [[floating-point]] standards.

==Application==
Chen noted that the digits zero through seven were simply encoded using three binary digits of the corresponding [[octal]] group. He also postulated that one could use a [[flag (computing)|flag]] to identify a different encoding for the digits eight and nine, which would be encoded using a single bit.

In practice, a series of [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean]] transformations are applied to the stream of input bits, compressing BCD encoded digits from 12 bits per three digits to 10 bits per three digits. Reversed transformations are used to decode the resulting coded stream to BCD. Equivalent results can also be achieved by the use of a [[look-up table]].

Chen‚ÄìHo encoding is limited to encoding sets of three decimal digits into groups of 10 bits (so called ''[[declet (computing)|declet]]s'').&lt;ref name="Muller_2010"/&gt; Of the 1024 states possible by using 10 bits, it leaves only 24&lt;!-- 3 states (from 2 don't-care bits minus one implicitly used state) for 3 higher value digits each = 3*8 states = 24 --&gt; states unused&lt;ref name="Muller_2010"/&gt; (with [[don't care]] bits typically set to 0 on write and ignored on read). With only 0.34% wastage it gives a 20% more efficient encoding than BCD with one digit in 4 bits.&lt;ref name="Chen_1971_2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cowlishaw_2000_CH"/&gt;

Both Hertz and Chen also proposed similar, but less efficient, encoding schemes to compress sets of two decimal digits (requiring 8 bits in BCD) into groups of 7 bits.&lt;ref name="Hertz_1969"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chen_1971_2"/&gt;

Larger sets of decimal digits could by divided into three- and two-digit groups.&lt;ref name="Hertz_1969"/&gt;

The patents also discuss the possibility to adapt the scheme to digits encoded in any other decimal codes than BCD, like f.e. [[Excess-3]].&lt;ref name="Hertz_1969"/&gt; The same principles could also be applied to other bases.

In 1973, some form of Chen‚ÄìHo encoding appears to have been utilized in the address conversion hardware of the optional [[IBM 7070]]/[[IBM 7074|7074]] emulation feature for the [[IBM System/370 Model 165]] and [[IBM System/370 Model 168|370 Model 168]] computers.&lt;ref name="Savard_2007_CH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IBM_1973_CF"/&gt;

One prominent application uses a 128-bit register to store 33 decimal digits with a three digit exponent, effectively not less than what could be achieved using binary encoding (whereas BCD encoding would need 144 bits to store the same number of digits).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7105">A '''computer experiment''' or '''simulation experiment''' is an experiment used to study a computer simulation, also referred to as an [[in silico]] system. This area includes [[computational physics]],  [[computational chemistry]], [[computational biology]] and other similar disciplines.

==Background==
[[Computer simulation]]s are constructed to emulate a physical system. Because these are meant to replicate some aspect of a system in detail, they often do not yield an analytic solution.  Therefore, methods such as [[discrete event simulation]]  or [[finite element]] solvers are used.   A [[computer model]] is used to make inferences about the system it replicates.   For example, [[climate models]] are often used because experimentation on an earth sized object is impossible.

==Objectives==
Computer experiments have been employed with many purposes in mind.  Some of those include:  
* [[Uncertainty quantification]]: Characterize the uncertainty present in a computer simulation arising from unknowns during the computer simulation's construction.
* [[Inverse problem]]s:  Discover the underlying properties of the system from the physical data.
* '''Bias correction''':  Use physical data to correct for bias in the simulation.
* [[Data assimilation]]: Combine multiple simulations and physical data sources into a complete predictive model.
* [[Systems design]]:  Find inputs that result in optimal system performance measures.

==Computer simulation modeling==
Modeling of computer experiments typically uses a Bayesian framework. [[Bayesian statistics]] is an interpretation of the field of [[statistics]] where all evidence about the true state of the world is explicitly expressed in the form of [[probabilities]].  In the realm of computer experiments, the Bayesian interpretation would imply we must form a [[prior distribution]] that represents our prior belief on the structure of the computer model.  The use of this philosophy for computer experiments started in the 1980s and is nicely summarized by Sacks et al. (1989) [https://web.archive.org/web/20170918022130/https://projecteuclid.org/DPubS?service=UI&amp;version=1.0&amp;verb=Display&amp;handle=euclid.ss%2F1177012413].  While the Bayesian approach is widely used, [[frequentist]] approaches have been recently discussed [http://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~jeffwu/publications/calibration-may1.pdf].

The basic idea of this framework is to model the computer simulation as an unknown function of a set of inputs.  The computer simulation is implemented as a piece of computer code that can be evaluated to produce a collection of outputs.  Examples of inputs to these simulations are coefficients in the underlying model, [[initial conditions]] and [[Forcing function (differential equations)|forcing functions]].  It is natural to see the simulation as a deterministic function that maps these ''inputs'' into a collection of ''outputs''.  On the basis of seeing our simulator this way, it is common to refer to the collection of inputs as  &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, the computer simulation itself as &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, and the resulting output as &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;.  Both &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; are vector quantities, and they can be very large collections of values, often indexed by space, or by time, or by both space and time.

Although &lt;math&gt;f(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is known in principle, in practice this is not the case.  Many simulators comprise tens of thousands of lines of high-level computer code, which is not accessible to intuition.  For some simulations, such as climate models, evaluation of the output for a single set of inputs can require millions of computer hours [http://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1198/TECH.2009.0015#.UbixC_nFWHQ].

===Gaussian process prior===
The typical model for a computer code output is a Gaussian process.  For notational simplicity, assume &lt;math&gt; f(x) &lt;/math&gt; is a scalar.  Owing to the Bayesian framework, we fix our belief that the function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; follows a [[Gaussian process]],
&lt;math&gt;f \sim \operatorname{GP}(m(\cdot),C(\cdot,\cdot)),&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; m&lt;/math&gt; is the mean function and &lt;math&gt; C &lt;/math&gt; is the covariance function.  Popular mean functions are low order polynomials and a popular [[covariance function]] is [[Matern covariance]], which includes both the exponential (&lt;math&gt; \nu = 1/2 &lt;/math&gt;) and Gaussian covariances (as &lt;math&gt; \nu \rightarrow \infty &lt;/math&gt;).

==Design of computer experiments==
The design of computer experiments has considerable differences from [[design of experiments]] for parametric models.   Since a Gaussian process prior has an infinite dimensional representation, the concepts of A and D criteria (see [[Optimal design]]), which focus on reducing the error in the parameters, cannot be used. Replications would also be wasteful in cases when the computer simulation has no error.   Criteria that are used to determine a good experimental design include integrated mean squared prediction error [https://web.archive.org/web/20170918022130/https://projecteuclid.org/DPubS?service=UI&amp;version=1.0&amp;verb=Display&amp;handle=euclid.ss%2F1177012413] and distance based criteria [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037837589090122B].

Popular strategies for design include [[latin hypercube sampling]] and [[low discrepancy sequences]].

===Problems with massive sample sizes===
Unlike physical experiments, it is common for computer experiments to have thousands of different input combinations.  Because the standard inference requires [[Invertible matrix|matrix inversion]] of a square matrix of the size of the number of samples (&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;), the cost grows on the &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{O} (n^3) &lt;/math&gt;.  Matrix inversion of large, dense matrices can also cause numerical inaccuracies.  Currently, this problem is solved by greedy decision tree techniques, allowing effective computations for unlimited dimensionality and sample size [http://www.google.com/patents/WO2013055257A1?cl=en&amp;hl=ru patent WO2013055257A1], or avoided by using approximation methods, e.g. [https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120130182750/http://www.stat.wisc.edu/~zhiguang/Multistep_AOS.pdf].

In the mathematical field of [[complex analysis]], '''contour integration''' is a method of evaluating certain [[integral]]s along paths in the complex plane.&lt;ref name=Stalker&gt;{{Cite book|title=Complex Analysis: Fundamentals of the Classical Theory of Functions |first=John |last=Stalker |page=77 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yl3GIXd3dFIC&amp;pg=PP12&amp;dq=%22calculus+of+residues%22#PPA77,M1|isbn=0-8176-4038-X |publisher=Springer |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bak&gt;{{Cite book|title=Complex Analysis |first1=Joseph |last1=Bak |first2=Donald J. |last2=Newman |chapter=Chapters 11 &amp; 12 |pages=130‚Äì156 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JX2YSgfZwbYC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;dq=%22contour+integral%22#PPA130,M1 |isbn=0-387-94756-6 |year=1997 |publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Krantz&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Complex Variables |first=Steven George |last=Krantz |chapter= Chapter 2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aYU2AdF_0dIC&amp;pg=PT13&amp;dq=Calculus++Residues+inauthor:krantz#PPT47,M1 |isbn=0-8176-4011-8 |year=1999 |publisher=Springer }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One use for contour integrals is the evaluation of integrals along the real line that are not readily found by using only real variable methods.&lt;ref name=Mitrinovic2&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=Chapter 5 |title=The Cauchy Method of Residues: Theory and Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-suKhxfPH5AC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22calculus+of+residues%22#PPA108,M1 |first1=Dragoslav S. |last1=Mitrinoviƒá |first2=Jovan D. |last2=Keƒçkiƒá |year=1984 |isbn=90-277-1623-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contour integration methods include
* direct integration of a [[complex number|complex]]-valued function along a curve in the complex plane (a ''contour'')
* application of the [[Cauchy integral formula]]
* application of the [[residue theorem]]
One method can be used, or a combination of these methods, or various limiting processes, for the purpose of finding these integrals or sums.

==Curves in the complex plane==
In [[complex analysis]] a '''contour''' is a type of curve in the [[complex plane]]. In contour integration, contours provide a precise definition of the [[curve]]s on which an integral may be suitably defined. A '''curve''' in the complex plane is defined as a [[continuous function]] from a [[closed interval]] of the [[real line]] to the complex plane: {{math|''z'' : [''a'', ''b''] ‚Üí '''C'''}}.

This definition of a curve coincides with the intuitive notion of a curve, but includes a parametrization by a continuous function from a closed interval. This more precise definition allows us to consider what properties a curve must have for it to be useful for integration. In the following subsections we narrow down the set of curves that we can integrate to only include ones that can be built up out of a finite number of continuous curves that can be given a direction. Moreover, we will restrict the "pieces" from crossing over themselves, and we require that each piece have a finite (non-vanishing) continuous derivative. These requirements correspond to requiring that we consider only curves that can be traced, such as by a pen, in a sequence of even, steady strokes, which only stop to start a new piece of the curve, all without picking up the pen.&lt;ref name=Saff&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of Complex Analysis with Applications to Engineering, Science, and Mathematics |edition=3rd |chapter=Chapter 4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fVsZAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=saff+%26+Snider&amp;dq=saff+%26+Snider&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rT7PUPaiL4OE2gXvg4GoBQ&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwAw
|first1=Edward B. |last1=Saff |first2=Arthur David |last2=Snider |year=2003 |isbn=0-1390-7874-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Directed smooth curves===
Contours are often defined in terms of directed smooth curves.&lt;ref name=Saff/&gt; These provide a precise definition of a "piece" of a smooth curve, of which a contour is made.

A '''smooth curve''' is a curve {{math|''z'' : [''a'', ''b''] ‚Üí '''C'''}} with a non-vanishing, continuous derivative such that each point is traversed only once ({{mvar|z}} is one-to-one), with the possible exception of a curve such that the endpoints match ({{math|''z''(''a'') {{=}} ''z''(''b'')}}). In the case where the endpoints match the curve is called closed, and the function is required to be one-to-one everywhere else and the derivative must be continuous at the identified point ({{math|''z''‚Ä≤(''a'') {{=}} ''z''‚Ä≤(''b'')}}). A smooth curve that is not closed is often referred to as a smooth arc.&lt;ref name=Saff/&gt;

The [[parametrization]] of a curve provides a natural ordering of points on the curve: {{math|''z''(''x'')}} comes before {{math|''z''(''y'')}} if {{math|''x'' &lt; ''y''}}. This leads to the notion of a '''directed smooth curve'''. It is most useful to consider curves independent of the specific parametrization. This can be done by considering [[equivalence classes]] of smooth curves with the same direction. A '''directed smooth curve''' can then be defined as an ordered set of points in the complex plane that is the image of some smooth curve in their natural order (according to the parametrization). Note that not all orderings of the points are the natural ordering of a smooth curve. In fact, a given smooth curve has only two such orderings. Also, a single closed curve can have any point as its endpoint, while a smooth arc has only two choices for its endpoints.

===Contours===
Contours are the class of curves on which we define contour integration. A '''contour''' is a directed curve which is made up of a finite sequence of directed smooth curves whose endpoints are matched to give a single direction. This requires that the sequence of curves {{math|''Œ≥''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,‚Ä¶,''Œ≥&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} be such that the terminal point of {{math|''Œ≥&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} coincides with the initial point of {{math|''Œ≥''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|‚àÄ ''i'', 1 ‚â§ ''i'' &lt; ''n''}}. This includes all directed smooth curves. Also, a single point in the complex plane is considered a contour. The symbol + is often used to denote the piecing of curves together to form a new curve. Thus we could write a contour {{mvar|Œì}} that is made up of {{mvar|n}} curves as

:&lt;math&gt; \Gamma = \gamma_1 + \gamma_2 + \cdots + \gamma_n.&lt;/math&gt;

==Contour integrals==
The '''contour integral''' of a [[complex function]] {{math|''f'' : '''C''' ‚Üí '''C'''}} is a generalization of the integral for real-valued functions. For [[continuous function]]s in the [[complex plane]], the contour integral can be defined in analogy to the [[line integral]] by first defining the integral along a directed smooth curve in terms of an integral over a real valued parameter. A more general definition can be given in terms of partitions of the contour in analogy with the [[partition of an interval]] and the [[Riemann integral]]. In both cases the integral over a contour is defined as the sum of the integrals over the directed smooth curves that make up the contour.

===For continuous functions===
To define the contour integral in this way one must first consider the integral, over a real variable, of a complex-valued function. Let {{math|''f'' : '''R''' ‚Üí '''C'''}} be a complex-valued function of a real variable, {{mvar|t}}. The real and imaginary parts of {{mvar|f}} are often denoted as {{math|''u''(''t'')}} and {{math|''v''(''t'')}}, respectively, so that
:&lt;math&gt;f(t) = u(t) + iv(t).&lt;/math&gt;
Then the integral of the complex-valued function {{mvar|f}} over the interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} is given by 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\int_a^b f(t) \, dt &amp;= \int_a^b \big( u(t) + i v(t) \big) \, dt \\
&amp;= \int_a^b u(t) \, dt + i \int_a^b v(t) \, dt. 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Let {{math|''f'' : '''C''' ‚Üí '''C'''}} be a [[continuous function]] on the [[Methods of contour integration#Directed smooth curves|directed smooth curve]] {{mvar|Œ≥}}. Let {{math|''z'' : '''R''' ‚Üí '''C'''}} be any parametrization of {{mvar|Œ≥}} that is consistent with its order (direction). Then the integral along {{mvar|Œ≥}} is denoted

:&lt;math&gt;\int_\gamma f(z)\, dz\, &lt;/math&gt;

and is given by&lt;ref name=Saff/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\int_\gamma f(z) \, dz = \int_a^b f\big(\gamma(t)\big) \gamma'(t) \, dt.&lt;/math&gt;

This definition is well defined. That is, the result is independent of the parametrization chosen.&lt;ref name="Saff" /&gt; In the case where the real integral on the right side does not exist the integral along {{mvar|Œ≥}} is said not to exist.

===As a generalization of the Riemann integral===
The generalization of the [[Riemann integral]] to functions of a complex variable is done in complete analogy to its definition for functions from the real numbers. The partition of a directed smooth curve {{mvar|Œ≥}} is defined as a finite, ordered set of points on {{mvar|Œ≥}}. The integral over the curve is the limit of finite sums of function values, taken at the points on the partition, in the limit that the maximum distance between any two successive points on the partition (in the two-dimensional complex plane), also known as the mesh, goes to zero.

==Direct methods==
Direct methods involve the calculation of the integral by means of methods similar to those in calculating line integrals in several-variable calculus. This means that we use the following method:
*parametrizing the contour
*: The contour is parametrized by a differentiable complex-valued function of real variables, or the contour is broken up into pieces and parametrized separately.
* substitution of the parametrization into the integrand
*: Substituting the parametrization into the integrand transforms the integral into an integral of one real variable.
* direct evaluation
*: The integral is evaluated in a method akin to a real-variable integral.

===Example===
A fundamental result in complex analysis is that the contour integral of {{math|{{sfrac|1|''z''}}}} is {{math|2œÄ''i''}}, where the path of the contour is taken to be the unit circle traversed counterclockwise (or any positively oriented [[Jordan curve]] about 0). In the case of the unit circle there is a direct method to evaluate the integral

:&lt;math&gt;\oint_C \frac{1}{z}\,dz.&lt;/math&gt;

In evaluating this integral, use the unit circle {{math|{{abs|''z''}} {{=}} 1}} as contour, parametrized by {{math|''z''(''t'') {{=}} ''e&lt;sup&gt;it&lt;/sup&gt;''}}, with {{math|''t'' ‚àà [0, 2œÄ]}}, then {{math|''{{sfrac|dz|dt}}'' {{=}} ''ie&lt;sup&gt;it&lt;/sup&gt;''}} and

:&lt;math&gt;\oint_C \frac{1}{z}\,dz = \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{1}{e^{it}} ie^{it}\,dt = i\int_0^{2\pi} 1 \,dt = \Big[\;t\;\Big]_0^{2\pi} i=(2\pi-0)i = 2\pi i.&lt;/math&gt;

which is the value of the integral.

==Applications of integral theorems==
Applications of integral theorems are also often used to evaluate the contour integral along a contour, which means that the real-valued integral is calculated simultaneously along with calculating the contour integral.

Integral theorems such as the [[Cauchy integral formula]] or [[residue theorem]] are generally used in the following method:
* a specific contour is chosen:
*: The contour is chosen so that the contour follows the part of the complex plane that describes the real-valued integral, and also encloses singularities of the integrand so application of the [[Cauchy integral formula]] or [[residue theorem]] is possible
* application of [[Cauchy's integral theorem]]
*: The integral is reduced to only an integration around a small circle about each pole.
* application of the [[Cauchy integral formula]] or [[residue theorem]]
*: Application of these integral formula gives us a value for the integral around the whole of the contour.
* division of the contour into a contour along the real part and imaginary part
*: The whole of the contour can be divided into the contour that follows the part of the complex plane that describes the real-valued integral as chosen before (call it {{mvar|R}}), and the integral that crosses the complex plane (call it {{mvar|I}}). The integral over the whole of the contour is the sum of the integral over each of these contours.
* demonstration that the integral that crosses the complex plane plays no part in the sum
*: If the integral {{mvar|I}} can be shown to be zero, or if the real-valued integral that is sought is improper, then if we demonstrate that the integral {{mvar|I}} as described above tends to 0, the integral along {{mvar|R}} will tend to the integral around the contour {{math|''R'' + ''I''}}.
* conclusion
*: If we can show the above step, then we can directly calculate {{mvar|R}}, the real-valued integral.

===Example 1===
Consider the integral
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{1}{\left(x^2+1\right)^2}\,dx,&lt;/math&gt;

To evaluate this integral, we look at the complex-valued function

:&lt;math&gt;f(z)=\frac{1}{\left(z^2+1\right)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

which has [[Mathematical singularity|singularities]] at {{mvar|i}} and {{math|‚àí''i''}}. We choose a contour that will enclose the real-valued integral, here a semicircle with boundary diameter on the real line (going from, say, {{math|‚àí''a''}} to {{mvar|a}}) will be convenient. Call this contour {{mvar|C}}.

There are two ways of proceeding, using the [[Cauchy integral formula]] or by the method of residues:

====Using the Cauchy integral formula ====
Note that:

:&lt;math&gt;\oint_C f(z)\,dz = \int_{-a}^a f(z)\,dz + \int_\text{Arc} f(z)\,dz &lt;/math&gt;

thus

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-a}^a f(z)\,dz = \oint_C f(z)\,dz - \int_\text{Arc} f(z)\,dz &lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore observe that

:&lt;math&gt;f(z)=\frac{1}{\left(z^2+1\right)^2}=\frac{1}{(z+i)^2(z-i)^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since the only singularity in the contour is the one at&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|i}}, then we can write

:&lt;math&gt;f(z)=\frac{\frac{1}{(z+i)^2}}{(z-i)^2},&lt;/math&gt;

which puts the function in the form for direct application of the formula. Then, by using Cauchy's integral formula,

:&lt;math&gt;\oint_C f(z)\,dz = \oint_C \frac{\frac{1}{(z+i)^2}}{(z-i)^2}\,dz = 2\pi i \frac{d}{dz} \left(\frac{1}{(z+i)^2}\right)\Bigg|_{z=i} =2 \pi i \left(\frac{-2}{(z+i)^3}\right)\Bigg|_{z = i} =\frac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

We take the first derivative, in the above steps, because the pole is a second-order pole. That is, {{math|(''z'' ‚àí ''i'')}} is taken to the second power, so we employ the first derivative of {{math|''f''(''z'')}}. If it were {{math|(''z'' ‚àí ''i'')}} taken to the third power, we would use the second derivative and divide by 2!, etc. The case of {{math|(''z'' ‚àí ''i'')}} to the first power corresponds to a zero order derivative‚Äîjust {{math|''f''(''z'')}} itself.

We need to show that the integral over the arc of the semicircle tends to zero as {{math|''a'' ‚Üí ‚àû}}, using the [[estimation lemma]]

: &lt;math&gt;\left|\int_\text{Arc} f(z)\,dz\right| \le ML&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|M}} is an upper bound on {{math|{{abs|''f''(''z'')}}}} along the arc and {{mvar|L}} the length of the arc. Now,

: &lt;math&gt;\left|\int_\text{Arc} f(z)\,dz\right|\le \frac{a\pi}{\left(a^2-1\right)^2} \rightarrow 0 \mbox{ as } a \rightarrow \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

So

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{1}{\left(x^2+1\right)^2}\,dx = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(z)\,dz = \lim_{a \to +\infty} \int_{-a}^a f(z)\,dz = \frac{\pi}2.\quad\square&lt;/math&gt;

====Using the method of residues====
Consider the [[Laurent series]] of {{math|''f''(''z'')}} about {{mvar|i}}, the only singularity we need to consider. We then have

: &lt;math&gt;f(z) = \frac{-1}{4(z-i)^2} + \frac{-i}{4(z-i)} + \frac{3}{16} + \frac{i}{8}(z-i) + \frac{-5}{64}(z-i)^2 + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

(See the sample Laurent calculation from [[Laurent series]] for the derivation of this series.)

It is clear by inspection that the residue is {{math|‚àí{{sfrac|''i''|4}}}} (to see this, imagine that the above equation were multiplied by {{math|''z'' ‚àí ''i''}}, then both sides integrated via the Cauchy integral formula‚Äîonly the second term would integrate to a non-zero quantity), so, by the [[residue theorem]], we have

:&lt;math&gt;\oint_C f(z)\,dz = \oint_C \frac{1}{\left(z^2+1\right)^2}\,dz = 2 \pi i \,\operatorname{Res}_{z=i} f = 2 \pi i \left(-\frac{i}{4}\right)=\frac{\pi}2 \quad\square&lt;/math&gt;

Thus we get the same result as before.

====Contour note====
As an aside, a question can arise whether we do not take the semicircle to include the ''other'' singularity, enclosing {{math|‚àí''i''}}. To have the integral along the real axis moving in the correct direction, the contour must travel clockwise, i.e., in a negative direction, reversing the sign of the integral overall.

This does not affect the use of the method of residues by series.

===Example 2 ‚Äì Cauchy distribution===
The integral

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{e^{itx}}{x^2+1}\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:contourDiagram.png|right|250px|the contour]]

(which arises in [[probability theory]] as a scalar multiple of the [[characteristic function (probability theory)|characteristic function]] of the [[Cauchy distribution]]) resists the techniques of elementary [[calculus]]. We will evaluate it by expressing it as a limit of contour integrals along the contour {{mvar|C}} that goes along the [[real number|real]] line from {{math|‚àí''a''}} to {{mvar|a}} and then counterclockwise along a semicircle centered at 0 from {{mvar|a}} to {{math|‚àí''a''}}. Take {{mvar|a}} to be greater than 1, so that the [[imaginary number|imaginary]] unit {{mvar|i}} is enclosed within the curve. The contour integral is

:&lt;math&gt;\int_C \frac{e^{itz} }{ z^2+1}\,dz.&lt;/math&gt;

Since {{math|''e''&lt;sup&gt;''itz''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is an [[entire function]] (having no [[mathematical singularity|singularities]] at any point in the complex plane), this function has singularities only where the denominator {{math|''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1}} is zero. Since {{math|''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1 {{=}} (''z'' + ''i'')(''z'' ‚àí ''i'')}}, that happens only where {{math|''z'' {{=}} ''i''}} or {{math|''z'' {{=}} ‚àí''i''}}. Only one of those points is in the region bounded by this contour. The [[residue (complex analysis)|residue]] of {{math|''f''(''z'')}} at {{math|''z'' {{=}} ''i''}} is

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{z\to i}(z-i)f(z)=\lim_{z\to i}(z-i)\frac{e^{itz} }{ z^2+1}=\lim_{z\to i}(z-i)\frac{e^{itz} }{ (z-i)(z+i)}=\lim_{z\to i}\frac{e^{itz} }{ z+i}=\frac{e^{-t}}{2i}.&lt;/math&gt;

According to the [[residue theorem]], then, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\int_C f(z)\,dz=2\pi i \operatorname{Res}_{z=i}f(z)=2\pi i\frac{e^{-t} }{ 2i}=\pi e^{-t}.&lt;/math&gt;

The contour {{mvar|C}} may be split into a "straight" part and a curved arc, so that

:&lt;math&gt;\int_\text{straight}+\int_\text{arc}=\pi e^{-t},&lt;/math&gt;

and thus

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-a}^a =\pi e^{-t}-\int_\text{arc}.&lt;/math&gt;

It can be shown that '''if {{math|''t'' &gt; 0}} then'''

:&lt;math&gt;\int_\text{arc}\frac{e^{itz} }{ z^2+1}\,dz \rightarrow 0 \mbox{ as } a\rightarrow\infty.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore '''if {{math|''t'' &gt; 0}} then'''

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{e^{itx} }{ x^2+1}\,dx=\pi e^{-t}.&lt;/math&gt;

A similar argument with an arc that winds around {{math|‚àí''i''}} rather than {{mvar|i}} shows that '''if {{math|''t'' &lt; 0}} then'''

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{e^{itx} }{ x^2+1}\,dx=\pi e^t,&lt;/math&gt;

and finally we have this:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{e^{itx} }{ x^2+1} \,dx=\pi e^{-|t|}.\quad\square&lt;/math&gt;

(If {{math|''t'' {{=}} 0}} then the integral yields immediately to real-valued calculus methods and its value is {{pi}}.)

===Example 3 ‚Äì trigonometric integrals===
Certain substitutions can be made to integrals involving [[trigonometric functions]], so the integral is transformed into a rational function of a complex variable and then the above methods can be used in order to evaluate the integral.

As an example, consider

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\pi}^\pi \frac{1 }{ 1 + 3 (\cos t)^2} \,dt.&lt;/math&gt;

We seek to make a substitution of {{math|''z'' {{=}} ''e&lt;sup&gt;it&lt;/sup&gt;''}}. Now, recall

:&lt;math&gt;\cos t = \frac12 \left(e^{it}+e^{-it}\right) = \frac12 \left(z+\frac{1}{z}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dz}{dt} = iz,\ dt = \frac{dz}{iz}.&lt;/math&gt;

Taking {{mvar|C}} to be the unit circle, we substitute to get:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\oint_C \frac{1}{ 1 + 3 \left(\frac12 \left(z+\frac{1}{z}\right)\right)^2} \,\frac{dz}{iz} &amp;= \oint_C \frac{1 }{ 1 + \frac34 \left(z+\frac{1}{z}\right)^2}\frac{1}{iz} \,dz \\
&amp;= \oint_C \frac{-i}{ z+\frac34 z\left(z+\frac{1}{z}\right)^2}\,dz \\
&amp;= -i \oint_C \frac{1}{ z+\frac34 z\left(z^2+2+\frac{1}{z^2}\right)} \,dz \\
&amp;= -i \oint_C \frac{1}{ z+\frac34 \left(z^3+2z+\frac{1}{z}\right)} \,dz \\
&amp;= -i \oint_C \frac{1}{ \frac34 z^3+\frac52 z+\frac{3}{4z}} \,dz \\
&amp;= -i \oint_C \frac{4}{ 3z^3+10z+\frac{3}{z}}\,dz \\
&amp;= -4i \oint_C \frac{1}{ 3z^3+10z+\frac{3}{z}}\,dz \\
&amp;= -4i \oint_C \frac{z}{ 3z^4+10z^2+3 } \,dz \\
&amp;= -4i \oint_C \frac{z}{ 3\left(z+\sqrt{3}i\right)\left(z-\sqrt{3}i\right)\left(z+\frac{i}{\sqrt 3}\right)\left(z-\frac{i}{\sqrt 3}\right)}\,dz \\
&amp;= -\frac{4i}{3} \oint_C \frac{z}{\left(z+\sqrt{3}i\right)\left(z-\sqrt{3}i\right)\left(z+\frac{i}{\sqrt 3}\right)\left(z-\frac{i}{\sqrt 3}\right)}\,dz.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The singularities to be considered are at &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pm i}{\sqrt{3}}.&lt;/math&gt; Let {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} be a small circle about &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{i}{\sqrt{3}},&lt;/math&gt; and {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} be a small circle about &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{-i}{\sqrt{3}}.&lt;/math&gt; Then we arrive at the following:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
-\frac{4i}{3} &amp; \left [\oint_{C_1} \frac{\frac{z}{\left(z+\sqrt{3}i\right)\left(z-\sqrt{3}i\right)\left(z+\frac{i}{\sqrt 3} \right)}}{z-\frac{i}{\sqrt 3}}\,dz +\oint_{C_2} \frac{\frac{z}{\left(z+\sqrt{3}i\right)\left(z-\sqrt{3}i\right)\left(z-\frac{i}{\sqrt 3}\right)}}{z+\frac{i}{\sqrt 3}} \, dz \right ] \\
&amp;= -\frac{4i}{3} \left[ 2\pi i \left. \left(\frac{z}{\left(z+\sqrt{3}i\right)\left(z-\sqrt{3}i\right)\left(z+\frac{i}{\sqrt 3}\right)}\right)\right |_{z=\frac{i}{\sqrt 3}} + 2\pi i \left. \left(\frac{z}{\left(z+\sqrt{3}i\right)\left(z-\sqrt{3}i\right)\left(z-\frac{i}{\sqrt 3}\right)} \right)\right |_{z=-\frac{i}{\sqrt 3}}\right] \\
&amp;= \frac{8\pi}{3} \left[\frac{\frac{i}{\sqrt 3}}{\left(\frac{i}{\sqrt 3}+\sqrt{3}i\right)\left(\frac{i}{\sqrt 3}-\sqrt{3}i\right)\left(\frac{i}{\sqrt 3}+\frac{i}{\sqrt 3}\right)} + \frac{-\frac{i}{\sqrt 3}}{\left(-\frac{i}{\sqrt 3}+\sqrt{3}i\right)\left(-\frac{i}{\sqrt 3}-\sqrt{3}i\right)\left(-\frac{i}{\sqrt 3}-\frac{i}{\sqrt 3}\right)} \right] \\
&amp;= \frac{8\pi}{3} \left[\frac{\frac{i}{\sqrt 3}}{\left(\frac{4}{\sqrt 3}i\right)\left(-\frac{2}{i\sqrt{3}}\right)\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}i}\right)}+\frac{-\frac{i}{\sqrt 3}}{\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt 3}i\right)\left(-\frac{4}{\sqrt 3}i\right)\left(-\frac{2}{\sqrt 3}i\right)}\right] \\
&amp;= \frac{8\pi}{3}\left[\frac{\frac{i}{\sqrt 3}}{i\left(\frac{4}{\sqrt 3}\right)\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt 3}\right)\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt 3}\right)}+\frac{-\frac{i}{\sqrt 3}}{-i\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt 3}\right)\left(\frac{4}{\sqrt 3}\right)\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt 3}\right)}\right] \\
&amp;= \frac{8\pi}{3}\left[\frac{\frac{1}{\sqrt 3}}{\left(\frac{4}{\sqrt 3}\right)\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt 3}\right)\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt 3}\right)}+\frac{\frac{1}{\sqrt 3}}{\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt 3}\right)\left(\frac{4}{\sqrt 3}\right)\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt 3}\right)}\right] \\
&amp;= \frac{8\pi}{3}\left[\frac{\frac{1}{\sqrt 3}}{\frac{16}{3\sqrt{3}}}+\frac{\frac{1}{\sqrt 3}}{\frac{16}{3\sqrt{3}}} \right] \\
&amp;= \frac{8\pi}{3}\left[\frac{3}{16} + \frac{3}{16} \right] \\ &amp;= \pi.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===Example 3a ‚Äì trigonometric integrals, the general procedure===
The above method may be applied to all integrals of the type
:&lt;math&gt; \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{P\big(\sin(t),\sin(2t),\ldots,\cos(t),\cos(2t),\ldots\big)}{Q\big(\sin(t),\sin(2t),\ldots,\cos(t),\cos(2t),\ldots\big)}\, dt&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|P}} and {{mvar|Q}} are polynomials, i.e. a rational function in trigonometric terms is being integrated. Note that the bounds of integration may as well be {{pi}} and ‚àí{{pi}}, as in the previous example, or any other pair of endpoints 2{{pi}} apart.

The trick is to use the substitution {{math|''z'' {{=}} ''e&lt;sup&gt;it&lt;/sup&gt;''}} where {{math|''dz'' {{=}} ''ie&lt;sup&gt;it&lt;/sup&gt; dt''}} and hence

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{iz} \,dz = dt.&lt;/math&gt;

This substitution maps the interval {{math|[0, 2œÄ]}} to the unit circle. Furthermore,

:&lt;math&gt; \sin(k t) = \frac{e^{i k t} - e^{- i k t}}{2 i} = \frac{z^k - z^{-k}}{2i}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; \cos(k t) = \frac{e^{i k t} + e^{- i k t}}{2} = \frac{z^k + z^{-k}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

so that a rational function {{math|''f''(''z'')}} in {{mvar|z}} results from the substitution, and the integral becomes

:&lt;math&gt; \oint_{|z|=1} f(z) \frac{1}{iz}\, dz &lt;/math&gt;

which is in turn computed by summing the residues of {{math|''f''(''z''){{sfrac|1|''iz''}}}} inside the unit circle.

[[Image:TrigonometricToComplex.png|right]]
The image at right illustrates this for

:&lt;math&gt; I = \int_0^\frac{\pi}{2} \frac{1}{1 + (\sin t)^2}\, dt,&lt;/math&gt;

which we now compute. The first step is to recognize that

:&lt;math&gt; I = \frac14 \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{1}{1 + (\sin t)^2} \,dt.&lt;/math&gt;

The substitution yields

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{4} \oint_{|z|=1} \frac{4 i z}{z^4 - 6z^2 + 1}\, dz = \oint_{|z|=1} \frac{i z}{z^4 - 6z^2 + 1}\, dz.&lt;/math&gt;

The poles of this function are at {{math|1 ¬± {{sqrt|2}}}} and {{math|‚àí1 ¬± {{sqrt|2}}}}. Of these, {{math|1 + {{sqrt|2}}}} and {{math|‚àí1 ‚àí {{sqrt|2}}}} are outside the unit circle (shown in red, not to scale), whereas {{math|1 ‚àí {{sqrt|2}}}} and {{math|‚àí1 + {{sqrt|2}}}} are inside the unit circle (shown in blue). The corresponding residues are both equal to {{math|‚àí{{sfrac|''i''{{sqrt|2}}|16}}}}, so that the value of the integral is

:&lt;math&gt; I = 2 \pi i \; 2 \left( - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{16} i \right) = \pi \frac{\sqrt{2}}{4}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Example 4 ‚Äì branch cuts===
Consider the real integral
: &lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty \frac{\sqrt x}{x^2+6x+8}\,dx.&lt;/math&gt;

We can begin by formulating the complex integral
: &lt;math&gt;\int_C \frac{\sqrt z}{z^2+6z+8}\,dz=I.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Keyhole contour.svg|right|180px]]
We can use the Cauchy integral formula or residue theorem again to obtain the relevant residues. However, the important thing to note is that {{math|''z''&lt;sup&gt;{{1/2}}&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''e''&lt;sup&gt;{{1/2}}Log ''z''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, so {{math|''z''&lt;sup&gt;{{1/2}}&lt;/sup&gt;}} has a [[branch cut]]. This affects our choice of the contour {{mvar|C}}. Normally the logarithm branch cut is defined as the negative real axis, however, this makes the calculation of the integral slightly more complicated, so we define it to be the positive real axis.

Then, we use the so-called ''keyhole contour'', which consists of a small circle about the origin of radius {{mvar|Œµ}} say, extending to a line segment parallel and close to the positive real axis but not touching it, to an almost full circle, returning to a line segment parallel, close, and below the positive real axis in the negative sense, returning to the small circle in the middle.

Note that {{math|''z'' {{=}} ‚àí2}} and {{math|''z'' {{=}} ‚àí4}} are inside the big circle. These are the two remaining poles, derivable by factoring the denominator of the integrand. The branch point at {{math|''z'' {{=}} 0}} was avoided by detouring around the origin.
{{clear}}

Let {{mvar|Œ≥}} be the small circle of radius {{mvar|Œµ}}, {{mvar|Œì}} the larger, with radius {{mvar|R}}, then

:&lt;math&gt;\int_C = \int_\varepsilon^R + \int_\Gamma + \int_R^\varepsilon + \int_\gamma.&lt;/math&gt;

It can be shown that the integrals over {{mvar|Œì}} and {{mvar|Œ≥}} both tend to zero as {{math|''Œµ'' ‚Üí 0}} and {{math|''R'' ‚Üí ‚àû}}, by an estimation argument above, that leaves two terms. Now since {{math|''z''&lt;sup&gt;{{1/2}}&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''e''&lt;sup&gt;{{1/2}}Log ''z''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, on the contour outside the branch cut, we have gained 2{{pi}} in argument along {{mvar|Œ≥}}. (By [[Euler's identity]], {{math|''e''&lt;sup&gt;''i''œÄ&lt;/sup&gt;}} represents the unit vector, which therefore has {{pi}} as its log. This {{pi}} is what is meant by the argument of {{mvar|z}}. The coefficient of {{sfrac|1|2}} forces us to use 2{{pi}}.) So

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\int_R^\varepsilon \frac{\sqrt z}{z^2+6z+8}\,dz&amp;=\int_R^\varepsilon \frac{e^{\frac12 \operatorname{Log} z}}{z^2+6z+8}\,dz \\
&amp;=\int_R^\varepsilon \frac{e^{\frac12(\log|z|+i \arg{z})}}{z^2+6z+8}\,dz \\
&amp; = \int_R^\varepsilon \frac{ e^{\frac12\log|z|}e^{\frac12(2\pi i)}}{z^2+6z+8}\,dz\\
&amp;=\int_R^\varepsilon \frac{ e^{\frac12\log|z|}e^{\pi i}}{z^2+6z+8}\,dz \\
&amp; = \int_R^\varepsilon \frac{-\sqrt z}{z^2+6z+8}\,dz\\
&amp;=\int_\varepsilon^R \frac{\sqrt z}{z^2+6z+8}\,dz.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_C \frac{\sqrt z}{z^2+6z+8}\,dz=2\int_0^\infty \frac{\sqrt x}{x^2+6x+8}\,dx.&lt;/math&gt;

By using the residue theorem or the Cauchy integral formula (first employing the partial fractions method to derive a sum of two simple contour integrals) one obtains

: &lt;math&gt;\pi i \left(\frac{i}{\sqrt 2}-i\right)=\int_0^\infty \frac{\sqrt x}{x^2+6x+8}\,dx = \pi\left(1-\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}\right).\quad\square&lt;/math&gt;

===Example 5 ‚Äì the square of the logarithm===
[[Image:KeyholeContourLeft.png|right]]

This section treats a type of integral of which

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty \frac{\log x}{\left(1+x^2\right)^2} \, dx&lt;/math&gt;

is an example.

To calculate this integral, one uses the function

:&lt;math&gt;f(z) = \left (\frac{\log z}{1+z^2} \right )^2&lt;/math&gt;

and the branch of the logarithm corresponding to {{math|‚àíœÄ &lt; arg ''z'' ‚â§ œÄ}}.

We will calculate the integral of {{math|''f''(''z'')}} along the keyhole contour shown at right. As it turns out this integral is a multiple of the initial integral that we wish to calculate and by the Cauchy residue theorem we have

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\left( \int_R + \int_M + \int_N + \int_r \right) f(z) \, dz &amp;= 2 \pi i \big( \operatorname{Res}_{z=i} f(z) + \operatorname{Res}_{z=-i} f(z) \big) \\
&amp;= 2 \pi i \left( - \frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{1}{16} i \pi^2 - \frac{\pi}{4} - \frac{1}{16} i \pi^2 \right) \\
&amp;= - i \pi^2. \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Let {{mvar|R}} be the radius of the large circle, and {{mvar|r}} the radius of the small one. We will denote the upper line by {{mvar|M}}, and the lower line by {{mvar|N}}. As before we take the limit when {{math|''R'' ‚Üí ‚àû}} and {{math|''r'' ‚Üí 0}}. The contributions from the two circles vanish. For example, one has the following upper bound with the [[ML lemma|{{mvar|ML}} lemma]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\left| \int_R f(z) \, dz \right| \le 2 \pi R \frac{(\log R)^2 + \pi^2}{\left(R^2-1\right)^2} \to 0.&lt;/math&gt;

In order to compute the contributions of {{mvar|M}} and {{mvar|N}} we set {{math|''z'' {{=}} ‚àí''x'' + ''iŒµ''}} on {{mvar|M}} and {{math|''z'' {{=}} ‚àí''x'' ‚àí ''iŒµ''}} on {{mvar|N}}, with {{math|0 &lt; ''x'' &lt; ‚àû}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} -i \pi^2 &amp;= \left( \int_R + \int_M + \int_N + \int_r \right) f(z) \, dz \\
&amp;= \left( \int_M + \int_N \right) f(z)\, dz &amp;&amp; \int_R, \int_r \mbox{ vanish} \\
&amp;=-\int_\infty^0 \left (\frac{\log(-x + i\varepsilon)}{1+(-x + i\varepsilon)^2} \right )^2\, dx - \int_0^\infty \left (\frac{\log(-x - i\varepsilon)}{1+(-x - i\varepsilon)^2}\right)^2 \, dx \\
&amp;= \int_0^\infty \left (\frac{\log(-x + i\varepsilon)}{1+(-x + i\varepsilon)^2} \right )^2 \, dx - \int_0^\infty \left (\frac{\log(-x - i\varepsilon)}{1+(-x - i\varepsilon)^2} \right )^2 \, dx \\
&amp;= \int_0^\infty \left (\frac{\log x + i\pi}{1+x^2} \right )^2 \, dx - \int_0^\infty \left (\frac{\log x - i\pi}{1+x^2} \right )^2 \, dx &amp;&amp; \varepsilon \to 0 \\
&amp;= \int_0^\infty \frac{(\log x + i\pi)^2 - (\log x - i\pi)^2}{\left(1+x^2\right)^2} \, dx \\
&amp;= \int_0^\infty \frac{4 \pi i \log x}{\left(1+x^2\right)^2} \, dx \\
&amp;= 4 \pi i \int_0^\infty \frac{\log x}{\left(1+x^2\right)^2} \, dx \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

which gives

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty \frac{\log x}{\left(1+x^2\right)^2} \, dx = - \frac{\pi}{4}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Example 6 ‚Äì logarithms and the residue at infinity===
[[Image:ContourLogs.png|right]]

We seek to evaluate
:&lt;math&gt;I = \int_0^3 \frac{x^\frac34 (3-x)^\frac14}{5-x}\,dx.&lt;/math&gt;

This requires a close study of

:&lt;math&gt;f(z) = z^\frac34 (3-z)^\frac14.&lt;/math&gt;

We will construct {{math|''f''(''z'')}} so that it has a branch cut on {{math|[0, 3]}}, shown in red in the diagram. To do this, we choose two branches of the logarithm, setting

:&lt;math&gt;z^\frac34 = \exp \left (\frac34 \log z \right ) \quad \mbox{where } -\pi \le \arg z &lt; \pi &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;(3-z)^\frac14 = \exp \left (\frac14 \log(3-z) \right ) \quad \mbox{where } 0 \le \arg(3-z) &lt; 2\pi. &lt;/math&gt;

The cut of {{math|''z''&lt;sup&gt;{{3/4}}&lt;/sup&gt;}} is therefore {{math|(‚àí‚àû, 0]}} and the cut of {{math|(3 ‚àí ''z'')&lt;sup&gt;{{1/4}}&lt;/sup&gt;}} is {{math|(‚àí‚àû, 3]}}. It is easy to see that the cut of the product of the two, i.e. {{math|''f''(''z'')}}, is {{math|[0, 3]}}, because {{math|''f''(''z'')}} is actually continuous across {{math|(‚àí‚àû, 0)}}. This is because when {{math|''z'' {{=}} ‚àí''r'' &lt; 0}} and we approach the cut from above, {{math|''f''(''z'')}} has the value

:&lt;math&gt; r^\frac34 e^{\frac34 \pi i} (3+r)^\frac14 e^{\frac24 \pi i} = r^\frac34 (3+r)^\frac14 e^{\frac54 \pi i}.&lt;/math&gt;

When we approach from below, {{math|''f''(''z'')}} has the value

:&lt;math&gt; r^\frac34 e^{-\frac34 \pi i} (3+r)^\frac14 e^{\frac04 \pi i} = r^\frac34 (3+r)^\frac14 e^{-\frac34 \pi i}.&lt;/math&gt;

But

:&lt;math&gt;e^{-\frac34 \pi i} = e^{\frac54 \pi i},&lt;/math&gt;

so that we have continuity across the cut. This is illustrated in the diagram, where the two black oriented circles are labelled with the corresponding value of the argument of the logarithm used in {{math|''z''&lt;sup&gt;{{3/4}}&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|(3 ‚àí ''z'')&lt;sup&gt;{{1/4}}&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

We will use the contour shown in green in the diagram. To do this we must compute the value of {{math|''f''(''z'')}} along the line segments just above and just below the cut.

Let {{math|''z'' {{=}} ''r''}} (in the limit, i.e. as the two green circles shrink to radius zero), where {{math|0 ‚â§ ''r'' ‚â§ 3}}. Along the upper segment, we find that {{math|''f''(''z'')}} has the value

:&lt;math&gt;r^\frac34 e^{\frac04 \pi i} (3-r)^\frac14 e^{\frac24 \pi i} = i r^\frac34 (3-r)^\frac14&lt;/math&gt;

and along the lower segment,

:&lt;math&gt;r^\frac34 e^{\frac04 \pi i} (3-r)^\frac14 e^{\frac04 \pi i} = r^\frac34 (3-r)^\frac14.&lt;/math&gt;

It follows that the integral of {{math|{{sfrac|''f''(''z'')|5 ‚àí ''z''}}}} along the upper segment is {{math|‚àí''iI''}} in the limit, and along the lower segment, {{mvar|I}}.

If we can show that the integrals along the two green circles vanish in the limit, then we also have the value of {{math|I}}, by the [[Cauchy residue theorem]]. Let the radius of the green circles be {{mvar|œÅ}}, where {{math|''œÅ'' &lt; 0.001}} and {{math|''œÅ'' ‚Üí 0}}, and apply the [[Estimation lemma|{{mvar|ML}} inequality]]. For the circle {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;}} on the left, we find

:&lt;math&gt;\left| \int_{C_\mathrm{L}} \frac{f(z)}{5-z} dz \right| \le 2 \pi \rho \frac{\rho^\frac34 3.001^\frac14}{4.999} \in \mathcal{O} \left( \rho^\frac74 \right) \to 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, for the circle {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;}} on the right, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\left| \int_{C_\mathrm{R}} \frac{f(z)}{5-z} dz \right| \le 2 \pi \rho \frac{3.001^\frac34 \rho^\frac14}{1.999} \in \mathcal{O} \left( \rho^\frac54 \right) \to 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Now using the [[Cauchy residue theorem]], we have

:&lt;math&gt;(-i + 1) I = -2\pi i \left( \operatorname{Res}_{z=5} \frac{f(z)}{5-z} + \operatorname{Res}_{z=\infty} \frac{f(z)}{5-z} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

where the minus sign is due to the clockwise direction around the residues. Using the branch of the logarithm from before, clearly

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Res}_{z=5} \frac{f(z)}{5-z} = - 5^\frac34 e^{\frac14 \log(-2)}.&lt;/math&gt;

The pole is shown in blue in the diagram. The value simplifies to

:&lt;math&gt;-5^\frac34 e^{\frac14(\log 2 + \pi i)} = -e^{\frac14 \pi i} 5^\frac34 2^\frac14.&lt;/math&gt;

We use the following formula for the residue at infinity:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Res}_{z=\infty} h(z) = \operatorname{Res}_{z=0} \left(- \frac{1}{z^2} h\left(\frac{1}{z}\right)\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting, we find

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{5-\frac{1}{z}} = -z \left(1 + 5z + 5^2 z^2 + 5^3 z^3 + \cdots\right)&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{1}{z^3}\left (3-\frac{1}{z} \right )\right)^\frac14 = \frac{1}{z} (3z-1)^\frac14 = \frac{1}{z}e^{\frac14 \pi i} (1-3z)^\frac14, &lt;/math&gt;

where we have used the fact that {{math|‚àí1 {{=}} ''e''&lt;sup&gt;œÄ''i''&lt;/sup&gt;}} for the second branch of the logarithm. Next we apply the binomial expansion, obtaining

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{z} e^{\frac14 \pi i} \left( 1 - {\frac14 \choose 1} 3z + {\frac14 \choose 2} 3^2 z^2 - {\frac14 \choose 3} 3^3 z^3 + \cdots \right). &lt;/math&gt;

The conclusion is that

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Res}_{z=\infty} \frac{f(z)}{5-z} = e^{\frac14 \pi i} \left (5 - \frac34 \right ) = e^{\frac14 \pi i}\frac{17}{4}.&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, it follows that the value of {{mvar|I}} is

:&lt;math&gt; I = 2 \pi i \frac{e^{\frac14 \pi i}}{-1+i} \left(\frac{17}{4} - 5^\frac34 2^\frac14 \right) = 2 \pi 2^{-\frac12} \left(\frac{17}{4} - 5^\frac34 2^\frac14 \right)&lt;/math&gt;

which yields

:&lt;math&gt;I = \frac{\pi}{2\sqrt 2} \left(17 - 5^\frac34 2^\frac94 \right) = \frac{\pi}{2\sqrt 2} \left(17 - 40^\frac34 \right).&lt;/math&gt;

An '''integral representation''' of a function is an expression of the function involving a contour integral. Various integral representations are known for many [[special function]]s. Integral representations can be important for theoretical reasons, e.g. giving [[analytic continuation]] or [[functional equation]]s, or sometimes for [[numerical evaluation]]s.

For example, the original definition of the [[Riemann zeta function]] {{math|''Œ∂''(''s'')}} via a [[Dirichlet series]],
:&lt;math&gt;\zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{n^s},&lt;/math&gt;
is valid only for {{math|Re(''s'') &gt; 1}}. But

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta(s) = - \frac{\Gamma(1 - s)}{2 \pi i} \int_H\frac{(-t)^{s-1}}{e^t - 1} dt ,&lt;/math&gt;

where the integration is done over the [[Hankel contour]] {{mvar|H}}, is valid for all complex s not equal to 1.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10913">In [[game theory]], the '''core''' is the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of [[Feasible region|feasible]] allocations that cannot be improved upon by a subset (a ''coalition'') of the economy's [[Agent (economics)|agents]].  A coalition is said to ''improve upon'' or ''block'' a feasible allocation if the members of that coalition are better off under another feasible allocation that is identical to the first except that every member of the coalition has a different consumption bundle that is part of an aggregate consumption bundle that can be constructed from publicly available technology and the initial endowments of each consumer in the coalition.

An allocation is said to have the ''core property'' if there is no coalition that can improve upon it. The core is the set of all feasible allocations with the core property.

==Origin==
The idea of the core already appeared in the writings of {{harvtxt|Edgeworth|1881}}, at the time referred to as the ''contract curve''.&lt;ref name="Kannai 1992"&gt;{{Cite book

==Definition==
Consider a [[transferable utility]] [[cooperative game]] &lt;math&gt;(N,v)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; denotes the set of players and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Game theory#Characteristic function form|characteristic function]]. An [[Imputation (game theory)|imputation]] &lt;math&gt;x\in\mathbb{R}^N&lt;/math&gt; is dominated by another imputation &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; if there exists a coalition &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, such that each player in &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; prefers &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, formally: &lt;math&gt;x_i\leq y_i&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;i\in C&lt;/math&gt; and there exists &lt;math&gt;i\in C&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;y_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; can enforce &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; (by threatening to leave the [[Glossary of game theory#Glossary|grand coalition]] to form &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;), formally: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i\in C}y_i\leq v(C)&lt;/math&gt;. An imputation &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is ''dominated'' if there exists an imputation &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; dominating it.

When the '''core''' exists and is not empty, it is the set of imputations that are not dominated.&lt;ref&gt;As noted by {{cite journal |last=Shapley |first=L. S. |last2=Shubik |first2=M. |title=On Market Games |journal=[[Journal of Economic Theory]] |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=9‚Äì25 |year=1969 |doi=10.1016/0022-0531(69)90008-8 }} due to the contribution of Mr. E. Kohlberg&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
* Another definition, [[Logical equivalence|equivalent]] to the one above, states that the core is a set of payoff allocations &lt;math&gt;x\in\mathbb{R}^N&lt;/math&gt; satisfying
#Efficiency: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i\in N}x_i=v(N)&lt;/math&gt;,
#Coalitional rationality: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i\in C}x_i\geq v(C)&lt;/math&gt; for all subsets (coalitions) &lt;math&gt;C\subseteq N&lt;/math&gt;.
* The core is always well-defined, but can be [[empty set|empty]].
* The core is a set which satisfies a system of weak [[linear]] inequalities. Hence the core is [[Closed set|closed]] and [[Convex set|convex]].
* The [[Bondareva‚ÄìShapley theorem]]: the core of a game is nonempty [[if and only if]] the game is "balanced".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

* Every [[Walrasian equilibrium]] has the core property, but not ''vice versa''. The [[Edgeworth conjecture]] states that, given additional assumptions, the limit of the core as the number of consumers goes to infinity is a set of Walrasian equilibria.
* Let there be ''n'' players, where ''n'' is odd. A game that proposes to divide one unit of a good among a coalition having at least (''n''+1)/2  members has an empty core. That is, no stable coalition exists.

==Example==

===Example 1: Miners===
Consider a group of ''n'' miners, who have discovered large bars of gold.  If two miners can carry one piece of gold, then the payoff of a coalition ''S'' is

:&lt;math&gt;v(S) = \begin{cases} |S|/2, &amp; \text{if }|S|\text{ is even}; \\ (|S|-1)/2, &amp; \text{if }|S|\text{ is odd}. \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

If there are more than two miners and there is an even number of miners, then the core consists of the single payoff where each miner gets 1/2. If there is an odd number of miners, then the core is empty.

===Example 2: Gloves===
Mr A and Mr B are knitting gloves. The gloves are one-size-fits-all, and two gloves make a pair that they sell for ‚Ç¨5. They have each made three gloves. How to share the proceeds from the sale? The problem can be described by a [[Game theory#Characteristic function form|characteristic function form]] game with the following characteristic function: Each man has three gloves, that is one pair with a market value of ‚Ç¨5. Together, they have 6 gloves or 3 pair, having a market value of ‚Ç¨15. Since the singleton coalitions (consisting of a single man) are the only non-trivial coalitions of the game all possible distributions of this sum belong to the core, provided both men get at least ‚Ç¨5, the amount they can achieve on their own. For instance (7.5, 7.5) belongs to the core, but so does (5, 10) or (9, 6).

===Example 3: Shoes===
For the moment ignore shoe sizes: a pair consists of a left and a right shoe, which can then be sold for ‚Ç¨10. Consider a game with 2001 players: 1000 of them have 1 left shoe, 1001 have 1 right shoe. The core of this game is somewhat surprising: it consists of a single imputation that gives 10 to those having a (scarce) left shoe, and 0 to those owning an (oversupplied) right shoe. No coalition can block this outcome, because no left shoe owner will accept less than 10, and any imputation that pays a positive amount to any right shoe owner must pay less than 10000 in total to the other players, who can get 10000 on their own. So, there is just one imputation in the core.

The message remains the same, even if we increase the numbers as long as left shoes are scarcer. The core has been criticized for being so extremely sensitive to oversupply of one type of player.

==The core in general equilibrium theory==
The Walrasian equilibria of an exchange economy in a general equilibrium model, will lie in the core of the cooperation game between the agents. Graphically, and in a two-agent economy (see Edgeworth Box), the core is the set of points on the contract curve (the set of Pareto optimal allocations) lying between each of the agents' indifference curves defined at the initial endowments.

==The core in voting theory==
When alternatives are allocations (list of consumption bundles), it is natural to assume that any nonempty subsets of individuals can block a given allocation.
When alternatives are public (such as the amount of a certain public good), however, it is more appropriate to assume that only the coalitions that are large enough can block a given alternative.  The collection of such large ("winning") coalitions is called a ''simple game''.
The ''core of a simple game with respect to a profile of preferences'' is based on the idea that only winning coalitions can reject an alternative &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in favor of another alternative &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.  A necessary and sufficient condition for the core to be nonempty for all profile of preferences, is provided in terms of the [[Nakamura number]] for the simple game.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7086">In mathematics, the '''Coxeter complex''', named after [[H. S. M. Coxeter]], is a geometrical structure (a [[simplicial complex]]) associated to a [[Coxeter group]]. Coxeter complexes are the basic objects that allow the construction of [[building (mathematics)|buildings]]; they form the apartments of a building.

==Construction==
===The canonical linear representation===
The first ingredient in the construction of the Coxeter complex associated to a Coxeter group ''W'' is a certain [[representation (mathematics)|representation]] of ''W'', called the canonical representation of ''W''.

Let &lt;math&gt;(W,S)&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Coxeter group|Coxeter system]] associated to ''W'', with [[Coxeter group#Coxeter matrix|Coxeter matrix]] &lt;math&gt; M = (m(s,t))_{s,t \in S}&lt;/math&gt;. The canonical representation is given by a vector space ''V'' with basis of formal symbols &lt;math&gt; (e_s)_{s \in S}&lt;/math&gt;, which is equipped with the symmetric bilinear form &lt;math&gt; B(e_s,e_t) = - \cos \left ( \frac{\pi}{m(s,t)} \right )&lt;/math&gt;. The action of ''W'' on this vector space ''V'' is then given by &lt;math&gt; s(v) = v - 2 \frac{B(e_s,v)}{B(e_s,e_s)}e_s&lt;/math&gt;, as motivated by the expression for reflections in [[root system]]s.

This representation has several foundational properties in the theory of Coxeter groups; for instance, the bilinear form ''B'' is positive definite if and only if ''W'' is finite. It is (always) a [[faithful representation]] of ''W''.

===Chambers and the Tits cone===
One can think of this representation as expressing ''W'' as some sort of reflection group, with the caveat that ''B'' might not be positive definite. It becomes important then to distinguish the representation ''V'' from its dual ''V''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;. The vectors &lt;math&gt;e_s&lt;/math&gt; lie in ''V'', and have corresponding dual vectors &lt;math&gt;e_s^\vee&lt;/math&gt; in ''V''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, given by:

: &lt;math&gt; \langle e_s^\vee, v \rangle = 2 \frac{B(e_s,v)}{B(e_s,e_s)},&lt;/math&gt;

where the angled brackets indicate the natural pairing of a dual vector in ''V''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; with a vector of ''V'', and ''B'' is the bilinear form as above.

Now ''W'' acts on ''V''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, and the action satisfies the formula

: &lt;math&gt; s(f) = f - \langle f, e_s \rangle e_s^\vee, &lt;/math&gt;

for &lt;math&gt; s \in S&lt;/math&gt; and any ''f'' in ''V''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;. This expresses ''s'' as a reflection in the hyperplane &lt;math&gt; H_s = \{ f \in V^*: \langle f, e_s \rangle = 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;. One has the fundamental chamber &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C} = \{ f \in V^* : \langle f, e_s \rangle &gt; 0 \ \forall s \in S \}&lt;/math&gt;, this has faces the so-called walls, &lt;math&gt;H_s&lt;/math&gt;. The other chambers can be obtained from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; by translation: they are the &lt;math&gt; w\mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; w \in W&lt;/math&gt;.

Given a fundamental chamber &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;, the '''Tits cone''' is defined to be &lt;math&gt; X = \bigcup_{w \in W} w \overline{\mathcal{C}}&lt;/math&gt;. This need not be the whole of ''V''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;. Of major importance is the fact that the Tits cone ''X'' is convex. The action of ''W'' on the Tits cone ''X'' has [[fundamental domain]] the fundamental chamber &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;.

===The Coxeter complex===
Once one has defined the Tits cone ''X'', the Coxeter complex &lt;math&gt;\Sigma(W,S)&lt;/math&gt; of ''W'' with respect to ''S'' can be defined as the quotient of ''X'', with the origin removed, by the [[positive reals]] (‚Ñù&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, √ó):
:&lt;math&gt; \Sigma(W,S) = (X \setminus \{ 0 \}) / \mathbb{R}^+&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==
===Finite dihedral groups===
The dihedral groups &lt;math&gt;D_n&lt;/math&gt; (of order 2''n'') are Coxeter groups, of corresponding type &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{I}_2(n)&lt;/math&gt;. These have the presentation &lt;math&gt; \left \langle s, t \, \left | \, s^2, t^2, (st)^n \right \rangle \right . &lt;/math&gt;.

The canonical linear representation of &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{I}_2(n)&lt;/math&gt; is the usual reflection representation of the dihedral group, as acting on a ''n''-gon in the plane (so &lt;math&gt; V = \mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; in this case). For instance, in the case ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3, we get the Coxeter group of type &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{I}_2(3) = \mathrm{A}_2&lt;/math&gt;, acting on an equilateral triangle in the plane. Each reflection ''s'' has an associated hyperplane ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; in the dual vector space (which can be canonically identified with the vector space itself using the bilinear form ''B'', which is an inner product in this case as remarked above), these are the walls. They cut out chambers, as seen below:

[[File:Spherical dihedral complex.svg | 300px]]

The Coxeter complex is then the corresponding 2''n''-gon, as in the image above. This is a simplicial complex of dimension 1, and it can be colored by cotype.

===The infinite dihedral group===
Another motivating example is the [[infinite dihedral group]] &lt;math&gt; D_{\infty} &lt;/math&gt;. This can be seen as the group of symmetries of the real line that preserves the set of points with integer coordinates; it is generated by the reflections in &lt;math&gt; x= 0 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; x = {1 \over 2} &lt;/math&gt;. This group has the Coxeter presentation &lt;math&gt; \left \langle s, t \, \left | \, s^2, t^2 \right \rangle \right . &lt;/math&gt;.

In this case, it is no longer possible to identify ''V'' with the dual space ''V''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, as ''B'' is not positive definite. It is then better to work solely with ''V''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, which is where the hyperplanes are defined. This then gives the following picture:

[[Image:Affine dihedral complex.svg|300px]]

In this case, the Tits cone is not the whole plane, but only the upper half plane. Quotienting out by the positive reals then yields another copy of the real line, with marked points at the integers. This is the Coxeter complex of the infinite dihedral group.

==Alternative construction of the Coxeter complex==
Another description of the Coxeter complex uses standard cosets of the Coxeter group ''W''. A standard coset is a coset of the form &lt;math&gt; w W_J &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; W_J = \langle J \rangle&lt;/math&gt; for some subset ''J'' of ''S''. For instance, &lt;math&gt; W_S = W &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; W_\emptyset = \{1\}&lt;/math&gt;. 

The Coxeter complex &lt;math&gt; \Sigma(W,S) &lt;/math&gt; is then the [[poset]] of standard cosets, ordered by reverse inclusion. This has a canonical structure of a simplicial complex, as do all posets that satisfy:
*Any two elements have a greatest lower bound.
*The poset of elements less than or equal to any given element is isomorphic to the poset of subsets of &lt;math&gt; \{1, 2, \ldots, n \}&lt;/math&gt; for some integer&amp;nbsp;''n''.

==Properties==
The Coxeter complex associated to &lt;math&gt;(W,S)&lt;/math&gt; has dimension &lt;math&gt;|S|-1&lt;/math&gt;. It is homeomorphic to a &lt;math&gt;(|S|-1)&lt;/math&gt;-sphere if ''W'' is finite and is [[contractible space|contractible]] if ''W'' is infinite.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3119">In [[mathematical logic]], '''Diaconescu's theorem''', or the '''Goodman‚ÄìMyhill theorem''', states that the full [[axiom of choice]] is sufficient to derive the [[law of the excluded middle]], or restricted forms of it, in [[constructive set theory]]. It was discovered in 1975 by Diaconescu&lt;ref&gt;R. Diaconescu, {{doi-inline|10.1090/S0002-9939-1975-0373893-X|"Axiom of choice and complementation"}}, Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society 51:176-178 (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; and later by Goodman and [[John Myhill|Myhill]].&lt;ref&gt;N. D. Goodman and J. Myhill, ‚ÄúChoice Implies Excluded Middle‚Äù, Zeitschrift fur Mathematische Logik und Grundlagen der Mathematik 24:461 (1978)&lt;/ref&gt; Already in 1967, [[Errett Bishop]] posed the Theorem as an exercise (Problem 2 on page 58 in ''Foundations of constructive analysis''&lt;ref&gt;E. Bishop, ''Foundations of constructive analysis'', McGraw-Hill (1967)&lt;/ref&gt;).

== Proof ==

For any [[proposition]] &lt;math&gt;P\,&lt;/math&gt;, we can [[Set-builder notation|build the sets]]
: &lt;math&gt;U = \{x \in \{0, 1\} : (x = 0) \vee P\}&lt;/math&gt; 
and
: &lt;math&gt;V = \{x \in \{0, 1\} : (x = 1) \vee P\}.&lt;/math&gt; 

These are sets, using the [[axiom of specification]]. In classical set theory this would be equivalent to 
: &lt;math&gt;U = \begin{cases} \{0,1\}, &amp; \mbox{if } P \\ \{0\}, &amp; \mbox{if } \neg P\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt; 
and similarly for &lt;math&gt;V\,&lt;/math&gt;. However, without the law of the excluded middle, these equivalences cannot be proven; in fact the two sets are not even provably [[finite set|finite]] (in the usual sense of being in [[bijection]] with a [[natural number]], though they would be in the [[Dedekind-infinite|Dedekind]] sense). 

Assuming the [[axiom of choice]], there exists a [[choice function]] for the set &lt;math&gt;\{U, V\}\,&lt;/math&gt;; that is, a function &lt;math&gt;f\,&lt;/math&gt; such that 

: &lt;math&gt;[f(U) \in U] \wedge [f(V) \in V].\,&lt;/math&gt;

By the definition of the two sets, this means that

: &lt;math&gt;[(f(U) = 0) \vee P] \wedge [(f(V) = 1) \vee P]\,&lt;/math&gt;, 

which implies &lt;math&gt;f(U) \neq f(V) \vee P.&lt;/math&gt;

But since &lt;math&gt;P \to (U = V)&lt;/math&gt; (by the [[axiom of extensionality]]), therefore &lt;math&gt;P \to (f(U) = f(V))\,&lt;/math&gt;, so

: &lt;math&gt;(f(U) \neq f(V)) \to \neg P.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus &lt;math&gt;\neg P \vee P.&lt;/math&gt; As this could be done for any proposition, this completes the proof that the axiom of choice implies the law of the excluded middle. 

The proof relies on the use of the full separation axiom. In constructive set theories with only the [[axiom schema of predicative separation|predicative separation]], the form of ''P'' will be restricted to sentences with bound quantifiers only, giving only a restricted form of the law of the excluded middle. This restricted form is still not acceptable constructively.

In [[constructive type theory]], or in [[Heyting arithmetic]] extended with finite types, there is typically no separation at all - subsets of a type are given different treatments. A form of the axiom of choice is a theorem, yet excluded middle is not.

'''Electroencephalography''' ('''EEG''') is an [[electrophysiology|electrophysiological]] monitoring method to record electrical activity of the [[brain]]. It is typically noninvasive, with the [[electrode]]s placed along the [[scalp]], although invasive electrodes are sometimes used such as in [[electrocorticography]]. EEG measures voltage fluctuations resulting from [[ion current|ionic current]] within the [[neurons]] of the [[brain]].&lt;ref name = "Niedermeyer"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Niedermeyer E. |author2=da Silva F.L. | title = Electroencephalography: Basic Principles, Clinical Applications, and Related Fields | publisher = Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins | year = 2004| isbn = 978-0-7817-5126-1}}{{page needed|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In clinical contexts, EEG refers to the recording of the brain's spontaneous electrical activity over a period of time,&lt;ref name="Niedermeyer"/&gt; as recorded from multiple [[electrode]]s placed on the scalp. Diagnostic applications generally focus either on [[event-related potential]]s or on the [[frequency spectrum|spectral content]] of EEG. The former investigates potential fluctuations time locked to an event like stimulus onset or button press. The latter analyses the type of [[neural oscillation]]s (popularly called "brain waves") that can be observed in EEG signals in the frequency domain.

EEG is most often used to diagnose [[epilepsy]], which causes abnormalities in EEG readings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/874563370|title=Handbook of EEG interpretation|last=Tatum|first=William O.|publisher=Demos Medical Publishing|year=2014|isbn=9781617051807|location=|pages=155‚Äì190|oclc=874563370|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used to diagnose [[sleep disorder]]s, depth of [[anesthesia]], [[coma]], [[encephalopathies]], and [[brain death]]. EEG used to be a first-line method of diagnosis for [[tumor]]s, [[stroke]] and other focal brain disorders,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EEG|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003931.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chernecky|first1=Cynthia C.|last2=Berger|first2=Barbara J.|title=Laboratory tests and diagnostic procedures|date=2013|publisher=Elsevier|location=St. Louis, Mo.|isbn=9781455706945|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this use has decreased with the advent of high-resolution anatomical imaging techniques such as [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) and [[computed tomography]] (CT). Despite limited spatial resolution, EEG continues to be a valuable tool for research and diagnosis. It is one of the few mobile techniques available and offers millisecond-range temporal resolution which is not possible with CT, PET or MRI.

Derivatives of the EEG technique include [[evoked potential]]s (EP), which involves averaging the EEG activity time-locked to the presentation of a stimulus of some sort (visual, [[somatosensory]], or auditory). [[Event-related potentials]] (ERPs) refer to averaged EEG responses that are time-locked to more complex processing of stimuli; this technique is used in [[cognitive science]], [[cognitive psychology]], and [[psychophysiology|psychophysiological]] research.

[[File:HansBerger Univ Jena.jpeg|thumb|[[Hans Berger]]]]

The history of EEG is detailed by Barbara E. Swartz in ''Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0013-4694(97)00113-2 |title=The advantages of digital over analog recording techniques |year=1998 |last1=Swartz |first1=Barbara E. |journal=Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology |volume=106 |issue=2 |pages=113‚Äì7 |pmid=9741771}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1875, [[Richard Caton]] (1842‚Äì1926), a physician practicing in [[Liverpool]], presented his findings about electrical phenomena of the exposed cerebral hemispheres of rabbits and monkeys in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]''.  In 1890, Polish physiologist [[Adolf Beck (physiologist)|Adolf Beck]] published an investigation of spontaneous electrical activity of the brain of rabbits and dogs that included rhythmic oscillations altered by light. Beck started experiments on the electrical brain activity of animals. Beck placed electrodes directly on the surface of brain to test for sensory stimulation. His observation of fluctuating brain activity led to the conclusion of brain waves.&lt;ref name="Adolf Beck pioneer"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Coenen, Anton |last2=Edward Fine |last3=Oksana Zayachkivska |title=Adolf Beck: A Forgotten Pioneer In Electroencephalography |journal=Journal of the History of the Neurosciences |volume=23 |issue=3 |date=2014|pages=276‚Äì286 |doi=10.1080/0964704x.2013.867600|pmid=24735457 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1912, Ukrainian physiologist [[Vladimir Pravdich-Neminsky|Vladimir Vladimirovich Pravdich-Neminsky]] published the first animal EEG and the [[evoked potential]] of the [[mammal]]ian (dog).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pravdich-Neminsky | first1 = VV. | year = 1913 | title = Ein Versuch der Registrierung der elektrischen Gehirnerscheinungen | url = | journal = Zentralblatt f√ºr Physiologie | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 951‚Äì60 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1914, [[Napoleon Cybulski]] and Jelenska-Macieszyna photographed EEG recordings of experimentally induced seizures.

German physiologist and psychiatrist [[Hans Berger]] (1873‚Äì1941) recorded the first human EEG in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jnnp.74.1.9 |title=Hans Berger (1873-1941), Richard Caton (1842-1926), and electroencephalography |year=2003 |last1=Haas |first1=L F |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery &amp; Psychiatry |volume=74 |pages=9 |pmid=12486257 |issue=1 |pmc=1738204}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expanding on work previously conducted on animals by Richard Caton and others, Berger also invented the electroencephalogram (giving the device its name), an invention described "as one of the most surprising, remarkable, and momentous developments in the history of clinical neurology".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bri.ucla.edu/nha/ishn/ab24-2002.htm  Millet, David (2002). "The Origins of EEG".]'' International Society for the History of the Neurosciences'' (ISHN).&lt;/ref&gt; His discoveries were first confirmed by British scientists [[Edgar Douglas Adrian]] and B. H. C. Matthews in 1934 and developed by them.

In 1934, Fisher and Lowenback first demonstrated epileptiform spikes. In 1935, Gibbs, Davis and Lennox described inter[[ictal]] spike waves and the three cycles/s pattern of clinical [[absence seizure]]s, which began the field of clinical electroencephalography. Subsequently, in 1936 Gibbs and Jasper reported the interictal spike as the focal signature of epilepsy. The same year, the first EEG laboratory opened at Massachusetts General Hospital.

Franklin Offner (1911‚Äì1999), professor of biophysics at [[Northwestern University]] developed a prototype of the EEG that incorporated a piezoelectric inkwriter called a [[Crystograph]] (the whole device was typically known as the [[Offner Dynograph]]).

In 1947, The American EEG Society was founded and the first International EEG congress was held. In 1953 Aserinsky and Kleitman described REM sleep.

In the 1950s, [[William Grey Walter]] developed an adjunct to EEG called [[EEG topography]], which allowed for the mapping of electrical activity across the surface of the brain.  This enjoyed a brief period of popularity in the 1980s and seemed especially promising for psychiatry.  It was never accepted by neurologists and remains primarily a research tool.

In 1988, report was given on EEG control of a physical object, a robot.&lt;ref&gt;S. Bozinovski, M. Sestakov, L. Bozinovska: Using EEG alpha rhythm to control a mobile robot, In G. Harris, C. Walker (eds.) Proc. IEEE Annual Conference of Medical and Biological Society, p. 1515-1516, New Orleans, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Bozinovski: Mobile robot trajectory control: From fixed rails to direct bioelectric control, In O. Kaynak (ed.) Proc. IEEE Workshop on Intelligent Motion Control, p. 63-67, Istanbul, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, scientists connected the brains of three people to experiment with the process of thoughts sharing. Five groups of three people participated in the experiment using EEG. The success rate of the experiment was 81%. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-to-brain-mind-connection-lets-three-people-share-thoughts|title=Scientists Have Connected The Brains of 3 People, Enabling Them to Share Thoughts|last=Nield|first=David|work=ScienceAlert|access-date=2018-10-05|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.geek.com/news/social-network-brainnet-lets-people-communicate-mentally-1754205/|title='Social Network' BrainNet Lets People Communicate Mentally - Geek.com|date=2018-10-03|work=Geek.com|access-date=2018-10-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical use==
[[File:EEG cap.jpg|alt=|thumb|An EEG recording setup]]
A routine clinical EEG recording typically lasts 20‚Äì30 minutes (plus preparation time) and usually involves recording from scalp electrodes. Routine EEG is typically used in clinical circumstances to distinguish [[epilepsy|epileptic]] [[seizure]]s from other types of spells, such as [[psychogenic non-epileptic seizures]], [[fainting|syncope (fainting)]], sub-cortical [[movement disorder]]s and [[migraine]] variants, to differentiate "organic" [[encephalopathy]] or [[delirium]] from primary psychiatric syndromes such as [[catatonia]], to serve as an adjunct test of [[brain death]], to prognosticate, in certain instances, in patients with coma, and to determine whether to wean anti-epileptic medications.

At times, a routine EEG is not sufficient to establish the diagnosis and/or to determine the best course of action in terms of treatment. In this case, attempts may be made to record an EEG while a seizure is occurring. This is known as an [[ictal]] recording, as opposed to an inter-ictal recording which refers to the EEG recording between seizures. To obtain an ictal recording, a prolonged EEG is typically performed accompanied by a time-synchronized video and audio recording. This can be done either as an outpatient (at home) or during a hospital admission, preferably to an [[Epilepsy Monitoring Unit]] (EMU) with nurses and other personnel trained in the care of patients with seizures. Outpatient ambulatory video EEGs typically last one to three days. An admission to an Epilepsy Monitoring Unit typically lasts several days but may last for a week or longer. While in the hospital, seizure medications are usually withdrawn to increase the odds that a seizure will occur during admission. For reasons of safety, medications are not withdrawn during an EEG outside of the hospital. Ambulatory video EEGs therefore have the advantage of convenience and are less expensive than a hospital admission, but the disadvantage of a decreased probability of recording a clinical event.

Epilepsy monitoring is typically done to distinguish [[epilepsy|epileptic]] [[seizure]]s from other types of spells, such as [[psychogenic non-epileptic seizures]], [[syncope (medicine)|syncope (fainting)]], sub-cortical [[movement disorder]]s and [[migraine]] variants, to [[seizure types|characterize seizures]] for the purposes of treatment, and to localize the region of brain from which a seizure originates for work-up of possible seizure surgery.

Additionally, EEG may be used to monitor the depth of [[anesthesia]], as an indirect indicator of cerebral perfusion in [[carotid endarterectomy]], or to monitor amobarbital effect during the [[Wada test]].

EEG can also be used in [[intensive care unit]]s for brain function monitoring to monitor for non-convulsive seizures/non-convulsive status epilepticus, to monitor the effect of sedative/anesthesia in patients in medically induced coma (for treatment of refractory seizures or increased [[intracranial pressure]]), and to monitor for secondary brain damage in conditions such as [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]] (currently a research method).

If a patient with epilepsy is being considered for [[epilepsy surgery|resective surgery]], it is often necessary to localize the focus (source) of the epileptic brain activity with a resolution greater than what is provided by scalp EEG. This is because the [[cerebrospinal fluid]], skull and scalp ''smear'' the electrical potentials recorded by scalp EEG. In these cases, neurosurgeons typically implant strips and grids of electrodes (or penetrating depth electrodes) under the [[dura mater]], through either a [[craniotomy]] or a [[burr hole]]. The recording of these signals is referred to as [[electrocorticography]] (ECoG), subdural EEG (sdEEG) or intracranial EEG (icEEG)--all terms for the same thing. The signal recorded from ECoG is on a different scale of activity than the brain activity recorded from scalp EEG. Low voltage, high frequency components that cannot be seen easily (or at all) in scalp EEG can be seen clearly in ECoG. Further, smaller electrodes (which cover a smaller parcel of brain surface) allow even lower voltage, faster components of brain activity to be seen. Some clinical sites record from penetrating microelectrodes.&lt;ref name="Niedermeyer"/&gt;

Recent studies using [[machine learning]] techniques such as [[neural networks]] with statistical temporal features extracted from [[frontal lobe]] EEG brainwave data has shown high levels of success in classifying mental states (Relaxed, Neutral, Concentrating)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bird |first1=Jordan J. |last2=Manso |first2=Luis J. |last3=Ekart |first3=Aniko |last4=Faria |first4=Diego R. |title=A Study on Mental State Classification using EEG-based Brain-Machine Interface |date=September 2018 |publisher=9th international Conference on Intelligent Systems 2018 |location=Madeira Island, Portugal |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328615252_A_Study_on_Mental_State_Classification_using_EEG-based_Brain-Machine_Interface |accessdate=3 December 2018 |ref=birdeegmentalstates}}&lt;/ref&gt; and mental emotional states (Negative, Neutral, Positive)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bird |first1=Jordan J. |last2=Ekart |first2=Aniko |last3=Buckingham |first3=Christopher D. |last4=Faria |first4=Diego R. |title=Mental Emotional Sentiment Classification with an EEG-based Brain-Machine Interface |date=2019 |publisher=The International Conference on Digital Image and Signal Processing (DISP'19) |location=St Hugh's College, University of Oxford, United Kingdom |url=https://www.disp-conference.org |accessdate=3 December 2018 |ref=birdeegemotions}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

But research on mental disabilities, such as [[auditory processing disorder]] (APD), [[ADD]], or [[ADHD]], is becoming more widely known and EEGs are used as research and treatment.

===Advantages===
Several other methods to study brain function exist, including [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), [[positron emission tomography]] (PET), [[magnetoencephalography]] (MEG), [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] (NMR or MRS), [[electrocorticography]] (EEG), [[single-photon emission computed tomography]] (SPECT), [[near-infrared spectroscopy]] (NIRS), and [[event-related optical signal]] (EROS). Despite the relatively poor spatial sensitivity of EEG, it possesses multiple advantages over some of these techniques:
* Hardware costs are significantly lower than those of most other techniques &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00004691-199901000-00001 |title=Continuous EEG Monitoring in the Intensive Care Unit: Early Findings and Clinical Efficacy |year=1999 |last1=Vespa |first1=Paul M. |last2=Nenov |first2=Val |last3=Nuwer |first3=Marc R. |journal=Journal of Clinical Neurophysiology |volume=16 |pages=1‚Äì13 |pmid=10082088 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*EEG prevents limited availability of technologists to provide immediate care in high traffic hospitals.&lt;ref name="Techinical tips"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schultz, Teal L.|title=Technical Tips: MRI Compatible EEG Electrodes: Advantages, Disadvantages, And Financial Feasibility In A Clinical Setting|journal=Neurodiagnostic Journal 52.1|date=2012|pages=69‚Äì81}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* EEG sensors can be used in more places than fMRI, SPECT, PET, MRS, or MEG, as these techniques require bulky and immobile equipment. For example, MEG requires equipment consisting of [[liquid helium]]-cooled detectors that can be used only in magnetically shielded rooms, altogether costing upwards of several million dollars;&lt;ref name="H√§m√§l√§inen et al 1993"&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1993RvMP...65..413H |title=Magnetoencephalography-theory, instrumentation, and applications to noninvasive studies of the working human brain |last1=H√§m√§l√§inen |first1=Matti |last2=Hari |first2=Riitta |first3=Risto J. |first4=Jukka |first5=Olli V. |volume=65 |year=1993 |pages=413‚Äì97 |journal=Reviews of Modern Physics |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.65.413 |issue=2 |last3=Ilmoniemi |last4=Knuutila |last5=Lounasmaa|url=https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/handle/123456789/18757 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and fMRI requires the use of a 1-ton magnet in, again, a shielded room.
* EEG has very high temporal resolution, on the order of milliseconds rather than seconds. EEG is commonly recorded at sampling rates between 250 and 2000&amp;nbsp;Hz in clinical and research settings, but modern EEG data collection systems are capable of recording at sampling rates above 20,000&amp;nbsp;Hz if desired.

* EEG is relatively tolerant of subject movement, unlike most other neuroimaging techniques.

* EEG does not involve exposure to high-intensity (&gt;1 tesla) magnetic fields, as in some of the other techniques, especially MRI and MRS.

* ERP studies can be conducted with relatively simple paradigms, compared with IE block-design fMRI studies
* Extremely uninvasive, unlike [[Electrocorticography]], which actually requires electrodes to be placed on the surface of the brain.

EEG also has some characteristics that compare favorably with behavioral testing:
* EEG can detect covert processing (i.e., processing that does not require a response)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mulholland |first1=Thomas |chapter=Objective EEG Methods for Studying Covert Shifts of Visual Attention |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=esv8GMVwHwEC&amp;pg=PA109 |pages=109‚Äì51 |year=2012 |editor1-first=F.

* EEG is a powerful tool for tracking brain changes during different phases of life. EEG sleep analysis can indicate significant aspects of the timing of brain development, including evaluating adolescent brain maturation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1152/ajpregu.00422.2012 |laysummary=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/03/130319102757.htm |laydate=March 19, 2013 |laysource=ScienceDaily |title=Longitudinal sleep EEG trajectories indicate complex patterns of adolescent brain maturation |year=2012 |last1=Feinberg |first1=I. |last2=Campbell |first2=I.

* In EEG there is a better understanding of what signal is measured as compared to other research techniques, i.e. the BOLD response in MRI.

===Disadvantages===
* Low spatial resolution on the scalp. [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]], for example, can directly display areas of the brain that are active, while EEG requires intense interpretation just to hypothesize what areas are activated by a particular response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Srinivasan |first=Ramesh |year=1999 |title=Methods to Improve the Spatial Resolution of EEG |journal=International Journal |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=102‚Äì11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* EEG poorly measures neural activity that occurs below the upper layers of the brain (the cortex).
* Unlike [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] and MRS, cannot identify specific locations in the brain at which various neurotransmitters, drugs, etc. can be found.&lt;ref name="radioligandPETExample" /&gt;
* Often takes a long time to connect a subject to EEG, as it requires precise placement of dozens of electrodes around the head and the use of various gels, saline solutions, and/or pastes to keep them in place (although a cap can be used). While the length of time differs dependent on the specific EEG device used, as a general rule it takes considerably less time to prepare a subject for MEG, fMRI, MRS, and SPECT.
* Signal-to-noise ratio is poor, so sophisticated data analysis and relatively large numbers of subjects are needed to extract useful information from EEG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Alois |last1=Schl√∂gl |first2=Mel |last2=Slater |first3=Gert |last3=Pfurtscheller |year=2002 |title=Presence research and EEG |url=http://www-dept.cs.ucl.ac.uk/research/equator/papers/Documents2002/Mel_presence_2002.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===With other neuroimaging techniques===
Simultaneous EEG recordings and fMRI scans have been obtained successfully,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0730-725X(02)00496-4 |title=Correlations and dissociations between BOLD signal and P300 amplitude in an auditory oddball task: A parametric approach to combining fMRI and ERP |year=2002 |last1=Horovitz |first1=Silvina G. |last2=Skudlarski |first2=Pawel |last3=Gore |first3=John C. |journal=Magnetic Resonance Imaging |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=319‚Äì25 |pmid=12165350}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1053-8119(03)00286-6 |title=EEG-correlated fMRI of human alpha activity |year=2003 |last1=Laufs |first1=H |last2=Kleinschmidt |first2=A |last3=Beyerle |first3=A |last4=Eger |first4=E |last5=Salek-Haddadi |first5=A |last6=Preibisch |first6=C |last7=Krakow |first7=K |journal=NeuroImage |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=1463‚Äì76 |pmid=12948703|citeseerx=10.1.1.586.3056 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though successful simultaneous recording requires that several technical difficulties be overcome, such as the presence of ballistocardiographic artifact, MRI pulse artifact and the induction of electrical currents in EEG wires that move within the strong magnetic fields of the MRI. While challenging, these have been successfully overcome in a number of studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/WNP.0b013e3181879d56 |title=Simultaneous EEG/Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging at 4 Tesla: Correlates of Brain Activity to Spontaneous Alpha Rhythm During Relaxation |year=2008 |last1=Difrancesco |first1=Mark W. |last2=Holland |first2=Scott K. |last3=Szaflarski |first3=Jerzy P. |journal=Journal of Clinical Neurophysiology |volume=25 |issue=5 |pages=255‚Äì64 |pmid=18791470 |pmc=2662486}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MRI's produce detailed images created by generating strong magnetic fields that may induce potentially harmful displacement force and torque. These fields produce potentially harmful radio frequency heating and create image artifacts rendering images useless. Due to these potential risks, only certain medical devices can be used in an MR environment.

Similarly, simultaneous recordings with MEG and EEG have also been conducted, which has several advantages over using either technique alone:
* EEG requires accurate information about certain aspects of the skull that can only be estimated, such as skull radius, and conductivities of various skull locations. MEG does not have this issue, and a simultaneous analysis allows this to be corrected for.
* MEG and EEG both detect activity below the surface of the cortex very poorly, and like EEG, the level of error increases with the depth below the surface of the cortex one attempts to examine. However, the errors are very different between the techniques, and combining them thus allows for correction of some of this noise.
* MEG has access to virtually no sources of brain activity below a few centimetres under the cortex. EEG, on the other hand, can receive signals from greater depth, albeit with a high degree of noise. Combining the two makes it easier to determine what in the EEG signal comes from the surface (since MEG is very accurate in examining signals from the surface of the brain), and what comes from deeper in the brain, thus allowing for analysis of deeper brain signals than either EEG or MEG on its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=11474922 |year=2001 |last1=Huizenga |first1=HM |last2=Van Zuijen |first2=TL |last3=Heslenfeld |first3=DJ |last4=Molenaar |first4=PC |title=Simultaneous MEG and EEG source analysis |volume=46 |issue=7 |pages=1737‚Äì51 |journal=Physics in Medicine and Biology |doi=10.1088/0031-9155/46/7/301|bibcode=2001PMB....46.1737H |citeseerx=10.1.1.4.8384 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, a combined EEG/MEG (EMEG) approach has been investigated for the purpose of source reconstruction in epilepsy diagnosis.&lt;ref name="pmid25761059"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Aydin √ú, Vorwerk J, D√ºmpelmann M, K√ºpper P, Kugel H, Heers M, Wellmer J, Kellinghaus C, Haueisen J, Rampp S, Stefan H, Wolters CH |title=Combined EEG/MEG can outperform single modality EEG or MEG source reconstruction in presurgical epilepsy diagnosis |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=e0118753 |year=2015 |pmid=25761059 |pmc=4356563 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0118753 |type=Review|bibcode=2015PLoSO..1018753A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

EEG has also been combined with [[positron emission tomography]]. This provides the advantage of allowing researchers to see what EEG signals are associated with different drug actions in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.01.047 |title=The thalamus as the generator and modulator of EEG alpha rhythm: A combined PET/EEG study with lorazepam challenge in humans |year=2004 |last1=Schreckenberger |first1=Mathias |last2=Lange-Asschenfeldt |first2=Christian |last3=Lochmann |first3=Matthias |last4=Mann |first4=Klaus |last5=Siessmeier |first5=Thomas |last6=Buchholz |first6=Hans-Georg |last7=Bartenstein |first7=Peter |last8=Gr√ºnder |first8=Gerhard |journal=NeuroImage |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=637‚Äì44 |pmid=15193592}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanisms==
The brain's electrical charge is maintained by billions of [[neuron]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Human Brain in Numbers | journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | pmc=2776484 | pmid=19915731 | doi=10.3389/neuro.09.031.2009 | volume=3 | year=2009 | author=Herculano-Houzel S | pages=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Neurons are electrically charged (or "polarized") by [[membrane transport proteins]] that pump [[ions]] across their membranes.  Neurons are constantly exchanging ions with the extracellular milieu, for example to maintain [[resting potential]] and to propagate [[action potential]]s.   Ions of similar charge repel each other, and when many ions are pushed out of many neurons at the same time, they can push their neighbours, who push their neighbours, and so on, in a wave.  This process is known as volume conduction.  When the wave of ions reaches the electrodes on the scalp, they can push or pull electrons on the metal in the electrodes.  Since metal conducts the push and pull of electrons easily, the difference in push or pull voltages between any two electrodes can be measured by a [[voltmeter]].  Recording these voltages over time gives us the EEG.&lt;ref&gt;Tatum, W. O., Husain, A. M., Benbadis, S. R. (2008) "Handbook of EEG Interpretation" Demos Medical Publishing.{{page needed|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[electric potential]] generated by an individual neuron is far too small to be picked up by EEG or MEG.&lt;ref name="Nunez PL, Srinivasan R 1981"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Nunez PL, Srinivasan R | title = Electric fields of the brain: The neurophysics of EEG |publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1981 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gu5qAAAAMAAJ}}{{page needed|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; EEG activity therefore always reflects the summation of the [[neural synchronization|synchronous activity]] of thousands or millions of neurons that have similar spatial orientation.  If the cells do not have similar spatial orientation, their ions do not line up and create waves to be detected.  [[Pyramidal neurons]] of the cortex are thought to produce the most EEG signal because they are well-aligned and fire together.  Because voltage field gradients fall off with the square of distance, activity from deep sources is more difficult to detect than currents near the skull.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Klein |first1= S. |last2= Thorne |first2= B.

Scalp EEG activity shows [[neural oscillations|oscillations]] at a variety of frequencies. Several of these oscillations have characteristic [[frequency range]]s, spatial distributions and are associated with different states of brain functioning (e.g., waking and the various [[Sleep#Stages|sleep stages]]). These oscillations represent [[neural synchronization|synchronized activity]] over a network of neurons. The neuronal networks underlying some of these oscillations are understood (e.g., the thalamocortical resonance underlying [[sleep spindles]]), while many others are not (e.g., the system that generates the posterior basic rhythm). Research that measures both EEG and neuron spiking finds the relationship between the two is complex, with a combination of EEG power in the [[Gamma wave|gamma]] band and phase in the [[delta wave|delta]] band relating most strongly to neuron spike activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2009.08.016 |title=Frequency-Band Coupling in Surface EEG Reflects Spiking Activity in Monkey Visual Cortex |year=2009 |last1=Whittingstall |first1=Kevin |last2=Logothetis |first2=Nikos K. |journal=Neuron |volume=64 |issue=2 |pages=281‚Äì9 |pmid=19874794}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method==
[[File:Electroencephalograph Neurovisor-BMM 40 (close view).jpg|thumb|Computer electroencephalograph ''Neurovisor-BMM 40'']]
In conventional scalp EEG, the recording is obtained by placing [[electrode]]s on the scalp with a conductive gel or paste, usually after preparing the scalp area by light [[abrasion (medical)|abrasion]] to reduce [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] due to dead skin cells. Many systems typically use electrodes, each of which is attached to an individual wire. Some systems use caps or nets into which electrodes are embedded; this is particularly common when high-density arrays of electrodes are needed.

Electrode locations and names are specified by the [[10-20 system (EEG)|International 10‚Äì20 system]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0013-4694(93)90061-Y |title=The spatial location of EEG electrodes: Locating the best-fitting sphere relative to cortical anatomy |year=1993 |last1=Towle |first1=Vernon L. |last2=Bola√±os |first2=Jos√© |last3=Suarez |first3=Diane |last4=Tan |first4=Kim |last5=Grzeszczuk |first5=Robert |last6=Levin |first6=David N. |last7=Cakmur |first7=Raif |last8=Frank |first8=Samuel A. |last9=Spire |first9=Jean-Paul |journal=Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology |volume=86 |pages=1‚Äì6 |pmid=7678386 |issue=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for most clinical and research applications (except when high-density arrays are used). This system ensures that the naming of electrodes is consistent across laboratories. In most clinical applications, 19 recording electrodes (plus ground and system reference) are used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00004691-199401000-00008 |title=Guideline Seven A Proposal for Standard Montages to Be Used in Clinical EEG |year=1994 |last1=&amp;Na; |journal=Journal of Clinical Neurophysiology |volume=11 |pages=30‚Äì6 |pmid=8195424 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A smaller number of electrodes are typically used when recording EEG from [[infant|neonates]]. Additional electrodes can be added to the standard set-up when a clinical or research application demands increased spatial resolution for a particular area of the brain. High-density arrays (typically via cap or net) can contain up to 256 electrodes more-or-less evenly spaced around the scalp.

Each electrode is connected to one input of a [[differential amplifier]] (one amplifier per pair of electrodes); a common system reference electrode is connected to the other input of each differential amplifier. These amplifiers amplify the voltage between the active electrode and the reference (typically 1,000‚Äì100,000 times, or 60‚Äì100 [[decibel|dB]] of voltage gain). In analog EEG, the signal is then filtered (next paragraph), and the EEG signal is output as the deflection of pens as paper passes underneath. Most EEG systems these days, however, are digital, and the amplified signal is digitized via an [[analog-to-digital converter]], after being passed through an [[anti-aliasing filter]].  Analog-to-digital sampling typically occurs at 256‚Äì512&amp;nbsp;Hz in clinical scalp EEG; sampling rates of up to 20&amp;nbsp;kHz are used in some research applications.

During the recording, a series of activation procedures may be used. These procedures may induce normal or abnormal EEG activity that might not otherwise be seen. These procedures include hyperventilation, photic stimulation (with a strobe light), eye closure, mental activity, sleep and sleep deprivation. During (inpatient) epilepsy monitoring, a patient's typical seizure medications may be withdrawn.

The digital EEG signal is stored electronically and can be filtered for display.  Typical settings for the [[high-pass filter]] and a [[low-pass filter]] are 0.5‚Äì1&amp;nbsp;[[hertz|Hz]] and 35‚Äì70&amp;nbsp;Hz respectively. The high-pass filter typically filters out slow artifact, such as [[Galvanic skin response|electrogalvanic]] signals and movement artifact, whereas the low-pass filter filters out high-frequency artifacts, such as [[electromyography|electromyographic]] signals. An additional [[band-stop filter|notch filter]] is typically used to remove artifact caused by electrical power lines (60&amp;nbsp;Hz in the United States and 50&amp;nbsp;Hz in many other countries).&lt;ref name = "Niedermeyer"/&gt;

The EEG signals can be captured with opensource hardware such as [[OpenBCI]] and the signal can be processed by freely available EEG software such as [[EEGLAB]] or the [[Neurophysiological Biomarker Toolbox]].

As part of an evaluation for epilepsy surgery, it may be necessary to insert electrodes near the surface of the brain, under the surface of the [[dura mater]]. This is accomplished via burr hole or [[craniotomy]]. This is referred to variously as [[electrocorticography|"electrocorticography (ECoG)"]], "intracranial EEG (I-EEG)" or "subdural EEG (SD-EEG)". Depth electrodes may also be placed into brain structures, such as the [[amygdala]] or [[hippocampus]], structures, which are common epileptic foci and may not be "seen" clearly by scalp EEG. The electrocorticographic signal is processed in the same manner as digital scalp EEG (above), with a couple of caveats. ECoG is typically recorded at higher sampling rates than scalp EEG because of the requirements of [[Nyquist‚ÄìShannon sampling theorem|Nyquist theorem]]‚Äîthe subdural signal is composed of a higher predominance of higher frequency components. Also, many of the artifacts that affect scalp EEG do not impact ECoG, and therefore display filtering is often not needed.

A typical adult human EEG signal is about 10 ¬µV to 100 ¬µV in amplitude when measured from the scalp&lt;ref name="aurlien_2004"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.clinph.2003.10.019 |title=EEG background activity described by a large computerized database |year=2004 |last1=Aurlien |first1=H |last2=Gjerde |first2=I.O |last3=Aarseth |first3=J.H |last4=Eld√∏en |first4=G |last5=Karlsen |first5=B |last6=Skeidsvoll |first6=H |last7=Gilhus |first7=N.E |journal=Clinical Neurophysiology |volume=115 |issue=3 |pages=665‚Äì73 |pmid=15036063}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is about 10‚Äì20 mV when measured from subdural electrodes.

Since an EEG voltage signal represents a difference between the voltages at two electrodes, the display of the EEG for the reading encephalographer may be set up in one of several ways. The representation of the EEG channels is referred to as a ''montage.''

; Sequential montage: Each channel (i.e., waveform) represents the difference between two adjacent electrodes. The entire montage consists of a series of these channels. For example, the channel "Fp1-F3" represents the difference in voltage between the Fp1 electrode and the F3 electrode. The next channel in the montage, "F3-C3", represents the voltage difference between F3 and C3, and so on through the entire array of electrodes.

; Referential montage: Each channel represents the difference between a certain electrode and a designated reference electrode. There is no standard position for this reference; it is, however, at a different position than the "recording" electrodes. 
  Midline positions are often used because they do not amplify the signal in one hemisphere vs. the other, such as Cz, Oz, Pz etc as online reference. The other popular offline references are:

  REST reference:which is an offline computational reference at infinity where the potential is zero. REST (reference electrode standardization technique) takes the equivalent sources inside the brain of any a set of scalp recordings as springboard to link the actual recordings with any an online or offline( average, linked ears etc)  non-zero reference to the new recordings with infinity zero as the standardized reference. A free software can be found at (Dong L, Li F, Liu Q, Wen X, Lai Y, Xu P
and Yao D (2017) MATLAB Toolboxes for Reference Electrode Standardization Technique (REST) of Scalp EEG. Front. Neurosci. 11:601. doi: 10.3389/fnins.2017.00601),and for more details and its performance, pls ref to the original paper (Yao, D. (2001). A method to standardize a reference of scalp EEG recordings to a point at infinity. Physiol. Meas. 22, 693‚Äì711. doi: 10.1088/0967-3334/22/4/305)

 "linked ears": which is a physical or mathematical average of electrodes attached to both earlobes or [[mastoid process|mastoids]].

  Average reference montage: The outputs of all of the amplifiers are summed and averaged, and this averaged signal is used as the common reference for each channel.

 Laplacian montage: Each channel represents the difference between an electrode and a weighted average of the surrounding electrodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00004691-199110000-00005 |title=The Spline-Laplacian in Clinical Neurophysiology |year=1991 |last1=Nunez |first1=Paul L. |last2=Pilgreen |first2=Kenneth L. |journal=Journal of Clinical Neurophysiology |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=397‚Äì413 |pmid=1761706}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When analog (paper) EEGs are used, the technologist switches between montages during the recording in order to highlight or better characterize certain features of the EEG. With digital EEG, all signals are typically digitized and stored in a particular (usually referential) montage; since any montage can be constructed mathematically from any other, the EEG can be viewed by the electroencephalographer in any display montage that is desired.

The EEG is read by a [[Clinical neurophysiology|clinical neurophysiologist]] or [[neurologist]] (depending on local custom and law regarding [[Specialty (medicine)|medical specialities]]), optimally one who has specific training in the interpretation of EEGs for clinical purposes. This is done by visual inspection of the waveforms, called graphoelements. The use of computer signal processing of the EEG‚Äîso-called [[quantitative electroencephalography]]‚Äîis somewhat controversial when used for clinical purposes (although there are many research uses).

=== Dry EEG electrodes ===
In the early 1990s Babak Taheri, at [[University of California, Davis]] demonstrated the first single and also multichannel dry active electrode arrays using micro-machining. The single channel dry EEG electrode construction and results were published in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taheri|first1=B|last2=Knight|first2=R|last3=Smith|first3=R|year=1994|title=A dry electrode for EEG recording‚òÜ|journal=Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology|volume=90|issue=5|pages=376‚Äì83|doi=10.1016/0013-4694(94)90053-1|pmid=7514984}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arrayed electrode was also demonstrated to perform well compared to [[silver]]/[[silver chloride]] electrodes. The device consisted of four sites of sensors with integrated electronics to reduce noise by [[impedance matching]]. The advantages of such electrodes are: (1) no electrolyte used, (2) no skin preparation, (3) significantly reduced sensor size, and (4) compatibility with EEG monitoring systems. The active electrode array is an integrated system made of an array of capacitive sensors with local integrated circuitry housed in a package with batteries to power the circuitry. This level of integration was required to achieve the functional performance obtained by the electrode. The electrode was tested on an electrical test bench and on human subjects in four modalities of EEG activity, namely: (1) spontaneous EEG, (2) sensory event-related potentials, (3) brain stem potentials, and (4) cognitive event-related potentials. The performance of the dry electrode compared favorably with that of the standard wet electrodes in terms of skin preparation, no gel requirements (dry), and higher signal-to-noise ratio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Alizadeh-Taheri, Babak|year=1994|title=Active Micromachined Scalp Electrode Array for Eeg Signal Recording|journal=PhD Thesis|page=82|bibcode=1994PhDT........82A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 researchers at [[Case Western Reserve University]], in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], led by Hunter Peckham, used 64-electrode EEG skullcap to return limited hand movements to [[quadriplegic]] Jim Jatich. As Jatich concentrated on simple but opposite concepts like up and down, his beta-rhythm EEG output was analysed using software to identify patterns in the noise. A basic pattern was identified and used to control a switch: Above average activity was set to on, below average off. As well as enabling Jatich to control a computer cursor the signals were also used to drive the nerve controllers embedded in his hands, restoring some movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Hockenberry |first=John |date=August 2001 |title=The Next Brainiacs |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.08/assist_pr.html |magazine=Wired Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, a functional dry electrode composed of a polydimethylsiloxane [[elastomer]] filled with conductive carbon [[Nanofiber|nanofibers]] was reported. This research was conducted at the [[United States Army Research Laboratory|U.S. Army Research Laboratory]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0189415| pmid=29408942| pmc=5800568|bibcode = 2018PLoSO..1389415S|title = Carbon nanofiber-filled conductive silicone elastomers as soft, dry bioelectronic interfaces| journal=PLOS ONE| volume=13| issue=2| pages=e0189415|last1 = Slipher|first1 = Geoffrey A.| last2=Hairston| first2=W.

This results in more reproducible and reliable experimental results. Since patients dislike having their hair filled with gel, and the lengthy setup requires trained staff on hand, utilizing EEG outside the laboratory setting can be difficult.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Fei|last2=Li|first2=Guangli|last3=Chen|first3=Jingjing|last4=Duan|first4=Yanwen|last5=Zhang|first5=Dan|date=2016-06-06|title=Novel semi-dry electrodes for brain‚Äìcomputer interface applications|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/304860955|journal=Journal of Neural Engineering|volume=13|issue=4|pages=046021 (15pp)|doi=10.1088/1741-2560/13/4/046021|pmid=27378253|bibcode=2016JNEng..13d6021W}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, it has been observed that wet electrode sensors‚Äô performance reduces after a span of hours.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Therefore, research has been directed to developing dry and semi-dry EEG bioelectronic interfaces. 

Dry electrode signals depend upon mechanical contact. Therefore, it can be difficult getting a usable signal because of impedance between the skin and the electrode.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some EEG systems attempt to circumvent this issue by applying a saline solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015-01-01|title=Multichannel EEG with novel Ti/TiN dry electrodes|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924424714004440|journal=Sensors and Actuators A: Physical|language=en|volume=221|pages=139‚Äì147|doi=10.1016/j.sna.2014.10.010|issn=0924-4247|last1=Fiedler|first1=P|last2=Griebel|first2=S|last3=Pedrosa|first3=P|last4=Fonseca|first4=C|last5=Vaz|first5=F|last6=Zentner|first6=L|last7=Zanow|first7=F|last8=Haueisen|first8=J}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have a semi dry nature and release small amounts of the gel upon contact with the scalp.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Another solution uses spring loaded pin setups.

ARL also developed a visualization tool, Customizable Lighting Interface for the Visualization of EEGs or CLIVE, which showed how well two brains are synchronized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.arl.army.mil/www/default.cfm?article=3214|title=Army neuroscientists foresee intelligent agents on the battlefield {{!}} U.S. Army Research Laboratory|website=www.arl.army.mil|language=en|access-date=2018-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limitations===
EEG has several limitations. Most important is its poor spatial resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kondylis, Efstathios D.|title=Detection Of High-Frequency Oscillations By Hybrid Depth Electrodes In Standard Clinical Intracranial EEG Recordings|journal=Frontiers in Neurology|date=2014|volume=5|pages=1‚Äì10|doi=10.3389/fneur.2014.00149|pmid=25147541|pmc=4123606}}&lt;/ref&gt; EEG is most sensitive to a particular set of post-synaptic potentials: those generated in superficial layers of the cortex, on the crests of [[gyrus|gyri]] directly abutting the skull and radial to the skull. Dendrites, which are deeper in the cortex, inside [[sulcus (neuroanatomy)|sulci]], in midline or deep structures (such as the [[cingulate gyrus]] or [[hippocampus]]), or producing currents that are tangential to the skull, have far less contribution to the EEG signal.

EEG recordings do not directly capture axonal [[action potentials]]. An action potential can be accurately represented as a current [[quadrupole]], meaning that the resulting field decreases more rapidly than the ones produced by the [[current dipole]] of post-synaptic potentials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=H√§m√§l√§inen|first1=Matti|last2=Hari|first2=Riitta|last3=Ilmoniemi|first3=Risto J.|last4=Knuutila|first4=Jukka|last5=Lounasmaa|first5=Olli V.|title=Magnetoencephalography‚Äîtheory, instrumentation, and applications to noninvasive studies of the working human brain|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|volume=65|issue=2|pages=413‚Äì497|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.65.413|bibcode=1993RvMP...65..413H|date=1993|url=https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/handle/123456789/18757}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, since EEGs represent averages of thousands of neurons, a large population of cells in synchronous activity is necessary to cause a significant deflection on the recordings. Action potentials are very fast and, as a consequence, the chances of field summation are slim. However, [[neural backpropagation]], as a typically longer dendritic current dipole, can be picked up by EEG electrodes and is a reliable indication of the occurrence of neural output.

Not only do EEGs capture dendritic currents almost exclusively as opposed to axonal currents, they also show a preference for activity on populations of parallel dendrites and transmitting current in the same direction at the same time. [[Pyramidal neurons]] of cortical layers II/III and V extend apical dendrites to layer I. Currents moving up or down these processes underlie most of the signals produced by electroencephalography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murakami|first1=S.|last2=Okada|first2=Y.|title=Contributions of principal neocortical neurons to magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography signals|journal=The Journal of Physiology|date=13 April 2006|volume=575|issue=3|pages=925‚Äì936|doi=10.1113/jphysiol.2006.105379|pmid=16613883|pmc=1995687}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, EEG provides information with a large bias to select neuron types, and generally should not be used to make claims about global brain activity. The [[meninges]], [[cerebrospinal fluid]] and skull "smear" the EEG signal, obscuring its intracranial source.

It is mathematically impossible to reconstruct a unique intracranial current source for a given EEG signal,&lt;ref name = "Niedermeyer"/&gt; as some currents produce potentials that cancel each other out. This is referred to as the [[inverse problem]].  However, much work has been done to produce remarkably good estimates of, at least, a localized [[electric dipole]] that represents the recorded currents.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

===EEG vs fMRI, fNIRS and PET===
EEG has several strong points as a tool for exploring brain activity. EEGs can detect changes over milliseconds, which is excellent considering an [[action potential]] takes approximately 0.5‚Äì130 milliseconds to propagate across a single neuron, depending on the type of neuron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1=J. |last1=Anderson |title= Cognitive Psychology and Its Implications |edition= 6th |publisher= Worth |location=New York, NY |page= 17 |isbn=978-0-7167-0110-1 | date=22 October 2004 |type=Hardcover}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other methods of looking at brain activity, such as [[Pet scan|PET]] and [[fMRI]] have time resolution between seconds and minutes. EEG measures the brain's electrical activity directly, while other methods record changes in blood flow (e.g., [[Single photon emission computed tomography|SPECT]], [[functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]]) or metabolic activity (e.g., [[Positron emission tomography|PET]], [[functional near-infrared spectroscopy|NIRS]]), which are indirect markers of brain electrical activity. EEG can be used simultaneously with [[functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] so that high-temporal-resolution data can be recorded at the same time as high-spatial-resolution data, however, since the data derived from each occurs over a different time course, the data sets do not necessarily represent exactly the same brain activity. There are technical difficulties associated with combining these two modalities, including the need to remove the ''MRI gradient artifact'' present during MRI acquisition and the ballistocardiographic artifact (resulting from the pulsatile motion of blood and tissue) from the EEG. Furthermore, currents can be induced in moving EEG electrode wires due to the magnetic field of the MRI.

EEG can be used simultaneously with [[functional near-infrared spectroscopy|NIRS]] without major technical difficulties. There is no influence of these modalities on each other and a combined measurement can give useful information about electrical activity as well as local hemodynamics.

===EEG vs MEG===

EEG reflects correlated synaptic activity caused by [[post-synaptic potentials]] of cortical [[neurons]]. The ionic currents involved in the generation of fast [[action potentials]] may not contribute greatly to the averaged [[local field potential|field potentials]] representing the EEG.&lt;ref name="Nunez PL, Srinivasan R 1981"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0013-4694(66)90136-2 |title=Relations between EEG phenomena and potentials of single cortical cells.

EEG can be recorded at the same time as [[Magnetoencephalography|MEG]] so that data from these complementary high-time-resolution techniques can be combined.

Studies on numerical modeling of EEG and MEG have also been done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Tanzer Oguz I. | title = Numerical Modeling in Electro- and Magnetoencephalography, Ph.D. Thesis | url= http://lib.tkk.fi/Diss/2006/isbn9512280914/ | publisher = Helsinki University of Technology | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-9512280919}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huge wave similar in all channels.
&lt;/gallery&gt;
The EEG is typically described in terms of (1) [[neural oscillation|rhythmic activity]] and (2) transients. The rhythmic activity is divided into bands by frequency. To some degree, these frequency bands are a matter of nomenclature (i.e., any rhythmic activity between 8‚Äì12&amp;nbsp;Hz can be described as "alpha"), but these designations arose because rhythmic activity within a certain frequency range was noted to have a certain distribution over the scalp or a certain biological significance. Frequency bands are usually extracted using spectral methods (for instance Welch) as implemented for instance in freely available EEG software such as [[EEGLAB]] or the [[Neurophysiological Biomarker Toolbox]].
Computational processing of the EEG is often named [[quantitative electroencephalography]] (qEEG).

Most of the cerebral signal observed in the scalp EEG falls in the range of 1‚Äì20&amp;nbsp;Hz (activity below or above this range is likely to be artifactual, under standard clinical recording techniques). Waveforms are subdivided into bandwidths known as alpha, beta, theta, and delta to signify the majority of the EEG used in clinical practice.&lt;ref name=EEG&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tatum, William O.|title=Ellen R.

The practice of using only whole numbers in the definitions comes from practical considerations in the days when only whole cycles could be counted on paper records. This leads to gaps in the definitions, as seen elsewhere on this page. The theoretical definitions have always been more carefully defined to include all frequencies. Unfortunately there is no agreement in standard reference works on what these ranges should be ‚Äì values for the upper end of alpha and lower end of beta include 12, 13, 14 and 15. If the threshold is taken as 14&amp;nbsp;Hz, then the slowest beta wave has about the same duration as the longest spike (70&amp;nbsp;ms), which makes this the most useful value.

===Wave patterns===
[[File:eeg delta.svg|thumb|[[Delta wave]]s|400px|right]]
* [[Delta wave|Delta]] is the frequency range up to 4&amp;nbsp;Hz. It tends to be the highest in amplitude and the slowest waves. It is seen normally in adults in [[NREM|slow-wave sleep]]. It is also seen normally in babies. It may occur focally with subcortical lesions and in general distribution with diffuse lesions, metabolic encephalopathy hydrocephalus or deep midline lesions. It is usually most prominent frontally in adults (e.g. FIRDA ‚Äì frontal intermittent rhythmic delta) and posteriorly in children (e.g. OIRDA ‚Äì occipital intermittent rhythmic delta).

[[File:eeg theta.svg|thumb|[[Theta waves]]|400px|right]]
* [[Theta wave|Theta]] is the frequency range from 4&amp;nbsp;Hz to 7&amp;nbsp;Hz. Theta is seen normally in young children. It may be seen in drowsiness or arousal in older children and adults; it can also be seen in [[meditation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.132.2.180 |title=Meditation states and traits: EEG, ERP, and neuroimaging studies |year=2006 |last1=Cahn |first1=B. Rael |last2=Polich |first2=John |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=132 |issue=2 |pages=180‚Äì211 |pmid=16536641}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excess theta for age represents abnormal activity. It can be seen as a focal disturbance in focal subcortical lesions; it can be seen in generalized distribution in diffuse disorder or metabolic encephalopathy or deep midline disorders or some instances of hydrocephalus. On the contrary this range has been associated with reports of relaxed, meditative, and creative states.

[[File:eeg alpha.svg|thumb|[[Alpha wave]]s|400px|right]]
* [[alpha waves|Alpha]] is the frequency range from 7 [[Hertz|Hz]] to 13&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 2654794 | pmid=19300566 | volume=3 | issue=3 | title=Mechanisms of modafinil: A review of current research | date=June 2007 | vauthors=Gerrard P, Malcolm R | journal=Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat | pages=349‚Äì64}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hans Berger]] named the first rhythmic EEG activity he saw as the "alpha wave". This was the "posterior basic rhythm" (also called the "posterior dominant rhythm" or the "posterior alpha rhythm"), seen in the posterior regions of the head on both sides, higher in amplitude on the dominant side. It emerges with closing of the eyes and with relaxation, and attenuates with eye opening or mental exertion. The posterior basic rhythm is actually slower than 8&amp;nbsp;Hz in young children (therefore technically in the theta range).
[[File:eeg SMR.svg|thumb|[[Sensorimotor rhythm]] aka [[mu rhythm]]|400px|right]]
:In addition to the posterior basic rhythm, there are other normal alpha rhythms such as the [[mu rhythm]] (alpha activity in the contralateral [[sensory cortex|sensory]] and [[motor cortex|motor]] cortical areas) that emerges when the hands and arms are idle; and the "third rhythm" (alpha activity in the temporal or frontal lobes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0167-8760(97)00754-X |title=Alpha rhythms as physiological and abnormal phenomena |year=1997 |last1=Niedermeyer |first1=E. |journal=International Journal of Psychophysiology |volume=26 |pages=31‚Äì49 |pmid=9202993 |issue=1‚Äì3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00004691-200107000-00005 |title=Multiplicity of the Œ± Rhythm in Normal Humans |year=2001 |last1=Feshchenko |first1=Vladimir A. |last2=Reinsel |first2=Ruth A. |last3=Veselis |first3=Robert A. |journal=Journal of Clinical Neurophysiology |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=331‚Äì44 |pmid=11673699}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alpha can be abnormal; for example, an EEG that has diffuse alpha occurring in coma and is not responsive to external stimuli is referred to as "alpha coma".

[[File:eeg beta.svg|thumb|[[Beta wave]]s|400px|right]]
* [[Beta wave|Beta]] is the frequency range from 14&amp;nbsp;Hz to about 30&amp;nbsp;Hz. It is seen usually on both sides in symmetrical distribution and is most evident frontally. Beta activity is closely linked to motor behavior and is generally attenuated during active movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1388-2457(99)00141-8 |title=Event-related EEG/MEG synchronization and desynchronization: Basic principles |year=1999 |last1=Pfurtscheller |first1=G. |last2=Lopes da Silva |first2=F. H. |journal=Clinical Neurophysiology |volume=110 |issue=11 |pages=1842‚Äì57 |pmid=10576479}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low-amplitude beta with multiple and varying frequencies is often associated with active, busy or anxious thinking and active concentration. Rhythmic beta with a dominant set of frequencies is associated with various pathologies, such as [[Dup15q|Dup15q syndrome]], and drug effects, especially [[benzodiazepines]]. It may be absent or reduced in areas of cortical damage. It is the dominant rhythm in patients who are alert or anxious or who have their eyes open.

[[File:eeg gamma.svg|thumb|[[Gamma wave]]s|400px|right]]
* [[Gamma wave|Gamma]] is the frequency range approximately 30‚Äì100&amp;nbsp;Hz. Gamma rhythms are thought to represent binding of different populations of neurons together into a network for the purpose of carrying out a certain cognitive or motor function.&lt;ref name="Niedermeyer"/&gt;
* [[Mu wave|Mu]] range is 8‚Äì13&amp;nbsp;Hz and partly overlaps with other frequencies. It reflects the synchronous firing of motor neurons in rest state. Mu suppression is thought to reflect motor mirror neuron systems, because when an action is observed, the pattern extinguishes, possibly because of the normal neuronal system and the mirror neuron system "go out of sync" and interfere with each other.&lt;ref name="Oberman LM 2005"/&gt;

"Ultra-slow" or "near-[[Direct current|DC]]" activity is recorded using DC amplifiers in some research contexts. It is not typically recorded in a clinical context because the signal at these frequencies is susceptible to a number of artifacts.

Some features of the EEG are transient rather than rhythmic. Spikes and sharp waves may represent seizure activity or [[interictal]] activity in individuals with epilepsy or a predisposition toward epilepsy. Other transient features are normal: vertex waves and sleep spindles are seen in normal sleep.

Note that there are types of activity that are statistically uncommon, but not associated with dysfunction or disease. These are often referred to as "normal variants". The mu rhythm is an example of a normal variant.

The normal electroencephalogram (EEG) varies by age. The [[Fetal EEG|prenatal EEG]] and neonatal EEG is quite different from the adult EEG. Fetuses in the third trimester and newborns display two common brain activity patterns: "discontinuous" and "trace alternant." "Discontinuous" electrical activity refers to sharp bursts of electrical activity followed by low frequency waves. "Trace alternant" electrical activity describes sharp bursts followed by short high amplitude intervals and usually indicates quiet sleep in newborns&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2013-11-01|title=Functional plasticity before the cradle: A review of neural functional imaging in the human fetus|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763413000730|journal=Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews|language=en|volume=37|issue=9|pages=2220‚Äì2232|doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2013.03.013|pmid=23542738|issn=0149-7634|last1=Anderson|first1=Amy L|last2=Thomason|first2=Moriah E}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The EEG in childhood generally has slower frequency oscillations than the adult EEG. 

The normal EEG also varies depending on state. The EEG is used along with other measurements ([[electrooculography|EOG]], [[electromyography|EMG]]) to define [[sleep|sleep stages]] in [[polysomnography]]. Stage I sleep (equivalent to drowsiness in some systems) appears on the EEG as drop-out of the posterior basic rhythm. There can be an increase in theta frequencies. Santamaria and Chiappa cataloged a number of the variety of patterns associated with drowsiness. Stage II sleep is characterized by sleep spindles ‚Äì transient runs of rhythmic activity in the 12‚Äì14&amp;nbsp;Hz range (sometimes referred to as the "sigma" band) that have a frontal-central maximum. Most of the activity in Stage II is in the 3‚Äì6&amp;nbsp;Hz range. Stage III and IV sleep are defined by the presence of delta frequencies and are often referred to collectively as "slow-wave sleep". Stages I‚ÄìIV comprise non-REM (or "NREM") sleep. The EEG in REM (rapid eye movement) sleep appears somewhat similar to the awake EEG.

EEG under general anesthesia depends on the type of anesthetic employed.  With halogenated anesthetics, such as [[halothane]] or intravenous agents, such as [[propofol]], a rapid (alpha or low beta), nonreactive EEG pattern is seen over most of the scalp, especially anteriorly; in some older terminology this was known as a WAR (widespread anterior rapid) pattern, contrasted with a WAIS (widespread slow) pattern associated with high doses of [[opiate]]s.  Anesthetic effects on EEG signals are beginning to be understood at the level of drug actions on different kinds of synapses and the circuits that allow synchronized neuronal activity (see: http://www.stanford.edu/group/maciverlab/).

==Artifacts==

===Biological artifacts===
[[File:Human EEG artefacts.png|alt= Main types of artifacts in human EEG|thumb|Main types of artifacts in human EEG]]
Electrical signals detected along the scalp by an EEG, but that originate from non-cerebral origin are called [[Artifact (observational)|artifacts]]. EEG data is almost always contaminated by such artifacts. The amplitude of artifacts can be quite large relative to the size of amplitude of the cortical signals of interest. This is one of the reasons why it takes considerable experience to correctly interpret EEGs clinically. Some of the most common types of biological artifacts include:
* Eye-induced artifacts (includes eye blinks, eye movements and extra-ocular muscle activity)
* [[Electrocardiogram|ECG]] (cardiac) artifacts
* [[Electromyography|EMG]] (muscle activation)-induced artifacts
* [[Glossokinetic]] artifacts

The most prominent eye-induced artifacts are caused by the potential difference between the [[cornea]] and [[retina]], which is quite large compared to cerebral potentials. When the eyes and eyelids are completely still, this corneo-retinal dipole does not affect EEG. However, blinks occur several times per minute, the eyes movements occur several times per second. Eyelid movements, occurring mostly during blinking or vertical eye movements, elicit a large potential seen mostly in the difference between the [[Electrooculography]] (EOG) channels above and below the eyes. An established explanation of this potential regards the eyelids as sliding electrodes that short-circuit the positively charged cornea to the extra-ocular skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=14332336 |year=1965 |last1=Barry |first1=W |last2=Jones |first2=GM |title=Influence of Eye Lid Movement Upon Electro-Oculographic Recording of Vertical Eye Movements |volume=36 |pages=855‚Äì8 |journal=Aerospace Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.clinph.2004.11.001 |title=Effects of eyelid closure, blinks, and eye movements on the electroencephalogram |year=2005 |last1=Iwasaki |first1=Masaki |last2=Kellinghaus |first2=Christoph |last3=Alexopoulos |first3=Andreas V. |last4=Burgess |first4=Richard C. |last5=Kumar |first5=Arun N. |last6=Han |first6=Yanning H. |last7=L√ºders |first7=Hans O. |last8=Leigh |first8=R.

Eyelid fluttering artifacts of a characteristic type were previously called Kappa rhythm (or Kappa waves). It is usually seen in the prefrontal leads, that is, just over the eyes. Sometimes they are seen with mental activity. They are usually in the Theta (4‚Äì7&amp;nbsp;Hz) or Alpha (7‚Äì14&amp;nbsp;Hz) range. They were named because they were believed to originate from the brain. Later study revealed they were generated by rapid fluttering of the eyelids, sometimes so minute that it was difficult to see. They are in fact noise in the EEG reading, and should not technically be called a rhythm or wave. Therefore, current usage in electroencephalography refers to the phenomenon as an eyelid fluttering artifact, rather than a Kappa rhythm (or wave).&lt;ref name="recom_clin_neurophys_1983"&gt;{{cite book | last = Epstein | first = Charles M. | title = Introduction to EEG and evoked potentials | publisher = J. B. Lippincott Co. | year = 1983 | isbn = 978-0-397-50598-2 }}{{page needed|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Some of these artifacts can be useful in various applications. The EOG signals, for instance, can be used to detect&lt;ref name="Keren, A.S. 2010"/&gt; and [[Eye tracking|track eye-movements]], which are very important in [[polysomnography]], and is also in conventional EEG for assessing possible changes in alertness, drowsiness or sleep.

[[Electrocardiogram|ECG]] artifacts are quite common and can be mistaken for spike activity. Because of this, modern EEG acquisition commonly includes a one-channel [[Electrocardiogram|ECG]] from the extremities. This also allows the EEG to identify [[cardiac arrhythmia]]s that are an important [[differential diagnosis]] to [[Fainting|syncope]] or other episodic/attack disorders.

Glossokinetic artifacts are caused by the potential difference between the base and the tip of the tongue. Minor tongue movements can contaminate the EEG, especially in [[Parkinson's disease|parkinsonian]] and [[tremor]] disorders.

===Environmental artifacts===
In addition to artifacts generated by the body, many artifacts originate from outside the body. Movement by the patient, or even just settling of the electrodes, may cause ''electrode pops'', spikes originating from a momentary change in the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] of a given electrode. Poor [[Ground (electricity)|grounding]] of the EEG electrodes can cause significant 50 or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz artifact, depending on the local power system's [[Utility frequency|frequency]]. A third source of possible interference can be the presence of an [[Intravenous therapy|IV drip]]; such devices can cause rhythmic, fast, low-voltage bursts, which may be confused for spikes.

Motion artifacts introduce signal noise that can mask the neural signal of interest.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Symeonidou ER, Nordin AD, Hairston WD, Ferris DP | title = Effects of Cable Sway, Electrode Surface Area, and Electrode Mass on Electroencephalography Signal Quality during Motion | journal = Sensors | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 1073 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29614020 | pmc = 5948545 | doi = 10.3390/s18041073 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, effective signal noise processing measures were of great interest in the scientific community.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Induction and separation of motion artifacts in EEG data using a mobile phantom head device|journal=Journal of Neural Engineering|volume=13|issue=3|pages=036014|last=|first=|doi = 10.1088/1741-2560/13/3/036014|pmid=27137818|year = 2016|last1 = Oliveira|first1 = Anderson S|last2=Schlink|first2=Bryan R|last3=Hairston|first3=W David|last4=K√∂nig|first4=Peter|last5=Ferris|first5=Daniel P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An EEG equipped phantom head can be placed on a motion platform and moved in a sinusoidal fashion. This contraption enabled researchers to study the effectiveness of motion artifact removal algorithms.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;¬†Using the same model of phantom head and motion platform, it was determined that cable sway was a major attributor to motion artifacts. However, increasing the surface area of the electrode had a small but significant effect on reducing the artifact.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This research was sponsored by the [[United States Army Research Laboratory|U.S. Army Research Laboratory]] as a part of the [[Cognition and Neuroergonomics (CaN) Collaborative Technology Alliance|Cognition and Neuroergonomics Collaborative Technical Alliance]].

===Artifact correction===
Recently, [[independent component analysis]] (ICA) techniques have been used to correct or remove EEG contaminants.&lt;ref name="Keren, A.S. 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0048577200980259 |title=Removing electroencephalographic artifacts by blind source separation |year=2000 |last1=Jung |first1=Tzyy-Ping |last2=Makeig |first2=Scott |last3=Humphries |first3=Colin |last4=Lee |first4=Te-Won |last5=McKeown |first5=Martin J. |last6=Iragui |first6=Vicente |last7=Sejnowski |first7=Terrence J. |journal=Psychophysiology |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=163‚Äì78 |pmid=10731767}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1388-2457(00)00386-2 |title=Removal of eye activity artifacts from visual event-related potentials in normal and clinical subjects |year=2000 |last1=Jung |first1=Tzyy-Ping |last2=Makeig |first2=Scott |last3=Westerfield |first3=Marissa |last4=Townsechesne |first4=Eric |last5=Sejnowski |first5=Terrence J. |journal=Clinical Neurophysiology |volume=111 |issue=10 |pages=1745‚Äì58 |pmid=11018488|citeseerx=10.1.1.164.9941 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1469-8986.2003.00141.x |title=Automatic removal of eye movement and blink artifacts from EEG data using blind component separation |year=2004 |last1=Joyce |first1=Carrie A. |last2=Gorodnitsky |first2=Irina F. |last3=Kutas |first3=Marta |journal=Psychophysiology |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=313‚Äì25 |pmid=15032997|citeseerx=10.1.1.423.5854 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Removal of EEG noise and artifact using blind source separation  |last1=Fitzgibbon |first1=Sean P |last2=Powers |first2=David M W |last3=Pope |first3=Kenneth J |last4=Clark |first4=C Richard |journal=Journal of Clinical Neurophysiology |volume=24  |issue=3 |pages=232‚Äì243 |year=2007|pmid=17545826 |doi=10.1097/WNP.0b013e3180556926  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.03.037 |title=Identifying robust and sensitive frequency bands for interrogating neural oscillations |year=2010 |last1=Shackman |first1=Alexander J. |last2=McMenamin |first2=Brenton W. |last3=Maxwell |first3=Jeffrey S. |last4=Greischar |first4=Lawrence L. |last5=Davidson |first5=Richard J. |journal=NeuroImage |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=1319‚Äì33 |pmid=20304076 |pmc=2871966}}&lt;/ref&gt; These techniques attempt to "unmix" the EEG signals into some number of underlying components. There are many source separation algorithms, often assuming various behaviors or natures of EEG. Regardless, the principle behind any particular method usually allow "remixing" only those components that would result in "clean" EEG by nullifying (zeroing) the weight of unwanted components. Fully automated artifact rejection methods, which use ICA, have also been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jneumeth.2010.07.015 |title=FASTER: Fully Automated Statistical Thresholding for EEG artifact Rejection |year=2010 |last1=Nolan |first1=H. |last2=Whelan |first2=R. |last3=Reilly |first3=R.B. |journal=Journal of Neuroscience Methods |volume=192 |pages=152‚Äì62 |pmid=20654646 |issue=1|hdl=2262/41103 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last few years, by comparing data from paralysed and unparalysed subjects, EEG contamination by muscle has been shown to be far more prevalent than had previously been realized, particularly in the gamma range above 20&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Scalp electrical recording during paralysis: Quantitative evidence that EEG frequencies above 20Hz are contaminated by EMG |last1=Whitham |first1=Emma M |last2=Pope |first2=Kenneth J |last3=Fitzgibbon |first3=Sean P |last4=Lewis |first4=Trent W |last5=Clark |first5=C Richard |last6=Loveless |first6=Stephen |last7=Broberg |first7=Marita |last8=Wallace |first8=Angus |last9=DeLosAngeles |first9=Dylan |last10=Lillie |first10=Peter |journal=Clinical Neurophysiology |volume=118 |issue=8 |pages=1877‚Äì1888 |year=2007 |pmid=17574912 |doi=10.1016/j.clinph.2007.04.027|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Surface [[Laplacian]] has been shown to be effective in eliminating muscle artefact, particularly for central electrodes, which are further from the strongest contaminants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Surface Laplacian of Central Scalp Electrical Signals is Insensitive to Muscle Contamination |last1=Fitzgibbon |first1=Sean P |last2=Lewis |first2=Trent W |last3=Powers |first3=David M W |last4=Whitham |first4=Emma M |last5=Willoughby |first5=John O |last6=Pope |first6=Kenneth J |journal=IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering |volume=60 |issue=1 |pages=4‚Äì9 |year=2013 |pmid=22542648 |doi=10.1109/TBME.2012.2195662}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of Surface Laplacian with automated techniques for removing muscle components using ICA proved particularly effective in a follow up study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Surface Laplacian of scalp electrical signals and independent component analysis resolve EMG contamination of electroencephalogram|

==Abnormal activity==
Abnormal activity can broadly be separated into [[epileptiform]] and non-epileptiform activity. It can also be separated into focal or diffuse.

Focal epileptiform discharges represent fast, synchronous potentials in a large number of neurons in a somewhat discrete area of the brain. These can occur as interictal activity, between seizures, and represent an area of cortical irritability that may be predisposed to producing epileptic seizures. Interictal discharges are not wholly reliable for determining whether a patient has epilepsy nor where his/her seizure might originate. (See [[focal epilepsy]].)

Generalized epileptiform discharges often have an anterior maximum, but these are seen synchronously throughout the entire brain. They are strongly suggestive of a generalized epilepsy.

Focal non-epileptiform abnormal activity may occur over areas of the brain where there is focal damage of the cortex or [[white matter]]. It often consists of an increase in slow frequency rhythms and/or a loss of normal higher frequency rhythms. It may also appear as focal or unilateral decrease in amplitude of the EEG signal.

Diffuse non-epileptiform abnormal activity may manifest as diffuse abnormally slow rhythms or bilateral slowing of normal rhythms, such as the PBR.

Intracortical Encephalogram electrodes and sub-dural electrodes can be used in tandem to discriminate and discretize artifact from epileptiform and other severe neurological events.

More advanced measures of abnormal EEG signals have also recently received attention as possible biomarkers  for different disorders such as [[Alzheimer's disease]].&lt;ref name="Montez2009"&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=2009PNAS..106.1614M |title=Altered temporal correlations in parietal alpha and prefrontal theta oscillations in early-stage Alzheimer disease |last1=Montez |first1=Teresa |last2=Poil |first2=S.-S. |first3=B.

The EEG has been used for many purposes besides the conventional uses of clinical diagnosis and conventional cognitive neuroscience. An early use was during World War II by the U.S. Army Air Corps to screen out pilots in danger of having seizures;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Keiper |first=Adam |title=The Age of Neuroelectronics |url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/the-age-of-neuroelectronics |publisher=The New Atlantis |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160212222927/http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/the-age-of-neuroelectronics |archivedate=2016-02-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; long-term EEG recordings in epilepsy patients are still used today for [[seizure prediction]]. [[Neurofeedback]] remains an important extension, and in its most advanced form is also attempted as the basis of [[Brain-computer interface|brain computer interfaces]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wan|first=Feng|last2=da Cruz|first2=Janir Nuno|last3=Nan|first3=Wenya|last4=Wong|first4=Chi Man|last5=Vai|first5=Mang I|last6=Rosa|first6=Agostinho|date=2016-05-06|title=Alpha neurofeedback training improves SSVEP-based BCI performance|journal=Journal of Neural Engineering|volume=13|issue=3|pages=036019|doi=10.1088/1741-2560/13/3/036019|pmid=27152666|issn=1741-2560}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The EEG is also used quite extensively in the field of [[neuromarketing]].

The EEG is altered by drugs that affect brain functions, the chemicals that are the basis for [[psychopharmacology]].  Berger's early experiments recorded the effects of drugs on EEG.  The science of [[pharmaco-electroencephalography]] has developed methods to identify substances that systematically alter brain functions for therapeutic and recreational use.

A lot of research is currently being carried out in order to make EEG devices smaller, more portable and easier to use.

In the [[Mathematics|mathematical]] areas of [[number theory]] and [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]], an infinite [[sequence]] &lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; is said to '''eventually''' have a certain [[Property (philosophy)|property]] if all terms beyond some (finite) point in the sequence have that property. This can be extended to the class of properties ''P'' that apply to elements of any [[Partially ordered set|ordered set]] (sequences and subsets of '''R''' are ordered, for example). 

==Motivation and definition==

Often, when looking at infinite sequences, it does not matter too much what behaviour the sequence exhibits early on. What matters is what the sequence does in the long term. The idea of having a property "eventually" rigorizes this viewpoint.

For example, the definition of a sequence of real numbers &lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; converging to some [[Limit of a sequence|limit]] ''&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;'' is: ''for all'' &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; ''there exists &lt;math&gt;N&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that, for all &lt;math&gt;n&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\left\vert a_n-a \right\vert&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;''.  The phrase ''eventually'' is used as shorthand for the fact that "''there exists &lt;math&gt;N&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that, for all &lt;math&gt;n&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;...''"  So the convergence definition can be restated as: ''for all &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, eventually &lt;math&gt;\left\vert a_n-a \right\vert&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;''.  In this setting it is also synonymous with the expression "''for all but a finite number of terms''" ‚Äì not to be confused with "for [[almost all]] terms" which generally allows for infinitely many exceptions.

A sequence can be thought of as a function with [[Domain of a function|domain]] the [[natural number]]s.  But the notion of "eventually" applies to functions on more general sets, specifically those that have an ordering and no [[greatest element]].  In general if &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is such a set and there is an element &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; such that the function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is defined for all elements greater than &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is said to have some property eventually if there is an element &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; has the property for all ''&lt;math&gt;x&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;''.  This notion is used, for example, in the study of [[Hardy field]]s, which are fields made up of real functions that all have certain properties eventually.

When a sequence or function has a property eventually, it can have useful implications when trying to prove something with relation to that sequence. For example, in studying the asymptotic behavior of certain functions, it can be useful to know if it eventually behaves differently than would or could be observed computationally, since otherwise this could not be noticed. It is also incorporated into many mathematical definitions, like in some types of [[Limit (mathematics)|limits]] (an arbitrary bound eventually applies) and [[Big O notation]] for describing asymptotic behavior.

==Notation==

The phrase '''eventually''' (or '''sufficiently large''') is used in such contexts as:
:&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is ''eventually'' true for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; / :&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true for ''sufficiently large'' &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; 
which is actually shorthand for:
:&lt;math&gt;\exists~ a\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true &lt;math&gt;\forall~ x\ge a&lt;/math&gt;
or, somewhat more formally:  
:&lt;math&gt;\exists~ a\in\mathbb{R}:\forall~ x\in\mathbb{R}:x\ge a \Rightarrow P(x)&lt;/math&gt;

This does not necessarily mean that any particular value for &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is known, but only that such an &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; exists. The phrase "sufficiently large" should not be confused with the phrases "[[arbitrarily large]]" or "[[infinity|infinitely]] large".

==Other uses in mathematics==

*A [[3-manifold]] is called sufficiently large if it contains a properly embedded 2-sided [[incompressible surface]]. This property is the main requirement for a 3-manifold to be called a [[Haken manifold]].

==Examples==

All primes above 2 are odd can be written as "Eventually, all primes are odd"

In the long run, all primes are congruent to ¬±1 mod 6

The square of a prime is congruent to 1 mod 24, given that the prime is above 3

This can be generalized as &lt;math&gt;p^n\equiv1\pmod x&lt;/math&gt; A conjecture can then be made for the closed form function &lt;math&gt;f(n)=x&lt;/math&gt; as well as the minimum &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2605">In [[statistics]], '''extensions of Fisher's method''' are a group of approaches that allow approximately valid [[statistical inference]]s to be made when the assumptions required for the direct application of [[Fisher's method]] are not valid. Fisher's method is a way of combining the information in the [[p-values]] from different [[statistical hypothesis testing|statistical tests]] so as to form a single overall test: this method requires that the individual test statistics (or, more immediately, their resulting p-values) should be [[statistical independence|statistically independent]].

==Dependent statistics==

A principle limitation of [[Fisher's method]] is its exclusive design to combine independent p-values, which renders it an unreliable technique to combine dependent p-values. To overcome this limitation, a number of methods were developed to extend its utility.

===Known covariance===
====Brown's method====

Fisher's method showed that the log-sum of ''k'' independent [[p-value]]s follow a [[chi-squared distribution|''œá''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-distribution]] with 2''k'' degrees of freedom: &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brown  | first1 = M. | title =  A method for combining non-independent, one-sided tests of significance | journal = Biometrics | volume = 31 | pages = 987‚Äì992 | year = 1975 |doi=10.2307/2529826 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kost  | first1 = J. | last2 = McDermott | first2 = M. | title =  Combining dependent P-values | journal = Statistics &amp; Probability Letters | volume = 60 | pages = 183‚Äì190 | year = 2002 |doi=10.1016/S0167-7152(02)00310-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;X = -2\sum_{i=1}^k \log_e(p_i) \sim \chi^2(2k) .&lt;/math&gt;

In the case that these p-values are not independent, Brown proposed the idea of approximating ''X'' using a scaled ''œá''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-distribution, ''cœá''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''k‚Äô''), with ''k‚Äô'' degrees of freedom. 

The mean and variance of this scaled ''œá''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; variable are:

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[c\chi^2(k')] = ck' ,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}[c\chi^2(k')] = 2c^2k' .&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;c=\operatorname{Var}(X)/(2\operatorname{E}[X])&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k'=2(\operatorname{E}[X])^2/\operatorname{Var}(X)&lt;/math&gt;. This approximation is shown to be accurate up to two moments.

===Unknown covariance===
====Kost's method: [[Student's_t-distribution|''t'' approximation]] ====

It should be noted that the method does require the test statistics' covariance structure to be known up to a scalar multiplicative constant. See reference 2.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4561">In [[graph theory]], the '''girth''' of a graph is the length of a shortest [[Cycle (graph theory)|cycle]] contained in the graph.&lt;ref&gt;R. Diestel, ''Graph Theory'', p.8.  3rd Edition, Springer-Verlag, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; If the graph does not contain any cycles (i.e. it's an acyclic graph), its girth is defined to be [[infinity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Girth.html|title=Girth ‚Äì Wolfram MathWorld}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, a 4-cycle (square) has girth 4. A grid has girth 4 as well, and a triangular mesh has girth 3. A graph with girth four or more is [[triangle-free graph|triangle-free]].

==Cages==
A [[cubic graph]] (all vertices have degree three) of girth {{math|''g''}} that is as small as possible is known as a {{math|''g''}}-[[cage (graph theory)|cage]] (or as a (3,{{math|''g''}})-cage).  The [[Petersen graph]] is the unique 5-cage (it is the smallest cubic graph of girth 5), the [[Heawood graph]] is the unique 6-cage, the [[McGee graph]] is the unique 7-cage and the [[Tutte eight cage]] is the unique 8-cage.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Andries E.|last=Brouwer|authorlink=Andries Brouwer|url=http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/drg/graphs/|title=Cages}}. Electronic supplement to the book ''Distance-Regular Graphs'' (Brouwer, Cohen, and Neumaier 1989, Springer-Verlag).&lt;/ref&gt; There may exist multiple cages for a given girth. For instance there are three nonisomorphic 10-cages, each with 70 vertices: the [[Balaban 10-cage]], the [[Harries graph]] and the [[Harries‚ÄìWong graph]].

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Petersen1 tiny.svg|The [[Petersen graph]] has a girth of 5

Image:Tutte eight cage.svg|The [[Tutte‚ÄìCoxeter graph]] (''Tutte eight cage'') has a girth of 8
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Girth and graph coloring==
For any positive integers {{math|''g''}} and {{math|œá}}, there exists a graph with girth at least {{math|''g''}} and [[chromatic number]] at least {{math|œá}}; for instance, the [[Gr√∂tzsch graph]] is triangle-free and has chromatic number 4, and repeating the [[Mycielskian]] construction used to form the Gr√∂tzsch graph produces triangle-free graphs of arbitrarily large chromatic number. [[Paul Erd≈ës]] was the first to prove the general result, using the [[probabilistic method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Erd≈ës | first = Paul | authorlink = Paul Erd≈ës | journal = Canadian Journal of Mathematics | pages = 34‚Äì38 | title = Graph theory and probability | volume = 11 | year = 1959 | doi = 10.4153/CJM-1959-003-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely, he showed that a [[random graph]] on {{math|''n''}} vertices, formed by choosing independently whether to include each edge with probability {{math|''n''&lt;sup&gt;(1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''g'')/''g''&lt;/sup&gt;,}} has, with probability tending to 1 as {{math|''n''}} goes to infinity, at most {{math|''n''/2}} cycles of length {{math|''g''}} or less, but has no [[Independent set (graph theory)|independent set]] of size {{math|''n''/2''k''.}} Therefore, removing one vertex from each short cycle leaves a smaller graph with girth greater than {{math|''g'',}} in which each color class of a coloring must be small and which therefore requires at least {{math|''k''}} colors in any coloring.

== Related concepts ==
The '''odd girth''' and '''even girth''' of a graph are the lengths of a shortest odd cycle and shortest even cycle respectively. 

The '''circumference''' of a graph is the length of the ''longest'' cycle, rather than the shortest.

Thought of as the least length of a non-trivial cycle, the girth admits natural generalisations as the 1-systole or higher systoles in [[systolic geometry]].

Girth is the dual concept to [[k-edge-connected graph|edge connectivity]], in the sense that the girth of a [[planar graph]] is the edge connectivity of its [[dual graph]], and vice versa. These concepts are unified in [[matroid theory]] by the [[matroid girth|girth of a matroid]], the size of the smallest dependent set in the matroid. For a [[graphic matroid]], the matroid girth equals the girth of the underlying graph, while for a co-graphic matroid it equals the edge connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

'''Sir James Hopwood Jeans''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|OM|FRS}}&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt; (11 September 1877{{spaced ndash}}16 September 1946&lt;ref name="Findmypast" /&gt;) was an English [[physicist]], [[astronomer]] and [[mathematician]].

==Early life==
Born in [[Ormskirk]], [[Lancashire]], the son of [[William Tulloch Jeans]], a parliamentary correspondent and author. Jeans was educated at [[Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood]], [[Wilson's School|Wilson's Grammar School]],{{sfn|Milne|2013|p=1}}{{sfn|Allport|Friskney|1987|p=234}} [[Camberwell]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref name="AutoKG-3"/&gt;
As a gifted student, Jeans was counselled to take an aggressive approach to the [[Cambridge Mathematical Tripos]] competition:{{sfn|Milne|2013|pp=4-5}}
{{quote|Early in the [[Michaelmas term]] of 1896, [[Gilbert Walker|Walker]] sent for Jeans and [[G. H. Hardy|Hardy]] and advised them to take Part I of the Mathematical Tripos in two years. He told them that he could not guarantee that they would come out higher than fifteenth in the list of [[wrangler (University of Cambridge)|wrangler]]s, but he understood that they would never regret it. They accepted his advice, and went to [[R. R. Webb]], the most famous private coach of the period...At the end of his first year, [Jeans] told Walker that he had quarrelled with Webb, his coach. Walker accordingly took Jeans himself, and the result was a triumph:...Jeans was bracketed second wrangler with [[J. F. Cameron]]...[and] R.W.H.T. Hudson was [[Senior Wrangler]] and [[G. H. Hardy]] fourth wrangler.}}

==Career==
Jeans was elected [[Fellow]] of Trinity College in October 1901,&lt;ref name="AutoKG-5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LDN1901" /&gt; and taught at Cambridge,  but went to [[Princeton University]] in 1904 as a professor of applied mathematics.  He returned to Cambridge in 1910.

He made important contributions in many areas of physics, including [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory]], the theory of [[radiation]] and [[stellar evolution]]. His analysis of rotating bodies led him to conclude that [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Laplace]]'s theory that the solar system formed from a single cloud of gas was incorrect, proposing instead that the planets condensed from material drawn out of the sun by a hypothetical catastrophic near-collision with a passing star. This theory is not accepted today.

Jeans, along with [[Arthur Eddington]], is a founder of British [[cosmology]]. In 1928, Jeans was the first to conjecture a [[steady state cosmology]] based on a hypothesized continuous creation of matter in the universe.{{sfn|Jeans|1928|p=360}} In his book ''Astronomy and Cosmology'' (1928) he stated: "The type of conjecture which presents itself, somewhat insistently, is that the centers of the nebulae are of the nature 'singular points' at which matter is poured into our universe from some other, and entirely extraneous spatial dimension, so that, to a denizen of our universe, they appear as points at which matter is being continually created."&lt;ref name="huffpost" /&gt; This theory fell out of favour when the 1965 discovery of the [[cosmic microwave background]] was widely interpreted as the tell-tale signature of the [[Big Bang]].

His scientific reputation is grounded in the monographs ''The Dynamical Theory of Gases'' (1904), ''Theoretical Mechanics'' (1906), and ''Mathematical Theory of Electricity and Magnetism'' (1908). After retiring in 1929, he wrote a number of books for the lay public, including ''The Stars in Their Courses'' (1931), ''[[The Universe Around Us]]'', ''Through Space and Time'' (1934), ''The New Background of Science'' (1933), and ''[[The Mysterious Universe]].''  These books made Jeans fairly well known as an expositor of the revolutionary scientific discoveries of his day, especially in [[theory of relativity|relativity]] and [[physical cosmology]].

In 1939, the [[Journal of the British Astronomical Association]] reported that Jeans was going to stand as a candidate for parliament for the [[Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge University constituency]]. The election, expected to take place in 1939 or 1940 did not take place until 1945, and without his involvement.

He also wrote the book "Physics and Philosophy" (1943) where he explores the different views on reality from two different perspectives: science and philosophy.  On his religious views, Jeans was an agnostic [[Freemason]].{{sfn|De Chardin|2004|p=212}}{{sfn|Bell|1986|p=xvii}}

==Personal life==
Jeans married twice, first to the American poet [[Charlotte Tiffany Mitchell]] in 1907,&lt;ref name="AutoKG-10"/&gt;, and then to the Austrian [[organ (music)|organ]]ist and [[harpsichord]]ist Suzanne Hock (better known as [[Susi Jeans]]) in 1935. 

At [[Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood|Merchant Taylors' School]] there is a James Jeans Academic Scholarship for the candidate in the entrance exams who displays outstanding results across the spectrum of subjects, notably in mathematics and the sciences.

==Major accomplishments==
One of Jeans' major discoveries, named [[Jeans length]], is a critical radius of an [[interstellar cloud]] in space. It depends on the temperature, and density of the cloud, and the mass of the particles composing the cloud. A cloud that is smaller than its Jeans length will not have sufficient gravity to overcome the repulsive gas pressure forces and condense to form a star, whereas a cloud that is larger than its Jeans length will collapse.

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_J=\sqrt{\frac{15k_{B}T}{4\pi Gm\rho}}&lt;/math&gt;

Jeans came up with another version of this equation, called Jeans mass or [[Jeans instability]], that solves for the critical mass a cloud must attain before being able to collapse.

Jeans also helped to discover the [[Rayleigh‚ÄìJeans law]], which relates the energy density of [[black-body radiation]] to the temperature of the emission source.

:&lt;math&gt; f(\lambda) = 8\pi c \frac{k_{B}T}{\lambda^4}&lt;/math&gt;

Jeans is also credited with calculating the rate of [[atmospheric escape]] from a planet due to kinetic energy of the gas molecules, a process known as '''Jeans Escape'''.

==Idealism==
{{main|Idealism}}
{{Quote|text=The stream of knowledge is heading towards a non-mechanical reality; the Universe begins to look more like a great thought than like a great machine. Mind no longer appears to be an accidental intruder into the realm of matter... we ought rather hail it as the creator and governor of the realm of matter. |author=James Jeans in ''[[The Mysterious Universe]]''|source={{sfn|Jeans|1944|p=137}} }}

In an interview published in ''[[The Observer]]'' (London), when asked the question "Do you believe that life on this planet is the result of some sort of accident, or do you believe that it is a part of some great scheme?", he replied:

{{quote|text=I incline to the idealistic theory that consciousness is fundamental, and that the material universe is derivative from consciousness, not consciousness from the material universe... In general the universe seems to me to be nearer to a great thought than to a great machine. It may well be, it seems to me, that each individual consciousness ought to be compared to a brain-cell in a universal mind.}}

{{quote|text=What remains is in any case very different from the full-blooded matter and the forbidding [[materialism]] of the Victorian scientist. His objective and material universe is proved to consist of little more than constructs of our own minds. To this extent, then, modern physics has moved in the direction of philosophic idealism. Mind and matter, if not proved to be of similar nature, are at least found to be ingredients of one single system. There is no longer room for the kind of [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]] which has haunted philosophy since the days of [[Descartes]]. |author=James Jeans, addressing the [[British Association]] in 1934, recorded in ''Physics and Philosophy''|source={{sfn|Jeans|1981|p=216}} }}

{{quote|text=Finite picture whose dimensions are a certain amount of space and a certain amount of time; the protons and electrons are the streaks of paint which define the picture against its space-time background. Traveling as far back in time as we can, brings us not to the creation of the picture, but to its edge; the creation of the picture lies as much outside the picture as the artist is outside his canvas. On this view, discussing the creation of the universe in terms of time and space is like trying to discover the artist and the action of painting, by going to the edge of the canvas. This brings us very near to those philosophical systems which regard the universe as a thought in the mind of its Creator, thereby reducing all discussion of material creation to futility.|author=James Jeans in ''[[The Universe Around Us]]''|source={{sfn|Jeans|1929|p=317}} }}

Essentially a jet group describes how a Taylor polynomial transforms under changes of [[coordinate system]]s (or, equivalently, [[diffeomorphism]]s).

==Overview==
The ''k''-th order '''jet group''' ''G''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; consists of [[jet (mathematics)|jet]]s of smooth diffeomorphisms œÜ: '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; ‚Üí '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; such that œÜ(0)=0.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1 = Kol√°≈ô|first1=Ivan|last2=Michor|first2=Peter|last3=Slov√°k|first3=Jan|url=http://www.emis.de/monographs/KSM/kmsbookh.pdf|format=PDF|title=Natural operations in differential geometry|year = 1993|pages=128‚Äì131|publisher = Springer-Verlag}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a more precise definition of the jet group.

Let ''k'' ‚â• 2. The gradient of a function ''f:'' '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; ‚Üí '''R''' can be interpreted as a section of the cotangent bundle of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''K''&lt;/sup&gt; given by ''df:'' '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; ‚Üí ''T*'''''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;. Similarly, derivatives of order up to ''m'' are sections of the jet bundle ''J&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;''('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;) = '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; √ó ''W'', where

:&lt;math&gt;W = \mathbf R \times (\mathbf R^*)^k \times S^2( (\mathbf R^*)^k) \times \cdots \times S^{m} ( (\mathbf R^*)^k).&lt;/math&gt;

Here '''R'''* is the [[dual vector space]] to '''R''', and ''S&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'' denotes the ''i''-th [[symmetric power]]. A smooth function ''f:'' '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; ‚Üí '''R''' has a prolongation ''j&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;f'': '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; ‚Üí ''J&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;''('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;) defined at each point ''p'' ‚àà '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; by placing the ''i''-th partials of ''f'' at ''p'' in the ''S&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;''(('''R'''*)&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;) component of ''W''.

Consider a point &lt;math&gt;p=(x,x')\in J^m(\mathbf R^n)&lt;/math&gt;. There is a unique polynomial ''f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' in ''k'' variables and of order ''m'' such that ''p'' is in the image of ''j&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''. That is, &lt;math&gt;j^k(f_p)(x)=x'&lt;/math&gt;. The differential data ''x‚Ä≤'' may be transferred to lie over another point ''y'' ‚àà '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; as  ''j&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;(y)'' , the partials of ''f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''  over ''y''.

Provide ''J&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;''('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) with a group structure by taking

:&lt;math&gt;(x,x') * (y, y') = (x+y, j^mf_p(y) + y')&lt;/math&gt;

With this group structure, ''J&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;''('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) is a [[Carnot group]] of class ''m'' + 1.

Because of the properties of jets under [[function composition]], ''G''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[Lie group]]. The jet group is a [[semidirect product]] of the general linear group and a connected, simply connected [[nilpotent Lie group]]. It is also in fact an [[algebraic group]], since the composition involves only polynomial operations.

[[File:Lord moulton.jpg|thumb|John Fletcher Moulton, Baron Moulton, c.&amp;nbsp; 1913]]
[[File:John Fletcher Moulton, Vanity Fair, 1900-10-04.jpg|thumb|"Patents". Caricature by [[Leslie Ward|Spy]] published in [[Vanity Fair (British magazine 1868-1914)|Vanity Fair]] in 1900.]]
'''John Fletcher Moulton, Baron Moulton''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|GBE|KCB|PC|FRS|FRAS}} (18 November 1844&amp;nbsp;‚Äì 9 March 1921) was an English mathematician, barrister and judge. He was a [[Cambridge Apostle]].

==Early life==
Moulton was born in [[Madeley, Shropshire|Madeley]], Shropshire, England, as one of six children of a scholarly minister of the [[Wesleyan Methodist Church (Great Britain)|Wesleyan Methodist Church]], James Egan Moulton. He was sent to [[Kingswood School]] at the age of 11 where he excelled at academic subjects. He achieved the top marks in the [[Oxford University|Oxford]] and [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] Local Examinations and achieved a scholarship to [[St John's College, Cambridge]], graduating [[Senior Wrangler]] in 1868 and winning the [[Smith's Prize]].&lt;ref name=Venn&gt;{{acad|id=MLTN864JF|name=Moulton, John Fletcher}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was at one point judged to be one of the twelve most intelligent men in the United Kingdom.

==Career==
After a brilliant mathematical career at Cambridge and election to a Fellowship, Moulton became a London barrister, specialising in patent law.  He also experimented on electricity and was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]]. A great advocate for medical research, he was the first chair of the [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|Medical Research Council]]. He was awarded the French [[Legion of Honour]] for his work in establishing international units for measuring electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moulton|first=H. Fletcher|title=The Life of Lord Moulton|date=1922|publisher=Nisbet|location=Londin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moulton became a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] Member of Parliament successively for [[Clapham (UK Parliament constituency)|Clapham]] 1885‚Äì86, [[Hackney South (UK Parliament constituency)|South Hackney]] 1894‚Äì95, and the [[Launceston (UK Parliament constituency)|Launceston]] division of [[Cornwall]], 1898‚Äì1906.&lt;ref name=Venn /&gt; He backed the attempts of [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]] to solve the problems in Ireland through [[Irish Home Rule]]. In 1906 Moulton was made [[Lord Justice]] on the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] and [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Councillor]]. In 1912 he entered the [[House of Lords]] with a [[life peerage]] and the title '''Baron Moulton''', of [[Bank, Hampshire|Bank]] in the County of Hampshire.

The [[First World War]] gave Lord Moulton his greatest challenge. In 1914 he became chairman of a committee to advise on the supply of explosives, a difficult problem because the British had only a feeble organic chemistry industry.  Before long Moulton became Director-General of the Explosives Department, first in the War Office and later in the Ministry of Munitions. He mobilised a brilliant group of administrators and scientists who expanded production more than 20-fold‚Äî throughout the war there was more explosives than shells to hold them.  They also made fertilizers, and in 1917 became responsible for producing poisonous gasses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van der Kloot|first=William|title=Lord Justice of Appeals John Fletcher Moulton and explosive production during World War I : 'the mathematical mind triumphant'.|journal=Notes Rec. R. Soc. Lond.|date=2014|volume=68|pages=171‚Äì186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though loyal to orders, Moulton believed that poison gas was a departure from civilised warfare.

During the entire four war years Lord Moulton worked a ten-hour day and took less than ten days holiday. On weekends he drove about the country to inspect munitions plants and to locate sites for new ones. He was awarded the [[Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath]] in 1915,&lt;ref name=Venn /&gt; the [[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire]] in 1917,&lt;ref name=Venn /&gt; the [[Order of the Black Star|Etoile Noir]] of France, the [[Order of Leopold (Belgium)]] and was the last person to receive the [[Order of the White Eagle (Poland)|Order of the White Eagle]] before the collapse of the Russian monarchy.

Moulton also corresponded with [[Charles Darwin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-12350.html Darwin Correspondence Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, despite pressure to lead the expansion of the British chemical industry, he returned to his love: the law.  He died in London on 9 March 1921.&lt;ref name="Obit"&gt;{{cite news|title=[[s:The Times/1921/Obituary/John Fletcher Moulton|Death of Lord Moulton]]|date=10 March 1921|work=The Times|publisher=The Times|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family ==
He married Clara Thomson n√©e Hertz (widow of [[Robert William Thomson]]) on 24 April 1875. She died in 1888.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4097">A '''linear space''' is a basic structure in [[incidence geometry]].  A linear space consists of a set of elements called '''points''', and a set of elements called '''lines'''.  Each line is a distinct [[subset]] of the points.  The points in a line are said to be '''incident''' with the line.  Any two lines may have no more than one point in common.  Intuitively, this rule can be visualized as two straight lines, which never intersect more than once. 

(Finite) linear spaces can be seen as a generalization of [[projective plane|projective]] and [[affine plane (incidence geometry)|affine planes]], and more broadly, of [[block design|&lt;math&gt;2-(v,k,1)&lt;/math&gt; block designs]], where the requirement that every block contains the same number of points is dropped and the essential structural characteristic is that 2 points are incident with exactly 1 line. 

The term ''linear space'' was coined by [[Libois]] in 1964, though many results about linear spaces are much older.

==Definition==
Let ''L'' = (''P'', ''G'', ''I'') be an [[incidence structure]], for which the elements of ''P'' are called points and the elements of ''G'' are called lines.  ''L'' is a ''linear space'' if the following three axioms hold:

*(L1) two points are incident with exactly one line.
*(L2) every line is incident to at least two points.
*(L3) ''L'' contains at least two lines.

Some authors drop (L3) when defining linear spaces. In such a situation the linear spaces complying to (L3) are considered as ''nontrivial'' and those who don't as ''trivial''.

==Examples==
The regular [[Euclidean plane]] with its points and lines constitutes a linear space, moreover all affine and projective spaces are linear spaces as well.

The table below shows all possible nontrivial linear spaces of five points.  Because any two points are always incident with one line, the lines being incident with only two points are not drawn, by convention.  The trivial case is simply a line through five points.

In the first illustration, the ten lines connecting the ten pairs of points are not drawn.  In the second illustration, seven lines connecting seven pairs of points are not drawn.

A linear space of ''n'' points containing a line being incident with ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 points is called a ''near pencil''. (See [[Pencil (mathematics)|pencil]])

==Properties==
The [[De Bruijn‚ÄìErd≈ës theorem (incidence geometry)]] shows that in any finite linear space &lt;math&gt;S=({\mathcal P},{\mathcal B}, \textbf{I})&lt;/math&gt; which is not a single point or a single line, we have &lt;math&gt;|\mathcal{P}| \leq |\mathcal{L}|&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2704">In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] theory of [[metric space]]s, a '''metric map''' is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] between metric spaces that does not increase any distance (such functions are always  [[continuous function|continuous]]).
These maps are the [[morphism]]s in the [[category of metric spaces]], '''Met''' (Isbell 1964).
They are also called [[Lipschitz continuity|Lipschitz functions]] with [[Lipschitz constant]] 1, '''nonexpansive maps''', '''nonexpanding maps''', '''weak contractions''', or '''short maps'''.

Specifically, suppose that ''X'' and ''Y'' are metric spaces and ∆í is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] from ''X'' to ''Y''. Thus we have a metric map when, [[for any]] points ''x'' and ''y'' in ''X'',
: &lt;math&gt; d_{Y}(f(x),f(y)) \leq d_{X}(x,y) . \! &lt;/math&gt;
Here ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt; denote the metrics on ''X'' and ''Y'' respectively.

==Category of metric maps==
A map ∆í between metric spaces is an [[isometry]] if it is a bijective metric map whose inverse is also a metric map. The [[composite function|composite]] of metric maps is also metric. Thus metric spaces and metric maps form a [[category theory|category]] '''[[Category of metric spaces|Met]]'''; '''Met''' is a [[subcategory]] of the category of metric spaces and Lipschitz functions, and the [[isomorphism]]s in '''Met''' are the isometries.

==Strictly metric maps==
One can say that ∆í is '''strictly metric''' if the [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] is strict for every two different points. Thus a [[contraction mapping]] is strictly metric, but not necessarily the other way around. Note that an isometry is ''never'' strictly metric, except in the [[degeneracy (mathematics)|degenerate]] case of the [[empty set|empty space]] or a single-point space.

== Multivalued version ==
A mapping &lt;math&gt;T:X\to \mathcal{N}(X)&lt;/math&gt; from a metric space ''X'' to the family of nonempty subsets of ''X'' is said to be Lipschitz if there exists &lt;math&gt;L\geq 0&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;H(Tx,Ty)\leq L d(x,y),&lt;/math&gt;
for all &lt;math&gt;x,y\in X&lt;/math&gt;, where ''H'' is the [[Hausdorff distance]]. When &lt;math&gt;L=1&lt;/math&gt;, ''T'' is called [[nonexpansive]] and when &lt;math&gt;L&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;, ''T'' is called a [[Contraction mapping|contraction]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13671">[[Image:Hyperbola one over x.svg|thumbnail|right|300px|Diagrammatic representation of limits approaching infinity|The reciprocal function: {{nowrap|1=''y'' = 1/''x''}}. For every ''x'' except 0, ''y'' represents its multiplicative inverse. The graph forms a [[rectangular hyperbola]].]]
In [[mathematics]], a '''multiplicative inverse''' or '''reciprocal''' for a number ''x'', denoted by 1/''x'' or ''x''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;, is a number which when [[Multiplication|multiplied]] by ''x'' yields the [[multiplicative identity]], 1. The multiplicative inverse of a [[rational number|fraction]] ''a''/''b'' is ''b''/''a''. For the multiplicative inverse of a real number, divide 1 by the number. For example, the reciprocal of 5 is one fifth (1/5 or 0.2), and the reciprocal of 0.25 is 1 divided by 0.25, or 4. The '''reciprocal function''', the function ''f''(''x'') that maps ''x'' to 1/''x'', is one of the simplest examples of a function which is its own inverse (an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]]).

The term ''reciprocal'' was in common use at least as far back as the third edition of ''[[Encyclop√¶dia Britannica]]'' (1797) to describe two numbers whose product is 1; geometrical quantities in inverse proportion are described as ''reciprocall'' in a 1570 translation of [[Euclid]]'s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]''.&lt;ref&gt;" In equall Parallelipipedons the bases are reciprokall to their altitudes". ''OED'' "Reciprocal" ¬ß3a. Sir [[Henry Billingsley]] translation of Elements XI, 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the phrase ''multiplicative inverse'', the qualifier ''multiplicative'' is often omitted and then tacitly understood (in contrast to the [[additive inverse]]). Multiplicative inverses can be defined over many mathematical domains as well as numbers. In these cases it can happen that {{nowrap|''ab'' ‚â† ''ba''}}; then "inverse" typically implies that an element is both a left and right [[inverse element|inverse]].

The notation ''f'' &lt;sup&gt;‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt; is sometimes also used for the [[inverse function]] of the function ''f'', which is not in general equal to the multiplicative inverse. For example, the multiplicative inverse {{nowrap|1=1/(sin ''x'') = (sin ''x'')&lt;sup&gt;‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the [[cosecant]] of x, and not the [[Inverse trigonometric functions|inverse sine of ''x'']] denoted by {{nowrap|sin&lt;sup&gt;‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt; ''x''}} or {{nowrap|arcsin ''x''}}. Only for linear maps are they strongly related (see below). The terminology difference ''reciprocal'' versus ''inverse'' is not sufficient to make this distinction, since many authors prefer the opposite naming convention, probably for historical reasons (for example in [[French language|French]], the inverse function is preferably called [[w:fr:Bijection r√©ciproque|bijection r√©ciproque]]).

==Examples and counterexamples==
In the real numbers, [[0 (number)|zero]] [[Division by zero|does not have a reciprocal]] because no real number multiplied by 0 produces 1 (the product of any number with zero is zero). With the exception of zero, reciprocals of every [[real number]] are real, reciprocals of every [[rational number]] are rational, and reciprocals of every [[complex number]] are complex. The property that every element other than zero has a multiplicative inverse is part of the definition of a [[Field (mathematics)|field]], of which these are all examples. On the other hand, no [[integer]] other than 1 and ‚àí1 has an integer reciprocal, and so the integers are not a field.

In [[modular arithmetic]], the [[modular multiplicative inverse]] of ''a'' is also defined: it is the number ''x'' such that ''ax''&amp;nbsp;‚â°&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;''n'').  This multiplicative inverse exists [[if and only if]] ''a'' and ''n'' are [[coprime]].  For example, the inverse of 3 modulo 11 is 4 because 4&amp;nbsp;¬∑&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;‚â°&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;11).  The [[extended Euclidean algorithm]] may be used to compute it.

The [[sedenion]]s are an algebra in which every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse, but which nonetheless has divisors of zero, i.e. nonzero elements ''x'', ''y'' such that ''xy''&amp;nbsp;= 0.

A [[square matrix]] has an inverse [[if and only if]] its [[determinant]] has an inverse in the coefficient [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]]. The linear map that has the matrix ''A''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; with respect to some base is then the reciprocal function of the map having ''A'' as matrix in the same base. Thus, the two distinct notions of the inverse of a function are strongly related in this case, while they must be carefully distinguished in the general case (as noted above).

The [[trigonometric functions]] are related by the reciprocal identity: the cotangent is the reciprocal of the tangent; the secant is the reciprocal of the cosine; the cosecant is the reciprocal of the sine.

A [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] in which every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse is a [[division ring]]; likewise an [[algebra (ring theory)|algebra]] in which this holds is a [[division algebra]].

== Complex numbers ==
As mentioned above, the reciprocal of every nonzero complex number {{math|1=''z'' = ''a'' + ''bi''}} is complex. It can be found by multiplying both top and bottom of 1/''z'' by its [[complex conjugate]] &lt;math&gt;\bar z = a - bi&lt;/math&gt; and using the property that &lt;math&gt;z\bar z = \|z\|^2&lt;/math&gt;, the [[absolute value]] of ''z'' squared, which is the real number {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{z} = \frac{\bar z}{z \bar z} = \frac{\bar z}{\|z\|^2} = \frac{a - bi}{a^2 + b^2} = \frac{a}{a^2 + b^2} - \frac{b}{a^2+b^2}i.&lt;/math&gt;

In particular, if ||''z''||=1 (''z'' has unit magnitude), then &lt;math&gt;1/z = \bar z&lt;/math&gt;. Consequently, the [[imaginary unit]]s, ¬±{{math|''i''}}, have [[additive inverse]] equal to multiplicative inverse, and are the only complex numbers with this property. For example, additive and multiplicative inverses of {{math|''i''}} are &amp;minus;({{math|''i''}}) = &amp;minus;{{math|''i''}} and 1/{{math|''i''}} = &amp;minus;{{math|''i''}}, respectively.

For a complex number in polar form {{math|1=''z'' = ''r''(cos‚ÄäœÜ + ''i''‚Äâsin‚ÄäœÜ)}}, the reciprocal simply takes the reciprocal of the magnitude and the negative of the angle:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{r}\left(\cos(-\varphi) + i \sin(-\varphi)\right).&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Reciprocal integral.svg|thumb|Geometric intuition for the integral of 1/''x''. The three integrals from 1 to 2, from 2 to 4, and from 4 to 8 are all equal. Each region is the previous region scaled vertically down by 50%, then horizontally by 200%. Extending this, the integral from 1 to 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; is ''k'' times the integral from 1 to 2, just as ln 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''k'' ln 2.]]

== Calculus ==
In real [[calculus]], the [[derivative]] of {{math|1= 1/''x'' = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt;}} is given by the [[power rule]] with the power ‚àí1:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx} x^{-1} = (-1)x^{(-1)-1} = -x^{-2} = -\frac{1}{x^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The power rule for integrals ([[Cavalieri's quadrature formula]]) cannot be used to compute the integral of 1/''x'', because doing so would result in division by 0:

:&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{1}{x}\,dx = \frac{x^0}{0}\ + C &lt;/math&gt;

Instead the integral is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_1^a \frac{1}{x}\,dx = \ln a,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{1}{x}\,dx = \ln x + C.&lt;/math&gt;

where ln is the [[natural logarithm]]. To show this, note that &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} e^x = e^x&lt;/math&gt;, so if &lt;math&gt;y = e^x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x = \ln y&lt;/math&gt;, we have:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anthony|first=Dr.|title=Proof that INT(1/x)dx = lnx|url=http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/53562.html|work=Ask Dr. Math|publisher=Drexel University|accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} = y\quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{dy}{y} = dx \quad\Rightarrow\quad \int \frac{1}{y}\,dy = \int 1\,dx \quad\Rightarrow\quad \int \frac{1}{y}\,dy = x + C = \ln y + C.&lt;/math&gt;

== Algorithms ==
The reciprocal may be computed by hand with the use of [[long division]].

Computing the reciprocal is important in many [[division algorithm]]s, since the quotient ''a''/''b'' can be computed by first computing 1/''b'' and then multiplying it by ''a''. Noting that &lt;math&gt;f(x) = 1/x - b&lt;/math&gt; has a [[Zero of a function|zero]] at ''x'' = 1/''b'', [[Newton's method]] can find that zero, starting with a guess &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; and iterating using the rule:

:&lt;math&gt;x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)} = x_n - \frac{1/x_n - b}{-1/x_n^2} = 2x_n - bx_n^2 = x_n(2 - bx_n).&lt;/math&gt;

This continues until the desired precision is reached. For example, suppose we wish to compute 1/17 ‚âà 0.0588 with 3 digits of precision. Taking ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.1, the following sequence is produced:
:''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.1(2 ‚àí 17 √ó 0.1) = 0.03
:''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.03(2 ‚àí 17 √ó 0.03) = 0.0447
:''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.0447(2 ‚àí 17 √ó 0.0447) ‚âà 0.0554
:''x''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.0554(2 ‚àí 17 √ó 0.0554) ‚âà 0.0586
:''x''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.0586(2 ‚àí 17 √ó 0.0586) ‚âà 0.0588
A typical initial guess can be found by rounding ''b'' to a nearby power of 2, then using [[bit shift]]s to compute its reciprocal.

In [[constructive mathematics]], for a real number ''x'' to have a reciprocal, it is not sufficient that ''x'' ‚â† 0. There must instead be given a ''rational'' number ''r'' such that 0&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''r''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;|''x''|. In terms of the approximation [[algorithm]] described above, this is needed to prove that the change in ''y'' will eventually become arbitrarily small.

[[File:X to x power showing minimum.svg|thumb|Graph of f(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; showing the minimum at (1/e, e&lt;sup&gt;‚àí1/e&lt;/sup&gt;).]]

This iteration can also be generalised to a wider sort of inverses, e.g. [[Invertible matrix#Newton's method|matrix inverses]].

==Reciprocals of irrational numbers==
Every number excluding zero has a reciprocal, and reciprocals of certain [[irrational number]]s can have important special properties. Examples include the reciprocal of [[e (mathematical constant)|e]] (‚âà&amp;nbsp;0.367879) and the [[Golden ratio#Golden ratio conjugate|golden ratio's reciprocal]] (‚âà&amp;nbsp;0.618034). The first reciprocal is special because no other positive number can produce a lower number when put to the power of itself; &lt;math&gt;f(1/e)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[global optimum|global minimum]] of &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x^x&lt;/math&gt;. The second number is the only positive number that is equal to its reciprocal plus one:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = 1/\varphi + 1&lt;/math&gt;. Its [[additive inverse]] is the only negative number that is equal to its reciprocal minus one:&lt;math&gt;-\varphi = -1/\varphi - 1&lt;/math&gt;.

The function &lt;math&gt;f(n)=n+\sqrt {(n^2+1)}, n \in \mathbb{N}, n&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; gives an infinite number of irrational numbers that differ with their reciprocal by an integer. For example, &lt;math&gt;f(2)&lt;/math&gt; is the irrational &lt;math&gt;2+\sqrt 5&lt;/math&gt;. Its reciprocal &lt;math&gt;1 / (2 + \sqrt 5)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;-2 + \sqrt 5&lt;/math&gt;, exactly &lt;math&gt;4&lt;/math&gt; less. Such irrational numbers share a curious property: they have the same [[fractional part]] as their reciprocal.

==Further remarks==
If the multiplication is associative, an element ''x'' with a multiplicative inverse cannot be a [[zero divisor]] (''x'' is a zero divisor if some nonzero ''y'', {{nowrap|1=''xy'' = 0}}). To see this, it is sufficient to multiply the equation {{nowrap|1=''xy'' = 0}} by the inverse of ''x'' (on the left), and then simplify using associativity. In the absence of associativity, the [[sedenion]]s provide a counterexample.

The converse does not hold: an element which is not a [[zero divisor]] is not guaranteed to have a multiplicative inverse.
Within '''Z''', all integers except ‚àí1, 0, 1 provide examples; they are not zero divisors nor do they have inverses in '''Z'''.
If the ring or algebra is [[finite set|finite]], however, then all elements ''a'' which are not zero divisors do have a (left and right) inverse. For, first observe that the map {{nowrap|1=''f''(''x'') = ''ax''}} must be [[injective]]: {{nowrap|1=''f''(''x'') = ''f''(''y'')}} implies {{nowrap|1=''x'' = ''y''}}:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 ax &amp;= ay &amp;\quad \rArr &amp; \quad  ax-ay = 0 \\
 &amp; &amp;\quad \rArr  &amp;\quad  a(x-y) = 0 \\
 &amp; &amp;\quad \rArr  &amp;\quad  x-y = 0 \\
 &amp; &amp;\quad \rArr  &amp;\quad  x = y.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Distinct elements map to distinct elements, so the image consists of the same finite number of elements, and the map is necessarily [[surjective]]. Specifically, ∆í (namely multiplication by ''a'') must map some element ''x'' to 1, {{nowrap|1=''ax'' = 1}}, so that ''x'' is an inverse for ''a''.

The expansion of the reciprocal 1/''q'' in any base can also act &lt;ref name="Mitchell"&gt;Mitchell, Douglas W., "A nonlinear random number generator with known, long cycle length," ''[[Cryptologia]]'' 17, January 1993, 55‚Äì62.&lt;/ref&gt; as a source of [[pseudo-random numbers]], if ''q'' is a "suitable" [[safe prime]], a prime of the form 2''p''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 where ''p'' is also a prime. A sequence of pseudo-random numbers of length ''q''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 will be produced by the expansion.

In [[quantum mechanics]],  '''quantum logic''' is a set of rules for [[reasoning]] about [[proposition]]s that takes the principles of quantum theory into account.  This research area and its name originated in a 1936 paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Birkhoff |first=Garrett |authorlink=Garrett Birkhoff |last2=von Neumann |first2=John |authorlink2=John von Neumann |title=The Logic of Quantum Mechanics |journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]], 2nd Ser. |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=823‚Äì843 |jstor=1968621 |url=http://www.fulviofrisone.com/attachments/article/451/the%20logic%20of%20quantum%20mechanics%201936.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Garrett Birkhoff]] and [[John von Neumann]], who were attempting to reconcile the apparent inconsistency of [[classical logic]] with the facts concerning the measurement of [[complementarity (physics)|complementary variable]]s in quantum mechanics, such as [[Position operator|position]] and [[Momentum operator|momentum]].

Quantum logic can be formulated either as a modified version of [[propositional logic]] or as a [[Noncommutative logic|noncommutative]] and non-associative [[Multi-valued logic|many-valued (MV) logic]].&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0101028v2  Maria Luisa Dalla Chiara and Roberto Giuntini. 2008.

Quantum logic has been proposed as the correct logic for propositional inference generally, most notably by the philosopher [[Hilary Putnam]], at least at one point in his career.  This thesis was an important ingredient in Putnam's 1968 paper "[[Is Logic Empirical?]]" in which he analysed the [[epistemology|epistemological]] status of the rules of propositional logic. Putnam attributes the idea that anomalies associated to quantum measurements originate with anomalies in the logic of physics itself to the physicist [[David Finkelstein]]. However, this idea had been around for some time and had been revived several years earlier by [[George Mackey]]'s work on [[group representation]]s and symmetry.

The more common view regarding quantum logic, however, is that it provides a [[Formalism (mathematics)|formalism]] for relating [[observable]]s, system preparation filters and states.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}  In this view, the quantum logic approach resembles more closely the [[C*-algebra]]ic approach to quantum mechanics.  The similarities of the quantum logic formalism to a system of [[deductive]] logic may then be regarded more as a curiosity than as a fact of fundamental philosophical importance. A more modern approach to the structure of quantum logic is to assume that it is a diagram ‚Äì in the sense of [[category theory]] ‚Äì of classical logics (see David Edwards).

==Differences with classical logic==
Quantum logic has some properties that clearly distinguish it from [[classical logic]], most notably, the failure of the [[distributive law]] of [[propositional logic]]:&lt;ref&gt;"Quantum logic" entry by Peter Forrest in the ''[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', Vol. 7 (1998), p. 882ff: "[Quantum logic] differs from the standard sentential calculus ... The most notable difference is that the distributive laws fail, being replaced by a weaker law known as orthomodularity."&lt;/ref&gt;	
: ''p'' and (''q'' or ''r'') = (''p'' and ''q'') or (''p'' and ''r''),
where the symbols ''p'', ''q'' and ''r'' are propositional variables. To illustrate why the distributive law fails, consider a particle moving on a line and (using some system of units where the [[reduced Planck's constant]] is 1) let
: ''p'' = "the particle has momentum in the interval [0, +1/6]"	
: ''q'' = "the particle is in the interval [‚àí1, 1]"
: ''r'' = "the particle is in the interval [1, 3]"
''Note'': The choice of ''p'', ''q'', and ''r'' in this example is intuitive but not formally valid (that is, ''p'' and (''q'' or ''r'') is also false here); see section "Quantum logic as the logic of observables" below for details and a valid example.

We might observe that:
: ''p'' and (''q'' or ''r'') = ''true''	
in other words, that the particle's momentum is between 0 and +1/6, and its position is between ‚àí1 and +3.
On the other hand, the propositions "''p'' and ''q''" and "''p'' and ''r''" are both false, since they assert tighter restrictions on simultaneous values of position and momentum than is allowed by the [[uncertainty principle]] (they each have uncertainty 1/3, which is less than the allowed minimum of 1/2). So,
: (''p'' and ''q'') or (''p'' and ''r'') = ''false''
Thus the distributive law fails.

== Introduction ==
In his classic 1932 treatise ''[[Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics]]'', [[John von Neumann]] noted that projections on a [[Hilbert space]] can be viewed as propositions about physical observables.  The set of principles for manipulating these quantum propositions was called ''quantum logic'' by von Neumann and Birkhoff in their 1936 paper. [[George Mackey]], in his 1963 book (also called ''Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics''), attempted to provide a set of axioms for this propositional system as an ''[[orthocomplemented lattice]]''.  Mackey viewed elements of this set as potential ''yes or no questions'' an observer might ask about the state of a physical system, questions that would be settled by some measurement. Moreover, Mackey defined a physical observable in terms of these basic questions. Mackey's axiom system is somewhat unsatisfactory though, since it assumes that the partially ordered set is actually given as the [[Orthocomplemented lattice|orthocomplemented]] [[closed set|closed]] [[Linear subspace|subspace]] [[Lattice (order)|lattice]] of a separable Hilbert space.  [[Constantin Piron|Piron]], Ludwig and others have attempted to give axiomatizations that do not require such explicit relations to the lattice of subspaces.

The axioms of an orthocomplemented lattice are most commonly stated as algebraic equations concerning the [[Partially ordered set|poset]] and its operations.{{citation needed|reason=Give a reference that uses less-or-equal as basic operation.|date=December 2017}} A set of axioms using instead disjunction (denoted as &lt;math&gt;\cup&lt;/math&gt;) and negation (denoted as &lt;math&gt;^\perp&lt;/math&gt;) is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Megill|first=Norman|title=Quantum Logic Explorer|url=http://us.metamath.org/qlegif/mmql.html|work=Metamath|accessdate=2013-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; a = a^{\perp \perp} &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; \cup &lt;/math&gt; is commutative and associative.
* There is a maximal element &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; 1 = b \cup b^\perp &lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt; a \cup (a^\perp \cup b)^\perp = a &lt;/math&gt;.
An ''orthomodular lattice'' satisfies the above axioms, and additionally the following one:
* The orthomodular law: If &lt;math&gt; 1 = (a^\perp \cup b^\perp)^\perp \cup (a \cup b)^\perp &lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; a = b &lt;/math&gt;.

The remainder of this article assumes the reader is familiar with the [[spectral theory]] of [[self-adjoint operator]]s on a Hilbert space. However, the main ideas can be understood using the finite-dimensional spectral theorem.

== Quantum logic as the logic of observables ==

One semantics of quantum logic is that quantum logic is the logic of boolean observables in quantum mechanics, where an observable ''p'' is associated with the set of quantum states for which ''p'' (when measured) is true with probability 1 (this completely characterizes the observable).  From there,
* ''¬¨p'' is the [[orthogonal complement]] of ''p'' (since for those states, the probability of observing ''p'', P(''p'') = 0),
* ''p''‚àß''q'' is the intersection of ''p'' and ''q'', and
* ''p''‚à®''q'' = ¬¨(¬¨''p''‚àß¬¨''q'') refers to states that are a superposition of ''p'' and ''q''.

Thus, expressions in quantum logic describe observables using a syntax that resembles classical logic.  However, unlike classical logic, the distributive law ''a'' ‚àß (''b'' ‚à® ''c'') = (''a'' ‚àß ''b'') ‚à® (''a'' ‚àß ''c'') fails when dealing with noncommuting observables, such as position and momentum.  This occurs because measurement affects the system, and measurement of whether a disjunction holds does not measure which of the disjuncts is true.

For an example, consider a simple one-dimensional particle with position denoted by ''x'' and momentum by ''p'', and define observables:
* ''a'' ‚Äî |''p''| ‚â§ 1 (in some units)
* ''b'' ‚Äî x &amp;lt; 0
* ''c'' ‚Äî x ‚â• 0

Now, position and momentum are Fourier transforms of each other, and the [[Fourier transform]] of a [[square-integrable]] nonzero function with a [[compact support]] is [[Entire function|entire]] and hence does not have non-isolated zeroes.  Therefore, there is no wave function that vanishes at ''x'' ‚â• 0 with P(|''p''|‚â§1) = 1.  Thus, ''a'' ‚àß ''b'' and similarly ''a'' ‚àß ''c'' are false, so (''a'' ‚àß ''b'') ‚à® (''a'' ‚àß ''c'') is false.  However, ''a'' ‚àß (''b'' ‚à® ''c'') equals ''a'' and might be true.

To understand more, let ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; be the momenta for the restriction of the particle wave function to ''x'' &amp;lt; 0 and ''x'' ‚â• 0 respectively (with the wave function zero outside of the restriction).  Let &lt;math&gt;|p|\!\restriction_{&gt;1}&lt;/math&gt; be the restriction of ''|p|'' to momenta that are (in absolute value) &gt;1.

(''a'' ‚àß ''b'') ‚à® (''a'' ‚àß ''c'') corresponds to states with &lt;math&gt;|p_1|\!\restriction_{&gt;1} = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|p_2|\!\restriction_{&gt;1} = 0&lt;/math&gt; (this holds even if we defined ''p'' differently so as to make such states possible).  As an ''operator'', &lt;math&gt;p=p_1+p_2&lt;/math&gt;, and nonzero &lt;math&gt;|p_1|\!\restriction_{&gt;1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|p_2|\!\restriction_{&gt;1}&lt;/math&gt; might interfere to produce zero &lt;math&gt;|p|\!\restriction_{&gt;1}&lt;/math&gt;.  Such interference is key to the richness of quantum logic and quantum mechanics.

== The propositional lattice of a classical system ==

The so-called ''[[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]]'' formulations of [[classical mechanics]] have three ingredients: ''[[Classical mechanics|states]]'', ''[[observable]]s'' and ''[[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]]''.  In the simplest case of a single particle moving in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, the state space is the position-momentum space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;. We will merely note here that an observable is some real-valued function ''f'' on the state space.  Examples of observables are position, momentum or energy of a particle.   For  classical systems, the value ''f''(''x''), that is the value of ''f'' for some particular system state ''x'', is obtained by a process of measurement of ''f''. The [[proposition]]s concerning a classical system are generated from basic statements of the form

:"Measurement of ''f'' yields a value in the interval [''a'', ''b''] for some real numbers ''a'', ''b''."

It follows easily from this characterization of propositions in classical systems that the corresponding logic is identical to that of some [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] of subsets of the state space.  By logic in this context we mean the rules that relate set operations and ordering relations, such as [[de Morgan's laws]]. These are analogous to the rules relating boolean conjunctives and material implication in classical propositional logic. For technical reasons, we will also assume that the algebra of subsets of the state space is that of all [[Borel algebra|Borel set]]s. The set of propositions is ordered by the natural ordering of sets and has a complementation operation. In terms of observables, the complement of the proposition {''f'' ‚â• ''a''} is {''f'' &lt; ''a''}.

We summarize these remarks as follows: The proposition system of a classical system is a lattice with a distinguished ''orthocomplementation'' operation:  The lattice operations of ''meet'' and ''join'' are respectively set intersection and set union.  The orthocomplementation  operation is set complement.  Moreover, this lattice is ''sequentially complete'', in the sense that any sequence {''E''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; of elements of the lattice has a least upper bound, specifically the set-theoretic union:

:: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{LUB}(\{E_i\}) = \bigcup_{i=1}^\infty E_i. &lt;/math&gt;

== The propositional lattice of a quantum mechanical system ==

In the [[Hilbert space]] formulation of quantum mechanics as presented by von Neumann, a physical observable is represented by some (possibly unbounded) densely defined [[self-adjoint operator]] ''A'' on a Hilbert space ''H''.  ''A'' has a spectral decomposition, which is a [[projection-valued measure]] E defined on the Borel subsets of '''R'''.  In particular, for any bounded Borel function ''f'' on '''R''', the following extension of ''f'' to operators can be made:

:&lt;math&gt; f(A) = \int_{\mathbb{R}} f(\lambda) \, d \operatorname{E}(\lambda).&lt;/math&gt;

In case ''f'' is the indicator function of an interval [''a'', ''b''], the operator  ''f''(''A'') is a self-adjoint projection, and can be interpreted as the quantum analogue of the classical proposition
* Measurement of ''A'' yields a value in the interval [''a'', ''b''].

This suggests the following  quantum mechanical replacement for the orthocomplemented lattice of propositions in classical mechanics.  This is essentially Mackey's ''Axiom VII'':

* The orthocomplemented lattice ''Q'' of propositions of a quantum mechanical system is the lattice of closed subspaces of a complex Hilbert space ''H'' where orthocomplementation of ''V'' is the orthogonal complement ''V''&lt;sup&gt;‚ä•&lt;/sup&gt;.

''Q'' is also sequentially complete: any pairwise disjoint sequence{''V''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; of elements of ''Q'' has a least upper bound.  Here disjointness of ''W''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''W''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; means ''W''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a subspace of ''W''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;‚ä•&lt;/sup&gt;. The least upper bound of {''V''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the closed internal direct sum.

Henceforth we identify elements of ''Q'' with self-adjoint projections on the Hilbert space ''H''.

The structure of ''Q'' immediately points to a difference with the partial order structure of a classical proposition system.  In the classical case, given a proposition ''p'', the equations
:&lt;math&gt; I = p \vee q&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; 0 = p\wedge q &lt;/math&gt;
have exactly one solution, namely the set-theoretic complement of ''p''.  In these equations ''I'' refers to the atomic proposition that is identically true and ''0'' the atomic proposition that is identically false.  In the case of the lattice of projections there are infinitely many solutions to the above equations (any closed, algebraic complement of ''p'' solves it; it need not be the orthocomplement).

Having made these preliminary remarks, we turn everything around and attempt to define observables within the projection lattice framework and using this definition establish the correspondence between self-adjoint operators and observables:  A ''Mackey observable'' is a [[Countably additive measure|countably additive homomorphism]] from the orthocomplemented lattice of the Borel subsets of '''R''' to  ''Q''.  To say the mapping œÜ is a countably additive homomorphism means that for any sequence {''S''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; of pairwise disjoint Borel subsets of '''R''', {œÜ(''S''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)}&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are pairwise orthogonal projections and

:&lt;math&gt; \varphi\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty S_i\right) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \varphi(S_i). &lt;/math&gt;

Effectively, then, a Mackey observable is a [[projection-valued measure]] on '''R'''.

'''Theorem'''.  There is a bijective correspondence between Mackey observables and densely defined self-adjoint operators on ''H''.

This is the content of the spectral theorem as stated in terms of [[spectral measure]]s.

== Statistical structure ==
{{Main|Gleason's theorem}}
Imagine a forensics lab that has some apparatus to measure the speed of a bullet fired from a gun. Under carefully controlled conditions of temperature, humidity, pressure and so on the same gun is fired repeatedly and speed measurements taken. This produces some distribution of speeds. Though we will not get exactly the same value for each individual measurement, for each cluster of measurements, we would expect the experiment to lead to the same distribution of speeds. In particular, we can expect to assign [[probability]] distributions to propositions such as {''a'' ‚â§ speed ‚â§ ''b''}.  This leads naturally to propose that under controlled conditions of preparation, the measurement of a classical system can be described by a probability measure on the state space.  This same statistical structure is also present in quantum mechanics.

A ''quantum probability measure'' is a function P defined on ''Q'' with values in [0,1] such that  P(0)=0, P(I)=1 and if {''E''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is a sequence of pairwise orthogonal elements of ''Q'' then
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{P}\!\left(\sum_{i=1}^\infty E_i\right) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \operatorname{P}(E_i). &lt;/math&gt;

The following highly non-trivial theorem is due to [[Andrew Gleason]]:

'''Theorem'''. Suppose ''Q'' is a separable Hilbert space of complex dimension at least 3. Then for any quantum probability measure ''P'' on ''Q'' there exists a unique [[trace class]] operator ''S'' such that
:&lt;math&gt;  \operatorname{P}(E) = \operatorname{Tr}(S E) &lt;/math&gt;
for any self-adjoint projection ''E'' in ''Q''.

The operator ''S'' is necessarily non-negative (that is all eigenvalues are non-negative) and of trace 1.  Such an operator is often called a ''density operator''.

Physicists commonly regard a density operator as being represented by a (possibly infinite) [[density matrix]] relative to some orthonormal basis.

For more information on statistics of quantum systems, see [[quantum statistical mechanics]].

== Automorphisms ==
An ''[[automorphism]]'' of ''Q'' is a bijective mapping Œ±:''Q'' ‚Üí ''Q'' that preserves the orthocomplemented structure of ''Q'', that is

:&lt;math&gt; \alpha\!\left(\sum_{i=1}^\infty E_i\right) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \alpha(E_i) &lt;/math&gt;

for any sequence {''E''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; of pairwise orthogonal self-adjoint projections. Note that this property implies monotonicity of Œ±.  If P is a quantum probability measure on ''Q'', then ''E'' ‚Üí  Œ±(''E'') is also a quantum probability measure on ''Q''.  By the [[Gleason theorem]] characterizing quantum probability measures quoted above, any automorphism Œ± induces a mapping Œ±* on the density operators by the following formula:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Tr}(\alpha^*(S) E) = \operatorname{Tr}(S \alpha(E)).&lt;/math&gt;

The mapping Œ±* is bijective and preserves convex combinations of density operators. This means
:&lt;math&gt; \alpha^*(r_1 S_1 + r_2 S_2) = r_1\alpha^*(S_1) + r_2 \alpha^*(S_2) \quad &lt;/math&gt;
whenever 1 = ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are non-negative real numbers.  Now we use a theorem of [[Richard V. Kadison]]:

'''Theorem'''. Suppose Œ≤ is a bijective map from density operators to density operators that is convexity preserving.  Then there is an operator ''U'' on the Hilbert space that is either linear or conjugate-linear, preserves the inner product and is such that

:&lt;math&gt; \beta(S) = U S U^* &lt;/math&gt;

for every density operator ''S''.  In the first case we say ''U'' is unitary, in the second case ''U'' is anti-unitary.{{clarify|reason=Is "unitary" being defined this way, or can it be proven that U is unitary in the conventional sense?|date=April 2015}}

&lt;blockquote style="background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;"&gt;
'''Remark'''.  This note is included for technical accuracy only, and should not concern most readers. The result quoted above is not directly stated in Kadison's paper, but can be reduced to it by noting first that Œ≤ extends to a positive trace preserving map on the trace class operators, then applying duality and finally applying a result of Kadison's paper.
 &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The operator ''U'' is not quite unique; if ''r'' is a complex scalar of modulus 1, then r ''U'' will be unitary or anti-unitary if ''U'' is and will implement the same automorphism.  In fact, this is the only ambiguity possible.

It follows that automorphisms of ''Q'' are in bijective correspondence to unitary or anti-unitary operators modulo multiplication by scalars of modulus 1.  Moreover, we can regard automorphisms in two equivalent ways: as operating on states (represented as density operators) or as operating on ''Q''.

== Non-relativistic dynamics ==

In non-relativistic physical systems,  there is no ambiguity in referring to time evolution since there is a global time parameter. Moreover, an isolated quantum system evolves in a [[deterministic]]  way: if the system is in a state ''S'' at time ''t'' then at time ''s''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''t'', the system is in  a state F&lt;sub&gt;''s'',''t''&lt;/sub&gt;(''S''). Moreover, we assume

* The dependence is reversible: The operators F&lt;sub&gt;''s'',''t''&lt;/sub&gt; are bijective.
* The dependence is homogeneous: F&lt;sub&gt;''s'',''t''&lt;/sub&gt; = F&lt;sub&gt;''s''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''t'',0&lt;/sub&gt;.
* The dependence is convexity preserving: That is, each F&lt;sub&gt;''s'',''t''&lt;/sub&gt;(''S'') is convexity preserving.
* The dependence is weakly continuous: The mapping '''R'''‚Üí '''R''' given by ''t'' ‚Üí Tr(F&lt;sub&gt;''s'',''t''&lt;/sub&gt;(''S'') ''E'') is continuous for every ''E'' in ''Q''.

By Kadison's theorem, there is a 1-parameter family of unitary or anti-unitary operators {''U''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{F}_{s,t}(S) = U_{s-t} S U_{s-t}^* &lt;/math&gt;

In fact,

'''Theorem'''.  Under the above assumptions, there is a strongly continuous 1-parameter group of unitary operators {''U''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; such that the above equation holds.

Note that it follows easily from uniqueness from Kadison's theorem that

:&lt;math&gt; U_{t+s} = \sigma(t,s)  U_t U_s &lt;/math&gt;

where œÉ(t,s) has modulus 1. Now the square of an anti-unitary is a unitary, so that all the ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; are unitary. The remainder of the argument shows that  œÉ(t,s) can  be chosen to be 1 (by modifying each ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; by a scalar of modulus 1.)

== Pure states ==
A convex combination of statistical states ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a state of the form ''S'' = ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; +''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; where ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are non-negative and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; =1. Considering the statistical state of system as specified by lab conditions used for its preparation, the convex combination ''S'' can be regarded as the state formed in the following way: toss a biased coin with outcome probabilities ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and depending on outcome choose system prepared to  ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; or ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Density operators form a convex set.  The convex set of density operators has [[extreme point]]s; these are the density operators given by a projection onto a one-dimensional space. To see that any extreme point is such a projection, note that by the spectral theorem ''S'' can be represented by a diagonal matrix; since ''S'' is non-negative all the entries are non-negative and since ''S'' has trace 1, the diagonal entries must add up to 1.  Now if it happens that the diagonal matrix has more than one non-zero entry it is clear that we can express it as a convex combination of other density operators.

The  extreme points of the set of density operators are called [[pure state]]s. If ''S'' is the projection on the 1-dimensional space generated by a vector œà of norm 1 then
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Tr}(S E) = \langle E \psi | \psi \rangle &lt;/math&gt;
for any ''E'' in ''Q''. In physics jargon, if
:&lt;math&gt;S = | \psi \rangle  \langle \psi  | , &lt;/math&gt;
where œà has norm 1, then
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Tr}(S E) = \langle \psi | E | \psi  \rangle .&lt;/math&gt;

Thus pure states can be identified with ''rays'' in the Hilbert space ''H''.

== The measurement process ==
Consider a quantum mechanical system with lattice ''Q'' that is in some statistical state given by a density operator ''S''. This essentially means an ensemble of systems specified by a repeatable lab preparation process.  The result of a cluster of measurements intended to determine the [[truth value]] of proposition ''E'', is just as in the classical case, a probability distribution of truth values '''T''' and '''F'''. Say the probabilities are ''p'' for '''T''' and ''q'' = 1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''p'' for&amp;nbsp;'''F'''.   By the previous section ''p'' = Tr(''S''&amp;nbsp;''E'') and ''q'' =&amp;nbsp;Tr(''S''&amp;nbsp;(''I''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''E'')).

Perhaps the most fundamental difference between classical and quantum systems is the following: regardless of what process is used to determine ''E'' immediately after the measurement the system will be in one of two statistical states:
* If the result of the measurement is '''T'''
::&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{\operatorname{Tr}(E S)} E S E. &lt;/math&gt;
* If the result of the measurement is '''F'''
::&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{\operatorname{Tr}((I-E) S)}(I- E) S (I- E). &lt;/math&gt;
(We leave to the reader the handling of the degenerate cases in which the denominators may be 0.)  We now form the convex combination of these two ensembles using the relative frequencies ''p'' and ''q''.  We thus obtain the result that the measurement process applied to a statistical ensemble in state ''S'' yields another ensemble in statistical state:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{M}_E(S) = E S E + (I - E) S (I - E). &lt;/math&gt;

We see that a pure ensemble becomes a mixed ensemble after measurement. Measurement, as described above, is a special case of [[quantum operation]]s.

== Limitations ==
Quantum logic derived from propositional logic provides a satisfactory foundation for a theory of reversible quantum processes. Examples of such processes are the covariance transformations relating two frames of reference, such as change of time parameter or the transformations of special relativity. Quantum logic also provides a satisfactory understanding of density matrices.  Quantum logic can be stretched to account for some kinds of measurement processes corresponding to answering yes-no questions about the state of a quantum system. However, for more general kinds of measurement operations (that is quantum operations), a more complete theory of filtering processes is necessary.  Such a theory of [[Belavkin equation|quantum filtering]] was developed in the late 1970s and 1980s by [[Viacheslav Belavkin|Belavkin]] &lt;ref name=Belavkin78&gt;{{cite journal

In any case, these quantum logic formalisms must be generalized in order to deal with super-geometry (which is needed to handle Fermi-fields) and non-commutative geometry (which is needed in string theory and quantum gravity theory). Both of these theories use a partial algebra with an "integral" or "trace". The elements of the partial algebra are not observables; instead the "trace" yields "greens functions", which generate scattering amplitudes. One thus obtains a local S-matrix theory (see D. Edwards).

In 2004, [[Prakash Panangaden]] described how to capture the kinematics of quantum causal evolution using System BV, a [[deep inference]] logic originally developed for use in [[structural proof theory]].&lt;ref&gt;http://cs.bath.ac.uk/ag/p/BVQuantCausEvol.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alessio Guglielmi]], [[Lutz Stra√üburger]], and [[Richard Blute]] have also done work in this area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://alessio.guglielmi.name/res/cos/crt.html#CQE DI &amp; CoS - Current Research Topics and Open Problems]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rado graph.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|The Rado graph, as numbered by {{harvtxt|Ackermann|1937}} and {{harvtxt|Rado|1964}}.]]
In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[graph theory]], the '''Rado graph''', '''Erd≈ës‚ÄìR√©nyi graph''', or '''random graph''' is a [[Countable set|countably infinite]] graph that can be constructed (with [[probability one]]) by choosing independently at random for each pair of its vertices whether to connect the vertices by an edge. The same graph can also be constructed non-randomly, by symmetrizing the membership relation of the [[hereditarily finite set]]s,  by applying the [[BIT predicate]] to the [[binary representation]]s of the [[natural number]]s, or as an infinite [[Paley graph]] that has edges connecting pairs of [[prime number]]s congruent to 1 mod 4 that are [[quadratic residue]]s modulo each other.

Every finite or countably infinite graph is an [[induced subgraph]] of the Rado graph, and can be found as an induced subgraph by a [[greedy algorithm]] that builds up the subgraph one vertex at a time. The Rado graph is uniquely defined, among countable graphs, by an ''extension property'' that guarantees the correctness of this algorithm: no matter which vertices have already been chosen to form part of the induced subgraph, and no matter what pattern of adjacencies is needed to extend the subgraph by one more vertex, there will always exist another vertex with that pattern of adjacencies that the greedy algorithm can choose.

The Rado graph is highly symmetric: any isomorphism of its induced subgraphs can be extended to a symmetry of the whole graph.
The [[first-order logic]] sentences that are true of the Rado graph are also true of [[almost all]] random finite graphs, and the sentences that are false for the Rado graph are also false for almost all finite graphs. In [[model theory]], the Rado graph forms an example of a [[saturated model]] of an [[Omega-categorical theory|œâ-categorical]] and [[complete theory]].

The names of this graph honor [[Richard Rado]], [[Paul Erd≈ës]], and [[Alfr√©d R√©nyi]], mathematicians who studied it in the early 1960s. It appears even earlier in the work of {{harvs|first=Wilhelm|last=Ackermann|authorlink=Wilhelm Ackermann|year=1937|txt}}.

==History==
The Rado graph was first constructed by {{harvtxt|Ackermann|1937}} in two ways, with vertices either the [[hereditarily finite set]]s or the natural numbers. (Strictly speaking Ackermann described a directed graph, and the Rado graph is the corresponding undirected graph given by forgetting the directions on the edges.) {{harvtxt|Erd≈ës|R√©nyi|1963}} constructed the Rado graph as the random graph on a countable number of points. They proved that it has infinitely many automorphisms, and their argument also shows that it is unique though they did not mention this explicitly. {{harvs|first=Richard|last=Rado|authorlink=Richard Rado|txt|year=1964}} rediscovered the Rado graph as a [[universal graph]], and gave an explicit construction of it with vertex set the natural numbers. Rado's construction is essentially equivalent to one of Ackermann's constructions.

==Constructions==
===Binary numbers===
{{harvtxt|Ackermann|1937}} and {{harvtxt|Rado|1964}} constructed the Rado graph using the [[BIT predicate]] as follows. They identified the vertices of the graph with the [[natural number]]s 0, 1, 2, ...
An edge connects vertices ''x'' and ''y'' in the graph (where ''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''y'') whenever the ''x''th bit of the [[Binary numeral system|binary]] representation of ''y'' is nonzero. Thus, for instance, the neighbors of vertex 0 consist of all odd-numbered vertices, because the numbers whose 0th bit is nonzero are exactly the odd numbers. Vertex 1 has one smaller neighbor, vertex 0, as 1 is odd and vertex 0 is connected to all odd vertices. The larger neighbors of vertex 1 are all vertices with numbers congruent to 2 or 3 modulo 4, because those are exactly the numbers with a nonzero bit at index 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ackermann|1937}}; {{harvtxt|Rado|1964}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Random graph===
The Rado graph arises [[almost surely]] in the [[Erd≈ës‚ÄìR√©nyi model]] of a random graph on countably many vertices. Specifically, one may form an infinite graph by choosing, independently and with probability 1/2 for each pair of vertices, whether to connect the two vertices by an edge. With probability 1 the resulting graph is isomorphic to the Rado graph.
This construction also works if any fixed probability ''p'' not equal to 0 or 1 is used in place of 1/2.&lt;ref name="binary-extension"&gt;See {{harvtxt|Cameron|1997}}, Fact 1 and its proof.&lt;/ref&gt;

This result, shown by {{harvs|first1=Paul|last1=Erd≈ës|author1-link=Paul Erd≈ës|last2=R√©nyi|first2=Alfr√©d|author2-link=Alfr√©d R√©nyi|year=1963|txt}}, justifies the [[definite article]] in the common alternative name ‚Äú'''the''' random graph‚Äù for the Rado graph.
For finite graphs, repeatedly drawing a graph from the Erd≈ës‚ÄìR√©nyi model will often lead to different graphs, but for countably infinite graphs the model [[almost always]] produces the same graph.{{sfnp|Erd≈ës|R√©nyi|1963}}

For any graph generated randomly in this way, the [[complement graph]] can be obtained at the same time by reversing all the choices: including an edge when the first graph did not include the same edge, and vice versa. This construction of the complement graph is an instance of the same process of choosing randomly and independently whether to include each edge, so it also (with probability 1) generates the Rado graph. Therefore, the Rado graph is a [[self-complementary graph]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Cameron|1997}}, Proposition 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other constructions===
In one of Ackermann's original 1937 constructions, the vertices of the Rado graph are indexed by the hereditarily finite sets, and there is an edge between two vertices exactly when one of the corresponding finite sets is a member of the other.
A similar construction can be based on [[Skolem's paradox]], the fact that there exists a countable model for the first-order theory of sets. One can construct the Rado graph from such a model by creating a vertex for each set, with an edge connecting each pair of sets where one set in the pair is a member of the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Cameron|1997}}, Theorem 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rado graph may also be formed by a construction resembling that for [[Paley graph]]s. Take as the vertices of a graph all the [[prime number]]s that are congruent to 1 modulo 4, and connect two vertices by an edge whenever one of the two numbers is a [[quadratic residue]] modulo the other. By [[quadratic reciprocity]] and the restriction of the vertices to primes congruent to 1 mod 4, this is a [[symmetric relation]], so it defines an undirected graph, which turns out to be isomorphic to the Rado graph.&lt;ref name=paley/&gt;

Another construction of the Rado graph shows that it is an infinite [[circulant graph]], with the integers as its vertices and with an edge between each two integers whose distance (the [[absolute value]] of their difference) belongs to a particular set ''S''. To construct the Rado graph in this way, ''S'' may be chosen randomly, or by choosing the [[indicator function]] of ''S'' to be the concatenation of all finite [[binary sequence]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Cameron|1997}}, Section 1.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rado graph can also be constructed as the block [[intersection graph]] of an infinite [[block design]] in which the number of points and the size of each block are [[countably infinite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Horsley|Pike|Sanaei|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
===Extension===
[[File:Rado extension.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|The extension property of the Rado graph: for every two disjoint finite sets of vertices ''U'' and ''V'', there exists another vertex ''x'' connected to everything in ''U'', and to nothing in ''V'']]
The Rado graph satisfies the following extension property: for every two disjoint finite sets of vertices ''U'' and ''V'', there exists a vertex ''x'' outside both sets that is connected to all vertices in ''U'', but has no neighbors in ''V''.&lt;ref name="binary-extension"/&gt;
For instance, with the binary-number definition of the Rado graph, let
:&lt;math&gt;x=2^{1+\max(U\cup V)} + \sum_{u\in U} 2^u.&lt;/math&gt;
Then the nonzero bits in the binary representation of ''x'' cause it to be adjacent to everything in ''U''. However, ''x'' has no nonzero bits in its binary representation corresponding to vertices in ''V'', and ''x'' is so large that the ''x''th bit of every element of ''V'' is zero. Thus, ''x'' is not adjacent to any vertex in ''V''.&lt;ref&gt;Essentially the same construction, described in set-theoretic terms rather than using binary numbers, is given as Theorem 2 of {{harvtxt|Cameron|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the random-graph definition of the Rado graph, each vertex outside the union of ''U'' and ''V'' has probability 1/2&lt;sup&gt;|''U''| + |''V''|&lt;/sup&gt; of fulfilling the extension property, independently of the other vertices. Because there are infinitely many vertices to choose from, each with the same finite probability of success, the probability is one that there exists a vertex that fulfils the extension property.&lt;ref name="binary-extension"/&gt; With the Paley graph definition, for any sets ''U'' and ''V'', by the [[Chinese remainder theorem]], the numbers that are quadratic residues modulo every prime in ''U'' and nonresidues modulo every prime in ''V'' form a periodic sequence, so by [[Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions|Dirichlet's theorem]] on primes in arithmetic progressions this number-theoretic graph has the extension property.&lt;ref name=paley&gt;{{harvs|last=Cameron|year=1997|year2=2001|txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Induced subgraphs===
The extension property can be used to build up isomorphic copies of any finite or countably infinite graph ''G'' within the Rado graph.
To do so, order the vertices of ''G'', and add vertices in the same order to a partial copy of ''G'' within the Rado graph.
At each step, the next vertex in ''G'' will be adjacent to some set ''U'' of vertices in ''G'' that are earlier in the ordering of the vertices,
and non-adjacent to the remaining set ''V'' of earlier vertices in ''G''.
By the extension property, the Rado graph will also have a vertex ''x'' that is adjacent to all the vertices in the partial copy that correspond to members of ''U'',
and non-adjacent to all the vertices in the partial copy that correspond to members of ''V''. Adding ''x'' to the partial copy of ''G'' produces a larger partial copy, with one more vertex.&lt;ref name=induced&gt;{{harvtxt|Cameron|1997}}, Proposition 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

This method forms the basis for a [[proof by induction]], with the [[empty graph|0-vertex subgraph]] as its base case, that every finite or [[countable set|countably infinite]] graph is an induced subgraph of the Rado graph.&lt;ref name=induced/&gt;

===Uniqueness===
The Rado graph is, up to [[graph isomorphism]], the only countable graph with the extension property. For, let ''G'' and ''H'' be two countable graphs with the extension property, let ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; be isomorphic finite induced subgraphs of ''G'' and ''H'' respectively, and let ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; be the first vertices in an enumeration of the vertices of ''G'' and ''H'' respectively that do not belong to ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. Then, by applying the extension property twice, one can find isomorphic induced subgraphs ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sub&gt; that include ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; together with all the vertices of the previous subgraphs. By repeating this process, one may build up a sequence of isomorphisms between induced subgraphs that eventually includes every vertex in ''G'' and ''H''. Thus, by the [[back-and-forth method]], ''G'' and ''H'' must be isomorphic.&lt;ref name="cam"&gt;{{harvtxt|Cameron|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Because the graphs constructed by the random graph construction, binary number construction, and Paley graph construction are all countable graphs with the extension property, this argument shows that they are all isomorphic to each other.

===Symmetry===
Applying the back-and-forth construction to any two isomorphic finite subgraphs of the Rado graph extends their isomorphism to an [[Graph automorphism|automorphism]] of the entire Rado graph. The fact that every isomorphism of finite subgraphs extends to an automorphism of the whole graph is expressed by saying that the Rado graph is ''ultrahomogeneous''.&lt;ref name="cam"/&gt; In particular, there is an automorphism taking any ordered pair of adjacent vertices to any other such ordered pair, so the Rado graph is a [[symmetric graph]].

The [[automorphism group]] of the Rado graph is a [[simple group]], whose number of elements is the [[cardinality of the continuum]]. Every [[subgroup]] of this group whose [[Index of a subgroup|index]] is less than the cardinality of the continuum can be sandwiched between the pointwise stabilizer and the stabilizer of a finite set of vertices.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Cameron|1997}}, Section 1.8: The automorphism group.&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction of the Rado graph as an infinite circulant graph shows that its symmetry group includes automorphisms that generate a transitive [[infinite cyclic group]]. The difference set of this construction (the set of distances in the integers between adjacent vertices) can be constrained to include the difference 1, without affecting the correctness of this construction, from which it follows that the Rado graph contains an infinite [[Hamiltonian path]] whose symmetries are a subgroup of the symmetries of the whole graph.{{sfnp|Henson|1971}}

===Robustness against finite changes===
If a graph ''G'' is formed from the Rado graph by deleting any finite number of edges or vertices, or adding a finite number of edges, the change does not affect the extension property of the graph. For any pair of sets ''U'' and ''V'' it is still possible to find a vertex in the modified graph that is adjacent to everything in ''U'' and nonadjacent to everything in ''V'', by adding the modified parts of ''G'' to ''V'' and applying the extension property in the unmodified Rado graph. Therefore, any finite modification of this type results in a graph that is isomorphic to the Rado graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Cameron|1997}}, Section 1.3: Indestructability.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partition===
For any partition of the vertices of the Rado graph into two sets ''A'' and ''B'', or more generally for any partition into finitely many subsets, at least one of the subgraphs induced by one of the partition sets is isomorphic to the whole Rado graph. {{harvtxt|Cameron|2001}} gives the following short proof: if none of the parts induces a subgraph isomorphic to the Rado graph, they all fail to have the extension property, and one can find pairs of sets ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; that cannot be extended within each subgraph. But then, the union of the sets ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and the union of the sets ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; would form a set that could not be extended in the whole graph, contradicting the Rado graph's extension property. This property of being isomorphic to one of the induced subgraphs of any partition is held by only three countably infinite undirected graphs: the Rado graph, the [[complete graph]], and the [[empty graph]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Cameron|1990}}; {{harvtxt|Diestel|Leader|Scott|Thomass√©|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{harvtxt|Bonato|Cameron|Deliƒá|2000}} and {{harvtxt|Diestel|Leader|Scott|Thomass√©|2007}} investigate infinite [[directed graph]]s with the same partition property; all are formed by choosing orientations for the edges of the complete graph or the Rado graph.

A related result concerns edge partitions instead of vertex partitions: for every partition of the edges of the Rado graph into finitely many sets, there is a subgraph isomorphic to the whole Rado graph that uses at most two of the colors. However, there may not necessarily exist an isomorphic subgraph that uses only one color of edges.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Pouzet|Sauer|1996}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model theory and 0-1 laws==
{{harvtxt|Fagin|1976}} used the Rado graph to prove a [[zero‚Äìone law]] for [[first-order logic|first-order]] statements in the [[logic of graphs]]. When a logical statement of this type is true or false for the Rado graph, it is also true or false (respectively) for [[almost all]] finite graphs.

===First order properties===
The first-order language of graphs is the collection of well-formed [[Sentence (mathematical logic)|sentences in mathematical logic]] formed from variables representing the vertices of graphs, [[universal quantification|universal]] and [[existential quantification|existential quantifiers]], [[logical connective]]s, and [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]] for equality and adjacency of vertices.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Spencer|2001}}, Section 1.2, "What Is a First Order Theory?", [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZJfsCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA15 pp.&amp;nbsp;15‚Äì17].&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the condition that a graph does not have any [[isolated vertex|isolated vertices]] may be expressed by the sentence
:&lt;math&gt;\forall u:\exists v: u\sim v&lt;/math&gt;
where the &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; symbol indicates the adjacency relation between two vertices.
This sentence &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is true for some graphs, and false for others; a graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is said to ''model'' &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, written &lt;math&gt;G\models S&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is true of the vertices and adjacency relation of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

The extension property of the Rado graph may be expressed by a collection of first-order sentences &lt;math&gt;E_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt;, stating that for every choice of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; vertices in a set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; vertices in a set &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, all distinct, there exists a vertex adjacent to everything in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and nonadjacent to everything in &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Spencer|2001}}, Section 1.3, "Extension Statements and Rooted Graphs", [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZJfsCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA17 pp.&amp;nbsp;17‚Äì18].&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, &lt;math&gt;E_{1,1}&lt;/math&gt; can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;\forall a:\forall b:a\ne b\rightarrow\exists c:c\ne a\wedge c\ne b\wedge c\sim a\wedge\lnot(c\sim b).&lt;/math&gt;

===Completeness===
{{harvtxt|Gaifman|1964}} proved that the sentences  &lt;math&gt;E_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt;, together with additional sentences stating that the adjacency relation is [[Symmetric relation|symmetric]] and [[Reflexive relation|antireflexive]] (that is, that a graph modeling these sentences is undirected and has no self-loops), are the axioms of a [[complete theory]]. This means that, for each first-order sentence &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, exactly one of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and its negation can be proven from these axioms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gaifman|1964}}; {{harvtxt|Marker|2002}}, Theorem&amp;nbsp;2.4.2, p.&amp;nbsp;50.&lt;/ref&gt;
Because the Rado graph models the extension axioms, it models all sentences in this theory.

In logic, a theory that has only one model (up to isomorphism) with a given infinite [[cardinality]] {{mvar|&amp;lambda;}} is called [[Morley's categoricity theorem|{{mvar|&amp;lambda;}}-categorical]]. The fact that the Rado graph is the unique countable graph with the extension property implies that it is also the unique countable model for its theory. This uniqueness property of the Rado graph can be expressed by saying that the theory of the Rado graph is [[Omega-categorical theory|œâ-categorical]]. [[Jerzy ≈Åo≈õ|≈Åo≈õ]] and [[Robert Lawson Vaught|Vaught]] proved in 1954 that when a theory is {{mvar|&amp;lambda;}}‚Äìcategorical (for some infinite cardinal {{mvar|&amp;lambda;}}) and, in addition, has no finite models, then the theory must be complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|≈Åo≈õ|1954}}; {{harvtxt|Vaught|1954}}; {{harvtxt|Enderton|1972}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LHjNCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA147 p.&amp;nbsp;147].&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Gaifman's theorem that the theory of the Rado graph is complete follows from the uniqueness of the Rado graph by the [[≈Åo≈õ‚ÄìVaught test]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Marker|2002}}, Theorem&amp;nbsp;2.2.6, p.&amp;nbsp;42.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finite graphs and computational complexity===
As {{harvtxt|Fagin|1976}} proved, the first-order sentences provable from the extension axioms and modeled by the Rado graph are exactly the sentences true for [[almost always|almost all]] random finite graphs. This means that if one chooses an {{mvar|n}}-vertex graph uniformly at random among all graphs on {{mvar|n}} labeled vertices, then the probability that such a sentence will be true for the chosen graph approaches one in the limit as {{mvar|n}} approaches infinity. Symmetrically, the sentences that are not modeled by the Rado graph are false for almost all random finite graphs. It follows that every first-order sentence is either [[almost always]] true or almost always false for random finite graphs, and these two possibilities can be distinguished by determining whether the Rado graph models the sentence. Fagin's proof uses the [[compactness theorem]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Fagin|1976}}; {{harvtxt|Marker|2002}}, Theorem&amp;nbsp;2.4.4, pp.&amp;nbsp;51‚Äì52.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this equivalence, the theory of sentences modeled by the Rado graph has been called "the theory of the random graph" or "the almost sure theory of graphs".

Because of this [[0-1 law]], it is possible to test whether any particular first-order sentence is modeled by the Rado graph in a finite amount of time, by choosing a large enough value of {{mvar|n}} and counting the number of {{mvar|n}}-vertex graphs that model the sentence. However, here, "large enough" is at least exponential in the size of the sentence. For instance the extension axiom {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;''k'',0&lt;/sub&gt;}} implies the existence of a {{math|(''k'' + 1)}}-vertex [[Clique (graph theory)|clique]], but a clique of that size exists with high probability only in random graphs of size exponential in {{mvar|k}}.
It is unlikely that determining whether the Rado graph models a given sentence can be done more quickly than exponential time, as the problem is [[PSPACE-complete]].{{sfnp|Grandjean|1983}}

===Saturated model===
From the [[model theory|model theoretic]] point of view, the Rado graph is an example of a [[saturated model]]. This is just a logical formulation of the property that the Rado graph contains all finite graphs as induced subgraphs.{{sfnp|Lascar|2002}}

In this context, a [[Type (model theory)|type]] is a set of variables together with a collection of constraints on the values of some or all of the predicates determined by those variables; a complete type is a type that constrains all of the predicates determined by its variables. In the theory of graphs, the variables represent vertices and the predicates are the adjacencies between vertices, so a complete type specifies whether an edge is present or absent between every pair of vertices represented by the given variables. That is, a complete type specifies the subgraph that a particular set of vertex variables induces.{{sfnp|Lascar|2002}}

A saturated model is a model that realizes all of the types that have a number of variables at most equal to the cardinality of the model. The Rado graph has induced subgraphs of all finite or countably infinite types, so it is saturated.{{sfnp|Lascar|2002}}

==Related concepts==
Although the Rado graph is universal for induced subgraphs, it is not universal for [[isometry|isometric embeddings]] of graphs,
where an isometric embedding is a graph isomorphism which preserves [[distance (graph theory)|distance]]. The Rado graph has [[diameter (graph theory)|diameter]] two, and so any graph with larger diameter does not embed isometrically into it. {{harvs|last=Moss|year=1989|year2=1991|txt}} has investigated universal graphs for isometric embedding; he finds a family of universal graphs, one for each possible finite graph diameter. The graph in his family with diameter two is the Rado graph.

The [[Henson graph]]s are countable graphs (one for each positive integer {{mvar|i}}) that do not contain an {{mvar|i}}-vertex [[clique (graph theory)|clique]], and are universal for {{mvar|i}}-clique-free graphs. They can be constructed as induced subgraphs of the Rado graph.{{sfnp|Henson|1971}} The Rado graph, the Henson graphs, the disjoint unions of isomorphic cliques, and the complements of disjoint unions of cliques are the only possible countably infinite [[homogeneous graph]]s.{{sfnp|Lachlan|Woodrow|1980}}

The universality property of the Rado graph can be extended to edge-colored graphs; that is, graphs in which the edges have been assigned to different color classes, but without the usual [[edge coloring]] requirement that each color class form a [[Matching (graph theory)|matching]]. For any finite or countably infinite number of colors œá, there exists a unique countably-infinite œá-edge-colored graph ''G''&lt;sub&gt;œá&lt;/sub&gt; such that every partial isomorphism of a œá-edge-colored finite graph can be extended to a full isomorphism. With this notation, the Rado graph is just ''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. {{harvtxt|Truss|1985}} investigates the automorphism groups of this more general family of graphs.

{{harvs|last=Shelah|year=1984|year2=1990|txt}} investigates universal graphs with uncountably many vertices.

'''Ramsey theory''', named after the British mathematician and philosopher [[Frank P. Ramsey]], is a branch of [[mathematics]] that studies the conditions under which order must appear. Problems in Ramsey theory typically ask a question of the form: "how many elements of some structure must there be to guarantee that a particular property will hold?"  More specifically, [[Ronald L. Graham|Ron Graham]] describes Ramsey theory as a "branch of  [[combinatorics]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Graham | first = Ron | last2 = Butler | first2 = Steve | title = Rudiments of Ramsey Theory | edition = 2nd  | year = 2015 | publisher = American Mathematical Society | isbn = 978-0-8218-4156-3 | page = 1 |authorlink2=Steve Butler (mathematician)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
A typical result in Ramsey theory starts with some mathematical structure that
is then cut into pieces. How big must the original structure be in order to ensure that at least one of the pieces has a given interesting property? This idea can be defined as [[partition regularity]].

For example, consider a [[complete graph|complete]] [[Graph theory|graph]] of order ''n''; that is, there are ''n'' vertices and each vertex is connected to every other vertex by an edge. A complete graph of order 3 is called a triangle.  Now colour every edge red or blue. How large must ''n'' be in order to ensure that there is either a blue triangle or a red triangle? It turns out that the answer is 6. See the article on [[Ramsey's theorem]] for a rigorous [[mathematical proof|proof]].

Another way to express this result is as follows: at any party with at least six people, there are three people who are all either mutual acquaintances (each one knows the other two) or mutual strangers (each one does not know either of the other two). See [[theorem on friends and strangers]].

This also is a special case of [[Ramsey's theorem]], which says that for any given integer ''c'', any given integers ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''n''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;, there is a number,   ''R''(''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''n''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;), such that if the edges of a complete graph of order ''R''(''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''n''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;) are coloured with ''c'' different colours, then for some ''i'' between 1 and ''c'', it must contain a complete subgraph of order ''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' whose edges are all colour ''i''. The special case above has ''c'' = 2 and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 3.

==Results==
Two key theorems of Ramsey theory are:

* [[Van der Waerden's theorem]]: For any given ''c'' and ''n'', there is a number ''V'', such that if ''V'' consecutive numbers are coloured with ''c'' different colours,  then it must contain an [[arithmetic progression]] of length ''n'' whose elements are all the same colour.
* [[Hales‚ÄìJewett theorem]]: For any given ''n'' and ''c'', there is a number ''H'' such that if the cells of an ''H''-dimensional ''n''&amp;times;''n''&amp;times;''n''&amp;times;...&amp;times;''n'' cube are coloured with ''c'' colours, there must be one row, column, etc. of length ''n'' all of whose cells are the same colour. That is: a multi-player ''n''-in-a-row [[tic-tac-toe]] cannot end in a draw, no matter how large ''n'' is, and no matter how many people are playing, if you play on a board with sufficiently many dimensions. The [[Hales‚ÄìJewett theorem]] implies [[Van der Waerden's theorem]].

A theorem similar to van der Waerden's theorem is ''[[Schur's theorem]]'': for any given ''c'' there is a number ''N'' such that if the numbers 1, 2, ..., ''N'' are coloured with ''c'' different colours, then there must be a pair of integers ''x'', ''y'' such that ''x'', ''y'', and ''x''+''y'' are all the same colour.  Many generalizations of this theorem exist, including [[Rado's theorem (Ramsey theory)|Rado's theorem]], [[Rado‚ÄìFolkman‚ÄìSanders theorem]], [[Hindman's theorem]], and the [[Milliken‚ÄìTaylor theorem]].  A classic reference for these and many other results in Ramsey theory is Graham, Rothschild, Spencer and Solymosi, updated and expanded in 2015 to its first new edition in 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |authorlink=Ronald L.

Results in Ramsey theory typically have two primary characteristics.  Firstly, they are [[non-constructive]]: they may show that some structure exists, but they give no process for finding this structure (other than [[brute-force search]]). For instance, the [[pigeonhole principle]] is of this form.  Secondly, while Ramsey theory results do say that sufficiently large objects must necessarily contain a given structure, often the proof of these results requires these objects to be enormously large ‚Äì bounds that grow [[exponential growth|exponentially]], or even as fast as the [[Ackermann function]] are not uncommon.  In many cases these bounds are artifacts of the proof, and it is not known whether they can be substantially improved. In other cases it is known that any bound must be extraordinarily large, sometimes even greater than any [[primitive recursive]] function; see the [[Paris‚ÄìHarrington theorem]] for an example. [[Graham's number]], one of the largest numbers ever used in serious mathematical proof, is an upper bound for a problem related to Ramsey theory. Another large example is the [[Boolean Pythagorean triples problem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lamb|first=Evelyn|date=2016-06-02|title=Two-hundred-terabyte maths proof is largest ever|url=https://www.nature.com/news/two-hundred-terabyte-maths-proof-is-largest-ever-1.19990|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=534|issue=7605|pages=17‚Äì18|doi=10.1038/nature.2016.19990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theorems in Ramsey theory are generally one of the two types{{which|date=November 2017}}. Many theorems, which are modeled after Ramsey's theorem itself, assert that in every partition of a large structured object, one of the classes necessarily contains a large structured subobject, but give no information about which class this is. Occasionally, the reason behind such ''Ramsey-type'' results is that the largest partition class always contains the desired substructure.  The results of this kind are called either ''density results'' or ''Tur√°n-type result'', after [[Tur√°n's theorem]].  Notable examples include [[Szemer√©di's theorem]], which is such a strengthening of van der Waerden's theorem, and the density version of the Hales-Jewett theorem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |authorlink=Hillel Furstenberg |first=Hillel |last=Furstenberg |authorlink2=Yitzhak Katznelson |first2=Yitzhak |last2=Katznelson |title=A density version of the Hales‚ÄìJewett theorem |journal=[[Journal d'Analyse Math√©matique]] |volume=57 |issue=1 |year=1991 |pages=64‚Äì119 |doi=10.1007/BF03041066 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a '''root of unity''', occasionally called a [[Abraham de Moivre|de Moivre]] number, is any  [[complex number]] that gives 1 when [[exponentiation|raised]] to some positive integer power {{mvar|n}}. Roots of unity are used in many branches of mathematics, and are especially important in [[number theory]], the theory of [[group character]]s, and the [[discrete Fourier transform]].

Roots of unity can be defined in any [[field (mathematics)|field]]. If the [[characteristic of a field|characteristic]] of the field is zero, they are complex numbers that are also [[algebraic integer]]s. In positive characteristic, they belong to a [[finite field]], and, conversely, every nonzero element of a finite field is a root of unity. Any [[algebraically closed field]] contains exactly {{mvar|n}} {{mvar|n}}th roots of unity, except if {{mvar|n}} is a multiple of the (positive) characteristic of the field.

==General definition==
An '''{{mvar|n}}th root of unity''', where {{mvar|n}} is a positive integer (i.e. {{math|1=''n'' = 1,‚Äâ2,‚Äâ3,‚Äâ‚Ä¶}}), is a number {{mvar|z}} satisfying the [[equation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Hadlock, Charles R.|title=Field Theory and Its Classical Problems, Volume 14|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-88385-032-9|pages=84‚Äì86|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5s1p0CyafnEC&amp;pg=PA84}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lang, Serge|chapter=Roots of unity|title=Algebra|publisher=Springer|year=2002|isbn=978-0-387-95385-4|pages=276‚Äì277|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fge-BwqhqIYC&amp;pg=PA276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;z^n = 1. &lt;/math&gt;
Unless otherwise specified, the roots of unity may be taken to be [[complex number]]s (including the number 1, and the number ‚Äì1 if ''n'' is even, which are complex with a zero imaginary part), and in this case, the {{mvar|n}}th roots of unity are
:&lt;math&gt;\exp\left(\frac{2k\pi i}{n}\right)=\cos\frac{2k\pi}{n}+i\sin\frac{2k\pi}{n},\quad\quad k=0,1,\dots , n-1.&lt;/math&gt;

However the defining equation of roots of unity is meaningful over any [[field (mathematics)|field]] (and even over any [[ring (mathematics)|ring]])  {{math|''F''}}, and this allows considering roots of unity in {{math|''F''}}. Whichever is the field {{math|''F''}}, the roots of unity in {{math|''F''}} are either complex numbers, if the [[characteristic of a ring|characteristic]] of {{math|''F''}} is 0, or, otherwise, belong to a [[finite field]]. Conversely, every nonzero element in a finite field is a root of unity in that field. See [[Root of unity modulo n|Root of unity modulo ''n'']] and [[Finite field]] for further details.

An {{mvar|n}}th root of unity is '''{{visible anchor|primitive}}''' if it is not a {{mvar|k}}th root of unity for some smaller {{mvar|k}}, that is if

:&lt;math&gt;z^n=1\quad \text{and} \quad z^k \ne 1 \text{ for } k = 1, 2, 3, \ldots, n-1. &lt;/math&gt;
If ''n'' is a [[prime number]], all {{math|''n''}}th roots of unity, except 1, are primitive.

In the above formula in terms of exponential and trigonometric functions, the primitive {{mvar|n}}th roots of unity are those for which {{mvar|k}} and {{mvar|n}} are [[coprime integers]].

Subsequent sections of this article will comply with complex roots of unity. For the case of roots of unity in fields of nonzero characteristic, see {{slink|Finite field|Roots of unity}}. For the case of roots of unity in rings of [[modular arithmetic|modular integers]], see [[Root of unity modulo n]].

==Elementary properties==
Every {{math|''n''}}th root of unity {{math|''z''}} is a primitive {{math|''a''}}th root of unity for some {{math|''a'' ‚â§ ''n''}}, which is the smallest positive integer such that {{math|1=''z''&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt; = 1}}. 

If {{math|''z''}} is an {{math|''n''}}th root of unity and {{math|''a'' &amp;equiv; ''b'' (mod ''n'')}} then {{math|1=''z''&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''z''&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. In fact, by the definition of [[congruence relation|congruence]], {{math|1=''a'' = ''b'' + ''kn''}} for some integer {{math|''k''}}, and
:&lt;math&gt; z^a = z^{b+kn} = z^b z^{kn} = z^b (z^n)^k = z^b 1^k = z^b.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, given a power {{math|''z''&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt;}} of {{math|''z''}}, one has {{math|1=''z''&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''z''&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, where {{math|0 ‚â§ ''r'' &lt; ''n''}} is the remainder of the [[Euclidean division]] of {{mvar|a}} by {{mvar|n}}.

Any integer power of an {{math|''n''}}th root of unity is also an {{math|''n''}}th root of unity, as
:&lt;math&gt;(z^k)^n = z^{kn} = (z^n)^k = 1^k = 1.&lt;/math&gt;
This is also true for negative exponents. In particular, the reciprocal of an {{math|''n''}}th root of unity is its [[complex conjugate]], and is also an {{math|''n''}}th root of unity:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{z} = z^{-1} = z^{n-1} = \bar z.&lt;/math&gt;

Let {{math|''z''}} be a primitive {{math|''n''}}th root of unity. Then the powers {{math|''z''}}, {{math|''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}},‚Äâ...,‚Äâ{{math|''z''&lt;sup&gt;''n''‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{math|1=''z''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''z''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 1}} are {{math|''n''}}th root of unity and are all distinct. (If {{math|1=''z''&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''z''&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt;}} where {{math|1 ‚â§ ''a'' &lt; ''b'' ‚â§ ''n''}}, then {{math|1=''z''&lt;sup&gt;''b''‚àí''a''&lt;/sup&gt; = 1}}, which would imply that {{math|''z''}} would not be primitive.) This implies that  {{math|''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}},‚Äâ...,‚Äâ{{math|''z''&lt;sup&gt;''n''‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{math|1=''z''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''z''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 1}} are all of the {{math|''n''}}th roots of unity, since an {{math|''n''}}th-degree polynomial equation has at most {{math|''n''}} distinct solutions.

From the preceding, it follows that, if {{math|''z''}} is a primitive {{math|''n''}}th root of unity, then &lt;math&gt;z^a = z^b&lt;/math&gt; if and only if  &lt;math&gt;a\equiv b \pmod{ n}.&lt;/math&gt;
If {{math|''z''}} is not primitive then  &lt;math&gt;a\equiv b \pmod{ n}&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;z^a = z^b,&lt;/math&gt; but the converse may be false, as shown by the following example. If {{math|1=''n'' = 4}}, a non-primitive {{math|''n''}}th root of unity is {{math|1= ''z'' = ‚Äì1}}, and one has &lt;math&gt;z^2 = z^4 = 1&lt;/math&gt;, although &lt;math&gt; 2 \not\equiv 4 \pmod{4}.&lt;/math&gt;

Let {{math|''z''}} be a primitive {{math|''n''}}th root of unity. A power {{math|1=''w'' = ''z''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;}} of {{mvar|z}} is a primitive {{math|''a''}}th root of unity for 
:&lt;math&gt; a = \frac{n}{\gcd(k,n)},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\gcd(k,n)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[greatest common divisor]] of {{mvar|n}} and {{mvar|k}}. This results from the fact that {{math|''ka''}} is the smallest multiple of {{mvar|k}} that is also a multiple of {{mvar|n}}. In other words, {{math|''ka''}} is the [[least common multiple]] of {{mvar|k}} and {{mvar|n}}. Thus 
:&lt;math&gt;a =\frac{\operatorname{lcm}(k,n)}{k}=\frac{kn}{k\gcd(k,n)}=\frac{n}{\gcd(k,n)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, if {{math|''k''}} and {{math|''n''}} are [[coprime]], {{math|''z&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;''}} is also a primitive {{math|''n''}}th root of unity, and therefore there are {{math|''œÜ''(''n'')}} (where {{math|''œÜ''}} is [[Euler's totient function]]) distinct primitive {{math|''n''}}th roots of unity. (This implies that if {{math|''n''}} is a prime number, all the roots except {{math|+1}} are primitive.)

In other words, if {{math|R(''n'')}} is the set of all {{math|''n''}}th roots of unity and {{math|P(''n'')}} is the set of primitive ones, {{math|R(''n'')}} is a disjoint union of the {{math|P(''n'')}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{R}(n) = \bigcup_{d\,|\,n}\operatorname{P}(d),&lt;/math&gt;

where the notation means that {{math|''d''}} goes through all the divisors of {{math|''n''}}, including {{math|1}} and {{math|''n''}}.

Since the cardinality of {{math|R(''n'')}} is {{math|''n''}}, and that of {{math|P(''n'')}} is {{math|''œÜ''(''n'')}}, this  demonstrates the classical formula

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{d\,|\,n}\varphi(d) = n.&lt;/math&gt;

==Group properties==
===Group of all roots of unity===
The product and the [[multiplicative inverse]] of two roots of unity are also roots of unity. In fact, if {{math|''x&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'' {{=}} 1}} and {{math|''y&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' {{=}} 1}}, then {{math|(''x''&lt;sup&gt;‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt;){{sup|''m''}} {{=}} 1}}, and {{math|(''xy''){{sup|''k''}} {{=}} 1}}, where {{math|''k''}} is the [[least common multiple]] of {{math|''m''}} and {{math|''n''}}.

Therefore, the roots of unity form an [[abelian group]] under multiplication. This group is the [[torsion subgroup]] of the [[circle group]]

===Group of {{math|''n''}}th roots of unity===
The product and the [[multiplicative inverse]] of two {{math|''n''}}th roots of unity are also {{math|''n''}}th roots of unity. Therefore, the {{math|''n''}}th roots of unity form a [[group (mathematics)|group]] under multiplication.

Given a primitive {{math|''n''}}th root of unity {{math|''œâ''}}, the other {{math|''n''}}th roots are powers of {{math|''œâ''}}. This means that the group of the {{math|''n''}}th roots of unity is a [[cyclic group]]. It is worth remarking that the term of ''cyclic group'' originated from the fact that this group is a subgroup of the [[circle group]].

===Galois group of the primitive {{math|''n''}}th roots of unity===
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Q(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; be the [[field extension]] of the rational numbers generated over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Q&lt;/math&gt; by a primitive {{math|''n''}}th root of unity {{math|''œâ''}}. As every {{math|''n''}}th root of unity is a power of {{math|''œâ''}}, the [[field (mathematics)|field]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Q(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; contains all {{math|''n''}}th roots of unity, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Q(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Galois extension]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Q.&lt;/math&gt;

If {{math|''k''}} is an integer, {{math|''œâ&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;''}} is a primitive {{math|''n''}}th root of unity if and only if {{math|''k''}} and {{math|''n''}} are [[coprime]]. In this case, the map
:&lt;math&gt;\omega \mapsto \omega^k&lt;/math&gt; 
induces an [[field automorphism|automorphism]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Q(\omega)&lt;/math&gt;, which maps every {{math|''n''}}th root of unity to its {{math|''k''}}th power. Every automorphism of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Q(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; is obtained in this way, and these automorphisms form the [[Galois group]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Q(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; over the field of the rationals.

The rules of [[exponentiation]] imply that the composition of two such automorphisms is obtained by multiplying the exponents. It follows that the map
:&lt;math&gt;k\mapsto \left(\omega \mapsto \omega^k\right)&lt;/math&gt;
defines a [[group isomorphism]] between the [[unit (ring theory)|units]] of the ring of [[integers modulo n|integers modulo {{math|''n''}}]] and the Galois group of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Q(\omega).&lt;/math&gt;

This shows that this Galois group is [[abelian group|abelian]], and implies thus that the primitive roots of unity may be expressed in terms of radicals.

==Trigonometric expression==
[[Image:3rd roots of unity.svg|thumb|right|The 3rd roots of unity]]
[[Image:complex x hoch 3.jpg|thumb|right|Plot of {{math|''z''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ‚àí 1}}, in which a zero is represented by the color black. See [[Domain coloring]] for interpretation.]]
[[Image:Complex x hoch 5.jpg|thumb|right|Plot of {{math|''z''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; ‚àí 1}}, in which a zero is represented by the color black.]]

[[De Moivre's formula]], which is valid for all real {{mvar|x}} and integers {{mvar|n}}, is

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\cos x + i \sin x\right)^n = \cos nx + i \sin nx.&lt;/math&gt;

Setting {{math|1=''x'' = {{sfrac|2œÄ|''n''}}}} gives a primitive {{mvar|n}}th root of unity, one gets

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\cos\frac{2\pi}{n} + i \sin\frac{2\pi}{n}\right)^n = \cos 2\pi + i \sin 2\pi = 1,&lt;/math&gt;

but
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\cos\frac{2\pi}{n} + i \sin\frac{2\pi}{n}\right)^k= \cos\frac{2k\pi}{n} + i \sin\frac{2k\pi}{n} \neq 1&lt;/math&gt;
for {{math|1=''k'' = 1, 2, ‚Ä¶, ''n'' ‚àí 1}}. In other words, 
:&lt;math&gt;\cos\frac{2\pi}{n} + i \sin\frac{2\pi}{n}&lt;/math&gt;
is a primitive {{mvar|n}}th root of unity.

This formula shows that on the [[complex plane]] the {{mvar|n}}th roots of unity are at the vertices of a  [[regular polygon|regular {{mvar|n}}-sided polygon]] inscribed in the [[unit circle]], with one vertex at 1. (See the plots for {{math|1=''n'' = 3}} and {{math|1=''n'' = 5}} on the right.) This geometric fact accounts for the term "cyclotomic" in such phrases as [[cyclotomic field]] and [[cyclotomic polynomial]]; it is from the Greek roots "[[wikt:Œ∫œçŒ∫ŒªŒøœÇ|cyclo]]" (circle) plus "[[wikt:œÑœåŒºŒøœÇ|tomos]]" (cut, divide).

[[Euler's formula]]

:&lt;math&gt;e^{i x} = \cos x + i \sin x,&lt;/math&gt;

which is valid for all real {{mvar|x}}, can be used to put the formula for the {{mvar|n}}th roots of unity into the form

:&lt;math&gt;e^{2\pi i \frac{k}{n}} \qquad 0 \le k &lt; n.&lt;/math&gt;

It follows from the discussion in the previous section that this is a primitive {{mvar|n}}th-root if and only if the fraction {{math|{{sfrac|''k''|''n''}}}} is in lowest terms, i.e. that {{mvar|k}} and {{mvar|n}} are coprime.

==Algebraic expression==

The {{math|''n''}}th roots of unity are, by definition, the roots of the polynomial {{math|''x&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' ‚àí 1}}, and are thus [[algebraic number]]s. As this polynomial is not [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]] (except for {{math|1=''n'' = 1}}), the primitive {{math|''n''}}th roots of unity are roots of an irreducible polynomial of lower degree, called the [[cyclotomic polynomial]], and often denoted {{math|Œ¶&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The degree of {{math|Œ¶&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is given by [[Euler's totient function]], which counts (among other things) the number of primitive {{math|''n''}}th roots of unity. The roots of {{math|Œ¶&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are exactly the primitive {{math|''n''}}th roots of unity.

[[Galois theory]] can be used to show that cyclotomic polynomials may be conveniently solved in terms of radicals. (The trivial form &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[n]{1}&lt;/math&gt; is not convenient, because it contains non-primitive roots, such as 1, which are not roots of the cyclotomic polynomial, and because it does not give the real and imaginary parts separately.) This means that, for each positive integer {{mvar|n}}, there exists an expression built from integers by root extractions, additions, subtractions, multiplications, and divisions (nothing else), such that the primitive {{mvar|n}}th roots of unity are exactly the set of values that can be obtained by choosing values for the root extractions ({{mvar|k}} possible values for a {{mvar|k}}th root). (For more details see {{slink||Cyclotomic fields}}, below.)

Gauss proved that a primitive {{mvar|n}}th root of unity can be expressed using only [[square root]]s, addition, subtraction, multiplication and division if and only if it is possible to [[Compass-and-straightedge construction|construct with compass and straightedge]] the [[regular polygon|regular {{mvar|n}}-gon]]. This is the case [[if and only if]] {{math|''n''}} is either a power of two or the product of a power of two and [[Fermat prime]]s that are all different. 

If {{mvar|z}} is a {{mvar|n}}th root of unity, the same is true for {{math|1/''z''}}, and &lt;math&gt;r=z+\frac 1z&lt;/math&gt; is twice the real part of {{mvar|z}}. In other words, {{math|Œ¶&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a [[reciprocal polynomial]], the polynomial &lt;math&gt;R_n&lt;/math&gt; that has {{mvar|r}} as a root may be deduced from {{math|Œ¶&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} by the standard manipulation on reciprocal polynomials, and the primitive {{mvar|n}}th roots of unity may be deduced for the roots of &lt;math&gt;R_n&lt;/math&gt; by solving the [[quadratic equation]] &lt;math&gt;z^2-rz+1=0.&lt;/math&gt; That is, the real part of the primitive root is &lt;math&gt;\frac r2,&lt;/math&gt; and its imaginary part is &lt;math&gt;\pm i\sqrt{1-\frac r2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The polynomial &lt;math&gt;R_n&lt;/math&gt; is an irreducible polynomial whose all roots are real. Its degree is a power of two, if and only if {{mvar|n}} is a product of a power of two by a product (possibly empty) of distinct Fermat primes, and the regular {{mvar|n}}-gon is constructible with compass and straightedge. Otherwise, it is solvable in radicals, but one are in the [[casus irreducibilis]], that is, every expression of the roots in terms of radicals involves ''nonreal radicals''. 

===Explicit expressions in low degrees===
* For {{math|1=''n'' = 1}}, the cyclotomic polynomial is {{math|Œ¶&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') {{=}} ''x'' ‚àí 1}} Therefore, the only primitive first root of unity is 1, which is a non-primitive {{math|''n''}}th root of unity for every ''n'' greater than 1.
*As {{math|Œ¶&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') {{=}} ''x'' + 1}}, the only primitive second (square) root of unity is ‚Äì1, which is also a non-primitive {{math|''n''}}th root of unity for every even {{math|''n'' &gt; 2}}. With the preceding case, this completes the list of real roots of unity.
*As {{math|Œ¶&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') {{=}} ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''x'' + 1}}, the primitive third (cube) roots of unity, which are the roots of this [[quadratic polynomial]], are 
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{-1 + i \sqrt{3}}{2}, \frac{-1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2} .&lt;/math&gt;
*As {{math|Œ¶&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') {{=}} ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1}}, the two primitive fourth roots of unity are {{math|''i''}} and {{math|‚àí''i''}}.
*As {{math|Œ¶&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') {{=}} ''x''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; + ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''x'' + 1}}, the four primitive fifth roots of unity are the roots of this [[quartic polynomial]], which may be explicitly solved in terms of radicals, giving the roots
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\varepsilon\sqrt 5 - 1}4 \pm i \frac{\sqrt{10 + 2\varepsilon\sqrt 5}}{4},&lt;/math&gt;
:where &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; may take the two values 1 and ‚Äì1 (the same value in the two occurrences).
*As {{math|Œ¶&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') {{=}} ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ‚àí ''x'' + 1}}, there are two primitive sixth roots of unity, which are the negatives (and also the square roots) of the two primitive cube roots:
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{1 + i \sqrt{3}}{2}, \frac{1 - i \sqrt{3}}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;
*As 7 is not a Fermat prime, the seventh roots of unity are the first that require [[cube root]]s. There are 6 primitive seventh roots of unity, which are pairwise [[complex conjugate]]. The sum of a root and its conjugate is twice its real part. These three sums are the three real roots of the cubic polynomial &lt;math&gt;r^3+r^2-2r-1,&lt;/math&gt; and the primitive seventh roots of unity are
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{r}{2}\pm i\sqrt{1-\frac{r^2}{4}},&lt;/math&gt;
:where {{mvar|r}} runs over the roots of the above polynomial. As for every cubic polynomial, these roots may be expressed in terms of square and cube roots. However, as these three roots are all real, this is [[casus irreducibilis]], and any such expression involves  nonreal cube roots.
*As {{math|Œ¶&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') {{=}} ''x''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; + 1}}, the four primitive eighth roots of unity are the square roots of the primitive fourth roots, {{math|¬±''i''}}. They are thus 
::&lt;math&gt; \pm\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}  \pm i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;
*See [[heptadecagon]] for the real part of a 17th root of unity.

==Periodicity==
If {{mvar|z}} is a primitive {{mvar|n}}th root of unity, then the sequence of powers
: {{math|‚Ä¶‚Äâ,‚Äâ''z''&lt;sup&gt;‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt;,‚Äâ''z''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;,‚Äâ''z''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;,‚Äâ‚Ä¶}}
is {{mvar|n}}-periodic (because {{math|1=''z''&lt;sup&gt;'' j''‚Äâ+‚Äâ''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''z''&lt;sup&gt;'' j''&lt;/sup&gt;‚ãÖ''z''&lt;sup&gt;'' n''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''z''&lt;sup&gt;'' j''&lt;/sup&gt;‚ãÖ1 = ''z''&lt;sup&gt;'' j''&lt;/sup&gt;}} for all values of {{mvar|j}}), and the {{mvar|n}} sequences of powers
:{{math|''s&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'': ‚Ä¶‚Äâ,‚Äâ''z''&lt;sup&gt;'' k''‚ãÖ(‚àí1)&lt;/sup&gt;,‚Äâ''z''&lt;sup&gt;'' k''‚ãÖ0&lt;/sup&gt;,‚Äâ''z''&lt;sup&gt;'' k''‚ãÖ1&lt;/sup&gt;,‚Äâ‚Ä¶}}
for {{math|1=''k'' = 1,‚Äâ‚Ä¶‚Äâ,‚Äâ''n''}} are all {{mvar|n}}-periodic (because {{math|1=''z''&lt;sup&gt;'' k''‚ãÖ(''j''‚Äâ+‚Äâ''n'')&lt;/sup&gt; = ''z''&lt;sup&gt;'' k''‚ãÖ''j''&lt;/sup&gt;}}). Furthermore, the set {{math|{''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,‚Äâ‚Ä¶‚Äâ,‚Äâ''s&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}} of these sequences is a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] of the linear space of all {{mvar|n}}-periodic sequences. This means that ''any'' {{mvar|n}}-periodic sequence of complex numbers
: {{math|‚Ä¶‚Äâ,‚Äâ''x''&lt;sub&gt;‚àí1&lt;/sub&gt;‚Äâ,‚Äâ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;‚Äâ,‚Äâ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,‚Äâ‚Ä¶}}
can be expressed as a [[linear combination]] of powers of a primitive {{mvar|n}}th root of unity:
:&lt;math&gt; x_j = \sum_k X_k \cdot z^{k \cdot j} = X_1 z^{1\cdot j} + \cdots + X_n \cdot z^{n \cdot j}&lt;/math&gt;
for some complex numbers {{math|1=''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,‚Äâ‚Ä¶‚Äâ,‚Äâ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and every integer {{mvar|j}}.

This is a form of [[Fourier analysis]]. If {{mvar|j}} is a (discrete) time variable, then {{mvar|k}} is a [[frequency]] and {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a complex [[amplitude]].

Choosing for the primitive {{mvar|n}}th root of unity
:&lt;math&gt;z = e^\frac{2\pi i}{n} = \cos\frac{2\pi}{n} + i \sin\frac{2\pi}{n}&lt;/math&gt;
allows {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}} to be expressed as a linear combination of {{math|cos}} and {{math|sin}}:
:&lt;math&gt;x_j = \sum_k A_k \cos \frac{2\pi jk}{n} + \sum_k B_k \sin \frac{2\pi jk}{n}.&lt;/math&gt;
This is a [[discrete Fourier transform]].

==Summation==
Let {{math|SR(''n'')}} be the sum of all the {{mvar|n}}th roots of unity, primitive or not. Then

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{SR}(n) =
\begin{cases}
1, &amp; n=1\\
0, &amp; n&gt;1.
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

This is an immediate consequence of [[Vieta's formulas]]. In fact, the {{mvar|n}}th roots of unity being the roots of the polynomial {{math|''X''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;-1}}, their sum is the coefficient of degree {{math|''n'' ‚Äì 1}}, which is either 1 or 0 according whether {{math|1=''n'' = 1}} or {{math|''n'' &gt; 1}}.

Alternatively, for {{math|1=''n'' = 1}} there is nothing to prove. For {{math|1=''n'' &gt; 1}} there exists a root {{math|''z'' ‚â† 1}}. Since the set {{math|''S''}} of all the {{mvar|n}}th roots of unity is a group, {{math|1=''z{{space|hair}}S'' =  ''S''}}, so the sum satisfies {{math|1= ''z'' SR(''n'') =  SR(''n'')}}, whence {{math|1=SR(''n'') = 0}}.

Let {{math|SP(''n'')}} be the sum of all the primitive {{mvar|n}}th roots of unity. Then

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{SP}(n) = \mu(n),&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''Œº''(''n'')}} is the [[M√∂bius function]].

In the section [[Root of unity#Elementary properties|Elementary properties]], it was shown that if {{math|R(''n'')}} is the set of all {{mvar|n}}th roots of unity and {{math|P(''n'')}} is the set of primitive ones, {{math|R(''n'')}} is a disjoint union of the {{math|P(''n'')}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{R}(n) = \bigcup_{d\,|\,n}\operatorname{P}(d),&lt;/math&gt;

This implies

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{SR}(n) = \sum_{d\,|\,n}\operatorname{SP}(d).&lt;/math&gt;

Applying the [[M√∂bius inversion formula]] gives

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{SP}(n) = \sum_{d\,|\,n}\mu(d)\operatorname{SR}\left(\frac{n}{d}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

In this formula, if {{math|''d'' &lt; ''n''}}, then {{math|1=SR({{sfrac|''n''|''d''}}) = 0}}, and for {{math|1=''d'' = ''n''}}: {{math|1=SR({{sfrac|''n''|''d''}}) = 1}}.  Therefore, {{math|1=SP(''n'') = ''Œº''(''n'')}}.

This is the special case {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(1)}} of [[Ramanujan's sum]] {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''s'')}}, defined as the sum of the {{mvar|s}}th powers of the primitive {{mvar|n}}th roots of unity:

:&lt;math&gt;c_n(s) = \sum_{a = 1 \atop \gcd(a, n) = 1}^n e^{2 \pi i \frac{a}{n} s}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Orthogonality==
From the summation formula follows an [[orthogonality]] relationship: for {{math|1=''j'' = 1,‚Äâ‚Ä¶‚Äâ,‚Äâ''n''}} and {{math|1=''j‚Ä≤'' = 1,‚Äâ‚Ä¶‚Äâ,‚Äâ''n''}}

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^{n} \overline{z^{j\cdot k}} \cdot z^{j'\cdot k} = n \cdot\delta_{j,j'}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|&amp;delta;}} is the [[Kronecker delta]] and {{mvar|z}} is any primitive {{mvar|n}}th root of unity.

The [[square matrix|{{math|''n''‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ''n''}} matrix]] {{mvar|U}} whose {{math|(''j'',‚Äâ''k'')}}th entry is

:&lt;math&gt;U_{j,k}=n^{-\frac{1}{2}}\cdot z^{j\cdot k}&lt;/math&gt;

defines a [[discrete Fourier transform]].  Computing the inverse transformation using [[gaussian elimination]] requires {{math|''[[big-O notation|O]]''(''n''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)}} operations.  However, it follows from the orthogonality that {{mvar|U}} is [[unitary matrix|unitary]].  That is,

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^{n} \overline{U_{j,k}} \cdot U_{k,j'} = \delta_{j,j'},&lt;/math&gt;

and thus the inverse of {{mvar|U}} is simply the complex conjugate. (This fact was first noted by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] when solving the problem of [[trigonometric interpolation]]).  The straightforward application of {{mvar|U}} or its inverse to a given vector requires {{math|''O''(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} operations. The [[fast Fourier transform]] algorithms reduces the number of operations further to {{math|''O''(''n''‚Äâlog‚Ää''n'')}}.

==Cyclotomic polynomials==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Cyclotomic polynomial]] --&gt;
{{Main|Cyclotomic polynomial}}

The zeroes of the [[polynomial]]
:&lt;math&gt;p(z) = z^n - 1&lt;/math&gt;
are precisely the {{mvar|n}}th roots of unity, each with multiplicity 1. The {{mvar|n}}th '''[[cyclotomic polynomial]]''' is defined by the fact that its zeros are precisely the ''primitive'' {{mvar|n}}th roots of unity, each with multiplicity 1.
: &lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(z) = \prod_{k=1}^{\varphi(n)}(z-z_k) &lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,‚Äâ''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,‚Äâ''z''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,‚Äâ‚Ä¶‚Äâ,''z''&lt;sub&gt;œÜ(''n'')&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the primitive {{mvar|n}}th roots of unity, and {{math|œÜ(''n'')}} is [[Euler's totient function]]. The polynomial {{math|Œ¶&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''z'')}} has integer coefficients and is an [[irreducible polynomial]] over the [[rational number]]s (i.e., it cannot be written as the product of two positive-degree polynomials with rational coefficients). The case of prime {{mvar|n}}, which is easier than the general assertion, follows by applying [[Eisenstein's criterion]] to the polynomial

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{(z + 1)^n - 1}{(z + 1) - 1},&lt;/math&gt;

and expanding via the binomial theorem.

Every {{mvar|n}}th root of unity is a primitive {{mvar|d}}th root of unity for exactly one positive [[divisor]] {{mvar|d}} of {{mvar|n}}. This implies that

:&lt;math&gt;z^n - 1 = \prod_{d\,\mid\,n} \Phi_d(z).&lt;/math&gt;

This formula represents the factorization of the polynomial {{math|''z''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; ‚àí 1}} into irreducible factors.
:{{math|1=''z''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; ‚àí 1 = ''z'' ‚àí 1}}
:{{math|1=''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ‚àí 1 = (''z'' ‚àí 1)‚ãÖ(''z'' + 1)}}
:{{math|1=''z''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ‚àí 1 = (''z'' ‚àí 1)‚ãÖ(''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''z'' + 1)}}
:{{math|1=''z''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; ‚àí 1 = (''z'' ‚àí 1)‚ãÖ(''z'' + 1)‚ãÖ(''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1)}}
:{{math|1=''z''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; ‚àí 1 = (''z'' ‚àí 1)‚ãÖ(''z''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; + ''z''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  + ''z'' + 1)}}
:{{math|1=''z''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; ‚àí 1 = (''z'' ‚àí 1)‚ãÖ(''z'' + 1)‚ãÖ(''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''z'' + 1)‚ãÖ(''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ‚àí ''z'' + 1)}}
:{{math|1=''z''&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; ‚àí 1 = (''z'' ‚àí 1)‚ãÖ(''z''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; + ''z''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; + ''z''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; + ''z''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  +''z'' + 1)}}
:{{math|1=''z''&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; ‚àí 1 = (''z'' ‚àí 1)‚ãÖ(''z'' + 1)‚ãÖ(''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1)‚ãÖ(''z''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; + 1)}}

Applying [[M√∂bius inversion]] to the formula gives

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(z) = \prod_{d\,\mid n}\left(z^\frac{n}{d} - 1\right)^{\mu(d)} = \prod_{d\,\mid n}\left(z^d - 1\right)^{\mu\left(\frac{n}{d}\right)},&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''Œº''}} is the [[M√∂bius function]].

So the first few cyclotomic polynomials are

:{{math|1=Œ¶&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''z'') = ''z'' ‚àí 1}}
:{{math|1=Œ¶&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''z'') = (''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ‚àí 1)‚ãÖ(''z'' ‚àí 1)&lt;sup&gt;‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt; = ''z'' + 1}}
:{{math|1=Œ¶&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(''z'') = (''z''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ‚àí 1)‚ãÖ(''z'' ‚àí 1)&lt;sup&gt;‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt; = ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''z'' + 1}}
:{{math|1=Œ¶&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(''z'') = (''z''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; ‚àí 1)‚ãÖ(''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ‚àí 1)&lt;sup&gt;‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt; = ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1}}
:{{math|1=Œ¶&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(''z'') = (''z''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; ‚àí 1)‚ãÖ(''z'' ‚àí 1)&lt;sup&gt;‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt; = ''z''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; + ''z''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''z'' + 1}}
:{{math|1=Œ¶&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(''z'') = (''z''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; ‚àí 1)‚ãÖ(''z''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ‚àí 1)&lt;sup&gt;‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt;‚ãÖ(''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ‚àí 1)&lt;sup&gt;‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt;‚ãÖ(''z'' ‚àí 1)  = ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ‚àí ''z'' + 1}}
:{{math|1=Œ¶&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;(''z'') = (''z''&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; ‚àí 1)‚ãÖ(''z'' ‚àí 1)&lt;sup&gt;‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt;  = ''z''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; + ''z''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; + ''z''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; + ''z''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  +''z'' + 1}}
:{{math|1=Œ¶&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;(''z'') = (''z''&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; ‚àí 1)‚ãÖ(''z''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; ‚àí 1)&lt;sup&gt;‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt; = ''z''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; + 1}}

If {{mvar|p}} is a [[prime number]], then all the {{mvar|p}}th roots of unity except 1 are primitive {{mvar|p}}th roots, and we have
: &lt;math&gt;\Phi_p(z) = \frac{z^p - 1}{z - 1} = \sum_{k = 0}^{p - 1} z^k. &lt;/math&gt;
Substituting any positive integer &amp;ge; 2 for {{mvar|z}}, this sum becomes a [[radix|base {{mvar|z}}]] [[repunit]]. Thus a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for a repunit to be prime is that its length be prime.

Note that, contrary to first appearances, ''not'' all coefficients of all cyclotomic polynomials are 0, 1, or ‚àí1.  The first exception is {{math|Œ¶&lt;sub&gt;{{num|105}}&lt;/sub&gt;}}. It is not a surprise it takes this long to get an example, because the behavior of the coefficients depends not so much on {{mvar|n}} as on how many odd prime factors appear in {{mvar|n}}.  More precisely, it can be shown that if {{mvar|n}} has 1 or 2 odd prime factors (e.g., {{math|1=''n'' = 150}}) then the {{mvar|n}}th cyclotomic  polynomial only has coefficients 0, 1 or ‚àí1.  Thus the first conceivable {{mvar|n}} for which there could be a coefficient besides 0, 1, or ‚àí1 is a product of the three smallest odd primes, and that is {{math|1=3‚ãÖ5‚ãÖ7 = 105}}.  This by itself doesn't prove the 105th polynomial has another coefficient, but does show it is the first one which even has a chance of working (and then a computation of the coefficients shows it does).  A theorem of Schur says that there are cyclotomic polynomials with coefficients arbitrarily large in absolute value. In particular, if {{math|1=''n'' = ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;‚ãÖ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;‚ãÖ‚Äâ‚ãØ‚Äâ‚ãÖ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, where {{math|1=''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ‚ãØ &lt; ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are odd primes, {{math|1=''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and ''t'' is odd, then {{math|1 ‚àí ''t''}} occurs as a coefficient in the {{mvar|n}}th cyclotomic polynomial.&lt;ref&gt;Emma Lehmer, ''On the magnitude of the coefficients of the cyclotomic polynomial'',  Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society 42 (1936), no.&amp;nbsp;6, pp.&amp;nbsp;389‚Äì392.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many restrictions are known about the values that cyclotomic polynomials can assume at integer values. For example, if {{mvar|p}} is prime, then {{math|''d''&amp;thinsp;‚à£&amp;thinsp;Œ¶&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''d'')}} if and only {{math|''d'' ‚â° 1 (mod ''p'')}}.

Cyclotomic polynomials are solvable in [[Nth root|radical]]s, as roots of unity are themselves radicals. Moreover, there exist more informative radical expressions for {{mvar|n}}th roots of unity with the additional property&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Landau|first=Susan|last2=Miller|first2=Gary L.|title=Solvability by radicals is in polynomial time|journal=Journal of Computer and System Sciences|volume=30|issue=2|pages=179‚Äì208|year=1985|doi=10.1016/0022-0000(85)90013-3|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; that every value of the expression obtained by choosing values of the radicals (for example, signs of square roots) is a primitive {{mvar|n}}th root of unity. This was already shown by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] in 1797.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gauss|first=Carl F.|authorlink=Carl Friedrich Gauss|title=Disquisitiones Arithmeticae|pages=¬ß¬ß359‚Äì360|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1965|isbn=0-300-09473-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efficient [[algorithm]]s exist for calculating such expressions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weber|first=Andreas|last2=Keckeisen|first2=Michael|title=Solving Cyclotomic Polynomials by Radical Expressions|url=http://cg.cs.uni-bonn.de/personal-pages/weber/publications/pdf/WeberA/WeberKeckeisen99a.pdf|accessdate=2007-06-22|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cyclic groups==
The {{mvar|n}}th roots of unity form under multiplication a [[cyclic group]] of [[order (group theory)|order]] {{mvar|n}}, and in fact these groups comprise all of the finite subgroups of the [[multiplicative group]] of the complex number field.  A [[Generating set of a group|generator]] for this cyclic group is a primitive {{mvar|n}}th root of unity.

The {{mvar|n}}th roots of unity form an irreducible [[group representation|representation]] of any cyclic group of order {{mvar|n}}. The orthogonality relationship also follows from group-theoretic principles as described in [[character group]].

The roots of unity appear as entries of the [[eigenvector]]s of any [[circulant matrix]], i.e. matrices that are invariant under cyclic shifts, a fact that also follows from group representation theory as a variant of [[Bloch wave|Bloch's theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;T. Inui, Y. Tanabe, and Y. Onodera, ''Group Theory and Its Applications in Physics'' (Springer, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, if a circulant  [[Hermitian matrix]] is considered (for example, a discretized one-dimensional [[Laplacian]] with periodic boundaries&lt;ref&gt;[[Gilbert Strang]], "[http://epubs.siam.org/sam-bin/dbq/article/33674 The discrete cosine transform]," ''SIAM Review'' '''41''' (1), 135‚Äì147 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;), the orthogonality property immediately follows from the usual orthogonality of eigenvectors of Hermitian matrices.

==Cyclotomic fields==
{{Main|Cyclotomic field}}
By adjoining a primitive {{mvar|n}}th root of unity to '''Q''', one obtains the {{mvar|n}}th [[cyclotomic field]] {{math|'''Q'''(exp(2œÄ''i''/''n''))}}. This [[field (mathematics)|field]] contains all {{mvar|n}}th roots of unity and is the [[splitting field]] of the {{mvar|n}}th cyclotomic polynomial over '''Q'''. The [[field extension]] {{math|'''Q'''(exp(2œÄ''i''/''n''))/'''Q'''}} has degree œÜ(''n'') and its [[Galois group]] is [[Natural transformation|naturally]] [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the multiplicative group of units of the ring {{math|'''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''}}.

As the Galois group of {{math|'''Q'''(exp(2œÄ''i''/''n''))/'''Q'''}} is abelian, this is an [[abelian extension]]. Every subfield of a cyclotomic field is an abelian extension of the rationals. It follows that every ''n''th root of unity may be expressed in term of ''k''-roots, with various ''k'' not exceeding ''œÜ(n)''. In these cases [[Galois theory]] can be written out explicitly in terms of [[Gaussian period]]s: this theory from the ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'' of [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] was published many years before Galois.&lt;ref&gt;The ''Disquisitiones'' was published in 1801, [[√âvariste Galois|Galois]] was born in 1811, died in 1832, but wasn't published until 1846.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, ''every'' abelian extension of the rationals is such a subfield of a cyclotomic field ‚Äì this is the content of a theorem of [[Leopold Kronecker|Kronecker]], usually called the ''[[Kronecker‚ÄìWeber theorem]]'' on the grounds that Weber completed the proof.

==Relation to quadratic integers==
[[Image:Roots of unity, golden ratio.svg|thumb|right|In the [[complex plane]], the red points are the fifth roots of unity, and the blue points are the sums of a fifth root of unity and its complex conjugate.]]
[[Image:Star polygon 8-2.svg|thumb|right|160px|In the [[complex plane]], the corners of the two squares are the eighth roots of unity]]&lt;!-- a better image needed --&gt;
For {{math|1=''n'' = 1, 2}}, both roots of unity {{num|1}} and {{num|‚àí1}} belong to [[integer|{{math|'''Z'''}}]]. 

For three values of {{mvar|n}}, the roots of unity are [[quadratic integer]]s:
* For {{math|1=''n'' = 3, 6}} they are [[Eisenstein integer]]s ({{math|1=[[discriminant|''D'']] = ‚àí3}}).
* For {{math|1=''n'' = 4}} they are [[Gaussian integer]]s ({{math|1=''D'' = ‚àí1}}): see [[imaginary unit]].

For four other values of {{mvar|n}}, the primitive roots of unity are not quadratic integers, but the sum of any root of unity with its [[complex conjugate]] (also an {{mvar|n}}th root of unity) is a quadratic integer.

For {{math|1=''n'' = 5, 10}}, none of the non-real roots of unity (which satisfy a [[quartic equation]]) is a quadratic integer, but the sum {{math|1=''z'' + ''{{overline|z}}'' = 2‚Äâ[[real part|Re]]''z''}} of each root with its complex conjugate (also a 5th root of unity) is an element of the [[ring (algebra)|ring]] [[quadratic integer|'''Z'''[{{sfrac|1 + {{sqrt|5}}|2}}]]] ({{math|1=''D'' = 5}}). For two pairs of non-real 5th roots of unity these sums are [[multiplicative inverse|inverse]] [[golden ratio]] and [[additive inverse|minus]] golden ratio.

For {{math|1=''n'' = 8}}, for any root of unity  {{math|''z'' + ''{{overline|z}}''}} equals to either 0, ¬±2, or ¬±[[square root of 2|{{sqrt|2}}]] ({{math|1=''D'' = 2}}).

For {{math|1=''n'' = 12}}, for any root of unity,  {{math|''z'' + ''{{overline|z}}''}} equals to either 0, ¬±1, ¬±2 or ¬±[[square root of 3|{{sqrt|3}}]] ({{math|1=''D'' = 3}}).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10367">{{Transformation rules}}

In [[logic]], a '''rule of inference''', '''inference rule''' or '''transformation rule''' is a [[logical form]] consisting of a function which takes premises, analyzes their [[Syntax (logic)|syntax]], and returns a conclusion (or [[multiple-conclusion logic|conclusions]]). For example, the rule of inference called ''[[modus ponens]]'' takes two premises, one in the form "If p then q" and another in the form "p", and returns the conclusion "q". The rule is valid with respect to the semantics of [[classical logic]] (as well as the semantics of many other [[non-classical logic]]s), in the sense that if the premises are true (under an interpretation), then so is the conclusion.

Typically, a rule of inference preserves truth, a semantic property. In [[many-valued logic]], it preserves a general designation. But a rule of inference's action is purely syntactic, and does not need to preserve any semantic property: any function from sets of formulae to formulae counts as a rule of inference. Usually only rules that are [[Recursion|recursive]] are important; i.e. rules such that there is an [[effective procedure]] for determining whether any given formula is the conclusion of a given set of formulae according to the rule. An example of a rule that is not effective in this sense is the infinitary [[œâ-consistent theory|œâ-rule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Boolos | first1 = George | last2 = Burgess | first2 = John | last3 = Jeffrey | first3 = Richard C. | title = Computability and logic | year = 2007 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge  | isbn = 0-521-87752-0 | page = 364 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular rules of inference in [[propositional logic]] include ''[[modus ponens]]'', ''[[modus tollens]]'', and [[contraposition]]. First-order [[predicate logic]] uses rules of inference to deal with [[logical quantifier]]s.

==The standard form of rules of inference==
In [[formal logic]] (and many related areas), rules of inference are usually given in the following standard form:

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Premise#1
&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Premise#2
&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''...'''
&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Premise#n &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Conclusion

This expression states that whenever in the course of some logical derivation the given premises have been obtained, the specified conclusion can be taken for granted as well. The exact formal language that is used to describe both premises and conclusions depends on the actual context of the derivations. In a simple case, one may use logical formulae, such as in:

: &lt;math&gt;A \to B&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{A \quad \quad \quad}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;B\!&lt;/math&gt;

This is the ''[[modus ponens]]'' rule of [[propositional logic]]. Rules of inference are often formulated as [[schema (logic)|schemata]] employing [[metavariable]]s.&lt;ref name="Reynolds2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=John C. Reynolds|title=Theories of Programming Languages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2OwlTC4SOccC&amp;pg=PA12|year=2009|origyear=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-10697-9|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the rule (schema) above, the metavariables A and B can be instantiated to any element of the universe (or sometimes, by convention, a restricted subset such as [[proposition]]s) to form an [[infinite set]] of inference rules.

A proof system is formed from a set of rules chained together to form proofs, also called ''derivations''. Any derivation has only one final conclusion, which is the statement proved or derived. If premises are left unsatisfied in the derivation, then the derivation is a proof of a ''hypothetical'' statement: "''if'' the premises hold, ''then'' the conclusion holds."

== Example: Hilbert systems for two propositional logics ==
In a [[Hilbert system]], the premises and conclusion of the inference rules are simply formulae of some language, usually employing metavariables. For graphical compactness of the presentation and to emphasize the distinction between axioms and rules of inference, this section uses the sequent notation (&lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt;) instead of a vertical presentation of rules.

The formal language for classical [[propositional logic]] can be expressed using just negation (¬¨), implication (‚Üí) and propositional symbols. A well-known axiomatization, comprising three axiom schemata and one inference rule (''modus ponens''), is:

 (CA1) ‚ä¢ ''A'' ‚Üí (''B'' ‚Üí ''A'')&lt;br/&gt;
 (CA2) ‚ä¢ (''A'' ‚Üí (''B'' ‚Üí ''C'')) ‚Üí ((''A'' ‚Üí ''B'') ‚Üí (''A'' ‚Üí ''C''))&lt;br/&gt;
 (CA3) ‚ä¢ (¬¨''A'' ‚Üí ¬¨''B'') ‚Üí (''B'' ‚Üí ''A'')&lt;br/&gt;
 (MP)  ''A'', ''A'' ‚Üí ''B'' ‚ä¢ ''B''

It may seem redundant to have two notions of inference in this case, ‚ä¢ and ‚Üí. In classical propositional logic, they indeed coincide; the [[deduction theorem]] states that ''A'' ‚ä¢ ''B'' if and only if ‚ä¢ ''A'' ‚Üí ''B''. There is however a distinction worth emphasizing even in this case: the first notation describes a [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]], that is an activity of passing from sentences to sentences, whereas ''A'' ‚Üí ''B'' is simply a formula made with a [[logical connective]], implication in this case. Without an inference rule (like ''modus ponens'' in this case), there is no deduction or inference. This point is illustrated in [[Lewis Carroll]]'s dialogue called "[[What the Tortoise Said to Achilles]]" &lt;ref name="ChiaraDoets1996"&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Maria Luisa Dalla Chiara |editor2=Kees Doets |editor3=Daniele Mundici |editor4=Johan van Benthem |title=Logic and Scientific Methods: Volume One of the Tenth International Congress of Logic, Methodology and Philosophy of Science, Florence, August 1995|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TCthvF8xLIAC&amp;pg=PA290|year=1996|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-7923-4383-7|page=290|chapter=Logical consequence: a turn in style|author=Kosta Dosen}} [http://www.mi.sanu.ac.rs/~kosta/LOGCONS.pdf preprint (with different pagination)]&lt;/ref&gt;, as well as later attempts by [[What_the_Tortoise_Said_to_Achilles#Discussion|Bertrand Russel and Peter Winch]] to resolve the paradox introduced in the dialogue.
 
For some non-classical logics, the deduction theorem does not hold. For example, the [[three-valued logic]] of [[Jan ≈Åukasiewicz|≈Åukasiewicz]] can be axiomatized as:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Merrie |last=Bergmann|title=An introduction to many-valued and fuzzy logic: semantics, algebras, and derivation systems|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-88128-9|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 (CA1) ‚ä¢ ''A'' ‚Üí (''B'' ‚Üí ''A'')&lt;br/&gt;
 (LA2) ‚ä¢ (''A'' ‚Üí ''B'') ‚Üí ((''B'' ‚Üí ''C'') ‚Üí (''A'' ‚Üí ''C''))&lt;br/&gt;
 (CA3) ‚ä¢ (¬¨''A'' ‚Üí ¬¨''B'') ‚Üí (''B'' ‚Üí ''A'')&lt;br/&gt;
 (LA4) ‚ä¢ ((''A'' ‚Üí ¬¨''A'') ‚Üí ''A'') ‚Üí ''A''&lt;br/&gt;
 (MP)  ''A'', ''A'' ‚Üí ''B'' ‚ä¢ ''B''

This sequence differs from classical logic by the change in axiom 2 and the addition of axiom 4. The classical deduction theorem does not hold for this logic, however a modified form does hold, namely ''A'' ‚ä¢ ''B'' if and only if ‚ä¢ ''A'' ‚Üí (''A'' ‚Üí ''B'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Merrie |last=Bergmann|title=An introduction to many-valued and fuzzy logic: semantics, algebras, and derivation systems|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-88128-9|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Admissibility and derivability==
{{main|Admissible rule}}
In a set of rules, an inference rule could be redundant in the sense that it is ''admissible'' or ''derivable''. A derivable rule is one whose conclusion can be derived from its premises using the other rules. An admissible rule is one whose conclusion holds whenever the premises hold. All derivable rules are admissible. To appreciate the difference, consider the following set of rules for defining the [[natural number]]s (the [[natural deduction|judgment]] &lt;math&gt;n\,\,\mathsf{nat}&lt;/math&gt; asserts the fact that &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is a natural number):

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
\frac{}{\mathbf{0} \,\,\mathsf{nat}} &amp;
\frac{n \,\,\mathsf{nat}}{\mathbf{s(}n\mathbf{)} \,\,\mathsf{nat}} \\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

The first rule states that '''0''' is a natural number, and the second states that '''s(n)''' is a natural number if ''n'' is. In this proof system, the following rule, demonstrating that the second successor of a natural number is also a natural number, is derivable:

: &lt;math&gt;
\frac{n \,\,\mathsf{nat}}{\mathbf{s(s(}n\mathbf{))} \,\,\mathsf{nat}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Its derivation is the composition of two uses of the successor rule above. The following rule for asserting the existence of a predecessor for any nonzero number is merely admissible:

: &lt;math&gt;
\frac{\mathbf{s(}n\mathbf{)} \,\,\mathsf{nat}}{n \,\,\mathsf{nat}}
&lt;/math&gt;

This is a true fact of natural numbers, as can be proven by [[Mathematical induction|induction]]. (To prove that this rule is admissible, assume a derivation of the premise and induct on it to produce a derivation of &lt;math&gt;n \,\,\mathsf{nat}&lt;/math&gt;.) However, it is not derivable, because it depends on the structure of the derivation of the premise. Because of this, derivability is stable under additions to the proof system, whereas admissibility is not. To see the difference, suppose the following nonsense rule were added to the proof system:

: &lt;math&gt;
\frac{}{\mathbf{s(-3)} \,\,\mathsf{nat}}
&lt;/math&gt;

In this new system, the double-successor rule is still derivable. However, the rule for finding the predecessor is no longer admissible, because there is no way to derive &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{-3} \,\,\mathsf{nat}&lt;/math&gt;. The brittleness of admissibility comes from the way it is proved: since the proof can induct on the structure of the derivations of the premises, extensions to the system add new cases to this proof, which may no longer hold.

Admissible rules can be thought of as [[theorem]]s of a proof system. For instance, in a [[sequent calculus]] where [[cut elimination]] holds, the ''cut'' rule is admissible.

The nonzero off-diagonal components of the metric tensor are a direct result of the non-orthogonality of the basis vectors of the coordinates, since by definition:&lt;ref name=p13&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;g_{i j} = \mathbf e_i \cdot \mathbf e_j&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;g_{i j}&lt;/math&gt; is the metric tensor and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf e_i&lt;/math&gt; the (covariant) [[basis vector]]s.

These coordinate systems can be useful if the geometry of a problem fits well into a skewed system. For example, solving [[Laplace's equation]] in a [[parallelogram]] will be easiest when done in appropriately skewed coordinates.

==Cartesian coordinates with one skewed axis==

[[Image:SkewCartesianSystem.svg|thumb|right|A coordinate system where the ''x'' axis has been bent toward the ''z'' axis.]]

The simplest 3D case of a skew coordinate system is a [[Cartesian coordinates|Cartesian]] one where one of the axes (say the ''x'' axis) has been bent by some angle &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, staying orthogonal to one of the remaining two axes. For this example, the ''x'' axis of a Cartesian coordinate has been bent toward the ''z'' axis by &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, remaining orthogonal to the ''y'' axis.

===Algebra and useful quantities===

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf e_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf e_2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf e_3&lt;/math&gt; respectively be unit vectors along the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; axes. These represent the [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant]] basis; computing their dot products gives the following components of the [[metric tensor]]:

:&lt;math&gt;g_{11} = g_{22} = g_{33} = 1 \quad ; \quad g_{12} = g_{23} = 0 \quad ; \quad g_{13} = \cos\left(\frac \pi 2 - \phi\right) = \sin(\phi)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{g} = \mathbf e_1 \cdot (\mathbf e_2 \times \mathbf e_3) = \cos(\phi)&lt;/math&gt;

which are quantities that will be useful later on.

The contravariant basis is given by&lt;ref name=p13/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf e^1 = \frac{\mathbf e_2 \times \mathbf e_3}{\sqrt{g}} = \frac{\mathbf e_2 \times \mathbf e_3}{\cos(\phi)}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf e^2 = \frac{\mathbf e_3 \times \mathbf e_1}{\sqrt{g}} = \mathbf e_2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf e^3 = \frac{\mathbf e_1 \times \mathbf e_2}{\sqrt{g}} = \frac{\mathbf e_1 \times \mathbf e_2}{\cos(\phi)}&lt;/math&gt;

The contravariant basis isn't a very convenient one to use, however it shows up in definitions so must be considered. We'll favor writing quantities with respect to the covariant basis.

Since the basis vectors are all constant, vector addition and subtraction will simply be familiar component-wise adding and subtraction. Now, let

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf a = \sum_i a^i \mathbf e_i \quad \mbox{and} \quad \mathbf b = \sum_i b^i \mathbf e_i&lt;/math&gt;

where the sums indicate summation over all values of the index (in this case, ''i'' = 1, 2, 3). The [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant and covariant]] components of these vectors may be related by

:&lt;math&gt;a^i = \sum_j a_j g^{ij}&lt;/math&gt;

so that, explicitly,

:&lt;math&gt;a^1 = \frac{a_1 - \sin(\phi) a_3}{\cos^2(\phi)},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;a^2 = a_2,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;a^3 = \frac{-\sin(\phi) a_1 + a_3}{\cos^2(\phi)}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[dot product]] in terms of contravariant components is then

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf a \cdot \mathbf b = \sum_i a^i b_i = a^1 b^1 + a^2 b^2 + a^3 b^3 + \sin(\phi) (a^1 b^3 + a^3 b^1)&lt;/math&gt;

and in terms of covariant components

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf a \cdot \mathbf b = \cos^2(\phi) [ a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 + a_3 b_3 - \sin(\phi) (a_1 b_3 + a_3 b_1) ].&lt;/math&gt;

===Calculus===

&lt;/ref&gt; the [[gradient]] of a scalar function ''f'' is

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla f = \sum_i \mathbf e^i \frac{\partial f}{\partial q^i} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \mathbf e^1 + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \mathbf e^2 + \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} \mathbf e^3&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; are the coordinates ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' indexed. Recognizing this as a vector written in terms of the contravariant basis, it may be rewritten:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla f = 
\frac{\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} - \sin(\phi) \frac{\partial f}{\partial z}}{\cos(\phi)^2} \mathbf e_1 + 
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \mathbf e_2 + 
\frac{-\sin(\phi) \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial z}}{\cos(\phi)^2} \mathbf e_3.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[divergence]] of a vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf a&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf a = \frac{1}{\sqrt{g}} \sum_i \frac{\partial}{\partial q^i}\left(\sqrt{g} a^i\right) = \frac{\partial a^1}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial a^2}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial a^3}{\partial z}.&lt;/math&gt;

and of a tensor &lt;math&gt;\mathbf A&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{g}} \sum_{i, j} \frac{\partial}{\partial q^i}\left(\sqrt{g} a^{ij} \mathbf e_j\right) = 
\sum_{i, j} \mathbf e_j \frac{\partial a^{ij}}{\partial q^i}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Laplacian]] of ''f'' is

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 f = \nabla \cdot \nabla f = 
\frac{1}{\cos(\phi)^2}\left(\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial z^2} - 2 \sin(\phi) \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial z}\right) + \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2}&lt;/math&gt;

and, since the covariant basis is normal and constant, the [[vector Laplacian]] is the same as the componentwise Laplacian of a vector written in terms of the covariant basis.

While both the dot product and gradient are somewhat messy in that they have extra terms (compared to a Cartesian system) the [[advection|advection operator]] which combines a dot product with a gradient turns out very simple:

:&lt;math&gt;(\mathbf a \cdot \nabla) = \left(\sum_i a^i e_i\right) \cdot \left(\sum_i \frac{\partial}{\partial q^i} \mathbf e^i\right) = \left(\sum_i a^i \frac{\partial}{\partial q^i}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

which may be applied to both scalar functions and vector functions, componentwise when expressed in the covariant basis.

Finally, the [[curl (mathematics)|curl]] of a vector is

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf a = \sum_{i, j, k} \mathbf e_k \epsilon^{ijk} \frac{\partial a_i}{\partial q^i} = &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\cos(\phi)}\left(
\left(\sin(\phi) \frac{\partial a^1}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial a^3}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial a^2}{\partial z}\right) \mathbf e_1 + 
\left(\frac{\partial a^1}{\partial z} + \sin(\phi) \left(\frac{\partial a^3}{\partial z} - \frac{\partial a^1}{\partial x}\right) - \frac{\partial a^3}{\partial x}\right) \mathbf e_2 + 
\left(\frac{\partial a^2}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial a^1}{\partial y} - \sin(\phi) \frac{\partial a^3}{\partial y}\right) \mathbf e_3
\right).&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5172">A two dimensional [[Minkowski space]], i.e. a flat space with one time and one spacial dimension, has a two-dimensional [[Poincar√© group#Other dimensions|Poincar√© group]] IO(1,1) as its [[Spacetime symmetries|symmetry group]]. The respective [[Lie algebra]] is called the [[Poincar√© group#Poincar.C3.A9 algebra|Poincar√© algebra]]. It is possible to extend this algebra to a [[supersymmetry algebra]], which is a &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_2&lt;/math&gt;-graded [[Lie superalgebra]]. The most common ways to do this are discussed below.

== &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N} = (2,2)
&lt;/math&gt; algebra ==
Let the Lie algebra of IO(1,1) be generated by the following generators:
* &lt;math&gt;H = P_0
&lt;/math&gt; is the generator of the time translation,
* &lt;math&gt;P = P_1
&lt;/math&gt; is the generator of the space translation,
* &lt;math&gt;M = M_{01}&lt;/math&gt; is the generator of [[Lorentz transformation|Lorentz boosts]]. 
For the commutators between these generators, see [[Poincar√© group#Poincar.C3.A9 algebra|Poincar√© algebra]].

The &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}=(2,2)&lt;/math&gt; supersymmetry algebra over this space is a [[Lie algebra extension|supersymmetric extension]] of this Lie algebra with the four additional generators ([[Supercharge|supercharges]]) &lt;math&gt;Q_+, \, Q_-, \, \overline{Q}_+, \, \overline{Q}_-&lt;/math&gt;, which are odd elements of the Lie superalgebra. Under Lorentz transformations the generators &lt;math&gt;Q_+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{Q}_+&lt;/math&gt; transform as left-handed [[Weyl equation#Weyl spinors|Weyl spinors]], while &lt;math&gt;Q_-&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{Q}_-&lt;/math&gt; transform as right-handed Weyl spinors. The algebra is given by the Poincar√© algebra plus&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/52374327|title=Mirror symmetry|date=2003|publisher=American Mathematical Society|others=Hori, Kentaro.|isbn=9780821829554|location=Providence, RI|oclc=52374327}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|283}}

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp;\begin{align}
&amp;Q_+^2 = Q_{-}^2 = \overline{Q}_+^2 = \overline{Q}_-^2 =0, \\
&amp;\{ Q_{\pm}, \overline{Q}_{\pm} \} = H \pm P, \\
\end{align} \\
&amp;\begin{align}
&amp;\{\overline{Q}_+, \overline{Q}_- \} = Z, &amp;&amp; \{Q_+, Q_- \} = Z^*, \\
&amp;\{Q_-, \overline{Q}_+ \} =\tilde{Z}, &amp;&amp; \{Q_+, \overline{Q}_-\} = \tilde{Z}^*,\\
&amp;{[iM, Q_{\pm}]} = \mp Q_{\pm}, &amp;&amp; {[iM, \overline{Q}_{\pm}]} = \mp \overline{Q}_{\pm},
\end{align}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where all remaining commutators vanish, and &lt;math&gt;Z
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tilde{Z}
&lt;/math&gt; are complex [[Central charge|central charges]]. The supercharges are related via &lt;math&gt;Q_{\pm}^\dagger = \overline{Q}_\pm
&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;H
&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P
&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; are [[Hermitian matrix|Hermitian]].

==  Subalgebras of the &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N} = (2,2)
&lt;/math&gt; algebra ==

=== The &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N} = (0,2)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N} = (2,0)&lt;/math&gt; subalgebras ===
The &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N} = (0,2)&lt;/math&gt; subalgebra is obtained from the &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N} = (2,2)
&lt;/math&gt; algebra by removing the generators  &lt;math&gt;Q_-&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{Q}_-&lt;/math&gt;. Thus its anti-commutation relations are given by&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|289}}

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp;Q_+^2 = \overline{Q}_+^2 = 0, \\
&amp;\{ Q_{+}, \overline{Q}_{+} \} = H + P \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

plus the commutation relations above that do not involve &lt;math&gt;Q_-&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\overline{Q}_-&lt;/math&gt;. Both generators are left-handed Weyl spinors.

Similarly, the &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N} = (2,0)&lt;/math&gt; subalgebra is obtained by removing &lt;math&gt;Q_+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{Q}_+&lt;/math&gt; and fulfills

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp;Q_-^2 = \overline{Q}_-^2 = 0, \\
&amp;\{ Q_{-}, \overline{Q}_{-} \} = H - P. \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Both supercharge generators are right-handed.

=== The &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N} = (1,1)&lt;/math&gt; subalgebra ===
The &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N} = (1,1)&lt;/math&gt; subalgebra is generated by two generators &lt;math&gt;Q_+^1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q_-^1&lt;/math&gt; given by

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
Q^1_{\pm} = e^{i \nu_{\pm}} Q_{\pm} + e^{-i \nu_{\pm}} \overline{Q}_{\pm}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;for two real numbers &lt;math&gt;\nu_+&lt;/math&gt;and &lt;math&gt;\nu_-&lt;/math&gt;.

By definition, both supercharges are real, i.e. &lt;math&gt;(Q_{\pm}^1)^\dagger = Q^1_\pm
&lt;/math&gt;. They transform as [[Spinor#Terminology_in_physics|Majorana-Weyl spinors]] under Lorentz transformations. Their anti-commutation relations are given by&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|287}}

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp;\{ Q^1_{\pm}, Q^1_{\pm} \} = 2 (H \pm P), \\
&amp;\{ Q^1_{+}, Q^1_{-} \} = Z^1,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Z^1&lt;/math&gt; is a real central charge.

=== The &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N} = (0,1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N} = (1,0)&lt;/math&gt; subalgebras ===
These algebras can be obtained from the &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N} = (1,1)&lt;/math&gt; subalgebra by removing &lt;math&gt;Q_-^1&lt;/math&gt; resp. &lt;math&gt;Q_+^1&lt;/math&gt;from the generators.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3823">In the context of [[molecular symmetry]], a '''symmetry operation''' is a [[permutation]] of atoms such that the [[molecule]] or [[crystal]] is transformed into a state indistinguishable from the starting state.
Two basic facts follow from this definition, which emphasize its usefulness.
# Physical properties must be [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]] with respect to symmetry operations.
# Symmetry operations can be collected together in groups which are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to [[permutation groups]].
Wavefunctions need not be invariant, because the operation can multiply them by a phase or mix states within a degenerate representation, without affecting any physical property.

== Molecules ==

=== Proper rotation operations ===

These are denoted by ''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;''  and are rotations of 360¬∞/''n'', performed ''m'' times. The superscript ''m'' is omitted if it is equal to one.

''C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', rotation by 360¬∞, is called the Identity operation and is denoted by ''E'' or ''I''.

''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'', ''n'' rotations 360¬∞/''n'' is also an Identity operation.

=== Improper rotation operations ===

These are denoted by ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'' and are rotations of 360¬∞/''n'' followed by reflection in a plane perpendicular to the rotation axis.

''S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is usually denoted as œÉ, a reflection operation about a mirror plane.

''S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' is usually denoted as ''i'', an inversion operation about an inversion centre.

When ''n'' is an even number ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' = ''E'', but when ''n'' is odd ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2n&lt;/sup&gt;''  = ''E''.

Rotation axes, mirror planes and inversion centres are  [[Symmetry_element|symmetry elements]], not operations. The rotation axis of highest order is known as the principal rotation axis. It is conventional to set the Cartesian ''z'' axis of the molecule to contain the principal rotation axis.

=== Examples ===

[[Image:Methylene Chloride.PNG|100px|left]]Dichloromethane, CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. There is a ''C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' rotation axis which passes through the carbon atom and the midpoints between the two hydrogen atoms and the two chlorine atoms. Define the [[z axis]] as [[Line (mathematics)|co-linear]] with the ''C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' axis, the ''xz'' plane  as containing CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the  ''yz'' plane as containing CCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. A ''C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' rotation operation permutes the two hydrogen atoms  and the two chlorine atoms. Reflection in the ''yz'' plane permutes the hydrogen atoms while reflection in the ''xz'' plane permutes the chlorine atoms. The four symmetry operations ''E'', ''C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', œÉ(''xz'')and œÉ(''yz'')  form the [[Point groups in three dimensions|point group]] C&lt;sub&gt;2v&lt;/sub&gt;. Note that if any two operations are carried out in succession the result is the same as if a single operation of the group had been performed.
[[Image:Methane-2D-stereo.svg|100px|left]]Methane, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. In addition to the proper rotations of order 2 and 3 there are three mutually perpendicular ''S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;'' axes which pass half-way between the C-H bonds and six mirror planes. Note that ''S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''  = ''C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''.

== Crystals ==

In crystals '''screw rotations''' and/or '''glide reflections''' are additionally possible. These are rotations or reflections together with partial translation. The [[Bravais lattices]] may be considered as representing '''translational''' symmetry operations. Combinations of operations of the [[crystallographic point groups]] with the addition symmetry operations produce the 230 crystallographic [[space groups]].

{{stack|{{Binary relations}}}}
In [[mathematics]], a '''linear order''', '''total order''', '''simple order''', or '''(non-strict) ordering'''  is a [[binary relation]] on some [[Set (mathematics)|set]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, which is [[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]], [[transitive relation|transitive]], and a [[connex relation]]. A set paired with a total order is called a '''totally ordered set''', a '''linearly ordered set''', a '''simply ordered set''', or a '''chain'''.

Formally, a binary relation &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt; is a total order on a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; if the following statements hold for all &lt;math&gt;a, b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;:

: If &lt;math&gt;a \leq b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b \leq a&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;a = b&lt;/math&gt; ([[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetry]]);
: If &lt;math&gt;a \leq b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b \leq c&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;a \leq c&lt;/math&gt;  ([[transitive relation|transitivity]]);
: &lt;math&gt;a \leq b&lt;/math&gt; [[logical disjunction|or]] &lt;math&gt;b \leq a&lt;/math&gt; ([[connex relation|connex property]]).

Antisymmetry eliminates uncertain cases when both &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; precedes &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; precedes &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nederpelt |first=Rob  |title=Logical Reasoning: A First Course |publisher=King's College Publications|year=2004| series=Texts in Computing|volume=3|edition=3rd, Revised |page=325 |chapter=Chapter 20.2: Ordered Sets. Orderings|isbn=0-9543006-7-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; A relation having the "connex" property means that any pair of elements in the set of the relation are [[Comparability|comparable]] under the relation. This also means that the set can be diagrammed as a line of elements, giving it the name ''linear''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nederpelt |first=Rob  |title=Logical Reasoning: A First Course |publisher=King's College Publications|year=2004| series=Texts in Computing|volume=3|edition=3rd, Revisied |page=330 |chapter=Chapter 20.3: Ordered Sets. Linear orderings|isbn=0-9543006-7-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''connex'' property also implies [[reflexive relation|reflexivity]], i.e., ''a'' ‚â§ ''a''. Therefore, a total order is also a (special case of a) [[partial order]], as, for a partial order, the connex property is replaced by the weaker reflexivity property. An extension of a given partial order to a total order is called a [[linear extension]] of that partial order.

==Strict total order==
For each (non-strict) total order ‚â§ there is an associated [[asymmetric relation|asymmetric]] (hence irreflexive) relation &lt;, called a '''strict total order''', which can be defined in two equivalent ways:
*''a'' &lt; ''b'' if ''a'' ‚â§ ''b'' and ''a'' ‚â† ''b''
*''a'' &lt; ''b'' if not ''b'' ‚â§ ''a'' (i.e., &lt; is the [[Binary relation#Operations on binary relations|inverse]] of the [[Binary relation#Complement|complement]] of ‚â§)

Properties:
*The relation is transitive: ''a'' &lt; ''b'' and ''b'' &lt; ''c'' implies ''a'' &lt; ''c''.
*The relation is [[Trichotomy (mathematics)|trichotomous]]: exactly one of ''a'' &lt; ''b'', ''b'' &lt; ''a'' and ''a'' = ''b'' is true.
*The relation is a [[strict weak order]], where the associated equivalence is equality.

We can work the other way and start by choosing &lt; as a transitive trichotomous binary relation; then a total order ‚â§ can be defined in two equivalent ways:
*''a'' ‚â§ ''b'' if ''a'' &lt; ''b'' or ''a'' = ''b''
*''a'' ‚â§ ''b'' if not ''b'' &lt; ''a''

Two more associated orders are the complements ‚â• and &gt;, completing the [[Tuple|quadruple]] {&lt;, &gt;, ‚â§, ‚â•}.

We can define or explain the way a set is totally ordered by any of these four relations; the notation implies whether we are talking about the non-strict or the strict total order.

==Examples==

* The letters of the alphabet ordered by the standard [[Alphabetical order|dictionary order]], e.g., {{math|''A'' &lt; ''B'' &lt; ''C''}} etc.
* Any subset of a totally ordered set {{math|''X''}} is totally ordered for the restriction of the order on {{math|''X''}}. 
* The unique order on the empty set, {{math|‚àÖ}}, is a total order.
* Any set of [[cardinal number]]s or  [[ordinal number]]s (more strongly, these are [[well-order]]s).
* If {{math|''X''}} is any set and {{math|''f''}}{{math|}} an [[injective function]] from {{math|''X''}} to a totally ordered set then {{math|''f''}} induces a total ordering on {{math|''X''}} by setting {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} if and only if {{math|''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) &lt; ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}}.
* The [[lexicographical order]] on the [[Cartesian product]] of a family of totally ordered sets, [[Index set|indexed]] by a [[well-order|well ordered set]], is itself a total order.  
* The set of ''[[real numbers]]'' ordered by the usual less than ({{math|&lt;}}) or greater than ({{math|&gt;}}) relations is totally ordered, hence also the subsets of ''[[natural numbers]]'', ''[[integers]]'', and ''[[rational numbers]]''. Each of these can be shown to be the unique (to within [[isomorphism]]) ''smallest'' example of a totally ordered set with a certain property, (a total order {{math|''A''}} is the ''smallest'' with a certain property if whenever {{math|''B''}} has the property, there is an order isomorphism from {{math|''A''}} to a subset of {{math|''B''}}):
**The ''natural numbers'' comprise the smallest totally ordered set with no [[upper bound]].
**The ''integers'' comprise the smallest totally ordered set with neither an upper nor a [[lower bound]].
**The ''rational numbers'' comprise the smallest totally ordered set which is ''[[dense order|dense]]'' in the real numbers. The definition of density used here says that for every {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} in the real numbers such that {{math|''a'' &lt; ''b''}}, there is a {{math|''q''}} in the rational numbers such that {{math|''a'' &lt; ''q'' &lt; ''b''}}.
**The ''real numbers'' comprise the smallest unbounded totally ordered set that is [[connectedness|connected]] in the order topology (defined below).
* [[Ordered field]]s are totally ordered by definition. They include the rational numbers and the real numbers. Every ordered field contains an ordered subfield that is isomorphic to the rational numbers. Any [[Dedekind-complete]] ordered field is isomorphic to the real numbers.

==Further concepts==

===Chains===
While '''chain''' is sometimes merely a synonym for totally ordered set, it can also refer to a totally ordered [[subset]] of some [[partially ordered set]]. The latter definition has a crucial role in [[Zorn's lemma]].
The '''height''' of a poset denotes the cardinality of its largest chain in this sense.

For example, consider the set of all subsets of the [[integer]]s [[partially ordered]] by [[Subset|inclusion]]. Then the set { ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''n'' is a [[natural number]]}, where ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the set of natural numbers below ''n'', is a chain in this ordering, as it is totally ordered under inclusion:  If ''n''&amp;le;''k'', then ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is a subset of ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;.

===Lattice theory===
One may define a totally ordered set as a particular kind of [[lattice (order)|lattice]], namely one in which we have

: &lt;math&gt;\{a\vee b, a\wedge b\} = \{a, b\}&lt;/math&gt; for all ''a'', ''b''.

We then write ''a'' ‚â§ ''b'' [[if and only if]] &lt;math&gt;a = a\wedge b&lt;/math&gt;. Hence a totally ordered set is a [[distributive lattice]].

===Finite total orders===
A simple [[counting]] argument will verify that any non-empty finite totally ordered set (and hence any non-empty subset thereof) has a least element. Thus every finite total order is in fact a [[well order]].  Either by direct proof or by observing that every well order is [[order isomorphic]] to an [[Ordinal number|ordinal]] one may show that every finite total order is [[order isomorphic]] to an [[initial segment]] of the natural numbers ordered by &lt;. In other words, a total order on a set with ''k'' elements induces a bijection with the first ''k'' natural numbers. Hence it is common to index finite total orders or well orders with [[order type]] &amp;omega; by natural numbers in a fashion which respects the ordering (either starting with zero or with one).

===Category theory===
Totally ordered sets form a [[subcategory|full subcategory]] of the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of [[partially ordered set]]s, with the [[morphism]]s being maps which respect the orders, i.e. maps ''f'' such that if ''a'' ‚â§ ''b'' then ''f''(''a'') ‚â§ ''f''(''b'').

A [[bijection|bijective]] [[map (mathematics)|map]] between two totally ordered sets that respects the two orders is an [[isomorphism]] in this category.

===Order topology===

For any totally ordered set ''X'' we can define the '''[[interval (mathematics)|open interval]]s''' (''a'', ''b'') = {''x'' : ''a'' &lt; ''x'' and ''x'' &lt; ''b''}, (‚àí‚àû, ''b'') = {''x'' : ''x'' &lt; ''b''}, (''a'', ‚àû) = {''x'' : ''a'' &lt; ''x''} and (‚àí‚àû, ‚àû) = ''X''.  We can use these open intervals to define a [[topology]] on any ordered set, the [[order topology]].

When more than one order is being used on a set one talks about the order topology induced by a particular order.  For instance if '''N''' is the natural numbers, &lt; is less than and &gt; greater than we might refer to the order topology on '''N''' induced by &lt; and the order topology on '''N''' induced by &gt; (in this case they happen to be identical but will not in general).

The order topology induced by a total order may be shown to be hereditarily [[Normal space|normal]].

===Completeness===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Completely distributive lattice]]. See [[WP:MOS#Section management]] --&gt;
A totally ordered set is said to be '''complete''' if every nonempty subset that has an [[upper bound]], has a [[least upper bound]]. For example, the set of [[real number]]s '''R''' is complete but the set of [[rational number]]s '''Q''' is not.

There are a number of results relating properties of the order topology to the completeness of X:
*If the order topology on ''X'' is connected, ''X'' is complete.
*''X'' is connected under the order topology if and only if it is complete and there is no ''gap'' in ''X'' (a gap is two points ''a'' and ''b'' in ''X'' with ''a'' &lt; ''b'' such that no ''c'' satisfies ''a'' &lt; ''c'' &lt; ''b''.)
*''X'' is complete if and only if every bounded set that is closed in the order topology is compact.

A totally ordered set (with its order topology) which is a [[complete lattice]] is [[Compact space|compact]]. Examples are the closed intervals of real numbers, e.g. the [[unit interval]] [0,1], and the [[affinely extended real number system]] (extended real number line). There are order-preserving [[homeomorphism]]s between these examples.

===Sums of orders===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Scattered_order]]. See [[WP:MOS#Section management]] --&gt;

For any two disjoint total  orders &lt;math&gt;(A_1,\le_1)&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;(A_2,\le_2)&lt;/math&gt;, there is a natural order &lt;math&gt;\le_+&lt;/math&gt; on the set &lt;math&gt;A_1\cup A_2&lt;/math&gt;, which is called the sum of the two orders or sometimes just &lt;math&gt;A_1+A_2&lt;/math&gt;: 
: For &lt;math&gt;x,y\in A_1\cup A_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x\le_+ y&lt;/math&gt; holds if and only if one of the following holds:
:# &lt;math&gt;x,y\in A_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x\le_1 y&lt;/math&gt;
:# &lt;math&gt;x,y\in A_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x\le_2 y&lt;/math&gt;
:# &lt;math&gt;x\in A_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y\in A_2&lt;/math&gt;
Intutitively, this means that the elements of the second set are added on top of the elements of the first set.

More generally, if &lt;math&gt;(I,\le)&lt;/math&gt; is a totally ordered index set, and for each &lt;math&gt;i\in I&lt;/math&gt; the structure &lt;math&gt;(A_i,\le_i)&lt;/math&gt; is a linear order, where the sets &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; are pairwise disjoint, then the natural total order on &lt;math&gt;\bigcup_i A_i&lt;/math&gt; is defined by 
: For &lt;math&gt;x,y\in \bigcup_{i\in I} A_i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x\le y&lt;/math&gt; holds if: 
:# Either there is some &lt;math&gt;i\in I&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; x\le_i y &lt;/math&gt;
:# or there are  some &lt;math&gt;i&lt;j&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;  with &lt;math&gt; x\in A_i&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt; y\in A_j&lt;/math&gt;

==Orders on the Cartesian product of totally ordered sets==
In order of increasing strength, i.e., decreasing sets of pairs, three of the possible orders on the [[Cartesian product]] of two totally ordered sets are:
*[[Lexicographical order]]: (''a'',''b'') ‚â§ (''c'',''d'') if and only if ''a'' &lt; ''c'' or (''a'' = ''c'' and ''b'' ‚â§ ''d''). This is a total order. 
*(''a'',''b'') ‚â§ (''c'',''d'') if and only if ''a'' ‚â§ ''c'' and ''b'' ‚â§ ''d'' (the [[product order]]). This is a partial order. 
*(''a'',''b'') ‚â§ (''c'',''d'') if and only if (''a'' &lt; ''c'' and ''b'' &lt; ''d'') or (''a'' = ''c'' and ''b'' = ''d'') (the reflexive closure of the [[Direct product#Direct product of binary relations|direct product]] of the corresponding strict total orders). This is also a partial order.

All three can similarly be defined for the Cartesian product of more than two sets.

Applied to the [[vector space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, each of these make it an [[ordered vector space]].

See also [[Partially ordered set#Examples|examples of partially ordered sets]].

A real function of ''n'' real variables defined on a subset of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; [[Strict weak ordering#Function|defines a strict weak order and a corresponding total preorder]] on that subset.

== Related structures==
A binary relation that is antisymmetric, transitive, and reflexive (but not necessarily total) is a [[partial order]].

A [[group (mathematics)|group]] with a compatible total order is a [[totally ordered group]].

There are only a few nontrivial structures that are (interdefinable as) reducts of a total order. Forgetting the orientation results in a [[betweenness relation]]. Forgetting the location of the ends results in a [[cyclic order]]. Forgetting both data results in a [[separation relation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Macpherson |first=H.

The '''Whittaker‚ÄìShannon interpolation formula''' or '''sinc interpolation''' is a method to construct a [[continuous-time]] [[bandlimited]] function from a sequence of real numbers.  The formula dates back to the works of [[E. Borel]] in 1898, and [[E. T. Whittaker]] in 1915, and was cited from works of [[J. M. Whittaker]] in 1935, and in the formulation of the [[Nyquist‚ÄìShannon sampling theorem]] by [[Claude Shannon]] in 1949.  It is also commonly called '''Shannon's interpolation formula''' and '''Whittaker's interpolation formula'''.  E. T. Whittaker, who published it in 1915, called it the '''Cardinal series'''.

==Definition==
[[Image:bandlimited.svg|thumb|right|240px|Fourier transform of a bandlimited function.]]
Given a sequence of real numbers, ''x''[''n''], the continuous function

:&lt;math&gt;x(t) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x[n] \, {\rm sinc}\left(\frac{t - nT}{T}\right)\,&lt;/math&gt;

(where "sinc" denotes the [[normalized sinc function]]) has a [[Fourier transform]], ''X''(''f''), whose non-zero values are confined to the region |''f''|&amp;nbsp;‚â§&amp;nbsp;1/(2''T'').&amp;nbsp;  When parameter ''T'' has units of seconds, the '''bandlimit''', 1/(2''T''), has units of cycles/sec ([[hertz]]).  When the ''x''[''n''] sequence represents time samples, at interval ''T'', of a continuous function, the quantity ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/''T'' is known as the [[sample rate]], and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;/2 is the corresponding [[Nyquist frequency]].  When the sampled function has a bandlimit, ''B'', less than the Nyquist frequency, ''x''(''t'') is a '''perfect reconstruction''' of the original function.  (See [[Sampling theorem]].)  Otherwise, the frequency components above the Nyquist frequency "fold" into the sub-Nyquist region of ''X''(''f''), resulting in distortion.  (See [[Aliasing]].)

==Equivalent formulation: convolution/lowpass filter==
The interpolation formula is derived in the [[Nyquist‚ÄìShannon sampling theorem]] article, which points out that it can also be expressed as the [[convolution]] of an [[Dirac comb|infinite impulse train]] with a [[sinc function]]:

:&lt;math&gt; x(t) = \left( \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x[n]\cdot \delta \left( t - nT \right) \right) * 
{\rm sinc}\left(\frac{t}{T}\right). &lt;/math&gt;

This is equivalent to filtering the impulse train with an ideal (''brick-wall'') [[low-pass filter]].

==Convergence==
The interpolation formula always converges [[absolute convergence|absolutely]] and [[uniform convergence|locally uniformly]] as long as

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n\in\Z,\,n\ne 0}\left|\frac{x[n]}n\right|&lt;\infty.&lt;/math&gt;

By the [[H√∂lder inequality]] this is satisfied if the sequence &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (x[n])_{n\in\Z}&lt;/math&gt; belongs to any of the &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\ell^p(\Z,\mathbb C)&lt;/math&gt; [[Lp space|spaces]] with 1&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;‚àû, that is

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n\in\Z}\left|x[n]\right|^p&lt;\infty.&lt;/math&gt;

This condition is sufficient, but not necessary.  For example, the sum will generally converge if the sample sequence comes from sampling almost any [[stationary process]], in which case the sample sequence is not square summable, and is not in any &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\ell^p(\Z,\mathbb C)&lt;/math&gt; space.

==Stationary random processes==
If ''x''[''n''] is an infinite sequence of samples of a sample function of a wide-sense [[stationary process]], then it is not a member of any &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\ell^p&lt;/math&gt; or [[Lp space|L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt; space]], with probability 1; that is, the infinite sum of samples raised to a power ''p'' does not have a finite expected value. Nevertheless, the interpolation formula  converges with probability 1.  Convergence can readily be shown by computing the variances of truncated terms of the summation, and showing that the variance can be made arbitrarily small by choosing a sufficient number of terms.  If the process mean is nonzero, then pairs of terms need to be considered to also show that the expected value of the truncated terms converges to zero.

Since a random process does not have a Fourier transform, the condition under which the sum converges to the original function must also be different.  A stationary random process does have an [[autocorrelation function]] and hence a [[spectral density]] according to the [[Wiener‚ÄìKhinchin theorem]].  A suitable condition for convergence to a sample function from the process is that the spectral density of the process be zero at all frequencies equal to and above half the sample rate.

In [[computational learning theory]], let ''C'' be a [[concept class]] over a domain ''X'' and ''c'' be a concept in ''C''. A subset ''S'' of ''X'' is a '''witness set''' for ''c'' in ''C'' if ''c''(''S'') verifies ''c'' (i.e., ''c'' is the only consistent concept with respect to ''c''(''S'')). The minimum size of a witness set for ''c'' is called the ''witness size'' or ''specification number'' and is denoted by &lt;math&gt;w_C(c)&lt;/math&gt;. The value &lt;math&gt;\max\{w_C(c):c\in C\}&lt;/math&gt; is called the [[teaching dimension]] of ''C''.
