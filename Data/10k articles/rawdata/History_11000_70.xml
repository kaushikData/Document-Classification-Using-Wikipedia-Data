As a means of recording the passage of [[time]], the '''14th century''' also known as the 1300s was a [[century]] lasting from January 1, 1300, to December 31, 1399.  Political and natural disasters ravaged country both Europe and the four khanates of the Mongol Empire. Consequently, the [[Empire of the Great Khan|Mongol court]] was driven out of China and [[northern yuan|retreated]] to Mongolia, the [[Ilkhanate]] collapsed in Persia, the [[Chagatai Khanate|Chaghatayid]] dissolved and broke into two parts and the [[Golden Horde]] lost its position as great power in Eastern Europe.

In [[Europe]], the [[Black Death]] claimed between 75 and 200 million lives, while [[England]] and [[France]] fought in the protracted [[Hundred Years' War]] after the death of [[Charles IV of France|Charles IV, King of France]] led to a claim to the French throne by [[Edward III of England|Edward III, King of England]]. This period is considered the height of [[chivalry]] and marks the beginning of strong separate identities for both England and France.

The '''4th century BC''' started the first day of [[400 BC]] and ended the last day of [[301 BC]]. It is considered part of the [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] [[era]], [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]], or [[historical period]].

[[Image:World in 323 BCE.png|thumb|240px|Map of the world in 323 BC (at the death of [[Alexander the Great]])]]
This century marked the height of [[Classical Greece|Classical Greek civilization]] in all of its aspects. By the year 400 Greek [[philosophy]], [[art]], [[literature]] and [[architecture]] had spread far and wide, with the numerous independent Greek colonies that had sprung up throughout the lands of the eastern Mediterranean.

Arguably the most important series of political events in this period were the conquests of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]], bringing about the collapse of the once formidable [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] and spreading Greek culture far into the east. Alexander dreamed of an east/west union, but when his short life ended, his vast empire was plunged into civil war as his generals each carved out their own separate kingdoms. Thus began the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic age]], a period characterized by a more absolute approach to rule, with Greek kings taking on royal trappings and setting up hereditary successions. While a degree of democracy still existed in some of the remaining independent Greek cities, many scholars see this age as marking the end of classical Greece.

In [[India]], the [[Maurya Empire|Mauryan Empire]] was founded in 322 BC by the [[Nanda Dynasty]] and rapidly expanded his power westwards across central and western [[India]], taking advantage of the disruptions of [[Mahajanapadas|local powers]] in the wake of the withdrawal westward by the armies of Alexander.

[[China]] in the 4th century BC entered an era of constant warfare known as the [[Warring States period]]. The period saw the rapid rise of large states (such as [[Chu (state)|Chu]]) over smaller ones thanks to technological advancement. Though the period has usually been characterized by historians as being excessively violent compared to the [[Spring and Autumn period]] it was also punctured by several cultural and social growth through the expansion of several different sects of [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]].

==Inventions, discoveries, introductions==

* Oldest [[Brāhmī script|Brāhmī]] script dates from this period. Brāhmī is the ancestor of [[Brahmic scripts]], used in much of [[India]] and [[Southeast Asia]].
* [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] build their first [[aqueduct (Roman)|aqueduct]].
* [[History of China|Chinese]] use the handheld trigger [[crossbow]] for the first time.
* The first crossbow, the [[gastraphetes]], is invented at [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]]. (pre-421 BC)
* Burnt brick first used in Greece.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}
* Donkey-powered mills first used in Greece.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}
* In Greece, Aristotle proposes the division of the known sciences.
* [[Torc|Torque]] with lion's-head terminals, from [[Susa]] (modern , [[Iran]]) was made. It is now in [[Musée du Louvre]], Paris.
* [[Persian daric|Daric]], a [[coin]] first minted under [[Darius I]] of [[Persia]] is made. It is now kept in [[Charles Buller Heberden|Heberden]] Coin Room, [[Ashmolean Museum]], [[Oxford]].
* Second half of the 4th century BC – Tomb II, so called Tomb of [[Philip II of Macedon]], [[Vergina]], [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]] is made.
* Starting in the year [[309 BC]], the later Chinese historian [[Sima Qian]] (145 BC–90 BC) wrote that the Qin-employed engineer Bi Ling of the newly conquered [[Shu (state)|State of Shu]] in [[Sichuan]] had the shoulder of a mountain cut through, making the 'Separated Hill' that abated the Mo River, and excavated two canals in the plain of [[Chengdu]]. The significance of this was phenomenal, as it allowed the new Guardian [[irrigation]] system to populate an area of some 40 by 50 miles (60 × 80&amp;nbsp;km) with over five million people, still in use today (Needham, ''Science and Civilization in China'', Volume 4, Part 3, 288).
* The Chinese astronomer [[Gan De]] divides the [[celestial sphere]] into 365¼ degrees, and the tropical year into 365¼ days at a time when most astronomers used the [[Babylon]] division of the celestial sphere as 360 degrees (Deng, Yinke.

'''Aleksandar Stamatović''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Александар Стаматовић}}; born February 12, 1967) is a Montenegrin historian, professor and politician.

==Personal life==
Stamatović was born in Sarajevo, [[SR Bosnia and Herzegovina]], to a family from Montenegro which worked in Sarajevo at the time. In 1976, the family returned to [[SR Montenegro]] where he finished primary and secondary school, in history and archaeology. He served the [[Yugoslav Army]] in 1985–86. He graduated from the Philological Faculty (history and geography) in [[Nikšić]], in March 1991. He received a master's degree in the Philosophical Faculty (history) in [[Priština]], in 1994. He received a Ph.D. from the Philosophical Faculty (history) in [[Belgrade]], in January 2000. For thirteen years he worked as a professor on history in a number of primary and secondary schools in [[Podgorica]], Montenegro. In the 1998-2001 period he was an honorary professor on general history in the Orthodox Seminary of St. Petar of Cetinje.

He lives in Podgorica. He is a docent of history in the [[University of East Sarajevo]]. His father was a professor who worked throughout Yugoslavia, from the vicinity of [[Danilovgrad]], and his mother an economist from the vicinity of [[Šavnik]]. He paternally descends from the Stamatović clan of the historical Katun nahiyah, and declares as [[Serbs|ethnic Serb]].

==Politics==
He is the leader of the [[Serb Party of the Fatherland]] (Отаџбинска српска странка), which received 0.75% votes in the 2009 assembly election, and joined the "Serbian Unity"-coalition for the [[Montenegrin parliamentary election, 2012]].

==Works==

== Biography ==
Ibn al-Athir belonged to the large and influential Arab tribe [[Banu Bakr]], who lived across upper [[Mesopotamia]], and gave their name to the city of [[Diyar Bakr]]. He was the brother of [[Majd ad-Dīn Ibn Athir|Majd ad-Dīn]] and Diyā' ad-Dīn Ibn Athir. Al-Athir lived a scholarly life in [[Mosul]], often visited [[Baghdad]] and for a time traveled with [[Saladin]]'s army in [[Syria]]. He later lived in [[Aleppo]] and [[Damascus]]. His chief work was a history of the world, ''al-Kamil fi at-Tarikh'' (''The Complete History''). He died in the city of Mosul.

== Modern age ==
According to Reuters, his tomb was [[Destruction of cultural heritage by ISIL|desecrated]] in Mosul by members of the [[al-Qaeda]] offshoot the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) in June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Isra' al-Rubei'i.

'''Archaeocryptography''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀρχαῖος}}, ''arkhaios'', "ancient" and {{lang|grc|[[wikt:en:κρυπτός|κρυπτός]]}} (''kruptós''), "hidden, secret"; and {{lang|grc|[[wikt:en:γράφω#Ancient Greek|γράφειν]]}} (''graphein''), "to write") is the [[Research|study]] of decoding a monument or structure by determining the underlying mathematical order beneath the proportions, size, and placement to find any re-occurring or unusual data in respect to that which is being studied,&lt;ref name=Munck&gt;{{cite web|last=Munck|first=Carl|title=The Spirit of Ma'at|url=http://www.spiritofmaat.com/archive/nov2/munck.htm|publisher=Spirit of Maat|access-date=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; or within another monument or structure.

Archaeocryptography is not a recognized branch of [[archaeology]] or of any other academic discipline. It is an example of [[pseudoscience]] or [[pseudoarchaeology]] that employs contrived calculations involving many free parameters to achieve an impressive-looking result.&lt;ref name=Schmeh&gt;{{citation|last=Schmeh|first=Klaus| title = The Pathology of Cryptology—A Current Survey | journal =Cryptologia|volume= 36 | year=2012|publisher=Taylor and Francis Group|location=London|pages=14–45|doi = 10.1080/01611194.2011.632803 | quote = Arguments against archeocryptography are…: There are many numbers involved, which can be arranged in many different formulas and matched against many different values. Munck’s claims, therefore, would only be valid with a statistical foundation that proves that his findings are more than merely coincidence. However, Munck has never provided a proof like this. | postscript = , at pp. 19–20. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The word ''archaeocryptography'' is derived from ''archaeology'', which is the study of [[human]] activity in the past, and ''[[cryptography]]'', which is the study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties.

== Methods ==
[[File:Biholomorphism illustration.svg|thumb|Mathematical coordinates including π may be used to form Grid Point Values]]Archaeocryptologists try to find underlying correlations in respect that which is being studied or decoded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lauralee.com/munck.htm |title=Archaeocryptography, Carl Munck |author=Laura Lee |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some factors taken into consideration while deciphering an object, structure or [[megalith]]ic monument can include the features such as faces, stairs, sides, and terraces.  The [[geolocation]] or mathematical operations are performed on latitude and longitude coordinates&lt;ref name="Munck" /&gt; as well as astronomical alignments, such as are found with [[archaeoastronomy]]. The incorporation of grids,&lt;ref name=Wilcock&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilcock|first=David|title=Chapter 11: Global Grid 2|year=2011|publisher=Penguin Group|location=New York|url=http://divinecosmos.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=67&amp;Itemid=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; the use of numerical ordering, mathematical constants, Biblical [[gematria]], and any other re-occurring number that might stand out from the decoding process are determining factors.

Archaeocryptologists then can use different mathematical formulas to find correlations within that which is being studied or between other monuments or structures that share any underlying factors. Popular examples are the [[Orion correlation theory]] &lt;ref name="Bruce"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bruce|first=Alexandra|title=Science or Superstition (The Definitive Guide to the Doomsday Phenomenon)|year=2009|publisher=The Disinformation Company|isbn=978-1-934708-28-6|pages=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; between the [[Giza pyramid complex]] and the [[Orion's Belt|three middle stars]] of the [[Orion (constellation)|constellation Orion]], and also theories&lt;ref name=Richard&gt;{{cite book | title = The Monuments of Mars: A City on the Edge of Forever | last = Hoagland | first = Richard C. | publisher = Berkeley | year = 1987 | isbn = 978-0-9381-907-83 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xBBMGwAACAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; about the region of [[Cydonia (region of Mars)|Cydonia]] on [[Mars]].

== History ==
The coining of the word ''archaeocryptography'' is often attributed to Carl P. Munck,&lt;ref name="Schmeh" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greatdreams.com/gem10.htm |title=Geomorphic Resonance, by Michael Lawrence Morton}}&lt;/ref&gt; who after retiring from the United States military in the late 1970s began studying [[Cartography|cartographic]] material, among other topics, trying to search for better answers as to why certain megalithic monument exist. This led him to a formula he believes architects used to place and design various megalithic monuments.&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee |first=L |title=Archaeocryptography According to Carl Munck |url=http://www.atlantisrising.com/backissues/issue9/ar9archeocrypto.html |work=Magazine, Issue 9 |publisher=Atlantis Rising |access-date=1 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220123118/http://www.atlantisrising.com/backissues/issue9/ar9archeocrypto.html |archivedate=20 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Munck's theory claims that calculations using selected numbers or dimensions found in megalithic monuments or [[Egyptian pyramids]] yield the [[latitude]] or [[longitude]] of the site.&lt;ref name=Schmeh/&gt; However, in Munck's findings, the [[prime meridian]] does not run through [[Greenwich]], but through the [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]] in [[Giza]]. His theory is known simply as "The Code" and asserts that an ancient Jewish numerological system known as [[gematria]] is used in the manipulation of numbers to other key locations, mathematical components and positions of sights in the geometry of their construction.

The theory later become popularized and among other practitioners and researchers in pseudo-scientific fields, such as Michael Lawrence Morton, [[Richard C. Hoagland]], [[Bruce Cathie]], and Hugh Harleston Jr. They adapted archaeocryptography to their own studies, developing different theories &lt;ref name="bruce"&gt;

== In literary studies ==
The marginal, or even fictional, status of archaeocryptography was suggested in [[Zachary Mason]]'s novel ''[[The Lost Books of the Odyssey]]'', which purports to be a collection of lost works which the author describes as being as old as the [[Odyssey]] and which he claims to have decoded from a manuscript he had uncovered. In the author's biography at the conclusion of the book he describes himself as "the John Shade Professor of Archaeocryptography and Paleomathematics at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]". The "lost books" were actually written by Mason and, as reviewers have noted, Mason is a novelist and computer scientist who lives in California, [[John Shade]] is a fictional poet in [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s ''[[Pale Fire]]'', and no such professorship exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Taoka | first = Yasuko | year = 2012 | title = A Liar's Yarn: Storytelling in ''The Lost Books of the Odyssey'' | journal = New Voices in Classical Reception Studies | issue = 7 | pages = 40–48  | url = http://www2.open.ac.uk/ClassicalStudies/GreekPlays/newvoices/Issue7/Yasuko-Taoka.pdf | access-date = 8 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Calculus of Writing, Applied to a Classic|first=Larry|last=Rohter|date=February 9, 2010|access-date=9 January 2016|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/10/books/10mason.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raven earned an Artium Baccalaureatus from [[Hood College]] in [[Maryland]] in 1965, then went on to complete graduate study.&lt;ref name=woo&gt;{{cite web|last=Woo|first=Elaine|title=Arlene Raven, 62; Established L.A.

Raven was a major figure in the [[Feminist art movement in the United States|Feminist Art Movement]] and was part of an effort to educate women artists and provide them with opportunities to make and show work that was specifically about their experiences as women.&lt;ref name=studio&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arlene Raven|author2=Judy Chicago|author3=Sheila de Bretteville|title=The Feminist Studio Workshop|journal=Womanspace|date=April–May 1973|volume=1|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1973, Raven co-founded the Feminist Studio Workshop with [[Judy Chicago]] and [[Sheila Levrant de Bretteville]].&lt;ref name="The Woman's Building"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Woman's Building|url=http://womansbuilding.org/timeline.htm|work=Timeline|accessdate=November 1, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125014956/http://www.womansbuilding.org/timeline.htm|archive-date=November 25, 2011|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The goal of the Feminist Studio Workshop, an independent art school ultimately housed in the Los Angeles [[Woman's Building]], was to "come together as a community of working individuals whose work grows out of our shared experiences as women and our shared social context," and an emphasis was put on "cooperation, collaboration, and sisterhood."&lt;ref name=studio/&gt; That same year, Raven co-founded The Center for Feminist Art Historical Studies with fellow Johns Hopkins-educated art historian Ruth Iskin.&lt;ref name=hands&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilding|first=Faith|title=By Our Own Hands|year=1977|publisher=Double X|location=Santa Monica, CA|pages=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center was dedicated to serious research on women artists, developing a feminist art historical [[methodology]], and creating a slide archive of work by women.&lt;ref name=hands/&gt; Raven also co-founded and edited the women's culture magazine ''Chrysalis.''&lt;ref name="Chicago"&gt;{{cite web|last=Chicago |first=Judy |title=Arlene Raven Feminist Art Activist 1944 – 2006 |url=http://jwa.org/weremember/raven |work=We Remember |accessdate=November 1, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110922120916/http://jwa.org/weremember/raven |archivedate=September 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, she was a founding member of The Lesbian Art Project; she herself was a lesbian as well.&lt;ref name="The Woman's Building"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=sNCJAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=arlene+raven+lesbian&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_-UdVK7qNsK1yASgwoCwBA&amp;ved=0CCoQ6wEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=arlene%20raven%20lesbian&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; Members explored lesbianism through artwork, researched lesbian artists of the past, such as the painter [[Romaine Brooks]], and questioned the cultural meaning of the very term "lesbian."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=From Site to Vision: The Woman's Building in Contemporary Culture|year=2011|publisher=OTIS College of Art and Design|location=Los Angeles, CA|pages=354|author=Terry Wolverton|authorlink=Lesbian Art : A Partial Inventory|editor=Sondra Hale and Terry Wolverton}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also a founder of the [[Women’s Caucus for Art]].&lt;ref name=photo&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography: Arlene Raven|url=http://www.cla.purdue.edu/waaw/corinne/Raven.htm|work=Lesbian Photography on the West Coast, 1972–1977|publisher=Women Artists of the American West|accessdate=November 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Birthplace of Simón Bolívar''' ({{lang-es|Casa Natal del Libertador Simón Bolívar}}) is a seventeenth-century house in the [[Venezuela]]n capital city [[Caracas]] where the hero of Venezuelan and Latin American independence, [[Simón Bolívar]], was born. Now a significant tourist attraction, the building is located in a little street off the Plaza San Jacinto, a block east of the [[Plaza Bolívar (Caracas)|Plaza Bolívar]].&lt;ref name="Bolívar1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bolívar|first=Simón|title=Doctrina del Libertador|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D4La0_vefzgC&amp;pg=PA283|year=1995|publisher=Fundacion Biblioteca Ayacuch|language=Spanish|isbn=978-980-276-238-5|page=283}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maddicks2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Russell Maddicks|title=Bradt Travel Guide Venezuela|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1pnZHGawJy0C&amp;pg=PA87|accessdate=11 May 2013|date=1 February 2011|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=978-1-84162-299-6|pages=87, 106}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is one of only a few houses from the colonial era which survive in central Caracas.

One of the adjacent buildings serves as a [[Bolivarian Museum|Bolivarian museum]] (''museo bolivariano'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://casa-natal-del-libertador.webnode.com.ve/ Red Museos Bolivarianos (Casa Natal-Museo Bolivariano)] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The birthplace and museum together present memorabilia connected with Bolivar and the [[Venezuelan War of Independence]], along with weapons and furniture of that period.

==History==
[[File:Simon Bolivar 000.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Simón Bolívar in the house]]
The house on San Jacinto Street was completed in the 1640s.&lt;ref name="Arana2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Arana|first=Marie|title=Bolivar: American Liberator|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SnZj6v_gJPAC&amp;pg=PT8|date=9 April 2013|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=978-1-4391-2495-6|pages=8–}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Bolivar was born to Doña María de la Concepción Palacios y Blanco and Coronel Don Juan Vicente Bolívar y Ponte in the bedroom here on 24 July 1783, and was the fourth child of the aristocratic couple of the Creole family who had migrated from Spain 200 years earlier. In 1806, the house was sold to a relation of Bolívar called Madriz.  The house remained in his family until 1876 when it was bought by President [[Antonio Guzmán Blanco]].&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, John ''Simon Bolivar: A Life''&lt;/ref&gt;  Guzmán Blanco was an admirer of Bolívar, and erected his [[Simón Bolívar (Tadolini)|equestrian statue]] in the Plaza Bolivar.

Reconstruction of the house was ordered on October 28, 1916,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=7 |title=The Birthplace of the Liberator: Simon Bolivar |publisher=University of Texas |url=https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=KJFrAAAAMAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the purpose of preserving Venezuela's cultural heritage, and to honor its national hero, but it was not until 1920 when the house actually underwent reconstruction with added refinements.&lt;ref name="Lynch2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lynch|first=John|title=Simón Bolívar: A Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zHWkaLOfoVQC&amp;pg=PA302|year=2007|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-12604-4|page=302}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was inaugurated on 5 January 1921 on the anniversary of the [[Battle of Carabobo]].&lt;ref name="Lynch2007"/&gt;
The building became a listed National Monument on 25 July 2002.&lt;ref name=venaa&gt;[http://www.venezuelaa.com/articulos/7.asp "La Casa Natal del Libertador Simon Bolivar"], Venezuela. {{es icon}} Retrieved 9 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
The single-storey building occupies a relatively narrow plot, 23 meters wide and 60 meters deep. It has wide corridors and courtyards and patios.&lt;ref name="Duarte"&gt;{{cite web|last=
Duarte |first=Carlos F.|title=Historia de la Casa Natal de Simón Bolívar y aportes documentales sobre la Cuadra Bolívar|publisher= Caracas: Fundación Cisneros|year=2003|accessdate=|pages=20–22|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Patio central - casa de Bolívar.JPG|thumb|right|Courtyard at the main entrance]]
The reconstruction is [[Spanish Colonial architecture|Spanish Colonial]] in character, but the aim of the restorers was to enhance the building, rather than adopt criteria of strict authenticity. New materials were introduced; for example the facade facing the street has been refaced in stone, which is atypical of colonial-era houses in Venezuela. Other walls are whitewashed: the structure underneath is now made of brick, although it was probably made of adobe originally.

At the time of Bolívar's birth, the home was opulently furnished with mahogany chests and tables, upholstered chairs, decorated mirrors; damask curtains, gold cornices, and bright chandeliers.&lt;ref name=Arana2013 /&gt; Period furniture and artifacts belonging to Bolívar can now be seen in the building. The house has a sequence of courtyards surrounded by corridors and rooms. In the main courtyard is the baptismal font used for Bolívar's baptism, originally located in [[Caracas Cathedral]].&lt;ref name="International1985"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Oscar E. Salazar S.|title=The Rotarian|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5TUEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA28|accessdate=11 May 2013|date=May 1985|publisher=Rotary International|pages=28–29|issn=0035-838X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second courtyard serves as ventilation to the kitchen and other rooms, and includes a replica of a water fountain from the time of Bolívar. At the end of the house is a small pen-laundry and stable.
[[File:Room - casa de Bolivar.jpg|thumb|right|Bedroom]]
Among those which stand out are the main room, the bedroom (site where Simón Bolívar was born) and the cabinet, which occupy the front body of the building. They are decorated with murals executed by the painter [[Tito Salas]]. These very large paintings by Salas depict Bolívar's heroic battles and scenes during his life.&lt;ref name="PlanetRaub2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Raub|first1=Kevin|last2=Kluepfel|first2=Brian|last3=Masters|first3=Tom |title=Lonely Planet Venezuela|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M2bRSIvqW2UC&amp;pg=PA61|date=1 September 2010|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74220-388-1|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one painting at the house, Salas depicts Bolívar on a white mountain with a white bearded man with angel wings.&lt;ref name="IretonSchaumann2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ireton|first1=Sean Moore|last2=Schaumann|first2=Caroline|title=Heights of Reflection: Mountains in the German Imagination from the Middle Ages to the Twenty-first Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h7HJNbI3bDEC&amp;pg=PA154|date=1 June 2012|publisher=Camden House|isbn=978-1-57113-502-5|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also paintings of his life scenes by [[Martín Tovar y Tovar]] and [[Arturo Michelena]], including his christening, wedding and death.&lt;ref name=venaa/&gt; There is also a tree in the backyard of the house, which is famous as it is said to be the location where Simon was taught by [[Simón Rodríguez|Rodríguez]].&lt;ref name="PlanetRaub2010"/&gt;

Bolivar’s  childhood mementos such as his library and personal records are also exhibited.&lt;ref name="International1985"/&gt;

==Other homes of Bolívar==
===Venezuela===
Despite the Venezuelan authorities' assertion that Bolívar was born in Caracas, there have been claims that the much poorer town of [[San Mateo, Aragua]], was in fact his true birthplace. The claims are based on the fact that Bolívar's mother had certainly been living at the San Mateo ranch shortly before his birth and that as a child, Bolívar spent much of his time there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sanmateo2001.tripod.com/San_Mateo.htm "San Mateo Municipio Bolívar, Edo. Aragua, Venezuela"]. {{es icon}} Retrieved 10 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also another family home of Bolivar which has historical importance. It was the venue where the independence movement was launched on 19 April 1810 after the freedom fighters had conspired to act during their first meeting at this home in 1818. Eventually, as result of this movement Venezuela got its independence from [[Spain]], on 5 July 1815.

'''British and Colonial Films''' was a British company making predominantly [[silent films]], which operated in London between 1908 and 1924. It was also known by the abbreviation '''B &amp; C'''.

The '''British and Colonial Kinematograph Company''' was formed in 1908 by Albert Henry ("Bert") Bloomfield (c.1882–1933)&lt;ref name=bufvc2&gt;[http://bufvc.ac.uk/newsonscreen/search/staff/detail.php?id=71 Biography of A. H. Bloomfield at British Universities Film &amp; Video Council]&lt;/ref&gt; and John Benjamin ("Mac") McDowell (1878–1954).&lt;ref name=bufvc&gt;[http://bufvc.ac.uk/newsonscreen/search/staff/detail.php?id=33056&amp;issue_id=1440&amp;story_id=126525&amp;referral=BUND Biography of J. B. McDowell at British Universities Film &amp; Video Council]&lt;/ref&gt; At first it operated from a rented basement in central London, using a single camera and developing the negatives in McDowell's house,&lt;ref name=bufvc/&gt; but soon moved to [[film studio|studios]] at Newstead House in [[East Finchley]], London.

It developed a reputation for both documentaries and feature films, notably the ''Lieutenant Daring'' series, featuring [[Percy Morgan (actor)|Percy Morgan]], and the ''Dick Turpin and Don Q'' films.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barnet.gov.uk/index/leisure-culture/libraries/archives/archives-histories/archives-finchleyhistories/archives-finchley-redlionhill.htm  Barnet LBC: Red Lion, Finchley] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227184047/http://www.barnet.gov.uk/index/leisure-culture/libraries/archives/archives-histories/archives-finchleyhistories/archives-finchley-redlionhill.htm |date=27 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bookrags&gt;[http://www.bookrags.com/tandf/british-and-colonial-kinematograph-tf/  Nicholas Hiley, ''Encyclopedia Of Early Cinema: British and Colonial Kinematograph Company'']&lt;/ref&gt; By 1912 it had begun making longer films, such as ''Robin Hood Outlawed'', and using [[Location shooting|location footage]], some shot by Fred Burlingham.&lt;ref name="ftvdb"&gt;[http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/organisation/7422  Film &amp; TV Database]&lt;/ref&gt; It also covered important news stories such as the funeral of [[Edward VII]] and the [[Coronation]] of [[George V]], as well as major sporting fixtures.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;[http://www.iwm.org.uk/upload/package/100/.../Film%20Biographies.pdf  Biography of J. B. McDowell]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910 the company made a film of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] and, in 1912, filmed the [[1912 FA Cup Final|F.A. Cup Final]] and the [[Epsom Derby|Derby]], as well as in [[Jamaica]].&lt;ref name=bufvc/&gt;&lt;ref name=bookrags/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colonialfilm.org.uk/node/4450  Colonial Film: review of ''Favourite For The Jamaica Cup'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913, after Bloomfield had left the company, the studio made what has been cited as "the first British [[epic film]]", [[The Battle of Waterloo (1913 film)|''The Battle of Waterloo'']]. This was filmed by director Charles Weston at [[Irthlingborough]] in Northamptonshire.

The company filmed ''The Life of Shakespeare'' (1914),&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; and two versions of ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'', in 1915 and 1923.  The first version is of historical interest for its use of a primitive sound process called [[Voxograph]], which required offstage actors to dub the voices at the same time that the performers were filmed. The second version in 1923 is the earliest surviving British film, visualising the play in about 22 minutes, and retaining many of [[Shakespeare]]'s lines as [[intertitles]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/564739/index.html  ScreenOnline: The Taming of the Shrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Communalism|Concepts}}

The '''commune''' is a model of government that is generally advocated by  [[communists]], [[revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialists]], and [[anarchists]]. The model is often characterized as being a local and transparent organization composed of delegates bound by mandates. These delegates would be [[recall election|recallable]] at any time from their positions. Proponents view the right of recall as a particularly important safeguard against corruption and unresponsiveness among the representatives.

==Introduction==
Almost universally, socialists, communists, and anarchists have seen the Commune as a model for the liberated society that will come after the masses are liberated from capitalism, a society based on [[participatory democracy]] from the grass roots up.

[[Marx]] and [[Engels]], [[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]], and later [[Lenin]] and [[Trotsky]] gained major theoretical lessons (in particular as regards the "dictatorship of the proletariat" and the "[[withering away of the state]]") from the limited experience of the [[Paris Commune]].

Nonetheless, these very advocates provided critiques of the commune. Marx found it aggravating that the [[Communards]] pooled all their resources into first organizing democratic elections rather than gathering their forces and attacking [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]] in a timely fashion. Many Marxists, based on their interpretation of the historical evidence and on Marx's writings on the subject, believe that the Communards were too "soft" on the non-proletarian elements in their midst.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

But the idea of the commune as a libertarian social organization has persisted within revolutionary theory. [[Kropotkin]] criticized modern representative democracy as merely being an instrument for the ruling class, and argued that a new society would have to be organized on entirely different principles which involved every individual more directly.&lt;ref&gt;''Kropotkin's Revolutionary Pamphlets'' (1970), Dover Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; He treats the [[nation state]] as a capitalist territorial organization which imposes itself over many communities through the spectacle of participation which elections deceptively provide. Communes on the other hand are expected to endow communities with autonomy from external powers and offer each person within them a part in decision-making processes, through communal assemblies and easily revocable delegates.

==Within Marxism==
[[Karl Marx]], in his pamphlet ''The Civil War in France'' (1871), written during the Commune, advocated the Commune's achievements, and described it as the prototype for a revolutionary government of the future, 'the form at last discovered' for the emancipation of the proletariat.

Thus in [[Marxism|Marxist]] theory, the commune is a form of political organization adopted during the first (or lower) phase of [[communism]], socialism. Communes are proposed as the proletarian counterpart to [[bourgeois]] political forms such as [[parliaments]]. In his pamphlet, Marx explains the purpose and function of the commune during the period that he termed the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]:&lt;ref name=civilwar&gt;[http://marx.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/index.htm Marx and Engels, ''The Civil War in France'']&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|The Commune, was to be a working, not a parliamentary, body, executive and legislative at the same time...Instead of deciding once in three or six years which member of the ruling class was to represent and repress the people in parliament, universal suffrage was to serve the people constituted in communes, as individual suffrage serves every other employer in the search for workers, foremen and accountants for his business.}}

Marx based these ideas on the example of the [[Paris Commune]], which he described in ''[[The Civil War in France]]'':&lt;ref name=civilwar/&gt;

{{cquote|The Commune was formed of the municipal councillors, chosen by universal suffrage in the various wards of the town, responsible and revocable at any time. The majority of its members were naturally working men, or acknowledged representatives of the working class.... The police, which until then had been the instrument of the Government, was at once stripped of its political attributes, and turned into the responsible, and at all times revocable, agent of the Commune. So were the officials of all other branches of the administration. From the members of the Commune downwards, the public service had to be done at workmen's wages. The privileges and the representation allowances of the high dignitaries of state disappeared along with the high dignitaries themselves.... Having once got rid of the standing army and the police, the instruments of physical force of the old government, the Commune proceeded at once to break the instrument of spiritual suppression, the power of the priests.... The judicial functionaries lost that sham independence... they were thenceforward to be elective, responsible, and revocable.}}

In addition to local governance, the communes were to play a central role in the national government:&lt;ref name=civilwar/&gt;

{{cquote|In a brief sketch of national organization which the Commune had no time to develop, it states explicitly that the Commune was to be the political form of even the smallest village.... The communes were to elect the "National Delegation" in Paris. The few but important functions which would still remain for a central government were not to be suppressed, as had been deliberately mis-stated, but were to be transferred to communal, i.e., strictly responsible, officials. National unity was not to be broken, but, on the contrary, organized by the communal constitution; it was to become a reality by the destruction of state power which posed as the embodiment of that unity yet wanted to be independent of, and superior to, the nation, on whose body it was but a parasitic excrescence. While the merely repressive organs of the old governmental power were to be amputated, its legitimate functions were to be wrested from an authority claiming the right to stand above society, and restored to the responsible servants of society.}}

==Bakunin's ''Revolutionary Catechism''==
Bakunin eventually diverged sharply both personally and ideologically from Marx and such a divergence is evident in his thought. Bakunin never advocated a dictatorship of the proletariat, but instead a collectivism based on communes and cooperative worker's associations allied together into a decentralized and stateless federation. In his ''Revolutionary Catechism'' he laid down the principles on which he believed a free, anarchist society should be founded upon. This included the political organization of society into communes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/michail-bakunin-revolutionary-catechism |title=Revolutionary Catechism |accessdate=7 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|K.   The basic unit of all political organization in each country must be the completely autonomous commune, constituted by the majority vote of all adults of both sexes. No one shall have either the power or the right to interfere in the internal life of the commune. The commune elects all functionaries, law-makers, and judges. It administers the communal property and finances. Every commune should have the incontestable right to create, without superior sanction, its own constitution and legislation. But in order to join and become an integral part of the provincial federation, the commune must conform its own particular charter to the fundamental principles of the provincial constitution and be accepted by the parliament of the province. The commune must also accept the judgments of the provincial tribunal and any measures ordered by the government of the province. (All measures of the provincial government must be ratified by the provincial parliament.) Communes refusing to accept the provincial laws will not be entitled to its benefits.}}

The autonomous commune is furthermore based upon the complete liberty of the individual and dedicated to its realization. Bakunin's anarchist commune is not organized into a [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] but a loose, yet cohesive federation that attempts to achieve the aims of the actively revolutionary class as a whole.

==The function of mini-communes==
Jeff Shantz points out in his book Constructive Anarchy: Building Infrastructures of Resistance, in hopes of mass communes one day being a reality, that "[[Communes|Mini-communes]] and [[Squatting|squats]] exist all over the world, but comprise only a marginal pattern of social organization in relation to society at large. However, many of them provide a self-conscious example of how a socialist society would function, even if only on a microsociological level. As they are, socialist [[commune|mini-communes]] are, along with [[workers' council|workers' associations]], the germs for the development of mass, socially complex communist communes."&lt;ref&gt;Shantz, Jeff (2010) ''Constructive Anarchy: Building Infrastructures of Resistance''&lt;/ref&gt;. This hypothetical is an example of what organizations like workers-organizations could lead to if brought to sufficient scale. In the case that this gradual progression is true, it would have implications both on the way that workers-organizations and their like are perceived both by those who hope for mass communes to be a reality and those who do not. For those who support communes, it would motivate them at a policy-level to encourage workers-organizations, for those who oppose communes, it would encourage them to abolish workers-organizations at every opportunity. The idea that workers-organizations gradually progress into communes, thus brings into question whether or not workers-organizations are fundamentally healthy or destructive in their long-term function. It is important to note at this point, that some do believe that workers-organizations are part of an inevitable progress towards mass-communes.

'''Dempsey Travis''' (February 25, 1920 &amp;ndash; July 2, 2009) was a real estate entrepreneur and [[civil rights]] activist who, later in life, became a prominent historian and author, writing extensively on [[African-American]] history, politics, social issues, and music.

==Early years and education==
Dempsey Jerome Travis was born in 1920 in [[Chicago, IL]], and served in the [[United States Army]] from 1942 to 1946, before earning his Bachelor of Arts degree from [[Roosevelt University]] in 1949.&lt;ref name=HistoryMakers&gt;[http://www.thehistorymakers.com/biography/dempsey-j-travis-39 Dempsey Travis Biography]. The Historymakers, Interview date 1-11-2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Businessman==

As an entrepreneur, Travis sought to revitalize African-American neighborhoods in Chicago. Travis Realty Company, which he founded in 1949, and Sivart Mortgage Company, which he founded four years later, increased the availability of mortgages for African Americans.

==Activist==

Travis was also involved with the [[Civil Rights]] movement, and while serving as president of the [[NAACP]] Chicago chapter in 1959 he coordinated [[Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s first civil rights march in Chicago on July 24, 1960.&lt;ref name=HistoryMakers /&gt;

==Author==

Travis’ career as an author began when he founded Urban Research Institute, later renamed Urban Research Press, in 1969. The Press was initially established to publish two studies on socioeconomic issues affecting urban African Americans, but later evolved into a literary press, publishing 21 of Travis’ books. Travis’s first book was the children’s book, ''Don’t Stop Me Now''  (1970). In 1981, he wrote ''An Autobiography of Black Chicago'' and became the first African-American author to have a book listed on the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' non-fiction bestsellers list.&lt;ref&gt;Page, Clarence.

Travis also published ''An Autobiography of Black Politics''  (1987), ''The Victory Monument'', ''I Refuse to Learn to Fail'', and ''Views from the Back of the Bus''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abebooks.co.uk/book-search/author/dempsey-travis/page-1/ Dempsey Travis author search] at abebooks.com, retrieved December 29, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors and awards==
Travis is listed in ''Who’s Who in America'', ''Who’s Who in Finance and Industry'', and ''Who’s Who in the World''. He was also listed among the "People Who Have Made a Difference" by the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' and was one of [[Ebony magazine|''Ebony'']]’s "100 Most Influential Black Americans". He was also the subject of numerous television programs: five of these shows have received Emmy nominations. He also received ''[[Black Enterprise]]'' magazine’s "First Annual Finance Achievement Award" on February 21, 1975.&lt;ref name=HistoryMakers /&gt;

==Archival collections==
The Dempsey Travis Papers exist in three locations: [[Roosevelt University]] Library, [[Chicago Public Library]] Vivian G. Harsh Research Collection, and [[Chicago History Museum]]. 
The papers showcase Travis’ career as an author, as opposed to his career as a real estate entrepreneur, and contain an extensive collection of interviews with prominent African-American figures in various fields including politics, business, and entertainment. The papers are arranged in series based on individual books, or subject of books, with the majority of series containing edited drafts, transcribed interviews, and general research.&lt;ref name=Papers /&gt;

'''Felipe Huaman Poma de Ayala''' (ca. 1535&lt;ref name=f165&gt;Fane, 165&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; after 1616), also known as '''Guamán Poma''' or '''Wamán Poma''', was a [[Quechua people|Quechua]] nobleman known for chronicling and denouncing the ill treatment of the natives of the [[Andes]] by the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] after their [[conquistador|conquest]].&lt;ref name=new&gt;Adorno, Rolena. [http://www.mith2.umd.edu/summit/Proceedings/Adorno.htm Felipe Guamán Poma de Ayala’s ''Nueva crónica y buen gobierno'' (''New Chronicle and Good Government'').] ''Early Ibero/Ango Americanist Summit: New World Antiquities and Histories.''

== Biography ==
The son of a noble family from the central southern Peruvian province of Lucanas located in the modern day department of [[Ayacucho]], he was a direct descendent of the eminent indigenous conqueror and ruler Huaman-Chava-Ayauca Yarovilca-Huanuco,&lt;ref name=tx&gt;Hamilton, Roland. [http://www.utexas.edu/utpress/excerpts/exguafir.html Table of Contents and Excerpt, Guaman Poma de Ayala, the First New Chronicle and Good Government.] ''University of Texas Press.'' 2009 (retrieved 8 Sept 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Felipe Guamán Poma de Ayala was a fluent speaker of several [[Quechua dialects|Quechua]] and [[Aymaran languages|Aru]] dialects,&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, xix&lt;/ref&gt; who probably learned the [[Spanish language]] as a child or adolescent. He went on to become literate in the language, although he did not achieve a perfect grasp of Spanish grammar.&lt;ref name=tx/&gt; He described himself as "eighty years of age" in his 1615 manuscript, leading many to deduce that he was born in the year 1535, after the 1533 Spanish conquest of Peru. It seems that he used the figure "80" as a metaphor for old age, however, and many other references in his text indicate a possible birthdate of 1550 or shortly thereafter.

The information known about Guamán Poma's life comes from a variety of written sources. Most likely he was born in the Lucanas province and spent most of his life in or near Huamanga, a central Peruvian district. It is believed that the first time he left his hometown was when he served as an interpreter on the church inspection tour of a Spanish priest named Cristóbal de Albornoz, who was attempting to eliminate idolatries in the small Quechua towns. In the late 1580s to early 1590s, he was an assistant to Fray Martin de Murúa, another Spanish cleric. In 1594 he was employed by the Spanish judge of Huamanga who was in charge of land titles. In late 1600, however, all of his property was confiscated and he was banished from Huamanga, an event that led to his travels throughout the country and most likely to the composition of his masterpiece.

Based on a published work, in 1967, by archaeologist Edward P. Lanning, "Peru before the Incas", one of the first references to an organized culture around the Huaman Culture, was between 1000 CE - 1476 CE, known as the "Late Intermediate", before the Inca Empire expanded, forming alliances with the most powerful empires.

The Huaman Family, per stirpes,{{explain|date=December 2017}} belonged to the wealthy among the Inca Empire, before and after. As it used to be common, the marriages among the ruling families took place, to remain in control and current. At the time, the Huaman (or Waman, in Quechua; or Guaman after the Spaniard conquest) were a selected family of warriors, and land owners in several regions of the pre-Inca empire. They venerated the wild bird (similar to a Falcon), that only grows in the Andean Region of Peru, above 4,000 meters above sea level.

There can be found, among the Inca's family tree lines: a)Tarco Huaman Inca, son of Inca Mayta Capac, cousin of Capac Yupanqui, and grandson of Lloque Yupanqui. b) Huaman Achachi, brother of Tupac Inca Yupanqui. c)Inca Huaman Taysi, son of Inca Rocca. d)Landowner Don Antonio Huaman Cucho, in Huamanga City, in 1570 declares ownership of several cities for the descendent of the Huaman Family as an Inca descendent.

During the occupation of the conquerors, the Huaman Family, being a very extensive family, were fiercely prosecuted, fearing the overtake of the Andean government, the impeachment of the Hispanic occupation and land ownership claims. Reasons for which most of wealth in pure gold, and ornaments were hidden and re-distributed among the descendants. Most family members moved to different areas from Peru and Ecuador. The most prominent landowners were located in Pariamarca, Santiago de Huaman, Quito and Huamanga.

There is a tale that says that direct descendants from the ruling Inca Huaman, are protected and secretly maintained as of "ready" to overtake the Peruvian empire and re-impose the supremacy of order over chaos. There are tales among the Andeans that one day the "...Hawk will fly high, where the Sun surrenders..."
&lt;ref name=tx/&gt;

== Chronicles ==
A handful of sixteenth-century documents attest that Huaman Poma served in the 1560s-70s as a Quechua translator for Fray Cristóbal de Albornoz&lt;ref name=tx/&gt; in his campaign to eradicate the messianic apostasy, known as ''[[Taki Unquy]]'', from the Christian doctrine of local believers.

Huaman Poma appeared as a plaintiff in a series of lawsuits from the late 1590s, in which he attempted to recover land and political title in the Chupas valley that he believed to be his by family right. These suits ultimately proved disastrous for him; not only did he lose the suits, but in 1600 he was stripped of all his property and forced into exile from the towns which he had once ruled as a noble.

Huaman Poma's great work was the ''[[Primer Nueva Corónica y Buen Gobierno|El primer nueva corónica [sic] y buen gobierno]]'' (''The First New Chronicle and Good Government''), a 1,189-page document written largely in Spanish, with sections in Quechua.&lt;ref name=tx/&gt; He wrote ''Corónica'' instead of ''Crónica'', a form of the word common in the Middle Ages. His book remains the longest sustained critique of Spanish colonial rule produced by an indigenous subject in the entire colonial period. Written between 1600 and 1615 and addressed to King [[Philip III of Spain]],&lt;ref name=f166/&gt; the ''Corónica'' outlines the injustices of colonial rule and argues that the Spanish were foreign settlers in Peru.&lt;ref name=new/&gt;&lt;ref name=tx/&gt; "It is our country," he said, "because God has given it to us."&lt;ref&gt;Guáman Poma and Dilke, 204&lt;/ref&gt; The king never received the document.

The ''Crónica'' is remarkable in many ways. First, it has brilliant melding of writing and fine line drawings (398 pages of the book consist of Huaman Poma's famous full-page drawings).&lt;ref name=new/&gt; The work also includes Huaman Poma's 'Mapa Mundi de Reino de las Indias', a cartographic representation of the Inca Empire drawn in the [[Mappa mundi]] style favored by medieval European mapmakers, which placed Cusco, the Peruvian capital, at the center of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, Rolena. “Andean Empire.” In Mapping Latin America. Dym, Jordana and Karl Offen, eds. University of Chicago Press, Chicago: 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the manuscript expresses the view of a provincial noble on the conquest, whereas most other existing expressions of indigenous views from the colonial era come from the nobility of [[Cusco]], the ancient capital of the Incas). Third, the author frequently uses Quechua words and phrases in this primarily Spanish work, which provided material for scholars to learn more about Quechua.&lt;ref name=tx/&gt;

Huaman Poma proposed a new direction for the governance of Peru: a "good government" that would draw from Inca social and economic structures, European technology, and Christian theology, adapted to the practical needs of Andean peoples.&lt;ref name=new/&gt; He writes that indigenous governments treated their subjects far better than the Spaniards and pleads with King Phillip to instate Indians to positions of authority.&lt;ref name=tx/&gt; It is important to note that, although he rejects Spanish rule, he does not reject the Spanish king. During that time, monarchs were typically seen as descendants of God and being strongly Catholic, Guaman Poma holds the Spanish monarch in the highest regard. In his writing, he not only wants to propose changes in society, but also to bring perceived injustices to the attention of the king, who, as representative of God, surely would not have allowed them to occur had he known.

The original manuscript of the ''Corónica'' has been kept in the [[Danish Royal Library]] since at least the early 1660s, though it only came into public view in 1908, when it was discovered by the German scholar [[Richard Pietschmann]]. After many aborted facsimile-projects, a heavily retouched facsimile edition was produced in Paris in 1936, by [[Paul Rivet]].&lt;ref name=tx/&gt; In 1980, a critical transcription of the book, based on autopsy{{what|date=December 2017}} of the manuscript rather than on the 1936 facsimile, was published by [[John Murra]] and [[Rolena Adorno]]&lt;ref name=tx/&gt; (with contributions by Jorge Urioste) as Felipe Huaman Poma de Ayala, ''Nueva crónica y buen gobierno'' (Mexico City: Siglo XXI). A high-quality digital facsimile of the original manuscript was published online in 2001 by the Danish Royal Library, with Rolena Adorno as scholarly editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kb.dk/permalink/2006/poma/info/en/frontpage.htm|title=The Guaman Poma Website|website=www.kb.dk|language=en|access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fray Martín de Murúa and Guaman Poma ==
Twentieth-century scholars had often speculated that there was some relationship between Guaman Poma's ''Corónica'' and [[Fray Martín de Murúa]]'s ''Historia general del Piru'' (1616), assuming that Guaman Poma served as an informant or coauthor to Murúa.&lt;ref&gt;Fane, 239&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, Condarco Morales compared the texts and concluded that Guaman Poma followed Murúa's work. A direct relationship between Guaman Poma and Murúa was confirmed in 2007-2008 by a project at the [[Getty Research Institute]]. The project's principal scholars included Juan de Ossio, Thomas Cummins, and Barbara Anderson, with collaboration by Rolena Adorno and Ivan Boserup.&lt;ref name=tx/&gt; After comparing the two existing manuscripts of ''Historia general del Piru'' (one owned by the Getty and the other by a private collector in Ireland), these scholars proved that Murúa's chronicle includes illustrations by Guaman Poma. They concluded that Guaman Poma was one of a team of scribes and artists who worked for Murúa. While Murúa's project began sometime in the 1580s, Guaman Poma became involved only as an illustrator and only shortly before 1600. Still, his contribution to ''Historia general del Piru'' is very significant. These findings were the basis of an exhibition and symposium at the [[Getty Center]] in October 2008.
 
Guaman Poma notably attacks Murúa in his ''Corónica'', including depicting the friar's striking and kicking an indigenous woman seated at a loom. This image is entitled "The Mercedarian friar Martín de Murúa abuses his parishioners and takes justice into his own hands." According to Rolena Adorno, "...when he became an author, after 1600, [Guaman Poma] was highly critical of a work by Murúa that he had recently illustrated. Guaman Poma was prompted to write his own account against what he understood to be Murúa's limited perspective, which he had encountered in [the original manuscript of ''Historia general del Piru''].

Guaman Poma wrote about Andean history back to the era predating the Inca. He also elaborated a long and highly critical survey of colonial society, unique among other manuscripts of the era. Guaman Poma's artistic range, displayed in his nearly 400 drawings, was based on his experience gained while working with Murúa, but it also developed in new directions.  He revealed a strong polemical and satirical bent that he directed against colonial abuses. "Although the evidence suggests that they worked independently after 1600, the efforts of Murúa and Guaman Poma can never be separated, and their talents, individually and together, produced three distinctive testimonies to the interaction between missionary author and indigenous artist-cum-author in early colonial Peru."&lt;ref&gt;Adorno and Boserup, pp. 7–75&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name ==
Guaman's name means "Falcon" or "Aguila" when translated into English and Spanish respectively. At the time, a Falcon, had the meaning of a representation of a "Supreme Existence". Someone, with the "designation" of a "Falcon" had the highest regards within the Inca and predesecing cultures. Poma's name meant "Puma" in Quechua dialect.&lt;ref&gt;Boone, Elizabeth Hill Boone and Tom Cummins. [https://books.google.com/books?id=5645QBr8d1gC&amp;pg=PA101 Native Traditions in the Postconquest World.] Dumbarton Oaks Research Library, 1998: 101. (retrieved through Google Books, 8 Sept 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; In modern [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] [[orthography]], it would be spelled Waman Puma,&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, lvi&lt;/ref&gt; and it is sometimes listed as such.  Other variants include Waman Poma, Huamán Poma, and Guamán Poma (the latter two with a Spanish accent; the Quechua stress is on the first syllable). In his own writing, he signed with his Quechua name put between his Spanish baptismal name, Felipe (or Phelipe, as he spelled it&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, xii&lt;/ref&gt;) and the family name of a Spanish [[conquistador]] connected to his family history, Luis Ávalos de Ayala.&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, 17&lt;/ref&gt; Guaman Poma writes about the symbolism of all his names in his book.  He seemed to consider the form of his name as a statement that his Quechua identity remained his core, although it was surrounded by Spanish names.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4469">'''Fernão de Oliveira''' (1507 &amp;ndash; c.1581), sometimes named '''Fernando de Oliveira''', was a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] grammarian, Dominican friar,  historian, cartographer, naval pilot and theorist on naval warfare and shipbuilding. An adventurous [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] and renaissance man, he studied and published the first [[Portuguese grammar|grammar of the Portuguese language]], the ''Grammatica da lingoagem portuguesa'', in 1536.&lt;ref name="BNP"&gt;[http://purl.pt/369/1/ficha-obra-gramatica.html GRAMMATICA DA LINGOAGEM PORTUGUESA DE FERNÃO DE OLIVEIRA at BNP], biography of Fernão de Oliveira at national treasures of BNP, the national Portuguese library.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Fernão de Oliveira was born in [[Aveiro, Portugal|Aveiro]] in 1507, the son of a judge. Starting in 1520, he studied at the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] Convent of [[Évora]], where he was a disciple of [[André de Resende]],&lt;ref name="BNP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TORRES"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VVFhzzkwcowC&amp;lpg=PA297&amp;dq=Fern%C3%A3o%20de%20Oliveira&amp;pg=PA297#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false A Propósito de Uma Nova Edição da “Gramática” de Fernão de Oliveira, Torres, Amadeu] on a new edition of Fernão de Oliveira Grammar (in Portuguese).&lt;/ref&gt; but later left for Spain. In 1536 he was in Lisbon, when he published his Grammar, the first for the [[Portuguese Language]].&lt;ref name="CLYNE"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wawGFWNuHiwC&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq Pluricentric languages: differing norms in different nations, Michael G. Clyne].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LAW"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4QOTTpX2NTMC&amp;lpg=PA234&amp;dq The history of linguistics in Europe from Plato to 1600, Vivien Law].&lt;/ref&gt;

He had a troubled adventurous life, engaging in secret religious missions in Italy, perhaps for king [[John III of Portugal]]. In 1545 he enlisted as pilot on a French ship, under command of the Baron Saint Blancard.&lt;ref name="BNP" /&gt; Soon afterwards, they were arrested by an English fleet. While in [[London]] he attended the court of [[Henry VIII of England]]. Having returned to Portugal in 1547, he was arrested by the [[Portuguese Inquisition]] due to his religious opinions, having been freed in 1551, through the intervention of [[Cardinal Henrique]].

In 1552, he became royal chaplain. Engaging in an expedition organized by king John III in North Africa, he was made prisoner for one year. In 1554, D. John III appointed him typographical [[reviewer]] of the [[University of Coimbra]], where he also taught [[rhetorics]].&lt;ref name="BNP" /&gt; From 1555 to 1557, he was imprisoned again. From this on, his life has become uncertain, it is known that in 1565, he received a pension by king [[Sebastian of Portugal]], having died c. 1581.

'''Francisco Javier Santamaría''' (September 10, 1886 in Cacaos in [[Jalapa, Tabasco|Jalapa Municipality]], [[Tabasco]] &amp;ndash; March 1, 1963 in [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]], [[Veracruz de Ignacio de la Llave|Veracruz]]) was an influential [[Mexican people|Mexican]] writer and politician who is best remembered for his contributions to the study of [[Mexican literature]] and [[lexicography]]; he variously worked or published as a [[bibliographer]], essayist, geographer, journalist, judge, lawyer, lexicographer, [[linguist]], [[naturalist]], [[pedagogue]], [[philologist]], and poet. He also served as a [[Mexican Senate|Senator of the Republic]] and as [[Governor of Tabasco|Governor of the State of Tabasco]].

==Life and work==
Francisco Javier Santamaría was born in 1886 in the ''[[ranchería]]'' of Cacaos, to a ''[[criollo (people)|criollo]]'' family of modest means. He began his schooling in [[Macuspana]] and completed his studies in [[Villahermosa]] (then called San Juan Bautista) at the [[Universidad de Tabasco|Instituto Juárez]], where he graduated with a teaching degree. He subsequently moved to [[Mexico City]] to study law, obtaining his license in 1912.

Beginning at a young age Santamaría demonstrated a talent for composition and an appreciation for the [[belles-lettres]] which would eventually evolve into a prolific career as a writer, lexicographer and linguist; his two most often cited works are the ''Diccionario General de Americanismos'' and the ''Diccionario de Mejicanismos'', the second of which is a continuation and completion of [[Joaquín García Icazbalceta|Joaquín García Icazbalceta's]] original project.

At the start of his political career Santamaría was an outspoken critic of [[Plutarco Elías Calles]] and the [[Laborist Party (Mexico)|Partido Labortista]] over which he presided. He was also a close friend and political associate of [[Joaquín Amaro#Amaro as Secretary of War|General Francisco R. Serrano]] (an inveterate enemy of Calles's), and supported the latter's presidential campaign for the 1925-1928 term, an enterprise which would ultimately end in the murderous defeat of Serrano and his closest associates. Santamaría would be the only one on Elías Calles's [[contract killing|hit list]] to not fall the night of October 2, 1927, an event known as the "[[Huitzilac]] Massacre," which resulted in the [[summary execution]]s of Serrano and twenty six other generals, and which President [[Álvaro Obregón]] ordered out of fear of military rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; His escape and survival would, however, result in years of exile and poverty in the U.S., an account of which he gives in ''Crónicas del destierro: Desde la ciudad de hierro'' (Chronicles of Exile: From the Iron City).

After returning to Mexico Santamaría re-entered politics by joining the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (PRI); eventually going on to serve as a Senator of the Republic for [[Tabasco]] from 1940 to 1946. Immediately after the conclusion of his term he was selected by the party as its candidate for the governorship of Tabasco, competed against three opponents and won handily, reportedly receiving 95% of the votes. As governor he worked to improve his state's educational system and general level of cultural and technological development, while continuing to write books and essays on a variety of subjects.

Francisco Javier Santamaría was a [[wikt:numerary|numerary]] member of the [[Academia Mexicana de la Lengua]] and held [[Chair (official)|seat]] 23.

'''Frank W. Wadsworth''' (June 14, 1919 &amp;ndash; August 9, 2012) was an American Shakespearean scholar, author, and sportsman.

== Life ==
He was born in [[New York City]], the son of Prescott Kingsley Wadsworth and Elizabeth Browning (Whittemore) Wadsworth. He graduated from the [[Kent School]] in 1938 and served as a naval aviator in WWII. After the war he completed his [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B. degree]] at [[Princeton University]], as well as his M.A. and Ph.D. He served on the faculty teaching English literature at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]; the [[University of Pittsburgh]], and was a founder and Vice President for Academic Affairs for [[Purchase College]].&lt;ref&gt;Hershenson, Roberta. [https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/22/nyregion/purchase-college-the-25-year-old-experiment.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm “Purchase College, the 25-Year-Old Experiment”]. ''New York Times'', 22 September 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; He also served as a member of the Selection Committee for The Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation; and as a member of the Advisory Council, Department of English Princeton University.

He was named a [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation]] Fellow in 1961, and was the recipient of numerous academic awards and honors, including a [[Woodrow Wilson Fellowship]], [[Folger Shakespeare Library]] Fellow, and honorary [[Phi Beta Kappa]].

Wadsworth was a trustee of the [[Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research]] from 1970 to 2006, an organization supporting [[anthropological]] research, and served as Chairman of the Board from 1977 to 1987. In recognition of his commitment to the scholarly integrity of anthropology, the Foundation renamed the Professional Development International Fellowship the Wadsworth Fellowship Program. 
His hobbies included horseback riding and sailing. He is buried in [[Arlington, Vermont]].

==''The Poacher from Stratford''==

Wadsworth was probably best known to the public for his ''The Poacher from Stratford'' (1958), a popular defense of Shakespeare’s authorship and the first such book written by an academic Shakespearean scholar.&lt;ref&gt;Matus, Irvin. [http://willyshakes.com/reflections.htm "Reflections on the Authorship Controversy (15 Years On)"]. 1994. ''All Things Shakespeare'', WillyShakes.com., 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; He thought that Shakespeare scholars should not dismiss the claims of those who believe that someone other than Shakespeare wrote the canon, and that treating the subject with silence worked instead to encourage rather than discourage such theories.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&amp;dat=19640301&amp;id=zQMiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=B08EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3230,152235 "Shakespeare Wrote Shakespeare—Prof"] in ''The Pittsburgh Press'', 1 March 1964, Sec. 2, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty-five years later he reviewed the field in an article published in the ''Shakespeare Newsletter'', "The Poacher Re-Visited," in which he wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is important that we recognize the iconoclasts, particularly those of us who are teachers. But as Shakespeareans … we should not do it by visiting upon them the disdain of the past but by letting them speak freely for themselves … Our role should be not to suppress debate but to instruct students how to consider the Oxfordians’ (and others’) arguments carefully and thoughtfully. That exercise will make students not just more responsible as far as Shakespeare is concerned, but also wiser, more critical, more judicial, in dealing with the complex challenges they will face in the difficult decades which lie ahead of them.&lt;br /&gt;
We demystify authorship controversies, assassination conspiracies, theories of extra-terrestrial shindigs, even painful social demands, by letting their proponents speak out, not by censoring them. At least that’s what I thought when I wrote ''The Poacher from Stratford''. And still do.&lt;ref&gt;Wadsworth, Frank W. "The Poacher Re-Visited". ''Shakespeare News Letter'', Vol. 3, Spring 1993, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gwyn Alfred "Alf" Williams''' (30 September 1925 – 16 November 1995) was a [[Wales|Welsh]] historian particularly known for his work on [[Antonio Gramsci]] and [[Francisco Goya]] as well as on [[History of Wales|Welsh history]].

== Life ==
Williams was born in the iron town of [[Dowlais]] situated above the industrial metropolis of [[Merthyr Tydfil]]. He attended the [[Cyfarthfa Castle|Cyfarthfa]] Grammar School and later read History at [[Aberystwyth University|University College Wales, Aberystwyth]]. During [[World War II]], he joined the British Army and fought at [[Invasion of Normandy|Normandy]]. Williams received his doctorate for a dissertation later published as ''Medieval London: from commune to capital''.Gwyn was also a committed Marxist however he became disillusioned with the Russian system following the atrocities committed by [[Stalin]].

==Career==
In 1954, Williams was appointed Lecturer in Welsh History at [[Aberystwyth University]] where he worked with another historian of Wales [[David Williams (historian)|David Williams]]. He left Aberystwyth for the [[University of York]] where he was Chair of History from 1965 to 1974.  He moved back to Wales in 1974, becoming Professor of History at the [[Cardiff University|University of Wales, Cardiff]], where he stayed until his retirement in 1983.  Throughout his career, Williams was known as an exciting lecturer, capable of drawing large crowds from across the university. After his retirement, he continued to write, but he focused more and more on television and film, presenting, with [[Wynford Vaughan-Thomas]], a 13-part series in 1985 by [[ITV Wales &amp; West|HTV]] and [[Channel 4]] on Welsh history entitled ''The Dragon Has Two Tongues''.

Williams was also a supporter of [[Republicanism in the United Kingdom|Republicanism]]; and later a member of [[Plaid Cymru]], he praised the anti-monarchy book ''The Enchanted Glass'' by [[Tom Nairn]].&lt;ref&gt;" We can no longer dodge the central issue of the monarchy.How can we cut free of its tentacles?... Tom Nairn's "quiet republicanism" can start us off". Gwyn A. Williams, Review of ''The Enchanted Glass''
by Tom Nairn. ''Marxism Today'', July 1988. (p. 43)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983 Williams took early retirement from his Chair at Cardiff  and began making films with Teliesyn, an  independent Welsh broadcasting company based in [[Cardiff]]. He eventually moved from Cardiff to the village of [[Dre-fach Felindre]], in [[Carmarthenshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = OBITUARY: Gwyn A.

[[File:Herbert Schendl c.2015.png|thumb|Herbert Schendl 2014]]
'''Herbert Schendl''' (Ph.D. 1971 University of Vienna, "Habilitation" 1985 University of Vienna, "Ao. Univ.-Prof" 1986, "O. Univ.-Prof." 1992 University of Vienna) is Professor and Chair Emeritus for English Historical Linguistics at the Department of English and American Studies at the [[University of Vienna]]. He has been the fourth "[[:en:Karl Luick|Luick]]"-Chair and a major proponent of the Vienna School of English Historical Linguisitics (a positionr that   since Schendl's retirement in 2007 hasbeen held by Nikolaus Ritt as the fifth such chair).

Schendl's work spans from Old English to Late Modern English, though his interests include present-day varieties and, not insignificantly, Austrian German (a passion he shares with [[Karl Luick]]). He  r incorporates sociohistorical approaches, e.g. Schendl (1996, 1997, 2012). Presently, Schendl is teaching courses on Old English at the Department of English and American Studies in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ufind.univie.ac.at/en/course.html?lv=122251&amp;semester=2017W|title=Advanced course: Old English and its cultural context|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schendl is perhaps most widely known as an innovator in the area of historical code-switching, an area he helped found and brought to prominence from the mid-1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schendl|first=Herbert|date=1997|title='To London fro Kent / Sunt predia depopulantes': Code-switching and medieval English macaronic poems|url=|journal=Vienna English Working Papers (VIEWS)|volume=6|pages=52–66|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His most popular monograph is his introductory book ''Historical Linguistics'', which appeared in 2001 in Oxford University Press' series ''[https://global.oup.com/academic/content/series/o/oxford-introduction-to-language-study-series-oils/?lang=de&amp;cc=lt Oxford Introductions to Language Studies]'', edited by [[Henry Widdowson|H. G. Widdowson]], and has been translated into a number of languages, and has appeared in China with a Chinese foreword.

== Education and Academic Career ==
Herbert Schendl grew up, like [[Herbert Penzl]], in Upper Austria and studied English and French Literature and Linguistics at the University of Vienna, originally towards a teachers' degree. In 1971-74 he worked as an Assistant Professor at what is now the Vienna University of Economics and Business, before, in 1974, returning to his Alma Mater Department as Assistant Professor. His "Habilitation" (second book) on verb valency in Old English was completed in 1985, followed by professorial positions in Vienna and, in 1992, a call as Full Professor to the University of Munich, which he declined, deciding to remain as Ordinarius at the University of Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://anglistik.univie.ac.at/staff/staff/former-and-retired-members-of-staff/schendl/|title=CV|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic philosophy and record ==
Schendl has been a member of the University Board of Governors ("Senat" in [[Austrian German]]), as the Dean's Committee Chair or as a member of the university-wide Arbitration Committee. His efforts have been recognized in a 2007 Festschrift on the occasion of his 65th birthday published by Braumüller,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tracing English through Time: Explorations in Language Variation|author=Herbert Schendl|editor1=Smit, Ute|editor2=Stefan Dollinger|editor3= Julia Hüttner|editor4= Gunther Kaltenböck|editor5= Ursula Lutzky|publisher=Braumüller|year=2007|isbn=9783700316138|location=Vienna|pages=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D3liAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 2012 international symposium on the occasion of his 70th birthday (see Conferences).

== Austrian Studies in English ==
Herbert Schendl has been editor of [https://www.peterlang.com/view/serial/ASE Austrian Studies in English] (ASE), currently with Sabine Coelsch-Foisner and [https://www.uibk.ac.at/anglistik/staff/mazzon/ Gabriella Mazzon].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.peterlang.com/view/serial/ASE|title=Peter Lang - ASE|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=January 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASE is a book series originally founded in 1895 as ''Wiener Beiträge zur englischen Philologie''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/studienzurengli00amergoog|title=Wiener Beiträge zur englischen Philologie|via=Archive.org|last=|first=|date=1895|publisher=Braumüller|location=Wien|trans-title=Viennese contributions to English philology|language=de|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=January 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the longest-running academic publication series in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.peterlang.com/view/serial/ASE|title=Peter Lang|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=January 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Austrian Studies has been a major vehicle of publication for the Vienna School, publishing works by Jakob Schipper (1895), Karl Luick (1903), or [[Herbert Koziol]] (1967). [[:de:Jakob Schipper|Jakob Schipper]], as the founding Professor of the Vienna English Department in 1877, was also the series' first main editor. Over 105 volumes have appeared in the series, which has been published with Peter Lang since 2014.

== Conferences ==
In February 2012, the symposium "Studying Change in the History of English: New Directions in Linguistics" (SCHENDL) was held at the Department of English and American Studies at the University of Vienna (co-organised by the School of English at Birmingham City University).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archiv-anglistik.univie.ac.at/research/natside/schendl-2012/|title=SCHENDL 2012 - International Conference in Honour of H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="87488">'''Italian Renaissance painting''' is the painting of the period beginning in the late 13th century and flourishing from the early 15th to late 16th centuries, occurring in the Italian peninsula, which was at that time divided into many political states, some independent but others controlled by external powers. The painters of Renaissance Italy, although often attached to particular courts and with loyalties to particular towns, nonetheless wandered the length and breadth of Italy, often occupying a diplomatic status and disseminating artistic and philosophical ideas.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Antonello da Messina who travelled from Sicily to Venice via Naples.&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Florence]] in [[Tuscany]] is renowned as the birthplace of the [[Renaissance]], and in particular of Renaissance painting, although later in the era Rome and Venice assumed increasing importance in painting. A detailed background is given in the companion articles Renaissance and [[Renaissance architecture]].

Italian Renaissance painting is most often be divided into four periods: the Proto-Renaissance (1300–1425), the Early Renaissance (1425–1495), the [[High Renaissance]] (1495–1520), and [[Mannerism]] (1520–1600). The dates for these periods represent the overall trend in Italian painting and do not cover all painters as the lives of individual artists and their personal styles overlapped these periods.  

The Proto-Renaissance begins with the professional life of the painter [[Giotto]] and includes [[Taddeo Gaddi]], [[Orcagna]] and [[Altichiero]].
The Early Renaissance style was started by [[Masaccio]] and then further developed by [[Fra Angelico]], [[Paolo Uccello]], [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Verrocchio]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] and [[Giovanni Bellini]].  The High Renaissance period was that of [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]], [[Andrea del Sarto]], [[Coreggio]], [[Giorgione]], the latter works of [[Giovanni Bellini]], and [[Titian]].  The Mannerist period, dealt with in a separate article, included the latter works of [[Michelangelo]], as well as [[Pontormo]], [[Parmigianino]], [[Bronzino]] and [[Tintoretto]].

The influences upon the development of Renaissance painting in Italy are those that also affected Philosophy, Literature, Architecture, Theology, Science, Government and other aspects of society. The following is a summary of points dealt with more fully in the main articles that are cited above.

===Philosophy===
A number of Classical texts, that had been lost to Western European scholars for centuries, became available. These included Philosophy, Poetry, Drama, Science, a thesis on the Arts and Early Christian Theology.  The resulting interest in [[Humanism|Humanist]] philosophy meant that man's relationship with humanity, the universe and with God was no longer the exclusive province of the Church. A revived interest in the [[Classical literature|Classics]] brought about the first archaeological study of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] remains by the architect [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]] and sculptor [[Donatello]]. The revival of a style of architecture based on classical precedents inspired a corresponding classicism in painting, which manifested itself as early as the 1420s in the paintings of [[Masaccio]] and [[Paolo Uccello]].

===Science and technology===
Simultaneous with gaining access to the Classical texts, Europe gained access to advanced mathematics which had its provenance in the works of [[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantine]] and Islamic scholars.
The advent of movable type [[printing]] in the 15th century meant that ideas could be disseminated easily, and an increasing number of books were written for a broad public. The development of [[oil paint]] and its introduction to Italy had lasting effects on the art of painting.

===Society===
The establishment of the [[Medici]] Bank and the subsequent trade it generated brought unprecedented wealth to a single Italian city, [[Florence]]. [[Cosimo de' Medici the Elder|Cosimo de' Medici]] set a new standard for patronage of the arts, not associated with the church or monarchy. The [[serendipity|serendipitous]] presence within the region of [[Florence]] of certain individuals of artistic genius, most notably [[Giotto]], [[Masaccio]], [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]], [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Michelangelo]], formed an ethos that supported and encouraged many lesser artists to achieve work of extraordinary quality.&lt;ref name=Hartt&gt;Frederick Hartt, ''A History of Italian Renaissance Art'', (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar heritage of artistic achievement occurred in [[Venice]] through the talented [[Jacopo Bellini|Bellini]] family, their influential inlaw [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]], [[Giorgione]], [[Titian]] and [[Tintoretto]].&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;&lt;ref name=MB&gt;Michael Baxandall, ''Painting and Experience in Fifteenth Century Italy'', (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Aston, ''The Fifteenth Century, the Prospect of Europe'', (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==

Much painting of the Renaissance period was commissioned by or for the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]]. These works were often of large scale and were frequently cycles painted in [[fresco]] of ''the Life of Christ'', the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]'' or the life of a saint, particularly [[St. Francis of Assisi]]. There were also many [[allegory|allegorical]] paintings on the theme of [[Salvation]] and the role of the Church in attaining it. Churches also commissioned [[altarpiece]]s, which were painted in [[tempera]] on [[panel painting|panel]] and later in [[oil paint|oil]] on [[canvas]]. Apart from large altarpieces, small devotional pictures were produced in very large numbers, both for churches and for private individuals, the most common theme being the ''Madonna and Child''.

Throughout the period, civic commissions were also important. Local government buildings were decorated with frescoes and other works both secular, such as [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]]'s ''[[The Allegory of Good and Bad Government]]'', and religious, such as [[Simone Martini]]'s fresco of the ''[[Maestà (Simone Martini)|Maestà]]'', in the [[Palazzo Pubblico]], [[Siena]].

Portraiture was uncommon in the 14th and early 15th centuries, mostly limited to civic commemorative pictures such as the equestrian portraits of Guidoriccio da Fogliano by [[Simone Martini]], 1327, in Siena and, of the early 15th century, [[John Hawkwood]] by [[Uccello]] in [[Florence Cathedral]] and its companion portraying [[Niccolò da Tolentino]] by [[Andrea del Castagno]].

During the 15th century portraiture became common, initially often formalised profile portraits but increasingly three-quarter face, bust-length portraits. Patrons of art works such as altarpieces and fresco cycles often were included in the scenes, a notable example being the inclusion of the Sassetti and [[Medici]] families in [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]]'s cycle in the [[Sassetti Chapel]]. Portraiture was to become a major subject for High Renaissance painters such as [[Raphael]] and [[Titian]] and continue into the Mannerist period in works of artists such as [[Bronzino]].

With the growth of [[Renaissance Humanism|Humanism]], artists turned to Classical themes, particularly to fulfill commissions for the decoration of the homes of wealthy patrons, the best known being [[Botticelli]]'s ''[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|Birth of Venus]] ''for the Medici. Increasingly, Classical themes were also seen as providing suitable allegorical material for civic commissions. Humanism also influenced the manner in which religious themes were depicted, notably on [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[Sistine Chapel ceiling|Ceiling of the Sistine Chapel]]''.

Other motifs were drawn from contemporary life, sometimes with allegorical meaning, some sometimes purely decorative. Incidents important to a particular family might be recorded like those in the ''[[Camera degli Sposi]]'' that [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]] painted for the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga]] family at [[Mantua]]. Increasingly, still lifes and decorative scenes from life were painted, such as ''the Concert'' by [[Lorenzo Costa]] of about 1490.

Important events were often recorded or commemorated in paintings such as Uccello's ''[[Battle of San Romano]]'', as were important local religious festivals. History and historic characters were often depicted in a way that reflected on current events or on the lives of current people. Portraits were often painted of contemporaries in the guise of characters from history or literature.  The writings of [[Dante]], Voragine's ''[[Golden Legend]]'' and [[Boccaccio]]'s Decameron were important sources of themes.

In all these subjects, increasingly, and in the works of almost all painters, certain underlying painterly practices were being developed: the observation of nature, the study of anatomy, of light, and perspective.&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;&lt;ref name=MB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keith Christiansen, ''Italian Painting'', (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditions of 13th-century Tuscan painting===
The art of the region of Tuscany in the late 13th century was dominated by two masters of the [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] style, [[Cimabue]] of [[Florence]] and [[Duccio]] of [[Siena]]. Their commissions were mostly religious paintings, several of them being very large altarpieces showing the Madonna and Child. These two painters, with their contemporaries, [[Guido of Siena]], [[Coppo di Marcovaldo]] and the mysterious painter upon whose style the school may have been based, the so-called Master of St Bernardino, all worked in a manner that was highly formalised and dependent upon the ancient tradition of icon painting.&lt;ref&gt;John White, ''Duccio'', (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; In these [[tempera]] paintings many of the details were rigidly fixed by the subject matter, the precise position of the hands of the Madonna and Christ Child, for example, being dictated by the nature of the blessing that the painting invoked upon the viewer. The angle of the Virgin's head and shoulders, the folds in her veil, and the lines with which her features were defined had all been repeated in countless such paintings. Cimabue and Duccio took steps in the direction of greater naturalism, as did their contemporary, [[Pietro Cavallini]] of Rome.&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;

===Giotto===
[[File:Giotto - Scrovegni - -36- - Lamentation (The Mourning of Christ) adj.jpg|thumb|upright=1.50|[[Giotto]]: ''The Lamentation'', c. 1305, [[Scrovegni Chapel]], foreshadows the Renaissance.|alt= Square fresco.

Joseph of Arimethea holds the shroud. In Heaven, small angels are shrieking and tearing their hair.]]
[[Giotto]], (1266–1337), by tradition a shepherd boy from the hills north of Florence, became Cimabue's apprentice and emerged as the most outstanding painter of his time.&lt;ref name=Vasari&gt;Giorgio Vasari, ''[[Lives of the Artists]]'', (1568)&lt;/ref&gt; Giotto, possibly influenced by [[Pietro Cavallini]] and other Roman painters, did not base the figures he painted upon any painterly tradition, but upon the observation of life. Unlike those of his Byzantine contemporaries, Giotto's figures are solidly three-dimensional; they stand squarely on the ground, have discernible anatomy and are clothed in garments with weight and structure. But more than anything, what set Giotto's figures apart from those of his contemporaries are their emotions. In the faces of Giotto's figures are joy, rage, despair, shame, spite and love. The cycle of [[fresco]]es of ''the Life of Christ'' and ''the Life of the Virgin'' that he painted in the [[Scrovegni Chapel]] in [[Padua]] set a new standard for narrative pictures. His ''Ognissanti Madonna'' hangs in the [[Uffizi Gallery]], Florence, in the same room as Cimabue's ''Santa Trinita Madonna'' and Duccio's ''Ruccellai Madonna'' where the stylistic comparisons between the three can easily be made.&lt;ref&gt;All three are reproduced and compared at [[Italian Renaissance painting, development of themes]]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the features apparent in Giotto's work is his observation of naturalistic perspective. He is regarded as the herald of the Renaissance.&lt;ref name=Eimerl&gt;Sarel Eimerl, The World of Giotto, (1967)&lt;/ref&gt;

A blaze of yellow light comes from the upper right from an angel not visible in this detail. A startled shepherd lying on the ground is twisting around to see the angel. The light from the angel touches the mountainside, figures and sheep.]]

===Giotto's contemporaries===
Giotto had a number of contemporaries who were either trained and influenced by him,  or whose observation of nature had led them in a similar direction. Although several of Giotto's pupils assimilated the direction that his work had taken, none was to become as successful as he. [[Taddeo Gaddi]] achieved the first large painting of a night scene in an ''Annunciation to the Shepherds'' in the [[Baroncelli Chapel]] of the Church of Santa Croce, Florence.&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;

The paintings in the ''Upper Church'' of the [[Basilica of St. Francis, Assisi]], are examples of naturalistic painting of the period, often ascribed to Giotto himself, but more probably the work of artists surrounding [[Pietro Cavallini]].&lt;ref name=Eimerl/&gt; A late painting by [[Cimabue]] in the ''Lower Church'' at Assisi, of the ''Madonna and St. Francis'', also clearly shows greater naturalism than his panel paintings and the remains of his earlier frescoes in the upper church.

===Mortality and redemption===
[[File:Orcagna Triumph of Death detail 01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.50|[[Orcagna]]: ''The Triumph of Death'' (detail), c.&amp;nbsp;1350, Museum of Santa Croce|alt= A small section of a badly damaged fresco showing people who are doomed to Hell. While horrible demons are clutching at them, the humans are intent on pursuing their evil ways of murder and seduction, seeming ignorant of their precarious state on the edge of a pit.]]
A common theme in the decoration of Medieval churches was the ''[[Last Judgement]]'', which in northern European churches frequently occupies a sculptural space above the west door, but in Italian churches such as Giotto's [[Scrovegni Chapel]], is painted on the inner west wall. The [[Black Death]] of 1348 caused its survivors to focus on the need to approach death in a state of penitence and absolution. The inevitability of death, the rewards for the penitent and the penalties of sin were emphasised in a number of frescoes, remarkable for their grim depictions of suffering and their surreal images of the torments of [[Hell]].

These include the ''Triumph of Death'' by Giotto's pupil [[Orcagna]], now in a fragmentary state at the Museum of Santa Croce, and the ''Triumph of Death'' in the [[Camposanto Monumentale]] at [[Pisa]] by an unknown painter, perhaps [[Francesco Traini]] or [[Buonamico Buffalmacco]] who worked on the other three of a series of frescoes on the subject of Salvation. It is unknown exactly when these frescoes were begun but it is generally presumed they post-date 1348.&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;

Two important fresco painters were active in [[Padua]] in the late 14th century, [[Altichiero]] and [[Giusto de' Menabuoi]]. Giusto's masterpiece, the decoration of the [[Padua Cathedral|Cathedral]]'s Baptistery, follows the theme of humanity's Creation, Downfall and Salvation, also having a rare [[Apocalypse]] cycle in the small chancel. While the whole work is exceptional for its breadth, quality and intact state, the treatment of human emotion is conservative by comparison with that of [[Altichiero]]'s ''Crucifixion'' at the [[Basilica of Sant'Antonio]], also in [[Padua]]. Giusto's work relies on formalised gestures, where Altichiero relates the incidents surrounding Christ's death with great human drama and intensity.&lt;ref&gt;Mgr. Giovanni Foffani, ''Frescoes by Giusto de' Menabuoi'', (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Simone Martini 077.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.50|[[Simone Martini]]: ''The Annunciation'', 1333, Uffizi, is International Gothic in style.|alt= An altarpiece with a golden background and a frame surmounted by five richly carved Gothic pediments.

In Florence, at the ''Spanish Chapel'' of [[Basilica di Santa Maria Novella|Santa Maria Novella]], Andrea Bonaiuti&lt;!---don't link because it goes to the wrong page.---&gt; was commissioned to emphasise the role of the Church in the redemptive process, and that of the [[Dominican Order]] in particular. His fresco ''Allegory of the Active and Triumphant Church'' is remarkable for its depiction of [[Florence Cathedral]], complete with the dome which was not built until the following century.&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;

===International Gothic===
During the later 14th century, [[International Gothic]] was the style that dominated Tuscan painting.  It can be seen to an extent in the work of Pietro and Ambrogio Lorenzetti, which is marked by a formalized sweetness and grace in the figures, and Late Gothic gracefulness in the draperies. The style is fully developed in the works of [[Simone Martini]] and [[Gentile da Fabriano]], which have an elegance and a richness of detail, and an idealised quality not compatible with the starker realities of Giotto's paintings.&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;

In the early 15th century, bridging the gap between International Gothic and the Renaissance are the paintings of [[Fra Angelico]], many of which, being altarpieces in tempera, show the Gothic love of elaboration, gold leaf and brilliant colour. It is in his frescoes at his [[convent]] of Sant' Marco that Fra Angelico shows himself the artistic disciple of [[Giotto]]. These devotional paintings, which adorn the cells and corridors inhabited by the friars, represent episodes from the life of [[Jesus]], many of them being scenes of ''[[the Crucifixion]]''. They are starkly simple, restrained in colour and intense in mood as the artist sought to make spiritual revelations a visual reality.&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helen Gardner, ''Art through the Ages'', (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Florence===
The earliest truly Renaissance images in Florence date from 1401, although they are not paintings. That year a competition was held amongst seven young artists to select the artist to create a pair of bronze doors for the [[Battistero di San Giovanni (Florence)|Baptistry of St. John]], the oldest remaining church in the city.  The competitors were each to design a bronze panel of similar shape and size, representing ''the Sacrifice of Isaac''.

Two of the panels from the competition have survived, those by [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]] and [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]]. Each panel shows some strongly classicising motifs indicating the direction that art and philosophy were moving, at that time. Ghiberti used the naked figure of Isaac to create a small sculpture in the Classical style. The figure kneels on a tomb decorated with acanthus scrolls that are also a reference to the art of Ancient Rome. In Brunelleschi's panel, one of the additional figures included in the scene is reminiscent of a well-known Roman bronze figure of a boy pulling a thorn from his foot. Brunelleschi's creation is challenging in its dynamic intensity. Less elegant than Ghiberti's, it is more about human drama and impending tragedy.&lt;ref name=W&amp;M&gt;R.E. Wolf and R. Millen, ''Renaissance and Mannerist Art'', (1968)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ghiberti won the competition. His first set of [[Baptistry doors]] took 27 years to complete, after which he was commissioned to make another. In the total of 50 years that Ghiberti worked on them, the doors provided a training ground for many of the artists of Florence. Being narrative in subject and employing not only skill in arranging figurative compositions but also the burgeoning skill of [[linear perspective]], the doors were to have an enormous influence on the development of Florentine pictorial art.

===Masaccio - Brancacci Chapel===
{{main|Brancacci Chapel}}

The first Early Rennaissance frescos or paintings were in started in 1425 when two artists commenced painting a fresco cycle of ''the Life of St. Peter'' in the chapel of the Brancacci family, at the Carmelite Church in Florence. They both were called by the name of Tommaso and were nicknamed [[Masaccio]] and [[Masolino]], Slovenly Tom and Little Tom.

More than any other artist, Masaccio recognized the implications in the work of Giotto. He carried forward the practice of painting from nature. His frescos demonstrate an understanding of anatomy, of foreshortening, of linear perspective, of light, and the study of drapery. In the [[Brancacci Chapel]], his ''[[The Tribute Money (Masaccio)|Tribute Money]]'' fresco has a single vanishing point and uses a strong contrast between light and dark to convey a three-dimensional quality to the work.  As well, the figures of ''[[Adam and Eve]] being expelled from Eden'', painted on the side of the arch into the chapel, are renowned for their realistic depiction of the human form and of human emotion. They contrast with the gentle and pretty figures painted by Masolino on the opposite side of ''Adam and Eve receiving the forbidden fruit''. The painting of the Brancacci Chapel was left incomplete when Masaccio died at 26 in 1428. The ''Tribute Money'' was completed by Masolino while the remainder of the work in the Chapel was finished by [[Filippino Lippi]] in the 1480s. Masaccio's work became a source of inspiration to many later painters, including [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Michelangelo]].&lt;ref name=OC&gt;Ornella Casazza, ''Masaccio and the Brancacci Chapel'', (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development of linear perspective===
[[File:Paolo Uccello 043.jpg|thumb|upright=1.50|Paolo Uccello: ''The Presentation of the Virgin'' shows his experiments with perspective and light.|alt=Fresco. A scene in muted colours showing the porch of a temple, with a steep flight of steps. The Virgin Mary, as a small child and encouraged by her parents, is walking up the steps towards the High Priest.]]
During the first half of the 15th century, the achieving of the effect of realistic space in a painting by the employment of [[linear perspective]] was a major preoccupation of many painters, as well as the architects [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]] and [[Leon Battista Alberti|Alberti]] who both theorised about the subject. Brunelleschi is known to have done a number of careful studies of the piazza and octagonal baptistery outside [[Florence Cathedral]] and it is thought he aided Masaccio in the creation of his famous [[trompe l'oeil]] niche around the ''Holy Trinity'' he painted at [[Santa Maria Novella]].&lt;ref name=OC/&gt;

According to Vasari, [[Paolo Uccello]] was so obsessed with perspective that he thought of little else and experimented with it in many paintings, the best known being the three [[Battle of San Romano]] paintings (completed by 1450s) which use broken weapons on the ground, and fields on the distant hills to give an impression of perspective.

In the 1450s [[Piero della Francesca]], in paintings such as ''[[The Flagellation (Piero della Francesca)|The Flagellation of Christ]]'', demonstrated his mastery over linear perspective and also over the science of light. Another painting exists, a cityscape, by an unknown artist, perhaps Piero della Francesca, that demonstrates the sort of experiment that Brunelleschi had been making. From this time linear perspective was understood and regularly employed, such as  by [[Perugino]] in his ''[[Christ Giving the Keys to St. Peter]]'' (1481-82) in the [[Sistine Chapel]].&lt;ref name=W&amp;M/&gt;

The ruler sits to the left on a throne. The building is Ancient Roman in style. To the right, two richly dressed men and a barefooted youth stand in a courtyard, much closer to the viewer, so appearing larger.]]

===Understanding of light===
[[Giotto]] used tonality to create form. [[Taddeo Gaddi]] in his nocturnal scene in the Baroncelli Chapel demonstrated how light could be used to create drama. [[Paolo Uccello]], a hundred years later, experimented with the dramatic effect of light in some of his almost monochrome frescoes. He did a number of these in ''terra verde'' or "green earth", enlivening his compositions with touches of vermilion. The best known is his equestrian portrait of [[John Hawkwood]] on the wall of [[Florence Cathedral]]. Both here and on the four heads of prophets that he painted around the inner clockface in the cathedral, he used strongly contrasting tones, suggesting that each figure was being lit by a natural light source, as if the source was an actual window in the cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;Annarita Paolieri, ''Paolo Uccello, Domenico Veneziano, Andrea del Castagno'', (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Piero della Francesca]] carried his study of light further. In the ''Flagellation'' he demonstrates a knowledge of how light is proportionally disseminated from its point of origin. There are two sources of light in this painting, one internal to a building and the other external. Of the internal source, though the light itself is invisible, its position can be calculated with mathematical certainty. Leonardo da Vinci was to carry forward Piero's work on light.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Murray and Pier Luigi Vecchi, Piero della Francesca, (1967)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], revered by the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] worldwide, was particularly evoked in Florence, where there was a miraculous image of her on a column in the corn market and where both the Cathedral of "Our Lady of the Flowers" and the large Dominican church of [[Santa Maria Novella]] were named in her honour.

The miraculous image in the corn market was destroyed by fire, but replaced with a new image in the 1330s by [[Bernardo Daddi]], set in an elaborately designed and lavishly wrought canopy by [[Orcagna]]. The open lower storey of the building was enclosed and dedicated as [[Orsanmichele]].

Depictions of the [[Madonna and Child]] were a very popular art form in Florence. They took every shape from small mass-produced terracotta plaques to magnificent altarpieces such as those by [[Cimabue]], [[Giotto]] and [[Masaccio]].

In the 15th and first half of the 16th centuries, one workshop more than any other dominated the production of Madonnas. They were the della Robbia family, and they were not painters but modellers in clay. [[Luca della Robbia]], famous for his ''cantoria gallery'' at the cathedral, was the first sculptor to use glazed terracotta for large sculptures. Many of the durable works of this family have survived. The skill of the della Robbias, particularly [[Andrea della Robbia]], was to give great naturalism to the babies that they modelled as [[Jesus]], and expressions of great piety and sweetness to the Madonna. They were to set a standard to be emulated by other artists of Florence.

Among those who painted devotional Madonnas during the Early Renaissance are [[Fra Angelico]], [[Fra Filippo Lippi]], [[Verrocchio]] and [[Davide Ghirlandaio]]. The custom was continued by Botticelli who produced a series of Madonnas over a period of twenty years for the [[Medici]]; [[Perugino]], whose Madonnas and saints are known for their sweetness and  [[Leonardo da Vinci]], for whom a number of small attributed Madonnas such as the ''[[Benois Madonna]]'' have survived. Even [[Michelangelo]] who was primarily a sculptor, was persuaded to paint the ''[[Doni Tondo]]'', while for [[Raphael]], they are among his most popular and numerous works.

===Andrea Mantegna in Padua and Mantua===
One of the most influential painters of northern Italy was [[Andrea Mantegna]] of [[Padua]], who had the good fortune to be in his teen years at the time in which the great Florentine sculptor [[Donatello]] was working there. Donatello created the enormous equestrian bronze, the first since the Roman Empire, of the condotiero [[Erasmo da Narni|Gattemelata]], still visible on its plinth in the square outside the [[Basilica of Sant'Antonio]]. He also worked on the high altar and created a series of bronze panels in which he achieved a remarkable illusion of depth, with perspective in the architectural settings and apparent roundness of the human form all in very shallow relief.

At only 17 years old, Mantegna accepted his first commission, fresco cycles of the ''Lives of Saints James and Christopher'' for the [[Ovetari Chapel]] in the transept of the[[church of the Eremitani]], near the [[Scrovegni Chapel]] in Padua. Unfortunately the building was mostly destroyed during World War II, and they are only known from photographs which reveal an already highly developed sense of perspective and a knowledge of antiquity, for which the ancient University of Padua had become well known, early in the 15th century.&lt;ref name=DD&gt;Diana Davies, Harrap's Illustrated Dictionary of Art and Artists, (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;
Mantegna's last work in Padua was a monumental  [[San Zeno Altarpiece (Mantegna)|San Zeno altarpiece]], created for the abbot of the [[Basilica of San Zeno]], [[Verona]] from 1457 to 1459.&lt;ref name=EL/&gt; This polyptych of which the predella panels are particularly notable for the handling of landscape elements, was to influence the further development of Renaissance art in Northern Italy&lt;ref name=EL&gt;Elena Lanzanova, trans. Giorgina Arcuri, ''[http://www.arcadja.com/artmagazine/en/2008/06/23/restoration-of-mantegna’s-san-zeno-altarpiece-in-florence/ Restoration Of Mantegna’S San Zeno Altarpiece In Florence]'', Arcadja, (2008-06-23), (accessed: 2012-07-13)&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/110000960 metmuseum Madonna and Child with Saints Girolamo dai Libri  (Italian, Verona 1474–1555 Verona), edit: 2000–2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mantegna's most famous work is the interior decoration of the [[Camera degli Sposi]] for the [[Gonzaga family]] in [[Mantua]], dated about 1470. The walls are frescoed with scenes of the life of the Gonzaga family, talking, greeting a younger son and his tutor on their return from Rome, preparing for a hunt and other such scenes that make no obvious reference to matters historic, literary, philosophic or religious. They are remarkable for simply being about family life. The one concession is the scattering of jolly winged cherubs who hold up plaques and garlands and clamber on the illusionistic pierced balustrade that surrounds a [[trompe l'oeil]] view of the sky that decks the ceiling of the chamber.&lt;ref name=W&amp;M/&gt;  Mantegna's main legacy in considered the introduction of spatial illusionism, carried out by a mastery of perspective, both in frescoes and in ''[[sacra conversazione]]'' paintings: his tradition of ceiling decoration was followed for almost three centuries.

===Antonello da Messina===
In 1442 [[Alfonso V of Aragon]] became [[Kingdom of Naples|ruler of Naples]], bringing with him a collection of [[Flemish painting]]s and setting up a [[Humanism|Humanist Academy]]. [[Antonello da Messina]] seems to have had access to the King's collection, which may have included the works of [[Jan van Eyck]].&lt;ref&gt;Ilan Rachum, ''The Renaissance, an Illustrated Encyclopedia'', (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; Recent evidence indicates that Antonello was likely in contact with Van Eyck's most accomplished follower, [[Petrus Christus]], in Milan in early 1456 and likely learned the techniques of oil painting, including painting almost microscopic detail and minute gradations of light, directly from Christus.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 361&lt;/ref&gt;  As well, his works' calmer expressions on peoples' faces and calmness in the works' overall composition also appears to be a Netherlandish influence.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 361)&lt;/ref&gt; Antonello went to [[Venice]] in 1475 and remained there until the fall of 1476 so it is likely that Antonello passed on the techniques of using oil paints,&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 361; Hartt pg. 563&lt;/ref&gt; painting the gradation of light, and the principles of calmness to Venetian Painters, including Giovanni Bellini, one of the most significant painters of the High Renaissance in Northern Italy, during that visit.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 563; Raunch pg. 361&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;&lt;ref name=DD/&gt;

Antonello painted mostly small meticulous portraits in glowing colours. But one of his most famous works, ''[[St. Jerome in His Study (Antonello da Messina)|St. Jerome in His Study]]'', demonstrates his superior ability at handling linear perspective and light. The composition of the small painting is framed by a late Gothic arch, through which is viewed an interior, domestic on one side and ecclesiastic on the other, in the centre of which the saint sits in a wooden corral surrounded by his possessions while his lion prowls in the shadows on the floor. The way the light streams in through every door and window casting both natural and reflected light across the architecture and all the objects would have excited [[Piero della Francesca]].&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;&lt;ref name=DD/&gt; 

==Progression Towards the High Renaissance==

===Patronage and Humanism===

In Florence, in the later 15th century, most works of art, even those that were done as decoration for churches, were generally commissioned and paid for by private patrons. Much of the patronage came from the Medici family, or those who were closely associated with or related to them, such as the Sassetti, the Ruccellai and the Tornabuoni.

In the 1460s Cosimo de' Medici the Elder had established [[Marsilio Ficino]] as his resident [[Humanism|Humanist]] philosopher, and facilitated his translation of [[Plato]] and his teaching of [[Platonic philosophy]], which focused on humanity as the centre of the natural universe, on each person's personal relationship with God, and on fraternal or "platonic" love as being the closest that a person could get to emulating or understanding the love of God.&lt;ref name=HRW&gt;Hugh Ross Williamson, ''Lorenzo the Magnificent'', (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Medieval]] period, everything related to the Classical period was perceived as associated with paganism. In the Renaissance it came increasingly to be associated with enlightenment. The figures of [[Classical mythology]] began to take on a new symbolic role in Christian art and in particular, the Goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] took on a new discretion. Born fully formed, by a sort of miracle, she was the new [[Eve]], symbol of innocent love, or even, by extension, a symbol of the [[Virgin Mary]] herself. We see Venus in both these roles in the two famous tempera paintings that Botticelli did in the 1480s for Cosimo's nephew, Pierfrancesco Medici, the ''[[Primavera (painting)|Primavera]]'' and the ''[[Birth of Venus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Umberto Baldini, ''Primavera'', (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]], a meticulous and accurate draughtsman and one of the finest portrait painters of his age, executed two cycles of frescoes for Medici associates in two of Florence's larger churches, the [[Sassetti Chapel]] at Santa Trinita and the [[Tornabuoni Chapel]] at [[Santa Maria Novella]]. In these cycles of the ''Life of St Francis'' and the ''Life of the Virgin Mary'' and ''Life of John the Baptist'' there was room for portraits of patrons and of the patrons' patrons. Thanks to Sassetti's patronage, there is a portrait of the man himself, with his employer, [[Lorenzo il Magnifico]], and Lorenzo's three sons with their tutor, the Humanist poet and philosopher, [[Agnolo Poliziano]]. In the Tornabuoni Chapel is another portrait of Poliziano, accompanied by the other influential members of the Platonic Academy including Marsilio Ficino.&lt;ref name=HRW/&gt;

===Flemish influence===
From about 1450, with the arrival in Italy of the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Flemish painter]] [[Rogier van der Weyden]] and possibly earlier, artists were introduced to the medium of [[oil paint]]. Whereas both tempera and fresco lent themselves to the depiction of pattern, neither presented a successful way to represent natural textures realistically. The highly flexibly medium of oils, which could be made opaque or transparent, and allowed alteration and additions for days after it had been laid down, opened a new world of possibility to Italian artists.

In 1483 the huge altarpiece of ''[[Portinari Altarpiece|the Adoration of the Shepherds]]'' painted by [[Hugo van der Goes]] arrived in Florence. Painted as early as 1475 at the behest of the Portinari family, it was shipped out from Bruges and installed in the Chapel of Sant' Egidio at the hospital of Santa Maria Nuova. The altarpiece glows with intense reds and greens, contrasting with the glossy black velvet robes of the Portinari donors. In the foreground is a [[still life]] of flowers in contrasting containers, one of glazed pottery and the other of glass. The glass vase alone was enough to excite attention. But the most influential aspect of the triptych was the extremely natural and lifelike quality of the three shepherds with stubbly beards, workworn hands and expressions ranging from adoration to wonder to incomprehension. [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] promptly painted his own version, with a beautiful Italian Madonna in place of the long-faced Flemish one, and himself, gesturing theatrically, as one of the shepherds.&lt;ref name=W&amp;M/&gt;

===Papal commission===
[[File:Entrega de las llaves a San Pedro (Perugino).jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.75|Perugino: ''[[Christ Giving the Keys to Peter (Sistine Chapel)|Christ Giving the Keys to Peter]]''|alt=Rectangular fresco. The scene is like Raphael's Marriage of the Virgin, above, which is based on it. There is a similar townscape and circular building in perspective, with an ancient Roman triumphal arch to either side. In the foreground, Jesus gives the keys of Heaven to St Peter, who is kneeling. To the right and left stand the other disciples and some onlookers, who are distinguished by Renaissance clothing. There are many more small figures in the square behind them.]]In 1477 [[Pope Sixtus IV]] replaced the derelict old chapel at the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]] in which many of the papal services were held. The interior of the new chapel, named the [[Sistine Chapel]] in his honour, appears to have been planned from the start to have a series of 16 large frescoes between its pilasters on the middle level, with a series of painted portraits of popes above them.

In 1480, a group of artists from Florence was commissioned with the work: Botticelli, [[Pietro Perugino]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] and [[Cosimo Rosselli]]. This fresco cycle was to depict ''Stories of the Life of Moses'' on one side of the chapel, and ''Stories of the Life of Christ'' on the other with the frescoes complementing each other in theme. ''The Nativity of Jesus'' and the ''Finding of Moses'' were adjacent on the wall behind the altar, with an [[altarpiece]] of the ''Assumption of the Virgin''  between them. These  paintings, all by Perugino, were later  destroyed to paint Michelangelo's ''Last Judgement''.[[File:Ghirlandaio,_Domenico_-_Calling_of_the_Apostles_-_1481.jpg|thumb|380px|Domenico Ghirlandaio and workshop:''[[Vocation of the Apostles]]'', [[Sistine Chapel]]|alt=Rectangular fresco]]
The remaining 12 pictures indicate the virtuosity that these artists had attained, and the obvious cooperation between individuals who normally employed very different styles and skills. 
The paintings gave full range to their capabilities as they included a great number of figures of men, women and children and characters ranging from guiding angels to enraged [[Pharaoh]]s and the devil himself. Each painting required a [[landscape]]. Because of the scale of the figures that the artists agreed upon, in each picture, the landscape and sky take up the whole upper half of the scene. Sometimes, as in [[Botticelli]]'s scene of ''The Purification of the Leper'', there are additional small narratives taking place in the landscape, in this case ''[[The Temptation of Christ (Sistine Chapel)|The Temptations of Christ]]''.

[[Perugino]]'s scene of ''[[Christ Giving the Keys to Peter (Perugino)|Christ Giving the Keys to St. Peter]]''  is remarkable for the clarity and simplicity of its composition, the beauty of the figurative painting, which includes a self-portrait among the onlookers, and especially the perspective cityscape which includes reference to Peter's ministry to Rome by the presence of two [[triumphal arch]]es, and centrally placed an octagonal building that might be a Christian [[baptistry]] or a Roman [[Mausoleum]].&lt;ref name=Giaco&gt;{{cite book|first=Massimo|last= Giacometti|title=The Sistine Chapel|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==High Renaissance painting==

The High Renaissance of painting was the culmination of the varied means of expression&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Wundrum "Early Renaissance" and "Renaissance and Mannerism" in ''Masterpieces of Western Art'', Tashen, 2007. Page 147&lt;/ref&gt; and various advances in painting technique, such as linear perspective,&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Raunch "Painting of the High Renaissance and Mannerism in Rome and Central Italy" in ''The Italian Renaissance: Architecture, Sculpture, Painting, Drawing'', Konemann, Cologne, 1995. Pg. 308; Wundrum Pg. 147&lt;/ref&gt; the realistic depiction of both physical&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Hartt and David G. Wilkins, ''History of Italian Art: Painting, Sculpture, Architecture'', 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  and psychological features,&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 309&lt;/ref&gt; and the manipulation of light and darkness, including tone contrast, [[sfumato]] (softening the transition between colours) and [[chiaroscuro]] (contrast between light and dark),&lt;ref&gt;Wundrum pg. 148; Hartt and Wilkins&lt;/ref&gt; in a single unifying style&lt;ref&gt;Wundrum pg. 147; Hartt and Wilkins&lt;/ref&gt; which expressed total compositional order, balance and harmony.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Hartt, ''A History of Art: Painting, Sculpture, Architecture''; Harry N. Abrams Incorporated, New York, 1985, pg. 601; Wundrum pg. 147; Marilyn Stokstad ''Art History'', Third Edition, Pearson Education Inc., New Jersey, 2008. pg 659&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the individual parts of the painting had a complex but balanced and well-knit relationship to a dynamic whole.&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad, pg. 659 and 662&lt;/ref&gt; Painting of the High Renaissance is considered to be the absolute zenith of western painting&lt;ref&gt;Wundrum pg. 145 &lt;/ref&gt; and achieved the balancing and reconciliation, in harmony, of contradictory and seemingly mutually exclusive artistic positions, such as real versus ideal, movement versus rest, freedom versus law, space versus plane, and line versus colour.&lt;ref&gt;Wundrum pg. 147&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most art historians state that the High Renaissance started around 1495 or 1500&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad pg. 662; Frommel pg.172; Hartt pg. 627; David Piper, ''The Illustrated History of Art'', Crescent Books, New York, 1991, pg. 129; Jacob Burchhardt, '' Cinerone'' 1841; Franz Kugler ''Handbook of Art History'' 1841.&lt;/ref&gt; and ended in 1520 with the death of Raphael,&lt;ref&gt;Frommel pg.172; Hartt pg. 627; Piper pg. 129; Wurdram pg. 147; Johann Joachim Winklemann, ''Lives of Modern Painters, Sculptors and Architects'' 1672.&lt;/ref&gt; although some say the High Renaissance ended about 1525&lt;ref&gt;Kugler; Honour and Flemming, pg. 466&lt;/ref&gt; or in 1527 with the Sack of Rome by the army of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]],&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad pg. 662; Lanzi.&lt;/ref&gt; or about 1530.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 310&lt;/ref&gt;  Many cite Leonardo da Vinci's the [[Last Supper|''Last Supper'']], started in 1495 and completed in 1498, as being the first work of the High Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad pg. 662; Frommel pg.172; Hartt pg. 627; Piper pg. 129&lt;/ref&gt;  In his book, ''A History of Art: Painting, Sculpture and Architecture'', 1985, Frederick Hartt states that 1520 to 1530 was a transition period between the High Renaissance and Mannerism.  The High Renaissance was dominated by three painters - Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo and Raphael; while Giovanni Bellini, Giorgione and Titian were the leaders of Venetian High Renaissance painting, with Correggio and Andrea de Sarto being other significant painters of the High Renaissance style.

===Leonardo da Vinci===
[[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]] (1452-1519) spent his formative years training in the [[Florence]] workshop of [[Verrocchio]] before moving Milan where he worked from 1482-1499 before spending 1500-1506 back in Florence.  Because of the scope of his interests and the extraordinary degree of talent that he demonstrated in so many diverse areas, he is regarded as the archetypal "[[Polymath|Renaissance man]]". But it was first and foremost as a painter that he was admired in his own time, and as a painter, he drew on the knowledge he gained from his other interests.
[[File:Leonardo da Vinci 002.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.75|Leonardo da Vinci: ''[[The Last Supper (da Vinci)|The Last Supper]]''|alt= Rectangular fresco, in very damaged condition, of the Last Supper. The scene shows a table across a room which has three windows at the rear. At the centre, Jesus sits, stretching out his hands, the left palm up and the right down. Around the table, are the disciples, twelve men of different ages. They are all reacting in surprise or dismay at what Jesus has just said. The different emotional reactions and gestures are portrayed with great naturalism.]]
Leonardo was a scientific observer. He learned by looking at things. He studied and drew the flowers of the fields, the eddies of the river, the form of the rocks and mountains, the way light reflected from foliage and sparkled in a jewel. In particular, he studied the human form, dissecting thirty or more unclaimed [[cadaver]]s from a hospital in order to understand muscles and sinews.

Leonardo achieved a degree of realism in the expression of human emotion, prefigured by Giotto but unknown since Masaccio's ''Adam and Eve''. Leonardo's ''Last Supper'', painted from 1495-1498 in the refectory of a monastery in Milan, became the benchmark for religious narrative painting for the next half millennium.  Many other Renaissance artists painted versions of ''the Last Supper'', but only Leonardo's was destined to be reproduced countless times in wood, alabaster, plaster, lithograph, tapestry, crochet and table-carpets.

More than any other artist, he advanced the study and painting of "atmosphere". In his paintings such as the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' (c.1503-1517) and ''[[Virgin of the Rocks]]'' (1483-1486) (the earliest complete work fully of his hand), he used light and shade with such subtlety that, for want of a better word, it became known as Leonardo's "sfumato" or "smoke".  He exhibited a revolutionary use of colour by defining the transition between figures by colour modulation instead of by actual lines.&lt;ref&gt;Wundram pg. 148&lt;/ref&gt; His work invited the viewer into a mysterious world of shifting shadows, chaotic mountains and whirling torrents.  Another significant work of Leonardo's was ''[[The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne]]'' (c.1503-1519); the monumental three-dimensional quality of the group and the calculated effects of dynamism and tension in the composition made it a model that inspired Classicists and the Mannerists in equal measure.&lt;ref&gt;"Leonardo da Vinci" in ''Encyclopedia Britannica''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Apart from the direct impact of the works themselves, Leonardo's studies of light, anatomy, landscape, and human expression were disseminated in part through his generosity to a retinue of students.&lt;ref&gt; name=Vasari/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Michelangelo===
[[File:Creación de Adám.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|Michelangelo: ''[[The Creation of Adam]]''|alt= Rectangular fresco. God is in the act of creating the first man, who lies languidly on the ground, propped on one elbow, and reaching towards God. God, shown as a dynamic elderly man, is reaching his hand from Heaven to touch Adam and fill him with life.]]
In 1508 [[Pope Julius II]] succeeded in getting the Florentine sculptor [[Michelangelo]] (1475-1564) to agree to continue the decorative scheme of the Sistine Chapel. The [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]] was constructed in such a way that there were twelve sloping pendentives supporting the vault that formed ideal surfaces on which to paint the [[Twelve Apostles]]. Michelangelo soon devised an entirely different scheme, far more complex both in design and in iconography. The scale of the work, which he executed single handed except for manual assistance, was titanic and took nearly five years to complete.

The Pope's plan for the Apostles would thematically have formed a pictorial link between the [[Old Testament]] and [[New Testament]] narratives on the walls, and the popes in the gallery of portraits.&lt;ref name=Giaco/&gt; It is the [[twelve apostles]], and their leader Peter as first Bishop of Rome, that make that bridge. But Michelangelo's scheme  went the opposite direction. The theme of Michelangelo's ceiling is not God's grand plan for humanity's salvation. The theme is about humanity's disgrace. It is about why humanity and the faith needed Jesus.&lt;ref name=TLT&gt;T.L.Taylor, ''The Vision of Michelangelo'', Sydney University, (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

Superficially, the ceiling is a [[Humanism|Humanist]] construction. The figures are of superhuman dimension and, in the case of [[Adam and Eve|Adam]], of such beauty that according to the biographer [[Vasari]], it really looks as if God himself had designed the figure, rather than Michelangelo. But despite the beauty of the individual figures, Michelangelo has not glorified the human state, and he certainly has not presented the Humanist ideal of [[platonic love]]. In fact, the ancestors of Christ, which he painted around the upper section of the wall, demonstrate all the worst aspects of family relationships, displaying dysfunction in as many different forms as there are families.&lt;ref name=TLT/&gt;

Vasari praised Michelangelo's seemingly infinite powers of invention in creating postures for the figures. [[Raphael]], who was given a preview by [[Bramante]] after Michelangelo had downed his brush and stormed off to Bologna in a temper, painted at least two figures in imitation of Michelangelo's prophets, one at the church of Sant' Agostino and the other in the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]], his portrait of Michelangelo himself in ''[[The School of Athens]]''.&lt;ref name=Giaco/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Bartz and Eberhard König, ''Michelangelo'', (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Goldschieder, ''Michelangelo'', (1962)&lt;/ref&gt;

Michelangelo's later work, ''The Last Judgement'', painted on the altar wall of the Sistine Chapel between 1534 and 1541, shows a Mannerist style, with generally elongated bodies, which took over from the High Renaissance style between 1520 and 1530.

===Raphael===
With [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]]'s (1483-1520) name is synonymous with the High Renaissance, although he was younger than Michelangelo by 18 years and Leonardo by almost 30 and died at the age of 37 just one year after Leonardo. It cannot be said that he greatly advanced the state of painting as his two famous contemporaries did. Rather, his work was the culmination of all the developments of the High Renaissance.

A gloomy figure in the foreground sits leaning on a block of marble.|Raphael: ''The [[School of Athens]]'', commissioned by [[Pope Julius II]] to decorate a suite now known as the [[Raphael Rooms]] in the Vatican]]
Raphael was born the son of a painter, so his career path, unlike that of Michelangelo who was the son of minor nobility, was decided without a quarrel. Some years after his father's death he worked in the [[Umbria]]n workshop of [[Perugino]], an excellent painter and a superb technician. His first signed and dated painting, executed at the age of 21, is the ''Betrothal of the Virgin'', which immediately reveals its origins in Perugino's ''Christ giving the Keys to Peter''.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt; 

Raphael, who moved to Florence in 1504 and to Rome in 1508, unashamedly drew on the skills of the renowned painters whose lifespans encompassed his. In his works the individual qualities of numerous different painters are drawn together. The rounded forms and luminous colours of Perugino, the lifelike portraiture of Ghirlandaio, the realism and lighting of Leonardo, and the powerful draughtsmanship of Michelangelo became unified in the paintings of Raphael. In his short life he executed a number of large altarpieces, an impressive Classical fresco of the sea nymph, Galatea, outstanding portraits with two popes and a famous writer among them, and, while Michelangelo was painting the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]], a series of wall frescoes in the Vatican chambers nearby, of which ''the [[School of Athens]]'' (1509-11) in the Stanza della Segnaturais is uniquely significant.

This fresco depicts a meeting of all the most learned ancient Athenians, gathered in a grand classical setting around the central figure of [[Plato]], whom Raphael has famously modelled upon [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. The brooding figure of [[Heraclitus]] who sits by a large block of stone, is a portrait of [[Michelangelo]], and is a reference to the latter's painting of the Prophet [[Jeremiah]] in the Sistine Chapel. His own portrait is to the right, beside his teacher, Perugino.&lt;ref&gt;Some sources identify this figure as [[Il Sodoma]], but it is an older, grey-haired man, while Sodoma was in his 30s. Moreover, it strongly resembles several self-portraits of Perugino, who would have been about 60 at the time.&lt;/ref&gt;

But the main source of Raphael's popularity was not his major works, but his small Florentine pictures of the Madonna and Christ Child. Over and over he painted, in slightly different poses, a similar plump, calm-faced blonde woman and her chubby babies the most famous probably being ''La Belle Jardinière'' ("The Madonna of the Beautiful Garden"), now in the [[Louvre]]. His larger work, the ''[[Sistine Madonna]]'', used as a design for countless [[stained glass]] windows, has come, in the 21st century, to provide the iconic image of two small cherubs which has been reproduced on everything from paper table napkins to umbrellas.&lt;ref&gt;David Thompson, ''Raphael, the Life and Legacy'', (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Cuzin, ''Raphael, his Life and Works'', (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pala di San Zaccaria (Venezia).jpg|thumb|upright=1.40|[[Giovanni Bellini]], ''The [[San Zaccaria Altarpiece]]''|alt= Oil painting. A large altarpiece in which the Madonna sits on a raised throne, with four saints and an angel as described in the article.]] A leader of the [[Venetian school (art)|Venetian School]] of painting, [[Giovanni Bellini]] (1430-1516) was born within a year of his brother [[Gentile Bellini|Gentile]], his brother-in-law [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]] and [[Antonello da Messina]], but lived a decade longer than the first two and almost three decades longer than the latter.  He was painting right up until his death and his works illustrate several influences. His early works show the influence of Mantegna with incisive lines and clearly delineated colours&lt;ref&gt;Wundram pg. 120; Ruanch pg. 366&lt;/ref&gt; while after Messina's stay in Venice in 1475-1476 his works adopted a Flemish-like realism and luminous colours, which shows he was highly successful at adopting the techniques of oil painting brought by Messina.&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad pg. 655; Wundram pg. 120; Hartt pg. 563&lt;/ref&gt; He was first the teacher of [[Giorgione]]&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 388&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Titian]]&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 392&lt;/ref&gt; but was later influenced by Giorgione, most notably in adopting tonalism wherein paint is applied in superimposed layers creating a soft diffused effect so figures and landscapes become more unified in atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Mariolina"&gt;{{cite book|first=Mariolina |last=Olivari|chapter=Giovanni Bellini|title=Pittori del Rinascimento|publisher=Scala|location=Florence|year=2007|isbn=888117099X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Zuffi ''One Thousand Years of Painting'', Electa, Milan, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bellini became the only great 15th-century painter to cross the threshold from the Early Renaissance to the High Renaissance style with works such as ''[[Portrait of Doge Leonardo Loredan]]'' (1501),&lt;ref&gt; Wundrum Pag. 147 and Pg.121; Hartt, Pg. 645&lt;/ref&gt; wherein the Doge shows a calmness Bellini likely learned from Messina,&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 361&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Baptism of Christ (Bellini)|Baptism of Christ]]'' (1500–1502). Bellini, like [[Raphael]], also produced numerous small Madonnas in rich glowing colour, usually of more intense tonality than his Florentine counterpart. 

Traditionally, in the painting of altarpieces of the ''Madonna and Child'', the enthroned figure of the Virgin is accompanied by saints, who stand in defined spaces, separated physically in the form of a polytych or defined by painted architectural boundaries. [[Piero della Francesca]] used the Classical niche as a setting for his enthroned Madonnas (with saints grouped around the throne), as [[Masaccio]] had used it as the setting for his ''[[Holy Trinity (Masaccio)|Holy Trinity]]'' at [[Santa Maria Novella]]. 

Bellini used this same form, known as ''Sacred Conversations'', in several of his later altarpieces [[San Zaccaria Altarpiece|such as that]] for the Venetian church of [[San Zaccaria]] (1505). It is a masterful composition which uses tonalism and extends the real architecture of the building into the illusionistic architecture of the painting, making the niche a sort of [[loggia]] opened up to the landscape and to daylight which streams across the figures of the Virgin and Child, the two female saints and the little angel who plays a [[viola]] making them brighter than [[Saint Peter|Saint Peter]] and [[Saint Jerome|Saint Jerome]] in the foreground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Mariolina |last=Olivari|title=Giovanni Bellini|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Giorgione===

Despite the brevity of his career (he died in 1510 at about 35)&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad pg. 682; Hartt pg. 646&lt;/ref&gt; and the low number of works universally agreed to be totally by his hand (as low as 4 or 5),&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad pg. 682&lt;/ref&gt; Giorgione is often credited as being the founder of the Venetian High Renaissance style,&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 645; Raunch pg. 388; Stokstad pg. 682&lt;/ref&gt; although different scholars cite different reasons for asserting this. 

One is his increasing use of gradations of colour and light (colour modulation), including sfumato, often achieved by tonalism,&lt;ref name="Mariolina"&gt;{{cite book|first=Mariolina |last=Olivari|chapter=Giovanni Bellini|title=Pittori del Rinascimento|publisher=Scala|location=Florence|year=2007|isbn=888117099X}}&lt;/ref&gt; to define the shapes of figures and landscapes and to create an atmosphere wherein all components of the painting are unified.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 102; Wundram pg. 165; Raunch pg.646; Hartt pg. 646&lt;/ref&gt;  Some believe he may have been taught this by Leonardo da Vinci who is said to have visited Venice in 1501.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 102; Wundram pg. 148&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[Castelfranco Madonna]]'', 1505, the use of line and colour modulation are equally balanced but in ''[[The Tempest (Giorgione)|The Tempest]]'', c.1510, colour modulation almost entirely replaces line creating an artistic vision in which humankind and nature are combined.&lt;ref&gt;Wundram pg. 145 and pg. 165&lt;/ref&gt; Some consider the ''Tempest'' one of the most important paintings produced in Italy as the components are held together by colour and there is a dreamy atmosphere of perfect harmony.&lt;ref&gt; Raunch pg. 392&lt;/ref&gt; Giorgione was the first painter to assign a leading role to nature&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 103; Stokstad pg. 682; Raunch pg. 388)&lt;/ref&gt; and whenever his paintings feature a landscape it becomes an integral part of the painting.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 388; Hartt pg. 647; Stokstad pg. 682&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''[[Castelfranco Madonna]]'', when compared to Giovanni Bellini's similar The ''[[San Zaccaria Altarpiece]]'', illustrates another innovation of Giorgione - adjusting the directions and positions of the figures, such as the lance held by St. Liberale to the left and the folds in the Madonna's robe being placed in parallel, to more unify the subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 648; Luffi pg. 103&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, Giorgione's paintings are always ambiguous in their meaning and open to different interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 647; Raunch pg. 388&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Tempest (Giorgione)|The Tempest]]'', the naked woman feeding a baby and the clothed man, and a flash of lightning, perhaps represents [[Adam and Eve]] in their post-Eden days, or perhaps it does not.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 103&lt;/ref&gt; Another painting attributed to him, ''[[The Three Philosophers]]'', may represent the [[Magi]] planning their journey in search of the infant Christ, or it may not.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 102; Raunch pg. 388)&lt;/ref&gt;  None of Giorgione's paintings has ever had a certain interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 388&lt;/ref&gt; 

Until recent years, it had appeared certain that Giorgione painted the very first female nude that stands, or rather, lies, as a subject to be portrayed and admired for beauty alone with the ''[[Sleeping Venus (Giorgione)|Sleeping Venus]]'', 1510. While it had been long accepted that Titian finished the landscape of the painting after Giorgione's death, many art scholars are increasingly questioning if Giorgione painted the entire female body.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

===Titian===
[[File:Tizian 041.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Titian: ''[[Assumption of the Virgin (Titian)|Assumption of the Virgin]]''|alt= whose dynamic three-tier composition and colour scheme established him as the preeminent painter north of Rome.]]

[[Titian]] (c. 1490-1576) trained in the workshop of Giovanni Bellini alongside Giorgione and then assisted Giorgione.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 392; Stokstad pg. 684; Hartt pg. 647; Zuffi pg.128&lt;/ref&gt; Following Giorgione’s death, he was the monarch of the Venetian School for over 60 years.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 647; Zuffi pg. 128&lt;/ref&gt; His early work shows strong influences of Bellini and Giorgione,&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad pg. 684; Raunch pg. 392&lt;/ref&gt; but he soon he took the principles of form and colour announced by those two&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 647&lt;/ref&gt; and established colour, not line, as the major determinant in painting&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 647; Wundram pg. 176&lt;/ref&gt; thereby consummating the Venetian High Renaissance style.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 392&lt;/ref&gt; He did this by applying colours of paint paste-like in patches alongside each other with loose and sweeping brush strokes.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 393; Zuffi pg. 128&lt;/ref&gt; This brought out the light and colour in equal measure at the same time;&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 396&lt;/ref&gt; he was famous in his own day as the master of light and colour.&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad pg. 684&lt;/ref&gt;

Another strength of Titian was the composition of his paintings.&lt;ref&gt;(Wundram  pg. 176&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Pesaro Madonna]], 1519-1526, he moves the Madonna from the centre instead placing her at the upper vertex of a powerful diagonal line (as opposed to the usual vertical or horizontal) which still focuses the attention on the Madonna.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 393; Stokstad 684&lt;/ref&gt; This was one of the first works to group figures in an circular, ascending  structure.&lt;ref&gt;Wundram pg. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Assumption of the Virgin (Titian)|Assumption of the Virgin]], 1516-1518, also features diagonal lines (shaped by the cherubs located around the Virgin) which carries the triumphant message of the painting upward into the upper levels of the Church of Frari in Venice on whose altar it stands.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg.649&lt;/ref&gt; This work was the first to have visual suggestion of movement;&lt;ref&gt;Wundram pg. 152&lt;/ref&gt; all of Titian’s works have a new dynamism in the movements of people compared to the static elements of other High Renaissance painters.&lt;ref&gt;Wundram pg. 176; Raunch pg. 393&lt;/ref&gt; The Assumption of the Virgin also features, like all of his paintings, glowing, deep, rich colours due to Titian’s applying layer after layer of paint, sometimes of different colours.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 649; Stokstad pg. 685&lt;/ref&gt;  

Titian was also the most sought after portraitist of his time and brought portraiture to the same level of esteem as narrative painting.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 400&lt;/ref&gt; Highly notable are the ''[[Equestrian Portrait of Charles V]]'',1548, an equestrian picture in a symphony of purples, and the portrait of Doge [[Andrea Gritti]], ruler of Venice, perhaps Titian's most powerful portrait.  

As Titian aged, he maintained a generally High Renaissance style until his last years, when figure was almost completed dissolved in the movement of colour,&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 650&lt;/ref&gt; so he became increasingly isolated from the mainstream of Italian painting which had moved almost completely towards Mannerism by 1530.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 128&lt;/ref&gt; In many ways, Titian can be considered the founder of modern painting.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

===Correggio===

[[File:Cathedral (Parma) - Assumption by Correggio.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|Correggio:  ''[[Assumption of the Virgin]]]]

[[Correggio]] (1489-1534), who never visited Rome, but must have seen the works of the Raphael, Michelangelo and Titian, worked in a personal High Renaissance style in Parma in Northern Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 638; Raunch pg. 383&lt;/ref&gt; He invented the open heaven filled with floating figures church dome which became a hallmark of the 17th Century Baroque period with his [[Vision of St. John on Patmos|''Vision of St. John the Evangelist'']], 1520-1524, in Parma’s San Giovanni Evangelista, and the [[Assumption of the Virgin (Correggio)|''Assumption of the Virgin'']], 1526-1530, in Parma Cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 639; Raunch pg. 383; Stokstad pg. 681&lt;/ref&gt;  One art scholar states that in the latter, Correggio creates a “dazzling illusion:  the architecture of the dome seems to dissolve and the form seems to explode through the building drawing the viewer up into the swirling vortex of saints and angels who rush upwards to accompany the Virgin in to heaven.”&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad pg. 681&lt;/ref&gt;  

In those domes and other works, his bold use of perspective, usually by setting a dark colour against light colours to enhance the illusion of depth, is described as astonishing.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 638; Zuffi pg. 132; Raunch pg.383; Janson pg. 516&lt;/ref&gt; His chief interest was painting light and he anticipates the effects to be achieved by Caravaggio at the start of the next century.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 383&lt;/ref&gt; His mastery of foreshortening (causing objects to look shorter because they are angled to the viewer) to create perspective is described as perhaps the most skillful ever.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 383; Hartt pg. 638&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ''[[Jupiter and Io]]'', 1531-1532, Correggio painted a strong contrast between the luminous figure of Io and the soft but dark clouds filling the sky,&lt;ref&gt;Wundram pg. 174&lt;/ref&gt; which seem to envelop Io’s gleaming body.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 132&lt;/ref&gt; Correggio was able to execute the diffuse effect of clouds, haze or mist perfectly&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 383&lt;/ref&gt; and together with colour modulation infuses his characters with a distinct sense of weightlessness.&lt;ref&gt;Wundram pg. 174; Janson pg. 516&lt;/ref&gt;  He painted flesh in a delicate, voluptuous manner that has never been surpassed&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 639&lt;/ref&gt; and presents a new concept of feminine beauty only rediscovered during the Rococo period.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 383; Zuffi pg. 133&lt;/ref&gt; Correggio had many pupils but none carried on his style but he prefigured many components of Baroque painting.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 383; Janson pg. 518&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Significant High Renaissance Painters===

[[Andrea del Sarto]] (1486-1530), a Florentine, drew upon both Michelangelo and Raphael in his work, but went far beyond them in the portrayal of facial expressions and gestures, as evidenced in ''[[Madonna of the Harpies]]'',1517.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 341&lt;/ref&gt; His figures show a greater individuality than earlier High Renaissance works while losing none of the nobility.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 341&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1520s, he remained faithful to the ideals of the High Renaissance, such as in paintings’ compositions&lt;ref&gt;Wundram pg. 166&lt;/ref&gt; and with the faces of his figures usually being calm and often beautiful, showing none of the torment of his Mannerist contemporaries,&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 635&lt;/ref&gt; some of whom were his pupils.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 116&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Lorenzo Lotto]] (1480-1556), one of the most important High Renaissance painters in Venice,&lt;ref&gt;Wundrum pg. 724&lt;/ref&gt; also spent time in other areas of Northern Italy as, perhaps due to his greater focus on realist detail and on line than rather than colour compared to the Venetian school, he was not much appreciated in Venice.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 126; Raunch 398&lt;/ref&gt; While he painted a variety of subjects, he was an excellent portrait painter who had a superior ability to see into the soul of his subjects and to portray a depth of feeling in the painting.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch 398; Zuffi pg. 127&lt;/ref&gt; He usually included other objects in the background or foreground of the portrait to portray the subject's character.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 127; Raunch pg. 399&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Influence of Italian Renaissance painting==
The lives of both [[Michelangelo]] and [[Titian]] extended well into the second half of the 16th century. Both saw their styles and those of [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]], [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]], [[Giovanni Bellini]], [[Antonello da Messina]] and [[Raphael]]  adapted by later painters to form a disparate style known as [[Mannerism]], and move steadily towards the great outpouring of imagination and painterly virtuosity of the [[Baroque painting|Baroque]] period.

The artists who most extended the trends in Titian's large figurative compositions were [[Tintoretto]] and [[Veronese]], although Tintoretto is considered by many to be a Mannerist. [[Rembrandt]]'s knowledge of the works of both Titian and Raphael is apparent in his portraits. The direct influences of Leonardo and Raphael upon their own pupils was to effect generations of artists including [[Poussin]] and schools of Classical painters of the 18th and 19th centuries. Antonello da Messina's work had a direct influence on [[Albrecht Dürer]] and [[Martin Schongauer]] and through the latter's engravings, countless artists including the German, Dutch and English schools of [[stained glass]] makers extending into the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt;

Michelangelo's [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]] and later ''[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The Last Judgment]]'' had direct influence on the figurative compositions firstly of Raphael and his pupils and then almost every subsequent 16th-century painter who looked for new and interesting ways to depict the human form. It is possible to trace his style of figurative composition through [[Andrea del Sarto]], [[Pontormo]], [[Bronzino]], [[Parmigianino]], [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]], to [[el Greco]], [[Carracci family|Carracci]], [[Caravaggio]],  [[Rubens]], [[Poussin]] and [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]] to both the [[Classical Revival|Classical]] and the [[Romantic art|Romantic]] painters of the 19th century such as [[Jacques-Louis David]] and [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]].

Under the influence of the Italian Renaissance painting, many modern academies of art, such as the [[Royal Academy]], were founded, and it was specifically to collect the works of the Italian Renaissance that some of the world's best known art collections, such as the [[National Gallery, London]], were formed.

'''Karanpura''' is an archeological site near [[Bhadra, Rajasthan|Bhadra]] city of [[Hanumangarh district]] in [[Rajasthan]], [[India]]. It belongs with ancient [[Indus Valley Civilization]]. Harappan pottery has been found after excavation.

==Location==
Karanpura is located on Nohar-Bhadra road near [[Bhadra, Rajasthan|Bhadra]] city of [[Hanumangarh district]] of [[Rajasthan]], [[India]].Administrationally Karanpura is in Bhadra tehsil of Hanumangarh district of Rajasthan.
It is 8&amp;nbsp;km in the west from Bhadra and 125&amp;nbsp;km in the south-east from district headquarters Hanumangarh.  Other famous Harappan site of this district [[Kalibangan]] is about 120&amp;nbsp;km in the west from Karanpura.

==Excavation==
The excavation was done by a team under archeologist V N Prbhakar, archeological department of India, New Delhi.

The archeologists have found pottery and articles of Harappan period.&lt;ref name="skeleton found in exacavation at Karanpura"&gt;{{cite news|title=A skeleton of a child found at Karanpura|work=Rajasthan patrika newspaper ,SHRI GANGANAGAR EDITION |date=9 Jan 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Excavations discovered many mud brick houses from early Harappan(3300-2600 BCE) to mature Harappan (2600-1900 BCE) periods.

Within the site, Harappan pottery, terracotta bangles, grinding stone fragments, beads of agate, and a terracotta figurine have been excavated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=ANS|title=A Slice of Harappa Found in North Rajasthan|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-in-school/a-slice-of-harappa-found-in-north-rajasthan/article5004547.ece|website=The Hindu|publisher=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the artifacts discovered at the site, trade routes have been linked that reach as far as Afghanistan during the Harappan civilization. Despite being small in size compared to other Harappan sites, the ancient city was a major long-distance trading hub.

Within the site, a rare discovery of 4 complete rhino bones was found, suggesting that the surrounding area was inhabitable with rhino.

A copper mirror was also found at the site, a rarity in Harappan culture, but more evidence of their extensive trading.

Pottery preceding Harappan culture has also been found within the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jaipur|title=Artifacts Link Karanpura with Harappan Civilization|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/Artefacts-link-Karanpura-with-Harappan-civilization/articleshow/21663829.cms|website=The Times of India|publisher=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continuous findings within the site for up to 3 meters suggest a continuous occupation roughly since 2800 BCE.

Early Harappan findings of copper and lapis lazuli indicate long-standing acquisition and trade of raw materials up to the mature Harappan period. Steatite seals and an abundance of graffiti was also discovered within the mature Harappan portion of the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Prabhakar|first1=V. N.|last2=Jaseera|first2=C.

Terracota like pottery and bangles which are similar with findings at other Harappan sites were found. On January 2013 a skeleton of child has been found. Seals similar to other Harppan sites also has been found in 2013-2014.&lt;ref name="seals found at Karanpura"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://m.bhaskar.com/article/referer/521/t/240/MAT-RAJ-OTH-c-194-161415-NOR.html?1722|title=seals found at Karanpura|website=dainik bhaskar Hindi newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Linda Nochlin''' (''née'' '''Weinberg'''; January 30, 1931 – October 29, 2017) was an [[United States|American]] [[art historian]], Lila Acheson Wallace Professor Emerita of Modern Art at [[New York University Institute of Fine Arts]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/fineart/people/faculty/nochlin.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and writer. A prominent feminist art historian, she became well known for her pioneering 1971 article "[[Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?]]".&lt;ref name="artnews1971"&gt;Nochlin, Linda. "Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?" ''ARTnews'' January 1971: 22-39, 67-71.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Linda Natalie Weinberg was born the daughter of Jules Weinberg and Elka Heller (Weinberg) in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]]&lt;ref&gt;Chinese University of Hong Kong, [http://ihome.cuhk.edu.hk/~b102437/congress/biodata.html#linda Linda Nochlin]&lt;/ref&gt; and raised in the borough's [[Crown Heights, Brooklyn|Crown Heights]] neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Roberta. [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/obituaries/linda-nochlin-groundbreaking-feminist-art-historian-is-dead-at-86.html "Linda Nochlin, 86, Groundbreaking Feminist Art Historian, Is Dead"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 1, 2017. Accessed November 1, 2017. "She was born Linda Natalie Weinberg on Jan. 30, 1931, in Brooklyn and grew up in Crown Heights as a member of a wealthy extended family."&lt;/ref&gt; She attended Brooklyn Ethical Cultural School, a progressive grammar school.&lt;ref name="Nochlin, Linda née Weinberg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arthistorians.info/nochlinl|title=Nochlin, Linda née Weinberg|last=|first=|date=|website=Dictionary of Art Historians|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received her [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[Philosophy]] from [[Vassar College]] in 1951, her [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in [[English studies|English]] from [[Columbia University]] in 1952, and her [[Ph.D]] in the [[history of art]] from the [[Institute of Fine Arts]] at [[New York University]] in 1963.

==Academic career==
After working in the art history departments at [[Yale University]], the [[Graduate Center]] of the [[City University of New York]] (with [[Rosalind Krauss]]), and [[Vassar College]], Nochlin took a position at the [[Institute of Fine Arts]], where she taught until retiring in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Her critical attention was drawn to investigating the ways in which [[gender]] affects the creation and apprehension of art, as evidenced by her 1994 essay "Issues of Gender in Cassatt and Eakins".&lt;ref&gt;Nochlin, Linda. (1994). "Issues of Gender in Cassatt and Eakins" in ''Nineteenth Century Art: A Critical History,'' pp. 255-273.&lt;/ref&gt;  Besides feminist art history, she was best known for her work on [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]], specifically on [[Gustave Courbet]].

Complementing her career as an academic, she served on the Art Advisory Council of the [[International Foundation for Art Research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[International Foundation for Art Research]]|url=http://www.ifar.org/about.php|title=About IFAR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nochlin was the co-[[curator]] of a number of landmark exhibitions exploring the history and achievements of female artists. 
* 2007 &amp;mdash; "Global Feminisms" at the [[Brooklyn Museum of Art|Brooklyn Museum]].
* 1976 &amp;mdash; "Women Artists: 1550-1950" (with Ann Sutherland Harris) at the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]].

===Feminist art history===
In 1971, ''[[ArtNews]]'' published Nochlin's essay "[[Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?]]" in which she explored assumptions embedded in the title's question. She considered the very nature of art along with the reasons why the notion of artistic [[genius]] has been reserved for male geniuses such as [[Michelangelo]]. Nochlin argued that significant societal barriers have prevented women from pursuing art, including restrictions on educating women in art academies and "the entire romantic, elitist, individual-glorifying, and monograph-producing substructure upon which the profession of art history is based ".&lt;ref name="artnews1971"/&gt; The thirty-year anniversary of Nochlin's ground-breaking inquiry informed a conference at [[Princeton University]] in 2001. The book associated with the conference, "Women artists at the Millennium", includes Nochlin's essay ""Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?" Thirty Years After". In the conference and in the book, art historians addressed the innovative work of such figures as [[Louise Bourgeois]], [[Eva Hesse]], [[Francesca Woodman]], [[Carrie Mae Weems]] and [[Mona Hatoum]] in the light of the legacies of thirty years of feminist art history.

In her 1994 essay "Starting from Scratch: The Beginnings of Feminist Art History," Nochlin reflected on her awakening as a feminist and its impact on her scholarship and teaching: "In 1969, three major events occurred in my life: I had a baby, I became a feminist, and I organized the first class in Women and Art at Vassar College."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Broude|first1=edited by Norma|last2=al.]|first2=[[Mary D. Garrard]] ; contributors, Judith K. Brodsky ... [et|title=The power of feminist art : the American movement of the 1970s, history and impact|date=1996|publisher=H.N. Abrams|location=New York|isbn=0810926598|pages=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nochlin deconstructed art history by identifying and questioning methodological presuppositions.&lt;ref&gt;Nochlin, Linda. (1999). "Memoirs of an Ad Hoc Art Historian" in ''Representing Women,'' pp. 6-33.&lt;/ref&gt;  She was an advocate for "art historians who investigate the work before their eyes while focusing on its subject matter, informed by a sensitivity to its feminist spirit."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OOnqAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Representing+Women&amp;cd=8   "Book Overview,"] ''Representing Women.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Orientalism ====
[[File:Jean-Léon Gérôme - Le charmeur de serpents.jpg|thumb|The Snake Charmer]]Following [[Edward Said]]'s influential 1978 book, ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'', Nochlin was one of the first art historians to apply theories of [[Orientalism]] to the study of art history, specifically in her 1983 paper, "The Imaginary Orient."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Poetics and Politics of Place Ottoman Istanbul and British Orientalism.|last=Inankur,|first=Zeynep|publisher=Pera Museum Publications|year=2011|isbn=|location=Istanbul|pages=66|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Debating Orientalism|last=Elmarsafy|first=Ziad|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|year=2013|isbn=|location=UK|pages=184|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her key assertion was that Orientalism must be seen from the point-of-view of 'the particular power structure in which these works came into being,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Politics of Vision: Essays on Nineteenth-Century Art and Society|last=Nochlin|first=Linda|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=34|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in this case, 19th century French [[colonialism]]. Nochlin focused primarily on the 19th century French artists [[Jean-Léon Gérôme|Jean-Leon Gérôme]] and [[Eugène Delacroix]], who both depicted 'orientalist' themes in their work, including, respectively, [[The Snake Charmer]] and [[The Death of Sardanapalus]]. In Gérôme's "The Snake Charmer," from the late 1860s, Nochlin described how Gérôme created a sense of verisimilitude not only in his rendering of the scene with such realistic precision one almost forgets a painter painted it, but in capturing the most minute details, such as meticulously painted tiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Politics of Vision: Essays on Nineteenth-Century Art and Society|last=Nochlin|first=Linda|publisher=Harper and Row|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=37–38|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the painting appears to be documentary evidence of life in the Ottoman court while, according to Nochlin, it is in fact a Westerner's vision of a mysterious world. In Delacroix's "The Death of Sardanapalus" from 1827, Nochlin argued that the artist used Orientalism to explore overt erotic and violent themes that may not necessarily reflect France's cultural hegemony but rather the chauvinism and misogyny of early 19th century French society.&lt;ref name="Nochlin 1989 35–36"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Politics of Vision: Essays on Nineteenth-Century Art and Society|last=Nochlin|first=Linda|publisher=Harper and Row|year=1989|isbn=|location=New York City|pages=35–36|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Nochlin married twice. First, in 1953 she married Philip H. Nochlin, an assistant professor of Philosophy at Vassar, who died seven years later. She then married Richard Pommer, an architectural historian, in 1968.&lt;ref name="Nochlin, Linda née Weinberg" /&gt; Nochlin had two daughters: Jessica, with Philip Nochlin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Miss Nochlin Plans Wedding in August|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/19/style/miss-nochlin-plans-wedding-in-august.html|accessdate=26 June 2015|publisher=The New York Times|date=April 19, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Daisy, with Richard Pommer, who was depicted with Nochlin by the artist [[Alice Neel]] in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/linda-nochlin-and-daisy-36578 | title=Linda Nochlin and Daisy {{!}} Museum of Fine Arts, Boston | publisher=Museum of Fine Arts, Boston | accessdate=26 June 2015 | website=Linda Nochlin and Daisy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Professor Norman Gash.JPG|thumb|right|140px|Norman Gash]]'''Norman Gash''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CBE|FBA|FRSE|FRHistS|FRSL}}  (16 January 1912 in [[Meerut]], [[British Raj]] – 1 May 2009 in [[Somerset]]) was a British historian, notable for a two-volume biography of British prime minister [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]]. He was professor of modern history at the [[University of St Andrews]] from 1955–80 and specialised in the 19th century.

== Early life ==
Gash was born in [[Meerut]], [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh|United Provinces]] (now [[Uttar Pradesh]]) in 1912, the son of Frederick Gash, a soldier in the [[Royal Berkshire Regiment]], and of Kate Gash, ''née'' Hunt. He attended Wilson Road School and Palmer School in Reading, before gaining a scholarship to [[Reading School]]. He then attended [[St John's College, Oxford|St John's College, Oxford]] as a scholar, where he took a First in History in 1933. He subsequently completed a [[Bachelor of Letters|B.Litt.]] thesis on '‘The rural unrest in England in 1830 with special reference to Berkshire'.

==Biography of Sir Robert Peel==
The first volume of Gash's biography of Sir Robert Peel ''Mr Secretary Peel'' (1961) followed his life up until 1830, including his successful period at the Home Office in the 1820s and as far as [[Catholic Emancipation]]. The second volume ''Sir Robert Peel'' (1972) covered his opposition to the [[Reform Act 1832|Great Reform Act]] and his tenures as Prime Minister from 1834-5 and 1841-6. Gash argued that Peel's reforms were paramount in ending the "hungry forties" and bringing about Victorian prosperity. Though Gash's interpretations of Peel have been challenged in recent decades, by historians including [[Boyd Hilton]], this work remains the definitive Peel biography.

The '''Party Foundation Day''' is an annual [[Public holidays in North Korea|public holiday]] in [[North Korea]] marking the  10 October 1945 foundation of the "Central Organizing Committee of the Communist Party of North Korea", known as the "[[North Korea Bureau of the Communist Party of Korea|North Korea Bureau]] of the [[Communist Party of Korea]]" in the West and considered a predecessor to the ruling [[Workers' Party of Korea]].

Celebrations include political speeches, artistic performances and mass events including military parades. Ordinary citizens receive food rations and electricity.

The Party Founding Day is one of the most important holidays of the country, along with the [[Day of the Sun]] (birthday of [[Kim Il-sung]]), [[Day of the Shining Star]] (birthday of [[Kim Jong-il]]) and [[Day of the Foundation of the Republic (North Korea)|Day of the Foundation of the Republic]].&lt;ref name="Seoul2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Yonhap News Agency, Seoul|title=North Korea Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JIlh9nNeadMC&amp;pg=PA451|date=27 December 2002|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|isbn=978-0-7656-3523-5|pages=451–452}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2015 marked the 70th anniversary.

==Background==
[[File:Party Foundation Museum.jpg|thumb|The public hall where the founding conference was held now hosts the [[Party Founding Museum]].]]
North Korea commemorates 10 October 1945 as the date of the foundation of the "Central Organizing Committee of the Communist Party of North Korea",&lt;ref name="JoAn2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Am Jo|author2=Chol Gang An|title=Korea in the 20th century: 100 significant events|year=2002|location=Pyongyang|publisher=Foreign Languages Publishing House|oclc=276996886|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as the "[[North Korea Bureau of the Communist Party of Korea|North Korea Bureau]] of the [[Communist Party of Korea]]" by Western historians.&lt;ref name="Armstrong2013"/&gt;

On 10 October 1945 a meeting called "Conference of Korean Communist Party Members and Enthusiasts in the Five Northwestern Provinces" began in [[Pyongyang]],&lt;ref name="Armstrong2013"/&gt; in a public hall that now hosts the [[Party Founding Museum]].&lt;ref name="Corfield2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Corfield|first=Justin|title=Historical Dictionary of Pyongyang|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5zKWBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA159|date=1 December 2014|publisher=Anthem Press|isbn=978-1-78308-341-1|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 October, the meeting saw the establishment of the North Korea Bureau of the Communist Party of Korea. The conference was the first time that Kim Il-sung emerged as a political force.&lt;ref name="NK_This"/&gt; Kim advocated the foundation of the North Korea Bureau so that party activities could be overseen in the north of the country in a situation where the north and south were [[Division of Korea|occupied]] by the [[Soviet Civil Administration|Soviets]] and the [[United States Army Military Government in Korea|Americans]] respectively.&lt;ref name="Armstrong2013"&gt;{{cite book|first=Charles K.|last=Armstrong|title=The North Korean Revolution, 1945–1950|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eUf-_XACg3UC&amp;pg=PA58|date=15 April 2013|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0-8014-6879-5|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kim acceded the chairmanship of the North Korea Bureau some two months after the conference.&lt;ref name="NK_This"/&gt; The Bureau soon became independent of the [[Seoul]]-lead Communist Party of Korea,&lt;ref name="NK_This"/&gt; paving the way for a political force in the North.&lt;ref name="Armstrong2013"/&gt;

The North Korea Bureau is one in a series of predecessors to the present Workers' Party of Korea. The North Korea Bureau [[1st Congress of the Workers' Party of North Korea|evolved into]] the [[Workers' Party of North Korea]] in August 1946.&lt;ref name="NK_This"/&gt; The present Workers' Party of Korea was not founded until 30 June 1949 when the Workers' Party of North Korea [[History of the Workers' Party of Korea#Founding|merged with]] the [[Workers' Party of South Korea]].&lt;ref name="ency_Founding"/&gt;

==Celebrations== 
[[File:Party Foundation Monument (15362632418).jpg|thumb|A tour guide visiting the Monument to Party Founding in Pyongyang around the anniversary]]
Celebrations include song and dance performances, evening galas, speeches, lectures on revolutionary history and oratorical meetings.&lt;ref name="ency_Founding"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dail_Autu"/&gt; Floral tributes are laid in front of statues of Kim Il-sung.&lt;ref name="NK_This"&gt;{{Cite web | title = This Day in History: When Kim Il Sung Took Power | last = Gauthier|first=Brandon K. | publisher = NK News | date = 9 October 2012 | accessdate = 9 September 2015 | url = http://www.nknews.org/2012/10/this-day-in-history-when-kim-il-sung-took-power/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Special food rations are distributed.&lt;ref name="dail_Subd"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Subdued Atmosphere for Party Foundation Day | trans-title =  | author1 = Choi Song Min|author2=Kwon Hyo Jin | work = [[Daily NK]] | date = 11 October 2014 | accessdate = 9 September 2015 | url = http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?cataId=nk01500&amp;num=12407 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This usually includes foodstuffs that are normally in short supply, such as oil and snacks.&lt;ref name="dail_Food"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Food Distributed to Pyongyang on 66th | author = Lee Seok Young | work = dailynk.com | date = 14 October 2011 | accessdate = 11 September 2015 | url = http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?cataId=nk01500&amp;num=8285}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meat is available through the [[Public distribution system (North Korea)|public distribution system]].&lt;ref name="FordKwon2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Glyn|last2=Soyoung|title=North Korea on the brink: struggle for survival|url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/alltitles/docDetail.action?docID=10479620&amp;p96|year=2007|publisher=Pluto Press|isbn=978-1-84964-332-0|page=96|via=ProQuest ebrary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attendance in festivities in the capital is counted in the millions.&lt;ref name="WorldTradePress2010"&gt;{{cite book|title=North Korea Society and Culture Complete Report|url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/alltitles/docDetail.action?docID=10389224&amp;p05|year=2010|publisher=World Trade Press|location=Petaluma, CA, USA|isbn=978-1-60780-406-2|page=5|via=ProQuest ebrary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The celebrations have included occasional ceremonial visits of [[List of leaders of North Korea|North Korean leaders]] to the [[Kumsusan Palace of the Sun]]. The failure of [[Kim Jong-un]] to appear in 2014 intensified speculations of his lengthy absence. The tradition has not been very strong, as in comparison to Kim Jong-un, his father [[Kim Jong-il]] observed the same tradition only twice.&lt;ref name="Grisafi_2014"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nknews.org/2014/10/kim-jong-un-still-a-no-show-but-coup-unlikely/ |title=Kim Jong Un still a no-show, but coup unlikely |last=Grisafi |first=John G. |date=10 October 2014 |website= |publisher= |access-date=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Donga_2014"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.donga.com/srv/service.php3?biid=2014101165938 |title=Kim Jong Un fails to appear on Workers’ Party foundation day |date=11 October 2014 |website= |publisher= |access-date=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Performance art''' is a performance presented to an audience within a fine art context, traditionally [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]]. Performance may be either scripted or unscripted, random or carefully orchestrated, spontaneous or otherwise carefully planned with or without audience participation. The performance can be live or via media; the performer can be present or absent. It can be any situation that involves four basic elements: time, space, the performer's body, or presence in a medium, and a relationship between performer and audience. Performance art can happen anywhere, in any type of venue or setting and for any length of time. The actions of an individual or a group at a particular place and in a particular time constitute the work.

Performance art is an essentially contested concept: any single definition of it implies the recognition of rival uses. As concepts like "democracy" or "art", it implies productive disagreement with itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Carlson | first1 = Marvin | title = Performance: A Critical Introduction | publisher = Routledge | year = 1998 (first 1996) | location = London and New York | pages = 1, 2 | isbn = 0-415-13703-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The meaning of the term in the narrower sense is related to postmodernist traditions in Western culture. From about the mid-1960s into the 1970s, often derived from concepts of visual art, with respect to [[Antonin Artaud]], [[Dada]], the [[Situationist]]s, [[Fluxus]], [[installation art]] and [[conceptual art]], performance art tended to be defined as an [[antithesis]] to [[theatre]], challenging orthodox art forms and cultural norms. The ideal had been an ephemeral and authentic experience for performer and audience in an event that could not be repeated, captured or purchased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Parr | first1 = Adrian | title = Becoming + Performance Art | editors = Adrian Parr | work = The Deleuze Dictionary | publisher = Edinburgh University Press | year = 2005 | pages = 25, 2 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OsVOy4s1QLMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2010-10-26 | isbn = 0748618996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The widely discussed difference, how concepts of visual arts and concepts of performing arts are utilized, can determine the meanings of a performance art presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Carlson | first1 = Marvin | title = Performance: A Critical Introduction | publisher = Routledge | year = 1998 (first 1996) | location = London and New York | pages = 103–105 | isbn = 0-415-13703-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Performance art is a term usually reserved to refer to a [[conceptual art]] which conveys a content-based meaning in a more drama-related sense, rather than being simple performance for its own sake for entertainment purposes. It largely refers to a performance presented to an audience, but which does not seek to present a conventional theatrical play or a formal linear narrative, or which alternately does not seek to depict a set of fictitious characters in formal scripted interactions. It therefore can include action or spoken word as a communication between the artist and audience, or even ignore expectations of an audience, rather than following a script written beforehand.

Some kinds of performance art nevertheless can be close to performing arts. Such performance may utilize a script or create a fictitious dramatic setting, but still constitute performance art in that it does not seek to follow the usual dramatic norm of creating a fictitious setting with a linear script which follows conventional real-world dynamics; rather, it would intentionally seek to satirize or to transcend the usual real-world dynamics which are used in conventional theatrical plays.

Performance artists often challenge the audience to think in new and unconventional ways, break conventions of traditional arts, and break down conventional ideas about "what art is". As long as the performer does not become a player who repeats a role, performance art can include satirical elements; utilize robots and machines as performers, as in pieces of the [[Survival Research Laboratories]]; involve ritualised elements (e.g. [[Shaun Caton]]); or borrow elements of any [[performing arts]] such as dance, music, and [[circus (performing art)|circus]].

Some artists, e.g. the [[Viennese Actionism|Viennese Actionists]] and [[neo-Dada]]ists, prefer to use the terms "live art", "action art", "actions", "intervention" (see [[art intervention]]) or "manoeuvre" to describe their performing activities. As genres of performance art appear [[body art]], fluxus-performance, [[happening]], [[action poetry]], and [[intermedia]].

==Origins==
[[Image:Le Saut Dans le Vide.jpg|thumb|left|Conceptual work by [[Yves Klein]] at Rue Gentil-Bernard, Fontenay-aux-Roses, October 1960, photo by Shunk Kender. ''Le Saut dans le Vide'' (''Leap into the Void'')]]
Performance art activity is not confined to European or American art traditions; notable practitioners can be found in [[Asia]] and [[Latin America]]. Performance artists and theorists point to different traditions and histories, ranging from tribal to sporting and ritual or religious events. In an episode of ''[[In Our Time (BBC Radio 4)|In Our Time]]'' broadcast on Thu, 20 Oct 2005, 21:30 on BBC Radio 4, [[Angie Hobbs]], Lecturer in Philosophy, University of Warwick; [[Miriam Griffin]], Fellow of Somerville College, Oxford; and [[John Moles]], Professor of Latin, University of Newcastle discussed with [[Melvyn Bragg]] the idea that [[Antisthenes]] and [[Diogenes of Sinope|Diogenes]] in ancient Greece practiced a form of performance art and that they acquired the epithet of [[Cynicism (philosophy)|cynic]] which means "dog" due to Diogenes behaving repeatedly like a dog in his performances.

Western cultural theorists often trace performance art activity back to the beginning of the 20th century, to the [[Constructivism (art)|Russian constructivists]], [[Futurism|Futurists]] and [[Dada]]. Dada provided a significant progenitor with the unconventional performances of poetry, often at the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zurich)|Cabaret Voltaire]], by the likes of [[Richard Huelsenbeck]] and [[Tristan Tzara]]. [[Russian Futurist]] artists could be identified as precursors of performance, such as [[David Burliuk]], who painted his face for his actions (1910–20) and [[Alexander Rodchenko]] and his wife [[Varvara Stepanova]].

According to the art critic [[Harold Rosenberg]] in the 1940s and 1950s [[Action Painting]] gave artists the freedom to perform—the canvas as "an arena in which to act", thereby rendering the paintings as traces of the artist's performance in his/her studio. [[Abstract expressionism]] and [[Action painting]] preceded the [[Fluxus movement]], [[Happenings]] and the emergence of Performance Art.

Performance art was anticipated, if not explicitly formulated, by [[Japan]]'s [[Gutai group]] of the 1950s, especially in such works as [[Atsuko Tanaka (artist)|Atsuko Tanaka]]'s ''Electric Dress'' (1956).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/art/reviews/9937/|title=Everything Is Illuminated|website=NYMag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yves Klein]] had been a precursor of performance art with the conceptual pieces of ''[[Zone de Sensibilité Picturale Immatérielle]]'' (''Zones of Immaterial Pictorial Sensibility'') 1959–62, ''Anthropométries'' (1960), and works like the photomontage, Saut dans le vide (Leap into the Void). In the late 1960s [[Land art|Earth artists]] as diverse as [[Robert Smithson]], [[Dennis Oppenheim]], [[Michael Heizer]] and [[Carl Andre]] created environmental pieces that predict the performance art of the 1970s. Works of conceptual artists in the early 1980s, like [[Sol LeWitt]], who converted mural-style drawing into an act of performance by others, were influenced by Yves Klein and the Earth artists as well.

==1960s==
[[Image:Schneemann-Interior Scroll.gif|thumb|[[Carolee Schneemann]], performing her piece ''Interior Scroll.'' [[Yves Klein]] in [[France]], and [[Carolee Schneemann]], [[Yayoi Kusama]], [[Charlotte Moorman]], and [[Yoko Ono]] in [[New York City]] were pioneers of performance based works of art, that often entailed nudity.]]
In the 1960s a variety of new works, concepts and the increasing number of artists led to new kinds of performance art.  Prototypic for the artform later explicitly labeled "performance art", were works of artists like [[Yoko Ono]] with her ''Wall piece for orchestra'' (1962), [[Carolee Schneemann]] with pieces like ''Meat Joy'' (1964) and ''Interior Scroll'' (1975);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caroleeschneemann.com/interiorscroll.html]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wolf Vostell]] with his Happening ''YOU'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/you/|title=Media Art Net - Vostell, Wolf: YOU|first=Media Art|last=Net|date=12 April 2018|website=www.medienkunstnetz.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1964 in New York); [[Joseph Beuys]] with ''How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare'' (1965); [[Yayoi Kusama]], with actions such as a naked flag-burning on the Brooklyn Bridge (1968) and [[Allan Kaprow]] in his many ''Happenings''.

Kaprow had coined the term [[Happening]] describing a new artform, at the beginning of the 1960s. A ''Happening'' allows the artist to experiment with body motion, recorded sounds, written and spoken texts, and even smells. One of Kaprow's earliest was "Happenings in the New York Scene," written in 1961 as the form was developing.&lt;ref&gt;Montfort, Nick, and Noah Wardrip-Fruin. The New Media Reader. Cambridge, Massachusetts [u.a.: MIT, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Notably in the Happenings of Allan Kaprow, the audience members become performers. While the audiences in Happenings had been welcomed as the performers, it is only sometimes and often unwittingly that they become an active part in a Performance. Other artists who created Happenings besides Kaprow include [[Jim Dine]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Robert Whitman]], and [[Wolf Vostell]]: ''Theater is in the Street'' (Paris in 1958).

[[Hermann Nitsch]] in 1962 presented his "Theatre of Orgies and Mysteries" (Orgien- und Mysterien Theater), a precursor to performance art, close to the performing arts.

[[Andy Warhol]] during the early 1960s beginning to create films and video,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warholstars.org/andy_warhol_films.html|title=Andy Warhol Films|author=|date=|website=www.warholstars.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the mid-60s sponsored the [[Velvet Underground]] and staged events and performances in New York, like the [[Exploding Plastic Inevitable]] (1966) that featured live Rock music, exploding lights, and film.

Indirectly influential for art-world performance, particularly in the United States, were new forms of theatre, embodied by the [[San Francisco Mime Troupe]] and the [[Living Theatre]] and showcased in Off-Off Broadway theaters in SoHO and at [[La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club|La MaMa]] in New York City. The Living Theatre chiefly toured in Europe between 1963 and 1968, and in the U.S. in 1968. A work of this period, ''Paradise Now'' was notorious for its audience participation and a scene in which actors recited a list of social taboos that included nudity, while disrobing.

The work of performance artists after 1968 often showed influences of the cultural and political events of that year. [[Barbara T. Smith]] with ''Ritual Meal'' (1969) was at the forefront of the feminist body-, and performance art of the 1970s; among others including: [[Carolee Schneemann]], and [[Joan Jonas]]. Schneemann and Jonas along with [[Yoko Ono]], [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Nam June Paik]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[Allan Kaprow]], [[Vito Acconci]], [[Chris Burden]] and [[Dennis Oppenheim]] pioneered the relationship between ''[[Body art]]'' and performance art.

== 1970s ==
[[Image:BeuysAchberg78.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Beuys]], 1978: ''Jeder Mensch ein Künstler — Auf dem Weg zur Freiheitsgestalt des sozialen Organismus'' ("Every person an artist — On the way to the libertarian form of the social organism")]]
At the beginning of the 1970s, artists whose work already before tended to be a performance art, as well as new artists, began to present performance art in a stricter form.

New artists with radical performances were [[Chris Burden]], with the 1971 performance piece ''Shoot'', in which he was shot in his left arm by an assistant from a distance of about five meters, and [[Vito Acconci]] in the same year with ''[[Seedbed (performance piece)|Seedbed]]''.

The book ''[[Expanded Cinema]]'', by [[Gene Youngblood]], marked a shift in the use of media by performance artists. The first book considering video art as an art form, mentions [[Jud Yalkut]] as a pioneering video artist. Since 1965 he had collaborated in dozens of intermedia performances throughout the United States, also with [[Nam June Paik]], who beginning of the 1960s already had been a fluxus performer on the way to become a media artist. As to the art of Paik, Youngblood refers to works of Carolee Schneemann and [[Robert Whitman]] from the 1960s, which had been pioneering for performance art, becoming an independent artform at the beginning of the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Youngblood | first1 = Gene | title = Expanded Cinema | publisher = A. Dutton | year = 1970 | location = New York, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British-based pair [[Gilbert and George]], already in 1970, had documented actions of themselves on video, and created their "living sculpture" performance, being painted in gold and singing "Underneath The Arches" for extended periods. [[Joan Jonas]] began to include video in her experimental performances in 1972.

In 1973, [[Laurie Anderson]] performed ''Duets on Ice'', on the streets of New York City. [[Marina Abramović]], in the performance ''Rhythm 10'', conceptually included the violation of her body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/rhythm-10-2/ | title = Marina Abramović Rhythm 10 | accessdate = 2011-03-24 | publisher = Media Art Net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty years later, the theme of violation, shame, and sexual exploitation would be re-imagined in the contemporary performance works of artists such as  Clifford Owens,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gothamist.com/2012/03/09/this_sunday_ps1_may_or_may_not_host.php|title=This Sunday MoMA PS1 May Or May Not Host A "Performance Art Rape"|work=[[Gothamist]]|date=9 March 2012|first=Jen|last=Carlson|accessdate=16 August 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810231244/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/09/this_sunday_ps1_may_or_may_not_host.php|archivedate=10 August 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gillian Walsh, [[Pat Oleszko]] and [[Rebecca Patek]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/31/arts/dance/the-margins-of-a-form-are-increasingly-not-where-they-used-to-be.html?smid=fb-share&amp;_r=0 |title=The Margins of a Form Are, Increasingly, Not Where They Used to Be |work= [[The New York Times]]|date=30 July 2013|first=Gia|last=Kourlas|accessdate=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1973, the Feminist Studio Workshop at the [[Woman's Building]] in Los Angeles had a formative impact on the wave of performances with feminist background.

[[Carolee Schneemann]] work in 1963, ''Eye Body'', already had been a prototype of performance art. Schneemann in 1975 drew on with innovative solo performances, like ''Interior Scroll'', showing the female body as an artistic medium.

In the mid seventies, behind the iron curtain, in the Eastern European capitals: Budapest, Kraków, Belgrade, Zagreb, Novi Sad and other cities, the performing art was flourishing. Against the political and social control, emerged [[Orshi Drozdik]] performance series, titled ''Individual Mythology'' 1975/77 and the ''NudeModel'' 1976/77. Critical of the patriarchal discourse of art and the equally patriarchal state forced "emancipation program", pioneering feminist point of view on both, made her forerunner in the 70s political and artistic environment.

In 1976, [[HA Schult]] filled [[Piazza San Marco|St. Mark's Square]] in [[Venice]] with old newspapers in an overnight action he called ''Venezia vive.''&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Battcock and Robert Nickas, ''The Art of Performance: A Critical Anthology'' (Boston, MA: E.P. Dutton, 1984), pp. 330-31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Wines, ''De-Architecture'' (New York: Rizzoli International, 1987), p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1977 performance, "Crash", the same artist let a [[Cessna]] crash into the garbage dump on [[Staten Island]], New York.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Lucie-Smith, ''Art in the Seventies'' (Cornell University Press, 1980), p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Performance art, because of its relative transience, by the 1970s, had a fairly robust presence in the [[avant-garde]] of [[Eastern Bloc]] countries, especially [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].

Until the 1980s, performance art had been demystifying virtuosity. Now it began to embrace technical brilliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Banes | first1 = Sally | title = Subversive expectations: performance art and paratheater in New York, 1976–85 | publisher = The University of Michigan Press | year = 1998 | location = New York, New York | pages = 120, 1 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DdrVYfkAm6IC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=1980s+performance+art&amp;ct=result#v=onepage&amp;q=1980s%20performance%20art&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2011-03-23 | isbn = 0-472-09678-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reference to ''Presence and Resistance''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Auslander | first1 = Philip | title = Presence and Resistance: Postmodernism and Cultural politics in Contemporary American Performance | publisher = University of Michigan Press | year = 1992 | location = Ann Arbour | pages = 64–65, 78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Philip Auslander]], dance critic [[Sally Banes]] writes "... by the end of the 1980s, performance art had become so widely known that it no longer needed to be defined; [[mass culture]], especially television, had come to supply both structure and subject matter for much performance art; and several performance artists, including [[Laurie Anderson]], [[Spalding Gray]], [[Eric Bogosian]], [[Willem Dafoe]], and [[Ann Magnuson]], had indeed become crossover artists in mainstream entertainment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Banes | first1 = Sally | title = Subversive expectations: performance art and paratheater in New York, 1976–85 | publisher = The University of Michigan Press | year = 1998 | location = New York, New York | pages = 10, 1 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DdrVYfkAm6IC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=1980s+performance+art&amp;ct=result#v=onepage&amp;q=1980s%20performance%20art&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2011-03-23 | isbn = 0-472-09678-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the fact that many performances are held within the circle of a small art-world group, [[RoseLee Goldberg]] notes in ''Performance Art: From Futurism to the Present'' that "performance has been a way of appealing directly to a large public, as well as shocking audiences into reassessing their own notions of art and its relation to culture. Conversely, public interest in the medium, especially in the 1980s, stems from an apparent desire of that public to gain access to the art world, to be a spectator of its ritual and its distinct community, and to be surprised by the unexpected, always unorthodox presentations that the artists devise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0500203393|title=Performance Art: From Futurism to the Present|first=Roselee|last=Goldberg|date=1 June 2001|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the performance art most discussed in the art-world of this decade were a performance by [[Linda Montano]] and [[Tehching Hsieh]] between July 1983 and July 1984, ''Art/Life: One Year Performance'' (Rope Piece), and [[Karen Finley]]'s ''I'm an Ass Man'' 1987.

Until the decline of the European eastern block during the late 1980s, performance art had actively been rejected by most communist governments. With the exception of Poland and Yugoslavia, performance art was more or less banned in countries where any independent public event was feared. In the GDR, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Latvia it happened in apartments, at seemingly spontaneous gatherings in artist studios, in church-controlled settings, or covered as another activity, like a photo-shooting. Isolated of the western conceptual context, in different settings it could be like a playful protest or like a bitter comment, using subversive metaphors to express dissent with the political situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://perfomap.de/current/kart/reclaiming-the-invisible | title = Reclaiming the Invisible Past of Eastern Europe | accessdate = 2011-03-23 | last = Zajanckauska | first = Zane | author2 = Interview with Ieva Astahovska | publisher = map - media archive performance | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110416151339/http://perfomap.de/current/kart/reclaiming-the-invisible | archivedate = 2011-04-16 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 1982, [[Hedwig Gorski]] designated the term [[performance poetry]], to distinguish her text-based vocal performances from performance art, especially the work of performance artists, such as Laurie Anderson, who worked with music at that time. Performance poets relied more on the rhetorical and philosophical expression in their poetics than performance artists, who arose from the visual art genres of painting and sculpture.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

From 1981 to 1994, the Dutch visual artist [[PINK de Thierry]] created what she came to call meta-performances: a conceptual mix of intervention art in public space, performance art—interacting with an audience, installation art—utilizing large structures to perform in or with, and media art—photography and film to register and exhibit.

[[File:Trash People Roma 2007.JPG|thumb|''Trash People'' by [[HA Schult]], Rome, 2007]]
While the [[Soviet bloc]] disintegrated, formerly repressed activities of performance artists like [[György Galántai]] in Hungary, or the Collective Action Group in Russia, became better known. Young artists from all over the former Eastern bloc, including Russia, turned to performance. Performance art at about the same time appeared in Cuba, the Caribbean and China. Chinese performance artists like [[Zhang Huan]] had been performing underground since the late 1980s. In the early 1990s [[Chinese performance art]] already was acclaimed in the international art scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Montano | first1 = Linda M. | title = Performance artists talking in the eighties | publisher = University of California Press Berkeley | year = 2000 | location = Los Angeles, London | pages = 479, 1 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5Bl6wm-cV_oC&amp;pg=PA479&amp;dq=performance+art+1990s&amp;ct=result#v=onepage&amp;q=performance%20art&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2011-03-31 | isbn = 0-520-21022-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"In these contexts performance art became a critical new voice with a social force similar to that found in Western Europe, the United States and South America in the 1960s and early 1970s. It should be emphasized that the eruption of performance art in the 1990s in Eastern Europe, China, South Africa, Cuba, and elsewhere should never be considered either secondary to or imitative of the West."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Montano | first1 = Linda M. | title = Performance artists talking in the eighties | publisher = University of California Press University of California Press Berkeley | year = 2000 | location = Los Angeles, London | pages = 479, 2 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5Bl6wm-cV_oC&amp;pg=PA479&amp;dq=performance+art+1990s&amp;ct=result#v=onepage&amp;q=performance%20art&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2011-03-31 | isbn = 0-520-21022-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1996, [[HA Schult]] has installed one thousand life sized "Trash People" made from garbage as "silent witnesses to a consumer age that has created an ecological imbalance worldwide". They travelled to [[Moscow]]'s [[Red Square]] (1999), the [[Giza Necropolis|Pyramids of Giza]] (2002) and the [[Great Wall of China]] (2001).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IaIwmEh-OpsC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;lpg=&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Carlos Rojas, ''The Great Wall: A Cultural History''] (Harvard University Press, 2010), pp. 163-64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ina-Maria Greverus and Ute Ritschel, eds., ''Aesthetics and Anthropology: Performing Life, Performed Lives'' (Berlin: LIT Verlag, 2009), p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Kim Levin]], ''ARTnews'', volume=6, 2011, pp. 92-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second half of the decade, computer-aided forms of performance art began to take place.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Nate (2009), [https://arstechnica.com/web/news/2009/09/horrifically-bad-software-demos-become-performance-art.ars "Horrifically bad software demo becomes performance art"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since January 2003, Tate Modern in London has had a curated programme of live art and performance and in 2012 The Tanks at Tate Modern were opened: the first dedicated spaces for performance, film, and installation in a major modern and contemporary art museum.

From March 14 to May 31, 2010, the [[Museum of Modern Art]] held a major retrospective and performance recreation of [[Marina Abramović]]'s work, the biggest exhibition of performance art in MoMA's history.&lt;ref&gt;Kino, Carol (March 10, 2010).

'''Petar Georgiev Darvingov''' ({{lang-bg|Петър Георгиев Дървингов}}) was a [[Bulgaria|Bulgarian]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]], [[revolutionary]] and [[military historian]], corresponding member of [[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences]] from 1932.

==Biography==
Darvingov was born in [[Kukush]] (today Kilkis, [[Greece]]) in 1875. He graduated [[Bulgarian Men's High School of Thessaloniki|Bulgarian Men's High School in Solun (Thessaloniki)]] in 1892. He continued his education in the Military School in Sofia, graduated it in 1896 with honors and was promoted to the rank of [[lieutenant]].&lt;ref&gt;Дървингов, Петър. Избрани произведения, p. 5-6&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900 Darvingov was promoted to the rank [[first lieutenant]].

Darvingov joined [[Supreme Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Committee]] and in 1902, during the uprising in the region of [[Blagoevgrad|Gorna Dzumaya]] headed a military detachment. During the [[Ilinden uprising]] in 1903 Darvingov was a military organizer of the bands of [[IMORO]]. As [[voivode]] of the revolutionary district of [[Seres]] he fought in the region of [[Melnik, Bulgaria|Melnik]].

After the uprising Darvingov returned to [[Principality of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] and do a real service in the [[Bulgarian Army]]. In 1906 he was promoted in rank of ([[Captain (land)|captain]]). In 1909 he graduated military academy in [[Turin]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]]. On May 18, 1911 Darvingov was promoted to the rank of major and appointed assistant chief of the Intelligence Department in the headquarters of the Bulgarian Army. Darvingov took part in the [[First Balkan war]], as with the Order № 5 September 25, 1912 issued by the head of the headquarters of the army Major General [[Ivan Fichev]], Darvingov was appointed [[chief of staff]] of [[Macedonian-Adrianopolitan Volunteer Corps]]. On May 18, 1915 Darvingov was promoted to the rank [[lieutenant colonel]].&lt;ref&gt;Дървингов, Петър. Избрани произведения, p. 14-17, 20&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[First World War]] (1915-1918), Darvingov was an organizer and, in 1916, chief of staff of Eleventh Macedonian infantry division, completed by [[Macedonian Bulgarians|Bulgarians]] from [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. In May 1916 Darvingov as colonel was appointed commander of the 1st Regiment of the 11th Macedonian division. One year later he received the appointment of chief of staff of Moravian military region, which position remained to 1918. On August 15, 1917, he was promoted to the rank of [[colonel]].&lt;ref&gt;Дървингов, Петър. Избрани произведения, p. 21, 23&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 4, 1918, Darvingov was transferred to the reserve and was engaged in scientific and public activity. His research interests were related to military history. Darvingov's book "History of the [[Macedonian-Adrianopolitan Volunteer Corps|Macedonian-Adrianopolitan Volunteer Corp]]" (1919) is one of the first studies on a single Bulgarian military unit and still is regarded as the best work dedicated to the corps.

Darvingov was honorary president of the Association of Macedonian-Adrianopolitan volunteers, as well as president of the Society of the Bulgarian publicists and the Bulgarian Association of military writers.&lt;ref&gt;"Македонски преглед", том 26, София, Македонският научен институт, p. 116 ("Macedonian Review", issue 26, Sofia, Macedonian Scientific Institute)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Hart''' (11 November 1963 &amp;ndash; 22 July 2010) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] historian, specialising in modern [[Irish history]].

==Life==
Hart was born and raised in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. He studied for one year at the [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]] before moving to study at [[Queen's University]] in [[Kingston, Ontario]]. He graduated from there with an Honours [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] degree. Subsequently, Hart completed a master's degree in International Relations at [[Yale University]].

He then moved to Ireland to do [[PhD]] work at [[Trinity College, Dublin]]. His thesis was on the [[Irish Republican Army]] in [[County Cork]], an epicenter of the [[Irish War of Independence]], which was the basis of his first book, ''The IRA and its Enemies''. After completing his doctorate, Hart accepted a five-year teaching and research position at [[Queen's University Belfast]]. In 2003, having completed this contract, Hart moved back to Canada to take up the position of [[Canada Research Chair]] in Irish Studies at the Memorial University of Newfoundland. He was also an associate professor at Memorial University. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

In the 1990s he developed cancer and underwent a liver transplant - events which permanently affected his health. He suffered a brain haemorrhage early in July 2010 and died on 22 July 2010 in a St. John's hospital at the age of 46.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vocm.com/newsarticle.asp?mn=2&amp;id=7865&amp;latest=1 Notice of death of Peter Hart], vocm.com; accessed 11 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Hart published several books on what he termed the "Irish Revolution" of 1916–23, arguing that events like the [[Easter Rising]] (1916), the [[Irish War of Independence]] (1920–21) and the [[Irish Civil War]] (1922–23) were parts of a greater whole.&lt;ref&gt;See esp. 'A New Revolutionary History', in ''The I.R.A. at War 1916-1923'' (Oxford University Press, 2003), pp. 3-29.&lt;!-- publishing info, ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The first was published in 1998 entitled ''The IRA and Its Enemies, Violence and Community in Cork, 1916–1923'', being a study of the organisation's social composition and activity in [[County Cork]] during the War of Independence. This book won several awards, including the [[Christopher Ewart-Biggs Memorial Prize]] (1998). It attracted significant criticism, "le[ading] to almost as much conflict as the events" described.&lt;ref name=THES&gt;John Gill, [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=402611&amp;sectioncode=26 ''Troubles and strife as IRA historian draws peers' fire''], timeshighereducation.co.uk, 3 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Reisz, [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=419986 ''Between the lines of a tale of murder and motive''], timeshighereducation.co.uk, 24 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Justine McCarthy, ''An Uncivil War in Academia'', ''Sunday Times'' (Ireland), 10 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 Hart edited ''British Intelligence in Ireland 1920–21: the Final Reports'', a re-print of official British Government reports released to the British Public Records Office that detailed British military and intelligence analysis of policy during the Irish rebellion from 1919-1921.

''The I.R.A. at War 1916–1923'' (Oxford University Press, 2003), is a collection of essays on various social, political and military aspects of the IRA in these years. The publication represented, Hart wrote in its preface, "sixteen years' work on the history of the Irish revolution."

Hart contributed to the volume ''The Irish Revolution'' (2002), a collection of articles by various historians of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Joost Augusteijn, ''The Irish Revolution, 1913–1923'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2002; {{ISBN|0-333-98225-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hart's final published work was a biography of the Irish revolutionary leader [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], entitled ''Mick - The Real Michael Collins'' (Macmillan, 2006).

==Review and criticism==
''[[Times Higher Education]]'' suggested in 2008 that Hart's work "offers a revisionist version of events that proved highly controversial".&lt;ref name=THES/&gt; Hart denied he was a "[[Historical revisionism|revisionist]]", calling it "pejorative labelling".&lt;ref name=RIHresponse&gt;Peter Hart, [http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/paper/hartresp.html Author's response: The IRA at War 1916–1923], ''Reviews in History'', retrieved 29 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In his review of ''The IRA and its Enemies: Violence and Community in Cork, 1916–1923'', John M. Regan wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Hart is neither a [[Statism|statist]] nor a southern [[Irish Nationalism|nationalist]], though the influence of both ideologies can be traced though his work. His research on localised and specialised topics subverts orthodoxy, but it is his willingness to embrace it when dealing with general explanations which surprises. His exploration of the plight of Protestants in the Free State illuminates the sectarian underbelly of the revolution that a nationalist historiography prefers to ignore. In escalating violence in Cork, Tipperary, or Dublin could Michael Collins, Harry Boland, or Ernie O'Malley be held accountable for raising sectarian tensions in Antrim, Down or Belfast? Was the cost of a southern state the institutionalisation of ethno-religious tensions in a compressed and reactionary northern state? Could revolutionary violence in 1922 and 1968 conceivably be part of one grotesque, protracted process? To accept this argument would, however, be to shatter nationalist icons important to a southern nationalist identity still rooted in its own glorious revolution."&lt;ref name=RIHreview&gt;John Regan, [http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/paper/regan.html Book Review: The IRA at War 1916–1923], ''Reviews in History'', retrieved 29 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some of Hart's published claims attracted criticism from other historians and writers,&lt;ref name=THES/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;Diarmaid Fleming, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4043737.stm "'War of words' over battle"], BBC News, 26 November 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; including two incidents in ''The IRA and its Enemies''. One was the [[Kilmichael Ambush]] of 28 November 1920. Hart challenged the account of commander [[Tom Barry (soldier)|Tom Barry]] who stated the [[Auxiliary Division|Auxiliaries]] engaged in a false surrender that caused two IRA fatalities, after which Barry refused further surrender calls and ordered a fight to the finish without prisoners. Hart posited this never happened and alleged that Barry ordered the killing of all prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Barry, ''Guerrilla Days in Ireland'', 1949, pp. 40-46; Peter Hart, ''The IRA and its Enemies'', 1998, pp. 34-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hart claimed he personally interviewed two anonymous ambush veterans in 1988-89 and listened to recorded interviews with three further unnamed Kilmichael veterans. The recordings (known as 'the Chisholm tapes') were made in 1970 by Father John Chisholm as research for [[Liam Deasy]]'s ''Toward Ireland Free'' (1973).&lt;ref name="southernstar.ie"&gt;Niall Meehan, 
[http://www.southernstar.ie/article.php?id=846 "Kilmichael veteran's son challenges Hart"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721130634/http://www.southernstar.ie/article.php?id=846 |date=2011-07-21 }}, southernstar.ie'', 5 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Meda Ryan]], author of ''Tom Barry, IRA Freedom Fighter'' (2003), questioned Hart's claim to have interviewed two Kilmichael veterans in 1988 and 1989, claiming only one, Edward "Ned" Young, was still alive from 1987-89. Ryan reported him too ill to have contributed to Hart's research. This assertion was supported in an affidavit published in 2008 by Ned Young's son, John.&lt;ref&gt;Niall Meehan, Brian Murphy (OSB), [https://www.academia.edu/166387 "Troubled History - a Tenth Anniversary Critique of Peter Hart's The IRA and its Enemies"], academia.edu; accessed 11 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Ned Young died aged 97 on 13 November 1989. According to Ryan (and 1980s newspaper accounts)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/1080790 Niall Meehan, Reply to Jeffrey Dudgeon on Peter Hart], academia.edu; accessed 11 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The second last surviving Kilmichael veteran, Jack O'Sullivan, died in December 1986. However, Hart dated an additional interview with his second anonymous Kilmichael veteran on 19 November 1989, six days after Ned Young died. Hart claimed his interviewee was an unarmed ambush scout, although the last ambush scout, Dan O'Driscoll, reportedly died in 1967. The last dispatch scout, Seán Falvey, died in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Meda Ryan, ''Tom Barry, IRA Freedom Fighter'', Mercier, p. 69.&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Hart's earlier 1992 PhD thesis, on which his book is based, did not describe this 19 November 1989 interviewee as an unarmed scout. In his thesis, Hart described touring around the Kilmichael ambush site with this interviewee, a claim withdrawn from the book.&lt;ref&gt;Niall Meehan, [https://www.academia.edu/357237 "Distorting Irish History: the Stubborn Facts of Kilmichael"], pp. 13-14, academia.edu; accessed 11 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Niall Meehan, [https://www.academia.edu/8348624/ "Examining Peter Hart"], Field Day Review 10, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Niall Meehan, Head of the Journalism and Media Faculty in [[Griffith College]], Dublin, questioned Hart's claims with regard to the "Chisholm tapes", in a review of David Fitzpatrick (ed.), ''Terror in Ireland 1916-1923'' (2012). A chapter on the Kilmichael ambush by Eve Morrison was based partially on access to the tapes. She reported two (not three as Hart stated) Kilmichael veterans recorded in 1970 by Chisholm speaking on the ambush. One of these two was Ned Young. The other recorded interviewee, Jack O'Sullivan, spoke words which were misattributed by Hart to the ambush scout he claimed he interviewed on 19 November 1989. Meehan asserted that "this misattribution... further questions the existence of Hart’s 1988 and 1989 veteran interviews".&lt;ref&gt;David Fitzpatrick (ed.), [https://www.academia.edu/1871818 ''Terror in Ireland 1916-23'' (including responses from David Fitzpatrick and Eve Morrison)], p. 7, academia.edu; accessed 11 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also [https://www.academia.edu/1994527 Reply to Professor David Fitzpatrick and to Dr Eve Morrison's responses to criticism of ''Terror in Ireland 1916-1923'' (plus consideration of Dr Brian Hanley on "The Good Old IRA"), pp. 4-7, academia.edu; accessed 11 March 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The second controversy surrounds the [[Dunmanway killings]], in which thirteen Protestant men and boys were shot dead between 27–29 April 1922 during the truce. Hart wrote, "these men were shot because they were Protestant".&lt;ref&gt;Hart, ''IRA and its Enemies'', p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt; Others point to evidence suggesting that, while the IRA action was unauthorised, the men were targeted due to allegations they were informers, not because of their religion. Again, criticism centered on Hart's use of evidence. In his review of ''The IRA and its Enemies'' (The Month, September–October 1998) Brian Murphy noted Hart's citation of a British intelligence assessment in the Record of the Rebellion in Ireland that "in the south the Protestants and those who supported the Government rarely gave much information because, except by chance, they had not got it to give." Murphy pointed out that Hart had omitted the following sentence: {{quote|An exception to this rule was in the Bandon area where there were many Protestant farmers who gave information. Although the Intelligence Officer of the area was exceptionally experienced and although the troops were most active it proved almost impossible to protect those brave men, many of whom were murdered while almost all the remainder suffered grave material loss.&lt;ref&gt;In 'Peter Hart, the Issue of Sources', Brian Murphy (OSB), ''Irish Political Review'' Vol 20, No 7, reproduced in [https://www.academia.edu/166387 the 10th anniversary critique of Peter Hart's ''The IRA and its Enemies''], academia.edu; accessed 12 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As the April killings took place in "the Bandon area", Brian Murphy queried apparent suppression of evidence contradicting Hart's conclusion.

Hart stood by his work, stating that critics have failed to "engage with the book's larger arguments about the nature of the IRA and the Irish Revolution"&lt;ref name=THES/&gt; and believing they are closed to "a real debate where people concede some things and put forward others or are skeptical about weak points and accept the strong points."&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; Hart's last known interview was in a TG4 Irish language programme on Tom Barry, broadcast in January 2011. The programme had access to eight of nine Chisholm tapes (in total) and questioned Hart's use of anonymous sources and other claims.&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel Keogh, [http://www.thepost.ie/story/text/ojmhsnsngb TV Review], ''Sunday Business Post'', 23 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2011 book, ''Michael Collins and the Anglo-Irish War: Britain's Failed Counterinsurgency'', author [[J.B.E. Hittle]], a retired U.S. career intelligence officer-turned historian, acknowledged Hart's overall contribution in re-examining standard histories of the period, but concluded that Hart's [[historical method]] is "problematic". Hittle cited Hart's "overall naivete" about guerrilla warfare, in particular, what he viewed as Hart's underestimation of the importance of certain counterintelligence cases to the outcome of the war, as well as faulty methodologies.&lt;ref&gt;J.B.E.

'''Ray Huang''' ({{zh|t=黃仁宇|p=Huáng Rényǔ}}; 25 June 1918{{snd}}8 January 2000) was a Chinese [[historian]] and [[philosopher]]. He was an officer in the [[Kuomingtang|Nationalist]] army and fought in the [[Burma campaign]]s. He earned a Ph.D in history from the [[University of Michigan]], worked with [[Joseph Needham]] and is a contributor of Needham's ''[[Science and Civilisation in China]]''. Huang taught in the U.S., and is best known in his later years for the idea of [[macro-history]].

==Early life==
Ray Huang was born in [[Ningxiang]], [[Hunan|Hunan Province]], in 1918.&lt;ref name="黄仁宇 "/&gt; He was the oldest of three children. His father, Huang Zhenbai (黄震白), was an early member of the revolutionary group, [[Tongmenghui]], who became less active in the group over the years. Ray Huang grew up in Hunan and went to study [[electrical engineering]] at [[Nankai University]], [[Tianjin]] in 1936. At the outbreak of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in 1938, he returned to Changsha and wrote for the ''Anti-Japanese War Report'' (《抗日战报》).

Afterwards, he entered the [[Whampoa Military Academy|Republic of China Military Academy]] (中華民國陸軍官校) at [[Chengdu]], [[Sichuan]], graduating in 1940. He was appointed [[Second Lieutenant]] Platoon Leader in 1941; he was a staff [[First Lieutenant]] stationed in [[India]] in 1942, and a Staff [[Major]] in the [[New First Army]] in the [[China Burma India Theater of World War II|Burma theater]] from 1943-1945. While in Burma, he was shot through the thigh, but he made a complete recovery. After the war he attended the [[United States Army Command and General Staff College|American Army Staff College]] (graduating in 1947), and was aide-de-camp to the head of the Chinese military delegation participating in the Allied occupation of [[Japan]] from 1949-1950. However, with the loss of mainland China in 1949, the Nationalist army in Taiwan was purged of political opponents in 1950. Huang's superior in Japan was accused of Communist links and as a result, Huang was discharged from the Nationalist Army in 1950. His military career was over.

==Academic career==
Huang went to the United States to study [[Chinese History]]. At the University of Michigan, he received his [[Bachelor's degree]] in 1954, his [[Masters Degree]] in 1957 and his Doctorate in 1964. He was appointed Visiting [[Associate Professor]] at [[Columbia University]] in 1967, and a [[Professor]] at the [[State University of New York]], New Paltz Branch in 1968-1980. He was a research fellow at the [[Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies|Fairbank Center for East Asian Research]] at Harvard in 1970. He worked with the leading American [[Sinologist]] [[John K. Fairbank]]. Nevertheless, Huang and Fairbank disagreed in research methodology. Fairbank liked concentrated analysis in short time frames and limited areas, while Huang liked synthesis covering broad time periods (though Huang's classic work ''[[1587, a Year of No Significance]]'' had a very tight focus).

In 1972, Huang went to [[Cambridge University]] and assisted [[Joseph Needham]], who was more sympathetic to Huang's research approach, in Needham's monumental work on the history of Chinese science and technology. Huang's chosen field of study became financial administration in [[Ming China]], and he published one of his major works, ''[[Taxation and Finance in Sixteenth Century Ming China]]'', in 1974 (translated into Chinese only in 2001).

He returned to Cambridge in the mid 1970s, and contributed two chapters to the Ming Dynasty Volumes of ''[[The Cambridge History of China]]''. Around the late 1970s, he retired from teaching and focused on writing instead, even occasionally contributing to a column in ''[[Yazhou Zhoukan]]''. Nonetheless, he often travelled to Taiwan even after retirement to give lectures and participate in various academic exchanges.

His other works include ''The War in Northern Burma'' (1946), ''1587, a Year of No Significance'' (1981) (also published in Chinese as ''The Fifteenth Year of Wan Li''/[[:zh:萬曆十五年|《萬曆十五年》]], 1985), ''Broadening the Chinese Field of Vision'' (in Chinese, 1988), ''Chinese Macrohistory'' (1988) (in Chinese 1993), ''Conversations about Chinese History on the Banks of the Hudson River'' (in Chinese 1989), ''Discussions of Here and There and Old and New'' (in Chinese 1991), ''Capitalism and the Twenty First Century'' (in Chinese 1991), ''From a Macrohistory Perspective in Reading Jiang Jieshi's Diary'' (in Chinese 1993), ''Contemporary Chinese Outlets'' (in Chinese 1994), ''The Affair of Wan Chong'' (in Chinese 1998), ''Yellow River Blue Mountain: Record of Huang Renzi's Recollections'' (in Chinese 2001), and ''Bianjing Unfinished Dreams''.

==Personal life==
He married Gayle Bates (1937-2000) in 1966 and the two had a son, Jefferson, a longtime administrator at [[Claremont McKenna College]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cmc.edu/admission/admission-and-financial-aid-staff&lt;/ref&gt; as well as two other sons from his wife's previous marriage.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/jacksonsun/obituary.aspx?n=gayle-huang&amp;pid=144661905&lt;/ref&gt; He died of a [[heart attack]] in 2000.

Dr '''Robert Kerr''' [[FRSE]] FSA FRCSE (20 October 1757 – 11 October 1813) was a Scottish surgeon, writer on scientific and other subjects and translator.

==Life==
Kerr was born in 1757&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Thomas|last=Seccombe|authorlink=Thomas Seccombe|title=Kerr, Robert (1757–1813)|editor=McConnell, Anita|work=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/15466|edition=Online|accessdate=2016-02-18|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/15466}} {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Bughtridge, [[Roxburghshire]], the son of James Kerr, a [[jeweller]], who served as MP for Edinburgh 1747-1754,&lt;ref name="FRSE"&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his wife Elizabeth. He was sent to the High School in [[Edinburgh]].

He studied medicine at the [[University of Edinburgh]] and practised at the Edinburgh Foundling Hospital as a [[surgery|surgeon]]. He was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] in 1788. His proposers were [[Alexander Fraser Tytler]], James Russell and [[Andrew Dalzell]].&lt;ref name="FRSE" /&gt; At this time he lived at Foresters Wynd off the [[Royal Mile]] in Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1784-90&lt;/ref&gt;

He translated several scientific works into English, such as [[Antoine Lavoisier]]'s work of 1789, ''[[Traité Élémentaire de Chimie]]'', published under the title ''Elements of Chemistry in a New Systematic Order containing All the Modern Discoveries'', in 1790.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Antoine|last=Lavoisier|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30775|title=Elements of Chemistry|year=1790}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1792, he published ''The Animal Kingdom'', the first two volumes of a four-tome translation of [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus']] ''[[Systema Naturae]]'', which is often cited as the taxonomic authority for a great many [[species]]. (He never translated the remaining two volumes.)

In 1794 he left his post as a surgeon to manage a paper mill at [[Ayton, Scottish Borders|Ayton]] in [[Berwickshire]] which he had purchased. He lost much of his fortune with this enterprise. Out of economical necessity he began writing again in 1809, publishing a variety of minor works, for instance a ''General View of the Agriculture of Berwickshire''. His last work was a translation of [[Georges Cuvier|Cuvier's]] ''Recherches sur les ossements fossiles de quadrupedes'', which was published after Kerr's death under the title "Essays on the Theory of the Earth".

His other works included a massive historical study entitled ''A General History and Collection of Voyages and Travels'' in eighteen volumes.  Kerr began the series in 1811, dedicating it to Sir [[Alexander Cochrane]], K.B., [[Vice-Admiral of the White]].  Publication did not cease following Kerr's death in 1813; the latter volumes were published into the 1820s.

He died at home, Hope Park House&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1813&lt;/ref&gt;, east of the Meadows in Edinburgh, where he had lived since 1810, and is buried in [[Greyfriars Kirkyard]] in central [[Edinburgh]] against the eastern wall. His stone is added to a much earlier (1610) ornate stone monument. His son, David Wardrobe Kerr (1796-1815) lies with him.

'''Sergey Fyodorovich Platonov''' ({{lang-ru|Серге́й Фёдорович Плато́нов}}) (28 June [16 June, Old Style], 1860 &amp;ndash; 10 January 1933) was a [[Russia]]n historian who led the official [[St Petersburg]] school of imperial historiography before and after the [[October Revolution|Russian Revolution]].
==Life and career==
Platonov was born in [[Chernigov]] and attended a private gymnasium in St. Petersburg until 1878 when he went to the Department of History and Philology of St. Petersburg University until 1882. He was a student of [[Konstantin Bestuzhev-Ryumin]], who recommended that he be given the opportunity to "prepare to be a professor." 

Platonov belonged to the "St. Petersburg school" of Russian historiography, which paid special attention to the study and publication of historical sources. Platonov gained his master's thesis in 1888 writing about Old Russian Legends and Tales About the Seventeenth-Century Time of Troubles as a Historical Source for which he gained the [[Uvarov Award]] of the Academy of Sciences.

Platonov's scholarly career was centered on the [[University of St Petersburg]], where he was held in highest repute for his detailed studies of the ''[[Time of Troubles]]'' (1923) and [[Oprichnina]]. Platonov's history textbooks, impeccably written and easily readable, enjoyed such popularity that he was asked by the tsar to teach history to his children. In 1909, he was admitted to the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]].

Unlike some of his disciples (such as [[Alexander Presnyakov]]), Platonov did not change his views after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Revolution]] and stood aloof from the mainstream [[Marxist]] historiography, as represented by [[Mikhail Pokrovsky]]. Nevertheless, he was permitted to administer the [[Archaeographic Commission]] in 1918-29, the [[Pushkin House]] (i.e., the Russian Literature Institute) in 1925–1929 and the Academy's Library in 1925–1928. 

On 12 January 1930 Platonov was accused of taking part in [[Industrial Party Trial|a royalist conspiracy]], arrested and exiled to [[Samara, Russia|Samara]], where he died three years later. Most of his books were republished after the downfall of the Soviet regime.

The '''Stolpersteine in Prague-Podolí''' lists the [[Stolpersteine]] in the district [[Podolí (Prague)|Podolí]] of [[Prague]]. Since 2002, the district belongs to Praha 4. Stolpersteine is the German name for stumbling blocks collocated all over Europe by German artist [[Gunter Demnig]]. They remember the fate of the Nazi victims being murdered, deported, exiled or driven to suicide.

Generally, the stumbling blocks are posed in front of the building where the victims had their last self chosen residence. The name of the Stolpersteine in Czech is: ''Kameny zmizelých'', stones of the disappeareds.

&lt;small&gt;The list is sortable; the basic order follows the alphabet according to the last name of the victim.&lt;/small&gt;

| Bedřich Kaufmann was born on 25 November 1911 in Prague. His first name is also written Bedrikh or in the German version Friedrich. He was the son of Hugo Kaufmann and Olga née Ehrmann. He had two younger brothers: Robert (born 1913) and Hanuš (born 1917). He was a merchant. On 4 December 1941 he was deported from Prague to [[Theresienstadt concentration camp]] by transport J. His number on this transport was 194 of 1,000. On 18 December 1943 he was deported to [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] by transport Ds. His number on this transport was 474 of 2,503. His inmate number in Auschwitz, tattooed on the left arm, was 85587. When the [[Red Army]] approached Auschwitz in early 1945, most inmates of the KZ were sent on [[Death marches (Holocaust)|death marches]] toward west. The group in which Kaufmann had to march was later called the ''Hungermarsch'' by one of the inmates, Friedrich Kraj. It was geared toward Theresienstadt. When exhausted inmates — without enough food, without proper cloths, without proper shoes — broke down they were shot by the SS. On 23 April 1945, when the group reached the Khaatal near [[Schwarzheide]], Bedřich Kaufmann was murdered by the Nazi regime.&lt;ref&gt;holocaust.cz: ''[http://www.holocaust.cz/en/database-of-victims/victim/97964-bedrich-kaufmann/ BEDŘICH KAUFMANN]'', retrieved on 27 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[The Central Database of Shoah Victims' Names]]: ''[https://yvng.yadvashem.org/nameDetails.html?language=en&amp;itemId=1289497&amp;ind=1 BEDRICH KAUFMANN]'', retrieved on 27 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[The Central Database of Shoah Victims' Names]]:''[https://yvng.yadvashem.org/nameDetails.html?language=en&amp;itemId=511791&amp;ind=2 BEDRIKH KAUFMANN]'', retrieved on 27 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Khaatal &gt;''[http://ametas.homepage.t-online.de/gg/khaatal.htm Im schönen Khaatal ...]'', retrieved on 27 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Most sources mention the 25 April 1945 as the day when Kaufmann died.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1265">'''Subreption''' is a concept in [[Roman law]] and, in this tradition, [[Canon law]]. In this context, [[obreption and subreption]] belong together. The Latin word for subreption is "subreptio", the German is "Erschleichung".

In German philosophy, the concept was used by [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)]] and [[Immanuel Kant]] to denounce illegitimate claims to empiricity of representations: I can perceive the formation of my will to lift my arm, and I can perceive the lifting of my arm. To say that I know empirically that my will lifted my arm would be a subreption in Wolff's sense. 

The Latin phrase for the philosophical concept of subreption is ''vitium subreptionis'' (''vitium'': fault, crime, error; ''subreptionis'': creep, stealth, fraud).  The German is a literal translation of this Latin phrase: "Fehler der Erschleichung".  It can also mean in general a creeping or [[tacit assumption]](s) that is not explicitly given but is hidden either purposefully (as in sophistry) or not (as in a visual illusion).

[[Image:Investiture of Ali Edinburgh codex.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Hadith of the pond of Khumm|Investiture of Ali at Ghadir Khumm]] (MS Arab 161, fol. 162r).]]
[[Image:Maome.jpg|thumb|249px|Muhammad prohibiting Nasīʾ ([[sura 9]]:36f.), fol. 5v. of the 17th century copy (MS Arabe 1489), corresponding to fol. 6v of the Edinburgh codex.]]
'''''The Remaining Signs of Past Centuries''''' ({{lang-ar| کتاب الآثار الباقية عن القرون الخالية }} ''{{transl|ar|Kitāb al-āthār al-bāqiyah `an al-qurūn al-khāliyah}}'', also known as '''''Chronology of Ancient Nations''''' or '''''Vestiges of the Past''''', after the translation published by [[Eduard Sachau]] in 1879) by [[Al-Biruni|Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī]], is a comparative study of [[calendar]]s of different cultures and civilizations, interlaced with mathematical, astronomical, and historical information, exploring the customs and religions of different peoples.

Completed in 1000 AD (AH 390/1), it is Al-Biruni's first major work, compiled in [[Gorgan]], at the court of [[Shams al-Mo'ali Abol-hasan Ghaboos ibn Wushmgir|Qabus]], when he was in his late twenties.&lt;ref name="Seyyed Hossein Nasr 1993 p. 108"&gt;Seyyed Hossein Nasr, ''An Introduction to Islamic Cosmological Doctrines'' (1993), {{ISBN|0-7914-1515-5}}, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The text survives in an early 14th-century [[Ilkhanid]] manuscript by Ibn al-Kutbi (the "Edinburgh codex", AH 707 / AD 1307–8, 179 folios, Northwestern Iran or northern Iraq,&lt;ref&gt;The precise place of origin is uncertain. Soucek 1975, p. 156, suggested [[Tabriz]] or [[Maragha]]; Carboni (1988–89,17; 1992, 432f., suggested [[Mosul]] on the basis of a comparison of some of its illustrations with others in the so-called London Qazvini (cat. nos. 14–16). Hillenbrand  supports the attribution to Mosul.&lt;/ref&gt; kept at the [[Edinburgh University Library]], MS Arab 161). The manuscript contains 25 paintings and survives also in an exact 17th-century Ottoman copy (MS Arabe 1489, kept in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]).

Hillenbrand (2000) interprets the choice and placement of illustrations throughout the text as a cycle which emphasizes the interest of the Ilkhanids in religions other than the predominant Islam, many illustrations showing specific episodes related to [[Manichaeism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Judaism]], and [[Christianity]]. Other illustrations show a keen interest in topics of history and science. The account of the birth of [[Julius Caesar]] is illustrated with a realistic rendition of a [[cesarean section]].

The [[Shi`ite]] inclination of those responsible for the production is particularly evident from the two concluding images, the largest and most accomplished in the manuscript, which illustrate two episodes in the life of [[Muhammad]], both centrally involving [[`Ali]], [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hasan]], and [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husayn]]:  The Day of Cursing (fol. 161r) and The Investiture of `Ali at [[Ghadir Khumm]] (fol. 162r). The manuscript has a total of five images [[depictions of Muhammad|depicting Muhammad]], including the first miniature which shows the Prophet as he prohibits [[Nasīʾ]] (fol. 6v).&lt;ref&gt;The cycle is among the earliest depictions of Muhammad in Persian art. The earliest extant representation of Muhammad in a Persian manuscript is in the [[Marzubannama]] of 1299 (Archaeology Museum Library, Istanbul, MS 216);  see fig. 49 in Marianna Shreve Simpson. 'The Role of Baghdad in the Formation of Persian Painting.' In ''Art et société dans le monde iranien'', ed. Chahryar Adle,  91–116. Institut Français d'Iranologie de Téhéran, Bibliothèque iranienne, 26. Recherche sur les grandes civilisations, Synthèse, 9. Paris: Éditions Recherche sur les civilisations, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

The style of the images is kept in a hybrid style between that of pre-Mongol period Persia and the Chinese style introduced with the Mongol invasions.

He discussed his idea of [[history]] in ''The Chronology of the Ancient Nations'',&lt;ref name=Khan&gt;M. S. Khan (1976). "al-Biruni and the Political History of India", ''Oriens'' '''25''', p. 86-115.&lt;/ref&gt; also known as ''The Remaining Signs of Past Centuries''. It is a comparative study of calendars of different cultures and civilizations, interlaced with mathematical, astronomical, and historical information, exploring the customs and religions of different peoples.

In ''The Chronology Of Ancient Nations'',&lt;ref&gt;Albiruni. The Chronology Of Ancient Nations, trans.Edward Sachau. London: Elibron Classics, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; he mentions the birth and death of the [[Caliph]]s, [[Shia Imam]]s, [[Fatimah]] (daughter of Muhammad) and [[Khadija bint Khuwaylid|Khadija]] (Muhammad's wife).&lt;ref&gt;The Chronology Of Ancient Nations, trans.Edward Sachau.

This is a '''timeline of first orbital launches by country'''. While a number of countries have built [[satellite]]s, as of 2018, eleven [[countries]] have had the capability to send objects into [[orbit]] using their own [[launch vehicle]]s. [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]] inherited the space launchers and satellites capability from the [[Soviet Union]], following its dissolution in 1991. Russia launches its rockets from its own and foreign ([[Kazakhstan|Kazakh]]) [[spaceport]]s. Ukraine launched only from foreign (Russian and Kazakh) launch facilities until 2015, after which political differences with Russia effectively halted Ukraine's ability to produce orbital rockets. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2015/12/zenit-swansong-elektro-l-launch/|title=Zenit successfully launches on likely swansong with Elektro-L - NASASpaceFlight.com|website=Nasaspaceflight.com|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://euromaidanpress.com/2017/01/10/dnipro-will-not-let-ukraines-space-glory-be-forgotten/|title=Dnipro will not let Ukraine’s space glory be forgotten|first1=About the Source Olena Makarenko Olena Makarenko is a journalist at Euromaidan Press In|last1=2014|first2=Olena started working as a volunteer on public initiatives focusing on building civil|last2=society|first3=promoting dialog between people from different regions of|last3=Ukraine|date=10 January 2017|website=[[Euromaidan Press]]|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[France]] became a space power independently, launching a payload into orbit from [[Algeria]], before joining space launcher facilities in the multi-national [[Ariane (rocket family)|Ariane]] project. The [[United Kingdom]] became a space power independently following a single payload insertion into orbit from [[Australia]], before discontinuing official participation in space launch capability, including the Ariane project, in the 1970s.

Thus, {{as of|2018|lc=on}}, nine countries and one inter-governmental organisation ([[European Space Agency|ESA]]) currently have a proven orbital launch capability,&lt;ref name=ACT group=lower-alpha /&gt; and two countries (France, UK) formerly had such an independent capability. In all cases where a country has conducted independent [[human spaceflight]]s (as of 2017, three - Russia, USA,  and China), these launches were preceded by independent unmanned launch capability.

The race to launch the first satellite was closely contested by the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]], and was the beginning of the [[Space Race]]. The launching of satellites, while still contributing to national prestige, is a significant economic activity as well, with public and private rocket systems competing for launches, using cost and reliability as selling points.

{{Reflist|group=lower-alpha}}

==Other launches and projects==
The above list includes confirmed satellite launches with rockets produced by the launching country. Lists with differing criteria might include the following launches:

===Failed launches===
*{{flagcountry|Brazil}} has yet to launch a satellite into orbit independently and its [[Brazilian space program|space program]] suffered three satellite launch failures, the latest being the [[2003 Alcântara VLS accident|explosion]] of a [[VLS-1]] rocket on 22 August 2003 at the [[Centro de Lançamento de Alcântara|Alcântara Launch Centre]], which resulted in 21 deaths.

===Launches of non-indigenous launch vehicles===
Some countries have no self-developed rocket systems, but have provided their spaceports for launches of their own and foreign satellites on foreign launchers:
*{{flagcountry|Algeria}} with the first successful launch from [[Hammaguir]] of the French satellite [[Astérix (satellite)|Astérix]] on 26 November 1965 by French [[Diamant|Diamant A]]. The last orbital launch from Hammaguir was on 15 February 1967 by French Diamant A and there are no further launches scheduled (the first Algerian satellite is [[AlSAT-1]] launched by Russian [[Kosmos-3M]] from [[Plesetsk Cosmodrome|Plesetsk]], Russia on 28 November 2002).
*{{flagcountry|Italy}} with the first successful launch from the [[San Marco platform]] of its satellite [[San Marco 2]] on 26 April 1967 by US [[Scout (rocket family)|Scout B]] (the first Italian satellite is [[San Marco 1]] launched by another Scout from [[Wallops Flight Facility|Wallops]], USA on 15 December 1964). The last orbital launch from San Marco was on 25 March 1988 by US Scout G-1 and there are no further launches scheduled.
*{{flagcountry|Australia}} with the first successful launch from [[Woomera Test Range]] of its first satellite [[WRESAT]] on 29 November 1967 by US [[Sparta (rocket)|Sparta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/sites/woomera.htm|title=Woomera, Encyclopedia Astronautica|website=Astronautix.com|accessdate=9 August 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030084529/http://www.astronautix.com/sites/woomera.htm|archivedate=30 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second and final successful orbital launch from Woomera was performed on 28 October 1971 by the UK [[Black Arrow]] and there are no further launches scheduled.
*{{flagcountry|Kazakhstan}} with the first launch after its independence from the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]]{{refn|Currently its [[Baikonur Cosmodrome Site 250|Bayterek]] expansion to accommodate the Russian [[Angara (rocket family)|Angara]] rockets is delayed into 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.tengrinews.kz/science/Bayterek-system-launch-shifted-to-2017-834/|title=Bayterek system launch shifted to 2017|website=Tengrinews.kz|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} on 21 January 1992 of the Russian [[Soyuz-U2]] and [[Progress M-11]] (the first Kazakh satellite is [[KazSat]] launched by Russian [[Proton-K]] from Baikonur on 17 June 2006). Currently the spaceport continues to be utilized for launches of various Russian and Ukrainian rockets.
*{{flagcountry|Spain}}; a single [[Pegasus (rocket)|Pegasus-XL]] was launched from [[Orbital Sciences]]' ''[[Stargazer (aircraft)|Stargazer]]'' aircraft flying from [[Gran Canaria Airport]] in April 1997.
*{{flagcountry|Marshall Islands}} with a successful launch of a [[Pegasus (rocket)|Pegasus-H]] rocket from [[Orbital Sciences]]' ''[[Stargazer (aircraft)|Stargazer]]'' aircraft flying from [[Kwajalein Atoll]] in October 2000. Five ground-based launches were made by [[SpaceX]] using [[Falcon 1]] rockets between 2006 and 2009, with the first success on 28 September 2008.&lt;ref name="SpaceXmanifest"&gt;[http://www.spacex.com/launch_manifest.php SpaceX Launch manifest] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414160626/http://www.spacex.com/launch_manifest.php |date=April 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three further Pegasus launches occurred between 2008 and 2012, using the Pegasus-XL configuration. Currently there are no plans announced for a Marshall Islands satellite.

*{{flagcountry|USA}} American private company [[Rocket Lab]] successfully launched its [[Electron (rocket)|Electron]] rocket from [[Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1|Mahia Launch Center]] in [[New Zealand]] on January 21st, 2018 carrying three cubesats into low earth orbit. This was the first time that a rocket entered orbit after launching from a privately owned and operated spaceport.

===Abandoned projects===
*{{flagicon|Nazi Germany}}/{{flagcountry|Germany}} was developing larger designs in the [[Aggregat (rocket family)|Aggregat series]] as early as 1940. A combination of A9 to A12 components could have produced orbital capability as early as 1947 if work had continued. Further preliminary development of numerous rocket space launchers and re-usable launch systems ([[Eugen Sänger|Sänger II]], etc.) took place after WWII, although these were never realized as national or European projects. Also, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the private German company [[OTRAG]] tried to develop low-cost commercial space launchers. Only sub-orbital tests of the first prototypes of these rockets were carried out.
*{{flagcountry|UK}} did not proceed with a 1946 proposal to develop German [[V-2]] technology into the "Megaroc" system to be launched in 1949.
*{{flagcountry|Canada}} had developed the gun-based space launchers Martlet and GLO as the joint Canadian-American [[Project HARP]] in the 1960s. These rockets were never tested.
*{{flagcountry|RSA}} developed the space launcher [[Shavit#South African RSA Series|RSA-3]] in the 1980s. This rocket was tested 3 times without a satellite payload in 1989 and 1990. The program was postponed and canceled in 1994.
*{{flagicon|Iraq|1963}} [[Iraq]] claimed to have developed and tested "Al-Abid", a three-stage space launch vehicle without a payload or its upper two stages on 5 December 1989. The rocket's design had a clustered first stage composed of five modified [[Scud|scud rockets]] strapped together and a single scud rocket as the second stage in addition to a [[S-75 Dvina|SA-2]] liquid-fueled rocket engine as the third stage. The video tape of a partial launch attempt which was retrieved by [[United Nations Special Commission|UN weapons inspectors]], later surfaced showing that the rocket prematurely exploded 45 seconds after its launch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thespacereview.com/archive/1498.pdf UNMOVIC report], United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission, p. 434 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/nuke/guide/iraq/deception.htm|title=Deception Activities|website=Fas.org|accessdate=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b14643.de/Spacerockets_1/Rest_World/Al_Abid/Description/Frame.htm|title=Al-Abid LV|website=B14643.de|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Satellite operators===
Many [[Satellite#First satellites of countries|other countries]] have launched their own satellites on one of the foreign launchers listed above (the first being the British owned and operated, although American-built satellite [[Ariel 1]], was launched by a US rocket in April 1962. In September 1962 the Canadian satellite, [[Alouette-1]], was launched by a US rocket, but unlike Ariel 1 it was constructed by Canada.

'''Transit Center at Manas''' (formerly '''Manas Air Base''' and unofficially '''Ganci Air Base''') is a former U.S.&amp;nbsp;military installation at [[Manas International Airport]], near [[Bishkek]], the capital of [[Kyrgyzstan]]. It was primarily operated by the [[U.S.&amp;nbsp;Air Force]]. The primary unit at the base was the [[376th Air Expeditionary Wing]]. On 3 June 2014 American troops vacated the base and it was handed over back to the [[Military of Kyrgyzstan|Kyrgyzstan military]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.eurasianet.org/node/68430| title =U.S. Formally Closes Its Kyrgyzstan Air Base|publisher =[[Eurasianet]]|author=Joshua Kucera| accessdate =17 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The base was opened in December 2001 to support U.S.&amp;nbsp;military operations in the ongoing [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war in Afghanistan]]. It had hosted forces from several other [[International Security Assistance Force]] member states as well. The base was a transit point for U.S.&amp;nbsp;military personnel coming and going from Afghanistan. The base had good recreation facilities for airmen, soldiers, sailors, and Marines (internet cafes, wireless internet, pool tables, free video games, telephones to [[Defense Switched Network|DSN&amp;nbsp;lines]] that allow a coalition forces to call their homes at little or no cost). The base had a large dining facility, gymnasium, and a chapel. There was also a library where books and magazines were available for active duty airmen.

Several events, such as the shooting of a local civilian and rumors of fuel dumping, had led to strained relations with some of the local population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kucera|first=Joshua|title=US Armed Forces Try to Win Hearts and Minds|publisher=EurasiaNet|date=4 December 2007|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav120407a.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; Powers such as Russia and China had been pushing for the closure of the base since 2005.&lt;ref name=sco&gt;{{cite news|last=Kimmage|first=Daniel|title=SCO: Shoring Up the Post-Soviet Status Quo|publisher=EurasiaNet|date=9 July 2005|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/pp070905.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, the Kyrgyz Parliament voted to close the base after the two governments failed to agree on a higher rent for the property.&lt;ref name=bloom&gt;{{cite news|last=Pronina|first=Lyubov|title=Kyrgyzstan to Close U.S. Air Base Used for Afghan War|publisher=Bloomberg|date=3 February 2009|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&amp;sid=a45p.N1wLfyo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|title=US troops ordered out of Kyrgyzstan after Russia deal|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/kyrgyzstan/4513296/US-troops-ordered-out-of-Kyrgyzstan-after-Russia-deal.html|date=4 February 2009|accessdate=4 February 2009 | location=London | first=Adrian | last=Blomfield}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vote&gt;{{cite news|title=Kyrgyz MPs vote to shut US base|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7898690.stm|date=19 February 2009|accessdate=19 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; American and Kyrgyz officials continued negotiations after the announcement, and on 23 June a tentative agreement was reached.

Before the handover to the Kyrgyz military, Kyrgyz forces handled security in the areas surrounding the facility, while American forces provided security for the facility, and the site was then called a "transit center" instead of an "air base".&lt;ref name=nytdeal&gt;{{cite news|last=Schwirtz|first=Michael|title=In Reversal, Kyrgyzstan Won’t Close a U.S. Base |publisher=New York Times|date=23 June 2009|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/24/world/asia/24base.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
[[File:U.S. Air Force — Manas Air Base, Kyrgyzstan (cap).JPG|thumb|Cap inscribed "U.S. Air Force — Manas Air Base, Kyrgyzstan"]]
The installation was initially named after New York Fire Department Chief [[Peter J. Ganci,&amp;nbsp;Jr.]], who was killed in the [[11 September attacks|11 September terrorist attack]].&lt;ref name=gs2&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/manas.htm |title=Manas International Airport |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |accessdate=2014-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The all-ranks club/recreation center on base was known as "Pete's Place" in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manas.afcent.af.mil/news/commentaries/story.asp?storyID=123087146 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208222611/http://www.manas.afcent.af.mil/news/commentaries/story.asp?storyID=123087146 |date=8 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the [[U.S.&amp;nbsp;Air Force]] had used the name "Ganci", it was found that an Air Force Instruction&amp;nbsp;(AFI) dictated that non-U.S.&amp;nbsp;air bases could not bear the name of any U.S.&amp;nbsp;citizens (the former [[Clark Air Base]] in the Philippines pre-dated this instruction). Since that time the air base has been officially called Manas Air Base, after the name of [[Manas International Airport]] where it is located.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

The name "Manas" refers to the [[Epic of Manas]], a world-renowned [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]] [[epic poem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?RL=49 |title=UNESCO Culture Sector - Intangible Heritage - 2003 Convention : |publisher=Unesco.org |accessdate=2014-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The facility was renamed "Transit Center at Manas" following a new agreement between the U.S. and Kyrgyz governments, signed in June&amp;nbsp;2009. Most English-language sources, however, continue to refer to it as "Manas Air Base".

The Transit Center at Manas International Airport is a transportation and logistics hub established to support international efforts to bring peace and stability to Afghanistan.

The Center opened on 16 December 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manas.afcent.af.mil/library/factsheets/index.asp |title=Transit Center at Manas - Fact Sheets |publisher=Manas.afcent.af.mil |date=2001-12-16 |accessdate=2014-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313003805/http://www.manas.afcent.af.mil/library/factsheets/index.asp |archivedate=13 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then it has hosted forces from [[Australia]], [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[South Korea]], [[Spain]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], and the United States.

An agreement between the U.S.&amp;nbsp;Government and the Government of Kyrgyzstan permitting use of Manas International Airport as a Transit Center was concluded in May&amp;nbsp;2009, entered into force on 14 July 2009, and was ratified by the Parliament of Kyrgyzstan on 25 June 2009. It dictates that the United States and Kyrgyzstan must consult on all matters pertaining to the Mansas Transit Center, including [[environmental protection]], health and human safety, and local procurement. The United States assists Kyrgyzstan with the upkeep and maintenance of the airport. Given the importance of the Transit Center for ongoing international military operations in Afghanistan, the United States has agreed to provide $60&amp;nbsp;million per year in quarterly installments for use of the airport and facilities for the Transit Center and as reimbursement for mutually agreed logistics support. All payments are made directly to the Government of Kyrgyzstan.

The U.S.&amp;nbsp;Embassy in Bishkek&lt;ref&gt;[http://bishkek.usembassy.gov/transit_center_at_manas2.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820041722/http://bishkek.usembassy.gov/transit_center_at_manas2.html |date=20 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the U.S.&amp;nbsp;military continue to work closely with the Government of Kyrgyzstan to ensure that operations at the Transit Center are consistent with the terms of the Agreement. U.S.&amp;nbsp;military personnel at the Transit Center are mindful of the needs of the local community and contribute to humanitarian efforts in Kyrgyzstan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manas.afcent.af.mil/news/humanitarian-assistance.asp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625215535/http://www.manas.afcent.af.mil/news/humanitarian-assistance.asp |date=25 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S.&amp;nbsp;airmen from the Transit Center recently visited an orphanage at Krasnorechenskaya Boarding School to deliver food and clothing.

==Operation Enduring Freedom==
On 18 December 2001, the 86th&amp;nbsp;Contingency Response Group out of [[Ramstein Air Base]] in Germany arrived at Manas to open the airfield for military use as part of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]].&lt;ref name=gs/&gt;

U.S. [[close air support]] aircraft deployed there included [[U.S.&amp;nbsp;Air Force]] [[F-15E]]s and [[U.S.&amp;nbsp;Marine Corps]] [[F-18]]s. In February 2002, a detachment of [[French Air Force]] [[Dassault Mirage 2000D]] ground attack aircraft and [[KC-135]] air-refueling tankers deployed to Manas in support of ground forces in [[Afghanistan]] as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. In March of the same year, the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] stationed two B707 air-to-air refueling aircraft at the base. It was also deployed an [[C-130]] [[Royal Norwegian Air Force|Norwegian]] in early 2002 which were withdrawn in October&amp;nbsp;2002 when a tri-national detachment, known as European Participating Airforces&amp;nbsp;(EPAF) of a total of 18&amp;nbsp;F-16s, 6 from the [[Royal Danish Air Force|Danish]], 6 from the [[Royal Netherlands Air Force|Dutch]] and 6 from the [[Royal Norwegian Air Force|Norwegian]] [[F-16]] multirole aircraft took the place of the Mirages. Support for the new aircraft came in the form of one Netherlands [[KDC-10]] [[Aerial refueling|tanker]], and several American KC-135s, which remain assigned to this day. At the same time it was deployed two Spanish Superpuma rescue helicopter from the Army Aviation and at least 2&amp;nbsp;Spanish&amp;nbsp;C-130s. Several of the servicemen from this unit were killed in an air crash on their way home from the base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.euroresidentes.com/Blogs/2004/06/spanish-military-air-crash-in-turkey.html |title=News from Spain: Spanish military air crash in Turkey - families given wrong bodies |publisher=Euroresidentes.com |date=2004-06-25 |accessdate=2014-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313002314/http://www.euroresidentes.com/Blogs/2004/06/spanish-military-air-crash-in-turkey.html |archivedate=13 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The unofficial nickname to this base is "The Gateway to Hell", as many that pass through the base are on their way to combat.  That said, it was also appreciated by the Marines coming out of Helmand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://exitstrategyafghanistan.blogspot.com.au/2015/12/month-12-day-30_15.html |title=Month 12 Day 30 |publisher=Exit Strategy |date=2013-08-30 |accessdate=2016-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ISAF support==

In September 2004, the Royal Netherlands Air Force again returned with 5x&amp;nbsp;F-16 fighter/bomber to provide Close Air Support (CAS) for the [[ISAF]] mission, which now encompassed both Kabul and Northern Afghanistan. To supplement the small availability of tanker aircraft, a RNLAF KDC-10 was also deployed which flew regularly to supply Dutch F-16s with fuel. At that time, the Spanish Airforce was also giving support with a single C-130. The Dutch, commanded by LtCol Bob "Body" Verkroost, remained until the presidential elections of 9 October 2004 elected Hamid Karzai as president of Afghanistan. The last F-16&amp;nbsp;mission was flown on 19 November 2004 at which time the F-16s were withdrawn to their homebase of [[Volkel Airbase]] in the Netherlands, while the KDC-10 flew the personnel back to [[Eindhoven Airport]]. The Dutch returned with F-16s to the Afghan theatre in 2005 but at that time began operating out of [[Kabul Airport]].

==Recent events==
The [[Tulip Revolution]] of March&amp;nbsp;2005 led to the toppling of Kyrgyz president [[Askar Akayev]]. However, American and allied personnel did not find themselves disrupted or affected, according to international news reports. One military member even indicated, "It's been business as usual...We did not miss a single flight."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2005/04/01/002.html|title=Business as Usual at U.S. Base in Kyrgyzstan|author=Christian Lowe|publisher=Reuters|date=1 April 2005|accessdate=20 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2006, Kyrgyzstan's new president, [[Kurmanbek Bakiyev]], threatened to expel U.S. troops if the United States would not agree by 1 June to pay more for stationing forces in the Central Asian nation. He later withdrew this threat.

On 6 September 2006, U.S.&amp;nbsp;Air Force officer [[Jill Metzger|Maj. Jill Metzger]] went missing after being separated from her group while visiting a shopping center in Bishkek. She was found three days later in the nearby city of [[Kant, Kyrgyzstan|Kant]]. Metzger claimed to have escaped from kidnappers, though U.S.&amp;nbsp;officials noted "serious inconsistencies" in her account. The Air Force confirmed in February&amp;nbsp;2012 that Metzger had indeed been kidnapped as she had claimed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schogol|first=Jeff|title=Air Force confirms Metzger kidnapped in 2006|url=http://www.airforcetimes.com/news/2012/03/air-force-confirms-metzger-kidnapped-2006-031912/|accessdate=13 August 2012|newspaper=Air Force times|date=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===December 2006 shooting===
[[File:Refueling of a C-5 Galaxy.JPEG|thumb|right|220px|A C-5 Galaxy cargo plane being refuelled by a [[KrAZ]] tanker truck at Manas after arriving from [[Ramstein Air Base]].]]
On 6 December 2006, U.S.&amp;nbsp;serviceman Zachary Hatfield fatally shot Alexander Ivanov, a Kyrgyz civilian, at a truck checkpoint at the base. A statement from the base stated the airman "used deadly force in response to a threat at an entry control checkpoint".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16072996/|title=U.S. troops quizzed after Kyrgyz man shot dead|author=|agency=Associated Press|date=7 December 2006|accessdate=20 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ivanov, a truck driver for Aerocraft Petrol Management, was waiting to finish the security check before proceeding into the U.S.-controlled area. According to a base spokesman, "As the airman approached the tent, the driver physically threatened him with a knife which was discovered at the scene. The airman drew his 9mm weapon and fired in self-defense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2006/12/ed4eb5c6-2a9a-497c-a4d1-be89f9d68d82.html|title=Kyrgyz Man Shot By U.S. Soldier Is Buried|author=|publisher=RFE/RL|date=8 December 2006|accessdate=20 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hatfield fired two shots into Ivanov's chest, killing him.

The killing drew widespread condemnation from Kyrgyz authorities and they quickly demanded that Hatfield's immunity from local prosecution be revoked. In the meantime, U.S. authorities agreed to have Hatfield remain in Kyrgyzstan until the matter is resolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2006/12/13a53d4b-b2be-4944-9efd-adfeaae535eb.html|title=Kyrgyzstan Wants U.S. Soldier's Immunity Lifted In Wake Of Shooting|author=|publisher=RFE/RL|date=7 December 2006|accessdate=20 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another issue to come out of the shooting was that of the compensation offered to Ivanov's family. His employer offered the family $50,000 while the U.S.&amp;nbsp;government offered only around $2,000. Galina Skripkina, a lawyer representing Ivanov's widow, described the U.S.&amp;nbsp;offer as "humiliating" and said that if it was not increased the family would take legal action. However, the U.S.&amp;nbsp;embassy stated that this amount was an interim payment and that final compensation would be determined once the investigation into the shooting was concluded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airforcetimes.com/news/2007/03/apkyr070312/|title=Family of man shot at Manas offered $2,000|author=|publisher=Air Force Times|date=12 March 2007|accessdate=20 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While making statements of regret about the incident, the airman was quickly transported back to the United States. More detailed data about the hearings on the Hatfield case were published in late December 2010 via the web site Russian Reporter, which issued a series of dispatches from the State Department and U.S. embassies, supposedly originating from the WikiLeaks archive. In one of them, dated July 2009, the State Department provided a briefing to the U.S. Embassy in Bishkek regarding the case of Hatfield. It recommended communication with the Kyrgyz authorities in respect of the incident. Hatfield was subject to "administrative measures", details of which are not disclosed in the dispatch. "Junior Sergeant Hatfield was subject to severe administrative measures against him, which will have long-term effects and negatively affect his career," the dispatch promised. But criminal charges against Hatfield never went to a military court. According to the dispatch, the officer authorized to initiate court-martial was General Arthur Lichte, a commander at the airbase, who, "after reviewing the report of the Article 32 investigation and considering the advice of his staff judge advocate...dismissed the charge against SrA Hatfield," the dispatch states. It said that Lichte had ruled for a non-prosecution based "on his own professional and impartial judgment of the facts of the case and the evidence that was available." The reasons for Lichte’s decision were not explained in the dispatch. "Under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, a convening authority generally does not explain his or her rationale for a referral decision, so as to preserve the impartiality and independence of the military justice system", explained the dispatch. The paper reports that General Lichte was given the power of referral because he was not previously involved in the investigation of the case, nor in the chain of command relating to SrA Hatfield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kloop.info/2011/02/27/tsc-the-case-of-the-u-s-soldier-who-shot-a-kyrgyzstani-driver-never-went-to-court/|title=tsc-the-case-of-the-u-s-soldier-who-shot-a-kyrgyzstani-driver-never-went-to-court|author=|publisher=kloop|date=25 February 2011|accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009 threat of closure and restructuring===
[[File:ManasVote.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Russian news coverage of the vote to close Manas Air Base in the Kyrgish Parliament.]]
On 3 February 2009, Kyrgyzstan's President [[Kurmanbek Bakiyev]] announced that Manas Air Base would soon be closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rian.ru/defense_safety/20090203/160879889.html|script-title=ru:Киргизия закрывает авиабазу США в Манасе|date=3 February 2009|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bakiyev said that economic considerations and the negative public attitude towards the base contributed to the decision.&lt;ref name=RT&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.russiatoday.com/news/news/36774|title=Kyrgyzstan to shut down NATO's air base|publisher=Russia Today|date=3 February 2009|accessdate=3 February 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206075956/http://russiatoday.com/news/news/36774|archivedate=6 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bill calling for the closure of the base and the eviction of U.S.&amp;nbsp;forces was passed by the [[Supreme Council of Kyrgyzstan|Kyrgyz parliament]] by a vote of 78 to one on 19 February 2009.&lt;ref name=vote/&gt; The following day, 20 February, an official eviction notice was delivered to the U.S.&amp;nbsp;Embassy in Bishkek, according to the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Kyrgyzstan)|Kyrgyzstan Ministry of Foreign Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The United States Receives Formal Air Base Eviction Notice|publisher=EurasiaNet|date=20 February 2009|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/news/articles/eav022009.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The news of the base's closure followed the announcement of a new agreement between Russia and Kyrgyzstan in which Kyrgyzstan will receive $2&amp;nbsp;billion in loans and $150&amp;nbsp;million in financial aid from Russia.&lt;ref name=FT&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8d9e47de-f227-11dd-9678-0000779fd2ac.html|title=Kyrgyzstan to shut US military base|publisher=Financial Times|date=3 February 2009|accessdate=4 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most observers see the two events as connected, and believe that Russian financial assistance was offered on the condition that U.S. forces were expelled from Kyrgyzstan.&lt;ref name=lessons&gt;{{cite news|last=Rahmetov |first=Anvar|title=Tracking Russia's Assistance Package to Bishkek|publisher=EurasiaNet|date=18 February 2009|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insightb/articles/eav021809.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brinkley|first=Joel|title=Why is Russia bribing Kyrgyzstan?|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|date=22 February 2009|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/02/21/INNN15VE8O.DTL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Levy|first=Clifford|title=Poker-Faced, Russia Flaunts Its Afghan Card|publisher=New York Times|date=21 February 2009|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/22/weekinreview/22levy.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news|last=Thompson|first=Mark|title=Obama Loses a Key Base for Afghanistan|publisher=Time Magazine|date=19 February 2009|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1880686,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2009, the U.S. government provided $150 million in aid annually to Kyrgyzstan.&lt;ref name=lessons/&gt; According to General [[David Petraeus]], head of [[U.S. Central Command]], around $63 million of that sum is directly connected to the base.&lt;ref name=close&gt;{{cite news|last=Trilling|first=David|author2=Deirdre Tynan |title=President Bakiyev Wants to Close US Military Base Outside Bishkek|publisher=EurasiaNet|date=3 February 2009|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insightb/articles/eav020309b.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; The larger Russian package is viewed by some analysts as an effort to "out-bid" the Americans.&lt;ref name=lessons/&gt;

Referring to the closure of Manas Air Base, [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] spokesman [[Geoff S. Morrell]] directly accused Russia of "attempting to undermine [American] use of that facility".&lt;ref name=FT/&gt; U.S. [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert Gates]] also said that, "The Russians are trying to have it both ways with respect to Afghanistan in terms of Manas. On one hand you're making positive noises about working with us in Afghanistan, and on the other hand you're working against us in terms of that airfield which is clearly important to us."&lt;ref name=time/&gt; However Russian President [[Dmitry Medvedev]] distanced his country from the announcement, saying that it was "within the competence of the Kyrgyz Republic" to decide how the Manas base functioned.&lt;ref name=FT/&gt;

On 23 June 2009 a new deal was reached between the U.S. and Kyrgyz governments. It was ratified by the Kyrgyz parliament two days later, and signed into law by President Bakiyev on 7 July.&lt;ref name=reudeal&gt;{{cite news|title=Kyrgyz parliament approves U.S. base deal|publisher=Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSTRE55O1DP20090625|date=25 June 2009|accessdate=25 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kyrgyz leader approves US deal for Manas base|agency=Associated Press|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5goSq-Hk4_xi9Fm7sI4SLjpc5neiwD999ITMO0|date=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the terms of the new agreement, U.S.&amp;nbsp;payment for use of the facilities will increase from $17.1&amp;nbsp;million to $60&amp;nbsp;million. An additional $117&amp;nbsp;million will be given to the Kyrgyz government, including $36 million for upgrading the airport with additional storage facilities and aircraft parking, $21&amp;nbsp;million for fighting drug trafficking in the country, and $20&amp;nbsp;million for economic development.&lt;ref name=gs&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2009/06/mil-090623-rianovosti02.htm |title=Kyrgyz parliament committee approves U.S. transit center at Manas |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |accessdate=2014-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=close2&gt;{{cite news|last=Tynan|first=Deirdre|title=US Armed Forces to Remain at Air Base for Afghan Resupply Operations|publisher=EurasiaNet|date=23 June 2009|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insightb/articles/eav062309b.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The facility's official title also was altered under the new agreement. Instead of being referred to as "Manas Air Base", it became the "Transit Center at Manas International Airport".&lt;ref name=close2/&gt; According to a Kyrgyz government spokesman, the facility will officially cease to be an air base in August&amp;nbsp;2009, after which point its legal status would be altered to a logistic center.&lt;ref name=reudeal/&gt; Additionally, security around the base will now be handled by Kyrgyz personnel, as opposed to American servicemen.&lt;ref name=nytdeal/&gt;

Several local political observers believe that despite the changes in the new agreement, activities at the base will continue unaltered, and in fact, as of March&amp;nbsp;2010, operations continue.&lt;ref name=nytdeal/&gt;&lt;ref name=close2/&gt; In March&amp;nbsp;2010 the United States transported 50,000&amp;nbsp;NATO soldiers to Afghanistan via Kyrgyzstan as it represents the quickest and most efficient route.&lt;ref name=TheDiplomat&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://the-diplomat.com/2010/04/12/china-us-russia-eye-bishkek/ |title=China, US, Russia eye Bishkek |publisher=The Diplomat |accessdate=2014-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new agreement does not appear to restrict the kind of materials U.S. forces can move into and out of the base.&lt;ref name=nytdeal/&gt; There have, however, been some concerns as to whether Russia and China will lobby the Kyrgyz government not to renew the lease when the current agreement comes to an end in June&amp;nbsp;2010.&lt;ref name=TheDiplomat/&gt;

According to [[Bill Gertz]], US State Department officials reportedly overheard that [[People's Republic of China|China]] had asked the government of Kyrgyzstan to close the base to U.S.&amp;nbsp;use in return for $3&amp;nbsp;billion in cash (a sum equal to a tenth of all Chinese foreign aid given from 1950-2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Claire Provost |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2011/apr/28/china-foreign-aid-policy-report |title=China publishes first report on foreign aid policy &amp;#124; Claire Provost &amp;#124; Global development |publisher=theguardian.com |accessdate=2014-03-12 |location=London |date=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gertz, the Chinese ambassador to Kyrgyzstan subsequently denied to the U.S.&amp;nbsp;ambassador that the covert cash offer had been made.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill Gertz|Gertz, Bill]], "Inside the Ring:  China in Kyrgyzstan", ''[[Washington Times]]'', 2 December 2010, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010 Kyrgyzstan revolution===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}
On 6 April 2010 a [[Kyrgyz Revolution of 2010|second revolution]] took place. The transit center itself saw few mishaps during the revolution. The 376th Expeditionary Security Forces and augmentees were initially called to combat duty when a Kyrgyz military armored personnel carrier (APC) was taken from a National Guard facility in Bishkek by revolutionaries was driven to the transit center with the intent to enter the base and stop any fleeing members of the former government. Small arms fire erupted in several locations around the base to include the flight line. The base commander Colonel Holt had all armed combat units and those that were transiting to or from Afghanistan in combat posture to defend the transit center.

===2011–2014===
On 8 November 2011, newly elected President [[Almazbek Atambayev]] announced that he would attempt to close the base when its lease runs out in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= New Leader Says U.S. Base in Kyrgyzstan Will Be Shut |work= The New York Times |date= 8 November 2011 |first= Michael |last= Schwirtz |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/02/world/asia/kyrgyzstan-says-united-states-manas-air-base-will-close.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, Atambayev repeated his view that "Manas should be a civil airport" which "should not be a military base for any country". He reaffirmed his stance that starting from 2014, Manas airport will only be used to transport passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.ruvr.ru/2012_09_20/Russia-Kyrgyzstan-s-bargain-suits-both/|title=Russia, Kyrgyzstan’s bargain suits both|date=20 September 2012|accessdate=21 September 2012|work=[[Voice of Russia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, American military flights began to fly out of [[Mihail Kogălniceanu International Airport]], [[Romania]] instead of Manas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stripes.com/news/first-troops-move-through-new-us-transit-point-in-romania-1.265698 |title=First troops move through new US transit point in Romania |last1=Vandiver |first1=John |date=5 February 2014 |website=www.stripes.com |publisher=Stars and Stripes |accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Flight mishaps at Manas====

* On 26 September 2006, a USAF KC-135R, ''63-8886'', was damaged beyond economical repair when it was struck by a [[Tupolev]] [[Tu-154]] of Altyn Air, ''EX-85718'', while stopped on a taxiway after landing at Manas Airbase.  The [[Tu-154]] was taking off and its right wing struck the fairing of the KC-135R No. 1 engine.  The force of the impact nearly severed the No. 1 engine, but destroyed a portion of the left wing and the resulting fire caused extensive damage to the KC-135. The Tu-154 lost about 6 feet of its right wingtip, but was able to get airborne and return to the airport for an emergency landing. The tanker crew had been directed to use Taxiway Golf, a taxiway which was not usable for night operations, and the controller failed to note that they reported "holding short" of that taxiway, rather than "clear of" the runway at that point. Both a contractor safety liaison employed by the U.S. Air Force and the air traffic control tower personnel failed to note that the KC-135 was not clear of the runway prior to clearing the Tu-154 for takeoff.&lt;ref&gt;http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20060926-1&lt;/ref&gt; The crew of the KC-135 evacuated the aircraft without serious injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20060926-1 |title=ASN Aircraft accident Boeing KC-135R Stratotanker 63-8886 Bishkek Airport (FRU) |publisher=Aviation-safety.net |accessdate=2014-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 3 May 2013, a [[Fairchild AFB]], WA air crew flying a McConnell AFB, KS (USAF) KC-135R, ''63-8877'', crashed about 8 minutes after taking off from Manas Airbase in Kyrgyzstan, killing three crew members.  The aircraft was at cruise altitude about 200&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Bishkek]] when it lost altitude and crashed in a mountainous area near the village of Chorgolu, close to the border between [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Kazakhstan]]. Videotape evidence seems to indicate that the fuselage was in flames as it descended from the clouds overhead, although the tail and some wreckage (left wing, vertical stabilizer, one engine, boom and boom drogue adapter) were not blackened by fire and landed some distance away.  This may indicate an inflight explosion or structural failure, possibly related to thunderstorms in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.kxly.com/news/spokane-news/cell-phone-video-may-have-captured-deadly-kc135-crash/-/101214/20654806/-/38as9b/-/index.htm |title=Cellphone video may have captured deadly KC-135 crash &amp;#124; Spokane/E. WA |publisher=KXLY.com |date=2013-06-20 |accessdate=2014-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ultimately, the mishap board determined that a rudder system malfunction contributed to development of oscillatory instability, known as "[[Dutch roll]]."  The aircrew did not adequately diagnose the problem and, by using rudder to maintain course, contributed to structural failure of the aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20130503-0&lt;/ref&gt; Although one of the last -135 aircraft built, this airframe was 48 years and 10 months old at the time of its loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20130503-0 |title=ASN Aircraft accident Boeing KC-135R Stratotanker 63-8877 Chaldovar |publisher=Aviation-safety.net |accessdate=2014-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-22397266 |title=BBC News - Fate of crew unknown as US plane crashes in Kyrgyzstan |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2013-05-03 |accessdate=2014-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10299">'''Ultimogeniture''', also known as '''postremogeniture''' or '''junior right''', is the tradition of [[inheritance]] by the last-born of a privileged position in a parent's wealth or office.  The tradition has been far rarer historically than [[primogeniture]] (sole inheritance by the first-born) or [[partible inheritance]] (division of the estate among the children).

==Advantages and disadvantages==
Ultimogeniture might be considered appropriate in circumstances where the youngest child had been assigned the role of "keeping the hearth", taking care of the parents and continuing at home, whereas elder children had had time and opportunity to succeed in the world and provide for themselves. In a variation on the system, elder children might have received a share of land and moveable property at a younger age, for example when marrying and founding their own family. Ultimogeniture might also be considered appropriate for the estates of elderly rulers and property-owners, whose children were likely to be mature adults.

There are several disadvantages for realms and families that adopt ultimogeniture.  One such drawback is the fact that elder siblings, especially the first born of the relevant gender, will be heavily incentivized to sidestep the tradition, even more so if primogeniture inheritance is a familiar concept. And since the elder siblings likely have more time and opportunities to gain power, wealth, experience, and influence prior to the inheritance—simply because they were born earlier—ultimogeniture traditions are more likely to be disregarded or even discarded.

[[Coercion]], [[assassination]], [[fratricide]], or even [[patricide]] can be committed, backed by all the advantage an elder sibling would have, such that ultimogeniture is sidestepped.
To clarify, those who stand to gain by ignoring the stipulation under ultimogeniture are more likely to have the facility to do so, when compared to other succession laws. For example, under primogeniture tradition, the younger siblings will stand to gain if they can bypass said tradition, but the elder siblings still have the aforementioned advantages, so primogeniture traditions tend to persist.

* In [[India]], matrilineal ultimogeniture is practiced by the [[Khasi people]] of [[Meghalaya]], wherein inheritance is traditionally passed down to the youngest daughter. Although portions of the property are divided among siblings, the bulk of the share, including the "ancestral hearth", is bestowed on the youngest daughter ({{lang|kha| ka khadduh}}), who is also expected to take care of the aging parents, as well as any unmarried siblings. As a consequence, marriage to the youngest daughter is [[uxorilocal]], as opposed to marriage to the other siblings, which is [[neolocal]].
* Among the Malabar [[Saint Thomas Christians|Syrian Christian]] community of [[Kerala]] in southern India, a variant of ultimogeniture is practised, where the youngest son gets the ancestral house (''[[tharavad]]'') and adjoining property and is expected to take care of his elderly parents, while his elder brothers also get a share of the property though they live separately; the daughters are granted a bounteous dowry but traditionally do not receive inheritance of property.&lt;ref name="paper_dowry_syrian_christian_2003"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2ycZjQeZ278C&amp;pg=PA251&amp;q=Ultimogeniture|title=“Stridhanam: Rethinking Dowry, Inheritance and Women's Resistance Among the Syrian Christians of Kerala.” Anthropologica|last=Philips|first=Amali|date=2003|publisher=Canadian Anthropology Society|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="book_syrian_christian_2014"/&gt; Only if there are no sons, the husband of the youngest daughter is formally embraced into the family as adopted son (''dathu puthran'') to fulfill the role of the youngest son. &lt;ref name="book_syrian_christian_2014"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yt6vAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT480&amp;q=youngest+son|title=Eastern Christianity and Politics in the Twenty-First Century|last=Leustean|first=Lucian N.|date=2014-05-30|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317818656|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="paper_dowry_syrian_christian_2003"/&gt;
* In some southwestern areas of [[Japan]], property was traditionally apportioned by a modified version of ultimogeniture known as ''masshi souzoku'' ({{lang|ja|末子相続}}).  An estate was distributed equally among all sons or children, except that the youngest received a double share as a reward for caring for the elderly parents in their last years. Official surveys conducted during the early years of the [[Meiji period|Meiji]] era demonstrated that the most common family form throughout the country during the [[Edo period]] was characterized by stem structure, patrilineal descent, patrivirilocal{{clarify|date=August 2017}} residence and patrilineal [[primogeniture]], but in some southwestern areas this combination of partible inheritance and ultimogeniture was sometimes employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Family History Revisited: Comparative Perspectives |editor-last=Wall |editor-first=Richard Wall |editor2-first=Tamara K. |editor2-last=Hareven |editor3-first=Joseph |editor3-last=Ehmer |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8awruI9XyXsC&amp;pg=PA343 343–344]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''United Nations Security Council resolution 1559''', adopted on 2 September 2004, after recalling resolutions [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 425|425]] (1978), [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 426|426]] (1978), [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 520|520]] (1982) and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1553|1553]] (2004) on the situation in Lebanon, the Council supported free and fair presidential [[elections in Lebanon]] and called upon remaining foreign forces to withdraw from the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Security Council declares support for free, fair presidential election in Lebanon; calls for withdrawal of foreign forces there|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2004/sc8181.doc.htm|date=2 September 2004|agency=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nine countries voted in favor: Angola, Benin, Chile, France, Germany, Romania, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Six countries abstained: Algeria, Brazil, China, Pakistan, the Philippines and Russia.

The resolution was sponsored by France and the United States. The cooperation between these two nations on an issue concerning the Middle East was seen as a significant improvement in their relationship, compared to their earlier bitter disagreement over the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. Because Lebanon was governed by France as a [[French Mandate of Lebanon|League of Nations mandate]] 1919–1943, France has long taken a special interest in Lebanon.

== Contents of resolution ==
It called upon Lebanon to establish its sovereignty over all of its land and called upon "foreign forces", Syria, to withdraw from Lebanon and to cease intervening in the internal [[politics of Lebanon]]. The resolution also called on all Lebanese and non-Lebanese militias to disband and declared support for a "free and fair electoral process".

== Aftermath ==

The resolution was coauthored by France and the United States. Echoing the [[Taif Agreement]], the resolution "calls upon all remaining foreign forces to withdraw from Lebanon" and "for the disbanding and disarmament of all Lebanese and non-Lebanese militias."  Lebanon has requested that Israel withdraw from the disputed [[Shebaa Farms]] and the hills of Kfar-Shouba and return the Lebanese detainees in Israel as a condition for  fully implementing Resolution 1559 which includes disbanding of the military wing of Hezbollah.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2006/sc8616.doc.htm Security Council Press Release, 23 January 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/meast/05/06/lebanon.report/index.html "Hezbollah disarmament unclear"]. CNN 7 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jinsa.org/articles/articles.html/function/view/categoryid/884/documentid/3131/history/3,2360,884,3131 "Lebanon, Independent on Syrian Terms"]. JINSA, 25 August 2005  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060309043407/http://www.jinsa.org/articles/articles.html/function/view/categoryid/884/documentid/3131/history/3,2360,884,3131 |date=9 March 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the resolution argue however that an attempt from the weak and politically divided Lebanese army to disarm Hezbollah would be very difficult and could restart the Lebanese civil war. Syria was also in violation of the resolution until recently because of their military presence in Lebanon.

On 7 October 2004 the [[UN Secretary General]] [[Kofi Annan]] reported to the Security Council regarding the lack of compliance with Resolution 1559.  Mr. Annan concluded his report by saying: "It is time, 14 years after the end of hostilities and four years after the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon, for all parties concerned to set aside the remaining vestiges of the past. The withdrawal of foreign forces and the disbandment and disarmament of militias would, with finality, end that sad chapter of Lebanese history."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=12147&amp;Cr=lebanon&amp;Cr1= Syria has not withdrawn troops from Lebanon, Annan reports&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 20 January 2005 UN Secretary-General's report on Lebanon stated that "The continually asserted position of the Government of Lebanon that the Blue Line is not valid in the [[Shab'a farms]] area is not compatible with Security Council resolutions.  The Council has recognized the Blue Line as valid for purposes of confirming Israel’s withdrawal pursuant to resolution 425 (1978).  The UN Security Council has repeatedly requested that all parties respect the Blue Line in its entirety."&lt;ref name="un.org"&gt;[https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2005/sc8299.doc.htm SECURITY COUNCIL CONDEMNS VIOLENCE ALONG BLUE LINE BETWEEN ISRAEL AND LEBANON, EXTENDS MANDATE OF UNIFIL UNTIL 31 JULY&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 January 2005 [[UN Security Council Resolution 1583|Resolution 1583]] called upon the Government of Lebanon to fully extend and exercise its sole and effective authority throughout the south, including through the deployment of sufficient numbers of Lebanese armed and security forces, to ensure a calm environment throughout the area, including along the Blue Line, and to exert control over the use of force on its territory and from it.&lt;ref name="un.org"/&gt;

Syria made few moves to comply with the resolution until the assassination of [[Rafik Hariri]], the former [[Prime Minister of Lebanon]], on 14 February 2005. International pressure to withdraw intensified and public perception in Lebanon turned strongly against Syria, evidenced by mass demonstrations that were labeled the [[Cedar Revolution]].  President [[Bashar al-Assad]] of Syria announced on 5 March 2005 that he planned to "bring his forces home." The withdrawal, involving about 14,000 troops, took about seven weeks to complete.

On 26 April 2005, after 29 years of [[Syrian occupation of Lebanon|military action in Lebanon]], the last Syrian troops left Lebanon. Syrian military and intelligence facilities, after the destruction of sensitive documents or the transportation of logistical material, were turned over to Lebanese counterparts.  This action left the Lebanese government as the main violator of the resolution due to its refusal to dismantle the pro-Syrian Palestinian and Hezbollah militias.

On 27 December 2005 Katyusha rockets fired from Hezbollah territory smashed into houses in the Israeli city of [[Kiryat Shmona]] wounding three people [https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20051228/wl_nm/mideast_attack_dc_6]. UN Secretary General Kofi Annan called on the Lebanese government ''"to extend its control over all its territory, to exert its [[monopoly on the use of force]], and to put an end to all such attacks"'' [https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=17049&amp;Cr=Middle&amp;Cr1=Lebanon].

On 23 January 2006 the UN Security Council called on the Government of Lebanon to make more progress in controlling its territory and disbanding militias, while also calling on Syria to cooperate with those efforts.  In a statement read out by its January President, Augustine Mahiga of Tanzania, the Council also called on Syria to take measures to stop movements of arms and personnel into Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=17263&amp;Cr=middle&amp;Cr1=leban Security Council calls on Lebanon to assert control over all its territory&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lebanese response==
The Lebanese government officially responded to the resolution on the [[Lebanese Armed Forces]] (LAF) website in three ways:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lebarmy.gov.lb/article.asp?cat=6&amp;ln=en] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060106015900/http://www.lebarmy.gov.lb/article.asp?cat=6&amp;ln=en |date=6 January 2006 }}. Lebanese Armed Forces.&lt;/ref&gt; 
#The withdrawal of the foreign forces from Lebanon;
#Disarming the Lebanese and foreign guerillas; and
#Expanding the government's authority on all the Lebanese territories.

[[Hezbollah]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.almanar.com.lb/newssite/NewsDetails.aspx?id=158817&amp;language=en Hezbollah Denounces Ban's Report on 1559 as Meddling in Lebanese Affairs]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Loyalty to the Resistance bloc]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.almanar.com.lb/newssite/NewsDetails.aspx?id=158867&amp;language=en "Loyalty to Resistance Bloc Slams Ban’s Report as Biased"]. Almanar&lt;/ref&gt; denounced a report on the resolution in 2010 as meddling in Lebanese affairs.

== Lebanese political debate ==

The question of compliance with Resolution 1559 is a prominent matter in Lebanese politics. Prime Minister [[Fouad Siniora]] has stated that the government considers Hezbollah arms to be a domestic affair and that stated policy should reassure Hezbollah that the government will protect its military wing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yalibnan.com/site/archives/2006/01/lebanons_sinior_2.php "Lebanon's Siniora won't yield to Hezbollah"], Safir, 16 January 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Hezbollah, seeing itself as the sole representative of the Lebanese resistance, was trying to acquire better privileges allowing it to stop any possible attack.  The debate took several months after which prime minister [[Fouad Siniora]] admitted that the resistance will be not called anything else but resistance, in reference to people attacking it as a militia.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

[[Druze]] leader MP [[Walid Jumblatt]] has repeatedly insisted that he objects to the disarmament of Hezbollah, according to the international resolution, describing the party as a "resistance group" and not a militia. He engaged in an electoral alliance with Hezbollah during the 2005 parliamentary election, with one of the titles of the alliance being "The Protection of the Resistance," but is now calling on Hezbollah to be integrated into the Lebanese Army and hand in its weapons over to the government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lebaneselobby.org/News__index/news%202006/01%2017%2005%20EU%20demands%20Lebanon%20implement%20Resolution%201559.html "EU demands Lebanon implement Resolution 1559"]. ''Daily Star'', Beirut, 17 January 2006  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825004359/http://www.lebaneselobby.org/News__index/news%202006/01%2017%2005%20EU%20demands%20Lebanon%20implement%20Resolution%201559.html |date=25 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Siniora has more stated on 20 July 2006 that "the continued presence of Israeli occupation of Lebanese lands in the [[Shebaa Farms]] region is what contributes to the presence of Hezbollah weapons. The international community must help us in (getting) an Israeli withdrawal from Shebaa Farms so we can solve the problem of Hezbollah's arms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1Y1-95778358.html|title=Israelis, Hezbollah Clash Again in Lebanon|publisher=[[Associated Press|AP]]|via=Highbeam |subscription=yes|date=20 July 2006|accessdate=2014-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
