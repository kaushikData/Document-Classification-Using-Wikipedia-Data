'''Banu Hammed''' '''بنو حامد''' or also known as '''Al-Hammedi''' '''الحامدي''', plural ''Al-Hawamed'' ''الحوامد'' was one of the tribes that had migrated from the Arab states of the [[Persian Gulf]] to [[Iran]] and had settled there during the [[Islamic conquest of Persia]] and later on due to trade. Many of the members of the tribes have left and have come back to these Arab states. Banu Hammed members are now in the [[UAE]], [[Qatar]] and [[Bahrain]]. The Banu Hammed tribe are not nomads, most of them being traders with a minority of the tribe being goat and camel herders.

==Population==
The tribe has along the lines of 20,000 members subdivided into different clans also known as (عشائر). The tribe has settled in the '''Bar Fars''' region of coastal Iran. Having a large percentage of them living in '''Lar''', '''Bastak''', '''Bandar Lengeh''' and '''Bandar Abbas'''.

{{Translation_WIP|Mapa Mundi de Beato de Liébana|Spanish|es|English|en}}

[[File:ApocalypseStSeverFolios45v46rWorldMap.jpg|thumb|300px|The image shows a copy of the ''Beatus Map'' from the [[Saint-Sever Beatus]], produced in [[Saint-Sever Abbey]], France. The map is faced eastwards, and not northwards, as usual in modern cartography. For this reason it is said that the map is ''oriented''.&lt;ref&gt;The manuscript was executed ca. 1050 under the orders of the abbot, Gregori de Montaner&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''Beatus Map''' or '''Beatine Map''' is one of the most significant cartographic works of the European Early Middle Ages: It was originally drawn by the Spanish monk [[Beatus of Liébana]], based on the accounts given by [[Saint Isidore of Seville]], [[Ptolemy]] and the [[Holy Bible]]. Although the original manuscript is lost, there remain several copies extant, which retain a high fidelity with respect the original.

The Map is shown in the prologue of the second book of Beatus' work ''[[Commentary on the Apocalypse]]''. Its main goal is not to depict a cartographically exact depiction of the world and its continents, but to illustrate the primitive Diaspora of the Apostles.

==The European world view in the High Middle Ages==

According to the descriptions of the [[Book of Genesis]] (which was one of the main sources of Beatus), the Earth was thought to be plane and to sustain the vault of heaven, where the Sun, the Moon, and many other minor [[luminary (astrology)|luminaries]] like planets and stars, moved. There were two sorts of water masses: The ''waters above'' the firmament, which were contained by the vault of heaven and occasionally fell to Earth in form of rain, when the floodgates opened, and the ''waters below'', which nurtured the rivers, the streams and the great salt water masses.

[[File:Hieronymus Bosch - The Garden of Earthly Delights - The exterior (shutters).jpg|thumb|250px|This image of [[The Garden of Earthly Delights]] illustrates the Hebrew  ''[[world view|Weltanschauung]]'' which is reflected in the book of Genesis. The Earth is a disc surrounded by two water masses: the ''upper waters'', which occasionally fall to earth in form of rain when [[YHVH]] opens the floodgates of Heaven, and the ''lower waters'', formed by the seas, the lakes and the Ocean. In the depths of the Cosmic Sphere lay the ''[[sheol]]'', dwelling of the dead until the Judgement Day.]]In this ''mappamundi'', the world is represented as a circular disc surrounded by the Ocean. The Earth is divided in three continents: Asia (upper semicircle), Africa (right lower quadrant) and Europe (left lower quadrant), which belonged respectively to the descendants of the three sons of Noah: [[Shem]], [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]] and [[Japheth]]. The continental masses are separated by water streams and inner seas like the Mediterranean (Europe-Africa), the Nile River (Africa-Asia) and the [[Bosporus]] and the Aegeus Sea (Europe-Asia). In the center of the world lays Jerusalem, sacred city to Christianity and Judaism alike, where Abraham was about to sacrifice his own son, Isaac, and where the happenings of the Passion and Resurrection of Jesus did take place. The conception of [[Jerusalem]] as an ''ombilicum mundi'' was quite usual in the medieval Christian spirituality: In the [[Divine Comedy]], Dante starts his travel to hell from the soils of this city.

==The description of the continents==

===Asia===

[[File:Folio 25v - The Garden of Eden.jpg|thumb|left|250px|In this illustration from the calendar page of the book [[The Very Rich Hours of the Duke of Berry]] is shown the expulsion of Adam and Eva from the earthly Paradise.  During all the Middle Ages it was believed that the Garden of Eden was located at the eastern end of the world, and that it was possible, in theory, to reach that place.  Columbus attempted it.]]At the eastern end of Asia is found the [[Garden of Eden]], a paradisical territory where it is never cold or hot, and where trees and wood of all kinds grow.  In its center stands the Tree of Life, and next to it there is a fountain from which the four rivers of Paradise:  [[Tigris]], [[Euphrates]], [[Pishon]] and [[Gihon]] flow.  The entrance to Paradise is protected by a Cherub who brandishes a sword of fire.

On the southern coast of the Asian continent is found [[India]], an enormous territory traversed by three rivers, the [[Indus]], [[Ganges]] and Hipane.  It is abundant in men of dark color, elephants, rhinoceroses, spices and precious stones such as rubies, emeralds or diamonds.  Its fields are blessed by the west wind, Favonio, and for that reason they yield two harvests a year.  In that location are found the Mountains of Gold, access to which is forbidden to humans by griffins and dragons.  Off the Indian coast are the islands of Taprobane (Sri Lanka, formerly Ceylon), abundant with gems and elephants, Chrysa and Argyre, rich in gold and silver respectively, and finally Tyle, whose trees never lose their leaves (it has been speculated that this is some island of Indonesia).

To the west of India one finds [[Parthia]], a region that extends between the rivers Indus and Tigris.  It is divided into five different provinces:  Aracusia; Parthia proper, called thus by the Parthians, brave soldiers from Scythia who founded an empire that dealt with Rome on an equal basis; Assyria, called thus by Asshur, the son of Shem, famous for its purple dyes and all types of perfumes and ointments, in it situated Níniveh, the capital of the old empire of the Assyrians, and where Jonas the prophet went to preach futilely; Medes (northwest [[Iran]]), which is divided in two parts, Greater Medes ([[Hamadan]], [[Kermanshahan]], [[Qazvin]], [[Tehran]] and [[Espahan]]) and Smaller Medes ([[Azarbaijan]]); and finally [[Persia]], birthplace of King Cyrus, the anointed one of God, and the region where magical science arose for the first time, introduced by Nebroth the giant, after the confusion of languages had emerged in [[Babylon|Babel]].
 
[[File:Ziggarat of Ur 001.jpg|thumb|300px| Judeo-Christian tradition makes '''Ur of Caldea''' the mother country of the patriarch [[Abraham]]. The early Spanish '''Albeldense and Rotense Chronicles''', when they recount the Islamic invasion of Spain, make a subtle ethnic distinction between the invaders: [[Berber people|Berbers]] (such as Tarik) are given the name of '''[[Moors]]''', while the [[Arabs]] (the ethnic group of Musa ibn Nusayr) are called '''[[Chaldea]]ns'''.  And in those times it was considered that Chaldea and not Arabia was the original country of the Saracens.]][[Mesopotamia]] is the region located between the rivers [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]].  There we find the regions of Babylon and Chaldea.  [[Babylon]] was the ancient conqueror of the kingdom of Judah and the place where the Jewish people were exiled.  In that city the revelations of the prophet Ezekiel took place, which had so much influence on the creation of the Prophetic Chronicle.  From [[Chaldea]] (South of Mesopotamia), the Asturian Chronicles supposed, came the hordes that invaded Spain and were defeated by Pelayo in Covadonga.  Among the most important cities of this region can be mentioned Ur, the birthplace of the patriarch Abraham, as well as Erech (or Uruk), which was founded by Enoch.

To the south of the Euphrates river and sinus Persicum (Persian Gulf), Arabia was located, a desert region whose southern part (present-day Yemen) received the name of Arabia Felix, Happy Arabia.  It was a rich, fertile land where precious stones, myrrh and incense abounded.  In it lived the fabulous bird phoenix, which after dying surrounded by fire was reborn of its ashes.
On the northeast border of Arabia, already in territories of the old Roman Empire, extended the province of Syria, whose limits were the Caucasus and Taurus Mountains to the north, the Euphrates to the east, the Mediterranean Sea and Egypt to the west, and Arabia to the south.  Syria had three different provinces:  Comagena, Phoenicia, and Palestine.  The territory of Phoenicia extended from the Mediterranean Sea to Mount Lebanon and the sea of Tiberiades.  In Phoenicia were found the famous cities of Sidon and Tyre.  In the latter they preached so much that the prophet Elias was Jesus Christ.  Further south was located Palestine, which was subdivided into four different provinces:  Galilee, where they nailed Jesus of Nazareth, the sea of Tiberiades, where a good part of the apostles worked as fishermen, and Monte Tabor, the place where the Transfiguration occurred.

===Africa===
Africa is obviously from the Nile river with a lake as its source. The Maghreb is named "Libia" and Africa is surrounded by a sea coloured red.

Billings Logan International Airport has scheduled nonstop flights to several [[airline hub]]s such as Dallas/Fort Worth, Denver, Minneapolis/St.  Paul, Portland, Salt Lake City and Seattle. Billings also serves as a small hub for [[Cape Air]],&lt;ref name="Cape Air"/&gt; a commuter airline which operates nonstop flights with [[Cessna 402]] prop aircraft to [[Glasgow, Montana|Glasgow]], [[Glendive, Montana|Glendive]], [[Havre, Montana|Havre]], [[Sidney, Montana|Sidney]] and [[Wolf Point, Montana|Wolf Point]] in Montana.

==History==

The first recorded flight in Billings was in 1912 by a local dentist named [[Dr. Frank Bell]]. The flight was in his home-made [[Curtiss]] 0-X-5.

The "First" flight was made on Memorial Day 1913, with much publicity, Dr. Bell took off from Billings flying to [[Park City, Montana|Park City]] and back, {{convert|40|mi|km}} round trip. This flight was captured by a local artist named J.K. Ralston in his painting entitled "First Flight," displayed in the airport lobby.

In 1927 The City of Billings approved $5,000 and {{convert|400|acre|ha|0}} on top of the Rims to build a runway. The {{convert|1820|ft|m|adj=on}} runway and small administrative building was built by horse-drawn equipment; the airport opened on May 29, 1928.

In 1933 [[Northwest Airlines]] introduced the first scheduled passenger air service.

Major terminal expansions were made in 1958, 1972, and 1992. In early 2006 the airport added electronic monitors giving info on arrivals and departures.

The name changed from the Billings Municipal Airport to Billings Logan Field in 1957, after Dick Logan, the airport manager, died. In 1971 the airport became Billings Logan International Airport.&lt;ref name="flybillings"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flybillings.com/Index.aspx?NID=655|publisher=flybillings.com|title=Airport History &amp;#124; Billings Airport, MT - Official Website |accessdate=December 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1961, [[Northwest Airlines]] was operating [[Lockheed L-188 Electra]] propjet service into the airport on a routing of New York [[Idlewild Airport]] (IDL, now [[JFK Airport]]) - Detroit (DTW) - Milwaukee (MKE) - Minneapolis/St. Paul (MSP) - Bismarck, ND (BIS) - Billings (BIL) - Great Falls (GTF) - Spokane (GEG) - Yakima (YKM) - Seattle (SEA).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timetableimages.com, May 28, 1961 Northwest Airlines system timetable&lt;/ref&gt;

For at least part of each year from the late 1970s to early 1980s, Billings was served by wide body [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]] jetliners operated by [[Northwest Airlines]]. In 1979, Northwest was flying DC-10 service on a round trip routing of Newark [[Liberty International Airport]] (EWR) - Detroit (DTW) - Chicago [[O'Hare International Airport]] (ORD) - Billings (BIL) - Great Falls (GTF) - Spokane (GEG) - Seattle (SEA).&lt;ref name="departedflights.com"/&gt; By 1982, the airline was operating the DC-10 on a round trip routing of Minneapolis/St. Paul (MSP) - Billings - Great Falls - Spokane - Seattle.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.departedflights.com, Aug. 1, 1982 Northwest Airlines system timetable&lt;/ref&gt;  The DC-10 was the largest aircraft ever to be operated in scheduled passenger service into the airport. For a short period in 1979, Northwest used a B-747 to provide passenger service to MSP-BIL-SEA.  This was at the tail-end of a pilot/airline dispute. Northwest also served Billings with [[Boeing 727-200]], [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30]], [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9-50]], [[McDonnell Douglas MD-80]] and [[Airbus A319]] jetliners over the years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.departedflights.com, Oct. 1, 1991 &amp; June 1, 1999 editions, Official Airline Guide (OAG), Billings flight schedules; Sept. 9, 1987 Northwest Airlines system timtable&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.airliners.net, photo of Northwest Airlines A319 departing from Billings&lt;/ref&gt;

There are nine taxiways currently in use. Taxiway A runs parallel to Runway 10L/28R, serves as the last exit of Runway 10L and connects to the terminal area. Taxiway B runs through Runway 10L/28R as an access taxiway to the Northern Air Tanker Base. Three Taxiways, C, E F, serve as exit taxiways that vary in width to serve certain size aircraft. Taxiway D intersects Runway 10L/28R and serves as a northern exit point for Runway 25. Two taxiways (G and H) provide all exits for Runway 10R/28L and Runway 7. Finally, Taxiway J is the primary taxiway from the terminal area to the cargo ramps. Two hotspots exist on the airfield side of operations. Hotspot 1 is located at the intersection of Runway 10R/28L and Runway 7/25. Furthermore, Hotspot 2 is located at the intersection of Taxiway C and Runway 10L/28R.&lt;ref&gt;Billings Logan International Airport.  (2007). Chapter 1: Inventory.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On December 18, 1992, a [[Cessna 550]] arriving from Watertown, SD crashed on approach to runway 28R, killing all 8 occupants. Investigation found the cause to be wake turbulence from a Boeing 757 that arrived just prior to the incident, causing the aircraft to roll inverted.&lt;ref name="ntsb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/brief.aspx?ev_id=20001211X16242&amp;key=1|publisher=ntsb.gov|title=SEA93GA041|accessdate=December 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Borgartún, Reykjavík.jpg|thumb|Borgartún]]
'''Borgartún''' is a street in [[Reykjavík]], [[Iceland]], that in years leading up to the country's economic crisis became the centre of the city's financial district. Three of Iceland's four largest banks have their headquarters in the area: [[Arion banki]], [[Íslandsbanki]] and [[Straumur]].

A [[Höfðatorg Tower 1|19-story skyscraper]], part of the Höfðatorg development, is located at Borgartún. As of 2012, the skyscraper is completed but the rest of the development remains unfinished. The location of the skyscraper has been controversial because it is located opposite a low-density residential street.

Also located in Borgartún is [[Höfði]], a house built in 1909. Initially, it was the house of the French consul in Iceland. It was the place of the [[Reykjavík Summit|Iceland Summit]] when [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] met there in 1986. It is now mainly used for ceremonies for the Reykjavík City municipality.

The western end of Borgartún houses a complex of buildings where the offices of many departments of the Reykjavík city government, including a centralised service centre, are housed. The service centre is home to the Icelandic national registry, [[Þjóðskrá Íslands]].

'''Brutus''' is a [[Czechs|Czech]] [[rock music|rock]] musical group with a long tradition. They call their style ''true bigbeat'' (the Czech word ''bigbeat'' is different from the [[Big beat|English use]] more or less connected with the music of the 1960s from [[rock and roll]] to rock music played for dancing)

Brutus was established in 1967 under the name ''Mandragora''. In 1973 their performances were banned by the [[communist]] censorship and they started playing under the name ''Elektronik''. The name was changed to ''Brutus'' in 1980 and there was a period (1982-1989) when the band had to play as ''Kyklop''. Since the [[Velvet Revolution]] in 1989 the band has again been called ''Brutus'' and has performed every Friday and Sunday of the year all around the [[Czech Republic]]. They played with British [[UK Subs]], [[TV Smith]], [[Suzi Quatro]], [[Dr. Feelgood (band)|Dr. Feelgood]] or Slovak [[Zóna A]], or [[No Name (Slovak band)|No Name]]. They also cooperate with [[The Vibrators]].

== Concerts and lyrics ==
The performance of Brutus takes four hours of music played almost with no break. They play every weekend on two places, big cities as well as [[whistle stop]]s.

The lyrics of the songs are mostly cheerful and the topics turn around music itself, dance, beer-drinking, rough sleepers and love.

The group also plays classic British and American rock and roll during their concerts.

:''DG Justice, Freedom and Security was split in 2010. For Home Affairs (security), see [[Directorate-General for Home Affairs (European Commission)]].''
{{Politics of the European Union}}
The '''Directorate-General for Justice and Consumers''' ('''DG JUST''') is a [[Directorate-General]] of the [[European Commission]]. The role of the body is to ensure that the whole [[European Union]] (EU) is an [[area of freedom, security and justice]]. The specific tasks and responsibilities of the DG are laid down by the [[Treaty of Rome]] (see Part Two, Articles 17-22; Part Three, Title III, Articles 39-47), the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]] which came into force on 1 May 1999 and the conclusions of the [[European Council]] meeting in [[Tampere]] ([[Finland]]) in October 1999.

The relevant Commissioner is the ''European Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality'' (formerly [[European Commissioner for Justice, Fundamental Rights and Citizenship]]).

==Structure==

As of 2015, the DG Justice and Consumers is divided into 5 directorates,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/justice/about/files/organisation_chart_en.pdf Directorate-General Justice and Consumers Organisation chart], accessed 10 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt; namely :

*Directorate A : Civil justice
*Directorate B : Criminal justice
*Directorate C : Fundamental rights and Union citizenship
*Directorate D : Equality
*Directorate E : Consumers

DG Justice and Consumers is responsible for relations with the following EU agencies : the [[EU Agency for Fundamental Rights]] (FRA), the [[European Institute for Gender Equality]] (EIGE) and the European Union Judicial Cooperation Unit ([[EUROJUST]]).

==History==
DG JUSTICE was created in 2010 when the DG Justice, Freedom and Security was split into DG JUSTICE and the [[Directorate-General for Home Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Commission completes internal reshuffle|date=3 June 2010|work=[[EurActiv]]|url=http://www.euractiv.com/future-eu/commission-completes-internal-re-news-494849}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese police arrested founder Pastor Chun Ki-won in 2002  on the Mongolian border, on the escape route he pioneered. His arrest and eight month imprisonment caused a stir in South Korea, exposing the plight of [[North Korean defectors]].

In 1995, as a missionary in the [[Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture|Yanji region]], Chun met his first North Koreans in hiding. "These people had lost all their rights," he said. "The most important thing I could do was revive their humanity." Chun orchestrated the escapes of more than 700 North Koreans with only a handful of failures.&lt;ref name="oneill2009"&gt;{{Citation | url = http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2009/02/north-korea/oneill-text/4 | title = Escaping North Korea | newspaper = National Geographic Magazine | page = 4}} focusing on Chun Ki-won.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | date = May 15, 2003 | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/a/2003/02/15/MN143755.DTL | title = Christian underground smuggles North Koreans to safety in South | newspaper = SF gate}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward Snowden in popular culture''' is part of the [[reactions to global surveillance disclosures]] made by [[Edward Snowden]]. His impact as a public figure has been felt in cinema, advertising, video games, literature, music, statuary, and social media.

==Cinema==
===Shorts===
Snowden's passage through Hong Kong inspired a local production team to produce a low-budget five-minute film titled ''[[Verax (film)|Verax]]''. The film, depicting the time Snowden spent hiding in the [[The Mira Hong Kong|Mira Hotel]] while being unsuccessfully tracked by the [[CIA]] and [[Ministry of State Security (China)|China's Ministry of State Security]], was uploaded to YouTube in June 2013.&lt;ref name="youtube-verax"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWVGDBeR42I |title=[v e r a x ] : Edward Snowden / ??? - Short Film |work=YouTube |publisher=JShotVideo |format=Video 5&amp;nbsp;Minuten |date=June 25, 2013 |accessdate=March 16, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328100750/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWVGDBeR42I |archivedate=March 28, 2014 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="investvine"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://investvine.com/ready-at-last-hong-kong-director-presents-snowden-movie/ |title=Ready at last: Hong Kong director presents Snowden movie |first=Arno |last=Maierbrugger |work=Investvine |date=July 4, 2013 |accessdate=March 16, 2014 |archivedate=March 16, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6O7plUQ5T?url=http://investvine.com/ready-at-last-hong-kong-director-presents-snowden-movie/ |deadurl=yes |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feature films===
A dramatic thriller, ''[[Classified: The Edward Snowden Story]]'', was released on September 19, 2014. This feature-length film, which was [[crowdfunded]] and offered as a free download, was directed by Jason Bourque and produced by [[Travis Doering]]. Actor [[Kevin Zegers]] played Edward Snowden, [[Michael Shanks]] played Glenn Greenwald and [[Carmen Aguirre]] played Laura Poitras.&lt;ref name="cnbc-snowden-movie-crowedfunding"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/101021408 |title=Filmmakers look to crowdfunding for Snowden movie |first=Arjun |last=Kharpal |work=Consumer News and Business Channel |date=September 10, 2013 |accessdate=March 16, 2014 |archivedate=March 16, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6O7q2rBup?url=http://www.cnbc.com/id/101021408 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, film director [[Oliver Stone]] bought the rights to ''Time of the Octopus'', a forthcoming novel based on Snowden's life and written by his Russian lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena. Stone said he would use both Kucherena's book and [[Luke Harding|Luke Harding's]] nonfiction ''[[The Snowden Files]]'' for the screenplay of his movie, which began production later in 2014.&lt;ref name="OliverStoneMovie"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/11/oliver-stone-film-edward-snowden |title=Oliver Stone to make movie based on fictionalised life of Edward Snowden |last=Walker |first=Shaun |work=The Guardian |accessdate=June 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone's biopic ''[[Snowden (film)|Snowden]]'', which was released in September 2016, had Snowden portrayed by American actor [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]], with a short appearance by Snowden himself in the last few minutes of the film. Shortly before release, Stone said that Snowden should be pardoned, calling him a "patriot above all" and suggesting that he should run the NSA himself.&lt;ref name="wendy-mesley"&gt;{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueczcri7IJs |title=Oliver Stone on Edward Snowden and privacy rights |first=Wendy |last=Mesley |series=[[The National (TV program)|The National]] |publisher=[[CBC News]] |date=September 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snowden appears briefly as a character in the 2018 comedy-thriller [[The Spy Who Dumped Me]], in which he is played by British actor [[Tom Stourton]].

On October 10, 2014, ''[[Citizenfour]]'', a documentary about Snowden, received its world premiere at the [[New York Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmlinc.org/films/citizenfour/ |title=Citizenfour film |date=September 10, 2014 |accessdate=December 2, 2014 |publisher=filmlinc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier that year, director Laura Poitras told Associated Press she was editing the film in Berlin because she feared her source material would be seized by the government inside the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/snowden-documentary-premiere-ny-festival-25541267 |title=Snowden Documentary to Premiere at NY Festival |date=July 1, 2013 |accessdate=April 11, 2015 |agency=Associated Press |publisher=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two-hour film was shot in various countries, tracing Snowden's time in Hong Kong and Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scmp.com/news/world/article/1614414/new-documentary-edward-snowden-covers-nsa-whistleblowers-hong-kong |title=Hong Kong in cinema spotlight in documentary on Edward Snowden |date=October 11, 2014 |work=South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released in the U.S. and Europe to wide acclaim from critics,&lt;ref name="meta"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/citizenfour/critic-reviews |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103010101/http://www.metacritic.com/movie/citizenfour/critic-reviews |title=Citizenfour (2014): Reviews |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=December 27, 2014 |dead-url=yes |archivedate=November 3, 2014 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and won the 2015 [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2015 |title=The 87th Academy Awards |work=oscars.org |accessdate=February 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snowden declared in a February 2015 [[Reddit]] [[Reddit#IAmA and AMA|AMA]] ("Ask Me Anything") that he had no commercial interest in the film.&lt;ref name=RedditAMA&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2wwdep/we_are_edward_snowden_laura_poitras_and_glenn/ |title=We are Edward Snowden, Laura Poitras and Glenn Greenwald from the Oscar-winning documentary CITIZENFOUR |website=Reddit |accessdate=February 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014, ''[[Killswitch (film)|Killswitch]]'', a film that features Snowden as well as [[Aaron Swartz]], [[Lawrence Lessig]] and [[Tim Wu]], received its world premiere at the [[Woodstock Film Festival]], where it won the award for Best Editing. It has since played alongside ''[[Citizenfour]]'' at the [[International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam]] and has continued an international film festival run. The film probes the efforts of big business to control the [[Internet]], the efforts of government to regulate it, the efforts of [[hacktivists]] to free up information worldwide and the consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=von Busack |first1=Richard |title=Breaking the Internet: Killswitch Screens at Cinequest |url=http://www.metroactive.com/features/cinequest-2015/Killswitch-Edward-Snowden.html |accessdate=February 25, 2015 |publisher=Metro Silicon Valley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Battle for Internet Control Fuels O.C. -produced Movie |url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/film-657978-internet-big.html/ |accessdate=April 16, 2015 |publisher=Orange County Register}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Killswitch |url=http://www.idfa.nl/industry/tags/project.aspx?id=da0e5628-3c33-4419-b909-4649fa05e0af |website=International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam |accessdate=November 18, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416020454/http://www.idfa.nl/industry/tags/project.aspx?id=DA0E5628-3C33-4419-B909-4649FA05E0AF |archivedate=April 16, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second Snowden documentary, titled ''Snowden's Great Escape'', coproduced by Germany's [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk]] and Denmark's [[DR TV]], was released in 2015.

==Graphic novel==
In May 2014, ''Beyond: Edward Snowden'', a graphic novel by [[Marvel Comics]] writer [[Valerie D'Orazio]], illustrated by Dan Lauer, appeared in both print and digital editions as part a new series from [[Bluewater Productions]], which the publisher said would reveal secret and suppressed stories.&lt;ref name="GuardianComicBook"&gt;{{cite web |last=Flood |first=Alison |title=Edward Snowden gets his own graphic biography |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/20/edward-snowden-gets-graphic-biography-nsa-whistleblower |work=The Guardian |accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TimeComicBook"&gt;{{cite news |last=Feeney |first=Nolan |title=Edward Snowden, Comic-Book Hero |url=http://time.com/104921/edward-snowden-comic-book/ |work=TIME |accessdate=May 20, 2014 |date=May 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
On February 9, 2015, electronic pop producer [[Big Data (band)|Big Data]] released a song called "Snowed In" that featured vocals from [[Weezer]] frontman [[Rivers Cuomo]] from his debut album, ''[[2.0 (Big Data album)|2.0]]''. The song's lyrics, inspired by Snowden, are told from the perspective of the NSA, alternating between inner dialogue and statements made to the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sharp |first1=Tyler |title=Rivers Cuomo guests on new Big Data track, "Snowed In" |url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/rivers_cuomo_guests_on_new_big_data_track_snowed_in |accessdate=March 26, 2015 |work=Alternative Press |date=February 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Snowden provided the vocals for a track titled "Exit" by digital composer [[Jean-Michel Jarre]]. The track interspersed a beat and a few notes with a recorded monologue by Snowden expressing views about digital privacy. Business news publication [[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]] described it as "not exactly music" and part of a "gimmicky new wave of political audio".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://qz.com/662914/the-sounds-of-snowden-welcome-to-the-year-of-politics-poorly-disguised-as-music/ |title=Edward Snowden hooked up with a French electronica artist to cut a track about cybersecurity |publisher=Quartz |accessdate=March 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the rock band [[Thrice]] released a song titled "Whistleblower" off of the album ''[[To Be Everywhere Is to Be Nowhere]]''. The song is written from the perspective of Snowden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baeblemusic.com/musicblog/4-25-2016/blood-on-the-sand-a-conversation-with-thrice.html |title='Blood on the Sand:' A Conversation With Thrice |last1=Montemarano |first1=Mike |publisher=Baeble Music |accessdate=April 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2112">'''Framtiden i våre hender''' is an idealistic [[organization]] in [[Norway]] that advocates [[green consumption]] and [[resource justice]]. The [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] name literally translates to '''The Future in Our Hands'''.

The organization is critical of the ever-increasing consumption in [[rich countries]] such as [[Norway]], and believes that consideration for [[nature]] and [[climate]] is more important than growth in [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] and [[Economic growth|economy]]. The organization was inspired and founded by [[Erik Dammann]] in 1974,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-07-15|title=Framtiden i våre hender|url=http://snl.no/Framtiden_i_v%C3%A5re_hender|journal=Store norske leksikon|language=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is currently led by Anja Bakken Riise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nrk.no/nyheter/ny-leder-i-framtiden-i-vare-hender-1.13446808|title=Ny leder i Framtiden i våre hender|last=NRK|work=NRK|access-date=2017-09-22|language=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has approximately 27,000 members,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.framtiden.no/om-oss.html|title=Om oss - Framtiden.no|last=hender|first=Framtiden i våre|work=Framtiden.no|access-date=2017-09-13|language=nb-NO}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thereby is the largest environmental organization in Norway.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Core causes ==
The organization prioritizes three causes in particular:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

1) [[Fair pay]] for those who make the [[Product (business)|products]] we use in everyday life - such as [[clothing]], [[food]] and [[mobile phones]] - especially in [[poor countries]].

2) Reduced [[meat]] consumption and production: for the sake of [[Natural environment|environment]], [[public health]], and [[animal welfare]].

3) [[Fossil fuel divestment]]: shifting [[investment]] from the [[coal]], [[oil and gas industry]] to [[renewable energy]].

'''go tv''' is a 24-hour music and animation channel based in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. The channel launched on October 1, 2002. The channel targets audiences in Austria, but is also widely available throughout [[Europe]].

== Background ==
*Prior to the channels launch a local music channel TIV ("[[True Image Vision]]") broadcast in '''1996''' on UPC Telekabel in [[Vienna]]. With its success go tv CEO [[Thomas Maderbacher]] (member of Austrian band [[The Wiener]]) became a majority stakeholder in [[ET Multimedia]] and helped to launch Go TV on October 1, 2002. It became Austria's first youth and music channel. Upon its launch it was available to 1 million viewers and available on 50% of digital cable operators in Austria.
* The channel expanded into other parts of Europe when it began to broadcast unencrypted via [[Astra 19.2°E]] on May 1, 2004. The channel generally targets German speaking territories, mainly [[Austria]]. The channel is also available across Europe and is also available on some digital television providers in [[Switzerland]], [[Netherlands]] and [[Germany]].

== Strategy ==
The channel features music from established and underground local artists, as well as music particularly from [[Europe]] and [[North America]]. The channel is marketed through the [[German language]]. The channel features a broad music policy playing a mix of music from pop to rock, hip-hop to dance, heavy-metal to alternative and everything in between. Though the channel is primarily  marketed towards Austrian TV viewers, the channel is widely available throughout Europe on Astra satellite. The channel also offers viewers the latest news, events guide, competitions, music and film promos.

[[File:Hübschhorn vom Simplonpass aus gesehen.jpg|thumb|left|Hübschhorn seen from [[Simplon Pass]] (2017)]]

The '''Hübschhorn''' is a [[mountain]] of the [[Lepontine Alps]], overlooking the [[Simplon Pass]] in the canton of [[Valais]]. It belongs to the [[Monte Leone]] massif. Its altitude is 3190m/10'460ft.

==Access roads==

The car access is both from Italian and Swiss sides by following the road towards the [[Simplon pass]]. The closest cities are Domodossola on the Italian side and Brig on the Swiss side. If you need accommodation on the pass, you have Simplon Hospiz (Hospice du Simplon).  

==Normal climbing route==

To climb Hübschhorn you start walking from the road towards a small lake which is directly below the mountain (Rotelsee). From there continue up by following a hardly visible steep path. You will need around three hours from the road to the summit. 

You will be able to see the complete route to [[Wasenhorn]] and the glacier route to [[Breithorn (Simplon)]], and enjoy the views of the [[Weissmies]] group in the south-west direction.

The '''International Comparative Literature Association''' - '''ICLA''') (French '''Association Internationale de Littérature Comparée''' - '''AILC'''), founded in 1954, is an international organization for international research in the field of [[comparative literature]]. The Association seeks to foster the study of literature undertaken from an international point of view and attempts to realize this objective through international cooperation. It organizes international congresses, occurring every three years.

== History ==
The AILC/ICLA was founded in [[Oxford|Oxford, UK]] in 1954 in connection with the 6th Congress of the [[The International Federation for Modern Languages and Literatures (FILLM)|International Federation for Modern Languages and Literatures]] (FILLM).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gillespie|first=Gerard|date=2003|title=The International Comparative Literatures Association (AILC/ICLA): Association Internationale de Littérature Comparéé|journal=Diogenes|volume=50|issue=2|page=117|doi=10.1177/039219210305000211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Balakian Prize ==
In 2004, the Association, in collaboration with the [[Anna Balakian]] Foundation, established the '''Anna Balakian Prize'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ailc-icla.org/site/?page_id=1335&lt;/ref&gt; to promote scholarly research by younger comparatists and to honor the memory of Professor Anna Balakian, a great comparatist. The first prize winner was announced in 2007 in the XVIIIth Congress of the ICLA AILC in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Past recipients of the Balakian Prize are:

'''''Korsaren''''' ('The [[wikt:corsair|Corsair]]') was a [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] satirical magazine published between 1879 and 1926.

==History and profile==
''Korsaren'' was established in 1879 by [[Jacob Breda Bull]] under the name ''Krydseren'', mimicking an [[Krydseren|older publication of the same name]]. Bull sold the magazine in 1894, and it was relaunched as ''Korsaren''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=''Krydseren''|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|editor=Henriksen, Petter|url=http://www.snl.no/Krydseren|language=Norwegian|accessdate=25 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in [[Oslo|Kristiania]], its editor-in-chief from 1894 to 1903 was [[Egil Hartmann]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Egil Olaf Hartmann |encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]] |editor-last=Godal | editor-first=Anne Marit | editor-link=Anne Marit Godal |publisher=Norsk nettleksikon |location=Oslo |url=http://www.snl.no/Egil_Olaf_Hartmann |language=Norwegian|accessdate=13 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its staff of caricaturists included [[Andreas Bloch]] and [[Gustav Lærum]].

The Italian legal system has a plurality of sources of production. These are arranged in a hierarchical scale, under which the rule of a lower source cannot conflict with the rule of an upper source (hierarchy of sources).  

The Constitution of 1948 is the main source.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.loc.gov/law/help/guide/nations/italy.php&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian Civil Code is based on codified [[Roman law]] with elements of the [[Napoleonic civil code]] and of the [[German BGB]]. The civil code of 1942 replaced the original one of 1865.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.loc.gov/law/help/guide/nations/italy.php&lt;/ref&gt; The penal code ("The Rocco Code") was also written under fascism (1930). 

Both the civil code and the penal code have been modified in order to be in conformity with the current democratic constitution.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.loc.gov/law/help/guide/nations/italy.php&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legislative power ==
117 article of the [[Constitution of Italy]] shares legislative power, according to the concerned matters, between [[Italian Parliament]]&lt;ref&gt;Occasional parliamentary majorities can have serious distortive effects on the legislation, such as ignoring warnings of qualified organs regarding the lack of an administrative or financial cover for certain provisions: {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title = Nei disegni di legge di conversione solo emendamenti "in tema"|journal= Guida agli enti locali|date=2012| url=  https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89407977}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Regions of Italy#institutions|regional councils]]. While a law ratified by the national Parliament is simply called ''legge'' and is enforced on the whole country, laws ratified by regional councils are named ''leggi regionali'' (regional laws) and can be applied only in the concerned region.&lt;ref&gt;''Articolo 117'', [[Senate of the Republic (Italy)|Senate of the Republic]] official website: [http://www.senato.it/1025?sezione=136&amp;articolo_numero_articolo=117 www.senato.it]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Little Saturday''' ({{lang-bg|малката събота}}, [[Bokmål]] and {{lang-da|Lille Lørdag}}, {{lang-fi|pikkulauantai}}, {{lang-nn|Litle Laurdag}}, {{lang-sv|Lill-Lördag}}) is a European concept especially celebrated in [[Sweden|Swedish]], [[Norway|Norwegian]], [[Finland|Finnish]] and [[Bulgaria|Bulgarian]] that adds Wednesday to the list of "drinking days". Many [[nightclub]]s and [[bar (establishment)|bars]] stay open late and offer many kinds of ''little Saturday specials'' (rock shows, cheaper drinks etc.) Swedish and Norwegian [[teenager]]s and [[Adulthood|young adults]] often use ''Lill-Lördag'', ''Lille Lørdag'' as a synonym for Wednesday (''Onsdag'' in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]). In Bulgaria "малката събота" or The Little Saturday is well known among the youths and the elderly generations as well. In the UK and Ireland Little Saturday Wednesdays offer student discounts in some bars, and the Wednesday as Little Saturday is in some places seen as the students night out, although it is not as widespread as in the other countries in this article.

In [[Sweden]], the tradition comes from ''piglördag'' (the maids Saturday), which fell on a Wednesday. That was the day when the maid had her day off, as she normally didn't have any time off on Saturdays.

"Little Saturday" is also a common term among residents of the Knox Prairie, North Texas Plains, referring to an early weekend break.

"Little Saturday" referring to Wednesday is also a well known concept amongst South Africans, young and old and is used to justify a mid-week tipple when the week seems too long.

In Ithaca NY, Little Saturdays are referenced to as "Group Therapy"

In [[Bulgaria]] "Малката събота" or the "Little Saturday" is very common for people to go out and drink. The common perception is that a person will get very drunk on Wednesday and use Thursday to go to work to sober up until that same person is sober enough to go out on Friday and get drunk again after work.

'''Moustafa Ismail''' (born 1988) is an [[Egypt]]ian [[bodybuilder]], who once held the [[Guinness World Records]] for the largest upper arm circumference in the world. This has been attributed to his extensive [[Synthol (bodybuilding)|synthol]] use. The [[Guinness World Records]] now states that it has taken the decision to no longer accept claims for largest upper arm circumference on the grounds that there are too many evidentiary variables to ensure a declarative benchmark that is firmly beyond dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2013/1/guinness-world-records-statement-largest-upper-arm-circumference-46757 |title=statement: Largest upper arm circumference |publisher=[[Guinness World Records]] |date=2013-01-01 |accessdate=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.muscleandfitness.com/athletes-celebrities/largest-biceps-world-record-holder-proves-hes-legit |title=Mo Ismail - Guinness World Record for Largest Biceps |website=Muscleandfitness.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/11/28/big-mo-moustafa-ismail-worlds-largest-arms-bodybuilding_n_2202731.html |title=Bodybuilder 'Big Mo' Moustafa Ismail Claims World's Largest Biceps Are Real (VIDEO) |publisher=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=2012-11-28 |accessdate=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121130050601/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2239796/Moustafa-Ismails-real-life-Popeye-arms-What-steroids-Egyptian-defends-natural-31-inch-biceps.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''' National Liberation Front''' ({{lang-fr|'''Front de Libération Nationale'''}} - '''FROLINA''') is an ethnically [[Hutu]] rebel group that sometimes functions as a [[political party]] in [[Burundi]]. The FLN has been considered a minor group in the [[Burundian Civil War]] compared to the [[National Council for the Defense of Democracy-Forces for the Defense of Democracy]], and to [[PALIPEHUTU]]-FNL which only recently signed a cease fire.

'''Saint Jonas' Festival''', also known as ''Rasos'' (''Dew Holiday''), ''Joninės'', ''Kupolė'', [[Midsummer Day]] or [[Nativity of Saint John the Baptist|Saint John's Day]]) is a [[midsummer]] [[folk festival]] celebrated on June 24 all around [[Lithuania]]. While midsummer day is celebrated throughout Europe, many Lithuanians have a particularly lively agenda on this day. The traditions include singing [[Daina (Lithuania)|songs]] and dancing until the sun sets, telling tales, searching to find the magic fern blossom at midnight, jumping over bonfires, greeting the rising midsummer sun and washing the face with a morning dew, young girls float flower wreaths on the water of river or lake. These are customs brought from [[Lithuanian mythology|pagan culture and beliefs]].

Once upon a time the [[Balts]], the ancestors of the Lithuanians, celebrated the feast of Rasos by offering sacrifices to the [[List of Lithuanian mythological figures|pagan gods]], and priestesses incited the altar fire. Only when Christianity came to Lithuania, this festival was identified with St. John name-day and since then was called Joninės (St. John's). Lithuanians with the names Jonas, Jonė, Janina receive many greetings from their family, relatives and friends.

It is a civil society organisation with a focus on [[Information and Communications Technology|ICT]], which was founded in 1987, and has a history closely linked to the social and political changes experienced by South Africa during its transition to democracy.

In 2006, SANGONeT launched a new joint venture, called www.sangotech.org whose aim is to "meet and respond to the South African NGO sector's connectivity, hardware and e-business infrastructure * requirements."

==Central Case Management System==
The Central Case Management System (CCMS) is an [[open source software]] that was developed by SANGONeT for the [[paralegal]] sector in [[South Africa]]. Designed to allow multiple organisations and paralegal offices to access, input and modify a central [[database]] of case records, the CCMS is a web-based [[thin-client]] application that eliminates the need to install and maintain [[software]] at each office.

'''Sweden''' ({{lang-sv|Sverige}} {{IPA-sv|ˈsvæɾjɛ||Sv-Sverige.ogg}}), officially the '''Kingdom of Sweden''' (Swedish: {{Audio|Sv-Konungariket Sverige.ogg|''Konungariket Sverige''}}), is a [[Scandinavia]]n [[Nordic country]] in [[Northern Europe]]. It borders [[Norway]] to the west and north and [[Finland]] to the east, and is connected to [[Denmark]] in the southwest by [[Øresund Bridge|a bridge-tunnel]] across the [[Øresund|Öresund]], a strait at the Swedish-Danish border. At {{convert|450295|km2|sqmi}}, Sweden is the largest country in [[Northern Europe]], the third-largest country in the [[European Union]] and the [[List of European countries by area|fifth largest]] country in [[Europe]] by area. Sweden has a total population of 10.2&amp;nbsp;million&lt;ref name="population" /&gt; of which 2.4 million has a foreign background.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.statistikdatabasen.scb.se/pxweb/en/ssd/START__BE__BE0101__BE0101Q/UtlSvBakgGrov/?rxid=86abd797-7854-4564-9150-c9b06ae3ab07c9b06ae3ab07|title=Number of persons by foreign/Swedish background and year|last=|first=|date=|website=www.statistikdatabasen.scb.se|accessdate=8 June 2018|quote=2016 Foreign background 2 320 302}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a low population density of {{convert|22|PD/km2|PD/sqmi}}. The highest concentration is in the southern half of the country.

[[Germanic peoples]] have inhabited Sweden since prehistoric times, emerging into history as the [[Geats]] (Swedish Götar) and [[Swedes (Germanic tribe)|Swedes]] (Svear) and constituting the sea peoples known as the [[Norsemen]]. Southern Sweden is predominantly [[agriculture|agricultural]], while [[Norrland terrain|the north]] is heavily forested. Sweden is part of the geographical area of [[Fennoscandia]]. The [[Sweden#Climate|climate]] is in general very mild for its northerly latitude due to significant maritime influence, that in spite of this still retains warm continental summers. Today,  the [[sovereign state]] of Sweden is a [[constitutional monarchy]] and [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[democracy]], with a [[Monarchy of Sweden|monarch]] as [[head of state]], like its neighbour [[Norway]]. The [[capital city]] is [[Stockholm]], which is also the most populous city in the country.&lt;!-- see [[Stockholm#Historical population]] for ambiguity about Stockholm's population --&gt; [[Legislature|Legislative power]] is vested in the 349-member [[unicameral]] ''[[Riksdag]]''. [[Executive (government)|Executive power]] is exercised by the [[Government of Sweden|government]] chaired by the [[Prime Minister of Sweden|prime minister]]. Sweden is a [[unitary state]], currently divided into [[counties of Sweden|21 counties]] and [[Municipalities of Sweden|290 municipalities]].

An independent Swedish state emerged during the early 12th century. After the [[Black Death]] in the middle of the 14th century killed about a third of the Scandinavian population,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historiska.se/upptack-historien/artikel/digerdoden/|title=Digerdöden – Historiska Museet|website=historiska.se}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fof.se/tidning/2013/1/artikel/varre-forskarna-anat-digerdoden|title=Värre än forskarna anat: Digerdöden|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Hanseatic League]] threatened Scandinavia's culture, finances and languages.{{dubious|date=March 2018}} This led to the forming of the Scandinavian [[Kalmar Union]] in 1397,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.so-rummet.se/fakta-artiklar/sverige-under-medeltiden-:del-3-av-3-kalmarunionens-tid.|title=Artikelarkiv|website=SO-rummet}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Sweden left in 1523. When Sweden became involved in the [[Thirty Years War]] on the Reformist side, an expansion of its territories began and eventually the [[Swedish Empire]] was formed. This became one of the [[great power]]s of Europe until the early 18th century. Swedish territories outside the [[Scandinavian Peninsula]] were gradually lost during the 18th and 19th centuries, ending with the annexation of present-day Finland by [[Russian Empire|Russia]] in 1809. The last war in which Sweden was directly involved was in 1814, when Norway was militarily forced into [[Union between Sweden and Norway|personal union]]. Since then, Sweden has been at peace, maintaining an official policy of [[Swedish neutrality|neutrality]] in foreign affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/dec/2/among-the-disclosures-in-the-19-documents-released/ |title=WikiLeaks reveal Swedes gave intel on Russia, Iran |newspaper=[[The Washington Times]] |first=Ben |last=Birnbaum |date=2 December 2010 |accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The union with Norway was [[Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden|peacefully dissolved]] in 1905. Sweden was formally [[Swedish neutrality|neutral]] through both world wars and the [[Cold War]], albeit Sweden has since 2009 openly moved towards cooperation with [[NATO]].

After the end of the [[Cold War]], Sweden joined the European Union on 1 January 1995, but declined [[NATO]] membership, as well as [[Eurozone]] membership following a [[Swedish euro referendum, 2003|referendum]]. It is also a member of the [[United Nations]], the [[Nordic Council]], the [[Council of Europe]], the [[World Trade Organization]] and the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD). Sweden maintains a [[Nordic model|Nordic social welfare system]] that provides [[universal health care]] and [[tertiary education]] for its citizens. It has the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|world's eleventh-highest per capita income]] and ranks highly in numerous metrics of national performance, including [[quality of life]], health, [[Education Index|education]], protection of [[Freedom in the World|civil liberties]], economic competitiveness, [[Gini coefficient|equality]], [[Legatum Prosperity Index|prosperity]] and [[Human Development Index|human development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_2013_EN_complete.pdf |title=2013 Human Development Report |publisher=[[United Nations Development Programme]] |accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OECD Better Life Index"&gt;{{cite web|title=OECD Better Life Index|url=http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/#/11111111111|publisher=[[OECD Publishing]]|accessdate=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wefcomp" /&gt;

== Etymology ==
{{Main|Name of Sweden}}

The name Sweden was loaned from Dutch in the 17th century to refer to Sweden as an emerging [[Swedish Empire|great power]]. Before Sweden's imperial expansion, [[Early Modern English]] used ''Swedeland''. Sweden is derived through [[back-formation]] from Old English ''Swēoþēod'', which meant "people of the Swedes" ([[Old Norse]] ''Svíþjóð'', [[Latin]] ''Suetidi''). This word is derived from ''Sweon/Sweonas'' (Old Norse ''Sviar'', Latin ''Suiones''). The Swedish name ''Sverige'' (a compound of the words ''Svea'' and ''rike'', with [[lenition]] of the consonant [k], first recorded in the cognate ''Swēorice'' in [[Beowulf]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hellquist |first=Elof |title=Svensk etymologisk ordbok |trans-title=Swedish etymological dictionary |year=1922 |publisher=Gleerup |location=Lund |language=Swedish |page=917 |url=http://runeberg.org/svetym/1005.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; literally means "realm of the [[Swedes (Germanic tribe)|Swedes]]", excluding the [[Geats]] in [[Götaland]].

Variations of the name ''Sweden'' are used in most languages, with the exception of [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] using ''Sverige'', [[Faroese language|Faroese]] ''Svøríki'', [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] ''Svíþjóð'', and the more notable exception of some [[Finnic languages]] where ''Ruotsi'' ([[Finnish language|Finnish]]) and ''Rootsi'' ([[Estonian language|Estonian]]) are used, names commonly considered as referring to the people from the coastal areas of [[Roslagen]], [[Uppland]], who were known as the ''[[Rus' people|Rus']]'', and through them etymologically related to the English name for [[Russia]].

The etymology of ''Swedes'', and thus ''Sweden'', is generally not agreed upon but may derive from [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] ''Swihoniz'' meaning "one's own",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hellquist |first=Elof |title=Svensk etymologisk ordbok |trans-title=Swedish etymological dictionary |year=1922 |publisher=Gleerup |location=Lund |language=Swedish |page=915}}&lt;/ref&gt; referring to one's own Germanic tribe.

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2015}}
{{Main|History of Sweden}}

===Prehistory===
{{Main|Prehistoric Sweden}}
[[File:Vendel I helmet 456057.jpg|thumb|A [[Vendel era|Vendel-era]] helmet, at the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities]]
Sweden's prehistory begins in the [[Allerød oscillation]],{{according to whom|date=May 2015}} a warm period around 12,000 BC, with Late [[Palaeolithic]] [[reindeer]]-hunting camps of the [[Bromme culture]] at the edge of the ice in what is now the country's southernmost province, [[Scania]]. This period was characterised by small bands of [[Hunter-gatherer|hunter-gatherer-fishers]] using [[flint]] technology.

Sweden is first described in a written source in ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'' by [[Tacitus]] in 98 AD. In [[s:Germania#XLIV|Germania 44 and 45]] he mentions the Swedes (''Suiones'') as a powerful tribe (''distinguished not merely for their arms and men, but for their powerful fleets'') with ships that had a [[prow]] at each end ([[longship]]s). Which kings (''kuningaz'') ruled these Suiones is unknown, but [[Norse mythology]] presents a long line of legendary and semi-legendary kings going back to the last centuries BC. As for literacy in Sweden itself, the [[runic alphabet|runic script]] was in use among the south Scandinavian elite by at least the 2nd century AD, but all that has come down to the present from the Roman Period is curt inscriptions on artefacts, mainly of male names, demonstrating that the people of south Scandinavia spoke [[Proto-Norse]] at the time, a language ancestral to Swedish and other [[North Germanic languages]].{{Primary source inline|date=May 2015}}

In the 6th century [[Jordanes]] names two tribes living in [[Scandza]], both of which are now considered to be synonymous with the Swedes: the ''Suetidi'' and ''Suehans''. ''Suetidi'' is considered to be the Latin form of ''Svíþjóð'', the Old Norse name for the Swedes. Jordanes describes the ''Suetidi'' and ''[[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Dani]]'' as being of the same stock and the tallest of people. He later mentions other Scandinavian tribes as being of a same stature.{{Primary source inline|date=May 2015}} The ''Suehans'' were known to the Roman world as suppliers of black fox skins and, according to Jordanes, had very fine horses, similar to those of the ''[[Thuringians|Thyringi]]'' of ''Germania'' (''alia vero gens ibi moratur Suehans, quae velud Thyringi equis utuntur eximiis''). The Icelandic historian [[Snorri Sturluson]] also wrote that the Swedish king [[Adils]] (Eadgils) had the finest horses of his day.

===The Vikings===
{{See also|Early Swedish history|Foundation of Modern Sweden|Varangians}}
[[File:Vikings-Voyages.png|thumb|[[Viking]] expeditions (blue): going into Russia were Swedish Vikings.]]
[[File:Bildsten med skepp 800-1099 Tjängvide, Gotland.jpg|thumb|A [[picture stone]] from 800-1099 Tjängvide, [[Gotland]].]]
The Swedish [[Viking Age]] lasted roughly from the 8th century to the 11th century. It is believed that Swedish Vikings and [[Gutar]] mainly travelled east and south, going to Finland, the [[Baltic countries]], Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, the [[Black Sea]] and even as far as [[Baghdad]]. Their routes passed [[The Trade Route from the Varangians to the Greeks|through the Dnieper]] south to [[Constantinople]], on which they carried out numerous raids. The [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Theophilos (emperor)|Theophilos]] noticed their great skills in war, and invited them to serve as his personal bodyguard, known as the [[Varangian Guard]]. The Swedish Vikings, called [[Rus (people)|Rus]] are believed to be the founding fathers of [[Kievan Rus']]. The Arab traveller [[Ibn Fadlan]] described these Vikings as follows:

[[File:Ales stenar - KMB - 16000300016279.jpg|thumb|[[Ale's Stones]]]]

{{quote|I have seen the Rus as they came on their merchant journeys and encamped by the [[Volga|Itil]]. I have never seen more perfect physical specimens, tall as date palms, blond and ruddy; they wear neither tunics nor caftans, but the men wear a garment which covers one side of the body and leaves a hand free.

Oxford University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-19-280134-1}}. Page 164.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The actions of these Swedish Vikings are commemorated on many [[runestone]]s in Sweden, such as the [[Greece runestones]] and the [[Varangian runestones]]. There was also considerable participation in expeditions westwards, which are commemorated on stones such as the [[England runestones]]. The last major Swedish Viking expedition appears to have been the ill-fated expedition of [[Ingvar the Far-Travelled]] to [[Serkland]], the region south-east of the [[Caspian Sea]]. Its members are commemorated on the [[Ingvar runestones]], none of which mentions any survivor. What happened to the crew is unknown, but it is believed that they died of sickness.

=== The Kingdom of Sweden ===
{{synthesis|section|date=May 2015}}

It is not known when and how the kingdom of Sweden was born, but the [[list of Swedish monarchs]] is drawn from the first kings known to have ruled both [[Svealand]] (Sweden) and Götaland (Gothia) as one province, beginning with [[Eric the Victorious]]. Sweden and Gothia were two separate nations long before that and since antiquity. It is not known how long they existed: the epic poem ''Beowulf'' describes semi-legendary [[Swedish-Geatish wars]] in the 6th century. ''Götaland'' in this sense mainly includes the provinces of [[Östergötland]] (East Gothia) and [[Västergötland]] (West Gothia). The island of [[Gotland]] was disputed by other than Swedes, at this time (Danish, Hanseatic, and Gotland-domestic). [[Småland]] was at that time of little interest to anyone due to the deep pine forests, and only the city of [[Kalmar]] with its castle was of importance. The south-west parts of the Scandinavian peninsula consisted of three Danish provinces ([[Scania]], [[Blekinge]] and [[Halland]]). North of Halland, Denmark had a direct border to Norway and its province [[Bohuslän]]. But there were Swedish settlements along the southern coastline of [[Norrland]].

[[File:Suecia 1-064 ; Gambla Ubsala högar.png|thumb|[[Gamla Uppsala]] (Old Uppsala), a site of religious and political importance in the early days of Sweden]]

During the early stages of the Scandinavian Viking Age, [[Ystad]] in the [[Denmark|Danish]] province Scania and [[Paviken]] on Gotland were flourishing centres of trade, but they were not parts of the early Swedish Kingdom. Remains of what is believed to have been a large market dating from 600 to 700 AD have been found in Ystad.&lt;ref name="Sawyer" /&gt; In Paviken, an important centre of trade in the Baltic region during the 9th and 10th century, remains have been found of a large Viking Age harbour with shipbuilding yards and handicraft industries. Between 800 and 1000, trade brought an abundance of silver to Gotland, and according to some scholars, the Gotlanders of this era hoarded more silver than the rest of the population of Scandinavia combined.&lt;ref name="Sawyer"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sawyer |first1=Birgit |first2=Peter |last2=Sawyer |year=1993 |title=Medieval Scandinavia: from Conversion to Reformation, Circa 800–1500 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |isbn=0-8166-1739-2 |pages=150–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ansgar|St Ansgar]] is usually credited with introducing Christianity in 829, but the new religion did not begin to fully replace [[paganism]] until the 12th century. During the 11th century, Christianity became the prevalent religion, and from 1050 Sweden is counted as a Christian nation. The period between 1100 and 1400 was characterised by internal power struggles and competition among the Nordic kingdoms. In the years 1150–1293 according to the legend of [[Eric IX of Sweden|Eric IX]] and the ''[[Eric Chronicles]]'' Swedish kings made a [[First Swedish Crusade|first]], [[Second Swedish Crusade|second]] and [[Third Swedish Crusade|third crusade]] to pagan Finland against [[Finns proper|Finns]], [[Tavastians]] and [[Karelians]] and started conflicts with the [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']] who no longer had any connection with Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bagge |first=Sverre |chapter=The Scandinavian Kingdoms |title=The New Cambridge Medieval History |editor-first=Rosamond |editor-last=McKitterick |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2005 |isbn=0-521-36289-X |page=724 |quote=Swedish expansion in Finland led to conflicts with Rus', which were temporarily brought to an end by a peace treaty in 1323, dividing the Karelian peninsula and the northern areas between the two countries.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Swedish colonisation of Finland|Swedish colonisation]] of the coastal areas of Finland started also during the 12th and 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=När kom svenskarna till Finland?|editor-first=Ann-Marie|editor-last=Ivars|editor-first2=Lena|editor-last2= Hulden|publisher=Studier utg. av Svenska Litteratursällskapet i Finland 646|year=2002|isbn=|location=Helsinki|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Om svenskarnes inflyttningar till Finland|last=Meinander|first=Carl Fredrik|publisher=Historisk Tidskrift för Finland 3/1983|year=1983|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 14th century, the Swedish colonisation of coastal areas of Finland began to be more organised and in the end of the century several of the coastal areas of Finland were inhabited mostly by Swedes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sveriges Österland: Från forntiden till Gustav Vasa.

Except for the provinces of Scania, Blekinge and Halland in the south-west of the Scandinavian peninsula, which were parts of the Kingdom of Denmark during this time, [[feudalism]] never developed in Sweden as it did in the rest of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Franklin D. |last=Scott |title=Sweden: The Nation's History |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |location=Minneapolis |year=1977 |page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; The peasantry therefore remained largely a class of free farmers throughout most of Swedish history. [[Slavery]] (also called [[thrall]]dom) was not common in Sweden,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://runeberg.org/nfcj/0106.html |title=Nordisk familjebok: konversationslexikon och realencyklopedi.

Former slaves tended to be absorbed into the peasantry, and some became labourers in the towns. Still, Sweden remained a poor and economically backward country in which barter was the primary means of exchange. For instance, the farmers of the province of [[Dalsland]] would transport their butter to the mining districts of Sweden and exchange it there for iron, which they would then take to the coast and trade for fish, which they consumed, while the iron would be shipped abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, pp. 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Skogbonaden.jpg|thumb|[[Skog tapestry]], made most probably during the late 13th century.]]

In the middle of the 14th century, Sweden was struck by the [[Black Death]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott, pp. 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt; The population of Sweden and most of Europe was seriously decimated. The population (at same territory) did not reach the numbers of the year 1348 again until the beginning of the 19th century. One third of the population died in the triennium of 1349–1351. During this period, the Swedish cities began to acquire greater rights and were strongly influenced by German merchants of the [[Hanseatic League]], active especially at [[Visby]]. In 1319, Sweden and Norway were united under King Magnus Eriksson, and in 1397 Queen [[Margaret I of Denmark]] effected the personal union of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark through the [[Kalmar Union]]. However, Margaret's successors, whose rule was also centred in Denmark, were unable to control the Swedish nobility.

Many times the Swedish crown was inherited by children kings over the course of the kingdom's existence; consequently real power was held for long periods by regents (notably those of the [[Sture]] family) chosen by the Swedish parliament. King [[Christian II of Denmark]], who asserted his claim to Sweden by force of arms, ordered a massacre of Swedish nobles in Stockholm in 1520. This came to be known as the "[[Stockholm blood bath]]" and stirred the Swedish nobility to new resistance and, on 6 June (now Sweden's national holiday) in 1523, they made [[Gustav I of Sweden|Gustav Vasa]] their king.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; This is sometimes considered as the [[foundation of modern Sweden]]. Shortly afterwards the new king rejected Catholicism and led Sweden into the [[Protestant Reformation]].

The Hanseatic League had been officially formed at [[Lübeck]] on the Baltic coast of [[Holy Roman Empire|Northern Germany]] in 1356. The League sought civil and commercial privileges from the princes and royalty of the countries and cities along the coasts of the Baltic Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Robert S. |last1=Hoyt |first2=Stanley |last2=Chodorow |title=Europe in the Middle Ages |publisher=Harcourt, Brace &amp; Jovanovich, Inc. |location=New York |year=1976 |page=628}}&lt;/ref&gt; In exchange, they offered a certain amount of protection to the joining cities. Having their own navy, the Hansa were able to sweep the Baltic Sea free of pirates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John B. |last=Wolfe |title=The Emergence of European Civilization |publisher=Harper &amp; Row Pub. |location=New York |year=1962 |pages=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The privileges obtained by the Hansa included assurances that only Hansa citizens would be allowed to trade from the ports where they were located. They sought agreement to be free of all customs and taxes. With these concessions, Lübeck merchants flocked to Stockholm, where they soon came to dominate the city's economic life and made the port city of Stockholm into the leading commercial and industrial city of Sweden.&lt;ref name="Scott, p. 52"&gt;Scott, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Hanseatic trade, two-thirds of Stockholm's imports consisted of [[textiles]], while the remaining third was [[salt]]. The main exports from Sweden were [[iron]] and [[copper]].&lt;ref name="Scott, p. 52"/&gt;

However, the Swedes began to resent the monopoly trading position of the Hansa (mostly consisting of German citizens), and to resent the income they felt they lost to the Hansa. Consequently, when Gustav Vasa or [[Gustav I of Sweden|Gustav I]] broke the monopoly power of the Hanseatic League he was regarded as a hero by the Swedish people.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; History now views Gustav I as the father of the modern Swedish nation. The foundations laid by Gustav would take time to develop. Furthermore, when Sweden did develop, freed itself from the Hanseatic League, and entered its golden era, the fact that the peasantry had traditionally been free meant that more of the economic benefits flowed back to them rather than going to a feudal landowning class.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, pp. 156–157.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 17th century Sweden emerged as a European [[great power]]. Before the emergence of the Swedish Empire, Sweden was a poor and scarcely populated country on the fringe of European civilisation, with no significant power or reputation. Sweden rose to prominence on a continental scale during the tenure of king [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus Adolphus]], seizing territories from Russia and [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland–Lithuania]] in multiple conflicts, including the [[Thirty Years' War]].

During the Thirty Years' War, Sweden conquered approximately half of the Holy Roman states. Gustav Adolphus planned to become the new [[Holy Roman Emperor]], ruling over a united Scandinavia and the Holy Roman states, but he died at the [[Battle of Lützen (1632)|Battle of Lützen]] in 1632. After the [[Battle of Nördlingen (1634)|Battle of Nördlingen]], Sweden's only significant military defeat of the war, pro-Swedish sentiment among the German states faded. These German provinces excluded themselves from Swedish power one by one, leaving Sweden with only a few northern German territories: [[Swedish Pomerania]], [[Bremen-Verden]] and [[Wismar]].

In the middle of the 17th century Sweden was the third-largest country in Europe by land area, only surpassed by Russia and Spain. Sweden reached its largest territorial extent under the rule of [[Charles X of Sweden|Charles X]] after the [[treaty of Roskilde]] in 1658.&lt;ref name="HayesPSH"&gt;"A Political and Social History of Modern Europe V.1./Hayes..."

The Swedes conducted a series of invasions into the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, known as the [[Deluge (history)|Deluge]]. After more than half a century of almost constant warfare, the Swedish economy had deteriorated. It became the lifetime task of Charles' son, [[Charles XI of Sweden|Charles XI]], to rebuild the economy and refit the army. His legacy to his son, the coming ruler of Sweden, [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]], was one of the finest arsenals in the world, a large standing army and a great fleet. Sweden's largest threat at this time, Russia, had a larger army but was far behind in both equipment and training.

After the [[Battle of Narva (1700)|Battle of Narva]] in 1700, one of the first battles of the [[Great Northern War]], the Russian army was so severely devastated that Sweden had an open chance to invade Russia. However, Charles did not pursue the Russian army, instead turning against Poland–Lithuania and defeating the Polish king, [[Augustus II]], and his Saxon allies at the [[Battle of Klissow]] in 1702. This gave Russia time to rebuild and modernise its army.

After the success of invading Poland, Charles decided to make an attempt at invading Russia, but this ended in a decisive Russian victory at the [[Battle of Poltava]] in 1709. After a long march exposed to [[Cossack]] raids, the Russian Tsar [[Peter the Great]]'s [[scorched-earth]] techniques and [[Great Frost of 1709|the extremely cold winter of 1709]], the Swedes stood weakened with a shattered morale and were enormously outnumbered against the Russian army at Poltava. The defeat meant the beginning of the end for the Swedish Empire. In addition, [[The plague during the Great Northern War|the plague raging in East Central Europe]] devastated the Swedish dominions and reached Central Sweden in 1710.

Charles XII attempted to invade Norway in 1716, but he was shot dead at [[Fredriksten]] fortress in 1718. The Swedes were not militarily defeated at Fredriksten, but the whole structure and organisation of the campaign fell apart with the king's death, and the army withdrew.

Forced to cede large areas of land in the [[Treaty of Nystad]] in 1721, Sweden also lost its place as an empire and as the dominant state on the Baltic Sea. With Sweden's lost influence, Russia emerged as an empire and became one of Europe's dominant nations. As the war finally ended in 1721, Sweden had lost an estimated 200,000 men, 150,000 of those from the area of present-day Sweden and 50,000 from the [[History of Finland#17th century – the Swedish Empire|Finnish]] part of Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.is/20120530021358/http://www.algonet.se/~hogman/slsoldat.htm Losses statistics at Militaria].'' (Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, Sweden did not have enough resources to maintain its territories outside Scandinavia, and most of them were lost, culminating with the loss in 1809 of eastern Sweden to Russia, which became the highly autonomous [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Grand Principality of Finland]] in [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]].

In interest of re-establishing Swedish dominance in the Baltic Sea, Sweden allied itself against its traditional ally and benefactor, France, in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Sweden's role in the [[Battle of Leipzig]] gave it the authority to force Denmark–Norway, an ally of France, to cede Norway to the King of Sweden on 14 January 1814 in exchange for northern German provinces, at the [[Treaty of Kiel]]. The Norwegian attempts to keep their status as a sovereign state were rejected by the Swedish king, [[Charles XIII]]. He launched a military campaign against Norway on 27 July 1814, ending in the [[Convention of Moss]], which forced Norway into a [[Union between Sweden and Norway|personal union]] with Sweden under the Swedish crown, which lasted until 1905. The 1814 campaign was the last time Sweden was at war.

Many looked towards America for a better life during this time. It is thought that between 1850 and 1910 more than one million Swedes moved to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Einhorn, Eric and John Logue (1989), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, more Swedes lived in Chicago than in [[Gothenburg]] (Sweden's second largest city).&lt;ref&gt;Ulf Beijbom, [http://www.americanwest.com/swedemigr/pages/emigra.htm "European emigration", The House of Emigrants, Växjö, Sweden] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803004438/http://www.americanwest.com/swedemigr/pages/emigra.htm |date=3 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Swedish [[immigrants]] moved to the [[Midwestern United States]], with a large population in [[Minnesota]], with a few others moving to other parts of the United States and Canada.

Despite the slow rate of industrialisation into the 19th century, many important changes were taking place in the agrarian economy due to constant innovations and a rapid population growth.&lt;ref name="Koblik9-10"&gt;Koblik, pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; These innovations included government-sponsored programmes of [[enclosure]], aggressive exploitation of agricultural lands, and the introduction of new crops such as the potato.&lt;ref name="Koblik9-10" /&gt; Because the Swedish peasantry had never been enserfed as elsewhere in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-29865/Sweden#403810.hook |title=Sweden: Social and economic conditions (2007) |publisher=Britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Swedish farming culture began to take on a critical role in Swedish politics, which has continued through modern times with modern Agrarian party (now called the Centre Party).&lt;ref&gt;Koblik, p. 11: "The agrarian revolution in Sweden is of fundamental importance for Sweden's modern development. Throughout Swedish history the countryside has taken an unusually important role in comparison with other European states."&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1870 and 1914, Sweden began developing the industrialised economy that exists today.&lt;ref&gt;Koblik, p. 90. "It is usually suggested that between 1870 and 1914 Sweden emerged from its primarily agrarian economic system into a modern industrial economy."&lt;/ref&gt;

Strong grassroots movements sprung up in Sweden during the latter half of the 19th century (trade unions, [[temperance movement|temperance]] groups, and independent religious groups), creating a strong foundation of democratic principles. In 1889 The Swedish Social Democratic Party was founded. These movements precipitated Sweden's migration into a modern parliamentary democracy, achieved by the time of World War I. As the [[Industrial Revolution]] progressed during the 20th century, people gradually moved into cities to work in factories and became involved in socialist unions. A communist revolution was avoided in 1917, following the re-introduction of [[parliamentarism]], and the country was [[Democracy|democratised]].

Sweden was officially neutral during [[World War I]], although, under German pressure, they did take steps which were detrimental to the Allied powers including mining the [[Øresund]] channel, thus closing it to Allied shipping, and allowing the Germans to use Swedish facilities and the Swedish cipher to transmit secret messages to their overseas embassies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Siney|first=Marion C.|title=Swedish neutrality and economic warfare in World War I|journal=Conspectus of History|year=1975|volume=1|issue=2|url=http://libx.bsu.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/ConspectusH&amp;CISOPTR=410&amp;REC=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden also allowed volunteers fighting for the [[White Guard (Finland)|White Guards]] together with the Germans against the Reds and Russians in the [[Finnish Civil War]], and briefly occupied the [[Åland Islands]] in co-operation with Germany.

[[File:Swedish soldier during ww2.JPG|thumb|left|A Swedish soldier during World War II. Sweden remained neutral during the conflict.]]

As in the first world war, Sweden remained officially neutral during [[World War II]], although its neutrality during World War II has been disputed.&lt;ref name="Koblik303-313"&gt;Koblik, pp. 303–313.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nordstrom, p. 315: "Sweden's government attempted to maintain at least a semblance of neutrality while it bent to the demands of the prevailing side in the struggle. Although effective in preserving the country's sovereignty, this approach generated criticism at home from many who believed the threat to Sweden was less serious than the government claimed, problems with the warring powers, ill feelings among its neighbours, and frequent criticism in the postwar period."&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden was under German influence for much of the war, as ties to the rest of the world were cut off through blockades.&lt;ref name="Koblik303-313" /&gt;&lt;!---Koblik, pg. 307. "Through the blockade of foreign trade that culminated in the establishment of the [[Skagerrak]] blockade in connection with the German invasion of Denmark and Norway in April 1940, Swedish imports were reduced by approximately one-half and exports by about one-third in comparison with the average volume of 1936–1938."---&gt; The Swedish government felt that it was in no position to openly contest Germany,&lt;ref name="NB313-319" /&gt;&lt;!---Nordstrom, pg. 315 "Charting a path that might ensure the survival of the state was the government's primary goal."---&gt;&lt;!---Nordstrom, p. 319 "For a time virtually all of Sweden's production of industrial goods and raw materials ([[Swedish iron mining during World War II|especially iron ore]]) went to Germany in exchange for necessary fuels, food stuffs, and manufactured goods."---&gt; and therefore made some concessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zubicky|first=Sioma|year=1997|title=Med förintelsen i bagaget|language=Swedish|publisher=Bonnier Carlsen|location=Stockholm|isbn=91-638-3436-7|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden also supplied steel and machined parts to Germany throughout the war. However, Sweden supported Norwegian resistance, and in 1943 helped [[Rescue of the Danish Jews|rescue Danish Jews]] from deportation to [[Nazi concentration camps]]. The Swedish government also unofficially supported Finland in the [[Winter War]] and the [[Continuation War]] by allowing volunteers and [[materiel]] to be shipped to Finland.

During the last year of the war, Sweden began to play a role in humanitarian efforts, and many refugees, among them several thousand Jews from Nazi-occupied Europe, were rescued thanks to the [[White Buses|Swedish rescue missions to internment camps]] and partly because Sweden served as a haven for refugees, primarily from the [[Nordic countries]] and the Baltic states.&lt;ref name="NB313-319" /&gt;&lt;!---Nordstrom, p. 317: "In the last year of the war, Sweden became a factor in humanitarian efforts and attempts to end the war. It also became a haven for refugees from ''Norden'' and the Baltic states, and Swedes were involved in rescuing Scandinavian victims of internment camps." --- Nordstrom, p. 318: "By late 1943 Sweden was a haven for some 11,000 refugees from Denmark, including over 7,000 Danish Jews, and about 30,000 Norwegians."---&gt; The Swedish diplomat [[Raoul Wallenberg]] and his colleagues ensured the safety of tens of thousands of Hungarian Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/wallenberg.html |title=Raoul Wallenberg |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, both Swedes and others have argued that Sweden could have done more to oppose the Nazis' war efforts, even if it meant increasing the risk of occupation.&lt;ref name="NB313-319"&gt;Nordstrom, pp. 313–319.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-war era===
[[File:Olivecrona erlander 380.jpg|thumb|Prime Minister [[Tage Erlander]] (left) was Prime Minister under the ruling [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]] from 1946 to 1969.]]
Sweden was officially a neutral country and remained outside [[NATO]] and [[Warsaw Pact]] membership during the Cold War, but privately Sweden's leadership had strong ties with the United States and other western governments. Following the war, Sweden took advantage of an intact industrial base, social stability and its natural resources to expand its industry to supply the rebuilding of Europe.&lt;ref name="NB335-339"&gt;Nordstrom, pp. 335–339.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---Recovery from the material damage and economic shocks of the war was more rapid than many expected."---&gt; Sweden received aid under the [[Marshall Plan]] and participated in the OECD. During most of the post-war era, the country was governed by the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]] largely in co-operation with [[Swedish Trade Union Confederation|trade unions]] and industry. The government actively pursued an internationally competitive manufacturing sector of primarily large corporations.&lt;ref name="svensteinmo" /&gt;

Sweden was one of the founding states of the [[European Free Trade Area]] (EFTA). During the 1960s the EFTA countries were often referred to as the '''Outer Seven''', as opposed to the [[Inner Six]] of the then-[[European Economic Community]] (EEC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Finland: Now, the Seven and a Half |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=7 April 1961 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,874317,00.htm |accessdate=18 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sweden, like many industrialised countries, entered a period of economic decline and upheaval following the oil embargoes of 1973–74 and 1978–79.&lt;ref&gt;Nordstrom, p. 344: "During the last 25 years of the century a host of problems plagued the economies of Norden and the West. Although many were present before, the 1973 and 1980 global oil crises acted as catalysts in bringing them to the fore."&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s several key Swedish industries were significantly restructured. Shipbuilding was discontinued, wood pulp was integrated into modernised paper production, the steel industry was concentrated and specialised, and mechanical engineering was robotised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Krantz |first1=Olle |first2=Lennart |last2=Schön |year=2007 |title=Swedish Historical National Accounts, 1800–2000 |location=Lund |publisher=Almqvist and Wiksell International}}{{Page needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1970 and 1990 the overall tax burden rose by over 10%, and the growth was low compared to other countries in Western Europe. Eventually government began to spend over half of the country's gross domestic product. Sweden GDP per capita ranking declined during this time.&lt;ref name="svensteinmo"&gt;''Globalization and Taxation: Challenges to the Swedish Welfare State''. By Sven Steinmo.&lt;/ref&gt;

The response of the government was to cut spending and institute a multitude of reforms to improve Sweden's competitiveness, among them reducing the [[welfare state]] and [[Privatization|privatising]] public services and goods. Much of the political establishment promoted EU membership, and [[Swedish European Union membership referendum, 1994|a referendum]] passed with 52.3% in favour of joining the EU on 13 November 1994. Sweden joined the [[European Union]] on 1 January 1995. In a 2003 referendum the Swedish electorate [[Swedish euro referendum, 2003|voted against]] the country joining the [[European Monetary Union|Euro]] currency. In [[Swedish general election, 2006|2006]] Sweden got its first majority government for decades as the centre-right [[The Alliance (Sweden)|Alliance]] defeated the incumbent Social Democrat government. Following the rapid growth of anti-immigration [[Sweden Democrats]] and their entrance to the Riksdag in [[Swedish general election, 2010|2010]] the Alliance became a minority cabinet.

Sweden remains non-aligned militarily, although it participates in some joint military exercises with NATO and some other countries, in addition to extensive co-operation with other European countries in the area of defence technology and defence industry. Among others, Swedish companies export weapons that were used by the American military in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thelocal.se/article.php?ID=3013&amp;date=20060207 |title=New Swedish weapon in Iraq |newspaper=[[The Local]] |date=7 February 2006 |accessdate=10 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130429052619/http://www.thelocal.se/article.php?ID=3013&amp;date=20060207 |archivedate=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden also has a long history of participating in international military operations, including most recently, [[Afghanistan]], where Swedish troops are under NATO command, and in EU sponsored peacekeeping operations in [[Kosovo]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and [[Cyprus]]. Sweden also participated in [[2011 military intervention in Libya|enforcing]] a [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973|UN mandated no-fly zone]] over Libya during the [[Arab Spring]]. Sweden held the chair of the European Union from 1 July to 31 December 2009.

In recent decades Sweden has become a more culturally diverse nation due to significant immigration; in 2013 it was estimated that 15 per cent of the population was foreign-born, and an additional 5 per cent of the population were born to two immigrant parents. The influx of immigrants has brought new social challenges. Violent incidents have [[Rosengård#Violence in the Community|periodically occurred]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rioting breaks out in Malmö suburb |url=http://www.thelocal.se/16458/20081219/ |newspaper=[[The Local]] |accessdate=30 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130726145940/http://www.thelocal.se/16458/20081219/ |archivedate=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fires and rioting after Malmö suburb unrest |url=http://www.thelocal.se/26354/20100429/ |newspaper=[[The Local]] |accessdate=30 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130205114737/http://www.thelocal.se/26354/20100429/ |archivedate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[May 2013 Stockholm riots|2013 Stockholm riots]] which broke out following the police shooting of an elderly Portuguese immigrant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sweden Riots Put Faces to Statistics as Stockholm Burns|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-26/sweden-riots-put-faces-to-statistics-as-stockholm-burns.html|publisher=[[Bloomberg News]] |accessdate=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to these violent events, the [[Far-right politics|anti-immigration]] opposition party, the [[Swedish Democrats]], promoted their anti-immigration policies, while the [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] opposition blamed growing inequality caused by the [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]] government's socioeconomic policies.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news |last=Higgins |first=Andrew |date=26 May 2013 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/27/world/europe/swedens-riots-put-its-identity-in-question.html?pagewanted=all |title=In Sweden, Riots Put an Identity in Question |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [[Stefan Löfven]] (Social Democrats) won the General Election and became the new Swedish Prime Minister. The Sweden Democrats held the balance of power and voted the government's budget down in the Riksdag, but due to agreements between the government and the Alliance, the government was able to hang onto power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30610500|title=Sweden parties reach budget deal to avoid snap election|publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=27 December 2014|accessdate=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden was heavily affected by the [[2015 European migrant crisis]], eventually forcing the government to tighten regulations of entry to the country, as Sweden received thousands of asylum seekers and migrants predominantly from [[Africa]] and the [[Middle East]] per week in autumn, overwhelming existing structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/05/world/europe/sweden-denmark-border-check-migrants.html?_r=0|title=Sweden and Denmark add border controls to stem flows of migrants|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |first=Dan |last=Bilefsky |date=5 January 2016|accessdate=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Sweden}}
[[File:Vy mot Stora Sjöfallet från Saltoluokta.jpg|thumb|left|View of the [[Stora Sjöfallet National Park]]]]
Situated in Northern Europe, Sweden lies west of the [[Baltic Sea]] and [[Gulf of Bothnia]], providing a long coastline, and forms the eastern part of the [[Scandinavian Peninsula]]. To the west is the [[Scandinavian mountain chain]] (Skanderna), a range that separates Sweden from [[Norway]]. Finland is located to its north-east. It has maritime borders with Denmark, Germany, [[Poland]], Russia, [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]], and it is also linked to Denmark (south-west) by the [[Öresund Bridge]]. Its border with Norway ([[List of countries and territories by land borders|1,619 km]] long) is the longest uninterrupted border within Europe.

Sweden lies between latitudes [[55th parallel north|55°]] and [[70th parallel north|70° N]], and mostly between longitudes [[11th meridian east|11°]] and [[25th meridian east|25° E]] (part of [[Stora Drammen]] island is just west of 11°).

[[File:Landscape on Smögen Island, Bohuslän province (Sweden).jpg|thumb|Islands of [[Smögen|Smögen, Bohuslän]]]]

At {{convert|449964|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, Sweden is the 55th-largest country in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Country Comparison: Area|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2147rank.html?countryName=Sweden&amp;countryCode=sw&amp;regionCode=eu&amp;rank=55#sw|work=Central Intelligence Agency|publisher=Cia.gov|accessdate=19 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 4th-[[Area and population of European countries|largest country entirely in Europe]], and the largest in Northern Europe. The lowest elevation in Sweden is in the bay of Lake Hammarsjön, near [[Kristianstad]], at {{convert|-2.41|m|ft|2|abbr=on}} below sea level. The highest point is [[Kebnekaise]] at {{convert|2111|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]].

Sweden has 25 [[Provinces of Sweden|provinces]] or ''landskap'', based on culture, geography and history. While these provinces serve no political or administrative purpose, they play an important role in people's [[self-concept|self-identity]]. The provinces are usually grouped together in three large ''[[lands of Sweden|lands]]'', parts, the northern Norrland, the central Svealand and southern Götaland. The sparsely populated Norrland encompasses almost 60% of the country. Sweden also has the [[Vindelfjällens Nature Reserve|Vindelfjällen Nature Reserve]], one of the largest protected areas in Europe, totaling 562,772 ha (approx. 5,628&amp;nbsp;km{{sup|2}}).

About 15% of Sweden lies north of the [[Arctic Circle]]. Southern Sweden is predominantly agricultural, with increasing forest coverage northward. Around 65% of Sweden's total land area is covered with forests. The highest population density is in the [[Øresund Region|Öresund Region]] in southern Sweden, along the western coast up to central Bohuslän, and in the valley of lake [[Mälaren]] and Stockholm. Gotland and [[Öland]] are Sweden's largest [[islands of Sweden|islands]]; [[Vänern]] and [[Vättern]] are its largest lakes. Vänern is the third largest in Europe, after [[Lake Ladoga]] and [[Lake Onega]] in Russia. Combined with the third and fourth largest lakes Mälaren and [[Hjälmaren]], these lakes take up a significant part of the southern Sweden's area. Sweden's extensive waterway availability throughout the south was exploited with the building of the [[Göta Canal]] in the 19th century, shortening the potential distance between the Baltic Sea south of [[Norrköping]] and [[Gothenburg]] by using the lake and river network to facilitate the canal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gotakanal.se/en/|title=Göta kanal official website|publisher=[[Göta Canal]] |accessdate=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
[[File:Sweden Köppen.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Köppen climate classification]] types of Sweden]]
Most of Sweden has a [[temperate climate]], despite its northern [[latitude]], with largely four distinct seasons and mild temperatures throughout the year. The winter in the far south is usually weak and is only manifested through some shorter periods with snow and sub-zero temperatures, autumn may well turn into spring there, without a distinct period of winter. The country can be divided into three types of climate: the southernmost part has an [[oceanic climate]], the central part has a [[humid continental climate]] and the northernmost part has a [[subarctic climate]].
However, Sweden is much warmer and drier than other places at a similar latitude, and even somewhat farther south, mainly because of the combination of the [[Gulf Stream]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/climate/impact/gulf_stream.shtml |publisher=[[BBC]] |title=BBC Climate and the Gulf Stream|accessdate=29 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/res/div/ocp/gs/ |publisher=[[Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory]] |title=The Gulf Stream Myth|accessdate=29 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the general west wind drift, caused by the direction of planet Earth's rotation. Continental west-coasts (to which all of Scandinavia belongs, as the westernmost part of the [[Eurasia|Eurasian continent]]), are notably warmer than continental east-coasts; this can also be seen by comparing e.g. the Canadian cities of [[Vancouver]] and [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] with each other, the winter in west coast Vancouver is much milder; also, for example, central and southern Sweden has much milder winters than many parts of Russia, Canada, and the northern United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/WAICENT/FAOINFO/SUSTDEV/EIdirect/climate/EIsp0002.htm |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]] |title=Global Climate Maps |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061117173015/http://www.fao.org/waicent/faoinfo/sustdev/EIdirect/climate/EIsp0002.htm |archivedate=17 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its high latitude, the length of daylight varies greatly. North of the Arctic Circle, the [[Midnight sun|sun never sets]] for part of each summer, and [[Polar night|it never rises]] for part of each winter. In the capital, [[Stockholm]], daylight lasts for more than 18 hours in late June but only around 6 hours in late December. Sweden receives between 1,100 and 1,900 hours of sunshine annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smhi.se/klimatdata/meteorologi/stralning/1.3052 |title=Normal solskenstid för ett år |language=sv |publisher=[[Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute]] |accessdate=27 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During July there is not much difference in temperature between the north and south of the country. With the exception of in the mountains, the whole country has a July-average temperature within the range of +15.0 C to + 17.5 C (a difference of 2.5 degrees), while the January-average temperatures vary from freezing point down to below −15 C along the border with Finland (a difference of 15 degrees)&lt;ref&gt;as can be seen in the table below
which relies on [[SMHI]] official data for the latest fixed 30-year period, 1961 to 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wide image|Kebnekaise Panorama.jpg|800px|The [[Scandinavian Mountains]]}}

The highest temperature ever recorded in Sweden was {{convert|38|°C|°F|abbr=on}} in [[Målilla]] in 1947, while the coldest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|-52.6|°C|1|abbr=on}} in [[Vuoggatjålme]] in 1966. Temperatures expected in Sweden are heavily influenced by the large Fennoscandian landmass, as well as continental Europe and western Russia, which allows hot or cool inland air to be easily transported to Sweden. That in turn renders most of Sweden's southern areas having warmer summers than almost everywhere in the nearby [[British Isles]], even matching temperatures found along the continental Atlantic coast as far south as in northern [[Spain]]. In winter however the same high-pressure systems sometimes puts the entire country far below freezing temperatures. There is some maritime moderation from the Atlantic which renders the Swedish continental climate less severe than that of nearby Russia. Even though temperature patterns differ between north and south, the summer climate is surprisingly similar all through the entire country in spite of the large latitudal differences. This is due to the south being surrounded by a greater mass of water, with the wider Baltic Sea and the Atlantic air passing over lowland areas from the south-west.

Apart from the ice-free Atlantic bringing marine air into Sweden tempering winters, the mildness is further explained by prevailing low-pressure systems postponing winter, with the long nights often staying above freezing in the south of the country due to the abundant cloud cover. By the time winter finally breaks through, daylight hours rise quickly, ensuring that daytime temperatures soar quickly in spring. With the greater number of clear nights, frosts remain commonplace quite far south as late as April. The cold winters occur when low-pressure systems are weaker. An example is that the coldest ever month (January 1987) in Stockholm was also the sunniest January month on record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.smhi.se/met/climate/time_series/month/vov_pdf/SMHI_vov_precipitation_sunshine_jan15.pdf?71642|title=Precipitation, Sunshine &amp; Radiation for January 2015 (all-time records section)|language=sv |publisher=[[Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute]] |accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.smhi.se/met/climate/time_series/month/vov_pdf/SMHI_vov_temperature_wind_jan15.pdf?18701|title=Temperature &amp; Wind – January 2015 (all-time records section)|language=sv|publisher=[[Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute]] |accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relative strength of low and high-pressure systems of marine and continental air also define the highly variable summers. When hot continental air hits the country, the long days and short nights frequently bring temperatures up to {{convert|30|C|F}} or above even in coastal areas. Nights normally remain cool, especially in inland areas. Coastal areas can see so-called ''tropical nights'' above {{convert|20|C|F}} occur due to the moderating sea influence during warmer summers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smhi.se/kunskapsbanken/meteorologi/tropiska-natter-1.1085|title=Tropiska nätter |trans-title=Tropical nights |publisher=[[Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute]] |language=sv|accessdate=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Summers can be cool, especially in the north of the country. Transitional seasons are normally quite extensive and the four-season climate applies to most of Sweden's territory, except in Scania where some years do not record a [[meteorological winter]] (see table below) or in the high Lapland mountains where polar microclimates exist.

On average, most of Sweden receives between {{convert|500|and|800|mm|0|abbr=on}} of precipitation each year, making it considerably drier than the [[Precipitation (meteorology)|global average]]. The south-western part of the country receives more precipitation, between {{convert|1000|and|1200|mm|0|abbr=on}}, and some mountain areas in the north are estimated to receive up to {{convert|2000|mm|0|abbr=on}}. Despite northerly locations, southern and central Sweden may have almost no snow in some winters. Most of Sweden is located in the [[rain shadow]] of the Scandinavian Mountains through Norway and north-west Sweden. The blocking of cool and wet air in summer as well as the greater landmass leads to warm and dry summers far north in the country, with quite warm summers at the Bothnia Bay coast at 65 degrees latitude, which is unheard of elsewhere in the world at such northerly coastlines.

=== Vegetation ===
[[File:Sweden Vegetation Zones.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Map of Sweden's five major vegetation zones]]
Sweden has a considerable south to north distance (stretching between the [[latitude]]s N 55:20:13 and N 69:03:36) which causes large climatic difference, especially during the winter. The related matter of the length and strength of the four seasons plays a role in which plants that ''naturally'' can grow at various places. Sweden is divided in five major vegetation zones. These are:

* The southern deciduous forest zone
* The southern coniferous forest zone
* The northern coniferous forest zone, or the [[Taiga]]
* The alpine-birch zone
* The bare mountain zone

Please see the map to the right, Vegetation Zones in Sweden.

;Southern deciduous forest zone
Also known as the nemoral region, the southern deciduous forest zone is a part of a larger vegetation zone which also includes Denmark and large parts of Central Europe. It has to a rather large degree become agricultural areas, but larger and smaller forests still exist. The region is characterised by a large wealth of trees and shrubs. The [[beech]] are the most dominant tree, but [[oak]] can also form smaller forests. [[elm]] at one time formed forests, but have been heavily reduced due to [[Dutch Elm disease]]. Other important trees and shrubs in this zone include [[hornbeam]], [[Sambucus nigra|elder]], [[Corylus avellana|hazel]], [[Lonicera xylosteum|fly honeysuckle]], [[Tilia|linden (lime)]], [[Euonymus europaeus|spindle]], [[Taxus baccata|yew]], [[alder buckthorn]], [[blackthorn]], [[Populus tremula|aspen]], [[European rowan]], [[Swedish whitebeam]], [[Juniperus communis|juniper]], [[European holly]], [[Hedera helix|ivy]], [[Cornus sanguinea|dogwood]], [[goat willow]], [[Larix decidua|larch]], [[Prunus padus|bird cherry]], [[Prunus avium|wild cherry]], [[maple]], [[Fraxinus excelsior|ash]], [[alder]] along creeks, and in sandy soil [[birch]] compete with [[pine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.skogskunskap.se/planera-skogsbruk/naturhansyn/naturmiljoer-fran-norr-till-soder/sodra-lovskogsregionen/|title=Södra lövskogsregionen - Skogskunskap|website=www.skogskunskap.se}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spruce]] is not native but between approximately 1870 and 1980 large areas were planted with it.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lansstyrelsen.se/skane/Sv/samhallsplanering-och-kulturmiljo/landskapsvard/kulturmiljoprogram/historia-utveckling/skogens-landskap/skog-och-bebyggelse/Pages/index.aspx {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012055002/http://www.lansstyrelsen.se/skane/Sv/samhallsplanering-och-kulturmiljo/landskapsvard/kulturmiljoprogram/historia-utveckling/skogens-landskap/skog-och-bebyggelse/Pages/index.aspx |date=12 October 2017 }} Quote "''Granskogen, som spreds norrifrån, nådde inte Skåne förrän mot slutet av 1800-talet. Under 1900-talets första hälft planterades stora arealer granskog.''" or in English "The spruce forest, which spread from the north, did not reach Scania until the end of the 19th century. During the first half of the twentieth century, large areas of pine forest were planted."&lt;/ref&gt; They tend to grow too quickly due to being outside of their native range&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Karna_Hansson/publication/27655197_Bok-_och_grankonkurrens_i_Sydsverige_-_markegenskaper_och_naturlig_foryngring/links/00b7d524439c09588c000000/Bok-och-grankonkurrens-i-Sydsverige-markegenskaper-och-naturlig-foeryngring.pdf|title=Summary in English PDF, page 8 at|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and large distances between the tree rings cause poor board quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.skogsstyrelsen.se/om-oss/var-tidning-skogseko/skogseko-2-2017/skogen-vaxer-battre--men-riskerna-blir-fler/|title=Skogen växer bättre – men riskerna blir fler|website=www.skogsstyrelsen.se}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later some spruce trees began to die before reaching optimal height, and many more of the coniferous trees were uprooted during cyclones.&lt;ref&gt;Quote from [[Sydsvenska Dagbladet]], section "2" at [https://www.sydsvenskan.se/2015-01-04/en-kvarts-miljard-trad-foll-under-stormnatten],"''Efter stormen kritiserades skogsägarna för att de dominerande granskogarna gjorde att stormen tog hårdare. Uppblandning med lövträd gör skog stryktåligare''" or in English "After the storm, the spruce and pine forest owners were criticized for the domination of the forests that made the storm tougher. Admixture with hardwood makes forest more stringent"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Dagens Nyheter]] about the same. [https://www.dn.se/nyheter/vetenskap/analys-dags-plantera-lovskog-i-soder/]&lt;/ref&gt; During the last 40–50 years large areas of former spruce plantings have been replanted with deciduous forest.&lt;ref&gt;About the 1984 "Ädellövskogslagen" [http://www.naturait.se/adellovskogen/] - "''I Sydsverige (Skåne, Halland och Blekinge) skall minst 70% av beståndet utgöras av ädellöv. Enligt ädellövskogslagen skall efter slutavverkning, alltid ny ädellövskog anläggas på sådana marker.''" or "In southern Sweden (Scania, Halland and Blekinge) at least 70% of the stock must be of [[edible leaves]]. According to the 'edible deciduous forests law', after ever harvesting, new deciduous forests must always be planted on such fields." (in these three provinces)&lt;/ref&gt;

;Southern coniferous forest zone
Also known as the boreo-nemoral region, the southern coniferous forest zone, is delimited by the [[oak]]'s northern natural limit (''limes norrlandicus'') and the [[Spruce]]'s southern natural limit,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.skogskunskap.se/planera-skogsbruk/naturhansyn/naturmiljoer-fran-norr-till-soder/sodra-barrskogsregionen/|title=Södra barrskogsregionen - Skogskunskap|website=www.skogskunskap.se}}&lt;/ref&gt; between the southern deciduous zone and the [[Taiga]] farther north. In the southern parts of this zone the coniferous species are found, mainly [[spruce]] and [[pine]], mixed with various deciduous trees. [[Birch]] grows largely everywhere. The [[beech]]'s northern boundary crosses this zone. This is however not the case with [[oak]] and [[Fraxinus excelsior|ash]]. Although in its natural area, also ''planted'' Spruce are common, and such woods are very dense, as the spruces can grow very tight, especially in this vegetation zone's southern areas.

;Northern coniferous forest zone, or the [[Taiga]]
The northern coniferous forest zone begins north of the natural boundary of the [[oak]]. Of deciduous species the [[birch]] is the only one of significance. [[Pine]] and [[spruce]] are dominant, but the forests are slowly but surely more sparsely grown the farther towards the north it gets. In the extreme north is it difficult to state the trees forms true forests at all, due to the large distances between the trees.

;Alpine-birch and bare mountain zones
The alpine-birch zone, in the Scandinavian mountains, depending on both latitude and altitude, is an area where only a smaller kind of [[birch]] (''Betula pubescens'' or ''B.tortuosa'') can grow. Where this vegetation zone ends no trees grow at all: the bare mountain zone.&lt;ref&gt;Swedish Encyclopedia "Bonniers Lexikon", vol 13 of 15, article "Sverige", Sweden, columns 1046-1050&lt;/ref&gt;

Sweden has four fundamental laws ({{lang-sv|grundlagar}}) which together forms the [[Constitution of Sweden|Constitution]]: the Instrument of Government ({{lang-sv|Regeringsformen}}), the [[Swedish Act of Succession|Act of Succession]] ({{lang-sv|Successionsordningen}}), the Freedom of the Press Act ({{lang-sv|Tryckfrihetsförordningen}}), and the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression ({{lang-sv|Yttrandefrihetsgrundlagen}}).&lt;ref name="The Constitution"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.riksdagen.se/en/How-the-Riksdag-works/Democracy/The-Constitution/| title = The Constitution | publisher = The [[Riksdag]] | accessdate = 8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Petersson:38-40"&gt;[[#Petersson|Petersson]]: pp. 38–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Legislative power]] is vested in the [[unicameral]] Riksdag with 349 members. [[Elections in Sweden|General elections]] are held every four years, on the second Sunday of September. Legislation may be initiated by the Government or by members of the Riksdag. Members are elected on the basis of [[proportional representation]] to a four-year term. The internal workings of the Riksdag is, in addition to the Instrument of Government, regulated by the Riksdag Act ({{lang-sv|Riksdagsordningen}}).&lt;ref name="The Riksdag Act – almost a fundamental law"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.riksdagen.se/en/How-the-Riksdag-works/Democracy/The-Constitution/The-Riksdag-Act---almost-a-fundamental-law/ |title=The Riksdag Act – almost a fundamental law |publisher=The [[Riksdag]] |accessdate=9 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024155003/http://www.riksdagen.se/en/How-the-Riksdag-works/Democracy/The-Constitution/The-Riksdag-Act---almost-a-fundamental-law/ |archivedate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental laws can be altered by the Riksdag alone; only an absolute majority with two separate votes, separated by a general election in between, is required.&lt;ref name="The Constitution" /&gt;

=== Political parties and elections ===
[[File:Riksdag.ipred b9dn510 4451.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Riksdag]] chamber, at the time of a vote, in 2009]]
The Swedish Social Democratic Party has played a leading role in Swedish politics since 1917, after the [[Democratic socialism|Reformists]] had confirmed their strength and the [[Left Party (Sweden)|left-wing revolutionaries]] formed their own party. After 1932, most governments have been [[Dominant-party system#Europe|dominated]] by the Social Democrats. Only five general elections since World War II—[[Swedish general election, 1976|1976]], [[Swedish general election, 1979|1979]], [[Swedish general election, 1991|1991]], [[Swedish general election, 2006|2006]] and [[Swedish general election, 2010|2010]]—have given the assembled bloc of centre-right parties enough seats in the Riksdag to form a government.

For over 50 years, Sweden had had five parties who continually received enough votes to gain seats in the Riksdag—the Social Democrats, the [[Moderate Party]], the [[Centre Party (Sweden)|Centre Party]], the [[Liberal People's Party (Sweden)|Liberal People's Party]] and the Left Party—before the [[Green Party (Sweden)|Green Party]] became the sixth party in the [[Swedish general election, 1988|1988 election]]. In the 1991 election, while the Greens lost their seats, two new parties gained seats for the first time: the [[Christian Democrats (Sweden)|Christian Democrats]] and [[New Democracy (Sweden)|New Democracy]]. The [[Swedish general election, 1994|1994 election]] saw the return of the Greens and the demise of New Democracy. It was not until elections in 2010 that an eighth party, the [[Sweden Democrats]], gained Riksdag seats. In the elections to the [[European Parliament]], parties who have failed to pass the Riksdag threshold have managed to gain representation at that venue: the [[June List]] ([[European Parliament election, 2004 (Sweden)|2004–2009]]), the [[Pirate Party (Sweden)|Pirate Party]] ([[European Parliament election, 2009 (Sweden)|2009–2014]]), and [[Feminist Initiative (Sweden)|Feminist Initiative]] ([[European Parliament election, 2014 (Sweden)|2014–present]]).

[[File:Inför slutdebatten i SVT.jpg|thumb|left|The party leaders lined up before the start of the [[Sveriges Television|televised]] live debate on 12 September 2014.]]
In the [[Sweden general election, 2006|2006 general election]] the Moderate Party formed the centre-right [[Alliance for Sweden]] bloc and won a majority of the Riksdag seats.

The outcome of the [[Sweden general election, 2014|2014 general election]] resulted in the attainment of more seats by the three centre-left parties in comparison to the centre-right Alliance for Sweden, with the two blocs receiving 159 and 141 seats respectively.&lt;ref name="2014 Election Result"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.val.se/val/val2014/slutresultat/protokoll/protokoll_00R.pdf | title = Beslut 2014-09-20 | language = Swedish | publisher = [[Election Authority (Sweden)|Election Authority]] | accessdate = 8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The non-aligned Sweden Democrats more than doubled their support and won the remaining 49 seats.&lt;ref name="2014 Election Result" /&gt; On 3 October 2014, Stefan Löfven, formed a [[minority government]] consisting of the [[Löfven Cabinet|Social Democrats and the Greens]].&lt;ref name="Sweden's new Government"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.government.se/sb/d/575/a/247235 | title = Sweden's new Government | publisher = [[Government Offices of Sweden]] | accessdate = 8 November 2014 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141006234923/http://www.government.se/sb/d/575/a/247235 | archivedate = 6 October 2014 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Change of Government Council at the Royal Palace of Stockholm"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kungahuset.se/royalcourt/royalfamily/latestnews/latestnews/changeofgovernmentcouncilattheroyalpalaceofstockholm.5.67e94750148caf4ad27127.html | title = Change of Government Council at the Royal Palace of Stockholm | publisher = [[Royal Court of Sweden]] | accessdate = 8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Election turnout in Sweden has always been high by international comparison. Although it declined in recent decades, the latest elections saw an increase in voter turnout (80.11% in [[Sweden general election, 2002|2002]], 81.99% in 2006, 84.63% in 2010) and 85.81 in [[Swedish general election, 2014|2014]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.val.se/val/val2014/slutresultat/R/rike/index.html|title=Röster – Val 2014 | publisher = [[Election Authority (Sweden)|Election Authority]] |language=sv |access-date=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swedish politicians enjoyed a high degree of confidence from the citizens in the 1960s, However, that level of confidence has since declined steadily, and is now at a markedly lower level than in its Scandinavian neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Norris, Pippa |author=Holmberg, Sören |title=Critical Citizens: Global Support for Democratic Government|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1999|pages=103–123|isbn=0-19-829568-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{Main|Counties of Sweden|Municipalities of Sweden}}
[[File:SWE-Map Kommuner2007.svg|thumb|upright|Municipal divisions of Sweden]]
Sweden is a [[unitary state]] divided into 21 county councils (''landsting'') and 290 municipalities (''kommuner''). Every county council corresponds to a [[counties of Sweden|county]] (''län'') with a number of municipalities per county. County councils and municipalities have different roles and separate responsibilities relating to local government. Health care, public transport and certain cultural institutions are administered by county councils. Preschools, primary and secondary schooling, public water utilities, garbage disposal, elderly care and rescue services are administered by the municipalities. Gotland is a special case of being a county council with only one municipality and the functions of county council and municipality are performed by the same organisation.&lt;ref&gt;Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions, [http://skl.se/tjanster/englishpages/municipalitiescountycouncilsandregions.1088.html Municipalities, county councils and regions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122153331/http://skl.se/tjanster/englishpages/municipalitiescountycouncilsandregions.1088.html |date=22 November 2016 }}; official translation of the [http://www.regeringen.se/content/1/c4/06/96/34cb7541.pdf Local Government Act] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050220081642/http://www.regeringen.se/content/1/c4/06/96/34cb7541.pdf |date=20 February 2005 }} (''Kommunallagen'');[http://www.sll.se/om-landstinget/Information-in-English1/About-Stockholm-County-Council/ About Stockholm County Council] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821160842/http://www.sll.se/om-landstinget/Information-in-English1/About-Stockholm-County-Council/ |date=21 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Municipal and county council government in Sweden is similar to [[city commission government|city commission]] and [[cabinet-style council]] government. Both levels have legislative assemblies ([[municipal council (Sweden)|municipal councils]] and [[county council assembly|county council assemblies]]) of between 31 and 101 members (always an uneven number) that are elected from [[party-list proportional representation]] at the general election which are held every four years in conjunction with the national parliamentary elections.

Municipalities are also divided into a total of 2,512 [[Parishes of Sweden|parishes]] (''församlingar''). These have no official political responsibilities but are traditional subdivisions of the [[Church of Sweden]] and still have some importance as census districts for census-taking and elections.

The Swedish government has 21 [[County Administrative Boards of Sweden|County Administrative Boards]] ({{lang-sv|länsstyrelser}}), which are responsible for regional state administration not assigned to other government agencies or local government. Each county administrative boards is led by a [[County governors of Sweden|County Governor]] ({{lang-sv|landshövding}}) appointed for a term of six years. The list of previous officeholders for the counties stretches back, in most cases, to 1634 when the counties were created by [[Lord High Chancellor of Sweden|Lord High Chancellor]] Count [[Axel Oxenstierna]]. The main responsibility of the County Administrative Board is to co-ordinate the development of the county in line with goals set by the Riksdag and Government.

There are older historical divisions, primarily the twenty-five provinces and three lands, which still retain cultural significance.

| &amp;nbsp;
|How and when the Swedish kingdom appeared is not known. It is not until the 12th century that written document begin to be produced in Sweden in any larger extent […]
|}&lt;/ref&gt; Establishing the age depends mostly on whether Sweden should be considered a nation when the ''Svear'' (Sweonas) ruled Svealand or if the emergence of the nation started with the ''Svear'' and the ''[[Götar]]'' (Geats) of Götaland being united under one ruler. In the first case, Svealand was first mentioned as having one single ruler in the year 98 by Tacitus, but it is almost impossible to know for how long it had been this way. However, historians usually start the line of [[Swedish monarchs]] from when Svealand and Götaland were ruled under the same king, namely Eric the Victorious (Geat) and his son [[Olof Skötkonung]] in the 10th century. These events are often described as the [[consolidation of Sweden]], although substantial areas were conquered and incorporated later.

Earlier kings, for which no reliable historical sources exist, can be read about in [[mythical kings of Sweden]] and [[semi-legendary kings of Sweden]]. Many of these kings are only mentioned in various [[Norse sagas|saga]] and blend with Norse mythology.

The title ''Sveriges och Götes Konung'' was last used for [[Gustaf I of Sweden]], after which the title became "[[Kings of Sweden|King of Sweden]], [[King of the Goths|of the Goths]] and [[King of the Wends|of the Wends]]" (''Sveriges, Götes och Vendes Konung'') in official documentation. Up until the beginning of the 1920s, all laws in Sweden were introduced with the words, "We, the king of Sweden, of the Goths and Wends". This title was used up until 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lagen.nu/1973:702|title=Kungl. Maj:ts kungörelse med anledning av konung Gustaf VI Adolfs frånfälle|publisher=Lagen.nu |accessdate=17 September 2014 |language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The present King of Sweden, Carl XVI Gustaf, was the first monarch officially proclaimed "King of Sweden" (''Sveriges Konung'') with no additional peoples mentioned in his title.

The term ''riksdag'' was used for the first time in the 1540s, although the first meeting where representatives of different social groups were called to discuss and determine affairs affecting the country as a whole took place as early as 1435, in the town of [[Arboga]].&lt;ref name=Riksdagen&gt;{{cite web|title=The history of the Riksdag|url=http://www.riksdagen.se/en/How-the-Riksdag-works/Democracy/The-history-of-the-Riksdag/|publisher=[[Riksdag]] |accessdate=9 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Riksdag of the Estates|Riksdag assemblies]] of 1527 and 1544, under King [[Gustav Vasa]], representatives of all four [[estates of the realm]] (clergy, [[Swedish nobility|nobility]], [[Bourgeoisie|townsmen]] and [[peasant]]s) were called on to participate for the first time.&lt;ref name="Riksdagen" /&gt; The monarchy became hereditary in 1544.

Executive power was historically shared between the King and an aristocratic [[Privy council]] until 1680, followed by the King's [[autocracy|autocratic rule]] initiated by the commoner estates of the Riksdag. As a reaction to the failed Great Northern War, a parliamentary system was introduced in 1719, followed by three different flavours of constitutional monarchy in 1772, 1789 and 1809, [[Swedish constitution of 1809|the latter]] granting several civil liberties. Already during the first of those three periods, the 'Era of Liberty' (1719–72) the Swedish Rikstag had developed into a very active Parliament, and this tradition continued into the nineteenth century, laying the basis for the transition towards modern democracy at the end of that century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Baten, Jörg |title=A History of the Global Economy. From 1500 to the Present.|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=22|isbn=9781107507180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1866 Sweden became a constitutional monarchy with a [[bicameral]] parliament, with the First Chamber indirectly elected by local governments, and the Second Chamber directly elected in national elections every four years. In 1971 the parliament became unicameral. Legislative power was (symbolically) shared between the King and the Riksdag until 1975. Swedish taxation is controlled by the Riksdag.

Sweden has a history of strong political involvement by ordinary people through its "popular movements" (''Folkrörelser''), the most notable being trade unions, the independent Christian movement, the temperance movement, the [[women's movement]] and more recently the [[Pirate Party (Sweden)|intellectual property pirate]] movements. Sweden was the first country in the world to outlaw [[corporal punishment]] of children by their parents (parents' right to spank their own children was first removed in 1966, and it was explicitly prohibited by law from July 1979&lt;ref name="Durrant 1996"&gt;{{cite book |last=Durrant |first=Joan E. |editor1=Frehsee, Detlev |editor2=etal |title=Family Violence Against Children: A Challenge for Society |date=1996 |location=Berlin |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn=3-11-014996-6 |page=20 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Family_Violence_Against_Children.html?id=8IyJkWAAXjkC&amp;q=%22swedish+ban+on+corporal+punishment%22 |chapter=The Swedish Ban on Corporal Punishment: Its History and Effects}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Sweden is currently leading the EU in statistics measuring [[equality of opportunity|equality]] in the political system and equality in the education system.&lt;ref name=EUEqualityReport&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[European Commission]] |work=[[Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion]] |title=Report On The Equality Between Men And Women |url=http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/publications/2006/keaj06001_en.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |date=February 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817175053/http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/publications/2006/keaj06001_en.pdf |archivedate=17 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Global Gender Gap Report 2006'' ranked Sweden as the number one country in terms of [[gender equality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.norden.org/webb/news/news.asp?lang=6&amp;id=6605 |title=Nordic countries rank highest in gender equality |publisher=Norden.org |accessdate=6 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Swedish political figures have become known worldwide, among these are: Raoul Wallenberg, [[Folke Bernadotte]], the former [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]] of the United Nations [[Dag Hammarskjöld]], the former Prime Minister [[Olof Palme]], the former Prime Minister and later [[Foreign minister]] [[Carl Bildt]], the former President of the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly of the United Nations]] [[Jan Eliasson]], and the former [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] Iraq inspector [[Hans Blix]].

=== Judicial system ===
{{Main|Judiciary of Sweden}}
The courts are divided into two parallel and separate systems: The general courts ({{lang|sv|allmänna domstolar}}) for criminal and civil cases, and general administrative courts ({{lang|sv|allmänna förvaltningsdomstolar}}) for cases relating to disputes between private persons and the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dom.se/templates/DV_InfoPage____2317.aspx |publisher=[[Swedish National Courts Administration]] |title=The Swedish courts |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209002918/http://www.dom.se/templates/DV_InfoPage____2317.aspx |archivedate=9 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these systems has three tiers, where the top tier court of the respective system typically only will hear cases that may become [[precedent]]. There are also a number of special courts, which will hear a narrower set of cases, as set down by legislation. While independent in their rulings, some of these courts are operated as divisions within courts of the general or general administrative courts.

[[File:Hogsta domstolen Stockholm.jpg|thumb|[[Bonde Palace]] in Stockholm, seat of the [[Supreme Court of Sweden]]]]
The [[Supreme Court of Sweden]] ({{lang-sv|Högsta domstolen}}) is the third and final instance in all civil and criminal cases in Sweden. Before a case can be decided by the Supreme Court, leave to appeal must be obtained, and with few exceptions, leave to appeal can be granted only when the case is of interest as a precedent. The Supreme Court consists of 16 Justices ({{lang-sv|justitieråd}}), appointed by the Government, but the court as an institution is independent of the Riksdag, and the Government is not able to interfere with the decisions of the court.

According to a victimisation survey of 1,201 residents in 2005, Sweden has above-average [[crime rate]]s compared to other EU countries. Sweden has high or above-average levels of assaults, sexual assaults, hate crimes, and consumer fraud. Sweden has low levels of burglary, car theft and drug problems.

A mid-November 2013 news report announced that four prisons in Sweden were closed during the year due to a significant drop in the number of inmates. The decrease in the number of Swedish prisoners was considered "out-of-the-ordinary" by the head of Sweden's prison and probation services, with prison numbers in Sweden falling by around 1% a year since 2004. Prisons were closed in the towns of Åby, Håja, Båtshagen, and Kristianstad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sweden closes four prisons as number of inmates plummets|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/11/sweden-closes-prisons-number-inmates-plummets|accessdate=15 November 2013|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=11 November 2013 |last=Orange |first=Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Foreign relations ===
{{Main|Foreign relations of Sweden}}
[[File:European-parliament-brussels-inside.JPG|thumb|The EU parliament in Brussels. Sweden is one of 28 member states of the European Union.]]

Throughout the 20th century, [[Swedish foreign policy]] was based on the principle of non-alignment in peacetime and [[neutral country|neutrality]] in wartime. Sweden's government pursued an independent course of nonalignment in times of peace so that neutrality would be possible in the event of war.&lt;ref name="NB335-339" /&gt;

Sweden's doctrine of neutrality is often traced back to the 19th century as the country has not been in a [[war|state of war]] since the end of the [[Swedish campaign against Norway (1814)|Swedish campaign against Norway]] in 1814. During World War II Sweden joined neither the [[Allies of World War II|allied]] nor [[Axis powers|axis]] powers. This has sometimes been disputed since in effect Sweden allowed in select cases the Nazi regime to use its railroad system to transport troops and goods,&lt;ref name="Koblik303-313" /&gt;&lt;!---Koblik, p. 313---&gt;&lt;ref name="NB313-319" /&gt; especially iron ore from mines in northern Sweden, which was vital to the German war machine.&lt;ref name="NB313-319" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nordstrom p. 302: "In fact, the plans were mostly a ruse to establish control of the crucial Norwegian port of Narvik and the iron mines of northern Sweden, which were vitally important to the German war efforts."&lt;/ref&gt; However, Sweden also indirectly contributed to the defence of Finland in the Winter War, and permitted the training of Norwegian and Danish troops in Sweden after 1943.

During the early [[Cold War]] era, Sweden combined its policy of non-alignment and a low profile in international affairs with a [[security policy]] based on strong [[National security|national defence]].&lt;ref&gt;As context, according to [[Edwin Reischauer]], "To be neutral you must be ready to be highly militarized, like Switzerland or Sweden." – ''see'' {{cite news |last=Chapin |first=Emerson |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE2DC163AF931A3575AC0A966958260&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=edwin+o+reischauer&amp;st=nyt |title=Edwin Reischauer, Diplomat and Scholar, Dies at 79 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=2 September 1990 |access-date=16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The function of the Swedish military was to deter attack.&lt;ref&gt;Nordstrom, p 336: "As a corollary, a security policy based on strong national defences designed to discourage, but not prevent, attack was pursued. For the next several decades, the Swedish poured an annual average of about 5% of GDP into making their defenses credible."&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the country maintained relatively close informal connections with the Western bloc, especially in the realm of intelligence exchange. In 1952, a Swedish [[DC-3]] was [[Catalina affair|shot down]] over the Baltic Sea by a Soviet [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15]] [[jet aircraft|jet]] [[fighter aircraft|fighter]]. Later investigations revealed that the plane was actually gathering information for NATO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cold War Spy Plane Found in Baltic Sea|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/10/1010_031010_swedishspyplane.html|publisher=[[National Geographic News]]|accessdate=10 June 2013|date=10 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another plane, a [[PBY Catalina|Catalina]] [[search and rescue]] plane, was sent out a few days later and shot down by the Soviets as well. Prime Minister Olof Palme made an official visit to [[Cuba]] during the 1970s, during which he denounced [[Fulgencio Batista]]'s government and praised contemporary [[26 July Movement|Cuban]] and [[Khmer Rouge|Cambodian]] revolutionaries in a speech.

Beginning in the late 1960s, Sweden attempted to play a more significant and independent role in international relations. It involved itself significantly in international peace efforts, especially through the United Nations, and in support to the [[Third World]].

On 27 October 1981, a [[Whiskey-class submarine]] ([[Soviet submarine S-363|''U 137'']]) from the [[Soviet Union]] ran aground close to the [[Karlskrona naval base|naval base]] at [[Karlskrona]] in the southern part of the country. Research has never clearly established whether the submarine ended up on the shoals through a navigational mistake or if an enemy committed espionage against Swedish military potential. The incident triggered a diplomatic crisis between Sweden and the Soviet Union. Following the [[Assassination of Olof Palme|1986 assassination of Olof Palme]] and with the end of the Cold War, Sweden has adopted a more traditional foreign policy approach. Nevertheless, the country remains active in peace keeping missions and maintains a considerable foreign aid budget.

Since 1995 Sweden has been a member of the European Union, and as a consequence of a new world security situation the country's foreign policy doctrine has been partly modified, with Sweden playing a more active role in European security co-operation.

[[File:Swedish JAS-39 Gripen landing.jpg|thumb|The Saab [[JAS 39 Gripen]] is an advanced Swedish multi-role [[fighter aircraft]] of the [[Swedish Air Force]].]]
The [[Law enforcement in Sweden|law is enforced in Sweden]] by several government entities. The Swedish police is a [[Government agencies in Sweden|Government agency]] concerned with police matters. The [[National Task Force]] is a national [[SWAT]] unit within the Police Service. The [[Swedish Security Service]]'s responsibilities are [[counter-espionage]], anti-terrorist activities, protection of the constitution and protection of sensitive objects and people.

''Försvarsmakten'' (Swedish Armed Forces) is a government agency reporting to the Swedish [[Ministry of Defence (Sweden)|Ministry of Defence]] and responsible for the [[peacetime]] operation of the armed forces of Sweden. The primary task of the agency is to train and deploy peace support forces abroad, while maintaining the long-term ability to refocus on the defence of Sweden in the event of war. The armed forces are divided into [[Swedish Army|Army]], [[Swedish Air Force|Air Force]] and [[Swedish Navy|Navy]]. The head of the armed forces is the [[Supreme Commander of the Swedish Armed Forces|Supreme Commander]] (''Överbefälhavaren'', ÖB), the most senior commissioned officer in the country. Up to 1974 the King was ''pro forma'' [[Commander in chief#Sweden|Commander-in-Chief]], but in reality it was clearly understood all through the 20th century that the Monarch would have no ''active'' role as a military leader.

[[File:Stridsfordon 90 Revinge 2012-2.jpg|thumb|The Infantry fighting vehicle [[Combat Vehicle 90|CV90]], which is produced and used by Sweden]]
Until the end of the Cold War, nearly all males reaching the age of [[military service]] were [[conscription|conscripted]]. In recent years, the number of conscripted males has shrunk dramatically, while the number of female volunteers has increased slightly. Recruitment has generally shifted towards finding the most motivated recruits, rather than solely those otherwise most fit for service. All soldiers serving abroad must by law be volunteers. In 1975 the total number of conscripts was 45,000. By 2003 it was down to 15,000.

On 1 July 2010 Sweden stopped routine conscription, switching to an all volunteer force unless otherwise required for defence readiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forsvarsmakten.se/sv/Rekrytering/Varnplikt/ |publisher=[[Swedish Armed Forces]] |title=Värnplikt |trans-title=Conscription |accessdate=21 April 2010 |language=sv }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://svt.se/2.22620/1.1595556/allmanna_varnplikten_skrotas?lid=puff_1597044&amp;lpos=extra_0 |publisher=[[Sveriges Television]] |title=Allmänna värnplikten skrotas |trans-title=General conscription scrapped |accessdate=21 April 2010 |language=sv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426203557/http://svt.se/2.22620/1.1595556/allmanna_varnplikten_skrotas?lid=puff_1597044&amp;lpos=extra_0 |archivedate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thelocal.se/21494/20090816/ |newspaper=[[The Local]] |title=Military conscription phase out under fire |accessdate=21 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122021708/http://www.thelocal.se/21494/20090816/ |archivedate=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The need to recruit only the soldiers later prepared to volunteer for international service will be emphasised. The total forces gathered would consist of about 60,000 men. This could be compared with the 1980s before the fall of the Soviet Union, when Sweden could gather up to 1,000,000 men.

[[File:Sweden GRP per Capita (2014).png|thumb|upright|[[Gross Regional Product]] (GRP) per capita in thousands of kronor (2014)]]
Sweden is the seventh-richest country in the world in terms of GDP (gross domestic product) per capita and a high standard of living is experienced by its citizens. Sweden is an export-oriented [[mixed economy]]. Timber, [[hydropower]] and iron ore constitute the resource base of an economy with a heavy emphasis on [[foreign trade]]. Sweden's engineering sector accounts for 50% of output and exports, while telecommunications, the automotive industry and the pharmaceutical industries are also of great importance. Sweden is the ninth-largest [[arms industry|arms exporter in the world]]. Agriculture accounts for 2% of GDP and employment. The country ranks among the highest for telephone and Internet access penetration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sw.html |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] |work=[[The World Factbook]] |title=EUROPE :: SWEDEN |access-date=16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sweden maintains its own currency, the [[Swedish krona]] (SEK), a result of the Swedes having rejected the [[euro]] in a referendum. The Swedish [[Sveriges Riksbank|Riksbank]]—founded in 1668 and thus the oldest central bank in the world—is currently focusing on price stability with an inflation target of 2%. According to the ''Economic Survey of Sweden 2007'' by the OECD, the average inflation in Sweden has been one of the lowest among European countries since the mid-1990s, largely because of deregulation and quick utilisation of globalisation.&lt;ref name="oecd2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/document/37/0,3343,en_2649_34569_38048997_1_1_1_1,00.html |title=Economic survey of Sweden 2007 |publisher=Oecd.org |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=25 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426123744/http://www.oecd.org/document/37/0%2C3343%2Cen_2649_34569_38048997_1_1_1_1%2C00.html |archivedate=26 April 2011 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Financial deregulation in the 1980s impacted adversely on the property market, leading to a bubble and eventually a crash in the early 1990s. Commercial property prices fell by up to two thirds, resulting in two Swedish banks having to be taken over by the government. In the following two decades the property sector strengthened. By 2014, legislators, economists and the IMF were again warning of a bubble with residential property prices soaring and the level of personal mortgage debt expanding. Household debt-to-income rose above 170% as the IMF was calling on legislators to consider zoning reform and other means of generating a greater supply of housing as demand was outstripping what was available, pushing prices higher. By August 2014, 40% of home borrowers had interest-only loans while those that didn't were repaying principal at a rate that would take 100 years to fully repay.&lt;ref name="SwedenProperty"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sweden facing possible property bubble warns IMF|url=http://www.swedennews.net/index.php/sid/225058369|date=24 August 2014|accessdate=26 August 2014|publisher=''Sweden News.Net''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sweden's energy market is largely privatised. The [[Nordic energy market]] is one of the first liberalised energy markets in Europe and it is traded in [[NASDAQ OMX Commodities Europe]] and [[Nord Pool Spot]]. In 2006, out of a total electricity production of 139 [[TWh]], electricity from hydropower accounted for 61 TWh (44%), and [[nuclear power]] delivered 65 TWh (47%). At the same time, the use of [[biofuel]]s, [[peat]] etc. produced 13 TWh (9%) of electricity, while wind power produced 1 TWh (1%). Sweden was a net importer of electricity by a margin of 6 TWh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svenskenergi.se/upload/Statistik/Tidigare%20statistik/Kraftl%C3%A4get%20i%20%C3%A5r/ve_07-01.pdf |title=Kraftläget i Sverige, Vattensituationen |accessdate=19 April 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080216021232/http://www.svenskenergi.se/upload/Statistik/Tidigare%20statistik/Kraftl%C3%A4get%20i%20%C3%A5r/ve_07-01.pdf |archivedate=16 February 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Biomass]] is mainly used to produce heat for [[district heating]] and [[central heating]] and industry processes.

The [[1973 oil crisis]] strengthened Sweden's commitment to decrease dependence on imported fossil fuels. Since then, electricity has been generated mostly from hydropower and nuclear power. The use of nuclear power has been limited, however. Among other things, the accident of [[Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station]] (United States) prompted the Riksdag to ban new nuclear plants. In March 2005, an opinion poll showed that 83% supported maintaining or increasing nuclear power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://world-nuclear.org/info/inf42.html |title=Nuclear Power in Sweden |publisher=[[World Nuclear Association]] |date=September 2009 |accessdate=29 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Politicians have made announcements about oil phase-out in Sweden, decrease of nuclear power, and multibillion-dollar investments in [[renewable energy]] and energy efficiency.&lt;ref name="Agenda21" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vidal"&gt;{{cite news|last=Vidal |first=John |url=https://www.theguardian.com/oil/story/0,,1704954,00.html |title=Sweden plans to be world's first oil-free economy |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=8 February 2006 |accessdate=13 March 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country has for many years pursued a strategy of indirect taxation as an instrument of [[environmental policy]], including [[energy tax]]es in general and [[carbon dioxide]] taxes in particular.&lt;ref name="Agenda21"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[United Nations]] |url=https://www.un.org/esa/agenda21/natlinfo/countr/sweden/natur.htm |work=[[Agenda 21]] |title=NATURAL RESOURCE ASPECTS OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN SWEDEN |date=April 1997 |access-date=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden was in 2014 a net exporter of electricity by a margin of 16 TWh; the production from windpower mills had increased to 11.5 TWh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.svenskenergi.se/Global/Statistik/Aktuellt%20kraftl%C3%A4ge/Aktuellt-Kraftl%C3%A4ge-Sverige-veckorapport.pdf |publisher=Svenskenergi.se |title=Kraftläget i Sverige |trans-title=Power situation in Sweden |format=PDF |language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
{{Main|Transport in Sweden}}
[[File:Öresundsbron i solnedgång 2.jpg|thumb|The [[Öresund Bridge]] between [[Malmö]] and [[Copenhagen]] in Denmark]]

Sweden has {{convert|162707|km|mi|abbr=on}} of paved road and {{convert|1428|km|mi|abbr=on}} of expressways. [[List of motorways in Sweden|Motorways]] run through Sweden and over the Øresund Bridge to Denmark. New motorways are still under construction and a new motorway from Uppsala to [[Gävle]] was finished on 17 October 2007. Sweden had left-hand traffic (Vänstertrafik in Swedish) from approximately 1736 and continued to do so well into the 20th century. Voters rejected right-hand traffic in 1955, but after the Riksdag passed legislation in 1963 changeover took place on 3 September 1967, known in Swedish as [[Dagen H]].

The [[Stockholm metro]] is the only underground system in Sweden and serves the city of Stockholm via 100 stations. The rail transport market is privatised, but while there are many privately owned enterprises, the largest operators are still owned by state. The counties have financing, ticket and marketing responsibility for local trains. For other trains the operators handle tickets and marketing themselves. Operators include [[SJ AB|SJ]], [[Veolia Transport]], [[DSB (railway company)|DSB]], [[Green Cargo]], [[Tågkompaniet]] and [[Inlandsbanan]]. Most of the railways are owned and operated by [[Trafikverket]]. Most tram nets were closed in 1967, as Sweden changed from left-side to right-side driving, but they survived in [[Norrköping]], Gothenburg and Stockholm. A new tram line is set to open in [[Lund]] in 2019.

[[File:Hall, Stockholm Central Station.jpg|thumb|left|[[Stockholm Central Station]]]]

The largest airports include [[Stockholm–Arlanda Airport]] (16.1 million passengers in 2009) {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of Stockholm, [[Göteborg Landvetter Airport]] (4.3 million passengers in 2008), and [[Stockholm–Skavsta Airport]] (2.0 million passengers). Sweden hosts the two largest port companies in Scandinavia, [[Port of Gothenburg|Port of Göteborg AB]] (Gothenburg) and the transnational company [[Copenhagen Malmö Port|Copenhagen Malmö Port AB]]. The most used airport for a large part of Southern Sweden is [[Copenhagen Airport|Kastrup or Copenhagen Airport]] which is located only 12 minutes by train from the closest Swedish railway station, [[Hyllie railway station|Hyllie]]. Copenhagen Airport also is the largest ''international'' airport in Scandinavia and Finland.

Sweden also has a number of car ferry connections to several neighbouring countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ferrylines.com/en/ferries/baltic-sea/|title=Ferry to Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Poland, Baltic, Russia, Germany.|last=Kowalski|first=Oliver|website=www.ferrylines.com|access-date=28 August 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816025904/http://www.ferrylines.com/en/ferries/baltic-sea|archivedate=16 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes a route from [[Umeå]] across [[Kvarken|the Gulf of Bothnia]] to [[Vaasa]] in Finland. There are several connections from the Stockholm area across the [[Sea of Åland]] to [[Mariehamn]] in the [[Åland Islands]] as well as [[Turku]] and [[Helsinki]] on the Finnish mainland and beyond to Estonia and [[Saint Petersburg|St Petersburg]] in Russia. Ferry routes from the Stockholm area also connect with [[Ventspils]] and [[Riga]] in Latvia as well as [[Gdańsk]] in Poland across the Baltic Sea. The ferry ports of [[Karlskrona]] and [[Karlshamn]] in southeastern Sweden serve [[Gdynia]], Poland, and [[Klaipėda|Klaipeda]], Lithuania. Ystad and Trelleborg near the southern tip of Sweden have ferry links with the Danish island of [[Bornholm]] and the German ports of [[Sassnitz]], [[Rostock]] and [[Travemünde]], respectively, and ferries run to [[Świnoujście]], Poland, from both of them.

Despite the opening of the fixed link to Denmark, the [[Øresund Bridge]], the busiest ferry route remains the short link across the narrowest section of the [[Øresund]] between [[Helsingborg]] and the Danish port of [[Helsingør]], known as the [[HH Ferry route]].

Finally, there are ferries from [[Strömstad]] near the Norwegian border to destinations around the [[Oslofjord]] in Norway. There used to be ferry services to the [[United Kingdom]] from Göteborg to destinations such as Immingham, Harwich and Newcastle, but these have been discontinued.

Sweden has two domestic ferry lines with large vessels, both connecting Gotland with the mainland. The lines leave from Visby harbour on the island, and the ferries sail to either [[Oskarshamn]] or Nynäshamn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destinationgotland.se/Farja/|title=Boka båtbiljetter till och från Gotland|work=destinationgotland.se |language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt; A smaller car ferry connects the island of [[Ven (Sweden)|Ven]] in Øresund with [[Landskrona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ventrafiken.se/index.php/en/|title=Ventrafiken -Upplev sundets pärla|work=ventrafiken.se |language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public policy ===
{{See also|Nordic model|Social welfare in Sweden}}
Sweden has one of the most highly developed welfare states in the world. According to a 2012 OECD report, the country had the second-highest public social spending as a percentage of its GDP after France (27.3% and 28.4%, respectively), and the third-highest total (public and private) social spending at 30.2% of its GDP, after France and [[Belgium]] (31.3% and 31.0%, respectively).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OECD Factbook 2011–2012 (see Public Finance -&gt; Social Expenditure) |year=2012 |publisher=OECD Publishing |url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/oecd-factbook_18147364}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden spent 6.3% of its GDP, the 9th-highest among 34 OECD countries, to provide equal access to education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OECD Factbook 2011–2012 (see Education -&gt; Education Expenditure) |year=2012 |publisher=OECD Publishing |url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/oecd-factbook_18147364}}&lt;/ref&gt; On health care, the country spent 10.0% of its total GDP, the 12th highest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=OECD Factbook 2011–2012 (see Health -&gt; Health Expenditure) |year=2012 |publisher=OECD Publishing |url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/oecd-factbook_18147364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, Sweden provided solid support for [[free trade]] (except agriculture) and mostly relatively strong and stable property rights (both private and public), though some economists have pointed out that Sweden promoted industries with tariffs and used publicly subsidised R&amp;D during the country's early critical years of industrialisation.&lt;ref name="H-J.C-Sweden"&gt;{{cite book |title=Kicking Away The Ladder |pages=39–42 |first=Ha-Joon |last=Chang}}&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II a succession of governments expanded the welfare state by raising the taxes. During this period Sweden's economic growth was also one of the highest in the industrial world. A series of successive social reforms transformed the country into one of the most equal and developed on earth. The consistent growth of the welfare state led to Swedes achieving unprecedented levels of social mobility and quality of life—to this day Sweden consistently ranks at the top of league tables for health, literacy and Human Development—far ahead of some wealthier countries (for example the United States).&lt;ref name="Equal Societies"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/nhhrc/publishing.nsf/Content/135-interim/$FILE/135%20-%20Submission%20-%20Childrens%20Hospitals%20Australasia%20(Attachment%20C).pdf |publisher=[[Department of Health (Australia)|Department of Health]] |title=The Spirit Level: Why More Equal Societies Almost Always Do Better |first1=Richard |last1=Wilkinson |first2=Kate |last2=Pickett |format=PDF |date=8 March 2009 |access-date=16 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205120331/http://www.health.gov.au/internet/nhhrc/publishing.nsf/Content/135-interim/$FILE/135%20-%20Submission%20-%20Childrens%20Hospitals%20Australasia%20(Attachment%20C).pdf |archivedate=5 February 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, from the 1970s and onwards Sweden's GDP growth fell behind other industrialised countries and the country's per capita ranking fell from 4th to 14th place in a few decades.&lt;ref name="eu-usa"&gt;[http://www.timbro.se/bokhandel/pdf/9175665646.pdf EU versus USA] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161115141716/http://www.timbro.se/bokhandel/pdf/9175665646.pdf |date=15 November 2016 }}, Fredrik Bergström &amp; Robert Gidehag&lt;/ref&gt; From the mid-1990s until today Sweden's economic growth has once again accelerated and has been higher than in most other industrialised countries (including the US) during the last 15 years.&lt;ref name="growth-Swe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekonomifakta.se/en/Facts-and-figures/Economy/Economic-growth/GDP-per-capita-/|title=Sweden's GDP per capita|date=16 September 2014|publisher=Ekonomifakta.se|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report from the [[United Nations Development Program]] predicted that Sweden's rating on the [[Human Development Index]] will fall from 0.949 in 2010 to 0.906 in 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Asher|first1=Jana|last2=Osborne Daponte|first2=Beth|title=A Hypothetical Cohort Model of Human Development|journal=Human Development Research Paper|page=41|url=http://ww.rrojasdatabank.info/HDRP_2010_40.pdf|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sweden began slowing the expansion of the welfare state in the 1980s, and even trimming it back. Sweden has recently been relatively quick to adopt [[neoliberal]] policies, such as [[privatization]], [[financialization]] and [[deregulation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Pierre |editor-first=Jon |date= 2016|title=The Oxford Handbook of Swedish Politics (Oxford Handbooks)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hDcICwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA573#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|location= |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|page= 573|isbn=978-0199665679|author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last= Springer|editor1-first=Simon |editor2-last= Birch|editor2-first=Kean |editor3-last= MacLeavy|editor3-first=Julie|date=2016 |title=The Handbook of Neoliberalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M5qkDAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA569#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|location= |publisher=[[Routledge]] |page=569 |isbn=978-1138844001}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared to countries such as France.&lt;ref name="oecd2007" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/mgi/mginews/businessweek/swedenbalance.asp|title=Sweden's balancing lessons for Europe|publisher=|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current Swedish government is continuing the trend of moderate rollbacks of previous social reforms.&lt;ref name="oecd2007" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?story_id=9803876|title=Moderate revolution|work=[[The Economist]]|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growth has been higher than in many other [[EU-15]] countries. Also since the mid-1980s, Sweden has had the fastest growth in inequality of any developed nation, according to the OECD. This has largely been attributed to the reduction in state benefits and a shift toward the privatisation of public services. According to Barbro Sorman, an activist of the opposition Left Party, "The rich are getting richer, and the poor are getting poorer. Sweden is starting to look like the USA." Nevertheless, it remains far more egalitarian than most nations.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/23/swedish-riots-stockholm|title=Swedish riots rage for fourth night|work=[[The Guardian]] |date=23 May 2013 |accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partly as a result of these privatisations and widening economic disparity, the Swedes in the 2014 elections put the Social Democrats back in power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time.com/3373946/sweden-parliament-election/ |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |title=Sweden Shifts to Left in Parliamentary Election |author=[[The Associated Press]] |date=14 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140920215539/http://time.com/3373946/sweden-parliament-election/ |archivedate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Igor |last=Bobic |date=13 September 2014 |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/13/sweden-austerity-election_n_5816010.html |title=Sweden's Turn Left Could Deal A Blow To European Austerity |newspaper=[[The Huffington Post]] |access-date=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sweden adopted free market agricultural policies in 1990. Since the 1930s, the agricultural sector had been subject to price controls. In June 1990, the Riksdag voted for a new agricultural policy marking a significant shift away from price controls. As a result, food prices fell somewhat. However, the liberalisations soon became moot because EU agricultural controls supervened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Econ Journal Watch]] |last=Lindberg |first=Henrik |title=The Role of Economists in Liberalising Swedish Agriculture |date=May 2007 |url=http://econjwatch.org/issues/volume-4-number-1-may-2007 |volume=4 |issue=2 |access-date=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the late 1960s, Sweden has had the highest tax quota (as percentage of GDP) in the industrialised world, although today the gap has narrowed and Denmark has surpassed Sweden as the most heavily taxed country among developed countries. Sweden has a two-step [[progressive tax]] scale with a municipal income tax of about 30% and an additional high-income state tax of 20–25% when a salary exceeds roughly 320,000 SEK per year. [[Payroll tax]]es amount to 32%. In addition, a national [[Value added tax|VAT]] of 25% is added to many things bought by private citizens, with the exception of food (12% VAT), transportation, and books (6% VAT). Certain items are subject to additional taxes, e.g. electricity, petrol/diesel and alcoholic beverages.

{{As of|2007|alt=In 2007}}, total tax revenue was 47.8% of GDP, the second-highest tax burden among developed countries, down from 49.1% 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Kenneth |last=Westerlund |title=Danmark har högsta skattetrycket |trans-title=Denmark has the highest tax burden |url=http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=3130&amp;a=750879 |newspaper=[[Dagens Nyheter]] |date=11 March 2008 |accessdate=11 March 2008 |language=Swedish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214084943/http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=3130&amp;a=750879 |archivedate=14 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden's inverted tax wedge – the amount going to the service worker's wallet – is approximately 15%, compared to 10% in Belgium, 30% in Ireland, and 50% in United States.&lt;ref name="eu-usa" /&gt; Public sector spending amounts to 53% of the GDP. State and municipal employees total around a third of the workforce, much more than in most Western countries. Only Denmark has a larger public sector (38% of Danish workforce). Spending on transfers is also high.

In 2015 and 2016, 69 per cent of the employed workers is organised in trade unions. Union density in 2016 was 62% among blue-collar-workers (most of them in the [[Swedish Trade Union Confederation]], LO) and 75% among white-collar workers (most of them in the Swedish Confederation of Professional Employees, TCO, and the [[Swedish Confederation of Professional Associations]], SACO).&lt;ref&gt;Yearly averages excluding full-time students working part-time.

=== Science and technology ===
{{Main|Swedish inventions}}
[[File:AlfredNobel adjusted.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Alfred Nobel]], inventor of dynamite and institutor of the Nobel Prize]]

In the 18th century Sweden's [[scientific revolution]] took off. Previously, technical progress had mainly come from mainland Europe.

In 1739, the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] was founded, with people such as [[Carl Linnaeus]] and [[Anders Celsius]] as early members. Many of the companies founded by early pioneers still remain major international brands. [[Gustaf Dalén]] founded [[AGA AB|AGA]], and received the Nobel Prize for his [[sun valve]]. [[Alfred Nobel]] invented [[dynamite]] and instituted the Nobel Prizes. [[Lars Magnus Ericsson]] started the company bearing his name, Ericsson, still one of the largest telecom companies in the world. [[Jonas Wenström]] was an early pioneer in [[alternating current]] and is along with [[Serbia]]n inventor [[Nikola Tesla]] credited as one of the inventors of the three-phase electrical system.&lt;ref name="si91e" /&gt;

The traditional engineering industry is still a major source of Swedish inventions, but pharmaceuticals, electronics and other high-tech industries are gaining ground. [[Tetra Pak]] was an invention for storing liquid foods, invented by [[Erik Wallenberg]]. [[Losec]], an ulcer medicine, was the world's best-selling drug in the 1990s and was developed by [[AstraZeneca]]. More recently [[Håkan Lans]] invented the [[Automatic Identification System]], a worldwide standard for shipping and civil aviation navigation. A large portion of the Swedish economy is to this day based on the export of technical inventions, and many large multinational corporations from Sweden have their origins in the ingenuity of Swedish inventors.&lt;ref name="si91e"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.sweden.se/eng/Home/Education/Research/Facts/Innovation/|title=Innovation, Science/Research: Inventing tomorrow's world |publisher=Sweden.se |accessdate=27 January 2011|date=February 2010|work=Fact Sheet FS 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedish inventors held 47,112 patents in the United States {{as of|2014|alt=in 2014}}, according to the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]]. As a nation, only ten other countries hold more patents than Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/ido/oeip/taf/cst_all.htm |publisher=[[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] |title=Patents By Country, State, and Year – All Patent Types (December 2014) |access-date=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Combined, the public and the private sector in Sweden allocate over 3.5% of GDP to [[research &amp; development]] (R&amp;D) per year, making Sweden's investment in R&amp;D as a percentage of GDP the second-highest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/eco_res_and_dev_exp_of_gdp-economy-research-development-expenditure-gdp |title=% Of GDP &gt; Research And Development Expenditure statistics – countries compared |publisher=NationMaster|accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For several decades the [[Swedish government]] has prioritised scientific and R&amp;D activities.

In 2009, the decisions to construct Sweden's two largest scientific installations, the synchrotron radiation facility [[MAX IV]] and the European Spallation Source, were taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European Spallation Source|url=http://europeanspallationsource.se/|publisher=ESS AB|accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MAX IV |url=https://www.maxlab.lu.se/maxiv |publisher=[[MAX-lab]] |accessdate=16 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603131912/https://www.maxlab.lu.se/maxiv |archivedate=3 June 2013 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both installations will be built in [[Lund]].

Both facilities have strong implications on material research.

=== Taxes ===
{{Main|Taxation in Sweden}}
On average, 27% of taxpayer's money in Sweden goes to education and healthcare, whereas 5% goes to the police and military, and 42% to social security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=22 August 2017|title=Offentliga sektorns utgifter|url=https://www.ekonomifakta.se/Fakta/Offentlig-ekonomi/Offentlig-sektor/Offentliga-sektorns-utgifter/?graph=/10870/all/all/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The typical worker receives 40% of his or her labour costs after the [[tax wedge]]. Total tax collected by Sweden as a percentage of its GDP peaked at 52.3% in 1990.&lt;ref name=oecdtax11 /&gt; The country faced a real estate and banking crisis in 1990–1991, and consequently passed tax reforms in 1991 to implement tax rate cuts and tax base broadening over time.&lt;ref name="AgellEnglund"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RiksbankHeikensten"/&gt; Since 1990, taxes as a percentage of GDP collected by Sweden have been dropping, with total tax rates for the highest income earners dropping the most.&lt;ref name="BengtssonHolmlund"/&gt; In 2010 45.8% of the country's GDP was collected as taxes, the second highest among OECD countries, and nearly double the percentage in the US or South Korea.&lt;ref name=oecdtax11/&gt;

=== Pensions ===
{{Main|Social security in Sweden}}
Every Swedish resident receives a state pension. Swedish Pensions Agency is responsible for pensions. People who have worked in Sweden, but relocated to another country, can also receive the Swedish pension. There are several types of pensions in Sweden: national retirement, occupational and private pensions. A person can receive a combination of the various types of pensions.

About 85% of the population live in urban areas.&lt;ref name="publikationer2007"&gt;''Yearbook of Housing and Building Statistics 2007''&lt;/ref&gt; The capital city Stockholm has a municipal population of about 950,000 (with 1.5 million in the urban area and 2.3 million in the metropolitan area). The second- and third-largest cities are Gothenburg and Malmö. Greater Gothenburg counts just over a million inhabitants and the same goes for the western part of Scania, along the [[Öresund]]. [[Greater Copenhagen|Greater Copenhagen and Skåne]], the Danish-Swedish cross-border region around the Öresund that Malmö is part of (an area formerly known as the ''Öresund Region''), has a population of 4 million. Outside of major cities, areas with notably higher population density include the agricultural part of Östergötland, the western coast, the area around Lake Mälaren and the agricultural area around Uppsala.

Norrland, which covers approximately 60% of the Swedish territory, has a very low population density (below 5 people per square kilometre). The mountains and most of the remote coastal areas are almost unpopulated. Low population density exists also in large parts of western Svealand, as well as southern and central Småland.

Between 1820 and 1930, approximately 1.3 million Swedes, a third of the country's population, [[Swedish emigration to North America|emigrated to North America]], and most of them to the United States.

The official language of Sweden is Swedish,&lt;ref name="Swedish"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riksdagen.se/sv/Dokument-Lagar/Lagar/Svenskforfattningssamling/Spraklag-2009600_sfs-2009-600/|title=Språklag (2009:600)|date=28 May 2009|publisher=[[Riksdag]]|language=Swedish|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Swedish2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thelocal.se/20090701/20404|title=Swedish becomes official 'main language'|last=Landes|first=David|date=1 July 2009|newspaper=[[The Local]] |accessdate=15 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; a North Germanic language, related and very similar to [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], but differing in pronunciation and [[orthography]]. Norwegians have little difficulty understanding Swedish, and Danes can also understand it, with slightly more difficulty than Norwegians. The same goes for standard Swedish speakers, who find it far easier to understand Norwegian than Danish. The [[Scanian dialects|dialects spoken in Scania]], the southernmost part of the country, are influenced by Danish because [[Skåneland|the region traditionally was a part of Denmark]] and is nowadays situated closely to it. [[Sweden Finns]] are Sweden's largest linguistic minority, comprising about 5% of Sweden's population,&lt;ref name="Finns"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scb.se/Pages/PressRelease____255905.aspx |title=På lördag kan 440 000 flagga blått och vitt |trans-title=On Saturday 440 000 can flag blue and white |publisher=[[Statistics Sweden]] |language=Swedish |date=5 December 2008 |accessdate=16 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820073639/http://www.scb.se/Pages/PressRelease____255905.aspx |archivedate=20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Finnish is recognised as a minority language.&lt;ref name="Swedish2" /&gt; Owing to a recent influx of native speakers of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in latter years, the use of Arabic is likely more widespread in the country than that of Finnish. However, no official statistics are kept on language use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=3993&amp;artikel=6003931|title=Hur många språk talas i Sverige? |trans-title=How many languages are spoken in Sweden? |publisher=[[Sveriges Radio]]|language=sv|date=29 October 2014|accessdate=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with Finnish, [[Minority languages of Sweden|four other minority languages]] are also recognised: [[Meänkieli]], [[Sami languages|Sami]], [[Romani language|Romani]], and [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]. Swedish became Sweden's official language on 1 July 2009, when a new language law was implemented.&lt;ref name="Swedish2" /&gt; The issue of whether Swedish should be declared the official language had been raised in the past, and the Riksdag voted on the matter in 2005, but the proposal narrowly failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Svenskan blir inte officiellt språk |trans-title=Swedish will not become an official language |url=http://www.svt.se/nyheter/sverige/svenskan-blir-inte-officiellt-sprak|publisher=[[Sveriges Television]]|language=Swedish|accessdate=9 June 2013|date=7 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In varying degrees, depending largely on frequency of interaction with English, a majority of Swedes, especially those born after World War II, understand and speak English, owing to trade links, the popularity of overseas travel, a strong Anglo-American influence and the tradition of [[subtitle (captioning)|subtitling]] rather than dubbing foreign television shows and films, and the [[Germanic languages|relative similarity]] of the two languages which makes learning English easier. In a 2005 survey by [[Eurobarometer]], 89% of Swedes reported the ability to speak English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/languages/pdf/doc631_en.pdf |title=Oooops...

English became a compulsory subject for secondary school students studying [[natural science]]s as early as 1849, and has been a compulsory subject for all Swedish students since the late 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.lu.se/info/lum/LUM_07_99/01_engelska.html |title=English spoken – fast ibland hellre än bra |publisher=[[Lund University]] newsletter 7/1999 |language=Swedish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060106110733/http://www3.lu.se/info/lum/LUM_07_99/01_engelska.html |archivedate=6 January 2006 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the local school authorities, English is currently a compulsory subject between [[first grade]] and [[ninth grade]], with all students continuing in secondary school studying English for at least another year. Most students also study one and sometimes two additional languages. These include (but are not limited to) German, French and Spanish. Some Danish and Norwegian is at times also taught as part of Swedish courses for native speakers. Because of the extensive [[mutual intelligibility]] between the three continental [[Scandinavian language]]s Swedish speakers often use their native language when visiting or living in Norway or Denmark.

Before the 11th century, Swedes adhered to [[Norse paganism]], worshiping [[Æsir]] gods, with its centre at the [[temple at Uppsala|Temple in Uppsala]]. With [[Christianization of Scandinavia|Christianisation]] in the 11th century, the laws of the country changed, forbidding worship of other deities into the late 19th century. After the [[Protestant Reformation]] in the 1530s, a change led by [[Martin Luther]]'s Swedish associate [[Olaus Petri]], the authority of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] was abolished and [[Lutheranism]] became widespread. Adoption of Lutheranism was completed by the [[Uppsala Synod]] of 1593, and it became the official religion. During the era following the Reformation, usually known as the period of [[Lutheran orthodoxy]], small groups of non-Lutherans, especially [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] [[Dutch people|Dutchmen]], the [[Moravian Church]] and [[French Huguenots]] played a significant role in trade and industry, and were quietly tolerated as long as they kept a low religious profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gritsch|first1=Eric|title=A History of Lutheranism|date=2010|publisher=Fortress Press|location=Minneapolis|isbn=9781451407754|pages=351|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ApWxByVqe-MC&amp;dq=lutheranism+history+in+sweden&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sami people|Sami]] originally had their own [[Animism|shamanistic religion]], but they were converted to Lutheranism by Swedish missionaries in the 17th and 18th centuries.

With religious liberalisations in the late 18th century believers of other faiths, including [[Judaism]] and [[Roman Catholicism]], were allowed to live and work freely in the country. However, until 1860 it remained illegal for Lutherans to convert to another religion. The 19th century saw the arrival of various [[Low church|evangelical]] [[free church]]es, and, towards the end of the century, [[secularism]], leading many to distance themselves from church rituals. Leaving the Church of Sweden became legal with the so-called dissenter law of 1860, but only under the provision of entering another [[Christian denomination]]. The right to stand outside any religious denomination was formally established in the Law on [[Freedom of religion]] in 1951.

In 2000, the [[Church of Sweden]] was disestablished. Sweden was the second [[Nordic country]] to [[Separation of church and state|disestablish]] its [[state church]] (after [[Finland]] did so in the Church Act of 1869).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iclrs.org/content/blurb/files/Sweden.1.pdf MAARIT JÄNTERÄ-JAREBORG: Religion and the Secular State in Sweden] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160110072754/http://www.iclrs.org/content/blurb/files/Sweden.1.pdf |date=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 2016, 61.2% of Swedes belonged to the [[Church of Sweden]]; this number has been decreasing by about 1.5 percentage points a year for the last 5 years and one percentage point a year on average for the last two decades.&lt;ref name="svenskakyrkan.se"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.svenskakyrkan.se/default.aspx?di=978164 |publisher=[[Church of Sweden]] |title=Stift |trans-title=Diocese |format=PDF |language=Swedish }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=BabbaQ |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thelocal1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thelocal.se/26878/20100527/ |title=Swedes depart church in droves |newspaper=[[The Local]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100802045112/http://www.thelocal.se/26878/20100527/ |archivedate=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Church of Sweden]] |url=http://www.svenskakyrkan.se/statistik/xls/medlem_diagram.xls |title=Medlemmar 1972–2006 |trans-title=Members 1972–2006 |format=xls |language=Swedish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930212556/http://www.svenskakyrkan.se/statistik/xls/medlem_diagram.xls |archivedate=30 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 2% of the church's members regularly attend Sunday services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Church of Sweden]] |url=http://www.svenskakyrkan.se/SVK/eng/liturgy.htm |title=Liturgy and Worship |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100422193814/http://www.svenskakyrkan.se/SVK/eng/liturgy.htm |archivedate=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for the large number of inactive members is partly that, until 1996, children automatically became members at birth if at least one of the parents was a member. Since 1996, only children that are christened become members. Some 275,000 Swedes are today members of various [[Evangelical Protestant]] free churches (where congregation attendance is much higher), and due to recent immigration, there are now some 100,000 [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christians]] and 92,000 Roman Catholics living in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;[[:sv:Frikyrka|Statistics about free churches and immigration churches from Swedish Wikipedia – in Swedish]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Muslim congregation was established in 1949, when a small contingent of [[Tatars]] migrated from Finland. Islam's presence in Sweden remained marginal until the 1960s, when Sweden started to receive migrants from [[the Balkans]] and [[Turkey]].

=== Health ===
{{See also|Healthcare in Sweden|Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare}}
Healthcare in Sweden is similar in quality to other developed nations. Sweden ranks in the top five countries with respect to low [[infant mortality]]. It also ranks high in [[life expectancy]] and in safe [[drinking water]]. A person seeking care first contacts a clinic for a doctor's appointment, and may then be referred to a specialist by the clinic physician, who may in turn recommend either in-patient or out-patient treatment, or an elective care option. The health care is governed by the 21 [[County Councils of Sweden|landsting]] of Sweden and is mainly funded by taxes, with nominal fees for patients.

=== Education ===
{{Main|Education in Sweden}}
[[File:Entrance hall of Uppsala University main building.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Uppsala University]] (established 1477)]]
Children aged 1–5 years old are guaranteed a place in a public [[kindergarten]] ({{lang-sv|förskola}} or, colloquially, ''dagis''). Between the ages of 6 and 16, children attend compulsory comprehensive school. In the [[Programme for International Student Assessment]] (PISA), Swedish 15-year-old pupils score close to the OECD average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/42/8/39700724.pdf |publisher=[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] |title=PISA results for Sweden |format=PDF |accessdate=25 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing the 9th grade, about 90% of the students continue with a three-year upper secondary school (''gymnasium''), which can lead to both a job qualification or entrance eligibility to university. The school system is largely financed by taxes.

The Swedish government treats public and independent schools equally&lt;ref name="swedishmodeleconomist"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11535645|title=The Swedish model|work=[[The Economist]]|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; by introducing [[education voucher]]s in 1992 as one of the first countries in the world after the Netherlands. Anyone can establish a for-profit school and the municipality must pay new schools the same amount as municipal schools get. School lunch is free for all students in Sweden, and providing breakfast is also encouraged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.childrensfoodtrust.org.uk/assets/research-reports/school_food_in18countries.pdf |title=The provision of school food in 18 countries |publisher=[[Children's Food Trust]] |date=July 2008 |accessdate=9 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130301002902/http://www.childrensfoodtrust.org.uk/assets/research-reports/school_food_in18countries.pdf |archivedate=1 March 2013 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immigration ===
{{Main|Immigration to Sweden}}

Immigration has been a major source of [[population growth]] and cultural change throughout much of the [[history of Sweden]], and in recent centuries the country has been transformed from a nation of net emigration, ending after World War I, to a nation of net immigration, from World War II onwards. The economic, social, and political aspects of immigration have caused controversy regarding ethnicity, economic benefits, jobs for non-immigrants, settlement patterns, impact on upward [[social mobility]], crime, and voting behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21570836-immigration-and-growing-inequality-are-making-nordics-less-homogeneous-ins-and |title=Immigrants: The ins and the outs |newspaper=[[The Economist]] |date=2 February 2013|accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no exact numbers on the [[ethnicity|ethnic]] background of migrants and their descendants in Sweden because the Swedish government does not base any statistics on ethnicity. This is, however, not to be confused with the migrants' [[Nationality|national backgrounds]], which are recorded.

[[File:Invandrare utvandrare Sverige 1850-2007.svg|thumb|Immigrants (red) and emigrants (blue), Sweden 1850–2007]]
In 2016, there were 2,320,302 inhabitants of a foreign background (foreign-born and children of international migrants), comprising around 23% of the Swedish population.

According to an official investigation by [[Ministry of Finance (Sweden)#Financial Institutions and Markets Department|The Swedish Pensions Agency]] on order from the government, the immigration to Sweden will double the state's expenses for pensions to the population. The total immigration to Sweden for 2017 will be roughly 180 000 people, and after that 110 000 individuals every year.&lt;ref name="DI Pensions"&gt;{{cite news|date=17 October 2017|title=Migrationen kan fördubbla statens kostnader för pensionärer|url=https://www.di.se/nyheter/migrationen-kan-fordubbla-statens-kostnader-for-pensionarer/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pensions Agency Report"&gt;{{cite news|date=13 October 2017|title=Pensionsmyndigheten svarar på regeringsuppdrag om migration|url=https://www.pensionsmyndigheten.se/nyheter-och-press/pressrum/pensionsmyndigheten-svarar-pa-regeringsuppdrag-om-migration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture ==
{{Main|Culture of Sweden}}
[[File:Nationalmuseum Stockholm.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Nationalmuseum]] in Stockholm]]
Sweden has many authors of worldwide recognition including [[August Strindberg]], [[Astrid Lindgren]], and Nobel Prize winners [[Selma Lagerlöf]] and [[Harry Martinson]]. In total seven [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prizes in Literature]] have been awarded to Swedes. The nation's most well-known artists are painters such as [[Carl Larsson]] and [[Anders Zorn]], and the sculptors [[Tobias Sergel]] and [[Carl Milles]].

Swedish 20th-century culture is noted by pioneering works in the early days of cinema, with [[Mauritz Stiller]] and [[Victor Sjöström]]. In the 1920s–1980s, the filmmaker [[Ingmar Bergman]] and actors [[Greta Garbo]] and [[Ingrid Bergman]] became internationally noted people within cinema. More recently, the films of [[Lukas Moodysson]], [[Lasse Hallström]], and [[Ruben Östlund]] have received international recognition.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s Sweden was seen as an international leader in what is now referred to as the "[[sexual revolution]]", with gender equality having particularly been promoted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sweden.se/eng/Home/Lifestyle/Reading/The-Swedish-myths-True-false-or-somewhere-in-between/ |title=The Swedish Myths: True, False, or Somewhere In Between? |publisher=Sweden.se |accessdate=27 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917004928/http://www.sweden.se/eng/Home/Lifestyle/Reading/The-Swedish-myths-True-false-or-somewhere-in-between/ |archivedate=17 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early Swedish film ''[[I Am Curious (Yellow)]]'' (1967) reflected a liberal view of sexuality, including scenes of love making that caught international attention, and introduced the concept of the "Swedish sin" that had been introduced earlier in the US with Ingmar Bergman's ''[[Summer with Monika]].''

The image of "hot love and cold people" emerged. Sexual liberalism was seen as part of modernisation process that by breaking down traditional borders would lead to the emancipation of natural forces and desires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Carl |last1= Marklund |title=Hot Love and Cold People. Sexual Liberalism as Political Escapism in Radical Sweden |year=2009 |journal=NORDEUROPAforum |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages =83–101 |url=http://edoc.hu-berlin.de/nordeuropaforum/2009-1/marklund-carl-83/XML/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sweden has also become very liberal towards homosexuality, as is reflected in the popular acceptance of films such as ''[[Fucking Åmål|Show Me Love]]'', which is about two young lesbians in the small Swedish town of Åmål. Since 1 May 2009, Sweden repealed its "registered partnership" laws and fully replaced them with [[gender-neutral marriage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sweden passes new gay marriage law |newspaper=[[The Local]] |date=2 April 2009 |url=http://www.thelocal.se/18608/20090402/ |accessdate=5 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410151816/http://www.thelocal.se/18608/20090402/ |archivedate=10 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden also offers [[domestic partnership]]s for both same-sex and opposite-sex couples. Cohabitation (''sammanboende'') by couples of all ages, including teenagers as well as elderly couples, is widespread. Recently, Sweden is experiencing a baby boom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Babyboom i Sverige? |url=http://www.scb.se/Pages/TableAndChart____231102.aspx |language=Swedish |publisher=[[Statistics Sweden]] |accessdate=5 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090730195209/http://www.scb.se/Pages/TableAndChart____231102.aspx |archivedate=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical re-creations of Norse music have been attempted based on instruments found in Viking sites. The instruments used were the ''[[lur]]'' (a sort of trumpet), simple string instruments, wooden flutes and drums. Sweden has a significant [[Music of Sweden|folk-music]] scene. There is Sami music, called the ''[[joik]]'', which is a type of chant which is part of the traditional Sami animistic spirituality. Notable composers include [[Carl Michael Bellman]] and [[Franz Berwald]].

Sweden also has a prominent choral music tradition. Out of a population of 9.5 million, it is estimated that five to six hundred thousand people sing in choirs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Durant |first=Colin |year=2003 |title=Choral Conducting: philosophy and practice |publisher=Routledge |pages=46–47 |isbn=0-415-94356-6 |quote=Sweden has a strong and enviable choral singing tradition.

With ABBA, Sweden entered into a new era, in which [[Swedish pop music]] gained international prominence.
[[File:GoteborgsOperan.jpg|thumb|left|The [[The Göteborg Opera|Gothenburg Opera House]]]]
There have been many other internationally successful bands since, such as [[Roxette]], [[Ace of Base]], [[Europe (band)|Europe]], [[A-teens]], [[The Cardigans]], [[Robyn]], [[The Hives]] and [[Soundtrack of Our Lives]], to name some of the biggest.

Sweden has also become known for a large number of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands, including [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]], [[Opeth]], [[Amon Amarth]] and [[Ghost (Swedish band)|Ghost]]. The renowned [[Neo-classical metal|neo-classical power metal]] guitarist [[Yngwie Malmsteen]] is also from Sweden.

Starting in the 1990s, [[Denniz Pop]]'s [[Cheiron Studios]] became an international hit factory, with his disciple [[Max Martin]] responsible for [[Britney Spears]]' breakthrough songs and for shaping the whole boy-band boom at the turn of the millennium with global hits for groups like the [[Backstreet Boys]] and [['N Sync]]. In the mid-2000s, Martin came back with a more rock-tinged sound and produced major hits with artists such as [[Kelly Clarkson]], [[Pink (singer)|Pink]] and [[Katy Perry]]. Another producer worth mentioning is [[RedOne]], a Moroccan-Swede who is the creator of a slew of hits for [[Lady Gaga]].

[[Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest|Sweden]] is one of the most successful competing nations at the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], with a total of six victories in the contest (1974, 1984, 1991, 1999, 2012 and 2015), right behind Ireland who have seven wins. In the Eurovision Song Contest each participating country submits an original song to be performed on live television and radio; however, no restriction on the nationality of the songwriter or the artist exists which has resulted in countries being represented by songwriters and artist who are not nationals of that country. In recent years Swedish songwriters have been involved in the writing – entirely or partly – of entries from several countries in addition to Sweden. For instance, in the 2012 edition of Eurovision Song Contest, Swedish songwriters and producers featured in 10 out of the 42 songs that qualified for the contest; in 2013, the numbers were 7 songs out of the 39 songs in the contest; in 2014, 7 songs out of 37 songs in the contest; in 2015, 8 songs out of 40 songs in the contest; in 2016, 12 songs out of 42 songs in the contest.

Sweden has a rather lively jazz scene. During the last sixty years or so it has attained a remarkably high artistic standard, stimulated by domestic as well as external influences and experiences. The Centre for Swedish Folk Music and Jazz Research has published an overview of jazz in Sweden by Lars Westin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visarkiv.se/en/jazz/index.htm |title=Lars Westin: Jazz in Sweden – an overview |publisher=Visarkiv.se |accessdate=25 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623003444/http://www.visarkiv.se/en/jazz/index.htm |archivedate=23 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
{{Main|Architecture of Sweden}}
[[File:Djurgardsbron 2008.jpg|left|thumb|[[Djurgårdsbron]]]]
Before the 13th century almost all buildings were made of timber, but a shift began towards stone. Early Swedish stone buildings are the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] churches on the country side. As so happens, many of them were built in Scania and are in effect Danish churches. This would include the [[Lund Cathedral]] from the 11th century and the somewhat younger church in [[Dalby, Lund|Dalby]], but also many early [[Gothic (architecture)|Gothic]] churches built through influences of the Hanseatic League, such as in Ystad, Malmö and Helsingborg.

Cathedrals in other parts of Sweden were also built as seats of Sweden's bishops. The [[Skara Cathedral]] is of bricks from the 14th century, and the [[Uppsala Cathedral]] in the 15th. In 1230 the foundations of the [[Linköping]] Cathedral were made, the material was there [[limestone]], but the building took some 250 years to finish.

Among older structures are also some significant fortresses and other historical buildings such as at [[Borgholm Castle]], [[Halltorps Manor]] and [[Eketorp]] fortress on the island Öland, the [[Nyköping]] fortress and the [[Visby city wall]].

[[File:Kalmar domkyrka 002.jpg|thumb|[[Kalmar Cathedral]]]]
Around 1520 Sweden was out of the [[Middle Ages]] and united under King Gustav Vasa, who immediately initiated grand mansions, castles and fortresses to be built. Some of the more magnificent include the Kalmar fortress, the [[Gripsholm Castle]] and the one at [[Vadstena]].

In the next two centuries, Sweden was designated by [[Baroque architecture]] and later the [[rococo]]. Notable projects from that time include the city Karlskrona, which has now also been declared a World Heritage Site and the [[Drottningholm Palace]].

1930 was the year of the great Stockholm exhibition, which marked the breakthrough of [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]], or "funkis" as it became known. The style came to dominate in the following decades. Some notable projects of this kind were the [[Million Programme]], offering affordable living in large apartment complexes.

===Media===
{{Main|Media in Sweden}}
[[File:Sveriges Television, 2.jpg|thumb|Headquarters of [[Sveriges Television]] in Stockholm]]
Swedes are among the greatest consumers of newspapers in the world, and nearly every town is served by a local paper. The country's main quality morning papers are ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'' (liberal), ''[[Göteborgs-Posten]]'' (liberal), ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]'' (liberal conservative) and ''[[Sydsvenska Dagbladet]]'' (liberal). The two largest evening [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloids]] are ''[[Aftonbladet]]'' (social democratic) and ''[[Expressen]]'' (liberal). The ad-financed, free international morning paper, ''[[Metro International]]'', was founded in Stockholm, Sweden. The country's news is reported in English by, among others, ''[[The Local]]'' (liberal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Kenneth E. |last=Olson |title=The history makers;: The press of Europe from its beginnings through 1965 |publisher=LSU Press |year=1966 |pages=33–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The public broadcasting companies held a monopoly on radio and television for a long time in Sweden. Licence funded radio broadcasts started in 1925. A second radio network was started in 1954 and a third opened 1962 in response to pirate radio stations. Non-profit [[Community radio#Sweden|community radio]] was allowed in 1979 and in 1993 commercial local radio started.

The licence-funded television service was officially launched in 1956. A second channel, [[SVT2|TV2]], was launched in 1969. These two channels (operated by [[Sveriges Television]] since the late 1970s) held a monopoly until the 1980s when cable and satellite television became available. The first Swedish language satellite service was [[TV3 (Sweden)|TV3]] which started broadcasting from London in 1987. It was followed by [[Kanal 5 (Sweden)|Kanal 5]] in 1989 (then known as Nordic Channel) and [[TV4 (Sweden)|TV4]] in 1990.

In 1991 the government announced it would begin taking applications from private television companies wishing to broadcast on the [[terrestrial television|terrestrial network]]. TV4, which had previously been broadcasting via satellite, was granted a permit and began its terrestrial broadcasts in 1992, becoming the first private channel to broadcast television content from within the country.

Around half the population are connected to cable television. [[Digital terrestrial television in Sweden]] started in 1999 and the last analogue terrestrial broadcasts were terminated in 2007.

===Literature===
{{Main|Swedish literature}}
[[File:Portrait of August Strindberg by Richard Bergh 1905.jpg|upright|thumb|The writer and playwright [[August Strindberg]]]]

The first literary text from Sweden is the [[Rök Runestone]], carved during the Viking Age c. 800 AD. With the conversion of the land to Christianity around 1100 AD, Sweden entered the [[Middle Ages]], during which monastic writers preferred to use Latin. Therefore, there are only a few texts in the [[Swedish language#Old Swedish|Old Swedish]] from that period. Swedish literature only flourished when the Swedish language was standardised in the 16th century, a standardisation largely due to the full translation of the Bible into Swedish in 1541. This translation is the so-called [[Gustav Vasa Bible]].

With improved education and the freedom brought by [[secularisation]], the 17th century saw several notable authors develop the Swedish language further. Some key figures include [[Georg Stiernhielm]] (17th century), who was the first to write classical poetry in Swedish; [[Johan Henric Kellgren]] (18th century), the first to write fluent Swedish prose; Carl Michael Bellman (late 18th century), the first writer of [[burlesque]] ballads; and August Strindberg (late 19th century), a socio-realistic writer and playwright who won worldwide fame. The early 20th century continued to produce notable authors, such as Selma Lagerlöf, (Nobel laureate 1909), [[Verner von Heidenstam]] (Nobel laureate 1916) and [[Pär Lagerkvist]] (Nobel laureate 1951).

In recent decades, a handful of Swedish writers have established themselves internationally, including the detective novelist [[Henning Mankell]] and the writer of spy fiction [[Jan Guillou]]. The Swedish writer to have made the most lasting impression on world literature is the children's book writer Astrid Lindgren, and her books about [[Pippi Longstocking]], [[Emil i Lönneberga|Emil]], and others. In 2008, the second best-selling fiction author in the world was [[Stieg Larsson]], whose ''Millennium'' series of crime novels is being published posthumously to critical acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abebooks.com/blog/index.php/2009/01/15/bestselling-fiction-authors-in-the-world-for-2008/ |title=Bestselling fiction authors in the world for 2008 |publisher=Abebooks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larsson drew heavily on the work of Lindgren by basing his central character, Lisbeth Salander, on Longstocking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jul/26/stieg-larsson-thriller-novels-sweden|title=Poisoned Legacy Left By The King Of Thrillers|first=Vanessa |last=Thorpe|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Holidays===
{{Main|Public holidays in Sweden}}
[[File:Valborgsbrasa-1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Walpurgis Night]] bonfire in Sweden]]
Apart from traditional Protestant [[Liturgical year|Christian holidays]], Sweden also celebrates some unique holidays, some of a pre-Christian tradition. They include [[Midsummer]] celebrating the summer [[solstice]]; [[Walpurgis Night]] (''Valborgsmässoafton'') on 30 April lighting bonfires; and Labour Day or Mayday on 1 May is dedicated to socialist demonstrations. The day of giver-of-light [[Saint Lucy|Saint Lucia]], 13 December, is widely acknowledged in elaborate celebrations which betoken its Italian origin and commence the month-long Christmas season.

6 June is the [[National holiday of Sweden|National Day of Sweden]] and has since 2005 been a public holiday. Furthermore, there are [[Flag days in Sweden|official flag day]] observances and a [[Namesdays in Sweden]] calendar. In August many Swedes have ''kräftskivor'' (crayfish dinner parties). [[Martin of Tours]] Eve is celebrated in [[Scania]] in November with ''Mårten Gås'' parties, where roast goose and ''[[svartsoppa]]'' ('black soup', made of goose stock, fruit, spices, spirits and goose blood) are served. The [[Sami people|Sami]], one of Sweden's indigenous minorities, have their holiday on 6 February and Scania celebrate their Scanian Flag day on the third Sunday in July.

===Cuisine===

{{Main|Swedish cuisine}}
[[File:Minibon junto a un Cinnabon classic - Panamá - 2011.jpg|thumb|The [[cinnamon roll]]s were originated in Sweden and Denmark.]]
[[File:Knaeckebroed.jpg|thumb|Swedish knäckebröd ([[crisp bread]])]]

Swedish cuisine, like that of the other [[Scandinavia]]n countries ([[Cuisine of Denmark|Denmark]], [[Cuisine of Norway|Norway]] and [[Cuisine of Finland|Finland]]), was traditionally simple. Fish (particularly [[herring]]), meat, potatoes and [[dairy products]] played prominent roles. Spices were sparse. Famous preparations include Swedish meatballs, traditionally served with gravy, boiled potatoes and [[lingonberry jam]]; pancakes; ''[[lutefisk|lutfisk]]''; and the [[smörgåsbord]], or lavish buffet. ''[[Akvavit]]'' is a popular alcoholic [[distilled beverage]], and the drinking of ''[[snaps]]'' is of cultural importance. The traditional flat and dry [[crisp bread]] has developed into several contemporary variants. Regionally important foods are the ''[[surströmming]]'' (a fermented fish) in northern Sweden and [[eel]] in Scania in southern Sweden.

Swedish traditional dishes, some of which are many hundreds of years old, others perhaps a century or less, are still a very important part of Swedish everyday meals, in spite of the fact that modern-day Swedish cuisine adopts many international dishes.

In August, at the traditional feast known as crayfish party, ''[[kräftskiva]]'', Swedes eat large amounts of [[crayfish]] boiled with dill.

===Cinema===
{{Main|Cinema of Sweden}}
Swedes have been fairly prominent in the film area through the years. A number of Swedish people have found success in Hollywood, including Ingrid Bergman, Greta Garbo and [[Max von Sydow]]. Amongst several directors who have made internationally successful films can be mentioned Ingmar Bergman, Lukas Moodysson and Lasse Hallström.

===Fashion===
Interest in fashion is big in Sweden and the country is headquartering famous brands like [[H&amp;M|Hennes &amp; Mauritz]] (operating as H&amp;M), [[J. Lindeberg]] (operating as JL), [[Acne Jeans|Acne]], [[Lindex]], [[Odd Molly]], [[Cheap Monday]], [[Gant U.S.A.|Gant]], [[WESC]], [[Filippa K]], and [[Nakkna]] within its borders. These companies, however, are composed largely of buyers who import fashionable goods from throughout Europe and America, continuing the trend of Swedish business toward multinational economic dependency like many of its neighbours.

===Sports===
{{Main|Sport in Sweden}}
[[File:Björn Borg2.jpg|thumb|upright|Former World No. 1 tennis player [[Björn Borg]]]]
Sport activities are a national movement with half of the population actively participating in organised sporting activities. The two main spectator sports are [[Association football|football]] and [[ice hockey]]. Second to football, [[Horse#Sport|horse sports]] have the highest number of practitioners who are mostly women.{{ambiguous|date=February 2018}}&lt;!--should probably be "most of whom are women"?--&gt; Thereafter, golf, [[track and field]], and the [[team sport]]s of [[handball]], [[floorball]], basketball and [[bandy]] are the most popular.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The Swedish national men's ice hockey team, affectionately known as ''[[Sweden men's national ice hockey team|Tre Kronor]]'' (English: [[Three Crowns]]; the national symbol of Sweden), is regarded as one of the best in the world. The team has won the [[Ice Hockey World Championships|World Championships]] nine times, placing them third in the all-time medal count. Tre Kronor also won Olympic gold medals in [[Ice hockey at the 1994 Winter Olympics|1994]] and [[Ice hockey at the 2006 Winter Olympics|2006]]. In 2006, Tre Kronor became the first national hockey team to win both the Olympic and world championships in the same year. The [[Sweden national football team|Swedish national football team]] has seen some success at the World Cup in the past, finishing second when they hosted the tournament in 1958, and third twice, in [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]] and [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]]. Athletics has enjoyed a surge in popularity due to several successful athletes in recent years, such as [[Carolina Klüft]] and [[Stefan Holm]].

Sweden hosted the [[1912 Summer Olympics]], [[Equestrian at the 1956 Summer Olympics]] and the [[FIFA World Cup]] in [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]]. Other big sports events include the [[UEFA Euro 1992]], [[1995 FIFA Women's World Cup]], [[1995 World Championships in Athletics]], [[UEFA Women's Euro 2013]], and several championships of ice hockey, [[curling]], athletics, [[skiing]], [[Bandy World Championship|bandy]], [[figure skating]] and swimming.

Successful football players include [[Gunnar Nordahl]], [[Gunnar Gren]], [[Nils Liedholm]], [[Henrik Larsson]], [[Fredrik Ljungberg]], [[Caroline Seger]], [[Lotta Schelin]], [[Hedvig Lindahl]], and [[Zlatan Ibrahimović]]. Successful tennis players include former world number 1 players [[Björn Borg]], [[Mats Wilander]] and [[Stefan Edberg]]. Other famous Swedish athletes include the [[heavyweight]] [[boxing]] champion and [[International Boxing Hall of Fame]]r [[Ingemar Johansson]], [[World Golf Hall of Fame]]r [[Annika Sörenstam]], and multiple World Championships and Olympics medalist in table tennis [[Jan-Ove Waldner]]. Due to its northerly latitude numerous world class winter sports athletes have come from Sweden. This includes alpine skiers [[Ingemar Stenmark]], [[Anja Pärson]] and [[Pernilla Wiberg]] as well as cross country-skiers [[Gunde Svan]], [[Thomas Wassberg]], [[Charlotte Kalla]] and [[Marcus Hellner]], all Olympic gold medalists.

In 2016 The Swedish Poker Federation (Svepof) has joined The [[International Federation of Poker]] (IFP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pokerfed.org/2016/05/17/sweden-becomes-member-ifp-family/|title=Sweden Becomes a Member of the IFP Family|last=Goenka|first=Varun|date=17 May 2016|website=International Federation of Poker|access-date=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thornbrough Air Force Base''' is a former facility of the [[United States Air Force]] in [[Cold Bay]], [[Alaska]]. Following its closure, it was redeveloped into [[Cold Bay Airport]].

==History==
The airport was constructed during [[World War II]] as '''Fort Randall Army Airfield''' during the secret military buildup of the [[Territory of Alaska]] that began in 1941. Originally, the equipment was supposed to construct [[McGrath Army Airbase]], but the ground had frozen by the time that the equipment arrived.&lt;ref name=EAF&gt;{{cite web|title=HISTORY OF THE ELEVENTH AIR FORCE|url=http://www.hlswilliwaw.com/aleutians/11thAirForce/html/11thAF_history.htm|publisher=[[Eleventh Air Force]]|accessdate=15 September 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217222506/http://www.hlswilliwaw.com/aleutians/11thAirForce/html/11thAF_history.htm|archivedate=17 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disguised as civilian employees of the Blair Canning and Packing Company, [[United States Army]] personnel in civilian clothes were shipped to Cold Bay. Construction began in December 1941, and the airfield was ready for operation by March 1942.  Because of the foresight of Alaska{{'}}s military commanders, the new airfield, along with another new secret airfield, [[Cape Field at Fort Glenn|Cape Field]] at [[Umnak]], was ready to contribute to the defense of Alaska against [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] air attack during the [[Battle of Dutch Harbor]] in June 1942.  The airfield at Cold Bay remained operational throughout World War II.

Known units assigned to Fort Randall Army Airfield (AAF) were:
* [[73d Bombardment Squadron]], numerous short dates, 1942–1943
* [[344th Fighter Squadron]], numerous short dates, 1942–1943
* [[54th Fighter Squadron]], June–July 1942
* [[11th Fighter Squadron]], May–September 1942

Fort Randall AAF was also used by the [[United States Navy]] during the [[Aleutian campaign]].   A two-gun 6-inch (152-mm) naval gun battery was located at Grant Point. One gun is on display near the town dump. A four-gun 155&amp;nbsp;mm gun battery on [[Panama mount]]s was located at Mortensen's Lagoon at Thin Point. The HECP bunker still exists at Pride Lake.

In the spring and summer of 1945, Cold Bay was the site of the largest and most ambitious transfer program of World War II, [[Project Hula]], in which the United States transferred 149 ships and craft to the [[Soviet Union]] and trained 12,000 Soviet personnel in their operation in anticipation of the Soviet Union entering the [[Pacific War|war against Japan]]. Fort Randall provided housing and classroom space for the instructors and trainees. At any given time, about 1,500 American personnel were at Cold Bay and Fort Randall during Project Hula.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Richard A., ''Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan'', Washington, D.C.: [[Naval Historical Center]], 1997, {{ISBN|0-945274-35-1}}, pp. 1, 13, 16, 35.&lt;/ref&gt;The area to the southeast of the Fort Randall Air Air Field runways was known as "Navy Town".  In addition to housing, this area also included a theater, hospital and a runway.

The airfield was named '''Thornbrough Air Force Base''' in 1948 for [[Captain (United States)|Captain]] [[George W. Thornbrough]], a U.S. Army Air Forces [[B-26 Marauder]] pilot.  Captain Thornbrough fought during the Battle of Dutch Harbor in June 1942, bravely attacking a Japanese [[aircraft carrier]] that was launching strike aircraft at [[Dutch Harbor]].  Although his [[torpedo]] struck the carrier, it failed to explode.  Captain Thornbrough returned to his airfield to refuel and rearm and then took off to rejoin the fight.  The aircraft and entire crew were lost during their return from this mission, when they were unable to land at Cold Bay.  The wreckage of Captain Thornbrough's aircraft was found 50 miles (80&amp;nbsp;km) from Cold Bay on the north side of the Alaska Peninsula the following month.

It was redesignated from Army Air Base (AAB) to an [[Air Force Base]] (AFB) on 28 March 1948 along with seven other Army Air Bases in Alaska. Its chief assets were a 10,000-foot runway and a deep-water dock. It was controlled by the 5024th Air Base Squadron, [[Alaskan Air Command]] (AAC).  It was logistically supported by the 39th Air Depot Wing at [[Elmendorf Air Force Base]]. Its mission became supporting [[Military Air Transport Service]] (MATS) transport flights along the [[Great Circle Route]] from Japan, as well as supporting the 7th (later 9th) Weather Group which provided support for [[WB-29 Superfortress]] flights of the [[58th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron]] at [[Eielson AFB]] which operated over the Northern Pacific and Bering Sea.  Both the runway and dock have continued in service to this day serving as transportation hubs for airlines and shipping.

The 5042d ABS was discontinued on 1 January 1950 per AAC General Order Number 198, dated 13 December 1949, due to budget restrictions. Control of the base was taken over directly by AAC. It was planned for inactivation; however, the transport demands by MATS flying to Japan to support the [[Korean War]] delayed the inevitable closing of the base until 1 September 1953 by AAC General Order 66.

Between 1956 and 1958, Cold Bay Airport was used as a logistics support base during the construction of [[Cold Bay Air Force Station]], a Ground Control Intercept (GCI) station for Alaskan Air Command during the [[Cold War]].  Today, the airport is used by the USAF [[611th Air Support Group]], based at [[Elmendorf AFB]] to support the unattended Long Range Radar (LRR) site A-08 just to the northwest of the airport.

'''Tinglish''' (US and Thailand)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Davos, Tokyo and clueless Tinglish|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=2012-03-10|author=[[Kong Rithdee]]|page=7|quote=Seriously, watching that clip, I rooted for her to pull it off, to show that [[Suvarnabhumi English]], our Tinglish, is as good as any as long as what she meant to say came off.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  or '''Thaiglish''' (UK) (also '''Thenglish''', '''Thailish''' or '''Thainglish''') is the imperfect, [[Macaronic language|macaronic]] form of English produced by native [[Thai language|Thai]] speakers due to [[language transfer|language interference]] from the first language {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}.  Differences from standard native English include [[Non-native pronunciations of English#Thai|errant pronunciation]], unusual word choices, and grammatical anomalies, as well as innovative vocabulary items {{Or|date=February 2010}}.

==Pronunciation==

As some sounds in English just simply don't exist in Thai language, this affects the way native Thai speakers [[pronunciation|pronounce]] English words {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}:
* [[Rhotic and non-rhotic accents|Non-rhotic]], e.g., more -&gt; maw ({{IPA|[mɔː]}}), gear -&gt; gia ({{IPA|[kia]}}), and car -&gt; kah ({{IPA|[kʰaː]}}).
* all syllables are stressed with the same intensity
* omits consonant clusters. "Mixed" is pronounced "mik".
* final consonants are often omitted or converted according to the rules of Thai pronunciation: ''l'' and ''r'' become ''n''; ''p''; ''b'' and ''f'' become an occlusive ''p''; ''t'', ''th'', ''d'', ''s'', ''st'', ''sh'', ''ch'' and ''j'' become an occlusive ''t''.  
* Perversely, given the language constraints for ''d'' and ''l'' among the rules above, ''l'' can become ''r'' and ''d'' can become ''sh'', for instance ''blood'' can become ''brush''.
* If there is more than one consonant at the end of a syllable, only the first is pronounced, the others are omitted. "W" and "Y" sounds count as consonants, too. So, "count down" becomes "cow dow", "size" becomes "sigh"
* "sh" and "ch" sounds can be indistinguishable as the Thai language does not have the "sh" sound, e.g., ship/chip, sheep/cheap
* "v" sound is almost always replaced by "w" sound, e.g. "TV" is pronounced "tee-wee" and "video" is pronounced "wee-dee-oh". 
* "g" and "z" sounds are usually devoiced, e.g., dog -&gt; dock ({{IPA|[ˈdɔk]}}), zoo -&gt; sue ({{IPA|[ˈsuː]}})
* "th" sound is often replaced by "t" or "d" sound. Particularly, the voiceless "th" ({{IPA|/θ/}}) is replaced by {{IPA|[t]}} or {{IPA|[tʰ]}}, while the voiced "th" ({{IPA|/ð/}}) is replaced by {{IPA|[d]}}, e.g. thin -&gt; tin ({{IPA|[ˈtin]}}) or {{IPA|[ˈtʰin]}}), through -&gt; true ({{IPA|[ˈtʰɹuː]}}), thank you -&gt; tang kyou ({{IPA|[tɛŋ kiw]}}) or ({{IPA|[tʰɛŋ kiw]}}), and then -&gt; den ({{IPA|[ˈden]}}).
* ambiguity between the short "e" ({{IPA|/ɛ/}}), as in "bled", and a long "a" ({{IPA|/eɪ/}}), as in "blade" because both are pronounced as {{IPA|[e(ː)]}}.
* "e (vowel) " so cherry is pronounced chuhr-lee, error is pronounced err-rer

In Thai, certain consonants cannot occur as a [[consonant cluster]]. Such illicit clusters include those with [[Sibilant consonants|sibilant sounds]] followed by [[Obstruent consonant|obstruent sounds]]. In order to avoid such illicit forms, a short "a" (ah; [ə]) sound is added between these consonants:

*start - sahtat ({{IPA|/səˈtaːt/}})
*sleep - sahleep ({{IPA|/səˈliːp/}})
*speak - sahpeak ({{IPA|/səˈpiːk/}})
*snore - sahnore ({{IPA|/səˈnɔː/}})
*swim - sahwim ({{IPA|/səˈwim/}})
*school - sahkoon ({{IPA|/səˈkʰuːn/}})
*album - alabum ({{IPA|/ələˈbam/}})

'R' or 'l' after another consonant may be omitted completely.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1871">[[Image:TPS France.jpg|right]]'''Télévision Par Satellite''' ''(TPS)'' was a [[France|French]] company that offered subscription television packages via satellite.

It was created in 1996 by the [[TF1 Group]], the [[M6 Group]], [[Orange (telecommunications)|Orange]] (formerly France Télécom), [[France Télévisions]], [[RTL Group]] and [[Suez Environnement]]. France Télévisions left the company in 2002.

TPS offered various channels, including some owned by themselves:
*[[TPS Star]], the general entertainment flagship channel
*[[TPS Foot]], a football channel
*[[MASTV|Multivision]], a 7-channel premium PPV service
*And several movie channels: TPS Cineclub, TPS CinéComedy, TPS Cinéculte, TPS Cinextrême, TPS Cinéfamily, TPS Cinéstar, TPS Cinétoile and TPS Homecinéma.

In November 2005, it was announced that TPS would merge with its competitor [[CanalSat]], owned by the [[Canal+ Group]].

The two distributors merged their packages on March 21, 2007. Essentially, TPS merged into CanalSat which was then branded as [[Nouveau CanalSat]]. All the TPS branded movie channels were merged into the Canal+-owned [[CinéCinéma]] package, TPS Star and TPS Foot would be the only channels that still used the TPS brand. Some new channels launched on both platforms. Eventually, the TPS service from the [[Hot Bird]] satellites will close down and the former TPS customers will have to change their equipment to receive the CanalSat service from the [[Astra 19.2°E|Astra]] satellites instead.

WHITIA's vision is to facilitate the deployment of thousands of digital medical imaging systems worldwide, providing one billion people with access to diagnostic imaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldhealthimaging.org/ |title=Welcome to WHITIA &amp;#124; Homepage |publisher=Worldhealthimaging.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; WHITIA was formerly known as the World Health Imaging Alliance (WHIA) until it formally expanded its scope in June 2009.

WHITIA's first formal public launch was in April 2009 at the [[HIMSS|Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS)]] Annual Conference &amp; Exhibition in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. WHITIA announced strategic partners including [[SEDECAL]], [[Carestream Health]] and [[Merge Healthcare]], receiving extensive coverage in [[Health IT]] magazines and publications.&lt;ref name="HIMSS09"&gt;{{cite news | accessdate = 2009-07-02 | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS111037+06-Apr-2009+BW20090406 | title = Not-for-Profit Has a Vision to Help a Billion People | publisher= Reuters | date=2009-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yahoofinance1"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 2009-07-02 | url = https://finance.yahoo.com/news/Merge-Healthcare-Commits-1-bw-14855801.html?x=1&amp;.v=1 | title = World Health Imaging Alliance Poised to Bring Imaging Diagnostics and Data to the Developing World | publisher= Yahoo Finance}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2009 Annual  Conference of the Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine (SIIM) in [[Charlotte]], [[North Carolina]], WHITIA announced its partnership with [[Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine|SIIM]], which will allow both organizations to collaborate on specific initiatives.&lt;ref name="SIIM09"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 2009-07-02 | url = http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20090605005136/en | title = World Health Imaging Alliance (WHIA) Announces Support From The Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine (SIIM) | publisher= Business Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IE09"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 2009-07-02 | url = http://www.imagingeconomics.com/news/2009-06-17_01.asp | title = World Health Imaging Alliance poised to bring imaging diagnostics and data to the developing world | publisher= Imaging Economics}}&lt;/ref&gt; WHITIA was recently ranked #15 of the top 25 most influential people, institutions, and organizations in the radiology industry.&lt;ref name="rt-image"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 2009-10-22 | url = http://www.rt-image.com/25_Most_Influential_in_Radiology_Recognizing_the_movers_and_shakers_in_the_radio/content=9004J05E48B6A084409698724488B0441 | title = 25 Most Influential in Radiology | publisher= rt Image}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2009 [[Radiological Society of North America|RSNA]] Annual Meeting, WHITIA launched, '''Remi-d''', a remote-operated screening X-ray system for use in the developing world. Its strengths in these areas stem from the higher burden of [[Human Immunodeficiency Virus]] (HIV) and [[Tuberculosis]] (TB) co-infection, high incidences of [[Coalworker's pneumoconiosis|Black Lung disease]], or outbreaks of other infectious [[respiratory diseases]]. The teleradiology and remote-controlled features of Remi-d allow resource-limited areas such as sub-Saharan Africa, South and Central America and Southeast Asia, where [[Radiologist]]s and [[Radiographer]]s are in short supply to have a functioning X-ray service.&lt;ref name="RSNA09"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 2009-12-01 | url = http://www.news-medical.net/news/20091130/WHITIA-launches-digital-medical-X-ray-device-for-screening-infectious-diseases-in-developing-countries.aspx | title = WHITIA launches digital medical X-ray device for screening infectious diseases in developing countries | publisher= THE MEDICAL NEWS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WHITIA currently has [[Pilot (experiment)|pilot]] [[System integration|integrated]] [[digital X-ray]] sites in [[South Africa]] and [[Guatemala]] at established [[clinics]] in need and is expanding to new qualified sites in [[partnership]] with [[NGOs]] such as [[Rotary International]] while cooperating with the [[local government|local]] and [[Central government|national governments]].&lt;ref name="HTW09"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 2009-07-02 | url = http://www.healthtechwire.com/The-Industry-s-News-unb.146+M5a262949a06.0.html | title = SIIM to Support World Health Imaging Alliance | publisher= HealthTech Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Guatemala clinics ==
The Guatemala pilot sites in urban [[Guatemala City]] and [[rural]] [[Río Hondo, Zacapa|Río Hondo]] provide essential healthcare technology to thousands of people in the communities served. They are designed to be models for the wider expansion of the WHITIA network throughout the clinics in need in urban and rural Guatemala. The system's specific design for Guatemala City is an integration of some of WHITIA's partners' strengths and generosity:

* [[SEDECAL]] provides the X-ray generator and controls
* [[Carestream Health]] donates the [[Photostimulated luminescence|computed radiography]] (CR) digital scanner and plates
* [[Kane X-ray]] donates personnel to perform installation and set up of the CR and [[Picture archiving and communication system|PACS]]

This project was largely funded by several US and Guatemalan [[Rotary International|Rotary clubs]] along with the key resource support of the Guatemalan municipal and national governments.&lt;ref name="GUATE11"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 2011-01-09 | url = http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110104006502/en/WHITIA-Announces-Completion-Digital-X-ray-Pilot-Sites | title = WHITIA Announces the Completion of Digital X-ray Pilot Sites in Urban and Rural Guatemala | publisher= Business Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt;
