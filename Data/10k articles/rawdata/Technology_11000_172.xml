The '''Turbo-Cat''' was a jet [[aircraft catapult]] launch system powered by six jet engines. It was invented by Don Doolittle, and manufactured by the [[All American Engineering]] Co. of [[Wilmington, Delaware]], USA. Six [[Allison J33]] engines in a [[capstan (nautical)|capstan]] arrangement provided 50,000 horsepower directly to the launching cable.
It was developed for expeditionary use by the U.S. Marine Corps, and it was to be air transportable.

Six jet engines are arranged in a circle with the exhausts facing the center where the mass flow of hot exhaust gasses is vented through a diffuser into a pair of large launching turbines. The launching turbines are connected by a main shaft to a cable drum from which an endless tensioned cable shunts underground to a launching track. Then down the track and around a pulley and back to the cable drum. By diverting the flow of exhaust gasses into a launching turbine, the cable drum and its tensioned cable can be accelerated to very high speeds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2723">An '''arc fault''' is a high power discharge of electricity between two or more conductors.  This discharge translates into heat, which can break down the wire's insulation and possibly trigger an electrical fire. These arc faults can range in power from a few amps up to thousands of amps high and are highly variable in terms of strength and duration. Common causes of arc faults include faulty connections due to corrosion and faulty initial installation.

== Location and detection ==
Two types of wiring protection are standard thermal breakers and [[ Arc-fault circuit interrupter|arc fault circuit breakers]]. Thermal breakers require an overload condition long enough that a heating element in the breaker trips the breaker off. In contrast, arc fault circuit breakers use magnetic or other means to detect increases in current draw much more quickly. Without such protection, visually detecting arc faults in defective wiring is very difficult, as the arc fault occurs in a very small area. A problem with arc fault circuit breaker is they are more likely to produce false positives due to normal circuit behaviors appearing to be arc faults. For instance, lightning strikes on the outside of an aircraft mimic arc faults in their voltage and current profiles. Research has been able to largely eliminate such false positives, however, providing the ability to quickly identify and locate repairs that need to be done.&lt;ref&gt;Stephenson, James, Ph.D. "[http://livewiretest.com/eliminating-false-positives-in-the-detection-and-location-of-sub-3ms-faults-on-acdc-lines/ Eliminating False Positives in the Detection and Location of sub 3ms Faults on AC/DC Lines]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}" presented at the 2011 Aircraft Airworthiness &amp; Sustainment Conference on April 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In simple wiring systems visual inspection can lead to finding the fault location, but in complex wiring systems, for instance aircraft wiring, devices such as a [[time-domain reflectometer]] are helpful, even on live wires.&lt;ref&gt;Smith,Paul, Furse, Cynthia and Gunther, Jacob.

In [[multifunction printer|multifunction or all-in-one printers]], [[fax machine]]s, [[photocopier]]s and [[Image scanner|scanner]]s, an '''automatic document feeder''' or '''ADF''' is a feature which takes several pages and feeds the paper one page at a time into a scanner or copier,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techterms.com/definition/adf Automatic Document Feeders]. Techterms.Com. Accessed 2010-May-10.&lt;/ref&gt; allowing the user to [[Image scanning|scan]], and thereby [[photocopying|copy]], [[printing|print]], or [[fax]], multiple-page documents without having to manually replace each page.

Most copiers allow scanning on the flatbed or platen (the "glass") or through a document feeder. The vast majority of fax machines have an ADF, allowing the unattended sending of multi-page faxes. Due to the ubiquity of ADF in fax machines, some fax machine owners use the fax machine as a scanner, faxing multi-page documents to themselves. Document feeders are described by speed, in pages per minute or ppm, and capacity, usually in a range from 10 sheets to 200.

There are two kinds of document feeders capable of two-sided (duplex) scanning: a '''reversing automatic document feeder''' or '''RADF''' scans one side of a page, then flips it and scans the other side. A '''duplexing automatic document feeder''' or '''DADF''' scans both sides in one pass. The advantage of the DADF is faster speed for two-sided originals. RADFs and DADFs are rated in images per minute (IPM), the number of sides they can scan each minute; this may depend upon the resolution being used (rather than the maximum resolution supported).

'''Background debug mode''' ('''BDM''') interface is an electronic interface that allows [[debugging]] of [[embedded system]]s. Specifically, it provides [[in-circuit emulator|in-circuit debugging]] functionality in microcontrollers. It requires a single wire and specialized electronics in the system being debugged.
It appears in many [[Freescale Semiconductor]] products.

The interface allows a ''Host'' to manage and query a ''target''. Specialized hardware is required in the target device. No special hardware is required in the host; a simple bidirectional [[I/O port|I/O pin]] is sufficient.

== I/O signals ==

The signals used by BDM to communicate data to and from the target are initiated by the host processor. The host negates the transmission line, and then either

* [[wiktionary:asserts|Asserts]] the line sooner, to output a 1,
* Asserts the line later, to output a 0,
* [[Three-state logic|Tri-states]] its output, allowing the target to drive the line. The host can sense a 1 or 0 as an input value.

At the start of the next bit time, the host negates the transmission line, and the process repeats. Each bit is communicated in this manner.

In other words, the increasing complexity of today’s software and hardware designs is leading to some fresh approaches to debugging. ''Silicon manufacturers offer more and more on-chip debugging features for emulation of new processors''.

This capability, implemented in various processors under such names as background debug mode (BDM), [[Joint Test Action Group|JTAG]] and on-chip [[In-circuit emulator|in-circuit emulation]], puts basic debugging functions on the chip itself. With a BDM (1 wire interface) or JTAG (standard JTAG) [[debug port]], you control and monitor the microcontroller solely through the stable on-chip debugging services.

This debugging mode runs even when the target system crashes and enables developers to continue investigating the cause of the crash.

==Microcontroller application development==

A good development tool environment is important to reduce total development time and cost. Users want to debug their application program under conditions that imitate the actual setup of their system. Because of that, the capability to debug a user program in an actual target system is required. This is known as [[in-circuit emulator|in-circuit debugging]]. Furthermore, most new MCUs have nonvolatile memory such as [[flash memory]] so that programming code on the target system is also required. This is known as [[In-system programming|in-circuit programming]].

To support in-circuit debugging and programming requirements, the HC08 Family has the monitor mode and the HCS08 and RS08 utilize a background debug mode (BDM). The background debug hardware on the HCS08 consists of a background debug controller (BDC) and debug module (DBG). The background debug hardware on the RS08 consists of the background debug controller (BDC) only.

== BDM commands ==

The BDM host can issue commands with parameters to the target. Some commands allow reading or writing of blocks of the target's memory, individual registers in the CPU, or registers not available to the target.

Examples include:

{| class="wikitable"
|+ BDM commands
|-
| &lt;code&gt;READ_BYTE&lt;/code&gt; || Read a byte from memory 
|-
| &lt;code&gt;WRITE_BYTE&lt;/code&gt; || Write a byte to memory
|-
| &lt;code&gt;GO&lt;/code&gt; || Start/resume executing at current program counter location
|-
| &lt;code&gt;WRITE_PC&lt;/code&gt; || Write a value to the program counter
|-
| &lt;code&gt;READ_PC&lt;/code&gt; || Read the value of the program counter
|-
| &lt;code&gt;WRITE_X&lt;/code&gt; || Write a value to the index register
|-
| &lt;code&gt;READ_X&lt;/code&gt; || Read the value of the index register
|-
| &lt;code&gt;READ_SP&lt;/code&gt; || Read the value of the stack pointer
|}

== BDM functions ==
Depending on the target part, the BDM controller may feature a hardware [[breakpoint]] register. The register holds a value indicating an [[memory address|address]] in memory. When the target part's CPU accesses that location in memory, the BDM hardware can take control of the target part, stop program execution, and begin operating in background mode.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4018">[[File:Carcinotron jamming a pulse radar unit.png|thumb|This image shows the effect of four carcinotron-carrying aircraft on a typical 1950s early warning radar. The aircraft are located at the 4 and 6 o'clock positions, which are completely filled with noise.]]

'''Barrage jamming''' is an  [[electronic warfare]] technique that attempts to blind [[radar]] systems by filling the display with noise, rendering the broadcaster's ''blip'' invisible on the display, and often those in the nearby area as well. "Barrage" refers to systems that send signals in many [[band (radio)|band]]s of frequencies compared to the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of any single radar. This allows the jammer to jam multiple radars at once, and reduces or eliminates the need for adjustments to respond to any single radar.

Early radar systems typically operated on a single frequency, and could only change that frequency by changing internal electronics. Against these radars, it was possible to use conventional radio sets to send out signals on the same band, causing the radar display to be filled with noise whenever the antenna was pointed in the general direction of the jammer. However, given that each individual radar would be operating on different frequencies, this "[[spot jamming]]" technique required multiple radio sets in order to jam more than one radar at a time, and true wide-band barrage jamming was very difficult.

Early barrage jammers in [[World War II]] used [[photomultiplier]] tubes to amplify a wideband noise source,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://psec.uchicago.edu/links/Photomultiplier_Handbook.pdf |title=Photomultiplier Handbook}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the technique became practical with the introduction of the [[carcinotron]] in the early 1950s, a [[vacuum tube]] that generates [[microwave]]s who's frequency can be adjusted across a very wide band simply by changing the input voltage. A single carcinotron could be swept through the entire bandwidth of any potential radar network, jamming all of the radars in such rapid sequence that it appeared to be constant noise on all frequencies at all times. A downside to this approach is that the signal only spends a brief period of time at any one radar's frequency; depending on the scanning rate, the radar may only be jammed during certain periods, but if the rate is increased to offset this, the amount of noise in any one pulse period is reduced. More complex jammers can scan only the bands it sees being used, improving its effectiveness.

Barrage jamming was extremely effective against 1950s radars, to the point where there was some belief that the carcinotron might render ground-based radars useless, especially in the [[early warning radar]] role. By the 1960s a number of techniques had been introduced to combat barrage jamming. [[Frequency agile]] radars, which change their frequency from pulse to pulse, force the jammer spread its signal across the entire bandwidth, ensuring the signal is diluted. Combining this with extremely powerful signals and highly focused antennas allowed new radars to overpower the jammers, "burning through" the jamming. Simple techniques, like turning off the receivers when the antenna was pointed close to the jammer, allowed the radar to continue tracking other targets. The use of [[phased array]] antennas and signal processing techniques that reduced sidelobes also improved performance.

Barrage jammers also have the disadvantage that they are very easy to detect using a wideband receiver. This can be used to track the jammer using a variety of techniques. A well developed instance of this was deployed by the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] in their [[RX12874]] network, which could track jammer-carrying aircraft with accuracy equal to a radar. More generally, a barrage jammer's signal is so easy to receive that it makes an excellent early warning signal on its own.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was an early attempt to develop a standardized high-level computer programming language intended to improve code portability and reusability. CMS-2 was developed primarily for the US Navy’s tactical data systems ([[Naval Tactical Data System|NTDS]]).&lt;ref name=NAVEDTRA_10088-B /&gt;

CMS-2 was developed by [[RAND Corporation]] in the early 1970s and stands for "Compiler Monitor System". The name "CMS-2" is followed in literature by a letter designating the type of target system. For example, CMS-2M targets Navy 16-bit processors, such as the [[AN/AYK-14]].&lt;ref name=Ziring/&gt;

==History==
CMS-2 was developed for FCPCPAC (Fleet Computer Programming Center - Pacific) in San Diego, CA.  It was implemented by [[Computer Sciences Corporation]] in 1968 with design assistance from [[Intermetrics]].  The language continued to be developed, eventually supporting a number of computers including the [[AN/UYK-7]] and [[AN/UYK-43]] and UYK-20 and UYK-44 &lt;ref&gt;Mark Wilson - personal experience working with UYK-20 and UYK-44 on Aegis ORTS&lt;/ref&gt; computers.&lt;ref name=CM2Y-Manual&gt;{{citation

==Language features==
CMS-2 was designed to encourage program modularization, permitting independent compilation of portions of a total system. The language is statement oriented. The source is free-form and may be arranged for programming convenience. Data types include fixed-point, floating-point, boolean, character and status. Direct reference to, and manipulation of character and bit strings is permitted. Symbolic machine code may be included, known as direct code.&lt;ref name=NAVEDTRA_10088-B /&gt;

==Program structure==
[[File:CMS-2_compile_time_system_structure_example.jpg|thumb|right|CMS-2 compile time system example]]
A CMS-2 program is composed of statements. Statements are made up of symbols separated by delimiters. The categories of symbols include operators, identifiers, and constants. The operators are language primitives assigned by the compiler for specific operations or definitions in a program. Identifiers are unique names assigned by the programmer to data units, program elements and statement labels. Constants are known values that may be numeric, Hollerith strings, status values or Boolean.

CMS-2 statements are free form and terminated by a dollar sign. A statement label may be placed at the beginning of a statement for reference purposes.

A CMS-2 source program is composed of two basic types of statement. Declarative statements provide basic control information to the compiler and define the structure of the data associated with a particular program. Dynamic statements cause the compiler to generate executable machine instructions (object code).

Declarative statements defining the data for a program are grouped into units called data designs. Data designs consist of precise definitions for temporary and permanent data storage areas, input areas, output areas and special data units. The dynamic statements that act on data or perform calculations are grouped into procedures. Data designs and procedures are further grouped to form system elements of a CMS-2 program. The compiler combines system elements into a compile time system. A compile time system may stand alone or be part of a larger program.&lt;ref name=NAVEDTRA_10088-B /&gt;

==Data declarative statements==
Data declarative statements provide the compiler with information about data element definitions. They define the format, structure and order of data elements in a compile-time system. The three major kinds of data are switches, variables and aggregates.&lt;ref name=NAVEDTRA_10088-B /&gt;

===Switches===
Switches provide for the transfer of program control to a specific location in a compile-time system. They contain a set of identifiers or switch points to facilitate program transfers and branches. The switch represents a program address of a statement label or procedure name.

===Variables===
A variable is a single piece of data. It may consist of one bit, multiple bits or words. A value may be assigned in the variable definition. Variables may hold a constant or changing value. Data types include integers, fix point, floating point, Hollerith character strings, status or Booleans.

===Aggregates===
Tables hold ordered sets of identically structured information. The common unit of data in a table is an item. Items may be subdivided into fields, the smallest subdivision of a table. Allowable data types contained in fields include integer, fixed point, floating point, Hollerith character string, status or Boolean. An array is an extension of the table concept. The basic structural unit of an array is an item. Array items contain fields as defined by the programmer.

==Dynamic statements==
Dynamic statements specify processing operations and result in executable code generation by the compiler. A dynamic statement consists of an operator followed by a list of operands and additional operators. An operand may be a single name, a constant, a data-element reference or an expression.&lt;ref name=NAVEDTRA_10088-B /&gt;

===Statement operators===
Major CMS-2 operators are summarized below.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Operator !! Function
|-
| SET || Perform calculations or assign a value
|-
| SWAP || Exchange the contents of two data units
|-
| GOTO || Alter program flow or call a statement switch
|-
| IF || Expresses a comparison or boolean expression for conditional execution
|-
| VARY || Establish a program loop
|-
| FIND || Searches a table for data
|}

===Special operators===
Special operators facilitate references to data structures and operations on them.&lt;ref name=NAVEDTRA_10088-B /&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Operator !! Function
|-
| BIT || Reference a string of bits in a data element
|-
| CHAR || References a character string
|-
| CORAD || References a core address
|-
| ABS || Obtains the absolute value of an expression
|-
| COMP || Complements a Boolean expression
|}

==Program structure declarations==
The dynamic statements that describe the processing operations of a program are grouped into [[blocks of statements]] called procedures.&lt;ref name=NAVEDTRA_10088-B /&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Beginning delimiter !! End delimiter !! Purpose
|-
| SYSTEM || END-SYSTEM || Delimits a compile time system
|-
| SYS-DD || END-SYS-DD || Delimits a system data design in a compiled system
|-

|-
| LOC-DD || END-LOC-DD || Delimits a local data design in a system procedure
|-
| PROCEDURE || END-PROC || Delimits a procedure in a system procedure
|-
| EXEC-PROC || END-PROC || Delimits a task-state procedure in a system procedure (XCMS-2 only, only called from an executive-state procedure) 
|-
| FUNCTION || {{nowrap|END-FUNCTION}} || Delimits a function in a system procedure
|-
| {{nowrap|SYS-PROC-REN}} || END-SYS-PROC || Delimits a reentrant system procedure in a compile-time system (XCMS-2 only)
|-
| AUTO-DD || END-AUTO-DD || Delimits the dynamic data area in a reentrant system procedure that must be allocated each time the reentrant system procedure is initiated for execution (XCMS-2 only) 
|-
| HEAD || END-HEAD || Delimits a header package in a compile-time system
|}

==High level input/output statements==
Input/output statements provide communication with hardware devices while running in a non-realtime environment under a monitor system.&lt;ref name=NAVEDTRA_10088-B /&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Operator !! Function
|-
| FILE || Defines the environment and other information for input and output
|-
| OPEN || Initializes I/O routines
|-
| CLOSE || Deactivates a file and writes and end-of-file mark
|-
| INPUT || Directs an input operation from an external device to a file buffer area
|-
| OUTPUT || Directs an output operation from a file buffer area to an external device
|-
| FORMAT || Defines the desired conversion between external data blocks and internal data definitions
|-
| ENCODE || Directs transformation of data elements into a common area, with conversion in accordance with a specified format
|-
| DECODE || Directs unpacking of a common area and transmittal to data units as specified by a format declaration
|-
| ENDFILE || Places an end-of-file mark on appropriate recording mediums
|-
| POS || Special operator to position a magnetic tape file
|-

|}

==Compiler Monitor System 2 (CMS-2)==
The Compiler Monitor System 2 (CMS-2) was a system that ran on the UNIVAC CP-642B ([[AN/USQ-20]]). The system software included the [[Resident monitor|monitor]], compiler, librarian, CP-642 Loader, tape utility and flow charter.&lt;ref name=NAVEDTRA_10088-B /&gt;

===MS-2 monitor===

A batch processing operating system that controls execution of CMS-2 components and user jobs run on the CP-642 computer. It provides input/output, software library facilities and debugging tools. Job accounting is also provided.

===CMS-2 compiler===

A compiler for the CS-1 and CMS-2 languages that generates object code for the [[AN/USQ-20|CP-642]], L-304, [[AN/UYK-7]], 1830A and [[UNIVAC 418#UNIVAC 1218 Military Computer|1218]]/1219 computers. During the 1970s there were different versions of the CMS-2 compiler, depending on which computer was used to compile the code. Some source code had to be rewritten to work around some functions. And the different versions of CMS-2 had problems with the debugging tools.

===XCMS-2 compiler===

An extended CMS-2 compiler, adding language features for the AN/UYK-7 computer. It only generates AN/UYK-7 object code.

===CMS-2 librarian===

A file management system that provides storage and access to source and object code.

===CP-642 Object code loaders===

Two object code loaders for loading absolute or relocatable object code.

===Tape utility===

A set of utilities for managing data on magnetic tape.

===CMS-2 flowcharter===

The flowcharter software processes flowcharter statements in CMS-2 source code and outputs a flowchart to a high-speed printer.

This solution combines the company’s proprietary human genome sequencing technology with its informatics and data management software to provide finished variant reports and assemblies at Complete Genomics’ own commercial genome center in [[Mountain View, California]]. In March 2013 Complete Genomics was acquired by [[Beijing Genomics Institute|BGI-Shenzhen]], a genomics services company in [[Shenzhen]], [[Guangdong]], China.&lt;ref&gt;Specter, Michael (6 January 2014) [http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/01/06/the-gene-factory The Gene Factory] The New Yorker, Retrieved 28 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Complete Genomics was founded in March 2006 by Clifford Reid, Radoje (Rade) Drmanac, and John Curson. Clifford Reid was the chairman, president and chief executive officer of Complete Genomics.

In February 2009, Complete Genomics announced that it had sequenced its first human [[genome]] and submitted the resulting variant data to the [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] database. Then, in November 2009, Complete Genomics published sequence data for three human genomes in the journal [[Science (journal)|Science]].&lt;ref name="Drmanac2009"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Drmanac R |date=November 2009 |title=Human genome sequencing using unchained base reads on self-assembling DNA nanoarrays |journal=Science |volume=327 |issue=5961 |pages=78–81 |doi=10.1126/science.1181498 |pmid=19892942|bibcode = 2010Sci...327...78D |last2=Sparks |first2=A.

'''Conrad Heyer''' (1749–1856) was an [[United States|American]] farmer and veteran of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] who is notable for possibly being the earliest-born American to have been [[History of photography|photographed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schultz|first1=Colin|title=Conrad Heyer, a Revolutionary War Veteran, Was the Earliest-Born American To Ever Be Photographed|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/conrad-heyer-a-revolutionary-war-veteran-was-the-earliest-born-american-to-ever-be-photographed-180947660/|accessdate=15 August 2015|date=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

Heyer was born in the village of [[Waldoboro]], [[Maine]], then known as "Broad Bay" and part of the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]]. The settlement had been [[Northeast Coast Campaign (1746)|sacked and depopulated]] by [[Wabanaki Confederacy|Wabanaki]] attacks and resettled with [[German Americans|German immigrants]] recruited from the [[Rhineland]]. Among these settlers were the parents of Conrad Heyer, who also may have been the [[first white child]] born in the settlement.&lt;ref name="New Market Press"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newmarketpressvt.com/news/2013/jul/25/new-england-man-had-oldest-birth-date-ever-be-phot/|title=New England man had oldest birth date ever to be photographed|accessdate=18 October 2015|author=New Market Press|date=25 July 2013|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131117201704/http://www.newmarketpressvt.com/news/2013/jul/25/new-england-man-had-oldest-birth-date-ever-be-phot/|archivedate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[American Revolution]], Heyer fought for the [[Continental Army]] under the command of [[George Washington]] and participated in Washington's famous [[Washington's crossing of the Delaware|crossing of the Delaware]] before the [[Battle of Trenton]] in December 1776.&lt;ref name="New Market Press" /&gt; He was discharged in December 1777.&lt;ref name="Maine HS"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mainememory.net/artifact/13423|title=Conrad Heyer, Waldoboro, ca. 1852|accessdate=12 April 2018|author=Maine Historical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, he returned to Waldoboro, where he made a living as a farmer until his death in 1856. He was buried with full military honors.&lt;ref name="Maine HS" /&gt;

In 1852, at the age of 103, Heyer posed for a [[daguerreotype]] portrait. He thereby became the earliest-born person of whom a photograph is known to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Frank|first1=Priscilla|title=This Is Conrad Hayer, A Man Who Made Photographic History At 103 Years Old|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/27/oldest-person-photographe_n_5366765.html|accessdate=15 August 2015|date=2014-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The claim is not without dispute, as the following men were also photographed: a shoemaker named John Adams, who claimed to be born in 1745; a Revolutionary War veteran named Baltus Stone, with a claim of 1744; and a slave named Caesar, with a claim of 1738.&lt;ref name="First photo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://benbeck.co.uk/firsts/2_The_Human_Subject/photo1h.htm|title=First photo|accessdate=12 April 2018|last1=Beck|first1=Benjamin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Ron Karger''' (born May 1, 1967) is a professor of computer science and a member of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory ([[CSAIL]]) at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].

==Education==
Karger received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from [[Harvard University]] and a PhD in [[computer science]] from [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David Karger CSAIL|url=http://www.csail.mit.edu/user/1542|accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Karger's work in algorithms has focused on applications of randomization to optimization problems and led to significant progress on several core problems. He is responsible for [[Karger's algorithm]], a [[Monte Carlo method]] to compute the [[minimum cut]] of a connected graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Karger|first=David|title=Global Min-cuts in RNC and Other Ramifications of a Simple Mincut Algorithm|url=http://people.csail.mit.edu/karger/Papers/mincut.ps|publisher=Proceedings of the 4th Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, January 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karger developed the fastest [[minimum spanning tree]] algorithm to date, with Philip Klein and [[Robert Tarjan]]. They found a [[linear time]] [[randomized algorithm]] based on a combination of Borůvka's algorithm and the reverse-delete algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Karger | first1 = D. R. | last2 = Klein | first2 = P. N. | last3 = Tarjan | first3 = R.

Karger has conducted research in the area of [[information retrieval]] and [[personal information management]]. This work has focused on new interfaces and algorithms for helping people sift effectively through large masses of information. While at [[PARC (company)|Xerox PARC]], he worked on the Scatter/Gather system, which hierarchically clustered a document collection and allow the user to gather clusters at different levels and rescatter them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Cutting | first1 = D.

David Karger is also part of Confer: a tool for conference attendees used by many research conferences.

==Awards==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
Karger's dissertation received the 1994 [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] doctoral dissertation award and the [[Mathematical Programming Society]]'s 1997 Tucker Prize. He also received the [[National Academy of Science]]'s 2004 Award for Initiative in Research.

==Personal==
Karger is married to [[Allegra Goodman]], an American author. The couple live in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] and have four children, three boys and a girl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Allegra |url=http://www.allegragoodman.com/goodman-biography.htm |accessdate=13 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624093715/http://www.allegragoodman.com/goodman-biography.htm |archivedate=24 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Doom9''' is a [[website]] featuring information on digital [[digital audio|audio]] and [[digital video|video]] manipulation (mostly video) and digital copyrights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ganesh|first1=TS|title=Intel's Ivy Bridge: A HTPC Perspective|url=https://www.anandtech.com/show/5773/intels-ivy-bridge-an-htpc-perspective|accessdate=22 November 2017|publisher=Anandtech|date=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the [[internet forum|forum]] [[screen name (computing)|username]] of the author of the page, an [[Austria]]n who was a college student at the time of the creation of the site. The site's [[tagline]] is "The Definitive DVD Backup Resource".

Started in March 2000, the site has expanded to contain a wide range of information on the subject of digital video encoding and [[DVD]] backup (or [[ripping]]).&lt;ref name='coded'&gt;{{cite news|last1=Woodward|first1=Matt|title=7 codec round-up at Doom9|url=https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2003/05/305-2/|accessdate=22 November 2017|publisher=Ars Technica|date=5 May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cat and Mouse Copy Protection|journal=Maximum PC|date=May 2007|pages=27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PQIAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA27&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;dq=doom9&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NM_Y9DeZER&amp;sig=n9rV_ZzrH-0M-28UYbm0xQlLiTY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiYqbnQpdPXAhVK0oMKHTtRAwA4HhDoAQgyMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=doom9&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most popular sections of the site were the guides to DVD ripping and the annual codec comparisons, where popular digital video [[codec]]s were compared on the basis of quality, speed, and compression.&lt;ref name='coded' /&gt; The forum is frequented by many developers of the tools and codecs featured on the site,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kirk|first1=Jeremy|title=Hacker strips DRM from streaming Netflix movies|url=https://www.macworld.com/article/1059410/netflix.html|accessdate=22 November 2017|publisher=MacWorld|date=9 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Windows Media DRM#Removal|FairUse4WM]]. The site has been criticized, as the techniques described by it can be used for [[copyright infringement]], but it maintains that its guides should only be used for [[fair use]]. In some cases, users suspected of illegally copying media are refused help on the forums.{{Cn|date=October 2018}}

The [[VirtualDubMod]] project began after many modifications to [[VirtualDub]] were posted on the Doom9 forums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buechler|first1=Georgios Diamantopoulos, Sohail Salehi, John|title=Learning VirtualDub the complete guide to capturing, processing, and encoding digital video|date=2005|publisher=Packt Pub.|location=Birmingham, UK|isbn=9781847190246|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=apiArMc8t9MC&amp;pg=PT42&amp;lpg=PT42&amp;dq=VirtualDubMod+project+doom9&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=z59Ar4NtBA&amp;sig=B3qtl8OvCQhCaR7voUZ69bnCO44&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjE_7mJptPXAhWJyoMKHV30AXQQ6AEIQjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=VirtualDubMod%20project%20doom9&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doom9 gained notoriety as a result of its involvement in the [[AACS encryption key controversy]]. The utility [[BackupHDDVD]] was first posted by a Doom9 poster using the alias ''muslix64''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McMillian|first1=Robert|title=Hacker: Blu-ray, HD DVD copy protection cracked|url=https://www.infoworld.com/article/2659617/security/hacker--blu-ray--hd-dvd-copy-protection-cracked.html|accessdate=22 November 2017|publisher=Info World|date=29 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest information on how to find title and volume keys was also first revealed on Doom9 forums, by other users. The key that set off the controversy was also first posted by a user using the name ''arnezami''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=REIMER|first1=Jeremy|title=Crack in Blu-ray, HD DVD encryption gets wider|url=https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2007/02/8837/|accessdate=22 November 2017|publisher=Ars Technica|date=13 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doom9 is also known for being the main discussion forum for many major video encoding tools, such as [[x264]], [[AviSynth]] and [[MeGUI]].

== Projects ==
Due to the concentration of forum members who have technical backgrounds, there have been various software projects developed and maintained by forum members. These include:
*[[Media Player Classic Home Cinema]], a lightweight media player using the [[DirectShow]] API
*[[ffdshow-tryouts]], a collection of free software codecs, most notably [[libavcodec]], provided as DirectShow filters

Doom9 members have also contributed significantly to various software projects, including:
*[[x264]], a free software H.264 video encoder
*[[VirtualDubMod]], a video capture and linear editing tool

The '''Enterprise Bus Matrix''' is a [[data Warehouse]] planning tool and model created by [[Ralph Kimball]], and is part of the Data Warehouse Bus Architecture. The Matrix is the logical definition of one of the core concepts of Kimball’s approach to Dimensional Modeling – Conformed dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kimballgroup.com/2003/09/15/design-tip-49-off-the-bench/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130216080251/http://www.kimballgroup.com/2003/09/15/design-tip-49-off-the-bench/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-02-16 |title=Design Tip #49: Off The Bench |publisher=Kimball Group |date=2003-09-15 |accessdate=2015-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bus Matrix defines part of the Data Warehouse Bus Architecture and is an output of the Business Requirements phase in [[The Kimball Lifecycle]]. It is applied in the following phases of [[dimensional modeling]] and development of the Data Warehouse . The matrix can be categorized as a hybrid model, being part technical design tool, part project management tool and part communication tool&lt;ref name="Kimball"&gt;Kimball, Ralph &amp; Ross, Margy; The Data Warehouse Toolkit: The Complete Guide to Dimensional Modeling, 2nd Edition John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Enterprise Bus Matrix stems from the issue of how one goes about creating the overall Data Warehouse environment.  Historically there has been the structure of the centralized and planned approach and the more loosely defined, department specific, solutions developed in a more independent matter. Autonomous projects can result in a range of isolated stove pipe data marts. Naturally each approach has its issues; the overall visionary approach often struggles with long delivery cycles and lack of reaction time as the formalities and scope issues is evident. On the other hand, the development of isolated data marts, leading to [[Stovepipe system]]s that lacks synergy in development. Over time this approach will lead to a so-called data-mart-in-a-box architecture&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mimno.com/avoiding-mistakes3.html#6]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704220014/http://www.mimno.com/avoiding-mistakes3.html#6 |date=July 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where [[interoperability]] and lack of cohesion is apparent, and can hinder the realization of an overall enterprise Data Warehouse. As an attempt to handle this matter [[Ralph Kimball]] introduced the enterprise bus.

==Bus matrix==
The bus matrix purpose is one of high abstraction and visionary planning on the Data Warehouse architectural level. By dictating coherency in the development and implementation of an overall Data Warehouse the Bus Architecture approach enables an overall vision of the broader enterprise integration and consistency while at the same time dividing the problem into more manageable parts&lt;ref name="Kimball" /&gt; – all in a technology and software independent manner .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b-eye-network.com/view/713 |title=Data Warehouse: Ralph Kimball’s Vision by Katherine Drewek |publisher=Beyenetwork |date=2005-03-16 |accessdate=2015-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bus matrix and architecture builds upon the concept of conformed dimensions -  creating a structure of common dimensions that ideally can be used across the enterprise by all business processes related to the DW and the corresponding fact tables from which they derive their context. According to Kimball and Margy Ross's article  “Differences of Opinion”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intelligent-enterprise.informationweek.com/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=0OVJNEHMPRXGRQE1GHRSKH4ATMY32JVN?articleID=17800088 |title=Enterprise Software News, Analysis, &amp; Advice - InformationWeek |publisher=Intelligent-enterprise.informationweek.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; "''The Enterprise Data warehouse built on the bus architecture ”identifies and enforces the relationship between business process metrics (facts) and descriptive attributes (dimensions)''”.

The concept of a [[Bus (computing)|bus]] is well known in the language of [[Information Technology]], and is what reflects the conformed dimension concept in the Data Warehouse, creating the skeletal structure where all parts of a system connect, ensuring [[interoperability]] and consistency of data, and at the same time considers future expansion. This makes the conformed dimensions act as the integration ‘glue’, creating a robust backbone of the enterprise Data Warehouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intelligent-enterprise.informationweek.com/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=GMS3H4SOBFQBBQE1GHOSKH4ATMY32JVN?articleID=17800088&amp;pgno=2 |title=Enterprise Software News, Analysis, &amp; Advice - InformationWeek |publisher=Intelligent-enterprise.informationweek.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the vertical columns the groups of contextual data is found as the common, conformed dimensions.

In this way the shared dimensions are defined, as each process indicates what dimensions it applies to through the cells figure 2.&lt;ref name="Kimball" /&gt; By this definition and coordination of conformed dimensions and processes the development of the overall data DW bus architecture is realized.&lt;ref name="Kimball" /&gt; The matrix identifies the shared dimensions related to processes and fact tables, and can be a tool for planning, prioritizing what needs to be approached, coordinating implementation and communicating the importance for conformed dimensions .

[[File:Environmental chamber.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Example of a temperature/humidity chamber]]
An '''environmental chamber''', also called a '''climatic chamber''' or '''climate chamber''', is an enclosure used to test the effects of specified environmental conditions on biological items, industrial products, materials, and electronic devices and components.

Such a chamber can be used:
# as a stand-alone test for environmental effects on test [[Biological specimen|specimen]]s
# as preparation of test specimens for further [[physical test]]s or [[chemical test]]s
# as environmental conditions for conducting testing of specimens

== Overview ==
[[File:Salt spray chamber.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Chamber for salt spray]]
[[File:Applications Technology Satellite Testing - GPN-2000-001264.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Large NASA [[vacuum chamber]]]]
An environmental test chamber artificially replicates conditions which machinery, materials, devices or components might be exposed to. It is also used to accelerate the effects of exposure to the environment, sometimes at conditions not actually expected.

Chamber testing involves testing and exposing products to various environmental conditions in a controlled setting. Climatic Chamber testing and Thermal Shock testing are part of chamber testing. Climatic Chamber testing is a broad term used to describe different ways of simulating climate or excessive ambient conditions exposure for a product or a material under laboratory controlled yet accelerated conditions. On the other hand, Thermal Shock testing is used to simulate how materials will react when exposed to changes in extreme climatic conditions, such as going from extremely cold to extremely hot conditions in a very short period of time (usually only few seconds). 

These conditions may include:
* extreme temperatures
* sudden and extreme temperature variations - thermal shock
* [[altitude]]
* moisture or [[relative humidity]]
* electrodynamic [[vibration]]s
* electromagnetic radiation
* [[Cyclic corrosion testing]]
* [[Salt spray test|salt spray]]
* [[rain]]
* [[weathering]]
* exposure to sun, causing [[UV degradation]]
* [[vacuum]]

Manufactured samples, specimens, or components are placed inside the chamber and subjected to one or more of these environmental parameters to determine reliability or measure after-effects such as corrosion.  In the case of machinery such as internal combustion engines, byproducts such as emissions are monitored.

An environmental chamber can be a small room used both to condition test [[Biological specimen|specimen]]s and to conduct the test.  It can be a smaller unit that's used for conditioning test items.  Also, some chambers are small enough to be placed onto a [[universal testing machine]] or other test apparatus.

Many chambers are set at a certain set of conditions.  Others can be programmed to cycle through specified sequences of conditions.

== Design ==

As test requirements may be relatively simple or complex, environmental test chambers vary widely in size, ranging from small units designed for placement on bench tops to large walk-in chambers.  Test chambers generally have viewports or video feeds to allow for visual inspection of the sample during the test.  Reach-in chambers provide an opening that technicians may use to handle test samples.  Chambers providing interior visual lighting must take into account the heat generated and compensate accordingly.

As with the wide variance in size, a number of user control options are available, ranging from simple analog indicators up to more modern digital readouts with LCD displays.  Chambers may be computer programmable, and networked or Web-enabled test chambers are also available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalspec.com/learnmore/labware_test_measurement/product_material_testing/environmental_test_chambers] Brief primer on environmental test chambers and rooms from GlobalSpec.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of test chambers ==
* Mechanically cooled test chambers
* [[Liquid nitrogen]] cooled test chambers

The [[Grumman]] F-14 Tomcat has served with the [[United States Navy]] and the [[Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force]] (IRIAF)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/persian-cats-9242012/ Persian Cats How Iranian air crews, cut off from U.S. technical support, used the F-14 against Iraqi attackers]&lt;/ref&gt; It operated aboard U.S. [[aircraft carrier]]s from 1974 to 2006 and remains in service with [[Iran]]. In-depth knowledge of its service with Iran is relatively limited.

==U.S. Navy service==
The F-14 primarily conducted air-to-air and reconnaissance missions with the U.S. Navy until the 1990s, when it was also employed as a long-range [[strike fighter]].&lt;ref name="USN2000"&gt;[http://www.navy.mil/navydata/policy/vision/vis00/v00-ch3b.html#Air "U.S. Navy 2000 Program Guide."] U.S. Navy. Retrieved: 5 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It saw considerable action in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and [[Persian Gulf]] and was used as a strike platform in the [[Balkans]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]] until its final deployment with the [[United States]] in 2006.

===American withdrawal from Saigon (1975)===
{{Main|Operation Frequent Wind}}
The Tomcat made its combat debut during [[Operation Frequent Wind]], the evacuation of American citizens from [[Ho Chi Minh City|Saigon]], in April 1975. F-14As from [[VF-1|Fighter Squadron 1]] (VF-1) and [[VF-2]], operating from the {{USS|Enterprise|CVAN-65}}, flew [[combat air patrol]]s over [[South Vietnam]] to provide fighter cover for the evacuation route.&lt;ref name=Jenkins_p41-2&gt;Jenkins 1997, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cold War intercepts (1976–1991)===
[[File:Tomcat escorts Bear.jpg|thumb|An F-14A Tomcat intercepting a Soviet Tupolev Tu-95RTs Bear D maritime recce aircraft over the Pacific Ocean in 1984]]
[[VF-142]] became the first Atlantic Fleet F-14 squadron to intercept a Soviet [[Tupolev Tu-95|Tu-95 "Bear"]] on 23 April 1976. One of the routine tasks U.S. Navy F-14s performed was intercepting aircraft that approached U.S. carrier groups too closely. [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[strategic bomber]]s and [[maritime patrol aircraft|maritime reconnaissance aircraft]] regularly patrolled near U.S. carriers during the [[Cold War]] and were often escorted away by F-14s. 

F-14 Tomcats were the primary interceptors of Tu-95 Bear D aircraft that flew anywhere in the vicinity of U.S. aircraft carriers during the Cold War. U.S. policy was not to let the Bear D come within several hundred miles of an aircraft carrier without an armed escort. During the height of the Cold War, a pair of Bear D aircraft would fly from the [[Kola peninsula]] to [[Cuba]] every week resulting in frequent intercepts as they passed along the Eastern coast of the United States. During the same time period, annual  [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)]] exercise in the [[North Sea]] area elicited daily flights of Bear D aircraft operating in pairs to locate the aircraft carrier(s) in the area. Operations Northern Wedding and Ocean Safari typically brought at least one U.S. Navy carrier into the [[GIUK gap|Greenland–Iceland–United Kingdom (GIUK) gap]] during the exercise prompting considerable monitoring by Soviet surface ships, submarines, and aircraft. Tomcats were utilized to provide around-the-clock fleet air defense intercepting not only Soviet Bear D aircraft, but also [[Tupolev Tu-16|Tu-16 "Badger"]] maritime strike and [[Myasishchev M-4|M-4 "Bison"]], [[Antonov An-12|An-12 "Cub"]], and [[Ilyushin Il-38|Il-38 "May"]] surveillance aircraft which routinely attempted to target aircraft carrier battle groups.

In 1976 an F-14 operating from the {{USS|John F. Kennedy|CV-67|6}} was lost overboard near [[Scapa Flow]] sinking in water {{convert|1890|ft|m|adj=on}} deep. The U.S. Navy, concerned that the Soviets might recover the wreckage and its [[AIM-54 Phoenix]] missiles, launched an underwater recovery operation costing several million dollars to salvage the wreckage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1977/03/30/navy-f-14-trying-to-land-on-carrier-lost-in-ocean/81ec593e-30e0-4091-987f-6e6b1deaff65/|title=Navy F-14 Trying to Land On Carrier Lost in Ocean|publisher=The Washington Post|date=30 March 1977|accessdate=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military operations directed at Libya (1980–1989)===
{{Main|Gulf of Sidra incident (1981)|Action in the Gulf of Sidra (1986)|Operation El Dorado Canyon|Gulf of Sidra incident (1989)}}
F-14s were involved in multiple U.S. military operations directed at [[Libya]] between 1980 and 1989. During this period, F-14s shot down four [[Libyan Air Force (1951–2011)|Libyan Air Force]] aircraft in two aerial engagements over the Mediterranean Sea.

On 21 September 1980, three F-14s from the ''Kennedy'' challenged eight Libyan fighters attempting to intercept a [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] [[RC-135]] reconnaissance plane two hundred miles from the Libyan coast.&lt;ref name="Stanik_p30"&gt;Stanik 2003, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The Libyans disengaged once confronted by the U.S. fighters.

In the summer of 1981, F-14s from VF-41 and VF-84 performed combat air patrols in support of [[Freedom of Navigation]] operations in the [[Gulf of Sidra]]. Thirty-five pairs of Libyan Air Force fighters and fighter-bombers were intercepted and driven away from the U.S. fleet by F-14s from the {{USS|Nimitz|CVN-68}} and [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|F-4 "Phantom IIs"]] from the {{USS|Forrestal|CV-59}} on the first day of operations. The following day, on 19 August 1981, two Libyan [[Sukhoi Su-17|Su-22 "Fitters"]] opened fire on two VF-41 F-14As with an [[Vympel K-13|AA-2 "Atoll"]] missile. The missile failed to hit either of the F-14s and the American pilots destroyed both Libyan aircraft with [[AIM-9 Sidewinder|AIM-9L "Sidewinder"]] missiles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928055032/http://www.ussbiddle.org/history/fitter_engagement_audio.html "Fitter Engagement."] ''The USS Biddle Association USS Biddle (DLG/CG-34)'', 28 September 2007.

F-14s from VF-14 and VF-32, operating from the USS ''Independence'', flew combat air patrols and reconnaissance missions in support of [[Operation Urgent Fury]], the U.S. invasion of [[Grenada]] in 1983. Tomcats from both squadrons provided fighter cover for Navy attack aircraft. TARPS-equipped F-14s from VF-32 also performed photo-mapping and post-strike damage assessment missions.&lt;ref name="Peacock p.44" /&gt;

===MS ''Achille Lauro'' incident (1985)===
{{Main|Achille Lauro hijacking}}
From 8 to 10 October 1985, F-14s from the {{USS|Saratoga|CV-60}} participated in operations involving the hijacked Italian cruise liner, [[MS Achille Lauro|MS ''Achille Lauro'']]. F-14As from VF-74 and VF-103 performed combat air patrols with the additional task of monitoring activity on the sea around the ''Achille Lauro''.&lt;ref name=Gillcrerst_p142&gt;Gillcrest 1994, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the U.S. [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] devised a plan that involved using the ''Saratoga's'' F-14s to intercept an aircraft that was to carry the hijackers to safety after U.S. intelligence discovered Egyptian authorities were preparing to put the hijackers on an [[EgyptAir]] [[Boeing 737|737]] being flown to [[Tunisia]].&lt;ref name="Martin and Walcott_p244"&gt;Martin and Walcott 1988, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heymann, Philip and Vlad Jenkins.

The F-14s positively identified the correct airliner after four interceptions at night. The Tomcats formed up on the EgyptAir 737 and a U.S. Navy [[Northrop Grumman EA-6B Prowler|EA-6B]] jammed all of the airliner's communications except to the F-14s and E-2C.

===Intervention in the "Tanker War" (1987–1988)===
{{Main|Tanker War|Operation Earnest Will|Operation Nimble Archer|Operation Praying Mantis}}
From July 1987 to September 1988, F-14s performed combat air patrols and escort missions in support of [[Operation Earnest Will]] during the "[[Tanker War]]". On 8 August 1987, the first shots by the U.S. at Iranian forces took place when two [[VF-21]] F-14As from the {{USS|Constellation|CV-64}} opened fire on two Iranian F-4s that flew toward an American [[Lockheed P-3C Orion|P-3C]] reconnaissance plane.&lt;ref name=Zatarain_p88-90-2&gt;Zatarain 2008, pp. 88–90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CBSeveningnews"&gt;Martin, David.

F-14s from the {{USS|Ranger|CV-61}} provided fighter cover during [[Operation Nimble Archer]] in October 1987. Six months later, F-14s from the ''Enterprise'' provided fighter cover and escort for U.S. naval vessels and strike aircraft involved in [[Operation Praying Mantis]] in April 1988.&lt;ref name=Wise_p195&gt;Wise 2007, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Persian Gulf War (1990–1991)===

Tomcats performed combat air patrols in protection of U.S. carrier battle groups and coalition forces deploying to [[Saudi Arabia]] during [[Operation Desert Shield]].&lt;ref name="Hook_Mag" /&gt; The {{USS|Dwight D. Eisenhower|CVN-69|6}} and {{USS|Independence|CV-62|6}} battle groups, both of which had four F-14 squadrons between them, were the only U.S. assets capable of immediately responding to the Iraqi invasion of [[Kuwait]] and deterring any incursions into Saudi Arabia in August 1990.&lt;ref name="CVN69_History" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bradford"&gt;Bradford 1997, p. 468.&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. forces deploying to the [[Theater (warfare)|theater]] did so initially under the protection of naval air cover.&lt;ref name="Bradford" /&gt;

Compared to its U.S. Air Force counterpart, the [[F-15]], there were greater limitations on the use of beyond visual range missiles for the F-14 during Operation Desert Storm.&lt;ref name="GS_F-14Combat" /&gt; This was the result of the U.S. Navy not having developed the systems and procedures required to integrate its carrier air groups into a joint air component command, as Cold War-era tactics had the Navy operating on its own.&lt;ref name="USN_GulfWar_History"&gt;Marolda, Edward J.

Tomcat aircrews that encountered Iraqi fighters found that the Iraqis would disengage and flee once tracked by the F-14's radar and pursued.&lt;ref name="USN_DS_History" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Gillcrest_p168&gt;Gillcrest 1994, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; On the first day of ''Desert Storm'', two Iraqi MiG-21s attempting to escape from four VF-103 F-14Bs flew directly into a flight of four [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18s]] that shot down both MiGs.&lt;ref name=Wilcox_1996_pp259-265&gt;Wilcox 1996, pp. 259–265.&lt;/ref&gt; According to interviewed F-15 pilots, several kills by F-15s were made in a similar manner, with Iraqi aircraft being downed after retreating from Tomcats.&lt;ref name=Brown_1998_p8&gt;Brown 1998, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the air-to-air duties, Tomcats supported the coalition's need for [[bomb damage assessment|battle damage assessments]] (BDA) and locating [[Scud]] missile launch sites by performing tactical reconnaissance missions utilizing TARPS.&lt;ref name="Lowry"&gt;Lowry 2008, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; These missions helped fill in intelligence gathering gaps when cloudy skies prevented the use of [[spy satellite|space-based surveillance]] systems.&lt;ref name="Lowry" /&gt;

On 21 January 1991, an F-14B with its pilot, Lieutenant Devon Jones, and [[Radar Intercept Officer]], Lieutenant Lawrence Slade, of VF-103 was shot down by an SA-2 surface-to-air missile while on an escort mission over Al Asad Air Base.&lt;ref name=Pokrant_pp31-32&gt;Pokrant 1999, pp. 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt; Jones was recovered the following day, but Slade was captured and held as a [[prisoner of war]] until his release on 4 March 1991.&lt;ref name=Pokrant_pp31-32 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Pokrant_pp185-187&gt;Pokrant 1999, pp. 185–187.&lt;/ref&gt; This incident marked the only time a U.S. Navy F-14 was lost to hostile fire.

One air-to-air kill was credited to the F-14 during the war. An Iraqi [[Mil Mi-8]] helicopter was shot down by a VF-1 F-14A using an AIM-9 Sidewinder on 6 February 1991.&lt;ref name=Brown_pp109-115&gt;Brown 2007, pp. 109–115.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tomcat faced an early retirement due to budget cuts following the end of both the Persian Gulf and Cold Wars in 1991. However, the retirement of the [[Grumman A-6 Intruder]] was impetus for the U.S. Navy to continue to use the F-14 by upgrading it with a precision strike capability.

===Interwar air operations over Iraq (1991–2003)===
{{See also|Operation Provide Comfort|Operation Southern Watch|Operation Northern Watch|Operation Desert Fox}}
Following Operation Desert Storm, F-14s patrolled the [[no-fly zone]]s that were established over Iraq for Operations [[Operation Provide Comfort|Provide Comfort]], [[Operation Southern Watch|Southern Watch]] and [[Operation Northern Watch|Northern Watch]]. F-14s performed [[combat air patrol]], [[escort fighter|fighter escort]], [[aerial reconnaissance]] and [[air interdiction]] missions in support of these operations until the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq]]. TARPS-equipped F-14s provided Joint Task Force Southwest Asia with the ability to monitor Iraqi military activity on a daily basis in southern Iraq, making the Tomcat a primary asset in Operation Southern Watch.&lt;ref name=Holmes_2005_p11&gt;Holmes 2005, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

F-14s were often part of [[strike package]]s when conducting missions in support of Operation Southern Watch. During many of these missions, the Tomcat's long range allowed it to stay on station for twice as long as other U.S. Navy tactical aircraft.&lt;ref name=Holmes_2005_pp13-14&gt;Holmes 2005, pp. 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt; F-14s were able to remain on station after other Navy aircraft that made the ingress with them had to be replaced. The Tomcats would depart with the strike package after the pilots of the second set of aircraft declared that they needed fuel.&lt;ref name=Holmes_2005_pp13-14 /&gt;

On 16 December 1998, F-14Bs from VF-32 took part in a 33-aircraft strike package that spearheaded [[Operation Desert Fox]].&lt;ref name="VFA32_Squadron_History"&gt;[http://www.public.navy.mil/airfor/vfa32/Pages/SquadronHistory.aspx "VFA-32 Squadron History."] U.S. Navy.

In addition to performing strike missions, F-14s from both squadrons conducted escort combat air patrols for U.S. Air Force [[Rockwell B-1 Lancer|B-1B]] bombers that were committed to the operation beginning on 17 December.&lt;ref name="Holmes_2005_pp14-16"&gt;Holmes 2005, pp. 14–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Many firsts for the F-14 were achieved during ''Desert Fox'', including the first [[GBU-24]] "Paveway III" laser-guided bombs dropped in combat by the U.S. Navy, the first multiple GBU-24 drop by any platform in combat, the first combat use of the [[LANTIRN|Low Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night]] (LANTIRN) [[targeting pods|targeting pod]] system, the first autonomous delivery of a GBU-[[GBU-10|10]]/[[GBU-16|16]]/24 [[laser-guided bomb]] by an F-14, and the first use of [[night vision device]]s in combat.&lt;ref name="VFA32_Squadron_History" /&gt; VF-32 alone dropped {{convert|111054|lb|kg}} of munitions during 16 strike missions and 38 sorties during the operation.&lt;ref name="VFA32_Squadron_History" /&gt;

Two F-14Ds from VF-213 engaged several Iraqi aircraft challenging the no-fly zone on 5 January 1999. During the engagement, the F-14s were approached by a pair of MiG-23s that turned away before they were fired on. The F-14 aircrews then focused on a MiG-25 that continued to advance and launched two [[AIM-54 Phoenix|AIM-54C Phoenix]] missiles at it from very long distance. Both AIM-54s' rocket motors failed and the missiles did not hit their target. All of the Iraqi aircraft were able fly back out of the no-fly zone, although a MiG-23 was reported to have run out of fuel and crashed before reaching its base. This engagement marked the first time the U.S. Navy launched AIM-54s in combat. At the conclusion of VF-213's 1998–1999 cruise, the squadron had executed 19 strikes, dropped 20 laser-guided bombs with a 64-percent success rate, supported 11 combined strikes, flown 70 missions, logged 230 sorties with over 615 combat hours, and performed 45 reconnaissance missions imaging more than 580 targets.&lt;ref&gt;Rausa, Zeno.

{{See also|Operation Deliberate Force|Operation Allied Force}}
In August and September 1995, [[NATO]] launched [[Operation Deliberate Force]], and the {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71}} and its air wing supported the operation. F-14s from VF-14 and VF-41 participated in strikes. VF-41 is credited with being the first F-14 unit to drop [[laser-guided bomb]]s in combat when, on 5 September 1995, two F-14As attacked an ammunition dump in eastern [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]]. The bomb's targets were identified by laser indicators from [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18s]] because the F-14 was not yet cleared to carry the [[LANTIRN]] pod. VF-41 alone logged 600 combat hours and 530 sorties during this cruise.

VF-14 and VF-41 took part in [[Operation Allied Force]], NATO's aerial campaign against [[Serbia]]n operations in Kosovo, between 9 April 1999 and 9 June 1999. F-14s of VF-14 dropped 350 laser-guided {{convert|1000|lb|kg|sp=us|adj=on}} bombs, in addition to other air-to-ground ordnance. F-14s flew [[combat air patrol]], escort, and [[Close Air Support|strike]] missions; acted as [[Forward Air Controller]]s; and performed [[TARPS]] missions. VF-41 dropped the last bombs of the war on a dummy [[9K31 Strela-1|SA-9]] surface-to-air missile launcher inside the Kosovo border near the peace-signing site on 9 June 1999.

===Operation Enduring Freedom (2001–2003)===
[[File:F-14 Tomcat preparing to refuel.jpg|thumb|An F-14D from VF-213 prepares to refuel over Afghanistan.]]

After the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], no fewer than eight F-14 squadrons participated in [[Operation Enduring Freedom]], flying long-range missions from the Indian Ocean to strike targets around [[Afghanistan]] and conducting reconnaissance and ground support missions. From the start of Operation Enduring Freedom to the end of [[Operation Anaconda]], F-14s from [[VF-14]], [[VF-41]], [[VF-102]], [[VF-211]], and [[VF-213]] dropped more than {{convert|1334000|lb|kg}} of ordnance on targets. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} [[VF-11]] and [[VF-143]], alongside [[CVW-7]], dropped {{convert|64000|lb|kg}} of ordnance, both the "Red Rippers" and the "Pukin' Dogs" making history as they dropped [[JDAM]] bombs from the F-14 for the first time during combat.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} [[VF-103]] arrived in Afghanistan in June 2002 when combat was scarce, and the "Jolly Rogers" did not get the opportunity to drop any bombs during the operation.

During the war, VF-213 logged over 500 combat sorties, 2,600 combat hours, and dropped {{convert|435000|lb|kg}} of ordnance (452 bombs) during their 10 weeks over Afghanistan;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2008, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; the "Black Lions" also had the distinct honor of dropping the first bombs of Operation Enduring Freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2008, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; VF-102 dropped more bombs—680 of them, totaling {{convert|420000|lb|kg}}—and logged more combat hours (more than 5,000) than any other F-14 unit that took part in the operation, and the unit dropped an additional {{convert|50000|lb|kg}} of ordnance.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2008, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2008, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; VF-211 flew 1,250 combat sorties, logging 4,200 combat hours and dropping {{convert|100000|lb|kg}} of ordnance.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2008, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; VF-14 led more strikes than any other squadron in [[CVW-8]], and dropped 174 laser-guided bombs, totaling {{convert|179324|lb|kg}} and buddy-lased 28 [[AGM-65 Maverick]] missiles and 23 laser-guided bombs,&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2008, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; and like their sister squadron VF-41, they flew the oldest jets in the fleet. VF-41 dropped more than {{convert|200000|lb|kg}} of bombs (202 laser-guided bombs) with an 82 percent hit rate, which was a level of accuracy that had never previously been achieved in the U.S. Navy.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2008, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation Iraqi Freedom (2003–2006)===
[[File:gw-tomphoenix.jpg|thumb|An F-14 launches an [[AIM-54 Phoenix]] during training in 2002]]

F-14s from [[VF-2]], [[VF-31]], [[VF-32]], [[VF-154]], and [[VF-213]] participated in Operation Iraqi Freedom. The F-14s flew 2,547 combat sorties and dropped 1,452 GBU, JDAM, and MK-82 bombs with just one lost jet (from engine failure). F-14s led strikes on [[Baghdad]], attacking targets such as the Iraqi Ministry of Information's [[Salman Pak]] radio relay transmitter facility at Al Hurriyah (southwest of central Baghdad) with JDAM bombs. Another notable mission involved TARPS-equipped F-14Ds dropping four Mark 82 bombs on [[Saddam Hussein]]'s Presidential [[yacht]] ''Al-Mansur'' (The Victor). F-14s also supported ground troops during the war and acted as Forward Air Controllers for other aircraft. An aircrew from VF-32 was involved in the worst [[friendly fire|friendly-fire]] incident in the war when the crew attacked a [[U.S. Special Forces]] convoy in northern Iraq, believing they were Iraqi forces.

During the F-14's last three years in service, the remaining units all deployed to the Persian Gulf region in support of the U.S. forces in Iraq. The final deployment for the F-14 was between September 2005 and March 2006 with VF-31 and VF-213. These two units collectively completed 1,163 combat sorties, totaling 6,876 flight hours. They dropped {{convert|9500|lb|kg}} of ordnance during reconnaissance, surveillance, and close air support missions in support of the war in Iraq.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Before the Islamic Revolution the Shah of Iran, [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] arranged to arm the Iranian Air Force with 80 Grumman F-14A Tomcats and 633 AIM-54 Phoenix missiles in a deal of $2 billion USD.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/persian-cats-9242012/ How Iranian air crews, cut off from U.S. technical support, used the F-14 against Iraqi attackers]&lt;/ref&gt;, in the 1970s Iran looked for an air superiority fighter counter [[Soviet]] air incursions of [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25|MiG-25]] fighters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/persian-cats-9242012/ How Iranian air crews, cut off from U.S. technical support, used the F-14 against Iraqi attackers]&lt;/ref&gt;.

By September 1980,  the [[Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force]] (IRIAF) managed to make an increasing number of airframes operational, despite immense problems due to repeated purges of its officers. Some of those officers were executed; others were imprisoned, forced into exile, or forced to take early retirement. The IRIAF survived these times, and its Tomcats were to become involved in the war against Iraq, scoring their first kill on 7 September 1980.&lt;ref name="Persian Cats"/&gt;

There is limited information available about the service of F-14s in the [[Iran–Iraq War]]. Western intelligence indicates that the IRIAF was in decline at the onset of the war in September 1980, and it is rumored that some level of sabotage was committed on the F-14s by either Americans or Iranians loyal to the Shah, during the [[Iranian Revolution]].&lt;ref name="Aerospaceweb"&gt;[http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/planes/q0077.shtml "Iranian Air Force F-14."] ''AerospaceWeb.'' Retrieved: 26 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the overthrow of the Shah, most Iranian F-14 pilots and technicians trained in the United States fled from Iran, fearing their association with the Shah's regime, and their time in the United States would endanger them. Only two pilots out of the original flight class chose to remain in Iran. Their fears proved correct, and many of the original Iranian F-14 crews and technicians who remained were jailed or executed by the new regime. Eventually, several jailed F-14 pilots were released when war broke out with Iraq.&lt;ref name="Persian Cats"&gt;Cooper, Tom. [http://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/persiancats.html "Persian Cats."]  ''Smithsonian Air &amp; Space'', Vol. 21, No. 3, September 2006, pp. 36–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States estimated that the IRIAF was able to keep between 15 and 20 F-14s operational by cannibalizing parts from other examples. The IRIAF claims a higher figure, and was able to assemble 25 aircraft for an 11 February 1985 fly-over of [[Tehran]]. Despite the U.S embargo following the Islamic Revolution,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB210/ ''The Iran-Contra Affair 20 Years On''].

===Role===
''[[GlobalSecurity]]'' indicates that Iran flew the F-14 in an [[Airborne Early Warning and Control|AWACS]]-type role. To counter, Iraqi [[Dassault Mirage F1#Mirage F1E|Mirage F1-EQ]]s flew low-altitude profiles, popping up briefly to illuminate and launch missiles against the F-14s; several Tomcats were lost in this manner. GlobalSecurity also reports that less than 20 aircraft were still airworthy as of 2000, and cited one report that only seven can be airborne at one time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iran/airforce.htm "Air Force (Iranian Imperial Air Force)."] ''Global Security.'' Retrieved: 22 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was thought{{By whom|date=November 2010}} for many years that Iran used the fighter primarily as an airborne radar controller, escorted and protected by other fighters, but later information indicates this was incorrect.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} While the IRIAF did husband its fleet of F-14s, the aircraft were used aggressively when needed, even escorting strike packages deep into Iraqi airspace. Initially, the IRIAF F-14s flew intensive CAP patrols, some lasting nine hours, over main bases. IRIAF Tomcats often escorted tankers supporting strike packages heading into Iraq, scanning over the border with their radars and intercepting inbound Iraqi aircraft. With the AWG-9 radar and long range AIM-54 and medium range AIM-7 missiles, the Tomcats could be used as offensive weapons without leaving Iranian airspace.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

United States [[Airborne Warning And Control System|AWACS]] aircraft observed the downing of an Iraqi [[Tupolev Tu-22]] "Blinder" bomber, and the downing of at least one F-14. Western sources estimate four kills against four to five losses; the official Iranian estimate is 35-45 kills, and 12 losses, all reportedly due to engine failure during combat.&lt;ref name="Aerospaceweb" /&gt;

===Armament===
Also unresolved is the extent of usage of the AIM-54 Phoenix missile. Most Western sources{{who|date=November 2010}} indicate that sabotage prevented their use, although other sources{{who|date=November 2010}} claim that up to 25 planes were downed by AIM-54s before Iran's supply ran out. The Iranian F-14s used the [[AIM-7 Sparrow]] and [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]] air-to-air missiles as primary armament; Iran is reportedly developing a domestic copy of the Sparrow, as well as the Phoenix.{{By whom|date=November 2010}}

===Combat history===
[[File:Jalil Zandi-.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Jalil Zandi]], the most successful F-14 pilot worldwide.]]
In 2004, Tom Cooper published ''Iranian F-14 Tomcat Units in Combat'', based mainly on primary interviews with Iranian pilots. The book makes many claims that contradict previous reports. In particular, Cooper claims that Iran's F-14s had up to 159 kills, and that in one incident, four Iraqi aircraft were shot down with one AIM-54 (The missile's warhead exploded between them and severely damaged them).
{{quote|By 1980, with the prospect of war with Iraq becoming ever more likely, most of the 77 surviving F-14 airframes were found to be in non-operational condition, or at least had non-functioning radars. As a result, F-14 pilots were forced to rely on ground control for their first wartime patrol and intercept missions. Within a few days of the start of the war, a dozen or so F-14s were made operational.|sign=Tom Cooper|source="Persian Cats", ''Smithsonian Air &amp; Space''&lt;ref name="Persian Cats" /&gt;}}

The first confirmed kill by an F-14A during the [[Iran–Iraq War]] occurred before the formal start of hostilities: on 7 September 1980, an IRIAF F-14A destroyed an Iraqi Mil Mi-25 (export variant of the [[Mil Mi-24]]) Hind helicopter using its [[M61 Vulcan|20mm Vulcan cannon]].{{#tag:ref|Quote: "for political reasons, the pilot's name will probably never be known." It has been reliably confirmed that, after missing with several [[AIM-9P Sidewinder]]s, the pilot turned his [[M61A1]] Vulcan cannon on the target, thus scoring the first ever Tomcat gun victory.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper and Bishop 2004, pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}} Six days later, Major Mohammad-Reza Attaie shot down an Iraqi MiG-21 with an AIM-54 Phoenix while flying a border patrol.&lt;ref name="Persian Cats" /&gt; A single AIM-54 fired in July 1982 by Captain Hashemi may have destroyed two Iraqi MiG-23s flying in close formation.&lt;ref name="Persian Cats" /&gt;

Cooper claims the AIM-54s were used only sporadically during the start of the war, most likely because of a shortage of qualified radar intercept officers, and then more frequently in 1981 and 1982—until the lack of thermal batteries suspended the missiles' use in 1986.&lt;ref name="Persian Cats" /&gt; There were also rumors{{by whom|date=November 2010}} that suggested that Iran's Tomcat fleet would be upgraded with avionics derived from the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-31|MiG-31]] "Foxhound". However,  IRIAF officials and pilots insist that the Soviets were never allowed near the F-14s, and never received any F-14 or AIM-54 technology.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Also, the AIM-54 missile was never out of service in the IRIAF, though the stocks of operational missiles were low at times. Clandestine deliveries from US sources and black market purchases supplied spares to top up the Phoenix reserves during the war, and spares deliveries from the USA in the 1990s have also helped.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Furthermore, an attempt was made to adapt the [[MIM-23 Hawk]] surface-to-air missiles that were also a carry-over from the pre-revolution period, to be used as air-to-air missiles for the F-14; at least two F-14s have been successfully modified to carry the hybrid weaponry.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

All in all, the IRIAF was said to have launched possibly 70 to 90 AIM-54A missiles, and 60–70 of those scored.{{vague|date=November 2010}} Of those, almost 90 percent of the AIM-54A missiles fired were used against Iraqi fighters and fighter-bombers. Only about a dozen{{vague|date=November 2010}} victories by AIM-54s were claimed{{by whom|date=November 2010}} to be against fast, high-flying targets such as the MiG-25 or [[Tupolev Tu-22|Tu-22 'Blinder']].

By the close of the war, both sides were unable to obtain new aircraft or parts, and aerial combat had become rare, since neither side could afford to lose aircraft they could not replace. In particular, the IRIAF F-14 fleet suffered from a lack of trained technicians, and by 1984 only 40 F-14s were still in service. By 1986, that number had dropped to just 25. The F-14 was relegated to protecting Iran's vital oil refining and export infrastructure; in this role, they often encountered French-built, Iraqi [[Dassault Mirage F1#Mirage F1E|Dassault Mirage F1EQ]] fighters attempting to attack Iranian [[oil pipeline]]s.&lt;ref name="Persian Cats" /&gt;

One IRIAF pilot distinguished himself in combat by becoming the all-time top scoring F-14 ace. Major [[Jalil Zandi]] is credited with shooting down eight Iraqi aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Tom and Farzad Bishop.

==Background==
The original [[long distance telephone]] network actually started in 1885, in New York City. By 1892 this line reached [[Chicago]]. After introducing [[loading coil]]s in 1899, the long distance line continued west, and by 1911 it reached [[Denver, Colorado]]. The president of AT&amp;T, [[Theodore Vail]], committed the company to a transcontinental line in 1909.

On June 17, 1914, after affixing {{convert|4,750|mi|km}} of telephone line, workers raised the final pole at [[Wendover, Utah]], actually on the border between Nevada and Utah state lines. Then, [[Theodore Vail]], the president of AT&amp;T, succeeded in transmitting his voice across the [[continental U.S.]] in July 1914.

Six months later, amidst the celebrations surrounding the [[Panama–Pacific International Exposition]], on January 25, 1915, [[Alexander Graham Bell]], in New York City, repeated his famous statement "Mr. Watson, come here. I want you," into the telephone, which was heard by his assistant [[Thomas Augustus Watson|Dr. Watson]] in [[San Francisco]], for a long distance call of {{convert|3,400|mi|km}}. Dr. Watson replied, "It will take me five days to get there now!" The Alexander Graham Bell call officially initiated AT&amp;T's transcontinental service.&lt;ref name=riordan/&gt;&lt;ref name=transtel/&gt;&lt;ref name=PBS/&gt;&lt;ref name=mcmaster/&gt; The phone call was merely symbolic. Dr. Watson was at 333 Grant Avenue in [[San Francisco]] to receive the call, placed by Bell from the Telephone Building at [[195 Broadway|15 Dey Street]] in [[New York City]]. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] and the mayors of both cities were also involved in the call.

Later, President [[Woodrow Wilson]] spoke to an audience in San Francisco from [[the White House]] and is quoted as saying "It appeals to the imagination to speak across the continent." &lt;ref name=riordan/&gt;&lt;ref name=transtel/&gt;&lt;ref name=PBS/&gt;&lt;ref name=mcmaster/&gt; However, President Wilson was concerned with the "devaluation of the individual" as AT&amp;T celebrated the achievement of the company rather than distinguishing individual inventors, contributors, and innovators.

'''Garrett Wade''' is a family-owned business, established in 1975 and based in [[DUMBO, Brooklyn]] and [[Cincinnati, Ohio]].&lt;ref name="NY Times"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/22/garden/where-to-find-it-tools-for-carvers-and-cabinetmakers.html New York Times - WHERE TO FIND IT; Tools for Carvers and Cabinetmakers]&lt;/ref&gt;  It sources and sells a range of high quality [[hand tools]],&lt;ref name="NY Times 2"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/12/garden/helpful-hardware-tools-that-measure-by-barbara-l-eisenberg-and-mary-smith.html New York Times - Helpful Hardware - Tools that Measure]&lt;/ref&gt; primarily for woodworking, gardening, and outdoor work, based on traditional designs.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Duginske. Tools: A Complete Illustrated Encyclopedia. Simon &amp; Schuster: New York, NY. 2001. {{ISBN|0743213483}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is best known for its [[tools]] used for [[woodworking]]. Garry Chinn is the founder and CEO of Garrett Wade.

==History==
In the spring of 1975, Garretson Wade Chinn mailed the first Garrett Wade&lt;ref name="GW HOME"&gt;[https://www.garrettwade.com Garrett Wade]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mail order|catalog]]. It contained primarily [[woodworking]] tools sourced from around the world, with particular focus on [[Europe]]. The goal of the catalog, along with media like [[Fine Woodworking|Fine Woodworking Magazine]], was to reconnect men to the experience of using their hands, as they had done in shop class as boys.
In 1995, responding to decreasing demand for woodworking tools, the company expanded its product line to hand tools for [[Owner-occupancy|homeowners]],&lt;ref name="NY Times 3"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/05/garden/05shop.html New York Times - As the Thermometer Falls, ‘Man Cave’ Décor Is Warming Up]&lt;/ref&gt; with particular focus on [[gardening]] and [[Wilderness|outdoor]] tools. Recently, Garrett Wade also began researching, developing and manufacturing tools in-house.&lt;ref name="COOLMAT"&gt;[http://coolmaterial.com/gear/garrett-wade-edc-multi-tool-capsule/ Cool Material]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AWESOMER"&gt;[http://theawesomer.com/brass-capsule-multi-tool/416226/ The Awesomer]&lt;/ref&gt;

Garrett Wade was involved in the early success of other woodworking companies such as [[Lie-Nielsen Toolworks|Lie Nielsen Toolworks]] and Lee Valley.&lt;ref name="LV LTR"&gt;[http://www.leevalley.com/us/home/page.aspx?p=46993&amp;cat=60655,46992] Lee Valley&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Garrett Wade products compete with mass-produced tools from companies such as [[Stanley Black &amp; Decker|Stanley]] and [[Craftsman (tools)|Craftsman]] although their tools are generally more unique &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |date=2011 |title=Social Media Playbook for Business: Reaching Your Online Community with Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and More |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W9GDYs11EFsC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;dq=%22Garrett+Wade%22+tools&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiHnNDL-azTAhUi5oMKHf_XCQsQ6AEIRDAH#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Garrett%20Wade%22%20tools&amp;f=false |location=Santa Barbara, CA |publisher=ABL-CLIO |page=137 |isbn=0313386277 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; than mainstream.

'''Google Pay Send''' (formerly '''Google Wallet''') is a [[peer-to-peer banking|peer-to-peer payments service]] developed by [[Google]] that allows people to send and receive money from a mobile device or desktop computer at no cost to either sender or receiver. When set up, a Google Pay account must be linked to an existing [[debit card]] or bank account in the United States or United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Set up Wallet|url=https://support.google.com/wallet/answer/6285508?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=6285490|publisher=Google|accessdate=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google Pay Send can be used through the Google Pay Send [[Mobile app|app]] and [[Gmail]]. The app is available for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices running Android 4.0 and above, and for [[iOS]] devices running iOS 7.0 and above.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Google Wallet|url = https://www.google.com/wallet/faq/|publisher = Google|access-date = 2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since 2018, [[Android Pay]] and Google Wallet has unified into a single pay system called [[Google Pay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/google-launches-google-pay-mobile-payment-service/|title=Google merges payment platforms under Google Pay brand|last=Nieva|first=Richard|date=8 January 2018|work=[[CNET]]|access-date=8 January 2018|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|last2=Bennett|first2=Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google Pay Send, a feature included inside Google Pay, has replaced the Google Wallet service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pay-send-now-starting-replace-google-wallet|title=Google Pay Send now starting to replace Google Wallet|date=2018-02-22|work=Android Central|access-date=2018-02-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service==
Google Pay is structured to allow its patrons to send money to each other. To send money, a Google Pay user enters the email address or phone number of the recipient. The recipient must then link that phone number or email address to a bank account in order to access those funds. If the recipient also has a Google Pay account, the funds will post to that account directly.

Users can link up to two bank accounts when the Wallet account is created.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Add a bank account - Wallet Help|url = https://support.google.com/wallet/answer/6285491?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=6285490|publisher = Google|access-date = 2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Received money goes to the Google Pay Balance and stays there until the user decides to cash out to a linked account.

The Google Pay app is available for free from either [[Google Play]] or the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]]. After downloading the app, the user creates a four-digit [[personal identification number]] (PIN) for managing everything within their Google Pay account. The PIN verifies access to the Wallet app on the user’s mobile device.&lt;ref name="support.google.com"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Set up your Wallet app - Wallet Help|url = https://support.google.com/wallet/answer/6285508?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=6285490|publisher = Google|access-date = 2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before it was discontinued on June 30, 2016, the Google Wallet Card was recognized by the [[Cirrus (interbank network)|Cirrus network]] operated by [[MasterCard]] (rather than the [[Plus (interbank network)|Plus network]] operated by [[Visa Inc.|Visa]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Welcome to a new Google Wallet|url = http://googlecommerce.blogspot.com/2015/09/new-google-wallet.html|website = Google Commerce|access-date = 2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, Google launched its first major payments service outside the United States, [[Tez (software)|Tez]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2017/09/18/google-mobile-wallet-india-tez/|title=Google Pitches A Mobile Wallet To India's 300 Million Smartphone Users|last=Olson|first=Parmy|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-09-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/17/google-debuts-tez-a-mobile-wallet-and-payments-app-for-india/|title=Google debuts Tez, a mobile payments app for India that uses Audio QR to transfer money|last=Lunden|first=Ingrid|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2017-09-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in India.

===Regional Availability===
Google Pay Send is available only in the US and the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is Google Pay Send?|url = https://support.google.com/pay/send/answer/7523247?hl=en|publisher = Google|access-date = 2018-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Security}}History==

=== Early history ===
[[File:Google Wallet 2015 logo.PNG|left|thumb|108x108px|Logo of former ''Google Wallet'' brand, used in 2015.]]
Google demonstrated the original version of the service at a press conference on May 26, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Google Reveals Mobile Payment System: Google Wallet|url = http://mashable.com/2011/05/26/google-mobile-payment-system-liveblog/|website = Mashable|access-date = 2016-02-08|first = Christina Warren2011-05-26 12:00:29|last = UTC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first app was released in the US only on September 19, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = This Day in Tech: Google Wallet launches|url = http://www.cnet.com/news/this-day-in-tech-google-wallet-launches/|publisher = CNET|access-date = 2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 15, 2013, Google announced the integration of Google Wallet and Gmail, allowing users to send money through Gmail attachments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Attach Real Money in Gmail with Google Wallet {{!}} Webmasters|url = http://www.w3reports.com/2013/05/15/attach-real-money-in-gmail-with-google-wallet/|website = W3Reports|access-date = 2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Google Wallet is available only in the United States, the Gmail integration is currently available in the U.S. and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Send money through Gmail with Google Wallet - TNC|url = https://www.technewscentral.com/send-money-gmail-google-wallet/id_7109|website = TNC|access-date = 2016-02-08|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:The Google Wallet card.jpg|thumb|The Google Wallet card before 2015|226x226px]]The physical Google Wallet Card was an optional addition to the app which allowed users to make purchases at point-of-sale (in stores or online) drawing from funds in their Google Wallet account, attached debit card account, or bank account. The card could also be used to withdraw cash at ATMs with no Google-associated fee, and could be used like a debit card for virtually any purpose, including such things as renting a car. The Wallet Card was discontinued on June 30, 2016, and replaced with [[Android Pay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://support.google.com/wallet/answer/6285510?hl=en|title=Your Wallet Card - Wallet Help|publisher=Google|access-date=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title =Google Confirms The Physical Google Wallet Card Is Going Away On June 30th|url = http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/03/31/google-confirms-the-physical-google-wallet-card-is-going-away-on-june-30th/
|access-date = 2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original version of Google Wallet allowed users to make point-of-sale purchases with their mobile devices using [[near-field communication]] (NFC) technology.  As of September 2015, however, Google dropped NFC from Google Wallet, offering the technology only through [[Android Pay]], which is a separate application available only to Android users.  As a result, any gift cards, loyalty programs, and promotional offers stored in an older version of Google Wallet could no longer be used. For Android users, those outstanding offers and gift cards were automatically transferred to Android Pay. For iOS users, instructions were provided to export the offers for alternative use.&lt;ref name="techtimes.com"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Android Pay vs. Google Wallet: What's The Difference?|url = http://www.techtimes.com/articles/82345/20150907/android-pay-vs-google-wallet-whats-the-difference.htm|website = Tech Times|date = 2015-09-07|access-date = 2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Google Wallet relaunches as a Venmo and Square Cash rival|url = https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/9/9298845/google-wallet-relaunch-android-pay|website = The Verge|access-date = 2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were no reported security problems with the NFC technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Android Pay Goes Live, Google Wallet Becomes Cash Swap App|url = https://blogs.wsj.com/personal-technology/2015/09/10/android-pay-goes-live-google-wallet-becomes-cash-swap-app/|website = WSJ Blogs - Personal Tech News|date = 2015-09-10|access-date = 2016-02-08|first = Nathan|last = Olivarez-Giles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distinction from Android Pay ===
On February 23, 2015, Google announced that it would acquire the intellectual property of the carrier-backed competitor [[Softcard]] and integrate it into Google Wallet, and that American mobile network operators [[AT&amp;T Mobility]], [[T-Mobile US]], and [[Verizon Wireless]] would bundle the Google Wallet app on their compatible devices. The effective merger resulted in the new service known as [[Android Pay]], a competitor to [[Apple Pay]] and similar NFC mobile payment service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Google Wallet will soon come pre-installed on Verizon, AT&amp;T, and T-Mobile Android phones|url = https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/23/8091407/google-wallet-softcard-partnership|website = The Verge|access-date = 2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Google Wallet, Softcard partner to take on Apple Pay|url = http://www.cnet.com/news/google-wallet-softcard-partner-on-mobile-payments/|publisher = CNET|access-date = 2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Separate from Android Pay, Google Wallet now allows peer-to-peer transactions for cases such as when people want to split the cost of shared expenses, reimburse each other, keep track of joint spending, or give money as a gift or loan.

While Android Pay is only available to Android users, Google Wallet is available on iOS and via Gmail as well. For those using Android, the two products together (Android Pay and Google Wallet) offer a comprehensive payments management system, a “tool for staying in charge of the bank account.”&lt;ref name="techtimes.com"/&gt; Users can link their bank accounts or debit cards to Android Pay and to their Google Wallet app. With this approach, users can manage their money from one source, with the ability to:
* Pay at point-of-sale by tapping their phone (via Android Pay)
* Send and receive money to other individuals for free (via the Google Wallet app)
* Keep track of spending (through the optional Google Wallet Card)

== Business model ==
Google does not charge users for access to Google Wallet. Sending and receiving money is free, as is adding money to a Wallet Card through a linked bank account. There are limits on how much money users can add to their Wallet Balance, withdraw from the linked account or card, or send and receive to other individuals. These limits are set per transaction and within certain time periods. Previously, a 2.9% fee applied to funds added via debit card, although Google dropped that ability as of May 2, 2016.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Fees, limits &amp; transfer times - Wallet Help|url = https://support.google.com/wallet/answer/6285486?hl=en|publisher = Google|access-date = 2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Funds sent from a Wallet balance, debit card, or linked bank account are generally available to the recipient immediately, and if the recipient has his or her own Wallet account and card, he or she can make an immediate withdrawal of those funds from an ATM.  If the funds are drawn on the sender's Wallet balance, the balance will also reflect this change immediately.  Any portion of funds drawn via a linked bank account will take two or three days to actually post to that account, though these funds will show as "pending" withdrawals on that account within 24 hours.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

While Google does not have revenue coming in from the Wallet ecosystem (the web service, app, and the Wallet Card), the product is part of a larger suite of e-commerce products, including Android Pay, which integrates loyalty programs and promotions from other businesses.

=={{Anchor|SECURE-ELEMENT}}Security==
Google Wallet protects payment credentials by storing user data on secure servers and encrypting all payment information with industry-standard SSL (secure socket layer) technology. Full credit and debit card information is never shown in the app.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Google Wallet|url = https://www.google.com/wallet/faq/#google-wallet-android-pay|publisher = Google|access-date = 2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; All Google Wallet users are also required to have a PIN to protect access to their Wallet account. The payments PIN is used for:
* Gaining access to the Google Wallet app on a mobile device
* Making point-of-sale purchases with a Google Wallet Card
* Withdrawing cash with a Google Wallet Card at an ATM
Google also recommends having a general passcode on mobile devices for additional security.

In some cases, users have to verify their identity in order to make certain transactions. If prompted to do so, the user will visit the Wallet website and follow steps to ensure their accurate identity. This is in adherence with US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation financial regulations that require payment providers to ensure customer identity.&lt;ref name="support.google.com"/&gt;

If a Google Wallet Card is lost or stolen, users can immediately cancel access to it by signing into myaccount.google.com. Google also offers the additional flexibility of temporarily locking the card if a user suspects that the card has simply been misplaced. In the event of unauthorized transactions, Google Wallet Fraud Protection covers 100% of verified unauthorized transactions made in the US reported within 120 days of the transaction. Only US residents who have Wallet accounts associated with a US address are eligible for coverage under this policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Google Wallet|url = https://www.google.com/wallet/faq/#security|publisher = Google|access-date = 2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
Regarding an earlier version of Google Wallet (in 2012), an analysis by security company [[Nowsecure]] revealed that some card information stored by Google Wallet was accessible outside of the application. It is suggested that hackers could create a way to intercept data by eavesdropping on Google Analytics, which monitors apps used on the Android OS. A previous analysis by the same firm revealed a number of other exploits that have since been fixed.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Fogarty, [http://www.itworld.com/mobile-wireless/248596/even-after-rewrites-google-wallet-retains-gaping-security-holes-mainly-due-an Even after rewrites, Google Wallet retains gaping security holes, mainly due to Android], itworld, February 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== PayPal lawsuit ==
Shortly after the launch of Google Wallet's first iteration in 2011, [[PayPal]] filed a lawsuit against Google and two former employees of [[PayPal]] – Osama Bedier and Stephanie Tilenius.  The complaint alleges "misappropriation of trade secrets" and "breach of fiduciary duty". The lawsuit revealed that Google had been negotiating with PayPal for two years to power payments on mobile devices. But just as the deal was about to be signed, Google backed off and instead hired the PayPal executive negotiating the deal, Bedier. The lawsuit noted that Bedier knew all of PayPal's future plans for mobile payments, as well as an internal detailed analysis of Google’s weaknesses in the area. Not only that, it accused him of storing "confidential information in locations such as his non-PayPal computers, non-PayPal e-mail account, and an account on the remote computing service called '[[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]]'."&lt;ref name="paypallawsuit"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/05/26/paypal-lawsuit-google |title=PayPal Lawsuit Against Google Reveals Recruiting Saga And A Deal Gone Sour |work=[[TechCrunch]] |first=Erick |last=Schonfeld |date=May 26, 2011 |access-date=May 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google ran a competitor to PayPal, [[Google Checkout]], from 2006 to 2013. In 2011, Google Wallet replaced Checkout's services, and development on Checkout was discontinued in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Google will officially retire its Checkout service on November 20, urges US merchants to consider Google Wallet |url=https://thenextweb.com/google/2013/05/21/google-announces-plans-to-kill-checkout-service-on-november-20-urges-us-merchants-to-consider-google-wallet/ |publisher=The Next Web |access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2070">The '''Graphotype platemaker''', is a type of metal marking machine originally used to create address plates for the [[Addressograph]] system and mark [[Dog tag|military style identity tags]] and other [[Nameplate#Nameplates on products|industrial nameplates]].

These machines were manufactured by the Addressograph-Multigraph Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Addressograph-Multigraph Graphotype|url=http://www.ohiomemory.org/cdm/ref/collection/p267401coll36/id/364|website=Ohio Memory Collection|publisher=State Library of Ohio|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The machines came in a number of variants with sliding, hand wheel or keyboard selected letters. The keyboard models and some rotary select units were motorised to allow faster operation. Modern units are usually electronically controlled with computer interfaces.

The machines used in making Addressograph plates would deboss (pressed into the plate) the letters into the plate resulting in a well defined printing surface resembling the typewriter fonts of the day on the reverse side that would be used to transfer the details (usually customer addresses) onto envelopes or form letters.  The same style was used in the early 40's to 80's for the US military identification tags and the tag details could be transferred onto medical charts using a hand held imprinter in field hospital conditions.

These same machines also found use in marking other nameplates and rating plates in industry and for this an embossed (raised letters in the style found on contemporary credit cards) marking style was preferred for ease of reading and maintaining a flat surface on the back of the plate.  Military tags moved over to this style when the imprinting use was deprecated in the late 60's and new machines would only be supplied as embossing units as the address plate market had been taken over by the computer revolution.

In the [[Smithsonian Air and Space Museum]] in [[Washington DC]] the graphotype machine is mistakenly named a 'qraphotype machine'.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7861">'''Gustav Emil Wilhelm Ecke''' (13 June 1896 – 17 December 1971) was a German and later American [[Art history|historian of art]] best known for his book ''Chinese Domestic Furniture'', first published in wartime China in 1944. The book presented the aesthetic of a neglected art form for scholars and connoisseurs and described the techniques of construction for cabinet-makers.{{sfnp|Tseng|1991|p= }} It was the first book in any language on [[Chinese furniture#Cultural Context|Chinese classic hardwood furniture]].{{sfnp|Handler|2001|p=39}}

==Biography==
Ecke was born in [[Bonn, Germany]], a center of [[German Expressionism]] and [[Russian Constructivism]] and made lively by refugees from their home countries. His father, also [[Gustav Ecke (theologian)|Gustav Ecke]] (1855–1920) was a professor of theology at [[Bonn University]].{{sfnp|Jaquillard|1972|p=155}}  Ecke wrote his doctoral thesis on French [[Surrealism]] in 1922, and accepted an offer to be Professor of European Philosophy at [[Xiamen University#History|University of Amoy]] in [[Fujian]] in 1923, then after five years moved to [[Tsinghua University]] in [[Beijing]]. In a brief return to Paris to conduct research, the prospects of fascism daunted him  and he returned to China. He taught at [[Fujen University]] (Catholic University) and was a researcher at the National Institute of Architecture, both in Beijing. He was one of the founding editors of the scholarly journal [[Monumenta Serica]]. In 1945 he married the artist and scholar [[Tseng Yu-ho]]. The couple left China for Hawai’i in 1949. He was curator of Asian Art at the [[Honolulu Academy of Arts]] until he died in 1971.{{sfnp|Tseng|1991|p=68 }}

==Scholarly career==

Soon after arriving in China in the early 1920s, Ecke turned his attention to China’s architectural history. Since there were few surviving wooden structures, he initially photographed and recorded stone buildings in Fujian, where he then taught. After moving to Beijing, he researched as many stone pagodas as he could find in nearby Hebei and Shandong before the outbreak of war in 1937. His book ''Twin Pagodas of Zayton'', published by the [[Harvard-Yenching Institute]] in 1935, and articles in ''Monumenta Serica'', presented some but by no means all of his findings.{{sfnp|Tseng|1991|p=68 }}

In Beijing he joined a group of foreign residents, such as George Kates, [[Laurence Sickman]], and the German photographer [[Hedda Morrison]],  who were the first to collect and catalog classic Chinese furniture. Few Chinese scholars had done research on the subject and Chinese collectors showed interest only in ornate carved and lacquered pieces. The hard times of the 1920s and 1930s forced many families to sell their finest pieces, and many were lost or even burned for fuel. Ecke and Sickman walked or rode by donkey through many parts of China in search of architecture and furniture.{{sfnp|Tseng|1991|p=68}} Ecke’s taste had been shaped by the [[Bauhaus]] movement in the Germany of his youth and its call for utilitarian beauty. One historian of art notes that he was “naturally attracted to the minimally decorated geometric forms and subtle beauty of what has become known as Ming-style furniture or classical Chinese furniture,” that is, hardwood pieces in the  “Ming-style,” not necessarily furniture made in the Ming dynasty. These foreign scholars wrote the first books on what came to be known as Chinese “classic furniture.”{{sfnp|Handler|2001|p=29–30}}

Ecke faced significant problems preparing his research in wartime. There were few reference works to rely on, little money for research assistance, travel was dangerous, and printing resources few. Ecke took apart and measured the furniture in his own collection to give detailed drawings of its construction. Photographs, some full-page, and drawings by Ecke’s collaborator Professor Yang Yue, show the construction of beds, chairs, tables, wardrobes, wash stands, clothes racks and other domestic items.{{sfnp|Tseng|1991|p=68}} ''Chinese Domestic Furniture in Photographs and Measured Drawings''  was published in a limited portfolio edition of 200 copies in Beijing in 1944, then reprinted as a standard book by Tuttle in 1962 and Dover Publications in 1985. [https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/gustav-ecke/chinese-domestic-furniture/ Kirkus Review] The book was influential in its choice of topic and manner of treatment. The classical style of furniture came to dominate the tastes of American collectors after the war partly because of this Bauhaus influence which Ecke and other scholars trained in Europe conveyed.{{sfnp|Handler|2001|p=39}}

Ecke’s final book, ''Chinese Painting in Hawai’i'', written with his wife, said one scholar, was far more than a catalog of the museums holdings, but what another reviewer called a “monumental work” and in itself an “introduction to the study of Chinese painting.”{{sfnp|Jaquillard|1972|p=155}}

In 1991, the First International Symposium on Chinese Ming Domestic Furniture was held in Beijing in Ecke’s memory.{{sfnp|Handler|2001|p=4}}

'''Hitchhiking''' (also known as '''thumbing''' or '''hitching''') is a means of [[transportation]] that is gained by asking people, usually strangers, for a ride in their [[automobile]] or other vehicle. A ride is usually, but not always, free.

[[Nomad|Itinerants]] have also used hitchhiking as a primary mode of travel for the better part of the last century, and continue to do so today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hitchtheworld.com/ Hitch The World | ...indefinite vagabond travel&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.velabas.com Velabas – Travel Narrative and Drawings from Hitchhiking Around the World&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signaling method==
[[Image:Hitchhiker's gesture.jpg|thumb|right|225px|A typical hitchhiker's gesture]]
The hand signals hitchhikers use to signal to drivers that they need a ride differ around the world. Indicators can be physical gestures or displays including written signs. In North America, the United Kingdom and in most of Europe, most hitchhikers stand with their back facing the direction of travel facing oncoming vehicles. The hitchhiker typically extends the arm towards the road with the thumb of the closed hand pointing upward or in the direction of vehicle travel. In some African countries, the hitchhiker's hand is held with the palm facing upwards. In other parts of the world, such as Australia, it is more common to use the index finger to point at the road. In 1971, during the Vietnam War, drivers invented methods to communicate various messages to hitchhikers (frequently soldiers in those areas of the U.S. near military bases). To indicate to a hitchhiking soldier that their vehicle has no additional space to accommodate them, a driver could indicate this by tapping on the vehicle roofs. Another common message that drivers could signal to hitchhikers—who usually sought to travel long distances, distances too far to walk in a reasonable amount of time—was that the driver's destinations were located nearby—and of little use to the hitchhiker—by pointing at the ground for a few seconds.

==Legal status==
[[Image:US no hitchhiking signs.svg|thumb|225px|Two of the signs used in the United States, forbidding hitchhiking]]
Hitchhiking is a historically common ([[Autonomy|autonomous]]) practice worldwide and hence there are very few places in the world where laws exist to restrict it. However, a minority of countries have laws that restrict hitchhiking at certain locations.&lt;ref&gt;Nwanna, p.573&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, for example, some local governments have laws outlawing hitchhiking, on the basis of drivers' and hitchhikers' safety. In 1946, [[New Jersey]] arrested and imprisoned a hitchhiker, leading to intervention by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |authorlink= |title=So You Won't Talk, Huh? |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,777285,00.html |quote=In her cell, Susan learned that it also (technically) forbids hitchhiking, and demands (by a law passed in 1799) that strangers be able to give a good account of themselves.... Attorney James A. Major of the American Civil Liberties Union demanded that she be given a new trial.  |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=18 November 1946 |accessdate=27 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Canada]], several highways have restrictions on hitchhiking, particularly in [[British Columbia]] and the [[400-series highways (Ontario)|400-series highways]] in Ontario. In all countries in Europe, it is legal to hitchhike and in some places even encouraged.  However, worldwide, even where hitchhiking is permitted, laws forbid hitchhiking where pedestrians are banned, such as the [[Autobahn]] ([[Germany]]), [[Autostrade of Italy|Autostrade]] ([[Italy]]), [[motorway]]s (United Kingdom and continental Europe) or [[Interstate Highway System|interstate highways]] (United States), although hitchhikers often obtain rides at entrances and truck stops where it is legal at least throughout Europe &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stiffarmingsociety.com/hitchhiking/hitchhiking.htm Hitchhiking Basics]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://asitoughttobe.com/2009/10/19/hitchhiking-trainhopping-part-ii/ Hitchhiking]&lt;/ref&gt; with the exception of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;http://hitchwiki.org/en/Italy&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline==
In 2011, Freakonomics Radio reviewed sparse data about hitchhiking, and identified a decline in hitchhiking in the US since the 1970s, which it attributed to a number of factors, including lower air travel costs due to deregulation, the presence of more money in the economy to pay for travel, more numerous and more reliable cars, and a lack of trust of strangers.&lt;ref name=Huynh&gt;Diana Huynh, [http://freakonomics.com/podcast/where-have-all-the-hitchhikers-gone-a-new-freakonomics-radio-podcast/ "Where Have All the Hitchhikers Gone?"], Freakonomics Radio Podcast (10 October 2011), Accessed 21 September 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Fear of hitchhiking is thought to have been spurred by movies such as ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' and a few real stories of imperiled passengers, notably the [[kidnapping of Colleen Stan]] in California.&lt;ref name=Huynh/&gt; See {{section link||Safety}}, below.

Julian Portis points out&lt;ref&gt;Based on: {{cite thesis |url=http://wesscholar.wesleyan.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2428&amp;context=etd_hon_theses |type=BA thesis |last=Compagni Portis |first=Julian |date=2015 |title=Thumbs Down: America and the Decline of Hitchhiking |publisher=Wesleyan University }}&lt;/ref&gt; that the rise of faster highways, such as freeways, motorways, and expressways, has made hitchhiking more difficult. He adds:

{{quote|The real danger of hitchhiking has most likely remained relatively constant, but the general perception of this danger has increased. ... [O]ur national tolerance for danger has gone down: things that we previously saw as reasonably safe suddenly appeared imminently threatening. This trend is not just isolated to the world of hitchhiking; it has become a pernicious artifact throughout the American cultural conscience.}}

Some British researchers discuss reasons for hitchhiking's decline in the UK, and possible means of reviving it in safer and more-organized forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Sociological Research Online|volume=6|number=3 |author1=Chesters, Graeme |author2=Smith, David |year=2001|title='The Neglected Art of Hitch-hiking: Risk, Trust and Sustainability |url=http://www.socresonline.org.uk/6/3/chesters.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, hitchhikers themselves have started efforts to strengthen their community. One example is the annual [[Hitchgathering]], an event organized by the hitchhikers, for the hitchhikers. Websites such as [[hitchwiki]] and hitchbase are platforms for hitchhikers to share tips and provide a way of looking up good hitchhiking spots around the world.

* Asking for rides at gas stations instead of signaling at the roadside.
* Refusing rides from [[Driving under the influence|impaired drivers]].
* Hitchhiking during daylight hours.
* Trusting one's instincts. (See also ''[[The Gift of Fear]]''.)
* Traveling with another hitchhiker. This measure decreases the likelihood of harm by a factor of six.&lt;ref&gt;Based on: {{cite thesis|url=http://wesscholar.wesleyan.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2428&amp;context=etd_hon_theses#page=44 |type=BA thesis |last=Compagni Portis |first=Julian |date=2015 |title=Thumbs Down: America and the Decline of Hitchhiking |publisher=Wesleyan University |page=44 }} '''Citing:''' {{cite news|title=California Crimes And Accidents Associated With Hitchhiking |url=http://bernd.wechner.info/Hitchhiking/CHP/body.html |publisher=California Highway Patrol |deadurl=yes |accessdate=9 February 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629131814/http://bernd.wechner.info/Hitchhiking/CHP/body.html |archivedate=29 June 2016 |date=February 1974 |at=Table 18 |df=dmy-all }} Also available as [https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/18834NCJRS.pdf a PDF.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

Please note: http://enwp.org/WP:NOTHOWTO forbids "instructing the reader in the [[imperative mood]]" but seems to allow "describing to the reader how other people [...] do something". Anyway, the above-recommended safety practices briefly summarize lessons from countless hours of safe and unsafe experiences from various hitchhikers. I think that, by doing so, the four lines significantly improve the section; please see http://enwp.org/WP:IAR.

==Around the world==
[[File:Hitching out of Jerusalem.JPG|thumb|275px|left|[[Orthodox Jews]] tremping in [[Jerusalem]]]]

===Cuba===
In [[Cuba]], picking up hitchhikers is mandatory for government vehicles, if passenger space is available. Hitchhiking is encouraged, as Cuba has few cars, and hitch hikers use designated spots. Drivers pick up waiting riders on a first come, first served basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kwintessential.co.uk/articles/cuba/Cuba-Hitchhiking-Guide/255 Cuba Hitchhiking Guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127044805/http://www.kwintessential.co.uk/articles/cuba/Cuba-Hitchhiking-Guide/255 |date=27 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
{{main article|Hitchhiking in Israel}}
In [[Israel]], hitchhiking is commonplace at designated locations called ''trempiyadas'' ({{Hebrew|טרמפיאדה}} in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], derived from the “[[German language|German]]” ''trampen'').  Travelers soliciting rides, called ''trempists'', wait at trempiyadas, typically junctions of highways or main roads outside of a city.

===Nepal===
In Nepal, hitchhiking is very common in rural areas. Many do not own cars so hitchhiking is a common practice especially in and around villages.

===Netherlands===
[[Image:Hitchhiker sign amsterdam amstel.jpg|thumb|right|167px|Hitchhiking (called ''liften'') is legal in the [[Netherlands]]. This sign indicates a good place to get a lift.]]

In the [[Netherlands]], hitchhiking is legal and official signs indicate where one may wait for a ride.  These designated hitchhiking locations are called ''liftershalte'' or ''liftplaats'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], and they are particularly common in university towns.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Verhart. [http://www.franknature.nl/hitchhike/hitchhikeen.htm Lifts (ad-hoc carpooling) in Netherlands.] 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hitch-hiking.org/liftershalte.htm The Liftershalte: Hitchhiking in the Netherlands.]&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear left}}

===Poland===
Hitchhiking in [[People's Republic of Poland|Poland]] has a long history and is still popular. It was legalised and formalised  in 1957 so hitchhikers could buy booklets including coupons from travel agencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autostopem.net/g-12-ksiazeczki_autostopu_78__81.html booklets]&lt;/ref&gt; These coupons were given to drivers who took hitchhikers. By the end of each season drivers who collected the highest number of coupons could exchange them for prizes, and others took part in a lottery. This so-called "Akcja Autostop" was popular till the end of the 1970s, but the sale of the booklet was discontinued in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Jakub Czupryński (red.), "Autostop polski. PRL i współczesność", Korporacja Ha!art, Kraków 2005. {{ISBN|83-89911-18-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ireland ===
Hitchhiking in Ireland is legal, unless it takes place on motorways. A backpacker will most likely still get a lift if the car has enough space to park. Local police ([[Garda Síochána|Gardai]]) usually let backpackers get away with a verbal warning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hitchwiki.org/en/Ireland|title=Ireland - Hitchwiki: the Hitchhiker's guide to Hitchhiking|website=hitchwiki.org|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Hitchhiking became a common method of traveling during the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]].
[[File:Slug Line.gif|thumb|left|A "slug line" of passengers waiting for rides in the US]]
Warnings of the [[Stranger danger|potential dangers of picking up hitchhikers]] were publicized to drivers, who were advised that some hitchhikers would rob drivers and, in some cases, sexually assault or murder them. Other warnings were publicized to the hitchhikers themselves, alerting them to the same types of crimes being carried out by drivers. Still, hitchhiking was part of the American psyche and many people continued to stick out their thumbs, even in states where the practice had been outlawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dooling, Michael C. |title=Clueless in New England: The Unsolved Disappearances of Paula Welden, Connie Smith and Katherine Hull|publisher=The Carrollton Press|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, hitchhiking is legal in 44 of the 50 states,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/hitchhike-across-united-states/|title=14 Ways to Safely Hitchhike Across the United States|date=2014-06-09|work=Nomadic Matt's Travel Site|access-date=2017-11-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hitchwiki.org/en/United_States_of_America|title=United States of America - Hitchwiki: the Hitchhiker's guide to Hitchhiking|website=hitchwiki.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; provided that the hitchhiker is not standing in the roadway or otherwise hindering the normal flow of traffic. Even in states where hitchhiking is illegal, hitchhikers are rarely ticketed. For example, the [[Wyoming Highway Patrol]] approached 524 hitchhikers in 2010, but only eight of them were cited (hitchhiking was subsequently legalized in Wyoming in 2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Laura Hancock |url=http://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/wyoming-senate-committee-debates-advances-hitchhiking-bill/article_d18dfcdb-9125-5f9e-8201-b9eba3fedb07.html |title=Wyoming Senate committee debates, advances hitchhiking bill |publisher=Casper Star-Tribune |date=13 January 2013 |accessdate=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In several urban areas, a variation of hitchhiking called [[slugging]] occurs, motivated by [[High-occupancy vehicle lane|HOV]] lanes.

==Controversy==
In November 2012, a report by [[human rights]] and digital media research lab [[Citizen Lab]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Canadian Connection: One Year Later|url=https://citizenlab.org/2012/11/the-canadian-connection-one-year-later/|publisher=[[Citizen Lab]]|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that HostDime was among a handful of American companies selling hosting services to the [[Syrian government]] in direct opposition of an executive order from President [[Barack Obama]]. This sanctions order expressly prohibits transactions with certain governments without [[United States Treasury Department]] approval. The story was picked up by ''[[The New York Times]]'' in late November.&lt;ref name=nyc&gt;{{cite news|title=Official Syrian Web Sites Hosted in U.S.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/30/world/middleeast/official-syrian-web-sites-hosted-in-us.html|accessdate=30 October 2014|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dennis Henry, the Vice President of HostDime Operations,&lt;ref name=nyc /&gt; revealed in ''The New York Times'' story that the website in question, Syria’s Ministry of Religious Affairs, was hosted by a customer who leased a server in their data center.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3764">'''Hydrogen pinch''' analysis (HPA) is a [[hydrogen]] management method that originates from the concept of heat [[pinch analysis]]. HPA is a systematic technique for reducing hydrogen consumption and hydrogen generation through integration of hydrogen-using activities or processes in the [[petrochemical industry]], [[petroleum refineries]] hydrogen distribution networks and hydrogen purification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aspentech.com/publication_files/PTQ_Spring_2003_Hydrogen_Optimization.pdf Hydrogen optimization at minimal investment]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principle==
A mass analysis is done by representing the purity and flowrate for each stream from the hydrogen consumers (sinks), such as [[hydrotreater]]s, [[hydrocracker]]s, [[isomerization]] units and [[lubricant]] plants and the hydrogen producers (sources), such as hydrogen plants and [[naphtha]] reformers, streams from [[hydrogen purifier]]s, [[membrane reactor]]s, [[pressure swing adsorption]] and [[continuous distillation]] and off-gas streams from low- or high-pressure separators. The source-demand diagram shows bottlenecks, surplus or shortages. The hydrogen pinch is the purity at which the hydrogen network has neither hydrogen surplus nor deficit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfe.admin.ch/php/modules/publikationen/stream.php?extlang=en&amp;name=en_23130289.pdf Pinch Analysis-]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfe.admin.ch/php/modules/publikationen/stream.php?extlang=en&amp;name=en_23130289.pdf Pinch Analysis-]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the analysis REFOPT from the Centre for Process Integration at [[The University of Manchester]] is used as a tool for process integration with which the process is optimized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceas.manchester.ac.uk/research/centres/centreforprocessintegration/software/packages/refopt/ REFOPT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225122544/http://www.ceas.manchester.ac.uk/research/centres/centreforprocessintegration/software/packages/refopt/ |date=2008-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The methodology was also developed into commercial software by companies such as [[Bodo Linnhoff#Linnhoff March Ltd|Linnhoff March]] and [[Aspen Technology|AspenTech]]. The Aspen product incorporated the work of Nick Hallale (formerly a lecturer at University of Manchester) and was the first method to consider multiple components, rather than a pseudo-binary mixture of hydrogen and methane.

==History==
The first assessment based on cost and value composite curves of hydrogen resources of a hydrogen network was proposed by Tower et al. (1996). Alves  developed the hydrogen pinch analysis approach based on the concept of heat [[pinch analysis]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aidic.it/pres09/webpapers/203Ahmad.pdf Multi-period hydrogen management] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722023424/http://www.aidic.it/pres09/webpapers/203Ahmad.pdf |date=2011-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nick Hallale and Fang Liu extended this original work, adding pressure constraints and mathematical programming for optimisation. This was followed by developments at AspenTech, producing commercial software for industrial application.

'''Industrialisation''' or '''industrialization''' is the period of social and economic change that transforms a human group from an [[agrarian society]] into an [[industrial society]], involving the extensive re-organisation of an [[economy]] for the purpose of [[manufacturing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = O'Sullivan |first=Arthur |authorlink = Arthur O'Sullivan (economist)|first2=Steven M. |last2=Sheffrin |title = Economics: Principles in Action |publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall |year = 2003 |location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey 07458 |page = 472 |isbn = 0-13-063085-3 |oclc=50237774}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As industrial workers' incomes rise, markets for consumer goods and services of all kinds tend to expand and provide a further stimulus to industrial [[investment]] and [[economic growth]].

==Background==
The first transformation to an industrial economy from an agricultural one, known as the [[Industrial Revolution]], took place from the mid-18th to early 19th century in certain areas in [[Europe]] and North America; starting in Great Britain, followed by Belgium, Germany, and France.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, Emma, A short History of the British Industrial Revolution. In 1850 over 50 percent of the British lived and worked in cities. London: Palgrave (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Characteristics of this early industrialisation were technological progress, a shift from rural work to industrial labor, financial investments in new industrial structure, and early developments in class consciousness and theories related to this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/198/bok%25253A978-1-137-56112-1.pdf?originUrl=http%253A%252F%252Flink.springer.com%252Fbook%252F10.1007%252F978-1-137-56112-1&amp;token2=exp=1474656192~acl=%252Fstatic%252Fpdf%252F198%252Fbok%2525253A978-1-137-56112-1.pdf%253ForiginUrl%253Dhttp%25253A%25252F%25252Flink.springer.com%25252Fbook%25252F10.1007%25252F978-1-137-56112-1*~hmac=415eec3d9518409bfb61b21af50f5a3995b267138d79b0f8af6f6ce6f9920351|title=Sustainable Industrialization in Africa - Springer|website=download.springer.com|access-date=2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later commentators have called this the First Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Pollard, Sidney: Peaceful Conquest.The Industrialisation of Europe 1760–1970, Oxford 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "[[Second Industrial Revolution]]" labels the later changes that came about in the mid-19th century after the refinement of the [[steam engine]], the invention of the [[internal combustion engine]], the harnessing of [[electric power|electricity]] and the construction of canals, railways and electric-power lines. The invention of the [[assembly line]] gave this phase a boost.
Coal mines, steelworks, and textile factories replaced homes as the place of work.

==Social consequences==
{{Expand section|date=November 2010}}

===Urbanisation===
{{Main|Urbanization|l1=Urbanisation}}

As the Industrial Revolution was a shift from the agrarian society, hence people migrated from villages in search of jobs to places where factories were set up. This shifting of rural people led to urbanisation and rise in the population of the towns. The concentration of labour into factories has increased urbanisation and the size of settlements, to serve and house the factory workers.

====Exploitation====
{{Main|Exploitation of labour|Exploitation of natural resources}}
Workers have to either leave their families or bring them along in order to work in the towns and cities where these industries are found.

===Changes in family structure===
The family structure changes with industrialisation. The sociologist [[Talcott Parsons]] noted that in pre-industrial societies there is an [[extended family]] structure spanning many generations who probably remained in the same location for generations. In industrialised societies the [[nuclear family]], consisting of only parents and their growing children, predominates. Families and children reaching adulthood are more mobile and tend to relocate to where jobs exist. Extended family bonds become more tenuous.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blacksacademy.net/content/3236.html ''The effect of industrialisation on the family, Talcott Parsons, the isolated nuclear family.''] Blacks Academy. Educational Database . Accessed April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current situation==
{{Confusing|date=March 2008}}

The green, red, and blue components of the colours of the countries represent the percentages for the agriculture, industry, and services sectors respectively.]]

{{As of | 2018}} the "[[international development]] community" ([[World Bank]], [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD)]], many United Nations departments, and some{{which?|date=January 2018}} other organisations){{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} endorses development policies like water purification or [[primary education]] and [[South-South Cooperation| co-operation amongst third world communities]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/ United Nations Millennium Development Goals]. Un.org (2008-05-20). Retrieved on 2013-07-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Some members of the [[economic communities]] do not consider contemporary industrialisation policies as being adequate to the [[Global South|global south]] (Third World countries) or beneficial in the longer term, with the perception that they may only create [[inefficiency|inefficient]] local industries unable to compete in the [[free trade|free-trade]] dominated political order which industrialisation has fostered.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} [[Environmentalism]] and [[Green politics]] may represent more visceral reactions to industrial growth. Nevertheless, repeated examples in history of apparently successful industrialisation (Britain, Soviet Union, South Korea, China, etc) may make conventional industrialisation seem like an attractive or even natural path forward, especially as populations grow, [[consumerism | consumerist]] expectations rise and agricultural opportunities diminish.

The relationships among [[International Development#International Economic Inequality|economic growth, employment, and poverty reduction]] are complex. Higher [[productivity]], it is argued{{by whom?|date=January 2018}}, may lead to lower [[employment rate | employment]] (see [[jobless recovery]]).&lt;ref name=ODI2&gt;Claire Melamed, Renate Hartwig and Ursula Grant 2011. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5752&amp;title=jobs-growth-poverty-employment Jobs, growth and poverty: what do we know, what don't we know, what should we know?] {{webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110520045610/http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5752&amp;title=jobs-growth-poverty-employment |date= 20 May 2011 }} London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;
There are differences across [[economic sector | sector]]s, whereby manufacturing is less able than the [[tertiary sector]] to accommodate both increased productivity and employment opportunities; more than 40% of the world's employees are "[[working poor]]", whose incomes fail to keep themselves and their families above the $2-a-day [[poverty line]].&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt; There is also a phenomenon of [[deindustrialisation]], as in the former [[Soviet Union|USSR]] countries' transition to market economies, and the [[agriculture sector]] is often the key sector in absorbing the resultant unemployment.&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt;

A '''lightbulb socket''', '''light socket''', '''lamp socket''' or '''lampholder''' is a device which mechanically supports and provides electrical connections for a compatible electric [[Lamp (electrical component)|lamp]]. Sockets allow lamps to be safely and conveniently replaced (re-lamping). There are many different standards for lampholders, including early ''de facto'' standards and later standards created by various [[standards bodies]]. Many of the later standards conform to a general coding system in which a socket type is designated by a letter or abbreviation followed by a number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Advantages of Using LED Verlichting|work=The Difference of Connections|url=http://www.ledgu10dimbaar.nl/website/index.php?TreeItem=391161&amp;NewsItem=28097|publisher=LED Spots &amp; LED Inbouwspots|accessdate=16 August 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130816132543/http://www.ledgu10dimbaar.nl/website/index.php?TreeItem=391161&amp;NewsItem=28097|archivedate=16 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common type of sockets for [[mains electricity]] are [[Edison screw]]s, used in continental Europe and North America, while [[bayonet mount]]s dominate in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries and in the automotive industry. [[Fluorescent lamps]] typically require a two-pin, unthreaded socket.

Not all lamps require a socket. For example, some miniature lamps have wire leads suitable for direct connection to screw terminals or other wires, and some reflector lamps provide screw terminals for electrical connections.

==History==
Early experimental incandescent lamps employed wire leads which had to be connected to screw terminals, but this was inconvenient for commercial use. The Edison organization{{clarify|date=October 2018}} used simple wooden receptacles with internal copper strips for lamps on the commercial steamship ''[[SS Columbia (1880)|SS Columbia]]'', the first ship to use electric light bulbs. These sockets included key switches{{clarify|date=October 2018}}, but required bulbs to be mounted upright.

The Edison organization developed a screw-base in 1880 which was initially made of wood but later made of plaster of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Friedel, Paul Israel, ''Edison's Electric Light: Biography of an Invention'', Rutgers University Press, 1986, {{ISBN|0-8135-1118-6}}, pp. 169-171&lt;/ref&gt; Many competitive designs of lamps and sockets appeared in the early era of incandescent lighting, which often were incompatible with other designs.

==Construction and materials==
The construction of a lampholder socket defines and limits its intended use. Ceramic insulation can withstand considerably higher [[operating temperature]]s than bakelite or other plastics. The electrical components and wires must be designed to carry the intended current plus a safety factor.

The contact surface area, thickness and conductivity of the metal, connection methods and maximum operating temperature must all be considered in the design of a new socket. In addition, mechanical factors such as shape of the socket, fixture mounting and attachment, lamp support, ease of re-lamping and total cost of manufacture must be considered. Sockets designed for ordinary household and industrial use have much more design leeway than those used in precision applications.

The lampholder must be located far enough from the filament that the metals with the lowest melting point will remain solid. Historically this metal was a tin/lead [[solder]] whose melting point might be as low as 180&amp;nbsp;°C (360&amp;nbsp;°F).  Due to the thermal changes from ambient temperature to full operating temperature, the design of a socket must allow for a considerable amount of expansion and contraction. Spring elements are required to accommodate these dimensional changes. However, the temperature at which a metal loses its spring is far below the melting point. This is why some older sockets that no longer work can be restored by prying up the base spring slightly.

Lampholder failures are usually caused by mechanical abuse or by overheating. A socket with a built-in switch is far more likely to fail in normal use as the switch parts wear out. Insulation failures are usually caused by impacts or by difficulty inserting or removing a lamp. Sockets used outdoors or in damp areas often suffer from corrosion which can cause the lamp to "stick" in the socket and attempts to change a lamp can result in breakage of either the lamp or the lampholder. The corrosion is not only environmentally produced but may be a result of the current flowing through the parts when there is appreciable resistance between the parts. Fixtures in such environments may require gaskets or other waterproofing methods to prevent buildup of moisture in the socket area.

==Edison screw bases==
[[File:Light bulb socket E26 three way.jpg|thumb|upright|A standard American three-way lightbulb socket]]

* E14 European
* E17 Intermediate

* E27 Medium
* E39 Mogul 
* E40 Mogul 
* 3-Way (modified medium or mogul socket with additional ring contact for 3-way lamps)
* Skirted (PAR-38)

The light bulb commonly used since the early 20th century for general-purpose lighting applications, with a pear-like shape and an Edison screw base, is referred to as an "[[A-series light bulb]]." This most common general purpose bulb type would be classed as "A19/E26" or the metric version "A60/E27".

With bi-post bases, lamp orientation is fixed so filament will always be in the focal plane. Filament configurations such as the C13D (coiled, zig-zagged) emit far more light perpendicular to the zig-zag than parallel to it.
*Mogul bi-post (G38) can handle up to 100 amps and is used with searchlights and film &amp; stage lighting fixtures of 1000 watts or larger. Incandescent, halogen and HMI light sources use this design.
*Medium bi-post (G22) is used with film &amp; stage lighting fixtures between 250 and 1000 watts.
*Mini bi-post (G4-G6)

Common types:
*G4 - 4 mm pin spacing
**&lt;small&gt;GU4 &amp; GZ4 - are same as G4 and only denote what lamp mount clip is needed to hold the actual light bulb in place&lt;/small&gt;

== Bi-pin connector ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}
[[Image:Halogenmetalldampflampe.jpg|thumb| [[Metal halide lamp]] with G8.5 base ]]
{{main|Bi-pin connector}}
* Medium bi-pin is used on each end of a T12 fluorescent lamp
* Mini bi-pin is used with MR16 halogen lamps

The two-pin socket is an update of the bi-post design with smaller pins designed to reduce the cost of manufacture. The 1000-watt [[FEL lamp|FEL]] medium two-pin base halogen lamp allows designers to insert the lamp into the end of the ellipsoidal reflector through a smaller hole than previously possible with conventional incandescent lamps. This improves efficiency compared to the older side-inserted lamp or a double-ended lamp which requires two holes. One variation is the polarized two-pin socket – used primarily in [[projector]]s, which defines the exact positioning of the filament on one side. This improves the "point source" characteristic necessary for building complex optical systems.

Another facet of the two-pin design is that many new designs of lamps use baseless glass envelopes. The wire leads are thickened and crimped in the glass envelope of the lamp base. The MR16 is an example of this design; the actual lamp is inserted into the reflector with the leads sticking out and a ceramic paste used to glue it in.

==Wedge base==
{{main|Wedge base}}
Miniature lamps may have a [[wedge base]] made of glass or plastic. The base may be an extension of the glass envelope of the bulb, with the wire leads of the lamp folded up at the base.  Some wedge bases are made of plastic and slipped over the wire leads. A wedge base holds the lamp by spring compression in the socket. The lamp is inserted and removed without twisting. Wedge base lamps are widely used in automotive applications, and many [[Christmas lights]] strings use plastic wedge-based bulbs.

==Fluorescent tubular lamp standards==
{{main|Fluorescent-lamp formats}}Fluorescent Linear Tube Light bulbs are measured in ⅛s of inches. So a T12 fluorescent is 12 ⅛s of an inch in diameter or 12/8 = 1.50"
* T4 - 4/8 or 0.500" in diameter
* T5 - 5/8 or 0.625" in diameter
* T8 - 8/8 or 1.00" in diameter
* T10 - 10/8 or 1.25" in diameter
* T12 - 12/8 or 1.50" in diameter

Some of the above base styles are now obsolete. The trend in recent years{{When|date=August 2013}} has been to design newer bases to reduce waste of raw materials and simplify the replacement process.

==Standards==
The United States standard for lamp sockets is published by [[ANSI]] and developed by [[NEMA]]. It is standard number C81.64, titled ''Guidelines and General Information for Electric Lamp Bases, Lampholders, and Gauges'' and outlines the dimensions and tolerances of standardized lamp sockets.  Lamp bases are standardized in C81.61 ''Standard for Electrical Lamp Bases - Specifications for Bases (Caps) for Electric Lamps''.&lt;ref&gt;ANSI Std. C81.61-2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Both standards are harmonized with IEC standard 600061 and include dimensional data sheets as printed in the IEC standard.

'''Academicians''' are distinguished members of the '''[[National Academy of Science and Technology]]'''[[National Academy of Science and Technology| ]](''abbreviated as'' '''NAST'''), the highest recognition and scientific advisory body of the [[Philippines]]. The first Academicians were appointed in 1978 by President [[Ferdinand E. Marcos]]. Possible members are distinguished scientists in their own field which are nominated by members of the scientific community. The current NAST members deliberate on the membership of an individual following strict rules and regulations. From their ranks, the next [[National Scientist of the Philippines]] would be nominated and approved by the [[President of the Philippines]].

This article presents a '''list of discoveries''' and includes famous [[discovery (observation)|observations]]. ''Discovery'' observations form acts of detecting and learning something. Discovery observations are acts in which something is found and given a productive insight. The observation assimilates the knowledge of a phenomenon or the recording of data using instruments.

'''Manifold System''' is a [[geographic information system]] (GIS) software package developed by '''Manifold Software Limited''' that runs on [[Microsoft Windows]]. Manifold System handles both vector and raster data, includes spatial SQL, a built-in [[Internet Map Server]] (IMS), and other general GIS features. Manifold System Release 8.00 was the first commercial product to include massively parallel GPGPU functionality utilizing NVIDIA GPUs, implemented within approximately 35 functions used in the raster transformation system.   Manifold System has an active user community with a mailing list and online forums.

== History==
The development team for Manifold was created in 1993 to optimize mathematics libraries for a [[Massively parallel|massively-parallel]] supercomputer created in a joint venture between [[Intel Corporation]] and the [[US Department of Defense]].  The team subsequently embarked on a plan to create and sell mathematics libraries, including the General Graph Facilities library (GGF) and the [[Computational Geometry]] Library (CGL), under the name of the Center for Digital Algorithms.

A series of "workbench" products were created to help teach customers the operation of algorithms in the libraries using visual means. Road networks and geometric data in geographic contexts were used to provide visual familiarity and interest, in effect creating a GIS-like product. In 1997 and 1998 customers asked for a true GIS  product based on the workbench products and development of Manifold System was launched.  The company soon changed its name to Manifold Software Limited to match the new product's name.

==Manifold System releases==
Manifold System was first sold in January 1998 as Release 3.00.  Releases 3.00 and 4.00 were heavily weighted to analytics, with many tools for abstract graph theory analysis but a very limited GIS toolset.  At the request of GIS users and resellers, Release 4.50 emphasized general GIS features of broader interest and emerged as Manifold's first commercial GIS, a typical vector GIS more or less equivalent to classic vector GIS packages such as [[ArcView 3.x]] or [[MapInfo Professional]].

The Release 5.00 series in 2001 and 2002 integrated display and editing of raster images and surfaces, including terrain elevation surfaces, and both 2D and 3D rendering.  The 5.x series also introduced an integrated [[Internet Map Server]] (IMS) and the first Enterprise editions of Manifold System allowing collaboration by teams using shared components.  The 5.x series also introduced a new spatial SQL and fuzzy logic using the Decision Support System.

Releases since 2003 include 5.50, 6.00 (two major feature upgrades via service pack), 6.50, 7.00 and 7x. 6.50 introduced image tiling from [[TerraServer-USA|Terraserver]] and [[Open Geospatial Consortium|OGC]] [[Web Map Service|WMS]] image servers using Manifold as a client and extended IMS support to include OGC WMS when using Manifold as a server. 7.00 further extended IMS to include OGC WFS-T and image server functionality as well.

Release 7.00 was issued in May 2006 and followed up by Release 7x in the next three months.  7x was released in two flavors: 32-bit and 64-bit.

Release 7.00 introduced direct support for [[Oracle Spatial]] (vector drawings, raster images and raster surfaces) and included concurrent multiuser editing capability for Oracle and a variety of other databases, including [[IBM DB2|DB2]] and [[Microsoft SQL Server]]. 7.00 introduced multiprocessor support with multithreaded rendering of image libraries, multithreaded connections to DBMS providers and use of multiple processors in other areas as well.

7.00 also introduced the Manifold Image Server interface API, allowing users to create modules that enable usage within Manifold of image servers such as [[Virtual Earth]], [[Google Maps]], [[Yahoo]], [[Ask.com|Ask]] and others.   Open source image server modules have been published by the user community in both 32-bit and 64-bit versions that enable automatic fetching and tiling of either satellite images or street map images from various image servers.

Release 8.00 was issued in the summer of 2007 and introduced 420 improvements.  8.00 expanded support for direct use of spatial DBMS beyond Oracle to include IBM DB2 with Spatial Extender, PostgreSQL / PostGIS and pre-releases of Microsoft's SQL Server 2008 spatial product available in 2007.  8.00 also introduced a Manifold-written spatial extender for Microsoft SQL Server 2005 as well as generic spatial DBMS capability from Manifold enabling spatial DBMS storage of vectors and rasters in any DBMS providing binary storage capability.

Release 8.00 became the first GIS product to include support for NVIDIA [[CUDA]] technology, in which massively-parallel architectures utilized in NVIDIA GPU cards, employing up to hundreds of stream processors per card, can be utilized to execute general purpose GIS code for computations on rasters.  Typical speed increases when using NVIDIA CUDA reduce the time required for complex surface calculations in Manifold from minutes to seconds.  For its use of NVIDIA CUDA Manifold System won the 2008 Geospatial Innovator Award at the GeoTec 2008 conference.

8.00 was updated through 2008 to improve support for PostgreSQL/PostGIS, to support final production releases of Microsoft SQL Server 2008 and to support new Windows releases through Windows Server 2008 x64. As new Windows were issued Manifold verified compatibility for Release 8 through all Windows editions up to current Windows 10 and related Windows server editions, both in 32 bit and x64. 

In December 2015 Manifold.net announced that Manifold's parallel database engine for OEMs, Radian, would be the foundation for future releases of Manifold System GIS, and provided a road map for Radian Studio and Manifold Release 9 implementations in 2016. Beta testing for Radian commenced in 2016 with a first release of Radian Studio in February 2017.  

A series of updates for 8.00 were issued in 2017 to add integration with ODBC access to Radian data sources.  This gave Release 8 the ability to connect, through Radian, to any data source Radian can use, expanding Release 8 connectivity to data sources 8.00 previously could not access, such as MrSID, ESRI file geodatabases, numerous GDAL/OGR sources and similar.

==User community==
Later versions have benefited greatly from community involvement via online discussion and beta testing.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} From July 2002 to May 2017 over 4000 new items have been cited in release notes, many of which originated in the user community.

The online Georeference forum was started by David Brubacher and William Howell in 2004 and incorporated into the manifold.net site in January 2006 at forum.manifold.net&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080516175325/http://forum.manifold.net/ forum.manifold.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Baumwoll-Erntemaschine auf Feld.jpeg|thumb|A [[cotton picker]] at work.  The first successful models were introduced in the mid-1940s and each could do the work of 50 hand pickers.]]
'''Mechanised agriculture''' is the process of using [[agricultural machinery]] to [[Mechanization|mechanise]] the work of [[agriculture]], greatly increasing farm worker [[productivity]]. In modern times, powered machinery has replaced many farm jobs formerly carried out by [[manual labour]] or by [[working animal]]s such as [[ox]]en, [[horse]]s and [[mule]]s.

The entire [[history of agriculture]] contains many examples of the use of tools, such as the [[hoe (tool)|hoe]] and the [[plough]]. But the ongoing integration of [[machine]]s since the [[Industrial Revolution]] has allowed farming to become much less [[labor intensity|labour-intensive]].

Current mechanised agriculture includes the use of [[tractor]]s, [[truck]]s, [[combine harvester]]s, countless [[list of agricultural machinery|types of farm implements]], aeroplanes and helicopters (for [[aerial application]]), and other vehicles. [[Precision agriculture]] even uses [[computer]]s in conjunction with [[satellite imagery]] and [[satellite navigation]] (GPS guidance) to increase yields.

Mechanisation was one of the large factors responsible for [[urbanisation]] and industrial economies.  Besides improving production efficiency, mechanisation encourages large scale production and sometimes can improve the quality of farm produce. On the other hand, it can displace unskilled farm labour and can cause [[environmental degradation]] (such as [[pollution]], [[deforestation]], and [[soil erosion]]), especially if it is applied shortsightedly rather than [[holism|holistically]].

==History==

[[File:Batteuse 1881.jpg|thumb|Threshing machine in 1881.  Steam engines were also used to power threshing machines. Today both reaping and threshing are done with a [[combine harvester]].]]

[[Jethro Tull (agriculturist)|Jethro Tull]]'s [[seed drill]] (ca. 1701) was a mechanical seed spacing and depth placing device that increased crop yields and saved seed. It was an important factor in the [[British Agricultural Revolution]].&lt;ref name ="McNeil1990"&gt;{{cite book |title=An Encyclopedia of the History of Technology |last=McNeil |first=Ian|authorlink= |year=1990 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=0-415-14792-1 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the beginning of agriculture threshing was done by hand with a [[flail]], requiring a great deal of labour. The [[threshing machine]], which was invented in 1794 but not widely used for several more decades, simplified the operation and allowed the use of animal power. Before the invention of the [[grain cradle]] (ca. 1790) an able bodied labourer could reap about one quarter acre of wheat in a day using a sickle. It was estimated that for each of Cyrus McCormick's horse-pulled [[reaper]]s (ca. 1830s) freed up five men for military service in the US Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hounshell1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later innovations included raking and [[reaper-binder|binding]] machines. By 1890 two men and two horses could cut, rake and bind 20 acres of wheat per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In the 1880s the reaper and threshing machine were combined into the [[combine harvester]]. These machines required large teams of horses or mules to pull. Steam power was applied to threshing machines in the late 19th century.  There were steam engines that moved around on wheels under their own power for supplying temporary power to stationary threshing machines. These were called ''road engines,'' and Henry Ford seeing one as a boy was inspired to build an automobile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Ford| first1 =Henry| author1-link = Henry Ford|last2= Samuel| title = My Life and Work: An autobiography of Henry Ford| year = 1922| url = http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=22786&amp;pageno=45| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With internal combustion came the first modern tractors in the early 1900s, becoming more popular after the [[Fordson tractor]]  (ca. 1917). At first reapers and combine harvesters were pulled by teams of horses or tractors, but in the 1930s self powered combines were developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= A Century of Innovation: Twenty Engineering Achievements That Transformed Our Lives, Chapter 7, Agricultural Mechanization|last=Constable |first=George|authorlink= |author2=Somerville, Bob |year=2003 |publisher=Joseph Henry Press|location=Washington, DC |isbn= 0-309-08908-5 |pages= |url= http://www.greatachievements.org/?id=2955}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Advertising for motorised equipment in farm journals during this era did its best to compete against horse-drawn methods with economic arguments, extolling common themes such as that a tractor "eats only when it works", that one tractor could replace many horses, and that mechanisation could allow one man to get more work done per day than he ever had before. The horse population in the US began to decline in the 1920s after the conversion of agriculture and transportation to internal combustion. Peak tractor sales in the US were around 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Although farmers of corn, wheat, soy, and other commodity crops had replaced most of their workers with harvesting machines and combines by the 1950s enabling them to efficiently cut and gather grains, growers of produce continued to rely on human pickers to avoid the bruising of the product in order to maintain the blemish-free appearance demanded of consumers.&lt;ref name=WSJRobots&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/robots-step-into-new-planting-harvesting-roles-1429781404 Wall Street Journal: "Robots Step Into New Planting, Harvesting Roles - Labor shortage spurs farmers to use robots for handling delicate tasks in the fresh-produce industry" By ILAN BRAT] April 23, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The continuous supply of illegal workers from Latin America that were willing to harvest the crops for low wages further suppressed the need for mechanisation. As the number of illegal workers has continued to decline since reaching its peak in 2007 due to increased border patrols and an improving Mexican economy, the industry is increasing the use of mechanisation.&lt;ref name=WSJRobots /&gt; Proponents argue that mechanisation will boost productivity and help to maintain low food prices while farm worker advocates assert that it will eliminate jobs and will give an advantage to large growers who are able to afford the required equipment.&lt;ref name=WSJRobots /&gt;

As of 2010, approximately 10% of the processing [[orange (fruit)|orange]] acreage in Florida is harvested mechanically, mainly with citrus canopy shaker machines. Mechanization has progressed slowly due to the uncertainty of future economic benefits due to competition from Brazil and the transitory damage to orange trees when they are harvested.&lt;ref name=UCDavisStatus /&gt;

There has been an ongoing transition to mechanical harvesting of cling peaches (mostly used in canning) where the cost of labor is 70 percent of a grower's direct costs. In 2016, 12 percent of the cling peach tonnage from [[Yuba County]] and [[Sutter County]] in California will be mechanically harvested.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.farm2ranch.com/articles/news/641/labor-concerns-lead-peach-growers-look-machines/ Farm 2 ranch magazine: "Labor concerns lead peach growers to look to machines"] August 18, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Fresh peaches destined for direct consumer sales must still be hand-picked.

As of 2007, mechanised harvesting of [[raisins]] is at 45%; however the rate has slowed due to high raisin demand and prices making the conversion away from hand labour less urgent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gRXcOg5bRbgC&amp;pg=PT47&amp;lpg=PT47&amp;dq=asparagus+harvesting+mechanized&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7SahgVz6OW&amp;sig=NWwmwE-gjoP7u4BWtncf1ezl1mI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FYVHUoPUNKvi4APzpIDQAw&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwBzgU#v=onepage&amp;q=asparagus%20harvesting%20mechanized&amp;f=false U.

[[Strawberries]] are a high cost-high value crop with the economics supporting mechanisation. In 2005, picking and hauling costs were estimated at $594 per ton or 51% of the total grower cost. However, the delicate nature of fruit make it an unlikely candidate for mechanisation in the near future.&lt;ref name=UCDavisStatus /&gt; A strawberry harvester developed by Shibuya Seiki and unveiled in Japan in 2013 is able to pick a strawberry every eight seconds. The robot identifies which strawberries are ready to pick by using three separate cameras and then once identified as ready, a mechanised arm snips the fruit free and gently places it in a basket. The robot moves on rails between the rows of strawberries which are generally contained within elevated greenhouses. The machine costs 5 million yen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2013/09/26/business/latest-robot-can-pick-strawberry-fields-forever/#.VT1aUcofqAg Japan Times: "Latest robot can pick strawberry fields forever"] September 26, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; A new strawberry harvester made by Agrobot that will harvest strawberries on raised, hydroponic beds using 60 robotic arms is expected to be released in 2016.&lt;ref name=WSJRobots /&gt;{{update inline|date=January 2018}}

Mechanical harvesting of [[tomato]]es started in 1965 and as of 2010, nearly all processing tomatoes are mechanically harvested.&lt;ref name=UCDavisStatus&gt;[http://migrationfiles.ucdavis.edu/uploads/cf/files/2010-may/huffman-paper-the-status-of-labor-saving-mechanization.pdf University of California Davis Migration Files: "The Status of Labor-saving Mechanization in Fruits and Vegetables" By Wallace E. Huffman] May 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010, 95% of the US processed tomato crop is produced in California.&lt;ref name=UCDavisStatus /&gt; Although fresh market tomatoes have substantial hand harvesting costs (in 2007, the costs of hand picking and hauling were $86 per ton which is 19% of total grower cost), packing and selling costs were more of a concern (at 44% of total grower cost) making it likely that cost saving efforts would be applied there.&lt;ref name=UCDavisStatus /&gt;

According to a 1977 report by the California Agrarian Action Project, during the summer of 1976 in California, many harvest machines had been equipped with a photo-electric scanner that sorted out green tomatoes among the ripe red ones using infrared lights and colour sensors. It worked in lieu of 5,000 hand harvesters causing displacement of innumerable farm labourers as well as wage cuts and shorter work periods. Migrant workers were hit the hardest.&lt;ref name=CAAP&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~schwrtz/SftP/MagazineArchive/SftPv10n1s.pdf|title=No Hands Touch the Land: Automating California Farms|journal=California Agrarian Action Project|date=July 1977|pages=20–28|accessdate=2015-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; To withstand the rigour of the machines, new crop varieties were bred to match the automated pickers. UC Davis Professor G.C. Hanna propagated a thick-skinned tomato called VF-145. But even still, millions were damaged with impact cracks and university breeders produced a tougher and juiceless "square round" tomato. Small farms were of insufficient size to obtain financing to purchase the equipment and within 10 years, 85% of the state's 4,000 cannery
tomato farmers were out of the business. This led to a concentrated tomato industry in California that "now packed 85% of the nation’s tomato products". The monoculture fields fostered rapid pest growth, requiring the use of “more than four million pounds of pesticides each year” which greatly affected the health of the soil, the farm workers, and possibly the consumers.&lt;ref name=CAAP /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3016">'''Mole-Richardson,''' also known as '''Mole''', is a [[stage lighting instrument]] and motion picture lighting manufacturing company originally based in [[Hollywood, California]]. The company was started in 1927 by Sicilian immigrant Pietro "Peter" Mule (changed to Mole). Born November 10, 1891, in the Italian town of Termini Imerese, Palermo, Sicily, he first worked for General Electric (GE) in New York.

In 1927 he began selling incandescent [[tungsten lighting]] to the film industry, which allowed a more natural lighting than the previous [[Arc_lamp#Carbon_arc_lamp|arc lights]]. The new lights were also silent, an advantage for the new [[sound film]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hollywood Glamour: Sex, Power, and Photography, 1925--1939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i-mGv9OTEYsC&amp;pg=PA130|year=2008|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=978-0-549-60639-0|pages=130–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mole-Richardson invented the [[Fresnel lantern|Fresnel Solar Spot]] unit in 1935, adapting the [[fresnel lens|fresnel]] lighthouse lens for use in motion pictures. It won the first of four technical [[Academy Awards]] the company has earned.&lt;ref name="Kroon2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard W. Kroon|title=A/V A to Z: An Encyclopedic Dictionary of Media, Entertainment and Other Audiovisual Terms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HjmNAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA425|date=30 April 2014|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-5740-3|pages=425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], Mole-Richardson concentrated their efforts on developing [[searchlight]]s for battleships, tanks and artillery units to aid the Allied Forces' battle in Europe and the Pacific. In 1945, Peter Mole was invited to light the first [[United Nations]] conference held in San Francisco.{{citeneeded|date=January 2016}}

Peter Mole died on August 2, 1960, very suddenly. His son-in-law, Warren Parker, took over the company. Mole-Richardson Company is now run by two of Warren Parker's four sons and grandchildren of Peter Mole, Larry Mole Parker and Mike Parker.

Mole-Richardson is considered by many to be the staple of motion picture and television lighting in the movie industry today, setting the standard for tungsten fresnel fixtures. However, they do also manufacture [[Hydrargyrum medium-arc iodide lamp|HMI]] (Hydrargyrum Medium-arc Iodide) day-light lighting units. Their lighting is generally recognized by their maroon coloring and "MR" logos.

In August 2015, the company moved to [[Pacoima, Los Angeles|Pacoima neighborhood of Los Angeles, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=WE'RE MOVING!Mole-Richardson Co.12154 Montague St.Pacoima, CA 91331 |publisher=Mole-Richardson Company |date=August 11, 2015 |url=http://mole.com/news/event/WE'RE-MOVINGMole-Richardson-Co.12154-Montague-St.Pacoima-CA-91331 |accessdate=January 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''nasal strip''', '''external nasal dilator strip''' or '''nasal dilator strip''' is a type of adhesive bandage with embedded plastic ribs or splints that is applied across the [[Nasal bone|bridge of the nose]] and sides of the [[nostrils]], to assist in keeping the airway open. They are believed to make breathing easier and for that reason are used during athletic exertion and as an aid to reduce congestion or to prevent snoring.&lt;ref name=Bhardwaj&gt;{{cite web|author=Bhardwaj, Munish |url=http://www.disabled-world.com/artman/publish/nasal-strips.shtml |title=Nasal Strips |publisher=Disabled-world.com |date=2008-08-08 |accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Various studies have not indicated that they have a performance-enhancing effect.&lt;ref name=OKroy&gt;{{cite journal|author=O'Kroy, J.A. |title=Oxygen uptake and ventilatory effects of an external nasal dilator during ergometry |work=Med Sci Sports Exerc |date=August 2000 |volume=32 |issue=8 |pmid=10949017 |pages=1491-5 |doi=
10.1097/00005768-200008000-00019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are also used by [[race horse]] [[horse trainer|trainers]] on horses for similar reasons;  they are thought to reduce airway resistance and lower the risk of [[exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage]] (EIPH), plus reduce fatigue and aid post-race recovery.&lt;ref name=Nuzzo24May&gt;{{cite web|last=Nuzzo|first=Regina |url=http://espn.go.com/horse-racing/story/_/id/10973676/science-california-chrome-nasal-strip-espn-magazine|title=Straight from the horse's nose |publisher=ESPN|accessdate=2014-05-27|date=2014-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human use==
[[File:Andy Studebaker.JPG|thumb|A [[gridiron football]] player wearing a nasal strip]]

In humans, the [[Anatomy of the human nose#External|nasal valve]] is the narrowest part of the nasal aperture and when exercising, this area is subjected to [[Pressure#Negative pressures|negative pressure]] and becomes smaller.&lt;ref name=Peltonin&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rougier.ca/newenglish/pdf/studies/Nozovent16.pdf |title=Effects of the nasal strip and dilator on nasal breathing – a study with healthy subjects |author=Peltonen, Lauri I., et. al. |work=Rhinology |volume=42 |year=2004 |pages=122–125 |format=pdf |accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nasal strips adhere to the skin, holding open the [[anterior nasal aperture]] and prevent it from collapsing.&lt;ref name=stanford&gt;{{cite web |url=http://med.stanford.edu/ohns/sleepsurgery/nasal_surgery.html |title=Stanford Sleep Surgery – Otolaryngology |publisher=Stanford University School of Medicine |date=2008-06-20 |accessdate=2014-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316131904/http://med.stanford.edu/ohns/sleepsurgery/nasal_surgery.html |archivedate=2015-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When properly applied, they lift and widen the space in the nasal passage.  They are a drug-free method to maintain airway flow and are available as an [[over the counter]] product.&lt;ref name=Bhardwaj/&gt; They have no reported side effects other than possible skin irritation from the adhesive.&lt;ref name=Peltonin/&gt;

Studies indicate that they are useful in increasing nasal cavity volume in the front three centimeters of the human nose, and for that purpose could be an alternative to [[Nasal spray|decongestive nose spray]]s, but nasal strips are not particularly helpful for congestion in the [[posterior nasal apertures]].&lt;ref name=Hoyvoll&gt;{{cite journal|author=Høyvoll, L.R., et. al. |title=Effects of an external nasal dilator strip (ENDS) compared to xylometazolin nasal spray |work=Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol |date=November 2007 |volume=264 |issue=11 |pmid=17530269 |doi=10.1007/s00405-007-0345-6 |pages=1289-94}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They also have been shown to reduce snoring loudness and improve quality of sleep.  Subjects wearing the strips in tests indicated that they believed that the strips helped them breathe more easily, and they are of particular interest to those human athletes who have to wear a [[mouthguard]] and need to be able to breathe more through their nostrils than their mouths.  Studies have not necessarily demonstrated that athletic performance is increased, but people wearing them seem to have far less [[dyspnea]] or shortness of breath while exercising.&lt;ref name=overend&gt;{{cite journal|author=Overend, Tom, et. al. |title=External Nasal Dilator Strips Do Not Affect Treadmill Performance in Subjects Wearing Mouthguards |work=Journal of Athletic Training |date=Jan–Mar 2000 |pmc=1323440 |pmid=16558610 |volume=35 |pages=60-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equine use==
[[File:CC nasal strip.jpg|thumb|right|Equine nasal strip worn by California Chrome]]
In horses, they are viewed as helpful because the animals cannot breathe through their mouths, only through their nostrils.  As with humans, the equine design helps keep the nasal valve from collapsing due to the negative pressure created by physical exertion.&lt;ref name=Nuzzo24May/&gt;  However, their primary benefit is to prevent bleeding in the lungs (EIPH), not to directly enhance performance.  The equine version was invented by two veterinarians, James Chiapetta and Edward Blach.  In the 1990s, they were inspired by the human product to attempt to create a similar device for horses.  They had observed horses on [[treadmill]]s and saw that, under exertion, the equine nasal passage also narrowed due to the tissue being sucked in. They worked out a licensing agreement with CNS, the company that manufactured the human "Breathe Right" brand of nasal strips in 1997 (now owned by [[GlaxoSmithKline]]) where the company manufactured the equine form of the nasal strip, and paid royalties to Chiapetta and Blach.  The equine version was first used publicly at the 1999 [[Breeders' Cup]] horse races and the [[2000 Summer Olympics]].  In 2001, they parted ways with CNS and formed their own company, Flair, and in 2008, Chiapetta bought out Blach.&lt;!--this cite to all of paragraph following previous footnote--&gt;&lt;ref name=Kavilanz5June&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kavilanz|first1=Parija|title=Meet the maker of California Chrome's nasal strip|url=http://money.cnn.com/2014/06/05/smallbusiness/california-chrome-nasal-strip/|publisher=CNN Money|accessdate=2014-06-05|date=2014-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pottery gauge''' is one of various tools used in [[pottery]] to ensure that pots thrown on a [[potter's wheel]] are uniform in size or shape.  Some pottery gauges simply ensure that the height and diameter are consistent, others are [[:wikt:template|template]]s or shapers.&lt;ref&gt;''Universal dictionary of the English language'', 1897 [https://books.google.com/books?id=lEzlAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA3709 at Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sachets déshydratants sodepac.JPG|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Sachets containing [[desiccant]]s]]
A '''sachet''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|æ|ʃ|eɪ|}} is a small cloth scented bag filled with [[herb]]s, [[potpourri]], or [[Aroma compound|aromatic ingredients]].&lt;ref&gt;Simmonds, p. 324&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duff, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=Small+municipalities&amp;searchmode=none Online Etymology Dictionary]. ''"small perfumed bag," 1838, from Fr. sachet (12c.), dim. of sac (see sac). A reborrowing of a word that had been used 15c. in the sense "small bag, wallet."''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oster54"&gt;Oster, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; A sachet is also a small porous bag or [[packet (container)|packet]] containing a material intended to interact with its atmosphere;  for example, [[desiccant]]s are usually packed in sachets which are then placed in larger packages.

A sachet can be defined as a small soft bag containing perfumed or sweet-smelling items also referred to as an ''ascent bag,'' ''scent bag'', ''sweet bag'', ''sachet bag'', ''sachet de senteurs'', ''spiced sachet'', ''potpourri sachet'', ''scented sachet'', ''perfume cushion'', ''smelling cushion'', ''scented cushion'', ''fragrant bag'', ''pomander'' and "dream pillow."&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, p. 4080&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sweringen, p. 341&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gasc, p. 500&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tibbins, p. 943&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="remedies"&gt;[http://www.superbherbs.net/remedies3.htm Natural Remedies]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CulturalChina"&gt;[http://traditions.cultural-china.com/en/16Traditions337.html Cultural China] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822202747/http://traditions.cultural-china.com/en/16Traditions337.html |date=2010-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural history ==
During the Chinese [[Warring States period]] a scented sachet was an ornament worn on the body and used to absorb sweat, repel insects and ward off evils.&lt;ref name="CulturalChina"/&gt; In the [[Han Dynasty]] both boys and girls wore sachets and in the [[Tang Dynasty]] and [[Song Dynasty]] scented bags gradually became preferred only by women.&lt;ref name="CulturalChina"/&gt;  A scented sachet became a love token in the [[Qing Dynasty]].&lt;ref name="CulturalChina"/&gt; 

In medieval Europe the sachet was known as a "plague-bag". These were generally  worn around the neck, or dangled from the waist. It was believed that they provided protection against [[parasites]] and [[Miasma theory|miasma]]ta. These "sachets" contained sweet powders, [[Acorus calamus|aromatic calamus]], [[Benzoin (resin)|benzoin]], [[storax]], [[galingale (disambiguation)|galingale]], [[cloves]], and other fragrances from a herb or flower garden.&lt;ref name="Hemphill2426"&gt;Hemphill, pp. 24-26&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabella of Spain]] used fragrant sachets consisting of dried [[rose]] and [[carnation]] petals, [[Orris root|orris]] and [[Acorus calamus|calamus]] root, and other ingredients like powdered [[coriander]] seeds.&lt;ref&gt;Garland, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; In the nineteenth century a sachet filled with [[hops]] was called a "''Pulvinar Humuli''" and used by [[George III of Great Britain]] and [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg]] to help induce sleep.&lt;ref&gt;Gutenberg ebook  [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19352/19352-8.txt Herbal Simples Approved for Modern Uses of Cure]&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, a small cloth bag filled with [[potpourri]] may be laid among garments in a [[Chest of drawers|dresser]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sachet Merriam-Webster definition]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
Scented sachets are for containing odorous substances to be laid among handkerchiefs to perfume them. They are also used to make [[undergarment]]s and outer garments sweet smelling as well as placed amongst [[linens]].&lt;ref&gt;Fettner, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Scented sachets are also hung in closets and cupboards. They are also put into briefcases and luggage. Some are used in stationary packets and others are put under pillows to help one sleep.&lt;ref name="Hemphill2426"/&gt; Scented sachets are "sweet bags" (an old name for a small sachet cloth bag) and are put in automobiles, [[clothes dryer]]s, clothes closets, inside or about children's stuffed animals, on the backs of chairs, and on doorknobs.&lt;ref&gt;Booth, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;
Sachets with herbs like hops and lavender act as a sedative.&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, pp. 322, 333&lt;/ref&gt; These type of sachets are often put in closets and dresser drawers for their scents.&lt;ref&gt;Sisko, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Some "dream pillow" types of scented sachets (i.e. "hop pillows") are made with sleep inducing ingredients like [[humulus|hops]], [[chamomile]], [[Valerian (herb)|valerian]], [[Scutellaria|skullcap]], and [[lavender]] that help promote sleep.&lt;ref name="remedies"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garland, p. 268 ''Pillows stuffed with dried hops are an old treatment for insomnia.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chopra, p. 40 ''A sachet of hops is traditionally placed under a child's pillow to deliver sleep-inducing aromatherapy.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lust, p. 370 ''A small pillow filled with dried hops and slept on is a well-known folk remedy in many European countries for inducing a calm, restful sleep.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HerbalPot-Pourris"&gt;[http://flagandpennants.net/how-to-make-herbal-pot-pourris-sachets-and-pillows How To Make Herbal Pot-Pourris, Sachets And Pillows]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.farmersmarketonline.com/howto23.htm Here's How To Make a Dream Pillow] ''Dream pillows are used to promote restful sleep and pleasant dreams. They are small and flat, placed in a standard pillow, and stuffed with a sachet of calming and sleep-inducing dried herbs... George Washington reportedly used one filled with hops...''&lt;/ref&gt; These scented sachets of aromatic herbs are also referred to as "herb pillows" or "sleep pillows" and are designed to overcome sleeplessness.&lt;ref&gt;Walter, p. 123 ''The "herb pillows" of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (little sacks of aromatic herbs thought to be a remedy for sleeplessness) always included lavender, clovepinks and costmary as principal ingredients.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 111 ''There are several herbs that have a reputation for easing insomnia, and by creating a blend of these leaves and flowers, you can make small "herb pillows" to help you sleep.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murphy-Hiscock, p. 159 ''Sweet Dream Pillow - This pillow is designed to encourage relaxation and soothe restless sleep.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klru.org/ctg/resource/Article/Dream_Pillows/ Dream Pillows]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caldwellpl.org/ajax/ajax.php?q=making-herb-pillows Making herbal pillows]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalexchangestore.org/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=NA5568&amp;gdftrk=gdfV2932_a_7c135_a_7c313_a_7cNA5568 Dream Pillows]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ram's 1606 booklet ''Little Dodoen'' gave a sachet formula to take to bed to help one sleep:
{{cquote|''Take dry rose leaves keep them in a glass which will keep them sweet and then take powder of mints, powder of cloves in a grosse powder. Put the same to the Rose leaves then put all these together in a bag and take that to bed with you and it will cause you to sleep, and it is good to smell unto at other times.''&lt;ref&gt;Rohde, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Certain herbs used in these type sachet "sleep pillows", like hops, have a soporific and a slight narcotic effect.&lt;ref name="Garland229"&gt;Garland, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; These herb filled sachets are even called "dreamtime pillows".&lt;ref&gt;Knapp, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; There are formulas using rosemary seeds to fill sachets and these are to be hung in a bedroom to promote sleep.&lt;ref name="Garland229"/&gt;  The traditional method to treat insomnia with herb filled sachets of hops or lavender is to place them in, under or near your sleeping pillow.&lt;ref&gt;Calbom, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitrea, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kothe, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foster, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; The "dream pillow" or "sleep pillow" sachet concept has been used for decades to help overcome sleeplessness.&lt;ref&gt;Bond, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; These "sleep pillows" have a therapeutic effect and hops as an ingredient to this type of sachet are considered best at inducing sleep.&lt;ref&gt;Oster, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; One type of "sleep pillow" sachet recipe by herb and flower author Penny Black calls for violets, rose petals, rosemary, tonka bean, vanilla bean, and a drop of lemon oil.&lt;ref&gt;Black, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
Scented sachets are many times homemade and come in many sizes, styles, shapes and fragrances. A typical size would be approximately 4&amp;nbsp;inches square or thereabouts - some as small as a one-inch ball and others as large as an 8&amp;nbsp;inch square.&lt;ref name="remedies"/&gt; Many are in the shape of a plump little pillow.&lt;ref&gt;Black, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; The [[potpourri]] mix put inside the sachet can be herbal items or flower parts.&lt;ref&gt;Black, pp. 57-71&lt;/ref&gt; Some sachets that are made from spices like [[allspice]], [[anise]]ed, [[cinnamon]], [[clove]]s, [[nutmeg]], and [[vanilla bean]]s are referred to as "spiced sachets."&lt;ref&gt;Seton, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; A scented sachet used as a pot holder that is stuffed with allspice, cinnamon and cloves will release an apple pie smell when a hot dish is put on it.&lt;ref name="remedies"/&gt;

Other scented sachets are made from the [[winter savory]], [[lavender]], [[rosemary]], tops of [[hyssop]], chippings of ''cassia ligna'', [[Cedar wood|cedar]], and [[sassafras]].&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; This type is not only used to make garments sweet smelling but keep away destructive insects and worms.&lt;ref name="Cox259"&gt;Cox, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; Sachets with dried moth-repellent herbs like wormwood, southernwood, costmary, lavender, pennyroyal, lemon verbena rosemary, rue, sage and tansy are called "moth bags."&lt;ref name="Oster54"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garland, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;

A sachet base can be made where you can add certain aromatic or perfumed oils later to make various sachets. Some types of sachets are called "Patchouli Sachet" (that goes with woolens and blankets); "Florida Sachet" (which ingredients are fruity); "Oakasia Sachet"; "Orange-rose Sachet"; and "Sweet Bag of linen".&lt;ref&gt;Strobell, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; Some scented sachets even have names like ""Heliotrope Sachet" and "Tonka Bean Sachet." &lt;ref&gt;Freeman, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; Others still are called "Provencal pillows", "Country pillows" and "Pillows for Love".&lt;ref name="Garland229"/&gt;

Some are even made into Sweet Bag necklaces.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, p. 279&lt;/ref&gt; Some are decorated with embroidery, beads, buttons, ribbons, and fancy cloth. The oldest formula printed for a list of ingredients in an America scented sacket comes from a Colonial Williamsburg book, [[The Compleat Housewife]], published in 1742.&lt;ref&gt;Fettner, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1329">A '''Safe Load Indicator''' (SLI) or an Automatic Safe Load Indicator (ASLI) is a device which is installed on mobile or portal [[Crane (machine)|cranes]] to alert the operator if the lift is exceeding the safe operating range of the machinery. In some cases, the device will physically lock the machinery in circumstances it determines to be unsafe. SLI systems are usually composed of a [[microprocessor]] connected to various sensors on the crane itself. The SLI measures the angle and extension of the [[Crane (machine)|boom]] along with the load weight and compares this with the manufacturer's specifications to determine if the lift is safe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4368824.html Safe load indicator - Patent 4368824&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A safe load indicator has the capability of detecting the angle, weight of load lifted, and ground radius of any lifting device. It controls the lifting equipment to the level that it tries to keep the machinery functioning as per the manufacturer's suggested safety charts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sjhallplant.com Lifting Equipment Controls]&lt;/ref&gt;

The crane is fitted with multiple sensors, for each of the measured parameters, which are then further displayed in the operator's cabin for his benefit.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4550">In [[control theory]], a '''separation principle''', more formally known as a '''principle of separation of estimation and control''', states that under some assumptions the problem of designing an optimal feedback controller for a stochastic system can be solved by designing an optimal [[state observer|observer]] for the state of the system, which feeds into an optimal deterministic [[controller (control theory)|controller]] for the system.  Thus the problem can be broken into two separate parts, which facilitates the design.

The first instance of such a principle is in the setting of deterministic linear systems, namely that if a stable [[state observer|observer]] and a stable state [[feedback]] are designed for a [[LTI system theory|linear time-invariant system]], then the combined observer and feedback is [[BIBO stability|stable]]. The separation principle does not hold in general for non-linear systems in general. Another instance of the separation principle arises in the setting of linear stochastic systems, namely that state estimation (possibly nonlinear) together with an optimal state feedback controller designed to minimize a quadratic cost, is optimal for the stochastic control problem with output measurements. When process and observation noise are Gaussian, the optimal solution separates into a [[Kalman filter]] and a [[linear-quadratic regulator]]. This is known as [[linear-quadratic-Gaussian control]]. More generally, under suitable conditions and when the noise is a martingale (with possible jumps), again a separation principle applies and is known as the [[separation principle in stochastic control]]&lt;ref name="astrom"&gt;{{cite book |author=Karl Johan Astrom |title=Introduction to Stochastic Control Theory |publisher=Academic Press |volume=58 |year=1970 |isbn=0-486-44531-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A separation principle also exists for the control of quantum systems.


== Proof of separation principle for deterministic LTI systems ==

Consider a deterministic LTI system:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\dot{x}(t) &amp; = A x(t) + B u(t) \\
y(t) &amp; = C x(t)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;u(t)&lt;/math&gt; represents the input signal,
:&lt;math&gt;y(t)&lt;/math&gt; represents the output signal, and
:&lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; represents the internal state of the system.

We can design an observer of the form

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\hat{x}} = ( A - L C ) \hat{x} + B u + L y \, &lt;/math&gt;

and state feedback

:&lt;math&gt;u(t) = - K \hat{x} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

Define the error ''e'':

:&lt;math&gt;e = x - \hat{x} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

Then

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{e} = (A - L C) e \, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;u(t) = - K ( x - e ) \, .&lt;/math&gt;

Now we can write the closed-loop dynamics as

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
\dot{x} \\
\dot{e} \\
\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
A - B K &amp; BK \\
0 &amp; A - L C \\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
x \\
e \\
\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since this is [[triangular matrix|triangular]], the [[eigenvalues]] are just those of ''A''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''BK'' together with those of ''A''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''LC''.&lt;ref&gt;Proof can be found in this math.stackexchange [http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/21454/prove-that-the-eigenvalues-of-a-block-matrix-are-the-combined-eigenvalues-of-its question.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus the stability of the observer and feedback are [[Linear independence|independent]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3036">A '''signal analyzer''' is an instrument that measures the magnitude and phase of the input signal at a single frequency within the IF bandwidth of the instrument. It employs digital techniques to extract useful information that is carried by an electrical signal.&lt;ref&gt;De Silva, Clarence W. ''Vibration and Shock Handbook'', CRC Press, 2005, p. 16-63&lt;/ref&gt; In common usage the term is related to both [[spectrum analyzer]]s and [[vector signal analyzer]]s.  While [[spectrum analyzer]]s measure the [[amplitude]] or magnitude of signals, a signal analyzer with appropriate software or programming can measure any aspect of the signal such as [[modulation]]. Today’s high-frequency signal analyzers achieve good performance by optimizing both the [[Analog signal|analog]] front end and the [[Digital signal (signal processing)|digital]] back end.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evaluationengineering.com/index.php/solutions/instrumentation/crossing-domain-boundaries.html "Crossing Domain Boundaries"], Lecklider, Tom; Evaluation Engineering, October 2011, accessed October 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory of operation==
[[File:Signal analyzer block diagram.png||right|500px|thumb|Modern Signal Analyzer Architecture]]Modern signal analyzers use a [[superheterodyne receiver]] to downconvert a portion of the signal spectrum for analysis. As shown in the figure to the right, the signal is first converted to an intermediate frequency and then filtered in order to [[Band-limited|band-limit]] the signal and prevent [[aliasing]].  The downconversion can operate in a swept-tuned mode similar to a traditional [[spectrum analyzer]], or in a fixed-tuned mode.  In the fixed-tuned mode the range of frequencies downconverted does not change and the downconverter output is then [[Digitizing|digitized]] for further analysis.  The digitizing process typically involves in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) or complex sampling so that all characteristics of the signal are preserved, as opposed to the magnitude-only processing of a [[spectrum analyzer]].  The [[sampling rate]] of the [[digitizing|digitizing process]] may be varied in relation to the frequency span under consideration or (more typically) the signal may be digitally resampled.

==Typical usage==
Signal analyzers can perform the operations of both [[spectrum analyzer]]s and [[vector signal analyzer]]s.  A signal analyzer can be viewed as a measurement platform, with operations such as spectrum analysis (including [[phase noise]], [[Power (physics)|power]], and [[distortion]]) and vector signal analysis (including [[demodulation]] or modulation quality analysis) performed as measurement applications.  These measurement applications can be built into the analyzer platform as measurement firmware or installed as changeable application software.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4236">[[Image:Schiefertafelmitschwamm.jpg|thumb|Slate with sponge (~1950)]]

A '''slate''' is a thin piece of hard flat material, such as the rock also called [[slate]], that is used as a medium for writing. The rock is “a [[metamorphic rock]] created by the recrystallization of the minerals in [[shale]] from [[clay]] to parallel-aligned, flat, flake-like minerals such as mica”.&lt;ref&gt;Robert N. Pierport, “Slate Roofing”, APT Bulletin, Vol. 19(2) (1987), 10.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The writing slate consisted of a piece of slate, typically either 4x6 inches or 7x10 inches, encased in a wooden frame.&lt;ref&gt;“Standard Sizes of Blackboard Slate”, U.S Department of Commerce: National Bureau of Standards (1966), 3.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A precise date range for writing slates of this type has not been established. 

Usually, a piece of cloth or slate sponge was used to clean it and this was sometimes attached with a string to the bottom of the writing slate. 

The writing slate was used by children in America in [[one-room schoolhouse]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s to practice [[writing]] and [[arithmetic]] during classes or at home and in multi-room schools until the twentieth century. 

The writing slate was sometimes used by industry workers to track goods and by sailors to calculate their [[geographical location]] at sea. Sometimes multiple pieces of slate were bound together into a “book” and horizontal lines were etched onto the slate surface as a guide for neat handwriting.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Davies, “Writing Slates and Schooling”, Australasian Historical Archaeology, Vol. 23 (2005), 63-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The exact origins of the writing slate remain unclear. References to its use can be found in the fourteenth century and evidence suggests that it was used in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The central time period for the writing slate, however, “appears to begin in the later eighteenth century, when developments in sea and [[land transport]] permitted the gradual expansion of slate quarrying in [[Wales]] and the growth of a substantial slate workshop industry.”&lt;ref&gt;Davies, 63.&lt;/ref&gt; By the nineteenth century, writing slates were used around the world in nearly every school and were a central part of the [[slate industry]]. At the dawn of the twentieth century, writing slates were the primary tool in the [[classroom]] for students. In the 1930s (or later) writing slates began to be replaced by more modern methods.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, 64-65 .&lt;/ref&gt; However, writing slates did not become obsolete. They are still made in the twenty-first century, though in small quantities.

==Uses of slate==

[[Slate]] itself had been in use as a building material long before it was used for writing. The use of slate as a [[roofing material]] can be traced back to at least the Roman era in [[Wales]], from the first to the fourth century AD. The slate used in roofing had to be of very high quality, as the material is prone to cracking and can break if not handled with great care. Slate used for writing slates also had to be of good quality because of the thinness required.  Mining slate of this quality is a straightforward process since slate splits into nearly perfectly flat surfaces. The difficult part of the mining process is sorting out the quality slate from slate with “cats” or flaws. Properly sorted slate can be made into any required size. [[Roofing slate]] is still in use, primarily for the restoration of eighteenth and nineteenth century buildings, as it is fairly expensive.&lt;ref&gt;Pierport, 11-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Spontaneous combustion of compost pile.jpg|thumb|325px|A large compost pile can spontaneously combust if not properly managed.]]

'''Spontaneous combustion''' or '''spontaneous ignition''' is a type of [[combustion]] which occurs by self-heating (increase in temperature due to [[Exothermic reaction|exothermic internal reactions]]), followed by [[thermal runaway]] (self heating which rapidly accelerates to high temperatures) and finally, [[autoignition]].&lt;ref&gt;Babrauskas, p.369&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cause and ignition ==
# A substance with a relatively low ignition temperature (hay, straw, peat, etc.) begins to release heat.  This may occur in several ways, either by [[oxidation]] in the presence of moisture and air, or bacterial [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]], which generates heat.
# The heat is unable to escape (hay, straw, peat, etc. are good thermal insulators), and the temperature of the material rises.
# The temperature of the material rises above its ignition point (even though much of the bacteria are destroyed by ignition temperatures).
# Combustion begins if sufficient [[oxidizer]], such as oxygen, and fuel are present to maintain the reaction into thermal run-away.

== Affected materials ==

* [[Linseed oil]] and [[Danish oil]] in a confined space (such as a pile of oil-soaked rags left out in an uncovered container, especially if rags afterward used with anti-moisture solvent to clean up the oil) can oxidize leading to a buildup of heat and thus ignition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wildwoodsurvival.com/survival/fire/spontaneouscombustion/rbjul05/index.html |title=Fire - Reflectors |publisher=Wildwood Survival |date= |accessdate=2010-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Babrauskas, pp.886-890&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Pyrite]] oxidation is often the cause of coal spontaneous ignition in old [[mine tailings]].
* [[Pistachio]] nuts are highly flammable when stored in large quantities, and are prone to self-heating and spontaneous combustion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tis-gdv.de/tis_e/ware/nuesse/pistazie/pistazie.htm#selbsterhitzung |title=Pistachio Nuts |accessdate=2007-11-05 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Large [[manure]] piles can spontaneously combust during conditions of extreme heat.
* Cotton and linen. When these materials come into contact with polyunsaturated vegetable oils (linseed, massage oils), bacteria slowly decompose the materials, producing heat. If these materials are stored in a way so the heat cannot escape, the heat buildup increases the rate of decomposition and thus the rate of heat buildup increases. Once ignition temperature is reached, combustion occurs with oxidizers present (oxygen).
*[[Nitrate film]], when improperly stored, can deteriorate into an extremely flammable condition and combust. The [[1937 Fox vault fire]] was caused by spontaneously combusting nitrate film.

===Human===
{{mainarticle|Spontaneous human combustion}}
There have been unconfirmed anecdotal reports of [[spontaneous human combustion|people spontaneously combusting]]. This alleged phenomenon is not considered true spontaneous combustion, as supposed cases have been largely attributed to the [[wick effect]], whereby an external source of fire ignites nearby flammable materials and human fat or other sources.&lt;ref&gt;Nickell, Joe. [http://www.csicop.org/sb/show/spontaneous_human_nonsense/ "Spontaneous Human Nonsense"], ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'', Volume 6.4 (December 1966)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hay===
Hay is one of the more studied materials in spontaneous combustion.  As hay varies by the type of grass and location grown utilized in its preparation, it is very hard to establish a unified theory of what occurs in hay self-heating. It is anticipated that dangerous heating will occur in hay that contains more than 25% moisture. The largest number of fires occurs within 2 to 6 weeks of storage, with the majority occurring at 4 to 5 weeks.

The process may begin with microbiological activity (bacteria or mold), but at some point, the process has to become chemical. Microbiological activity will also limit the amount of oxygen available in the hay. Moisture appears to be quite important, no matter what process. At 100&amp;nbsp;°C, wet hay absorbed twice the amount of oxygen of dry hay. There has been conjecture that the complex carbohydrates present in hay break down to simpler sugars, which are more readily oxidized.&lt;ref&gt;Bowes, pp.376-390&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charcoal===
Charcoal, when freshly prepared, can self-heat and catch fire. This is separate from hot spots which may have developed from the preparation of charcoal. Charcoal that has been exposed to air for a period of eight days is not considered to be hazardous. There are many factors involved, two being the type of wood and the temperature at which the charcoal was prepared.&lt;ref&gt;Bowes, pp.315-330&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coal===
Self-heating in coal has been extensively studied. The tendency to self-heat decreases with increasing [[coal rank|rank of the coal]]. Lignite coals are more active than bituminous coals, which are more active than anthracite coals. Freshly mined coal consumes oxygen more rapidly than weathered coal, and freshly mined coal self-heats to a greater extent than weathered coal. The presence of water vapor may also be important, as the rate of heat generation accompanying the absorption of water in dry coal from saturated air can be an order of magnitude or more than the same amount of dry air.&lt;ref&gt;Bowes, pp.330-333&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oil seeds and oil-seed products===
[[Vegetable oil|Oil seeds]] and residue from oil extraction will self-heat if too moist. Typically, storage at 9–14% moisture is satisfactory, but limits are established for each individual variety of oil seed. In the presence of excess moisture just under levels required for germinating seed, the activity of mold fungi to generate heat is a likely candidate. This has been established for flax and sunflower seeds, as well as soy beans. Many of the oil seeds generate oils that are self-heating. Palm kernels, rapeseed, and cotton seed have also been studied.&lt;ref&gt;Bowes, pp.396-406&lt;/ref&gt; Rags soaked in linseed oil can spontaneously ignite if improperly stored or discarded.

'''São Carlos''' (Saint Charles, in English, {{IPA-pt|sɐ̃w̃ ˈkaʁlus}}; named after [[Charles Borromeo|Saint Charles Borromeo]]) is a city of 246,088&lt;ref name="IBGE" /&gt; inhabitants ([[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]]/2017) in the state of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], [[Brazil]]. It is located at {{coord|22|01|04|S|47|53|27|W|}}, at about 230&amp;nbsp;km from the city of [[São Paulo]].

==History==
The region started to be settled in the end of the 18th century, with the opening of a road that led to the gold mines in [[Cuiabá]] and [[Goiás]]. Leaving from [[Piracicaba]], passing through [[Rio Claro, São Paulo|Rio Claro]], the hills, fields and by typical vegetations of the Brazilian countryside, settlers established in the region. São Carlos' history started in 1831, when the "Pinhal" (Pines) allotment was demarcated.

On the city's foundation date, November 4, 1857, the population resided in some houses around the chapel and the inhabitants were mostly Arruda Botelho's family heirs, who were the first owners of the "Pinhal" alloments. Between 1831 and 1857 the pioneer coffee farms were formed, starting the first economic activity in the city. The coffee crops came to the "Pinhal" farm in 1840 and spread throughout the fertile lands around, becoming the main export item. The city foundation is credited to [[Antônio Carlos de Arruda Botelho, Count of Pinhal]], an influent farmer and entrepreneur.

São Carlos was elevated to [[village]] in 1865, when a "Câmara", or ruling chamber, was created. In 1874, the village had 6,897 inhabitants, as a humble highlight of its fast growth and regional importance. It became a [[city]] in 1880 and in 1886, with a population of 16,104, its urban structure was settled.

The city arises on the coffee crops expansion context, which is relevant to the last two decades of the 19th century and to the first two of the 20th century. The arrival of the railway in 1884 provided an efficient system to transport the [[Coffee production in Brazil|coffee production]] to the [[Port of Santos|Santos harbor]] and boosted the economy of the region. The railway also contributed to the political and economic consolidation of the central area of the city.

When slavery ended, government created incentives to bring in immigrants. São Carlos had already received German nationals brought by the Count of Pinhal in 1876. Between 1880 and 1904, the city was one of the most important immigration centers in São Paulo state, the majority of them being [[Italian Brazilians|Italians]] - specifically, [[Northern Italy|Northern Italians]]. They worked in coffee plantations and in manufacturing factories, as well as trading activities.

In the beginning of the 20th century, countless cultural societies developed social activities aiming to promote literacy. Vittorio Emanuele Society in 1900 and [[Dante Alighieri]] in 1902 were but a few of them. The Italian presence was so significant that during the first half of the 20th century, the Italian government had a consulate branch in São Carlos.

With the [[Wall Street crash of 1929]], coffee production went through a crisis, which made many immigrants leave rural areas for factories, wood artifact production, pottery, and construction.

Farmers had already applied the profits obtained with coffee in the constitution of several types of companies in São Carlos: banks, electricity, cable cars, telephones, water pumps, sewers, theaters, hospitals and schools.  This established a foundation for industrialization in the city. With the arrival of immigrants from other urban centers from the 1930s - 1940s, their expertise was used to consolidate industrialization as the main economic activity in the city. Its peak years were the 1950s, when São Carlos became a manufacturing center, with relevant industrial expression in São Paulo state.

The industrial sector also developed through workshops that incorporated the coffee industry. The manufacture of processing machinery, shoes, fertilizers, hardware, furniture, pasta, cigars, as well as activities such as tailory, breweries, foundries, sawmills, weaving, pottery and pencil production expanded the economy of São Carlos in the 1930s. In the 1950s and 1960s, with the expansion of refrigeration, new factories of machinery and tractors arrived. Numerous small- and medium-sized companies which provided products and services were also established.

In the second half of the 20th century, the city received a boost of technological and higher educational development when in 1953 the Escola de Engenharia de São Carlos, or the Engineering School of the [[University of São Paulo]], was created. In the 1970s, the [[Federal University of São Carlos]] was launched.

==Geography==

São Carlos is located on the geographic center of the São Paulo state, approximately {{convert|231|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the [[São Paulo|city of São Paulo]]. The city is the center of a [[Microregion of São Carlos|microregion]] with 308,777 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 Census of the IBGE - Synopsis - Table 761|url=http://www.sidra.ibge.gov.br/cd/cd2010sp.asp?o=3&amp;i=P|publisher=IBGE.gov.br|accessdate=22 July 2011|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its altitude is over 856 m, offering a mild altitude climate. Most of the year the city is windy, sunny and with mild temperatures at night. For this reason the city is nicknamed "''Cidade do Clima''" (Weather City) and celebrates once a year an event called "''Festa do Clima''", or "Weather Festival".

The city has a total area of 1.141&amp;nbsp;km², which includes two districts to the north (''Santa Eudóxia'' and ''Água Vermelha''), one district to the west (''Bela Vista São-carlense''), and one district to the east (''Vila Nery'').

==Economy==
The city has an active industrial profile with important national and international industries and certain agricultural importance, backed by technologies developed by [[Embrapa]], owner of two research complexes in the city. Due to its increasing number of high technology industries, the city has been proclaimed "The National Capital of Technology" by Brazilian President [[Dilma Rousseff]] in 2011.

The city hosts several locally-grown technology-based companies, such as Opto Eletrônicos, and factories of multinational corporations such as [[Faber Castell]], [[Electrolux]], [[Husqvarna AB|Husqvarna]], [[Tecumseh Products Company|Tecumseh]] and the Brazilian plant of [[Volkswagen]] [[engine]]s, and national corporations such as [[TAM Linhas Aéreas|TAM MRO - Technology Center]], [[Toalhas São Carlos]], [[Tapetes São Carlos]], [[Papel São Carlos]], [[Prominas Brasil]] and [[Latina (industry)|Latina]].

The economic basis of São Carlos is the [[Tertiary sector of the economy|tertiary sector]]. Commerce and services corresponds to 65.9% of the city's GDP. Industry is also relevant. With 32.3% of the economy, the [[Secondary sector of the economy|secondary sector]] has a bigger participation than the state of São Paulo's average. The [[Primary sector of the economy|primary sector]] corresponds to 1.7% of the GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Municipal Profile at SEADE|url=http://www.seade.gov.br/produtos/perfil/perfilMunEstado.php|publisher=SEADE.gov.br|accessdate=12 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823080724/http://www.seade.gov.br/produtos/perfil/perfilMunEstado.php|archivedate=23 August 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tanwater''' was a special [[water treatment]] project initiated  by Elmo tannery in Sweden in 1992.
The aim was to reduce [[nitrogen]] effluent from the water treatment systems during the tanning of [[leather]]s. Previously [[Tanning (leather)|tanneries]] in Europe have only  been able to reduce nitrogen in the water by up to a maximum of 30%. The "Tanwater" project aimed at reducing nitrogen waste by up to 80% and finally were able to achieve 89% nitrogen waste reductions in the water. This was a major breakthrough for the tanning industry because nitrogen is a pollutant of ground water. 

Elmo tannery received a grant for the project from LIFE (The Financial Instrument for the Environment). LIFE  finances environmental projects in the [[European Union]]. Elmo tannery, although producing leathers predominantly for the car industry (upholstery leathers, also produces leathers for handbags and footwear.  Since Elmo started this project there has been a number of tanneries that have followed in its steps of improving their water treatment systems in Sweden and Norway.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5191">In [[engineering]], '''technical peer review''' is a type of engineering review. Technical peer reviews are a well defined review process for finding and fixing defects, conducted by a team of peers with assigned roles. Technical peer reviews are carried out by peers representing areas of life cycle affected by material being reviewed (usually limited to 6 or fewer people). Technical peer reviews are held within development phases, between milestone reviews, on completed products or completed portions of products.&lt;ref name = "NASA-6105"&gt;{{cite book| title=NASA Systems Engineering Handbook| id=SP-610S | year=2007|publisher=[[NASA]]|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20080008301_2008008500.pdf}} 
&lt;/ref&gt;

A technical peer review may also be called a ''engineering peer review'', a ''product peer review'', a ''peer review/inspection'' or an ''inspection.''

== Overview ==
The purpose of technical peer reviews is to remove defects as early as possible in the development process. By removing defects at their origin (e.g., requirements and design documents, test plans and procedures, software code, etc.), technical peer reviews prevent defects from propagating through multiple phases and work products, and reduce the overall amount of rework necessary on projects.

In addition, improved team efficiency is a side effect of technical peer reviews (e.g., by improving team communication, integrating the viewpoints of various engineering specialty disciplines, more quickly bringing new members up to speed, and educating project members about effective development practices).

In [[CMMI]], peer reviews are used as a principal means of verification in the Verification process area and as an objective evaluation method in the Process and Product Quality Assurance process area. The results of technical peer reviews can be reported at milestone reviews. (See [[Milestone (project management)]].)

==Roles of participants==
;Moderator
Responsible for conducting the technical peer review process and collecting inspection data. Plays key role in all stages of the technical peer review process except rework. Required to perform several duties during a technical peer review in addition to inspector’s tasks.

;Inspectors
Responsible for finding defects in work product from a general point of view, as well as defects that affect their area of expertise.

;Author
Provides information about work product during all stages of process. Responsible for correcting all major defects and any minor and trivial defects that cost and schedule permit. Performs duties of an inspector.

;Reader
Guides team through work product during the technical peer review meeting. Reads or paraphrases work product in
detail. Performs duties of an inspector in addition to reader’s role.

;Recorder
Accurately records each defect found during inspection meeting on the Inspection Defect List. Performs duties of an inspector in addition to recorder’s role.

== Vested interest of reviewers ==
There are two philosophies about the vested interest of the inspectors in the product under review. On one hand, project personnel who have a vested interest in the work product under review have the most knowledge of the product and are motivated to find and fix defects. On the other hand, personnel from outside the project
who do not have a vested interest in the work product bring objectivity and a fresh viewpoint to the technical peer review team. 

Each inspector is invited to disclose vested interests to the rest of the technical peer review panel so the Moderator can exercise sound judgement in evaluating the inspector's inputs.

== Distinction from other types of technical review ==
Peer reviews are distinct from management reviews, which are conducted by management representatives rather than by colleagues, and for management and control purposes rather than for technical evaluation. They are also distinct from [[software audit review]]s, which are conducted by personnel external to the project, to evaluate compliance with specifications, standards, contractual agreements, or other criteria.

A [[software peer review]] is a type of technical peer review. The [[IEEE]] defines formal structures, roles, and processes for software peer reviews.&lt;ref&gt;[[IEEE]] Std. 1028-1997, "IEEE Standard for Software Reviews"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Management involvement ==
Management representatives are typically not involved in the conduct of a peer review. This is especially true of line managers of the author or other participants in the review. A policy of encouraging management to stay out of peer reviews encourages the peer review team to concentrate on the product being reviewed and not on the people or personalities involved.

== Detailed instructions ==
For detailed instructions on conducting a technical peer review/inspection, see NASA Systems Engineering Handbook, Appendix N.&lt;ref name = "NASA-6105"/&gt;

'''Toast, Inc.''' is a cloud-based restaurant software company based in Boston, Massachusetts. The company provides a restaurant management and [[Point of sale|point of sale (POS) system]] built on the [[Android (operating system)|Android operating system]]. Toast was founded in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 2012 by Steve Fredette, Aman Narang, and Jonathan Grimm. In 2016, Toast received $30 million in a round of [[Venture capital financing|Series B funding]] from [[Bessemer Venture Partners]] and [[GV (company)|GV]], formerly Google Ventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Engel|first1=Jeff|url=http://www.xconomy.com/boston/2016/01/05/toast-from-endeca-vets-orders-up-30m-for-restaurant-software/|publisher=xconomy|date=January 5, 2016|title=Toast, From Endeca Vets, Orders Up $30M For Restaurant Software}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toast is used in a thousand restaurants, from small cafes to nationwide enterprises, across the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Woodward|first1=Curt|url=http://www.betaboston.com/news/2015/08/07/restaurant-tech-startup-toast-raising-more-money-as-it-hits-1000-customers/|publisher=Beta Boston|title=Restaurant tech startup Toast raising more money as it hits 1,000 customers|date=August 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|date=July 2018}}

==History==

Toast founders Steve Fredette, Aman Narang, and Jonathan Grimm met at software company [[Endeca]] after graduating from MIT in Cambridge, MA. After Endeca was acquired by Oracle in 2011, they left to start Toast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Farrell|first1=Michael|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2013/09/22/out-endeca-new-crop-start-ups-take-shape/yQTwuTTK5bjHSlXJo4DPLM/story.html|publisher=Boston Globe|title=Cambridge firm is fertile ground for entrepreneurs|date=September 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grimm, Narang, and Fredette initially created a consumer app centered for mobile payments, customer loyalty, promotions, and social aspects that integrated with restaurants’ existing POS systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kirsner|first1=Scott|url=http://archive.boston.com/business/technology/innoeco/2012/12/testing_out_toast_new_mobile_a.html|publisher=Boston.com|title=Testing out Toast, new mobile app that helps diners keep an eye on the tab|date=December 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company started to realize that restaurants had far more needs than just being able to accept payments using a phone or tablet. The company pivoted to a full restaurant technology platform, with solutions for POS, online ordering, gift cards, analytics and other features. Two years later, the company signed over 1,000 merchants across the United States and grew to more than 120 employees, requiring the company to upgrade its space from 7,000 square feet in Cambridge to 40,000 square feet at the Hatch Fenway co-working space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Martin|first1=Dylan|url=http://bostinno.streetwise.co/2015/09/09/restaurant-tablet-toast-restaurant-pos-system-adds-customers-headcount/|publisher=BostInno|date=September 9, 2015|title=Here's Why Toast is Becoming a Serious Contender in the Restaurant POS Market}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kirsner|first1=Scott|url=http://www.betaboston.com/news/2015/07/07/restaurant-tech-startup-toast-surpasses-100-employees-gets-ready-to-move/|publisher=Beta Boston|title=Restaurant tech startup Toast surpasses 100 employees, gets ready to move|date=July 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thefenway.com/art-culture-business-events-real-estate-working/toast-pops-fenway-hatch’s-first-tenant-moves|publisher=The Fenway|title=Toast Pops Up in The Fenway: Hatch's First Tenant Moves In}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bostinno.streetwise.co/2015/07/01/boston-startup-co-working-spaces-hatch-fenway-opening-august-2015/|title=One of Fenway’s Most Historic Buildings Gets an Innovative New Coworking Space|last=|first=|date=|website=bostinno.streetwise.co|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Toast received [[investments]] from several Boston executives, including former CEO of Endeca Steve Papa, who now serves as a board member for the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Papa|first1=Steve|url=http://www.venturefizz.com/blog/steve-papa-endeca-entrepreneurial-spider-web-effect|publisher=Venture Fizz|title=Steve Papa, Endeca &amp; The Entrepreneurial Spider Web Effect|date=April 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2015, Toast announced Chris Comparato as its chief executive officer. Comparato previously served as senior vice president of customer success at [[Acquia]] and senior vice president of worldwide customer solutions at Endeca.  In August, Toast announced that they signed 1,000 customers in under two years, revealing 550% year-over-year growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Guerra|first1=Bryan|url=http://www.hbxblog.com/toast-tab-the-difficulty-of-specialization-in-an-interdependent-industry|publisher=HBX Blog|title=The Strategic Pivot: Interdependence vs. Modularity in Restaurant POS Systems|date=October 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November, Toast released its first restaurant report, which analyzed the market for restaurant technology as well as restaurant owners’ challenges and preferred technology features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.emarketer.com/Article/Restaurants-Look-Upgrade-Their-Technology-Within-Year/1013429|publisher=eMarkter|title=Restaurants Look to Upgrade Their Technology Within the Year|date=January 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, Toast received $30 million in a round of [[Venture capital financing|Series B funding]] from [[Bessemer Venture Partners]]  and [[GV (company)|GV]], previously known as Google Ventures and an [[Alphabet Inc.|Alphabet]] company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yeung|first1=Ken|url=https://venturebeat.com/2016/01/05/toast-raises-30m-for-its-android-powered-point-of-sale-system-to-challenge-square/|publisher=Venture Beat|title=Toast raises $30 million for Android-powered point-of-sale-system to challenge Square|date=January 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Martin|first1=Dylan|url=http://bostinno.streetwise.co/2016/01/05/toasts-android-restaurant-software-gets-30m-from-google-bessemer/|publisher=BostInno|title=Here's How Toast Landed $30M From Alphabet's GV &amp; Bessemer|date=January 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The funding was led by BVP partner Kent Bennett and general partner and Android co-founder [[Rich Miner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Billings|first1=Mike|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2016/01/06/the-daily-startup-toast-raises-30-million-for-restaurant-pos-tech/|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|title=The Daily Startup: Toast Raises $30 Million for Restaurant POS Tech|date=January 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several undisclosed investors also participated in the round.

'''Waterless fracturing''' is an alternative to [[hydraulic fracturing]] in which liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) which uses propane liquefied into gel. Propane is pumped into shale rock formation instead of water. The use of propane does not block all pathways and therefore more natural gas is released. In addition, it does not carry poisonous chemicals and underground radioactivity back to the surface, and when it does comes back to the surface it can have another usage or be used again for LPG.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Janiczek, Nathan. "Waterless Fracking: A Clean Substitute." ''Our Energy Policy.'' &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.ourenergypolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/WA3.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt; (accessed May 1, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; The only drawback is the cost as propane is more expensive than water.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://insideclimatenews.org/print/12241|title=New Waterless Fracking Method Avoids Pollution Problems, But Drillers Slow to Embrace It|website=insideclimatenews.org|access-date=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another drawback is that the possible leak of propane may lead to flash fire, so fracturing with propane requires more safety instructions and monitoring equipments in order to reduce possible risks.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

According to Nathan Janiczek, the new era of waterless fracturing is growing and it is called Liquefied Petroleum Gas, or LPG fracturing. LPG is always pumped in a well and because of that pumping, rocks are destroyed and gas is released. Besides that, LPG is fully converted into gas when it is pumped up to the surface and that guarantees a one hundred percent retrieval rate. If we compare conventional fracking and fracking using propane gel, LPG fracking does not produce waste, nearly 100% of propane gas is pumped back while 50% of hydraulic frack fluid remains underground. It has lower viscosity, less surface tension and lower specific gravity, which makes the fluid more effective in transport and less dependent on pressure. LPG has many advantages; however, it is a new technique, which needs further research.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Liquefied petroleum gas fracturing was developed by a GasFrac energy company, based in Calgary, Alberta. The Chief Technology Officer of the GasFrac company said that it is being used since 2008 in gas wells of Canada in Alberta, British Columbia, New Brunswick, Texas, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Oklahoma and New Mexico.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Woking Park''' is a large park and leisure complex in [[Woking]], [[Surrey]], operated and maintained by [[Woking (borough)|Woking Borough]] Council. The park is in the Hoe Valley and will be affected by the Hoe Valley Scheme.

==History==

In 1902 the Brettell Family and associates, who were known as philanthropists, gave the land to the town on the condition "said land shall not be used for any other purpose than a public park, public walks, gardens, recreation grounds, pleasure grounds, and baths."&lt;ref name ="collegemove"&gt;Get surrey article on proposed college move http://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/s/2040242_save_our_park_urges_campaign&lt;/ref&gt;

The current Leisure Centre was opened in 1976&lt;ref name="FactSheet"&gt;Woking council fact sheet http://www.woking.gov.uk/leisure/leisurecentrepool/generalinformation/infopack.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

1989: The main pool of what is now the Pool in the Park swimming complex was opened.&lt;ref name="FactSheet"/&gt; Three years later in 1992 the leisure lagoon was opened.&lt;ref name="FactSheet"/&gt;

2003: A [[fuel cell]] based [[Cogeneration|combined power and heating]] system was installed behind the Pool in the Park.&lt;ref name="FuelCell"&gt;Woking Park Fuel Cell http://www.woking.gov.uk/environment/Greeninitiatives/sustainablewoking/fuelcell.pdf Woking Park Fuel Cell CHP&lt;/ref&gt;

2004: As part of a council project covering four ponds in the Hoe Valley area, a major restoration was undertaken to the duck pond area&lt;ref name = "Ponds"&gt;Get Surrey article on Pond restoration http://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/s/93785_pond_life_is_on_its_way&lt;/ref&gt;

2008: It was proposed that the Woking College be relocated to Woking park in order to expand.&lt;ref name ="collegemove"/&gt; This was opposed by local residents,&lt;ref name ="collegemove"/&gt; who pointed out it was in breach of the original covenant gifting the land to the town.&lt;ref name ="collegemove"/&gt;

2010: Significant development work began on Woking Park as part of the Hoe Valley scheme. This included the felling of a large number of trees,&lt;ref&gt;Get Surrey article on tree felling http://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/s/2084117_removal_of_woking_park_trees_defended_by_council&lt;/ref&gt; clearance of waste land, derelict greenhouses and the construction of new facilities.

2011: As part of a ten-year deal with Woking Borough Council, [[Freedom Leisure]] took over the running of all council run facilities at Woking Park.&lt;ref&gt;Get Surrey article on Freedom Leisure http://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/s/2096752_woking_leisure_centre_to_be_run_by_external_operator&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==

Woking Park has a number of facilities and sport pitches. There is also a large car park near Pool in the Park.

===Pool in the Park===
[[File:Flumes in Woking Park - geograph.org.uk - 1188152.jpg|thumb|Pool in the Park flumes]]{{Update Needed}}
Pool in the Park is a purpose-built [[Swimming pool|swimming complex]] in the middle of the park. It has three pools, the [[Swimming pool#Competition pools|competition pool]] that is one to three metres deep, 25m long and 13m wide, with up to 6 swim lanes, which opened in 1989; a teaching pool 16 metres long x 8 metres and 0.8m - 1.0m  depth and the leisure lagoon which includes three Water Slides which vary in speed (Fast, Medium and Slow). Other lagoon features include a 'river rapids' ride, a wave machine, water cannons and a "mushroom" water fountain. The outside design of Pool in the Park is based on an ancient Roman Coliseum.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} Pool in the Park offers a range of activities including a comprehensive swim school programme, toddler splash sessions, aqua fitness classes, adults and ladies only sessions, children's activities and parties and is home to local clubs including Woking Swimming Club, Woking Snorkelling, Surrey Aquanauts, Woking Snorkel and Scuba and Woking Lifesaving club

===Leisure Centre===

The [[Leisure Centre]] opened in 1976&lt;ref name="FactSheet"/&gt; and is accessed via a pedestrian bridge over a small river. It has a number of sports facilities, including 6 [[Squash (sport)|squash]] courts, a new state-of the art gym overlooking the park [[gym]], three fitness studios, a dedicated Spinning (indoor cycling)studio and two halls.&lt;ref name="FactSheet"/&gt; The main sports hall is used for [[badminton]], [[association football|football]], basketball, trampolining, sporting events and also a number of non-sports related activities, including [[antique]]s fairs, [[flea markets]], and the annual Woking [[Beer Festival]].&lt;ref name="FactSheet"/&gt; The second, smaller, hall is called the Wurlitzer hall and houses an American Theatre organ which offers regular concerts through The London and South of England American Theatre Society.&lt;ref name="FactSheet"/&gt; There is also a kids' indoor softplay area, called the Pick'n'mix Playstore, [[Day care|creche]], cafe, Heatwaves suite featuring sauna, Jacuzzi and steam room. Sensations Multi-Sensory Suite.&lt;ref name="FactSheet"/&gt; Many clubs and groups use the centre including weightlifting, gymnastics, martial arts, and dance and drama and the faciliities are available for club/group/business hire.

===Sports pitches===
Outdoor sport pitches include a [[association football|football]]/[[hockey]] pitch, [[cricket]] square, [[bowls]] lawn,  and a number of [[tennis]] courts.&lt;ref name = "Facilities"&gt;Woking Sports Facilities http://www.woking.gov.uk/leisure/sportandrecreation/sportsfacilities/pitches&lt;/ref&gt; The tennis courts are open to the public (book at Pool in the Park) although they're not floodlit so operating hours reduce according to the time of the year, whereas the bowls lawn is restricted to members of Woking Park Bowls Club.&lt;ref&gt;Woking Park Bowls Club http://www.woking.gov.uk/leisure/sportandrecreation/clubs/clubdirectory?option=Bowls&lt;/ref&gt; The cricket pitch is only used for cricket games, but is open for people to use at other times. There is clubhouse for the cricket players. There are four new 3g 7-a-side football pitches (opened June 2014) behind the leisure centre with additional parking underneath which are available for booking and leagues.

===Play areas===

Near the middle of the park there are two climbing boulders with a spider's web between them. The boulders contain several holds, on which hands or feet can be placed to move the body up the boulder. These are intended for 13- to 19-year-olds, though a lot of other age groups play on them. Use of this feature has declined as the erosion caused by footwear has made the walls difficult to climb. The spider was designed with several features in mind; to represent social mobility within Woking, promoting business and entrepreneurship within the town. Additionally, the eight legs of the spider celebrate Woking's multicultural heritage. There is also a [[playground]] for smaller children (Which had some improvement work), a [[crazy golf]] course and a [[skate park]]&lt;ref name="Facilities"/&gt; which is very popular with locals aged around 11-19.

14 July The play area is currently being completely redeveloped and enlarged, due to open in the Autumn.

===Ponds and Gardens===

In the centre of the park is a set of three wildlife ponds with a timber decking viewing area. This was extensively renovated in 2004, as the two existing ponds were badly overgrown and in decay.&lt;ref name="Ponds"/&gt; This involved the removal of 300 tonnes of sediment,&lt;ref&gt;Woking Council article on pond renovation http://www.woking.gov.uk/leisure/greenspaces/countryside/greenprojects/wokingpark&lt;/ref&gt; and architects Upton McGougan were awarded runner up in the Sustainable Designer of the Year competition in 2005 for the project.&lt;ref&gt;Upton McGougan http://www.uptonmcgougan.com/awards.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the park are a number of gardens with statues and similar decoration.

'''Wildlife'''

In the ponds and gardens there are many different types of wildlife-Some rare and some common. In the ponds the wildlife includes a family of swans, about 20 ducks, and many other different species in the pond. There are many other types of wildlife in the ponds. In the gardens there's not a much wildlife. There are many small species that live in the gardens, such as ants, wasps, spiders and flies. On occasion men can be seen urinating in these gardens, allowing their waste to fuel the rise of new life.

===Community Centre &amp; Ongoing Improvements To Woking Park===
As part of the [[Woking#Hoe Valley Scheme|Hoe Valley scheme]] a new community centre is being built on land adjacent to the leisure centre.&lt;ref name ="CommuityCentre"&gt;Community Centre details http://www.woking.gov.uk/environment/hoevalleyintro/communitybuildings&lt;/ref&gt; This will including facilities for the [[Scouts]], [[Army Cadet Force|Army]] and [[Air Training Corps|Air Cadets]], Sea Rangers, [[Girl Guides]], Westfield Football Club and Woking Boxing Club, who are currently located in Westfield Avenue.&lt;ref name ="CommuityCentre"/&gt; A number of derelict greenhouses are also to be demolished to provide space for new training pitches. Some of the other improvements consist of adding extra pathways, improving facilities there and also adding new ways of access to the park.

===Firework display===
Woking Borough Council started the annual Fireworks Display that was held in Woking Park.  After a few years the organisation was passed to Woking Round Table who ran it for many years until 2014.

==Fuel cell power and heating system==
[[File:Woking Park Fuel Cell - geograph.org.uk - 22955.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Pool in the Park [[Fuel cell]] [[cogeneration|CHP system]]. You can also see some of the Pool in the Park water slides in the background, in green]]
Behind Pool in the Park is installed a [[fuel cell]] based [[Cogeneration|combined power and heating]] system which was implemented in 2003 in a joint venture between Woking Borough Council and Thamesway Energy Ltd which is a company owned by Woking Borough Council.&lt;ref name="FuelCell"/&gt;

The system chemically reforms natural gas into hydrogen using oxygen from the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="FuelCell"/&gt; When converted to electricity in the fuel cell this produces 50% more energy than conventional means and produces pure water as a byproduct, which is reclaimed for other use.&lt;ref name="FuelCell"/&gt; Heat is also produced, which is used to power the pool in the park air conditioning system.&lt;ref name="FuelCell"/&gt; This provides for all of Woking Park's energy requirements, is self-sufficient in electricity and is a net exporter of power to other council sites.&lt;ref name="FuelCell"/&gt;

The main component is a 200 kWe fuel cell along with four smaller 60&amp;nbsp;kW units and one 836&amp;nbsp;kW unit. Total combined heating and power capacity is 1.2 MWe and 1.6 MWth.&lt;ref name="FuelCell"/&gt; The system is on display to the public with information and educational resources provided.&lt;ref name="FuelCell"/&gt;

Work began in 2001, and was the first system of its kind in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Fuel Cell press release http://www.woking.gov.uk/news/archive?item=0000406C0211.D464FE53.00006BE7.1778&lt;/ref&gt; It was part funded as part of a larger scheme to showcase how such technology could be used in the UK to meet environmental targets.&lt;ref name="FuelCell"/&gt;
