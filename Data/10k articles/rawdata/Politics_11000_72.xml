'''''Accidental Death and Disability: The Neglected Disease of Modern Society''''' was an influential report published in 1966 by the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] and is considered a landmark in the development of the [[Emergency medical services in the United States|emergency medical services]] system in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10903120090940958 |journal=[[Prehospital Emergency Care]] |volume=4 |issue=4 |date=October 2000 |pages=285–289 |title=Special Contributions.

The National Academy of Sciences—[[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] Committees on [[Physical trauma|Trauma]] and [[Shock (circulatory)|Shock]], a federally funded department of the government, published the report of their research which concluded, in part, that both the public and government were "insensitive to the magnitude of the problem of accidental death and injury" in the U.S.; that the standards to which [[ambulance]] services were held were diverse and "often low"; and that "most ambulances used in this country are unsuitable, have incomplete … equipment, carry inadequate supplies, and are manned by untrained attendants."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Accidental Death and Disability: The Neglected Disease of Modern Society |date=September 1966 |author=Division of Medical Sciences, Committee on Trauma and Committee on Shock |publisher=National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report led to the design and implementation of the first federally qualified [[ambulance]] services and personnel. The reforms inaugurated by the publication of "The White Paper" led to higher quality care provided on-scene and in-transit by trained [[paramedic]]s and [[Emergency medical technician|EMT]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21332">'''Amylase''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|m|ᵻ|l|eɪ|s}}) are [[enzymes]] that [[catalysis|catalyse]] the [[hydrolysis]] of [[starch]] into [[sugar]]s. Amylase is present in the [[saliva]] of humans and some other mammals, where it begins the chemical process of [[digestion]]. Foods that contain large amounts of starch but little sugar, such as [[rice]] and [[potatoes]], may acquire a slightly sweet taste as they are chewed because amylase degrades some of their starch into sugar. The [[pancreas]] and salivary gland make amylase ([[alpha amylase]]) to hydrolyse dietary starch into [[disaccharides]] and [[trisaccharides]] which are converted by other enzymes to [[glucose]] to supply the body with energy. Plants and some bacteria also produce amylase. As ''[[diastase]]'', amylase is the first enzyme to be discovered and isolated (by [[Anselme Payen]] in 1833).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Robert | last1 = Hill | first2 = Joseph | last2 = Needham | name-list-format = vanc | title = The Chemistry of Life:  Eight Lectures on the History of Biochemistry | location = London, England | publisher = Cambridge University Press | date = 1970 | url =  https://books.google.com/books?id=IvM8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;dq=Payen+Persoz&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2KbYMz6SV1&amp;sig=ZgCQNt0qIhhihF3ADC8W2jx40OE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=iOvYS7fDK4KB8gaRlsX_BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CAwQ6AEwAQ | page = 17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Richard B. | last1 = Silverman | name-list-format = vanc  | title = The Organic Chemistry of Enzyme-catalyzed Reactions | edition = 2nd | location = London, England | publisher =  Academic Press | date = 2002 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Wj9EufQ2XEQC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=Payen+Persoz&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=thpbW0neHn&amp;sig=p1pw0gwBFiOQ-E0WfG0iPPlB-IE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=uOvYS4j3HIP58AaiwqTVBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAUQ6AEwADgK | page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Jochanan | last1 = Stenesh | name-list-format = vanc | title = Biochemistry | volume = 2 | location = New York, New York | publisher =  Plenum | year = 1998 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lp7sAL5oqFcC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;lpg=PA83&amp;dq=Payen+Persoz&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=d9e1esqwxA&amp;sig=Ij3HsfWp_d-idY34ZbvGFhs9ebc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=54bXS-LzLIm28wTrzf2jBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwBQ | page = 83 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Robert A. | last1 = Meyers | name-list-format = vanc | title = Molecular Biology and Biotechnology:  A Comprehensive Desk Reference | location = New York, New York | publisher = Wiley-VCH | year = 1995 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2TjAqddKsscC&amp;pg=PA296&amp;lpg=PA296&amp;dq=Payen+Persoz&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7u1R4xm_BT&amp;sig=5ACQvnsf9FqEcGedkq4xrYrtXxI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6evYS4nmG4H78Aar9YHaBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CAwQ6AEwAjgU | page = 296 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific amylase [[protein]]s are designated by different Greek letters. All amylases are [[glycoside hydrolase]]s and act on α-1,4-[[glycosidic bond]]s.

==Classification==

===α-amylase===

}}
{{Main|Alpha-amylase}}
The [[α-amylase]]s ({{EC number|3.2.1.1 }}) ([[CAS registry number|CAS]]# 9014-71-5) (alternative names: 1,4-α-&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-glucan glucanohydrolase; glycogenase) are [[calcium]] [[metalloprotein|metalloenzymes]].  By acting at random locations along the starch chain, α-amylase breaks down long-chain [[saccharides]], ultimately yielding [[maltotriose]] and [[maltose]] from [[amylose]], or maltose, [[glucose]] and [[dextrin|"limit dextrin"]] from [[amylopectin]].  Because it can act anywhere on the [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]], α-amylase tends to be faster-acting than β-amylase.  In [[animal]]s, it is a major [[digestion|digestive]] enzyme, and its optimum pH is 6.7–7.0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worthington-biochem.com/introbiochem/effectspH.html|title=Effects of pH (Introduction to Enzymes)|work=worthington-biochem.com|access-date=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In human physiology, both the salivary and pancreatic amylases are α-amylases.
    
The α-amylases form is also found in plants, fungi (ascomycetes and basidiomycetes) and bacteria (''Bacillus'')

===β-amylase===
{{infobox enzyme
| Name = Beta-amylase
| EC_number = 3.2.1.2
| CAS_number = 9000-91-3
| IUBMB_EC_number = 3/2/1/2

}}
Another form of amylase, [[B-amylase|β-amylase]] ({{EC number|3.2.1.2 }}) (alternative names: 1,4-α-&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-glucan maltohydrolase; glycogenase; saccharogen amylase) is also synthesized by [[bacteria]], [[fungi]], and [[plant]]s.  Working from the non-reducing end, β-amylase catalyzes the hydrolysis of the second α-1,4 glycosidic bond, cleaving off two glucose units ([[maltose]]) at a time.  During the [[ripening]] of [[fruit]], β-amylase breaks starch into maltose, resulting in the sweet flavor of ripe fruit.

Both α-amylase and β-amylase are present in seeds; β-amylase is present in an inactive form prior to [[germination]], whereas α-amylase and proteases appear once germination has begun. Many [[microbe]]s also produce amylase to degrade extracellular starches.  [[Animal]] tissues do not contain β-amylase, although it may be present in microorganisms contained within the [[Gastrointestinal tract|digestive tract]]. The optimum pH for β-amylase is 4.0–5.0&lt;ref name="worthington-biochem.com"&gt;[http://www.worthington-biochem.com/BA/default.html "Amylase, Alpha", I.U.B.: 3.2.1.11,4-α-D-Glucan glucanohydrolase].&lt;/ref&gt;

===γ-amylase===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Flatulence]] --&gt;
{{infobox enzyme
| Name = Gamma-amylase. Glucan 1,4-alpha-glucosidase
| EC_number = 3.2.1.3
| CAS_number = 9032-08-0
| IUBMB_EC_number = 3/2/1/3
| GO_code = GO:0004339
| image =

| caption =
}}
[[Glucan 1,4-a-glucosidase|γ-amylase]] ({{EC number|3.2.1.3 }}) (alternative names: Glucan 1,4-α-glucosidase; amyloglucosidase; Exo-1,4-α-glucosidase; glucoamylase; lysosomal α-glucosidase; 1,4-α-&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-glucan glucohydrolase) will cleave α(1–6) glycosidic linkages, as well as the last [[glycosidic bond|α(1–4)glycosidic linkages]] at the nonreducing end of [[amylose]] and [[amylopectin]], yielding [[glucose]]. The γ-amylase has most acidic optimum pH of all amylases because it is most active around pH 3.

==Uses==

===Fermentation===
Alpha and beta amylases are important in brewing beer and liquor made from sugars derived from starch.  In [[fermentation]], yeast ingest sugars and excrete alcohol.  In beer and some liquors, the sugars present at the beginning of fermentation have been produced by "mashing" grains or other starch sources (such as potatoes).  In traditional beer brewing, malted barley is mixed with hot water to create a "mash," which is held at a given temperature to allow the amylases in the malted grain to convert the barley's starch into sugars.  Different temperatures optimize the activity of alpha or beta amylase, resulting in different mixtures of fermentable and unfermentable sugars.  In selecting mash temperature and grain-to-water ratio, a brewer can change the alcohol content, mouthfeel, aroma, and flavor of the finished beer.

In some historic methods of producing alcoholic beverages, the conversion of starch to sugar starts with the brewer chewing grain to mix it with saliva.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chew It Up, Spit It Out, Then Brew. Cheers!|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/09/dining/09beer.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|work=New York Times|access-date=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice is no longer widely in use.

===Flour additive===
Amylases are used in breadmaking and to break down complex sugars, such as starch (found in flour), into simple sugars. [[Yeast]] then feeds on these simple sugars and converts it into the waste products of alcohol and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This imparts flavour and causes the bread to rise. While amylases are found naturally in yeast cells, it takes time for the yeast to produce enough of these enzymes to break down significant quantities of starch in the bread. This is the reason for long fermented doughs such as sour dough. Modern breadmaking techniques have included amylases (often in the form of [[malted barley]]) into [[bread improver]], thereby making the process faster and more practical for commercial use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Maton | first1 = Anthea | authorlink =  | first2 = Jean | last2 = Hopkins | first3 = Charles William | last3 = McLaughlin | first4 = Susan | last4 = Johnson | first5 = Maryanna Quon | last5 = Warner | first6 = David | last6 = LaHart | first7 = Jill D. | last7 = Wright | name-list-format = vanc | title = Human Biology and Health | publisher = Prentice Hall | year = 1993 | location = Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, USA | pages =  | isbn = 0-13-981176-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alpha amylase is often listed as an ingredient on commercially package milled flour.  Bakers with long exposure to amylase-enriched flour are at risk of developing dermatitis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Morren MA, Janssens V, Dooms-Gossens A, Van Hoeyveld E, Cornelis A, De Wolf-Peeters C, Heremans A | title = alpha-Amylase, a flour additive: an important cause of protein contact dermatitis in bakers | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology | volume = 29 | issue = 5 Pt 1 | pages = 723–8 | date = November 1993 | pmid = 8227545 | doi = 10.1016/0190-9622(93)70237-n }}&lt;/ref&gt; or asthma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Park HS, Kim HY, Suh YJ, Lee SJ, Lee SK, Kim SS, Nahm DH | title = Alpha amylase is a major allergenic component in occupational asthma patients caused by porcine pancreatic extract | journal = The Journal of Asthma | volume = 39 | issue = 6 | pages = 511–6 | date = September 2002 | pmid = 12375710 | doi = 10.1081/jas-120004918 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Molecular biology===
In [[molecular biology]], the presence of amylase can serve as an additional method of selecting for successful integration of a reporter construct in addition to antibiotic resistance. As reporter genes are flanked by homologous regions of the structural gene for amylase, successful integration will disrupt the amylase gene and prevent starch degradation, which is easily detectable through [[iodine]] staining.

===Medical uses===
Amylase also has medical applications in the use of [[Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy|Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Therapy]] (PERT). It is one of the components in Sollpura (Liprotamase) to help in the breakdown of [[saccharides]] into simple sugars.&lt;ref&gt;"Anthera Pharmaceuticals - Sollpura." Anthera Pharmaceuticals - Sollpura. N.p., n.d. Web. 21 July 2015.&lt;http://www.anthera.com/pipeline/science/sollpura.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150718042137/http://www.anthera.com/pipeline/science/sollpura.html |date=2015-07-18 }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other uses===
An inhibitor of alpha-amylase, called [[phaseolamin]], has been tested as a potential [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]] aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Udani J, Hardy M, Madsen DC | title = Blocking saccharide absorption and weight loss: a clinical trial using Phase 2 brand proprietary fractionated white bean extract | journal = Alternative Medicine Review | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 63–9 | date = March 2004 | pmid = 15005645 | url = http://www.thorne.com/altmedrev/.fulltext/9/1/63.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110728045340/http://www.thorne.com/altmedrev/.fulltext/9/1/63.pdf | deadurl = yes | archive-date = 2011-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When used as a [[food additive]], amylase has [[E number]] E1100, and may be derived from swine pancreas or mould mushroom.

Bacilliary amylase is also used in clothing and dishwasher [[detergent]]s to dissolve starches from fabrics and dishes.

Factory workers who work with amylase for any of the above uses are at increased risk of [[occupational asthma]]. Five to nine percent of bakers have a positive skin test, and a fourth to a third of bakers with breathing problems are hypersensitive to amylase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mapp CE | title = Agents, old and new, causing occupational asthma | journal = Occupational and Environmental Medicine | volume = 58 | issue = 5 | pages = 354–60, 290 | date = May 2001 | pmid = 11303086 | pmc = 1740131 | doi = 10.1136/oem.58.5.354 | url = http://oem.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11303086 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hyperamylasemia==
[[Blood serum]] amylase may be measured for purposes of [[medical diagnosis]]. A higher than normal concentration may reflect one of several medical conditions, including [[acute (medicine)|acute]] [[inflammation]] of the [[acute pancreatitis|pancreas]] (it may be measured concurrently with the more specific [[lipase]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merck.com/mmpe/print/sec02/ch015/ch015b.html|title=Acute Pancreatitis - Gastrointestinal Disorders - Merck Manuals Professional Edition|author=|date=|website=merck.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also perforated [[peptic ulcer]], torsion of an [[ovarian cyst]], [[strangulation]], [[ileus]], mesenteric ischemia, macroamylasemia and [[mumps]].  Amylase may be measured in other body fluids, including [[urine]] and [[peritoneum|peritoneal]] fluid.

A January 2007 study from [[Washington University in St. Louis]] suggests that saliva tests of the enzyme could be used to indicate sleep deficits, as the enzyme increases its activity in correlation with the length of time a subject has been deprived of sleep.&lt;ref&gt;[http://record.wustl.edu/news/page/normal/8539.html "First Biomarker for Human Sleepiness Identified"], ''Record'' of [[Washington University in St. Louis]], January 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1831, Erhard Friedrich Leuchs (1800–1837) described the [[hydrolysis]] of starch by saliva, due to the presence of an enzyme in saliva, "[[ptyalin]]", an amylase.&lt;ref&gt;Erhard Friedrich Leuchs (1831) [https://books.google.com/books?id=KSEAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA623#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Wirkung des Speichels auf Stärke"] (Effect of saliva on starch), ''Poggendorff's Annalen der Physik und Chemie'', vol. 22, page 623 (modern citation:  ''Annalen der Physik'', vol. 98, no. 8, page 623).

==Human evolution==
[[Saccharides]] are a food source rich in energy. Following the [[First agricultural revolution|agricultural revolution]] 12,000 years ago, human diet began to shift more to plant and animal domestication in place of gathering and hunting. Large polymers such as starch are partially hydrolyzed in the mouth by the enzyme amylase before being cleaved further into sugars. Therefore, humans that contained amylase in the saliva would benefit from increased ability to digest starch more efficiently and in higher quantities. Despite the obvious benefits, early humans did not possess salivary amylase, a trend that is also seen in evolutionary relatives of the human, such as chimpanzees and [[bonobo]]s, who possess either one or no copies of the gene responsible for producing salivary amylase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vuorisalo|first1=Timo|last2=Arjamaa|first2=Olli|title=Gene-Culture Coevolution and Human Diet|journal=American Scientist|date=March–April 2010|volume=98|issue=2|page=140|url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/feature/2010/2/gene-culture-coevolution-and-human-diet}}&lt;!--DOI NOT WORKING:10.1511/2010.83.140--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This gene, AMY1, originated in the pancreas. A duplication event of the AMY1 gene allowed it to evolve salivary specificity, leading to the production of amylase in the saliva. In addition the same event occurred independently in rodents, emphasizing the importance of salivary amylase in organisms that consume relatively large amounts of starch.&lt;ref name=Perry2007&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Perry GH, Dominy NJ, Claw KG, Lee AS, Fiegler H, Redon R, Werner J, Villanea FA, Mountain JL, Misra R, Carter NP, Lee C, Stone AC | title = Diet and the evolution of human amylase gene copy number variation | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 39 | issue = 10 | pages = 1256–60 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17828263 | pmc = 2377015 | doi = 10.1038/ng2123 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, not all humans possess the same number of copies of the AMY1 gene. Populations known to rely more on saccharides have a higher number of AMY1 copies than human populations that, by comparison, consume little starch. The number of AMY1 gene copies in humans can range from six copies in agricultural groups such as European-American and Japanese (two high starch populations) to only 2-3 copies in hunter-gatherer societies such as the [[Aka people|Biaka]], [[Datog]], and [[Yakuts]]. The correlation that exists between starch consumption and number of AMY1 copies specific to population suggest that more AMY1 copies in high starch populations has been selected for by natural selection and considered the favorable phenotype for those individuals. Therefore, it is most likely that the benefit of an individual possessing more copies of AMY1 in a high starch population increases fitness and produces healthier, fitter offspring. This fact is especially apparent when comparing geographically close populations with different eating habits that possess a different number of copies of the AMY1 gene. Such is the case for some Asian populations that have been shown to possess few AMY1 copies relative to some agricultural population in Asia. This offers strong evidence that natural selection has acted on this gene as opposed to the possibility that the gene has spread through genetic drift.&lt;ref name=Perry2007/&gt;

{{elections|image=|caption=|}}
'''Apportionment''' is the process by which seats in a [[Legislature|legislative body]] are distributed among  [[administrative divisions]] entitled to [[Representation (politics)|representation]].

==Apportionment in theory==
The simplest and most universal principle is that elections should give each voter's intentions equal weight.  This is both intuitive and stated in historical documents such as the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] (the [[Equal Protection Clause]]).  However, there are a variety of historical and technical reasons why this principle is not followed absolutely or, in some cases, as a first priority.

===Common problems===
Fundamentally, the representation of a population in the thousands or millions by a reasonable size, thus accountable governing body involves arithmetic that will not be exact.  Although it could make representation more exact for a representative's votes (on proposed laws and measures etc.) to be weighted according to the number of his constituents,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Toplak, Jurij, Equal Voting Weight of All: Finally 'One Person, One Vote' from Hawaii to Maine? |publisher=Temple Law Review, Vol. 81, 2009, p. 123-176 |url=http://www.temple.edu/law/tlawrev/content/issues/81.1/81.1_toplak.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127031306/http://www.temple.edu/law/tlawrev/content/issues/81.1/81.1_toplak.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; it avoids complexity in governance, giving equality between representatives, if each elected representative has exactly 1 vote.

Over time, populations migrate and change in number, and preferences change.{{clarify|date=April 2018|what does the last phrase mean? political preferences? If so that is not strictly relevant? Isn't it an allusion to the by-product of varying social, economic and psychological conditions?}}  Governing bodies, however, usually exist for a defined term of office.  While [[Parliamentary]] systems provide for dissolution of the body in reaction to political events, no system tries to make real-time adjustments (during one term of office) to reflect demographic changes.  Instead, any [[redistricting]] takes effect at the next scheduled election or next scheduled [[census]].

===Apportionment by district===
In some representative assemblies, each member represents a geographic district.  Equal representation requires that districts comprise the same number of residents or voters.  But this is not universal, for reasons including the following:

*In [[federation]]s like the [[United States]], and [[Confederation#Canada|confederations]] like [[Canada]], the regions, states, or provinces are important as more than mere election districts.  For example, residents of New York State identify as New Yorkers and not merely as members of some 415th Congressional district; the state also has institutional interests that it seeks to pursue in Congress through its representatives.  Consequently, election districts do not span regions.
*Malapportionment might be deliberate, as when the governing documents guarantee outlying regions a specific number of seats.  [[Denmark]] guarantees two seats each for Greenland and the Faroe Islands; Spain (see [[#Spain|below]]) has a number of designated seats; and Canada (see [[#Canada|below]]) favors its territories.  Remote regions might have special views to which the governing body should give dedicated weight, otherwise might be inclined to [[Secession|secede]].
*A lowest common denominator between adjoining voters exists, the ''voting place'' or ''administrative quantum'' (for example, a municipality, a [[precinct]], a polling district) traditionally designed for voting convenience, tending to unite small clusters of homes and to remain little changed.  The government (or an independent body) does not organize the perfect number of voters into an election district, but a roughly appropriate number of voting places.
*The basis for apportionment may be out of date.  For example, in the United States, apportionment follows the decennial [[census]].  The states conducted the 2010 elections with districts apportioned according to the 2000 Census.  The lack of accuracy does not justify the present cost and perceived intrusion of a new census before each biennial election.

A perfectly apportioned governing body would assist but does not ensure good representation; voters who did not vote for their district's winner might have no representative who is disposed to voice their opinion in the governing body. Conversely, a representative in the governing body may voice the opinions held by a voter who is not actually their constituent, though representatives usually seek to serve their own constituents first and will only voice the interests of an outside group of voters if it pertains to their district as well or is of national importance. The representative has the power, and in many theories or jurisdictions the duty, to represent the whole cohort of people from their district.

===Apportionment by party list===
Nations such as [[Israel]] and the [[Netherlands]] use [[party-list proportional representation]] elections.  [[Mexico]] does so for some of the members of its lower house.

In this system, voters do not vote for a person to represent their geographic district, but for a [[political party]] that aligns with the voter's philosophy.  Each party names a number of representatives based on the number of votes it receives nationally.

This system tallies (agglomerates) more of the voters' preferences.  As in other systems parties with very few voters do not earn a representative in the governing body.  Moreover, most such systems impose a threshold that a party must reach (for example, some percentage of the total vote) to qualify to obtain representatives in the body which eliminates extreme parties, to make the governing body as orderly in non-proportionate systems. With the minimum votes threshold version, if a subtype of [[single-issue politics]] based on a local issue exists, those parties or candidates distancing themselves from a broad swathe of electoral districts, such as marginal [[secession]]ists, or using a marginal [[minority language]], may find themselves without representation.

The vast majority of voters elect representatives of their philosophies.  However, unlike district systems (or the hybrid models) no one elects a representative that represents him/her, or the specific region, and voters might reduce personal contact with their representatives.

===Mathematics of apportionment===
There are many different mathematical schemes for calculating apportionment, differing primarily in how they handle rounding of fractional representatives.  The schemes can produce different results in terms of seats for the relevant party or sector. Additionally, all methods are subject to one or more [[apportionment paradox|anomalies]].  The article on the [[largest remainder method]] presents several schemes and discusses their trade-offs, with examples.

==Malapportionment==
Malapportionment is the creation of electoral districts with divergent ratios of voters to representatives. For example, if one single-member district has 10,000 voters and another has 100,000 voters, voters in the former district have ten times the influence, per person, over the governing body.  Malapportionment may be deliberate, for reasons such as favouring [[Equity (legal concept)|equity]] of groups over [[Social equality|equality]] of individuals. For example, in a [[federation]], each member unit may have the same representation regardless of its population.

The effect might not be just a vague empowerment of some voters but a systematic bias to the nation's government. Many instances worldwide arise in which large, sparsely populated rural regions are given equal representation to densely packed urban areas.&lt;ref name = "NYT031013" /&gt; For example, in the United States (see [[#United States|below]]), the Republican Party benefits from institutional advantages to rural states with low populations, such that the Senate and the Presidency may reflect results counter to the total popular vote.  Unequal representation that does not introduce biases into the governing body is not as controversial.

Unequal representation can be measured in the following ways:
*By the [[ratio]] of the most populous electoral district to the least populous.  In the two figures above, the ratio is 10:1.  A ratio approaching 1:1 means there are no anomalies among districts.  In India in 1991, a ratio of nearly 50:1 was measured.&lt;ref&gt;The largest district, Thane, had a population of 1,744,592, while the smallest district, Lakeshadweep, had a population of 31,665.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' decision of the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] found ratios of up to 1081:1 in state legislatures.  A higher ratio measures the severity of the worst anomalies, but does not indicate whether inequality is prevalent. The maximum electoral disparity.
*By the [[standard deviation]] of the electorates of electoral districts.
*By the smallest percentage of voters that could win a majority in the governing body due to disparities in the populations of districts.  For example, in a 61-member body, this would be half the voters in the 31 districts with the lowest populations.  It is persuasive to show that far fewer than 50% of the voters could win a majority in the governing body.  But it requires additional research to conclude that such an outcome is realistic: whether the malapportionment is systematic and designed to bias the body, or is the result of random factors that give extra power to voters whose interests are unlikely to coincide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://localparty.org/engine.html |title=Engine |publisher=Localparty.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when electoral districts have similar populations, legislators may draw the boundaries to pursue private agendas; see [[Gerrymandering]].

==By country==

===Australia===
The [[Australian Senate]] is elected on a basis of equality among the States: all States elect 12 senators. Tasmania, with a population of 502,000, elects the same number of senators as New South Wales, with almost 7.1 million. This was deliberate under the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]] to protect the less populous States, without which federation would not have been agreed to, and can only be changed via a [[Referendums in Australia#Constitutional provisions|national referendum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/pubs/txtnov96.htm |title=Parliament of Australia: Senate: The Senate: a short description |publisher=Aph.gov.au |date=2006-03-02 |accessdate=2010-04-18| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100505190124/http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/pubs/txtnov96.htm| archivedate= 5 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been malapportionment of electoral districts in both the Federal and State legislatures in the past, often resulting in rural constituencies containing far fewer voters than urban ones and maintaining in power those parties that have rural support despite polling fewer popular votes. Past apportionments in [[Queensland]], [[Western Australia]] and the '[[Playmander]]' in [[South Australia]] were notorious examples of the differences between urban and rural constituency sizes.  In extreme cases, rural areas had four times the voting power of metropolitan areas.  Supporters of such arrangements claimed Australia's urban population dominates the countryside and that these practices gave fair representation to country people. (See: [[Australian electoral system#Gerrymandering and malapportionment]].)

=== Canada ===
In Canada, each [[House of Commons of Canada#Members and electoral districts|federal electoral district]] ("riding") is represented by one Member of Parliament (MP). Ridings are based on population, but each territory is also given an MP; so Nunavut receives one MP even though its population in 2006 was only 29,474.

Certain provisions in the Constitution and law (the "grandfather clause" and the "senatorial clause") guarantee that provinces cannot have fewer MPs than they had in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.ca/scripts/fedrep/federal_e/red/appendices_e.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101209024614/http://www.elections.ca/scripts/fedrep/federal_e/red/appendices_e.htm |archivedate=2010-12-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The apportionment method is to grant one MP to each territory, and allocate 279 other MPs according to population among the 10 provinces. After doing so, the provinces with slower historical population growth since joining the Confederation receive extra ridings so as not to lose MPs. After the 1991 Census, 19 extra ridings were created, making a total of 301. After the 2001 Census, seven more ridings were created, making a total of 308.

That ridings were not eliminated but only added created huge disparities. For example, in 2006 the [[Peace River (electoral district)|Peace River]] riding in Alberta had a population of 138,009, whilst [[Charlottetown (electoral district)|Charlottetown]] riding in Prince Edward Island had a population of 32,174; yet both ridings received equal representation in the House of Commons. Rural ridings even in populous provinces also tended to have more constituents than urban ridings.

The Fair Representation Act, passed in 2011 and effective for the federal election that took place in 2015, specified a uniform "electoral quotient" of 111,166 (to be readjusted after each future census) but again ensured that no province would lose ridings, increasing the size of the House of Commons to 338.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=30 more MPs for rebalanced House of Commons|publisher=CBC News|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/30-more-mps-for-rebalanced-house-of-commons-1.994608|date=October 26, 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Parliament===
{{main|Apportionment in the European Parliament}}
[[Apportionment in the European Parliament|The apportionment of seats]] in the [[European Parliament]]  between [[Member state of the European Union|European Union member states]] uses a principle of [[degressive proportionality]]; those with larger population have more [[Member of the European Parliament|Members of the European Parliament]] (MEPs) but a higher population per MEP. The exact apportionment is specified by [[Treaties of the European Union|negotiated treaty]]. While most member states elect their MEPs from a single national constituency, six are subdivided into multiple [[European Parliament constituency|European Parliament constituencies]]. Those of France, Ireland, and Italy have low variance in population per MEP, as does the UK with [[Northern Ireland (European Parliament constituency)|Northern Ireland]] as an outlier. Poland's vary from 559,000 in [[Warsaw (European Parliament constituency)|Warsaw]] to 1,326,000 in [[Podlaskie and Warmian-Masurian (European Parliament constituency)|Podlaskie and Warmian-Masurian]], the latter figure higher than in any of the states with larger populations. Belgium's division into "electoral colleges" is not strictly geographic, but rather by [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium|language community]], such that voters in the officially bilingual [[Brussels-Capital Region]] can vote in either the [[Dutch-speaking electoral college|Dutch-speaking]] or [[French-speaking electoral college|French-speaking]] electoral college. The single-MEP [[German-speaking electoral college]] significantly overrepresents the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium]].

===Japan ===
Since electoral system of [[House of Representatives (Japan)|Shugiin]] was changed to [[Parallel voting]] in 1994, each [[Prefectures of Japan|prefecture]] has been guaranteed one seat apportionment regardless of its population. This apportionment method was called "separated one method" and the supreme court judged that the system is under unconstitutional state in 2009, 2012, and 2016. 

In 2017, electoral districts were rearranged so that every district does not have twice as large population as another district.

===Malaysia===
The voters in rural districts are over-represented in Malaysia while the urban districts are under-represented. The largest parliamentary seat (Kapar) is nine times larger than the smallest one (Putrajaya). On average, the rural parliamentary seats are over-represented by six times compared to the urban seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/one-rural-vote-worth-six-urban-ballots-favours-bn-analysts|title=One rural vote worth six urban ballots, favours BN, analysts say|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224110920/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/one-rural-vote-worth-six-urban-ballots-favours-bn-analysts|archivedate=2013-12-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
Between 1881 and 1945 New Zealand applied a system of malapportionment called the [[country quota]], which required urban districts to contain more people than rural ones but did not give them any equivalent increase in representation.

===Norway===
Out of the 169 seats in the [[Storting]], 150 are apportioned among the 19 [[Counties of Norway]] with deliberate bias in favor of rural areas. The number of seats for a county is decided using a formula in which a county receives 1 point for every inhabitant and 1.8 points for every square kilometer of land area. However, the bias is reduced by the 19 compensation seats, which are given to parties that are underrepresented. Thus the system does not have a great effect on the partisan composition of the Storting, but does result in more MPs coming from rural counties. Electoral researcher Bernt Aardal calculated that if the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 2009|2009 parliamentary election]] had been conducted without this bias, the Labour Party and Progress Party would both have lost a seat, while the Red Party and Liberal Party would each have gained one, reducing the majority of the Red-Green Coalition from 3 seats to 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Rødgrønt flertall uansett valgordning | work = [[Aftenposten]] | date = September 28, 2009 | language = Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slovakia===
The difference in electorates between the districts was a matter before the Constitutional Court and UN Human Rights Committee, both of which found the rights of a candidate not elected in a district with larger electorate to be violated, but did not request new elections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bayefsky.com/html/slovakia_t5_iccpr_923_2000.php Human Rights Committee views in case Mátyus v. Slovakia, CCPR/C/75/D/923/2000], 2002 &lt;!-- http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/undocs/923-2000.html --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South Africa ===
In the [[South African general election, 1948|South African general election of 1948]], South Africa's constituency boundaries meant that sparsely populated rural constituencies in the Afrikaner heartland had relatively few eligible voters compared to the urban constituencies in Cape Town. The rural electorates often strongly supported the [[Herenigde Nasionale Party|Reunited National Party]], led by [[Daniel Malan]] and the urban electorates often supported [[Jan Christiaan Smuts]]' [[United Party (South Africa)|United Party]] (the incumbent prime minister and his party, 90% of whose seats were urban). The 1948 general election saw the Reunited National Party winning more seats than the United Party, meaning that Malan was able to form a government bilaterally with the [[Afrikaner Party]] and gain an absolute majority in parliament. This was despite the fact the United Party had won 49% of the vote compared to 38% for Malan's party. By comparison, the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|British general election of 1945]] was also conducted under [[first past the post]] but with more equal constituencies, and produced a landslide victory for a party which received 47% of the vote. Malapportionment was a key tool that allowed the National Party to implement its [[Apartheid]] program within the notionally democratic parliament.

=== Spain ===
The [[Spanish Congress of Deputies]] consists of 350 members. Each Spanish province is a constituency entitled to an initial minimum of two seats for a total of 100 seats, while the North African enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla are allocated one member each. The remaining 248 seats are allocated among the fifty provinces in proportion to their populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electionresources.org/es/index_en.html |title=Election Resources on the Internet: Elections to the Spanish Congress of Deputies |publisher=Electionresources.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is that the smaller provinces are virtually guaranteed a minimum of three seats and have a disproportionate share of seats relative to their electorate. For example, in 2004, Spain had 34,571,831 voters, an average of 98,777 voters per deputy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electionresources.org/es/congress.php?election=2004 |title=Election Resources on the Internet: Elections to the Spanish Congress of Deputies - Results Lookup |publisher=Electionresources.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the number of voters per deputy varied from 129,269 in Barcelona &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electionresources.org/es/congress.php?election=2004&amp;province=08 |title=Election Resources on the Internet: Elections to the Spanish Congress of Deputies - Results Lookup |publisher=Electionresources.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 127,377 in Madrid &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electionresources.org/es/congress.php?election=2004&amp;province=28 |title=Election Resources on the Internet: Elections to the Spanish Congress of Deputies - Results Lookup |publisher=Electionresources.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 38,714 and 26,177 respectively in the smallest provinces of Teruel &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electionresources.org/es/congress.php?election=2004&amp;province=44 |title=Election Resources on the Internet: Elections to the Spanish Congress of Deputies - Results Lookup |publisher=Electionresources.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Soria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electionresources.org/es/congress.php?election=2004&amp;province=42 |title=Election Resources on the Internet: Elections to the Spanish Congress of Deputies - Results Lookup |publisher=Electionresources.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Spanish Senate each of the forty-seven mainland provinces are assigned four seats, while the three largest islands are allocated three seats each, and the seven smaller islands one each. The North African enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla are allocated two seats each. Additionally, the legislative assemblies of the seventeen autonomous communities into which the provinces of Spain are grouped are entitled to appoint at least one Senator each, as well as one Senator for every million voters. The result is a bias in favour of mainly rural areas. For example, the community of Madrid with 4,458,540 voters in 2004 has 9 senators while Castilla y León with 2,179,521 voters has a total of 39 senators.

===United Kingdom===
The number of electors in a [[List of United Kingdom Parliament constituencies|United Kingdom constituency]] can vary considerably. This variation has resulted from:
*Legislation; beginning with the Redistribution of Seats Act 1958, which replaced an electoral quota (ideal population) for the whole United Kingdom with four separate quotas: England 69,534; Northern Ireland 67,145, Wales 58,383, and Scotland 54,741 voters per constituency.
*Decisions of the four [[Boundary Commissions (United Kingdom)|UK Boundary Commissions]] to favour geographically "natural" districts.
*Population migrations between boundary reviews, which have tended to decrease the number of voters in inner-city districts, a trend that usually favours the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Periodic reviews by the Boundary Commissions are submitted to the House of Commons for approval, primarily to prevent the reemergence of any new [[rotten borough]]s. The House is allowed to ignore or delay implementation of their findings, but not change them. The [[Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies]], instigated to reduce the number of MPs from 650 to 600 and address the current malapportionment, was suspended until after the 2015 and 2017 general elections, by votes of the House in 2013 and 2016.

===United States ===
Apportionment at the [[Federal government of the United States|federal level]] of the [[United States]] government is guided by the rubrics of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]]. The writers of the Constitution designed the nation's [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] [[Legislature]] to include, a [[United States Senate|Senate]] (the upper legislative chamber) to represent the [[U.S. state|states]], and a [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] (the lower legislative chamber) to represent the people rather than the states. Each state—in its entirety—is equally represented in the Senate by two senators, regardless of its population. The constitution guarantees each state at least one representative for its people in the House, while the size of a state's House delegation depends on its total population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=Congressional Apportionment| url=http://history.house.gov/Institution/Apportionment/Apportionment/| publisher=Office of the Historian and the Clerk of the House Office of Art and Archives, United States House of Representatives| location=Washington, D.C.| accessdate=February 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each state is apportioned a number of seats which approximately corresponds to its share of the aggregate population of the 50 states, as determined by the most recent decennial [[United States Census|U.S. census]]. This governance plan came about as a result of the [[Connecticut Compromise]] reached during [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] of 1787 between delegates from states with a large population and those from states with a small population. The Constitution also prescribes that the [[President of the United States|President]] and [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] be elected by a group of people apportioned among the states in the same numbers as their representatives in Congress, called the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]].

As the Constitution's apportionment procedures are established solely for the [[Perpetual Union|states in the Union]], neither the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] nor the country's [[Territories of the United States|territories and possessions]] are included. Therefore, they do not have the same representation in the federal government as states do.

====Senate====
Under [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article I]], Section 3, of the U.S. Constitution, each state has two seats in the Senate. This equality of representation is shielded from being amended by [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|Article V]] which specifies that no state, without its consent, shall be deprived of having the same number of seats as the others. (Neither the District of Columbia, nor the country's territories and possessions have representation in the Senate, as they are not states.)

Senators from each state were originally elected by that state's legislature, and influenced only indirectly by the voters, through their election of state legislators. The [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|17th Amendment]], ratified in 1913, provided for direct election of U.S. Senators. It did not however, change the principle of equal representation of the states in the Senate, which, as [[James Madison]] noted in ''The [[Federalist No. 39]]'', ensures a [[Political system|polity]] of mixed sovereignty, one in which the states are an integral part of the federal government. This, of course, is precisely why those who do not think the Constitution not ''democratic'' enough would wish to remove that portion of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/5/essays/131/prohibition-on-amendment-equal-suffrage-in-the-senate|title=Prohibition on Amendment: Equal Suffrage in the Senate|last=Rossum|first=Ralph|publisher=The Heritage Foundation|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 38 million people who live in the nation’s  22 [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|least populous states]] are represented by 44 senators, while the 38 million residents of California, the most populous state, are represented by two.&lt;ref name = "NYT031013" &gt;{{cite news | newspaper=The New York Times | url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/03/11/us/politics/democracy-tested.html | title=Smaller States Find Outsize Clout Growing in Senate | first=Adam | last=Liptak | date=March 11, 2013 | accessdate=December 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====House====
{{Main|United States congressional apportionment}}
The House of Representatives, by comparison, is required by Article I, Section 2, to be "apportioned among the several states... according to their respective numbers." The Constitution does not provide for either fractional votes nor Congressional seats spanning states, and guarantees every state at least one Representative. Thus, a resident of a state whose population just barely qualifies for two Representatives has almost twice the relative influence as a resident of a state that does not quite qualify for two.

{{usc|2|2a}}, based on the [[Reapportionment Act of 1929]], reapportions the Representatives to the states following each decennial census. It left the states to decide how and whether to [[redistrict]], except in the case that the census changes the state's number of Representatives, but federal court cases now require states to redistrict based on each census.

However, here too, other criteria take precedence over exact equality of representation. In 2012, the Supreme Court endorsed ''[[2011 term per curiam opinions of the Supreme Court of the United States#Tennant v. Jefferson County|Tennant v. Jefferson County]]'' the use of other criteria, including the legislature's reluctance to move voters between districts, to put incumbent Congressmen in the same district, and to divide [[County|counties]] between districts, when the State of [[West Virginia]] redrew its three Congressional districts with a disparity of 0.79% between the most populous and least populous district.

Washington, D.C. and the five largest possessions are instead represented by [[Non-voting members of the United States House of Representatives|non-voting delegates]]. During the tenure of [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Tip O'Neill]] between 1977 and 1987, these delegates were allowed to vote on legislation except for the final, formal vote on enactment. The country's other possessions do not have any representation in the House.

====President====
The U.S. President is elected only indirectly by voters, through the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]. Under [[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article II]], Section 1, Clause 2, of the U.S. Constitution, the number of electors for every state is the sum of the number of that state's senators and representatives. This was also a result of the original Connecticut Compromise between large and small states. The effect is to give each state a two-elector bonus (for the state's two Senators) regardless of population. A low-population state does not receive one elector in a body of 435, but three electors out of 535. The two-elector bonus is comparatively minor for a state with a high population.

Washington, D.C. did not have a voice in the selection of the President until 1961, when the [[Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution|23rd Amendment]] was ratified, giving D.C. the treatment of a state in the Electoral College ("but in no event more than the least populous State"; that is, three electors, increasing the total number of electors to 538).

U.S. territories and possessions still have no voice in the selection of the President. In 2000, [[Puerto Rico]] attempted to include the U.S. Presidential election on its ballots, knowing that the Electoral College would not count its result. However, the move was declared unconstitutional by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit|First Circuit Court of Appeals]], and the Presidential ballot was not handed out to voters on election day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Puerto Rico Presidential Election Cancelled|url=http://www.thegreenpapers.com/News/20001201-1.html|work=The Green Papers: News|accessdate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A separate obstacle to proportional representation is that almost all of the states choose electors on a "[[Plurality voting system|winner-take-all]]" basis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morris|first=Irwin L.|year=2010|title=The American Presidency: An Analytical Approach|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-49162-4|oclc=607985767|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the state's electors are awarded to the candidate with the most [[Popular vote (representative democracy)|popular vote]]s in that state. Maine and Nebraska are the only states that instead use the "congressional district method", selecting one elector within each congressional district by popular vote and awarding two electors by a statewide popular vote.&lt;ref name="ecollege"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.fairvote.org/e_college/me_ne.htm|title=The Electoral College – Maine and Nebraska|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the "winner-takes-all" method used by most of the states, a candidate can still win the presidency without winning the national popular vote (such as what happened in [[United States presidential election, 1824|1824]], [[United States presidential election, 1876|1876]], [[United States presidential election, 1888|1888]], [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000]], and [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016]]).

The Electoral College denies voters equal influence in the presidential election. However, it induces presidential candidates to campaign outside large population centers and insulates small states from being overwhelmed by election irregularities in large population centers. On the other hand, the electoral college encourages political campaigners to focus on so-called "[[swing states]]" while ignoring the rest of the country. States in which polling shows no clear favorite are usually inundated with campaign visits, television advertising, get-out-the-vote efforts by party organizers and debates, while "four out of five" voters in the national election are "absolutely ignored," according to one assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Katrina vanden Heuvel|title=It's Time to End the Electoral College|work=The Nation|date=November 7, 2012|url=http://www.thenation.com/blog/171115/its-time-end-electoral-college|accessdate=November 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the event that the Electoral College does not produce a majority for any candidate, the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|12th Amendment]] (roughly as Article II, Section 1 had done) throws the election to the U.S. House (the U.S. Senate choosing the Vice President), but under a procedure where each state's delegation, regardless of size, casts one vote—thus giving smaller states more voting power in the event of a deadlock than larger states. For example, Wyoming, with only one representative, has the same power as California, with 53 representatives.

====State senates====
The United States government was a construct of the thirteen states, and the Constitution's only original constraint on the states was, in [[Article Four of the United States Constitution|Article IV]], Section 4, that the federal government "guarantee to every state... a republican form of government." Though the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] contains the [[Equal Protection Clause]] and bars the states from "abridging" voting rights, the text does not address apportionment.

Instead, most state legislatures imitated the Congress, in which the lower house is apportioned by population, while the upper house is apportioned by some other criterion. For example, each [[county]] might have one state senator.

In the 1960s, in cases such as ''[[Baker v. Carr]]'' and ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' (the "[[one man, one vote]]" decision), the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled that the Equal Protection Clause authorized judicial remedy when a significant disparity in population size arises between electoral districts within a state. The biggest immediate effect was to require that state senate districts have substantially equal populations, as [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Earl Warren]] wrote, "Legislators represent people, not trees or acres." These cases also opened apportionment of state houses of representatives to review by the judiciary.

====State legislatures====
In most states, the [[legislature]] draws the boundaries of electoral districts, including its own; and even court decisions that set aside malapportionment acknowledge that political self-interest plays a role in decisions of the legislature.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in [http://www.courts.state.nh.us/supreme/opinions/2002/0207/house085.htm ''Burling v. Chandler,'' 148 NH 143] the [[New Hampshire]] supreme court had no problem that various redistricting proposals had partisan motives, though this observation prompted it to mandate its own redistricting map rather than endorse any of the submissions.&lt;/ref&gt; Legislatures and the [[majority party]] can pursue self-interest by [[gerrymandering]]—contriving legislative districts to promote the election of specific individuals or to concentrate the opposition party's core constituencies in a small number of districts—or by simply declining to reapportion at all, so that the make-up of a legislature fails to track the evolving demographics of the state.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the Alabama state legislature failed to reapportion either the state House or Senate from 1901 until 1972. By 1960, 25% of the population could elect a majority, and white and rural interests dominated the legislature. See [http://elections.gmu.edu/Redistricting/AL.htm Dr. Michael McDonald, "US Elections Project: Alabama Redistricting Summary", George Mason University], accessed 6 Apr 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017192719/http://elections.gmu.edu/Redistricting/AL.htm |date=October 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many states now [[redistrict]] state electoral districts following each decennial federal census, as ''Reynolds v. Sims'' required for Congressional districts.

A state may draw districts that span political subdivisions and elect multiple representatives, and may draw [[floterial district]]s,&lt;ref&gt;The article on [[floterial district]]s discusses litigation in New Hampshire that showed that pursuit of equality of representation involves trade-offs; in that case, proximity of representatives to the voters.&lt;/ref&gt; to match representation to population more precisely than the U.S. House does (see above).

The basis of apportionment has also been litigated. In ''[[Evenwel v. Abbott]]'' (2016), a unanimous Supreme Court ruled&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/14-940 ''Evenwel v. Abbott'']&lt;/ref&gt; that "constitutional history, precedent, and practice" support basing districts on population, even when some districts thus had 40% more voters than others.

====Prospects for change====
Arguments for or against change to these institutions often have political overtones. The [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] often advocates change, as it is generally more popular in large cities and many of the more populated states, while the [[U.S. Republican Party|Republican Party]] often defends the current system, as that party is more popular in rural areas and many of the less populated states.

Any changes would require amendment of the Constitution. But the procedure for doing this also contains protections for states with low populations. [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|Article V]], Section 1 requires any amendments to be ratified by three-fourths of the states (currently, 38). Most small states would refuse to ratify any amendment that nullified their traditional advantages.

Various states have joined the [[National Popular Vote Interstate Compact]], pledging that their legislatures will direct their Presidential electors to vote for whichever presidential candidate wins the national popular vote. This would partly counteract the advantage the Electoral College gives to low-population states, though it might reduce the joiners' influence during presidential campaigns.

===Domain name===
The CatholicVote.org [[domain name]] was first used by the Catholic Alliance in early 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicvote.org/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000302210506/http://www.catholicvote.org/ |title=CatholicVote.org Homepage&amp;nbsp;– a project of Catholic Alliance |publisher=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |archivedate=March 2, 2000 |accessdate=August 15, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic Alliance was a grassroots group of Americans who agreed with the platform of the fundamental evangelical Protestant [[Christian Coalition of America|Christian Coalition]] but wished to widen the Coalition's scope to include Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=frt7RDOT1PUC&amp;pg=PA77 |page=77 |title=Encyclopedia of American Religion and Politics |first1=Paul A. |last1=Djupe |first2=Laura R. |last2=Olson |publisher=Infobase Publishing |year=2003 |isbn=1438130201}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic Alliance, formed in 1995, held the website until mid-2002.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28668">'''Civil religion''', also referred to as a '''civic religion''',&lt;ref name=BRMyers/&gt; is the implicit religious values of a nation, as expressed through public [[ritual]]s, symbols (such as the national flag), and ceremonies on sacred days and at sacred places (such as monuments, battlefields, or national cemeteries). It is distinct from churches, although church officials and ceremonies are sometimes incorporated into the practice of civil religion.{{sfn|Wimberley|Swatos|1998}} Countries described as having a civil religion include France,&lt;ref name=BaylacFrance/&gt; South Korea,&lt;ref name=BRMyers/&gt; and the former Soviet Union.{{sfn|Tumarkin|1983}} As a concept, it originated in French [[political thought]] and became a major topic for U.S. [[sociologist]]s since its use by [[Robert Bellah]] in 1960.

==Origin of term==
[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] coined the term in chapter 8, book 4 of ''[[The Social Contract]]'' (1762), to describe what he regarded as the moral and spiritual foundation essential for any modern society. For Rousseau, civil religion was intended simply as a form of social cement, helping to unify the [[State (polity)|state]] by providing it with sacred authority. In his book, [[Rousseau]] outlines the simple [[dogma]]s of the civil religion:
# [[deity]]
# [[afterlife]]
# the reward of [[virtue]] and the punishment of [[vice]]
# the exclusion of [[religious intolerance]]{{sfnm |1a1=Bellah |1y=1967 |2a1=Juergensmeyer |2y=2003 |2p=245 |3a1=Meyer-Dinkgrafe |3y=2004 |3p=30 |4a1=Shanks |4y=2000 |4p=29}}
The Italian historian [[Emilio Gentile]] has studied the roots and development of the concept and proposed a division of two types of religions of politics: a civil religion and a [[political religion]].{{sfn|Gentile|2006}}

==Sociology of religion==
[[File:National Cathedral.jpg|thumb|The [[Washington National Cathedral]] in [[Washington, DC]], is often used for state [[funeral]]s for political leaders.]]
In the [[sociology of religion]], '''civil religion''' is the [[folk religion]] of a [[nation]] or a [[politics|political]] [[culture]].{{dubious|date=October 2012}}{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Civil religion stands somewhat above folk religion in its social and political status, since by definition it suffuses an entire society, or at least a segment of a society; and is often practiced by [[leadership|leader]]s within that society.  On the other hand, it is somewhat less than an [[establishment of religion]], since established churches have official [[clergy]] and a relatively fixed and formal relationship with the government that establishes them. Civil religion is usually practiced by political leaders who are laypeople and whose leadership is not specifically spiritual.

===Examples===

Such civil religion encompasses such things as:{{sfn|Bellah|1992}}
*the invocation of God in political speeches and public monuments;
*the quotation of [[religious text]]s on public occasions by political leaders;
*the veneration of past political leaders;
*the use of the lives of these leaders to teach moral ideals;
*the veneration of veterans and casualties of a nation's wars;
*religious gatherings called by political leaders;
*the use of religious symbols on public buildings;
*the use of public buildings for worship;
*[[founding myth]]s and other [[national myth]]s
and similar religious or quasi-religious practices.

==Practical political philosophy==
[[File:Arc De Triomphe 2004.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Arc de Triomphe]]'' in [[Paris]] commemorates those who died in France's wars.]]

Professional commentators on political and social matters writing in newspapers and magazines sometimes use the term '''''civil religion''''' or '''''civic religion''''' to refer to [[ritual]] expressions of [[patriotism]] of a sort practiced in all countries, not always including religion in the conventional sense of the word.

Among such practices are the following:{{sfn|Bellah|1992}}
*crowds singing the national anthem at certain public gatherings;
*parades or display of the national flag on certain [[National Day|patriotic holidays]];
*reciting [[oath of allegiance|oaths of allegiance]] (like the pledges of allegiance found in countries such as the [[Pledge of Allegiance (Bahamas)|Bahamas]], [[Pledge of Allegiance to the Philippine Flag|the Philippines]], and [[Pledge of Allegiance (South Korea)|South Korea]]);
*ceremonies concomitant to the inauguration of a president or the coronation of a monarch;
*retelling exaggerated, one-sided, and simplified [[mythology|mythologized]] tales of [[List of national founders|national founders]] and other great leaders or great events (e.g., battles, mass migrations) in the past (in this connection, see also [[romantic nationalism]]);
*[[monument]]s commemorating great leaders of the past or historic events;
*monuments to dead soldiers or annual ceremonies to remember them;
*expressions of [[reverence (attitude)|reverence]] for the state, the predominant national racial/ethnic group,&lt;ref name=BRMyers/&gt; the national constitution, or the monarch;
*expressions of solidarity with people perceived as being national kindred but residing in a foreign country or a foreign country perceived as being similar enough to the nation to warrant admiration and/or loyalty;&lt;ref name=BRMyers/&gt;
*expressions of hatred towards another country or foreign ethnic group perceived as either currently being an enemy of the state and/or as having wronged and slighted the nation in the past;&lt;ref name=BRMyers/&gt;
*public display of the coffin of a recently deceased political leader.

==Relation between the two conceptions==

These two conceptions (sociological and political) of '''civil religion''' substantially overlap. In Britain, where church and state are constitutionally joined, the monarch's coronation is an elaborate religious rite celebrated by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. In France, secular ceremonies are separated from religious observances to a greater degree than in most countries. In the United States, a president being inaugurated is told by the Constitution to choose between saying [[oath of office|"I do solemnly swear..."]] (customarily followed by "so help me God", although those words are not Constitutionally required) and saying "I do solemnly affirm..." (in which latter case no mention of God would be expected).

==History==

===Prehistory and classical antiquity===
{{Disputed section|date=September 2011}}
[[File:Bas relief from Arch of Marcus Aurelius showing sacrifice.jpg|thumb|The emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]], his [[capite velato|head ritually covered]], conducts a public sacrifice at the Temple of Jupiter]]
Practically all the ancient and prehistoric reigns suffused politics with religion. Often the leaders, such as the [[Pharaoh]] or the [[Chinese Emperor]] were considered manifestations of a [[Divinity]]. Tribal world-view was often [[Pantheism|Pantheistic]], the tribe being an extension of its surrounding nature and the leaders having roles and symbols derived from the animal hierarchy and significant natural phenomena (such as storm).

The religion of the Athenian [[polis]] was a secular [[polytheism]] focused on the [[Olympian Gods]] and was celebrated in the civic festivals. Religion was a matter of state and the Athenian [[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|Ecclesia]] deliberated on matters of religion. Atheism and the introduction of foreign gods were forbidden in Athens and punishable by death. For example, the Athenian ecclesia charged that [[Socrates]] worshiped gods other than those sanctioned by the polis and condemned him to death.

Rome also had a civil religion, whose first Emperor [[Augustus]] officially attempted to revive the dutiful practice of classical [[paganism]]. [[Religion in Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]] were essentially local in character; the [[Roman Empire]] attempted to unite its disparate territories by inculcating an ideal of Roman piety, and by a [[syncretism|syncretistic]] identifying of the gods of conquered territories with the Greek and Roman [[Greek mythology|pantheon]].  In this campaign, Augustus erected monuments such as the ''[[Ara Pacis]]'', the Altar of Peace, showing the [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] and his family worshiping the gods.  He also encouraged the publication of works such as [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid|Æneid]]'', which depicted "pious [[Aeneas|Æneas]]", the [[legend]]ary ancestor of [[Rome]], as a role model for Roman religiosity. Roman historians such as [[Livy]] told tales of early Romans as morally improving stories of military prowess and civic virtue. The Roman civil religion later became centered on the person of the Emperor through the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]], the worship of the ''[[genius (mythology)|genius]]'' of the Emperor.{{sfn|O'Donovan|1996}}

===Rousseau and Durkheim===
The phrase ''civil religion'' was first discussed extensively by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] in his 1762 treatise ''The Social Contract''. Rousseau defined ''civil religion'' as a group of religious beliefs he believed to be universal, and which he believed governments had a right to uphold and maintain: belief in a deity; belief in an afterlife in which [[virtue]] is rewarded and vice punished; and belief in [[freedom of religion|religious tolerance]].  He said the dogmas of civil religion should be simple, few in number, and stated in precise words without interpretations or commentaries.{{sfn|Beiner|1993}} Beyond that, Rousseau affirmed that individuals' religious opinions should be beyond the reach of governments.  For Rousseau civil religion was to be constructed and imposed from the top down as an artificial source of civic virtue.{{sfn|Demerath|Williams|1985}}

Wallace studies [[Émile Durkheim]] (1858–1917), the French sociologist who analysed civil religion, especially in comparative terms, and stressed that the public schools are critical in implementing civil religion. Although he never used the term he laid great stress on the concept.{{sfn|Wallace|1977}}

==Examples==
===France===
Secular states in Europe by the late 19th century were building civil religion based on their recent histories. In France's case, Baylac argues, the French government:
{{quote|encouraged a veritable state religion, worshiping the flag and multiplying the national holidays and commemorative monuments.&amp;nbsp;... July 14 became a national holiday in 1882; the centennial of the French Revolution was celebrated in 1889. In Italy, the secular state multiplied the celebrations: State holidays, King and Queen's birthdays, pilgrimage of 1884 to the tomb of Victor-Emmanuel II. A patriotic ideology was created.&lt;ref name=BaylacFrance&gt;{{cite book |last=Baylac |first=M.-H. |year=1997 |title=Histoire 1ère |language=fr |location=Paris |publisher=Bordas |page=134}} Quoted in {{harvnb|Lindaman|Ward|2013|p=148}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===South Korea===
In contemporary South Korea, the predominating civil religion has been described as consisting of [[Anti-Japanese sentiment in Korea|anti-Japanese sentiment]] coupled with a pan-[[Korean racial nationalism]].&lt;ref name=BRMyers/&gt; This has been criticized by some scholars as being detrimental to South Korean national security as it encourages North Korean provocations against the country in the guise that South Koreans will not adequately defend their country's security as they feel a certain racial and ethnic solidarity with North Korea.&lt;ref name=BRMyers&gt;{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/war_college/what-north-korea-wants|title=What North Korea Wants|date=2017|first=Brian Reynolds|authorlink=Brian Reynolds Myers|last=Myers|publisher=Soundcloud|work=Reuters War College|quote=The South needs to retire the conventional civic religion here, which is anti-Japanese pan-Korean nationalism in favor of a collective identification of civic principles.|access-date=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One scholar argued that South Korea should retire this sort of racialized civil religion for one more rooted in civic principles, like was found in [[West Germany]] during the 20th century.&lt;ref name=BRMyers/&gt;

===Soviet Union===
[[File:Dubna Lenin.JPG|thumb|Statue of Lenin at [[Dubna]], Russia, built in 1937; it is 25 metres tall]]
The Soviet Union made [[Marxism–Leninism]] into a civil religion, with sacred texts and [[List of statues of Vladimir Lenin|many statues of Marx, Lenin, and Stalin.]]{{sfn|Tumarkin|1983}} Stalin personally supervised the cult of Lenin and his own cult, which took advantage of the historic semi-religious adulation Russian peasants had shown toward the tsars.{{sfn|Plamper|2012}} The Lenin icons were put into storage when [[fall of communism|communism fell in 1991]]. The [[List of statues of Stalin|Stalin statues]] had been [[de-Stalinization|removed]] in the 1950s and mention of him was erased from encyclopedias and history books. However under [[Vladimir Putin]] in the 21st century the memory of Stalin has been partly rehabilitated in search of a strong leader who made the nation powerful.  For example, school textbooks were rewritten to portray "the mass terror of the Stalin years as essential to the country's rapid modernization in the face of growing German and Japanese military threats, and amid the inaction or duplicity of the Western democracies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Sherlock |first=Thomas |year=2011 |title=Confronting the Stalinist Past: The Politics of Memory in Russia |url=https://csis-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/legacy_files/files/publication/twq11springsherlock.pdf |magazine=The Washington Quarterly |volume=34 |issue=2 |page=97 |issn=1530-9177 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180225034518/https://csis-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/legacy_files/files/publication/twq11springsherlock.pdf |archive-date=25 February 2018 |access-date=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{main|American civil religion}}
Civil religion is an important component of public life in America, especially at the national level for its celebration of [[nationalism]]. Sociologists report that its "feast days" are [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]], [[Veterans Day]], and [[Memorial Day]]. Its rituals include salutes to the flag and singing "[[God Bless America]]".{{sfn|Bruce|Yearley|2006|p=34}} Soldiers and veterans play a central role of standing ready to sacrifice their lives to preserve the nation. Bellah noted the veneration of veterans.{{sfn|Bellah|1992}} The historian Conrad Cherry called the Memorial Day ceremonies "a modern cult of the dead" and says that it "affirms the civil religious tenets."{{sfn|Wilsey|2015|p=24}}

====American Revolution====
{{Further|Commemoration of the American Revolution}}
The American Revolution was the main source of the civil religion that has shaped patriotism ever since. According to the sociologist Robert Bellah:
{{quote|Behind the civil religion at every point lie biblical archetypes: Exodus, Chosen People, Promised Land, New Jerusalem, and Sacrificial Death and Rebirth. But it is also genuinely American and genuinely new. It has its own prophets and its own martyrs, its own sacred events and sacred places, its own solemn rituals and symbols. It is concerned that America be a society as perfectly in accord with the will of God as men can make it, and a light to all nations.{{sfn|Bellah|1967}}}}

Albanese argues that the American Revolution was the main source of the non-denominational [[American civil religion]] that has shaped patriotism and the memory and meaning of the nation's birth ever since. Battles are not central (as they are for the Civil War) but rather certain events and people have been celebrated as icons of certain virtues (or vices). As historians have noted, the Revolution produced a Moses-like leader ([[George Washington]]), prophets ([[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Tom Paine]]) and martyrs ([[Boston Massacre]], [[Nathan Hale]]), as well as devils ([[Benedict Arnold]]), sacred places ([[Valley Forge]], [[Battle of Bunker Hill|Bunker Hill]]), rituals ([[Boston Tea Party]]), emblems ([[American flag|the new flag]]), sacred holidays ([[July 4]]) and a holy scripture whose every sentence is carefully studied and applied in current law cases (the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], and the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]).{{sfn|Albanese|1977}}

Although "God" is not mentioned in the [[Constitution of the United States of America]], mention is specifically made of "[[Deism#Deism in the United States|Nature's God]]" in the opening sentence of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].{{sfn|O'Donovan|1996}}

====Historiography====
[[File:Christian Flag etc Covenant Presbyterian Long Beach 20050213.jpg|thumb|The [[Christian flag]] displayed alongside the flag of the United States next to the pulpit in a church in California.  Note the eagle and cross finials on the flag poles.]]
In the 1960s and 1970s, scholars such as [[Robert N. Bellah]] and [[Martin E. Marty]] studied civil religion as a cultural phenomenon, attempting to identify the actual tenets of civil religion in the United States, or to study civil religion as a phenomenon of [[cultural anthropology]].  Within this American context, Marty wrote that Americans approved of "religion in general" without being particularly concerned about the content of that faith, and attempted to distinguish "priestly" and "prophetic" roles within the practice of American civil religion, which he preferred to call the ''public theology''.{{sfn|Marty|1989|p=295}} In the 1967 essay "Civil Religion in America", Bellah wrote that civil religion in its priestly sense is "an institutionalized collection of sacred beliefs about the American nation."  Bellah describes the prophetic role of civil religion as challenging "national self-worship" and calling for "the subordination of the nation to ethical principles that transcend it in terms of which it should be judged."{{sfn|Bellah|1967}} Bellah identified the [[American Revolution]], the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], and the [[Civil Rights Movement]] as three decisive historical events that impacted the content and imagery of civil religion in the United States.

The application of the concept of civil religion to the United States was in large part the work of sociologist [[Robert Bellah]]. He identified an elaborate system of practices and beliefs arising from America's unique historic experience and religiosity. Civil religion in the US was originally Protestant but brought in Catholics and Jews after World War II. Having no association with any religious sect, Civil religion was used in the 1960s to justify civil rights legislation. Americans ever since the colonial era talk of their obligation both collective and individual to carry out God's will on earth. [[George Washington]] was a sort of high priest, and the documents of the [[Founding Fathers]] have been treated as almost sacred texts. With the Civil War, says Bellah, came a new theme of death, sacrifice and rebirth, as expressed through [[Memorial Day]] rituals. Unlike France, the American civil religion was never anticlerical or militantly secular.{{sfn|Bellah|1967}}

==Current issues==
This assertive civil religion of the United States is an occasional cause of political friction between the US and Europe, where the literally religious form of civil religion has largely faded away in recent decades. In the United States, civil religion is often invoked under the name of "[[Judeo-Christian ethics]]", a phrase originally intended to be maximally inclusive of the several religions practiced in the United States, assuming that these faiths all share the same values. Alvin J. Schmidt argues that since the 1700s, expressions of civil religion in the United States have shifted from a deistic to a polytheistic stance.{{sfn|Schmidt|2004}}

Some scholars have argued that the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] can be seen as a main [[totem]] of a national cult,&lt;ref&gt;Marvin and Ingle (1996). [http://www.asc.upenn.edu/USR/fcm/jaar.htm "Blood Sacrifice and the Nation: Revisiting Civil Religion"].&lt;/ref&gt; while others have argued that modern punishment is a form of civil religion.{{sfn|SpearIt|2013}} Arguing against mob violence and lynching, Abraham Lincoln declared in his 1838 Lyceum speech that the Constitution and the laws of the United States ought to become the "political religion" of each American.&lt;ref&gt;Address Before the Young Men's Lyceum of Springfield, Illinois January 27, 1838 [http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/speeches/lyceum.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "'''coalition'''" is the denotation for a group formed when two or more persons, faction, states, political parties, militaries etc. agree to work together temporarily in a partnership to achieve a common goal. The word coalition connotes a coming together to achieve a goal.&lt;ref&gt;Coalition International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences. Ed. William A. Darity, Jr. Vol. 1, 2nd ed. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA, 2008. p. 586-587.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/coalition|title=Merriam Webster Dictionary|website=Mirriam-Webster|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427101159/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/coalition|archive-date=2017-04-27|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
According to ''A Guide for Political Parties'' published by [[National Democratic Institute]] and [[The Oslo Center]] for Peace and Human Rights, there are five steps of coalition-building:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Coalitions: A Guide for Political Parties |url=https://www.ndi.org/coalitions-guide |website=www.ndi.org |date=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Developing a party strategy''': The first step in coalition-building involves developing a party strategy that will lay the ground for successful negotiation. The more effort parties place on this step, the more likely they are to identify strategic partners, negotiate a good deal and avoid some of the common pitfalls associated with coalition-building.
# '''Negotiating a coalition''': Based on the strategy that each party has prepared, in Step 2 the parties come together to negotiate and hopefully reach agreement on the terms for the coalition. Depending on the context and objectives of the coalition, these negotiations may be completely secret or partially public. While some issues may be agreed on with relative ease, others may be more contentious and require different approaches to reach compromise.
# '''Getting started''': As negotiation begins to wrap-up, the agreement between political parties needs to be formally sealed. This includes finalizing a written agreement, securing formal approval of the deal from the relevant structures of the coalition’s member parties and announcing the coalition details to the general public.
# '''Working in a coalition''': As the coalition partners begin working to implement their agreement, they will need to maintain good relations by continuing efforts to increase or sustain trust and communication among the member parties. Each party will also need to strike a balance between respecting its obligations to the coalition and maintaining its individual identity.
# '''Drawing lessons learned''': Regardless of whether it plans to move forward alone or in another coalition, it is important for each party to review and document lessons learned from each coalition-building experience. This will make it possible to get a clearer picture of the positive and negative impacts of coalition-building on the party and to identify lessons learned that can inform any future coalition-building efforts.

Coalitions manifest in a variety of forms, types, and terms of duration:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Transnational Activism|last=Tarrow|first=Sidney|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|isbn=9780521851305|location=40 West 20th Street, New York, NY 10011-4211 USA|pages=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Campaign coalitions with high intensity and long-term cooperation
* Federations, characterized by relatively lower degree of involvement, intensity, and participation, involving cooperation of long duration, but with members’ primary commitment remaining with their own entities
* Instrumental coalitions, involving low-intensity involvement without a foundation to mediate conflict
* Event-based coalitions that have a high level of involvement and the potential for future collaboration.

By contrast to [[alliance]]s, coalitions are what might be termed ‘partnerships of unequals’ since comparative political, economic, and military might, or more particularly the extent to which a nation is prepared to commit, dictates who will lead, who is in the inner circle, and who will have influence.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of War|last=Graham|first=Andrew|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|isbn=9780199562930|editor-last=Lindley-French|editor-first=Julian|location=Great Clarendon Street, Oxford|editor-last2=Boyer|editor-first2=Yves}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coalitions generally occur as an unplanned reply to situations of danger, uncertainty, or supernatural events they are also nonpermanent integrations directed at interim objectives. In terms of participation coalitions are, by their nature, more of a "come as you are, wear what you want, leave when you want party".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Function ==
Coalitions branch into two expanding categories: internal coalitions and external coalitions.

Internal coalitions consist of people who are already in an organization, such as a workplace.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://0-go.galegroup.com.ignacio.usfca.edu/ps/i.do?p=GVRL&amp;sw=w&amp;u=usfca_gleeson&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;id=GALE%7CCX3719500085&amp;asid=80841f8b4f50ad451e64d11ad5074e69|title=Encyclopedia of Public Relations|last=Gallicano, McComas|first=Tiffany, Katherine|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|year=2013|isbn=|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages= 126–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[trade union]] is a type of coalition which was formed in order to represent employees' wages, benefits, and working conditions. Without this unity between employees, workers were subjugated to harsh working environments and low pay due to no practical regulations. Often, organizations prefer to council with members of their respective internal coalitions before implementing changes at the workplace to ensure support.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In contrast, external coalitions consist of people that are members of different organizations who collaborate their efforts to achieve an overall objective.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, in order to prevent gun violence and advocate gun control, several groups, unions, and nonprofit organizations banded to form the [[Coalition to Stop Gun Violence]]. External coalitions base their confidence in gaining credibility on inviting unlikely partners who wish to attain the same end goal, but the reasons to achieve these goals differ.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==History==

===Government and politics===
{{see also|Coalition government}}
Coalition government stands as an alternative model to majoritarian governance, the latter being characterized by winner-take-all "first-past-the-post" electoral systems that favor clear distinctions between winners and losers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences|last=Darity|first=William|publisher=Macmillan Reference|year=2008|isbn=0028659651|location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only can coalitions of legislative groups form governments in parliamentary systems but they can form in divisions of power as well. The most usual analyses of coalitions in politics deal with the formation of multiparty cabinets in parliamentary regimes.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=International Encyclopedia of Political Science|last=Colomer|first=Josep|publisher=Sage Publications|year=2011|isbn=9781412959636|editor-last=Badie|editor-first=Bertrand|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=287|editor-last2=Berg-Schlosser|editor-first2=Dirk|editor-last3=Morlino|editor-first3=Leonardo}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, every administration has been a multiparty coalition since the conclusion of the Second World War, an example of a coalition government creation in a parliamentary government. When different winning coalitions can be formed in a parliament, the party composition of the government may depend on the bargaining power of each party and the presence, or not, of a dominant party.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The Cambridge Dictionary defines coalition as "the joining together of different political parties or groups for a particular purpose, usually for a limited time, or a government that is formed in this way".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/coalition|title=coalition Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|author=|date=|website=dictionary.cambridge.org|accessdate=5 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171026072626/http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/coalition|archivedate=26 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International relations===
The temporary collaboration of two or more separate parties with a set goal and common purpose can be viewed as a coalition in international relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/coalition|title=Coalition POLITICS AND INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS|last=Fogarty|first=Edward|date=February 7, 2013|website=www.britannica.com/topic/coalition|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170428145302/https://www.britannica.com/topic/coalition|archive-date=2017-04-28|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coalition competitions are represented in international political dynamics .&lt;ref name="foo-bar"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=McDermott|first2=Rose|last3=Petersen|first3=Michael Bang|date=Fall 2011|title=States in Mind: Evolution, Coalitional Psychology, and International Politics|journal=International Security|volume=36|pages=48–83|doi=10.1162/ISEC_a_00056|last1=Lopez|first1=Anthony C.|number=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[international relations]], a coalition can be an ''ad hoc'' grouping of nations united for specific purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TuAABAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT122&amp;lpg=PT122&amp;dq=a+coalition+can+be+an+%27'ad+hoc%27'+grouping+of+nations+united+for+specific+purposes.|title=Essential Concepts Of Global Environmental Governance|last2=Orsini|first2=Amandine|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-82246-6|location=New York, NY, 10017|last1=Morin|first1=Jean-Frédéric|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although persons and groups form coalitions for many and varied reasons, the most common purpose is to combat a common threat or to take advantage of a certain opportunity, resulting in the often temporary nature of coalitions. The common threat or existence of opportunity is what gives rise to the coalition and allows it to exist as all parties involved see the benefit in working together. Such collaborative processes allow the actors of the coalition to advance forward towards their overall goal or accomplish the task that the coalition was formed around.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Whittier|first2=Nancy|date=May 1994|title=Social Movement Spillover|url=https://campus.fsu.edu/bbcswebdav/institution/academic/social_sciences/sociology/Reading%20Lists/Stratification%20(Politics%20and%20Social%20Movements)%20Copies%20of%20Articles%20from%202009/Meyer-SocialProblems-1994.pdf|journal=Society for the Study of Social Problems|last1=Meyer|first1=David|accessdate=26 April 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426152135/https://campus.fsu.edu/bbcswebdav/institution/academic/social_sciences/sociology/Reading%20Lists/Stratification%20(Politics%20and%20Social%20Movements)%20Copies%20of%20Articles%20from%202009/Meyer-SocialProblems-1994.pdf|archivedate=26 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The behavior and dynamics of a coalitions in international relations are created by commonalties and differences within the groups joining together. [[Rationality]], [[group dynamics]], and [[gender]] are all contributing factors of coalitional behaviors in an [[international security]] framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Enayati Hatkehlui|first2=B.|last3=Kazemi|first3=A.|date=2014|title=The Relationship between Organizational Culture Factors and Employees’ Group Dynamics: Case Study of General Office of Education in Mazandaran Province|url=http://mgmt.iaufb.ac.ir/?_action=articleInfo&amp;article=10719|publisher=Journal of Industrial Strategic Management|volume=11|issue=35|pages=35–48|last1=Kazemi|first1=S.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427100431/http://mgmt.iaufb.ac.ir/?_action=articleInfo&amp;article=10719|archivedate=2017-04-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economics===
Economic agents can form coalitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EU3WSYH2kdUC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=Economic+agents+can+form+coalitions.#v=onepage&amp;q=Economic%20agents%20can%20form%20coalitions.&amp;f=false|title=The Endogenous Formation of economic coalitions|date=2003|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing Limited|isbn=1 84376265 X|location=Northhampton Massachusetts|last1=Carlo|first1=Carraro|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a coalition is formed around economic goals, the reasoning is financial. In economics, when two opposing sectors such as a buyer and seller, or two sellers, come together it can be thought of as a coalition, in the denotative sense, as the two groups come together temporarily to achieve a goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/coalition.html|title=What is a coalition? definition and meaning|last=|first=|date=|website=business dictionary|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170429000134/http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/coalition.html|archive-date=2017-04-29|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example would be the 1997 deal between [[Microsoft]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]. The deal consisted of Microsoft rescuing the then struggling Apple with an infusion of $150 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2009/08/dayintech_0806/|title=Aug. 6, 1997: Apple Rescued — by Microsoft|last=ABELL|first=JOHN|date=08.06.09|website=Wired|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307212929/http://www.wired.com/2009/08/dayintech_0806/|archive-date=2016-03-07|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unions can be viewed as a coalitions of workers (usually of the same industrial sector). When the agents considered are countries, the formation of an international treaty (e.g. [[trade agreements]] or international [[environmental agreements]]) can also be seen as a coalition. In economics a coalition's formation and its stability is mostly studied with tools from [[game theory]].

===Civil society===
In [[civil society]], "coalition" connotes a group effort or a population of people coming together who believe strongly in their cause. The term also describes alliances between civil society organizations, such as [[Trade union|labor unions]], community organizations, and religious institutions. In France, for example, workers from different sectors and unions band together to aid each other in communicating a point.

These activists are joined together by their belief in what they hope to achieve or accomplish.

=== Military ===
Military coalitions can be built and united under a singular power by multiple states and governments. They are fluid in terms of membership—not only does a country not have to have been a traditional ally to join a coalition, but nations can join, vary their contributions and caveats, withdraw, and be replaced by new members as the situation changes or national agendas change.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The expansion of assets accessible to member nations to perform military operations is a crucial attribute of coalitions. In many ways, coalition warfare serves to make the crafting of a peace more difficult than the winning of the war itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Military Science|last=Hardy|first=Travis|publisher=SAGE Reference|year=2013|isbn=1-78402-464-3|editor-last=Piehler|editor-first=Kurt|location=Thousand Oaks, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such coalition happened during the [[Versailles Peace Conference]] in 1919 when the Allied powers attempted to reach a peace agreement.

Examples of military coalitions include the [[Coalition of the Gulf War]], when George H. W. Bush ended Saddam Hussein's aggression in the Middle East by enlisting and leading a military coalition in the 1991 Gulf War's [[Operation Desert Storm]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopaedia Judaica|last=Atkin|first=Maurice|last2=Gartner|first2=Lloyd|last3=Geldman |first3=Arden|last4=Kenen|first4=Isaiah|last5=Rader Marcus|first5=Jacob|last6=Temkin|first6=Sefton|publisher=Macmillan Reference|year=2007|isbn=978-0-02-865928-2|editor-last=Berenbaum|editor-first=Michael|location=Detroit, Michigan, USA.|editor-last2=Skolnik|editor-first2=Fred}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as his son George W. Bush's efforts in the "[[Coalition of the Willing]]", a phrase employed during the 2003 campaign for the [[Iraq War|war in Iraq]] led by the United States and its allies. A contemporary example is the [[United Nations]] [[Coalition intervention in Libya|coalition]] that intervened in the [[2011 Libyan civil war|2011 Libyan Civil War]] against [[Muammar Gaddafi]]. For coalitions to be effective in principle, let alone in action, participating nations have tended to require a single overpowering threat—perhaps to freedom or a way of life or a crucial national interest—or the presence of a single despotic figure or regime whose continued existence is considered not only abhorrent to the generality of nations but also destabilizing to the region or world order.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Mathematics ===
In mathematics the term coalition is linked to an equation which uses the coalition model for exponential population growth. This analytical equation was first published by mathematician [[Pierre François Verhulst]] in 1838 to allow for the approximation of the world's population at a given time by applying differential and integral techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/loci/joma/world-population-growth-the-coalition-model|title=World Population Growth - The Coalition Model|last=Smith, Moore|first=David, Lawrence|date=|website=Mathematical Association of America|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170428104535/http://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/loci/joma/world-population-growth-the-coalition-model|archive-date=2017-04-28|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8707">'''Consumer socialization''' is the process by which young people acquire skills, knowledge and attitudes relevant to their functioning as consumers in the marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Ward, "Consumer Socialization" Journal of Consumer Research, Vol. 1, No. 2 (Sep., 1974), pp. 2 Published by: The University of Chicago Press Article Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/2489100&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued, however, that consumer socialization occurs in the adult years as well. This field of study is a subdivision of [[consumer behaviour]] as its main focus is on how childhood and adolescent experiences affect future consumer behavior. It attempts to understand how factors such as peers, mass media, family, gender, race, and culture plays an influence in developing customer behavior.

This field of study has increasingly interested policy makers, marketers, consumer educator and students of socialization.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moschis|first1=George P.|last2=Churchill|first2=Gilbert A.|title=Consumer Socialization: A Theoretical and Empirical Analysis|journal=Journal of Marketing Research|volume=15|issue=4|year=1978|pages=599|issn=0022-2437|doi=10.2307/3150629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1970sgrocerystore.jpg|thumb|''Mothers tend to have the most influence in consumer development and can teach consumer behavior through observation, direct discussions, and parent supervision.'']]

== Influences ==

George Moschis and Gilbert A. Churchill Jr posit that mass media, parents, school and peers are all agents of consumer socialization. According to this theory children and young adults learn the rational aspects of consumption from their parents while the mass media teaches them to give social meaning to products; schools teach the importance of economic wisdom and finally peers exercise varying social pressures.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

Research in this field is primarily based on two models of human learning: the cognitive development model, which stem primarily from the works of [[Jean Piaget]], and the social learning model, which is based primarily on [[Clark L. Hull|neo-Hullian]], [[B. F. Skinner|neo-Skinnerian]] and [[social learning theory]].

This aspect of child socialization started receiving academic attention in early 1970s.&lt;ref name=ward&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/2489100 Consumer Socialization], by Scott Ward, ''[[Journal of Consumer Research]]'', 1974&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John, Deborah Roedder (1999): "Consumer socialization of children: A retrospective look at twenty-five years of research", ''Journal of Consumer Research'', Vol. 26, No. 3, pp. 183–213&lt;/ref&gt; Systematic academic research in this area was triggered by charges of various [[consumer advocacy]] groups which were concerned with the effects of [[marketing]], especially [[TV advertising]] on children.&lt;ref name=ward/&gt;

=== Peers ===
Adolescents tend to rely more on peers, such as friends and classmates, to develop their consumer behavior compared to television and family.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

=== Television and advertisements ===
Mass media has been shown to be as important of a socialization agent as family and peers. Children learn from observation so by viewing advertisements and lifestyles from a television show they will develop their consumer behavior as well as leaning consumer role perceptions.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

=== Family ===

Family is a major influence in consumer socialization. Parent-child socialization is an adult initiated process by which developing children, through insight, training, and imitation acquire the habits and values congruent with adaptation to their culture.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Baumrind (1980), "New Directions in Socialization Research," American Psychologist, 35 (7), 640 https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0003-066X.35.7.639&lt;/ref&gt;
Mothers tend to have the most influence in consumer development and can teach consumer behavior through observation, direct discussions, and parent supervision.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Ward, Daniel Wackman, and Ellen Wartella (1977) ,"The Development of Consumer Information-Processing Skills: Integrating Cognitive Development and Family Interaction Theories", in NA - Advances in Consumer Research Volume 04, eds. William D. Perreault, Jr., Atlanta, GA : Association for Consumer Research, Pages: 166-171. Stable URL: http://acrwebsite.org/volumes/9349/volumes/v04/NA-04&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Parenting styles|Parenting style]] plays an important role in consumer socialization because parent-child interactions determine how parents teach their child consumer behavior. Parents who have negative attitudes toward television advertising tend to have children who request fewer purchases and are more consumer educated.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Alan R. Wiman. "Parental Influence and Children's Responses to Television Advertising." Journal of Advertising 12, no. 1 (1983): 12-18. https://www.jstor.org/stable/4188427.&lt;/ref&gt; Children who spend less time with parents and other familial ties are more likely to be affected by peers and media than children who spend time with their family.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Michael J. Dotson Eva M. Hyatt, "Major influence factors in children's consumer socialization" Journal of Consumer Marketing Vol. 22 Issue 1(2005) pp. 35 - 42 Stable URL: https://dx.doi.org/10.1108/07363760510576536&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence that other familial connections, such as siblings and grandparents, may have on consumer socialization has not been studied as extensively as parents. Siblings has been found to rely on each other to gain information on the marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Kerrane and Margaret Hogg (2011), "Helping or Hindering? The Ambivalent Role of Siblings as Socialization Agents Within Family Consumption," in Advances for Consumer Research, Duluth, MN: Association for Consumer Research, 244&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender ===

Gender has been identified as a critical social structure variable in consumer socialization. Women tend to have a more positive attitude toward advertisements than males.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Alan J. Bush, Rachel Smith, and Craig Martin. "The Influence of Consumer Socialization Variables on Attitude toward Advertising: A Comparison of African-Americans and Caucasians." Journal of Advertising 28, no. 3 (1999): 13-24. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/4189114.&lt;/ref&gt; Young girls and teenagers are more affected by peer and family influence than boys.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Tamara F. Mangleburg, Dhruv Grewal, Terry Bristol "Socialization, Gender, and Adolescent's Self-Reports of Their Generalized Use of Product Labels." The Journal of Consumer Affairs 31, no. 2 (1997): 255-79. https://www.jstor.org/stable/23860479.&lt;/ref&gt; Young girls are also more likely to deem a brand their favorite based on whether their friends have them.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Boys tend to be more influenced by non-personal communication than interpersonal interactions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Race ===

African Americans tend to watch more hours of television a week and watch different types of television programs compared to their Caucasian counterparts. African Americans rely more on television as a form of consumer socialization than family. African Americans also have a more positive attitude toward advertisements than their Caucasian counterparts.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; African Americans tend to buy the same brand rather than competing brands.&lt;ref&gt;Pepper Miller and Herb Kemp (2005), What's Black About It?: Insights to Increase Your Share of a Changing African-American Market, Ithaca, NY: Paramount Market Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

In Asian cultures, parents and peers tend to have a greater influence on consumer socialization than television. This may be due to Asian cultures' tendency to behave in ways that are best for the community rather than for the individual. This close-knit community leads to a reliance on referrals and word-of-mouth.&lt;ref&gt;Youn-Kyung Kim and Jikyeong Kang "The Effects of Ethnicity and Product on Purchase Decision Making" Journal of Advertising Research&amp;nbsp;Mar 2001,&amp;nbsp;41&amp;nbsp;(2)&amp;nbsp;39-48 https://dx.doi.org/10.2501/JAR-41-2-39-48&lt;/ref&gt;

Hispanic cultures, like Asian cultures, are family-oriented and can be considered to be [[collectivist]]. Hispanic children tend to depend on parents and peers to learn more about consumer behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Shim, Soyeon and Kenneth C. Gehrt (1996), "Hispanic and Native American Adolescents: An Exploratory Study of Their Approach to Shopping," Journal of Retailing, 72 (3), 307-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34412">'''Counter-recruitment''' refers to activity opposing [[military recruitment]], in some or all of its forms. Among the methods used are [[research]], [[Consciousness raising|consciousness-raising]], [[Advocacy|political advocacy]] and [[direct action]]. Most such activity is a response to recruitment by state [[Military|armed forces]], but may also target [[Intelligence agency|intelligence agencies]], [[Private military company|private military companies]], and [[Violent non-state actor|non-state armed groups]].

==Rationale==
[[Image:You-can't-be-all-that-you-can-be-if-you're-dead.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Counter-recruitment poster.]]

The rationale for counter-recruitment activity may be based on any of the following reasons:
* The view that war is immoral - see [[pacifism]].
* The view that some or all military organizations are a tool of [[imperialism]] - see [[anti-imperialism]].

== In the United States ==
Counter-recruitment (which has long been a strategy of [[pacifism|pacifist]] and other [[anti-war]] groups) received a boost in the United States with the unpopularity of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|war in Iraq]] and brief recruitment difficulties of branches of the U.S. military, particularly the [[United States Army|Army]]; although the Army has met, or exceeded, its recruitment goals year after year during that period. Beginning in early 2005, the U.S. counter-recruitment movement grew, particularly on [[high school]] and [[college]] campuses, where it is often led by students who see themselves as targeted for military service in a war they do not support.

===Early history===
The counter-recruitment movement was the successor to the anti-draft movement with the end of [[conscription in the United States]] in 1973, just after the end of the [[Vietnam War]].  The military increased its recruiting efforts, with the total number of recruiters, recruiting stations, and dollars spent on recruiting each more than doubling between 1971 and 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Cortright, David | title=Soldiers in Revolt | publisher=Haymarket Books | year=2005 | isbn=1-931859-27-2 |page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anti-war and anti-draft activists responded with a number of initiatives, using tactics similar to those used by counter-recruiters today.  Activists distributed leaflets to students, publicly debated recruiters, and used equal-access provisions to obtain space next to recruiters to dispute their claims.  The [[American Friends Service Committee]] (A.F.S.C.) and the [[Central Committee for Conscientious Objectors]] (C.C.C.O.) began publishing counter-recruitment literature and attempting to coordinate the movement nationally.  These organizations have been continuously involved in counter-recruitment to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Cortright, David | title=Soldiers in Revolt | publisher=Haymarket Books | year=2005 | isbn=1-931859-27-2 |page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===High schools===
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}
Most counter-recruitment work in the U.S. is focused at the policy level of public school systems.  This work is generally done by parents and grandparents of school-aged children, and the most common activity is information and advocacy with school officials (principals, school boards, etc.) and with the general population in their local school area.  CR at the K12 level is categorically different from other movements, since most of the students are underaged minors and parents are their legal custodians and guardians, not the schools.

The most common policy goal is that the frequency of military recruiters' visits to public schools, their locations in schools, and their types of activities be controlled rather than unlimited.  Many of the larger urban school districts have implemented such guidelines since 2001.

Other goals have included "truth in recruiting", that counselors or curriculum elements be implemented to address the deficiency in high school students' understanding of war and the military life, rather than allowing military recruiters to perform that role.

On high school campuses, counter-recruitment activists since 2001 have also focused around a provision of the [[No Child Left Behind Act]], which requires that high schools provide contact and other information to the military for all of their students who do not opt out.

Counter-recruitment campaigns have attempted to change school policy to ban recruiters regardless of the loss of federal funds, to be active about informing students of their ability to opt out, and/or to allow counter-recruiters access to students equal to the access given to military recruiters.  These political campaigns have had some success, particularly in the [[Los Angeles]] area, where one has been led by the [[Coalition Against Militarism in Our Schools]], and the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].  A simpler and easier, though perhaps less effective, strategy by counter-recruiters has been to show up before or after the school day and provide students entering or exiting their school with opt-out forms, produced by the local school district or by a sympathetic national legal organization such as the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] or the [[National Lawyers Guild]].

Organizations which have attempted to organize such campaigns on a national scale include A.F.S.C. and C.C.C.O., the [[Campus Antiwar Network]] (C.A.N.), and the [[War Resisters League]]. [[Code Pink]], with the [[Ruckus Society]], has sponsored training camps on counter-recruitment as well as producing informational literature for use by counter-recruiters.  [[United for Peace and Justice]] has counter-recruitment as one of its seven issue-specific campaigns. Mennonite Central Committee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mcc.org/usprogramservices/peaceeducation |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130716222646/http://www.mcc.org/usprogramservices/peaceeducation |archivedate=2013-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is another resource on the subject. Some of these organizations focus on counter-recruitment in a specific sector, such as high schools or colleges, while the National network Opposing the Militarization of Youth,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nnomy.org]&lt;/ref&gt; founded in 2004, deals with the larger issue of militarism as it affects young people and society.

==In Canada==
In response to the [[Canadian Forces]]' role as a member of the [[International Security Assistance Force]] in Afghanistan, an anti-war movement developed in Canada which has tried to utilize counter-recruitment as a part of its efforts. In particular, [http://www.OperationObjection.org Operation Objection] emerged as the umbrella counter-recruitment campaign in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian Forces Operations in Afghanistan |url=http://www.dnd.ca/site/Newsroom/view_news_e.asp?id=1703 |publisher=dnd.ca |accessdate=29 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813140713/http://www.dnd.ca/site/Newsroom/view_news_e.asp?id=1703 |archivedate=August 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Operation Objection claimed to have active counter-recruitment operations in 8 to 10 Canadian cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themanitoban.com/2006-2007/1004/102.Operation.objection.is.a.lie.org |accessdate=November 21, 2007 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, coordinated attempts at counter-recruitment activism in Canada have been fairly limited as of late, and for the most part, unsuccessful.

In the 2005-06 academic year at [[York University]], the [[York Federation of Students]], a federation representing ten of the university's student unions, clashed with a Canadian Forces recruiter forcibly removing the recruiter and the kiosk from the Student Center. York University maintains that the Canadian Forces have the same right to recruit as any other employer participating in career fairs on campus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcgilldaily.com/view.php?aid=4265] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060506202200/http://www.mcgilldaily.com/view.php?aid=4265|date=May 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 25, 2007, an attempt by the student union at the [[University of Victoria]] to ban Canadian Forces from participating in career fairs on campus failed when the student body voted overwhelmingly in favour of allowing the Canadian military to participate in recruitment and career development activities available to students.  Approximately 500 students, five times the usual attendance, appeared at the Annual General Meeting of the [[University of Victoria Students' Society]] (UVSS), and voted to defeat the motion proposed to stop the Canadian Forces from appearing on campus at career development events, with an estimated 25 votes in favour of the ban. Those voting against the ban argued that the ban was a restriction on freedom of choice and an infringement of students' free speech, that it went beyond the mandate of student government, and that student union executives should not be advocating policy that does not reflect the views of the fee-paying student body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Carson Jerema |url=http://www.macleans.ca/education/universities/article.jsp?content=20071029_182222_6492 |title=Students say let the military recruit |publisher=Macleans.ca |date=2007-10-29 |accessdate=2010-11-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518180736/http://www.macleans.ca/education/universities/article.jsp?content=20071029_182222_6492 |archivedate=2011-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Colonist |first=Times |url=http://www.canada.com/victoriatimescolonist/story.html?id=e86504b8-e669-4d50-98d0-d907a4a1b203&amp;k=8643 |title=UVic students overturn military recruitment ban |publisher=Canada.com |date=2007-10-26 |accessdate=2010-11-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104111143/http://www.canada.com/victoriatimescolonist/story.html?id=e86504b8-e669-4d50-98d0-d907a4a1b203&amp;k=8643 |archivedate=2012-11-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmKub_BXXV8 |title=Canadian Forces Ban Vote at the UVSS AGM |publisher=YouTube |date=2007-10-25 |accessdate=2010-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://martlet.ca/view.php?aid=39875]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117035928/http://martlet.ca/view.php?aid=39875|date=November 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007, the Minister of Education for [[Prince Edward Island]], [[Gerard Greenan]], was requested by the [[Council of Canadians]] to ban military recruitment on PEI campuses. The Minister responded that military service "is a career and... we think its right to let the Armed Forces have a chance to present this option to students."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.theguardian.pe.ca/index.cfm?sid=79680&amp;sc=98 |title=Recruit away in P.E.I. schools |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=2010-11-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120912093014/http://www.theguardian.pe.ca/index.cfm?sid=79680&amp;sc=98 |archivedate=2012-09-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cry of Dolores'''{{refn|group=n|Literal translations such as "shout of pains", often done by software, should be avoided, as they lack the context that Dolores here is a place name.}} ({{lang-es|Grito de Dolores|links=no}}) is a historical event that occurred in Dolores (now [[Dolores Hidalgo]]), Mexico, in the early morning of 16 September 1810. Roman Catholic priest [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] rang the bell of his church and gave the ''[[pronunciamiento]]'' (call to arms) that triggered the [[Mexican War of Independence]].

Every year on the [[Wiktionary:eve|eve]] of Independence Day, the [[President of Mexico]] re-enacts the Grito from the balcony of the [[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace]] in [[Mexico City]], while ringing the same bell Hidalgo used in 1810.

==Historical event==
[[File:Objetos de la época de independencia.png|thumb|right|250px|Image extracted from the book by Vicente Riva Palacio, Julio Zárate (1880) "México a través de los siglos" Tomo III: "La guerra de independencia" (1808 - 1821)]]

In the 1810s, Mexico was under Spanish control and known as New Spain. The independence movement began to take shape when [[José Bernardo Gutiérrez de Lara]] went to the small town of Dolores (now known as Dolores Hidalgo) and asked the local Roman Catholic priest, Miguel Hidalgo, to help initiate an effort to free New Spain from Spanish control. 

Gutiérrez de Lara went to [[Washington, D.C.]] for military support (being the first Mexican to do so). Hidalgo remained in Dolores, waiting for Gutiérrez de Lara to return with military support. However, fearing arrest,&lt;ref name="Kirkwood"&gt;Kirkwood, Burton (2000). History of Mexico. Westport, CT, USA: Greenwood Publishing Group, Incorporated. {{ISBN|978-0-313-30351-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Hidalgo told his brother Mauricio to make the [[sheriff]] free the pro-independence inmates there. Mauricio and armed men set 80 inmates free in the early morning of 16 September 1810.&lt;ref&gt;Sosa, Francisco (1985) (in Spanish). Biografias de Mexicanos Distinguidos-Miguel Hidalgo. 472. Mexico City: Editorial Porrúa SA. pp. 288-292. {{ISBN|968-452-050-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 2:30&amp;nbsp;a.m., Hidalgo ordered the church bells to be rung and gathered his congregation. Flanked by Allende and [[Juan Aldama]], he addressed the people in front of his church, urging them to revolt. His speech became known as the "Cry of Dolores".

The liberated country adopted Mexico as its official name. Mexico's independence from Spain took a decade of [[Mexican War of Independence|war]]. Gutiérrez de Lara commanded and led Mexico to victory. Independence was achieved by the [[Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire]] on 28 September 1821. However, Hidalgo is credited as being the "father of his country."&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Guedea, "Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 640.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exact words and meaning===
There is no scholarly consensus on the exact words Miguel Hidalgo said at the time. The book ''The Course of Mexican History'' says "the exact words of this most famous of all Mexican speeches are not known, or, rather, they are reproduced in almost as many variations as there are historians to reproduce them".&lt;ref name="Meyer"&gt;Meyer. Michael, et al (1979): ''The Course of Mexican History'', page 276, New York, New York USA Oxford University Press {{ISBN|978-0-19-502413-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The same book also argues that:
{{Cquote|...the essential spirit of the message is... 'My children: a new dispensation comes to us today. Will you receive it? Will you free yourselves? Will you recover the lands stolen three hundred years ago from your forefathers by the hated Spaniards? We must act at once... Will you defend your religion and your rights as true patriots? Long live Our Lady of Guadalupe! Death to bad government! Death to the Gachupines!'&lt;ref name="Meyer"/&gt;}}

In contrast, William F. Cloud divides the sentiments above between both Hidalgo and the crowd:
{{Cquote|[Hidalgo] told them that the time for action on their part had now come. When he asked, 'Will you be slaves of Napoleon or will you as patriots defend your religion, your hearths, and your rights?' there was a unanimous cry, 'We will defend to the utmost! Long live religion, long live our most holy mother of Guadalupe! Long live America! Death to bad government, and death to the Gachupines!'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Church and State or Mexican Politics from Cortez to Diaz|author=William F. Cloud|location=Kansas City, Mo|publisher=Peck &amp; Clark, Printers|year=1896}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Many believe that Hidalgo's Grito condemned the notion of monarchy and criticized the current social order in detail. In fact, his opposition was targeted to Spain and its viceroy in Mexico; not against monarchy in general but against "bad government". The Grito also emphasized loyalty to the Catholic religion, a sentiment with which both Creoles and Peninsulares (native Spaniards) could sympathize. However, the strong anti-Spanish cry of “Death to Gachupines” (Gachupines being a slur given to Peninsulares) would have shocked Mexico’s elites.&lt;ref name=Kirkwood/&gt;

==National festivities==
The day of 16 September was first celebrated in 1812 in [[Huichapan]], [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Since the late 20th century, the event has come to symbolize Mexican independence and to initiate Independence Day ceremonies the following day (16 September). Independence Day in Mexico is a [[Fiestas Patrias (Mexico)|patriotic holiday]], marked by parades, concerts, patriotic programs, drum and bugle and marching band competitions, and special programs on the national and local media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Saint-Louis|first1=Miya|title=How to Celebrate Mexico's Independence Day: Grito de Dolores|url=http://www.iexplore.com/experiences/festivals-events/Mexico-independence-day|website=iexplore.com|publisher=Inside-Out Media|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presidential celebration at Mexico City===
{{unreferenced|section|date=September 2017}}
[[File:Grito2010Calderon07.JPG|thumb|250px|right|[[President of Mexico|President]] [[Felipe Calderón]] at the National Palace balcony during the [[Celebration of Mexican political anniversaries in 2010|bicentennial]] ''Grito'' in 2010.]]
Every 15 September at around 11&amp;nbsp;p.m., the President of Mexico stands on the balcony of the [[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace]] in Mexico City and rings the same bell that Hidalgo rang in 1810, which was moved to the National Palace. The President then recites a shout of patriotism (a [[Grito Mexicano]]) based upon the "Grito de Dolores", with the names of the important heroes of the Mexican War of Independence who were there on that historic day. The Grito ends with the threefold shout of ''¡Viva México!''

This is the version often recited by the President of Mexico:

{{div col|colwidth=30em}}
;Spanish
: ¡[[Mexican people|Mexicanos]]!
: ¡Vivan los héroes que nos dieron patria!
: ¡Viva [[Miguel Hidalgo|Hidalgo]]!
: ¡Viva [[José María Morelos|Morelos]]!
: ¡Viva [[Josefa Ortiz de Domínguez]]!
: ¡Viva [[Ignacio Allende|Allende]]!
: ¡Viva [[Juan Aldama|Aldama]] y [[Mariano Matamoros|Matamoros]]!
: ¡Viva la Independencia Nacional!
: ¡Viva México! ¡Viva México! ¡Viva México!

;English
: Mexicans!
: Long live the heroes who gave us our homeland!
: Long live Hidalgo!
: Long live Morelos!
: Long live Josefa Ortiz de Domínguez!
: Long live Allende!
: Long live Aldama and Matamoros!
: Long live the nation's independence!
: Long Live Mexico! Long Live Mexico! Long Live Mexico!
{{div col end}}

Beneath the balcony of the National Palace, there is a large crowd in the [[Plaza de la Constitución]] (also called the [[Zócalo]]), to hear the recitation. The event draws up to half a million spectators from all over Mexico and tourists worldwide. After the President recites each line beginning with "¡Viva(n)!", the crowd responds by repeating, "¡Viva(n)!"

After the recitation, the President rings the bell one last time, and waves the [[Flag of Mexico]] to the applause of the crowd.

This is followed by the playing of the [[Himno Nacional Mexicano|Mexican national anthem]] by a military band from the Mexican Armed Forces. The crowd sings along. The ceremonies conclude with a spectacular fireworks display at the Zocalo grounds.

On the morning of 16 September, or Independence Day, the [[September 16 military parade|national military parade]] in honor of the holiday starts in the Zócalo and its outskirts, passes the Hidalgo Memorial and ends on the [[Paseo de la Reforma]], Mexico City’s main boulevard, passing "[[El Ángel|El Ángel de la Independencia]]" memorial column and other places along the way.

===Recent exceptions===
The Grito is not always re-enacted at the National Palace; some years it is performed in Dolores Hidalgo, Guanajuato, where it originally happened. This is especially common in the final year of a President's term.

President [[Felipe Calderón]] made an exception by re-enacting the Grito in Dolores Hidalgo as part of the [[Celebration of Mexican political anniversaries in 2010|bicentennial celebrations]] on 16 September 2010, even though he had already done so the night before from the [[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace]] balcony to launch the celebrations.&lt;ref name="calderon_life"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.life.com/gallery/48791#index/16|title=Mexico Celebrates Its Bicentennial - Photo Gallery - LIFE|accessdate=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="afp"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gbXywGZb0nEzHv-T5BB9CXSgqpww|title=Calderón revive grito original en magnos festejos por bicentenario de México|language=Spanish|accessdate=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, in 2012, Calderón's final year as President, he did not go to Dolores Hidalgo but gave the Grito from the National Palace balcony instead. President [[Enrique Peña Nieto]] did not give the Grito in Dolores Hidalgo in any of his six years as President, becoming the fourth president to break the tradition.

Many presidents add their "personal touch" to the Grito and this can be controversial. President [[Vicente Fox]] frequently took liberties with it, adding and removing items, addressing Mexicans in both genders, and in 2001 wishing long life to "our agreements".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|date=April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peña Nieto gave "vivas" to victims of recent earthquakes in 2017.

During Peña Nieto's presidency, the Grito became an occasion for political protest against him and his [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (PRI). On 15 September 2016, a month after the president appeared to be humiliated by U.S. Presidential candidate [[Donald Trump]], thousands of citizens marched, yelled, and carried signs. They tried to enter the [[Zócalo]] during the Grito, but were blocked by a wall of soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; News outlets within Mexico failed to acknowledge the protest. The event was well-attended but opponents charge that the PRI brought ''acarreados'' (poor people or hand-picked party members) as a fake show of support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Grito was also disrupted in 2006 by a demonstration called the Plantón. Crowds loyal to losing candidate [[Andrés Manuel López Obrador]] protested alleged irregularities in the [[Mexican general election, 2006|general election]] just concluded, and the Grito could not be delivered at the Zócalo but was spoken at the National Palace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-mexico17jul17,0,1043192.story |title=Mexicans Rally in Support of Recount |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=2018-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822052712/http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-mexico17jul17%2C0%2C1043192.story |archivedate=2006-08-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  López Obrador won the presidency in 2018.

===Celebrations by governors and municipal presidents===
[[File:GritoIxmiquilpan.JPG|thumb|right|Municipal president giving the "[[Grito Mexicano|grito]]" of "¡Viva México!" at the commencement of Independence Day festivities at 11 pm 16 September 2008 in [[Ixmiquilpan]], [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]].]]
Similar celebrations to the Presidential one occur in cities and towns throughout Mexico, and in Mexican [[Diplomatic mission|embassies]] and consulates worldwide on 15 or 16 September. The chief executive, ambassador, or consul rings a bell and recites the traditional words, including the names of independence heroes and local [[wikt:patriot|patriot]]s, and ending with the threefold shout of ''Viva Mexico!'' The bell rings a second time, the [[Flag of Mexico|Mexican flag]] is waved, and everyone sings the National Anthem, followed by fireworks. There are also celebrations in schools throughout [[Mexico]], and in these cases whenever the bell ringing is reenacted the school or university head utters the traditional words.

A '''debt clock''' is a public counter, which displays the [[government debt]] (also known as ''public debt'' or ''national debt'') of a [[Government-owned corporation|public corporation]], usually of a state, and which visualizes the progression through an update every second. Because of the mirror-image correlation between [[Liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]] and [[accounts receivable]] meanwhile there are '''assets clocks''' or '''property clocks''' also, which visualize the private and state assets. Clocks to display the national [[interest|interest charge]] are called '''interest clocks'''.
[[File:MK11475 Schuldenuhr Wiesbaden Adolfsallee 22.jpg|thumb|Debt clock of the [[German Taxpayers Federation]] shows its prognosis about the public debt of Germany]]
[[File:Langenfeld Schuldenuhr.jpg|thumb|Debt clock in Langenfeld, Germany]]

== Purpose ==
The debt clock strikingly shows the dynamics of the state's debt growth. In this connection private debts and the growth of the monetary assets of the creditors are disregarded. The debt clock, besides showing the actual [[government budget balance|new indebtedness]] of the state through [[investment]] credits from [[government bond]]s, as well shows the effect out of interest and [[compound interest]] ("interest on interest") and the swelling of state indebtedness coming from the interest payable.

== Examples ==
Many countries and cities have public debt clocks installed.

* The first debt clock, the United States' [[National Debt Clock]], was installed in 1989 at the intersection of [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]] and [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]] on the initiative of real estate developer [[Seymour Durst]]. It was relocated in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/seven/10052008/news/nationalnews/1_big_tick_is_due_for_debt_clock_132227.htm New York Post] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006230545/http://www.nypost.com/seven/10052008/news/nationalnews/1_big_tick_is_due_for_debt_clock_132227.htm |date=2008-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/0,1518,583197,00.html Spiegel Online]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Germany, [[German Taxpayers Federation]] debt clocks:
** [[Berlin]]: A German debt clock is located at the entrance of the Federation headquarters since 16 June 2004. Besides the progression of German national debt, the increase per second is displayed too.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.steuerzahler.de/webcom/show_article.php/_c-49/_nr-494/i.html German Taxpayers Federation (stand: 19 April 2011)]&lt;/ref&gt; The Taxpayers Federation estimates these values by adding an estimated probable borrowing of the current year to the state indebtedness of the previous year.&lt;ref name="sp2010"&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/0,1518,724006,00.html Spiegel: "They lost their credibility" (German)], 28 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Wiesbaden]]: Also at the former headquarters of the ''German Taxpayers Federation'' in Wiesbaden, a debt clock has been running since 12 June 1995, which displays the total public debt, the per capita debt and the debt increase per second.
* Germany, [[Landtag of Lower Saxony]]: This debt clock is located in the group hall of the ''[[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]]'' (German party) in the [[Landtag of Lower Saxony]].
* Germany, [[Munich]]: a debt clock has been running since 29 February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.steuerzahler-bayern.de/webcom/show_article.php/_c-1136/_nr-147/i.html Taxpayers Federation Bavaria]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Germany, [[Bonn]], ''[[Haus der Geschichte]]'': this one displays the ''total debt'', ''debt per second'' and ''per capita debt''.
* Germany, [[Düsseldorf]], City Hall: Düsseldorf is a city which has been debt-ress since 12 September 2007 after the sale of a ''[[RWE]]'' [[block of shares]]. There, the elapsed time is displayed instead of the debt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manager-magazin.de/unternehmen/artikel/0,2828,505183,00.html Manager-Magazin: Düsseldorf is debt-free (German)], 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
* Germany, [[Langenfeld, Rhineland]]: after Langenfeld had become debt-free in 2008, the debt clock got dismantled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wdr.de/themen/wirtschaft/oeffentliche_finanzen/kommunen/schuldenabbau_2007/081003.jhtml WDR]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critics ==
The missing confrontation of the growing assets and the increasing debts is criticised i.a. on the part of the unions. In this context an ''assets clock'' or ''property clock'' displaying the rising assets is encouraged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wdr.de/themen/wirtschaft/oeffentliche_finanzen/kommunen/schuldenabbau_2007/081003.jhtml WDR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Senior economist of the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD), [[Heiner Flassbeck]], in February 2007 criticised the bias and striking impact of the debt clock. He suggested to put a clock aside with a display of the private assets/property and its growth to enable the judgement of the debts against the background of present property values and assets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flassbeck.de/pdf/2007/28.2.07/Schuldenverrechner.pdf German article from the [[Frankfurter Rundschau]], 28 February 2007] (PDF; 45&amp;nbsp;kB)&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile property- or richness clocks in several variants were published.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiohamburg.de/Hamburg/Nachrichten/2011/Januar/Vermoegensuhr-Privatvermoegen-in-Hamburg Richness clock [[Hamburg]] at radiohamburg.de retrieved 2 May 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bolivia]] is a [[unitary state]] consisting of nine '''[[Department (country subdivision)|departments]]''' ({{lang-es|departamentos}}). Departments are the primary subdivisions of Bolivia, and possess certain rights under the [[Constitution of Bolivia]]. Each department is represented in the federal [[Plurinational Legislative Assembly]]—a [[bicameral]] legislature consisting of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies. Each department is represented by four Senators, while Deputies are awarded to each state in proportion to their total population.

Out of the nine departments, [[La Paz Department (Bolivia)|La Paz]] is the most populous, with 2,706,351 inhabitants as of 2012; [[Pando Department|Pando]] is the least populous, with a population of 110,436. The largest department by area is [[Santa Cruz Department (Bolivia)|Santa Cruz]], encompassing {{Convert|370621|km2|mi2}}, while the smallest is [[Tarija Department|Tarija]], encompassing {{Convert|37623|km2|mi2}}.

'''Earl Elmer Bakken ''' (January 10, 1924 &amp;ndash; October 21, 2018) was an American engineer, businessman and philanthropist of Dutch and [[Norwegian American]] ancestry. He founded [[Medtronic]], where he developed the first external, battery-operated, transistorized, wearable [[artificial pacemaker]] in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] Institute of Chemistry: [http://chem.ch.huji.ac.il/history/bakken.html Earl E. Bakken] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205094724/http://chem.ch.huji.ac.il/history/bakken.html |date=2007-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born in [[Columbia Heights, Minnesota]], Bakken had a long-held fascination with electricity and electronics. A self-described "[[nerd]]", Bakken designed a rudimentary [[electroshock weapon]] in school to fend off bullies. After earning a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering in 1948, he studied electrical engineering with a minor in mathematics at the University of Minnesota Graduate School. Post-World War II hospitals were just starting to employ electronic equipment, but did not have staff to maintain and repair them. 

==Career==
Sensing an opportunity, with his brother-in-law, [[Palmer Hermundslie]], he formed Medtronic (a portmanteau of "medical" and "electronic") in a small garage, primarily working with the University of Minnesota hospital.

In the 1950s, Dr. [[C. Walton Lillehei]] was performing life-saving surgery on children with [[blue baby syndrome]]. That surgery often left the children needing to be temporarily attached to a pacemaker.  The pacemakers at the time were large devices that required their own carts and relied on wall current for power. As a result of a power blackout on October 31, 1957, one of Dr. Lillehei's young patients died. Dr. Lillehei, who had worked with Bakken before, asked him the next day if he could solve the problem. Four weeks after finding a circuit diagram for a [[metronome]] in ''[[Popular Electronics]]'', Bakken delivered a battery-powered transistorized pacemaker about the size of a few decks of cards to Dr. Lillehei. After successfully testing the hand-made device in the laboratory, Bakken returned to create a refined model for patients. However, much to his astonishment, when he came in the next day, he found the pacemaker already in use on a patient. (The [[Food and Drug Administration]] did not start regulating [[medical devices]] until 1976.)&lt;ref name="Iaizzo2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul A. Iaizzo|title=Handbook of Cardiac Anatomy, Physiology, and Devices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4PLuCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA449|date=13 November 2015|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-19464-6|pages=449–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next several years, Bakken and Medtronic worked with other doctors to develop fully implantable pacemakers, but they also veered toward bankruptcy. He borrowed money that kept Medtronic going, but the bankruptcy near-miss drove Bakken to develop the ''Medtronic Mission'', which still guides the company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medtronic.com/us-en/about/mission.html Medtronic's Patient-Focussed Mission] ''medtronic.com''&lt;/ref&gt; The mission helped the young company to stay focused on areas where it could truly help patients.

Bakken retired from [[Medtronic]] in 1989 and moved to a 9-acre estate in the [[Kona District, Hawaii|Kona District]] of [[Hawaii]] he called ''Bakken Hale'',&lt;ref name=BakkenHale&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mykleseth|first1=Kathryn|title=Supersize solar setup underway on Big Isle|url=http://www.staradvertiser.com/business/supersize-solar-setup-underway-on-big-isle/|website=Honolulu Star Advertiser|publisher=Oahu Publications d.b.a. Staradvertiser.com|access-date=21 June 2016|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; but still returned to the company several times a year to meet new employees and explain the ''Medtronic Mission'' to them in person.

In 1996 he helped to dedicate the North Hawaii Community Hospital and was active there for some time afterwards, working to combine Eastern and Western approaches to medicine to develop a more [[Holistic health|holistic]] approach to health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abilitymagazine.com/Earl_Bakken.html|title=''Ability Magazine: Earl Bakken Interview with Chet Cooper"'' (2009)|accessdate=2012-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Medtronic started the construction of its new European [[distribution center]] in [[Heerlen]], The Netherlands. The street on which the facility was built is named after Bakken.

Bakken died at his Hawaii home on October 21, 2018 at the age of 94.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.startribune.com/medtronic-founder-earl-bakken-has-died-at-his-home-in-hawaii/498167261/ Medtronic founder Earl Bakken Has Died at His Home In Hawaii]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''false reality bubble''' is an alternate [[social reality]] created for political reasons. To be a "bubble" the knowledge involved must have been incorporated into the world view of a substantial mass of people.

According to [[David Fenton]], Chairman and founder of [[Fenton Communications]] the [[Fox News Channel]] is an example of a media enterprise which has successfully created a false reality bubble.&lt;ref name="NYT73116"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Jim Rutenberg|title=What’s Next at Fox News, With Ailes Out and Murdoch In?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/01/business/media/whats-next-at-fox-news-with-ailes-out-and-murdoch-in.html|accessdate=August 1, 2016|work=The New York Times|date=July 31, 2016|quote=[[David Fenton]] said ... the Murdoch outlets have [created] a “false reality bubble denying science”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inspiration and aims==
Launched in June 2015, the project - named for the [[Apollo program|Apollo Program]], which brought together thousands of scientists and engineers to put mankind on the [[moon]] - calls for [[developed nations]] to commit to spending 0.02% of their [[Gross domestic product|GDP]], for 10 years, to fund co-ordinated research to solve the challenge. This equates to $150 billion over a decade, roughly the same cost committed to the Apollo Program in 2015 money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Budgetary Analysis of NASA’s New Vision for Space Exploration|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/hqlibrary/documents/o56716382.pdf|website=[[Congressional Budget Office]]|publisher=[[Congress of the United States]]|accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clark|first1=Pilita|title=$150bn needed to save world from climate change, warn scientists|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ecef7a04-0621-11e5-b676-00144feabdc0.html|accessdate=2 June 2015|work=[[Financial Times]]|publisher=[[Pearson PLC]]|date=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some developed nations, including the [[UK]], already meet the GDP percentage target spend, but many do not and there is little international coordination to maximise the results.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;

== Background ==
The eventual site for the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam was identified by the [[United States Bureau of Reclamation]] during a Blue Nile survey conducted between 1956 and 1964. The Ethiopian Government surveyed the site in October 2009 and August 2010. In November 2010, a design for the dam was submitted.&lt;ref name=watertech&gt;{{cite web|title=Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam Project, Benishangul-Gumuz, Ethiopia|url=http://www.water-technology.net/projects/grand-ethiopian-renaissance-dam-africa/|publisher=Water Technology|accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 March 2011, a day after the project was made public, a US$4.8 billion contract was awarded without competitive bidding to [[Salini Impregilo|Salini Costruttori]] and the dam's foundation stone was laid on 2 April 2011 by then Prime Minister [[Meles Zenawi]].&lt;ref name=news&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethiopia Launched Grand Millennium Dam Project, the Biggest in Africa|url=http://www.ethiopian-news.com/ethiopia-launched-grand-millennium-dam-project-the-biggest-in-africa/|publisher=Ethiopian News|accessdate=17 April 2011|date=2 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rock crushing plant has been constructed along with a small air strip for fast transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Belete|first=Pawlos|title=Great Millennium Dam moves Ethiopia |url= http://www.capitalethiopia.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=14459:great-millennium-dam-moves-ethiopia&amp;catid=12:local-news&amp;Itemid=4 |accessdate=19 April 2011|newspaper=Capital Ethiopia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first two generators are expected to become operational after 44 months of construction.&lt;ref name="Business"&gt;{{cite news|title=Meles Launches Millennium Dam Construction on Nile River |url=http://www.newbusinessethiopia.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=466:meles-launches-millennium-dam-construction-on-nile-river&amp;catid=35:trade&amp;Itemid=12 |accessdate=19 April 2011|newspaper=New Business Ethiopia|date=2 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt, which lies downstream, opposes the dam which it believes will reduce the amount of water that it gets from the Nile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt Stays Opposed to Ethiopia’s Grand Millennium Dam Project |url= http://www.ezega.com/News/NewsDetails.aspx?Page=heads&amp;NewsID=2847 |accessdate=19 April 2011 |newspaper=EZega |date=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zenawi argued, based on an unnamed study, that the dam would not reduce water availability downstream and would also regulate water for irrigation.&lt;ref name="Business" /&gt; In May 2011, it was announced that Ethiopia would share blueprints for the dam with Egypt so the downstream impact could be examined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt approves of Ethiopia’s Renaissance Dam in principle |url= http://www.ethiopian-news.com/egypt-approves-ethiopia%E2%80%99s-renaissance-dam-principle/ |accessdate=29 May 2011 |newspaper=Ethiopia News |date=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The potential impacts of the dam have been the source of severe regional controversy.

== Cost and financing ==
The Ethiopian government has stated that it intends to fund the entire cost of the dam by itself. It has issued a bond targeted at Ethiopians in the country and abroad to that end.&lt;ref name="Business" /&gt; The turbines and associated electrical equipment of the hydropower plants costing about US$1.8 billion are reportedly financed by Chinese banks. This would leave US$3 billion to be financed by the Ethiopian government through other means.&lt;ref&gt;''The Economist'': [http://www.economist.com/node/18587195/ "The River Nile: A dam nuisance. Egypt and Ethiopia quarrel over water"], April 20, 2011, Retrieved on April 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The estimated US$4.8 billion construction cost, apparently excluding the cost of power transmission lines, corresponds to about 5% of Ethiopia’s Gross Domestic Product of US$87 billion in 2017.

== Design ==
[[File:Renaissance Dam site.jpg|thumb|left|190px|Renaissance Dam and associated facilities.]]
The design changed several times between 2011–2017. This affected both the electrical parameters and the storage parameters.

Originally, in 2011, the hydropower plant was to receive 15 generating units with 350&amp;nbsp;MW [[nameplate capacity]] each, resulting in a total installed capacity of 5,250&amp;nbsp;MW with an expected power generation of 15,128&amp;nbsp;GWh per annum.&lt;ref name="1st" /&gt; However, due to the upgrading made on the power plant, its generation capacity was uplifted to 6,000 MW from 5,250 MW, with a power generation of 15,692&amp;nbsp;GWh per annum through 16 generating units with 375&amp;nbsp;MW nameplate capacity each. In 2017, the design has again been changed to add another 450 MW, with a power generation of 16,153&amp;nbsp;GWh per annum.&lt;ref name="heraldic" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201702280364.html|title=Ethiopia: GERD Increases Generation Capacity|last=|first=|date=19 March 2012|accessdate=28 February 2017|newspaper=allAfrica}}&lt;/ref&gt; That was achieved by upgrading 14 of the 16 generating units from 375&amp;nbsp;MW to 400&amp;nbsp;MW without changing the nameplate capacity.&lt;ref name="Gebremichael"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thereporterethiopia.com/content/nuts-and-bolts-ethiopian-power-sector|title=Nuts and bolts of Ethiopian power sector|last=|first=|date=4 March 2017|accessdate=7 September 2017|newspaper=Reporter Ethiopia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only the electrical power parameters were to change over time, but also the storage parameters. Originally, in 2011, the dam was considered to be {{Convert|145|m|abbr=on}} tall with a volume of 10.1 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The reservoir was considered to have a volume of {{Convert|66|km3|acre.ft|abbr=on}} and a surface area of {{Convert|1680|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} at full supply level. The rock-filled [[saddle dam]] besides the main dam was considered to have a height of {{Convert|45|m|abbr=on}} meters and a length of {{Convert|4800|m|abbr=on}} and a volume of 15 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=watertech /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hornaffairs.com/2011/09/20/facts-grand-ethiopian-renaissance-dam/|title=[Updated] Facts – Grand Ethiopian Renaissance dam|last=|first=|date=20 September 2011|accessdate=28 August 2017|publisher=Hornaffairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, an Independent Panel of Experts (IPoE) assessed the dam and its technological parameters. At that time, the reservoir sizes were changed already. The size of the reservoir at ''full supply level'' went up to {{Convert|1874|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} (plus 194&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The storage volume at ''full supply level'' had increased to {{Convert|74|km3|acre.ft|abbr=on}} (plus 7&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="IPOE2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.internationalrivers.org/sites/default/files/attached-files/international_panel_of_experts_for_ethiopian_renaissance_dam-_final_report_1.pdf|title=International Panel of Experts on Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam Project (GERDP) – Final Report|last=|first=|date=31 May 2013|accessdate=28 August 2017|publisher=internationalrivers.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; These numbers did not change anymore after 2013.

After the IPoE made its recommendations, in 2013, the dam parameters were changed to account for higher flow volumes in case of extreme floods: a main dam height of {{Convert|155|m|abbr=on}} (plus 10 meters) with a length of {{Convert|1780|m|abbr=on}} (no change) and a dam volume of 10.2 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (plus 0.1 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). The outlet parameters did not change, only the crest of the main dam was raised. The rock saddle dam went up to a height of {{Convert|50|m|abbr=on}} (plus 5 meters) with a length of {{Convert|5200|m|abbr=on}} (plus 400 meters). The volume of the rock saddle dam increased to 16.5 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (plus 1.5 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="IPOE2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="salinides" /&gt;

The ''design parameters'' as of August 2017 are as follows, given the changes as outlined above:

=== Two dams ===
The zero level of the main dam, the ground level, will be at a height of almost exactly {{Convert|500|m|abbr=on}} [[above sea level]], corresponding roughly to the level of the river bed of the Blue Nile. Counting from the ground level, the main gravity dam will be {{Convert|155|m|abbr=on}} tall, {{Convert|1780|m|0|abbr=on}} long and composed of [[roller-compacted concrete]]. The crest of the dam will be at a height of {{Convert|655|m|abbr=on}} above sea level. The outlets of the two powerhouses are below the ground level, the total height of the dam will therefore be slightly higher than that of the given height of the dam. In some publications, the main contractor constructing the dam puts forward a number of {{Convert|170|m|abbr=on}} for the dam height, which might account for the additional depth of the dam below ground level, which would mean {{Convert|15|m|abbr=on}} of excavations from the [[basement (geology)|basement]] before filling the dam. The structural volume of the dam will be {{Convert|10200000|m3|cuyd|abbr=on}}. The main dam will be {{Convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}} from the border with Sudan.

Supporting the main dam and reservoir will be a curved and {{Convert|5.2|km|0|abbr=on}} long and {{Convert|50|m|0|abbr=on}} high rock-fill [[saddle dam]]. The ground level of the saddle dam is at an elevation of about {{Convert|600|m|abbr=on}} above sea level. The surface of the saddle dam has a bituminous finish, to keep the interior of the dam dry. The saddle dam will be just {{Convert|3.3–3.5|km|0|abbr=on}} away from the border with Sudan, it is much closer to the border than the main dam.

The reservoir behind both dams will have a storage capacity of {{Convert|74|km3|acre.ft|abbr=on}} and a surface area of {{Convert|1874|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} when at full supply level of {{Convert|640|m|abbr=on}} above sea level. The full supply level is therefore {{Convert|140|m|abbr=on}} above the ground level of the main dam. Hydropower generation can happen between reservoir levels of {{Convert|590|m|abbr=on}}, the so-called ''minimum operating level'', and {{Convert|640|m|abbr=on}}, the ''full supply level''. The ''live storage volume'', usable for power generation between both levels is then {{Convert|59.2|km3|acre.ft|abbr=on}}. The first {{Convert|90|m|abbr=on}} of the height of the dam will be a dead height for the reservoir, leading to a ''dead storage volume'' of the reservoir of {{Convert|14.8|km3|acre.ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="IPOE2013" /&gt;

=== Three spillways ===
The dams will have three [[spillway]]s. All three spillways together are designed for a flood of up to {{Convert|38500|m3/s|ft3/s|abbr=on}}, an event not considered to happen at all, as this discharge volume is the so-called 'Probable Maximum Flood'. All waters from the three spillways are designed to discharge into the Blue Nile before the river enters Sudanese territory.

The main and gated spillway is located to the left of the main dam and will be controlled by six [[floodgates]] and have a design discharge of {{Convert|14700|m3/s|ft3/s|abbr=on}} in total. The spillway will be {{Convert|84|m|abbr=on}} wide at the outflow gates. The base level of the spillway will be at {{Convert|624.9|m|abbr=on}}, well below the full supply level.

An ungated spillway, the auxiliary spillway, sits at the center of the main dam with an open width of about {{Convert|205|m|abbr=on}}. This spillway has a base-level at {{Convert|640|m|abbr=on}}, which is exactly the full supply level of the reservoir. The dam crest is {{Convert|15|m|abbr=on}} higher to the left and to the right of the spillway. This ungated spillway is only expected to be used, if the reservoir is both full and the flow exceeds {{Convert|14700|m3/s|ft3/s|abbr=on}}, a flow value, that is expected to be exceeded once every ten years.

A third spillway, an emergency spillway, is located to the right of the curved saddle dam, with a base level at {{Convert|642|m|abbr=on}}. This emergency spillway has an open space of about {{Convert|1200|m|abbr=on}} along its rim. This third spillway will carry water only if the conditions for a flood of more than around {{Convert|30000|m3/s|ft3/s|abbr=on}} are given, corresponding to a flood to occur only once every 10,000 years.

=== Power generation and distribution ===
Flanking either side of the auxiliary ungated spillway at the center of the dam will be two [[power station|power houses]]. The right will contain 10 x 375 MW [[Francis turbine]]-generators, the left power house will house 6 x 375 MW of the same turbine-generators. 14 of the 16 turbine-generators have been upgraded to 400&amp;nbsp;MW without changing the nameplate capacity (which is still at 375&amp;nbsp;MW), while two turbine-generators remained at 375&amp;nbsp;MW.&lt;ref name=salinides&gt;{{cite web|title=Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam Project|url=http://www.salini-impregilo.com/lavori/in-corso/dighe-impianti-idroelettrici/grand-ethiopian-renaissance-dam-project.html|publisher=Salini|accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gebremichael" /&gt; The total installed capacity with all turbine-generators will be 6,450&amp;nbsp;MW. The average annual flow of the Blue Nile being available for power generation is expected to be {{Convert|1547|m3/s|ft3/s|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name="IPOE2013" /&gt; which gives rise to an annual expectation for power generation of 16,153&amp;nbsp;GWh, corresponding to a plant load factor (or [[capacity factor]]) of 28.6%.

The Francis turbines inside the power houses are installed in a vertical manner, raising {{Convert|7|m|abbr=on}} above the ground level. For the foreseen operation between the minimum operating level and the full supply level, the head waters for the turbines will be between {{Convert|83-133|m|abbr=on}} high. A [[Electrical substation#switching station|switching station]] will be located close to the main dam, where the generated power will be delivered to the national grid. Completed have been four 500&amp;nbsp;kV main [[power transmission line]]s in August 2017, all going to [[Holeta Genet|Holeta]] and then with several 400&amp;nbsp;kV lines to the metropolitan area of [[Addis Ababa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EEP readies 1,400km long high power transmission lines, distribution stations|url=http://www.fanabc.com/english/index.php/news/item/9856-eep-readies-1,400km-long-high-power-transmission-lines,-distribution-stations|date=25 August 2017|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two 400&amp;nbsp;kV lines are running from the dam to the [[Beles Hydroelectric Power Plant]]. Also planned are 500&amp;nbsp;kV [[High-voltage direct current]] lines.

=== Early power generation ===

Two non-upgraded turbine-generators with 375&amp;nbsp;MW each are considered to be the first to go into operation with 750&amp;nbsp;MW delivered to the national power grid, possibly 2018. This early power generation will start well before the completion of the dam, when the filling of the reservoir commences. The two units are sitting within the 10 unit powerhouse to the right side of the dam at the auxiliary spillway. They are fed by two special intakes within the dam structure that are located at a height of {{Convert|540|m|abbr=on}} above sea level. It is foreseen, that power generation can start at a water level of {{Convert|560|m|abbr=on}}, {{Convert|30|m|abbr=on}} below the ''minimum operating level'' of the other 14 turbine-generators. At that level, the reservoir has been filled with roughly {{Convert|5.5|km3|abbr=on}} of water, which corresponds to roughly 11% of the annual inflow of {{Convert|48.8|km3|abbr=on}}. During the rainy season, this is expected to happen within days to weeks. The two early power generating units probably will be the only units in operation for several years as the filling of the reservoir will take from 5–15 years.

=== Siltation, evaporation and irrigation ===

Two "bottom" outlets at {{Convert|542|m|abbr=on}}, {{Convert|42|m|abbr=on}} above ground level are available for delivering water to Sudan and Egypt under special circumstances, in particular for irrigation purposes downstream, if the level of the reservoir falls below the minimum operating level of {{Convert|590|m|abbr=on}} but also during the initial filling process of the reservoir.

The space below the "bottom" outlets is the primary buffer space for [[alluvium]] through [[siltation]] and [[sedimentation]]. For the [[Roseires Dam|Roseires Reservoir]] just downstream from the GERD site, the average siltation / sedimentation volume (without GERD in place) amounts to around {{Convert|0.035|km3|acre.ft|abbr=on}} per year. Due to the large size of the GERD reservoir, the siltation / sedimentation volume is expected to be much higher in this case, expected are {{Convert|0.21|km3|acre.ft|abbr=on}} per annum.&lt;ref name="IPOE2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="roseires"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sediment Accumulation in Roseires Reservoir|url=http://publications.iwmi.org/pdf/H042510.pdf|publisher=IWMI.org|date=2008|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GERD reservoir will foreseeable take away the siltation threat from the Roseires reservoir almost entirely.

The ground level of the GERD dam is at around {{Convert|500|m|abbr=on}} above sea level. Water flowing out of the dam will be released into the Blue Nile again which will flow for only around {{Convert|30|km|abbr=on}}, before joining the Roseires reservoir, which – if at full supply level – will be at {{Convert|490|m|abbr=on}} above sea level. There is only a {{Convert|10|m|abbr=on}} elevation difference between both projects. The two reservoirs and accompanied hydropower projects could – if coordinated properly across the border between Ethiopia and Sudan – become a cascaded system for more efficient hydropower generation and better irrigation (in Sudan in particular). Water from the {{Convert|140|m|abbr=on}} column of the water storage of the GERD reservoir could be diverted through tunnels to facilitate new irrigation schemes in Sudan close to the border with [[South Sudan]]. In Ethiopia itself, no irrigation schemes are planned due to the proximity of the dam to the downstream border with Sudan.

Evaporation of water from the reservoir is expected to be at 3% of the annual inflow volume of {{Convert|48.8|km3|abbr=on}}, which corresponds to an average volume lost through evaporation of around {{Convert|1.5|km3|abbr=on}} annually. This was considered neglectable by the IPoE.&lt;ref name="IPOE2013" /&gt; For comparison, [[Lake Nasser]] in Egypt loses between {{Convert|10-16|km3|abbr=on}} annually through evaporation.&lt;ref name="nasser"&gt;{{cite web|title=Evaporation Reduction from Lake Nasser Using New Environmentally Safe Techniques|url=http://www.iwtc.info/2007_pdf/2-5.pdf|publisher=IWTC|date=2007|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction ==
=== Major achievements ===
The main contractor is the [[Italy|Italian]] company [[Salini Impregilo|Salini Costruttori]], which also served as primary contractor for the [[Gilgel Gibe II Power Station|Gilgel Gibe II]], [[Gilgel Gibe III Dam|Gilgel Gibe III]], and [[Beles Hydroelectric Power Plant|Tana Beles]] dams. [[Simegnew Bekele]] was the project manager of GERD from the start of construction in 2011 up to his death on July 26, 2018. The dam is expected to consume 10 million [[metric ton]]s of concrete. The government has pledged to use only domestically produced concrete. In March 2012, Salini awarded the Italian firm [[Tratos Cavi SPA]] a contract to supply low- and high-voltage cable for the dam.&lt;ref name=salinides/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tratos wins contract for 6,800 MW Ethiopian project|url=http://www.hydroworld.com/articles/2012/02/tratos-wins-contract.html|publisher=HydroWorld.com|accessdate=12 April 2013|date=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alstom]] will provide the eight 375 MW [[Francis turbine]]s for the project's first phase, at a cost of €250 million.&lt;ref&gt;Alstom:[http://www.alstom.com/press-centre/2013/1/alstom-to-supply-hydroelectric-equipment-for-the-grand-renaissance-dam-in-ethiopia/ Alstom to supply hydroelectric equipment for the Grand Renaissance dam in Ethiopia], 7 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt; As of April 2013, nearly 32 percent of the project was complete.

The first power production of 750 MW was slated for sometime later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethiopia: Nile dam set to generate power, Ethiopia to consult Egypt, Sudan ahead|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article57757|publisher=Sudan Tribune|accessdate=20 February 2016|date=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Engineering questions ===
[[Image:GERD-Men-at-Work.jpg|thumb|left|Dam construction in 2014.]]
In 2012, an international panel, the ''International Panel of Experts'' was formed with experts from Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia, and other independent entities to discuss mainly engineering and partially impact related questions. This panel concluded at a number of engineering modifications, that were proposed to Ethiopia and the main contractor constructing the dam. One of the two main engineering questions, dealing with the size of flood events and the constructive response against them, was later addressed by the contractor. The emergency spillway located near the rock saddle dam saw an increase of the rim length from 300&amp;nbsp;m to 1,200&amp;nbsp;m to account even for the largest possible flood of the river. The second main recommendation of the panel however found no immediate resonance. This second recommendation dealt with the structural integrity of the dam in context with the underlying [[basement (geology)|rock basement]] as to avoid the danger of a sliding dam due to an unstable basement. It was argued by the panel, that the original structural investigations were done with considering only a ''generic'' rock mass without taking special conditions like faults and sliding planes in the rock basement ([[Gneiss]]) into account. The panel noted, that there was indeed an exposed sliding plane in the rock basement, this plane potentially allowing a sliding process downstream. The panel didn't argue that a catastrophic dam failure with a release of dozens of cubic kilometers of water would be possible, probable or even likely, but the panel argued, that the given safety factor to avoid such a catastrophic failure might be non-optimal in the case of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam.&lt;ref name="IPOE2013" /&gt; It was later revealed that the underlying basement of the dam was completely different from all expectations and did not fit the geological studies as the needed excavation works exposed the underlying [[Gneiss]]. The engineering works then had to be adjusted, with digging and excavating deeper than originally planned, which took extra time and capacity and also required more concrete.&lt;ref name="Azeb" /&gt;

=== Alleged over-sizing ===
Originally, in 2011, the hydropower plant was to receive 15 generating units with 350&amp;nbsp;MW [[nameplate capacity]] each, resulting in a total installed capacity of 5,250&amp;nbsp;MW with an expected power generation of 15,128&amp;nbsp;GWh per annum.&lt;ref name="1st" /&gt; The [[capacity factor]] of the planned hydropower plant – the expected electricity production divided by the potential production if the power plant was utilized permanently at full capacity – was only 32.9% compared to 45–60% for other, smaller hydropower plants in Ethiopia. Critics concluded that a smaller dam would have been more cost-effective.&lt;ref name="1st"&gt;{{cite web|last=Beyene |first=Mehari |title=How efficient is The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam? |url=https://www.internationalrivers.org/sites/default/files/attached-files/ethiopiadamefficiency.pdf |publisher=International Rivers |accessdate=12 August 2017 |date=14 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after, in 2012, the hydropower plant was upgraded to receive 16 generating units with 375&amp;nbsp;MW nameplate capacity each, increasing the total installed capacity to 6,000&amp;nbsp;MW, with the expected power generation going up only slightly to 15,692&amp;nbsp;GWh per annum. Consequently, the capacity factor shrank to 29.9%. According to Asfaw Beyene, a Professor of Mechanical Engineering at San Diego State University (California), the dam and its hydropower plant are massively oversized: "GERD’s available power output, based on the average of river flow throughout the year and the dam height, is about 2,000 megawatts, not 6,000. There is little doubt that the system has been designed for a peak flow rate that only happens during the 2–3 months of the rainy season. Targeting near peak or peak flow rate makes no economic sense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why is the hydroelectric dam on the Blue Nile, the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), sized for 6000 MW?|url=http://gadaa.com/oduu/20303/2013/06/19/why-is-the-hydroelectric-dam-on-the-blue-nile-the-grand-ethiopian-renaissance-dam-gerd-sized-for-6000-mw/|publisher=Finfinne Tribune|accessdate=13 October 2014|date=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethiopia's Biggest Dam Oversized, Experts Say|url=http://www.internationalrivers.org/resources/ethiopia%E2%80%99s-biggest-dam-oversized-experts-say-8082|publisher=International Rivers: An Interview with Asfaw Beyene|accessdate=13 October 2014|date=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the total installed capacity was moved to 6,450&amp;nbsp;MW, without changing the number and nameplate capacity of the generating units (which then remained at 6,000&amp;nbsp;MW in total). This was thought to arrive from enhancements made to the generators.&lt;ref name="upto6450" /&gt; The expected power generation per annum went up to 16,153&amp;nbsp;GWh,&lt;ref name="heraldic"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Ethiopian Herald (ENA)|url=http://www.ethpress.gov.et/herald/index.php/technology/item/8498-purpose-driven-commitment-from-every-corner-to-realize-ethiopian-renaissance|language=en|title=Purpose driven commitment from every corner to realize Ethiopian Renaissance|date=2017-05-05|accessdate=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; the capacity factor shrank again and reached 28.6%. This time nobody publicly voiced concern. Such an optimization of the [[Francis turbine]]s used at the dam site is indeed possible and is usually done by the provider of the turbines taking into account site-specific conditions.

Considering the critics voiced about the alleged over-sizing of the possible power output, now of 6,450&amp;nbsp;MW. Ethiopia is relying heavily on hydropower, but the country is often affected by [[drought]]s (see e.g. [[2011 East Africa drought]]). The water reservoirs used for power generation in Ethiopia have a limited size. For example, the [[Gilgel Gibe I Dam|Gilgel Gibe I reservoir]], that feeds both the Gilgel Gibe I powerplant and the [[Gilgel Gibe II Power Station]], has a capacity of 0.7&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. In times of drought, there is no water left to generate electrical power. This heavily affected Ethiopia in the drought years 2015/16 and it was only the [[Gilgel Gibe III]] powerplant, that in 2016 just started to run in trial service on a 14&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; well-filled reservoir, that saved the economy of Ethiopia.&lt;ref name="Azeb"&gt;{{cite web|publisher= Capital Ethiopia|url= http://capitalethiopia.com/2017/01/02/power-play-2/|language=en|title=Power Play|date=2017-01-02|accessdate = 2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GERD-reservoir, once it has filled, has a total water volume of 74&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, 3 times the volume of Ethiopia's largest lake, [[Lake Tana]]. Filling it takes 5–15 years and even by using all generating units at maximum capacity will not drain it within a few months. The installed power of 6.450&amp;nbsp;MW in combination with the size of the reservoir will help managing the side-effects of the next severe drought, when other hydropower plants have to stop their operations.

== Benefits for Ethiopia ==
This section will only cover the benefits for Ethiopia, but there are also transboundary benefits expected.

A major benefit of the dam will be hydropower production. All the energy generated by GERD will be going into the national grid of Ethiopia to fully support the development of the whole country, both in rural and urban areas. The role of GERD will be to act as a stabilizing backbone of the Ethiopian national grid. There will be exports, but only if there is a total surplus of energy generated in Ethiopia. This is mainly expected to happen during rainy seasons, when there is plenty of water for hydropower generation.&lt;ref name="Azeb" /&gt;

The eventual surplus electricity of GERD which does not fit the demand inside Ethiopia, is then to be sold and exported to neighboring countries including Sudan and possibly Egypt, but also Djibouti. Revenues in US$ or in € are to be expected. Exporting the electricity from the dam would require the construction of massive transmission lines to major consumption centers such as Sudan’s capital [[Khartoum]], located more than 400&amp;nbsp;km away from the dam. These export sales would come on top of electricity that is expected to be sold from other large hydropower plants. Powerplants that have been readied or are under construction in Ethiopia, such as [[Gilgel Gibe III]] or [[Koysha]], whose exports (if given surplus energy) will mainly be going to [[Kenya]] through a 500&amp;nbsp;kV HVDC line.

The volume of the reservoir will be between 2–3 times that of Lake Tana which allows to expect abundant [[fish]]. Expected are up to 7,000 tonnes of fish annually as well as the reservoir becoming a hotspot for tourism.&lt;ref name="heraldic7000"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Ethiopian Herald (ENA)|url=http://ethpress.gov.et/herald/index.php/editorial-view-point/item/7729-the-reality-of-the-gerd|language=en|title=The reality of the GERD |date=2017-02-26|accessdate=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental and social impacts ==
[[File:Renaissance Reservoir.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Renaissance Reservoir]]
{{see also|Dams and reservoirs in Ethiopia}}
It appears that some form of environmental study has been undertaken, since the press reported that an international panel reviewed an environmental study in 2012. The NGO [[International Rivers]] has commissioned a local researcher to make a field visit because so little information is available.&lt;ref name="Field visit"&gt;{{cite web|last=Pottinger|first=Lori|title=Field Visit Report on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam|url=http://www.internationalrivers.org/resources/field-visit-report-on-the-grand-ethiopian-renaissance-dam-7815|publisher=International Rivers|accessdate=12 April 2013|date=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public consultation about dams in Ethiopia is affected by the political climate in the country. International Rivers reports that "conversations with civil society groups in Ethiopia indicate that questioning the government’s energy sector plans is highly risky, and there are legitimate concerns of government persecution. Because of this political climate, no groups are actively pursuing the issues surrounding hydro-power dams, nor publicly raising concerns about the risks In this situation, extremely limited and inadequate public consultation has been organised" during the implementation of major dams.&lt;ref&gt;International Rivers: [http://www.internationalrivers.org/files/EthioReport06Feb08.pdf What Cost Ethiopia’s Dam Boom?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122124816/http://www.internationalrivers.org/files/EthioReport06Feb08.pdf |date=2009-11-22 }}, February 2008, pp. 13–14, Retrieved on April 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2011, Ethiopian journalist Reeyot Alemu was imprisoned after she raised questions about the proposed Grand Millennium Dam. Staff of International Rivers have received death threats. In the meantime, the former prime minister Meles Zenawi called opponents of the project  "hydropower extremists" and "bordering on the criminal" at a conference of the [[International Hydropower Association]] (IHA) in Addis Abeba in April 2011. At the conference, the Ethiopian state power utility was embraced as a "Sustainability Partner" by the IHA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bosshard|first=Peter|title=Sustainable Hydropower – Ethiopian Style|url=http://www.internationalrivers.org/blogs/227/sustainable-hydropower-%E2%80%93-ethiopian-style|publisher=International Rivers|accessdate=12 April 2013|date=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impact on Ethiopia ===
Since the Blue Nile is a highly seasonal river, the dam would reduce flooding downstream of the dam, including on the 15&amp;nbsp;km stretch within Ethiopia. On the one hand, the reduction of flooding is beneficial since it protects settlements from flood damage. On the other hand, it can be harmful, if flood recession agriculture is practiced in the river valley downstream of the dam since it deprives fields from being watered. However, the next water regulating dam in Sudan, the [[Roseires Dam]], sits only a few dozens of kilometers downstream. The dam could also serve as a bridge across the Blue Nile, complementing a bridge that was under construction in 2009 further upstream.&lt;ref&gt;Daily Ethiopia:[http://www.dailyethiopia.com/index.php?aid=529 Longest Ever Bridge In Ethiopia Under Construction], December 31, 2009, Retrieved on April 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; An independent assessment estimated that at least 5,110 people will be resettled from the reservoir and downstream area, and the dam is expected to lead to a significant change in the fishery.&lt;ref name="Field visit" /&gt; According to an independent researcher who conducted research in the area where the dam is being built, near to 20,000 people are being relocated. According to the same source, "a solid plan (is) in place for the relocated people" and those who have already been resettled "were given more than they expected in compensation". Locals have never seen a dam before and "are not completely sure what a dam actually is", despite community meetings in which affected people were informed about the impacts of the dam on their livelihoods. Except for a few older people, almost all locals interviewed "expressed hope that the project brings something of benefit to them" in terms of education and health services or electricity supply based on the information available to them. At least some of the new communities for those relocated will be downstream of the dam. The area around the reservoir will consist of a 5&amp;nbsp;km buffer zone for malaria control that will not be available for settlement. In at least some upstream areas erosion control measures will be undertaken in order to reduce siltation of the reservoir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Veilleux|first=Jennifer|title=another view on the Nile : an interview with Jennifer Veilleux|url=http://catherinepfeifer.blogspot.de/2013/07/another-view-on-nile-interview-with.html|publisher=catherinepfeifer blog|accessdate=13 July 2013|date=2013-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impact on Sudan and Egypt ===
The precise impact of the dam on the downstream countries is not known. Egypt fears a temporary reduction of water availability due to the filling of the dam and a permanent reduction because of evaporation from the reservoir. Studies indicate that the primary factors which will govern the impacts during the reservoir filling phase include the initial reservoir elevation of the [[Aswan Dam|Aswan High Dam]], the rainfall that occurs during the filling period and the negotiated arrangement between the three countries. These studies also show that only through close and continuous coordination, the risks of negative impacts can be minimized or eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wheeler|first=Kevin G.|last2=Basheer|first2=Mohammed|last3=Mekonnen|first3=Zelalem T.|last4=Eltoum|first4=Sami O.|last5=Mersha|first5=Azeb|last6=Abdo|first6=Gamal M.|last7=Zagona|first7=Edith A.|last8=Hall|first8=Jim W.|last9=Dadson|first9=Simon J.|date=2016-06-06|title=Cooperative filling approaches for the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam|journal=Water International|volume=41|issue=4|pages=611–634|doi=10.1080/02508060.2016.1177698|issn=0250-8060}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reservoir volume (74 billion cubic meters) is about 1.5 times the average annual flow (49 billion cubic meters) of the Blue Nile at the Sudanese-Egyptian border. This loss to downstream countries could be spread over several years if the countries reach an agreement. Depending on the initial storage in the [[Aswan Dam|Aswan High Dam]] and this filling schedule of the GERD, flows into Egypt could be temporarily reduced, which may affect the income of two million farmers during the period of filling the reservoir. Allegedly, it would also "affect Egypt's electricity supply by 25 to 40 percent, while the dam is being built".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Death on the Nile|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/insidestory/2013/05/201353081623734349.html|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=13 July 2013|date=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, hydropower accounts for less than 12 percent of total electricity production in Egypt in 2010 (14 out of 121 billion [[kWh]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egypt Overview|url=http://www.eia.gov/countries/cab.cfm?fips=EG|publisher=US Energy Information Administration|accessdate=13 July 2013|date=18 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that a temporary reduction of 25 percent in hydropower production translates into an overall temporary reduction in Egyptian electricity production of less than 3 percent. The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam could also lead to a permanent lowering of the water level in [[Lake Nasser]], if floods are stored instead in Ethiopia. This would reduce the current evaporation of more than 10 billion cubic meter per year, but it would also reduce the ability of the Aswan High Dam to produce hydropower to the tune of a 100 MW loss of generating capacity for a 3&amp;nbsp;m reduction of the water level. However, the increased storage in Ethiopia can provide a greater buffer to shortages in Sudan and Egypt during years of future drought, if the countries can reach a compromise.

The dam will retain silt. It will thus increase the useful lifetime of dams in Sudan – such as the [[Roseires Dam]], the [[Sennar Dam]] and the [[Merowe Dam]] – and of the [[Aswan High Dam]] in Egypt. The beneficial and harmful effects of flood control would affect the Sudanese portion of the Blue Nile, just as it would affect the Ethiopian part of the Blue Nile valley downstream of the dam.&lt;ref name=panel&gt;{{cite web|title=The dam speech|url=http://grandmillenniumdam.net/international-panel-of-experts-on-renaissance-dam/#comment-1203|publisher=Grand Millennium Dam|accessdate=12 April 2013|date=20 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the GERD would reduce seasonal flooding of the plains surrounding the reservoir of the Roseires Dam located at [[Ad-Damazin]], just as the [[Tekeze Dam]], by retaining a reservoir in the deep gorges of the northern Ethiopian Highlands, had reduced flooding at Sudan's [[Khashm el-Girba Dam]].

The reservoir, located in the temperate [[Ethiopian Highlands]] and up to 140&amp;nbsp;m deep, will experience considerably less evaporation than downstream reservoirs such as [[Lake Nasser]] in Egypt, which loses 12% of its water flow due to evaporation as the water sits in the lake for 10 months. Through the controlled release of water from the reservoir to downstream, this could facilitate an ''increase'' of up to 5% in Egypt's water supply, and presumably that of Sudan as well.&lt;ref name=Regarding&gt;{{cite web |last=Salem |first=Mahmoud |title=Regarding the Dam |url=http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2013/06/03/regarding-the-dam/ |work=Daily News Egypt |accessdate=3 March 2014|date=2013-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Reactions: cooperation and condemnation ====
Egypt has serious concerns about the project so that it requested to be granted inspection allowance on the design and the studies of the dam, in order to allay its fears, but Ethiopia has denied the request unless Egypt relinquishes its veto on water allocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethiopia won't allow inspection of dam, but ready to negotiate with post-Mubarak Egypt|url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/409918|publisher=[[Almasry Alyoum]]|accessdate=27 April 2011|date=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a meeting between the Ministers of Water of Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia in March 2012, Sudan's President Bashir said that he supported the building of the dam.&lt;ref&gt;Tesfa-Alem Tekle:[http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article41839 Sudan’s Bashir supports Ethiopia’s Nile dam project], Sudan Tribune, March 8, 2012, retrieved on April 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

A Nile treaty signed by the upper riparian states in 2010, the Cooperative Framework Agreement, has not been signed by either Egypt or Sudan, as they claim it violates the 1959 treaty which gives Sudan and Egypt exclusive rights to the Nile's waters.&lt;ref&gt;Ashenafi Abedje, [[Voice of America]]:[http://www.voanews.com/english/news/africa/east/Nile-Series-Overview-11March11-118252974.html Nile River Countries Consider Cooperative Framework Agreement], March 18, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nile Basin Initiative]] provides a framework for dialogue among all Nile riparian countries.

Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan established an International Panel of Experts to review and assess the study reports of the dam. The panel consists of 10 members; 6 from the three countries and 4 international in the fields of water resources and hydrologic modelling, dam engineering, socioeconomic, and environmental.&lt;ref name=panel /&gt; The panel held its fourth meeting in Addis Ababa in November 2012. It reviewed documents about the environmental impact of the dam and visited the dam site.&lt;ref&gt;Tesfa-Alem Tekle:[http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article44698 Panel pushes study on Ethiopia’s Nile dam amid Egypt crises], Sudan Tribune, December 1, 2012, retrieved on April 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The panel submitted its preliminary report to the respective governments at the end of May 2013. Although the full report has not been made public, and will not be until it is reviewed by the governments, Egypt and Ethiopia both released details. The Ethiopian government stated that, according to the report, "the design of the dam is based on international standards and principles" without naming those standards and principles. It also said that the dam "offers high benefit for all the three countries and would not cause significant harm on both the lower riparian countries".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=International Panel of Experts on GERD Releases Its Report|url=http://www.insideethiopia.net/,00,00,00/00,00,61.htm|accessdate=7 June 2013|newspaper=Inside Ethiopia|date=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Egyptian government, however, the report "recommended changing and amending the dimensions and the size of the dam".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ethiopia agrees on recommendations of tripartite committee|url=http://www.sis.gov.eg/En/Story.aspx?sid=68410|accessdate=7 June 2013|newspaper=Egyptian State Information Service|date=2 June 2013}} (link was dead and story could not be found on the ESIS website on July 2, 2013, but a quote can be found at HornAffairs:[http://hornaffairs.com/en/2013/06/02/egypt-the-report-modifies-renaissance-dams-size-dimensions/ Egypt: The report modifies renaissance dam's size, dimensions])&lt;/ref&gt;

An aide to the Ethiopian Prime Minister stated that Egypt is "...entitled to day dreaming" and cited Egypt's past of trying to destabilize Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ethiopia: Egypt Attack Proposals ‘Day Dreaming’|url=http://www.yalibnan.com/2013/06/05/ethiopia-egypt-attack-proposals-day-dreaming/|accessdate=7 June 2013|newspaper=Ya Libnan|date=5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morsi reportedly believes that it is better to engage Ethiopia rather than attempt to force them.&lt;ref name=postdes /&gt; However, on 10 June 2013, he said that "all options are open" because "Egypt's water security cannot be violated at all," clarifying that he was "not calling for war," but that he would not allow Egypt's water supply to be endangered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egyptian warning over Ethiopia Nile dam|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-22850124|accessdate=10 June 2013|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, Egypt left negotiations over the dam, citing Ethiopian intransigence.&lt;ref name=AlJazeera /&gt; Ethiopia countered that Egypt had set an immediate halt on construction and an increase of its share to 90% as the preconditions, which were deemed wholly unreasonable. Egypt has since launched a diplomatic offensive to undermine support for the dam, sending its [[Foreign Minister of Egypt|Foreign Minister]], [[Nabil Fahmi]] to [[Tanzania]] and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] to garner support. Egyptian media outlets declared the visits productive and that the leaders of those nations had expressed "understanding" and "support" of Egypt's position.&lt;ref name=DailyFahmy&gt;{{cite news|title=Fahmy meets Tanzanian president ahead of Congo visit |url=http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2014/02/23/fahmy-meets-tanzanian-president-ahead-congo-visit/|accessdate=3 March 2014|newspaper=Daily News Egypt}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the accuracy of such statements are questionable; when Sudanese Foreign Minister [[Ali Karti]] criticised Egypt for "inflaming the situation" through its statements on the dam, and that it was considering the interests of both sides ''[[Al-Masry Al-Youm]]'' declared that Sudan had "proclaimed its neutrality".&lt;ref name=STribune /&gt;&lt;ref name=AlMasry&gt;{{cite news|title=Sudan declares neutrality in Renaissance Dam problem, offers mediation between Egypt and Ethiopia|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/sudan-declares-neutrality-renaissance-dam-problem-offers-mediation-between-egypt-and-ethiopia|accessdate=3 March 2014|newspaper=Egypt Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign is intensive and wide-reaching; in March 2014, for the first time, just [[Uganda]], [[Kenya]], [[Sudan]],  and [[Tanzania]] were invited by Egypt to participate in the [[Nile Hockey Tournament]].&lt;ref name=TZDaily&gt;{{cite news|title=Tanzania Gets Nile Hockey Tourney Invitation|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201402200119.html|accessdate=3 March 2014|newspaper=Tanzania Daily News|date=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign Minister Fahmi and Water Resources Minister [[Muhammad Abdul Muttalib]] planned visits to Italy and Norway to express their concerns and try to compel them to pull their support for the GERD.&lt;ref name=UPI1 /&gt;

In April 2014 Ethiopia's Prime Minister invited Egypt and Sudan to another round of talks over the dam and Nabil Fahmi stated in May 2014 that Egypt was still open to negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/101606/Egypt/Politics-/Egypt-willing-to-negotiate-over-Ethiopias-dam-Fore.aspx | title=Egypt willing to negotiate over Ethiopia's dam: Foreign minister | publisher=Ahram Online | date=18 May 2014 | accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following an August 2014 Tripartite Ministerial-level meeting, the three nations agreed to set up a Tripartite National Committee (TNC) meeting over the dam.

After learning of those accused of treason for protesting against [[apartheid]], including [[Nelson Mandela]], Collins created the fund in order to pay all legal expenses and look after the families of those on trial. The group was non-partisan.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/international-defence-and-aid-fund-idaf-3|title=The International Defence and Aid Fund (IDAF)|last=|first=|date=14 February 2013|website=South African History Online|publisher=|access-date=10 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was one of the first examples of foreign intervention against apartheid in South Africa and proved very successful with over £75,000 being raised towards defending those accused. Ultimately all were acquitted &lt;ref&gt;Interview with John Collins from the BBC documentary 'World Against Apartheid' (Episode 1 at 14 minutes); [https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b01b9hbg/The_World_Against_Apartheid_Have_You_Heard_from_Johannesburg_The_Road_to_Resistance/]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, the Defence Aid Fund for Southern Africa founded Canon Collins Trust, now known as [[Canon Collins Educational &amp; Legal Assistance Trust]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
The IDAF had its start with Collins, who first wired funds to help the 156 South Africans facing charges of High Treason.{{Sfn|Herbstein|2004|p=27}} Collins wired "all available [[Christian Action]] funds" in order to create a defence fund for the [[defendant]]s.{{Sfn|Herbstein|2004|p=27}} Collins ensured that the defendants had the "best and most progressive lawyers."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1957, the campaigner [[Mary Benson (campaigner)|Mary Benson]] joined the Defence Fund as its secretary.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.senatehouselibrary.ac.uk/blog/no-easy-walk-freedom-nelson-mandela-archives&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ambrose Reeves]], the Bishop of [[Johannesburg]], felt that there would be other treason trials in the future and so he asked Collins to set a "more permanent structure to defend political prisoners."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Collins set up the British Defence and Aid Fund (BDAF) in response.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; At first BDAF was part of Christian Action, but it eventually separated from Christian Action in order to work more independently.{{Sfn|Herbstein|2004|p=36}}

In addition to having independent action the fund needed to become international.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1964, the organization opened branches in [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], [[Australia]] and [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Collins invited delegates from the countries that had branches to come to the Russell Hotel in [[Bloomsbury]] and together they officially founded the newly named International Defence and Aid Fund (IDAF) on June 20, 1964.{{Sfn|Herbstein|2004|p=103-104}} In November of that year, the United Nations gave the group a "stamp of approval."{{Sfn|Herbstein|2004|p=104}} In addition, [[Amnesty International]] and the Joint Committee for High Commission Territories became involved.{{Sfn|Herbstein|2004|p=104}}

The South African branch of IDAF was banned in South Africa on March 18, 1966 under the [[Suppression of Communism Act, 1950|Suppression of Communism Act]] and the government made it illegal for anyone to receive funds from IDAF.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Because of this the organization in London created three different programs which had different names in order to send money to South Africa. Under Programme 1 which focused on political trials and defence was the Freedom From Fear International Charitable Foundation, under Programme 2 which focused on the families of [[political prisoner]]s was the Freedom From Hunger International Charitable Foundation and Programme 3 focused on research and publications and used the Freedom From Hardship International Trust.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Activist, [[Phyllis Altman]], who worked with the [[South African Congress of Trade Unions]] (SACTU), became the general secretary of projects under Programme 1.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Altman helped set up a "scam" which masked any connection between IDAF and the lawyers they paid.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Altman and Collins were the only two who knew how the money was being transferred.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During this time, Collins' house became a "safe venue" for IDAF.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Lawyers in South Africa who were funded by the IDAF, such as [[Griffiths Mxenge]] and [[Victoria Mxenge]] were assassinated.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In the 1970s, a spy, named [[Craig Williamson]], infiltrated an organization called the International University Exchange Fund (IUEF), which gave money to students leaving repressive regimes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Altman did not trust him and would not discuss IDAF's "inner mechanisms" with Williamson.{{Sfn|Herbstein|2004|p=216}} Williamson was able to cause enough trouble so that the [[Politics of Denmark|Danish Government]] became suspicious of IDAF and the Labour government minister [[Judith Hart]] turned down a request for funds from IDAF.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Williamson and IUEF were exposed by Arthur McGiven in a story published in the ''[[The Observer|Observer]]''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Collins died in 1982 and [[Trevor Huddleston]] became the new director.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Altman stayed on long enough to help the transition, but retired once she felt the new people in the organization were settled.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Horst Kleinschmidt took over from Altman.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; During the 1980s, IDAF received more and more requests for defence and for the families of the imprisoned.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; When apartheid was ended in 1989, IDAF "found itself having to undergo a fundamental review of its reason for existing.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Eventually each programme of IDAF was taken over by other agencies.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Kropyvnytskyi''' ({{lang-uk|Кропивницький|Kropyvnyc'kyj}} {{IPA-uk|krɔpɪu̯ˈnɪtsʲkɪj|}}) is a [[city]] in central [[Ukraine]] on the [[Inhul]] river, and is the administrative center of the [[Kirovohrad Oblast]]. Population: {{Ua-pop-est2015|232 052}}.

Between 1939 and 2016 it was called '''Kirovohrad''' ({{lang-uk|Кіровогра́д}} {{IPA-uk|kirɔwɔˈɦrɑd|}}; {{lang-ru|Кировогра́д|Kirovograd}}) after the First Secretary of the [[Leningrad City Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Leningrad City Committee]] of the [[All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)]] [[Sergei Kirov]]. Earlier names included '''Yelisavetgrad''' ({{lang-uk|Єлисаветград|Jelisavethrad}}) and '''Zinovyevsk''' ({{lang-uk|Зінов'євськ|Zinov"jec'k}}).

The city is the birthplace of noted figures such as [[Grigory Zinoviev]], [[Volodymyr Vynnychenko]], [[Arseny Tarkovsky]], [[African Spir]] and others.

==Name origin==
Over its history, Kropyvnytskyi has changed its name several times. Presenting a letter of grant on January 11, 1752 to Major-General [[Jovan Horvat]], the organizer of [[Nova Serbia]] settlements, the Empress [[Elizabeth of Russia]] ordered "to found an earthen fortress and name it [[Fort St. Elizabeth]]" (see [http://library.kr.ua/kray/shlakhovoy/elname.html On the Historical Meaning of the Name Elizabeth for Our City]) (in [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]). Thus simultaneously the future city was named in honour of its formal founder, the Russian empress, and also in honor of her heavenly patroness, [[Elizabeth (Biblical person)|St. Elizabeth]].

The name '''Yelisavetgrad''' (usually spelled '''Elisavetgrad''' or '''Elizabethgrad''' in English language publications) is believed to have evolved as the amalgamation of the fortress name and the common [[East Slavs|Eastern Slavonic]] element "[[Gord (Slavic settlement)|-grad]]" ([[Old East Slavic|Old]]/[[Old Church Slavonic|Church Slavonic]] "градъ", "a settlement encompassed by a wall"). Its first documented usage dates back to 1764, when Yelisavetgrad Province was organized together with the Yelisavetgrad [[Lancer]] Regiment.

Following the Russian Revolution and founding of the [[Soviet Union]], in 1924 the city was renamed '''Zinovievsk''', (also spelled '''Zinovyevsk'''), after [[Grigory Zinoviev]], a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] statesman and one of the leaders of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)]].&lt;ref name=nnotk/&gt; He was born in Yelisavetgrad on September 20 (September 8 [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|O.S.]]), 1883. At the time he was honored by the name, he was a member of the [[Politburo]] and the Chairman of the [[Comintern]]'s Executive Committee.

On December 27, 1934, after the assassination of [[Sergei Kirov]], Zinovievsk and other [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] cities was renamed again - this time as '''Kirovo''', and then as '''Kirovograd'''.&lt;ref name=nnotk/&gt; The latter name appeared simultaneously with the creation of Kirovograd Oblast, on January 10, 1939&lt;ref name=nnotk/&gt; and was aimed at differentiating the region from [[Kirov Oblast]] in present-day [[Russia]].

After [[Ukraine]] regained independence, the name of the city started to be spelled according to Ukrainian pronunciation as '''Kirovohrad.''' The previous Russified orthography remains widely used on account of the widespread use of the Russian language in the region.

Since 1991 numerous discussions had been held on the city's name. A number of activists supported returning the city to its original name, Yelisavetgrad (or now '''Yelysavethrad''' in [[Romanization of Ukrainian|Ukrainian transcription]]). Other suggestions for contemporary Ukraine included ''Tobilevychi'' (in honour of the [[Tobilevych]] family, the Coryphaei of the classic Ukrainian drama established in Yelisavetgrad in 1882); ''Zlatopil'', from Ukrainian "золоте поле", literally "golden field"; and ''Stepohrad'', Ukrainian for "city of [[steppe]]s" (in recognition of the agricultural status of the city); ''Ukrayinsk'' or ''Ukrayinoslav'', i.e. "the glorifying Ukraine one;" and ''Novokozachyn'' (to commemorate the semi-fabulous [[Cossacks|Cossack]] regiment which could have been quartered at the present-day city location).

The President of Ukraine, [[Petro Poroshenko]], signed the bill [[Decommunization in Ukraine|banning Communist symbols]] on May 15, 2015, which required places associated with communism to be renamed within a six-month period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/265988.html|title=Poroshenko signs laws on denouncing Communist, Nazi regimes|publisher=|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 October 2015 (during [[2015 Ukrainian local elections|local elections]]) 76.6% of the Kirovohrad voters voted for renaming the city to Yelisavetgrad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/299070.html|title=77% of Kirovograd residents favor return of city's name of Yelisavetgrad - media|publisher=|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A draft law currently before the Ukrainian parliament would prohibit any names associated with Russian history since the 14th century, which would make the name Yelisavetgrad inadmissible as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortruss.blogspot.ca/2015/10/ukrainian-parliament-introduced-bill-to.html|title=Ukrainian Parliament introduced a bill to ban all Russian geographic names starting from the XIV century|publisher=|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A committee of the [[Verkhovna Rada]] (Ukraine's parliament) chose the name Inhulsk on 23 December 2015.

Developed around a [[military settlement]], the city rose to prominence in the 19th century when it became an important [[trade]] centre, as well as a Ukrainian cultural leader with the first professional [[theatre|theatrical]] company in either Central or Eastern Ukraine being established here in 1882.

The history of the city foundation dates back to the year 1754 when St. Elizabeth's fortress was built on the lands of former Zaporizka Sich in the upper course of the Inhul, Suhokleya and Biyanka Rivers.
The historic name of the city Yelysavethrad was changed to Zinovyevsk in 1924, for Kirovo in 1934. The city was renamed Kirovohrad on the 10th of January, 1939.

The history of Kropyvnytskyi starts from the [[Fort St. Elizabeth|Fort of St. Elizabeth]]. This fort was built in 1754 by the will of the empress [[Elizabeth of Russia]] and it played a pivotal role in the new lands added to Russia by the [[Belgrad Peace Treaty]] of 1739. In 1764 the settlement received status of the center of the Elizabeth province, and in 1784 the status of chief town of a district, when it was renamed after the fort as ''Yelizavetgrad''.

The Fort of St. Elizabeth was on a crossroads of trade routes, and it eventually became a major trade center. The city has held regular fairs four times a year. Merchants from all over the [[Russian Empire]] have visited these fairs. Also, there were numerous foreign merchants, especially from [[Greece]].

Elizabethgrad was located in the [[Pale of Settlement]] and, during the 19th century, had a substantial Jewish population.

The first Ukrainian professional theater in Ukraine was built in Kropyvnytskyi in 1882.&lt;ref name=nnotk&gt;[http://www.unian.info/politics/1417120-sweeping-out-soviet-past-kirovohrad-renamed-kropyvnytsky.html Sweeping out Soviet past: Kirovohrad renamed Kropyvnytsky], [[UNIAN]] (14 July 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded by [[Mark Kropyvnytsky]],&lt;ref name=nnotk/&gt; [[Tobilevych]] brothers and [[Maria Zankovetska]].&lt;ref name=nnotk/&gt;

Elizabethgrad was ravaged by [[famine]] in 1901 and its residents suffered more due to poor government response.  The region is extremely fertile. However, a drought in 1892 and poor farming methods which never allowed the soil to recover, prompted a large famine that plagued the region.  According to a 1901 ''New York Times'' article, the Ministry of the Interior denied that the persistence of famine in the region and blocked non-State charities from bringing aid to the area.  The reporter wrote, "The existence of famine was inconvenient at a time when negotiations were pending for foreign loans." The governor of the [[Kherson Governorate|Kherson region]], Prince [[Oblonsky]], refused to acknowledge this famine. One non-resident and non-State worker entered Elizabethgrad and provided the ''New York Times'' with an eye-witness account.&lt;ref name="famine"&gt;"Famine and Disease in South Russia Province" ''New York Times'', 5 Aug. 1901. New York Times. 26 June 2009 [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1901/08/05/108286078.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; He observed: general and acute destitution; deaths from starvation; widespread [[typhus]] (shows poverty), and little to no work to be found in the region.

Elizabethgrad was subjected to several violent  [[pogrom]]s in the late 19th and early 20th century. In 1905 another riot flared, with Christians killing Jews and plundering the Jewish quarter.&lt;ref name="enc"&gt;Rosenthal, Herman. Broyde, Isaac. Janovsy, S. Jewish Encyclopedia.com [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=32&amp;letter=Y "Yelisavetgrad:Elisavetgrad"], accessed June 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; A contemporary account was reported in the ''[[New York Times]]'' on December 13, 1905..&lt;ref name="pogrom"&gt;"Russian City Burning; Jews Are Massacred," ''NY Times'', 12 Dec. 1905, accessed 25 June 2009 [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1905/12/13/101424757.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

During Soviet rule, the city economy was dominated by such enterprises as [http://www.elvorti.com/ Chervona Zirka Agricultural Machinery Plant] (current name Elvorti; which once provided more than 50% of the USSR need in tractor [[seed drill|seeders]]), [[Hydrosila|Hydrosila Hydraulic Units Plant]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20071009065649/http://www.radiy.kr.ua/ Radiy Radio Component Plant], Pishmash Typewriter Plant (de facto defunct nowadays) and others.

In [[World War II]] Kropyvnytskyi was occupied by [[Nazi Germany]] from 5 August 1941. It was subsequently recaptured by Soviet forces on 8 January 1944.

During the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2004|Ukrainian presidential election of 2004]], the city got country-wide notoriety because of mass [[election fraud]] committed by local authorities. It became known as District 100 (the community number according to Central Elections Committee).{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

From 1878 to 1905 Oleksandr Pashutin was mayor of the city. Under his administration, the city made advances in education and medicine, construction of the water-supply system and several public buildings, introduction of the first tram, and establishing some market places. Yelizavethrad is noted for its architectural quality, with European-type sculpture and old windows. Surviving are a range of classical and modern monuments, Mooresque and Baroque palaces, and buildings that combine Gothic, Rococo and Renaissance motives. A high level of building technology of Yelizavethrad's masters encourages construction and restoration these days.

The history of Kropyvnytskyi consists of memorable events and biographies of famous people. One of the creators of the unsurpassed modern architectural ensemble of the historical centre of the city of Yelisavethrad, Y. Pauchenko was born and lived here. Such noted architects as A. Dostoyevskyi and O. Lishnevskyi worked here, too.
P. Kalnyshevsky fought for the Cossacks' freedom on these lands, M. Pirohov laid the foundation of field surgery, M. Kutuzov planned his military operations.
Kirovohraders listened to the lectures of the outstanding slavist V. Hryhorovych, and inherited the fundamental investigations of the native land carried out by the ethnographer, historian, archeologist V. Yastrebov.

In different periods of time the history of our region was connected with the names of the famous Ukrainian writer, playwright, publicist and statesman V. Vynnychenko, the poet, literary and cultural critic Y. Malanyuk, the physicist-theoretician, the Nobel Prize laureate I. Tamm, the scientist and inventor, one of the creators of the legendary "Katyusha" G. Langeman, the composer Y. Meytus, the pianist and pedagogue G. Neigauz, the artist and painter O. Osmiorkin, the poet and translator A. Tarkovskyi, the public and cultural figure, memoirist, patron of the arts Y. Chykalenko, the composer, pianist, pedagogue, musician and publicist K. Shymanovskyi, Ukrainian writer, dramatist and script-writer Y. Yanovskyi.

==Geography==
The city is in the center of Ukraine and within the [[Dnieper Upland]]. The [[Inhul]] river flows through Kropyvnytskyi. Within the city, several other smaller rivers and brooks runs in the Inhul; they include the Suhoklia and the Biyanka.

==Symbols==
Three blue stripes crossed in the middle of the fortress plan symbolize the fortification location at the confluence of the Inhul, Suhukleya and Biyanka rivers. The crimson colour favoured by Cossacks refers to the fortress being situated on the lands of Zaporozky Cossacks. Golden ears together with a golden field on the shield are symbols of the fertile lands and agricultural wealth of the region.

The shield is held by storks, which symbolize happiness, fertility, and love for the native land. The golden tower in the form of a crown expresses that this coat of arms belongs to the regional centre. The motto "With peace and good" placed on the azure stripe emphasizes the same idea. All the details of the flag correlate with the main elements of the shield on the coat of arms of the city.

==Administrative status==
Today Kropyvnytskyi is a [[City of regional significance (Ukraine)|city of oblast significance]] with 244,000 inhabitants. It is divided into two districts — Fortechnyi and Podilskyi. The [[urban-type settlement]] of [[Nove, Kirovohrad Oblst|Nove]] is part of the Fortechnyi district. Kropyvnytskyi serves as the administrative center of [[Kirovohrad Raion]], though administratively it does not belong to the raion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13507">In [[Common law#History|common law]] systems, '''land tenure''' is the legal [[regime]] in which land is owned by an individual, who is said to "hold" the land.  It determines who can use land, for how long, and under what conditions. Tenure may be based both on official laws and policies, and on informal customs.  The French verb "tenir" means "to hold" and "tenant" is the present participle of "tenir". The sovereign monarch, known as [[The Crown]], held land in its own right. All private owners are either its tenants or sub-tenants. ''Tenure'' signifies the relationship between tenant and lord, not the relationship between tenant and land.  Over history, many different forms of '''land ownership''', i.e., ways of owning land,  have been established.

A '''landholder'''/'''landowner''' is a holder of the [[estate in land]] with considerable rights of ownership or, simply put, an owner of land.

==Feudal tenure==
{{Main|Fief|Feudal land tenure in England}}
Historically in the system of [[feudalism]], the lords who received land directly from the Crown were called [[tenants-in-chief]]. They doled out portions of their land to lesser tenants in exchange for services, who in turn divided it among even lesser tenants. This process—that of granting subordinate tenancies—is known as [[subinfeudation]]. In this way, all individuals except the monarch were said to hold the land "of" someone else.

Historically, it was usual for there to be reciprocal duties between lord and tenant. There were different kinds of tenure to fit various kinds of duties that a tenant might owe to a lord. For instance, a military tenure might be by [[knight-service]], requiring the tenant to supply the lord with a number of armed horsemen. The concept of tenure has since evolved into other forms, such as [[lease]]s and [[estate (house)|estates]].

== Modes of ownership and tenure ==
There is a great variety of modes of '''land ownership and tenure'''.

===Traditional land tenure===
For example, most of the indigenous nations or tribes of [[North America]] had differing nations of land ownership.  Whereas European land ownership centered around control, Indigenous notions were based on stewardship.  When [[Europe]]ans first came to North America, they sometimes disregarded traditional land tenure and simply seized land, or they accommodated traditional land tenure by recognizing it as [[aboriginal title]]. This theory formed the basis for [[Treaty#Treaties and indigenous peoples|treaties with indigenous peoples]].

===Ownership of land by swearing to make productive use of it===
In several developing countries such as Egypt, Senegal, this method is still presently in use.  In Senegal, it is mentioned as "mise en valeur des zones du terroir"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/007/j2815e/j2815e04.htm |title=Till to Tiller: Linkages between international remittances and access to land in West Africa |website=www.fao.org |access-date=2017-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Egypt, it is called Wadaa al-yad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/print/2009/03/sinai/teague-text |title=National Geographic Magazine – NGM.com |website=ngm.nationalgeographic.com |access-date=2017-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allodial title===
[[Allodial title]] is a system in which [[real property]] is owned absolutely free and clear of any superior landlord or sovereign.  True allodial title is rare, with most property ownership in the [[common law]] world ([[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Ireland]], [[New Zealand]], [[United Kingdom]], [[United States]]) being in [[fee simple]]. Allodial title is inalienable, in that it may be conveyed, devised, gifted, or mortgaged by the owner, but it may not be distressed and restrained for collection of taxes or private debts, or condemned ([[eminent domain]]) by the government.

===Feudal land tenure===
[[Feudal land tenure]] is a system of mutual obligations under which a [[monarchy|royal]] or [[nobility|noble]] personage granted a [[fiefdom]] — some degree of interest in the use or revenues of a given parcel of land — in exchange for a claim on services such as military service or simply maintenance of the land in which the [[lord]] continued to have an interest.  This pattern obtained from the level of high nobility as vassals of a [[monarch]] down to lesser nobility whose only vassals were their [[serf]]s.

===Fee simple===
Under [[common law]],  [[Fee simple]] is the most complete ownership interest one can have in [[real property]], other than the rare [[Allodial title]]. The holder can typically freely sell or otherwise transfer that interest or use it to [[mortgage law|secure a mortgage loan]]. This picture of "complete ownership" is, of course, complicated by the obligation in most places to pay a [[property tax]] and by the fact that if the land is mortgaged, there will be a claim on it in the form of a [[lien]].  In modern societies, this is the most common form of land ownership. Land can also be owned by more than one party and there are various [[concurrent estate]] rules.

===Native title===
In Australia, [[native title]] is a common law concept that recognizes that some indigenous people have certain land rights that derive from their traditional laws and customs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nntt.gov.au/What-Is-Native-Title/Pages/What-is-Native-Title.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623111226/http://www.nntt.gov.au/What-Is-Native-Title/Pages/What-is-Native-Title.aspx |archivedate=2010-06-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Native title can co-exist with non-indigenous proprietary rights and in some cases different indigenous groups can exercise their native title over the same land.

===Life estate===
Under [[common law]], [[Life estate]] is an interest in real property that ends at death.  The holder has the use of the land for life, but typically no ability to transfer that interest or to use it to [[mortgage law|secure a mortgage loan]].

===Fee tail===
Under common law, [[fee tail]] is hereditary, non-transferable ownership of real property.  A similar concept, the ''[[legitime]]'', exists in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil]] and [[Roman law]]; the ''legitime'' limits the extent to which one may disinherit an heir.

===Leasehold===
Under both common law and civil law, land may be [[lease]]d or [[renting|rented]] by its owner to another party.  A wide range of arrangements are possible, ranging from very short terms to the 99-year leases common in the [[United Kingdom]], and allowing various degrees of freedom in the use of the property.

===Common land===
Rights to use a [[common land|common]] may include such rights as the use of a road or the right to graze one's animals on commonly owned land.

===Sharecropping===
When [[sharecropping]], one has use of agricultural land owned by another person in exchange for a share of the resulting crop or livestock.

===Easement===
[[Easement]]s allow one to make certain specific uses of land that is owned by someone else. The most classic easement is [[Right of way|right-of-way]], but it could also include (for example) the right to run an electrical power line across someone else's land.

===Other===
In addition, there are various forms of collective ownership, which typically take either the form of membership in a [[cooperative]], or shares in a [[corporation]], which owns the land (typically by fee simple, but possibly under other arrangements). There are also various hybrids; in many [[communist state]]s, government ownership of most agricultural land has combined in various ways with tenure for farming collectives.

== Land tenure in archaeology ==
In archaeology, traditions of land tenure can be studied according to [[Territoriality (nonverbal communication)|territoriality]] and through the ways in which people create and utilize landscape boundaries, both natural and constructed. Less tangible aspects of tenure are harder to qualify, and study of these relies heavily on either the anthropological record (in the case of pre-literate societies) or textual evidence (in the case of literate societies).

In archaeology, land tenure traditions can be studied across the longue durée, for example land tenure based on [[kinship]] and collective property management. This makes it possible to study the long-term consequences of change and development in land tenure systems and agricultural productivity.

Moreover, an archaeological approach to land tenure arrangements studies the temporal aspects of land governance, including their sometimes temporary, impermanent and [[Negotiation|negotiable]] aspects as well as uses of past forms of tenure. For example, people can lay claim to, or profess to own resources, through reference to ancestral memory within society. In these cases, the nature of and relationships with aspects of the past, both tangible (e.g. monuments) and intangible (e.g. concepts of history through story telling) are used to legitimize the present.

== Importance of tenure today ==
Tenure in the developed world has become less of a rally point or issue than traditionally, however, with exploding homeless populations, the developed world is not immune from these issues.  Furthermore, laws such as [[California Proposition 13 (1978)]] coupled with soaring home prices can limit severely limit supply, thereby exacerbating [[homelessness]] and [[informal housing]] arrangements, which can lead to tenure complications.  At the same time, property is upended by [[climate change]] impacts that are becoming more frequent.

In the developing world, catastrophes are impacting greater numbers of people due to [[urbanization]], [[crowding]], and weak tenure and legal systems.

The concepts of landlord and tenant have been recycled to refer to the modern relationship of the parties to land which is held under a [[lease]]. It has been pointed out by Professor [[F.H. Lawson]] in ''Introduction to the Laws of Property'' (1958), however, that the landlord-tenant relationship never really fitted in the feudal system and was rather an "alien commercial element".

The doctrine of tenure did not apply to personalty ([[personal property]]). However, the relationship of [[bailment]] in the case of [[Personal property|chattels]] closely resembles the landlord-tenant relationship that can be created in land.

Secure land tenure also recognizes one's legal residential status in urban areas and it is a key characteristics of [[slum]]s. Slum dwellers do not have legal title to the land and thus are usually marginalized and ignored by the local governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Field |first=E. |title=Property rights and investment in urban slums |journal=Journal of the European Economic Association |year=2005 |volume=3 |issue=2-3 |pages=279–290 |doi=10.1162/jeea.2005.3.2-3.279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the Committee on World Food Security, based at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, endorsed the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure as the [http://www.fao.org/cfs/home/activities/vggt/en/ global norm], as the problem of poor and politically marginalized especially likely to suffer from insecure tenure, however, this is merely work in progress.

The MST differs from previous land reform movements in its single-issue focus; land reform for them is a self-justifying cause. The organization maintains that it is legally justified in occupying unproductive land, pointing to the most recent [[Constitution of Brazil]] (1988), which contains a passage saying that land should fulfill a social function (Article 5, XXIII). The MST also notes, based on 1996 census statistics, that 3% of the population owns two-thirds of all [[arable land]] in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mstbrazil.org/?q=about About the MST] on mstbrazil.org. Accessed September 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Land reform before the 1988 constitution==

Land reform has a long history in Brazil, and the concept pre-dates the MST. In the mid-20th century, Brazilian leftists reached a consensus that [[democratization]] and widespread actual exercise of political rights would require land reform.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Moran,Geraint Parry, eds., ''Democracy and Democratization''. London: Routledge, 1994, {{ISBN|0-415-09049-0}}, page 191; Arthur MacEwan, ''Neo-liberalism Or Democracy?: Economic Strategy, Markets, and Alternatives for the 21st Century''. London: Zed Books, 1999, {{ISBN|1-85649-724-0}}, page 148&lt;/ref&gt; Brazilian political elites actively opposed land reform initiatives, which they felt threatened their social and political status.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lipton, ''Land Reform in Developing Countries: Property Rights and Property Wrongs'' London: Routledge, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-415-09667-6}}, p. 275 ; Rodolfo Stavenhagen, ''Between Underdevelopment and Revolution: A Latin American Perspective''. New Delhi: Abhinav, 1981, p. 10; Carlos H. Waisman,Raanan Rein, eds., ''Spanish and Latin American Transitions to Democracy''. Brighton: Sussex Academic Press, 2006, {{ISBN|1-903900-73-5}}, pp. 156/157&lt;/ref&gt; As such, political leaders of the rural poor attempted to achieve land reform from below, through [[grassroots]] action. MST broke new ground by tackling land reform itself, "breaking... dependent relations with parties, governments, and other institutions",&lt;ref&gt;Bernardo Mançano Fernandes, "The MST and Agrarian Reform in Brazil". ''Socialism and Democracy online'', 51, Vol. 23, No.3, available at [http://sdonline.org/51/the-mst-and-agrarian-reform-in-brazil/]&lt;/ref&gt; and framing the issue in purely political terms rather than social, ethical or religious ones.

The first statute to regulate land ownership in Brazil after its [[Independence of Brazil|independence]], Law 601 or ''Lei de Terras'' (Landed Property Act), took effect September 18, 1850. A [[Colonialism|colonial administration]], based on Portuguese [[feudal law]], had previously considered property ownership to stem from royal grants (''sesmarias'') and pass through [[primogeniture]] (''morgadio''). In the independent Brazilian state, the default means of acquiring land was through purchase, from either the state or a previous private owner. This law strongly limited [[squatter's right]]s and favoured the historic concentration of land ownership which became a hallmark of modern Brazilian [[social history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Carlos Ignacio Pinto |url=http://www.klepsidra.net/klepsidra5/lei1850.html |title=A Lei de Terras de 1850 |publisher=Klepsidra.net |accessdate=2012-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Lei de Terras'' left in place the colonial practice of favouring of large landholdings created by mammoth land grants to well-placed people, which were usually worked by slaves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert M. Levine]], John Crocitti, eds., ''The Brazil Reader: History, Culture, Politics''. Duke University Press, 1999, {{ISBN|0-8223-2258-7}}, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt;

In capitalist terms, continuing the policy favoured [[economies of scale]] given the limited number of land owners, but at the same time made it difficult for small planters and peasants to obtain the land needed to practice [[subsistence agriculture]] and small-scale farming.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Wolford, ''This Land Is Ours Now: Social Mobilization and the Meanings of Land in Brazil''. Duke University Press, 2010, {{ISBN|978-0-8223-4539-8}}, pages 38 sqq.&lt;/ref&gt;

The consolidation of land ownership into just a few hands had ties to the advent of [[capitalism]] in Brazil, and opposition and insurrection in the 19th and early 20th century (for example the [[Canudos War]] in the 1890s and the [[Contestado War]] in the 1910s) idealized older forms of property{{which|date=August 2017}} and revitalized ideologies&lt;ref&gt;[[Candace Slater]], ''Trail of Miracles: Stories from a Pilgrimage in Northeast Brazil''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1986, {{ISBN|0-520-05306-0}}, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; centered on a fabled [[millenarian]] return to an earlier, pre-bourgeois social order. Advocated by groups led by rogue [[messianism|messianic]] religious leaders outside the established [[Catholic]] hierarchy, these ideologies seemed [[heretic]]al and revolutionary.&lt;ref&gt;Michael L. Conniff, Frank D. MacCann, eds., ''Modern Brazil: Elites and Masses in Historical Perspective''. The University of Nebraska Press, 1991, {{ISBN|0-8032-6348-1}}, page 133&lt;/ref&gt; Some leftist historians, following the tracks of the groundbreaking 1963 work by journalist {{ILL|Rui Facó|fr}} (''Cangaceiros e Fanáticos''), tend to conflate early 20th-century banditry in northeastern Brazil (''[[cangaço]]'') with messianism as a kind of [[Social bandits|social banditry]], a protest against such social inequalities as the uneven distribution of land assets.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah R. Sarzynski, ''History, Identity and the Struggle for Land in Northeastern Brazil, 1955--1985''. ProQuest, 2008: page 284&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Candace Slater, ''Stories on a String: The Brazilian Literatura de Cordel''. University of California Press, 1982, {{ISBN|0-520-04154-2}}, page 210,  footnote 10&lt;/ref&gt; This theory developed independently in English-speaking academia around [[Eric Hobsbawn]]'s 1959 work ''Primitive Rebels''. It was criticized for its unspecific definition of "social movement", but also praised for melding political and religious movements, previously separately examined.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Burke (historian)|Peter Burke]], ''História e teoria social''. São Paulo: UNESP, 2002, {{ISBN|85-7139-380-X}} , page 125&lt;/ref&gt; This blend was later the basis for the MST's emergence.

Both messianism and ''cangaço ''disappeared in the late 1930s, but in the 1940s and '50s, additional peasant resistance broke out to evictions and [[land grabbing]] by powerful ranchers:
*[[Teófilo Otoni]], [[Minas Gerais]], in 1948
*[[Porecatu]], [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]], in 1951
*Southwest Paraná, in 1957
*[[Trombas]] and [[Goiás]], 1952–1958&lt;ref&gt;Anthony L. Hall, ''Developing Amazonia: deforestation and social conflict in Brazil's Carajás Programme''. Manchester University Press: 1991, {{ISBN|978-0-7190-3550-0}}, pages 188/189&lt;/ref&gt; 
These local affairs, however, were repressed or settled locally and did not give rise to an ideology. Policy makers and scholars across the political spectrum believed that it was, objectively, an economic necessity to permit the end of Brazilian rural society through mechanized [[agrobusiness]] and forcible [[urbanization]]. The left in particular felt that the technologically backward, feudal ''[[latifundia]]'' impeded both economic modernization and democratization.&lt;ref&gt;José Carlos Reis, ''As identidades do Brasil: de Varnhagen a FHC''. Rio de Janeiro: FGV, 2007, {{ISBN|978-85-225-0596-8}}, V.1, page 164&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s various groups attempted land reform through the legal system, beginning with the [[peasant leagues (Brazil)|peasant leagues]] (''Ligas Camponesas'') in northeastern Brazil,&lt;ref&gt;Sam Moyo &amp; Paris Yeros, eds., ''Reclaiming the land: the resurgence of rural movements in Africa, Asia, and Latin America''. London, Zed Books, {{ISBN|1-84277-425-5}}, page 342&lt;/ref&gt; which opposed eviction of [[tenant farmers]] land and the transformation of [[plantation]]s into [[cattle ranch]]es.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald H. Chilcote, ed. - ''Protest and resistance in Angola and Brazil: comparative studies''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1972, {{ISBN|0-520-01878-8}}, page 191&lt;/ref&gt; These groups questioned the existing distribution of land ownership through a rational appeal to the social function of property.{{what|date=July 2017}} 

Despite the efforts of these groups, land ownership continued to concentrate, and both at the time of MST's founding and in the present day Brazil has had a highly dynamic and robust agricultural business sector that came, say some,{{who|date=August 2017}} at the price of extensive dislocation of the rural poor.&lt;ref&gt;James F. Petras, Henry Veltmeyer, ''Cardoso's Brazil: a land for sale''. Lanham, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2003, {{ISBN|0-7425-2631-3}}, page 17&lt;/ref&gt; MST questioned the scope of the benefits from the alleged efficiency of the change, given that since 1850 Brazilian land development had been concerned with the interests of a single class – the rural bourgeoisie.&lt;ref&gt;Luiz Bezerra Neto, ''Sem-terra aprende e ensina: estudo sobre as práticas educativas do Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais''. Campinas, SP: Autores Associados, 1999, {{ISBN|85-85701-82-X}}, page 30&lt;/ref&gt; While the MST frames its policies in socio-economic terms, it still points to Canudos and its alleged millenarism&lt;ref&gt;Robert M. Levine, ''Vale of tears: revisiting the Canudos massacre in northeastern Brazil, 1893–1897''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1995, {{ISBN|0-520-20343-7}}, page 65&lt;/ref&gt; to legitimize its existence&lt;ref&gt;Angela Maria de Castro Gomes et al., ''A República no Brasil''. Rio de Janeiro: Nova Fronteira, 2002, {{ISBN|978-85-209-1264-5}}, page 118&lt;/ref&gt; and to develop a powerful mystique of its own.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Reitan, ''Global Activism''. Abingdon: Routledge, 2007, {{ISBN|0-203-96605-8}}, page 154&lt;/ref&gt;

A great deal of the early organizing in the MST came from Catholic communities.&lt;ref&gt;Edward L. Cleary, ''How Latin America Saved the Soul of the Catholic Church''. Mahwah, NJ, Paulist Press, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-8091-4629-1}}, page 32; Angus Lindsay Wright &amp; Wendy Wolford, ''To inherit the earth: the landless movement and the struggle for a new Brazil''. Oakland, Food First Books, 2003, {{ISBN|0-935028-90-0}}, page 74&lt;/ref&gt; Much of MST ideology and practice come from a social doctrine of the [[Catholic Church]]: that private property should serve a social function.&lt;ref&gt;Petras &amp; Veltmeyer, ''Cardoso's Brazil'', 18&lt;/ref&gt; This principle developed during the 19th century&lt;ref&gt;Sándor Agócs, ''The troubled origins of the Italian Catholic labor movement, 1878–1914''. Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1988, {{ISBN|0-8143-1938-6}}, page 25; Scott Mainwaring, ''The Catholic Church and politics in Brazil, 1916–1985''. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1986, page 55&lt;/ref&gt; and became Catholic doctrine with [[Pope Leo XIII]]'s ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' encyclical,&lt;ref&gt;Charles C. Geisler &amp; Gail Daneker, eds. ''Property and values: alternatives to public and private ownership''. Washington DC: Island Press, 2000, {{ISBN|1-55963-766-8}}, page 31&lt;/ref&gt; promulgated on the eve of the 1964 military coup. This doctrine was evoked by President [[João Goulart]] at a rally in Rio de Janeiro, at which he offered a blueprint for political and social reforms and proposed [[expropriation]] of estates larger than 600 hectares in areas near federal facilities such as roads, railroads, reservoirs and sanitation works; these ideas triggered a strong conservative backlash and led to Goulart's loss of power.&lt;ref&gt;Marieta de Moraes Ferreira, ed., ''João Goulart: entre a memória e a história'', Rio de Janeiro: FGV , 2006, {{ISBN|85-225-0578-0}} , page 74&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless the Brazilian Catholic hierarchy formally acknowledged the principle in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;the National Conference of Brazilian Bishops (CNBB) issued a document - ''Church and Land Problems'' - recognizing and pleading for public acknowledgement of communal rights to the land.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;José de Souza Martins, '' Reforma agrária: o impossível diálogo''. São Paulo: EDUSP, 2004, {{ISBN|85-314-0591-2}}, page 104&lt;/ref&gt;

In Brazilian constitutional history, land reform – understood in terms of public management of natural resources&lt;ref&gt;Albert Breton, ed., ''Environmental governance and decentralisation''. Cheltenham, UK: Edward Elgar, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-84720-398-4}}, page 52&lt;/ref&gt; – was first explicitly mentioned as a guiding principle of government in the [[History_of_the_Constitution_of_Brazil#Sixth_Constitution_.281967.29|1967 constitution]],&lt;ref&gt;(Article 157, III)&lt;/ref&gt; which sought to institutionalize an [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] consensus after the 1964 coup. The military dictatorship intended to use land reform policy to develop a buffer of conservative small farmers between ''latifundia'' owners and the rural proletariat.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Rosset, Raj Patel, Michael Courville, Land Research Action Network, eds. ''Promised land: competing visions of agrarian reform''. New York: Food First Books, {{ISBN|978-0-935028-28-7}}, page 266&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, at the most repressive point of the dictatorship, the 1967 constitution was amended by a decree (''ato institucional'') by a junta that held interim power during the final illness of president [[Arthur da Costa e Silva]], authorizing government compensation for property expropriated for land reform. This compensation would be made in [[government bonds]] rather than cash, previously the only legal practice (Art. 157, §1, as amended by Institutional Act No. 9, 1969).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/constituicao/constituicao67.htm For the text of the 1967 Constitution, see]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Land reform and the 1988 constitution==
The constitution now in effect, passed in 1988, requires that "property shall serve its social function"&lt;ref&gt;(Article 5, XXIII.)&lt;/ref&gt; and that the government should "expropriate for the purpose of [[agrarian society|agrarian reform]], rural property that is not performing its social function."&lt;ref&gt;(Article 184)&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Article 186 of the constitution, a social function is performed when rural property simultaneously meets the following requirements:
* Rational and adequate use.
* Adequate use of available [[natural resources]] and preservation of the environment.
* Compliance with the provisions which regulate [[labor relations]].
* Development uses which favor the well-being of owners and workers.

Since the criteria are vague and not objectively defined, the social interest principle was seen as a mixed blessing,{{who|date=July 2017}} but accepted in general. Landowners have lobbied against the principle since 1985 through the landowners' organization, [[União Democrática Ruralista]] (Democratic Union of Rural People, or UDR), whose rise and organization parallels that of the MST.

One Brazilian law handbook argues that land reform, as understood in the 1988 constitution, is a concept made up of various "compromises" on which constitutional law has consistently evaded taking a clear stance, and so one could argue either for or against the MST without leaving the framework of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Felipe Dutra Asensi, ''Curso Prático de Argumentação Jurídica'', Rio de Janeiro: Elsevier, 2010, Google Books, partially available at [https://books.google.com/books?id=hREGAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT1]&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of clear government commitment to land reform precludes the MST engaging in [[public-interest litigation]],&lt;ref&gt;Boaventura de Sousa Santos,César A.

The smashing of the [[peasant leagues (Brazil)|peasant leagues]] following the [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état|1964 coup]] opened the way for commercialized agriculture and concentration of land ownership throughout the period of the [[Brazilian military government|military dictatorship]], and an absolute decline in the rural population during the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas William Merrick, Elza Berquó, National Research Council (U.S.).

Washington D.C.: National Academic Press, 1983, page 133&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1980s, out of 370 million hectares of farm land total, 285 million hectares (77%) were held by [[latifundia]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee J. Alston, Gary D. Libecap, Bernardo Mueller, ''Titles, conflict, and land use: the development of property rights and land reform on the Brazilian Amazonian Frontier''. University of Michigan Press, 1999, {{ISBN|0-472-11006-3}}, pages 67/68&lt;/ref&gt; The re-democratization process in the 1980s, however, allowed grassroots movements to pursue their own interests&lt;ref&gt;Biorn Maybury-Lewis, ''The politics of the possible: the Brazilian rural workers' trade union movement, 1964–1985''. Philadelphia, Temple University Press, 1994, {{ISBN|1-56639-167-9}}, page 169&lt;/ref&gt; rather than those of the state and the ruling classes. The emergence of the MST fits into this framework.

Between late 1980 and early 1981, over 6,000 landless families established an encampment on land located between three unproductive estates in Brazil's southernmost state of [[Rio Grande do Sul]]. These families included 600 households expropriated and dislocated in 1974 from nearby {{ILL|Passo Real|pt|Usina Hidrelétrica Passo Real}} to make way for construction of a [[hydroelectric]] dam.&lt;ref&gt;Local mobilization of peasants dislocated by dam constructions was one of the primary sources of grassroots rural mobilization in the 1980s in southern Brazil, which gave rise to a national organization, the ''Movimento dos Atingidos por Barragens'' (MAB), or "Dam-slighted people's Movement"; cf. Franklin Daniel Rothman and Pamela E. Oliver, "From Local to Global: The Anti-Dam Movement in Southern Brazil". ''Mobilization: An International Journal'', 1999, 4(1), available at [http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~oliver/PROTESTS/ArticleCopies/RothmanOliver1999MobyFromLocaltoGlobal.pdf]. Accessed 16 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This first group was later joined by an additional 300 (or, according to other sources, over 1,000) households evicted by [[FUNAI]]{{who|date=July 2017}} from the [[Kaingang]] Indian reservation in Nonoai, where they had been renting plots since 1968.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cesnur.org/2001/london2001/alcantara.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Local mobilization of the Passo Real and Nonoai people had already achieved some land distribution on non-Indian land, followed by demobilization. Those who had not received land under these claims, joined by others, and led by leaders from the existing regional movement, MASTER (Rio Grande do Sul landless farmers' movement), made up the 1980/1981 encampment.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Duquette and others, ''Collective action and radicalism in Brazil: women, urban housing, and rural movements''. University of Toronto Press, 2005, {{ISBN|0-8020-3907-3}}, pages 140/141&lt;/ref&gt; The location became known as the Encruzilhada Natalino. With the support of civil society, including the progressive branch of the [[Catholic Church]], the families resisted a blockade imposed by military force. Enforcement of the blockade was entrusted by the government to Army colonel {{ILL|Sebastião Curió|pt}}, already notorious for his past counter-insurgency efforts against the [[Araguaia guerrilla]]s.

Curió enforced the blockade ruthlessly,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mst.org.br/revista/49/destaque |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719014944/http://mst.org.br/revista/49/destaque |archivedate=2013-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; most of the landless refused his offer of resettlement on the Amazonian frontier, and eventually pressured the military government into expropriating nearby lands for agrarian reform.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel A.

Pennsylvania State University, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-271-03353-2}}, pages 67/69&lt;/ref&gt; The Encruzilhada Natalino episode set a pattern. Most of subsequent early development of the MST concerned exactly the areas of southern Brazil where, in the absence of an open frontier, an ideological appeal at an alternate foundation for access to the land  - other than formal private property - was developed in response to the growing difficulties [[agribusiness]] posed for family farming.&lt;ref&gt;Hank Johnston, Paul Almeida, eds.: ''Latin American social movements: globalization, democratization, and Transnational Networks''. Lanham, MA: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-7425-5332-3}}, Chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt; The MST also developed what became its chief ''modus operandi'': local organizing around the concrete struggles of a specific demographic group.&lt;ref&gt;Magda Zanoni, Hugues Lamarche, eds. ''Agriculture et ruralité au Bréil: un autre modèle de developpement'', Paris: Khartala, 2001, {{ISBN|2-84586-173-7}}, page 113&lt;/ref&gt;

The MST was officially founded in January 1984, during a National Encounter of landless workers in [[Cascavel]], Paraná,&lt;ref&gt;Marlene Grade &amp; Idaleto Malvezzi Aued, "A busca de uma nova forma do agir humano: o MST e seu ato teleológico", Paper presented at the XIth. Congress of Sociedade Brasileira de Economia Política, Vitória, 2006; published at ''Textos e Debates'' (UFRR), Federal University of Roraima, Boa Vista-RR, v. I, p. 16-35, 2005..&lt;/ref&gt; as Brazil's [[military dictatorship]] drew to a close. Its founding was strongly connected to Catholic-based organizations such as the [[Pastoral Land Commission]], which provided support and infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;Mauricio Augusto Font, ''Transforming Brazil: a reform era in perspective''. Lanham, Ma: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2003, {{ISBN|0-8476-8355-9}}, page 94&lt;/ref&gt;

During much of the 1980s, the MST faced political competition from the National Confederacy of Agrarian Workers' (CONTAG), heir to the peasant leagues of the 1960s, who sought land reform strictly through legal means, by favoring [[trade union]]ism and striving to wrestle concessions from bosses for rural workers. But the more aggressive tactics of the MST in striving for access to land gave a political legitimacy that soon outshone CONTAG, which limited itself to tradeunionism in the strictest sense, acting until today as a rural branch of the [[Central Única dos Trabalhadores]] (CUT).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. The description offered by the Trotskyist review ''International Viewpoint'', in the article by João Machado, "The two souls of the Lula government", March 2003 issue (IV348), available at [http://www.internationalviewpoint.org/spip.php?article246]&lt;/ref&gt; MST eventually all but monopolized political attention as a spokesman for rural workers.&lt;ref&gt;Mauricio Augusto Font, ''Transforming Brazil'', 89&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1980s on, the MST hasn't had a monopoly of land occupations, many of which are carried out by a host of grassroots organizations (dissidents from the MST, trade unions, informal coalitions of land workers); however, the MST is by far the most organized group dealing in occupations, and has political leverage enough to turn occupation into formal expropriation for public purposes. In 1995, only 89 of 198 occupations (45%) were organized by the MST, but these included 20,500 (65%) out of the grand total of 31,400 families involved.&lt;ref&gt;Lee J. Alston, Gary D. Libecap, Bernardo Mueller, ''Titles, conflict, and land use'', pages 61/62&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizational structure==
The MST is organized entirely, from the grassroots level up to the state and national coordinating bodies, into collective units that make decisions through discussion, reflection and consensus. This non-hierarchical pattern of organization, reflecting liberation theology and [[Paulo_Freire|Freirean pedagogy]], also avoids distinct leadership that can be bought off or assassinated.&lt;ref name="Democracy"&gt;{{cite book |title= Democracy, States, and the Struggle for Global Justice|last= Gautney|first= Heather|authorlink= |author2=Omar Dahbour |author3=Ashley Dawson |author4=Neil Smith  |year= 2009|publisher= Routledge Cavendish|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0-415-98983-3|page= |pages= 244–245|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic organizational unit, 10 to 15 families living in an MST encampment settlement,&lt;ref&gt;"encampment" is for a non-legally recognized occupation, "settlement" for one already recognized&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Girardet, ed.''Surviving the century: facing climate chaos and other global challenges''. London: Earthscan, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-84407-458-7}}, page 186&lt;/ref&gt; is known as a ''nucleo de base''. A ''nucleo de base'' addresses the issues faced by member families, and members elect two representatives, one woman and one man, to represent them at settlement/encampment meetings. These representatives attend regional meetings, and elect regional representatives who then elect the members of the state coordinating body of the MST, a total of 400 members of state bodies -- around 20 per state -- and 60 members of the national coordinating body, around 2 per state. Every MST family participates in a ''nucleo de base'', roughly 475,000 families, or 1.5 million people. João Pedro Stédile, economist and author of texts on land reform in Brazil, is a member of the MST's national coordinating body.

The MST is not a political party and has no formal leadership other than a dispersed group of some 15 leaders, whose public appearances are scarce. This secrecy minimizes the risk of arrest&lt;ref&gt;Lee J. Alston, Gary D. Libecap, Bernardo Mueller, ''Titles, conflict, and land use: the development of property rights and land reform on the Brazilian Amazon frontier ''. The University of Michigan Press, 1999, {{ISBN|0-472-11006-3}}, page 63&lt;/ref&gt; and also for preserving a grassroots, decentralized organizational model. This is regarded as an important strategy by the MST, in that it allows the movement to maintain an ongoing and direct flow of communication between member-families and their representatives. Coordinators are aware of the realities faced by member-families and are encouraged to discuss important issues with said families. This organizational blueprint seeks, in a way to empower people politically by having them acting "in the way they see fit, true to local context".&lt;ref&gt;Anil Hira, Trevor W. Parfitt, ''Development projects for a new millennium''. Westport, CT: Praeger Publishers, 2004, {{ISBN|0-275-97502-9}}, page 25&lt;/ref&gt; To assist with communication between Coordinators and member-families, and as an attempt to democratize the media, the MST produces the ''Jornal Sem Terra'' and the ''MST Informa''.

The structure and goals of the MST has led some authors to consider it a large [[Libertarian socialism|libertarian socialist]], or [[Anarchism|anarchist]] organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anarchy Works|last=Gelderloos|first=Peter|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==
The MST is an ideologically eclectic rural movement of hundreds of thousands of landless peasants (and some who live in small cities) striving for land reform in Brazil. The MST has been inspired since its inception by [[liberation theology]], [[Marxism]], the [[Cuban Revolution]], and other [[leftist]] ideologies. The flexible mix of discourse that includes "marxist concepts, popular religion, communal practices, citizenship principles and radical democracy", has increased the movement's popular appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Magda Zanoni, Hugues Lamarche,eds. ''Agriculture et ruralité au Brésil: un autre modèle de développement''. Paris: Karthala,2001, {{ISBN|2-84586-173-7}}, page 114&lt;/ref&gt;

The landless say they have found institutional support in the Catholic Church's teachings of [[social justice]] and equality, as embodied in the activities of Catholic Base Committees (''Comissões Eclesiais de Base'', or CEBs) which generally advocate [[liberation theology]] and anti-hierarchical social relations. This theology, a radicalized re-reading of the existing social doctrine of the Church, became the basis of the MST's ideology and organizational structure.&lt;ref name="Democracy"/&gt; The loss of influence of progressives in the later Catholic Church{{when|date=July 2017}}, however, has reduced the closeness of the relationship between the MST and the Church as such.&lt;ref&gt;John Burdick, ''Legacies of liberation: the progressive Catholic Church in Brazil at the start of a new millennium''. Ashgate, The University of Virginia Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-7546-1550-7}}, page 101; Lícia Soares de Souza, ''Utopies américaines au Québec et au Brésil''. Québec, Presses de L'Université Laval, 2004, {{ISBN|2-7637-8075-X}}, page 120&lt;/ref&gt;

MST's anti-hierarchical stance stems from the influence of [[Paulo Freire]]. After working with poor communities in the rural Brazilian state of [[Pernambuco]], Freire observed that aspects of traditional classrooms, such as teachers with more power than students, hindered the potential for success of adults in adult literacy programs. He determined that the students' individual abilities to learn and absorb information were severely impeded by their passive role in the classroom. His teachings encouraged activists to break their passive dependence on oppressive social conditions and become engaged in active modes of behaving and living. In the mid-1980s the MST created a new infrastructure for the movement, directly guided by liberation theology and Freirian pedagogy. They did not elect leaders so as to not create hierarchies, and to prevent corrupt leadership from developing.&lt;ref name="Democracy" /&gt;

The MST has widened the scope of their movement. They have invaded the headquarters of public and multinational institutions, and begun to resist the appearance of fields of [[genetically modified crops]], carrying out marches, [[hunger strike]]s and other political actions. The MST cooperates with a number of rural worker movements and urban movements in other areas of Brazil{{where|date=July 2017}}. The MST also remains in touch with broader international organizations and movements that support and embrace the same cause.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Feinberg,Carlos H. Waisman,Leon Zamosc, eds., ''Civil Society and Democracy in Latin America''. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2006, {{ISBN|1-4039-7228-1}} , pages 156/157&lt;/ref&gt; The MST includes not only landless workers ''stricto sensu'', or rural workers recently evicted from the land, but also the urban jobless and homeless people who want to make a living by working on the land; thus its affinity with housing reform and other urban movements.&lt;ref&gt;Magda Zanoni &amp; Hugues Lamarche, eds. ''Agriculture et ruralité au Brésil'', page 165&lt;/ref&gt; The squatters' movement MTST (''Movimento dos Trabalhadores Sem teto'' - [[Homeless Workers' Movement]]) is commonly seem as an offshoot of the MST.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Selwyn, ''The Global Development Crisis''. Cambridge, UK: Polity Press, {{ISBN|978-0-7456-6014-1}} , page 198&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
According to the MST, it taught over 50,000 landless workers to read and write between 2002 and 2005. It also runs the Popular University of Social Movements (PUSM)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universidadepopular.org/pages/en/the-project.php See homepage, English version]&lt;/ref&gt; at a campus in [[Guararema]], [[São Paulo]]. Also called Florestan Fernandes School (FFS), after [[Marxist]] scholar [[Florestan Fernandes]], the school offers secondary school classes in a variety of fields; its first graduating class (2005) of 53 students received degrees in Specialized Rural Education and Development. With the [[University of Brasília]], the government of Venezuela and Via Campesina, as well as agreements with federal, state and community colleges, it offers classes in [[pedagogy]], history, and [[agronomy]], and technical subjects at different skill levels.&lt;ref&gt;See managing NGO's Association of Friends of the Florestan Fernandes School site, [http://www.amigosenff.org.br/pt-BR/a-escola/formacao].

It trains primary-school teachers in most states of Brazil, and partners with international agencies such as [[UNESCO]], [[UNICEF]] and the Catholic Church. Seven institutions of higher education in different regions provide degree courses in education for MST teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Rocha and Sue Branford.

The role of the MST as a grassroots organization running [[charter schools]] activity has attracted considerable attention from the Brazilian press, much of it accusatory.

This was just one episode in a long history of mutual very bitter animosity between ''Veja'' and the MST. In 1993, the magazine described the MST as "a peasant organization of [[leninism|Leninist]] character" and charged its leaders and activists with pretending to be homeless.&lt;ref&gt;''Veja'', issue 1,286, 6 May 1993&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2009 the magazine opposed public support for the "criminal" activities of the movement&lt;ref&gt;''Governo paga ações criminosas do MST'', ''Veja'' site, 28th.

Overall the relationship of the mainstream media with the MST has been ambiguous: in the 1990s they tended to support land reform as a goal in general, and presented MST in a sympathetic light. For example, between 1996 and 1997 [[TV Globo]] broadcast a ''[[telenovela]]'' ''[[O Rei do Gado]]'' (The Cattle Baron), in which a beautiful female ''sem terra'' played by actress [[Patricia Pillar]] falls in love with a male landowner.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Healy and Stephen Muecke, eds., ''Cultural Studies Review: Homefronts''. The University of Melbourne: V.15, no.1, March 2009, page 158&lt;/ref&gt; In the same ''telenovela'', a [[wake (ceremony)|wake]] for the fictitious Senator Caxias, killed while defending an MST occupation, offered the opportunity for two real-life senators from the PT, [[Eduardo Suplicy]] and [[Benedita da Silva]], to make [[cameo appearances]] as themselves praising their fictive colleague's agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Kristina Riegert, ed., ''Politicotainment: television's take on the real''. New York: Peter Lang Publishing, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-8204-8114-2}}, page 165&lt;/ref&gt; 

The media however tend to disavow what they see as violent methods,&lt;ref&gt;John L. Hammond, "The MST and the Media: Competing Images of the Brazilian Farmworkers' Movement" . ''Latin American Politics &amp; Society'' - Volume 46, Number 4, Winter 2004, pp.&amp;nbsp;61–90&lt;/ref&gt; especially as the movement gathered strength.&lt;ref&gt;Luciana Oliveira, ''Fighting for a Voice: Support for Land Reform Versus the Landless Workers Movement: A Framing Analysis of the Brazilian Press''.

==Sustainable agriculture==
The increased importance of the technicians and experts within the MST has led some sections of the movement to strive to develop and diffuse technology suitable for a model of [[sustainable agriculture]] on the land the families farm.&lt;ref&gt;Ana Delgado Alemán, "Towards Inclusive Environmental Governance: a Study of the Expert-Lay Interplay in a Brazilian Social Movement". Doctoral Thesis, the University of Bergen, 2009, available at [https://bora.uib.no/handle/1956/3838]. Accessed November the 16th. 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Such self-developed technology is seen as a way to turn small producers from consumers into producers of technologies,&lt;ref&gt;Michel P.

Kassel University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|978-3-89958-245-1}}, page 19&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts are gaining in importance as more movement families gain access to the land. For example, the Chico Mendes Center for Agroecology, founded May 15, 2004 in [[Ponta Grossa]], [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]], Brazil on land formerly used by the [[Monsanto Company]] to grow [[genetically modified organisms|genetically modified]] crops, intends to produce [[organic farming|organic]], native [[seed]] to distribute through MST.

New York: Nova Science Publishers, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-60021-421-9}}, page 218&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the MST partnered with the federal government of [[Venezuela]], and the state government of Paraná, the [[Federal University of Paraná]] (UFPR), and the [[Via Campesina|International Via Campesina]], an organization that brings together movements involved in the struggle for land from all over the world, to establish the Latin American School of Agroecology. The school, located in an MST agrarian reform project known as the Contestado settlement, signed a protocol of intentions in January{{when|date=July 2017}} during the fifth [[World Social Forum]].&lt;ref&gt;Ian Scoones, "Mobilizing Against GM Crops in India, South Africa and Brazil".

==Violent confrontations: the Cardoso years==
In the long history of violent land conflicts in Brazil, the emergence of the MST and its consolidation into the most prominent land reform movement in Brazil during the 1990s led to what has been called a first "wave" of MST-led occupations (1995–1999),&lt;ref&gt;According to MST-friendly [[UNESP]] professor Bernardo Mançano, interview to Giovana Girardi, available at {{cite web |url=http://www.unesp.br/aci_ses/revista_unespciencia/acervo/16/perfil |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001165107/http://www.unesp.br/aci_ses/revista_unespciencia/acervo/16/perfil |archivedate=2011-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and with it the movement's involvement in various bloody clashes and ensuing conflicting claims, where government authorities, landowners and the MST charge one other with responsibility for the deaths, maimings and property damages caused by the violence.

In a notorious 1996 incident usually called the [[Eldorado de Carajás massacre]], 19 MST members were gunned down and another 69 wounded by police as they blocked a state road in [[Pará]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/brasil/ult96u551569.shtml |title=Folha Online - Brasil - Ocupações do MST lembram 13 anos do massacre de Eldorado dos Carajás (PA) - 17/04/2009 |publisher=.folha.uol.com.br |date=2009-04-17 |accessdate=2012-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 alone, similar confrontations with police and landowners' security details accounted for two dozen internationally acknowledged deaths.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert M. Levine]], ''The History of Brazil''. New York: Palgrave- Mcmillan, 2003, {{ISBN|1-4039-6255-3}}, page 164&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the MST occupied the family business farm of then-president [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nadir.org/nadir/initiativ/agp/free/imf/brasil/mst/2002/0324mst_action.html |title=www.agp.org &amp;#124; arquivos dos protestos globais: MST action in Brazilian president's farm &amp;#124; 23/2/2002 |publisher=Nadir.org |accessdate=2012-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Minas Gerais]], a move publicly condemned by Lula, then leader of the leftist opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; |url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/brasil/ult96u31238.shtml |title=Folha Online - Brasil - MST deve seguir lei, diz Lula - 11/04/2002 |publisher=.folha.uol.com.br |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2012-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other prominent members of the PT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/brasil/ult96u31194.shtml |title=Folha Online - Brasil - Entre petistas, maioria é contra ação de sem-terra - 10/04/2002 |publisher=.folha.uol.com.br |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2012-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/brasil/ult96u30653.shtml |title=Folha Online - Brasil - Ato do MST foi "irresponsável", diz Genoino - 27/03/2002 |publisher=.folha.uol.com.br |date=2002-03-27 |accessdate=2012-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The farm was damaged and looted in the occupation, including the destruction of a [[combine harvester]], a tractor and several pieces of furniture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/brasil/ult96u30607.shtml |title=Folha Online - Brasil - Administrador da fazenda de FHC avalia prejuízo em R$ 100 mil - 26/03/2002 |publisher=.folha.uol.com.br |date=2002-03-26 |accessdate=2012-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; MST members also drank the entire stock of alcoholic beverages at the farm. In all, 16 MST leaders were later charged with theft, vandalism, trespassing, resisting arrest and for holding others in captivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/brasil/ult96u30559.shtml |title=Folha Online - Brasil - Líderes do MST serão julgados por violação de domicílio e furto - 25/03/2002 |publisher=.folha.uol.com.br |date=2002-03-25 |accessdate=2012-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, two police officers working undercover on an investigation of cargo truck robberies near an MST homestead&lt;!-- check, this said "stead"--&gt; in Pernambuco were attacked by criminals. One was shot dead and the other tortured, amid suspicions of MST involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/brasil/ult96u67074.shtml |title=Folha Online - Brasil - Um policial é morto e outro é torturado em área do MST - 08/02/2005 |publisher=.folha.uol.com.br |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2012-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the early 2000s the MST began to occupy functioning facilities owned by large corporations whose activities it considered at odds with the social function of property. On March 8, 2005, the MST invaded a [[Nursery (horticulture)|nursery]] and a research center in [[Barra do Ribeiro]], 56&amp;nbsp;km from Porto Alegre, both owned by [[Aracruz Celulose]]. The MST members held local guards captive while they ripped plants from the ground. MST president João Pedro Stédile commented that MST should oppose not only landowners but also agrobusiness, "the project of organization of agriculture by transnational capital allied to capitalist farming" -- a model he deems socially backwards and environmentally harmful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.direitos.org.br/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3561&amp;Itemid=2 |title=Direitos Humanos - Palestra de João Pedro Stédile no 5º Congresso do MST |publisher=Direitos.org.br |accessdate=2012-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of an anonymous activist: "our struggle is not only to win the land&amp;nbsp;... we are building a new way of life".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Jeff Noonan, ''Democratic society and human needs'', Mc Gill -Queen's University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-7735-3120-3}}, page 244&lt;/ref&gt; The shift had been developing since the movement's 2000 national congress, which concerned itself chiefly with the perceived threat of transnational corporations whether Brazilian or foreign to both small property in general and to Brazilian national [[food sovereignty]],&lt;ref&gt;Nik Heynen,ed. ''Neoliberal environments: false promises and unnatural consequences'', Abingdon (UK), Routledge, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-415-77149-8}}, page 249&lt;/ref&gt; especially in the area of [[intellectual property]].&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Reitan, ''Global activism''. Abingdon: Routledge, 2007, {{ISBN|0-203-96605-8}}, page 155&lt;/ref&gt; This principle that led to the July 2000 attack on a ship in [[Recife]] loaded with GM [[maize]] from [[Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;Ian Scoones, ''Mobilizing Against GM Crops in India, South Africa and Brazil''&lt;/ref&gt; And indeed, from 2000 on, much of the movement's activism consisted in symbolic acts directed against multinational corporations as "a symbol of the intervention politics of the big monopolies operating in Brazil".&lt;ref&gt;Jagdish N. Bhagwati, ''In defense of globalization''. Oxford University Press, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-19-533093-9}}, page 23 - quoting MST activist on [[International Women's Day]] 2001, protesting before a [[McDonald's]] restaurant in Porto Alegre.&lt;/ref&gt;

The change in strategy could also have corresponded to a perceived shift in government stance since in the late 1990s and early 2000s spokespersons for the Cardoso government declared that Brazil "had no need" for land reform, that small farms were not competitive, and were unlikely to increasee personal [[income]]s in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;William C. Smith, ed. ''Latin American democratic transformations: institutions, actors, and processes''.Malden, MA: Blackwell-Wiley, 2009, {{ISBN|978-1-4051-9758-8}}, page 259&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore they were a foolhardy alternative to policies emphasizing creation of skilled wage-labor positions, since expanding general employment levels would eventually cause the land reform issue to "recede" into the background.&lt;ref&gt;An stance endorsed by former US ambassador to Brazil [[Lincoln Gordon]], known for his support for the 1964 Brazilian coup d'état: Lincoln Gordon, ''Brazil's second chance: en route toward the first world''. Washington D.C.: Brookings Institution, 2001, {{ISBN|0-8157-0032-6}}, page 129&lt;/ref&gt; The MST's actions were denounced by Cardoso as aiming for a return to an archaic agrarian past, and therefore in conflict with "modernity": "one of the enabling myths of the [[neoliberal]] discourse".&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Walker Gogol, ''The concept of Other in Latin American liberation: fusing emancipatory philosophic thought and social revolt''. Lanham, MA, Lexington Books, 2002, {{ISBN|0-7391-0330-X}}, page 318&lt;/ref&gt;

Cardoso offered lip service to agrarian reform in general, but also described the movement as "a threat to democracy".&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Keen, Keith Haynes: ''A History of Latin America: Independence to the Present''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-618-78321-2}}, Volume 2, page 526&lt;/ref&gt; He compared the MST's demands for subsidized credit, which led to the 1998 occupation of various banks in [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]], to someone "who enters a bank as a robber".&lt;ref&gt;''Veja'', 3 June 1998, reproduced in ''Veja'' digital archive text, "Os 25 anos do MST: invasões, badernas e desafios a lei" [25 years of the MST: invasions, disorder and contempt for the law], 23rd. January 2009, available at {{cite web |url=http://veja.abril.com.br/noticia/brasil/25-anos-mst-invasoes-badernas-desafio-lei?print=1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014181249/http://veja.abril.com.br/noticia/brasil/25-anos-mst-invasoes-badernas-desafio-lei?print=1 |archivedate=2012-10-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a memoir written after he left office, Cardoso expressed sympathy for land reform, stating that "were I not President, I would probably be out marching with them", but also saying that "the image of mobs [sic] taking over privately-owned farms would chase away investment, both local and foreign".&lt;ref&gt;Fernando Henrique Cardoso (with Brian Winter), ''The accidental President of Brazil: a memoir''.New York: Publicaffairs, 2006, {{ISBN|978-1-58648-324-1}}, page 210&lt;/ref&gt; Cardoso himself however never branded the MST as terrorist, a step taken by his Minister of Agricultural Development, who even hypothesized about an invasion of [[Argentine]] from the north by the movement as a way to blackmail the Brazilian government into action.&lt;ref&gt;Jorge I. Domínguez, Anthony Jones, eds.: ''The Construction of Democracy: Lessons from Practice and Research''. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-8018-8595-2}}, page 157&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1997, Cardoso' Chief of Military Household (''Chefe da Casa Militar'', i.a. a general comptroller over all issues regarding the military and police forces as armed civil servants) expressed concern about participation of MST activists in the then-ongoing police officers' strikes, as part of a supposed plot to "destabilize" the military.&lt;ref&gt;João R. Martins Filho &amp; Daniel Zirker, "The Brazilian Armed Forces After the Cold War: Overcoming the Identity Crisis".

As far as concrete measures were concerned, Cardoso's stance towards land reform was divided: at the same time it took steps to accelerate public acquisitions of land for settlement and increased taxes on unused land, it also forbade public inspection of invaded land - thereby precluding future expropriation - and the disbursement of public funds to people involved in such invasions.&lt;ref&gt;A. Haroon Akram-Lodhi, Saturnino M. Borras, Cristóbal Kay,eds., ''Land, poverty and livelihoods in an era of globalization: perspectives from developing and transition countries''.Abingdon: Routledge, 2007, {{ISBN|0-203-96225-7}}, pages 87/88&lt;/ref&gt; Cardoso's chief land reform project, supported by a [[World Bank]] US$90 million loan, was addressed to ''individuals'' who had previous experience in farming and a maximum yearly income of US$15,000, and who were granted a loan of up to US$40,000 if they could associate with other rural producers in order to buy land from a willingly landholder&lt;ref&gt;Becky Mansfield, ''Privatization: property and the remaking of nature-society relations''. Malden, MA: Blackwell, 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-4051-7550-0}}, page 166&lt;/ref&gt; - a land reform programme that catered primarily for substantial small farmers, as opposed to the MST's traditional constituency, the rural poor. Cardoso's project, ''Cédula da Terra'' ("landcard") actually offered also previously landless people the opportunity to buy land - but then, only after a ''negotiated'' process in which land would be bought directly from landowners.&lt;ref&gt;Hans P. Binswanger-Mkhize, Camille Bourguignon, Rogerius Johannes Eugenius van den Brink, eds.: ''Agricultural Land Redistribution: Toward Greater Consensus''. Washington D.C.: The World Bank Publications, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-8213-7962-2}}, pages 295/296&lt;/ref&gt;

In the words of an American scholar, notwithstanding its efforts in actual resettlement, the issue evaded by the Cardoso government was precisely that of contesting the hitherto ruling mode of agricultural development: concentrated, mechanized, latifundia-friendly commodity production - as well as the larger injustices produced by it.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred P. Montero, ''Brazilian politics'', pages 88/89.&lt;/ref&gt; In his own words, what Cardoso could not stomach about the MST was what he saw not as a struggle for land reform, but against the capitalist system as such.&lt;ref&gt;Juan David Lindau, Timothy Cheek, ''Market economics and political change: comparing China and Mexico''. Oxford: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1998, {{ISBN|0-8476-8733-3}}, page 70&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore the fact that Cardoso's administration tried to set on its feet various "alternative", tamer social movements which were supposed to pressure for land reform on purely negotiated terms, such as the Movement of Landless Producers (''Movimento dos Agricultores Sem Terra'', or MAST), organized on a local basis in the São Paulo State, around the trade union central Syndical Social Democracy, or SDS.&lt;ref&gt;Jurandyr Luciano Sanches Ross,ed. ''Geografia do Brasil'',São Paulo: EDUSP, 2005, {{ISBN|85-314-0242-5}}, page 534&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposedly, MST leaders emphasized at the time and since that their practical activity was a response to the existence of a host of destitutes whose prospects of obtaining productive, continuous employment in conventional labor markets was bleak, as admitted even by President Cardoso, who during a 1996 interview, said: "I'm not to say that my government will be of the excluded, for that it cannot be&amp;nbsp;... I don't know how many excluded there will be".&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Peter Spanakos &amp; Cristina Bordin, eds. ''Reforming Brazil''.

London: Verso, 2011, {{ISBN|978-1-84467-798-6}}, preview available at [https://books.google.com/books?id=F1a9X9nr0oAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; - something that in his view should not be held against the working class character of the movement, as a great number of Brazilian rural working class had been "absorbed" into the outer periphery of the urban proletariat.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Mertes, Walden F. Bello, eds., ''A Movement of Movements: Is Another World Really Possible?''. London: 2004, Verso edns., {{ISBN|1-85984-504-5}}, pages 34/35&lt;/ref&gt; Such a view is shared by some academic authors, who argue for the fact that, behind its avowedly "peasant" character, the MST, as far as class politics is concerned, is mostly a ''semi proletarian'' movement, congregating people trying to eke out a living, in the absence of formal wage employment, out of a range of activities across a whole section of the social division of labour.&lt;ref&gt;David Clark, ed., ''The Elgar Companion to Development Studies''. Cheltenham: Edward Elgar, 2006, {{ISBN|978-1-84376-475-5}}, page 332&lt;/ref&gt;

In a certain way, the MST's activities somewhat filled the void left by the decline of the organized labor movement in the wake of Cardoso's neoliberal policies.&lt;ref&gt;William C. Smith,ed. ''Latin American democratic transformations: institutions, actors, and processes''. Malden, MA: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2009, {{ISBN|978-1-4051-9758-8}}, page 258&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore the fact that the movement has taken steps in order to strike alliances with urban based struggles, specially those connected to housing issues.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Janoski, ed., ''A handbook of political sociology: states, civil societies, and globalization''. Cambridge University Press, 2005, {{ISBN|978-0-521-52620-3}}, page 602&lt;/ref&gt; In João Pedro Stedile's words at the time, the concrete struggle for land reform would "unfold" in the countryside, but only to be eventually decided in the city, where "political power for structural change" resides.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas H. Boucher,ed. ''The paradox of change: hunger in a bountiful world''. Food First Books, 1999, {{ISBN|0-935028-71-4}}, page 325&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ideological foundations of MST's later activism===

This supposed opposition to capitalist modernity on the part of the movement&lt;ref&gt;Jagdish N. Bhagwati,''In defense of globalization'', 24, which equates MST activism with the late mediaeval and early modern anti-[[usury]] laws&lt;/ref&gt; has led authors to ascertain that the MST activities express, in a way, the ''decline'' of a traditional peasantry, and its desire of ''restoring'' traditional communal rights.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony W. Pereira, ''The end of the peasantry: the rural labor movement in northeast Brazil''. University of Pittisburgh Press: 1997, {{ISBN|0-8229-3964-9}},page 165&lt;/ref&gt; - which would the difference between the MST and a movement for the ''preservation'' of such communal rights as the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry Veltmeyer, Tom Brass: ''Latin American peasants''. London, Frank Cass, 2003, {{ISBN|0-203-50566-2}}, page 312&lt;/ref&gt;

Others, however, say that, instead of expressing the "decline" of the peasantry, the MST, developing as it was in Brazil, a country where agriculture since colonial times was tied to commodity production, expresses the ''absence'' of a proper peasantry&lt;ref&gt;Joan Martínez Alier, ''Ecologia dei poveri. La Lotta per la giustizia ambientale''. Milan: Jaca Book, 2009, {{ISBN|978-88-16-40840-1}}, page 341&lt;/ref&gt; and has as its social basis a rural working class striving at granting a toehold in the field of capitalist production. As remarked by non-specialist foreign onlookers, the MST's tagging of the landless as "rural workers" - i.e. proletarians in the Marxist sense - appears sometimes more as a purely ideological branding than anything else.&lt;ref&gt;Ana Sofia Ganho, Timothy Michael McGovern, ''Using Portuguese: A Guide to Contemporary Usage''. Cambridge (UK): Cambridge University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-521-79663-6}}, page 17&lt;/ref&gt;

According even to a Leftist scholar like [[James Petras]], the MST is undoubtedly a ''modernizing'' social movement, in that his main goal is to convert fallow states into viable units producing a marketable surplus - "to occupy, resist and ''produce''", as the movement's own motto goes.&lt;ref&gt;James F. Petras, ''The new development politics: the age of empire building and new social movements''. Aldershot: Ashgate Publishing,2003, {{ISBN|0-7546-3540-6}}, page 97&lt;/ref&gt; It is also not a movement with a clear-cut anti-capitalist stance, as what it seeks is to "create a land reform based on small individual property-owners".&lt;ref&gt;David Nugent,&amp; Joan Vincent, eds. ''A companion to the anthropology of politics''. Malden, MA: Blackwel, {{ISBN|0-631-22972-8}}, page 346&lt;/ref&gt; As far as its steads are concerned, the movement has adopted a mostly private enterprise-friendly stance: with the monies it has procured, it has financed mechanization, processing enterprises, livestock breeding, as well as granting access to additional credit sources.&lt;ref&gt;Haro Brookfield, H. C. Brookfield, Helen Parsons, ''Family farms: survival and prospect : a world-wide analysis''. Abingdon: Routledge, 2007, {{ISBN|0-203-93597-7}}, page 169&lt;/ref&gt; Some even see the movement's aims as "quite limited" as in practice it tends to merely provide a chance for some people "to interact with the [ruling] capitalist economy"&lt;ref&gt;Anil Hira, ''An East Asian model for Latin American success: the new path''. Aldershot: Ashgate, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-7546-7108-4}}, page xii&lt;/ref&gt; by means of a kind of "guerrilla capitalism", aimed at ensuring that smaller producers associations carve a share of the market for agrarian produce as against the competition of mammoth agribusiness trusts.&lt;ref&gt;Michel DuQuette, ''Collective Action and Radicalism in Brazil'',145&lt;/ref&gt;

In the view of Marxist authors as Petras and Veltmeyer, such a stance would reflect the incapacity of a heterogeneous coalition of rural people to engage in a broad anti-systemic coalition which would include the urban working classes.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Brass,ed., ''Latin American Peasants''. London: Frank Cass Publishers, 2003, {{ISBN|0-7146-8319-1}}, page 15&lt;/ref&gt; Shunning this Marxist paradigm, other authors see in the rhetoric of the MST the reflection of an ideological struggle, not for taking power, but for ''recognizance'', for "reconstituting the diversity of rural Brazil".&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm K. McNee, "Soundtracking landlessness", IN Idelber Avelar &amp; Christopher Dunn, eds., ''Brazilian Popular Music and Citizenship''. Duke University Press, 2011, page 151&lt;/ref&gt; This struggle for recognizance - despite its being couched in fiery radical rhetoric - is seen by some as "indeed relevant for the democratization of 'rural society', but [it does] not entail political motivations destined to promote ruptures".&lt;ref&gt;Zander Navarro, "'Mobilization without emancipation': the social struggles of the landless in Brazil". IN Boaventura De Sousa Santos, ed., ''Another Production Is Possible: beyond the capitalist canon''. London: Verso, 2006, {{ISBN|978-1-84467-078-9}}, page 156&lt;/ref&gt; In even more blunt terms, a recent academic paper asserts that the ideology of the MST, connected as it is in practice with the landlesss' concrete needs for making out a living in the countryside, is above all an ''edible'' ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Wolford, "Edible Ideology? Survival Strategies in Brazilian Land-Reform Settlements".''Geographical Review'', Vol. 86, No. 3, July 1996, pp.&amp;nbsp;457–461&lt;/ref&gt; A recent German handbook describes the MST as a mere ''pressure group'', unable to exert actual political power.&lt;ref&gt;Markus Porsche-Ludwig,Wolfgang Gieler,Jürgen Bellers, eds., ''Handbuch Sozialpolitiken der Welt''. Münster: LIT Verlag, 2013, {{ISBN|978-3-643-10987-3}} , page 140&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors, however, maintain that the interest of the MST in maximize its members' everyday participation in the running of their own affairs is enough to describe the movement as "socialist" in a broad sense.&lt;ref&gt;[[Steve Ellner]], ed., ''Latin America's Radical Left: Challenges and Complexities of Political Power in the Twenty-first Century'' .

==The Lula government and the 2005 March for Agrarian Reform==

The Lula government was seen by the MST as a leftist and therefore friendly government, so they decided to shun occupations of public buildings in favor of actions directed solely towards private landed states{{what|date=July 2017}}, in a second wave of occupations from 2003 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Bernardo Mançano, interview.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the increasingly conservative positions of the Lula government, including its low profile on land reform,&lt;ref&gt;out of a promised grand total of 430,000 resettled families, Lula had managed to actually settle a mere 60,000 in the first two years of his administration&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred P. Montero, ''Brazilian politics: reforming a democratic state in a changing world''. Cambridge, UK, Polity Press, 2005, {{ISBN|0-7456-3361-7}}, page 139&lt;/ref&gt; actually somewhat less than achieved by Cardoso in his first term&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Hunter, ''The Transformation of the Workers' Party in Brazil, 1989–2009 ''. Cambridge University Press, 2010, {{ISBN|978-0-521-73300-7}}, page 153&lt;/ref&gt;) impelled the movement to change its stance as early as early 2004, when it again began to occupy public buildings and [[Banco do Brasil]] agencies.

In June 2003, the MST occupied the [[R&amp;D]] farm of Monsanto Company in the state of [[Goiás]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2961284.stm |title=Americas &amp;#124; Brazil activists target Monsanto |publisher=BBC News |date=2003-06-03 |accessdate=2012-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 7, 2008, a similar action by women activists at another Monsanto facility at [[Santa Cruz das Palmeiras]], [[São Paulo]], destroyed a nursery and an experimental patch of [[genetically modified maize]], slowing ongoing scientific research. MST said they destroyed the research facility to protest government support for the extensive use of GMOs supplied by transnational corporations in agriculture. In 2003 Lula authorized the sale and use of GM soybeans, which led MST's Stedile to call him a "transgenic politician".&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Monique Robin, ''The World According to Monsanto'', New York, The New Press, 2010, {{ISBN|978-1-59558-426-7}}, page 277.&lt;/ref&gt; The dominance of transnationals over Brazilian seed production was summed by the fact that the Brazilian hybrid seed industry in the early 2000s already was 82% Monsanto-owned,&lt;ref&gt;Saturnino M. Borras, Marc Edelman, Cristóbal Kay, eds.''Transnational agrarian movements confronting globalization'',Malden MA, Blackwell, 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-4051-9041-1}}, page 184&lt;/ref&gt; which the MST saw as detrimental to the development of [[organic agriculture]] in spite of the economic benefits, and enabling possible future health hazards similar to those posed by the intensive use of [[pesticides]],&lt;ref&gt;"Toxins are one of the pillars that sustain the agribusiness production model" - MST report, quoted by Raul Zibechi, "Poisoned in the Fields", ''Counterpunch'', February 3–5, 2012, available at [http://www.counterpunch.org/2012/02/03/poisoned-in-the-fields/].

After a bitter confrontation over the existence of the station (which included easing of previous restrictions by the Lula government to allow Syngenta to continue GMO research), the premises were transferred to the Paraná state government and converted into an agroecology research center.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ekers, Gillian Hart, Stefan Kipfer, Alex Loftus, eds: ''Gramsci: Space, Nature, Politics''.

After an exchange of barbs between Lula and Stedile over what Lula saw as an unnecessary radicalization of the movement's demands,&lt;ref&gt;Peter R. Kingstone, Timothy Joseph Power,eds. ''Democratic Brazil revisited''. University of Pittisburgh Press, 2008, {{ISBN|0-8229-6004-4}}, page 47&lt;/ref&gt; the MST decided to call a huge national demonstration: in May 2005, after a two-week, 200-odd kilometer march from the city of [[Goiânia]], nearly 13,000 landless workers arrived in their nation's capital, [[Brasilia]]. The MST march targeted the U.S. embassy and Brazilian Finance Ministry, rather than President Lula. While thousands of landless carried banners and scythes through the streets, a delegation of 50 held a three-hour meeting with Lula, who donned an MST cap for the cameras. During this session Lula recommitted to settling 430,000 families by the end of 2006 and agreed to allocate the necessary human and financial resources to accomplish this goal. He also committed to a range of related reforms, including an increase in the pool of lands available for redistribution [Ramos, 2005]. Later the Lula government would claim to have resettled 381,419 families between 2002 and 2006 - a claim disputed by the MST.&lt;ref&gt;Jorge Almeida, ed., ''Brazil in focus: economic, political and social issues''. New York: Nova Science, 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-60456-165-4}}, page 20&lt;/ref&gt; The movement claimed the numbers had been doctored by the inclusion of people already living in areas (national forests and other managed areas of environmental protection, as well as other already existing settlements) where their presence had only been legally acknowledged by the government.&lt;ref&gt;"Folha de S.Paulo Reports: Lula Government Inflates Agrarian Reform Numbers".

Smith,ed., ''Latin American democratic transformations: institutions, actors, and processes''. Malden, MA: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2009, {{ISBN|978-1-4051-9758-8}}, page 259&lt;/ref&gt;

The march was held to demand – among other things – that Brazil's President Lula implement his own limited agrarian reform plan rather than spend the project's budget on servicing the national debt [Ramos, 2005]. Several leaders of the MST met with President [[Lula da Silva]] on May 18, 2005- a meeting that had been resisted by Lula since his taking of office.&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Hochstetler, ''Civil society in Lula's Brazil''.

Afterwards during interviews with [[Reuters]], many of the leaders said that they still regarded President Lula as an ally but demanded that he accelerate his promised land reforms. However, late the same year, in September, João Pedro Stedile declared that, as far as land reform was concerned, Lula's government was "finished".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bourne, ''Lula of Brazil: the story so far ''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-520-24663-8}}, page 139&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of Lula's first term, it was clear that the MST had decided to act again as a separate movement, irrespective of the government's agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Gerhard Weyland, Raúl L. Madrid, Wendy Hunter, eds: ''Leftist Governments in Latin America: Successes and Shortcomings''. Cambridge University Press, 2010, {{ISBN|978-0-521-13033-2}}, page 122&lt;/ref&gt; As far as the MST was concerned, the greatest gain it received from the Lula government was the ''non-criminalization'' of the movement itself- the tough anti-occupation measures taken by the Cardoso government were left in abeyance and not enforced.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Ondetti, ''Land, Property and Politics'', page 207&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts at lawmaking that could be tailored in order to define the MST as a "terrorist organization" were also successfully opposed by Workers' Party congresspersons.&lt;ref&gt;Arinda Fernandes, "Crime Organizado e Terrorismo:Uma Relação Simbiótica Afetando a Economia Global".

Into a nutshell, however, as stated by a German author, in terms of land reform, what the Lula government did in general was to forward, year after year, a blueprint that was also regularly blockaded by regional agrarian elites.&lt;ref&gt;Christoph Blepp, ''Blockaden und Disparitäten?: Über das Entwicklungspotential und dessen Hindernisse in Brasilien''.

In 2008 a group of public attorneys from Rio Grande do Sul working with the state's military police issued a report charging the MST with collusion with international terrorist groups.

The report declared further investigation pointless, "as it was public knowledge that the movement and its leadership were guilty of engaging in organized criminality".The report also proposed that where MST activists could "cause electoral disequilibrium", the activists' right to vote be withdrawn by striking them from the voter registry.&lt;ref&gt;Pedrinho A.

Between September 27 and October 7, 2009, the MST occupied an orange plantation in [[Borebi]], State of São Paulo, owned by orange juice multinational Cutrale, the said corporation claiming to have suffered losses worth R$1.2 million (roughly US$603,000) in damaged equipment, missing pesticide, destroyed crops and trees cut by MST activists.&lt;ref&gt;"Cutrale afirma que MST causou R$1,2 milhão de prejuízo em sua fazenda de laranja".

The MST wholeheartedly declared support for [[Dilma Rousseff]]'s candidacy, but once elected she offered the movement very qualified support. In a national broadcast in November 2010, she declared land reform a question "of human rights", i.e., a purely humanitarian one.&lt;ref&gt;Genny Petschulat, "Grass-Roots Struggle in the 'Culture of Silence':Collective Dialogue and the Brazilian Landless Movement".

International Conference on Global Land Grabbing, 6–8 April 2011, Institute of Development Studies, University of Sussex, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; In a radio interview during the campaign she repeated the old conservative hope that economic growth could make Brazilian land issues recede: "What we are doing is doing away with the real basis for the instabilities of the landless. They are losing reasons to fight".&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Dangl, "Why land reform makes sense for Dilma Rousseff". ''The Guardian'', 27th January 2011, available at [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/jan/27/brazil-farming]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus one author described the MST's endorsement of Rousseff as a choice of the "lesser evil".&lt;ref&gt;Eduardo Silva, ed., '' Transnational Activism and National Movements in Latin America: Bridging the Divide''.

Consolidation of land ownership continued unabated. In 2006, according to the property census, the [[Gini index]] of land concentration stood at 0.854, while at the beginning of military regime, in 1967, it was at 0.836. In other words concentration of land ownership into just a few hands actually increased.&lt;ref&gt;''Carta Capital'', issue 657, July 29, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Current Brazilian economic policy{{when|date=July 2017}} especially in [[international trade|foreign exchange]], relies on [[trade surplus]]es generated by the agricultural [[export]]s, so "the correlation of forces moves against [[agrarian reform]]".&lt;ref&gt;A.

On April 16 2012, a group of MST activists occupied the headquarters in Brasília of the [[Ministry of Agrarian Development (Brazil)|Ministry of Agrarian Development]], as part of the movement's regular "Red April" campaign, a yearly nationwide occupation initiative in honor of the April 1996 [[Eldorado dos Carajás massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;"MST invade prédio do Ministério do Desenvolvimento Agrário".

Land activists were dissatisfied the slowing pace of official land reform projects under the Rousseff government. Fewer families were officially settled in 2011 than in the previous 16 years. Government reaction to the occupation sparked widespread accusations from the PT base that Rousseff had sold out.&lt;ref&gt;"Dilma fights accusations of selling out, risks losing party support". ''Global Post'', April 6, 2012, available at [http://www.globalpost.com/dispatches/globalpost-blogs/rights/dilma-fights-accusations-selling-out-risks-losing-party-support]&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2012 interview, Stedile admitted that the movement had not benefited from the policies of the PT administrations, since the coalition governments of the PT could not act politically on behalf of land reform. &lt;ref&gt;Interview, ''Jornal dos Economistas'', no.278, November 2012, pages 6/7&lt;/ref&gt;

Both political pundits and activists thought Rousseff's first term was a lean period for land reform, and mainstream media called the MST not only "tamed" by the two consecutive PT administrations, and drained of mass support by steady economic growth and expanding employment, denying the movement its chief ''raison d'être''. In 2013 it attempted only 110 occupations,&lt;ref&gt;"Em 2013, MST registra o menor número de invasões durante governos do PT".

Such programs are however "entirely disproportionate to what is being offered [in terms of public monies, subsidized credits, etc. to agribusiness", he said, and the only chance for land reform in Brazil would be a kind of [[joint venture]] between small producers and urban working class consumers, as simple [[land redistribution]] would be fated to fail, as it had in [[Venezuela]], "where [[Hugo Chávez]] stockedpiled seven million [[hectares]] of nationalized land property which remained unused for want of proper peasants".&lt;ref&gt;" 'Agora estão tentando privatizar inclusive o ar', diz João Pedro Stédile" - IG newssite, December 11, 2013, [http://ultimosegundo.ig.com.br/politica/2013-12-11/agora-estao-tentando-privatizar-inclusive-o-ar-diz-joao-pedro-stedile.html].

The visit and resulting agreement created tension among the conservative in the Brazilian Congress; Senator and landowner [[Ronaldo Caiado]] describing the agreement as "an arrngement between a high-placed representative of a foreign government and an unlawful entity, aimed at building a socialist society".

'''Loretta Nall''' is the founder of the [[United States]] [[US Marijuana Party|Marijuana Party]] (USMJP) which calls for the legalization of [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]. She was a write-in candidate for [[governor]] of [[Alabama]] in 2006.

== History ==
Nall founded the USMJP in 2002. In 2005, she co-founded [[Alabamians for Caring Use]], a [[medical cannabis|medical marijuana]] advocacy/lobbying group. Before his 2005 [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada, arrest, the so-called "Prince of Pot," [[Marc Emery]], employed Nall under the auspices of ''[[Cannabis Culture Magazine|Cannabis Culture]]'' magazine. Nall herself was booked and jailed for less than one day on September 17, 2002, for possession of [[marijuana]] and [[drug paraphernalia]] after police made a search of her home.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard, Elizabeth. "[http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig3/bernard1.html Meet Loretta Nall]." Retrieved 9 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides advocating the legalization of cannabis in the United States, Nall is also an outspoken critic of the worldwide [[War on Drugs]]. After a 2004 visit to [[Colombia]], she has spoken and written against the United States and Colombian militaries' aerial destruction of Colombian [[coca]] fields with [[herbicide]]s, citing dangers to local human populations and the environment.

Nall also calls for [[tax credit]]s for [[homeschooling|homeschoolers]], American withdrawal from the [[Iraq War]], an end to the [[war on drugs]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.november.org/stayinfo/breaking2/Colombia-LorettaNall.html&lt;/ref&gt; and she opposes the [[No Child Left Behind Act|No Child Left Behind]], [[USA PATRIOT Act|USA PATRIOT]], and [[REAL ID Act|REAL ID]] acts. Nall is a contributor to [[Lew Rockwell|LewRockwell.com]].&lt;ref&gt;Nall, Loretta. "[http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig5/nall1.html Colombia]." ''LewRockwell.com''. 17 November 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nall, Loretta. "[http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig5/nall2.html My Day in Court]." ''LewRockwell.com''. 18 March 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==2006 Alabama gubernatorial campaign==
Nall secured the [[United States Libertarian Party|Libertarian Party]] of Alabama's [[Alabama gubernatorial election, 2006|2006]] nomination for governor of [[Alabama]] at the party's 8 April 2006 convention in [[Montgomery, Alabama]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060410/NEWS02/604100330&amp;SearchID=73241359473716 Libertarians name gubernatorial candidate] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927192914/http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20060410%2FNEWS02%2F604100330&amp;SearchID=73241359473716 |date=2007-09-27 }}."

''Montgomery Advertiser''. 2 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Since Nall's campaign failed to collect the 40,000+ signatures required to achieve statewide ballot access in Alabama, she ran as a write-in candidate against Republican incumbent [[Bob Riley (Alabama)|Bob Riley]] and Democratic challenger [[Lucy Baxley]]. Nall's campaign was covered by national media&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15392890/ How to attract voters’ attention? Cleavage]." MSNBC.com. 25 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; after pictures of the candidate that revealed her buxom appearance drew comments from local political commentator Bob Ingram. Ingram concluded a 7 March 2006 op-ed in the ''Montgomery Independent'' with the following comment:
{{Quote|Allow me to express a personal note of appreciation to Bob Martin, the editor of this newspaper, for finding a picture of gubernatorial candidate Loretta Nall to run with my column last week. I am sure it attracted a lot of readers. In 55 years of political writing, that was a first for me—a picture in my column of a woman displaying cleavage. I can only hope that my mother...and I know for a fact where she ended in the after life...didn’t see that column. She wouldn’t have approved of that picture.&lt;ref&gt;Ingram, Bob. "[http://www.shelbycountyreporter.com/articles/2006/03/12/opinion/opin03.txt Mask's win a sign of things to come]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}." ''Shelby Country Reporter''. 7 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The election was won by Riley, with Nall receiving only 235 votes, or 0.02%, but she says that she will continue to run for Alabama office in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Bunting, Josh. "Third Party Candidates to Run for Office Nov. 7." ''The Spirit''. 6 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sex toy drive==
In November 2007, to protest the [[Anti-Obscenity Enforcement Act]] of 1998, Nall organized a [http://nallforgovernor.blogspot.com/2007/11/sex-toys-for-troy-king.html sex toy drive], encouraging people to mail sex toys to Alabama Attorney General [[Troy King]], who sought to prosecute shops that sell the devices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-m-appel/alabamas-bad-vibrations_b_300491.html Alabama's Bad Vibrations]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MVaaS''' is an acronym for '''managed video as a service'''.  It refers to a [[systems architecture]] used by companies that provide or enable [[Surveillance|video monitoring]] services, to allow them and their customers to more easily manage large numbers of [[digital video recorders]] (DVRs) or [[Network Video Recorder|network video recorders]] (NVRs).

In any scalable video monitoring architecture, the information about a customer’s physical locations, the video recorders and [[camera]]s at those locations, and the customer’s users must be stored in a central [[database]].  In a traditional architecture, each customer is responsible for hosting their own database.

In an MVaaS architecture, this database is managed by the video monitoring provider, not by the customer. The customer interacts with the database, and with their video recorders, using a [[website]] also managed by the video monitoring provider.   Because the customer is freed from the details of hosting the database and web site, this information is sometimes said to be “in the [[cloud computing|cloud]]”.  Indeed, the term MVaaS is intentionally similar to the more common term SaaS, [[software as a service]].

The term ''managed video'' refers to the fact that in this architecture, the [[customer]]’s video remains on the video recorders at the customer premises and is not stored in the central database.  The central database holds all the information that mediates access to the video, and is important for maintaining and configuring the video recorders, but does not contain the video itself.  This ensures that the customer always has ultimate control of their video, and frees the customer and the video monitoring company from having to continuously consume [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] to transfer video from the video recorders to the central database.

Under an MVaaS architecture, additional information may be stored in the central database besides just the information about the video recorders and users. For example, the video monitoring company may store observations or comments for each camera, or a [[logbook|log]] of which camera was monitored when.

==Alternative architectures==
An alternative to MVaaS is Hosted Video as a Service, HVaaS.  This architecture is like MVaaS, except the customer’s video is physically stored in the central database.  Some customers prefer this because it allows them to simplify the video recorders that are on their premises.

'''NES Financial''' is a privately held company that provides [[solution selling|services]] for [[financial transaction]]s. The company focuses its services on [[Internal Revenue Code section 1031|1031 exchanges]], EB-5, and [[escrow]], and fund administration. NES Financial is based in [[San Jose, California]] and maintains a regional office in Boston.

==History==
NES Financial was founded in 2005 in [[Silicon Valley]]. The company, originally named Nationwide Exchange Services Corporation, tried to set a new industry standard for [[Qualified intermediary|Qualified intermediaries]] (QI) facilitated IRC 1031 exchanges.
NES Financial developed a proprietary platform, eSTAC, for clients to view and administer activities from their accounts, in real-time.

NES broadened its core business into two other financial industries - trust and escrows. The company expanded into these markets, and by 2010, had outgrown its original vision, prompting a rebranding to NES Financial.

NES Financial is a third party administrator of complex escrow and fund administration transactions such as EB-5 and 1031 exchanges. Each year the company voluntarily undergoes a compliance examination of its administrative processes for [[Statement on Auditing Standards No. 70: Service Organizations|SSAE 16 SOC 1 Type II certification]], the same certification needed to obtain a federal bank charter and comply with [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act|Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404]] requirements.&lt;ref&gt;http://nesfinancial.com/nes-financial-successfully-completes-ninth-consecutive-compliance-examination/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 and again in 2012, Inc. Magazine's 500|5000 recognized NES Financial as one of the fastest-growing private companies in America with its three-year growth hitting 179%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inc.com/inc5000/list/2012|title=Inc. 5000|publisher=Inc.|accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, it serviced more than $85 billion in transactions.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Acquisitions==
In 2005, NES Financial acquired Exchanging.com and Nationwide 1031.

In October 2006, NES Financial acquired Cole Taylor Tax Deferred Exchange, a division of Cole Taylor Bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cole-taylor-bank-teams-up-with-nationwide-exchange-services-to-expand-and-enhance-tax-deferred-exchange-offerings-67278207.html|title= Cole Taylor Bank Teams Up With Nationwide Exchange Services to Expand and Enhance Tax-Deferred Exchange Offerings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2008, JP Morgan Property Exchange (JPEX) from [[JP Morgan Chase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandleroneill.com/Collateral/Documents/English-US/Nationwide%20Exchange-JP%20Morgan%20Announcement%2011-06-2008.pdf|title=Nationwide Exchange Services (Private, San Jose, CA) acquires J.P. Morgan Property Exchange, Inc from J.P. Morgan Chase (NYSE: JPM, New York, NY)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
NES Financial's transaction administration services use its proprietary eSTAC technology. This cloud-based platform was designed to administer and track the entire life cycle of an account and its transactions.

eSTAC sets the controls for documentation and management of account information, to automate routine processes and secure clients' funds. The platform combines back-end and front-end architecture, a design that integrates into existing systems.

==Services==

===Escrow and fund administration===
The company's escrow and fund administration services provide customizable and compliant administration of client funds. As with traditional fund administrators, NES Financial provides accounting for the fund and its participants: financial reports, investor statements, tax reports, and capital allocation reports.

===EB-5===
NES Financial simplifies escrow administration by helping Regional Centers and developers manage their bank and escrow needs, centralize document storage, provide virtual file sharing, and improve security, transparency, and compliance. On January 8, 2013, NES Financial announced two EB-5 escrow products for construction and capital returns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nesf.com/nes-financial-expands-solution-suite-for-eb-5-industry/|title= NES Financial expands solution suite for EB-5 industry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1031 Exchanges===
NES Financial helps businesses that need to sell or invest in assets and want  tax breaks. The company's qualified intermediary (QI) status, in-house expertise, and automated technologies help companies administrate 1031 exchange types, including forward, reverse, and [[like-kind exchange]] programs.

==Industries==
NES Financial solutions are suited for industries, including:

'''[[Aviation]]:''' NES Financial facilitates 1031 exchanges when companies need to sell and replace aircraft. This allows companies to defer taxes and reduce cash outlay on new aircraft.

'''Commercial [[Real estate]]:''' NES Financial provides sectors within the real estate industry the programs to ensure security of funds, regulatory compliance, and transparency of processes. The company provides other companies in the commercial real estate, legal, and M&amp;A markets with the expertise, technology, and administrative resources.

'''[[Leasing]]:''' Leasing companies that exchange old equipment for new equipment, such as fleets of vehicles, aircraft, or industrial equipment, can defer taxes on capital gains and depreciation recapture with the company's 1031 exchange program.

==Financial Reform Efforts==
Following the [[financial crisis of 2007-2008]], NES Financial focused its efforts in Washington D.C. Led by CEO Michael Halloran, the company lobbied tirelessly to improved 1031 industry regulations. Despite Halloran's nearly two years worth of efforts, the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act|Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010]] did not include additional 1031 regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_24/b4182032793023.htm?chan=magazine+channel_news+-+politics+%2B+policy|publisher=Businessweek|accessdate=18 April 2013|title= One Exec's Plea to Congress: Regulate Me, Please}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Paper Money Riot''', or '''Exeter Rebellion''', was an [[armed uprising]] in [[Exeter, New Hampshire]], on September 20, 1786. Following the [[American Revolution]], the nation, states, and many individuals were deeply in debt. The lack of [[Bullion coin|specie]] and [[Fiat money|paper currency]] in circulation made the payment of debts difficult for poor farmers. A group calling themselves [[War of the Regulation|Regulators]] called for the printing of paper money, believing that issuing paper notes on credit would help to stimulate the state's economy.

Many towns held conventions to draft petitions to the legislature over the issue of paper currency. These petitions fell on deaf ears. The Regulators grew ever more frustrated by this, and occasionally their protests turned violent.

Eventually the Regulators in [[Rockingham County, New Hampshire|Rockingham County]] armed themselves and marched on Exeter to demand the [[New Hampshire General Court]] immediately issue money. New Hampshire's [[Governor of New Hampshire|President]] at the time, [[John Sullivan (general)|John Sullivan]], was able to calm the situation, and convinced the mob to disperse for the night.

Meanwhile, he sent word to the surrounding towns to raise their [[New Hampshire Militia|militia]] and assemble in Exeter. The following morning, around 2,000 men had mustered, and they moved out to ambush the rebels' camp. The rebels were caught completely off guard, and they scattered into the woods. Most of the leaders were captured, but later pardoned.

This event took place during the time of [[Shays' Rebellion]]. New Hampshire's government was able to put down the rebellion without further incident or a prolonged engagement. It is one of the events which led to the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] a year later.&lt;ref&gt;Belknap, pp 395-404&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
After the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], debt was rampant in the country. The [[Continental Dollar]] had depreciated, rendering it an inexpedient form of currency. Hard currency was also scarce at this time. Congress had issued a requisition to the states in order to pay off their debt, roughly 30% of which was to be paid in hard currency. The result was a shortage of money circulating within the states, leaving many farmers unable to pay their personal debts. Commodities and property were appraised, and confiscated in order to make payments on these debts.&lt;ref&gt;Holton, pp. 65-73&lt;/ref&gt;

==Town conventions==
The first convention to address the issue in [[New Hampshire]] was held in [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]]. In attendance were many opponents of the paper money scheme, including [[William Plumer]]. The opponents planned to make a mockery of the proceedings by having some of their members pretend to be in favor of the Regulators.

The convention drafted a petition to send to the legislature in Exeter, and it was tabled in the House. Speaker of the House [[John Langdon (politician)|John Langdon]] was aware of the prank, and played along until the ruse was exposed. Those conventioneers who were sincere in their monetary reforms felt disenfranchised. Each subsequent town meeting yielded similar results. The farmers felt that their voices were not being heard by their government.&lt;ref&gt;Heffernan and Stecker, pp. 95-96&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rioters suspend court==
In 1782, armed rioters in [[Keene, New Hampshire|Keene]] shut down the courthouse, in an attempt to stall cases being heard regarding debts. John Sullivan was the state's [[New Hampshire Attorney General|attorney general]] at the time, and on his way into Keene when he heard about the armed mob. He donned his [[Continental Army]] uniform, then proceeded to the courthouse. He listened to the crowd's demands and told them to disperse. Many of the rioters were former soldiers of Sullivan's, so he used this status to his advantage. They reluctantly left, and court was adjourned for the day.

The following morning, the courthouse was packed with townsfolk eager to hear if their reform petition would be heard. Much to their relief, Sullivan had decided to skip any case where either party was not ready to proceed. Feeling that they had achieved their goal, the rioters left the court to its business, and cheered General Sullivan for hearing their demands.&lt;ref&gt;McClintock, pp. 409-411&lt;/ref&gt;

But this did not fix New Hampshire's money problems. The lack of currency continued to plague debtors, and they were forced to liquidate property, or even face prison sentences. And their petitioning of the state legislature continued to fall on deaf ears. Many who supported the petitions began to spread rumors that the bill had already passed, and the disenfranchised would be refunded the value of their seized property. The bill failed to pass, and the Regulators sought to solve their grievances at gunpoint.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, pp. 270-271&lt;/ref&gt;

==The riot==
On September 20, 1786, 200 men from Rockingham County gathered in [[Kingston, New Hampshire|Kingston]]. They were allegedly encouraged by [[Jonathan Moulton]] and [[Nathaniel Peabody]].&lt;ref&gt;Sanborn, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; The mob was led by three men: Joseph French from [[Hampstead, New Hampshire|Hampstead]], James Cochran from [[Pembroke, New Hampshire|Pembroke]], and John McKean from [[Londonderry, New Hampshire|Londonderry]].

From Kingston the crowd marched in a military column to Exeter. Their plan was to surround the town meeting house (where the General Court typically conducted business), and to force the assembly to print currency. By chance, on this particular day the legislature was meeting in the [[First Church (Exeter, New Hampshire)|First Church of Exeter]], and the [[New Hampshire Superior Court|Superior Court]] was in session in the meeting house. When the rioters surrounded the court, the presiding judge, [[Samuel Livermore]], ordered the room to ignore them. He then continued with the court's business.

Once the rebels finally realized their error, a crowd had congregated to witness the ruckus. As they tried to make their way over to the church, they met with opposition from the people of Exeter. It took quite a bit of effort to get through the crowd to the doors. Once there, sentries were posted to prevent anyone from entering or exiting the building.

Again, John Sullivan (now President of New Hampshire) engaged the mob as he had done in Keene several years prior. After discussing the matter with the insurgents, he promised to do all he could to appease then. He did not disperse the rioters, because he thought they would calm down if allowed to assemble freely.

Many of the citizens of Exeter were displeased that armed men had invaded their town. [[Nathaniel Gilman]] orchestrated a ruse to break the siege. He gathered a few townspeople and began marching them in a military fashion towards the rebels. They gave the impression that they were [[James Hackett (shipbuilder)|Hackett's]] Artillery Company from [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]].&lt;ref&gt;Bell, pp. 97-98&lt;/ref&gt; The ruse worked, and the Regulators finally dispersed. They crossed the river on the road back to Kingston and set up camp on the far side.

Now that the legislature was free to exit the church, they granted President Sullivan the power to send word out to nearby towns and call upon the militia.&lt;ref&gt;Sandborn, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; By the next morning, roughly 2,000 men had mustered in Exeter. They marched until they were near the rebels' camp, then a cavalry detachment under the command of [[Joseph Cilley (state senator)|Joseph Cilley]] crossed the river and cut off their retreat. The insurgents, now surrounded by state troops, fired only a few shots before scattering into the woods.

==Aftermath==
Several members of the uprising were caught, including the leaders. The following day, French, Cochrane, and McKean were brought before the General Court to answer to the charge of [[treason]]. The men argued that they were encouraged by Moulton and Peabody (who were both members of the legislature), but these men denied their involvement. French is said to have pleaded for his life, while Cochrane only for a pardon. Though they were indicted, they were immediately pardoned. Any rebels who were also militiamen were dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;McClintock, pp. 413-414&lt;/ref&gt;

The Legislature did eventually write a bill concerning the issuance of paper money. The proposal was issued to the towns who were to vote on the issue, and send their replies to the legislature. These came back with the majority against it. President Sullivan outlawed conventions for the purpose of petitioning the government, because they were considered to undermine the state's authority.&lt;ref&gt;Heffernan and Stecker, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; The government also used this opportunity to allow the governor to call up the militia in times of unrest.&lt;ref&gt;Szatmary, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; The only other uprising of this nature occurred in [[Grafton County, New Hampshire|Grafton County]], where farmers burned a courthouse.&lt;ref&gt;Szatmary, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

This episode in [[History of New Hampshire|New Hampshire's history]] highlighted the problems with the [[Articles of Confederation]]. It occurred at the same time as Shays' Rebellion, though it was put down quickly, and without bloodshed. Like the agrarian uprisings in [[Massachusetts]] and other states, it paved the way for the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]], and the [[Coinage Act of 1792]].

'''Phoebe Hart''' is a film maker, lecturer and [[intersex]] rights activist, born with [[Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome]]. Hart lectures in film, television and digital media at the [[Queensland University of Technology]],&lt;ref name="qut" /&gt; and is principal of Hartflicker, a video and film production company.&lt;ref name="autobio"/&gt; She is known particularly for her autobiographical road trip movie, ''[[Orchids, My Intersex Adventure]]''.

== Early life ==
Hart describes how she was told she would never menstruate nor have children, but the reasons were not discussed and the topic was taboo. When Hart was 17 years of age, her mother told her the family secret, that Hart had testes in her abdomen. Hart was pressured into a [[Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome#Gonadectomy|gonadectomy]] (sterilization), and in the documentary she faces the traumatic emotional scars from that operation and the secrecy associated with it.&lt;ref name="autobio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="synopsis" /&gt; During the shooting of her auto-biography, her parents initially refused to be filmed.&lt;ref name="synopsis"&gt;{{cite web | work = Orchids, My Intersex Adventure | url = http://www.orchids-themovie.com/synopsis.html | title = Film Synopsis | date = 3 October 2010 | accessdate = 26 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tedx"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-E8aCF1krE | title = Phoebe Hart | work = [[TEDx]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Hart completed her film studies at the [[Queensland University of Technology]] (QUT) in 1995.&lt;ref name="govt"&gt;{{cite web | work = Queensland Government, Office for Women | url = http://www.women.qld.gov.au/events/ideas/#phoebe-hart | title = Government biography of Phoebe Hart | date = 14 April 2009 | accessdate = 26 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She has been involved in the children’s programme ''[[Totally Wild]]'', [[Network Ten]]’s documentary unit, and the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]’s ''[[Race Around the World]]'' and ''[[Fly TV]]''.

In 2009, Hart was awarded her doctorate from [[Queensland University of Technology]], of which ''Orchids'' was a central element of her doctoral studies.&lt;ref name ="govt" /&gt; This documentary took six years for the principal documenters (sisters Phoebe and [[Bonnie Hart]]) to film, using a variety of cameras including semi-professional digital cameras, domestic VHS camcorders, and Super 8.&lt;ref name="synopsis" /&gt; She describes the work as a means of helping young intersex people to come to terms with their bodies:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Hart| first = Phoebe| title = My intersex body: more than an object of fascination or repulsion to be ‘fixed’| work = [[The Independent]]| date = 2015-10-07| url = https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/my-intersex-body-more-than-an-object-of-fascination-or-repulsion-to-be-fixed-a6681631.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|One of the goals I had in telling my own story in a documentary and {{sic|public|ally}} revealing me as intersex to a global audience was to change minds and show how our lives are not so unlike anyone else. In particular, I wanted to create a positive frame for young people with intersex variations, who I hoped would not have to go through what I experienced. I had to hide who I was from others, and was constantly terrified of being excluded for the monster and freak I had come to believe I was.}}

Hart is also a former president of the [[Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://aissga.org.au | title = What's new with the AISSG Australia? | work =  [[Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Politicide''' is the deliberate physical destruction of a group whose members share the main characteristic of belonging to a political movement.  It is a type of [[political repression]], and one means of the [[political cleansing of population]], with another being [[forced migration]].  It may be compared to [[genocide]] or [[ethnic cleansing]], which involve killing people based on membership in a racial or ethnic group rather than holding a political ideology.&lt;ref name=HG&gt;[http://science.jrank.org/pages/9496/Genocide-Origins-Evolution-Concept.html Origins and Evolution of the Concept] in  the Science Encyclopedia by Net Industries states "Politicide, as [Barbara] Harff and [Ted R.] Gurr define it, refers to the killing of groups of people who are targeted not because of shared ethnic or communal traits, but because of 'their hierarchical position or political opposition to the regime and dominant groups' (p. 360)". This reference does not give the book title to go with the page number.&lt;/ref&gt;

The social scientists [[Barbara Harff]] and Ted R. Gurr uses policide to describe the killing of groups of people who are targeted not because of shared ethnic or communal traits (the types of groups covered by the CPPCG), but because of "their hierarchical position or political opposition to the regime and dominant groups".&lt;ref name=HG/&gt;

'''Post turtle''' is a phrase that has been used in political discussion of various countries, including the U.S. and Canada, based on an old joke. Various politicians have been referenced by the joke or used the joke, including [[Bill Clinton]],&lt;ref name="PostTurtle02"/&gt; [[George W Bush]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://politicalhumor.about.com/library/jokes/bljokebushpostturtle.htm |title=Political Jokes – Bush the Post Turtle |publisher=About.com |accessdate=November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barack Obama]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dorinson |first=Patrick |url=http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2009/08/28/patrick-dorinson-obama-post-turtle/ |title=The Cowboy Libertarian: Obama the 'Post Turtle' |publisher=Fox News – Opinion |date=August 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Donald Trump]]. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/9kkxov/while_stitching_a_cut_on_the_hand_of_a_75_year/?st=JMRH2S1L&amp;sh=252e7e77|title=Donald Trump - The Post Trutle|date=October 2, 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==The joke==
An old rancher is talking about politics with a young man from the city. He compares a politician to a "post turtle". The young man doesn't understand and asks him what a post turtle is.

The old man says, "When you're driving down a country road and you see a fence post with a turtle balanced on top, that's a post turtle. You know he didn't get up there by himself. He doesn't belong there; you wonder who put him there; he can't get anything done while he's up there; and you just want to help the poor, dumb thing down."

==Notable usage==
[[Mary Doria Russell]] used the post turtle reference in her 1996 novel ''[[The Sparrow (novel)|The Sparrow]]'', attributing it to Father D.W. Yarborough, leader of the first Earth expedition to another planet. Yarborough refers to post turtles in the context of seeming anomalies in nature and regards them as proof of the existence of God, specifically of God trying to get our attention.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Mary Doria (1996). ''The Sparrow''. Villard.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton'' by [[Joe Klein]], published in 2002, quotes Clinton as saying: "If you see a turtle sitting on top of a fence post, it didn't get there by accident." According to Klein, this was Clinton's way of claiming partial responsibility for "the historic prosperity and the global peace that attended his time in office".&lt;ref name="PostTurtle02"&gt;{{cite news |author=Kennedy, William |newspaper=The New York Times |date=March 24, 2002 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E4D91039F937A15750C0A9649C8B63 |title=The Turtle on the Fence Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Molly Ivins]] is attributed to usage for George W. Bush.&lt;ref name="PostTurtle01"&gt;{{cite web |author=Ivins, Molly |publisher=Democrats.US |year=2003 |url=http://www.democrats.us/editorial/ivins042304.shtml |title=Turtle on a Fence Post |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040707111634/http://democrats.us/editorial/ivins042304.shtml |archivedate=July 7, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, [[Steve Benen]], lead blogger for the liberal "The Political Animal" at ''[[Washington Monthly]]'', referred to [[Eric Cantor]] as a post turtle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Benen |first=Steve |url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2009_12/021344.php |title=Eric Cantor, Post Turtle |publisher=Political Animal (Washington Monthly) |date=October 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2010 [[Country Music Association Awards|CMAs]], [[Brad Paisley]] used the phrase in his acceptance speech for Entertainer of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/metro-music/2010-11-11/lady-antebellum-wins-2-cma-awards |title=Lady Antebellum wins 2 CMA awards |work=The Augusta Chronicle |date=November 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pretoria Accord''' was a July 2002 agreement made between [[Rwanda]] and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC) in an attempt to bring about an end to the [[Second Congo War]]. Rwanda agreed to the withdrawal of the estimated 20,000 Rwandan troops from the DRC in exchange for international commitment towards the disarmament of the [[Hutu]] militia ''[[interahamwe]]'' and ex-[[Rwandan Armed Forces|FAR]] fighters.

The talks were held in [[Pretoria]], [[South Africa]] and lasted for five days.

{{use British English|date=January 2014}}
The term "'''Radical'''" (from the [[Latin]] {{lang|la|[[wikt:radix#Latin|radix]]}} meaning root) during the late 18th-century and early 19th-century identified proponents of democratic reform, in what subsequently became the parliamentary [[Radicals (UK)|Radical Movement]].

During the 19th century in the United Kingdom, continental [[Europe]] and Latin America, the term "Radical" came to denote a [[Progressivism|progressive]] liberal ideology. Historically, Radicalism emerged in the 1830s in the [[United Kingdom]] (see the Chartist Movement) and Belgium (see the Revolution of 1830), then in the 1840s-50s (see the Revolutions of 1848), with political support for a "radical reform" of the [[electoral system]] to widen [[suffrage|the franchise]]. Radicalism was also associated with [[republicanism]], abolition of titles, redistribution of [[property]] and [[freedom of the press]].

In [[France in the nineteenth century|ninteenth-century France]], Radicalism had emerged as a minor political force by the 1840s, as the extreme-left of the day (in contrast to the socially-conservative liberalism of the [[Moderate Republicans (France)|Moderate Republicans]] and [[Orléanist|Orléanists monarchist]]s, and the anti-parliamentarism of the [[Legitimists|Legitimist monarchists]] and [[Bonapartism|Bonapartist republicans]]). By the 1890s the French Radicals were not norganised under a single nationwide structure, but had become a significant political force in parliament; in 1901 they consolidated their efforts by forming the country's first major extra-parliamenatry political party, the [[Radical Party (France)|Republican, Radical and Radical-Socialist Party]], which became the most important party of government during the second half (1899 to 1940) of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]]. The success of the French PRRRS encouraged Radicals elsewhere to organise themselves into formal parties in a range of other countries in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, with Radicals holding significant political office in [[Free Democratic Party of Switzerland|Switzerland]], [[Venizelism|Greece]], [[Joaquín Costa|Portugal]], [[Democratic Liberal Party (Italy)|Italy]], [[Republican Left (Spain)|Spain]], [[Venstre (Denmark)|Denmark]], [[Left Party (Sweden)|Sweden]], [[Free-thinking Democratic League|the Netherlands]], [[German Democratic Party|Germany]], [[Fianna Fáil|Ireland]], [[Radical Democratic Party (Bulgaria)|Bulgaria]], [[C. A. Rosetti|Romania]], and [[Trudoviks|Russia]]. During the interwar, European Radical parties organised their own international, the Radical Entente. 

As social-democracy emerged as a distinct political force in its own right, the differences that once existed between left-wing [[historical radicalism|radicalism]] and conservative-liberalism diminished, and between 1940 and 1973 Radicalism became defunct in most of its European heartlands, its role and philosophy taken on by [[Social democracy|social-democratic]] and [[Conservative liberalism|conservative-liberal]] parties. 

== Radicalism and liberalism ==
{{see also|Liberalism}}
In some countries, Radicalism has remained only as a minor wing within the Liberal political family. Sometimes it is less doctrinaire and more moderate while other times it is more extreme. In [[Victorian era]] [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the Radicals were part of the Liberal coalition, but often rebelled when the more traditional [[Whig (British political party)|Whigs]] in that coalition resisted democratic reforms.

In other countries, Radicalism and left-wing liberalism has enough electoral support, or a favourable electoral system or coalition partners, to maintain distinct Radical parties: [[Liberalism and radicalism in Switzerland|Switzerland]] and [[Liberalism in Germany|Germany]] (''Freisinn''), [[Liberalism and radicalism in Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Liberalism and radicalism in Denmark|Denmark]], [[Liberalism and radicalism in Italy|Italy]], [[Liberalism and radicalism in Spain|Spain]] and the [[Liberalism in the Netherlands|Netherlands]],&lt;ref&gt;See for more information the section on ''Liberale und radikale Parteien'' in Klaus von Beyme: Parteien in westlichen Demokratien, München, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; but also [[Argentina]] ([[Radical Civic Union]]), [[Liberalism and radicalism in Chile|Chile]] and [[Liberalism and radicalism in Paraguay|Paraguay]].&lt;ref&gt;Compare page 255 and further in the Guide to the Political Parties of South America (Pelican Books, 1973)&lt;/ref&gt;

This does not mean that all radical parties were formed by left-wing liberals. In French political literature, it is normal to make a clear separation between  Radicalism as a distinct political force to the left of Liberalism. Over time, as new left-wing parties formed to address the new issues, the current right-wing of the Radicals would splinter off in disagreement with the majority's desire to cooperate with the new parties over the new social issues. Thus, various groups or individuals broke away from the main Radical family and became absorbed as the left-wing of the Liberal family - rather than the other way around, as in Britain and Belgium. 

However, the distinction between Radicals and Liberals was made clear by the two mid-20th century attempts to create an international for centrist democratic parties. In 1923-4, the French Radicals created an ''Entente Internationale des Partis Radicaux et des Partis Démocratiques similaires'': it was joined by the centre-left Radical parties of Europe, and in the democracies where no equivalent existed - Britain and Belgium - the Liberal party was allowed attend instead. After the Second World War the Radical International was not reformed; instead, a centre-right [[Liberal International]] was established, closer to the conservative-liberalism of the British and Belgian Liberal parties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liberal-social.org/internacional-liberal Internacional Liberal|Movimento Liberal Social – Liberalismo em Portugal], [[Social Liberal Movement]] official website.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europe-politique.eu/internationale-liberale.htm Internationale Libérale], Europe Politique | europe-politique.eu.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;See page 1 and further of ''A sense of liberty'' by Julie Smith, published by the Liberal International in 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;  This marked the end of Radicalsm as an independent political force in Europe, though some countries such as France and Switzerland retained poltically-important Radical parties well into the 1950s-1960s.

Thus, many European parties that are nowadays categorised in the group of [[social liberalism|social-liberal]] parties have a historical affinity with radicalism and may therefore be called "liberal-radical".&lt;ref name="liberal-radical"&gt;{{citation|last1=Hloušek|first1=Vít|title=Origin, Ideology and Transformation of Political Parties: East-Central and Western Europe Compared|page=108|year=2010|publisher=Ashgate|last2=Kopeček|first2=Lubomír}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== United Kingdom ==
{{main|Radicals (UK)}}
According to ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', the first use of the word "Radical" in a political sense is generally ascribed to the English [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] [[Parliament of England|parliamentarian]] [[Charles James Fox]]. In 1797, Fox declared for a "radical reform" of the [[electoral system]]. This led to a general use of the term to identify all supporting the movement for parliamentary reform.

Initially confined to the upper and middle classes,{{citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source; It appears to be opinion or rhetoric as UK devolution of power has a much longer history arguably not initiated by the upper and middle classes.|date=January 2014}} in the early 19th century "popular radicals" brought [[artisan]]s and the "labouring classes" into widespread agitation{{citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source; it appears to be opinion or rhetoric as UK devolution of power has a much longer history arguably not initiated by the upper and middle classes.|date=January 2014}} in the face of harsh government repression. More respectable{{citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source; it appears to be opinion.|date=January 2014}} "[[philosophical radicals]]" followed the [[utilitarian]] philosophy of [[Jeremy Bentham]] and strongly supported parliamentary reform, but were generally hostile to the arguments and tactics of the "popular radicals". By the middle of the century, [[Radicals (UK)|parliamentary Radicals]] joined with others in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] to form the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], eventually achieving reform of the [[electoral system]].

=== Origins ===
The Radical movement had its beginnings at a time of tension between the American colonies and [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], with the first Radicals, angry at the state of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], drawing on the [[Levellers|Leveller]] tradition and similarly demanding improved parliamentary representation. These earlier concepts of democratic and even egalitarian reform had emerged in the turmoil of the [[English Civil War]] and the brief establishment of the [[republic]]an [[Commonwealth of England]] amongst the vague political grouping known as the Levellers, but with the [[English Restoration]] of the monarchy such ideas had been discredited. Although the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 had increased parliamentary power with a [[constitutional monarchy]] and the [[Act of Union 1707|union of the parliaments]] brought [[England]] and [[Scotland]] together, towards the end of the 18th century the monarch still had considerable influence over the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] which itself was dominated by the English aristocracy and by patronage. Candidates for the House of Commons stood as [[Whig (British political party)|Whigs]] or [[Tory|Tories]], but once elected formed shifting coalitions of interests rather than splitting along party lines. At [[general election]]s, the vote was restricted to property owners in constituencies which were out of date and did not reflect the growing importance of manufacturing towns or shifts of population, so that in many [[Rotten and pocket boroughs|rotten borough]] seats could be bought or were controlled by rich landowners while major cities remained unrepresented. Discontent with these inequities inspired those individuals who later became known as the "[[Radical Whigs]]".

[[William Beckford (politician)|William Beckford]] fostered early interest in reform in the [[London]] area. The "[[Middlesex]] radicals" were led by the politician [[John Wilkes]], an opponent of war with the colonies who started his weekly publication ''[[The North Briton]]'' in 1764 and within two years had been charged with [[seditious libel]] and expelled from the House of Commons. The [[Society for the Defence of the Bill of Rights]] which he started in 1769 to support his re-election, developed the belief that every man had the right to vote and "natural reason" enabling him to properly judge political issues. Liberty consisted in frequent elections and for the first time middle-class radicals obtained the backing of the London "mob". Middlesex and [[Westminster (UK Parliament constituency)|Westminster]] were among the few parliamentary constituencies with a large and socially diverse electorate including many [[artisan]]s as well as the middle class and aristocracy and along with the county association of [[Yorkshire]] led by the Reverend [[Christopher Wyvill]] were at the forefront of reform activity. The writings of what became known as the "[[Radical Whigs]]" had an influence on the [[American Revolution]].

[[John Cartwright (political reformer)|Major John Cartwright]] also supported the colonists, even as the [[American Revolutionary War]] began and in 1776 earned the title of the "Father of Reform" when he published his pamphlet ''Take Your Choice!'' advocating annual parliaments, the secret ballot and manhood [[suffrage]]. In 1780, a draft programme of reform was drawn up by [[Charles James Fox]] and [[Thomas Brand Hollis]] and put forward by a sub-committee of the electors of Westminster. This included calls for the six points later adopted in the ''People's Charter'' (see [[#Chartists|Chartists]] below).

The American Revolutionary War ended in humiliating defeat of a policy which King [[George III of Great Britain|George III]] had fervently advocated and in March 1782 the King was forced to appoint an administration led by his opponents which sought to curb Royal patronage. In November 1783, he took his opportunity and used his influence in the [[House of Lords]] to defeat a Bill to reform the [[British East India Company]], dismissed the government and appointed [[William Pitt the Younger]] as his Prime Minister. Pitt had previously called for Parliament to begin to reform itself, but he did not press for long for reforms the King did not like. Proposals Pitt made in April 1785 to redistribute seats from the "[[rotten borough]]s" to London and the counties were defeated in the House of Commons by 248 votes to 174.

=== Popular agitation ===
In the wake of the [[French Revolution of 1789]], [[Thomas Paine]] wrote ''[[The Rights of Man]]'' (1791) as a response to [[Edmund Burke|Burke]]'s [[counterrevolutionary]] essay ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' (1790), itself an attack on [[Richard Price]]'s sermon that kicked off the so-called "pamphlet war" known as the [[Revolution Controversy]]. [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], another supporter of Price, soon followed with ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]''. They encouraged mass support for democratic reform along with rejection of the [[monarchy]], [[aristocracy]] and all forms of privilege. Different strands of the movement developed, with middle class "reformers" aiming to widen the franchise to represent commercial and industrial interests and towns without parliamentary representation, while "Popular radicals" drawn from the middle class and from [[artisan]]s agitated to assert wider rights including relieving distress. The theoretical basis for electoral reform was provided by "Philosophical radicals" who followed the [[utilitarian]] philosophy of [[Jeremy Bentham]] and strongly supported parliamentary reform, but were generally hostile to the arguments and tactics of the "popular radicals".

Popular Radicals were quick to go further than Paine, with [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] schoolmaster [[Thomas Spence]] demanding land nationalisation to redistribute wealth in a penny periodical he called ''Pig's Meat'' in a reference to [[Edmund Burke]]'s phrase "swinish multitude". Radical organisations sprang up, such as the [[London Corresponding Society]] of artisans formed in January 1792 under the leadership of the shoemaker [[Thomas Hardy (political reformer)|Thomas Hardy]] to call for the vote. One such was the [[Scotland|Scottish]] ''[[Friends of the People]]'' society which in October 1793 held a British convention in [[Edinburgh]] with delegates from some of the English [[London Corresponding Society|corresponding societies]]. They issued a manifesto demanding universal male suffrage with annual elections and expressing their support for the principles of the French Revolution. The numbers involved in these movements were small and most wanted reform rather than revolution, but for the first time working men were organising for political change.

The government reacted harshly, imprisoning leading Scottish radicals, temporarily suspending [[habeas corpus]] in England and passing the [[Seditious Meetings Act 1795]] which meant that a license was needed for any meeting in a public place consisting of fifty or more people. Throughout the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the government took extensive stern measures against feared domestic unrest. The corresponding societies ended, but some radicals continued in secret, with Irish sympathisers in particular forming secret societies to overturn the government and encourage mutinies. In 1812, [[John Cartwright (political reformer)|Major John Cartwright]] formed the first [[Hampden Club]], named after the [[English Civil War]] Parliamentary leader [[John Hampden]], aiming to bring together middle class moderates and lower class radicals.

After the Napoleonic Wars, the [[Corn laws]] (in force between 1815 and 1846) and bad harvests fostered discontent. The publications of [[William Cobbett]] were influential and at political meetings speakers like [[Henry Hunt (politician)|Henry Hunt]] complained that only three men in a hundred had the vote. Writers like the radicals [[William Hone]] and [[Thomas Jonathan Wooler]] spread dissent with publications such as ''[[The Black Dwarf]]'' in defiance of a series of government acts to curb circulation of political literature. Radical riots in 1816 and 1817 were followed by the [[Peterloo massacre]] of 1819 publicised by [[Richard Carlile]], who then continued to fight for press freedom from prison. The [[Six Acts]] of 1819 limited the right to demonstrate or hold public meetings. In [[Scotland]], agitation over three years culminated in an attempted general strike and abortive workers' uprising crushed by government troops in the "[[Radical War]]" of 1820. Magistrates powers were increased to crush demonstrations by manufacturers and action by radical [[Luddite]]s.

To counter the established [[Church of England]] doctrine that the aristocratic social order was divinely ordained, radicals supported [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Lamarckian]] [[Evolutionism]], a theme proclaimed by street corner agitators as well as some established scientists such as [[Robert Edmund Grant]].

=== Political reform ===
Economic conditions improved after 1821 and the [[United Kingdom]] government made economic and criminal law improvements, abandoning policies of repression. In 1823, [[Jeremy Bentham]] co-founded the ''[[Westminster Review]]'' with [[James Mill]] as a journal for "philosophical radicals", setting out the [[utilitarian]] philosophy that right actions were to be measured in proportion to the greatest good they achieved for the greatest number. [[Westminster (UK Parliament constituency)|Westminster]] elected two radicals to Parliament during the 1820s.

The [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] gained power and despite defeats in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] and the [[House of Lords]] the [[Reform Act 1832]] was put through with the support of public outcry, mass meetings of "political unions" and riots in some cities. This now enfranchised the middle classes, but failed to meet radical demands. The Whigs introduced reforming measures owing much to the ideas of the philosophic radicals, abolishing slavery and in 1834 introducing [[Thomas Malthus|Malthusian]] [[Poor Law]] reforms which were bitterly opposed by "popular radicals" and writers like [[Thomas Carlyle]]. Following the 1832 Reform Act, the mainly aristocratic Whigs in the House of Commons were joined by a small number of [[Radicals (UK)|parliamentary Radicals]] as well as an increased number of middle class Whigs. By 1839, they were informally being called "the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal party]]".

=== Chartists ===
{{main|Chartism}}
From 1836, working class Radicals unified around the [[Chartism|Chartist]] cause of electoral reform expressed in the ''People's Charter'' drawn up by six members of Parliament and six from the [[London Working Men's Association]] (associated with [[Owenite]] [[Utopian socialism]]), which called for six points: [[universal suffrage]], equal-sized [[Election|electoral]] districts, [[secret ballot]], an end to property qualification for Parliament, pay for Members of Parliament and Annual Parliaments. Chartists also expressed economic grievances, but their mass demonstrations and petitions to parliament were unsuccessful.

Despite initial disagreements, after their failure their cause was taken up by the middle class [[Anti-Corn Law League]] founded by [[Richard Cobden]] and [[John Bright]] in 1839 to oppose duties on imported grain which raised the price of food and so helped landowners at the expense of ordinary people.

=== Liberal reforms ===
The [[Radicals (UK)|parliamentary Radicals]] joined with the [[Whigs (UK)|Whigs]] and [[free trade|anti-protectionist]] [[Tory]] [[Peelite]]s to form the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] by 1859. Demand for parliamentary reform increased by 1864 with agitation from [[John Bright]] and the [[Reform League]].

When the Liberal government led by [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord Russell]] and [[William Ewart Gladstone]] introduced a modest bill for parliamentary reform, it was defeated by both Tories and reform Liberals, forcing the government to resign. The Tories under [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Lord Derby]] and [[Benjamin Disraeli]] took office and the new government decided to "dish the Whigs" and "take a leap in the dark" to take the credit for the reform. As a minority government, they had to accept radical amendments and Disraeli's [[Reform Act 1867]] almost doubled the electorate, giving the vote even to working men.

The Radicals, having been strenuous in their efforts on behalf of the working classes, earned a deeply loyal following—British trade unionists from 1874 until 1892, upon being elected to Parliament, never considered themselves to be anything other than Radicals and were labeled [[Liberal-Labour (UK)|Lib-Lab]] candidates. Radical trade unionists formed the basis for what later became the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].

== Belgium ==
{{main|3=Belgian Revolution}}
The territories of modern Belgium had been merged into the Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1815. Aside from various religious and socioeconomic tensions between the Dutch north and proto-Belgian south, over the 1920s a young generation of Belgians, heavily influenced by French Enlightenment ideas, had formulated criticisms of the Dutch monarchy as autocratic. The monarch enjoyed broad personal powers, his ministers were irresponsible before parliament; the separation of powers was minimal; freedom of press and association were limited; the principle of universal suffrage was undermined by the fact that theand the largely Catholic south, despite possessing two-thirds of the population, received as many seats to the Estates-General (parliament) as the smaller Protestant north; and the Dutch authorities were suspected of forcing Protestantism onto Catholics. These concerns combined to produce a pro-Catholic Radicalism distinct from both the anticlerical Radicalism of France, and the Protestant Liberalism of the Dutch north.

Following the political crisis of 1829, where the Crown Prince was named prime minister, a limited reform was introduced establishing constitutional rights, similar to the charter of rights of France's autocratic Restoration Monrachy; the Belgian Radicals, like their French counterparts, regarded such a charter of rights as insufficient, potentially revocable by a whim of the monarch. Belgian Radicals closely followed the situation in France when, on 26 July to 1 August 1930, a conservative-liberal [[July Revolution|revolution broke out]], overthrowing the autocratic monarchy for a [[July Monarchy|liberal constitutional monarchy]]. Within a month a revolt had erupted in Brussels before spreading to the rest of the Belgian provinces. With Belgian independence eventually guaranteed by the neighbouring powers, the Constitution of 1831 was drafted: this organic law established a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary regime, and provided a list of fundamental civil rights inspired by the French Declaration of the Right of Man.

As in Britain, Radicals in Belgium continued to operate within the Liberal Party, campaigning throughout the 19th Century for the property-restricted suffrage to be extended. This was extended a first time in 1883, and universal male suffrage was achieved in 1893 (though female suffrage would have to wait until 1919). After this Radicalism was a minor political force in Belgium, its role taken over by the emergence of a powerful [[Belgian Labour Party|social-democratic party]].

During the nineteenth century, the Radicals in France were the political group of the far-left, relative to the centre-left conservative-liberal republican "[[Opportunism|opportunists]]" (Gambetta), the centre-right conservative-liberal monarchist [[Orléanist]]s, the far-right monarchist [[Legitimists]], and the supporters of a republican military dictatorship,the [[Bonapartism|Bonapartists]].

Following the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and until [[1848 Revolutions in France|1848]], it was technically illegal to advocate [[republicanism]] openly. Some republicans reconciled themselves to pursuing liberalism through the socially-conservative monarchy --the 'opportunists'. Those who remained intransigent in believing that the French Revolution needed to be completed through a republican regime based on parliamentary democracy and universal suffrage therefore tended to call themselves "Radicals" - a term meaning 'Purists'.

Under the Second Republic (1848-52), the Radicals, on a platform of seeking a "social and democratic republic", sat together in parliament in a group named [[The Mountain (1849)|The Mountain]]. When [[Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte]] launched his [[Coup of 18 Brumaire|military coup]], Radicals across France rose up in insurrection to defend the democratic republic. This experience would mark French Radicalism for the next century, prompting permanent vigilance against all those who - from [[Patrice de MacMahon, Duke of Magenta|Marshall Mac-Mahon]] to [[Charles de Gaulle|General De Gaulle]] - were suspected of seeking to overthrow the constitutional, parliamentary regime.

After the return to parliamentary democracy in 1871, the Radicals emerged as a significant political force: led by [[Georges Clemenceau]], they claimed that the socially-conservative liberal republicanism of Léon Gambetta and Jules Ferry had drifted away from the ideals of the French Revolution, and that the Radicals were the true heirs to 1791. In 1881, they put forward their programme of broad social reforms: from then on, the tactic of the main Radical Party was to have 'no enemies to the left' of the Republic, allying with any group that sought social reform while accepting the legality of the parliamentary republic. 

But the Radicals were not yet a political party: they sat together in parliament out of kinship, but they possessed minimal organisation outside of parliament. The first half of the Third Republic saw several events that caused them to fear a far-right takeover of parliament that might end democracy, as Louis-Napoléon had: Mac-Mahon's self-coup in 1876, the Boulangist crisis in the 1880s, the Dreyfus Affair in the 1890s. The Radicals were swept to power in 1899 and finally managed to implement their long-standing programme of reforms, such as the separation of Church and State, or the introduction of secret ballotting. In order to ensure that their legacy would remain unreversed, they set up an extraparliamentary campaign organisation to help one-another in elections: the [[Radical Party (France)|Radical-Socialist Party]], the first major modern political party in French history.

The Radical–Socialist Party was the main governmental party of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] between 1901 and 1919, and dominated government again between 1924-26, 1932-33 and 1937-40; the centre-right governments dominated by the conservative-liberal centre-right often gave a portfolio to a Radical, who would join cabinet in a personal capacity as the most left-leaning minister.

The party itself was discredited after 1940, due to fact that many (though not all) of its parliamentarians had votedto establish the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]]. Under the dictatorship several prominent Radicals, such as the young left-leaning former education minister [[Jean Zay]], and the influential editorialist [[Maurice Sarraut]] (brother to the more famous Radical party leader [[Albert Sarraut|Albert]]), were assassinated by [[Milice|the regime's paramilitary police]], while others, notably [[Jean Moulin]], participated in the [[French Resistance|resistance movement]] to [[French Fourth Republic|restore the Republic]].

The [[Democratic and Socialist Union of the Resistance]] was established after [[World War II]] to combine the politics of French Radicalism with credibility derived from members' activism in the [[French resistance]].

In the 1950s, [[Pierre Mendès-France]] attempted to rebuilt the Radical Party as an alternative to both the Christian-democratic [[People's Republican Movement|MRP]], while also leading the opposition to [[Gaullism]] which he feared to be another attempt at a right-wing coup. During this period the Radicals frequently governed as part of a [[Third Force (France)|coalition of centrist parties]], spanning from the Socialists to the Christian-democrats. 

Ultimately the installation of the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] in 1958, and the subsequent emergence of a two-party system based on the Socialist and Gaullist movements, destroyed the niche for an autonomous Radical party. The Radical Party split into various tendencies. Its leading personality, Mendès-France himself, left in 1961 in protest at the party's acceptance of De Gaulle's military coup and joining the small social-democratic [[Unified Socialist Party (France)|Unified Socialist Party]]. A decade later, a second faction advocated maintaining an alliance with the Socialist-dominated coalition of the left; it broke away in 1972 to form the [[Radical Party of the Left]], which maintains close ties to the Socialist Party. The remainder of the original Radical Party became a de facto liberal-conservative party of the centre-right: renamed as the [[Radical Party (France)|'Valoisien' Radical Party]], it advocated alliances with the rest of the liberal centre-right, participating first in the pro-[[Giscard d'Estaing]] [[Union for French Democracy]] (1972), then with the [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[Union for a Popular Movement]] (2002).

== Continental Europe and Latin America == &lt;!--Linked from [[Democrats 66]]. --&gt;
{{unreferenced|section|date=September 2015}}
In continental [[Europe]] and [[Latin America]], as for instance in [[Liberalism and radicalism in Italy|Italy]], [[Liberalism and radicalism in Spain|Spain]], [[Liberalism and radicalism in Chile|Chile]] and [[Argentina]] ([[Radical Civic Union]]), Radicalism developed as an ideology in the 19th century to indicate those who supported at least in theory a [[republic]]an form of government, universal male suffrage and particularly, supported [[anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] policies.

In German-speaking countries, this current is known as [[:de:Freisinn|Freisinn]] (literally "free mind") , as in [[German Freeminded Party]] from 1884 to 1893, then [[Eugen Richter]]'s [[Freeminded People's Party (Germany)|Freeminded People's Party]]; and the [[Free Democratic Party of Switzerland]]). . However, by the twentieth century at the latest radicalism, which did not advocate particularly radical economic policies, had been overtaken as the principal ideology of the left by the growing popularity of [[socialism]] and had become an essentially centrist political movement (as far as "radicalism" survived as a distinct political ideology at all).

The 'Free-Minded' parties, located mainly in the Netherlands, Scandinavia and German-speaking countries, included:

* In Switzerland:
** the relatively left-leaning party known as the [[Radical Democratic Party of Switzerland|Radical-Democratic Party]] (French) and the Free-minded Democratic Party (German) (1878 to present)
** the relatively right-leaning party known as the [[Radical Liberal Party of Switzerland|Radical-Liberal Party]] (1893 to present)
* In the Netherlands:
**[[Free-thinking Democratic League|Free-minded Democratic League]], a political party in the Netherlands from 1901 to 1946

* In Germany, a succession of Radical parties existed: 
**The [[German Free-minded Party]] (1884 to 1893), which split into two sucessors:
**the left-leaning [[Free-minded Union]] (1893 to 1910)
**and the centre-leaning the [[Free-minded People's Party (Germany)|Free-minded People's Party]] (1893 to 1910)
**These merged as the [[Progressive People's Party (Germany)|Progressive People's Party]] (1910 to 1918)
**This was reformed as the [[German Democratic Party]] (1918 to 1930).
* In Scandinavia:
**In [[Denmark]], the current Liberal Party began as a Radical Party, hence its name in Danish ([[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre, 'Left')]]. The Radical wing split in 1905 to form a new party, known as[[Danish Social Liberal Party|Radikale Venstre]] (Radical Left).
** In Sweden, the [[Free-minded National Association]] (902 to 1934)
** In Norway, the [[Free-minded Liberal Party]] (1909 to 1932) and Free-minded People's Party (1932 to 1935)
** In Finland, the [[Liberal League (Finland)|Free-minded League]] (1951 to 1965)



In Mediterranean Europe, Radical parties were often labelled 'Democratic' liberal parties:

* In Spain, Radicalism took the form of various 'democratic', 'progressive' and 'radical' parties.
**the [[Democratic Party (Spain)|Democratic Party]] (1849-69) a Spanish progressive party of Jacobin inspiration, active in the 1850s.
**the Federal Democratic Republican Party (1868-1910)
**the Democratic Radical Party (1869-80) refounded as the Progressive Democratic Party (1880-1912)
**the successor Democratic Party (1876-9) reformed as the Possibilist Democratic Party (1879-90),
**the latter's successor  splinters and successors the  the , and the Progressive Republican Democratic Party
**The Radical-Republican Party (1908-40)
**The [[Radical Socialist Republican Party|Radical-Socialist Republican Party]] (1928-34) and [[Republican Left (Spain)|Republican Left]] (1934-59)
**The Republican Democratic Party and [[Republican Union (Spain, 1934)|Republican Union]] (1934-59)
*[[Democratic Party (Italy, 1913)]]

== Serbia and Montenegro ==
{{main|Liberalism and radicalism in Serbia}}
Radicalism had played a pivotal role in the birth and development of parliamentarism and the construction of the modern Serbian state leading to the Yugoslavian unification. The [[People's Radical Party]] formed in 1881 was the strongest political party and was in power in the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] more than all others together. The 1888 Constitution of the Kingdom of Serbia that defined it as an independent nation and formalised parliamentary democracy was among the most advanced in the entire world due to Radical contribution and it is known as ''The Radical Constitution''. In 1902, a crack had occurred in which the [[Independent Radical Party]] left and "the Olde" remained in the party, leading the original People's Radical Party to stray far from progressivism and into right-wing nationalism and conservatism. In the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the Independent Radicals united with the rest of the Serbian opposition and the liberal and civic groups in the rest of the new country, forming the [[Democratic Party (Yugoslavia)|Yugoslav Democratic Party]], while several Republican dissidents formed a Republican Party. The NRS had promoted Serb nationalism and put itself as the defender of Serb national interests. Democrats and Radicals were the dominant political parties, especially since the exclusion of the Communists.

In Montenegro, a [[People's Party (Montenegro)|People's Party]] was formed in 1907 as the country's first political party and remained the largest in the period of country's parliamentary history until the Yugoslavian unification. Later, a [[True People's Party]] was formed, which never got widespread popular support and whose bigger part had joined the original NS, but the difference was not ideological and instead was opposition and support of the Crown and sometimes in foreign relations to Serbia (the clubbists were the crown's dissidents and supporters of the people as well as Serbia as a regional power and brotherly ally—the rightists were generally anti-democratic and autocratic monarchist and also distrustful to the Serbian government's acts on the national plan).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12100">The '''Regional Security System''' ('''RSS''') is an international agreement for the defence and security of the eastern [[Caribbean]] region.
The Regional Security System was created in 1982 to counter threats to the stability of the region in the late 1970s and early 1980s. On 29 October four members of the [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]]—namely, [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Dominica]], [[St. Lucia]], and [[St. Vincent and the Grenadines]]—signed a [[memorandum of understanding]] (MOU) with [[Barbados]] to provide for "mutual assistance on request". The signatories agreed to prepare contingency plans and assist one another, on request, in national emergencies, prevention of smuggling, search and rescue, immigration control, fishery protection, customs and excise control, maritime policing duties, protection of off-shore installations, pollution control, national and other disasters and threats to national security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=APPROACHES ON SECURITY IN THE CARIBBEAN REGION: Statement by Ambassador Odeen Ishmael of Guyana at the Meeting of the Committee on Hemispheric Security of the OAS Washington DC, 29 October 2002|url=http://www.guyana.org/Speeches/ishmael_102902.html|accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]] joined following independence in 1983, and [[Grenada]] followed two years later after [[Operation Urgent Fury]], a combined U.S. and RSS invasion of the country. The MOU was updated in 1992 and the system acquired juridical status on {{date|March 5, 1996}} under the Treaty which was signed at [[St. Georges, Grenada]].

The RSS initially started as a U.S. instrument to combat the spread of Communism in the Caribbean region.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-3378.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=3GTcO_x9mg4C&amp;pg=PA66&amp;lpg=PA66&amp;dq=Security,%201979-1990#PPA66,M1 |title=Surviving Small Size: Regional Integration in Caribbean Ministates

The R.S.S., as it is commonly referred to, is based in Barbados at the [[Grantley Adams International Airport|Paragon Centre]], headed by many regional army chiefs. It mainly serves as a defence system for the Caribbean Sea, conducting many operations by detecting and combating cross-Atlantic and intra-Caribbean drug smuggling, protection of the sovereignty of the nations of the Caribbean, providing assistance to Caribbean countries at the request of governments and are usually the first to respond after natural disasters occur, such as hurricanes, floods and earthquakes.

==Free speech==
Seven Stories believes publishers have a special responsibility to defend free speech and human rights.

Seven Stories has introduced new translations of underappreciated classics like [[Ivan Goncharov]]’s ''Oblomov'', while also seeking works by emerging international voices, like Céline Curiol's ''Voice Over'', [[Johan Harstad]]’s ''[[Buzz Aldrin, What Happened To You in All The Confusion?]]'' and [[Andri Snær Magnason]]'s ''LoveStar'' and ''The Story of the Blue Planet''. Recent translations include ''Operation Massacre'' by [[Rodolfo Walsh]] and ''The Body Where I Was Born'' by Guadalupe Nettel.

==Siete Cuentos==
Launched in 2000, Seven Stories’ Spanish-language imprint, Siete Cuentos Editorial, represents an effort to introduce a selection English-language texts to Spanish-language readers. Siete Cuentos has published Spanish-language editions of ''[[Our Bodies, Ourselves]]'' (''Nuestros cuerpos, nuestras vidas'') and [[Howard Zinn]]’s ''A People’s History of the United States'' (''La otra historia de los Estados Unidos''.) Siete Cuentos has published new and classic works of literature by [[Ariel Dorfman]], including ''Death and the Maiden'' (''La muerte y la doncella'') and ''Heading South, Looking North'' (''Rumbo al sur, deseando el norte''), as well as fiction by [[Ángela Vallvey]] and Sonia Rivera-Valdés. Recent Spanish translations include [[Charles C. Mann]]'s 1491 (''Una nueva historia de la Americas antes de Colon'').

==Triangle Square, books for young readers==
The new imprint from Seven Stories Press was launched in 2012 and combines social justice and good storytelling to a reading audience of young adults and children.

{{Italic title|force=true}}
'''''The War We Never Fought: The British Establishment's Surrender to Drugs''''' is the sixth book by the British author and ''[[Mail on Sunday]]'' columnist [[Peter Hitchens]], first published in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.continuumbooks.com/books/detail.aspx?BookId=162211&amp;SubjectId=1023 |title=The War We Never Fought|publisher=continuumbooks.com |accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is intended as a rebuttal of what Hitchens sees as the widespread acceptance of drug use and the weakening of drug prohibition in Britain since the [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971]], when a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Heath ministry|government]] adopted a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] policy to implement the [[Wootton Report]]. Hitchens believes that there is de facto [[Decriminalisation of illegal drugs|decriminalisation]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;of drugs in the UK, especially of cannabis,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hitchensblog.mailonsunday.co.uk/2016/04/top-politician-admits-it-there-is-de-facto-decriminalisation-of-cannabis.html|title=Top Politician Admits it - There *is* de facto decriminalisation of Cannabis - Mail Online - Peter Hitchens blog|website=hitchensblog.mailonsunday.co.uk|access-date=2016-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; contrary to claims of drug "prohibition" from "Big Dope" (name he gives to the cannabis legalisation lobby).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hitchensblog.mailonsunday.co.uk/2016/04/what-war-on-drugs-what-prohibition-will-the-bbc-take-any-notice-of-its-own-research-.html|title=What 'War on Drugs'? What 'Prohibition?' Will the BBC take any notice of its own research?  - Mail Online - Peter Hitchens blog|website=hitchensblog.mailonsunday.co.uk|access-date=2016-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchens contends that it is only through much harsher and more stringent punishment – for both consumers and dealers of drugs – that any [[war on drugs]] can be successful.&lt;ref name="Drug Culture"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hitchens|first=Peter|title=Drug Culture|url=http://iai.tv/video/drug-culture|publisher=IAI|accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Hitchens first announced ''The War We Never Fought'''s publication in 2011, and stated that the book would examine "the secret surrender of the British establishment to the cannabis lobby in the late 1960s, and the results of this surrender".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hitchensblog.mailonsunday.co.uk/2011/06/a-new-challenge-on-drugs.html |first=Peter|last=Hitchens|title=A New Challenge on Drugs|publisher=mailonsunday.co.uk |date=30 June 2011 |accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the book's publication, Hitchens had often advocated in his writing a society governed by conscience and the [[rule of law]], which he sees as the best guarantee of [[liberty]], and he had also frequently and at length voiced opposition to the [[Decriminalization|decriminalisation]] of [[recreational drug use|recreational drugs]] (arguing that the legal prohibition of drug use is an essential counterweight to "pro-drug propaganda"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hitchensblog.mailonsunday.co.uk/2012/01/the-cannabis-cult.html |title=The Cannabis Cult|publisher=mailonsunday.co.uk |date=30 January 2012 |accessdate=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hitchensblog.mailonsunday.co.uk/2009/11/arguments-against-legalising-drugs.html |title=Arguments against legalising drugs|publisher=mailonsunday.co.uk |date=9 November 2009 |accessdate=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and had debated a number of figures who are for such decriminalisation, including Christopher Snowdon of the [[Institute of Economic Affairs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.org.uk/events/drugs-the-war-we-never-fought |title=Drugs: The War We Never Fought |publisher=Iea.org.uk |date=16 May 2012 |accessdate=5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Howard Marks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hitchensblog.mailonsunday.co.uk/2007/11/free-speech-is.html |title=Free speech is for nasty people, not nice ones |publisher=mailonsunday.co.uk |author=Hitchens, Peter|date=27 November 2007 |accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://my.telegraph.co.uk/jaydeeay/asp/28/howard-marks-vs-peter-hitchens/ |title=Howard Marks vs Peter Hitchens |work=My Telegraph |author=Aspinall, John|date=30 October 2012 |accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also debated the topic of drugs with the comedian [[Russell Brand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Quinn, Ben |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/11/russell-brand-urges-less-methadone-clinics |title=Russell Brand urges move away from methadone clinics to treat addicts |work=The Guardian |date=11 August 2012 |accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchens had claimed attempts to combat drug use by restricting supply and prosecuting drug dealers were futile, unless possession and use were also punished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hitchens, Peter |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2042046/What-Labour-won-t-ought-do.html |title=What Labour won't do, and ought to do|publisher= mailonsunday.co.uk |date=26 September 2011 |accessdate=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2012, he gave evidence to the Parliamentary [[Home Affairs Select Committee]] as part of its inquiry into drugs policy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliamentlive.tv/Main/Player.aspx?meetingId=10674&amp;st=12:07:25 |title=HoC Home Affairs Committee – Drugs |publisher=parliamentlive.tv |date=24 April 2012 |accessdate=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and called for the British government to introduce a more hardline policy on drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17829394 |title=Hitchens urges tough drugs policy |publisher=BBC |date=24 April 2012 |accessdate=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cover image is an obvious take on the album cover for ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''.

==Critical reception==
A month before ''The War We Never Fought'''s publication, [[Ed West (journalist)|Ed West]] in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' said that the book had provoked criticism not only from the [[Left-wing politics|Left]], but also from the [[free-market]] [[libertarianism|libertarian]] [[Right-wing politics|Right]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=West |first=Ed |url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/edwest/100178587/libertarians-and-conservatives-an-odd-couple/ |title=Libertarians and conservatives – an odd couple |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=30 August 2012 |accessdate=5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect]]'' magazine, [[Peter Lilley]] wrote that Hitchens "realises there are only two logically coherent policies: prohibition and legalisation. Decriminalisation, the fashionable option of the intelligentsia, makes no sense, though it is the destination which policy in this country has moved towards for several decades" and "the most refreshing aspect of this book is its recognition that drug taking is fundamentally a moral issue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lilley |first=Peter |url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/drugs-legalisation-peter-hitchens-peter-lilley/ |title=Drugs haze |publisher=prospectmagazine.co.uk |date= 17 October 2012|accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A largely positive review by William Dove in the ''[[International Business Times]]'' stated that, "Hitchens makes a convincing case that the anti-drug laws are not unenforceable as legalisers might claim, but unenforced".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/396862/20121022/war-never-fought-peter-hitchens-review.htm |title=The War We Never Fought, by Peter Hitchens: Review|work=International Business Times|first=William|last=Dove |date=22 October 2012 |accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a very critical review in ''[[The Observer]]'', [[Nicholas Lezard]] stated that the book "should never have been published",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lezard, Nicholas|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/14/narcomania-review-war-never-fought?INTCMP=SRCH |title= The War We Never Fought by Peter Hitchens – review|work=The Guardian |date=14 October 2012|accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
while [[Jonathan Rée]] in ''[[The Guardian]]'' dismissed the book as "hysterical" and accused its author of "moral racism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rée, Jonathan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/26/war-never-fought-peter-hitchens-review |title=The War We Never Fought by Peter Hitchens – review |work=The Guardian |date=26 October 2012 |accessdate=6 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chris Mullin (politician)|Chris Mullin]], writing in the ''[[Mail on Sunday]]'', praised much of the book, describing it as a "magnificent – and well-researched – rant against Establishment 'appeasers', who, he [Hitchens] believes, have opened the door to perdition." Mullin however took issue with the solutions to the problem Hitchens prescribes in the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mullin, Chris |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/books/article-2228652/A-lonely-fighter-war-end.html |title=A lonely fighter in a war that has no end|work=Daily Mail |date= 6 November 2012|accessdate=6 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Translation Centre for the Bodies of the European Union''' (CdT) is an [[Agencies of the European Union|EU agency]] based in Luxembourg. Its primary role is to cater for the diverse multilingual communication needs of the EU agencies and other EU bodies. In addition, it may be called upon by the [[Institutions of the European Union|EU institutions]] to absorb any surplus work they may have.

The Centre also contributes to interinstitutional cooperation between the EU’s various translation services with the aim of promoting the use of EU terminology and the sharing of best practices and tools in the language field.

The Centre provides services in the 24 [[Languages of the European Union|official EU languages]] and in various non-EU languages, involving over 700 language combinations in total.

== Mission ==
The Centre has a two-fold mission. The first one is to provide language services to the decentralised EU bodies (mainly EU agencies), as well as to the EU institutions whenever necessary, on the basis of a cooperation agreement signed with each client. The Centre’s second mission is to contribute to interinstitutional cooperation between the EU’s various translation services with the aim of rationalising working methods and harmonising procedures.

== InterActive Terminology for Europe (IATE) ==
As part of its second mission, the Centre manages [[Inter-Active Terminology for Europe|IATE]], the largest terminology database in the world, on behalf of the EU institutions. 

== Legal background ==
The Regulation (Council Regulation (EC) No 2965/94) establishing the Centre was adopted by the Council of the European Union in November 1994. It was revised on two occasions: firstly, in 1995 (Council Regulation (EC) No 2610/95), to extend the Centre’s activities to those institutions and bodies that have a translation service and to strengthen interinstitutional cooperation in the field of translation; and, secondly, in 2003 (Council Regulation (EC) No 1645/2003), to bring certain provisions into line with the Council Regulation on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities.

== Governance ==
The Centre is governed by a Management Board with representatives from the Member States, its clients and two representatives from the European Commission. The Chairman of the Management Board is Rytis Martikonis, Director-General of the Directorate-General for Translation of the European Commission.

The Centre’s legal representative is the Director, Máire Killoran, who is responsible for its day-to-day administration and who reports to the Centre’s Management Board.

== EU Agencies Network ==
The Translation Centre is a member of the EU Agencies Network. The EU Agencies were set up by the EU Member States and the EU institutions to provide services to industries and citizens and carry out specific legal, technical or scientific tasks under EU law.

'''V-Partei3''', known officially as '''V-Partei³ – Party for Change, Vegetarians and Vegans''' ({{lang-de|V-Partei³ – Partei für Veränderung, Vegetarier und Veganer}}) is a [[German political parties|German political party]] that started in April 2016. The principal focus of the party is animal rights and environmentalism. It is the sole political party in Germany devoted to encouraging the adoption of a plant-based diet. The party took part in the [[North Rhine-Westphalia state election, 2017|North Rhine-Westphalia state elections in 2017]], and received 10,013 votes or 0.12% of the vote, far below the [[election threshold|5% threshold]] required to enter the [[Landtag of North Rhine-Westphalia|State Landtag]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wahlergebnisse.nrw.de/landtagswahlen/2017/aktuell/a000lw1700.shtml|title=Landtagswahl 2017 in NRW|author=|date=|website=www.wahlergebnisse.nrw.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable members of the party are actress [[Barbara Rütting]] and Axel Ritt, guitarist of the band [[Grave Digger (band)|Grave Digger]], who joined in May 2017.

==Party program==
In the party manifesto created for the [[German federal election, 2017|2017 Bundestag elections]] focuses on improving animal welfare conditions in Germany and changing existing government policies so that Germany reduces its consumption of meat. The manifesto focuses on 10 key areas, and some are noted below.



===Animal testing===
The party opposes the testing of animals and as such, wants to end the practice entirely. The platform instead advocates for cruelty-free medical research, which includes the use of human simulation.&lt;ref name="v-partei.de"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://v-partei.de/vparteihoch3/parteiprogramm/|title=Parteiprogramm|author=|date=|website=v-partei.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transport policy===
The party supports projects that increase the use of bicycles as an eco-friendly way of travelling. V-Partei³ also want to introduce speed limits on roads in an attempt to reduce air pollution. Their manifesto advocates a 130&amp;nbsp;km/h speed limit on highways and general speed limits elsewhere.&lt;ref name="v-partei.de"/&gt;

===Energy policy===
The party want to see an end to [[nuclear power]], a reduction in the number of coal-fired and biogas power plants and greater subsidies for renewable energy, with the aim of reaching 100% renewable in the next few decades.&lt;ref&gt;https://v-partei.de/wp-content/uploads/Parteiprogramm-2017-hellgruene-Zukunft.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic policy===
The V-Partei³ opposes any [[genetic engineering]] in agriculture. The party opposes [[TTIP]], which they say softens labour rights and causes climate destruction. They advocated a [[basic income]] on the following grounds:
* It must be a living wage. 
* There must be an individual entitlement. 
* The income must not be means-tested. 
* It must be made available without any work obligation.

The '''''V sign''''' is a hand [[gesture]] in which the [[index finger|index]] and [[middle finger]]s are raised and parted, while the other fingers are clenched. It has various meanings, depending on the cultural context and how it is presented.

When displayed with the palm inward toward the signer, it has long been an offensive gesture in some [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth nations]]. In the 1940s, during the [[Second World War]], a campaign by the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] to use the sign with the back of the hand toward the signer ({{Unichar|270C|Victory hand}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emojipedia.org/victory-hand/ |title=Victory Hand|work=emojipedia.org Emojipedia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Unicode]]) as a "V for Victory" sign proved quite effective.  During the [[Vietnam War]], in the 1960s, the "V sign" was widely adopted by the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] as a [[Peace symbols|symbol of peace]]. Shortly thereafter, it also became adopted as a gesture used in photographs, especially in [[Japan]].

==Usage==

[[File:Steve McQueen.jpg|thumb|American actor [[Steve McQueen]] flashing the V sign (for peace) for a mugshot, after being arrested for drunk driving (1972)]]
The meaning of the V sign is partially dependent on the manner in which the hand is positioned:

* With the back of the hand facing the signer (palm of the hand facing the observer), it can mean:
** The number '2'.
** Victory – in a setting of wartime or competition.

** Peace, or friend – used around the world by peace and counter-culture groups; popularized in the American [[peace movement]] of the 1960s.

** This hand shape is also used in a number of signs in many [[sign languages]], including (in American Sign Language) "to look" (with the palm down) or "to see" (palm up). When the pointer and middle fingers are pointed at the signer's eyes then turned and the pointer finger is pointed at someone it means "I am watching you." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-signs/s/see.htm|title="see" American Sign Language (ASL)|work=lifeprint.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "two-fingered salute" (also "the forks" in Australia&lt;ref&gt;Tony Keim [http://www.couriermail.com.au/lifestyle/tradition-behind-the-bird/story-e6frer4f-1111118071016 "Long tradition of flipping the bird"], ''Courier Mail'', November 18, 2008, accessed April 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;) is commonly performed by flicking the V upwards from wrist or elbow. The V sign, when the palm is facing toward the person giving the sign, has long been an insulting gesture in England,&lt;ref name=BSC-HV&gt;Staff [https://web.archive.org/web/20080607024254/http://www.britishshakespearecompany.com/synopsis.html Henry V], [[British Shakespeare Company]].Accessed 23 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and later in the rest of the [[United Kingdom]], Ireland, Australia, India, Pakistan and New Zealand.&lt;ref name=V-sign-as-an-insult/&gt; It is frequently used to signify defiance (especially to authority), contempt, or derision.&lt;ref&gt;Defiance, contempt or derision:

As an example of the V sign (palm inward) as an insult, on November 1, 1990, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', a British [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]], ran an article on its front page with the headline "Up Yours, Delors" next to a large hand making a V sign protruding from a [[Union Jack]] cuff. ''The Sun'' urged its readers to stick two fingers up at then President of the [[European Commission]], [[Jacques Delors]], who had advocated an EU central government. The article attracted a number of complaints about its alleged racism, but the now defunct [[Press Council (UK)|Press Council]] rejected the complaints after the editor of ''The Sun'' stated that the paper reserved the right to use vulgar abuse in the interests of Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sterlingtimes.org/delors.jpg |title=Up Yours Delors |work=The Sun |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-10-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026073929/http://www.sterlingtimes.org/delors.jpg |archivedate=2011-10-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wheeler |first=Brian |url=http://newswww.bbc.net.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/4124328.stm |title=BBC NEWS &amp;#124; Politics &amp;#124; From two jags to two fingers |publisher=Newswww.bbc.net.uk |date=2005-06-24 |accessdate=2011-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 3, 2009, Scottish football players [[Barry Ferguson]] and [[Allan McGregor]] were permanently banned from the [[Scotland national football team|Scottish national squad]] for showing the V sign while sitting on the bench during the game against Iceland. Both players were in their hotel bar drinking alcohol after the Scottish defeat to The Netherlands until around 11&amp;nbsp;am the next morning, meaning that both of the players breached the SFA discipline code before the incident as well, but the attitude shown by the V sign was considered to be so rude that the [[Scottish Football Association|SFA]] decided never to include these players in the national line-up again.&lt;ref name="Daily Mail"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1167078/Finished-Furious-Walter-tells-disgraced-pair-Rangers-days-over.html|title=Finished: Furious Walter tells disgraced pair their Rangers days are over | location=London | work=Daily Mail | date=3 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/apr/03/barry-ferguson-allan-mcgregor-banned Barry Ferguson and Allan McGregor banned for life by Scotland], The Guardian, Friday 3 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Ferguson also lost the captaincy of [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] as a result of the controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/6223023.stm | work=BBC News | title=Gers strip Ferguson of captaincy | date=1 January 2007 | accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; McGregor's ban was lifted by then SFA manager [[Craig Levein]] and he returned to Scotland national squad in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1299611/Allan-McGregor-recalled-Scotland-squad-face-Sweden.html|title=Allen McGregor recalled to Scotland squad to face Sweden|date=August 2, 2010|publisher=The Daily Mail|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/8876685.stm|title=Sweden 3-0 Scotland|date=August 11, 2010|publisher=BBC|accessdate=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steve McQueen]] gives the sign in the closing scene of the 1971 motorsport movie, [[Le Mans (film)|''Le Mans'']]. A still picture of the gesture&lt;ref&gt;http://stvmcqueen.tripod.com/salute.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; was recorded by photographer Nigel Snowdon and has become an icon of both McQueen and the film itself. The gesture was also flashed by [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]] (played by [[James Marsters]]) in "[[Hush (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Hush]]", a Season 4 episode of ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''. The scene was also featured in the series' [[opening credits]] for all of Season 5. It was [[censorship|censored]] by [[BBC Two]] only in its early-evening showings of the program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radar/BuffyTheVampireSlayer Radar: ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'', Season 4 – TV Tropes]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mar96qd8mq1ruo8w6o1_1280.png Still photograph of the gesture in the Season 5 opening credits of ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'']&lt;/ref&gt;

For a time in the UK, "a Harvey (Smith)" became a way of describing the insulting version of the V sign, much as "[[Word of Cambronne|the word of Cambronne]]" is used in France, or "the [[Pierre Trudeau|Trudeau]] salute" is used to describe the [[the finger|one-fingered salute]] in Canada. This happened because, in 1971, show-jumper [[Harvey Smith (equestrian)|Harvey Smith]] was disqualified for making a televised V sign to the judges after winning the British Show Jumping Derby at [[All England Jumping Course at Hickstead|Hickstead]]. His win was reinstated two days later.&lt;ref&gt;Staff [http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/15/newsid_2534000/2534107.stm On this Day 15 August 1971: 'V-sign' costs rider victory] "BBC The infamous gesture won him an entry in the Chambers dictionary which defined 'a Harvey Smith' as 'a V-sign with the palm inwards, signifying derision and contempt'". Accessed 23 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Harvey Smith pleaded that he was using a Victory sign, a defence also used by other figures in the public eye.&lt;ref name=iocns&gt;Staff.

Accessed 23 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sometimes foreigners visiting the countries mentioned above use the "two-fingered salute" without knowing it is offensive to the natives, for example when ordering two beers in a noisy pub, or in the case of the United States president [[George H. W. Bush]], who, while touring Australia in 1992, attempted to give a "peace sign" to a group of farmers in [[Canberra]]—who were protesting about U.S. farm subsidies—and instead gave the insulting V sign.&lt;ref&gt;[[Webster Griffin Tarpley]] and [[Anton Chaitkin]] (2004). George Bush: The Unauthorized Biography, Progressive Press paperback edition (2004), p. 651(web link to [http://tarpley.net/online-books/george-bush-the-unauthorized-biography/chapter-25-thyroid-storm/ Chapter -XXV- Thyroid Storm]). Tarpley &amp; Chaitkin cite the [[Washington Post]], 3 January 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins===
A commonly repeated legend claims that the two-fingered salute or V sign derives from a gesture made by [[Welsh longbow|longbowmen]] fighting in the English and Welsh&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishbattles.com/100-years-war/agincourt.htm|title=The Hundred Years War: Battle of Agincourt|work=britishbattles.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; archers at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] (1415) during the [[Hundred Years' War]], but no historical [[primary source]]s support this contention.&lt;ref&gt;David Wilton, ''Word Myths: Debunking Linguistic Urban Legends'', Oxford University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-19-537557-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This origin legend states that archers who were captured by the French had their [[Index finger|index]] and [[Middle finger|middle]] fingers cut off so that they could no longer operate their longbows, and that the V sign was used by uncaptured and victorious archers in a display of defiance against the enemy. However, it was common practice in warfare of that period to [[summary execution|summarily execute]] common soldiers, since they held no ransom value.

Alternatively, there is evidence against this interpretation as the chronicler [[Jean de Wavrin]], contemporary of the [[battle of Agincourt]], reports that the captured archers would have three fingers cut, and not two.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bshistorian.wordpress.com/2007/07/02/two-fingers-up-to-english-history/|title=Two fingers up to English history…|date=2007-07-02|website=The BS Historian|access-date=2017-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k50254g|title=A collection of the chronicles and ancient histories of Great Britain, now called England. 2.

The first unambiguous evidence of the use of the insulting V sign in the United Kingdom dates to 1901, when a worker outside Parkgate ironworks in [[Rotherham]] used the gesture (captured on the film) to indicate that he did not like being filmed.&lt;ref name=icons&gt;Staff.

Between 1975 and 1977 a group of anthropologists including [[Desmond Morris]] studied the history and spread of European gestures and found the rude version of the V-sign to be basically unknown outside the British Isles. In his ''Gestures: Their Origins and Distribution'', published in 1979, Morris discussed various possible origins of this sign but came to no definite conclusion:

{{quote|because of the strong taboo associated with the gesture (its public use has often been heavily penalised). As a result, there is a tendency to shy away from discussing it in detail. It is "known to be dirty" and is passed on from generation to generation by people who simply accept it as a recognised obscenity without bothering to analyse it... Several of the rival claims are equally appealing. The truth is that we will probably never know...&lt;ref name=icons/&gt;}}

==Victory sign==
=== Second World War: V for Victory campaign ===

On 14 January 1941, [[Victor de Laveleye]], former Belgian Minister of Justice and director of the [[Radio Belgique|Belgian French-language broadcasts]] on the [[BBC]] (1940–44), suggested in a broadcast that Belgians use a V for ''{{lang|fr|victoire}}'' (French: “victory”) and ''{{lang|nl|vrijheid}}'' (Dutch: "freedom") as a rallying emblem during the [[Second World War]]. 

In the BBC broadcast, de Laveleye said that "the occupier, by seeing this sign, always the same, infinitely repeated, [would] understand that he is surrounded, encircled by an immense crowd of citizens eagerly awaiting his first moment of weakness, watching for his first failure." Within weeks chalked up Vs began appearing on walls throughout [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Northern France]].&lt;ref name=radio&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050312223729/http://home.luna.nl/~arjan-muil/radio/history/ww-2/v-campaign.html The V-campaign], Virtual Radiomuseum&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Churchill V sign HU 55521.jpg|thumb|upright=1.01|[[Winston Churchill]], British prime minister, giving a V sign in 1943.]]
Buoyed by this success, the BBC started the "V for Victory" campaign, for which they put in charge the assistant news editor [[Douglas Ritchie]] posing as “Colonel Britton”. Ritchie suggested an audible V using its [[Morse code]] rhythm (three dots and a dash). As the rousing opening bars of [[Beethoven's Fifth Symphony]] had the same rhythm, the BBC used this as its call-sign in its foreign language programmes to occupied Europe for the rest of the war. The more musically educated also understood that it was the Fate motif "''[[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)#Fate motif|knocking on the door]]''" of the [[Third Reich]].

By July 1941, the emblematic use of the letter V had spread through occupied Europe. On 19 July, Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] referred approvingly to the V for Victory campaign in a speech,&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite news | work=news.bbc.co.uk | title=Newswatch 1940s | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/newswatch/history/noflash/html/1940s.stm | accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; from which point he started using the V hand sign. Early on he sometimes gestured palm in (sometimes with a cigar between the fingers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.number-10.gov.uk/files/images/wc%20outside%20D%20st.jpg|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071202022237/http://www.number-10.gov.uk/files/images/wc%20outside%20D%20st.jpg |archivedate=December 2, 2007 |title=Churchill outside Downing Street |publisher=Number-10.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the war, he used palm out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.number-10.gov.uk/files/images/WC%20V%20sign1.jpg|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613151055/http://www.number-10.gov.uk/files/images/WC%20V%20sign1.jpg|archivedate=2007-06-13 |title=Churchill's famous victory sign |publisher=Number-10.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; After aides explained to the aristocratic Churchill what the palm in gesture meant to other classes, he made sure to use the appropriate sign.&lt;ref name=iocns/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff|url=http://postalheritage.org.uk/page/icons-vsign|title=The V Sign|work=The British Postal Museum &amp; Archive (BPMA)|access-date=2011-12-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406161458/http://postalheritage.org.uk/page/icons-vsign|archive-date=2012-04-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the ''double-entendre'' of the gesture might have contributed to its popularity, "for a simple twist of hand would have presented the dorsal side in a mocking snub to the common enemy".&lt;ref&gt;James Jerman, Anthony Weir, ''Images of Lust: Sexual Carvings on Medieval Churches'' London: Routledge, 2013, page 145.&lt;/ref&gt; Other allied leaders used the sign as well.

The Germans could not remove all the signs, so adopted the V Sign as a German symbol, sometimes adding laurel leaves under it, painting their own V's on walls, vehicles and adding a massive V on the [[Eiffel Tower]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In 1942, [[Aleister Crowley]], a British occultist, claimed to have invented the usage of a V-sign in February 1941 as a magical foil to the [[Nazi swastika|Nazis' use of the Swastika]]. He maintained that he passed this to friends at the [[BBC]], and to the British [[Naval Intelligence Division]] through his connections in [[MI5]], eventually gaining the approval of [[Winston Churchill]]. Crowley noted that his 1913 publication ''[[Magick (Book 4)]]'' featured a V-sign and a swastika on the same plate.&lt;ref&gt;Kaczynski, Richard. ''Perdurabo: The Life of Aleister Crowley''. North Atlantic Books, 2010, p. 511.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vietnam War, victory, and peace===
[[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Richard Nixon]] used the gesture to signal victory in the Vietnam War, an act which became one of his best-known trademarks. He also used it on his departure from public office following his [[Watergate scandal|resignation]] in 1974.

Protesters against the [[Vietnam War]] (and subsequent anti-war protests) and [[counterculture]] activists adopted the gesture as a sign of peace. Because the hippies of the day often flashed this sign (palm out) while saying "Peace", it became popularly known (through association) as "the peace sign".&lt;ref name=icons-asian-peace&gt;Staff.

==As a photography pose==

===Japan===
The V sign, primarily palm-outward, is very commonly made by [[Japanese people]], especially younger people, when posing for informal photographs, and is known as  {{nihongo||ピースサイン|pīsu sain|peace sign}}, or more commonly simply {{nihongo||ピース|pīsu|peace}}. As the name reflects, this dates to the Vietnam War era and anti-war activists, though the precise origin is disputed. The V sign was known in Japan from the post-[[World War II]] [[Allied occupation of Japan]], but did not acquire the use in photographs until later.
[[File:Amusement Girls 2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.02|Young Japanese women giving V gesture in [[Ikebukuro]] (2010)]]
In Japan, it is generally believed to have been influenced by [[Beheiren]]'s anti-Vietnam War activists in the late 1960s and a [[Konica]] camera advertisement in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ameblo.jp/skip9/image-10568598135-10600580586.html|title=雑誌に載ったわたし。|work=日刊「きのこ」　skipのブログ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nendai-ryuukou.com/1970/1971.htm 1971's buzzwords]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; A more colorful account of this practice claims it was influenced by the American figure skater [[Janet Lynn]] during the [[1972 Winter Olympics]] in [[Sapporo]], [[Hokkaidō]]. She fell during a free-skate period, but continued to smile even as she sat on the ice. Though she placed third in the competition, her cheerful diligence and persistence resonated with many Japanese viewers. Lynn became an overnight [[Gaijin tarento|foreign celebrity in Japan]]. A peace activist, Lynn frequently flashed the V sign when she was covered in [[Media of Japan|Japanese media]], and she is credited by some Japanese for having popularized its use since the 1970s in amateur photographs.&lt;ref name=icons-asian-peace/&gt;

===Other East Asian countries===
[[Image:JaniceVidal image.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cantopop]] singer Janice Vidal (right) posing next to her own wax figure (left) in [[Madame Tussauds Hong Kong]].]]
In Mainland China, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Taiwan, the V sign is a popular pose in photographs. It is used in both casual and formal settings. For the most part in these countries, the gesture is divorced from its previous meanings as a peace sign or as an insult; for most the meaning of the sign is "victory" or "yeah", implying a feeling of happiness. It is used in both directions (palm facing the signer and palm facing forward). In certain contexts the sign simply means "two", such as when ordering or boarding a bus.

The pose is gaining significant popularity in South Korea due to the common usage amongst [[Kpop idol]]s and young people – especially in [[selfie]]s. V signing is commonly linked with [[aegyo]], a popular trend in Korea meaning "acting cutely".

===Elsewhere===
[[File:5th Day - 3V.jpg|thumb|Iranian women during the Green Revolution, 2009]]
In the United States, the usage of the V sign as a photography gesture is known but not widely used. The original poster for the 2003 film ''[[What a Girl Wants (film)|What a Girl Wants]]'' showed star [[Amanda Bynes]] giving a V sign as an American girl visiting [[London]]. In the US, the poster was altered to instead show Bynes with both arms down, to avoid giving the perception that the film was criticizing the then-recently commenced [[Iraq War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20363549_440739,00.html|work=Entertainment Weekly|title=Sign of the Times|first=Rebecca|last=Ascher-Walsh|date=Apr 11, 2003|accessdate=February 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific uses==
* In Argentina, the V sign, besides "victory", is linked to a political movement, [[Peronism]].
* In South Africa, after the Nationalist Party won the 1948 election with fewer voters than the opposition, Vs appeared as graffiti representing the word "Volkswil" (will of the people) and thereby questioning the results.
* [[University of Southern California]], [[University of Virginia]], [[The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley]], and [[Villanova University]] students, alumni, and fans "throw their Vs up" by tradition and as a sign of pride in their university and its athletic teams. The V sign in this form frequently accompanies the motto "Fight on!" at USC. 
* V sign, especially when printed in green, is a sign of the [[Iranian Green Movement]].
* Following the first elections in Iraq after the U.S. invasion, a photo of a woman showing the V sign with one of her fingers dipped in purple ink became very well-known and was widely circulated. The ink is used to identify individuals who have already voted.
* In [[Poland]], during the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity movement]], protesters showed the V sign meaning they would defeat Communism.&lt;ref name="Francisco 2010"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Francisco | first1 = Ronald | title = Collective Action Theory and Empirical Evidence | edition = 1 | publisher = Springer | year = 2010 | pages = 46 | isbn = 978-1-4419-1475-0 | quote = Subtle gestures, noise, and artwork are additional symbolic signs that dissidents use in coercive countries. Poland's Solidarity's signal was two fingers held up in the form of the letter V. This gesture diffused widely in Eastern Europe and now it is used in Palestine as a symbol of unity and nationalism.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After partially free elections, when [[Tadeusz Mazowiecki]] was chosen as prime minister (August 24, 1989), he went to the MPs with the V sign, which was transmitted on TV.&lt;ref name="NST 1989-09-13"&gt;{{cite news | title = End to 45 years of Red rule | date = 1989-09-13 | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IWNPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=SJADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6856%2C3067102 | work = New Straits Times | accessdate = 2012-01-29 | quote = Tadeusz Mazowlecki, who nearly fainted during his opening speech, flashed a V-for-victory sign as deputies voted his Cabinet into office by 402–0 with 13 abstentions.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes shown during debates about the fall of Communism.
* In Romania, the sign represents victory and has been used as an extension of the [[Roman salute]] to announce that victory has been achieved. It was used heavily during the Romanian revolution after the ousting of [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]]. [[Mircea Dinescu]] is appearing in the first transmission of the Romanian Television after the revolutionaries occupied it shouting "We won!" and flashing the victory sign.
* During the [[Yugoslav Wars]], Croatian and Bosnian troops and paramilitary militia used the sign as a greeting or an informal salute. U.S. and NATO peacekeepers stationed in Bosnia were forbidden to use the V-sign (peace symbol) to avoid upsetting or offending Serbs they might encounter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/bosnia/army/bosbuch.html#religion |title=A Soldier's Guide: Bosnia-Herzegovina |publisher=Dtic.mil |date= |accessdate=2011-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Vietnam, the V sign means "hello" since the [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] word for the number "2" sounds like the English pronunciation of the greeting "hi".
* [[Ringo Starr]] of the [[Beatles]] uses the V sign extensively while quoting the phrase "Peace and Love" as a sort of [[catchphrase]].
* A variation is to put the V sign with the fingers on either side of the [[mouth]] (usually with the [[knuckle]]s facing the observer) and to stick the [[tongue]] out. Most of the time the tongue is wriggled around. This is used to signify [[cunnilingus]] and the gesture is often [[off-colour]].
* A partially obscured V sign can be added to someone else's head to produce devil's horns or "bunny ears" for an amusing photo. In September 2013, [[Manu Tuilagi]] apologised to Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] after making a "bunny ears" sign behind his head in a photo taken during a visit by the [[British and Irish Lions]] squad to Downing Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/international/britishandirishlionsrugby/10313911/Manu-Tuilagi-forced-to-apologise-for-playing-prank-on-Prime-Minister-David-Cameron-in-No-10-visit.html|title= Manu Tuilagi forced to apologise for playing prank on Prime Minister David Cameron in No 10 visit|date=17 September 2013|work=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Indonesia, candidate of presidential election Joko Widodo use that sign for political campaign. The sign called "Salam Dua Jari".{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}
* In Belgium, the [[New Flemish Alliance]] (N-VA) political party uses it as a rallying gesture. During the taking the oath of the actual Belgian federal government, three N-VA ministers used the V sign instead of the formal three-fingers sign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtl.be/info/belgique/politique/1131881/prestation-de-serment-trois-n-va-font-le-v-signe-de-la-victoire-et-de-ralliement-de-leur-parti|title=Prestation de serment: trois N-VA font le 'V', signe de la victoire et de ralliement de leur parti (vidéo) |publisher=RTL Newmedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Vice president|Vice President]] of the [[Russia|Russian Federation]]''' (before 25 December 1991 - '''Vice President of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]]''') was the first in the presidential line of succession, becoming the new [[President of Russia]] upon the death, resignation, or removal of the president. Additionally, the vice president would assume the presidential duties in case the president becomes incapable of carrying out the presidential duties.

==Eligibility==
According to the article 121-2 of the [[Wikisource:ru:Конституция Российской Федерации - России 1978 года (в редакции 10 декабря 1992 года)|Russian Constitution of 1978]], a citizen of Russia, no younger than 35 years old and no older than 65 years old, who is in possession of suffrage, may be elected vice president. The vice president shall not be people's deputy, or hold any other offices in state or public bodies as well as in businesses.

==Election==
The vice president was elected simultaneously with the president. A candidate for vice president was nominated by a candidate for president.

==Duties==
The vice president executed individual assignments on a commission of the president and acted for the president in his absence or in case when it would be impossible for the president to attend to his duties.

==Abolishment==
Following [[1993 Russian constitutional crisis]] the office was abolished. The position of the [[Prime Minister of Russia]] became the second-highest ranking public office, and in the event of the president's incapacitation, death or resignation, the prime minister would assume the presidential powers and duties as acting president. This was evidenced in the succession of then-prime minister [[Vladimir Putin]] to the presidential powers and duties after the resignation of [[Boris Yeltsin]], due to illness, on December 31, 1999.

'''Social Equality Justice day''' is a day recognizing the need to promote efforts to tackle issues such as [[poverty]], [[social exclusion|exclusion]] and [[unemployment]]. Many organizations, including the UN, American Library Association (ALA) [http://ala.org/advocacy/diversity], and the International Labour Office, make statements on the importance of social justice for people. Many organizations also present plans for greater social justice by tackling poverty, social and economic exclusion and unemployment. The [[United Nations General Assembly]] has decided to observe 20 February annually, approved on 26 November 2007 and starting in 2009, as the World Day of Social Justice.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=24801 ''UN declares 20 February as World Day of Social Justice'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The Declaration focuses on guaranteeing fair outcomes for all through employment, social protection, social dialogue, and fundamental principles and rights.
