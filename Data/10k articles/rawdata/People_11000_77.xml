'''Aldrich, Devourer of Gods''' (also known as '''Aldrich, Saint of the Deep''') is a fictional character and [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] in the action role-playing game ''[[Dark Souls III]]''. A former human and [[Clergy|cleric]], he became a sentient monster of sludge due to his [[Human cannibalism|cannibalistic]] tendencies. He is also a Lord of Cinder in the game's lore, a being who rekindled the First Flame. Aldrich received critical acclaim for the difficulty and visuals of his boss fight, as well as his depiction in the game's lore and links to ''[[Dark Souls]]''.

== Characteristics ==
Aldrich is only seen in his monstrous form during the game, although he appears in the comic ''Dark Souls #1'' in human form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/the-first-dark-souls-comic-plays-it-too-safe/|title=The first Dark Souls comic plays it too safe|work=pcgamer|access-date=2018-03-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once a cleric, he is stated to have become "infamous" due to the pleasure he took from consuming human flesh.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/how-dark-souls-3-builds-up-its-most-villainous-slime-lord/|title=How Dark Souls 3 builds up its most villainous slime lord|work=pcgamer|access-date=2018-03-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to some of his followers, Aldrich retained his mind while devolving into a snake-like being of black sludge covered in the skeletal remains of his victims prior to being locked in a stone "coffin" within the Cathedral of the Deep. He was later forced to become a sacrifice when the First Flame began to fade. He was resurrected upon the rise of the Unkindled, refusing to surrender his new power as a Lord of Cinder to rekindle the First Flame and fled to [[Anor Londo]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Prior to being confronted by the player, Aldrich had partially devoured Anor Londo's deity Dark Sun Gwyndolin, assimilating the deity's memories and torso to defend himself with both Gwyndolin's powers and a recreation of Priscilla's Lifehunt Scythe.

Aldrich is also the focus of an in-game covenant, the Aldrich Faithful, which encourages attacking other players who attempt to make their way to fight him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/how-dark-souls-3s-aldrich-faithful-covenant-turns-good-people-into-trolling-monsters/|title=How Dark Souls 3's Aldrich Faithful covenant turns good people into trolling monsters|work=pcgamer|access-date=2018-03-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
Aldrich's character and that of the Cathedral of the Deep are based on [[Lovecraftian horror|Lovecraftian]] themes, with his name being similar to "[[wikt:eldritch|eldritch]]" knowledge.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The cathedral's ambiance and enemies exhibit oceanic sounds and designs that depict Aldrich's worship of a "dark, abyssal realm" known as the Deep.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Aldrich's purple clothing was stated to be "the color of authority" and evidence that he held a high rank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://killscreen.com/articles/dark-souls-iii-and-the-color-purple/|title=Dark Souls III and the color purple - Kill Screen|date=2016-05-03|work=Kill Screen|access-date=2018-03-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]'s Edwin Evans-Thirlwell called Aldrich the best video game boss of 2016, saying that he is "the focus of the game's shift into the realm of the macabre".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/12/20/why-dark-souls-3s-aldrich-is-2016s-best-boss/|title=Why Dark Souls 3’s Aldrich is 2016’s best boss|date=2016-12-20|website=Rock, Paper, Shotgun|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Calling him an example of the gluttony that marks the key antagonists of ''Dark Souls'', he states that Aldrich's cannibalism is also the most "pointed" exploration of the parallel between the harmfulness of unnatural longevity and making sequels.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He also says that the fight may seem anti-climactic compared to [[Ornstein and Smough]], who are fought in the same arena, and that this is on purpose due to the fact that Aldrich is a pitiful figure who lost his own identity trying to consume others.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

James Davenport of [[PC Gamer]] called Aldrich "one of the most obvious, influential and nuanced" villains in the ''Dark Souls'' series, suggesting that he was planning to subvert the fire-linking process by embracing the "darker plane" of the Deep.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He also praised the fact that ''Dark Souls III'' "spends entire zones" characterizing Aldrich rather than making him a mere boss.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Aldrich was voted the 5th hardest boss in ''Dark Souls III'' by the [[IGN]] community, citing his powerful magical attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/18/dark-souls-3s-hardest-bosses?page=2|title=Dark Souls 3's Hardest Bosses|date=2016-05-18|website=IGN|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also named as one of the best bosses in the game by [[GamesRadar+]], calling his attacks "impressive" and requiring constant motion for the player to stay alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/best-dark-souls-bosses/|title=Prepare to die - these are the 15 greatest Dark Souls bosses|work=gamesradar|access-date=2018-03-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2150">'''Alun Herbert Davies''' (1927-2005), known as Alan Creunant in Wales, was a Welsh head teacher, and first director of the [[Welsh Books Council]]. His parents were Rev. Thomas Herbert (Creunant) Davies and Hannah Davies (née Thomas). On completing his secondary education in Llandovery he studied at Trinity College, [[Carmarthen]], but did not enter the teaching profession until he had completed two years military service. Following a short period teaching in the [[Tregaron]] area, he moved to [[Llangeitho]] where, in 1952, he took up the position of school head teacher. 

From 1965 to 1987 he held the position of Director of the [[Welsh Books Council]]. During this time he secured significant funding for the institution from local authorities and the Welsh Arts Council, and developed trading practices, introducing a wholesale operation for booksellers and publishers, and introducing services to help publishers improve standards of book production. He was also able to include in Books Council's remit the distribution of grants to improve and extend the variety of books published.

Davies' other great passion was religion, and he served as a lay preacher with the Presbyterian Church of Wales. He was also Moderator of the South Wales Association of the Presbyterian Church of Wales in 1979-1980.&lt;ref name=IndyObit&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stephens|first1=Meic|title=Alun Creunant Davies|author-link=Meic Stephens|work=The Independent|date=27 October 2005|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987 he received an honorary MA from the [[University of Wales]], and in 2004 was made a Fellow of the [[University of Wales Aberystwyth]].

He died from cancer at Bronglais Hospital, [[Aberystwyth]], in October 2005.

His first call up was in June 2015, and he has consistently participated in national team camps and tournaments since.  Bremer was one of a number of players seeking a spot on the national team roster for the [[2016 Summer Paralympics]] in Rio.

Bremer also represented the U.S in the 2017 IFCPF World Championships and THE 2018 America’s Cup.

'''Arnaud II de La Porte''' (born, Versailles, 14 October 1737; guillotined Paris, 23 August 1792) [[France|French]] statesman, Minister of the Marine, Intendant of the King's Civil List (Minister of the Royal Household).

==Early life and career==

Born at [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]] from a family steeped in the traditions of the [[Palace of Versailles|palace]], de La Porte (or de Laporte) was destined early to follow in the family footsteps. His great-granduncle was [[Michel Richard Delalande]], court composer to [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], his grandfather was First Commissary of the Marine [[Joseph Pellerin]], his father [[Arnaud I de La Porte]] was First Commissary as well, and his uncle, Joseph Pellerin Jr. was Intendant of the Naval Armies, all under [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] and [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]].¹[[File:A de la porte.jpg|250 px|thumb|Arnaud II de La Porte]]

He began working in his father's bureau in 1755 at only eighteen years of age. The next year he joined his uncle at the Marine (as the Navy was known in France). He would continue in these branches of the government occupying at various times Intendancies of [[Brest, France|Brest]] and [[Bordeaux]], arriving at the Intendancy of Foreign and Maritime Trade in 1783.

==The Revolution==

Named [[List of Naval Ministers of France|Minister of the Navy]] during the [[Louis Auguste Le Tonnelier de Breteuil|Baron de Breteuil]]'s ephemeral ministry on 12 July 1789, after the fall of the Bastille two days later he immediately emigrated to Spain. However Louis XVI needed faithful servants more than ever, and when the King called, La Porte was one of the few who dared answer. He was named Intendant of the [[Civil list|Civil List]] (Minister of the Royal Household) in December 1790 which gave him direct control of the large sums of money that were considered the private wealth of the King and so not subject to public audit. He soon became a close confidant of the beleaguered king and Louis XVI entrusted him with great sums of this private money to be distributed toward the moderation of the rapidly radicalising revolutionary fervour. More than 1500 persons; actors, singers, public speakers, etc. were employed to this end, at an expense which exceeded 200,000 livres monthly. In 1791 La Porte founded the "National" Club in the Carrousel. Despite his close collaboration with [[Victor de Riqueti, marquis de Mirabeau|Mirabeau]], and especially due to the latter's premature death, La Porte's efforts proved to be in vain.

Seeing how dangerous things were becoming, La Porte, who conferred on a daily basis with the King in his apartments in the Pavillon de l'Infante of the [[Louvre Palace|Louvre]] (which were attached by a long wing to the [[Tuileries Palace]] at that time), proposed a plan to his sovereign in an attempt to save his life. He had previously discovered a secret room in his suite, and knowing that the guards would not take notice of his passage since he made the same walk every day, counselled the King to hide in the secret room after their daily conference until such a time as he could be safely spirited out of the whole palace complex. At that time Louis refused, still certain of the love of his people. The [[Marie Antoinette|Queen]]'s friend, [[Axel von Fersen the Younger|Fersen]] would be more successful in convincing him of his need to escape a few months later. When the royal family attempted the [[flight to Varennes]], Laporte was left behind, entrusted by the King to read his letter explaining his motives to the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|Constituent Assembly]], something that must have been a thankless, not to say extremely dangerous task.

Caught near the border, the royal family was unceremoniously returned to Paris to face the music. The King's position deteriorated steadily after that. After the storming of the Tuileries on [[10 August (French Revolution)|10 August]], La Porte was arrested for having distributed secret funds, and convicted of treason against the [[French Revolution|Revolution]] becoming, on 23 August 1792, the second political victim of that new humane device: the [[guillotine]]. In a macabre gesture, his severed head was then presented to the King, by then imprisoned in the [[Temple (Paris)|Temple]], as a grisly birthday gift.

His services and ultimate sacrifice were recalled after the [[Bourbon Restoration|Restoration]] by the King's younger brother who had been crowned as [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]], and his son Arnaud III de La Porte was created a [[baron]] in recognition of all this in 1822. The title remains in the family to this day.

==Biographical essay==

(translated from the "Dictionnaire historique ou Histoire abrégée des hommes qui se sont fait un nom par la génie, les talens, les vertus, les erreurs, depuis le commencement du monde jusqu’à nos jours. --François Xavier de Feller, 12 vol in-8º, Paris, 1818."):

Laporte (Arnaud de), born in 1737 of a family which over the last century had provided several intendants and chief administrators to the Navy and the Colonial Office, he was destined to follow the same career. The Jesuits, with whom he did his studies at the Collège Louis Le Grand, had hoped to acquire him for their company; but the young Laporte did not heed their hints, though he was always to retain feelings of attachment and veneration for his former masters.

At an early age (he was barely 23 years old), he was given the task of directing construction in the ports of Calais and Boulogne, of flat-bottomed boats, of a kind which, since they were ultimately to prove useless, have become the objects of ridicule by the English but which had for quite some time been the subject of their livliest anxiety. In the fulfilment of his duties, Laporte exercised those talents and that energy which were ever to focus public attention upon him.

Having been rapidly promoted through the intermediary ranks, he was soon appointed Controller of the Navy at Brest. This posting’s modest title belies its vast responsibilities; it was in fact a senior posting. He soon made for himself a personal reputation which public opinion, ratified by the full confidence of his superiors, led to his gradual assumption of all the functions of the Intendancy, of which he would one day actually hold the title as well.

When his father died in 1770, Laporte went up to Paris to succeed him at the Exchequer, thus becoming the magistrate of a Sovereign Court and as such could no longer remain the mere controller of the port of Brest. In order for the Navy to be able to retain his services he was appointed Ordinator of Bordeaux, a post which gave him direct access to the Minister of the Navy which was a rôle much more in keeping with his newly elevated rank. It was at this time that he began to lay the foundations of that double reputation of a virtuous man as well as an able administrator which was to particularly characterise him.

It is from this time as well that one can date that universal concert of approbation both from the Navy and the Merchant Marine as well as from shipping magnates in every port who all championed him for the office of Minister of the Navy each time that post became vacant. M. de Sartine was appointed Minister in 1775, and no sooner was he in office than he hastened to nominate Laporte to the king for the Intendancy of Brest, at that time vacant.

Soon after, in 1776, an order came down changing the structure of the administration of the ports, by which several aspects were now to fall under the purview of the military. Although the new Intendant disapproved of some of these changes, having foreseen and reported several inconveniences likely to come of them, he nevertheless set himself to implement them inonfidence he inspired in general, that Laporte was in great part responsible for the rapid expansion of the French Navy during the period of the [[American Revolutionary War|War of American Independence]], this in spite of the innumerable difficulties that the execution of the new order entailed.

The port of Brest during the course of this war was, as the principal French naval base,the nerve centre of almost all operations. Arnaud de Laporte who was its very soul soon gathered the fruits of his labours in expressions of esteem from the multitudes of travellers who passed through, expressions to which the king’s brother the Count of Artois deigned to join his own. This prince would henceforward honour Laporte with his most particular grace.

M. de Castries, having become Naval Minister in 1780 immediately called Laporte to his side and gave him, under the title of Intendant General of the Navy, the direction of all matters remaining under Administrative Corps. In 1783 he was called to the Royal Council of State as Master of Requests and at the same time appointed Intendant of Maritime Commerce, Intendant of the Navy, and a member of the Naval Council which the Minister had formed around his person.

Then the Revolution began, and in July 1789 the king appointed a new ministry, calling on Arnaud de Laporte to take on the portfolio of the Navy at last. He was at that moment in Paris which was in full insurrection. The courrier on his way from Versailles carrying his nomination as Minister of the Navy was arrested at the barriers set up around the city and taken to the City Hall where the electors had constituted themselves. Luckily there were among them some well-intentioned men who saw to it that the courrier and his despatches was allowed to continue without the contents of his attaché being examined, and it is thanks to them that Laporte was not subjected to the fury of the enraged populace then and there.

Louis XVI, who had been unable to approach him in person at the time, finally got the chance eighteen months later in December 1790 when, come to name his new Intendant of the Civil List decided upon Laporte for the job. The latter was however no longer in France, having emigrated to Vitoria, near Bilbao in Spain which is where he received the king’s letter, and though he had no doubts as to the danger to which he would expose himself, without a moment’s hesitation he hastened to the service of a master who had found him worthy, and who lost no time in coming to appreciate the value of his servant.

Over the next year and a half, Laporte had few occasions to give public proof of his devotion to his king. Circumstances required him to appear to be buried in purely financial matters obeying the king’s wishes, whose confidence and affection in any event gave his heart all the reward he could hope for. Louis XVI soon gave him proof of his feelings when a pamphlet was published at the beginning of 1791 which accused his Intendant of weakness and even incompetence. The king, under no illusion as to the real aim of this slander which was getting a great deal of publicity at the time, was the first to go and speak to Laporte of it. His Intendant immediately offered his resignation if the king did not feel his services had been adequate, to which the Louis responded " Would you too, wish to leave me then?" Laporte, deeply moved, threw himself at his master’s knees, and at that moment his fate was irrevocably sealed.

Whether because the king was satisfied with Laporte’s account of his work, or because the ever-mounting danger of being in the king’s service kept even the most ambitious from seeking such a post, in any event Laporte was able to hold onto the king’s confidence. It was this close collaboration with Louis XVI that led a great many people to come into contact with him, some no doubt in hope of acquiring an entrée with the king in the event that royal authority might eventually be restored, others with perhaps purer motives. All took him for their mediator with the king to whom, via Laporte they communicated their expressions of affection and zeal to serve him. After the tenth of August Laporte's first care was to destroy all evidence of this correspondence.That his retiring behaviour was not a sign of timidity in Laporte is shown by the fact that every time it was his duty to appear in public he did so with great courage.

One reads in the accounts of the day that when he was called upon to appear before the National Assembly to present the declaration the king had prepared before the royal family’s flight to Varennes, he refused to disclose the letter his unfortunate master had written him which he regarded as a sacred trust which he would not violate. He was equally firm when called upon to explain what had become of the "Memoires" of Madame de La Motte of which the entire edition had been bought up by the king so it could be suppressed. It had been decided that the books would be burnt in their entirety in the furnaces of the Sèvres porcelain factory. Laporte, assigned to oversee this operation (which he had considered a mistake in the first place), nevertheless undertook the task out of duty and discipline, feeling that such a delicate matter had to be seen to properly.

It is known that Louis XVI, departing from Paris in 1791 was headed for Montmédy where he would centre his provisional government. A new ministry was envisioned. The Baron de Breteuil was to be Prime Minister and Laporte was to join it as Minister of the Navy. This second appointment was to have no more result than the first, and was even less known since every effort was made after the failure of the king’s flight to play down all details regarding the oppositional government’s plans.

On the tenth of August, Laporte, fearing that his absence might compromise the king took it to be his duty to remain at his post. He went home that evening and there received a deputation of two jacobin envoys upon which he was obliged to present himself before the National Assembly to deposit the registers of the Civil List for their review. He replied calmly to the interrogation he was then subjected to, and surprisingly his point of view carried the day.

Four more days passed without any attacks upon his person, however during that time he had to suffer the search of his papers by Commissioners of the National Assembly. To their disappointment no incriminating materials were discovered among them. Despite their best efforts not to omit anything that might produce their desired results, even to the point of removing chimney stones and pulling up the floorboards of his apartment, not a single piece of evidence was found that might have incriminated anyone at all.

The care taken by this good man, who in so much personal danger himself, still took the pains not to compromise all those who had been in correspondence with him shows one of the character traits of Arnaud de Laporte which has sadly largely been ignored by posterity. Too many with too much to lose had good reason to keep him in oblivion, and so it wasn’t until many years later that a few of those who were saved by his actions on that day were able to come forward in their memoires to express their belated gratitude and pay homage to his memory.

The confidence that he enjoyed and which he so clearly showed to be well merited as in this instance, had made his network of contacts very numerous, and even thre{{Clarify|date=April 2016}} times he regretted having had to meet with them.

But all that he did remained largely unknown, an inevitable consequence of the circumstances in the midst of which he was acting, which as a man of experience he knew to be of the highest delicacy. Nevertheless, he continued to perform these thankless tasks with all the constancy of a man of real character who had no need of the approbation of others in the fulfilment of his duty. Some others held in the king’s heart and would have been frustrated to appear to be held away from that close coterie that had surrounded Louis XVI which both friends and enemies of the king were vainly striving to force their way into.

But Arnaud de Laporte, faithful to that wise spirit of discretion which he had made his creed, affected to remain always at a remove from the buzzing throng that whirled around the king’s person. Everyone knew what he was about, and understood his firm principles, and that understanding led them to feel deep gratitude towards him. He had no personal enemies, and as such he probably would not have been singled out to become one of the Revolution’s first victims had not the cold calculations of the leaders of the movement required them to find someone of "great guilt" to sacrifice in order to stoke the fires of public fury.

It is quite clear that Laporte would not have been chosen to open up the abominable series of judicial murders which was to be the prelude to the more wholesale slaughter of 25 September, except that the persons upon whom the revolutionaries’ eyes had first fallen had for the most part already made their escape from the capital or were being reserved for an even crueller fate.

It was on 15 August 1792, at the very time the Royal Family was being transported to prison at the Temple, that this faithful servant of the crown was taken to the City Hall to be interrogarted by Billaud-Varennes, and from there transported to the Abbey of St. Germain des Près, then in use as a revolutionary prison.

On the 23rd he appeared before the Revolutionary Tribunal. His calm countenance and the precision and accuracy of his responses to questioning stymied his judges best efforts to justify the guilty verdict they were required to make. "Why can’t you judge him?" cried the angry mob which had gathered to wallow in the spectacle of this just man’s calvary. For‚ in the eyes of this ignorant multitude, especially with tempers at fever-pitch, no judgement, no justice was possible except the death sentence.

Still the interrogation dragged on and on, for the rest of the day of the 23rd, through the whole night and for the morning after. And yet, surprisingly, after all that, such a great impression had he made upon his judges by his evident virtue, that they found themselves divided, and could not get the required majority vote for a condemnation, as was later reported by M. Julienne, the lawyer who had the courage to take on the dangerous job of defending Laporte. Nevertheless, they were bound by the powers over them and circumstances to condemn him and this they ultimately managed to bring themselves to do.

When Arnaud de Laporte heard his sentence, he had a momentary shudder of emotion, which he made no attempt to conceal without however showing any weakness. His faith, this religion which he’d always respected, so full of hope and consolation in adversity gave him the courage to remain calm without affectation, which made a deep impression upon all who witnessed it, including the judges who had just condemned him.

The imprint of his peaceful religious feelings has remained in a letter he wrote just after his sentencing which has been kept by his descendants. It is a very model of simple Christianity which resonates with submission to divine will and tenderness for his loved ones. The great impression he made at that moment, at first known only to those sharing the Tribunal with him, soon spread far and wide, this hommage to his dignity under duress, this respect due his courage at this terrible moment was reported unanimously by all the Parisian newspapers on the next day.

One history of the Revolution which appeared in 1797, called "Two Friends of Liberty" closes its account of his death as follows: "Calm, as was his conscience, he climbed the steps of the guillotine to meet his death with all the assurance of a man who had never used his life but to bring happiness to all who surrounded him". No-one, in fact, ever took the practice of private virtues farther than Arnaud de Laporte which was the best guarantee possible one could have for his public probity in office. Also, the esteem in which he was held by those who came to know him and even those who knew him only slightly was always accompanied by a genuine sentiment of affection.

His affability and good nature had won him all hearts back in Brest. During a long and grave illness in 1780 while posted there, the sailors of the port would gather daily at the door of the Intendancy eager for any scrap of news as to how he was faring, and thirty years after his death, when an oldtimer from Brest was asked if he had known Arnaud de Laporte the codger could not bring himself to answer, so overcome was he with tears of emotion.

Arnaud de Laporte left only one son, a squadron chief in the artillery of the Royal Guard.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6768">'''Asquith Camile Xavier''' was a West Indian-born Briton who ended a [[colour bar]] at [[British Railways]] in [[London]] by fighting to become the first non-white [[train guard]] at [[Euston railway station]] in [[1966]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/15/newsid_3043000/3043439.stm|title=Euston staff 'colour bar' ended|accessdate=2018-07-17|date=1966-07-15|work=On This Day|publisher=BBC News|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307123432/http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/15/newsid_3043000/3043439.stm|archivedate=2008-03-07|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Oona King]], [http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07zzr8r "Asquith's Fight for Equality"], [[BBC Radio 4]], 2016-10-26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= RAILWAY COLOR BAR IS BROKEN IN LONDON |date= July 16, 1966| url=https://nyti.ms/2LsIzEX|publisher=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=July 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trevor Phillips]], the chairman of the [[Commission for Racial Equality]], said in 2006: "Asquith's stand against discrimination brought to light the inadequacy of early race discrimination laws and persistent widespread discrimination faced by ethnic minorities." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/first-class-hero-633709|title= FIRST-CLASS HERO: Forty years ago, this man changed the face of race relations in Britain after beating a colour bar on the railways |accessdate=2018-07-26|date=2006-07-15|work=The Mirror|publisher=MGN | }}&lt;/ref&gt; A plaque at the station commemorates his achievement. 

Xavier was born on 18 July 1920 in [[Dominica]], which was then a British colony. He was a member of the [[Windrush generation]] of British African-Caribbean people who migrated to the United Kingdom after the second world war to fill vacancies in service industries. 

==Discrimination==

Xavier joined [[British Railways]]. In 1966 he was working as a guard at [[Marylebone station]] in central London. He applied for a promotion and transfer to work at Euston, but was rejected. A letter from a staff committee at Euston—which was dominated by members of the [[National Union of Railwaymen]]—explained it was because of his colour. Unions and management had informally agreed in the 1950s to ban non-white people from jobs at Euston that involved contact with the public; they could be cleaners and labourers, but not guards or ticket collectors.

The [[Race_Relations_Act_1965|Race Relations Act]] of 1965 had made discrimination on "grounds of colour, race, or ethnic or national origins" unlawful in public places in [[Great Britain]] (but not [[Northern Ireland]]). Xavier could not use this legislation to further his case as it did not cover workplaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/8/newsid_4457000/4457112.stm|title=1965: New UK race law 'not tough enough' |accessdate=2018-07-26|date=1965-12-08|work=On This Day|publisher=BBC News| }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Xavier persisted. A union official publicised the rejection by writing a letter of protest to the head of the National Union of Railwaymen on his behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Colour bar protest over railman.|last=|first=|date=11 July 1966|work=The Times (London, England)|access-date=|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two [[member of parliament|members of parliament]] wrote to the [[secretary of state for transport]], [[Barbara Castle]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/1966-07-15/debates/b65aca94-436b-4d17-90a6-3a40aaa9716c/ColouredWorkers|title=Coloured Workers - Hansard|website=hansard.parliament.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; to ask her to direct British Railways to end racial discrimination. 
On 15 July 1966 British Railways announced that colour bars at stations in London had been abandoned. Xavier was offered the job with his pay backdated to May, which was when he had been originally rejected.
Xavier could not take up the job immediately as he was recovering from hospital treatment for an ulcer. He received hate mail and death threats, and asked for police protection. He started work on 15 August 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Mirror Reporter |title=CLOCKING ON ..

'''Athanasios Sekeris''' was a [[Greeks|Greek]] merchant and a prominent member of [[Filiki Eteria]]. He was the brother of [[Panagiotis Sekeris|Panagiotis]] and [[Georgios Sekeris]].

==Early life ==

Athanasios studied in [[Dimitsana]]’s School. He then followed his older brother to [[Istanbul]], where he completed his studies and started working as a merchant. In 1816, he settled in [[Odessa]] as co-partner of his brother.{{sfn|Visvizi-Donta|2003 | p= 286}}

== Career ==
In 1817, [[Nikolaos Skoufas]] introduced Anathos and [[Panagiotis Anagnostopoulos]] to the Filiki Eteria. The last one was hosted by Athanasios Sekeris in his house in Odessa. During that time, the headquarters’ transfer to Istanbul was decided. Before Skoufas’ departing to Istanbul, he revealed to Athanasios the Supreme Leader and appointed him as co-leader with Odessa as the headquarters and responsible for [[Bessarabia]]. When Skoufas departed Odessa, he took Anagnostopoulos and a reference letter for his brother, Panagiotis Sekeris. A few weeks later, he met Panagiotis and introduced him to the Filiki Eteria. This introduction was crucial because, through Panagiotis, the Filiki Eteria jointed Istanbul’s merchants. They gave financial assistance to Athanasios, while their influence and skills facilitated its expansion.{{sfn|Visvizi-Donta|2003|p= 290-291}} 
  
Athanasios decided to return home when the [[Greek War of Independence]] began. He left Odessa in late August 1821. He served as the head of a military unit in [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripolitsa]] in several battles. In one battle he was wounded in his right hand. After the death of his brother Georgios, he tried to receive appointment to some public post and to be compensated for his family's sacrifices to the Revolution. In 1823, he was appointed plenipotentiary of Tripolitsa province in the [[Second National Assembly at Astros]], and in 1824 he was appointed as prefect of [[Old Patras]]. From 1828 to 1831 he was member of the provincial council of elders of Nafplio. From 1835 until 1843, he was president of a [[court of first instance]]. In 1844, Sekeriswas dismissed from his post as magistrate and he became superintendent and warehouse worker at Public Revenue of Argos’ municipality.{{sfn|Visvizi-Donta|2003|p=325-327}} The year of Athanasios' death is unknown.

The  term "ethnic Austrians" is sometimes used in the context of the [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|population movements after World War II]], e.g. in a [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/638999.stm BBC News article] of 11 February 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, during the 19th century, it referred to the citizens of the [[Empire of Austria]] (1804&amp;ndash;1867), and from 1867 until 1918 to the citizens of [[Cisleithania]]. In the closest sense, the [[name of Austria|term ''Austria'']] originally referred to the historical [[March of Austria]], corresponding roughly to the [[Vienna Basin]] in what is today [[Lower Austria]].

Historically, Austrians were regarded as ethnic [[Germans]] and viewed themselves as such.&lt;ref name="Keyserlingk1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert H.

Since the fall of the [[Third Reich]] and the events of [[World War II]], both the political ideology of [[pan-Germanism]] and the union with Germany have become discredited due to their association with [[Nazism]], allowing Austrians to develop their own separate and distinct [[national identity]].

==Name==
{{further|Name of Austria}}
[[File:Ostarrichi.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The first document containing the word "Ostarrîchi", the word is marked with a red circle.]]
The [[English language|English]] word ''[[:wikt:Austrian|Austrian]]'' is a derivative of the proper name Austria, which is a latinization of ''Österreich'', the German name for Austria. This word is derived from ''[[Ostarrîchi]]'', which first appears in 996. This, in turn, is probably a translation of the Latin ''[[Marcha Orientalis]]'', which means "eastern borderland" (viz. delimiting the eastern border of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]). It was a [[margraviate]] of the [[Duchy of Bavaria]], ruled by the [[House of Babenberg]] from AD 976.
During the 12th century, the ''Marcha Orientalis'' under the Babenbergs became independent of Bavaria. What is today known as [[Lower Austria]] corresponds to the ''Marcha Orientalis'', while [[Upper Austria]] corresponds to the eastern half of the core territory of Bavaria (the western half forming part of the [[States of Germany|German state]] of [[Bavaria]]).

The adjective ''Austrian'' entered the English language in the early 17th century, at the time referring to [[Habsburg Austria]] the sense of "members of the Austrian branch of the [[House of Habsburg]]" (the junior branch emerging from the dynastic split into Austrian and Spanish Habsburgs in 1521), but from the 18th century also "a native or inhabitant of Austria".&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]] s.g. "Austrian, ''adj.'' and ''n.''"&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

===Early history===
[[File:Hallstatt LaTene.png|thumb|300px|Overview of the [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt]] and  [[La Tène culture|La Tène]] cultures:
{{legend|#f6bc0a|The core Hallstatt territory (HaC, 800 BC) is shown in solid yellow, }}
The territories of some major [[List of Celtic tribes|Celtic tribes]] of the late La Tène period are labelled.]]
The territory of what is today Austria in the [[Roman Empire|Roman era]] was divided into [[Raetia]], [[Noricum]] and [[Pannonia]].
Noricum was a [[Celt]]ic kingdom, while the ''[[Pannonians|Pannonii]]'' were of [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] stock. The [[Raetians]] were an ancient [[history of the Alps|alpine]] people probably akin to the [[Etruscans]]. During the [[Migration period]] (c. 6th century), these territories were settled by the [[Bavarians]] and other [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] groups in the west ([[Alemanni]] in [[Vorarlberg]], [[Lombards]] in [[Tyrol (region)|Tyrol]]), and by [[Slavic settlement of the Eastern Alps|Slavic]] groups, [[Huns]] and [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]] in the east. In the 8th century, the former territories of Raetia and Noricum fell under [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian rule]], and were divided into the duchies of [[Swabia]], [[Bavaria]] and [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]]. Pannonia until the end of the 8th century was part of the [[Avar Khaganate]]. The "[[Margraviate of Austria|East March]]" (''Ostmark'') during the 9th century was the boundary region separating [[East Francia]] from the Avars and the [[Magyars]]. The site of [[Vienna]] had been settled since Celtic times (as ''[[Vindobona]]''), but the city only rose to importance in the [[High Middle Ages]] as the chief settlement of the March of Austria (the [[Morava (river)|March river]] just east of Vienna marks the ancient border between Francia and the Avars).

After the defeat of the Magyars at the [[Battle of Lechfeld]] in 955, the East March or [[March of Austria]] came to be the easternmost portion of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], bordering on [[Moravia]] to the north and on the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] to the east.
As a consequence, the national character of the [[Austro-Bavarian]] speaking majority population of Austria throughout their early modern and modern history remained characterized by their neighbourhood to the [[West Slavs]] ([[Czechs]], [[Slovaks]]) to the north, the [[South Slavs]] ([[Slovenians]], [[Carinthian Slovenes]],  [[Burgenland Croats]]) to the south, and the [[Hungarians]] to the east.

The unification of the various territories of Austria  outside of the March of Austria proper
(i.e. parts of Bavaria, Swabia and Carinthia) was a gradual process of [[feudalism|feudal politics]] during the High and Late Middle Ages, at first in the [[Archduchy of Austria]] under the [[House of Babenberg]] during the 12th to 13th centuries, and under the [[House of Habsburg]] after 1278 and throughout the 14th and 15th centuries. The various populations of these territories were not unified under the single name of "Austrians" before the [[early modern period]].

===Early Modern period===
{{Further|Habsburg Austria}}
[[File:Growth of Habsburg territories.jpg|thumb|300px|Growth of the Habsburg Monarchy]]
The [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]], who had ruled the territory of Austria since the [[Late Middle Ages]], greatly increased their political prestige and power with the acquisition of the lands of the crowns of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] and [[Bohemia]] in 1526. The Hungarian aristocracy was more successful at retaining the [[Magyars]]' cultural and political preponderance in multi-ethnic Hungary than Bohemia, on three sides surrounded by German neighbours, which underwent a period of intense German colonisation, [[Germanization|germanizing]] the leading classes of the [[Czechs|Czech]] people as well. The common German identity of lands such as Carinthia, Styria, or Tyrol, and the ruling dynasty made it easier for these lands to accept the central government set up in Vienna in the mid-18th century.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The term Austrian in these times was used for identifying subjects of the Domus Austriae, the House of Austria, as the dynasty was called in Europe, regardless of their ethnic ancestry. Although not formally a united state, the lands ruled by the Habsburgs would sometimes be known by the name "Austria". In reality they remained a disparate range of semi-autonomous states, most of which were part of the complex network of states that was the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (the imperial institutions of which were themselves controlled for much of their later existence by the Habsburgs). However, the second half of the 18th century saw an increasingly centralised state begin to develop under the reign of [[Maria Theresa of Austria]] and her son [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]].

After the [[French Revolution]] and the rise of [[Napoleon]], the emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Franz II]] formally founded the [[Austrian Empire]] in 1804 and became as ''Franz I'' the first Austrian emperor. For the first time the citizens of the various territories were now subjects of the one same state, while most of the German states, [[Prussia]] excluded, still cultivated their [[Kleinstaaterei]] and didn't succeed in forming a homogenous empire. Following Prussia's victory in the [[Austro-Prussian war]] in 1866, [[Otto von Bismarck]] successfully unified the [[German Empire]] in 1871, which was Prussian-dominated, without the inclusion of Austria and the German Austrians.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Allinson, Germany and Austria 1814-2000, pp. 23-29&lt;/ref&gt; 

After Austria was excluded from Germany in 1866, the following year Austria joined Hungary as a dual empire known as the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. A further major change resulted from a reorganisation of the Austrian Empire in 1867 into a [[dual monarchy]], acknowledging the Kingdom of Hungary as an independent state bound to the remaining part of the empire, as well independent, by a personal and real union, the Emperor of Austria being the Apostolic King of Hungary (with both titles on the same level). The Austrian half, a patchwork of crown-lands, broadly coterminous with the modern-day Austria, the [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovenia]], and parts of [[Poland]], [[Ukraine]], [[Italy]], and [[Croatia]], was bound together by the common constitution of 1867, stating that all subjects now would carry "uniform Austrian citizenship" and have the same fundamental rights. These non-Hungarian lands were not officially called the Austrian Empire. Until 1915, they were officially called "the Kingdoms and States Represented in the Imperial Council" and politicians used the technical term [[Cisleithania]] (labelling the Hungarian lands as [[Transleithania]]). The general public called them Austria, and in 1915, the non-parliamentary Cisleithanian government decreed to use this term officially, too.

===19th-century nationalism===

The red line marks the border of the German Confederation; both Prussia and Austria controlled lands outside the Confederation.]]

The idea of grouping all [[Germans]] into one nation-state gave way to a rapid rise of German nationalism within the [[German Confederation]], especially in the two most powerful German states, Austria and Prussia. The question of how a unified Germany was to be formed was a matter of debate. The [[German Question]] was to be solved by either unifying all German-speaking peoples under one state as the "Greater German solution" (''Großdeutsche Lösung''), which was promoted by the Austrian Empire and its supporters. On the other hand, the "Lesser German solution" (''Kleindeutsche Lösung'') advocated only to unify the northern German states and exclude Austria; this proposal was favored by the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and its supporters. This debate became known as [[German dualism]].

The lands later called Cisleithania (except [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] and [[Dalmatia]]) were members of the German Confederation since 1815 as they had been part of the Holy Roman Empire until 1806. Until 1848, Austria and its chancellor Prince [[Metternich]] unanimously dominated the confederation. The developing sense of a German nationality had been accelerated massively as a consequence of the political turmoil and wars that engulfed [[Central Europe]] following the [[French Revolution]] and the rise to power of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. Although the years of peace after Napoleon's fall quickly saw German nationalism largely pushed out of the public political arena by reactionary absolutism, the [[Revolutions of 1848]] established it as a significant political issue for a period of nearly hundred years.
[[File:Deutscher Bund.svg|thumb|240px|A map of the German Confederation in 1849 showing the 39 independent states.]]
Political debate now centred on the nature of a possible future German state to replace the Confederation, and part of that debate concerned the issue of whether or not the Austrian lands had a place in the German polity. When Emperor Franz Joseph I ordered to build a monument in Vienna in 1860 to [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles]], victor over Napoleon in the [[Battle of Aspern-Essling]] in 1809, it carried the dedication "To the persistent fighter for Germany's honour", to underline the Germanic mission of the House of Austria. 

The idea of uniting all ethnic Germans into one nation-state began to be challenged in Austria by the rise of [[Austrian nationalism]], especially within the [[Christian Social Party (Austria)|Christian Social Party]] that identified Austrians on the basis of their predominantly Catholic religious identity as opposed to the predominantly Protestant religious identity of the Prussians.&lt;ref&gt;Spohn, Willfried (2005), "Austria: From Habsburg Empire to a Small Nation in Europe", Entangled identities: nations and Europe, Ashgate, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

Habsburg influence over the German Confederation, which was strongest in the southern member states, was rivalled by the increasingly powerful [[Prussia]]n state. Political manoeuvering by the Prussian [[chancellor]] [[Otto von Bismarck]] resulted in military defeat of the Austrians in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 and the collapse of the Confederation, both effectively ending any future Austrian influence on German
political events.

When asked by Edward VII to abandon Austria-Hungary's alliance with Germany for co-operation with England, Franz Joseph replied "I am a German prince."&lt;ref&gt;("Ich bin ein Deutscher Fürst") Walter Wiltschegg: Österreich, der "zweite deutsche Staat"?: der nationale Gedanke in der Ersten Republik, Stocker, 1992, p. 41 (German)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bassett, For God and Kaiser: The Imperial Austrian Army, 1619-1918, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Franco-Prussian War]] and the establishment of a [[German Empire]] in 1871, headed by [[Prussia]] and pointedly excluding any of the Austrian lands, let the state turn away from Germany and turn its gaze towards the [[Balkan Peninsula]]. Thereby the influence of [[pan-Germanism]] was diminished in the Habsburg territories, but as the term "Austrians" still was used supra-national, German-speaking Austrians considered themselves [[Germans]] (and were counted as such in the censuses). After Bismarck had excluded Austria from Germany, many Austrians faced a dilemma about their identity which prompted the Social Democratic Leader [[Otto Bauer]] to state that the dilemma was "the conflict between our Austrian and German character."{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=6}} The state as a whole tried to work out a sense of a distinctively Austrian identity.

The Austro-Hungarian Empire created ethnic conflict between the German Austrians and the other ethnic groups of the empire. Many pan-German movements in the empire desired the reinforcement of an ethnic German identity and that the empire would collapse and allow for a quick annexation of Austria to Germany.&lt;ref name="DPSO"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.politischebildung.at/upload/polsystem.pdf | title=Das politische System in Österreich (The Political System in Austria) | publisher=Austrian Federal Press Service | date=2000 | accessdate=9 July 2014 | page=24 | language=German | location=Vienna}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hamann|2010|p=394}} Although it was precisely because of Bismarck's policies that Austria and the German Austrians were excluded from Germany, many Austrian pan-Germans idolized him.&lt;ref&gt;Suppan (2008). ′Germans′ in the Habsburg Empire. The Germans and the East. pp. 171–172.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the high bureaucracy of Austria and many Austrian army officers considered themselves "black-yellow" (the Habsburg colours), i.e. loyal to the dynasty, the term "German Austria" (Deutschösterreich) was a term used in the press to mean all the Austrian districts with an ethnic German majority among the inhabitants. Austrian pan-Germans such as [[Georg Ritter von Schönerer]] and his followers agitated against the "multi-national" Austro-Hungarian Empire and advocated for German Austria to join the German Empire.{{sfn|Hamann|2010|p=238}} Although many Austrians shared the same views, a lot of them still showed allegiance to the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] and hoped for Austria to remain an independent country.{{sfn|Low|1974|pp=14-16}} Although not as radical as Schönerer and his followers, populists such as [[Karl Lueger]] used anti-semitism and pan-Germanism as a form of populism to further their own political purposes.{{sfn|Hamann|2010|p=282}}

===World Wars===
{{Main article|Austria-Hungary#World War I|Anschluss|First Austrian Republic}}
[[File:GermanAustriaMap.png|thumb|left|300px|Provinces claimed by German Austria, with the subsequent border of the [[First Austrian Republic]] outlined in red.]]
The last year of [[World War I]] saw the collapse of Habsburg authority throughout an increasingly greater part of its empire. On October 16, 1918, emperor Karl I invited the nations of Austria to create national councils, with the aim to instigate a restructuring of the state under Habsburg rule. The nations followed the invitation (the Czechs had founded their national council already before the invitation) but ignored the will of the emperor to keep them in a restructured Austrian state. Their goal was total independence. 
[[File:Kurt Schuschnigg 1934.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Kurt Schuschnigg]] rejected the Nazis desire for an ''Anschluss'' and tried his best to keep Austria as an independent country.]]
On October 21, the German members of the Austrian parliament, elected in  1911, met in Vienna to found the Provisional National Assembly of German Austria ("Provisorische Nationalversammlung für Deutschösterreich"). On October 30, 1918 they installed the first German Austrian government, leaving the question "monarchy or republic" open. ([[German nationalism in Austria|German nationalists]] and social democrats favoured the republic, the Christian Socialists wanted to keep the monarchy.) This government in the first days of November took over the duties of the last imperial-royal government in a peaceful way. Initially the new state adopted the name "[[German Austria]]", reflecting the republic being the German part of the old Austria and showing the popular desire to unite with the new German republic. On November 12, 1918, the provisional national assembly voted for the republic and for unification with Germany with a large majority. 
[[File:stephansdom O5.jpg|thumb|200px|Sign of the [[Austrian resistance]] movement at the Stephansdom in Vienna]]
The creation of the [[Czechoslovakia|Czecho-Slovak]] and [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes|South Slav states]], the dissolution of the [[real union]] with [[Hungary]], and the post-war treaties imposed by the victorious Allies combined to see the newly established Austrian republic both with the boundaries it has today, and a largely homogeneous German-speaking population. In the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain]], in September 1919 the union with Germany was prohibited, and the new republic's name "Deutschösterreich" was prohibited by the treaty; instead the term "Republic of Austria" was used. The westernmost province [[Vorarlberg]]'s wish to unite with Switzerland was also ignored. On October 21, 1919, the state changed its name accordingly. Many German Austrian communities were left scattered throughout the other new states, especially in Czechoslovakia, where more than 3 million [[German Bohemians]] had not been allowed to become part of the new Austrian state, as well as in the southern part of Tyrol which now found itself part of Italy. In total, more than 3.5 million German-speaking Austrians were forced to remain outside the Austrian state.

The collapse of the empire caused an apparent struggle for some German Austrians between an "Austrian" and a "German" character.{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=8}} The idea of unifying Austria with Germany was motivated both by a sense of a common German [[national identity]], and also by a fear that the new state, stripped of its one-time imperial possessions, and surrounded by potentially hostile nation-states, would not be economically viable. An Austrian identity emerged to some degree during the First Republic, and although Austria was still considered part of the ''"German nation"'' by most, [[Austrian nationalism|Austrian patriotism]] was encouraged by the anti-Nazi/anti-Socialist clerico-authoritarianist state ideology known as [[Austrofascism]] from 1934-38. The [[Engelbert Dollfuss]]/[[Kurt von Schuschnigg]] government accepted that Austria was a "German state" and believed Austrians were "better Germans", but strongly opposed the annexing of Austria to the Third Reich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vsl6mwMXl4YC&amp;pg=PA37|title=Constructing and Deconstructing National Identity: Dramatic Discourse in Tom Murphy's The Patriot Game and Felix Mitterer's In Der Löwengrube|first=Birgit|last=Ryschka|date=1 January 2008|publisher=Peter Lang|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By March 1938, with [[Nazi]] governments in control of both Berlin and Vienna, the country was annexed to Germany (''[[Anschluss]]'') as ''[[Ostmark (Austria)|Ostmark]]''. In 1942 the name was changed to the "Alpen-und Donau-Reichsgaue" ("Alpine and Danubian Gaue"), thus eradicating any links with a special Austrian past. Some of the most prominent Nazis were native Austrians, including [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]], [[Arthur Seyss-Inquart]], [[Franz Stangl]], [[Otto Skorzeny]], and [[Odilo Globocnik]],&lt;ref&gt;Ian Wallace (1999).

Cambridge University Press. p.43. {{ISBN|0-521-85683-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During the war, Austrians' infatuation with Germany faded as Austrian-born [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s series of victories ended.{{Citation needed|reason=Questionable, surveys right after the war show that still plenty of Austrians still considered themselves as Germans, a distinct national identity took decades|date=July 2017}} When social democrat [[Adolf Schärf]], from 1945 party president and vice-chancellor and from 1957 federal president of Austria, was visited by German friends who wanted to talk about post-war government, he spontaneously explained to his surprised visitors, "love for Germany has been put out in Austrians". When the allies declared that they would reestablish an independent Austrian state after their victory (the [[Moscow Declaration]] of 1943) the only Austrians who heard them were those secretly listening to enemy broadcasts ("Feindsender"), which was a criminal offence and heavily prosecuted.

Though the Allied forces treated Austria as a belligerent party in the war and maintained occupation of it after the Nazi capitulation, they accepted the Declaration of Independence which Austrian politicians had signed at Vienna's city hall on April 27, 1945, and they made the first national elections possible in the autumn of that year. By the end of 1945, Austria, under the supervision of the Allied Council in Vienna, had a democratic parliament and government again, acknowledged by all four allied occupation zones.

The [[Austrian resistance]] to the Nazi rule started with the Anschluss in 1938. Historians estimate that there were about 100,000 members of resistance facing 700,000 [[NSDAP]] members in Austria.&lt;ref name="Dokumentationsarchiv"&gt;[http://www.doew.at/thema/widerstand/tagung_wn.html#ueberpart Dokumentationsarchiev des österreichischen Widerstands] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718112637/http://www.doew.at/thema/widerstand/tagung_wn.html |date=July 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sign of the Austrian resistance was O5, where the 5 stands for E and OE is the abbreviation of Österreich with Ö as OE.

===Republic of Austria (1955 to present)===
{{Main article|Austria — the Nazis' first victim|Foreign relations of Austria}}
[[File:Rot-Weiss-Rot-Buch 1946.jpg|thumb|180px|"Red-White-Red Book" which was published by the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1946, the book describes the accepted description of the events during the ''Anschluss'' (1938-1945) by the founders of the Second Austrian Republic.]]
The end of World War II in 1945 saw the re-establishment of an independent Austria, although the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]] remained in occupation until 1955, when the [[Austrian State Treaty]] between Austria and them was signed to end occupation and to regain Austrian sovereignty.
Immediately after 1945 the majority of Austrians still saw themselves as Germans, as a broader Austrian [[national identity]] took time to develop. In a 1956 survey, 46% of Austrians still considered themselves to be Germans.&lt;ref name=survey1&gt;{{cite book|last=Thaler|first=Peter|title=The Ambivalence of Identity: The Austrian Experience of Nation-building in a Modern Society|year=2000|publisher=Purdue University Press|isbn=155753201X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another survey carried out in 1964 revealed that only 15% of Austrians still considered themselves to be Germans.&lt;ref name=survey1 /&gt;

In contrast, the Austrian political elite referred to their experiences in concentration camps and in prison, which had brought out a desire for the lost independence of the Austrian state. Kreissler (1993) writes: “It was not until after the (long dark) night of the Third Reich that Austrian identity was brought back to consciousness by resistance and exile”.&lt;ref name="WodakCillia2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ruth Wodak|author2=Rudolf de Cillia|author3=Martin Reisigl|title=The discursive construction of national identity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W5ccx_uVfg0C&amp;pg=PA57|year=2009|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-3734-8|pages=57–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Austrians developed a self-image unambiguously separate from their German neighbour. It was based on cultural achievements of the past, the [[Moscow Declaration]], geopolitical neutrality, language variation, the [[Habsburg]] legacy, and the separation of the two empires in the late 19th century. The [[German Empire]] was formed without Austria and the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] in the arrangement known as the [[German question|Kleindeutsche Lösung]] or "the Little Germany Solution". It proved favourable for Austrians not to be held guilty for World War II, genocide and war crimes, since [[Austria — the Nazis' first victim|Austria was considered a ''victim'' of Nazi Germany]], although some historians call this a "big lie" and have challenged this statement.{{sfn|Bischof|Pelinka|1997|pp=3–}}

Unlike earlier in the 20th century, in 1987 only 6% of Austrians identified themselves as "Germans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iiss210.joanneum.at/demokratiezentrum2/media/pdf/bruckmueller.pdf. |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928041605/http://iiss210.joanneum.at/demokratiezentrum2/media/pdf/bruckmueller.pdf |archivedate=September 28, 2007 }} Development of the Austrian identity .&lt;/ref&gt; Today over 90% of the Austrians see themselves as an independent nation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://derstandard.at/?url=/?id=3261105 Österreicher fühlen sich heute als Nation - 1938 - derStandard.at › Wissenschaft&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.photoglobe.info/ebooks/austria/cstudies_austria_0070.html Austria. Library of Congress Country Studies, 2004.]  Accessed 1 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
The logic of the existence of an independent Austrian state is no longer questioned as it was in the inter-war period. Proponents who recognize Austrians as a nation claim that Austrians have [[Celts|Celtic]] heritage, as Austria is the location of the first characteristically [[Hallstatt culture|Celtic culture]] to exist.&lt;ref name="Carl Waldman 2006. P. 42"&gt;Carl Waldman, Catherine Mason. ''Encyclopedia of European Peoples''. Infobase Publishing, 2006. P. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that Celtic Austria became culturally Romanized under Roman rule and later culturally Germanized after Germanic invasions.&lt;ref name="Carl Waldman 2006. P. 42"/&gt; Contemporary Austrians express pride in having Celtic heritage and Austria possesses one of the largest collections of Celtic artifacts in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Duffy. Who Were the Celts? Barnes &amp; Noble Publishing, 1996. P. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Austria's multicultural history and geographical location has resulted in post-Soviet era immigration from [[Slovenia]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Hungary]], [[Slovakia]], [[Romania]], and [[Poland]]. As with neighbouring Germany, there has also been heavy immigration from [[Turkey]] and former [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] states such as [[Croatia]] and [[Serbia]]. 

==Language==
{{main article|German language|High German languages}}
Austrians have historically spoken the German language. The sole official language at the federal level of Austria is German, and the standard used is called [[Austrian German]] since German is considered a [[pluricentric language]], like English. Austrian German is defined by the [[Austrian Dictionary]] ({{lang-de|Österreichisches Wörterbuch}}), published under the authority of the Austrian [[Federal Ministry of Education, Arts and Culture]]. Thus, all websites, official announcements and most of the media are carried out in Austrian German. The [[minority language]]s [[Slovene language|Slovene]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] are spoken and officially recognized.

In terms of native language, it is generally not Austrian German that is used, but instead local dialects of the [[Austro-Bavarian]] and [[Alemannic German|Allemannic]] (in [[Vorarlberg]] and the Tiroler Außerfern) family. The Austro-Bavarian dialects are considered to belong either to the [[Central Austro-Bavarian]] or [[Southern Austro-Bavarian]] subgroups, with the latter encompassing the languages of the [[State of Tyrol|Tyrol]], [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], and [[Styria]] and the former including the dialects of [[Vienna]], [[Burgenland]], [[Upper Austria]], and [[Lower Austria]]. The vast majority of Austrians are however able to speak Austrian Standard German in addition to their native dialect, as it is taught in all modern day schools.

==Naturalization==
{{main|Austrian nationality law|Immigration to Austria}}
Like most of [[Central Europe]], Austria has had high levels of [[immigration to Europe|immigration]] since the 1970s. As with [[Turks in Germany|Germany]], the largest immigrant group are [[Turks in Austria|Turks]]. An estimated total of 350,000 ethnic Turks lived in Austria in 2010, accounting for 3% of the Austrian population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=BBC|title=Turkey's ambassador to Austria prompts immigration spat|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11725311|accessdate=2010-11-10|work=BBC News|date=November 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rate of [[naturalization]] has increased after 1995, since which dates Turks in Austria could retain their citizenship in [[Turkey]] after naturalization in Austria ([[dual citizenship]]). After 2007, the rate of naturalizations has decreased due to a stricter nationality law enacted by the Austrian legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Bauböck|first=Rainer|author-link=|year=2006|title=Migration and Citizenship: Legal Status, Rights and Political Participation
|place=|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=90-5356-888-3}} p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;
During the 2000s, an average number of 27,127 foreign nationals per year was naturalized as Austrian citizens, compared to an average 67,688 children per year born with Austrian nationality.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.statistik.at/web_de/statistiken/bevoelkerung/einbuergerungen/index.html statistik.at] (years 2000&amp;ndash;2009):
*Naturalizations: 24320, 31731, 36011, 44694, 41645, 34876, 25746, 14010, 10258, 7978.
*Births (Austrian nationality): 67694, 65741, 68474, 67861, 69902, 69023, 68662, 66864, 67348, 65312.
The rate of naturalizations was at about 7,700 per year during the 1980s. It rose to 16,000 in 1997, 25,000 in 1999, peaking at 45,000 in 2003. Since 2004 the figure has shown a decreasing trend, falling back to a 1970s level (below 7,000) by 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the largest group of foreign nationals are Germans. As of January 2018 - 186,891 Germans lived in Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Staista|title=Foreign Nationals living in Austria|url=https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/293019/umfrage/auslaender-in-oesterreich-nach-staatsangehoerigkeit/|work=Statista News|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequently, an increasing portion of Austrians is not descended from the historical populations of Austria.
While the term "ethnic Austrian" has mostly been reserved for the context of overseas emigration from Austria ([[Austrian American]]s, [[Austrian Canadian]]s etc.), it can more recently also be used to distinguish the indigenous population from the naturalized immigrant population. Thus, the rapid growth of [[Islam in Austria]] is due to the higher birth rate among immigrants compared to that among the indigenous "ethnic Austrian" population.&lt;ref&gt;

==Culture==
{{Main|Austrian culture}}
Austrian culture has largely been influenced by its neighbours [[Switzerland]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Hungary]], the [[Balkans]] and [[Czech lands]].

===Music===
{{main|Music of Austria}}
{{further|Music of Vienna}}
[[Vienna]], the capital city of Austria has long been an important center of musical innovation. Composers of the 18th and 19th centuries were drawn to the city by the patronage of the [[Habsburg]]s, and made Vienna the European capital of classical music. [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Franz Schubert]] and [[Johann Strauss II|Johann Strauss, Jr.]], among others, were associated with the city. During the [[Baroque]] period, [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] and [[Magyars|Hungarian]] folk forms influenced Austrian music.

===Literature===
{{Main|Austrian literature}}
{{See also|List of Austrian writers}}

Complementing its status as a land of artists, Austria has always been a country of great poets, writers, and novelists. It was the home of novelists [[Arthur Schnitzler]], [[Stefan Zweig]], [[Thomas Bernhard]], and [[Robert Musil]], and of poets [[Georg Trakl]], [[Franz Werfel]], [[Franz Grillparzer]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], and [[Adalbert Stifter]]. Famous contemporary Austrian playwrights and novelists include [[Elfriede Jelinek]] and [[Peter Handke]]. Writers of philosophy include [[Ernst Mach]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[Karl Popper]] and the members of the [[Vienna circle]].

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Austrian Cuisine}}
Austrian cuisine, which is often incorrectly equated with Viennese cuisine, is derived from the cuisine of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. In addition to native regional traditions it has been influenced above all by German, [[Hungarian cuisine|Hungarian]], [[Czech cuisine|Czech]], [[Jewish cuisine|Jewish]], [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] and [[Polish cuisine|Polish]] cuisines, from which both dishes and methods of food preparation have often been borrowed. Goulash is one example of this. Austrian cuisine is known primarily in the rest of the world for its pastries and sweets.

===Religion===
{{main|Religion in Austria}}
The majority of Austrians are traditionally [[Roman Catholic]].
[[Roman Catholicism in Austria]] has played a significant role both in the [[culture of Austria|culture]] and in the [[politics of Austria]]. It enabled the [[House of Habsburg]] to rule [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]] and [[Spanish Empire|its empire]] as a [[Catholic Monarch]]y from the 16th century, and it determined the role of [[Habsburg Austria]] in the [[Thirty Years' War]]. The music in the tradition of [[Viennese classicism]] is [[sacral music|sacral]] to a significant extent, including works such as [[Mozart]]'s [[Great Mass in C minor]], [[List of masses by Joseph Haydn|masses by Joseph Haydn]] (1750-1802), [[Beethoven]]'s [[Mass in C major (Beethoven)|Mass in C major]] (1807), down to [[Bruckner]]'s [[Te Deum]] (1903).

[[post-Christian Europe|Secularism]] has been on the rise since the 1980s. An estimated 66% of Austrians adhered to Roman Catholicism in 2009, compared to 78% in 1991 and 89% in 1961.
There is a traditional [[Lutheran]] minority, accounting for 4% of the population in 2009 (down from 6% in 1961). An estimated 17% are [[nonreligious]] (as of 2005).

[[Islam in Austria]] has grown rapidly during the 1990s and 2000s, rising from 0.8% in 1971 to an estimated 6% in 2010, overtaking the traditional size of the Lutheran community in Austria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://islamineurope.blogspot.com/2007/12/austria-muslims-to-overtake-protestants.html islamineurope.blogspot.com], citing Austrian census figures.&lt;/ref&gt; This rapid growth was due to the significant [[immigration to Austria]] from [[Turks in Austria|Turkey]] and [[Former Yugoslavia]] during the 1990s to 2000s.

'''Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros y de la Torre''' (1756–1829) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] naval officer born in [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]]. He took part in the [[Battle of Cape St Vincent (1797)|Battle of Cape St Vincent]] and the [[Battle of Trafalgar]], and in the Spanish resistance against [[Napoleon]]'s invasion in 1808. He was later appointed [[Viceroy]] of the [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]], replacing [[Santiago de Liniers]]. He disestablished the government Junta of [[Javier de Elío]] and quelled the [[Chuquisaca Revolution]] and the [[La Paz revolution]]. An [[open cabildo]] deposed him as viceroy during the [[May Revolution]], but he attempted to be the president of the new government junta, thus retaining power. The popular unrest in [[Buenos Aires]] did not allow that, so he resigned. He was banished back to Spain shortly after that, and died in 1829.

==Biography==
Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros was born on January 6, 1756, which is the religious feast of [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany day]], Hence he was named Baltasar after one of the [[Biblical Magi]].&lt;ref name="National130"&gt;National..., p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; Son of Francisco Hidalgo de Cisneros y Seijas, lieutenant of the [[Spanish Royal Navy]], and Manuela de la Torre y Galindo de Espinosa. He commenced his naval career in 1770 and went to the coasts of Africa and [[Peru]] and took part in the military campaign at [[Algiers]]. He was involved in the capture of an enemy ship in the [[English Channel]], and was promoted to ship's lieutenant. In 1795 he was promoted to commander of the ''San Pablo'', part of the Spanish fleet under [[José de Córdoba y Ramos]]. Spain at that time was engaged in the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1796–1808)|Anglo-Spanish War]]. The fleet engaged a smaller British fleet, but was defeated in the [[Battle of Cape St Vincent (1797)|Battle of Cape St Vincent]].&lt;ref name="National130"/&gt;

In 1803 he was in charge of the arsenal of [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartegena]], his city of birth. In 1805 he was the captain of the largest Spanish ship ''[[Spanish ship Nuestra Señora de la Santísima Trinidad|Nuestra Señora de la Santísima Trinidad]]'' during the [[battle of Trafalgar]], a major British victory over the combined Spanish and French fleets. The ship, whilst engaged in battle, lost a mast which fell over Hidalgo de Cisneros' head. This caused [[concussion]], which left him [[Hearing impairment|partially deaf]] for the rest of his life. After the incident, Hidalgo de Cisneros was nicknamed "''El sordo''" ({{lang-es|"The deaf"}}).&lt;ref name="National131"&gt;National..., p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; His ship, regarded as one of the most powerful of its time, was captured by [[HMS Neptune (1797)|HMS Neptune]] but sank the following day. Cisneros was taken prisoner and received medical care.  Whilst under capture he was awarded [[battle honours]] and on returning to Spain he was promoted to Lieutenant General.&lt;ref name="National131"/&gt;

===Work as viceroy===
After recovering from his wounds, Hidalgo de Cisneros received further promotion and served as vice-president of the governing council ("[[Junta (Peninsular War)|Junta]]") of Cartagena. The superior [[Junta of Seville]] later resolved to end the insurrection in the Río de la Plata, sending Cisneros to replace the viceroy [[Santiago de Liniers]]. The Junta regarded Liniers as a rebel with [[Bonapartist]] sympathies known in Spanish as an [[afrancesado]]. The [[mutiny of Álzaga]], a failed coup by conservative [[peninsulars]] against Liniers who was supported by the emerging local bourgeois, was regarded as rebellion by Liniers, influenced by French ideas but who was not a Napoleonic agent. The Junta gave Hidalgo de Cisneros orders to land in Montevideo, raise armies against Liniers, prosecute him with court-martial and return him under guard to Spain and to dissolve the local [[Criollo people|criollo]] militia. Cisneros also had orders to seek and punish likely Napoleonic sympathisers.&lt;ref name="reemplazo"&gt;[http://www.argentina-rree.com/2/2-015.htm El reemplazo de Liniers por Cisneros]&lt;/ref&gt; The Junta created a political office to conduct direct foreign relations with [[colonial Brazil]], to reign in the autonomy being exercised by the viceroy  which was seen as potentially insubordinate and secessionist.&lt;ref name="reemplazo"/&gt;

He arrived in Montevideo in June 1809. Manuel Belgrano proposed Liniers to resist his removal and to reject the appointment of Cisneros, on the grounds that Liniers had been confirmed as Viceroy by the authority of a Spanish king, while Cisneros would lack such legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;Belgrano, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Liniers accepted to give up his government to Cisneros without resistance. Noticing that Liniers was not the rebel governor that the Junta thought, he authorized him to stay in the Viceroyalty. Javier de Elío accepted as well the authority of the new Viceroy and dissolved the [[Junta of Montevideo]], becoming once again the Governor of the city.

Cisneros tried to take a conciliating policy with the many conflicting political groups. He kept the criollo militias, and granted their commanders to achieve [[veteran]] status, which so far was only allowed to [[peninsular]] military. He rearmed back the Spanish militias that were disbanded after the coup against Liniers. He also pardoned the responsibles;&lt;ref&gt;Pigna, p. 224{{lang-es|En la Banda Oriental, Elío disolvió la Junta de Montevideo y aceptó la autoridad del nuevo virrey, que volvió a armar a las milicias españolas y decretó una amnistía que dejó en libertad a los que habían conspirado contra Liniers.}}
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Álzaga was not freed, but his sentence was changed to [[house arrest]]. However, the attempts to please the criollos found resistance from the Junta, which did not approve the request to promote [[Cornelio Saavedra]] to [[colonel]] rank.

He tried to stay in good relations with the British and the landowners by removing the laws that forbid free trade, but retailers forced Cisneros to restore such laws. Mariano Moreno, a criollo lawyer, wrote a document to request Cisneros the reopening of free trade, entitled "[[The Representation of the Landowners]]". It is considered the most comprehensive economic report of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Luna, ''...Mariano Moreno'', p. 66 {{Lang-es|Como respuesta a la solicitud de los labradores y hacendados, Moreno escribe la 'Representación de los Hacendados', el documento sobre economía más completo que se haya redactado en el Río de la Plata.}}
&lt;br/&gt;
{{Lang-en|Responding to the request by farmers and landlords, Moreno wrote the 'Representation of the Landlords', the most complete economic document written so far in the Río de la Plata.}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Cisneros finally decided to grant an extension of free trade, which would end on May 19, 1810.&lt;ref&gt;Pigna, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pedro Murillo.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of [[Pedro Murillo]], by [[Joaquín Pinto]].]]
On May 25, 1809, a [[Revolution of Chuquisaca|revolution]] in [[Sucre|Chuquisaca]] deposed the governor and president of the [[Real Audiencia of Charcas|Royal Audiencia of Charcas]], [[Ramón García de León y Pizarro]], and accused him of supporting a Portuguese protectorate under the authority of Charlotte Joaquina. Military command fell to Colonel [[Juan Antonio Alvarez de Arenales]] who, due to uncertainty as to who should be in charge of the civilian affairs, also exercised some civil powers.&lt;ref name="Alto Perú"&gt;Abad de Santillán, p. 398&lt;/ref&gt; On July 16, in the city of [[La Paz]], a second [[La Paz revolution|revolutionary movement]] led by Colonel [[Pedro Domingo Murillo]] forced the governor to resign and replaced him with a Junta, the "[[Junta Tuitiva de los Derechos del Pueblo]]" ("Junta, keeper of the rights of the people"), headed by Murillo.&lt;ref name="Alto Perú"/&gt;

A quick reaction from the Spanish officials soon defeated these rebellions. An army with 1,000 men sent from Buenos Aires found no resistance at Chuquisaca, took control of the city, and deposed the Junta.&lt;ref name="Alto Perú"/&gt; Similarly, Murillo's 800 men were completely outnumbered by the more than 5,000 men sent from Lima.&lt;ref name="Alto Perú"/&gt; He was later [[Decapitation|beheaded]] along with other leaders and their heads exhibited to the people as deterrent.&lt;ref name="Alto Perú"/&gt; The measures taken against those revolutions reinforced the feeling of inequity among Criollos, more so because they greatly contrasted against the pardon that Martín de Álzaga and others received after serving just a few time in jail. This further deepened the resentment of the locals against the peninsular Spaniards.&lt;ref&gt;Pigna, p. 226, 227{{lang-es|Al difundirse la noticia de los horrores de Chuquisaca [...] creció la indignación de los criollos de todo el virreinato, que advertían claramente la conducta del nuevo virrey que premiaba a los sublevados cuando eran españoles [...] y los masacraba cuando eran insurrectos americanos [...].}}
&lt;br/&gt;
{{lang-en|As news of the horrors of Chuquisaca became known [...] indignation among Criollos grew in all the viceroyalty, who noticed clearly the conduct of the new viceroy that rewarded rebels when they were Spanish [...] and massacred them when they were American revolters.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among others, [[Juan José Castelli]] was present at the proceedings of the [[University of Saint Francis Xavier]] where the ''Syllogism of Chuquisaca'' was developed. This would greatly influence his position during the ''May week''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On November 25, 1809 Cisneros created the Political Surveillance Court with the aim of pursuing the supporters of "French ideologies", and those who encouraged the creation of political regimes that opposed the dependence on Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Pigna, p. 227 {{lang-es|Ante la posibilidad de que estos sucesos se repitieran, [...] el virrey decidió crear un Juzgado de Vigilancia Política [...].}}
&lt;br/&gt;
{{lang-en|With the possibility of such events taking place again, [...] the viceroy decided to create a Political Surveillance Court [...].}}
&lt;/ref&gt; However, he rejected a proposal of the economist José María Romero to banish a number of people which were considered dangerous to the Spanish regime: Saavedra, Paso, Chiclana, Vieytes, Balcarce, Castelli, Larrea, Guido, Viamonte, Moreno, Sáenz and Belgrano, among many others.&lt;ref&gt;Scenna, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; All these measures, and a proclamation issued by the Viceroy to prevent the spreading of news that might be considered subversive, made the Criollos think that a formal pretext would be enough to take actions that would lead to the outbreak of a revolution. In April 1810, Cornelio Saavedra expressed his famous quote to his friends: ''It's not time yet, let the figs ripen and then we'll eat them''.&lt;ref&gt;Saavedra, p. 59 {{lang-es|No es tiempo, dejen ustedes que las brevas maduren y entonces las comeremos.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===May Revolution===
{{main|May Revolution}}
[[File:Cabildoabierto-Subercaseaux-edit.jpg|thumb|The [[open cabildo]] of May 22.]]
The news of the fall of the Junta of Seville reached Buenos Aires in May 1810. With both the king of Spain and the Junta removed of power, many people thought that Cisneros had no legitimacy to govern, starting the [[May Revolution]]. Cisneros tried to calm down the population, to no avail. He called the commanders of the local armies and requested their support, but they denied it. Cisneros was ultimately forced to allow an [[open cabildo]], which would discuss what to do. Although those meetings were usually composed of the wealthiest population, the army and a group of rioters plotted to prevent the entry of many wealthy people and allow [[common people]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;National..., p. 136-137&lt;/ref&gt;

The open cabildo decided to end the mandate of viceroy Cisneros, and establish a [[Junta (Peninsular War)|government Junta]] instead. However, the Cabildo tweaked the will of the open cabildo, and appointed Cisneros as president of the Junta; he would remain in power, albeit under a new title. The Junta made the [[oath of office]], but popular unrest became uncontrollable. By the end of the same day the Junta was appointed, the members resigned, and Cisneros did so as well. Initially, the Cabildo rejected his resignation, but the popular unrest was so high that the Cabildo itself was partially overrun by the rioters. Cisneros' resignation was finally accepted, and the [[Primera Junta]] was appointed instead, with members proposed by the people. Once deposed, Cisneros dispatched a messenger to Córdoba, to inform the former viceroy of the events, and bestowing on him the authority to gather an army and deposethe Junta.&lt;ref&gt;National..., p. 137-138&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to Spain===
After being deposed, Cisneros formally became a common citizen in Buenos Aires, under the protection of the Junta. A few days later, he assisted to a mass in honour of the king Ferdinand VII. However, the Junta distrusted him, so he was banished to the [[Canary Islands]], along with the members of the [[Royal Audiencia of Buenos Aires]], under the pretext that his life was in danger. His wife Inés de Gaztambide stayed in Buenos Aires as his representative, but she left the city afterwards and moved to Montevideo. Montevideo, a city that rejected the Junta of Buenos Aires, welcomed her like a queen.&lt;ref&gt;National..., pp. 138-139&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Liniers counter-revolution]] was completely defeated by the forces from Buenos Aires, and Liniers captured and executed.

Once in Spain, Cisneros moved to Cádiz, to submit himself to the [[trial of residence]]. The government had no complaints about his rule, and promoted him to general captain of Cádiz. He was jailed during an uprising in Spain, and liberated after the return of Ferdinand VII. He was then appointed general captain of his home city of Cartagena in 1823, and died in 1829.&lt;ref&gt;National..., p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Belie Belcan''' is a very popular [[loa]] within 21 Divisiones ([[Dominican Vudú]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ezilikonnen.com/dominican/belie-belcan/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information==
He is considered the patron saint of justice who defends people against evil and enemies within the [[Dominican Vodou|21 Divisions]]. He is considered very polite, understanding, and protective by his devotees. In [[Roman Catholicism]], he is [[Syncretism#Religious syncretism|syncretized]] with [[St. Michael: Roman Catholic traditions and views|Saint Michael the Archangel]]. He is said to work very well with [[Anaisa Pye]], a female [[loa]] syncretized with [[Saint Anne]]. Therefore, in Dominican households, one will often find images of Saint Michael next to images of Saint Anne.

==Historical background==
{{See also|History of Catalonia}}

In 1500 BCE the area that is now known primarily as Catalonia was, along with the rest of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], inhabited by [[Proto-Celtic]] [[Urnfield Culture|Urnfield people]] who brought with them the rite of burning the dead. These [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] people were absorbed by the [[Iberians]] beginning in 600 BCE in a process that would not be complete until the fourth century BCE. These groups came under the rule of various invading groups starting with the [[Phoenicia]]ns and [[Carthage|Carthaginians]], who set up colonies along the coast, including [[Barcelona|Barcino]] (present-day Barcelona) itself. Following the [[Punic Wars]], the Romans replaced the Carthaginians as the dominant power in the Iberian eastern coast, including parts of Catalonia, by 206 BCE. [[Rome]] established [[Latin]] as the official language and imparted a distinctly [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] culture upon the local population, which merged with Roman colonists from the [[Italian peninsula]]. An early precursor to the Catalan language began to develop from a local form of popular [[Latin]] before and during the collapse of the [[Roman Empire]]. Various [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes arrived following nearly six centuries of Roman rule, which had completely transformed the area into the Roman [[province]] of [[Tarraconensis]]. The [[Visigoth]]s established themselves in the fifth century, making their first capital in the Iberian peninsula Barcelona, and they later would move to Toledo. This continued until 718 when [[Muslim]] [[Arab]]s conquered the region in order to pass through the Pyrenees into French territory. With the help of the Frankish, a land border was created commonly known nowadays as Old Catalonia (which would consist of the counties [[County of Barcelona]], [[Ausona]], [[County of Pallars]], [[County of Rosselló]], [[County of Empúries]], [[County of Cerdanya]] and [[County of Urgell]]) which faced Muslim raids but resisted any kind of settlement from them. "New Catalonia" and its native peoples were fully in control of the Arab invaders for around a century. The [[Franks]] on the other side of the Pyrenees held back the main Muslim raiding army which had penetrated virtually unchallenged as far as central [[France]] at the [[Battle of Tours]] in 732. Frankish [[suzerainty]] was then extended over much of present-day Catalonia. Larger wars with the Muslims began in the [[March of Barcelona]] which led to the beginnings of the [[Reconquista]] by Catalan forces over most of Catalonia by the year 801. Barcelona would then become an important center for [[Christian]] forces in the [[Iberian Peninsula]].

[[File:Batalla del Puig por Marzal de Sas (1410-20).jpg|175px|thumbnail|left|[[Battle of the Puig]] by Andreu Marçal de Sax depicting the Christian victory with the aid of [[Saint George]].]]

Catalonia emerged from the conflicts in [[Al-Andalus|Muslim Spain]] as a regional power, as [[Christian]] rulers entrenched themselves in the region during the [[Carolingian]] period. Rulers such as [[Wilfred the Hairy]] became masters of a larger territory encompassing Catalonia. The [[Crown of Aragón]] included the [[Principality of Catalonia]] and the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]] and [[Kingdom of Majorca|Majorca]] (in the [[Balearic Islands]]). The marriage of [[Isabella I of Castile]] and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] was a [[dynastic union]] in which the [[Kingdom of Castile|Kingdom of Castille]] and the [[Kingdom of Aragon]] were under the same crown but kept their own laws, power structures, borders and monetary systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/49691947|title=Imperial Spain 1469-1716|last=Huxtable)|first=Elliott, J. H. (John|date=2002|publisher=Penguin|isbn=0141007036|location=London|oclc=49691947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regional unrest led to conflicts such as the [[Revolt of the Germanies]] in Valencia and Majorca, and the 1640 revolt in Catalonia known as the [[Reapers' War]]. This latter conflict embroiled [[Spain]] in a larger war with France as many Catalan nobles allied themselves with [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]]. The war continued until 1659 and ended with the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees|Peace of the Pyrenees]], which effectively partitioned Catalonia as the northern strip of the March came under French rule, while the rest remained under Spanish [[hegemony]]. The Catalan government took sides with the [[Habsburg]] pretender against the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] one during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] that started in 1705 and ended in 1714. The Catalan failure to defend the continuation of Habsburg rule in Spain culminated in the surrender of Barcelona on 11 September 1714 which came to be commemorated as [[National Day of Catalonia|Catalonia's National Day]].

[[File:Eroberung von Barcelona 1714.jpg|250px|thumbnail|After the Catalan defeat during the [[War of Spanish Succession]], [[Philip V of Spain]] ordered the burning of all the Catalan flags and banners.]]

During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], much of Catalonia was seized by French forces by 1808, as France ruled the entire country of Spain briefly until [[Napoleon]]'s surrender to Allied Armies. In France, strong assimilationist policies integrated many Catalans into French society, while in Spain a Catalan identity was increasingly suppressed in favor of a Spanish national identity. The Catalans regained autonomy during the [[Spanish Second Republic]] from 1932 until [[Francisco Franco]]'s nationalist forces retook Catalonia by 1939. It was not until 1975 and the death of Franco that the Catalans as well as other [[Spaniards]] began to regain their right to cultural expression, which was restarted by the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]]. Since this period, a balance between a sense of local identity versus the broader Spanish one has emerged as the dominant [[political]] force in Catalonia. The former tends to advocate for even greater autonomy and independence; the latter tends to argue for maintaining either a status quo or removal of autonomy and cultural identity, depending on the leanings of the current government. As a result, there tends to be much fluctuation depending on regional and national politics during a given election cycle. Given the stronger centralist tendencies in France, however, French Catalans display a much less dynamic sense of uniqueness, having been integrated more consistently into the unitary French national identity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Geography==
The vast majority of Catalans reside in the autonomous community of Catalonia, in the northeast part of Spain. At least 100,000 Catalan speakers live in the ''Pays Catalan'' in France. An indeterminate number of Catalans emigrated to the Americas during the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonial period]] and to France in the years following the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/48474208|title=El exilio cultural de la Guerra Civil, 1936-1939|date=2001|publisher=Ediciones Universidad Salamanca|others=Abellán, José Luis., Balcells, José María., Pérez Bowie, José Antonio., Universidad de Salamanca., Universidad de León.|isbn=8478009604|edition= 1st|location=Salamanca, España|oclc=48474208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture and society==
[[File:Igualada 2013 - Colla Joves de Valls 3de9f.JPG|200px|thumbnail|right|The [[castell]]s, [[Human tower (gymnastic formation)|human tower]]s, are part of the Catalan culture since 1712 and were declared by [[UNESCO]] to be amongst the [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]].&lt;ref&gt;BBC, [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11742399 Close-Up: Catalonia's human towers]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Described by author [[Walter Starkie]] in ''The Road to Santiago'' as a subtle people, he sums up their national character with a local term ''[[seny]]'' meaning "common sense" or a pragmatic attitude toward life. The counterpart of Catalan "seny" is "rauxa" or madness, epithomized by "crazy", eccentric and creative Catalan artists like [[Antoni Gaudí]], [[Salvador Dalí]], [[Joan Miró]] or [[Antoni Tàpies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/26502930|title=Barcelona|last=1938-2012.|first=Hughes, Robert,|date=1993|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=0679743839|edition= 1st Vintage books |location=New York|oclc=26502930}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/3651105/From-earth-to-eternity.html|title=From earth to eternity|last=Gayford|first=Martin|date=2006-03-25|access-date=2018-08-14|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''masia'' or ''mas'' is a defining characteristic of the Catalan countryside and includes a large house, land, cattle, and an extended family, but this tradition is in decline as the nuclear family has largely replaced the extended family, as in the rest of western [[Europe]]. Catalans in Spain are recognised as a "[[nationality]]" and enjoy a high degree of political autonomy,&lt;ref name="Statute"/&gt; leading to reinforcement of a Catalan identity.

===Language===
{{Main|Languages of Catalonia}}

The [[Catalan language]] is a [[Romance language]]. It is the language closest to [[Occitan language|Occitan]], and it also shares many features with other Romance languages such as [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]], and [[Italian language|Italian]]. There are a number of linguistic varieties that are considered [[Catalan language#Dialects|dialects of Catalan]], among them, the [[dialect]] group with the most speakers, [[Central Catalan]].

The total number of Catalan speakers is over 9.8 million (2011), with 5.9 million residing in Catalonia. More than half of them speak Catalan as a second language, with native speakers being about 4.4 million of those (more than 2.8 in Catalonia).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.demolinguistica.cat/arxiu/web/informe/informe2011.pdf Informe sobre la situació de la llengua catalana (2011)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123162105/http://www.demolinguistica.cat/arxiu/web/informe/informe2011.pdf |date=23 January 2013 }} Report on the situation of the Catalan language (2011) {{ca icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Very few Catalan [[monoglot]]s exist; basically, virtually all of the Catalan speakers in Spain are [[bilingual]] speakers of Catalan and Spanish, with a sizeable population of Spanish-only speakers of immigrant origin (typically born outside Catalonia or with both parents born outside Catalonia) {{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} existing in the major Catalan urban areas as well. In [[Roussillon]], only a minority of French Catalans speak Catalan nowadays, with French being the majority language for the inhabitants after a continued process of [[language shift]].

The inhabitants of the [[Aran valley]] count [[Aranese]]–an [[Occitan]] dialect–rather than Catalan as their own language. These Catalans are also bilingual in Spanish.

In September 2005, the [[.cat]] TLD, the first [[Internet]] language-based top-level domain, was approved for all web pages intending to serve the needs of the Catalan [[linguistic]] and cultural community on the Internet. This community is made up of those who use the Catalan language for their online communication or promote the different aspects of Catalan culture online.

===Traditional clothes===
The traditional dress (now practically only used in [[folkloric]] celebrations) included the ''[[barretina]]'' (a sort of woollen, long cap usually red or purple in colour) and the ''faixa'' (a sort of wide belt) among men, and ''ret'' (a fine net bag to contain hair) among women. The traditional footwear was the ''espardenya'' or [[espadrille]].

[[File:Catalan folk costume.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|Catalan children wearing the traditional outfit, including the [[barretina]].]]

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Catalan cuisine}}

====Traditional diet====
The Catalan diet is part of the [[Mediterranean diet]] and includes the use of [[olive oil]]. Catalan people like to eat veal (''vedella'') and lamb (''xai'').

There are three main daily meals:
* In the morning: a very light breakfast, consisting of fruit or fruit juice, milk, coffee, or ''[[pa amb tomàquet]]'' "bread with tomato". Catalans tend to divide their breakfast into two parts: one early in the morning before going to work or study (first breakfast), and the other one between 10:00 and 12:00 (second breakfast)
* In the afternoon (roughly from 13:00 to 14:30): the main meal of the day, usually comprising three dishes. The first consists of pasta or vegetables, the second of meat or fish, and the third of fruit or yogurt
* In the evening (roughly from 20:00 to 22:30): more food than in the morning, but less than at lunch; very often only a single main dish and fruit; it is common to drink moderate quantities of wine.

In Catalan gastronomy, ''embotits'' (a wide variety of Catalan sausages and cold meats) are very important; these are pork sausages such as ''[[botifarra]]'' or ''[[fuet]]''. In the past, bread (similar to French bread) figured heavily in the Catalan diet; now it is used mainly in the morning (second breakfast, especially among young students and some workers) and supplements the noon meal, at home and in restaurants. Bread is still popular among Catalans; some Catalan fast-food restaurants don't serve hamburgers, but offer a wide variety of sandwiches.

In the past, the poor ate [[soup]] every day and [[rice]] on Thursday and Sunday.

[[File:Xuixo obert.jpg|thumbnail|Catalans have a rich cuisine, including traditional [[dessert]]s like the [[xuixo]]. Also, Catalan chefs like [[Ferran Adrià|Ferran Adrià i Acosta]] or [[Jordi Roca i Fontané]] are widely renowned.]]

The discipline of abstinence, not eating [[meat]] during [[Lent]], once was very strong, but today it is only practiced in the rural areas.

Spicy food is rare in the Catalan diet but there are quite garlicky sauces such as ''[[aioli|allioli]]'' or ''[[romesco]]''.

====Traditional dishes====
{{Main|Catalan cuisine}}
One type of Catalan dish is ''[[escudella]]'', a soup which contains chick peas, potatoes, and vegetables such as green cabbage, celery, carrots, turnips, and meats such as ''botifarra'' (a Catalan sausage), pork feet, salted ham, chicken, and veal. In Northern Catalonia, it is sometimes called ''ollada''.

Other Catalan dishes are ''[[calçots]]'' (similar to [[leek]]s and often eaten with a [[romesco sauce]]) and ''[[escalivada]]''.

===Music===
{{Main|Catalan music}}
Catalan music has one of the oldest documented musical traditions in [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/60328821|title=Els manuscrits musicals a Catalunya fins al segle XIII : l'evolució de la notació musical|last=Joaquim.|first=Garrigosa i Massana,|date=2003|publisher=Institut d'Estudis Ilerdencs|isbn=8489943745|edition= 1st|location=Lleida|oclc=60328821}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Beget.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|Catalans, traditionally devoted Catholics, during its recent history had become less religious. Even so, the presence of religion is maintained through the traditions, values and monuments, like the Church of Sant Cristòfol de Beget.]]

===Religion===
{{Main|Religion in Catalonia}}
The traditional religion in Catalonia is [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]]. However, in the course of recent [[History of Catalonia|history]], Catalonia has undergone several waves of secularization.

The first wave of [[secularization]] happened during the eighteenth century as a result of the [[Enlightenment in Spain|enlightenment]] influence to the [[bourgeoisie]]. The second one happened during the nineteenth century, that had a huge impact on the [[Working class|lower]] and [[middle class]], but was interrupted by the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–1939).{{sfn|Capdevila|2013|p= 9}}

After the [[Francoist regime]], the population, dissatisfied with the dictatorship, accused the [[Catholic Church]] of being a supporter of the regime and this led to another wave of secularization that extends since the 1980s. During the 1990s most of the population of Catalonia was non-practising Catholic.{{sfn|Capdevila|2013|p= 10}} Nowadays 52.4% of Catalans are Catholic, practising or not, 30.2% of Catalans are [[agnostic]] or [[atheist]], and there is also a considerable amount of other religions: 7.3% [[Muslim]], 2.5% [[Evangelical]], 1.3% [[Buddhism]], and 1.2% [[Orthodox Christians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date= 8 April 2015 |title= El 45% dels catalans afirma que no té creences religioses |trans-title= 45% of the Catalans claims to have no beliefs |url= http://www.ara.cat/societat/poblacio-catalana-declara-seguidora-religio_0_1335466612.html |language= Catalan |newspaper= [[Ara (newspaper)|Ara]] |location= Barcelona |access-date= 5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social conditions===
Catalonia is one of the richest and most well developed regions in [[Southern Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ara.cat/economia/kenneth-rogoff-FMI-Catalunya-paisos-rics-mon_0_456555186.html|title=L'execonomista en cap de l'FMI: "Catalunya, aïllada, seria un dels països més rics del món"|work=Ara.cat|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barcelona]] is among the most industrialized metropolises and a both regional capital and a magnet for various migrants from other regions in Spain, as well as from foreign countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://citiesofrefuge.eu/news/barcelona-secrets-intercultural-approach-migration-governance|title=Barcelona secrets: the intercultural approach to migration governance|website=Cities of Refuge|language=en|access-date=2018-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Celebrations===
Fire is the element used in most important traditional festivals, which are derived from pagan roots. These celebrations have a high acceptance of fire between the Catalans, like the Flame of Canigó to the [[Bonfires of Saint John]].

[[File:Diada de Sant Jordi de 2007 Rambles Barcelona.jpg|250px|thumbnail|right|[[Saint George's Day (Spain)#Catalonia|La Diada de Sant Jordi]], held on 23 April, is an old Catalan celebration in which men give women roses, and women give men a book.]]

Historical memory is the second axis of celebrations in Catalonia, where the Catalan people reunite with their date of birth as a people. This explains the many parties associated with the Reconquest, especially [[Moors and Christians]], like in Lleida.

Finally, the religious celebrations are the last pillar. Amongst them are [[St. George's Day]] and the celebrations of [[Vincent of Saragossa|Saint Vincent Martyr]] and [[Anthony the Great|Saint Anthony Abbot]]. The maximum expressions of this element are the Easter processions and performances of the Passion. Some festivals have a complicated relationship with religion, such as Carnival and Dance of Death, or specific aspects such as the [[Tió de Nadal]] (Christmas piñata) and the "Caganer".

Other key elements of a Catalan celebration are: food, central to every party and especially to the pig slaughter and harvest festivals; contests such as human towers, choice of major and festive floats; music, songs and bands; processions; dances; and animals, especially bulls and representations of mythological creatures. The [[Patum]] of Berga has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

===Symbolism===
{{Main|National symbols of Catalonia}}
Because of their intertwining history, much of the traditional symbols of Catalonia coincide with Aragon, Valencia and the Balearic Islands. The oldest Catalan symbol is the shield of Catalonia, or ''bars of Aragon'', one of Europe's oldest heraldic emblems. A popular legend dates it back to the ninth century: it is said that the four red lines are the result of [[Charles the Bald]]'s four fingers which smeared blood on the gold shield of [[Wilfred the Hairy]] (Guifré el Pelós) as a reward for having fought valiantly against the [[Normans]].

The royal flag, inspired by the shield, is perhaps the most representative symbol of Catalan culture.

As for anthems, "The Reapers" (''[[Els Segadors]]'') is the official anthem of Catalonia and is also used in the other lands of the Principality; the [[Balanguera]] represents the people from the Balearic Islands and, in the case of Valencia, the official "Anthem of the Exhibition" (''[[Himne de l'Exposició]]'') alongside [[Muixeranga]] as symbols of the country.

'''Christopher Nolan''' (6 September 1965 – 20 February 2009) was an Irish poet and author.&lt;ref name="it-obituary"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/0220/breaking29.htm|title=Death of Irish author Christopher Nolan announced|work=The Irish Times|date=20 February 2009|accessdate=20 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born in [[Mullingar]], Ireland, but later moved to [[Dublin]]. He was educated at the Central Remedial Clinic School, [[Mount Temple Comprehensive School]] and at [[Trinity College, Dublin]]. His first book was published when he was fifteen. He won the [[Whitbread Book Awards|Whitbread Book Award]] for his autobiography in 1987. He was also awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Letters in the UK, the medal of excellence from the United Nations Society of Writers, and a Person of the Year award in Ireland.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Christopher Nolan was born to parents Joseph and Bernadette Nolan. He grew up in [[Mullingar]], Ireland. Due to [[asphyxiation]] at birth, Christopher was born with permanent impairment of his "nerve-signaling system, a condition he said is now labelled [[dystonia]]."&lt;ref name="PW"/&gt; Because of these complications, Nolan was born with [[cerebral palsy]], and could only move his head and eyes. At the beginning of his life people believed he was intellectually disabled, but his mother proved them wrong. Bernadette brought her son to see Dr. Ciaran Barry. He was a consultant of physical medicine and rheumatology who possessed a particular interest in children with cerebral Palsy. Dr. Barry was attached to the Central Remedial Clinic. He played games with Christopher, the toddler, and in so doing noted the child anticipated his actions and informed his mother that he was of sound mind. 

Due to the severity of the palsy, he used a wheelchair. In an interview, his father explained how, at the age of 10, he was placed on medication by Dr. Barry that "relaxed him so he could use a pointer attached to his head to type."&lt;ref name="independent-obit"/&gt; To write, Nolan used a special computer and keyboard; in order to help him type, his mother held his head in her cupped hands while Christopher painstakingly picked out each word, letter by letter, with a pointer attached to his forehead.

He communicated with others by moving his eyes, using a signal system. When he was young, his father told him stories and read passages from [[James Joyce]], [[Samuel Beckett]] and [[D. H. Lawrence]] to keep his mind stimulated. His mother strung up letters of the alphabet in the kitchen, where she kept up a stream of conversation. His sister, Yvonne, sang songs and acted out skits.&lt;ref name="Seattle"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://o.seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/books/2008779050_nolan24.html|title=Writer Christopher Nolan overcame severe disability|date=25 February 2009|accessdate=2010-03-17|newspaper=Seattle Times|author=William Grimes}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother stated that "he wrote extensively since the age of 11 and went on to write many poems, short stories and two plays, many of which were published." Many of the writings described here by Nolan's mother were compiled for his first publication, the chapbook Dam-Burst of Dreams.&lt;ref name="nytimes-mcdowell-1988"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/06/books/rebirth-of-dam-burst-irish-author-s-first-book.html|title=REBIRTH OF 'DAM BURST,' IRISH AUTHOR'S FIRST BOOK|accessdate=2014-08-10|date=1988-06-06|author=Edwin McDowell|newspaper=New York Times Review of Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mature work===
Upon becoming a teenager, Nolan received his education from the [[Central Remedial Clinic|Central Remedial Clinic School]], [[Mount Temple Comprehensive School]] and at [[Trinity College, Dublin]]. His first book was published when he was fifteen; he was also awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Letters in the UK, the medal of excellence from the [[United Nations Society of Writers]], and a Person of the Year award in Ireland. At the age of fifteen, he published his collection of poems titled ''Dam-Burst of Dreams''. He wrote an account of his childhood, ''[[Under the Eye of the Clock]]'', published by St. Martin's Press, which won him the UK's Whitbread Book of the Year Award in 1987 at the age of 21. He soon dropped out of Trinity College to write a novel entitled ''[[The Banyan Tree]]'' (1999).

Nolan spent more than a decade writing ''The Banyan Tree''. According to ''[[The New York Times]]'' the book is a multigenerational story of a dairy-farming family in Nolan's native county of [[Westmeath]]. The story is seen through the eyes of the aging mother.&lt;ref name="nytimes-obit"/&gt; It was inspired, he told ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', by the image of "an old woman holding up her skirts as she made ready to jump a rut in a field."&lt;ref name="PW"/&gt; A review of the book was done in ''The New York Times'' by Maghan O’Rourke. She reviews the book and relates it to [[James Joyce]]'s ''Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man'', in the story the protagonist leaves his mother in Ireland while he moves on to travel the world.&lt;ref name="nytimes-orourke-2000"&gt;{{cite news |last=O’Rourke |first=Maghan |date=26 March 2000 |title=Left Behind |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/26/books/left-behind.html |newspaper=New York Times Review of Books |accessdate=10 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nolan however, gives the reader a version of the mother's story. "And so, in the end, one suspects that he wants Minnie's good-natured, commonplace ways to stand as their own achievement, reminding us that life continues in the places left behind."&lt;ref name="nytimes-obit"/&gt;

While working on a new novel, on 20 February 2009, Nolan died suddenly, aged 43. However, nothing has been released from the book since his death.

===Death===
Christopher Nolan died at age 43 in [[Beaumont Hospital, Dublin|Beaumont hospital]] in Dublin on 20 February 2009. He died after a piece of salmon became trapped in his airway. Irish president [[Mary McAleese]], upon hearing the news, said:&lt;ref name="nytimes-obit"/&gt;

{{cquote|Christopher Nolan was a gifted writer who attained deserved success and acclaim throughout the world for his work, his achievements all the more remarkable given his daily battle with cerebral palsy.}}

Minister for Arts [[Martin Cullen]] TD reflected that people should draw inspiration from Nolan's life. "With grace and courage, and with the support of his family, he never gave up and he never gave in [...] His bold creativity has ensured a written legacy."&lt;ref name="it-obituary"/&gt;

==Writing==

===Publications===
Nolan's autobiography ''Under the Eye of the Clock'' (published 1987), won the [[Whitbread Award]] and was named Book of the Year. Although an autobiography, it is narrated by a fictional character named Joseph Meehan who details Nolan's life as a third-person biography. The book reveals the deep relationship between Nolan and his mother, whom he calls Nora. ''Under the Eye of the Clock'' shows how Nolan's parents engaged him in conversation and outdoor activities like hiking and horseback riding. The book was a best-seller in Britain and the United States. Nolan's writing style is often compared to James Joyce and Dylan Thomas. Critics also point out Nolan's distinct writing style omits articles and uses participle construction other than relative clauses.&lt;ref&gt;Contemporary Literary Criticism. Ed. Roger Matuz, Cathy Falk, and Sean R. Pollock. Vol. 58. Detroit: Gale Research, 1990. p361-367. From Literature Criticism Online.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nolan wrote ''The Banyan Tree'' (published 1999) in perspective of a country woman, Minnie O’Brien. The novel spans 80 years of Minnie’s life, cutting from present to past to show the individuality of a woman and a mother who is determined to save the family’s farm. The ''[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' appreciated "Nolan's soaring language and lilting alliterative style [which] suffuse [...] much of the book with a sense of the miraculous" and the ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'' found it "richly – even baroquely – told [...] Nolan writes with verve."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780385720687&amp;view=quotes Random House]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dam-Burst of Dreams'' (published 1981), provided Nolan critical acclaim that compared him to the works of [[W. B. Yeats]] and [[James Joyce]]. The collection was published four years after Nolan was administered [[Lioresal]] but some of the poems were written when Nolan was just 12 years old. The title of the collection emphasized the theme surrounding most of the poems, the overflow and release of his mental intellect. His poems in the collection are heavy with alliteration, and incorporate words invented by Nolan utilizing the combination of pre-existing root words.

===Influences and mentors===
Nolan often discouraged inquiries about his literary influences. During an interview he once wrote: "Everything is an influence to a person trapped in a nightmare!"&lt;ref name="PW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/411351-PW_Christopher_Nolan_Against_All_Odds.php|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130131215753/http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/411351-PW_Christopher_Nolan_Against_All_Odds.php|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-01-31|title=PW: Christopher Nolan: Against All Odds|accessdate=2010-03-12|author=Geracimos, Ann}} &lt;/ref&gt; Nolan's enthusiasm for literature however was largely attributed to his father's appreciation of [[James Joyce]], [[Samuel Beckett]], and [[D. H. Lawrence]]. Every night his father would read him several passages from Joyce's ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' and other poetic works.&lt;ref name="LA-obit"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/feb/25/local/me-christopher-nolan25|work=Los Angeles Times|date=25 February 2009|title=Christopher Nolan dies at 43; Irish poet and novelist|accessdate=2010-03-12|author=Associated Press|publisher=Eddy Hartenstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; Listening to such pieces not only kept Nolan stimulated but piqued his interest in writing his own poetry.

In a poetry competition hosted by the [[Scope (charity)|British Spastics Society]], Nolan received praise from writer [[Edna Healey]], wife of then Chancellor of the Exchequer [[Denis Healey]]. As a judge of the competition she was one of the early recognizers of Nolan's writing abilities. Healey was later invited as a guest on the [[BBC]] program titled "The World this Weekend." On the broadcast in response to the question "what was the most impressive moment," she remarked that reading Nolan's work: "Was the highspot of my year."&lt;ref name="guard-obit"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/feb/23/christopher-nolan-writer|work=The Guardian|date=23 February 2009|title=Christopher Nolan|accessdate=2010-03-12|author= Hawtree, Christopher|publisher=Guardian Media Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When enrolling him for secondary school, Nolan's family struggled to convince educators that Nolan would be able to function in a regular class setting. [[Mount Temple Comprehensive School]] headmaster John Medleycott believed it was possible to devise a set-up to accommodate Nolan:&lt;ref name="irish-obit"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/obituaries/2009/0221/1224241576645.html|work=Irish Times|date=23 February 2009|title=Gifted writer whose voice burst out of the silence|accessdate=2010-03-15|publisher=The Irish Times Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|We tried not to make concessions [...] He came into a mixed ability class and went to all his classes. We didn’t demand homework, but he followed the normal school curriculum. We didn’t smother him: it was up to him to sink or swim, and he swam.}}

Thanks to Medleycott, Nolan was accepted into Mount Temple and later was received by [[Trinity College, Dublin]] after Medleycott provided a personal recommendation.&lt;ref name="PW" /&gt;

==Pop culture==

Nolan's life story and works have been referenced to in several musical works. Rock band [[U2]], whose members attended school with Nolan, wrote their song "[[Miracle Drug]]" (from ''[[How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb]]'') about him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artscouncil.ie/aosdana/biogs/literature/christophernolan.html Artscouncil]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bono]] said of Nolan:
{{cquote|We all went to the same school and just as we were leaving, a fellow called Christopher Nolan arrived. He had been deprived of oxygen for two hours when he was born, so he was quadriplegic. But his mother believed he could understand what was going on and used to teach him at home. Eventually, they discovered a drug that allowed him to move one muscle in his neck. So they attached this unicorn device to his forehead and he learned to type. And out of him came all these poems that he'd been storing up in his head. Then he put out a collection called ''Dam-Burst of Dreams'', which won a load of awards and he went off to university and became a genius. All because of a mother's love and a medical breakthrough.}}

On [[R.E.M.]]'s 1988 ''[[Green (R.E.M. album)|Green]]'' album, the song "[[The Wrong Child]]" was inspired by Nolan's memoir ''[[Under the Eye of the Clock]]''.&lt;ref name="independent-obit"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/obituaries/christopher-nolan-1649080.html|work=Irish Independent|date=22 February 2009|title=Christopher Nolan|accessdate=2010-03-15|publisher=Independent News &amp; Media PLC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song deals with a child who wishes to play with his peers outside but is instead laughed at. Throughout the song the refrain "I'm not supposed to be like this / But it's okay" is repeated several times.

Nolan was once approached by a Los Angeles film producer who was interested in making his biography into a movie. Nolan declined the offer and responded:&lt;ref name="nytimes-obit"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/24/books/24nolan.html|work=New York Times|date=24 February 2009|title=Christopher Nolan, Irish Author, Dies at 43|author=William Grimes|accessdate=2010-03-15|publisher=The New York Times Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|I want to highlight the creativity within the brain of a cripple [...] and while not attempting to hide the crippledom I want instead to filter all sob-storied sentiment from his portrait and dwell upon his life, his laughter, his vision, and his nervous normality. Can we ever see eye-to-eye on that schemed scenario?}}

==Honours==
Every year, his secondary school [[Mount Temple Comprehensive School]] holds an award show in his honour.
The "Eye of the Clock Awards" are hosted in the last week of school for all students.
These awards are given to students for extraordinary efforts in school and are inspired by Nolan's efforts in school.

After Christine developed cancer, her son Martin sometimes took her place as Holtorf's traveling companion, beginning in 2007. After her final trip in May 2009, Christine settled in [[Bavaria]], where the couple wed several weeks before her death in June 2010. Holtorf resumed traveling with Martin or with Elke Dreweck until 2014.

For the first five years, Holtorf and his companion traveled through Africa, thereafter shipping the car to South America to continue their journeys there.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Through subsequent years, they traveled upwards through Central America, the United States and Canada before traveling south again and shipping the car to Australia and Asia and through the Caribbean and into other regions of the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3365">'''Henry Hamilton Hadley''' (19 July 1826 – 1 August 1864) was an American theologian.

==Early years and education==
Hadley was born in [[Fairfield, New York]], 19 July 1826.&lt;ref name=acab&gt;{{Cite Appletons'|wstitle=Hadley, James|year=1892}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was the youngest son of Prof. James Hadley, of [[Buffalo, New York]], and the brother of philologist [[James Hadley (scholar)|James Hadley]].

He graduated from [[Yale College]] in 1847.  

==Career==
After graduation, he pursued for one year a general course of study at Yale, and then entered the [[Yale Divinity School|Theological Department]] of the College. In Sept. 1850 he went to [[Andover Theological Seminary]], where he completed his studies in preparation for the ministry in 1851. In May of that year, he became Tutor in Yale College, and continued in this office until Dec. 1852.

At the beginning of the year 1853, owing to doubts in regard to his fitness for the pastoral work, he turned his attention to the study of law, and removed to the city of New York. His scholastic tendencies, however, were too strong to be resisted, and in 1854 he returned to New Haven, where he devoted himself for four years to the careful study of the [[Hebrew language]] and the [[Old Testament]] Scriptures. For part of this period he was also employed as an instructor in Greek and Latin at the New Haven [[Russell Military Academy | Collegiate and Commercial Institute]]. In 1858 he was appointed instructor in Hebrew, in [[Union Theological Seminary (New York City)|Union Theological Seminary]] in New York, and in 1862 he became Assistant Professor of Hebrew in that institution. He continued in that position till the time of his death. In 1861, after the death of Prof. Gibbs, he was elected to the Professorship of the Hebrew language and literature in this college, but he held this office only for a single year, and during that time discharged its duties in connection with the duties of his place in New York.

He had already become one of the most successful and promising scholars in the country in his department, and in his death the cause of theological learning sustained a loss which is not easily measured. His devotion to the cause of the country in the [[American Civil War]] was manifested from the very outset. He was with great difficulty, and only by the urgent advice of his friends, prevented from enlisting as a soldier in the [[Union Army]]; and, when at length he gave up going himself, he provided successively two substitutes to serve in his place. Not content with this, after the close of the Seminary year in June 1865, he engaged in the work of the [[United States Sanitary Commission]], and served in one of the Hospitals at [[City Point, Virginia]]. Here he was prostrated by sickness, and, after lingering for a while, was compelled to return homeward. He had pursued his journey only as far as Washington DC, when his death occurred, Aug, 1, 1864.

'''Johannes-Andreas Hanni''' (1957 – 6 November 1982) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-[[Estonians|Estonian]] [[serial killer]] who murdered three people in Estonia in 1982 with the aid of his wife Pille. 

==The murders==
Johannes-Andreas Hanni grew up in a family of devout Baptists and was, he later claimed, badly treated by his parents; particularly by his  minister father [[:et:Jaan Hanni|Jaan Hanni]], whom he came to hate. He had a lengthy record as a juvenile repeat criminal offender and spent a number of his adolescent years in prisons and reformatories. He married Pille Toomla, a trolley driver, on 11 December 1981 and worked as a waiter in the Palace Hotel restaurant in [[Tallinn]].&lt;ref name="maaja"&gt;[http://maaja.ee/andreas-hanni-tallinna-inimsooja/ maaja] ''Andreas Hanni – Tallinna inimsööja'' 9 April 2007. Retrieved 29 August 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hanni stabbed to death his first victim, Eimar Vibo, a sailor from [[Saaremaa]], on 5 March 1982 in Valdeku Street in [[Nõmme]] and cut out part of his thigh and brought with him to his home. He then explained to his wife Pille that he was going to eat it as he "had wished to try out eating human flesh for a long time already". According to a later interview with police, Pille claimed her husband did this with "pleasure"; frying the meat in a pan on top of the stove. On 23 May 1982, in [[Jõhvi]], Hanni stabbed to death a 75-year-old [[Belarus]]ian pensioner named Ivan Sivitsky in his garden cottage sauna and cut off his genitals, wishing to use it as some kind of a [[dildo]].&lt;ref name="Eesti Ekspress"&gt;[http://ekspress.delfi.ee/kuum/noukogude-eesti-kannibal?id=27675713 Eesti Ekspress] ''Nõukogude Eesti kannibal'' 13 March 2008. Retrieved 29 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

In late July the same year he raped and killed a middle-aged [[Russians|Russian]] female vagrant named Yevgenia Koltsova who was picking raspberries in the forest between [[Laagri]] and [[Saue]]. In late August 1982, Hanni and his wife planned to murder a random taxi driver in Tallinn and on 2 September 1982, the pair carried out the plan; attacking driver Alari Kivi with a knife. Kivi fought back but was left with serious, but not life-threatening injuries. Hanni was arrested in connection to the attack and three murders on 2 October 1982.&lt;ref name="maaja"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Õhtuleht"&gt;[https://www.ohtuleht.ee/311321/nomme-kannibali-andreas-hanni-lesk-pille-kirjutas-oma-elust-sokeeriva-raamatu Õhtuleht] ''Nõmme kannibali Andreas Hanni lesk Pille kirjutas oma elust šokeeriva raamatu'' 12 January 2009. Retrieved 29 August 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Before the court hearings, a psychiatric evaluation of three specialists took place; among them, noted Estonian psychiatrist Anti Liiv. He later wrote: "The Cannibal was especially charmed by female lingerie. He himself preferred to sleep always in female nightgown and at the time of an [[Sexual intercourse|intercourse]] he put on a bra. In addition, the Cannibal had (with the knowledge of his wife) a multitude of lovers from both sexes."&lt;ref name="Eesti Ekspress" /&gt;

Johannes-Andreas Hanni later hanged himself in prison before sentencing in November of 1982. His wife, Pille Hanni, was convicted on charges of accessory to murder and spent nearly twelve years in [[Harku]] women's prison before being released. She later changed her name and moved to Finland.&lt;ref name="Eesti Ekspress" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Õhtuleht" /&gt;

In 2008, Pille Hanni shocked the Estonian public when she published the book ''Ma armastasin kiskjat'' ("I Loved the Predator"). Critics such as psychiatrist Anti Liiv took issue with Hanni profiting from the murders and painting herself as a victim, rather than as a willing participant in the murders.&lt;ref name="Õhtuleht" /&gt;

A [[Imperial Count|Count]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (Reichsgraf), (created by letters patent dated Vienna, 12 March 1748 for Envoy Peter de Salis-[[Soglio, Switzerland|Soglio]] (1675-1749), of Chur and Chiavenna, and his son [[Jerome, 2nd Count de Salis|Jerome]] (Naturalized British in 1731), by [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Francis I]]), John de Salis was the only child of Lt. Colonel [[John Eugène, 8th Count de Salis-Soglio|John Eugène, 8th Count de Salis]] (1891-1949),&lt;ref&gt;Burke's Irish Family Records, ed. Hugh Montgomery-Massingberd, Burke's Peerage Ltd, London, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; Irish Guards, by his Roman wife Maria Camilla (1926-1953), daughter of General Umberto Presti di Camarda by Teresa (d.1993), daughter of Filippo Nereo Vignola,&lt;ref&gt;Filippo Nereo Vignola was an amateur painter and dialect poet, as well as Podesta of Verona and Superintendent of the Museum of [[Castelvecchio (Verona)|Castelvecchio]] in Verona and Vicenza&lt;/ref&gt; of Mezzane and Verona.

The grandson of the British diplomat, Irish landowner and Catholic re-convert Sir [[John Francis Charles, 7th Count de Salis-Soglio]], his earliest years were spent at 10 Priory Walk, Kensington, and 26 Roedean Crescent, Roehampton Gate, SW15. His father died when he was under two and his mother when he was five, his step-father when he was 10 and one of his two paternal uncles when he was four. His paternal grandparents had also died, in 1902 and 1939, so he was subsequently brought-up, inter-alia, by Franco-Belgian cousins in France (the widow and family of the 3rd [[Duc de Magenta]] at [[Château de Sully|Sully]], in particular), his remaining paternal uncle in Wiltshire, and his Veronese maternal grandmother, Teresa Vignola Presti.

He was educated at [[Downside School|Downside]], read law at [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]] (LLB (1972) and LLM), and was called to the Bar, [[Grays Inn]] (1970). Later he was a tenant and then door-tenant, at 1 Brick Court, Middle Temple, EC4, and from 1972 lived at 12 First Street, SW3 and then from 1975 in two houses knocked together at 28 Upper Cheyne Row, Chelsea, SW3. Whilst in London he was also a member of the board of management of the [[Hospital of St John and St Elizabeth]].

Alongside learning and practicing the law he served in the [[Officer Training Corps#Cambridge University|Cambridge University Officer Training Corps]] (CUOTC), the [[Honourable Artillery Company|HAC]] (within the [[Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve]]), then in 1972, after meeting its then Colonel, [[Gilbert Monckton, 2nd Viscount Monckton of Brenchley|Viscount Monckton]], one of whose sisters-in-law happened to be married to one of John's first cousins, transferred to the [[9th/12th Royal Lancers]] (Prince of Wales's).&lt;ref&gt;London Gazette: Count John Bernard Philip Humbert DE SALIS (494322), 9/12 L. to be 2nd Lt.

The combination of law of war, humanitarian instincts, soldiering and some family precedent (his father had been the Knight of Justice of the [[Order of St. John of Jerusalem]] delegate for the revision of the [[Geneva Convention]] in July 1929) lead De Salis to become the delegate of [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] Missions in the Middle East (Beirut, 1982&lt;ref&gt;'The War of Numbers' by Judith Tucker, ''MERIP Reports'', No. 108/109, The Lebanon War (September - October, 1982), pp. 47-50. Quoting John de Salis in the [[Washington Post]] of 4 August 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;) and Africa (Rhodesia), and head of delegation in Iraq (1980–81) and Thailand (1981-84, Cambodian refugees), and their special envoy in Lebanon (1982). In July 1983 de Salis wrote: "It is a heartbreaking fact that ICRC being essentially concerned with the victims of armed conflicts, is more directly concerned operationally with the ''relief'' of suffering rather than its ''abolition''."&lt;ref&gt;Extract from a letter to the editor of [[The Times]], published 20 July 1983, in reply to an article by [[William Shawcross]]&lt;/ref&gt;

On leaving England and moving to Switzerland he became a special officer in the Swiss Army's [[Panzergrenadiers]], and set about a new career as a financier: as partner of Gautier Salis et Cie Geneva (1989–96), vice-chairman of Bank Lips Zurich (1996–98), managing director of European Capital Partners (Switzerland) SA (1999-), and as director of Amadeus SA Geneva (2000-).&lt;ref&gt;Debrett's, ''People of Today'', 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The Anatomy of Melancholy by Robert Burton frontispiece 1638 edition.jpg|thumb|100px|De Salis listed melancholia as his sole recreation.]]
In the meantime he had taken over his grandmother's 160 acre farm in the Valle di Buri, Mezzane di Sotto, and developed it from dairy to vineyard.&lt;ref&gt;In 1995 he inherited the fourteenth century Nichesola house (Palazzo Somaglia-Stoppazzola/Palazzo Salis-Soglio) in Verona's Via Santa Felicita from his godfather Scipio, Conti Somaglia di Stoppazzola.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2010 Conti de Salis-Soglio Wines Verona had taken shape, partly inspired by his courageous and visionary [[Valtelline]] cousin Conte Cesare Sertoli Salis of [[Tirano]] and Milan (1952-2005) and his ''Canua Sforzato'', akin to Valpolicella's [[Amarone]]. John's eighteenth century ancestors, [[Peter, 3rd Count de Salis|3rd Count Peter]] in particular, had also been growers of [[hemp]] and vines in eighteenth century Valtelline.&lt;ref&gt;Fane de Salis MSS&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;By 2014 his precarious and rather over ambitious operation comprised 8 acres of olives, 12 acres of vines for his own production of [[Amarone]] ([[Corvina]], Corvinino, [[Rondinella]] and [[Molinara (grape)|Molinara]], [[Croatina]], Oseleta, [[Raboso (grape)|Raboso]], Veronese and Dindarella grapes) and [[Pinot Noir|Pinot Nero]] for his neo-Burgundian ''Monte Rugoli'', with 80 acres for a while with the local agence Tenuta S. Antonio.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the above Count de Salis was a member of the British Association of the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]]; had the Gold Medal with Swords (Beirut) 1982; was a Knight of Justice of the [[Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George]]; a Knight Grand Cross of the [[Order of the White Elephant]] (Thailand); and an hereditary [[Knight of the Golden Spur (HRE)|Knight of the Golden Spur (Eques Auratus)]] (1571).&lt;ref&gt;For [[Grisons]] envoy Giovanni Battista de Salis, the elder (1521-1597), of the Casa Alta, Soglio, invested by [[Pope Pius V]], 11 April 1571, perpetuating an earlier investiture of 1568.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was next male representative of Charles, second and last [[Charles Fane, 2nd Viscount Fane|Viscount Fane]] and Baron of Loughuyre (aka [[Lough Gur]]), and of Vice-Admiral [[Francis William Drake]], of [[Hillingdon]], sometime governor of Newfoundland (1752-4), younger brother of the last Drake baronet of Buckland Abbey, and thus heir-general of Admiral Sir [[Francis Drake]] himself. His only listed recreation was ''melancholia''.&lt;ref&gt;Debrett's, ''People of Today'', 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clubs==
He was a member of the [[Cavalry and Guards Club|Cavalry and Guards']], [[Beefsteak Club|Beefsteak]], Cercle de la Terasse (Geneva), Royal Bangkok Sports, and [[Chelsea Arts Club|Chelsea Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;Debrett's, ''People of Today'', 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
He was firstly married to Samaritana Contessina di Serego [[Scaliger|della Scala]] (born 1950 in [[Verona]], [[Italy]]), daughter of Dr. Cortesia Conte di Serego, on 20 January 1973. Months later their marriage was [[Annulment|annulled]] and then [[Dissolution (law)|dissolved]] in 1985. They had no children.

He then married ([[Ormont-Dessus|Vers l’Eglise]], Vaud 1986) Marie-Claude (born in 1956 in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]), third daughter of [[Swiss Army]] Colonel René-Henri Wüst and Marie-Thérèse Bussard. The couple had three children:
*John-Maximilian Henry Fane de Salis, 10th Count de Salis-Soglio (b. 1986) 
*Lara Anastasia Fane de Salis (b. 1995)
*Camille Charlotte Fane de Salis (b. 1995)

'''Kyle John Turley''' (born September 24, 1975) is a former [[American football]] [[offensive lineman]] who played eight seasons in the [[National Football League]] (NFL).  Selected 7th overall in the [[1998 NFL draft]], Turley played five seasons for the [[New Orleans Saints]] and a year with the [[St. Louis Rams]] before a serious back injury sidelined him for the 2004 and 2005 seasons.  He returned to football in 2006 as a member of the [[Kansas City Chiefs]], where he spent the last two years of his career before announcing his retirement in December 2007.  Turley's high level of play earned him [[All-Pro]] honors for the 2000 season and a [[Pro Bowl]] invite following the 2001 season.  His career is best remembered by many for a 2001 incident in which he ripped off an opposing player's helmet and tossed it downfield, playing a key factor in his team losing the game but also earning the respect of many Saints fans for his defense of the quarterback.  Turley played college football at [[San Diego State Aztecs football|San Diego State]].

Following his retirement from football, Turley set out on a music career that included the release of several albums and the launch of his own record label.  Playing his "power country" style of music, Turley opened for a number of well-known musical acts, including in 2010 when he went on tour with [[Hank Williams III]].  Turley has also been outspoken and involved in a number of player health issues post-retirement, particularly in regards to the neurological problems resulting from his football career ([[Early-onset Alzheimer's disease|early onset Alzheimer's]], [[Chronic traumatic encephalopathy|CTE symptomatic]], [[seizures]], [[vertigo]]) and his use of [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] as treatment.  Turley is a board member and active supporter of the Gridiron Greats Assistance Fund, an organization providing medical care and other forms of assistance to retired NFL players in dire need.

==Early years==

==Professional career==

===New Orleans Saints===
Turley was selected 7th overall by the [[New Orleans Saints]] in the [[1998 NFL draft]].  Initially not projected as a high first round pick, Turley's draft stock rose dramatically after turning in a stellar 4.93 seconds for the [[40-yard dash]] at the [[NFL combine]].&lt;ref name="espn combine"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Drehs|first1=Wayne|title=Wealth is measured in tenths of a second|url=http://a.espncdn.com/nfl/s/2002/0221/1338037.html|accessdate=August 10, 2016|work=ESPN|date=February 21, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Turley's performance caught the eye of then-Saints coach [[Mike Ditka]], and the team subsequently made him the first offensive linemen selected in the 1998 draft.&lt;ref name="espn combine" /&gt;  He signed a six-year contract on July 24, 1998.&lt;ref name="chiefs bio"&gt;{{cite web|title=KYLE TURLEY #74|url=http://www.kcchiefs.com/player/kyle_turley/|website=kcchiefs.com|accessdate=August 5, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210030650/http://www.kcchiefs.com/player/kyle_turley/|archive-date=February 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turley played a total of five seasons for the Saints, making an immediate impact by starting 15 games his rookie season and earning all-rookie honors from ''[[Pro Football Weekly]]'', ''Football News'', and ''[[Football Digest]]''.&lt;ref name="chiefs bio" /&gt;  A durable presence on the Saints offensive line, Turley missed only one game due to ankle injury during his five years in New Orleans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kyle Turley|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/T/TurlKy20.htm|website=Pro Football Reference|accessdate=September 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Haugh|first1=David|title=Turley joins fray for NFL retirees|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-11-28/sports/0711280093_1_nfl-retirees-kyle-turley-saints-coach|accessdate=September 28, 2016|work=Chicago Tribune|date=November 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Turley would prove to be a versatile player as well, starting mostly at left guard his rookie season, then moving to right tackle the next three seasons, and over to left tackle in 2002.&lt;ref name="chiefs bio" /&gt;  His strong play earned him first team [[All-Pro]] honors following the 2000 season&lt;ref name="chiefs bio" /&gt; and an invitation to the [[Pro Bowl]] as a substitute following the 2001 season.&lt;ref name="latimes dirty" /&gt;  He would turn down the Pro Bowl invite to serve as grand marshall of the [[Krewe of Endymion|Endymion Parade]] during [[New Orleans Mardi Gras|Mardi Gras]], however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex-ICC standout turns down Pro Bowl offer|url=http://www.djournal.com/news/ex-icc-standout-turns-down-pro-bowl-offer/article_20371ba6-294d-57b3-a779-012fc31c4f0b.html|accessdate=June 7, 2017|work=djournal.com|agency=Associated Press|date=February 6, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time in New Orleans, Turley became a fan favorite for his spirited style of play and colorful personality.&lt;ref name="latimes dirty" /&gt;  His popularity especially took off after the helmet tossing incident of 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilde|first1=Jason|title=Supportive Packers linemen say Turley far from Sainthood|url=http://journaltimes.com/news/state-and-regional/supportive-packers-linemen-say-turley-far-from-sainthood/article_0bfdc4e2-29c6-5501-be82-7c2eaa026b38.html|accessdate=August 10, 2016|work=The Journal Times|date=September 14, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; with many Saints fans lining up to buy his jersey afterwards.&lt;ref name="latimes dirty" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nola fight" /&gt;  Turley's antics were less well-received among team management however, particularly leading up to his March 2003 trade when Turley engaged in a public dispute with general manager [[Mickey Loomis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Duncan |first1=Jeff |title=Turley's talk may be hurting his trade value |url=http://www.nola.com/sports/t-p/index.ssf?/base/sports-1/1047797712100510.xml |work=The Times-Picayune |date=March 16, 2003 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030402020654/http://www.nola.com/sports/t-p/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fsports-1%2F1047797712100510.xml |archive-date=April 2, 2003 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Silver|first1=Michael|title=Bitter Turley comes clean on why he's no Saint|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/inside_game/michael_silver/news/2003/06/05/open_mike/|work=Sports Illustrated|date=June 5, 2003|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030713205412/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/inside_game/michael_silver/news/2003/06/05/open_mike/|archive-date=July 13, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Amongst players in the league, Turley came to be known by some as a dirty player due to his frequent use of [[cut block]]s and ambushing of unsuspecting defenders.&lt;ref name="latimes dirty"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Farmer|first1=Sam|title=He's No Saint|url=http://articles.latimes.com/print/2002/sep/05/sports/sp-turley5|accessdate=August 10, 2016|work=Los Angeles Times|date=September 5, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="si dirty" /&gt;  Turley defended his use of the cut block, noting that it is a legal maneuver and that he is simply doing his job within the rules of the game.&lt;ref name="si dirty"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Elliot|first1=Josh|title=Jekyll &amp; Hyde|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1969/12/31/8118108/jekyll--hyde-he-may-be-affable-off-the-field-but-on-it-saints-allpro-tackle-kyle-turley-hasnt-won-any-friends-with-his-style-of-play|accessdate=August 10, 2016|work=Sports Illustrated|date=July 2, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turley's football career is best remembered by many for an on-field altercation that occurred in a game against the [[New York Jets]] on November 4, 2001.  Trailing 16–9 in the final minute of the game, the Saints were driving deep into opposition territory with the ball at the 6-yard line on second-and-3.&lt;ref name="usatoday fight"&gt;{{cite news|title=Turley defends actions against Jets|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/nfl/saints/2001-11-05-turley.htm|accessdate=August 5, 2016|work=USA Today|agency=Associated Press|date=November 5, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After quarterback [[Aaron Brooks (American football)|Aaron Brooks]] was tackled on a scramble to the 5-yard line, Jets safety [[Damien Robinson]] grabbed him by the facemask and proceeded to bend his body backwards while forcefully twisting his head to the side.&lt;ref name="nola fight"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hogan|first1=Nakia|title=Ex-New Orleans Saints Kyle Turley recalls tirade for the ages|url=http://www.nola.com/saints/index.ssf/2011/11/ex-new_orleans_saints_kyle_tur.html|accessdate=August 5, 2016|work=The Times-Picayune|date=November 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Turley stepped in and separated the two, then picked up Robinson by the facemask and threw him to the ground as referees and players from both teams tried to break up the scrum.&lt;ref name="nola fight" /&gt;  Turley emerged from the pile with Robinson's helmet in hand and proceeded to fling it across the field before making an obscene gesture.&lt;ref name="usatoday fight" /&gt;  Robinson and Turley received offsetting personal fouls for the initial incident, but Turley was assessed an additional personal foul and ejected from the game for the helmet toss and obscene gesture.&lt;ref name="usatoday fight" /&gt;  The penalty set the Saints back 15 yards and they ended up losing the game after failing to score on the drive.  Saints head coach [[Jim Haslett]] said he initially considered cutting Turley before seeing a clearer view of the incident on film and discussing it with quarterback [[Aaron Brooks (American football)|Aaron Brooks]], who thought his neck had been broken at the time.&lt;ref name="usatoday fight" /&gt;  Turley was subsequently fined $25,000 by the Saints organization and requested to attend counseling for [[anger management|management of anger issues]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pasquarelli|first1=Len|title=Robinson fined $20,000 by league|url=http://a.espncdn.com/nfl/news/2001/1107/1274769.html|accessdate=August 10, 2016|work=ESPN|date=November 7, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many Saints fans applauded Turley's actions on the other hand, setting up a "Kyle Turley Defense Fund" to assist in payment of the fine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Patrick|first1=Dan|title=Outtakes with Kyle Turley|url=http://www.espn.com/talent/danpatrick/s/2002/0919/1433808.html|accessdate=August 11, 2016|work=ESPN|date=October 1, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and putting up "Turley for mayor" signs around the city.&lt;ref name="cs interview" /&gt; The incident occurred during a nationally televised game and received a significant amount of media attention afterwards, putting Turley's name in the national spotlight for the first time.&lt;ref name="nola fight" /&gt;

'''La Colle''' ([[floruit|fl]]. 1736 &amp;ndash; 1742) was a Monsoni chief who is known in [[History of Canada|Canadian history]] for this period because of the writings of [[Pierre Gaultier de Varennes, sieur de La Vérendrye|La Vérendrye]].

In the fall of 1731, construction began on [[Fort St. Pierre]] at the west end of [[Rainy Lake]] near the mouth of [[Rainy River (Minnesota-Ontario)|Rainy River]]. This was carried out by La Verendrye's nephew, [[Christopher Dufrost de La Jemeraye]] and his eldest son, [[Jean Baptiste de La Vérendrye]] over the winter of 1731-32. La Colle's main village was located in the vicinity of the fort.

La Colle was a chief with influence among the Monsonis, his own group of [[Swampy Cree]], and also with other [[Cree]]s and [[Assiniboine people|Assiniboine]] further west along the exploration route. [[Fort St. Charles]], on [[Lake of the Woods]] was built in 1732, putting the explorer in closer contact with the [[Sioux]]. The La Vérendrye's did not want war between tribes and La Colle was largely able to keep the peace. However, he led at least one war party in 1741 where many Sioux were killed and captured. Father [[Claude-Godefroy Coquart]], who was wintering at [[Fort Kaministiquia]], noted that more slaves than furs would be shipped to [[Montreal]] that season because of this event.

It would appear that La Colle played a significant role in protecting La Vérendrye during his exploration and trade westward.

[[John J. Pershing|Pershing]] was immensely popular after World War I, and as a result a large number of organizations, equipment, streets and buildings are named after him throughout the United States and abroad:

* The 4th Squadron of the [[10th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|10th US Cavalry]], part of the [[4th Infantry Division (United States)|4th Infantry Division]]'s 3rd Brigade Combat Team, is nicknamed the Blackjack Squadron
* B Troop (Black Jack Troop) 5/15 Cavalry Regiment at [[Fort Knox, Kentucky]], the home of Armor and Cavalry where brand new 19D Cavalry Scouts are trained. A parade field in front of the B Troop barracks is called "Pershing Field" in honor of the General, and a placard of his works lies in its corner.

==Military ordnance and other equipment==
* The [[M26 Pershing]] tank  was an American armored vehicle introduced in 1945.

'''Martha "Martie" Elenor Erwin''' (before '''Maguire'''; born October 12, 1969) is an American musician who is a founding member of both the female [[alternative country]] band, [[Dixie Chicks]] and country bluegrass duo, [[Court Yard Hounds]]. She won awards in national fiddle championships while still a teenager. Erwin is accomplished on several other instruments, including the mandolin, viola, double bass and guitar. She has written and co-written a number of the band's songs, some of which have become chart-topping hits. She also contributes her skills in vocal harmony and backing vocals, as well as orchestrating string arrangements for the band.

Erwin learned several instruments at a young age, honing her skills with her younger sister, [[Emily Strayer]] (born Emily Erwin) and two schoolmates (a brother and sister team, Troy and [[Sharon Gilchrist]]) for over five years as a part of a touring bluegrass quartet while in high school. After graduation, the sisters forged an alliance with two other women they had met through the Dallas music scene, [[Laura Lynch]] and [[Robin Lynn Macy]], forming a bluegrass and country music band, [[busking]] and touring the bluegrass festival circuits for six years. After the departure of Macy, and the replacement of Lynch with singer [[Natalie Maines]], the band widened their musical repertoire and appearance. The result was a trio so commercially successful that it took the country music industry by surprise, with a number of hit songs, albums, and awards that have set records in the music industry. Erwin subsequently stood by her bandmates as they were engulfed in political controversy.

==Early life==
Martha Elenor Erwin, nicknamed Martie, was born October 12, 1969, in [[York, Pennsylvania]],&lt;ref name="TV guide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/martie-maguire/256027 |title=Martie Maguire News, Martie Maguire Bio and Photos |publisher=TVGuide.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Barbara Trask and Paul Erwin. She was raised in [[Addison, Texas|Addison]], a northern suburban town on the edge of [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[Texas]]. She has an elder sister, Julia Erwin-Weiner, born in 1967, her younger sister and band member [[Emily Robison|Emily Strayer]], born in 1972 and younger half-brother, R&amp;B singer Ian Davis, born in 1996.

Encouraged by her parents &amp;ndash; educators at private schools &amp;ndash; Erwin began playing violin at age five, and by age 12, started to learn to play "[[fiddle]] style" after receiving a birthday gift of fiddle lessons.&lt;ref name="Ladies Home Journal"&gt;[http://www.lhj.com/lhj/story.jhtml?storyid=/templatedata/lhj/story/data/martiemaguirecelebprofile_01132003.xml ]{{dead link|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also was active in her school orchestra.&lt;ref name="Gilchriest"&gt;[http://www.freewebs.com/originalchicks/newsarchive.htm]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219045902/http://www.freewebs.com/originalchicks/newsarchive.htm |date=December 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her sister Emily shared her love and interest in music, and displayed early talent herself. The two sisters were provided musical instruction on several instruments, and their talent for [[vocal harmony]] continued to be nurtured. Although Erwin became famous for her harmony and mastery of the fiddle, she also plays a variety of [[String instrument|strings]] that include the [[viola]], guitar, [[mandolin]], and double bass.&lt;ref name=Leggett&gt;Leggett, Steve [http://music.msn.com/artist/?artist=16649328&amp;menu=bio All-Music Guide writer on MSN]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (Retrieved March 9, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Erwin [[Composer|compose]]s songs and [[arrangement|arrange]]s the use of [[stringed instrument]]s for concert and recording performances.

==Early career==
By 1983, Erwin was touring with her sister Emily and school friends; siblings Troy and [[Sharon Gilchrist]].&lt;ref name="JamBase"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jambase.com/Artists/Bio.aspx?ArtistID=29795 |title=Sharon Gilchrist Bio, History, Info on JamBase |publisher=Jambase.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sisters showed an "almost obsessive" interest in [[busking]] at small venues and attending bluegrass festivals.&lt;ref name="Frost"&gt;Frost, Jane [http://www.dixie-chicks.com/stories.shtml Walnut Valley Festival in Winfield, KS, Early 1980s The All-Inclusive Dixie Chicks Page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002000000/http://www.dixie-chicks.com/stories.shtml |date=October 2, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The four students formed the teenage [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] group "Blue Night Express", playing together for five years, from 1984–1989,&lt;ref name="Faraway Hills"&gt;Gilchrist, Sharon [http://homepage.ntlworld.com/farawayhills/sharon_gilchrist.html  Faraway Hills Retrieved 12 February, 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303182257/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/farawayhills/sharon_gilchrist.html |date=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while still attending private [[Greenhill School (Addison, Texas)|Greenhill School]].&lt;ref name=Leggett/&gt; "We'd drive down to the west end of Dallas and open our cases, and that was our job", Erwin said of it in a later interview to [[60 Minutes II]] [[correspondent]] [[Dan Rather]]. "That's how we made money in high school."&lt;ref name="Rather"&gt;Rather, Dan 60 Minutes

In 1987, Erwin was awarded second place for the fiddle in the National fiddle championships held yearly in [[Winfield, Kansas]]. Upon graduation from high school, with Emily still in high school, she spent a year attending college at [[Southwestern University]] in [[Georgetown, Texas]], from 1988–1989. She performed in the school orchestra there and again competed in the national fiddle championships at the [[Walnut Valley Festival]], in Winfield, earning third place that year.&lt;ref name="Walnut Valley Association"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wvfest.com/ |title=Walnut Valley Festival - Winfield, Kansas |publisher=Wvfest.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 90s she played occasionally with the [[slo-core]] band, [[Bedhead (band)|Bedhead]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ovrld.com/interviews/interview-underground-legend/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dixie Chicks==
[[File:Martie Maguire by ViVr.jpg|thumb|left| Erwin at [[Royal Albert Hall]], 2003]]
In 1989, Erwin and Strayer joined guitarist [[Robin Lynn Macy]] and [[Laura Lynch]] on double bass in the [[Dixie Chicks]], playing what was at the time predominantly [[bluegrass music]] and a mix of [[Country music|country]] standards. Originally listed as Martha, and then Martie Erwin, Erwin played [[fiddle]], [[mandolin]], [[viola]] and [[Harmony|harmonized]] with Strayer on backing vocals.&lt;ref name="Superior"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.superiorpics.com/martie_maguire/ |title=The Martie Maguire Picture Pages |publisher=Superiorpics.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erwin had begun writing and recording songs on their debut independent album, ''[[Thank Heavens for Dale Evans]]'', and in 2001, one song co-written with Laura Lynch called "Pink Toenails" resurfaced. The song was featured in the film, ''[[Don't Say A Word]]'', with [[Skye McCole Bartusiak]] performing the song.&lt;ref name="Yahoo review"&gt;(Retrieved March 22, 2008)[https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1807438736/cast#Music Yahoo Movie Review for Don't Say a Word] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522135843/http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1807438736/cast#Music |date=May 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When their second album had a more polished sound, Erwin commented, "I hope our fans won't be disappointed [in ''The Little Ol' Cowgirl'']; it's got drums on every track; it's no longer bluegrass, but we have to make a living and you can't do that playing bluegrass."&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;Clark, Renee [http://www.dixie-chicks.com/dlife392.shtml Can the Dixie Chicks make it in the big time? Local Heroes (Transcribed from) ''Dallas Life Magazine'', ''Dallas Morning News'', March 1, 1992] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304191833/http://www.dixie-chicks.com/dlife392.shtml |date=March 4, 2016 }}(Retrieved January 23, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Two albums later, after [[Natalie Maines]] assumed the position of vocalist, the band was revitalized. Erwin said of their music, "It's very rootsy, but then Natalie comes in with a rock and blues influence. That gave Emily and I{{sic}} a chance to branch out, because we loved those kinds of music but felt limited by our instruments."&lt;ref name="Malkin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chickoholic.tripod.com/DixieChicks/id8.html |title=Martie Maguire |publisher=Chickoholic.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Martie Maguire in Austin, Texas.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Martie Erwin with the Dixie Chicks in Austin, TX, 2006]]
Erwin co-wrote the song, "[[Cowboy Take Me Away]]" on the Chicks sophomore studio album ''[[Fly (Dixie Chicks album)|Fly]]'' for her sister Emily. It was a tribute to Emily's [[courtship]] with [[country music]] writer/singer [[Charlie Robison]].&lt;ref name="Ladies Home Journal" /&gt; Erwin was singled out by [[Broadcast Music, Incorporated|BMI]] in 2000, and awarded Songwriter of the Year for writing and/or co-writing "[[Cowboy Take Me Away]]", "Ready To Run" and "[[You Were Mine]]". "You Were Mine" was co-written by the sisters about their parents' divorce.&lt;ref name="Hillman"&gt;Hillman, Chris [http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,84675,00.html Entertainment Weekly]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429044300/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C84675%2C00.html |date=April 29, 2014 }} (Retrieved April 21, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the Dixie Chicks performed two songs, recording a [[Cover song|cover]] of the song, "[[You Can't Hurry Love]]" as well as Erwin's "[[Ready to Run (Dixie Chicks song)|Ready to Run]]" for the [[Julia Roberts]]/ [[Richard Gere]] film ''[[Runaway Bride (1999 film)|Runaway Bride]]''. In 2003, Erwin was nominated for a [[Tony Award]] for co-composing the [[film score]] to ''[[Urban Cowboy (musical)|Urban Cowboy]]''; the musical used her "[[Cowboy Take Me Away]]".&lt;ref name="Frontpage Publicity"&gt;[http://www.frontpagepublicity.com/dxc/content/careeroverview.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226165207/http://www.frontpagepublicity.com/dxc/content/careeroverview.html |date=February 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the band achieved massive commercial success with its first Sony studio two albums with Maines, they struggled with their record company over artistic direction on the third. Erwin commented, "I don't think any of us ever trusted Nashville. When you're in that town you know everybody is talking about everybody else. Everybody is wishing for the other guy to fail."&lt;ref name="Flippo"&gt;Martie Maguire, to ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'', 5/21/06. Flippo, Chet (May 25, 2006) [http://www.cmt.com/news/nashville-skyline/1532532/nashville-skyline-dixie-chicks-dixie-chicks-dixie-chicks.jhtml  CMT News Nashville Skyline: Dixie Chicks, Dixie Chicks, Dixie Chicks] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407062651/http://www.cmt.com/news/nashville-skyline/1532532/nashville-skyline-dixie-chicks-dixie-chicks-dixie-chicks.jhtml |date=April 7, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Erwin and Strayer often appear quiet and demure compared to their animated bandmate Natalie Maines, the trio have stood united on controversial subjects since they banded together to play in 1995, even when their opinions have had the potential to serve them more harm than good. In 2006, Erwin said, "I'd rather have a smaller following of really cool people who get it, who will grow with us as we grow and are fans for life, than people that have us in their five-disc changer with [[Reba McEntire]] and [[Toby Keith]]. We don't want those kinds of fans. They limit what you can do."&lt;ref name="Tryangiel"&gt;{{cite news | author=Tryangiel, Josh |url=http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,1196419,00.html |title=In The Line of Fire|date=May 29, 2006|publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Natalie Maines taking a break from music, Erwin was working on a solo fiddle album; however, it was announced in January 2010 that she and sister [[Emily Strayer]] have formed a side project called the [[Court Yard Hounds (band)|Court Yard Hounds]], with Strayer on lead vocals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dixiechickshenhouse.com/ |title=Dixie Chicks Henhouse |publisher=Dixiechickshenhouse.com|accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/news/newsitem.asp?xid=2485 |title=Dixie Chicks Martie Maguire records |publisher=Countrystandardtime.com |date=2007-10-23 |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band made their live debut in March at [[South by Southwest]] with an album released in May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2010/01/15/dixie-chicks-plan-album-tour-with-court-yard-hounds-side-project/ |title=Which Band Will Reunite Next?

However, her marriage did not last, and she and Ted Seidel were divorced in November 1999.&lt;ref name="Ladies Home Journal"/&gt;

At bandmate [[Natalie Maines]]' sister Kim's wedding Martie met Gareth Maguire, a [[Roman Catholic]] teacher and actor from [[Northern Ireland]]. The couple became engaged in June 2001 and married on August 10, 2001, in a civil ceremony in Hawaii; as explained at one of their concerts, the Dixie Chicks' song "[[White Trash Wedding]]" is based on Martie's relationship with Gareth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EshGQDYBKyE |title=An evening with The Dixie Chicks - White Trash Wedding |publisher=YouTube |date=2008-11-25 |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later they had a Catholic "blessing" ceremony in the groom's hometown, [[Carnlough]] in [[County Antrim]], [[Northern Ireland]], on March 9, 2002, for all the guests that were not able to attend the first wedding. Martie said of the ceremony that the [[Catholic Church]] would not permit a wedding service due to her prior divorce. Erwin said that there were many "special" people that they'd wanted to include, but that they just couldn't wait to marry.&lt;ref name="CMT Online"&gt;CMT Online [http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1449170/09252001/dixie_chicks.jhtml CMT Online  (Retrieved 25 September, 2005)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212233741/http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1449170/09252001/dixie_chicks.jhtml |date=February 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason for the rush was Gareth's need to keep flying back and forth between the United States and Ireland because of visa considerations.&lt;ref name="Minchin"&gt;Minchin III, James R. and Lieberman, Ellen InStyle Magazine; February 2003, Vol. 10 Issue 2, pg. 244 Retrieved September 25, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; After her second marriage, Martie changed her name to that of her new husband, which is why in her musical career she has had the [[surnames]] of Erwin, Seidel, and Maguire. They had three daughters together: [[fraternal twins]] Eva Ruth and Kathleen 'Katie' Emilie were born April 27, 2004. Katie was named after Gareth's late sister, Kathleen.&lt;ref&gt;Martie Maguire's twin daughters and Natalie Maines' sons [http://celebritybabies.people.com/2007/01/01/martie_maguires/ [[People (magazine)|People]] (Retrieved June 28, 2012)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011231842/http://celebritybabies.people.com/2007/01/01/martie_maguires/ |date=October 11, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Third daughter Harper Rosie Maguire was born July 25, 2008. They divorced in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://moviepilot.com/posts/3946327 On Tour Again Today, But What Do They Look Like Now?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011225726/http://moviepilot.com/posts/3946327 |date=October 11, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erwin has been frank about using [[invitro fertilization]] to conceive their daughters. In an interview in ''[[Conceive (magazine)|Conceive]]'', she said, "All my paperwork said 'unspecified origin.'  We spent three years of active trying before we went to IVF. First I went on [[Clomid]]. Then I had some dye tests and found I had a collapsed tube, so I had [[laparoscopic surgery]]; the tube wasn't blocked, just spasming." After three attempts at [[intrauterine insemination]], she said, she and her husband didn't think it was worth continuing in that manner, and switched to [[IVF]].&lt;ref name="common1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conceiveonline.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=71&amp;Itemid=22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206171500/http://www.conceiveonline.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=71&amp;Itemid=22 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 6, 2009 |title=The Dixie Chicks: Taking the Long Way ... to Motherhood |last=Weinhouse, |first=Beth |date=Fall 2007 |publisher=Conceive Magazine Online |accessdate=2008-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2007, Maguire began IVF again, resulting in their third daughter Harper.

Regarding the number of children the Dixie Chicks have produced in the past seven years, (Maines has two; Strayer has four in addition to Erwin's twins and newborn) Erwin told ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'', "We'll have to move over and let the little chicks take over! We've got a new band!"&lt;ref name="People"&gt;''People Magazine'' (accessed January 28, 2008)[http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20174066,00.html  Dixie Chick Martie Maguire Is Expecting]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914183801/http://www.people.com/people/article/0%2C%2C20174066%2C00.html |date=September 14, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erwin and Strayer co-wrote a song, "So Hard", about their own personal experiences with infertility and their need to rely on other methods to conceive. They speak out about the difficulties they faced, but also their good fortune; both having options that for many women are financially prohibitive. Mentioning the [[social stigma|stigma]] attached to IVF, Erwin said, "I think we feel a responsibility to break down some barriers. It's much more of a common problem than people realize."&lt;ref name="FrontpagePublicity"&gt;Frontpage Publicity [http://www.frontpagepublicity.com/dxc/bio.html  Dixie Chicks Website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017015925/http://www.frontpagepublicity.com/dxc/bio.html |date=October 17, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A final concern Erwin mentioned was the question of what to do with all the unused frozen [[embryos]].&lt;blockquote&gt;Now that I have children, I see those embryos as possible children. So I have to think about what my options are if there are leftovers again. I could keep them in storage, and maybe they will help my children some day. Or I can try to donate them to [[stem cell research]]. I don't think I could give them to another family. I would always worry: what if it's an abusive family? What if they don't get enough love?&lt;ref name="common1"/&gt;{{dead link|date=April 2014}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Natalie Maines has said she and Erwin learned [[Transcendental Meditation technique|Transcendental Meditation]] in the mid-1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Willman|first=Chris|title=Dixie Chicks, Russell Simmons Meditate on Rick Rubin's Greatness at David Lynch Foundation Event|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/dixie-chicks-russell-simmons-meditate-684492|accessdate=April 27, 2014|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6P9PfF1jY?url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/dixie-chicks-russell-simmons-meditate-684492|archivedate=April 27, 2014|quote=Maines is a TM-er, it turns out.

'''[[Don (honorific)|Don]] Martín García Óñez de Loyola''' (1549 in [[Azpeitia]], [[Gipuzkoa]] – December 24, 1598 at [[Disaster of Curalaba|Curalaba]]) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Basque people|Basque]] soldier and [[Royal Governor of Chile|Royal Governor]] of the [[Captaincy General of Chile]].

==Early life==
As a young man in 1568, he arrived in [[Peru]] at the side of the new [[viceroy]] [[Francisco de Toledo, Count of Oropesa]], as captain of the guard. In 1572, during the military expedition against [[Tupac Amaru]]- the last descendant of the [[Incas]] resisting foreign domination - Oñez de Loyola lead a brilliant action of an advance column which fell upon the camp of the Inca and captured him.

For this great feat, he gained the rank of ''[[corregidor (position)|corregidor]]'' in a number of Peruvian towns, entitling him to their goods and labor. He was also rewarded with a wife, a member of the royal Incan house and niece of Tupac Amaru. She was baptized with the Christian name Beatriz Clara Coya.

With these recommendations, the king named him governor of [[Paraguay]] in 1592. However, just before he assumed the position, [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] designated him [[Royal Governor of Chile]], as he was considered the officer most apt to finish the [[War of Arauco]].

==Governor of Chile==
[[File:Quiñones, Oñes de Loyola y Viscarra.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Alonso de Ovalle's 1646 engraving of [[Francisco de Quiñónez|Quiñones]], Oñez de Loyola and [[Pedro de Viscarra|Viscarra]]]]

Oñez de Loyola arrived in Chile on September 23, 1592. He was determined to pacify the Arauco. To further this end he immediately set out for [[Concepción, Chile|Concepción]] at the head of 110 troops which he had met at the capital. However, he realized that with such scarce resources he would not be able to achieve his objective and he requested reinforcements from Peru.

However, the appearance of the [[British people|British]] pirate [[Richard Hawkins]] alarmed the authorities in Peru and their reinforcements were recalled for the defense of Peru itself. Hawkins also attacked Chile during his campaigns, assaulting [[Valparaiso]], for example where he captured a ship. Because of the limited capacity of his ship, he only took things he needed and let the captured sailors go free.

The governor did not receive the requested soldiers, but members of the [[Jesuit]] and [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] orders did arrive. The first would have great importance for later events in the colonization of Chile, until they were eventually expelled.

The governor decided that he could not wait any longer and in 1594 he began a campaign to the south with the small contingent that he had assembled. He founded a fort at [[Santa Cruz de Oñez]] in May 1594, near the confluence of the Bio-Bio and Laja Rivers in [[Catiray]], where gold mines were located on the [[Rele River]].  The fort was elevated to the rank of city in 1595 giving it the name of [[Santa Cruz de Coya]].

Three years later a group of 140 reinforcements arrived, but they were not enough. The lack of reinforcements was not the fault of the viceroy — who offered generous inducements to join the army — but rather the name of Chile, which had become so stained by the interminable conflict that no one wanted to risk their lives going to such a hell.

==Death==
{{main|Battle of Curalaba}}
The governor was in [[La Imperial, Chile|La Imperial]] when news arrived that the [[Mapuche]]s had renewed their attacks against [[Angol]]. In order to reinforce this point, he set out with 50 men on December 21, 1598. On the second day of the march they arrived at a place called ''Curallaba'' or ''Curalava'' (the broken rock), on the banks of the [[Lumaco River]], where they rested without taking any precautions against attack. On the nights of the 23rd and 24th the natives approached the camp, and with shouts and the sounds of horns they attacked the Spanish.

Oñez de Loyola and a pair of soldiers at his side fought very valiantly, but finally succumbed to the spears of the natives. In the melee almost all the Spaniards died, save a cleric named Bartolomé Pérez, who was taken prisoner, and a soldier named Bernardo de Pereda, who received 23 wounds on his body and was left for dead but improbably survived.

The Mapuches then initiated a general uprising which destroyed all the cities in their homeland south of the [[Biobío River]]. They kept the head of Oñez de Loyola, giving it back years later to the governor [[Alonso García de Ramón]].

'''Movsar Buharovich Barayev''' ({{lang-ru|Мовсар Бухарович Бараев}}; October 26, 1979&amp;nbsp;– October 26, 2002), earlier known as '''Suleimanov''', was a [[Chechen people|Chechen]] Islamist [[militia]] leader during the [[Second Chechen War]], who led [[Moscow theater hostage crisis|the seizure of a Moscow theater]] that led to the deaths of over 170 people.

==Life==
Movsar Barayev, born 1979, was the nephew of the notorious Chechen [[warlord]] [[Arbi Barayev]] who allegedly worked under [[FSB (Russia)|FSB]] guidance.&lt;ref name="Littell"&gt;[http://www.psan.occrg/document551.html The Security Organs of the Russian Federation. A Brief History 1991-2004]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} by [[Jonathan Littell]], Psan Publishing House 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; After his uncle's death in June 2001 until his own, Movsar was the leader of a Chechen terrorist militia known as the [[Special Purpose Islamic Regiment|Special Purpose Islamic Brigade]] (SPIR).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tol.cz/look/TOL/article.tpl?IdLanguage=1&amp;IdPublication=10&amp;NrIssue=498&amp;NrSection=1&amp;NrArticle=7567&amp;ALStart=272 Reputed Warlord Barayev Killed] [[Transitions online]], 15 October 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Barayev junior was said to be a sworn enemy of the Chechen leader and elected [[president]], [[Aslan Maskhadov]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/chechnya/Story/0,2763,819079,00.html "Young, ruthless leader heads new generation of guerrillas"] ''[[The Guardian]]'', October 25, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; He used the ''[[nom-de-guerre]]'' of '''"Yassir"'''.

He was incorrectly reported by the command of the [[Russia]]n forces in Chechnya to have been killed on August 21, 2001, and again on October 12, 2002, eleven days prior to the Moscow theater crisis (this report of Barayev's death came from Colonel Boris Podoprigora, deputy commander of Russia's Joint Group Forces).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazeta.ru/2002/10/24/WhoisMovsarB.shtml Who is Movsar Barayev?] ''[[Gazeta.ru|Gazeta]]'', 24 October 2002&lt;/ref&gt; It was also claimed that two months before the hostage-taking, the Russian [[GRU]] [[military intelligence]] had arrested Barayev and contained him ''"until his release had provided leads to the hostage taking at the [[Dubrovka Theater|Dubrovka]] theatre"''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crimesofwar.org/chechnya-mag/chech-nivat.html Crimes of War &gt; Chechnya Magazine: Brutality and Indifference] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070617092623/http://www.crimesofwar.org/chechnya-mag/chech-nivat.html |date=2007-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On October 23, 2002, Barayev and a mysterious man known as "Abu Bakar" led a group of some forty SPIR militants and their family members (who had dubbed themselves "the suicide squad from the 29th Division") to seize the theater in the Russian capital Moscow, demanding [[negotiations]] with Russian authorities for an end to [[Second Chechen War|the second war in Chechnya]], withdrawal of Russian forces and Chechen [[independence]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccc.nps.navy.mil/si/may03/russia.asp The Moscow Hostage Crisis: An Analysis of Chechen Terrorist Goals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060809173640/http://www.ccc.nps.navy.mil/si/may03/russia.asp |date=2006-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; threatening to execute his hostages.

Movsar Barayev was killed on the third day of the crisis, when the Russian FSB special forces stormed the theater. He died on his 23rd birthday. Barayev's bloodied corpse was shown by the Russian TV lying on the ground of the theater amid broken glass with an intact bottle of [[Cognac (drink)|cognac]] near his hand. Later, the Russian authorities said his body was secretly buried in an undisclosed location.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8591">{{Culture of South Ossetia}}
The [[mythology]] of the [[Ossetians|Ossetian people]] of the [[Caucasus]] region contains several gods and supernatural beings. The religion itself is believed to be of [[Sarmatian]] origin, but contains many later elements from [[Christianity]], and the Ossetian gods are often identified with Christian saints. The gods play a role in the famous stories about a race of semi-divine heroes called the [[Narts]].

== Deities ==
*'''Huycau''' or '''[[Xucau]]''' ({{lang-os|Хуыцау}}). The chief of the gods.
*'''[[Uastyrdzhi]]''' (Уастырджи; "[[Saint George]]"). The patron of males and travellers, and the guarantor of oaths. Main patron of [[North Ossetia–Alania]].
*'''Uacilla''' (Уацилла; "[[Elijah|Saint Elijah]]"). Also spelled ''Watsilla''. God of rain, thunder and lightning. As protector of the harvest he is known as ''Хоры Уацилла'' (''Hory Uacilla'', "Uacilla of the wheat"). Anyone struck by lightning was considered chosen by the god and, if they survived, a sheep was sacrificed in their honour. His festival was celebrated in the summer with the sacrifice of a lamb and a bull and the drinking of specially brewed beer. On that day women baked bread in silence as a mark of reverence.{{sfn|Arys-Djanaïéva|2004|p=163}}

*'''Safa''' (''Сафа''). God of the hearth chain. The most important domestic deity for Ossetians.
*'''[[Donbettyr]]''' ({{lang-os|Донбеттыр}}). Lord of the waters. His name is a fusion of the Ossetian ''don'' (meaning water) and [[Saint Peter]]. He uses his chain to drag down those who unwarily go swimming too late to his realm at the bottom of the sea. He has many beautiful daughters, comparable to the [[Rusalka|Rusalki]] of [[Slavic mythology]]. Up to the 19th century, his day was celebrated on the Saturday following [[Easter]] by young girls.
*'''[[Dzerassae]]''' ({{lang-os|Дзерассæ}}), one of Donbettyr's daughters, the mother of many Nart heroes.
*'''Tutyr''' (Тутыр). Lord of the wolves. Identified with [[Theodore of Amasea|Saint Theodore of Tyre]].
*'''Fælværa''' (Фæлвæра). The name is possibly a conflation of Saints [[Florus and Laurus]]. Fælværa was the protector of sheep and his festival was celebrated before sheep-shearing in September.{{sfn|Arys-Djanaïéva|2004|p=163}} He only has one eye. He is often the enemy of Tutyr.
*'''[[Apsat (mythology)|Æfsati]]''' (Æфсати). A male hunting god.&lt;ref name="goddess"&gt;{{citation|url=|title=The Concept of the Goddess |editor-last=Billington |editor-first=Sandra |editor-last2=Green |editor-first2=Miranda |publisher=Routledge|year=1996|isbn=9781134641529 |location= |chapter=The Causcasian hunting-divinity, male and female: traces of the hunting-goddess in Ossetic folklore | first = Anna | last = Chaudhri|pages=167–168 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Kurdalægon]]''' (Курдалæгон). The heavenly [[Smith (metalwork)|smith]]. A close friend of the Narts.
*'''[[Satanaya|Satana]]''' (Сатана). Mother goddess, mother of the Narts.
*'''Saubarag''' (Саубараг or Сау бараджи дзуар, "black rider"), the god of darkness and thieves.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url = http://myths.kulichki.ru/enc/item/f00/s30/a003039.shtml | title =Сау бараджи дзуар | trans-title = | language = russian }}&lt;/ref&gt; Identified with [[Satan]].{{fact|date=August 2018}}
*'''Huyændon Ældar''' (Хуыæндон Æлдар &lt;!--Not sure this spelling is correct --&gt;). Lord of the fish. A great magician and a spirit who behaves like an earthly chief ("ældar"). His name means "Lord of the Strait" (according to Abaev, this is most probably the Cimmerian Bosphorus, the modern [[Strait of Kerch]]).
*'''Barastyr''' (Барастыр, also transliterated ''Barastaer'' or ''Barastir'') Ossetian [[psychopomp]]. The ruler of the [[underworld]] who assigns arriving dead souls to either [[paradise]] or his own realm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Lurker|first=Manfred|title=The Routledge Dictionary of Gods and Goddesses, Devils and Demons|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=1987|pages=30|isbn=0-415-34018-7|url=https://archive.org/stream/TheRoutledgeDictionaryOfGodsAnd/The%20Routledge%20Dictionary%20of%20Gods%20and#page/n37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Aminon''' (Аминон). Gatekeeper of the underworld.
*'''Alardy''' (Аларды). Lord of [[smallpox]], who had to be placated.{{sfn|Arys-Djanaïéva|2004|p=165}}
 
The ''uac-'' prefix in Uastyrdzhi and Uacilla has no synchronic meaning in Ossetic, and is usually understood to mean "saint" (also applied to Tutyr, ''Uac Tutyr'', perhaps [[Theodore of Amasea|Saint Theodore]], and to [[Saint Nicholas]], ''Uac Nikkola''). The synchronic term for "saint", however, is ''syhdaeg'' (cognate to Avestan [[Yazata]]).  Gershevitch (1955) connects ''uac'' with a word for "word" (Sanskrit ''[[vāc]]'', c.f. Latin ''vox''), in the sense of [[Logos]].

'''Kurys'''  (Digor ''Burku'') is a dream land, a meadow belonging to the dead, which can be visited by some people in their sleep. Visitors may bring back miraculous seeds of luck and good fortune, sometimes pursued by the dead. Inexperienced souls may bring back fever and sickness instead. Gershevitch (with [[Vasily Abaev|V.I. Abaev]]) compares the name ''Kurys'' to the mountain ''Kaoiris'' in [[Yasht]] 19.6 (Avestan ''*Karwisa''), which might indicate that the name is a spurious remnant of origin legends of [[Airyanem Vaejah]] of  the [[Alans]].

==Folklore==
Ossetian folkore also includes several mythological figures including those in the [[Nart sagas]] including [[Batraz]], a warrior hero.

In a [[cabinet shuffle]] in 2001 he became [[Department of Tourism and Parks (New Brunswick)|Minister of Tourism &amp; Parks]] a post he maintained until after the 2003 election when he took over the post of transportation.

He left the cabinet in 2006 as the [[New Brunswick Liberal Association|Liberals]] won that year's election and formed the government.

== Background ==

=== Origins of the Armenian people ===
{{Main|Prehistoric Armenia|Ancient Armenia|Medieval Armenia}}
Armenians are an ethnic group who originate from the [[Eponym|eponymous]] [[Armenian Highlands]], located in [[Western Asia]], between [[Anatolia]], the [[Caucasus]], the [[Iranian Plateau]], and the [[Fertile Crescent]]. Most of the region is currently divided between [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Iran]], and [[Turkey]].

The [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenian kingdoms]] that followed enjoyed sovereignty over the Armenian Highlands, but also often fell to the rule of foreign empires. However, when under foreign rule, Armenia often remained a self-ruling geopolitical entity,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/42477084|title=The heritage of Armenian literature|last=|first=|date=©2000-2005|publisher=Wayne State University Press|others=Hacikyan, A.

This allowed a distinguishable Armenian culture to develop and flourish, leading to the creation of [[Armenian alphabet|its own unique alphabet]] and [[Armenian Apostolic Church|its own branch of Christianity]].

=== Foreign rule ===
{{Main|Iranian Armenia (1502–1828)|Armenians in the Ottoman Empire}}
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}

It was in the 11th century, with the arrival of the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk Turks]], followed by waves of Turko-Mongol invasions around the time of the [[Mongol Empire]], when Armenian self-rule in Armenia began to dramatically decline. By the time of the [[Timurid Empire]] in the 14th century, only pockets of Armenian autonomy remained, such as in [[Principality of Khachen|Artsakh]].

After centuries of instability, the political landscape in the Armenian Highlands finally settled, divided between the [[Ottoman Empire]] ruling the [[Western Armenia|western portion]], and [[Iran]] ruling the [[Iranian Armenia (1502–1828)|eastern portion]]. The two empires' rivalry was often settled with [[Ottoman–Persian wars|battles]] in the heart of the [[Armenian Highlands]].

=== Displacements ===
[[File:Ethnic map of Asia Minor and Caucasus in 1914.jpg|thumb|440x440px|[[Ethnography|Ethnographic]] map of the region in 1914.{{Legend|#8cc3c1|Armenians}}]]{{See also|New Julfa|Anti-Armenian sentiment}}
Apart from the gradual emigration of Armenians due to persecution under Muslim rule, the first major [[forced displacement]] of Armenians from the Armenian Highlands in the [[Modern history|modern era]] was at the turn of 17th century, when the Iranian king [[Abbas II of Persia|Abbas II]] moved Armenians from [[Iranian Armenia (1502–1828)|Iranian Armenia]] to the inner regions of his [[History of Iran#Safavid Empire (1501–1736)|empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Armenians: From Kings and Priests to Merchants and Commissars|last=Panossian|first=Razmik|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2006|isbn=9780231139267|location=New York|page=122|authorlink=Razmik Panossian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the beginning of the 20th century, Armenians continued to form the ethnic majority (but not religious majority) in most of Ottoman Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Toynbee's re-calculated population values of the Ottoman Empire in 1912. See here: [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Arnold_J._Toynbee_Armenian_statistics_1912.png]. As explained in the footprint: The analysis excluded certain portions of a province where "Armenians are minor". In the "vilayet of Van", (vilayet is a province in the Ottoman Empire) there were two portions (portions in modern use correspondes to county). Arnold Toynbee to find the ratio of Armenians in "Van," removed the values originating from portions of Van (listed in the foot print) where Armenians were in minority in this province. The presented table shows the re-calculated values of the stated provinces using values where Armenians are not in minority. This graphic was first prepared in 1913 by the Armenian politician Marcel Leart (Krikor Zohrab).&lt;/ref&gt; The demographics of the region changed considerably due to the Ottoman Empire's policy of settling [[Turkish people|Turkish]] refugees from the [[Balkans]] during the [[Balkan Wars|Balkan wars]] into the region,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://journals.openedition.org/ejts/4396#ftn5|title=Forced Population Movements in the Ottoman Empire and the Early Turkish Republic: An Attempt at Reassessment through Demographic Engineering|last=Şeker|first=Nesim|date=2016|website=OpenEdition|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180422141504/https://journals.openedition.org/ejts/4396|archive-date=2018-04-22|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-28|quote=The resettlement of Muslim-Turkish refugees was not an end in itself but part of a broader project of ‘nationalizing’ or ‘Turcifying’ the Ottoman lands. This project had two main aspects : forcing ‘disloyal’ elements to migrate and resettling supposed ‘loyal’ refugees into evacuated places. It was with these goals that the Unionist leadership inaugurated a campaign against the Ottoman Greeks to disrupt their economic activities and to uproot them through coercive measures on the eve of the First World War (Dündar 2008 : 191-248). The implementation of this policy against the Armenian population during the War demonstrates all aspects of the Unionist demographic mentality. Legitimized by security concerns, measures ranging from murder and massacre to religious conversion, assimilation and seizure of property were undertaken simultaneously, illustrating political, demographic and economic aspects of demographic engineering. A similar mentality was at work in the resettlement of the Muslim refugees. The Unionists made solid preparations to organize their resettlement in such a way that they would efficiently assimilate into the Turkish population. For example, they enacted the Law for the Settlement of Immigrants, which led to the formation of the General Directorate for Settlement of Tribes and Refugees. The resettlement of Albanian and Bosnian refugees who were expelled from the Balkans and of the Kurds fleeing before the Russian troops demonstrates that the Unionist government did not want to see any non-Turkish group forming a majority in a particular region and constituting more than 5-10 % of the population. The Directorate was also in charge of linguistic and ethnological research on ethnic and religious minorities in Anatolia such as Kizilbashes, Bektâshis, Ahîs, Armenians, Alevis, Kurds and Turcomans, unequivocally for political goals. It is estimated that approximately half of the Anatolian population, approximately 8 million souls, had to move during the First World War due to the Committee of Union and Progress’s deportation and resettlement policy (Dündar 2006 : 37-42).}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the emigration of [[Armenians in the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Armenians]] to [[Russian Armenia]], the latter of which had been ongoing since the mid-19th century,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/57482057|title=The Armenians : past and present in the making of national identity|last=|first=|date=2005|publisher=RoutledgeCurzon|others=Herzig, Edmund, 1958-, Kurkchiyan, Marina, 1954-|year=|isbn=0203004930|location=New York|pages=66|oclc=57482057|quote=During each of the wars involving Russia, Armenians suffered as a result of pillaging and attacks by irregulars opposing the new northern power. Christian Armenians were often accused of sympathy for the Christian Russians, and, though in fact many preferred Ottoman or Persian rule, a massive wave of Armenians abandoned their homes and fled to Russian-controlled territory. As many as 45,000 from Persia and 100,000 from the Ottoman Empire left for Russian-controlled territory after the end of the 1826–8 Russo-Persian and 1828–9 Russo-Ottoman wars.}}&lt;/ref&gt; when [[Iranian Armenia (1502–1828)|Iranian Armenia]] had been annexed by the [[Russian Empire]].

After the [[Armenian Genocide]] during [[World War I]], the Armenian population of Ottoman Armenia ceased to exist, being reduced to negligible numbers. Many who remained [[Hidden Armenians|hid their identities]] or were assimilated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1037014324|title=Secret nation : the hidden Armenians of Turkey|last=Avedis,|first=Hadjian,|isbn=9781786733719|location=London|oclc=1037014324}}&lt;/ref&gt; The survivors who did not remain formed the [[Armenian diaspora|Armenian Diaspora]], a community of Armenians who have spread around the world.

=== Contemporary situation ===
The attachment of the Armenian people to their homeland was preserved within the Diaspora, through the establishment of Armenian communities and Armenian schools where their history was taught. [[Repatriation]] to [[Armenia]] became one of the goals of the Diaspora,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mindiaspora.am/en/Department_of_Repatriation_and_Investigations|title=RA Ministry of Diaspora - Department of Repatriation and Investigation|website=www.mindiaspora.am|access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|incorporation of Armenia]] within the [[Soviet Union]] in 1920, the political and economic instability following Armenia's independence in 1991, its [[Nagorno-Karabakh conflict|ongoing territorial conflict]] with neighboring [[Azerbaijan]] since 1988, and its location between two hostile countries ([[Turkey]] and [[Azerbaijan]]), have all been reasons for the disinclination of generations of Armenians in the Diaspora to leave the comfort of the countries they live in for Armenia, leading to assimilation and loss of interest in their ethnic origins among the younger generations (a circumstance sometimes called ''[[White Genocide]]'' among Armenians).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/934504087|title=The Armenian Genocide legacy|last=|first=|publisher=|others=Demirdjian, Alexis, 1976-, Suny, Ronald Grigor,|year=|isbn=9781137561633|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire|pages=266|oclc=934504087|quote=[...] the Diaspora communities where younger Armenians come into contact with non-Armenians.

== Russian Armenia (1828–1917) ==
[[File:ArmenianOblast.jpg|thumb|Armenian Oblast, 1828–1840.]]{{See also|Russian Armenia}}

=== Background ===
{{Main|Ottoman–Safavid War (1578–90)|Ottoman–Safavid War (1603–18)}}
In the 16th century, the [[Ottoman Empire]] had conquered [[Transcaucasia]] from [[Safavid dynasty|Iran]], which reconquered it in the early 17th century. The local Armenians, who had been laid destitute by heavy Ottoman taxation, and the [[Shia Islam|Shi'ite Muslims]] who had been persecuted for their beliefs, welcomed Iran as liberators. In 1603, news of an Ottoman counteroffensive reached the king of [[Safavid dynasty|Iran]], [[Abbas II of Persia|Abbas II]], who ordered the displacement of the population of Armenians from the province of [[Erivan Province (Safavid Empire)|Erivan]] (roughly modern-day [[Yerevan]] and [[Administrative divisions of Armenia|its surrounding provinces]], [[Iğdır Province|Igdir]], [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]], and [[Maku County|Maku]]), particularly from the town of [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (city)|Julfa]], and also from the province [[Eyalet of Van|Van]], as part of a [[scorched earth]] strategy. It is estimated that the number of Armenians who were displaced by 1605 was as high as 300,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/42477084|title=The heritage of Armenian literature|last=|first=|date=©2000-2005|publisher=Wayne State University Press|others=Hacikyan, A. J. (Agop Jack), 1931-, Basmajian, Gabriel., Franchuk, Edward S., Ouzounian, Nourhan.|year=|isbn=0814328156|location=Detroit|pages=5|oclc=42477084|quote=When Shah Abbas the Great (1587–1629) acceded to the throne, he tried to recapture lost territory. He forced the Ottomans out of Transcaucasia and regained a number of cities; he had similar successes in the province of Nakhijevan, including Julfa. The local Armenians, who had been laid destitute by heavy Ottoman taxes, and the Shi'ite Moslems who had been persecuted for their beliefs, welcomed the Persians as liberators. For the Armenians, however, a greater tragedy awaited. In 1603, at the news of an Ottoman counteroffensive, Abbas ordered the entire Armenian population of Bayazit, Van, Nakhijevan to be displaced, as part of a scorched earth policy. The number of Armenians removed from this area between 1604 and 1605 is estimated at close to 300,000.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following centuries, several nomadic Turkic and Kurdish tribes settled in the area and established [[Khanates of the Caucasus|khanates]].

In the 19th century, Russia acquired all of [[Transcaucasia]], including most of [[Eastern Armenia]], as a result of wars with [[Qajar dynasty|Iran]] ([[Russo-Persian War (1804–13)|1804–1813]] and [[Russo-Persian War (1826–1828)|1826–1828]]) and with the [[Ottoman Empire]] ([[Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829)|1828–1829]] and [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|1877–1878]]).

=== Armenian Oblast (1828–1840) ===
{{See also|Armenian Oblast}}
After the [[Russian Empire]] annexed [[Transcaucasia]] from [[Qajar dynasty|Iran]], they established the [[Armenian Oblast]] out of the [[Erivan Khanate]]. In 1826, the population of the khanate was 110,120, of which 20,073 (~18.22%) was [[Armenians|Armenian]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Erivan Khanate#CITEREFBournoutian1980|Bournoutian 1980]], p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Erivan Khanate#CITEREFBournoutian1992|Bournoutian 1992]], p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian Empire, along with the existing Armenian community in Transcaucasia, promoted the repatriation of Armenians from the Ottoman Empire into the new oblast. As many as 45,000 from Iran and 100,000 from the Ottoman Empire left for the Russian-controlled territory. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Armenian refugees from the Ottoman Empire ===
{{See also|Kars Oblast|Erivan Governorate|Elisabethpol Governorate}}
The [[Russo-Persian Wars|Russo-Iranian]] and [[History of the Russo-Turkish wars|Russo-Ottoman]] wars caused a sentiment of distrust for Christians within the Muslim empires, particularly in the [[Ottoman Empire]], which was amplified by their ongoing losses to the Christians in the [[Balkans]] during the [[Decline and modernization of the Ottoman Empire|decline of the empire]]. Armenians were often accused of betrayal, leading irregulars opposing the [[Russian Empire]] to [[Looting|pillage]] and attack Armenians, and massacres such as the [[Hamidian massacres|Hamidian Massacres]]. 

Although a number of Armenians preferred Ottoman or Iranian rule, Armenians from within Russia did instigate revolts and feelings of [[Armenian national awakening|national awakening]] among Ottoman Armenians. Many moved to Transcaucasia to join the revolutionary organizations that aimed to restore Armenian independence for Ottoman Armenia. This ultimately became one of the factors that led the [[Young Turks|Ottoman leadership]] to commit genocide and eliminate all Armenian presence from Ottoman Armenia. The influx of Armenian refugees into Transcaucasia was accelerated drastically as the [[Armenian Genocide]] was being carried out starting from 1915. 

== First Republic of Armenia (1918–1920) ==
{{See also|First Republic of Armenia}}
After the [[October Revolution|fall of the Russian Empire]] in 1917, the Armenian population of [[Transcaucasia]] declared the independence of the [[First Republic of Armenia|first Armenian Republic]] in 1918. The short-lived republic dealt with war from all side throughout the entirety of its existence. As the Ottoman Empire fell, the partition of the Ottoman Empire was being discussed at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] of 1919. The conference agreed that the Ottoman Empire had to surrender all of its territorial claims in Transcaucasia, but the parts of Ottoman Armenia to be awarded to the Armenian Republic was less clear, since its Armenian population had been extinguished during the Armenian Genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.conflicts.rem33.com/images/Armenia/restoration%20and%20terr%20issue/T3.html|title=armenicum|last=|first=|date=|website=www.conflicts.rem33.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-29|quote=They agreed that Turkey had to surrender all of her territorial claims to the Caucasus but were not sure what part of Turkish Armenia could be awarded to the Armenian Republic providing the absence of the Armenian population there following the massacres of 1915 and 1918.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Armenians faced Muslim uprisings in the region (i.e., the [[Provisional National Government of the Southwestern Caucasus|Kars Republic]]). Finally, in the [[Treaty of Sèvres]], a large part of Ottoman Armenia was awarded to the Armenian Republic, today referred to as [[Wilsonian Armenia|''Wilsonian Armenia'']], which the Ottoman government signed, but was never ratified.

While some Armenians attempted to repatriate [[Western Armenia]], the Republic of Armenia was unable to put the legally acquired lands under its control due to its conflicts with neighbouring Georgia and Azerbaijan. Additionally, the new [[Turkish National Movement|Turkish nationalist government]] formed in [[Ankara]] by [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Kemal Atatürk]] rejected the Treaty of Sèvres, and by the end of the summer of 1920, Turkish nationalists occupied the territories awarded to Armenia, and the Muslim population of the territories were ready to take up arms against enforcing the provisions of the Treaty of Sèvres, as they believed Ottoman Armenia to be their land.

Ultimately, as the Republic of Armenia was incorporated into the [[Soviet Union]], Western Armenia was incorporated into [[Turkey]] by the signing of the [[Treaty of Lausanne]], which confounded the hope of the Armenian refugees who aspired to repatriation, but the treaty also changed the status of Armenian survivors who had found refuge in former-Ottoman territories such as Syria and Lebanon. Among the provisions of the Treaty of Lausanne was the requirement that refugees from Anatolia now living in former Ottoman territories be entitled to citizenship. For the authorities of the [[French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon]], this clause was providential. In 1924, Lebanese Armenians were naturalized en masse, and Armenians have never been able to repatriate it since.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ejournals.bc.edu/ojs/index.php/levantine/article/view/5363/4822|title=LEBANESE ARMENIANS; A DISTINCTIVE COMMUNITY IN THE ARMENIAN DIASPORA AND IN LEBANESE SOCIETY|last=Abramson|first=Scott|date=2013|website=The Levantine Review|page=193|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|quote=The Treaty of Lausanne not only confounded the hope of the Armenian refugees who aspired to repatriation, it changed their status in their host countries too. Among its provisions was the requirement that refugees from Anatolia now living in former Ottoman territories be entitled to citizenship. For the French mandatory authorities in Lebanon and their Maronite protégés, for whom augmenting Lebanon’s Christian sector was a major desideratum, this clause was providential. So in 1924, in the teeth of opposition from Lebanon’s Sunni Muslims, Lebanese Armenians were naturalized en masse.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic}}
Following the [[Armenian Genocide]], a vast number of Armenians had fled to countries near the Ottoman Empire, such as [[Syria]], [[Egypt]] and [[Lebanon]], and formed large Armenian communities. With the ceding of the Syrian territory of [[Hatay Province|Alexandretta]] by [[France]] to Turkey in 1939, a second wave of migrations of Armenians to [[Levant|the Levant]] took place.

In the 1940s, the [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic]] organized an international repatriation campaign. A sizeable number of Armenians from the [[Armenian diaspora|Diaspora]] repatriated the years following [[World War II]].

=== Soviet territorial claims against Turkey ===
{{Main|Soviet territorial claims against Turkey}}
From 1945 to 1953, the [[Soviet Union]] considered several different proposals for expanding their borders into [[Eastern Anatolia Region|Eastern Turkey]]. Part of these proposals included the acquisition of historical [[Western Armenia|Western Armenian]] territories and the repatriation of [[Armenian diaspora|Armenians from the Armenian diaspora]]. The territorial claims were renounced after [[Joseph Stalin]] passed away.

=== Egypt ===
{{See also|Armenians in Egypt}}
Armenians who settled in Egypt lived in prosperity. Following [[World War II]], only a few thousand persons answered the call for repatriation to [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Armenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/bitstream/1885/9257/4/04Chapter3_Kirkland.pdf|title=ARMENIAN MIGRATION, SETTLEMENT ANDADJUSTMENT IN AUSTRALIA WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE · TO THE ARMENIANS IN SYDNEY|last=Kirkland|first=James Ray|date=March 1980|website=Australian National University {{!}} Open Research Library|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-29|quote=The general prosperity of the Egyptian Armenian community continued throughout the World War II period and, following the War, resulted in only a few thousand persons answering the call for repatriation to Soviet Armenia.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lebanon ===
{{See also|Armenians in Lebanon}}
Between 1946 and 1949, [[President of Lebanon|Lebanese President]] [[Bechara El Khoury]]’s administration provided assistance to [[Armenians in Lebanon|Lebanese]] and [[Armenians in Syria|Syrian Armenians]] who wished to repatriate to [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Armenia]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ejournals.bc.edu/ojs/index.php/levantine/article/view/5363/4822|title=LEBANESE ARMENIANS; A DISTINCTIVE COMMUNITY IN THE ARMENIAN DIASPORA AND IN LEBANESE SOCIETY|last=Abramson|first=Scott|date=2013|website=The Levantine Review|pages=212-213|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-29|quote=[...] Bishara al- Khoury’s administration between 1946 and 1949 provided assistance to Lebanese and Syrian Armenians who wished to immigrate to Armenia during Soviet Armenia’s international repatriation campaign of those years.

== Republic of Armenia (1991–present) ==
{{See also|Armenia|Republic of Artsakh}}
One of the main challenges of the Republic of Armenia is preserving its population numbers. Despite the recent rise in repatriation, the number of Armenians leaving Armenia is consistently higher.

=== Acquisition of Armenian citizenship ===
{{Main|Armenian nationality law}}
The Republic of Armenia has made an effort to simplify the acquirement an [[Armenian nationality law|Armenian citizenship]] for ethnic Armenians living abroad, by including the [[right of return]] for members of the [[Armenian diaspora]], and since 2007 permitting dual citizenship. Diaspora Armenians who want to live and work in Armenia, but want to be exempt from military service can also apply for a special residency status, which gives them a special passport and the same rights as citizens except the right to vote or access to the same countries that an Armenia passport would. Survivors of the Armenian Genocide are granted Special Passports through a facilitated procedure, and the application fee is waived. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mfa.am/en/residency/|title=Special residency status - Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Armenia|last=LLC|first=Helix Consulting|date=|website=www.mfa.am|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-31|quote=Those granted Special Residency Status will be issued Special Armenian Passports and will no longer be required to obtain entry visas for traveling to Armenia.

They will be exempt from military service in the Armenian National Army. Please note, that Special Passport will not waive visa requirements for other CIS countries. For travel to those and other countries the bearer of Special Passport should use his/her national passport. The survivors of the Armenian Genocide are granted Special Passports through a facilitated procedure, and the application fee is waived.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Syrian Civil War (2011–present) ===
{{See also|Armenians in Syria|Syrian Civil War}}
Since the start of the Syrian Civil War, 16,623 Armenian Syrians found refuge in [[Armenia]], of which 13,000 remained and repatriated (as of July 2015). The government of Armenia is offering several protection options including simplified naturalization by [[Armenians in the Middle East|Armenian descent]] (15,000 persons acquired [[Armenian nationality law|Armenian citizenship]]), accelerated asylum procedures and facilitated short, mid and long-term residence permits.

According to [[Hranush Hakobyan]] only 15,000 Armenians are left in Syria and the rest have been settled in Armenia or [[Republic of Artsakh|Artsakh]], with another 8,000 having left for [[Lebanon]], and others going to destinations including [[Europe]], the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. However, Armenian foundations in Syria estimate around 35,000 are left based on rough estimates.

[[Azerbaijan]] has raised concerns over settlement of Syrian Armenians in the disputed territory of the [[Republic of Artsakh]].

=== 2018 Velvet Revolution ===
[[File:Demonstration, Republic Sq. Yerevan, Apr 20, 2018.jpg|thumb|Demonstration in [[Republic Square, Yerevan]], 20 April 2018.]]{{See also|2018 Armenian Velvet Revolution}}
The corruption of the government of the Republic of Armenia has been criticized for having been one of the primary reasons as to why Diaspora Armenians have been detached from the Republic of Armenia. However, the success of the 2018 [[2018 Armenian Velvet Revolution|Velvet Revolution]], aiming to end the corruption, is being seen as a turning point in the history of Armenia, with hopes that these negative opinions of Armenia will change and produce a new wave of repatriates. Awareness for these changes was boosted by several famous Armenians in the Diaspora, such as [[Serj Tankian]] from the [[System of a Down]] band.

On 20 May 2018, the [[president of Armenia]], [[Armen Sarkissian]], addressed the younger generation of Armenians worldwide during the ''Armenia Tomorrow: Citizen Diplomacy at Work'' conference organized by the [[University of Southern California]] Institute of Armenian Studies, in the wake of the [[2018 Armenian Velvet Revolution|Velvet Revolution]]: &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=CivilNet|title=Time to Recognize Armenia as Homeland for All Armenians: Armen Sarkissian|date=2018-05-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvLassGnlfE|accessdate=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=The opportunities of [the Velvet Revolution] creates huge expectations worldwide amongst Armenians, especially among the younger generation, because that, first of all, makes Armenians, especially the younger ones, to feel again that they are the owners of this country [Armenia], they are the owners of the values, they are the owners of the heritage, they are the owners of the future of this country [Armenia]. [...] That feeling of being a citizen, i.e., being the responsible for the future is there. [...]

The opportunities are huge because we are first of all to use the fact that I call that we are a small state but a global nation; there are four or five times, probably more, Armenians living abroad than in Armenia today. A lot of them are very good citizens of the countries that they are living today; some of them are highly recognized by international community as professional successful businessmen, scientists, politicians, etc., and most of them are highly respectful, honest people. So it's the time that everybody recognizes that Armenia, their homeland, is really their homeland, and they belong to this state and they belong to this great nation, and to use this opportunity to rebuilding our country, our state, for the next generation to make sure that, tomorrow, Armenia will be better than today. [...]

That's opportunity [...] to really open the door for every Armenian that believes that he has something to offer to his homeland, to have this opportunity of investing time, energy, professionals, [...] into this country.

[...] our future successes will be connected with one fact: do we really believe that the future of this country is in our hands? Do we know that there is a huge responsibility, not only [on the government], no, the responsibility is on every and each Armenian, be that in Armenia, in Artsakh, or in Diaspora.

[...] we cannot basically achieve what we want to achieve alone. You are sons and daughters of Armenia, [...], no matter where you live, [...], you have to believe that you are a part of this great nation, so, well I hope one day, at the end of my term of president, at least I will be able to say that all of these years, I achieved something. To be not the president of the citizens of Republic of Armenia, but also the president of all Armenians worldwide, not by name, but by work, and hard work, to make this country great.|sign=[[Armen Sarkissian]], 4th president of Armenia|source=}}

== Diaspora and NGOs (1915–present) ==
{{See also|Armenian diaspora|World Armenian Congress}}
Armenian communities and schools around the world often organize trips to Armenia, to visit or to offer volunteer work in exchange for accommodation subsidies, to preserve the sentiment of attachment to their homeland in the younger generations.

The [[Armenian General Benevolent Union|Armenian General Benevolent Union (AGBU)]], the biggest and most influential Armenian organization in the world, helps to preserve and promote Armenian identity and heritage through [[educational]], [[cultural]] and [[humanitarian]] programs, annually serving some 500,000 Armenians in over 30 countries. Other Armenian community organizations, such as the [[Armenian Youth Federation|Armenian Youth Federation (AYF)]], also help to preserve the Armenian identity within the Diaspora.

Another international non-profit organization called [[Birthright Armenia|''Birthright Armenia'']], founded in 2003 by Edele Hovnanian, provides services to help Diaspora Armenians develop personal ties and a renewed sense of Armenian identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.birthrightarmenia.org/en/about-us|title=Birthright Armenia - About Us|last=|first=|date=|website=Birthright Armenia|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701201417/http://www.birthrightarmenia.org:80/en/about-us|archive-date=2016-07-01|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birthright Armenia is a volunteer internship enhancement program that also offers travel fellowships to eligible participants to assist in the development of Armenia. To participate, applicants are required to be of Armenian descent and be within a certain age range.

The non-profit [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] ''Repat Armenia'', established in August 2012, provides services to assist Diaspora Armenians with their repatriation process. Their mission is to encourage the repatriation of professional and entrepreneurial individuals and families to Armenia to help in the development of the Armenian nation. They also influence government policies, and help to develop a pro-repatriation environment in Armenia.

All of these organizations have made efforts to reconnect the Diaspora Armenians with their homeland, in hopes that they will one day repatriate.

The '''Royal Navy Chaplaincy Service''' provides [[Military chaplain|chaplains]] to the [[Royal Navy]]. The chaplains are commissioned by the Sovereign but do not hold military rank other than that of "Chaplain Royal Navy". They are usually addressed as Padre, Reverend or more informally Bish. Chaplains are recruited from a number of [[Christian denominations]].

The senior chaplain in the Royal Navy is currently [[Martyn Gough (chaplain)|Martyn Gough]]. An Anglican priest, he is also the Archdeacon for the Royal Navy.

==Training==
Chaplains undergo training at [[Britannia Royal Naval College]] alongside other [[Royal Navy]] officer cadets. After completing the course they may opt to earn their "Dolphins" and serve in the [[Royal Navy Submarine Service|Submarine Service]] or the [[green beret]] (upon completion of the [[All Arms Commando Course]]) and serve with the [[Royal Marines]].

==Chaplains of the Fleet==

Accessed 7 November  2010&lt;/ref&gt; Her novels have gained a reputation for their feminist outlook and sexual frankness&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nobleworld.biz/images/Agarwal.pdf |title=Accessed 04 August 2010. |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have been translated into English and published from India under the title ''[[The Dark Abode]]'' (2008) ({{ISBN|978-81-906956-2-6}}) and published from [[Bangladesh]] in [[Bengali language|Bengali]] as ''Mithya Gerosthali'' ( 2007 ) ({{ISBN|984 404 287-9}}).

== Essays ==
She has published a collection of essays titled '[[Sensible Sensuality]]'' (2010),&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|978-81-7273-541-8}} published by Authors Press, E-35/103, Jawahar Park, Laxmi Nagar, Delhi- 110 092&lt;/ref&gt;'' where redefining femininity with Eastern perspective, the book  explores why sexuality plays a major role in our understanding of Eastern feminism. The author thinks feminism should not act in opposition to men as individuals. To her, feminism is against oppressive and outdated social structures which forces both men and women into positions which are false and antagonistic. Thus, everyone has an important role to play in the feminist movement. It seems ironic that feminism has been characterized as anti-male, when in fact, it seeks to liberate men from the macho stereotypic roles men often have to endure such as the need to suppress feelings, act aggressively, and be deprived of contact with children. Sahoo thinks people  should emphasize their  femininity rather to impose the so-called stereotyped feministic attitude of the second wave.''&lt;ref&gt;Note by publisher of Sensible Sensuality, {{ISBN|978-81-7273-541-8}}, Accessed 3 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;''

As an Indian feminist, many of Sarojini Sahoo's writings deal candidly with female sexuality, the emotional lives of women, and the intricate fabric of human relationships, depicting extensively about the interior experiences of women and how their burgeoning sexuality is seen as a threat to traditional patriarchal societies; this book is rare of its kind and has covered the topics that never be discussed so far in any Indian discourse. Her debatable concept on feminism, her denial of [[Simone De Beauvoir]]'s 'the other theory', make her a prominent feminist personality of South Asia and for which KINDLE Magazine of India has placed her among 25 exceptional mindset women of India.&lt;ref&gt;Preface by publisher of Sensible Sensuality, {{ISBN|978-81-7273-541-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Thoughts and themes ==

=== Feminism ===
Sarojini Sahoo is a key figure and trendsetter of [[feminism]] in contemporary [[Indian literature]]. For her, feminism is not a "gender problem" or confrontational attack on male [[hegemony]] and, as such, differs from the feminist views of [[Virginia Woolf]] or [[Judith Butler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orissadiary.com/personality/writer/sarojinisahoo%20.asp |title=Accessed 8 May 2008 |publisher=Orissadiary.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sahoo accepts feminism as an integral part of femaleness separate from the masculine world. Writing with a heightened awareness of women's bodies, she has developed an appropriate style that exploits openness, fragmentation, and nonlinearity.&lt;ref&gt;Dominic, K.V. "Preface." Critical Studies on Contemporary Indian English Women Writers. Ed. K.V.Dominic. New Delhi: Sarup Publishers. Page:ix. {{ISBN|978-81-7625-631-5}}. Accessed 4 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Sahoo, however contents that whilst the woman identity is certainly constitutionally different from that of man, men and women still share a basic human equality. Thus the harmful asymmetric sex /gender "Othering" arises accidentally and 'passively'from natural, unavoidable intersubjectivity.&lt;ref&gt;Jemmer, Patrick: The O(the)r (O)the(r), Engage Newcastle Volume 1 ({{ISSN|2045-0567}}; {{ISBN|978-1-907926-00-6}}) August 2010, published Newcastle UK: NewPhilSoc Publishing, also see at "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=YlN_kz8th4cC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=Sarojini+Sahoo&amp;ots=EFtjSxyA3q&amp;sig=qa7R"&lt;/ref&gt;

Treating female sexuality from [[puberty]] to [[menopause]], her fiction always projects a feminine sensibility. Feminine feelings such as restrictions during [[adolescence]] or [[pregnancy]], fear factors such as [[rape]] or being condemned by society, the concept of the "bad girl," and so on, are treated thematically and in-depth throughout her novels and short stories.

Her feminism is constantly linked to the sexual politics of a woman. She denies patriarchal limits of sexual expression for a woman and she identifies women's [[sexual liberation]] as the real motive behind the women's movement.&lt;ref name="Sahoo, Sarojini 2010"&gt;Sahoo, Sarojini, Sensible Sensuality, Authors press, Delhi, {{ISBN|978-81-7273-541-8}}, Accessed 4 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  In South Asian Outlook, an e-magazine published from Canada, Menka Walia writes: "Sahoo typically evolves her stories around Indian women and sexuality, which is something not commonly written about, but is rather discouraged in a traditionalist society. As a feminist, she advocates women's rights and usually gives light to the injustices Eastern women face. In her interviews, she usually talks about the fact that women are second-class citizens in India, backing up these facts with examples of how love marriages are forbidden, the rejection of divorces, the unfairness of dowries, and the rejection of female politicians."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.southasianoutlook.com/issues/june_2008/sarojini_sahoo_advocating_womens_rights_through_literature.html&lt;/ref&gt;
For her, [[orgasm]] is the body's natural call to feminist politics: if being a woman is this good, women must be worth something. Her novels like ''Upanibesh'', ''Pratibandi'' and ''[[The Dark Abode|Gambhiri Ghara]] '' cover a myriad of areas from sexuality to [[philosophy]]; from the politics of the home to politics of the world. According to American journalist Linda Lowen, Sarojini Sahoo has written extensively as an Indian feminist about the interior lives of women and how their burgeoning sexuality is seen as a threat to traditional patriarchal societies.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Lowen, Linda, ''Indian Feminist Author Sarojini Sahoo Explores Female Sexuality'', women's issue guide of [[New York Times]] portal [[About.com]] [http://womensissues.about.com/od/feminismequalrights/a/FeminisminIndia_2.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Sarojini's novels and short stories treat women as sexual beings and probe culturally sensitive topics such as rape, abortion and menopause-from a female perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Lowen, Linda, ''Sarojini Sahoo Explores Female Sexuality'' [http://womensissues.about.com/od/feminismequalrights/a/FeminisminIndia_2.htm] &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexuality===
Sexuality is something that can be related to many other aspects of culture, tightly-linked with an individual life, or into the evolution of a culture.  Anyone's class or ethnic or geographic identity could be closely associated to his/her sexuality, or anyone's sense of art or literature.  Sexuality is not just an entity in itself.&lt;ref name="Sahoo, Sarojini 2010"/&gt;

Still, either in West or in East, there is a reluctant outlook towards sexuality. Society has always tried to hide it from any open forum. But neither society, nor the legislature, or even the judiciary stand by the side of sexuality to support it.

In the West, [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' or even [[Radclyffe Hall]]'s ''Loneliness in the Well'' or [[Virginia Woolf]]'s  ''[[Orlando: A Biography|Orlando]]'' are some examples which have to suffer a lot for describing sexuality in literature. Sexuality in literature grew with feminism.

Simone De Beauvoir, in her book ''[[The Second Sex]]'', first elaborately described the gender role and problem away from biological differences. In [[Odia literature]], Sarojini is considered a key figure to discuss sexuality in her fiction with a sincere effort to express her feminist ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Oriya Women's Writing: Paul St-Pierre and Ganeswar Mishra, Sateertha Publication, {{ISBN|81-900749-0-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her novel ''Upanibesh'' was the first attempt in [[Odia literature]] to focus on sexuality as a part of social revolt by any woman.&lt;ref name=amarigapa&gt;''The Amari Gapa'': Special Issue on Sarojini, May–July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Medha, the protagonist of her  novel, was a [[bohemian style|bohemian]] .  In her pre-marital stage, she was thinking that it was boring to live with a man lifelong.  Perhaps she wanted a chain free life, where there would be only love, only sex and would not be any monotony.  But she had to marry Bhaskar.  Can Indian society imagine a lady with bohemianism?

In her novel ''Pratibandi'', Sarojini has also described the thematic development of sexuality in a woman.  Priyanka, the protagonist of the novel has to encounter the loneliness in the exile of Saragpali, a remote village of India.  This loneliness develops into a sexual urge and soon, Priyanka finds herself sexually attached with a former [[Member of Parliament]].  Though there is an age gap between them, his intelligence impresses her and she discovers a hidden archaeologist in him.

In her novel ''[[The Dark Abode|Gambhiri Ghara]]'', she describes an unusual relationship between two people: a [[Hindu]] housewife of India  and a [[Muslim]] artist of [[Pakistan]]. It is a net-oriented novel.  A woman meets a very sexually experienced man.  One day he asks if she had any such experience.  The woman, Kuki, scolds him and insults him by calling him a caterpillar.  She said without love, lust is like hunger of a caterpillar.  Gradually they become involved with love, lust, and spiritually.  That man considers her as his daughter, lover, mother, and above all these, as a Goddess.  They both madly love each other, through the [[internet]] and on the phone.  They use obscene language and they kiss each other online.  Kuki does not lead a happy conjugal life though she has a love marriage with Aniket.  But the novel is not limited to only a love story.

It has a greater aspect. It deals with the relationship between State and individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boloji.com/women/099.htm |title=accessed 8 May 2008 |publisher=Boloji.com |date=2007-10-14 |accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Safique is not a Muslim by temperament, but as a historian, thinks the Pakistan of today has separated itself from its roots and looks towards Arabian legends for his history.  He protests that the syllabus of history for the school would start from seventh century A.D., not from the Mahenjodaro and Harappa.  Safique was once arrested after the bomb blast of London for allegation of being associated with the terrorist, but is it a fact?  Later Kuki came to know that Safiques is trapped by a military junta.  The ex-lover of Safique's wife had revenged on Safique  by arresting him with an allegation of terrorism.

Here, the author deals with the question of [[terrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oriyanari.com/id21.html |title=accessed 8 May 2008 |publisher=Oriyanari.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is often discussion about terrorism caused by an individual or by a group.  Society rarely discusses terrorism caused by a state.

What is a state?  Is it a group of people that resides within political and geographical boundaries?  Are a state's identity, mood and wishes separate from its ruler?  Is the wish of [[George W. Bush]] not considered as the wish of America?  Has it reflected the mood and wish of the people of America?  So, every time, the state's arranged anarchism or terrorism is merely a reflection of a terrorism caused by an individual. The great truth lies beneath Safique, as a terrorist, develops from the mind of a military man.

The author has successfully painted the difference of sensibility towards sexuality between male and female and has her own credibility for the frankness to deal with sensitive matters, be they matters of politics or matters of sexuality. She has gained a reputation and has her own place in the history of Odia fiction.&lt;ref name="amarigapa"/&gt;

'''Soedharmono''' (12 March 1927 – 25 January 2006) was [[Indonesia]]'s fifth vice president, and was in office during the period 1988 – 1993.

==Early life==
Sudharmono was born on 12 March 1927 in [[Gresik]], [[East Java]]. He lost both his parents in the space of six months when he was only three. Sudharmono then went to live with his uncle, a scribe serving in the [[Jombang Regency|Regency of Jombang]], East Java. As he grew up however, he would move around a lot, living with family from both his father's and his mother's side.

Sudharmono had just completed Junior High School when Indonesia proclaimed its independence from the Netherlands in 1945. After deciding to drop out from any further education, Sudharmono assisted in collecting weapons from the Japanese troops in preparation of the formation of an [[Indonesian Army]]. As a result of this, he became the Commander of the Ronggolawe Division, a position which he held throughout the course of the [[Indonesian War of Independence]] against the returning Dutch troops.

==Career==
After the Dutch retreated in 1949, Sudharmono completed his Secondary Education before going to [[Jakarta]] in 1952 to join the Military Law Academy. He completed the course in 1956 before serving in [[Medan]], [[North Sumatra]] as an Army Attorney from 1957–1961. In 1962, Sudharmono received his degree in law after completing a course at Military Law University. After this, Sudharmono was appointed Chairman of the Central Government Personnel Orders Unit and provided administrative assistance to the Government.

During the [[Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation]], President [[Sukarno]] formed the Supreme Operations Command (KOTI), which was a war command immediately under Sukarno's control. In 1963, Sudharmono joined KOTI and was given the role of Joint Centre Operations Member for the Supreme Operations

==The ''New Order''==
It was from this position that Sudharmono began his rise. In October 1965, Major General Suharto was appointed Army Commander and joined KOTI as its Chief of Staff. Suharto formed a relationship with Sudharmono during these tense times in Indonesian history and it was evident that Sudharmono earned Suharto's trust. On 11 March 1966, when Suharto [[Supersemar|received the Emergency Powers]] from Sukarno, Sudharmono was the one who reproduced copies of the letter to be distributed to other Military Officers. The next day, on 12 March 1966, Sudharmono was also the one to write the decree banning PKI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Elson |first= Robert |title= Suharto: A Political Biography |year= 2001 |publisher= The Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge |location= UK |isbn=0-521-77326-1 |page= 138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Suharto's rise to power, KOTI was disbanded but Sudharmono's administrative skills and the trust that he had earned from Suharto ensured him a position in Suharto's administration. When Suharto became President in 1968, Sudharmono was named Cabinet Secretary as well as Chairman of the Economic Stability Council. In 1970, Sudharmono was moved from the position of Cabinet Secretary to the State Secretary, a position which allowed him to assist Suharto in the day-to-day running of the Government. Whilst State Secretary, Sudharmono also covered for other Ministers when they are unable to perform their duties; with short stints as Interim Information Minister and Interim Home Affairs Minister as well as helping to produce Suharto's accountability speech before the [[People Consultative Assembly]] (MPR) General Session.

In 1980, Sudharmono's position as State Secretary received a significant boost through a Presidential Decision which gave the State Secretary the power to supervise Government purchases exceeding 500 Million [[Rupiahs]].

==Chairman of Golkar==
By the 1980s, Sudharmono had proved his loyalty to Suharto and had also shown that he does not have any ambitions. At the 1983 Golkar Congress, with Suharto's support, Sudharmono was elected as the Chairman of Golkar.

As Chairman, Sudharmono conducted many inspection tours of Golkar branches in the regions. Sudharmono also initiated a membership drive to get more voters to Golkar, an initiative that paid dividends in the 1987 Legislative Elections when Golkar's votes increased from 64% to 73%. The 1987 Legislative Elections was also a historical one for Golkar as it emerged victorious in the Province of [[Aceh]] for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Vice Presidency==

===Nomination controversy===
As the MPR convened for its 1988 General Session, it was widely believed by many that Suharto (who was 67 years old) would be elected to his fifth and last term as President. With that in mind, the Vice Presidency became a crucial position. As 1988 began, Suharto began to show signs that he wanted Sudharmono to become his Vice President. Although never mentioning Sudharmono by name, Suharto said that he wanted his Vice President to enjoy the support of a large socio-political force.

The possibility of Sudharmono becoming Vice President displeased many in [[ABRI]]. Although Sudharmono had been an Army man himself and had ended his career with the rank of [[Lieutenant General]], he had spent most of his career behind a desk instead of commanding troops. For this, he was looked down upon by ABRI. Suharto was aware of this and before ABRI could do anything, replaced [[Benny Moerdani]] with [[Try Sutrisno]] as ABRI Commander. This move crippled ABRI as Moerdani was more assertive when it comes to disagreeing with Suharto while Try, having been Suharto's aide-de-camp would be more passive.

When the nomination was finally taken up through the official channels with Golkar, the Bureaucrats and Functional factions unanimously agreed to nominate Sudharmono as Vice President. The ABRI faction's nomination was delayed, with Moerdani continuing to procrastinate by claiming that he had not discussed the Vice Presidential nomination yet.&lt;ref name="tempointeraktif.com"&gt;{{cite web

At the 1988 MPR General Session in March 1988, controversy continued to dog Sudharmono's nomination as Vice President. First, [[Brigadier General]] Ibrahim Saleh interrupted the Session and was beginning to launch a scathing attack to Sudharmono before he was taken down from the podium by ABRI MPR members. Then [[Sarwo Edhie Wibowo]], a General who had helped Suharto get to power in the mid-60's resigned from both his MPR and [[People's Representative Council]] (DPR) seat  

in protest. Finally, [[United Development Party]] Chairman, Jaelani Naro nominated himself as Vice President, presumably with the private backing in ABRI, who in public supported Sudharmono's nomination.

Suharto finally intervened. He cited a decision that the MPR made in 1973 that one of the criteria for a Vice President was that he should be able to work with the President. Suharto also conducted discussions with Naro and convinced him to withdraw the nomination. With Naro out of the way, Sudharmono was finally elected as Vice President.

===Term as Vice President===
[[File:Sudharmono and Try Sutrisno.jpg|thumb|250px|Sudharmono and Vice President-elect Try Sutrisno at the 1993 session of the People's Consultative Assembly]]
As Vice President, Sudharmono was extremely active. He regularly visited the Provinces and set up Mailbox 5000, a place where the people can send their suggestions and complains and the government. Sudharmono, ever the specialist in giving administrative assistance, was also given the duty by Suharto to supervise government bureaucracy.

Despite this however, ABRI continued to show their displeasure at Sudharmono's election as Vice President. At the Golkar Congress in October 1988, ABRI got their revenge against Sudharmono when they secured the election of Wahono as the Chairman of Golkar. ABRI members were also responsible for a smear campaign which involved accusing Sudharmono as a communist. Finally in March 1993, to prevent having to deal with a Vice President that they did not like, ABRI nominated Try Sutrisno as Vice President without waiting for Suharto to make his choice.

===Possible President?===
In his book, ''Suharto: A Political Biography'', [[Robert Elson]] theorized of the possibility of Sudharmono's Vice Presidency being the final step before the Indonesian Presidency itself&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Elson |first= Robert |title= Suharto: A Political Biography |year= 2001 |publisher= The Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge |location= UK |isbn=0-521-77326-1 |pages= 258–260}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that Suharto only continued because of the reaction to Sudharmono's nomination There are two reasons for this:
*1: As State Secretary, Sudharmono's duty was to assist the President in the day-to-day administration of the Government. Having held this position for 18 years prior to being elected Vice President, Sudharmono was sure to have been familiar with the inner workings of the Suharto regime.
*2: ABRI would not have gone to extreme lengths to show their displeasure at Sudharmono being elected Vice President if they did not expect a long-term effect.

==Post Vice Presidency==
In 1997, Sudharmono released his autobiography, ''Pengalaman Dalam Masa Pengabdian'' (Experiences During Time of Service). Concurrently, a book was also released called ''Kesan dan Kenangan dari Teman: 70 Tahun H. Sudharmono SH'' (Impressions and Memories from Colleagues: 70 Years of Sudharmono) which talked about Sudharmono from the point of view of those who he had worked with. Because the release of these books happened a year before the 1998 MPR General Session, there were rumors that Sudharmono was going to make a political comeback and aim for the Vice Presidency once again.&lt;ref name="tempointeraktif.com"/&gt;

In May 1998, on the eve of Suharto's fall, Sudharmono, together with former vice presidents [[Umar Wirahadikusumah]] and Try Sutrisno visited Suharto at his residence to discuss possible options.

Sudharmono also continued to manage Suharto's Foundations (''Yayasan'').

==Death==
Sudharmono died on 25 January 2006. His body was buried in the [[Kalibata Heroes Cemetery|TMP Kalibata]], Jakarta.

==Family==
Sudharmono married Erma Norma, with whom he had five children. His last son has three children.

==Biography==
Tetiana Chornovol was born in [[Kiev]], [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]], [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=CVK2012/&gt; Her parents come from [[Cherkasy Oblast]] in central Ukraine.&lt;ref name=zhu11/&gt; Currently she lives in the Kiev suburb of Hora located in [[Boryspil Raion]].&lt;ref name=CVK2012/&gt;

In 2001, she graduated from the Faculty of Journalism of the [[Kiev International Institute of Linguistics and Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Тетяна Чорновол|url = http://ua.112.ua/profiles/tetiana-chornovol-194.html|website = ua.112.ua|access-date = 2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Journalist career==
[[File:Tetiana_Chornovol.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Chornovol at an opposition rally in September 2012]]
Chornovol has been employed by or freelanced for many Ukrainian publications focusing on politics and [[corruption in Ukraine]]. She also reported from post-Soviet [[armed conflict]]s in which [[UNA-UNSO]] volunteers participated.

From 2001 to 2004, she led the "Theme of the week" heading in the "Peak" magazine.&lt;ref name="Чорновол Татьяна"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Чорновол Татьяна|url = http://file.liga.net/person/72682-chornovol-tatyana.html|website = ЛІГА.Досье|access-date = 2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigative career===
In 2004, she began specializing in [[investigative journalism]], contributing to several Ukrainian [[online newspaper]]s, including ''[[Ukrayinska Pravda]]'',&lt;ref name=BBC-Profile/&gt; ''Levyi Bereg''&lt;ref name=BBC-Profile/&gt; and ''Obozrevatel''. Her focus topics are suspicious personal wealth of Ukrainian politicians, public servants, and businessmen, as well as their involvement in [[Crime in Ukraine|crime]].

In 2008, a judgment was obtained from the [[High Court of Justice]] in London after ''Obozrevatel'' refused to retract false and libelous statements in articles by Chornovol&lt;ref name=KP120112/&gt; alleging that [[Rinat Akhmetov]] was connected to criminal activity and violence. Chornovol&lt;ref name=KP120112/&gt; had interviewed his former classmates and neighbors, and delved into his early years.&lt;ref name=KP110211/&gt; Following court pressure, ''Obozrevatel'' issued an official apology stating, "The editorial hereby admits that there was unchecked and false information about Rinat Akhmetov present in the … articles … We hereby give our apologies to Rinat Akhmetov for the problems resulting from the above-mentioned publications."&lt;ref name=Focus080115/&gt;&lt;ref name=OR081122/&gt; Chornovol refused to issue an apology or acknowledge any wrongdoing.&lt;ref name=KP120112/&gt;  ''Obozrevatel'' said it was not invited or informed of the date of the court hearing,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ахметов удивил "Обозреватель"|url = http://obozrevatel.com/news/2008/1/14/210971.htm|website = Обозреватель|access-date = 2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and claimed that the decisions of British judges are not legitimate in Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ахметов "разводит" Обозреватель на $100 тыс.|url = http://obozrevatel.com/news/2008/6/10/242350.htm|website = Обозреватель|access-date = 2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other articles by Chornovol addressed the alleged [[Bratva|organized crime background]] of then-[[President of Ukraine|President]] [[Viktor Yanukovych]] and reported on his lavish countryside property.&lt;ref name=BBC-Profile/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT131226/&gt; According to a story in the ''New York Times'', in August 2012 Chornovol "scaled the walls of Mr. Yanukovych's then [[Mezhyhirya (residence)|residential compound, which includes 345 acres of forested hills along the Dnieper River and is called 'Mezhyhirya' after the park where it is situated]], and spent nearly three hours wandering the property and taking photographs before being detained by security".&lt;ref name=NYT131226/&gt; Chornovol was the first investigative journalist researching Mezhyhirya; she started work on the topic in 2006.&lt;ref name=MN100916/&gt;

===Recent investigations===
Immediately before the attack on her, Chornovol made an on-site investigation of the suburban alleged property of Ukraine's [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Ukraine)|Internal Affairs Minister (police chief)]] [[Vitaliy Zakharchenko]] and published a blog report with photos&lt;ref name=ABC131226/&gt;&lt;ref name=UP-Hangman/&gt;) as well as those allegedly belonging to the country's [[General Prosecutor of Ukraine|General Prosecutor]] [[Viktor Pshonka]]. The material was mentioned in her conversations with editors and colleagues.&lt;ref name=LBEn131225/&gt;&lt;ref name=UP131225-lyudi/&gt;

Reacting to Chornovol's 25 December 2013 beating, ''Ukrayinska Pravda'' and Chornovol's husband announced that they "suspected each and every person whom Tetiana Chornovol wrote about" personally, including President Yanukovych, in "ordering that attack", until proven otherwise.&lt;ref name=RFE131228/&gt;&lt;ref name=UP131225-lyudi/&gt;

==Activism and politics==

Chornovol comes from an ultra right political background: She joined the [[Ukrainian National Assembly – Ukrainian National Self Defence|UNA-UNSO]] organization at age 17, and later began her media work there as a [[press secretary]].&lt;ref name=zhu11/&gt; However, she soon became disillusioned with extremist politics, but remained committed to social [[activism]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Chornovol openly admits committing various petty crimes in the course of her political acts and investigations, including [[trespass]]ing and defacing property (such as by [[spray painting]] and [[egg]] pelting), and encourages other activists to follow her lead in [[nonviolent resistance]] way.&lt;ref name=UP131212/&gt;

===Long-term activist===
Chornovol participated in all major patriotic/anti-corruption actions in Ukraine since late 1990s, including [[Ukraine without Kuchma]] (2001), the [[Orange Revolution]] (2004), the 2011 protests against [[Russian language]] [[Legislation on languages in Ukraine|use expansion]], and [[Euromaidan|Euromaidan protests]]. During "Ukraine without Kuchma" (while still with the UNA-UNSO), she [[handcuffs|handcuffed]] herself to the busy rails in the [[Kiev Passenger Railway Station]] with a fellow female protester.&lt;ref name=zhu11/&gt;

In 2011-2013, Chornovol participated in several risky protests against illegal [[land development]], historical [[architecture]] destruction, and [[local government]] oppression in the city of [[Kiev]], including the seizure of a [[tower crane]] over the [[Gostiny Dvor (Kyiv)|Gostynyi Dvir]]&lt;ref name=Unian130526/&gt; and occupying a high-rise [[cornice]] of the [[Kiev City Council|Kiev City Council assembly hall]]&lt;ref name=BBC-Profile/&gt; (both by climbing). While she was climbing the crane, construction workers threw bricks at her but missed. She was removed from the council assembly hall cornice by [[State Emergency Service|firemen]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

In the first week of Euromaidan, Chornovol, protected by [[bicycle helmet]], was present near the [[van]] suspected of conducting covert surveillance of protest leaders, and immediately stormed it (by smashing the [[roof window]] with a [[cobblestone]] and jumping in) in order to prevent destruction of evidence. The automobile turned out to be a [[communications intelligence]] vehicle of the [[Security Service of Ukraine]].&lt;ref name=BBC-Profile/&gt;

On 1 December 2013, Chornovol was widely reported smashing windows at [[Kiev City Hall]] in the course of protesters' attempts to seize the building.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} As she later explained to journalist colleagues, storming and occupying city hall was necessary for warming activists from freezing temperatures (the building was used for this purpose from then on).{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

===Unsuccessful election campaign===
Chornovol unsuccessfully ran in the [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2012|2012 parliamentary election]] in the suburban [[Lviv Oblast]] [[Electoral district|constituency]] [[Horodok, Lviv Oblast|Horodok]], representing the oppositional [[Batkivshchyna]] party.&lt;ref name=BBC-Profile/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT131226/&gt; She came second after [[non-partisan]] [[Yaroslav Dubnevych]], who got 47.04% of the votes against Chornovol's 38.88%.&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www.cvk.gov.ua/pls/vnd2012/WP040?PT001F01=900&amp;pf7331=120 Results in constituency 120 in the 2012 parliamentary election], [[Central Election Commission of Ukraine]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==25 December attack==
In the early morning of 25 December 2013 at 01:30 AM Chornovol was severely beaten by a group of men who dragged her from her car near [[Boryspil International Airport]] in [[Boryspil]] outside Kiev.&lt;ref name=BBC-Profile/&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN131225/&gt; The attack provoked massive outcry in Ukraine and around the globe.&lt;ref name=LBEn131225/&gt;&lt;ref name=LBhopes/&gt;&lt;ref name=ABC131226/&gt;

Chornovol's car was rammed off of the road by a [[Porsche Cayenne]], and two assailants dragged her from her car, beat her, and threw her in a roadside ditch. The attack took place hours after Chernovol published an article on a posh suburban residence which she said was being built for [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Ukraine)#Ministers of Internal Affairs of Ukraine|Minister of Internal Affairs]] [[Vitaliy Zakharchenko]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131226060907/http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/police-watchdog-under-siege-in-ukraine-amid-unrest/2013/12/25/3abb4cd0-6d4a-11e3-a5d0-6f31cd74f760_story.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chornovol was hospitalized with initial diagnosis of broken nose, concussion, and multiple bruises.&lt;ref name=TG131225/&gt;

===Reaction===

In her 26 December bed-ridden interview, Chornovol stated that her investigations were the only possible reason for the attack on her, and dismissed suggestions that the attack was a result of either [[road rage]] or a [[false flag]] [[Agent provocateur|political provocation]] against authorities.&lt;ref name=LBEn131225/&gt;

The [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) and [[Embassy of the United States, Kiev|U.S. embassy in Ukraine]] condemned the attack.&lt;ref name=TG131225/&gt; Opposition parties accused the authorities of being behind the attacks, while a statement from [[Olena Anatoliivna Bondarenko|Olena Bondarenko]] of the [[Party of Regions]] categorized the attack as spontaneous violence caused by Euromaidan, and blamed the opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theinsider.com.ua/politics/52bb0b2c682a2/|title=Кого підозрюють у побитті Тетяни Чорновол?|publisher=Insider|date=2013-12-25|accessdate=2014-01-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140125131255/http://www.theinsider.com.ua/politics/52bb0b2c682a2/|archivedate=2014-01-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the (then) governor of [[Kharkiv Oblast]], [[Mykhailo Dobkin]], the attack (that he compared to the [[Reichstag fire]]) had been organised by insiders.&lt;ref name="DobkinOD291213"&gt;[http://www.opendemocracy.net/od-russia/iryna-solomko/ukraine%E2%80%99s-point-of-no-return Ukraine’s point of no return], [[openDemocracy.net]] (29 December 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Dobkin's full response was: "Why should modern day [[Nazis]] set [[Reichstag fire|fire to the Reichstag]], when they can sort things out by thrashing anything up to ten local activists who have figured in the media?

===Investigation===
The driver of the car that rammed Chornovol off the road was arrested on 25 December 2013, who upon police questioning identified the other two attackers, one of whom was arrested.&lt;ref name=IF-arrest/&gt;&lt;ref name=KP-arrests/&gt; In total five suspected attackers were detained by the [[Ukrainian police]].&lt;ref name=IF-five/&gt; According to police investigator Mykola Chynchyn, one of the suspects formerly belonged to a criminal organization led by [[Viktor Rybalko]]; and added "[[The Klitschko brothers]] allegedly were closely involved in Rybalko's organization".&lt;ref name=ChynchynKP271213/&gt; Chynchyn also stated that opposition lawmaker [[Mykola Knyazhytsky]], [[Volodymyr Polochaninov]] and [[David Zhvania]] were connected to a suspect.&lt;ref name=ChynchynKP271213/&gt; [[Serhiy Kotenko]] (a former co-owner of [[TVi (channel)|TVi]]) is a brother of one of the suspects.&lt;ref name=ChynchynKP271213/&gt; [[Vitali Klitschko]] vehemently denied links to the suspects and stated that he would sue Chynchyn for slander, libel and defamation of character.&lt;ref name=ChynchynKP271213/&gt;

Chornovol's husband characterized the incident as [[attempted murder]], saying "she was beaten with the intent to kill", and accused police investigators of downplaying the legal status of the crime.&lt;ref name=LB131230/&gt; Chornovol believes the attack was ordered by president [[Viktor Yanukovych]] for her ongoing investigation into a new luxury mansion and palace he was building.&lt;ref name=KP140119/&gt;

=== Aftermath ===
{{anchor|Health consequences}} Late on 25 December Chornovol was prepared for a series of [[reconstructive surgery|reconstructive surgeries]] on her [[nose]] and right [[Orbit (anatomy)|eye orbit]], and was recovering from severe [[concussion]].&lt;ref name=LBEn131225/&gt;&lt;ref name="Koshkina FB on Chornovol health"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.facebook.com/sonya.koshkina/posts/716309115058259 | title=Koshkina FB on Chornovol health | date=25 December 2013 | accessdate=28 December 2013 | website=[[Facebook]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 30 December, Chornovol was transferred out of [[Intensive Care Unit|intensive care]] but remained in hospital due to severe [[hypersomnia]].&lt;ref name=LB131230/&gt; On 7 January 2014, she was ready to be discharged from hospital, though still requiring outpatient treatment.

On 21 February 2014, when [[Euromaidan]] protesters raided the Mezhyhirya presidential residence of [[Viktor Yanukovych]], Euromaidian activists and investigators from the [[Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project]] discovered "black lists" of journalists and activists involved in the oppositions, with an individual dossier on Chornovol, with photographs and the license plate of her car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/kgorchinskaya/status/437351507437293569 |title=Tanyan Chornovol and her car in #Mezhyhirya docs |author=Katya Gorchinskaya |publisher=Twitter |date=2014-02-22 |accessdate=2014-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
{{Cleanup section|reason=lack of neutrality and in some cases poor translation|date=June 2018}}

On 5 March 2014, Chornovol was appointed head of [[Ukrainian government]]'s [[National Anti-Corruption Committee]] by the [[First Yatsenyuk Government|Yatsenyuk Government]].&lt;ref name=CHNACC/&gt;&lt;ref name=TCETV6314/&gt; She resigned on 18 August 2014. Chornovol said that "there is no political will in Ukraine to carry out a hard-edged, large-scale war against corruption."&lt;ref name=KP140818/&gt;

Chornovol became a founding member of the new party [[People's Front (Ukraine)|People's Front]] on 10 September 2014, 46 days before the [[2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election]].&lt;ref name=PA140910/&gt;&lt;ref name=BG140825/&gt; In this election she was elected into parliament as the [[runner up]] on the electoral list of People's Front, second to prime minister [[Arseniy Yatsenyuk]].&lt;ref name=Rada-Bio/&gt;&lt;ref name=TVI140915/&gt;&lt;ref name=PA140920/&gt;

In 2015, she initiated a criminal prosecution&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://censor.net.ua/resonance/344926/sistemne_pograbuvannya_derjavnogo_ukrgazvidobuvannya|title=Системне пограбування державного "Укргазвидобування"|last=Цензор.НЕТ|work=Цензор.НЕТ|access-date=2018-06-20|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt; of People's Deputy [[Oleksandr Onyshchenko]] and the head of the [[State Fiscal Service (Ukraine)|State Fiscal Service]] [[Roman Nasirov]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://censor.net.ua/blogs/1104623/prichina_zatrimannya_romana_nasrova|title=Причина затримання Романа Насірова.|last=Цензор.НЕТ|work=Цензор.НЕТ|access-date=2018-06-20|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt; on behalf of [[National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine|NABU]] for non-payment of the billions of taxes on gas and oil extraction of firms under the control of Onyshchenko, as well as the illegal restructuring of these debts to Nasirov.

Chornovol started her own investigation of crimes committed by Onyschenko from the visit to his office in Myronivka.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rian.com.ua/video/20150617/369120871.html|title=Чорновол в Мироновке ворвалась в офис ООО "Надра-Геоцентр"|last=Novosti|first=RIA|website=РИА Новости Украина|language=ru|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Verkhovna Rada voting for the cancelling of deputies immunity of Onyshchenko, Chornovol symbolically came in a sweater with horses - Onyshchenko is a famous horse fan.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

On December 22, 2016, Tetiana Chornovol's bill 5129 was adopted,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ecology.unian.ua/alternativeenergy/1693036-rada-znizila-vdvichi-zeleniy-tarif-dlya-velikih-sonyachnih-elektrostantsiy.html|title=Рада знизила вдвічі "зелений" тариф для великих сонячних електростанцій|access-date=2018-06-20|language=uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; which destroyed the scheme for obtaining extra profits by alternative energy companies created by the Klyuyev brothers during the Yanukovych government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.pravda.com.ua/authors/chornovol/56386da5794f3/view_print/|title=Тетяна Чорновол: Два мільярди для Клюєва|website=Українська правда - Блоги|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a member of the National Security and Defense Committee, she was focused on budget financing of defense plants&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-economy/2064445-harkivski-vijskovi-zavodi-otrimali-najbilse-derzzamovlenna-nardep.html|title=Харківські військові заводи отримали держзамовлення більше всіх - нардеп|access-date=2018-06-20|language=uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the repair and modernization of armored vehicles, tanks and artillery.

Together with the chairman of the committee, [[Serhiy Pashynskyi|Serhii Pashynskyi]], in 2015, initiated a bill on the special confiscation of Yanukovych's assets in the state budget in the form of bonds worth $1.5 billion, arrested in the banks of Ukraine after the Maidan. For more than two years Chornovol has been struggling to confiscate these funds, which was only made in May 2017. Chornovol was the author of a number of bills (3025,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://w1.c1.rada.gov.ua/pls/zweb2/webproc4_1?id=&amp;pf3511=56358|title=Офіційний портал Верховної Ради України|website=w1.c1.rada.gov.ua|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 4057,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://w1.c1.rada.gov.ua/pls/zweb2/webproc4_1?id=&amp;pf3511=58150|title=Офіційний портал Верховної Ради України|website=w1.c1.rada.gov.ua|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 4811,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://w1.c1.rada.gov.ua/pls/zweb2/webproc4_1?id=&amp;pf3511=59403|title=Офіційний портал Верховної Ради України|website=w1.c1.rada.gov.ua|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 4890,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://w1.c1.rada.gov.ua/pls/zweb2/webproc4_1?id=&amp;pf3511=59541|title=Офіційний портал Верховної Ради України|website=w1.c1.rada.gov.ua|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 5557,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://w1.c1.rada.gov.ua/pls/zweb2/webproc4_1?id=&amp;pf3511=60755|title=Офіційний портал Верховної Ради України|website=w1.c1.rada.gov.ua|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;) which established the legal mechanism for the confiscation of these funds, and also inherited the laws of many Western European countries regarding the confiscation of unjustified assets. However, no bill was supported by the Verkhovna Rada. Chornovol stated about the influence of such people from Yanukovych's environment as Andriy Portnov,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.pravda.com.ua/authors/chornovol/5853e043c0e85/page_2/|title=Тетяна Чорновол: Євразія.

In 2016, it even led to the suspension of factories for the repair and modernization of military equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.pravda.com.ua/authors/chornovol/579fa58d8e629/|title=Тетяна Чорновол: Нардепи-самодури зупинили роботу ремонтних заводів для фронту.

In appointing a new [[General Prosecutor of Ukraine|General Prosecutor]], the group of Oleksandr Turchynov in the People's Front fraction, which member Chornovol is, initiated an agreement to support [[Yuriy Lutsenko]]'s candidacy in exchange for a "special confiscation".{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Prosecutor General's Office of Yuriy Lutsenko succeeded in May 2017 - $1.5 billion were confiscated into the State Budget of Ukraine as part of the investigation into the actions of the criminal organization of ex-president Yanukovych, with the efforts of prosecutor Kostyantyn Kulyk.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

However, the fact of the confiscation of Yanukovych's assets was harshly criticized by a number of public anti-corruption organizations in Ukraine. Chornovol said&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ua.censor.net.ua/resonance/397274/nimtsi_rozsliduvaly_yaki_yurysty_suprovodjuvaly_shemy_kurchenka|title=Німці розслідували, які юристи супроводжували схеми Курченка|last=Цензор.НЕТ|work=Цензор.НЕТ|access-date=2018-06-20|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt; that this was due to the fact that lawyers, who at the time of Yanukovych legally accompanied the government's corruption schemes (in particular, the schemes of Kurchenko), after the Maidan began to work&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://censor.net.ua/blogs/1106339/zayava_na_fbr_pro_amerikansk_koshti_dlya_advokatv_yanukovicha|title=Заява на ФБР про американські кошти для адвокатів Януковича|last=Цензор.НЕТ|work=Цензор.НЕТ|access-date=2018-06-20|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt; in public anticorruption organizations.  This caused Chornovol to initiate known amendments to the Law No. 6172 "On Prevention of Corruption", which obliged public officials of public anticorruption organizations to submit e-declarations.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In 2017, Tetiana Chornovol strongly criticized the blockade of trade with companies located in Some districts of Donetsk and Luhansk regions. She tried to influence the public opinion, which, in her belief, falsely supported the so-called blockade on blood'. The MP spoke at rallies&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=ТСН|title=Тетяну Чорновол закидали яйцями під час спроби домовитись з активістами про припинення блокади|date=2017-03-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgFpnEKxUfQ|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Avdiivka, Kramatorsk, and Mariupol.  According to Chornovol, this blockade was initiated by the [[Federal Security Service|FSS]]. It leveled Ukraine's tactical victory in the hybrid war. After all, factories and mines located in the occupied territory, but paid taxes to the budget of Ukraine, as well as supplied raw materials and scarce anthracite for enterprises in Ukraine, went under the control of an aggressor state.

== International reputation ==
In 2014 Foreign Policy magazine included Chornovol into top 100 thinkers - people who changed the world. She was awarded in the nomination "Those who defy" for her fight against the Yanukovych regime and corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://globalthinkers.foreignpolicy.com/#challengers/detail/chornovol|title=The Leading Global Thinkers of 2014 |newspaper=Foreign Policy|language=en|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, she became the protagonist of the documentary "Breaking Point: The War for Democracy in Ukraine" directed by [[Mark Jonathan Harris]] and [[Oles Sanin]]. The film is about the way Ukrainians behaved during the [[2014 Ukrainian revolution]] and [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014–present)|Russian military aggression]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==Private life==
Chornovol is a widowed mother of two. Her husband, Mykola Berezovyi,&lt;ref name=RFE131228/&gt; a volunteer fighter in the [[Azov Battalion]], was killed on 10 August 2014 during the fighting in eastern Ukraine.&lt;ref name=EP140812/&gt;&lt;ref name=GN140811/&gt; Chornovol and her husband met at a political rally.

'''Ignignokt''' and '''Err''' (known collectively as '''The Mooninites''') are fictional characters on the [[Adult Swim]] animated television series ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'' (also known by various [[Aqua Teen Hunger Force#Alternative titles|alternative titles]]). Ignignokt and Err are both [[Two-dimensional space|two dimensional]] alien villains from the [[Moon]] who frequently visit Earth and cause senseless destruction and chaos for the main protagonists. Ignignokt is the larger of the two who frequently appears as more calm and patient, whereas Err appears more temperamental and hyper. Both characters were created by series creators [[Dave Willis]] and [[Matt Maiellaro]]. Willis provides the voice of Ignignokt and Maiellaro provides the voice of Err.

The Mooninites were also the main protagonists in a [[television pilot]] for a potential ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force'' spin-off entitled ''Spacecataz'', which was never picked up for a full series or aired on television, outside of clips during [[cold open]]ings during the [[Aqua Teen Hunger Force (season 3)|third season]]. The Mooninites also received national controversial attention on January 31, 2007, during the [[2007 Boston bomb scare]] when [[LED]] displays resembling them were placed in various locations in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], and were mistaken for bombs causing a panic. The duo has received a positive reception from reviewers at [[IGN]], and have appeared in various forms of media relating to the series including the 2007 series film adaption ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters]]''.

==Role in ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force''==
[[File:Quad Glacier.png|thumb|left|250px|The Mooninites after forming the Quad Glacier.]]
Both of The Mooninites live in the center of the [[Moon]], which they frequently boast about.&lt;ref name=MayhemoftheMooninitesepisode/&gt; Besides Ignignokt and Err, other Mooninites are not commonly seen with the exception of Ignignokt's uncle Cliff and a giant mooninite monster named "The Gorgotron".&lt;ref name=Remoonedcite/&gt;&lt;ref name=MoonMasterepisode&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Moon Master |series=Aqua Teen Hunger Force |network=Adult Swim |date=September 19, 2004 |season=3 |number=8 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the apparent lack of mooninites on the moon a human female police officer patrols the surface of the Moon, as seen in "Jumpy George".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Jumpy George |series=[[Aqua Unit Patrol Squad 1]] |network=Adult Swim |date=July 10, 2011 |number=8 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mooninites periodically visit earth in order to harass [[Master Shake]], [[Meatwad]], [[Frylock]] and [[Carl Brutananadilewski]], arriving in a purple-and-blue spaceship. They particularly target Meatwad to take advantage of his childlike naivete, often encouraging Meatwad to participate in bad behavior such as shoplifting, burglary or smoking cigarettes and [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]].&lt;ref name=MayhemoftheMooninitesepisode/&gt;&lt;ref name=Moonajuana/&gt;&lt;ref name=RevengeoftheMooninitesepisode/&gt; Frylock, who sees right through their schemes, has a very condescending view of The Mooninites and often strives to keep them away from Meatwad, himself, and their property. Master Shake is more welcoming to them than Frylock, and only slightly less gullible than Meatwad when it comes to their lies. The Mooninites seem to welcome Master Shake to a degree by giving him shoplifted items as gifts, inviting him to help cash a stolen government aid check, and offering him marijuana, although they frequently try to trick Shake so they can steal from him as well. Carl is often the primary victim in The Mooninites' plans and schemes. They often end up stealing or destroying his possessions, causing damage to his home or car, and physically assaulting him in some cases. Most encounters The Mooninites have with the main protagonists often end with them rushing to their ship and [[Finger (gesture)|shooting the bird]] to them from [[outer space]] as they return home, as a [[running gag]].

Both of the Mooninites are equipped with a small [[Raygun|laser gun]] that fires a small, slow-moving square bullet (despite Ignignokt's insistence on how fast it goes). Err and Ignignokt also possess the ability to lock their heads together to create the "Quad Laser", which results in them firing four laser guns at once, although this only results in them firing a much larger and much slower-moving projectile.&lt;ref name=MayhemoftheMooninitesepisode/&gt; In "The Last One", the Mooninites created an even larger weapon consisting of multiple copies of themselves formed into the shape of a giant gun which they call "The Quad Glazer" (although they argue over whether it's actually called "The Quad Glacier"). The bullet fired was even more massive and seemed to not move at all, and the sheer size of the gun caused Err to break his legs under the sheer weight of the weapon.&lt;ref name=TheLastOnecite/&gt; They also have the ability to jump very high (but only on the Moon) and spin around in place flashing bright colors.&lt;ref name=MayhemoftheMooninitesepisode/&gt;

Little is known about their family lives, however, it's revealed that both Ignignokt and Err come from broken homes and neither had a father in their lives while growing up. Err went on to explain that his father was an alcoholic who abandoned him when he was three, and his mother later abandoned him at a summer camp, causing him to slip into a deep depression, and his frequent bad behavior is a desperate cry for attention. Ignignokt didn’t go into as much detail but did express some sorrow that he didn’t learn to "steal or drink the right way" from his father.&lt;ref name=Moonajuana/&gt; In "Remooned" it is revealed Ignignokt has an uncle named Cliff, who suffers from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] as a result of serving in the "Lunar Wars" and requires [[home care]] as a result.&lt;ref name=Remoonedcite/&gt;

==Characters==
The Mooninites were both created and designed by series creators [[Dave Willis]] and [[Matt Maiellaro]] and first appeared in the ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force'' [[Aqua Teen Hunger Force (season 1)|season one]] episode "Mayhem of The Mooninites", an episode in which they were centric. The episode first aired in the [[United States]] on October 14, 2001 on [[Cartoon Network|Cartoon Network’s]] late night programming block [[Adult Swim]].&lt;ref name=IgnignoktGuide&gt;[http://wiki.adultswim.com/xwiki/bin/Aqua+Teen+Hunger+Force/Ignignokt Ignignokt official character guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107030751/http://wiki.adultswim.com/xwiki/bin/Aqua+Teen+Hunger+Force/Ignignokt |date=2014-01-07 }} from [[Adult Swim]].

(archive)&lt;/ref&gt; Willis himself provides the voice of Ignignokt and Err is voiced by Maiellaro, whose voice is digitally altered for the role.&lt;ref name=MayhemoftheMooninitecommentary&gt;DVD [[audio commentary]] for the ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force'' episode "Mayhem of the Mooninites", which appears on the ''Volume One'' DVD set on November 18, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; When appearing in the series Err is never written into the script as all of his dialog and actions are completely [[Improvisation|improvised]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mediamikes.com/2012/07/aqua-teen-hunger-force-co-creator-matt-maiellaro-chats-about-new-season/|title="Aqua Teen Hunger Force" co-creator Matt Maiellaro chats about new season|author=Mike Gencarelli|publisher=Media Mikes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The duo were originally created as [[ghost]]s from the 1982 video game ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (video game)|E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', an [[Atari, Inc.|Atari]] video game adaption to the science fiction [[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial|film of the same name]]. The protagonists house was to be revealed to be built on top an ancient Indian burial ground filled with old copies of the game. This premise was based on the [[Atari video game burial]], when a surplus of over a million copies of the game, along with several other Atari games, were buried underground in [[New Mexico]] in 1983.&lt;ref name=MayhemoftheMooninitecommentary/&gt; They are both [[recurring character]]s of the series, who both have appeared more than any other characters besides the main protagonists. They are usually the main focus in the episodes where they appear, and also make several brief cameos in certain episodes as well. A person from [[standards and practices]] at the network originally saw issue with Ignignokt and Err smoking [[cigarette]]s, Willis and Maiellaro argued that they are negative characters and that them smoking would depict smoking cigarettes as a negative action. Willis and Maiellaro claimed that they would remove the smoking cigarettes aspect of the characters from the script, however, never followed through on their claim.&lt;ref name=MayhemoftheMooninitecommentary/&gt;

===Design===
The Mooninites appear as [[Two-dimensional space|two dimensional]] pixelated figures with crude eyes, eyebrows, mouths, arms and legs, all composed from basic blue rectangles.&lt;ref name=IGNTen&gt;{{cite web|title=Aqua Teen Hunger Force's Top Villains Our Top 10 favorite Aqua Teen enemies.|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/04/13/aqua-teen-hunger-forces-top-villains|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=13 April 2007|accessdate=11 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither Ignignokt nor Err can open their mouths to speak but rather the size of the rectangle used for their mouths changes size to the rhythm of what they are saying. Ignignokt is colored with a solid shade of light green, and significantly larger than Err and has on somewhat more complex shape with several perfectly symmetrical grooves across his head.&lt;ref name=IgnignoktGuide/&gt; Err is light purple and square shaped with a second rectangle on his head, which fits perfectly in the groove on Ignignokt's head, which is used to form the Quad Laser and the Quad Glacier.&lt;ref name=MayhemoftheMooninitesepisode&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Mayhem of the Mooninites |series=Aqua Teen Hunger Force |network=Adult Swim |date=October 14, 2001 |season=1 |number=4 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TheLastOnecite&gt;{{Cite episode |title=The Last One|series=Aqua Teen Hunger Force |network=Adult Swim |date=December 31, 2003 |season=2 |number=24 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ErrGuide/&gt; Neither Ignignokt or Err wear clothing on a normal basis, but can be seen wearing them on occasion.

Err’s facial expression is set as angry and is never seen to change, even during an emotional monologue about his childhood in "Moonajuana",&lt;ref name=Moonajuana&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Moonajuana |series=Aqua Teen Hunger Force|network=Adult Swim |airdate=November 26, 2006|season=4 |number=10 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Ignignokt's facial expression is predominantly set as calm and relaxed, although unlike Err his facial expression occasionally changes to express anger.&lt;ref name=Remoonedcite&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Remooned |series=Aqua Teen Hunger Force |network= Adult Swim |date=August 15, 2004 |season=3 |number=3 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ignignokt's facial expressions never skew from calm or angry, however, his plain rectangular mouth reverts to the shape of a [[smile]] briefly during the pilot episode of ''Spacecataz'', his mouth in the shape of a smile is never seen again outside of this one-time isolated appearance. In "Deleted Scenes" they are both [[Hypnosis|hypnotized]] and their eyes become spinning circular spirals, a very rare alteration of their eyes. However, their facial expressions remain the same. Ignignokt has the ability to extend the size of his middle finger, and also the ability to increase the size of his entire hand immensely in order to be more prominent when [[Finger (gesture)|giving the bird]] to Earth.&lt;ref name=Remoonedcite/&gt;&lt;ref name=RevengeoftheMooninitesepisode&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Revenge of the Mooninites |series=Aqua Teen Hunger Force |network=Adult Swim |date=May 5, 2002 |season=1 |number=8 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Spacecataz'' spin-off pilot==
{{see also|Aqua Teen Hunger Force (season 3)}}

Both Ignignokt and Err served as the main protagonist for a ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force'' [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] entitled ''Spacecataz''. A [[pilot episode]] for the spin-off was produced, however, Adult Swim did not pick it up for a full series as executives couldn't see it going anywhere with all the characters dying towards the end of the pilot, despite the parent series having a long history of [[Canon (fiction)|non-canon]] plot twists and storylines. ''Spacecataz'' was created by Willis and Maiellaro, and intended it to begin with a five episode first season. The plot revolves around both of The Mooninites and [[List of Aqua Teen Hunger Force characters#Oglethorpe and Emory|The Plutonians]], another villainous duo featured in ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force'', having an ongoing back and forth mean-spirited string of practical jokes between each other. This follows up the hostility between both groups depicted in ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force''.&lt;ref&gt;DVD [[audio commentary]] for the ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force'' episode "Little Brittle", which appears on the ''Volume Four'' DVD set on December 6, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The pilot episode was never aired on television but was released on the ''Volume Four'' DVD set on December 6, 2005.&lt;ref name=DVDV4&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000B5XOR0 ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force'' – Volume 4 (2000)] at [[Amazon.com]]. Retrieved October 8, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The pilot was also broken down into several parts and used as [[cold open]]ings throughout the [[Aqua Teen Hunger Force (season 3)|third season]] of ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force;'' replacing short bits from [[List of Aqua Teen Hunger Force characters#Dr. Weird|Dr. Weird]] and [[List of Aqua Teen Hunger Force characters#Steve|Steve]], which were used throughout the first two seasons.

==Connection to the 2007 Boston bomb scare==
{{further information|2007 Boston bomb scare}}

[[File:ATHF LED in Cambridge.jpg|250px|thumb|right|An LED display of Ignignokt which amongst others, were placed in various locations in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] and were mistaken for bombs, causing a panic on January 31, 2007 during the [[2007 Boston bomb scare]].]]
The Mooninites were subject to National attention during the [[2007 Boston bomb scare]] on January 31, 2007. During the incident [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] displays depicting Ignignokt and Err were placed in eleven different cities:  Boston, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Atlanta, Seattle, Portland, Denver, Austin, San Francisco, and Philadelphia. In Boston, the authorities considered the LEDs suspicious, prompting the closure of major roads and waterways for investigation. [[Turner Broadcasting System]] later admitted placing the LEDs and apologized for the misunderstanding. In spite of the uproar, Berdovsky and Stevens mocked the media and critics in interviews while facing charges for "placing a hoax device and disorderly conduct".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6319211.stm|title=Probe into Boston ad stunt chaos|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=February 1, 2007|date=February 1, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070202094028/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6319211.stm| archivedate= February 2, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, all criminal charges were dropped in exchange for Berdovsky and Stevens apologizing during their court date  and accepting a plea bargain which consisted of community service at the Spaulding Rehabilitation Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.boston.com/news/globe/city_region/breaking_news/2007/05/defendants_in_c.html|title=Community service for defendants in Cartoon Network case|work=Boston.com: ''Boston Globe'' website|date=May 11, 2007|accessdate=February 4, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081227062547/http://www.boston.com/news/globe/city_region/breaking_news/2007/05/defendants_in_c.html| archivedate= December 27, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turner Broadcasting has paid the [[Boston Police Department]] one million dollars to cover the investigation's cost and an additional million for good will.&lt;ref name="resign"&gt;{{cite news|author=Associated Press|title=Turner, 2nd firm to pay $2 million over scare| date=February 5, 2007|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16990202/|accessdate=December 19, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071227140251/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16990202/| archivedate= December 27, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=2863647|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403040220/http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=2863647|archivedate=April 3, 2007|title=Cartoon Network Head Resigns After Scare|publisher=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=February 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This action was designed to settle criminal and civil claims, while the general manager of Cartoon Network stepped down because of the incident. Of the 10 cities in which the [[Lite-Brite]]-like LED displays were placed, only Boston saw them as a matter of concern.

Willis and Maiellaro responded to the incident by satirizing it in an episode entitled "Boston", the episode was meant to serve as the premiere of the [[Aqua Teen Hunger Force (season 5)|fifth season]] in 2008 but was pulled by Turner Legal to avoid further controversy surrounding the incident. Subsequently, “Boston” has never been aired on television or formally released to the public in any format legally.&lt;ref name=Bostonepisodeinterview&gt;{{cite web|title=Exclusive Interview With Meatwad, Er, Dave Willis, Of 'Aqua Teen Hunger Force'|url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/Dee_Doyle/2008/12/15/starpulse_com_exclusive_interview_with_d|publisher=Star Pulse|accessdate=April 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Willis and  Maiellaro also worked a stealthily hidden image of Err dressed as [[Osama bin Laden]] onto the artwork for  the ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force Volume Five'' [[DVD]] set.&lt;ref&gt;Cover art for the ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force Volume Five'' [[DVD]] set released by [[Adult Swim]] and [[Warner Home Video]] on January 29, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Eric Goldman and Dan Iverson of [[IGN]] have listed The Mooninites as number one on their list of top ten villains featured in the series. They stated that the extremely slow speed of the laser was “hysterical” and said it was only topped by their battlecry of “Mooninites, Unite!”. They also credited the duo for several lines they contributed to the series and claimed that Ignignokt and Err’s debut episode, “Mayhem of The Mooninites”, as one of the best thought the series.&lt;ref name=IGNTen/&gt;

==In other media==
Ignignokt and Err both make appearances together in ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters]]'', a 2007 feature film based on the series and the video game ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force Zombie Ninja Pro-Am]]''.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force Zombie Ninja Pro-Am]] |developer= [[Creat Studios]] |publisher= [[Midway Games]] |date= November 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also make a non-speaking visual appearance in the [[music video]] “I Like Your Booty But I’m Not Gay”."&lt;ref&gt;“I Like Your Booty But I’m Not Gay" [[music]] video released on [[iTunes]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from their appearances in anything related to ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force'' or ''Spacecataz'' The Mooninites have also made a few brief cameos in other media. A hidden image of Ignignokt can be seen on a bathroom stall in the Adult Swim online flash game ''Five Minutes to Kill (Yourself) Family Reunion''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=Five Minutes to Kill (Yourself): Wedding Day|developer= Ham in the Fridge |publisher= [[Adult Swim]] |date= November 2009 |scene= On the men's bathroom wall }}&lt;/ref&gt; An animated interpretation of [[T-Pain]], who was voiced by himself, is seen wearing a necklace of Ignignokt in the ''[[Squidbillies]]'' season five episode "Asbestos I Can".&lt;ref name="AsbestosICan"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Asbestos I Can|series=[[Squidbillies]] |network=Adult Swim |airdate=September 11, 2011|season=6 |number=1 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anthony Thomas "Tony" DeBlois''' is a blind American [[autistic savant]] and musician.

==Early life==
Tony DeBlois was born on January 22, 1974. Weighing less than two pounds, he was premature and had to be supplied with large amounts of oxygen. Large amounts of oxygen cause blindness, and the physicians during this time were unaware of this. Consequently, Tony became blind at just a few days old. He began to play piano at the age of two. At first, DeBlois studied in the Texas School for the Blind in Austin, Texas, then the Perkins School for the Blind in Boston, Massachusetts, but in 1989 was awarded a summer scholarship at Berklee College of Music in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. Later, he was admitted as a full-time student and graduated [[magna cum laude]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisconsinmedicalsociety.org/savant_syndrome/savant_profiles/tony_deblois|title=Tony DeBlois - A Prodigious Musical Savant|publisher=Wisconsin Medical Society|author=Treffert, Darold|accessdate=2007-11-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626002913/http://www.wisconsinmedicalsociety.org/savant_syndrome/savant_profiles/tony_deblois|archivedate=2010-06-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
DeBlois specializes in jazz but can play just about any other type of music as well. A savant, he plays 20 musical instruments and has held concerts worldwide but also has his own band, Goodnuf. He can play about 8,000 pieces from memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://listverse.com/2013/07/23/10-fascinating-people-with-savant-syndrome/|title=10 Fascinating People With Savant Syndrome|work=Listverse|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A TV movie was made on Tony DeBlois' life, entitled "Journey of the Heart" (1997) starring [[Cybill Shepherd]] as Janice DeBlois, Jeremy Lelliott / Chris Demetral (as young Tony), Blake Heron as Tony's younger brother Ray, and with an appearance of Tony DeBlois  himself playing piano at the end of the movie.  It was produced by Ronnie D. Clemmer 	and Richard P. Kughn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119421/|title=Journey of the Heart (TV Movie 1997)|date=2 March 1997|work=IMDb|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ventura Blanco Encalada (2).jpg|thumb|Ventura Blanco Encalada (2)]]
'''Ventura Blanco y Calvo de Encalada''' (c. 1782 – June 19, 1856) was a [[Chile]]an [[political figure]]. 

Blanco Encalada was born in [[Sucre|Chuquisaca]], [[Bolivia]], the son of Manuel Lorenzo Blanco Cicerón and of Mercedes Calvo de Encalada y Recabarren (a Spanish father and a Chilean mother). He was trained for the Army in [[Spain]], where he became a ''Guard de Corps'' and a lieutenant in the ''Regimiento de Dragones de Sangunto''.  During the [[Peninsular War]], he supported [[Joseph Bonaparte]] and eventually was forced to emigrate to [[France]]. He returned to Buenos Aires in 1816, and moved to Chile in 1820, where his younger brother [[Manuel Blanco Encalada|Manuel]] was an important political figure who went on to become its [[President of Chile|first President]].

In 1826, President [[Ramón Freire]] named him [[Ministry of the Interior (Chile)#Ministers of Government and Foreign Affairs|Minister of Government and Foreign Affairs]] and in 1827,  Vice President [[Francisco Antonio Pinto]] named him [[Ministry of Finance of Chile|Secretary of Treasury]]. After the defeat of the liberals in the [[Chilean Civil War of 1829]], he retired from politics. Blanco Encalada spent his last years teaching at the [[Universidad de Chile]], where he became [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of the School of Humanities.

'''William Henry Drew''' (1854 - 29 January 1933) was a British textile worker, early trade unionist and one of the founders of the [[Independent Labour Party]].

==Early years==
W. H. Drew was born in [[Exeter]] in 1854 and by the mid-1860s was working in agriculture. He began to be increasingly interested in politics at around the time that [[John Coleridge, 1st Baron Coleridge|John Duke Coleridge QC]] was contesting Exeter for the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]].&lt;ref name="dlb"&gt;Keith Laybourn and John Saville, "Drew, William Henry (Harry)", ''Dictionary of Labour Biography'', vol.IV, pp.75&amp;ndash;77&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1862 Drew migrated to [[Jarrow]] then on to [[Shipley, West Yorkshire|Shipley]] where he began work as a wool comber at Pricking Mill. Next he started work as a workhouse man at Airedale Mills and then as a [[worsted]] weaver. By 1887 he was an active organiser for the [[West Riding Power Looms Weavers' Association]] and was on the executive committee for the next twenty years.&lt;ref name="dlb" /&gt;

==Trade unionist==
Around this time Drew became a pioneer of independent labour politics and textile trade unionism. Along with [[Allen Gee]] and [[Ben Turner (journalist)|Ben Turner]] he was recruited by the ''[[Yorkshire Factory Times]]'' in 1889 as a correspondent. In December 1890, the workers at the [[Manningham Mills]] went on strike. Drew, Gee and Turner provided leadership for the strikers and the strike gave a new impetus to trade unionism and a reinvigorated hope for independent political action. The strike may have failed in its primary objectives but after it had finished, the [[Bradford Labour Union]] was established. This in turn led to the founding of the [[Independent Labour Party]] in 1893, with Drew chairing its founding conference, held in Bradford.&lt;ref name="dlb" /&gt;

Throughout this time Drew was suffering from [[bronchitis]] and constant ill health. In 1891 he became president of the Bradford Labour Union and stood successfully for the Bradford School Board and in 1892 he gave evidence to the [[Royal Commission]] on Labour. By 1893, Drew’s importance to the labour movement was very much recognised. At the inaugural conference of the Independent Labour Party in Bradford, Drew was selected to take the chair at the conference although, when it was taken to a vote, [[Keir Hardie]] was elected chairman. Drew was however, unanimously elected as vice chairman.&lt;ref name="dlb" /&gt;

By the mid-1890s Drew had helped found the Bradford Central Labour Club of which he became the President only to resign in 1895 due to a change of rules which allowed non-union members to hold office. In 1893 the Bradford Unemployed Emergency Committee was established, Drew being a leading member. This organisation united the Independent Labour Party, the [[Bradford Trades Council]] and the Social Reform Union. He encouraged this organisation to conduct its own survey of unemployment which firmly discredited the statements put out by the Bradford Board of Guardians.&lt;ref name="dlb" /&gt;

Having been on the trades council since 1887, he became secretary in 1898, following the departure of James Bartley. Ben Turner stated on his work, ''"He put the Trades Council on to its wider basis.  He paved the way."''&lt;ref name="dlb" /&gt;

On the education act of 1902 he showed fierce opposition and in 1907 left for Canada, returning to Bradford and dying on 29 January 1933.&lt;ref name="dlb" /&gt;

Her participation in the event marked the first time a rider from the Central America and the Caribbean competed in the global event.

In July 2018, she won two individual gold medals at the Central American and Caribbean Games held in Colombia, and also won a team a team silver as the anchor rider for the Dominican Republic national team. At the event she rode Fredensdals Zig Zag, a Danish warmblood owned by Kathy Priest.

Although she had qualified for the 2018 World Equestrian Games with two horses, a shoulder injury prevented her from participating, forcing a two-month layoff from riding altogether.

During the winter show season, she competes in the dressage shows held in [[Wellington, Florida]].&lt;ref name=profile&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080515160219/http://horsesdaily.com/whoswho/muniz_yvonne/index.html Profile]&lt;/ref&gt;
