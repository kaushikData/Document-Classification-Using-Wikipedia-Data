==Uses==
The stadium is primarily used for [[baseball]], as the home field of the [[Hudson Valley Renegades]] [[minor league]] baseball team, the short season-A level team of the [[Tampa Bay Rays]]. Each April the stadium hosts the Hudson Valley Baseball Classic between [[Marist Red Foxes|Marist College]] and the [[Army Black Knights|United States Military Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=WRWD Hudson Valley Baseball Classic Set For April 24|url=http://www.goarmysports.com/sports/m-basebl/spec-rel/040913aaa.html|publisher=Army Athletics|date=April 9, 2013|accessdate=June 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Besides baseball it is also used for weddings, catered events and concerts.  The stadium hosts K104's annual KFest concert held in early June, as well as a rock concert, usually held in late August. Performing artists have included [[Akon]], [[Rihanna]], [[Fat Joe]], [[Counting Crows]], [[Collective Soul]], [[Wilco]], [[Def Leppard]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]] and [[Adam Lambert]], among others.

On July 15, 2014, it was announced that [[Manhattan College]]'s baseball team will play all of their home competitions at Dutchess Stadium &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Baseball to Play 2015 Home Games at Dutchess Stadium|url=http://www.gojaspers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=52438&amp;SPID=5435&amp;DB_LANG=C&amp;ATCLID=209577623&amp;DB_OEM_ID=12500|publisher=Manhattan College Athletics|date=July 15, 2014|accessdate=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium's first [[American football|football]] tenant, the [[Hudson Valley Fort]] of the [[Fall Experimental Football League]], took up residence in the stadium in October 2015.&lt;ref name="vindy716"&gt;{{cite news|title=Brawlers will be part of FXFL|url=http://www.vindy.com/news/2015/jul/16/fxfl-makes-things-official/|accessdate=July 16, 2015|work=Vindy.com|publisher=The Vindicator|date=July 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[high school football]] playoff contests were also to be held at the stadium that year, but the stadium was later determined to be unsafe as a football venue and those games were canceled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/story/sports/2015/11/04/hudson-valley-forts-season-finale-cancelled/75183060/?from=global&amp;sessionKey=&amp;autologin=|title=Hudson Valley Fort's season finale canceled|last=Haynes|first=Stephen|date=November 4, 2015|accessdate=November 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The entire field, excluding the pitchers mound and home plate area, was converted to [[Astro-Turf]] in the spring of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Dutchess Stadium Turf Thrills Hudson Valley Renegades|first=Sean T.|last=McMann|url=http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/article/20140405/SPORTS03/140402014/|newspaper=[[Poughkeepsie Journal]]|date=April 5, 2014|accessdate=June 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Etoile Haïtienne appeared in its first championship in 1942 against longer established [[Racing Club Haïtien]], another club in [[Port-au-Prince]].{{refn|group=note|According to the Rec Sport Soccer Statistics Foundation, rsssf.com, cup matches were played throughout the country, but the national championships were restricted to top-level clubs from Port-au-Prince only, and a few surrounding areas within. It wasn't until 1988, that the national championship was fully integrated in to league format outside of the capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Haiti – List of Champions |publisher=RSSSF |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesh/haitichamp.html |accessdate=17 April 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304024733/http://www.rsssf.com/tablesh/haitichamp.html |archivedate=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Down 3–0 at halftime and less than ten minutes after Racing's last goal, [[Joe Gaetjens]] rebounded and scored to break the shutout. At the 53rd minute, Fritz Joseph scores. Seven minutes remaining, Frérot Rouzier scores the tying goal equalizing the match at 3–3. At the final minutes of regulation, a defiant Gaetjens kept on the attack, breaking the tie at 3–4, which ended up being the game-winner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LVbRAQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Shot Heard Around the World: The Joe Gaetjens Story |author=Gaetjens, Lesly |pages=1, 3–4, 16, 24 |year=2010 |isbn=9780557612314 |accessdate=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1942/43"&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesh/haiti43.html RSSSF – Haiti 1942/43]&lt;/ref&gt; To this day, Racing Club Haïtien refuses to play matches on the "[[Maundy Thursday|Jeudi Saint]]" (''Holy Thursday''); the day of ''washing of the feet.''&lt;ref name="1942/43"/&gt;

In [[Major League Baseball]], the '''general manager''' ('''GM''') of a team typically controls player transactions and bears the primary responsibility on behalf of the ballclub during contract discussions with players.

The [[general manager (sports)|general manager]] is also normally the person who hires and fires the coaching staff, including the [[Manager (baseball)|field manager]] who acts as the head coach.  In baseball, the term ''manager'' used without qualification almost always refers to the field manager, not the general manager.

Before the 1960s, and in some rare cases today, a person with the general manager title in sports has also borne responsibility for the non-player operations of the ballclub, such as ballpark administration and [[sportscasting|broadcasting]].  [[Ed Barrow]], [[George Weiss (baseball)|George Weiss]] and [[Gabe Paul]] were three baseball GMs noted for their administrative skills in both player and non-player duties.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

'''George Leer''' (1748 at [[Hambledon, Hampshire]] – 1 February 1812 at [[Petersfield, Hampshire]]) was a famous English [[cricket]]er who played for [[Hampshire county cricket teams|Hampshire]] in the time of the [[Hambledon Club]].

Leer began playing in the 1760s.  His name has become almost synonymous with the now archaic long stop fielding position (i.e., directly behind the wicket-keeper) that was deemed so necessary in underarm days.

According to [[Arthur Haygarth]], Leer "was a good and successful bat, but was mostly famous as long-stop to [[Thomas Brett (cricketer)|Thomas Brett]]’s tremendous bowling in the Hambledon matches.  He was always called "Little George", and was a fine singer, having a sweet counter-tenor voice.&lt;ref name=S&amp;B&gt;[[Arthur Haygarth]], ''Scores &amp; Biographies'', Volume 1 (1744-1826), Lillywhite, 1862&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[John Nyren]]’s book, he is stated to have been a native of Hambledon, but latterly he was a brewer, residing at Petersfield, where he died".&lt;ref name=JN&gt;[[Ashley Mote]], ''John Nyren's "The Cricketers of my Time"'', Robson, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

George Leer was a small man who made 44 known first-class appearances from the [[1772 English cricket season|1772 season]] to 1782.

The '''Gerald Ratner Athletics Center''' is a $51 million athletics facility within the [[University of Chicago]] campus in the [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]] on the [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side]] of [[Chicago]], Illinois in the United States. The building was named after University of Chicago alumnus, [[Gerald Ratner (lawyer)|Gerald Ratner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20140620/NEWS04/130909947/lawyer-gerald-ratner-dies-at-100-crown-family-adviser-u-of-c-donor# |title=Crain's Chicago Business : Subscription Center |publisher=Chicagobusiness.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The architect of this suspension structure that is supported by [[Wikt:mast|mast]]s, [[Wire rope|cables]] and [[counterweight]]s was [[César Pelli]], who is best known as the architect of the [[Petronas Towers]].

The Ratner Athletics Center was approved for use in September 2003. The facility includes, among other things: a competition [[gym]]nasium, a multilevel fitness facility, an Olympic-sized [[swimming pool]], a multipurpose [[dance studio]], meeting room space, and athletic department offices.  It serves as home to several of the university's athletic teams and has hosted numerous [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]] regional and [[University Athletic Association]] conference championship events.

Located at the southwest corner of Ellis Avenue and 55th Street, the Ratner Center has an award-winning design that substitutes a complex external mast and [[counterweight]] system for interior support devices to allow for large open-space areas inside the building. Cesar Pelli &amp; Associates Inc. was credited as the design architect and OWP/P was the architect of record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.risatech.com/showcase/msc/EAE2004/EAEAwards_RatnerAthleticsCenter.pdf|title=Gerald Ratner Athletics Center|accessdate=2010-05-02|work=[[Modern Steel Construction]]|date=April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building is complemented at the University by its predecessors the [[Henry Crown Field House]] and the modern incarnation of [[Stagg Field]], which will continue to augment the athletic facilities needs of the campus patrons. Features of the indoor Henry Crown Field House include a 200-meter indoor running track; [[racquetball]], [[American handball|handball]] and [[Squash (sport)|squash]] courts; multipurpose courts; a multipurpose room; and cardiovascular and weight training equipment. The Stagg Field outdoor complex includes a 400-meter track, eight [[tennis courts]], and fields for [[baseball]], [[softball]], [[American football]] and [[soccer]].&lt;ref name=RwodtUcoM&gt;{{cite news|url=http://chronicle.uchicago.edu/030925/ratner.shtml|title=Ratner will open doors to University community on Monday |volume=23|issue=1|accessdate=2010-05-05|date=2003-09-25|work=[[Chicago Chronicle]]|author=Hilbert, Dave}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The roof design incorporated multi-level splayed cables so that the structural roof members could form a {{convert|33|in|cm|1|adj=on}} deep uniformly curved roof plane.
The roof members are curved and shallow.  They support 7 {{convert|2|in|cm|1|adj=on}} thick {{convert|25|ft|m|1|adj=on}} metal roof deck spans between the roof girders.  The W33x169 girders are cold bent with reverse curves to multiple radii. The curved roof planes are suspended from German "full-lock" steel cables and include three outer layers of interlocking Z-shaped wires designed to minimize water infiltration and corrosion.&lt;ref name=GRACSM/&gt;

The engineering of the masts was complicated because stability was so important to the overall design success of the suspension structure.  Mast displacements could significantly alter cable length and tension and redistribute loads through the superstructure contrary to design.  The key to successful design was control of the [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]] settlement.  The sites natural underlying subsurface conditions were stiff silty [[clay]] below a medium dense sand layer, which was determined to be too accommodating to settlement to host the structure.  Ground improvement, consisting of triple-fluid jet grouting, was performed to reduce the compressibility of the silty clay, stiffen the sand deposit and provide a desirable shallow foundation system.&lt;ref name=JGCiMPtCFSGRAC/&gt;  This site marked the first time that these geotechnical ground improvement techniques were employed.&lt;ref name=UoCGRACCI/&gt;

The '''Hardwicke Stakes''' is a [[Group races|Group 2]] [[Flat racing|flat]] [[Horse racing|horse race]] in Great Britain open to horses aged four years or older. It is run at [[Ascot Racecourse|Ascot]] over a distance of 1 mile 3 furlongs and 211 yards (2,406 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in June.

==History==
The event is named in honour of the [[Charles Yorke, 5th Earl of Hardwicke|5th Earl of Hardwicke]], who served as the [[Master of the Buckhounds]] in the 19th century. It was established in 1879, and it was originally open to horses aged three or older. The last three-year-old to win was Helioscope in 1949.

The Hardwicke Stakes is now held on the final day of the five-day Royal Ascot meeting. The leading horses often return to the venue to compete in the following month's [[King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes]]. The first to win both races in the same year was [[Aureole (horse)|Aureole]] in 1954, and the most recent was [[Harbinger (horse)|Harbinger]] in 2010.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1954">'''Keg-tossing''' (or '''keg toss''') is a [[sport]] that involves the heaving of a standard 15.5 gallon beer [[keg]]. Most people would refer to this type of keg as a "half-keg" or "half-barrel." The keg must be completely emptied before it should be tossed to avoid injuries. There are many different types of keg-tossing, as it is practiced throughout the world. In [[Ireland]], the keg is typically thrown over upwards and the height of the toss determines the winner.

The newest way to toss a keg combines techniques of both the discus and [[hammer throw]]. This updated form of keg-tossing does not require the athlete to toss the keg high, rather they are required to try to throw it the farthest distance. Athletes are given three attempts to throw the keg and the winner is determined by measuring the distance tossed. The one who throws the keg the furthest wins.

The basic technique for tossing the keg involves swinging the keg in a pendulum like manner and releasing the keg when it is at its apex. A more experienced athlete uses a spin method similar to a hammer throw. The keg is again released when it is at its apex, allowing for the maximum distance.

==Strongman competitions==
In competitive [[strongman (strength athlete)|strongman]] competitions, such as at the [[World's Strongest Man]] competition, competitors throw kegs of increasing weights, and the keg is generally thrown overhead and to the rear of the thrower, and must be thrown over the top of a high bar. The competitors are scored based on how many kegs they can throw over the bar in the least amount of time. In this category, the world record is held by [[Brian Shaw (strongman)|Brian Shaw]] who threw a 15&amp;nbsp;kg keg over a 7.25&amp;nbsp;m bar in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://theworldsstrongestman.com/commerce-worlds-strongest-man-2016-roundup/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Liga III''' is the third-level [[women's association football|women's football]] league in [[Romania]]. It was created starting with the 2016–17 season, when it formally received the name ''Liga II'', following the introduction of ''Superliga'' as the top-tier league, and the subsequent relegation of ''Liga I'' to second-tier. However, as of the 2017–18 season, it was rebranded as ''Liga III'', since the ''Superliga'' brand was dropped altogether, and subsequently ''Liga I'' became the top league, and ''Liga II'' the second.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.frfotbal.ro/index.php?competition_id=98&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
In its first season, it had only one series. From the 2017–18 season, two series were played.

==Winners==
The following is a list of all Romanian women's third-tier football league winners. The first place is declared the champion of the series, is slated for promotion to Liga II, and is presented with a trophy. Second teams of clubs cannot be promoted if the first team of the club is in the next higher tier. The promoted teams in each series for every year are denoted in italics. Because it is the lowest level in the Romanian Football League, there is no formal relegation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="93015">The [[Gentlemen v Players]] [[first-class cricket]] fixture was first played in 1806 and, despite many difficulties in the early years, it had by 1840 become an established annual event in the [[Cricket in England|English cricket calendar]]. Apart from the years of the two World Wars, it remained so until 1962. The purpose of the fixture was to match the best of the [[amateur status in first-class cricket|amateur cricketers]] (the [[Gentlemen cricket team|Gentlemen]]) against the best of the paid professionals (the [[Players cricket team|Players]]). The table below summarises the full career record in the fixture of everyone who made their debuts for the Gentlemen team in the matches played to 1840.

==Key==
* '''club''' denotes the player's usual team when he represented the Gentlemen (most at the time were MCC members).
* '''debut''' denotes the year of the player's debut appearance for the Gentlemen.
* '''final''' denotes the year of the player's final appearance for the Gentlemen.
* '''M''' denotes the number of '''matches''' in which the player represented the Gentlemen.
* '''runs''' denotes the total number of [[run (cricket)|runs]] scored by the player in all his matches for the Gentlemen.
* '''HS''' denotes the '''highest score''' made by the player in one [[innings]] when [[batting (cricket)|batting]] for the Gentlemen (* signifies [[not out]]).
* '''wkts''' denotes the total number of [[wicket]]s taken by the player in all his matches for the Gentlemen.
* '''BB''' denotes the '''best [[bowling (cricket)|bowling]]''' performance by the player in one innings for the Gentlemen (e.g., 3–30 means he took 3 wickets in the innings and conceded 30 runs;  to 1840, runs conceded by bowlers are usually unknown, hence "?").
* players are initially listed according to the date of their debut for the Gentlemen.
* players in '''bold''' were '''known professionals''' who represented the Gentlemen as "given men" in order to handicap the Players.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7315">'''Manchester Cricket Club''' was founded in 1816 and was a direct forerunner of [[Lancashire County Cricket Club]], founded in 1864. Manchester had [[First-class cricket#Important matches classification|important match status]] and is classified as such by substantial sources from 1844 to 1864, after which it was superseded by the county club and ceased to be an important team in its own right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=ACS |first= |authorlink=Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians |title=A Guide to Important Cricket Matches Played in the British Isles 1709 – 1863|year=1981 |publisher=ACS |location=Nottingham |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=ACS |first= |authorlink=Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians |title=A Guide to First-Class Cricket Matches Played in the British Isles |year=1982 |publisher=ACS |location=Nottingham |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Cricket may not have reached [[Lancashire]] until the 18th century. The earliest known reference to cricket being played in the county is in 1781.&lt;ref&gt;Bowen, p.266.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1816, Manchester Cricket Club was founded and soon became representative of Lancashire as a county in the same way that [[Sheffield Cricket Club]] and [[Nottingham Cricket Club]] represented [[Yorkshire]] and [[Nottinghamshire]].

Manchester played mostly against opponents from the north of England and its matches from July 1844 until 1864 (including some in which the team was styled "Lancashire") have important status per the ACS classification. Ten of these were against Sheffield, who in three of them were called Yorkshire. Other opponents included [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]], [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]] and [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC). On 23, 24 &amp; 25 July 1849, the Sheffield and Manchester clubs played each other at the [[Hyde Park Ground]] in [[Sheffield]] and the fixture was called "Yorkshire ''versus'' Lancashire". As such, it was the first match to involve a Lancashire county team and also, therefore, the first "[[Roses Match]]". Yorkshire won by 5 wickets.

A noted Manchester player was [[John Sherman (cricketer)|John Sherman]]. On 27 July 1852, he made his final top-class appearance for Manchester against Sheffield at the Hyde Park Ground. His career had spanned 44 seasons from his debut at [[Lord's Old Ground]] on 20 September 1809 when he played for Beauclerk's XI against Ladbroke's XI. His was the longest career span, equalled only by [[W. G. Grace]].

In their early years, the club played their cricket on land adjacent to the [[Manchester Botanical Garden]] and leased from the [[de Trafford baronets|Trafford family]]. In 1856, [[Sir Humphrey de Trafford]] identified this land as being an ideal location for the planned [[Art Treasures Exhibition, Manchester 1857|Manchester Art and Treasures Exhibition]]. Sir Humphrey was a member of the Executive Committee planning the exhibition who offered Manchester Cricket Club £500 in compensation for the remainder of their lease. The club, however, insisted on a figure of £1,000 and agreed to vacate the site ahead of the 1857 season, moving to the inferior location (as it was further from transport links and only accessible via a long rough track) that subsequently became [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground]], the home of Lancashire cricket ever since. 

[[Lancashire County Cricket Club]] was formally constituted on 12 January 1864 at a meeting of thirteen Lancashire cricket clubs in Manchester. In 1865, the new club joined the [[County Championship]] and played its initial [[First-class cricket#Important matches classification|important match]] against [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]] at Old Trafford on 20, 21 and 22 July. The Manchester club was superseded by the county club and ceased to have [[First-class cricket#Important matches classification|important match status]] in its own right.

[[File:Modern Pentathlon Logo.jpg|thumb|UIPM Modern Pentathlon logo]]
The '''modern pentathlon''' is an [[Summer Olympics|Olympic]] sport that comprises five different events; [[fencing (sport)|fencing]] (one-touch épée), [[freestyle swimming]] (200m), equestrian [[show jumping]] (15 jumps), and a final combined event of [[pistol shooting]] and [[cross country running]] (3200m). This last event is now referred to as the laser-run, since it alternates four legs of laser pistol shooting followed by an 800m run (for 3200m in total). The event is inspired by the [[Ancient Olympic pentathlon|traditional pentathlon]] held during the ancient Olympics; as the original events were patterned on the skills needed by an ideal Greek soldier of the era, the modern pentathlon is similarly patterned on events representing the skills needed by cavalry behind enemy lines.

The sport has been a core sport of the Olympic Games since 1912 despite attempts to remove it.&lt;ref name="ioc-planning"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thesportjournal.org/article/special-edition-sport-journal-ioc-planning-drop-modern-pentathlon-olympic-games |title=Special Edition: Refuting IOC's Plan to End Modern Pentathlon Competition |last= |first= |date=Fall 2002 |work=The Sport Journal |accessdate=2012-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120605032621/http://thesportjournal.org/article/special-edition-sport-journal-ioc-planning-drop-modern-pentathlon-olympic-games |archivedate=2012-06-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A world championships for modern pentathlon has been held annually since 1949.

Originally the competition took place over four or five days; [[Modern pentathlon at the 1996 Summer Olympics|in 1996]] a one-day format was adopted in an effort to be more audience-friendly.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; Modern pentathlon, despite its long Olympic history, has had to justify its inclusion in the modern Olympic Games several times. On February 11, 2013 in Lausanne, the IOC confirmed modern pentathlon once again as one of the 25 core sports of the Olympic program through to 2020. The governing body, [[Union Internationale de Pentathlon Moderne]] (UIPM), administers the international sport in more than 90 countries in all the continents of the world.&lt;ref name="ioc-planning"/&gt;

==History==
The foundation of the modern pentathlon is disputed. On the one hand, Baron [[Pierre de Coubertin]], the founder of the [[Olympic Games|modern Olympic Games]], claimed authorship.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;
{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/27/sports/olympics/27pentathlon.html?_r=1&amp;scp=4&amp;sq=%22John%20Branch%22&amp;st=cse |title=Modern Pentathlon Gets a Little Less Penta  |last=Branch |first=John |date=November 26, 2008 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2008-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[Viktor Balck]], the President of the Organizing Committee for the 1912 Games, showed that he made use of the long tradition of Swedish military multi-sports events, to create a manageable modern pentathlon.&lt;ref&gt;Sandra Heck: Von Spielenden Soldaten und kämpfenden Athleten. Die Genese des Modernen Fünfkampfes. Göttingen: V &amp; R Unipress. 2013, {{ISBN|978-3-8471-0201-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The name derives from the Greek ''péntathlon'' "contest of five events".&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; The addition of ''modern'' to the name distinguishes it from the [[Ancient Olympic pentathlon|original pentathlon]] of the [[ancient Olympic Games]], which consisted of the [[Stadion (running race)|''stadion'' foot race]], [[wrestling]], [[long jump]], [[javelin throw|javelin]], and [[discus throw|discus]].  As the events of the ancient pentathlon were modeled after the skills of the ideal soldier to defend a castle of that time, Coubertin created the contest to simulate the experience of a 19th-century [[cavalry]] soldier behind enemy lines: he must ride an unfamiliar horse, fight enemies with pistol and sword, swim, and run to return to his own soldiers.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; In the 1912 Games, with only officers competing, they were, however, permitted to use their own horses. Up to the 1952 Olympics the ordinary cavalry soldier was considered a [[professional athlete]], as he was riding and training horses for a living, while the officer was the [[amateur]]. As long as there was no official international federation for Modern Pentathlon an IOC committee was set up for the sport making use of the expertise of IOC members.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnd Krüger]]: Forgotton Decisions. The IOC on the Eve of World War I, in: ''Olympika'' 6 (1997), 85 – 98. (http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/Olympika/Olympika_1997/olympika0601g.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;

The event was first held at the [[1912 Olympic Games]], and was won by Swedish athlete [[Gösta Lilliehöök]].  The modern pentathlon has been on the Olympic program continuously since 1912. A team event was added to the Olympic Games [[Modern pentathlon at the 1952 Summer Olympics|in 1952]] and discontinued [[Modern pentathlon at the 1992 Summer Olympics|in 1992]]. After much lobby work of the President of the German Modern Pentathlon Federation Prof. Wilhelm Henze, women were for the first time admitted on a trial basis at the World Championships in San Antonio in 1977, and at the official world championships in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;Uta Engels: "Now the Problem: Modern Pentathlon for Ladies." Zur Rolle Prof. Dr. Peter-Wilhem Henzes bei der Entwicklung des Modernen Frauenfünfkampfes, in:  [[Arnd Krüger]] &amp; Bernd Wedemeyer (eds.): ''Aus Biographien Sportgeschichte lernen. Festschrift zum 90. Geburtstag von Prof. Dr. Wilhelm Henze''. Hoya: Niedersächsisches Institut für Sportgeschichte 2000, S. 47 -66. {{ISBN|3-932423-07-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; An event for women was added [[Modern pentathlon at the 2000 Summer Olympics|in 2000]].&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; A World Championship is held every year. The competitions include Men and Women's Individual and Team event together with relay events for Men and Women and, since 2010, a mixed relay event.

==Competition format==
Athletes gain points for their performance in each event and scores are combined to give the overall total. This is similar to the procedure for the [[decathlon]] in [[track and field athletics]]. However, in the modern pentathlon, starting times for the last event (cross country running before 2009; combined laser pistol shooting and cross-country running since 2009),&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/olympic_games/7745671.stm Pentathlon change irks Livingston], [[BBC]], 24 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; are staggered so that the first person to cross the finish line is the winner. Before the last event competitors are ranked according to their score from the other disciplines and given start times accordingly, with the leader going first, and other starting times being dependent on the number of points already scored. The first person to cross the finish line, therefore, will be the overall points leader and win the pentathlon. This method of finishing the competition may have been inspired by similar formats in winter sports; the [[Gundersen method]], for example, details a means by which a similar finish is achieved in the [[Nordic combined]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

* The [[fencing]] discipline uses the [[épée]]. The competition is a [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]], meaning each competitor will face all the other competitors once. Each match lasts up to one minute; the first fencer to score a hit wins instantly. Double hits are not counted. If neither scores within one minute, they both lose the match.
* The swimming discipline is a 200&amp;nbsp;m [[Freestyle swimming|freestyle]] race. Until the 2000 Olympics, the distance was 300 metres.&lt;ref name="goodluck"&gt;
{{cite news |url=http://www.goodluckbeijing.com.cn/en/archives/sports/2007-03-10/2365.html |title=Modern Pentathlon |date=2007-03-10 |publisher='Good Luck Beijing' |accessdate=2008-11-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006203852/http://www.goodluckbeijing.com.cn/en/archives/sports/2007-03-10/2365.html |archivedate=2008-10-06 |df= }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Competitors are seeded in heats according to their fastest time over the distance.
* The riding discipline involves [[show jumping]] over a 350–450 m course with 12 to 15 obstacles. Competitors are paired with horses in a draw 20 minutes before the start of the event. &lt;ref group=Note&gt;This unusual skill—the riding of a random horse is also used in the US for college equestrian team competitions and in club IEA horse back riding.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, this is the only Olympic sport that awards a medal to the participating horse{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}.
* Until 2009, the shooting discipline involved using a 4.5&amp;nbsp;mm ([[Pellet (air gun)|.177 cal]]) [[air pistol]] in the standing position from 10 metres distance at a stationary target. The format was that of the [[10 metre air pistol]] competition: each competitor had 20 shots, with 40 seconds allowed for each shot. In 2009, the combined event, now referred to as the laser-run, was born. This involved a combination of the running and shooting events so that each competitor ran three 1000 m laps, each prefaced by hitting five targets with a pistol. Beginning with the Rancho Mirage World Cup (Feb 2011), the pistols  changed to a laser instead of an actual projectile.  There is a slight delay between the trigger pull and the laser firing, simulating the time it would take for a pellet to clear the muzzle.&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/five_ring_circus/2012/08/12/modern_pentathlon_2012_olympics_can_lasers_save_the_olympics_weirdest_sport_.html |title=Can Lasers Save the Modern Pentathlon? |date=2012-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The running discipline involved a 3&amp;nbsp;km [[cross country running|cross-country]] race until 2009 when it combined with the shooting event. From the start of the 2013 season, the laser-run has changed again to consist of four 800m laps each prefaced by laser shooting at five targets. This change is intended to restore some of the importance of the shooting skill felt to have been lost in the original 2009 combined event. Until the [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Olympics]], the distance was 4 kilometres.&lt;ref name="goodluck"/&gt;

The laser-run is similar to the [[biathlon]] at the [[Winter Olympic Games]], which combines [[cross-country skiing (sport)|cross-country skiing]] with [[Shooting sports#Rifle|rifle shooting]]. However, whereas biathletes carry their rifles while skiing, pentathletes do not carry their pistols while running.

The laser-run has been criticized as altering too radically the nature of the skills required. ''[[The New York Times]]'' asked whether the name ought to be changed to "tetrathlon" given that two of the five disciplines had been combined into a single event.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

In the new format, in each of the four rounds of firing, athletes have to successfully shoot five targets, loading the laser gun after each shot. They resume running once they have five successful hits, or once the maximum shooting time of 50 seconds has expired. Misses are not penalised.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pentathlon.org/images/Rules/ii%205%20combined%20event%2017%201%202012final.pdf|title=Rules for Combined Event Running and Shooting|publisher=UIPM|accessdate=2012-08-12}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new format maintains the principle that the overall winner will be the first to cross the finish line.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

'''Newport Stadium''', also known as '''Spytty Park''', is an [[association football]] and [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]] [[stadium]] in [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], [[South Wales]]. It is the home of [[Newport City F.C.|Newport City]] football club and Newport Harriers Athletic Club. It was previously also used for home matches by [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]] and [[Albion Rovers F.C. (Newport)|Albion Rovers]] football clubs. Newport County continue to use the stadium as a base for youth teams and senior squad training.

==Facilities==
The stadium is owned and managed by [[Newport City Council]] and is part of the [[Newport International Sports Village]], which includes the [[Wales National Velodrome]].

It was upgraded to [[Conference National]] standard for football and had a capacity of 5,058 prior to Newport County relocating to [[Rodney Parade]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newport-county.co.uk/stadium_details.html Stadium details] Newport County&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium can accommodate international-standard track and field athletic events and is of Class 1 standard.  The stadium floodlighting can achieve up to an average of 500 [[Lux]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newport.gov.uk/_dc/index.cfm?fuseaction=leisure.centres&amp;contentid=devxp001383 Newport Stadium at NISV] Newport City Council&lt;/ref&gt;

==Layout==
The stadium has two covered stands along the touchlines of the [[Association football pitch|pitch]]. The west stand is all-seated with a capacity of 1,100 spectators. The east stand is a 1,600-capacity covered standing [[Terrace (stadium)|terrace]], commonly referred to as ''The Shed''. An uncovered standing terrace also exists at the north end.

The stadium is approached from Spytty Road and has a large spectator car park.

==Temporary and demountable stands==
When Newport County played [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] in the [[2001–02 FA Cup]], a temporary all-seated stand was erected behind the goal at the north end in front of the terrace – at that time there was only the west stand and a very small north terrace. When Newport County played Swansea City in the [[2006–07 FA Cup]], a temporary stand was erected behind the goal at the south end.

In 2011 further all-seated uncovered demountable stands were erected behind each goal: A 949-seater stand at the south end and a 1,197-seater stand in front of the north terrace. This took the total capacity of the stadium to 5,058 with 3,246 seated.

==Football attendance records==
The record attendance at the ground without temporary stands is 4,300 (a capacity crowd at the time) against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the [[2003–04 Newport County A.F.C. season|2003–04 season]].  With the addition of a temporary stand, the record attendance stands at 4,616, set for a FA Cup match against [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] on 11 November 2006.

'''Notre Dame Stadium''' is an outdoor [[college football|football]] [[stadium]] in [[Notre Dame, Indiana|Notre Dame]], [[Indiana]], the home field of the [[University of Notre Dame]] [[Fighting Irish football|Fighting Irish]]. It is located on the university's campus and also hosts commencement.

Opened {{Years or months ago|1930|10}} on October 4, [[1930 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|1930]], the stadium [[seating capacity]] was nearly 60,000 for decades. More than 21,000 seats were added for the [[1997 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|1997]] season, which increased the capacity to over 80,000. After the Campus Crossroads renovation, the seat number decreased to 77,622. The playing surface was changed to [[FieldTurf]] in [[2014 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|2014]], after 84 seasons on natural grass.

==History==
The stadium opened its gates on October 4, 1930, replacing [[Cartier Field]]. The total cost of construction exceeded  [[United States dollar|$]]750,000 and the original [[seating capacity]] was 54,000. Head coach [[Knute Rockne]] played a key role in its design, keeping the space between the playing field and the stands to a minimum. The stadium is patterned, on a smaller scale, after [[Michigan Stadium]], the main difference being the tunnel location. In 1929, plans were started by [[Osborn Engineering]] of [[Cleveland]], selected for their experience in designing [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] and [[Fenway Park]]. The original stadium held 59,075 people, measured a half-mile (800 m) in circumference, stood {{convert|45|ft|0}} high, and featured a glass-enclosed press box rising {{convert|60|ft|0}} above ground level. Initial stands reached 55 rows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stadiumdb.com/news/2015/09/new_stadiums_old_gray_lady_and_others|title=New stadiums: Old Gray Lady and others – StadiumDB.com|author=|date=|website=stadiumdb.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925161556/http://stadiumdb.com/news/2015/09/new_stadiums_old_gray_lady_and_others|archivedate=2015-09-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building was built by the Sollitt Construction Company of South Bend. Earth preparation began in the fall of 1929, but due to an unusually cold fall and winter, above ground construction did not begin until April 2, 1930.  This building was effectively built in six months. Over two million bricks were used in the construction of the walls and the concrete was placed in a monolithic continuous placement by section.  There were over 300 workers on the site at most times and they worked five 10-hour days and one six-hour day on Saturdays. The average worker was paid one dollar a day plus lunch with the more skilled workers earning up to five dollars a day.&lt;ref&gt;Notre Dame archives&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Stadium, Notre Dame, Indiana (63329).jpg|left|thumbnail|Notre Dame stadium between circa 1930 and 1945]]
The construction of the stadium project was brought to a head by the actions of Knute Rockne. The 1928 &lt;!--[[1928 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|1928]]--&gt; season had not been a stellar one for the football team, but the net profits from football for that season approached $500,000.  Rockne was frustrated with the slow and cautious [[Congregation of Holy Cross|Holy Cross]] priests and their decision making process about spending money on the new stadium.  Rockne could not believe that a decision could not be made when there was such a large amount of money in the bank.  Because of this and a number of other issues, Rockne submitted his resignation to Father O’Donnell, the president of the university.  O’Donnell knew of Rockne’s history of submitting his resignations and he also knew that nothing would ever completely satisfy Rockne. O’Donnell was willing to find a compromise but was also unwilling to put the university in debt to finance the stadium.  He knew that the excess receipts from 1928 season and the projected receipts from playing all the away games in [[1929 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|1929]] on neutral fields would bring adequate cash into the university to finance the construction of the stadium.  O’Donnell also devised the scheme to finance 240 six-person “reserved box seats”.  This precursor of the [[personal seat license]] would allow the buyer to purchase tickets at face value and guarantee the same prime location for 10 years for an investment of $3,000 between the 45-yard lines, $2,500 between the 45 and 35-yard line and $2,000 between the 35 and the 25-yard line.  The university raised over $150,000 on this idea alone.&lt;ref&gt;Being Catholic, Being American The Notre Dame Story, 1842–1934, Robert E Burns, University of Notre Dame Press, Notre Dame Indiana,1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irish played their first game in the new stadium in [[1930 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|1930]] on October 4, beating [[SMU Mustangs football|SMU]] 20–14. The first Notre Dame touchdown in the stadium was scored by [[Joe_Savoldi|"Jumping Joe" Savoldi]] on a 98-yard kickoff return. The official dedication was a week later on October 11 against [[Navy Midshipmen football|Navy]], and Savoldi scored three touchdowns and was cited as [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19301012&amp;id=sG8hAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=DIgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2617,2207104&amp;hl=en "the first hero in the lore of Notre Dame Stadium."] 

As originally built, the stadium seated 54,000 people. However, with temporary bleachers, it could hold as many as 61,000 people. By 1966, its capacity increased to 59,075, mainly by changing the average seat width from {{convert|18|to|17|in|cm|1}}. In 1997, 21,000 new seats were added to the stadium, bringing the [[seating capacity]] to the present 80,795. The playing surface had always been natural grass through [[2013 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|2013]], but it was announced on April 12, [[2014 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|2014]], that after the commencement weekend, the playing field would be replaced with [[FieldTurf]], an infilled [[artificial turf]].&lt;ref name="FieldTurf announcement"&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.und.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/041214aac.html |title=Synthetic Turf to be Installed in Notre Dame Stadium by 2014 Football Season |publisher=Notre Dame Athletics |date=April 12, 2014 |accessdate=May 19, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521031659/http://www.und.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/041214aac.html |archivedate=May 21, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Notre Dame athletic director [[Jack Swarbrick]], in making the announcement, cited recent difficulties with maintaining an acceptable grass surface, and added that the change would allow the stadium to be used for football practices and non-football events.&lt;ref name="FieldTurf announcement"/&gt; During 2013, the university replaced the grass surface four times, including twice during the [[2013 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|football season]].&lt;ref name="Turf sale"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/10954073/notre-dame-fighting-irish-selling-stadium-turf-sections-150 |title=Notre Dame sells turf for $150 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=''[[ESPN.com]]'' |date=May 19, 2014 |accessdate=May 19, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140520143654/http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/10954073/notre-dame-fighting-irish-selling-stadium-turf-sections-150 |archivedate=May 20, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Notre Dame Stadium Panorama.jpg|thumb|Notre Dame Stadium Panorama]]
On January 29, 2014, the university announced plans to attach three new buildings to the stadium, totaling more than 750,000 square feet in expansions and costing about $400 million, with a timetable of 33 months for completion. According to a published statement by university president [[John I. Jenkins]], "the integrated nature of this project will maintain the compact [[walkability]] of campus, facilitate deeper connection and collaboration across the various units of the university, and offer an exciting addition" to the campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notre Dame Spending $400 Million on Football Stadium Renovation|url=http://www.newsmax.com/US/notre-dame-football-stadium-renovations/2014/01/29/id/549796|work=Article|publisher=Newsmax|accessdate=29 January 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202103657/http://www.newsmax.com/US/notre-dame-football-stadium-renovations/2014/01/29/id/549796|archivedate=2 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FieldTurf installation, as scheduled, began after Commencement Weekend on May 16–18, and the university sold {{convert|2|by|5|ft|cm|0|sing=on}} sections of the old turf to the public for $150 each.&lt;ref name="Turf sale"/&gt;

==Structure and architecture==
===Lighting===
Prior to the 1997 expansion, Notre Dame Stadium lacked permanent field lights. In [[1982 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|1982]], portable lighting by [[Musco Lighting]] was used for the first night game in the stadium's history on September 18 versus Michigan. Permanent lights were installed as part of the expansion. The lights were paid for by [[NBC Sports|NBC]], which has held the exclusive television rights to all home games since [[1991 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|1991]]. The permanent lights were added primarily to ensure sufficient lighting for mid-afternoon games in November; the university's agreements with NBC from 1991 to 2010 stipulated that there be no home night games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/sports/colleges/articles/2008/06/19/20080619nbcnd.html|title=Notre Dame, NBC agree to deal through 2015|author=|date=|website=www.azcentral.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the stadium hosted its first night game in 21 years on October 22, 2011 when the Irish hosted USC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.und.com/sports/m-footbl/sched/nd-m-footbl-sched.html|title=Notre Dame Football Official Schedule :: Notre Dame Football :: UND.COM :: The Official Site of Notre Dame Athletics|author=|date=|website=www.und.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905055203/http://www.und.com/sports/m-footbl/sched/nd-m-footbl-sched.html|archivedate=2015-09-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was announced in 2015 that Musco would be installing a LED field lighting system as part of the 2014–2017 stadium renovation and expansion project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musco.com/news/press-nd.html|title=Musco Press Release University of Notre Dame - Musco Sports Lighting -|author=|date=|website=www.musco.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108075422/http://musco.com/news/press-nd.html|archivedate=2016-01-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Touchdown Jesus"===
[[File:TDJesus.jpg|thumb|"Touchdown Jesus" is visible from inside the stadium]]
The stadium is known for its view of "Touchdown Jesus", a nickname given to the large mural  entitled ''The Word of Life'' by [[Millard Sheets]] of the [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrected Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;University of Notre Dame  Hesburgh Libraries, [http://www.library.nd.edu/about/history/mosaic.shtml Hesburgh (Main) Library ''Word of Life'' Mural] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060807002011/http://www.library.nd.edu/about/history/mosaic.shtml |date=2006-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Installed in [[1964 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|1964]] on the [[Hesburgh Library]], the mosaic wall looms over the stadium. The mural's nickname is derived from Jesus' upraised arms, which are similar in appearance to the raised arms of a referee signifying a [[touchdown]]. The expansion of the stadium in the late 1990s partially obscured the view of the mural from the playing field. ''The Word of Life'' mural was a gift of Mr. and Mrs. Howard V. Phalin of [[Winnetka, Illinois]].

===Campus Crossroads===
[[File:Duncan Student Center.jpg|thumb|The Duncan Student Center, part of Campus Crossroads]]
In January 2014, the University announced a $400 million enhancement of the stadium, the Campus Crossroads project. This expansion features 3, 8-story high buildings, on the west, south, and east sides of the stadium. The expansion added more than 750,000 square feet of teaching, research, and performance space. The enhancement added new premium stadium seats.
The three buildings are called the Duncan Student Center on the west, O'Neill Hall on the south, and Corbett Family Hall on the east. The project was completed in January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.southbendtribune.com/news/local/notre-dame-puts-finishing-touches-on-million-campus-crossroads-project/article_476c56be-5f31-5d87-b7ef-f1492acf633f.html|title=Notre Dame puts finishing touches on $400 million Campus Crossroads project|last=Tribune|first=Caleb Bauer South Bend|work=South Bend Tribune|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attendance==
Prior to [[1966 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|1966]], attendance figures were based on an actual count of patrons through the gates. The largest crowd to attend a home game prior to expansion was 61,296 in [[1962 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|1962]], against [[Purdue Boilermakers football|Purdue]] on October 6. Since 1966, attendance figures have been based on paid admissions with a fixed number of tickets available, accounting for the familiar 59,075 figure through the [[1996 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|1996]] season. Until [[Ara Parseghian]] arrived as coach at Notre Dame in [[1964 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|1964]], sellouts were not the norm. Since then, tickets for Notre Dame football have been notoriously hard to come by. As of the end of the [[2015 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|2015]] season, there have been 249 consecutive sellouts at Notre Dame Stadium, and 294 sellouts in the past 295 games dating back to 1964. The lone exception was a [[1973 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|1973]] game against [[Air Force Falcons football|Air Force]] which had been moved midseason by ABC to [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]] and was played with the students absent. The announced attendance was 57,235. Attendance at all five home games in [[1965 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|1965]] exceeded 59,000 as well.

The official capacity was listed at 80,225 when the stadium was first expanded. A subsequent computer revision put it at 80,012 in [[1998 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|1998]] and 80,232 in 2000. Sideline bleachers, which had been removed during expansion, were put back in after a few years, bringing the figure to its present 80,795 in [[2001 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|2001]].
In January 2014 the University of Notre Dame announced the campus crossroads project. A $400 million renovation would add luxury boxes and increase the stadium's capacity to around 85,000, but after the project was completed the seats were made wider and the number decreased to 77,622.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Columnist|first1=Bill Moor Tribune|title=Seats are two inches wider at new Notre Dame Stadium. Yes, it's a big difference.|url=https://www.southbendtribune.com/news/local/seats-are-two-inches-wider-at-new-notre-dame-stadium/article_2e41b22a-96a1-57bb-be14-a3cf3bd25acc.html|website=South Bend Tribune|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project began after the conclusion of the 2014 football season and finished in time for the 2017 season.

==Other events==
The stadium is scheduled to host the [[2019 NHL Winter Classic]] on New Years' Day between the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] and [[Boston Bruins]].

On October 20, 2018, the stadium hosted [[Garth Brooks]] as the very first concert in the stadium. It is the first stop on his stadium tour, and it was also announced during the concert that he would also end his tour at Notre Dame Stadium.

The Montreal '''Olympic Pool''' was constructed for the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] as part of the [[Montreal Olympic Park]]. The Olympic Pool is part of the larger swimming centre, located in the base of the inclined tower. The centre has a spectator capacity of 3,012 seats.

At the 1976 Olympics, the venue hosted [[Swimming at the 1976 Summer Olympics|swimming]], [[Diving at the 1976 Summer Olympics|diving]], [[Water polo at the 1976 Summer Olympics|water polo]], and the swimming part of the [[Modern pentathlon at the 1976 Summer Olympics|modern penatathlon]] events. It had a capacity of 10,000 seats at the time (6,988 temporary seats were installed).

The building was designed by French architect [[Roger Taillibert]], who also designed the [[Olympic Stadium (Montreal)|Olympic Stadium]] and [[Olympic Village (Montreal)|Olympic Village]].

The structure, along with the accompanying [[Montreal Biodome|velodrome]] inspired Tallibert's later designs for [[Luxembourg]]'s [[D'Coque|National Sports and Culture Centre]].

Outside of the actual aquatic complex, inside the tower, a small museum exists, commemorating the 1976 Games as well as Games past, with posters and displays in French and English.

As of 2014, the aquatic complex is closed while undergoing extensive renovations to bring the facilities in line with [[FINA]]+ standards, including:&lt;ref name="tsc"&gt;http://parcolympique.qc.ca/en/the-park/sports-centre/&lt;/ref&gt; 
*the upgrade of the diving towers and boards;
*the upgrade of the indoor relaxation pool;
*the refitting of all swimming pool decks and pool accesses;
*the removal of starting block platforms;
*the construction of concrete stands to support new starting blocks;
*the installation of new, mobile, and adjustable flooring in the competition swimming pool;
*the retrofitting of the competition pool to accommodate 25-metre events;
*the replacement of filtration systems in all pools;
*the refurbishment of the paddling pool (decks and accesses; removal of support structures);
*and the renovation of the wet lockers (showers, restrooms, etc.)

The pool reopened in May 2015, complete with modernized reception and waiting areas and a new boutique, rest area, and food court.&lt;ref name="tsc" /&gt;

'''Peter Edward Rose Sr.''' (born April 14, 1941), also known by his nickname "'''Charlie Hustle'''", is an [[Americans|American]] former professional [[baseball]] player and [[Manager (baseball)|manager]]. Rose played in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) from 1963 to 1986, and managed from 1984 to 1989.

Rose was a [[switch hitter]] and is the all-time MLB leader in [[Hit (baseball)|hits]] (4,256), games played (3,562), [[at-bat]]s (14,053), singles (3,215), and [[Out (baseball)|outs]] (10,328).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Guinness World Records |page=233 |year=2007 |publisher=[[HiT Entertainment]] |location=London; New York City |isbn=978-0-9735514-4-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He won three [[World Series ring]]s, three [[Batting average|batting titles]], one [[MLB Most Valuable Player award|Most Valuable Player Award]], two [[Gold Glove]]s, and the [[MLB Rookie of the Year award|Rookie of the Year Award]], and also made 17 [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] appearances at an unequaled five positions ([[second baseman]], [[left fielder]], [[right fielder]], [[third baseman]], and [[first baseman]]). Rose won both of his Gold Gloves when he was an outfielder, in 1969 and 1970.

In August 1989 (his last year as a manager and three years after retiring as a player), Rose was penalized with [[List of people banned from Major League Baseball|permanent ineligibility from baseball]] amidst accusations that he [[sports betting|gambled on baseball]] games while he played for and managed the Reds; the charges of wrongdoing included claims that he bet on his own team. In 1991, the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] formally voted to ban those on the "permanently ineligible" list from induction, after previously excluding such players by informal agreement among voters. After years of public denial, Rose admitted in 2004 that he bet on baseball and on the Reds.&lt;ref name="Dowd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball1.com/bb-data/rose/dowd/dowd_cover.html|title=The Baseball Archive presents The Dowd Report|work=baseball1.com|date=May 9, 1989|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030216144553/http://baseball1.com/bb-data/rose/dowd/dowd_cover.html|archivedate=February 16, 2003|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of Rose's possible reinstatement and election to the Hall of Fame remains contentious throughout baseball.

On June 22, 2015, [[ESPN]] concluded its own investigation of Rose and determined that he had bet on baseball while still a player–manager from 1984 to 1986.  The results of the investigation were made public and revealed the records of bets that Rose had made on baseball.  U.S. federal authorities had seized the records from one of Rose's associates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/13114874/notebook-obtained-lines-shows-pete-rose-bet-baseball-player-1986|title=Entries in long-hidden notebook show Pete Rose bet on baseball as player|first1=William|last1=Weinbaum|first2=T.J.|last2=Quinn|publisher=ESPN|date=June 22, 2015|accessdate=June 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Rose was born April 14, 1941, in [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]], one of four children born to Harry Francis "Pete" and LaVerne Rose. He was a member of the [[Order of DeMolay]] as a young boy and was encouraged by his parents to participate in sports.

He played baseball and football at [[Western Hills High School (Cincinnati, Ohio)|Western Hills High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3IJtVP9WnXEC&amp;lpg=PA304&amp;dq=Morrow%20Ohio&amp;pg=PA120#v=onepage&amp;q=Morrow%20Ohio&amp;f=false | title=This Day in Ohio History | publisher=Emmis Books | year=2005 | accessdate=November 21, 2013 | author=Goodman, Rebecca | page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Rose was small for his age, he earned the starting [[running back]] position on his freshman football team. When he was not promoted to the [[varsity team|varsity]] football team in his sophomore year, Rose was dejected and soon lost interest in his studies. At the end of the school year, Rose's teachers decreed he would have to attend summer school or be held back. His father decided it would be better for Pete to repeat a year of school than miss a summer playing baseball. It would also give Pete an extra year to mature physically.

When Rose reached his senior year, he had used up his four years of sports eligibility. In the spring of 1960, he joined the Class AA team sponsored by Frisch's Big Boy of [[Lebanon, Ohio]] in the Dayton Amateur League. He played [[catcher]], second base and [[shortstop]] and compiled a .626 batting average. This would have been the pinnacle of Rose's baseball career if not for the help of his uncle Buddy Bloebaum. Bloebaum was a "Bird dog" [[Scout (sport)|scout]] for the Reds and he pleaded the case for his nephew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1081212|title=Charlie Hustle Gives Twelve Dimes On The Dollar|author=William Leggett|date=May 27, 1968|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|accessdate=July 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Reds, who had recently traded away a number of prospects who turned out to be very good, decided to take a chance on Pete. Upon his graduation from high school, Rose signed a professional contract.

===Cincinnati Reds (1963–78)===

====Rookie of the Year====
[[File:Rose walking onto field.jpg|thumb|250px|Rose walks onto the field with the Cincinnati Reds]]
During a [[spring training]] game against the [[Chicago White Sox]] in 1963, the Reds' regular second baseman, [[Don Blasingame]], pulled a groin muscle; Rose got his chance and made the most of it. During another spring training game against the [[New York Yankees]], [[Whitey Ford]] gave him the derisive nickname '''"Charlie Hustle"''' after Rose sprinted to first base after drawing a [[Base on balls|walk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/classic/biography/s/rosepete000824.html|title=Hustle made Rose respected, infamous|author=Bob Carter|publisher=[[ESPN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/2013-04-13/sports/38513466_1_pete-rose-reds-base|title=Pete Rose brought hustle, first hit 50 years ago|author=Joe Kay|date=April 13, 2013|work=[[philly.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite (or perhaps because of) the manner in which Ford intended it, Rose adopted that nickname as a badge of honor. In [[Ken Burns]]'s documentary ''[[Baseball (TV series)|Baseball]]'', Ford's teammate [[Mickey Mantle]] claimed that Ford gave Rose the nickname after Rose, playing in left field, made an effort to climb the fence to try to catch a Mantle home run that everyone could see was headed over everything.

Rose made his major league debut on April 8, [[1963 Cincinnati Reds season|1963]] ([[Opening Day]]) against the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] at [[Crosley Field]], and drew a walk in his first plate appearance. After going 0-for-11, Rose got his first Major League hit on April 13, a triple off Pittsburgh's [[Bob Friend]]. He hit .273 for the year and won the [[National League]] [[MLB Rookie of the Year award|Rookie of the Year Award]], collecting 17 of 20 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/awards_1963.shtml|title=1963 Awards Voting|work=[[Baseball Reference]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rose entered the [[United States Army Reserves]] after the 1963 baseball season. He was assigned to [[Fort Knox]] for six months of active duty, which was followed by six years of regular attendance with a 478th Engineering Battalion USAR unit at [[Fort Thomas, Kentucky]]. At Fort Knox, he was a platoon guide and graduated from [[United States Army Basic Training]] on January 18, 1964, one week before his marriage to Karolyn. Rose then remained at Fort Knox to assist the sergeant in training the next platoon and to help another sergeant train the Fort's baseball team. Later in his Fort Thomas service, Rose served as company cook which entailed coming in early for the one weekend/month meeting so that he could leave early enough to participate in Reds home games. Other Reds players in the unit included [[Johnny Bench]], [[Bobby Tolan]] and [[Darrel Chaney]].

In an April 23, [[1964 Cincinnati Reds season|1964]] road contest against the [[Houston Colt .45's]], Rose reached first base on an error in the top of the ninth inning of a scoreless game, and scored on another error. The Colt .45s lost the game in the bottom of the ninth inning and [[Ken Johnson (right-handed pitcher)|Ken Johnson]] became the first pitcher to lose a [[complete game]] [[no-hitter]]. Rose slumped late in the season and was benched; he finished with a .269 average. In order to improve his batting, Rose played in the [[Venezuelan Winter League]] with [[Leones del Caracas]] team during the 1964–1965 offseason. Rose came back in [[1965 Cincinnati Reds season|1965]], leading the league in hits (209) and at-bats (670), and finishing sixth in NL MVP balloting. It was the first of his ten seasons with 200-plus hits, and his .312 batting average was the first of nine consecutive .300 seasons. He hit a career-high 16 [[home run]]s in [[1966 Cincinnati Reds season|1966]], then switched positions from [[second baseman|second base]] to [[right fielder|right field]] the following year.

In [[1968 Cincinnati Reds season|1968]], Rose started the season with a 22-game [[hitting streak]], missed three weeks (including the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]]) with a broken thumb, then had a 19-game hit streak late in the season. He had to finish the season 6-for-9 to beat out the Pirates' [[Matty Alou]] and win the first of two close NL batting-title races with a .335 average. He finished second to [[St. Louis Cardinals]] [[pitcher]] [[Bob Gibson]] for the NL MVP award, earning six first place votes.

Rose had his best offensive season in [[1969 Cincinnati Reds season|1969]], when he set a career-high in batting (.348) and tied his career-best 16 homers. As the Reds' leadoff man, he was the team's catalyst, rapping 218 hits, walking 88 times and pacing the league in runs with 120. He hit 33 doubles and 11 triples, drove in 82 runs, [[slugging percentage|slugged]] .512 (by far the highest mark of his long career), and had a .432 [[on-base percentage|OBP]] (also a career best). Rose and Pittsburgh's [[Roberto Clemente]] were tied for the batting title going into the final game; Rose bunted for a base hit in his last at-bat of the season to beat out Clemente (.345).

====1970 All-Star game====
Brand-new [[Riverfront Stadium]] had been open for only two weeks on July 14, [[1970 Cincinnati Reds season|1970]] when Rose was involved in one of the most infamous plays in [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] history. Facing the [[Los Angeles Angels|California Angels]]' [[Clyde Wright]] in the 12th inning, Rose singled and advanced to second on another single by the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]' [[Billy Grabarkewitz]]. The [[Chicago Cubs]]' [[Jim Hickman (1960s outfielder)|Jim Hickman]] then singled sharply to center. [[Amos Otis]]' throw went past [[Cleveland Indians]] catcher [[Ray Fosse]], as Rose barreled over Fosse to score the winning run. Fosse suffered a fractured and separated shoulder, which initially went undiagnosed until the following year.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Scott|title=Fosse still aching, but not bitter 43 years after All-Star Game collision|url=http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/blog/scott-miller/22721779/fosse-still-aching-but-not-bitter-43-years-after-all-star-game-collision|publisher=CBS Sports|date=July 11, 2013|accessdate=July 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fosse continued to hit for average (he finished the season at .307), but with diminished power—he had 16 home runs before the break but only two after. He played through the 1979 season, but never approached his first-year numbers.&lt;ref&gt;The Daily Star July 12, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The collision also caused Rose to miss three games with a bruised knee.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt;

====1973 season====
In [[1973 Cincinnati Reds season|1973]], Rose led the league with 230 hits and a .338 batting average en route to winning the NL MVP award and leading "[[the Big Red Machine]]" to the [[1973 National League Championship Series]] against the [[1973 New York Mets season|New York Mets]].

During the fifth inning of Game Three of the series, Rose was on first base when [[Joe Morgan]] hit a [[double play]] ball to Mets first baseman [[John Milner]]. Rose slid into second base in an attempt to break up the double play; this incited a fight with Mets shortstop [[Bud Harrelson]] that resulted in a bench-clearing brawl. When the Reds took the field, the game was nearly called off after the [[Shea Stadium]] crowd threw objects at Rose from the stands. The disruption caused Reds manager [[Sparky Anderson]] to pull his team off the field until order was restored. Mets manager [[Yogi Berra]] and players [[Willie Mays]], [[Tom Seaver]], [[Cleon Jones]], and [[Rusty Staub]] were actually summoned by NL President [[Chub Feeney]] out to left field to calm the fans. The Reds ended up losing that game, 9–2, and the NLCS, 3–2, despite Rose's .381 batting average in the series, and his eighth-inning home run to tie Game One and his 12th-inning home run to win Game Four.

====The Big Red Machine====
{{Main article|The Big Red Machine}}
The Cincinnati Reds of the 1970s earned the nickname "the Big Red Machine" and are widely acknowledged to be some of the greatest teams of all time. Rose was on a team with many great players that included future Hall of Famers Johnny Bench, Joe Morgan and [[Tony Pérez]], and he was viewed as one of the club's leaders.

Rose was a significant factor in the Reds' success in 1975 and 1976 when he successfully switched his primary position from the outfield to third base. Earlier in his career, the Reds and then-manager [[Don Heffner]] tried to force Rose to third base, but Rose chafed at the move and it was soon abandoned.  But in the spring of 1975, manager [[Sparky Anderson]], knowing how Rose would react to being forced to move, instead asked him if he would do so for the good of the team, and Rose immediately agreed. This move filled a void at third base and helped to solidify the Reds team for these two championship seasons, because it enabled the team to make greater use of power hitting outfielder [[George Foster (baseball)|George Foster]]. In [[1975 Cincinnati Reds season|1975]], Rose earned [[1975 World Series|World Series]] [[World Series Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] honors in leading the Reds to their first championship since [[1940 World Series|1940]], a seven-game triumph over the [[1975 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]]. Rose led the team with 10 hits and a .370 batting average in the seven games. He was awarded the [[Hickok Belt]] as the top professional athlete of the year, as well as  ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' magazine's "[[Sportsman of the Year]]" award.

The following year, he was a major force in helping the Reds repeat as World Series champions. The [[1976 Cincinnati Reds season|1976 Reds]] swept the [[1976 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]] in the best-three-of-five [[1976 National League Championship Series|NLCS]], followed by a four-game sweep of the [[1976 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] in the [[1976 World Series|World Series]]. The 1976 club remain the only team since the expansion of the playoffs in 1969 to go undefeated in the postseason, and the Reds franchise has not lost a World Series game since Game Six in 1975 (wins in Game Seven in '75, and four-game sweeps in '76 and [[1990 World Series|1990]]).

====3,000th Hit====
On May 5, [[1978 Cincinnati Reds season|1978]], Rose became the 13th player in major league history to garner his [[3,000 hit club|3,000th career hit]] when he singled off of [[Montreal Expos]] pitcher [[Steve Rogers (baseball)|Steve Rogers]] in front of 37,823 fans at home field [[Riverfront Stadium]] [https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CIN/CIN197805050.shtml]. 

====44-game hitting streak====
On June 14 [[1978 Cincinnati Reds season|1978]] in Cincinnati, Rose singled in the first inning off Cubs pitcher [[Dave Roberts (pitcher)|Dave Roberts]]; Rose would proceed to get a hit in every game he played until August 1, making a run at [[Joe DiMaggio]]'s record 56-game [[hitting streak]], which had stood virtually unchallenged for 37 years. The streak started quietly, but by the time it had reached 30 games, the media took notice and a pool of reporters accompanied Rose and the Reds to every game. On July 19 against the Phillies, Rose was hitless going into the eighth inning when he walked. His team was trailing in the ninth inning and the streak appeared over, but the Reds batted through their entire lineup and gave Rose another chance to bat. Rose faced [[Ron Reed]] and laid down a perfect [[Bunt (baseball)|bunt]] single to extend the streak to 32 games.

He would eventually tie [[Willie Keeler]]'s 1897 single season National League record at 44 games, but the streak came to an end on August 1 when [[Gene Garber]] of the [[Atlanta Braves]] struck out Rose in the ninth inning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1734&amp;dat=19780801&amp;id=_egbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lVEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6488,2915547&amp;hl=en|title=The Dispatch - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; With two outs and a full count, Garber decided not to challenge Rose with a fastball. He took full advantage of Rose's predicament by throwing him an off-speed pitch out of the strike zone, which Rose swung at and missed. Rose was sour after the game; he blasted Garber and the Braves for treating the situation "like it was the ninth inning of the seventh game of the [[World Series]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Former reliever Gene Garber recalls 19-year career and his role in baseball history |author=Joe O'Loughlin |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCI/is_2_63/ai_112167128 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040906180014/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCI/is_2_63/ai_112167128 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2004-09-06 |newspaper=Baseball Digest |publisher=Century Publishing Co. |date=February 2004 |accessdate=April 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Garber was not insulted by Rose and took the comment as a compliment: "I said to myself, 'Well, thanks, Pete. That's how I try to pitch every time I'm in a game'."

===Philadelphia Phillies (1979–83)===
The Philadelphia Phillies had won the National League East three years running (1976–78)—two of which were won with 101-win seasons—but they were unable to make it to the World Series. In 1979, the Phillies believed that Rose was the player who could bring them over the top, and they temporarily made him the highest-paid athlete in team sports when they signed him to a four-year, $3.2-million contract as a [[free agent]]. With perennial All-Star [[Mike Schmidt]] firmly entrenched at third, Rose made the final position change of his career when he moved to first base.

Although the Phillies missed the postseason in Rose's first year with the team, they earned three division titles (one in the first half of the [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|strike shortened 1981 season]]), two [[World Series]] appearances and their first ever World Series title ({{wsy|1980}}) in the following four years.

Rose had the worst season of his career in [[1983 Philadelphia Phillies season|1983]], which was also the season that the Phillies played in their second World Series in four years. The 42-year-old Rose batted only .245 with 121 hits and found himself benched during the latter part of the 1983 season when he appeared periodically to play and pinch hit. Rose did blossom as a pinch-hitter, with 8 hits in 21 at-bats, a .381 average.

Rose bounced back during the postseason, batting .375 (6-for-16) during the [[1983 National League Championship Series|NLCS]] against the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], and .312 (5-for-16) in the [[1983 World Series|World Series]] against the [[Baltimore Orioles]]. Rose went 1-for-8 in the first two games in Baltimore and was benched for Game Three in Philadelphia, though he grounded out in a pinch-hitting appearance. Rose objected to manager [[Paul Owens (baseball)|Paul Owens]]' decision to bench him in a pre-game interview with [[Howard Cosell]] of [[ESPN on ABC|ABC Sports]]. Rose bounced back with four hits in his last seven at-bats in the remaining two games, though the Phillies lost the Series to the Orioles, four games to one.

===Montreal Expos (1984)===
Rose was granted an unconditional release from the Phillies in late October 1983. Phillies management wanted to retain Rose for the 1984 season, but he refused to accept a more limited playing role. Months later, he signed a one-year contract with the [[1984 Montreal Expos season|Montreal Expos]]. On April 13, 1984, the 21st anniversary of his first career hit, Rose doubled off the Phillies' [[Jerry Koosman]] for his 4,000th career hit, becoming the second player in the 4000 hit club (joining [[Ty Cobb]]). Rose played 95 games with the Expos, having 72 hits and 23 RBIs while batting .259. On August 15, 1984, he was traded back to the Reds for infielder [[Tom Lawless]].

===The Hit King (1984–86)===
Upon rejoining the Reds, he was immediately named [[player-manager]], replacing [[Vern Rapp]]. Despite his .259 average for the season prior to joining the Reds, he hit .365 for the Reds in 26 games (with 35 hits and 11 RBIs), finishing with a .286 overall average - a 41-point improvement over the 1983 season. Furthermore, Rose managed the Reds to a 19–22 record for the remainder of the season.  

On September 11, 1985, Rose broke [[Ty Cobb]]'s all-time hits record with his 4,192nd hit, a single to left-center field off [[San Diego Padres]] pitcher [[Eric Show]]. According to the MLB.com web site, Major League Baseball continues to recognize Cobb's final hit total as 4,191, though independent research has revealed two of Cobb's hits were counted twice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url= http://www.curledup.com/2005espn.htm |title=The 2005 ESPN Baseball Encyclopedia – book review |work=curledup.com |accessdate=June 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/31/sports/baseball/31records.html | work=The New York Times | title=Numbers Are Cast in Bronze, but Are Not Set in Stone | first=Alan | last=Schwarz | date=July 31, 2005 | accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, it has been suggested Rose actually broke Cobb's record against the Cubs' [[Reggie Patterson]] with a single in the first inning of a Reds' 5–5 called game against Chicago on September 8. Because Rose broke Cobb's record, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[Wide World of Sports (U.S. TV series)|Wide World of Sports]] named Rose its Athlete of the Year that year. Rose accumulated a total of 4,256 hits before his final career at-bat, a [[strikeout]] against San Diego's [[Rich Gossage]] on August 17, 1986.

In 2010, ''[[Deadspin]]'' reported Rose used [[corked bat]]s during his 1985 pursuit of Cobb's record. Two sports memorabilia collectors who owned Rose's game-used bats from that season had the bats [[x-rayed]] and found the telltale signs of corking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Petchesky|first1=Barry|title=This Is Pete Rose's Corked Bat|url=http://deadspin.com/5555714/this-is-pete-roses-corked-bat|accessdate=16 June 2016|work=[[Deadspin]]|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]|date=June 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Littmann|first1=Chris|title=Corked Bats Reportedly Belonging to Pete Rose Come to Light|url=https://www.sbnation.com/2010/6/8/1647180/corked-bats-reportedly-belonging|accessdate=16 June 2016|work=[[SBNation]]|date=8 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rose had previously denied using corked bats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pete Rose interview|url=http://reds.enquirer.com/2004/01/13/red2qa.html|accessdate=16 June 2016|work=[[Cincinnati Enquirer]]|date=January 13, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement as a player==
{{MLBBioRet

On November 11, 1986, Rose was dropped from the Reds' 40-man roster to make room for pitcher [[Pat Pacillo]], and he unofficially retired as a player. Rose finished his career with a number of Major League and National League records that have lasted for many years. Rose, always proud of his ability to hit .300 or better in 15 of his 24 playing seasons, had a lifetime .303 batting average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ESPN|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/player/stats/_/id/397/pete-rose|work=Pete Rose Stats|accessdate=2014-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After retiring as a player, Rose remained with the Reds as manager until August 24, 1989. With a career record of 426–388 as a manager, Rose ranks fifth in Reds history for managerial wins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cincinnati Reds|url=http://cincinnati.reds.mlb.com/cin/history/managers.jsp|accessdate=2014-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Rose's four full seasons at the helm (1985–1988), the Reds posted four second-place finishes in the NL West division.

===Thirty-day suspension===
On April 30, 1988, during a home game against the New York Mets, with two out in the top of the ninth inning, [[Mookie Wilson]] hit what looked like a routine ground ball to the shortstop, but the throw to first base was wide and pulled the first baseman's foot off the bag. [[Umpire (baseball)|umpire]] [[Dave Pallone]] didn't immediately make the safe call and the first baseman waited on the call instead of making a play at the plate allowing Howard Johnson to score all way from second base with what would turn out to be the game-winning run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CIN/CIN198804300.shtml |title=April 30, 1988 New York Mets at Cincinnati Reds Play by Play and Box Score |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date=April 30, 1988 |accessdate=2012-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dave Palone And Pete Rose April 30, 1988 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP3_0I2LbBM |website=youtube |accessdate=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rose vehemently argued the call and forcefully pushed the umpire twice with his shoulder and forearm knocking Dave Pallone several feet backward. Even touching an umpire calls for the immediate ejection of the offender, and that is what Pallone did. Rose had to be forcibly restrained by his own coaches as he came back at Pallone. In the time it took to remove Rose from the field Cincinnati fans began showering the field with objects that included radios and cigarette lighters. Even though the inning was not over everybody retreated to the dugouts. Reds' owner [[Marge Schott]] posted a message onto the electronic billboard, asking fans to stop throwing objects onto the field.

After a 15-minute suspension of play, Pallone left the field and the game was completed with the remaining three umpires. National League president [[A. Bartlett Giamatti]] suspended Rose for 30 days, which was the longest suspension ever levied for an on-field incident involving a manager. He also fined Rose "a substantial amount"; the actual amount was not disclosed. Giamatti said; "Such incidents are not business as usual and will not be allowed to become so."

Giamatti also summoned the Reds' on-air radio announcers, [[Marty Brennaman]] and [[Joe Nuxhall]], to his office in New York City and dressed them down for inciting the fan response with "inflammatory and completely irresponsible remarks." Giamatti told Brennaman and Nuxhall, "There is no excuse for encouraging a situation where the physical safety and well-being of any individual is put significantly at risk. Nothing justifies such unprofessional behavior."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = Chass| first = Murray |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/03/sports/pete-rose-is-suspended-30-days.html|title=Pete Rose Is Suspended 30 Days|accessdate=May 15, 2015 | work=The New York Times | date=May 3, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Permanent ineligibility==
{{Main article|Dowd Report}}
Amid reports that he had bet on baseball, Rose was informally questioned in February 1989 by [[Commissioner of Baseball]] [[Peter Ueberroth]] and NL President [[Bart Giamatti]]. Rose vehemently denied the allegations. By this time, MLB owners had elected Giamatti to succeed Ueberroth, and the outgoing Commissioner decided to leave the matter to be dealt with by his successor. In the meantime, ''Sports Illustrated'' gave the public their first detailed report of the allegations that Rose had placed bets on baseball games on March 21, 1989,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SI.com|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2004/baseball/mlb/01/05/rose.chronology/|work=Pete Rose Chronology}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the cover story of the issue dated April 3, 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=April 3rd, 1989|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/edb/reader.html?magID=SI&amp;issueDate=19890403&amp;mode=reader_vault|work=Sports Illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Giamatti assumed office as the seventh Commissioner of Baseball on April 1. Three days later, lawyer [[John M. Dowd]] was retained to investigate the charges against Rose. 

===Investigation===

Dowd interviewed many of Rose's associates, including alleged bookies and bet runners. He delivered a summary of his findings to the Commissioner in May. In it, Dowd documented Rose's alleged gambling activities in 1985 and 1986 and compiled a day-by-day account of Rose's alleged betting on baseball games in 1987. The ''[[Dowd Report]]'' documented his alleged bets on 52 Reds games in 1987, where Rose wagered a minimum of $10,000 a day. Others alleged to have been involved in the activities claim that number was actually $2,000 a day.

===Response===

Rose continued to deny all of the accusations against him and refused to appear at a hearing with Giamatti on the matter. He filed a lawsuit in Hamilton County [[Ohio Courts of Common Pleas|Court of Common Pleas]], the Ohio state trial court covering Cincinnati, alleging that the Commissioner had prejudged the case and could not provide a fair hearing. The  Court of Common Pleas issued a temporary restraining order to delay the hearing, but Giamatti sought to [[removal jurisdiction|remove]] the case to the federal [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio]]. The Southern District of Ohio granted Giamatti’s removal petition. The parties thereafter entered settlement negotiations, as the federal court, whose judges were life appointees and whose jurisdiction included large areas where the Reds were less popular, was seen to be a less favorable forum for Rose than a state court covering only Cincinnati and its immediate environs and whose judges faced election every six years.

===Aftermath===
On August 24, 1989, Rose voluntarily accepted a permanent place on baseball's ineligible list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://seanlahman.com/files/rose/agreement.html |title=Rose/Giamatti Agreement |publisher=seanlahman.com |accessdate=June 9, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630114625/http://seanlahman.com/files/rose/agreement.html |archive-date=June 30, 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rose accepted that there was a factual reason for the ban; in return, Major League Baseball agreed to make no formal finding with regard to the gambling allegations. According to baseball's rules, Rose could apply for reinstatement in one year but [[Bart Giamatti]] said, "There is absolutely no deal for reinstatement. That is exactly what we did not agree to in terms of a fixed number of years." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-08-24/news/mn-1531_1_pete-rose |work=Los Angeles Times |title=Pete Rose Banned for Life : Giamatti Says He Bet on Games; Appeal Possible in Year |date=August 24, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rose, with a 412–373 record, was replaced as Reds manager by [[Tommy Helms]]. Rose began therapy with a psychiatrist for treatment of a gambling addiction.

Giamatti died of a heart attack on September 1, 1989, eight days after announcing Rose's suspension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/02/obituaries/giamatti-scholar-and-baseball-chief-dies-at-51.html|title=Obituary: Giamatti, Scholar and Baseball Chief, Dies at 51|last=McFadden|first=Robert D.|publisher=''New York Times''|date=August 2, 1989|accessdate=June 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dowd Report says, "no evidence was discovered that Rose bet against the Reds", but investigator Dowd stated in a December 2002 interview that he believed Rose probably bet against the Reds while managing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/news/2002/1212/1475769.html |title=ESPN.com: Dowd: Rose 'probably' bet against Reds while manager |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=June 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those critical of Rose's behavior, including Ohio's own Hall of Fame baseball reporter, [[Hal McCoy]], have observed that "the major problem with Rose betting on baseball, particularly the Reds, is that as manager he could control games, make decisions that could enhance his chances of winning his bets, thus jeopardizing the integrity of the game."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sullivan|first1=Tim|title=Pete Rose Should Be In The Hall Of Fame|url=http://www.sportsgamblingwebsites.com/pete-rose-should-be-in-the-hall-of-fame/|accessdate=July 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Major League Baseball rule that Rose violated prohibits ''any'' bet on a game the bettor is involved in, making no distinction between betting for or against one's team. The rule is: "Rule 21 Misconduct, (d) Betting on Ball Games, Any player, umpire, or club, or league official, or employee, who shall bet any sum whatsoever upon any baseball game in connection with which the bettor has a duty to perform shall be declared permanently ineligible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://verifiable-truth.blogspot.com/2007/10/mlbs-rule-21-misconduct-gambling.html|title=MLB's Rule 21: Misconduct; gambling prohibitions |publisher=The Verifiable Truth |date=October 16, 2007 |accessdate= August 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reinstatement efforts===
In 1992, Rose applied for reinstatement. [[Fay Vincent]], who as deputy commissioner had played a key role in negotiating the agreement banning Rose before becoming commissioner after Giamatti's death, never acted on Rose's application. In September 1998, Rose applied for reinstatement with Vincent's successor [[Bud Selig]], but Selig also never acted on it.

In public comments, Selig said he saw no reason to reconsider Rose's punishment; however, in March 2003, Selig acknowledged that he was considering Rose's application, leading to speculation that Rose's return might be imminent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Representatives for Rose applied in 2015 for reinstatement with Selig's successor, [[Rob Manfred]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/mlb-big-league-stew/rob-manfred-will-consider-pete-rose-s-request-for-reinstatement-164521145.html | title=Rob Manfred will consider Pete Rose's request for reinstatement | publisher=[[Yahoo! Sports]] | date=March 16, 2015 | accessdate=March 17, 2015 | author=Cwik, Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on December 15, 2015, Manfred rejected the request.  Manfred stated that Rose had not been forthcoming about his gambling and that Rose (who by this time was living in [[Las Vegas]]) was still betting on baseball. Although Rose was placing legal bets by this time, MLB has long barred players, managers, and coaches from ''any'' form of gambling on baseball, legal or otherwise.  He also felt that Rose did not have "a mature understanding of his wrongful conduct" and the damage it had done to the game.  For these reasons, Manfred concluded that allowing him back in the game would be an "unacceptable risk."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/14365554/pete-rose-remains-banned-major-league-baseball-per-commissioner-rob-manfred-decision | title=Pete Rose's ban from baseball remains in place | publisher=[[ESPN]].com | date=December 15, 2015 | accessdate=December 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tax evasion==
On April 20, 1990, Rose pleaded guilty to two charges of filing false [[income tax]] returns not showing income he received from selling [[autograph]]s and memorabilia and from horse racing winnings. On July 19, Rose was sentenced to five months in the medium security prison camp at the [[United States Penitentiary, Marion|United States Penitentiary]] in [[Marion, Illinois]], and fined $50,000.&lt;ref name="EnquirerTimeline"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reds.enquirer.com/2004/01/06/red1timeline.html |title=Pete Rose timeline |publisher=reds.enquirer.com  |accessdate=June 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was released on January 7, 1991, after having paid $366,041 in back taxes and interest and was required to perform 1,000 hours of community service.&lt;ref name="ESPN_PrisonRelease"&gt;{{cite web |last = Schwartz | first = Larry|url=http://assets.espn.go.com/classic/s/moment0107rosereleased.html |title=ESPN Classic&amp;nbsp;– Rose released from Marion Federal Prison |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=June 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Edward Rose, inmate # 01832-061, [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]], U.S Dep't of Justice, at [http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/InmateFinderServlet?Transaction=NameSearch&amp;needingMoreList=false&amp;FirstName=Peter&amp;Middle=&amp;LastName=Rose&amp;Race=U&amp;Sex=U&amp;Age=&amp;x=99&amp;y=8].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hall of Fame eligibility==
On February 4, 1991, the Hall of Fame voted formally to exclude individuals on the permanently ineligible list from being inducted into the Hall of Fame by way of the [[Baseball Writers' Association of America]] vote. However, a longstanding unwritten rule already barred permanently ineligible players from enshrinement. Rose and [[Jenrry Mejía]] are the only living former players on the ineligible list (although former executives Chris Correa and [[John Coppolella]] are also on the list for other infractions). Players who were not selected by the BBWAA could be considered by the [[Veterans Committee]] in the first year after they would have lost their place on the Baseball Writers' ballot. Under the Hall's rules, players may appear on the ballot for only fifteen years, beginning five years after they retire. Had he not been banned from baseball, Rose's name could have been on the writers' ballot beginning in 1992 and ending in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=4358260|title=Sources: Pete Rose's status the same, despite report |publisher=ESPN|accessdate=June 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He would have been eligible for consideration by the Veterans Committee in 2007, but did not appear on the ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = O'Connell |first = Jack|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=4358260 |title=Sources: Pete Rose's status the same, despite report&amp;nbsp;|publisher=ESPN |accessdate=June 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the Veterans Committee barred players and managers on the ineligible list from consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://baseballhall.org/hall-famers/rules-election/vet-committee-players |title=Vet Committee&amp;nbsp;– Players |publisher=baseballhall.org |accessdate=June 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530074548/http://baseballhall.org/hall-famers/rules-election/vet-committee-players |archivedate=May 30, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eight years later, Rose petitioned the Hall of Fame to permit his name to be submitted for induction, saying that he had not expected to be prevented from Hall of Fame consideration when agreeing to the lifetime ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shaikin|first1=Bill|title=Pete Rose asks Hall of Fame to let him stand for election|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/mlb/la-sp-pete-rose-hall-of-fame-20160928-snap-story.html|accessdate=October 1, 2016|work=Los Angeles Times|date=September 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ineligible for Baseball Hall of Fame, Rose was inducted into the [[Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame]] in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://m.mlb.com/news/article/162253924/pete-rose-joining-reds-hall-of-fame-in-2016/|title=Rose elated over election to Reds Hall of Fame|last=Sheldon|first=Mark|publisher=''MLB.com''|date=January 19, 2016|accessdate=August 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==MLB All-Century Team==
In 1999, Rose was selected as an outfielder on the [[Major League Baseball All-Century Team]]. To select the team, a panel of experts first compiled a list of the 100 greatest players from the past century. Fans then voted on the players using paper and online ballots.

An exception was made to his ban to allow him to participate in the pre-game introduction of the All-Century team before Game 2 of the [[1999 World Series]] between the Braves and Yankees. Despite never having been a member of the Braves, Rose received the loudest ovation of the All-Century team members from the crowd at [[Turner Field]] in [[Atlanta]], Georgia.

After the ceremony on live television, [[NBC]]'s [[Jim Gray (sportscaster)|Jim Gray]] repeatedly asked Rose if he was ready to admit to betting on baseball and apologize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2004/scorecard/08/05/interviews/|title=Top 10 Most Embarrassing TV/Radio Interview Moments|publisher=SI.com|date=August 6, 2004 | accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armchairqb.com/nbc_rose.html|title=No Gray Area Here|publisher=armchairqb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q1excEhov4YC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;dq=pete+rose+transcript+jim+gray|title=Sports media: planning, production, and reporting|author=Brad Schultz | isbn=978-0-240-80731-7 | year=2005 | publisher=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people were outraged over Gray's aggressive questioning, feeling that it detracted from the ceremony. In protest, Yankees outfielder [[Chad Curtis]] refused to speak with Gray after his game-winning home run in Game 3. Earlier that season, Rose had been ranked at number 25 on ''[[The Sporting News]]''{{'}} list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players.

In 2002, Rose again appeared during the 2002 World Series in a Master Card-sponsored event recalling "Baseball's Most Memorable Moments."  Fans voted Rose's record-breaking hit over Ty Cobb as the 6th most memorable moment in baseball history.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

While allowing him to participate in the All-Century Team, and a September 2010 celebration at [[Great American Ball Park]] of the 25th anniversary of Rose's 4,192nd hit,&lt;ref name="kennedy20140310"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/mlb/news/20140305/pete-rose-book-excerpt/#all | title=A quarter century later, there are no easy answers to the Pete Problem | work=Sports Illustrated | date=2014-03-10 | accessdate=March 9, 2014 | author=Kennedy, Kostya | pages=46–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; MLB has refused to allow him to participate in other events in Cincinnati, such as the 25th anniversary reunion of the Big Red Machine, the closing of [[Cinergy Field]], and the opening of Great American Ball Park, as well as the closing of [[Veterans Stadium]] in Philadelphia and 1980 Phillies anniversary celebrations. Since assuming office, Commissioner Manfred has taken a more relaxed attitude compared to Selig with respect to participation by Rose in MLB events that cannot influence play.

==Coming clean==
In his autobiography ''[[My Prison Without Bars]]'', published by [[Rodale Press]] on January 8, 2004, Rose finally admitted publicly to betting on baseball games and other sports while playing for and managing the Reds. He also admitted to betting on Reds games, but said he never bet against the Reds. He repeated his admissions in an interview on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] news program ''[[Primetime (U.S. TV program)|Primetime Thursday]]''. He also said in the book he hoped his admissions would help end his ban from baseball so he could reapply for reinstatement.

In March 2007, during an interview on ''The [[Dan Patrick]] Show'' on [[ESPN Radio]], Rose said, "I bet on my team every night. I didn't bet on my team four nights a week. I bet on my team to win every night because I loved my team, I believed in my team", he said. "I did everything in my power every night to win that game."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/14/AR2007031402068.html Pete Rose: 'I Bet on My Team Every Night']. The Associated Press (March 14, 2007). Retrieved on 2012-05-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

John Dowd disputed Rose's contention he bet on the Reds every night, asserting Rose did not bet on his team when [[Mario Soto (baseball)|Mario Soto]] or [[Bill Gullickson]] pitched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2007-03-15-rose-dowd_N.htm |title=Dowd: Some nights, Rose didn't bet on Reds|work=USA Today |accessdate=August 10, 2012 |first=John |last=Erardi |date=March 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Dowd's allegations did not match the records in his own report. A notebook detailing Rose's daily betting activity shows Rose placed bets on five of the six games Soto started in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://seanlahman.com/files/rose/exhibits/EXHIBIT_012.pdf |title=Dowd Report, Exhibit 12: Paul Janszen Betting Notebook |access-date=August 10, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619082532/http://seanlahman.com/files/rose/exhibits/EXHIBIT_012.pdf |archive-date=June 19, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lone exception was April 26, 1987, when Rose allegedly placed bets on hockey and basketball games but no baseball games. Those records also show he bet on every game Gullickson started during the period which the betting notebook covered.

The criticism of Rose did not diminish after this admission—some Rose supporters were outraged Rose would reverse fifteen years of denial as part of a book publicity tour. In addition, the timing was called into question by making his admission just two days after the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] announced its class of 2004 inductees, Rose appeared to be linking himself publicly to the Hall.

Even after his 2004 admission of gambling, Rose had described his violation of MLB rules with what journalist Kostya Kennedy described as "a kind of swagger, that familiar screw-you defiance". On September 11, 2010, however, at a [[roast (comedy)|roast]] of Rose held at [[Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg]] in Indiana on the 25th anniversary of his 4,192nd hit and attended by many teammates, Rose wept while acknowledging he had "disrespected baseball". He apologized to Pérez and other members of the Big Red Machine, stating, "I guarantee everyone in this room I will never disrespect you again. I love the fans, I love the game of baseball, and I love Cincinnati baseball". His words and crying surprised those present; a ''Cincinnati Enquirer'' reporter said "It felt completely unscripted, completely sincere and very powerful. I had covered Rose for more than 25 years and hadn't ever heard him like that".{{r|kennedy20140310}}

==WWE==
Between 1998 and 2000, Rose appeared at [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]]'s (now WWE) annual [[WrestleMania]] pay-per-view event, in what became a [[running gag]]. At [[WrestleMania XIV]] he served as "guest [[ring announcer]]" during a match between [[Glenn Jacobs|Kane]] and [[the Undertaker]], before which he took a [[Tombstone piledriver|Tombstone Piledriver]] from Kane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/14/celebrities |title=WrestleMania XIV Celebrities |accessdate=May 2, 2012 |publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the next year's [[WrestleMania XV]], Rose was portrayed as seeking revenge. To do so, he dressed as [[the San Diego Chicken]] and "attacked" Kane before his scheduled match, only to take another Tombstone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/15/celebrities |title=WrestleMania XV Celebrities |accessdate=May 2, 2012 |publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned for a third time the following year, at [[WrestleMania 2000]], but again was thwarted by Kane, as well as [[Rikishi (wrestler)|Rikishi]], his tag team partner that night.

In addition to these three appearances, he appeared in a [[Halloween]]-themed commercial for WWE's [[No Mercy (2002)|No Mercy]] event in 2002 and was chokeslammed by Kane. In 2004, Rose was inducted into the "Celebrity Wing" of the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] [[WWE Hall of Fame (2004)|class of 2004]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/peterose/bio/ |title=WWE Hall of Fame Bio |accessdate=September 28, 2007 |publisher=WWE |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070716005225/http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/peterose/bio/ |archivedate = July 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first celebrity to go into the Hall, and was inducted at a ceremony prior to [[WrestleMania XX]] by Kane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/20/celebrities |title=WrestleMania XX Celebrities |accessdate=May 2, 2012 |publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 22, 2010, he was the guest host on ''[[WWE Raw]]'', which was the last episode of Raw before [[WrestleMania XXVI]]. As his first order of business, he set up a match between [[Shawn Michaels]] and Kane, which Michaels won. Later that night, Kane attacked Rose offscreen.

Rose was briefly mentioned on WWE television again on August 27, 2012. In an anger management segment, Kane stated "for reasons never quite explained, I have an unhealthy obsession with torturing Pete Rose."  Rose was later interviewed on WWE.com about his experiences with Kane's anger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/2012-09-10/pete-rose-exclusive-interview-26051776/page-2|title=Pete Rose steps to the plate to discuss Kane's anger issues|date=September 14, 2012|last=Styles|first=Joey|accessdate=December 4, 2012|publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fox Sports analyst==
On April 16, 2015, it was announced that Rose had been hired by [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]] to serve as a guest studio [[color analyst]] for MLB coverage on [[Fox Major League Baseball|Fox]] and [[Fox Sports 1]], appearing on the ''MLB on Fox'' pregame show as well as ''[[MLB Whiparound]]'', ''[[America's Pregame]]'', and ''[[Fox Sports Live]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com/mlb/story/pete-rose-mlb-on-fox-to-join-baseball-analyst-pregame-show-fox-sports-one-ken-rosenthal-041815|title=Pete Rose, baseball's Hit King, to join FOX, FS1 as MLB analyst|last=Rosenthal|first=Ken|publisher=foxsports.com|date=April 16, 2015|accessdate=April 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his Fox Sports 1 debut on May 11, 2015.

==Personal life==
Rose married Karolyn Englehardt on January 25, 1964, and the couple had two children, daughter Fawn (b. 1964) and son [[Pete Rose Jr.]] (b. 1969). The couple divorced in 1980. In 1978, a paternity suit was filed naming Rose as the father of Morgan Erin Rubio.  In a 1996 settlement of the lawsuit, Rose acknowledged that Rubio was his daughter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.philly.com/1996-11-24/news/25647120_1_mad-magazine-thrift-store-tv-spots Rose admits he is 18-year-old's father; Heard charged with stalking 'Homicide' actress].

Rose married his second wife, Carol J. Woliung, in 1984. They have two children, son Tyler, (b. 1984) and daughter Cara (b. 1989).  Rose finalized his divorce from Carol in March 2011.{{Fact|date=April 2018}}  The 69-year-old Rose cited [[irreconcilable differences]] for the split, but his petition did not offer any additional details. Rose did not include a date for their separation.  Documents in the filing say that Rose is looking to acquire all memorabilia and other possessions before the marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news;_ylt=AtEaR3q2SX37tUlEEgwLRQMRvLYF?slug=ap-peterose-divorce]{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While separated from his second wife, Rose began an open relationship with Kiana Kim, a ''[[Playboy]]'' model. During a 2009 interview, Rose discussed his relationship with Kim, stating, "My girl has finally decided to try to shoot for ''[[Playboy]]'', and they were kind enough to give her an opportunity to come to Houston for an interview, and we're excited about that." A reality show called ''[[Pete Rose: Hits &amp; Mrs.]]'', following the life of Rose and Kim, and his two stepchildren Cassie and Ashton premiered on [[TLC (TV channel)|TLC]] on January 14, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/tlc-launches-pete-rose-reality-show-article-1.1218434|title=TLC launches Pete Rose reality show focusing on baseball's all-time hits leader's impending marriage to much younger former Playboy Playmate|work=[[NY Daily News]]|author=Hinckley, David|date=December 12, 2012|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/12/11/new-reality-series-pete-rose-hits-mrs-to-premiere-monday-january-14-on-tlc/161303/|title=New Reality Series 'Pete Rose: Hits &amp; Mrs.' premiered Monday, January 14 on TLC|work=TV by the Numbers|author=Bibel, Sarah|date=December 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rose and Kim have been engaged since 2011.

She uses the stage name "[[Chea Courtney]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0183895/ |title=Chea Courtney |publisher=Internet Movie Database |accessdate=June 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = John | last = Kiesewetter | title = A Rose makes a name for herself: Pete's 12-year-old daughter Cara uses her role in 'Passions' to further her Hollywood ambitions | date = August 2, 2002 | url = http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2002/08/02/tem_a_rose_makes_name.html | work = [[The Cincinnati Enquirer]] | accessdate = 2013-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His older son, [[Pete Rose, Jr.]], spent 16 years as a minor league baseball player, advancing to the majors once for an 11-game stint with the Cincinnati Reds in 1997.

{{asof|2014|03}} Rose earns more than $1 million annually from many paid public appearances and autograph signings. These include appearances in [[Cooperstown, New York]], around the time of the Hall of Fame induction weekend each year. Although Rose does not stay at the Otesaga Resort Hotel with other baseball people and cannot attend the ceremonies, many fans gather for his autograph.{{r|kennedy20140310}}

Rose filed a defamation suit against attorney John M. Dowd in July 2016 after comments Dowd made in a radio interview last summer; the comments alluded that Rose had engaged in [[statutory rape]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/16831410/pete-rose-files-defamation-lawsuit-john-dowd|title=Pete Rose files federal defamation lawsuit against John Dowd|publisher=''ESPN''|date=July 6, 2016|accessdate=2017-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; A court document during the suit was released in July 2017 with a sworn statement alleging Rose had engaged in a sexual relationship with a minor in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/20208447/woman-accuses-pete-rose-statutory-rape|title=Court document alleges that Pete Rose committed statutory rape in the 1970s|last=Weinbaum|first=William|publisher=''ESPN''|date=July 31, 2017|accessdate=2017-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In light of these new allegations, the Phillies cancelled his upcoming [[Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame]] ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/phillies/phillies-cancel-pete-rose-ceremony-amid-allegations-20170802.html|title=Phillies cancel Pete Rose ceremony amid allegations|last=Gelb|first=Matt|website=Philly.com|date=August 2, 2017|accessdate=August 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On December 15, 2017, a judge dismissed the defamation lawsuit when both parties reached an agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/21777131/pete-rose-defamation-suit-john-dowd-dismissed-agreement-reached|title=Pete Rose's defamation suit against John Dowd dismissed|last=Weinbaum|first=William|website=espn.com|date=December 15, 2017|accessdate=December 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Records and achievements==
Aside from the numerous records he set and individual titles he won, Rose was also honored with the 1968 [[Hutch Award]], the 1969 [[Lou Gehrig Memorial Award]], and the 1976 [[Roberto Clemente Award]]. Despite his status of permanent ineligibility for the [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]], Rose received 9.5% of the votes (17th place overall) in his first year on the ballot for the [[Baseball Writers' Association of America|Baseball Writers]]. He continued to receive votes for the next two years but failed to achieve the minimum of 5% to keep him on the ballot.

'''Punta del Este Street Circuit''' is a [[street circuit]] located in [[Punta del Este]], [[Uruguay]]. It runs along the town's [[harbour]] – nicknamed the [[Monte Carlo]] of [[South America]].

The Argentine [[TC2000]] hosted three races at Punta del Este in 2007, 2008 and 2010.

The [[Formula E]] has hosted the [[Punta del Este ePrix]] at the venue. The first edition was held on 13 December 2014 during the [[2014–15 Formula E season|2014–15 season]].  The track is 2.8 km in length and features 20 turns.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.fiaformulae.com/en/calendar/2014-punta-del-este/punta-del-este-circuit.aspx|title=Circuit Guide &amp;#124; Punta del Este, Uruguay &amp;#124; FIA Formula E|publisher=FIA Formula E|date=|accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiaformulae.com/en/news/2014/june/formula-e-reveals-circuit-for-punta-del-este-eprix.aspx|title=Formula E reveals circuit for Punta del Este ePrix|publisher=FIA Formula E|date=2014-06-20|accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/114541|title=Formula E unveils Punta del Este circuit in Uruguay|publisher=autosport.com|date=2014-06-20|accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[2015–16 Formula E season|season two]], the circuit was slightly modified. The first corner was changed, instead of a right-left chicane it is now left-right. The idea behind this change is to make the pit exit much safer than last year, where the cars were exiting the pits on the racing line. This also slightly reduced the lap length to 2.785&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiaformulae.com/en/news/2015/december/punta-del-este-eprix-track-guide.aspx|title=Punta del Este ePrix - Circuit guide|publisher=FIA Formula E|date=2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''statue of [[Bruce Lee]]''' was unveiled on Saturday, November 26, 2005, in the city of [[Mostar]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], by  sculptor Ivan Fijolić. Located in the City Park of "Zrinjski," the life-sized statue stands 1.68 meters tall, shorter than Bruce Lee's actual height of 1.72 meters,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heightdb.com/person/bruce-lee&lt;/ref&gt; and is a symbol of solidarity in the ethnically divided city.

==History==
The statue was the first public monument to Bruce Lee unveiled in the world, with a statue in Hong Kong being revealed one day later marking what would have been the Chinese star's 65th birthday.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

The project of the statue was spearheaded by Mostar Urban Movement, a youth group headed by [[Nino Raspudić]] and [[Veselin Gatalo]], who saw the statue as "an attempt to question symbols, old and new, by mixing up high grandeur with [[mass culture]] and [[kung fu]]." Bruce Lee was chosen as a symbol of the fight against ethnic divisions. Lee, who was an American of Chinese descent and famous martial arts actor, represented to the residents of Mostar a bridging of cultures. "One thing we all have in common is Bruce Lee."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4474316.stm | work=BBC News | title=Bosnia unveils Bruce Lee bronze | date=2005-11-26 | accessdate=2010-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In a city with a reputation for violence, the dynamic movie star was a symbol of "loyalty, skill, friendship and justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/33300.html |title=Mostar's Little Dragon: How Bruce Lee became a symbol of peace in the Balkans |accessdate=2007-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unveiling ceremony of the statue saw the attendance of local Bruce Lee fans, representatives of the German government, which had bankrolled the project, as well as Chinese officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4474316.stm |title=Bosnia unveils Bruce Lee bronze |accessdate=2007-09-13 | work=BBC News | date=2005-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martial arts is popular among the youth population in [[Herzegovina]], especially competitive [[Mixed Martial Arts]] where Croatian [[Mirko Filipović]] is an international star.

Shortly afterward the sculpture was vandalized, removed for repairs and brought back at the end of May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/place/bruce-lee-sculpture-in-mostar | title=The Lost Bruce Lee Sculpture of Mostar | accessdate=2010-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.artfagcity.com/2009/08/24/img-mgmt-turbo-sculpture/ | title=IMG MGMT: Turbo Sculpture | accessdate=2010-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bosnians and Croats had complained that the statue was a provocation because it was oriented towards their area in a fighting stance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/11/world/europe/11balkans.html | work=The New York Times | first=Dan | last=Bilefsky | title=Balkans' Idolatry Delights Movie Fans and Pigeons | date=2007-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sussex Stakes''' is a [[Group races|Group 1]] [[Flat racing|flat]] [[Horse racing|horse race]] in Great Britain open to horses aged three years or older. It is run at [[Goodwood Racecourse|Goodwood]] over a distance of 1 mile (1,609 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in late July or early August.

==History==
The first version of the event, a 6-furlong race for two-year-olds, was established in 1841. It continued intermittently for thirty-seven years, but it was uncontested on twenty-five occasions including fourteen [[Walkover (contest)|walkover]]s.

The Sussex Stakes became a 1-mile race for three-year-olds in 1878. The previous version had been overshadowed by both the [[Goodwood Cup]] and the [[Stewards' Cup (Great Britain)|Stewards' Cup]], but in its modified form it became the most prestigious race at Goodwood.

The event was opened to four-year-olds in 1960, and to horses aged five or older in 1975.

The race is currently held on the second day of the five-day Glorious Goodwood meeting.

'''XTERRA''' is a series of [[cross triathlon]] races, i.e. three-sport races which include [[swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[mountain bike|mountain biking]], and [[trail running]]. The XTERRA Global Tour is owned and produced by [http://www.teamunlimited.com/ TEAM Unlimited]. The XTERRA race series is the best-known series of cross triathlons, and is considered by most to be the ''de facto'' world championship of the sport.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

It began in 1996 on the Hawaiian island of [[Maui (island)|Maui]] as the ''Aquaterra'', and  was later renamed the ''XTERRA''. Japanese automaker [[Nissan Motors|Nissan]] licensed the name from the triathlon series for their own 1999-2015 [[Nissan Xterra|sport utility vehicle]] &amp;mdash; and was the race series' primary sponsor from 1998 to 2006, when the two companies parted ways.&lt;ref name="Nissan sponsors XTerra race "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/stories/1998/11/16/story7.html?page=all|title=Nissan names SUV after Maui triathlon|last=Zimmerman|first=Malia|date=November 15, 1998|publisher=Pacific Business News|accessdate=4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The XTERRA has two primary divisions, professional and "age-groupers". In the professional division athletes compete for cash prizes and sponsorships.  The age-group division was created for those who still want to compete but have no aspirations to become professional athletes. Both divisions compete in a points series, where athletes accumulate points by placing in the top fifteen positions of any race in which they compete.

Several events known as XTERRA Championships Series offer more points due to their larger draws. In the United States, there are championships for each region of the country. These venues also offer a "sport" version of the race where contestants complete races that are typically half the distance of the full version.

== Race format ==
As an off-road race, the distances can vary widely depending on the terrain available. The target distances are as follows:

*Championship/pro: 1.5&amp;nbsp;km swim, 30&amp;nbsp;km [[mountain biking]], 11&amp;nbsp;km trail run
*Sport:	500&amp;nbsp;m swim, 15&amp;nbsp;km [[mountain biking]], 5&amp;nbsp;km trail Run

In the [[United States]] the sport distances are often used as miles yielding a 1/2 mile (805&amp;nbsp;m) swim, 15 mile (24&amp;nbsp;km) mountain bike, and a 5-mile (8-km) trail run.

'''Zone defense''' is a type of defense, used in [[team sport]]s, which is the alternative to [[man-to-man defense]]; instead of each player guarding a corresponding player on the other team, each defensive player is given an area (a zone) to cover.

A zone defense can be used in many sports where defensive players guard players on the other team. Zone defenses and zone principles are commonly used in [[basketball]], [[American football]], [[association football]], [[ice hockey]], [[lacrosse]], [[Australian rules football]], [[netball]] and [[ultimate (sport)|ultimate]] among others.

==Basketball==
{{unreferencedsection|date=December 2017}}
The names given to zone defenses start with the number of players on the front of the zone (farthest from the goal) followed by the numbers of players in the rear zones. For example, in a [[2-3 Zone Defense|2–3 zone]] two defenders cover areas in the top of the zone (near the top of the key) while three defenders cover areas near the baseline.

[[Match-up zone defense|Match-up zone]] is a hybrid man-to-man and zone defense in which players apply man-to-man defense to whichever opposing player enters their area. [[John Chaney (basketball, born 1932)|John Chaney]], former head coach of [[Temple University]], is the most famous proponent of this defense. Hybrid defenses also include [[Box-and-one defense|Box-and-one]], in which four defenders are in a 2–2 zone and one defender guards a specific player on the offense. A variant of this is [[Triangle and Two Defense|triangle-and-two]], in which three defenders are in a 2–1 zone and two defenders guard two specific offensive players. 

Zone defenses are common in international, college, and youth competition. In the [[National Basketball Association]], zone defenses were prohibited until the 2001–2002 season, and most teams do not use them as a primary defensive strategy. The NBA has a [[defensive three-second violation]] rule, which makes it more difficult for teams to play zone, since such defenses usually position a player in the middle of the key to stop penetration.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sportingcharts.com/dictionary/nba/defensive-three-second-violation.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dallas Mavericks]] under coach [[Rick Carlisle]] are an example of an NBA team that have regularly used zone defenses.

===History of basketball zone defense===
{{unreferencedsection|date=December 2017}}
Frank Lindley, [[Newton High School (Kansas)|Newton, KS High School]] basketball coach from 1914 to 1945, was among the first to use the zone defense and other innovations in the game and authored numerous books about basketball. He finished his career with a record of 594–118 and guided the Railroaders to ten state titles and seven second-place finishes. [[Jim Boeheim]], coach of the [[Syracuse Orange men's basketball]] team, is famous for using a 2-3 zone that is among the best in the [[NCAA]]. His zone, which typically features athletic, disruptive, and aggressive defenders, has become a prototype for use on other teams including the [[United States men's national basketball team]], where he has spent time as an assistant coach.

===Advantages===
{{unreferencedsection|date=December 2017}}
Some of the reasons for using a zone defense are:

* The opposing team has a player/players too quick (in the case of guards) or too big (in the case of forwards or centers) for a man-to-man defense to be effective.
* Many zones pack defenders in the lane but allow the offensive team to take long-range shots. If the opponents are poor long-range shooters, a zone can be very effective.
* Unless trapping is involved, zone defenses typically don't involve aggressive pressure on the ball handler and allow the offensive team to easily pass the ball around the perimeter. This can allow the offense to use more time before a shot is attempted, an advantage for teams wanting to slow the tempo of a game.
* A poor defensive player can often be "hidden" in a zone because teammates can more easily help if he or she is beaten.
* A zone can help players in danger of fouling out by taking pressure off them.
* Playing a zone is less tiring and thus can help teams suffering from fatigue.
* To prevent easy scores when the ball is in-bounded under the basket.
* Against teams with inexperienced guards, trapping zones can disrupt the offense and force turnovers

===Disadvantages===
{{unreferencedsection|date=December 2017}}
Playing a zone entails some risks.

* Zones tend to be weak on the perimeter, so they are not very effective against teams with good outside shooters.
* Zones have gaps (areas that are not well-covered by defenders) that can be exploited by teams that pass well or have guards capable of penetrating the zone.
* If a team is behind in the game, playing a zone can be a poor strategy because zones usually allow the offense to take more time off the clock on each possession, which limits the time remaining for the losing team to reduce the lead. It also reduces the chances of stealing the ball from the attackers and attempting a quick counterstrike across open field.  This is not always true; there are pressure zone defenses that can often cause quicker shots by the opponent or result in turnovers.
* When a shot is attempted, it is often harder for players in a zone to find counterparts to box out for the rebound, which sometimes results in an offensive player getting an easy offensive rebound.
* Zone defenses require a commitment to scheming and practicing zone, both from coaches and players. While most players are familiar with playing zone defense, they are sometimes not expert in the nuances of the zone, such as spacing, which require familiarity and experience. When man-to-man teams switch to the zone defense, it is sometimes seen as a gimmick that is easily exploited by disciplined teams.

===Attacking a zone defense===
{{unreferencedsection|date=December 2017}}
While strategies for countering zone defenses vary and often depend on the strengths and weaknesses of both the offensive and defensive teams, there are some general principles that are typically used by offensive teams when facing a zone.

* Many popular zones (such as the 2–3, 3-2 and 1–2–2) have a gap in the middle of the lane. Getting the ball in this area can be very effective because the defense is often forced to "collapse" on the ball handler, freeing up other players for open shots. To exploit this gap, many teams assign a forward to operate in the "high post" area near the free throw line to catch and distribute the ball. A forward in the high post area can also set screens on the players at the top of the zone to allow penetration by the guards.
* Quick passing is an important element of attacking any zone. The defense will shift as the ball moves, but if the offense can move the ball faster than the defense can react, open shots can result. Quick passing against a zone often leads to open [[Three-point field goal|three-point shot]]s, and zone defenses are less effective against teams with good three-point shooters.
* Dribble penetration is very effective in breaking down a zone. If a guard can dribble into the gaps in the zone, multiple defenders must converge on the ball. The ball handler can then often pass to an open teammate for a shot. This strategy illustrates why preventing dribble penetration is important in playing an effective zone defense.
* Passing the ball to the interior of the zone can have similar effects as dribble penetration: as the defense collapses, a quick kick-out to the perimeter can result in either an open shot or continued quick passing, as the defense is now imbalanced.
* Short Corner: Attacking the "Short Corner", or baseline area behind the defense outside the lane, against a 2-3 zone puts the defense in rotation and opens up the mid post.
* Screening the backside of the zone: this opens up weakside shooters off a skip pass or ball rotation.

{{main|Zone defense in American football}}
Zone defense in [[American football]] refers to a type of "pass coverage". See [[American football strategy#Defensive strategy|American football defensive strategy]] and [[zone blocking]].

==Australian rules football==
The zone defence tactic, borrowed from basketball, was introduced into Australian football in the late 1980s by [[Robert Walls]] and revolutionized the game. It was used most effectively by [[Essendon Football Club]] coach [[Kevin Sheedy (Australian footballer)|Kevin Sheedy]].

The tactic is used from the [[fullback (Australian rules football)|fullback]] kick in after a behind is scored. The side in opposition to the player kicking in places their forward players, including their [[full-forward]] and centre half forward, in evenly spaced zones in the back 50-metre arc. This makes it easier for them to block leading players and forces the kick in to be more precise, in effect increasing the margin for error which can cause a turnover and another shot at goal. As a result, the best ways to break the zone are for the full-back to bomb it long (over 50 meters), often requiring a low percentage torpedo punt, or to play a short chipping game out of defence and then to switch play as opposition players break the zone. The latter has negated the effectiveness of the tactic since the 1990s.

Another kick-in technique is the ''[[huddle]]'', often used before the zone, which involves all of the players from the opposition team to the player is kicking in huddling together and then breaking in different directions. The kicker typically aims in whichever direction that the designated target (typically the [[Ruckman (Australian rules football position)|ruckman]]) runs in.

==Ice hockey==
In [[ice hockey]], players defend zones in the [[neutral zone trap]] and [[left wing lock]].

==Netball==
[[Netball]] is a sport similar to basketball with similar strategies and tactics employed, although with seven players per team. Zone defense is one of the main defensive strategies employed by teams, along with one-on-one defense. Common variants include center-court block, box-and-two zone, diamond-and-two zone, box-out zone and split-circle zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Jane Woodlands-Thompson|Jane Woodlands]] |title=The Netball Handbook |publisher=Human Kinetics |year=2006 |pages=131–4 |isbn=0736062653}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ultimate==
{{main|Ultimate_(sport)#Zone_defense}}
[[Ultimate (sport)|Ultimate]] allows for a number of zone defence tactics, usually employed in poor (such as windy, rainy or snowy) conditions, to discourage long passes and slow the progress of the opposition's movement.

'''Žalgiris Stadium''' ({{lang-lt|Žalgirio stadionas}}) was a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Žirmūnai elderate]] of [[Vilnius]], [[Lithuania]]. The stadium holds 15,029 and was being used by the first division [[I Lyga]] - REO Vilnius. It was the largest football stadium in Lithuania and was built on the desecrated graves of Jews interred in the Old Jewish Cemetery under the stadium.  

It is named after the [[Battle of Grunwald]] and was rebuilt by the [[Wehrmacht|German POW]]s after [[World War II]] and finished in 1950 (the stadium existed already before World War II and was used by Pogoń Wilno; in 1936 the Polish athletics championships were held at the stadium).

After independence it was used by the [[Lithuania national football team]], but in recent years it lost its meaning as the [[national stadium]] and all the international [[Football (soccer)|football]] matches were played either at [[S.Dariaus ir S.Girėno Stadium]] in [[Kaunas]] or at the newer [[LFF Stadium]] also in [[Vilnius]].

In 2015, the stadium was sold to Lithuanian real estate company [[:lt:Hanner|Hanner]] who planned to demolish it and make way for apartments, hotel and offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arvydas Avulis perka Žalgirio stadioną, jo vietoje statys namų už 200 mln. eurų|url=http://www.15min.lt/verslas/naujiena/bendroves/arvydas-avulis-perka-zalgirio-stadiona-jo-vietoje-statys-namu-uz-200-mln-euru-663-500791|website=15min.lt|language=lt|date=May 4, 2016|accessdate=July 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
