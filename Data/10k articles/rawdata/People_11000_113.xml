'''Agustín Millán Vivero''' (July 24, 1879 in [[Texcaltitlán]] – March 18, 1920) was a [[Mexico|Mexican]] general and politician.

== Biography ==
Millán moved to [[Orizaba]], when he was 20 years old, where he worked as a carpenter. In 1909, during the beginning [[Mexican Revolution|revolution in Mexico]], he joined the [[Partido Antirreeleccionista]] (Anti-Reelection party), and supported [[Francisco I. Madero]]. In 1913 he fought in the rank of a second lieutenant&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.fortunecity.es/milo2/AMV.htm ''Gral. Agustín Millán Vivero''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110123062032/http://members.fortunecity.es/milo2/AMV.htm |date=January 23, 2011 }} (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; under General [[Cándido Aguilar]] (División de Oriente) against [[Victoriano Huerta]], who substituted him temporarily as military commander and as [[governor of Veracruz]] in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Mexico_states2.html#Veracruz ''States of Mexico M-Z - Veracruz'']&lt;/ref&gt; On June 30, 1917, in the rank of a [[Brigadier General]], he followed [[Carlos Tejada]] as [[Governor of the State of Mexico]], supported by the Club Democrático Progresista. During this period, he was two times absent because of military reasons. The first time, [[Joaquín García Luna]] acted in place of him from September 6, 1918, to March 4, 1919. When the [[Plan of Agua Prieta|rebellion in Agua Prieta]] exploded, he accompanied President [[Venustiano Carranza]]. At this time, [[Francisco Javier Gaxiola]] acted in place of him from September 11, 1919, to March 8, 1920. Millán became injured in the battle actions.&lt;ref&gt;Gerardo Novo Valencia: [http://www.oem.com.mx/elsoldetoluca/notas/s759.htm ''El centro deportivo Agustín Millán''] (Spanish), October 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his bad physical constitution, [[Darío López]] became interim governor on March 13, a few days before Millán died in consequence of his injuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Mexico_states2.html ''States of Mexico M-Z - México  (Estado de México)'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alanis Obomsawin''', {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|OC|GOQ}} (born August 31, 1932) is an [[American Canadian]] [[Abenaki people|Abenaki]] filmmaker, singer, artist and activist primarily known for her documentaries .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.horizonzero.ca/textsite/witness.php?is=9&amp;file=17&amp;tlang=0|title=HorizonZero Issue 09 : WITNESS|website=www.horizonzero.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Born in [[New Hampshire]], United States and raised primarily in [[Quebec]], Canada, she has written and directed many [[National Film Board of Canada]] documentaries on [[First Nations]] issues.

Obomsawin's described "the basic purpose [of my films] is for our people to have a voice[...] no matter what we're talking about whether it has to do with having our existence recognised, or whether it has to do with speaking about our values, our survival, our beliefs, that we belong to something beautiful, that it's O.K. to be an Indian, to be a native person in this country."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gendering the Nation : Canadian Women's Cinema|last=Pick|first=Zuzana|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=1999|isbn=|editor-last=Banning|editor-first=Kass|location=Toronto, Canada|pages=78|chapter=Storytelling and Resistance: The Documentary Practice of Alanis Obomsawin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her best known documentary is  ''[[Kanehsatake: 270 Years of Resistance]]'', about the 1990 [[Oka crisis|Oka Crisis, Quebec]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

== Early life ==
Obomsawin was born in New Hampshire on Abenaki Territory. When she was six months old, her mother returned to the [[Odanak]] reserve north east of Montreal where she lived until she was 7. During this period she lived with her mother's sister Jesse Benedict and her husband Levi who had six children of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=The Long Walk of Alanis Obomsawin|last=Alioff|first=Maurice|date=June 1987|work=Canada Cinema|access-date=|last2=Schouten Levine|first2=Susan|issue=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Théophile Panadis, her mother's cousin, initiated her into the history of the Abenaki Nation and taught her many songs and legends. Obomsawin and her parents then left Odanak for [[Trois-Rivières]], where they were the only Native family. Cut off, speaking little French and no English, Obomsawin held fast to the songs and stories she had learned on the reserve.

After moving to [[Montreal]] in the late 1950s, having learned English during a two-year stay in [[Florida]], she performed as a singer and a storyteller, making appearances on reservations, in prisons and schools, and at music festivals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She has one child, Kisos Obomsawin, born in 1969.

Obomsawin's 2014 documentary ''[[Trick or Treaty?]]'' was the first film by an indigenous filmmaker to screen in the Masters programme at the [[2014 Toronto International Film Festival|Toronto International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name=Walker/&gt; Obomsawin began conceptualizing the film in 2010 when she was invited by Stan Louttit, Grand Chief of the [[Mushkegowuk Council]], to film a conference the band was hosting about [[Treaty No. 9]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Alanis Obomsawin brings "Trick or Treaty" to Studio Q|url = http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2640853386|website = CBC Player|date = 2014-12-17|accessdate = 2015-12-04|language = en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her 2012 documentary ''[[The People of the Kattawapiskak River]]'' on the [[Attawapiskat First Nation#Housing and infrastructure crisis|Attawapiskat housing crisis]] was conceived when Obomsawin was present in the community in 2011, working on another film for the NFB.&lt;ref name="Dunlevy"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/movie-guide/RIDM+People+Kattawapiskak+River+examines/7519138/story.html|title=The People of the Kattawapiskak River examines a community on the edge|last=Dunlevy|first=T'cha|date=9 November 2012|work=[[Montreal Gazette]]|publisher=Postmedia Network Inc.|accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obomsawin's recent credits include ''[[Gene Boy Came Home]],'' about Aboriginal [[Vietnam War]] veteran Eugene Benedict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfb.ca/collection/films/fiche/?id=54549 NFB collections page]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, she completed ''WABAN-AKI: People from Where the Sun Rises'' a look at the people and stories from her home reserve of [[Odanak]]. In 2005, Ms Obomsawin completed her short drama ''Sigwan'', following a young girl who is aided by the animals of the forest. Her 2003 NFB documentary ''Our Nationhood'', chronicles the determination and tenacity of the [[Listuguj Mi'gmaq First Nation]] to use and manage the natural resources of their traditional lands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfb.ca/enclasse/doclens/visau/index.php?mode=view&amp;filmId=51406&amp;language=english&amp;sort=title  NFB collections page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927230012/http://www.nfb.ca/enclasse/doclens/visau/index.php?mode=view&amp;filmId=51406&amp;language=english&amp;sort=title |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mi'gmaq of Esgenoopetitj ([[Burnt Church]]), [[New Brunswick]] were the subject of her 2002 documentary, ''Is the Crown at war with us?'', exploring a conflict with the Department of Fisheries and non-native fishers over fishing rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfb.ca/enclasse/doclens/visau/index.php?mode=view&amp;filmId=51067&amp;language=english&amp;sort=title NFB collections page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930201659/http://www.nfb.ca/enclasse/doclens/visau/index.php?mode=view&amp;filmId=51067&amp;language=english&amp;sort=title |date=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2000 NFB release ''Rocks at Whiskey Trench'' was Obomsawin's fourth film in her series about the 1990 Oka crisis. The first, ''[[Kanehsatake: 270 Years of Resistance]]'' (1993), was a feature-length film documenting the 1990 Mohawk uprising in Kanehsatake and Oka, which has won 18 international awards. It was followed by ''My Name is Kahentiiosta'' (1995), a film about a young Kahnawake Mohawk woman who was arrested after the 78-day armed standoff, and ''Spudwrench – Kahnawake Man'' (1997), profiling Randy Horne, a high-steel worker from the [[mohawk nation|Mohawk]] community of [[Kahnawake]]. 
 
Obomsawin's films also include: ''[[Incident at Restigouche]]'' (1984), a powerful depiction of the Quebec police raid of a Micmac reserve; ''[[Richard Cardinal: Cry from a Diary of a Métis Child]]'' (1986), the disturbing examination of an adolescent suicide; ''No Address'' (1988), a look at Montreal's homeless; as well as ''Mother of Many Children'' (1977).

Obomsawin first came to the attention of the NFB in the mid-1960s, when she held fundraising concerts to pay for the construction of a swimming pool in Odanak. Children in her community were no longer able to swim in the [[Saint Francis River (Canada–United States)|Saint Francis River]], but were not allowed to use a pool in a neighbouring community, which was for white residents only. Obomsawin's success in raising funds for a construction of a pool for Odanak children was interviewed about it by the [[CBC-TV]]'s ''[[Telescope (TV series)|Telescope]]'' series, which was seen by NFB producers [[Joe Koenig]] and Bob Verrall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tiff.net/the-review/for-150-years-people-have-been-told-lies-about-canadas-history/|title="For 150 years, people have been told lies about Canada's history"|last=Obomsawin|first=Alanis|date=2017-03-27|work=The Review|access-date=2017-03-28|publisher=Toronto International Film Festival|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/aboriginal/alanis-obomsawin-passes-knowledge-to-aspiring-filmmakers-1.2953663|title=Alanis Obomsawin passes knowledge to aspiring filmmakers|last=Taylor|first=Jillian|date=14 February 2015|work=CBC News|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"It was from there the National Film Board (NFB) saw it and I was invited by some producers to talk to some of the filmmakers there," said Obomsawin. "I discovered that they had a studio that only catered to [the] classroom, with educational film strips."

They invited the singer/storyteller to the Film Board to work as an advisor on a film about Aboriginal people. She went on to direct films of her own, while continuing to perform and fight for justice for her people.

Obomsawin is a member of [[Film Fatales]] independent women filmmakers.

==Non-film work==

Bancroft struggled with [[dyslexia]] from an early age, but she nevertheless graduated High School and was accepted at the University of Oregon where she graduated with a Physical Education Degree in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://dyslexia.yale.edu/story/ann-bancroft/|title=Ann Bancroft, Polar Explorer - Yale Dyslexia|work=Yale Dyslexia|access-date=2018-05-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="around.uoregon.edu"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://around.uoregon.edu/ann-bancroft|title=Ann Bancroft|date=2017-03-09|work=Around the O|access-date=2018-05-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bancroft was a camper and staff member at YMCA [[Camp Widjiwagan]] in Ely, MN.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ymcamn.org/camps/camp_widjiwagan|title=Camp Widjiwagan|website=YMCA Twin Cities|language=en|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bancroft also taught Physical Education and Special Education in St. Paul and Minneapolis, Minnesota.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Bancroft became a wilderness instructor and a gym teacher in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]] (at Clara Barton Open School) and [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]].

Ann Bancroft founded the Ann Bancroft Foundation in 1991.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Ann Bancroft foundation supports the Wilderness Inquiry group and Bancroft currently teaches at Wilderness Inquiry.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.annbancroftfoundation.org/about-us/about-abf/|title=Ann Bancroft Foundation :: About Ann|website=www.annbancroftfoundation.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Wilderness Inquiry group allows individuals and families to go on outdoor adventures, and the adventures are open to people of all ability levels. Bancroft currently co-owns an exploration company, [http://www.yourexpedition.com Bancroft Arnesen Explore], with [[Liv Arnesen]].  Bancroft has been on expeditions on the Ganges River in India, crossed Greenland, traveled to the North Pole, and crossed the South Pole.

==Expeditions==
Bancroft gave up her physical education and special education teaching posts in 1986 in order to participate with the "[[Will Steger]] International North Pole Expedition". She arrived at the [[North Pole]] together with five other team members after 56 days using [[dogsled]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.minnpost.com/community-voices/2011/05/remembering-north-pole-trek-1986-and-looking-forward-anniversary-celebratio|title=Remembering the North Pole trek of 1986 -- and looking forward to the anniversary celebration|work=MinnPost|access-date=2018-05-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made Bancroft the first woman to reach the [[North Pole]] on foot and by sled.

She was also the first woman to cross both polar ice caps to reach the North and South Poles, as well as the first woman to ski across Greenland.&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://klobuchar.senate.gov/newsreleases_detail.cfm?id=278587&amp; |title=Senator Amy Klobuchar |publisher=Klobuchar.senate.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327164606/http://klobuchar.senate.gov/newsreleases_detail.cfm?id=278587&amp; |archivedate=2012-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992-1993, Bancroft led a four-woman expedition to the [[South Pole]] on skis; this expedition was the first all-female expedition to cross the ice to the South Pole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://keynotespeakers.com/speaker_detail.php?speakerid=3214 |title=Ann Bancroft - Speaker Profile |publisher=Keynotespeakers.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Ann and Norwegian adventurer [[Liv Arnesen]] became the first women to ski across Antarctica.&lt;ref name="bare_url"/&gt;

In March 2007, Bancroft and [[Liv Arnesen]] took part in a trek across the Arctic Ocean to draw attention to the problem of global warming.

'''Cassandra Ainsworth''' is a [[fictional character]] in the television series ''[[Skins (TV series)|Skins]]'', portrayed by [[Hannah Murray]].

==Characterization and creation==
{{quote|She's thin, she's blonde, she says "wow" a lot.|[[Nicholas Hoult]] as [[Tony Stonem]], "Final Goodbyes" (Series 2)}}
Cassie is depicted as being eccentric and suffering from several mental disorders — most notably, [[anorexia nervosa]] — and multiple issues, including low self-esteem, [[suicidal ideation]], and [[drug addiction]].&lt;ref name="digitalspy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/a41979/skins-star-hannah-murray.html|title='Skins' star Hannah Murray|last=Wilkes|first=Neil|author2=Murray, Hannah|date=28 January 2007|accessdate=2 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray described her character as...

{{quote|...very interesting because she has a lot of problems, and she's very troubled, and she's anorexic and completely lacking in self-esteem and self-belief, but along with that she's sort of quite smart. I think that she has quite a good reading on a lot of the other characters about what they're like and how they work and stuff, and I think she's a very clever girl, and she's also kind of silly and dreamy and quite fun at the same time as being a very tragic character.|Hannah Murray|3=Interview with [[Digital Spy]]&lt;ref name="digitalspy" /&gt;}}
The titular [[Cassie (Skins series 1)|second episode of the first series]] and the penultimate episode of the second series focus on Cassie; the former focuses on her mental state and the latter focuses on her relationship with roommate [[Chris Miles (Skins)|Chris Miles]] ([[Joe Dempsie]]). The show's producers and writers described her centric episode in an interview with ''[[The Independent]]'' as being about "how she gets through her day without eating ... how she feels and what her tactics are", and campaigned to prevent any announcement of any [[Telephone counseling|counselling helplines]] during the episode's credits because they "didn't want a little preachy drama where everyone hugs at the end"; instead, the producers hoped that people would recognize their own faults in Cassie.&lt;ref name="downwiththekids"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/teen-dramas-down-with-the-kids-424525.html|title= Teen dramas: Down with the kids|date=16 November 2006|publisher=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=2 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reviewer described Cassie as being "as pale as ''[[Hamlet]]''{{'}}s [[Ophelia (character)|Ophelia]] and arguably twice as mad".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southcoasttoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080816/LIFE/808160316/-1/ENTERTAIN|title=Dishing on fashion; teens behaving badly|work=[[South Coast Today]]|last=McDonough|first=Kevin|accessdate=2009-08-20|date=2008-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''''

The viewer is reintroduced to Cassie five years after series two in ''[[Skins Pure|Pure]]'', in which she is shown to have changed in many ways. Where before she was bubbly, cheerful and unashamedly quirky, she is now a shadow of her former self, appearing tired and withdrawn, living in a shared flat in London and working as a waitress in a café to make ends meet. She avoids social contact with her co-workers and flatmates, and refuses to take drugs when offered them (as opposed to her affinity towards them in the past), and secludes herself in her room. There is (season 4 episode 2) a drawing which strongly resembles Cassie posted at the front of Sophia's room. This could be a joke made by the producers of the show.

==Character history==

=== Series 1 ===
At [[Tony (Skins series 1)|the beginning]] of the first series, Cassie is recently discharged from hospital after a suicide attempt off-screen. Her friend [[Michelle Richardson]] ([[April Pearson]]) arranges for her to take [[Sid Jenkins]]' ([[Mike Bailey (actor)|Mike Bailey]]) virginity at a party. The two talk and even briefly kiss, although Cassie reveals she took a "shit load" of pills and passes out. The gang leave the party in order to get her to the hospital, although as soon as Tony parks up, she regains consciousness.

[[Cassie (Skins series 1)|Cassie's central episode]] develops her eating disorder; her sexually-stimulated parents are introduced, who are usually too busy having sex in order to pay attention to her issues. She informs them that it is her last clinic day. She is then picked up by the clinic taxi driver, Allan, with whom she seems to have a close relationship, and he promises not to tell anyone Cassie has put weights in her underwear in order to fool the clinic into thinking she has gained weight. She is sent to her final group therapy, where fellow patient Madison Twatter tells the group about a student named Sid Jenkins who has not paid him back for the drugs he supplied Sid with. 

In college, Cassie runs into Sid at the canteen, and they talk. Having developed a crush on him on the previous episode, she reveals to him how she is able to get away with hiding the fact that she is not eating, but he is not impressed with it, and protests. When she states that "no-one cares," he responds "I care." Cassie also warns Sid that Mad also has his ID card. Throughout the episode, Cassie keeps seeing the word 'EAT!' on post-it notes, the plate of chips that Sid gives her and on text messages. This is implied to be a hallucination as when she asks Sid about it (assuming he sent the texts), Sid proves that he has not texted her. Cassie then calls Allan. She tells him someone keeps telling her to eat, and he suggests she is imagining the texts because she is mentally sending them to herself, because she wants to eat. Cassie gives in and eats a burger as the episode closes.

In "[[Chris (Skins series 1)|Chris]]", Cassie gives Sid more hints about her affection towards him and asks him on a date. However, in "[[Sid (Skins series 1)|Sid]]", he is grounded so Cassie tells him she will come over to his house. However, she is stood up due to [[Tony Stonem]] ([[Nicholas Hoult]]) convincing Sid to accompany him and Michelle at his choir performance, and when Sid admits he was with Michelle, Cassie lashes out at him. Later on she attempts suicide by intaking a large amount of pills mixed with vodka. When Sid tries to visit her in hospital, [[Jal Fazer]] ([[Larissa Wilson]]) forces him to leave. In "[[Michelle (Skins series 1)|Michelle]]", Sid visits rehab in order to make amends with Cassie and she accepts his apology, but Sid is dismayed when she reveals has a boyfriend, Simon ([[James Buckley (actor)|James Buckley]]).

In "[[Effy (Skins series 1)|Effy]]", Sid calls her late at night after a fight with Tony and the two kiss. However, Sid stands her up again to rescue Tony and his sister [[Effy Stonem|Effy]] ([[Kaya Scodelario]]) from an overdose. In the finale, her parents move with her to [[Elgin, Moray|Elgin]], Scotland. She postpones her plans after discovering Sid loves her through a letter he wrote at the beginning of the episode, and the series ends with the pair holding hands on the same park bench Cassie attempted suicide on. It is implied that Sid lost his virginity to her at the start of the second series.

=== Series 2 ===
In the second series, Cassie is in a long-distance relationship with Sid; the relationship becomes strained when Sid begins to think Cassie has been unfaithful. He angrily accuses her of cheating, mistaking her closeness with her gay Scottish friend. Sid smashes his laptop in frustration and it is left ambiguous whether they have broken up or not, though the next morning, Cassie has blocked Sid's mobile number. After Sid's father Mark ([[Peter Capaldi]]) dies, Sid travels to Scotland to meet her as Cassie simultaneously travels back to Bristol to meet Sid. Frustrated at Cassie's disappearance and emotionally confused by his father's death, Sid begins a relationship with Michelle in the latter's central episode, after she finds him at the edge of a cliff, possibly to attempt suicide. However, Cassie catches them kissing in Sid's bedroom and keeps a cool head, although it is shown to have a huge impact on her in the next few episodes.

As a result of Sid's relationship with Michelle, Cassie becomes extremely promiscuous (with men and women) and mentally unstable: in "Chris", her actions result in her roommate [[Chris Miles (Skins)|Chris Miles]] ([[Joe Dempsie]]) losing his job as a junior property salesman and cause a significant amount of tension between him and his girlfriend [[Jal Fazer]] ([[Larissa Wilson]]) after Angie, Chris' ex-girlfriend and psychology teacher returns to Bristol; and in "Effy", she attributes her addiction to "mindless sex" to her failed relationship with Sid. After Sid becomes aware of her actions, he confronts her about her promiscuity, apologises for dating Michelle, and tells her he loves her. They reconcile.

Cassie's subplot in Chris' last three episodes of series 2 focuses on her friendship with him. She witnesses Chris suffering from two [[subarachnoid haemorrhage]]s, the second fatal, taking his life in Cassie's central episode. She is traumatized and flees to New York City. There, she meets a kind young [[Iowa]]n named Adam (Stephen Michael Kane), with whom she forms a strong platonic friendship when he offers her a place to stay in his apartment. He later leaves the apartment to find his ex-girlfriend at Cassie's suggestion and, distraught, Cassie gets a job as a waitress at Adam's old diner in [[Manhattan]]. The ultimate scene of the second series depicts Sid wandering through [[Times Square]] looking for her and ends with him turning to look inside the diner.

=== Series 6 ===
Cassie is briefly referred to by [[List of recurring Skins characters|Doug]] in series 6 when he mentions to [[Liv Malone|Liv]] that he once danced for a girl to help her get through an exam, referring to Cassie's centric episode in the second series. However he does not mention her by name.

=== Series 7 ===
Cassie is revisited five years later in series 7 in a feature-length episode, ''[[Skins Pure|Pure]]''. It is revealed that Sid did indeed find her and that the pair spent several years travelling around America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=Skins|author=Skins|number=359410819370467329|date=22 July 2013|title=@molx69 We decided that the stories should be about 1 character in a different time of their life. Cassie explains about Sid in ep.1 of Pure}}&lt;/ref&gt; although she does not mention him by name. After ending the relationship, she moved back to England, though she moves into a shared flat in London instead of heading back to her hometown. She works as a waitress in a café, and later discovers a website titled 'Oblivion', filled with candid shots of her.

'''Charles Ormond Eames, Jr.''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|iː|m|z}} (1907–1978) and '''Bernice Alexandra "Ray" Kaiser Eames''' (1912–1988) were an American design married couple who made significant historical contributions to the development of [[modern architecture]] and [[modern furniture|furniture]]. Among their most well-known designs is the [[Eames Lounge Chair]]. They also worked in the fields of industrial and [[graphic design]], [[fine art]], and [[film]]. Ray Kaiser Eames and Charles Eames worked together as creative partners.

==Charles Eames==
'''Charles Ormond Eames, Jr.''', (June 17, 1907 – August 21, 1978) was an American designer, architect and film maker. In creative partnership with his spouse Ray Kaiser Eames he is responsible for groundbreaking contributions in the field of architecture, furniture design, industrial design, manufacturing and the photographic arts. He briefly studied architecture at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] on an architecture scholarship. After two years of study, he left the university. Many sources claim that he was dismissed for his advocacy of  [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and his interest in modern architects. The university reportedly dropped him because of his "too modern" views.&lt;ref name=SmartFurniture&gt;{{cite web|title=Charles Eames|url=http://www.smartfurniture.com/hermanmiller/designers/eames/charleseames.html|website=SmartFurniture Herman Miller Designers|accessdate=22 June 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622204840/http://www.smartfurniture.com/hermanmiller/designers/eames/charleseames.html|archivedate=22 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other sources, less frequently cited, note that while a student, Charles Eames also was employed as an architect at the firm of Trueblood and Graf.&lt;ref name="architecture sk"&gt;{{cite web|title=Charles Ormond Eames: Architect Biography|url=http://architect.architecture.sk/charles-ormond-eames-architect/charles-ormond-eames-architect.php|website=Famous Architects|accessdate=22 June 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110706122817/http://architect.architecture.sk/charles-ormond-eames-architect/charles-ormond-eames-architect.php|archivedate=6 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The demands on his time from this employment and from his classes led to sleep-deprivation and diminished performance at the university.

While at Washington University, he met his first wife, Catherine Woermann, whom he married in 1929. A year later, they had a daughter, Lucia Jenkins.

In 1930, Charles began his own architectural practice in St. Louis with partner Charles Gray. They were later joined by a third partner, Walter Pauley.

Charles Eames was greatly influenced by the Finnish architect [[Eliel Saarinen]] (whose son [[Eero Saarinen|Eero]], also an architect, would become a partner and friend). At the elder Saarinen's invitation, Charles moved in 1938 with his wife Catherine and daughter Lucia to [[Michigan]], to further study architecture at the [[Cranbrook Academy of Art]], where he would become a teacher and head of the [[industrial design]] department. In order to apply for the Architecture and Urban Planning Program, Eames defined an area of focus—the St. Louis waterfront. Together with Eero Saarinen he designed prize-winning furniture for [[New York City|New York's]] [[Museum of Modern Art]] "Organic Design in Home Furnishings" competition.&lt;ref&gt;Eliot F. Noyes. ''Organic Design in Home Furnishings.'' Museum of Modern Art. 1941.&lt;/ref&gt; Their work displayed the new technique of wood moulding (originally developed by [[Alvar Aalto]]), that Eames would further develop in many moulded [[plywood]] products, including [[chair]]s and other [[furniture]], splints and stretchers for the [[US Navy]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra Griffith Winton.

The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Accessed 12 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, Charles and Catherine divorced, and he married his Cranbrook colleague Bernice ("Ray") Kaiser, who was born in Sacramento, California. He then moved with her to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], where they worked and lived until their deaths. In the late 1940s, as part of the ''[[Arts &amp; Architecture]]'' magazine's "[[Case Study Houses|Case Study]]" program, the Eameses designed and built the groundbreaking [[Eames House]], Case Study House #8, as their home. Located upon a cliff overlooking the [[Pacific Ocean]] and hand-constructed within a matter of days entirely of pre-fabricated steel parts intended for [[Construction#Industrial construction|industrial construction]], it remains a milestone of [[modern architecture]].

Charles Eames died of a heart attack on August 21, 1978, while on a consulting trip in his native Saint Louis, and was buried in the [[Calvary Cemetery (St. Louis)|Calvary Cemetery]] there. He now has a star on the [[St. Louis Walk of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;

===Philosophy===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Eames-design process.jpg|thumb|right|A sketch by Charles Eames illustrating the Eames design Process]] --&gt;

In 1970 and 1971, Charles Eames gave the [[Charles Eliot Norton Lectures]] at [[Harvard University]]. At the lectures, the Eames viewpoint and philosophy are related through Charles' own telling of what he called "the banana leaf parable", a [[banana leaf]] being the most basic eating utensil in southern India. He related the progression of design and its process where the banana leaf is transformed into something fantastically ornate. He explains the next step and ties it to the design process by finishing the parable with:
{{quote|But you can go beyond that and the guys that have not only means, but a certain amount of knowledge and understanding, go the next step and they eat off of a banana leaf. And I think that in these times when we fall back and regroup, that somehow or other, the banana leaf parable sort of got to get working there, because I'm not prepared to say that the banana leaf that one eats off of is the same as the other eats off of, but it's that process that has happened within the man that changes the banana leaf. And as we attack these problems—and I hope and I expect that the total amount of energy used in this world is going to go from high to medium to a little bit lower—the banana leaf idea might have a great part in it.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Eames.

==Ray Kaiser Eames==
'''Ray-Bernice Alexandra Kaiser Eames''', [[née]] '''Kaiser''' (December 15, 1912 – August 21, 1988), was an American artist, [[design]]er, and [[film]]maker. In creative partnership with her spouse Charles Eames she was responsible for groundbreaking contributions in the field of architecture, furniture design, industrial design, manufacturing and the photographic arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=""|first1=Library of Congress, Exhibitions|title=The Work of Charles and Ray Eames: A Legacy of Invention|url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/eames/bio.html|website=Library of Congress|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=8 March 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329010423/http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/eames/bio.html|archivedate=29 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was born in Sacramento, California to Alexander and Edna Burr Kaiser, and had a brother named Maurice. She spent her early childhood years with her parents in their apartment, and then moved to a bungalow outside of the town. Her parents taught her the quality of enjoyment which later led to inventions in furniture design and toys. Her parents also instilled the value of enjoyment of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kirkham|first=Pat|title=Charles and Ray Eames : designers of the twentieth century|date=1995|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass|isbn=9780262111997|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After having lived in a number of cities during her youth and after her father's death, in 1933 she graduated from [[Bennett College (New York)|Bennett Women's College]] in [[Millbrook, New York]], and moved to New York City, where she studied [[Abstract expressionism|abstract expressionist]] painting with [[Hans Hofmann]]. She was a founder of the [[American Abstract Artists]] group in 1936 and displayed paintings in their first show a year later in 1937 at [[Riverside Museum]] in Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artcyclopedia.com/artists/eames_ray.html Ray Eames – Founding member of the American Abstract Artists group, 1936 artcyclopedia, (accessed April 1, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;  One of her paintings is in the permanent collection of The [[Whitney Museum of American Art]].  Ray lived alone in New York City until she was called home to be with her ailing mother, who died in 1940.

In September 1940, Ben Baldwin, an architect and friend, recommended that she should begin studies at the [[Cranbrook Academy of Art]] in [[Bloomfield Hills, Michigan]]. She learned a variety of arts, not limiting herself to abstract painting. She worked with [[Harry Bertoia]], [[Eero Saarinen]], Charles Eames, and others on the display panels for the exhibition "Organic Design in Home Furnishings" at [[Museum of Modern Art]].&lt;ref name="Women in Graphic Design"&gt;{{cite book|title=Women in Graphic Design|publisher=Jovis, Berlin|page=437|isbn=9783868591538}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ray married Charles Eames in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McAleer |first=Margaret H. |title=Charles Eames and Ray Eames Papers: A Finding Aid to the Collection in the Library of Congress |url=http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/eadmss.ms998024.3 |website=Library of Congress |page=4 |access-date=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Settling in Los Angeles, California, Charles and Ray Eames began an outstanding career in design and architecture.

The design process between Ray and Charles was strongly collaborative. After marriage the couple moved to California to continue their [[molded plywood]] furniture design and, in a later period, plastic. The graphic and commercial artwork can be clearly attributed to Ray, she designed twenty-six cover designs for the journal [[Arts &amp; Architecture]] during 1942 to 1948, and a major part of the Eames furniture advertisements at [[Herman Miller (manufacturer)|Herman Miller]] (since 1948).&lt;ref name="Women in Graphic Design"/&gt;

In the late 1940s, Ray Eames created several textile designs, two of which, "Crosspatch" and "Sea Things", were produced by Schiffer Prints, a company that also produced textiles by [[Salvador Dalí]] and [[Frank Lloyd Wright]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eamesoffice.com/catalog-category/textiles/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=10 April 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319160756/http://www.eamesoffice.com/catalog-category/textiles/ |archivedate=19 March 2015 |df= }} Eames textiles (accessed April 1, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;   Two of her textile patterns were distinguished with awards in a textile competition (organized by MoMa). She worked on graphics for advertising, magazine covers, posters, timelines, game boards, invitations and business cards. Original examples of Ray Eames textiles can be found in many art museum collections. The Ray Eames textiles have been re-issued by [[Maharam (company)|Maharam]] as part of their Textiles of the Twentieth Century collection.

After Charles's death in 1978, the Eames Office was disbanded. Ray Eames worked on several unfinished projects (e.g. a German version of the ''Mathematica'' exhibition), was a consultant to [[IBM]], published books, and administered the Eames archive and estate.&lt;ref name="Women in Graphic Design"/&gt;

Ray Eames died in Los Angeles in 1988, ten years to the day after Charles. They are buried next to each other in [[Calvary Cemetery (St. Louis)|Calvary Cemetery]] in St. Louis.

{{Quote|Anything I can do, Ray can do better.&lt;ref name=beautiful/&gt;|Charles Eames}}

Ray Eames had a joyful and rigorous work ethic at the "Eames office". She called it "shop"- a place where they worked and did early production work. At the office, they employed local people, war veterans, and housewives. Eames office was a diversified workplace. The Eameses also believed in "learning by doing"- before introducing a new idea at the Eames Office, Charles and Ray explored needs and constraints of the idea extensively.

In the 1950s, the Eameses continued their work in architecture and [[modern furniture]] design.  As with their earlier [[molded plywood]] work, the Eameses pioneered technologies, such as  fiberglass furniture, plastic resin chairs, and the wire mesh chairs designed for [[Herman Miller (office equipment)|Herman Miller]]. From the beginning, the Eames furniture has usually been listed as by Charles Eames. In the 1948 and 1952 [[Herman Miller (office equipment)|Herman Miller]] bound catalogs, only Charles' name is listed, but it has become clear that Ray was deeply involved and was an equal partner with her husband in many projects. In August 2005 Maharam fabrics reissued Eames designed fabrics; Sea Things (1947) pattern and Dot Pattern.&lt;ref name=Sheers&gt;{{cite web|title=Maharam Sheers by Eames|url=http://www.maharam.com/press_releases/13|website=Maharam|accessdate=22 June 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623002334/http://www.maharam.com/press_releases/13|archivedate=23 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sea Things"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sea Things by Charles and Ray Eames, 1947|url=http://www.maharam.com/press_releases/24|website=Maharam|accessdate=22 June 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701173112/http://www.maharam.com/press_releases/24|archivedate=1 July 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dot Pattern was conceived for The Museum of Modern Art’s “Competition for Printed Fabrics” in 1947. The Eames fabrics were mostly designed by Ray, as were the Time-Life Stools.  In 1979, the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] awarded Charles and Ray with the [[Royal Gold Medal]].  At the time of Charles' death they were working on what became their last production, the Eames Sofa, which went into production in 1984.

Charles and Ray channeled Charles' interest in [[photography]] into the production of 125 [[short film]]s. From their first film, the unfinished ''Traveling Boy'' (1950), to ''[[Powers of Ten (film)|Powers of Ten]]'' (re-released in 1977), to their last film in 1982,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shop.eamesoffice.com/dvd-box-set.html|title=The Films of Charles and Ray Eames: Box Set|accessdate=22 June 2015|quote=Between 1950 and 1982, Charles and Ray Eames made over 125 short films ranging from 1-30 minutes in length...This 6-disc DVD set contains 39 films by the husband and wife team, including Powers of Ten, House: After 5 Years of Living, Design Q&amp;A, Tops, Eames Lounge Chair, Day of the Dead, Toccata for Toy Trains and The World of Franklin and Jefferson.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622091356/http://shop.eamesoffice.com/dvd-box-set.html|archivedate=22 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; their cinematic work was an outlet for ideas, a vehicle for experimentation and education.  The couple often produced short films in order to document their interests, such as collecting toys and cultural artifacts on their travels. The films also record the process of hanging their exhibits or producing classic furniture designs.  Some of their other films cover more intellectual topics.  For example, one film covers the purposely mundane topic of filming soap suds moving over the pavement of a parking lot. ''Powers of Ten'' (narrated by physicist [[Philip Morrison]]), gives a dramatic demonstration of [[orders of magnitude]] by visually zooming away from the earth to the edge of the universe, and then microscopically zooming into the nucleus of a carbon atom.

The Eameses also conceived and designed a number of exhibitions. The first of these, ''[[Mathematica: A World of Numbers... and Beyond]]'' (1961), was sponsored by [[IBM]], and is the only one of their exhibitions still extant.&lt;ref&gt;The original was created for a new wing of the (currently named) [[California Science Center]]; it is now owned by and on display at the [[New York Hall of Science]]. In late 1961, a duplicate was created for the [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]]; in 1980 it moved permanently to the [[Museum of Science (Boston)|Museum of Science]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. A third copy was created for the [[1964 New York World's Fair|1964/1965 New York World's Fair]] IBM exhibit. After the World's Fair closed, it was moved to the [[Pacific Science Center]] in [[Seattle, Washington]] where it stayed until 1980. It was then moved to [[SciTrek]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], but the organization was shut down in 2004 due to funding cuts.  As of 2014, the status of this last copy is unclear, but individual pieces may have been dispersed for exhibition separately.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Mathematica'' exhibition is still considered a model for [[Popular science|science popularization]] exhibitions. It was followed by ''A Computer Perspective: Background to the Computer Age'' (1971) and ''The World of Franklin and Jefferson'' (1975–1977), among others.

The design office of Charles and Ray Eames functioned for more than four decades (1943–1988) in the former Bay Cities Garage&lt;ref name="latimes.com"&gt;Roger Vincent (July 15, 2012), [http://www.latimes.com/business/money/la-fi-mo-eames-headquarters-sold-20120713,0,1237255.story Former Eames furniture design headquarters sold in Venice] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718024409/http://www.latimes.com/business/money/la-fi-mo-eames-headquarters-sold-20120713,0,1237255.story |date=18 July 2012 }} ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; at 901 Washington Boulevard in [[Venice, Los Angeles]], [[California]].

Eames products were also manufactured on Washington Boulevard until the 1950s.&lt;ref name="latimes.com"/&gt; Among the many important designs originating there are the molded-plywood DCW (Dining Chair Wood) and DCM (Dining Chair Metal with a plywood seat) (1945); [[Eames Lounge Chair]] (1956); the [[Eames Aluminum Group|Aluminum Group]] furniture (1958); the Eames Chaise (1968), designed for Charles's friend, film director [[Billy Wilder]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9U0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;hl=env=snippet&amp;q=Designer's Home&amp;f=false A Designer's Home of His Own] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151108161706/https://books.google.com/books?id=9U0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;hl=env=snippet&amp;q=Designer's |date=8 November 2015 }} [[LIFE magazine]]. 11 September 1950. page 148.&lt;/ref&gt; the playful Do-Nothing Machine (1957), an early [[solar energy]] experiment; and a number of toys.

In 1943 Ray and Charles developed a leg splint. This was is response to medical officers serving in World War II combat zones reported the need for emergency transport splints.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eamesoffice.com/the-work/leg-splint/|title=Leg Splint {{!}} Eames Office|date=17 February 2014|work=Eames Office|access-date=21 June 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Eameses created their splints from wood veneers, which they bonded together with a resin glue and shaped into compound curves using a process involving heat and pressure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Using the material they had for the furniture in the guest bedroom of their apartment.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} With the introduction of plywood splints, they were able to replace problematic metal traction splints that had side effects of inducing [[gangrene]] due to impairment of blood circulation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

[[File:constantino brumidi.jpg|thumb|Constantino Brumidi]]

'''Constantino Brumidi''' (July 26, 1805 – February 19, 1880) was a Greek-Italian-American historical painter, best known and honored for his [[fresco]] work in the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]] Building in Washington, DC.

==Parentage and early life==

Brumidi was born in Rome, his father a [[Greeks|Greek]] from [[Filiatra]] in the province of [[Messinia]], Greece, and his mother an [[Italian people|Italian]]. He showed his talent for fresco painting at an early age and painted in several Roman [[palace]]s, among them being that of Prince Torlonia. Under [[Gregory XVI]] he worked for three years in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]].

==Immigration and following work==
[[File:Constantino Brumidi grave - askew - Glenwood Cemetery - 2014-09-14.jpg|thumb|Grave of Constantino Brumidi, his wife, his son, and his in-laws at Glenwood Cemetery.]]
The [[Military occupation|occupation]] of Rome by French forces in 1849 apparently persuaded Brumidi to [[emigration|emigrate]], having joined the short-lived [[risorgimento|risorgimental]] [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]], and he sailed for the United States, where he became a [[naturalization|naturalized]] [[citizen]] in 1852. Taking up his residence in New York City, the artist painted a number of [[portraits]]. Subsequently, he undertook more important works, the principal being a fresco of the [[Crucifixion]] in St. Stephen's Church, for which he also executed a ''[[Martyrdom]] of [[St. Stephen]]'' and an ''[[Assumption of Mary]]''. He also executed frescoes at [[Taylor's Chapel]], [[Baltimore, Maryland]].

In 1854 Brumidi went to [[Mexico]], where he painted an allegorical representation of the [[Holy Trinity]] in the Mexico City [[cathedral]]. On his way back to New York he stopped at Washington D.C. and visited the Capitol. Impressed with the opportunity for decoration presented by its vast interior wall spaces, he offered his services for that purpose to [[Quartermaster General of the United States Army|Quartermaster General]] [[Montgomery C. Meigs]]. This offer was accepted, and about the same time Meigs was [[Commissioned officer|commissioned]] as a [[Captain (United States)|captain]] of [[cavalry]].

His first art work in the [[United States Capitol|Capitol Building]] was in the meeting room of the [[United States House Committee on Agriculture|House Committee on Agriculture]]. At first he received eight dollars a day, which Jefferson Davis, then [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] of the United States, helped increase to ten dollars.  His work attracting much favourable attention, he was given further commissions, and gradually settled into the position of a Government painter. His chief work in Washington was done in the [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] of the Capitol and included the ''[[Apotheosis of George Washington]]'' in the dome and the Frieze of American History, which contains allegorical scenes from [[American history]]. His work in the rotunda was left unfinished at his death, but he had decorated many other sections of the building, most notably hallways in the Senate side of the Capitol now known as the [[Brumidi Corridors]].

Brumidi's ''Liberty'' and ''Union'' paintings are mounted near the ceiling of the White House entrance hall.

In the [[Cathedral-Basilica of Sts. Peter and Paul]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], he pictured St. Peter and St. Paul. Brumidi was a capable, if conventional painter, and his black and white modeling in the work at Washington, in imitation of bas-relief, is strikingly effective.  He decorated the entrance hall of [[Saleaudo]], located at [[Frederick, Maryland]], and listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{MHT url|id=567}}|title=Maryland Historical Trust|date=2008-12-14|work= National Register of Historic Places: Properties in Frederick County|publisher=Maryland Historical Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Brumidi fresco appears behind the altar in [[Saint Ignatius Church, Baltimore|St. Ignatius Church]] in Baltimore, Maryland. Another, of Saint [[Aloysius Gonzaga]] receiving communion from Saint [[Charles Borromeo]], hangs over the high altar of [[St. Aloysius Church (Washington, D.C.)|St Aloysius Church]] in Washington, D.C.

==In memoriam==
Brumidi died in Washington, D.C., and was interred at [[Glenwood Cemetery (Washington, D.C.)|Glenwood Cemetery]]. When he was buried, his grave was unmarked. The location of Brumidi's grave was lost for 72 years. It was rediscovered, and on February 19, 1952, a marker was finally placed above it.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Elizabeth G. "Report of the Chronicler for 1952." ''Records of the Columbia Historical Society.'' 51/52 (1951/1952), pp. 181-209, 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

Forgotten for many years, Brumidi's role was rescued from obscurity by [[Myrtle Cheney Murdock]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/brumidi-study-of-capitol-dome-painting-to-go-to-smithsonian/2012/03/05/gIQAclhhtR_story.html Brumidi study of Capitol dome painting to go to Smithsonian] [[Washington Post]]&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 10, 2008, Congress passed, and on September 1, 2008, President George W. Bush signed, Public Law 110-59 (122 Stat. 2430), which posthumously awarded the [[Congressional Gold Medal]] to Constantino Brumidi, to be displayed in the Capitol Visitor Center, as part of an exhibit honoring him.&lt;ref&gt;{{USPL|110|259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She soon received offers for film roles and made her acting debut in 2006 as the title character of the [[Kannada film]] ''[[Aishwarya (film)|Aishwarya]]''. Padukone then played a dual role in her first Bollywood release, the romance ''[[Om Shanti Om]]'' (2007), which won her the [[Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut]]. Padukone received praise for portraying the lead roles in the romance ''[[Love Aaj Kal]]'' (2009) and the drama ''[[Lafangey Parindey]]'' (2010), but her performances in the romance ''[[Bachna Ae Haseeno]]'' (2008) and the comedy ''[[Housefull (2010 film)|Housefull]]'' (2010) were met with negative reviews.

The romantic comedy ''[[Cocktail (2012 film)|Cocktail]]'' (2012) marked a turning point in Padukone's career, earning her praise and Best Actress nominations at several award ceremonies. She established herself with starring roles in the romantic comedies ''[[Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani]]'' and ''[[Chennai Express]]'' (both 2013), the heist comedy ''[[Happy New Year (2014 film)|Happy New Year]]'' (2014), and [[Sanjay Leela Bhansali]]'s period dramas ''[[Bajirao Mastani]]'' (2015) and ''[[Padmaavat]]'' (2018), all of which rank among the [[List of highest-grossing Indian films|highest-grossing Indian films]]. Padukone's acclaimed portrayal of a character based on [[Juliet]] in Bhansali's tragic romance ''[[Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela]]'' (2013) and a headstrong architect in the comedy-drama ''[[Piku]]'' (2015) earned her two [[Filmfare Award for Best Actress|Filmfare Awards for Best Actress]]. Her first project in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] came with the action film ''[[xXx: Return of Xander Cage]]'' (2017).

Alongside her acting career, Padukone participates in stage shows, has written columns for an Indian newspaper, is a prominent celebrity endorser for brands and products, and is vocal about issues such as [[feminism]] and depression.

Ellin was born on October 3, 1928 in [[Chicago, Illinois]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;  He studied at the [[University of Michigan]], from which he received a bachelor's degree in engineering, and at [[Harvard Law School]], from which he received a law degree in 1952.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;  He served in the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] during the [[Korean War]], with duties that included drafting regulations regarding technological obsolescence.&lt;ref name=aaa&gt;{{cite web|title=Oral history interview with Everett Ellin|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-everett-ellin-12188|publisher=[[Archives of American Art]]|date=April 27–28, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eob&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tell|first1=Darcy|title=A Tale of Two Art Dealers|url=http://www.eastofborneo.org/articles/a-tale-of-two-art-dealers|accessdate=October 25, 2014|work=[[East of Borneo]]|date=March 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After leaving the Air Force, he worked for a time as a lawyer, serving as a law clerk with the [[California Supreme Court]] and as in-house counsel at [[Columbia Pictures]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;   He also worked as an assistant to a [[William Morris Agency]] executive.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3724">'''Gebrehiwot Baykedagn''' (1886-1919) was an Ethiopian doctor, economist, and intellectual.&lt;ref name="Kebede2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Messay Kebede|title=Radicalism and Cultural Dislocation in Ethiopia, 1960-1974|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kFQljBlBC_oC|accessdate=13 July 2012|year=2008|publisher=University Rochester Press|isbn=978-1-58046-291-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born in 1886&lt;ref name="Henze2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul B. Henze|title=Layers of Time: A History of Ethiopia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gzwoedwOkQMC|accessdate=13 July 2012|year=2000|publisher=Hurst &amp; Company|isbn=978-1-85065-393-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Adwa]], a northern Ethiopian town. In a trip to the port of [[Massawa]], Gebrehiwot and his friends got permission from the captain of a German ship to visit the ship. On departure, he stowed away (this may not have been deliberate, according to Alemayehu Geda, 2004). On arrival, the captain entrusted the young boy to a rich Austrian family, who adopted him. This good fortune opened to him the opportunity to study the German language and to go to school. His exposure to Western education was thorough, and he pursued medical studies at [[Berlin University]]. He returned to his country and became private secretary and interpreter to the [[Menelik II of Ethiopia|Emperor Menelik II]], who defeated the Italian colonial army in 1896 at the [[Battle of Adwa]]. Later on, while the [[Haile Selassie]] was still the successor to the throne, he fulfilled important administrative functions. He served as inspector of the important [[Rail transport in Ethiopia|Addis Ababa-Djibouti railway]] until his premature death in 1919.

==Major works==
He published two majors works in [[Amharic]], the Ethiopian national language: "Mengistna ye Hizb Astadadar", published in 1924 after his death and translated into English in 1995 as "State and Economy of Early 20th Century Ethiopia"; and in 1912, "Atse Menilik na Ethiopia", which was translated into French in 1993 as "L'Empereur Menelik et L'Ethiopie".

Professor Emeritus of History at [[Addis Ababa University]], Professor [[Bahru Zewde]] tells us that the latter book was written with the hopes that Menelik’s successor, [[Iyasu V of Ethiopia|Iyasu V]] would take up his recommendations and proceed to modernize the Ethiopian state.

While his recommendations went unheeded by a young prince little interested in the affairs of state, Gebrehiwot went on to exert considerable influence on Ethiopian affairs for the rest of the century. &lt;!-- Gebrehiwot died before Haile Selassie became Emperor. Confusion with someone else?→ During the reign of Haile Selassie, he authored his most significant piece “Mengist ena Yezib Astedader” (Government and Public Administration).  This volume contained economic thinking and principles that had yet to become major topics of discussion, even by pioneering Western economists. --&gt; His writings expressed deep concern with national institutions, structural economics, income inequality in development, and trade imbalance between developed and underdeveloped nations. It is for this reason that Addis Ababa University Professor of Economics Dr. Alemayehu Geda calls Gebrehiwot one of the world’s pioneers in the study of "[[Development Economics]]".

==Death==
After his death at the age of 33, his ideas went on to influence generations of Ethiopian intellectuals.  One can clearly distinguish Gebrehiwot’s ideas in the thought processes of the young revolutionaries of the 1970s.

'''Harold Lee Lindsey''' (born November 23, 1929) is an American [[Evangelism|evangelist]] and Christian writer.  He is a [[Christian Zionism|Christian Zionist]] and [[dispensationalism|dispensationalist]] author and television host.

== Biography ==

Lindsey graduated from [[Dallas Theological Seminary]] with a Master of Theology degree, majoring in the New Testament and early Greek literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lindsey|first=Hal|title=The Liberation of Planet Earth|year=1974|publisher=Zondervan Publishing House|location=Grand Rapids, Michigan|isbn=0-553-11545-6|pages=17; last page "About the Author "}}&lt;/ref&gt; With his second wife, Jan, he worked with [[Campus Crusade for Christ]] and continued with them until 1969. He then helped a mission in [[Southern California]] which continued until 1976. He was also a frequent speaker and Sunday School teacher at [[Melodyland Christian Center]] in [[Anaheim, California]]. During 1969, he wrote his first, and best-known book, ''[[The Late, Great Planet Earth]]''.  Published during 1970 by [[Zondervan]], this book became a bestseller. Coming on the heels of the [[Six-Day War]], the book fueled the popularity of [[dispensationalism]] and its support of ethnic [[Jew]]s as the "chosen people of God". Many of Lindsey's later writings are sequels or revisions and extensions of his first book. During 1994, he earned his Doctorate of Theology from the [[California Graduate School of Theology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Antipas Foundation|url=http://antipas.net/cool_hal.htm|accessdate=April 18, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523012838/http://antipas.net/cool_hal.htm|archivedate=May 23, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lindsey hosted ''International Intelligence Briefing'' on the [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]] and serves on the executive board of [[Christian Voice (USA)|Christian Voice]].&lt;ref name="Stations Of The Cross"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.theocracywatch.org/station_cjr_may_05.htm | title=Stations of the Cross|publisher=[[Columbia Journalism Review]] |date=May–June 2005  | first=Mariah | last=Blake | accessdate = 2006-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''International Intelligence Briefing'' was eliminated from broadcasting by TBN for the entire month of December 2005. Lindsey claimed that this was because "some at the network apparently feel that [his] message is too pro-[[Israel]] and too anti-[[Muslim]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hallindseyoracle.com/articles.asp?ArticleID=12130]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051212131839/http://www.hallindseyoracle.com/articles.asp?ArticleID=12130 |date=December 12, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; TBN owner [[Paul Crouch]], however, contended that "TBN has never been and is not now against Israel and the Jewish people."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tbn.org/index.php/7.html?nid=87 TBN – Trinity Broadcasting Network&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Crouch said that Lindsey's show was pre-empted for Christmas programming.  Lindsey countered that this was the first time his show had been preempted for the entire month of December. TBN later admitted that a secondary reason for pre-empting the show was that it "placed [[Arab]]s in a negative light."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=47691 TBN admits concern about offending Muslims&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lindsey resigned from TBN on January 1, 2006, and indicated that he would pursue another television ministry. His new program, ''[[The Hal Lindsey Report]]'', emphasizes [[Biblical prophecy]] and current events, and is broadcast by the [[Sky Angel|Angel One]] and [[DayStar (network)|DayStar]] networks.  During January 2007, Lindsey announced that he would be returning to the TBN network. ''The Hal Lindsey Report'' is broadcast by TBN with his own financing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tbn.org/index.php/7.html?nid=192 TBN – Trinity Broadcasting Network&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070125091758/http://www.tbn.org/index.php/7.html?nid=192 |date=January 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biblical interpretations ==
Lindsey's claims are based on a [[dispensationalist]] interpretation of the implications of [[Jesus Christ]] as presented in the four [[gospels]] of the [[New Testament]] as the divine Son of God and the [[Jewish Messiah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lindsey|first=Hal|title=The Liberation of Planet Earth|year=1974|publisher=Zondervan Publishing House|location=Grand Rapids, Michigan|isbn=0-553-11545-6|pages=71–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lindsey claims from the Bible that Jesus Christ will return from heaven to earth someday and establish eternal peace, happiness, prosperity, and harmony among all people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lindsey|first=Hal|title=The Late Great Planet Earth|year=1970|publisher=Zondervan Publishing House|location=Grand Rapids, Michigan|isbn=0-553-20272-3|pages=17–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lindsey says the Bible contains numerous prophecies that foretell of certain conditions and events that will occur in the world prior to Christ's return. He continues, saying that, as these things occur, they are to serve as signs and reminders that we are in the era that the Bible calls the ''end times'' or ''last days''.&lt;ref&gt;The Late Great Planet Earth, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Lindsey believes a prophetic event that officially begins the ''end times'' is the regathering of the Jewish people to their ancient homeland to form an independent nation after a prolonged worldwide dispersion.&lt;ref&gt;The Late Great Planet Earth, Chapter 4, "Israel, O Israel."&lt;/ref&gt; He states that the establishment of the [[State of Israel]] during May 1948 is the fulfillment of this major prophecy. He also states that the last seven years of the ''end times'' is a period known as the [[Tribulation]]; which is described in the gospel of Matthew and the book of Revelation.

In ''The Late Great Planet Earth'', Lindsey wrote that the biblical prophets identified certain nations that would ally with other countries to form "four major spheres of political power" during the same era that Israel would be reestablished as a nation.&lt;ref&gt;The Late Great Planet Earth, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Lindsey wrote that these nations and their allies can be identified as: (1) Russia with its allies, (2) China with other nations of the Orient, (3) Egypt with other Middle East countries, and (4) an alliance of Western European nations.&lt;ref&gt;The Late Great Planet Earth, chapters 5–8&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lindsey, the alliance of Western European nations is a revived form of the ancient Roman Empire, predicted in the books of Daniel and Revelation symbolically as ''ten horns'' and ''ten kings''.&lt;ref&gt;The Late Great Planet Earth, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Late Great Planet Earth'', Lindsey quotes from a 1969 [[Time Magazine]] article that the goal of the [[European Economic Community]], which preceded the [[European Union]], was to establish a ten-nation economic community.&lt;ref&gt;The Late Great Planet Earth, p. 85; p. 180 in his Reference Notes for Chapter 8, Lindsey cites Time Magazine, July 4, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; Lindsey concludes, based on this and other sources, that this alliance will help cause the fulfillment of this prophecy and will ultimately be ruled by the [[Antichrist]].&lt;ref&gt;The Late Great Planet Earth; p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; 

Lindsey noted that the prophets did not refer to the United States of America directly or indirectly. He concluded that this is an indication that the U.S. will no longer be a great geo-political power by the time the [[Tribulation]] of the [[end times]] arrives.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 84, 173&lt;/ref&gt;

In a later book, titled, ''The 1980s: Countdown to Armageddon'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lindsey|first=Hal|title=The 1980s Countdown To Armageddon|year=1981|publisher=Bantam Books|location=New York City 10103|isbn=0-553-01303-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; he indicated that he believed it was possible that the battle of [[Armageddon]] could occur in the not too distant future, stating, "the decade of the 1980s could very well be the last decade of history as we know it."&lt;ref&gt;The 1980s Countdown To Armageddon; p.8&lt;/ref&gt; He noted again that there is no reference to the U.S. in Bible prophecy. He listed a few scenarios that seemed plausible to him at the time: (1) A takeover by Communists, (2) destruction by a surprise Soviet nuclear attack, or (3) becoming a dependent of the 10-nation European community.&lt;ref&gt;p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;  The book was on the ''[[New York Times]]'' bestseller list for more than 20 weeks.

'''Jean Baptiste Brunet''' (7 July 1763 – 21 September 1824){{sfn|Broughton|2002}} was a French [[general of division]] in the [[French Revolutionary Army]]. He was responsible for the arrest of [[Toussaint Louverture]].{{sfn|Pachonski &amp; Wilson|1986}} He was promoted to command a light infantry [[demi-brigade]] at the [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)|Fleurus]] in 1794. He led the unit in [[François Joseph Lefebvre]]'s division in the 1795, 1796 and 1799 campaigns. He was the son of French general [[Gaspard Jean-Baptiste Brunet]] who was [[guillotine]]d in 1793. 

==Career==
Brunet became [[Chef de brigade]] ([[colonel]]) of the 13th Light Infantry [[Demi-brigade]] on 26 June 1794.{{sfn|Broughton|2002}} This was the same day as the [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)|Battle of Fleurus]] where the 13th Light fought in [[François Joseph Lefebvre]]'s division.{{sfn|Smith|1998|p=86}} He was still the commanding officer when this unit became the 25th Light Infantry Demi-brigade on 1 July 1796.{{sfn|Broughton|2002}}&lt;ref group=note&gt;Broughton gave a date of 1 July 1795. This is probably a typo because he also stated the 25th Light was not renumbered until 1796.&lt;/ref&gt; The 13th Light was in Lefebvre's Advance Guard on 1 October during the [[Rhine Campaign of 1795]].{{sfn|Smith|1998|p=101}} The 25th Light fought under Lefebvre at the time of the [[Battle of Würzburg]] on 3 September in the [[Rhine Campaign of 1796]].{{sfn|Smith|1998|p=121}} 

Still in Lefebvre's division, the 25th Light fought at the [[Battle of Ostrach]] on 21 March 1799{{sfn|Smith|1998|p=147}} and the [[Battle of Stockach (1799)|Battle of Stockach]] on 25 March.{{sfn|Smith|1998|p=148}} The 25th Light was in the 3rd Division at the [[First Battle of Zurich]] on 4 June 1799.{{sfn|Smith|1998|pp=157–158}} Brunet was promoted [[general of brigade]] on 10 June 1799.{{sfn|Broughton|2002}} He led a brigade in [[Édouard Mortier]]'s 4th Division at the [[Second Battle of Zurich]] on 25–26 September 1799. The division consisted of the 50th, 53rd, 100th and 108th Line Infantry Demi-brigades, the 1st Dragoons and the 8th Chasseurs à Cheval.{{sfn|Smith|1998|p=167}} He assumed the rank of [[general of division]] on 7 June 1802.{{sfn|Broughton|2002}} 

==Arrest of Toussaint Loverture==
[[Charles Leclerc ]] originally asked [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]] to arrest Louverture, but he declined. the task then fell to Brunet. However accounts differ as to how he accomplished this. One account has it that Brunet pretended that he planned to settle in [[Saint-Domingue]] and asked for Toussaint's advice about plantation management. Louverture's memoirs however suggest that Brunet's troops had been provocative, leading Louverture to seek a discussion with him. Embarrassed about his trickery, Brunet absented himself during the arrest.{{sfn|Girard|2011}} He was captured by the British and not released until 1814.

'''Lemuel Haynes''' (July 18, 1753 – September 28, 1833) was an American clergyman.  A veteran of the [[American Revolution]], Haynes was the first black man in the United States to be ordained as a minister.

Haynes was a native of [[West Hartford, Connecticut|West Hartford]], [[Connecticut]], and was the son of an African American man and a white woman.  He spent much of his childhood as an indentured servant in the house of a [[Granville, Massachusetts]] farmer.  A regular churchgoer, he began to preach as a boy.  He served in the militia during the [[American Revolution]], including garrison duty at the recently [[Capture of Fort Ticonderoga|captured Fort Ticonderoga]] in 1776.  Haynes also became an anti-slavery activist.  In addition to arguing against involuntary servitude and preaching against the slave trade, Haynes also advocated against the colonization movement, arguing that people of African descent living in the United States should be entitled to the same rights as other citizens, and that having them resettle in Africa would not be beneficial.

Ordained in the Congregational church in 1785, Haynes pastored a church in [[Torrington, Connecticut]] for three years.  In 1788, Haynes left the temporary position at the Torrington congregation to accept a call to pastor the West Parish Church of Rutland, Vermont (now [[West Rutland, Vermont|West Rutland]]'s [[United Church of Christ]]), where he remained for the next 33 years.  He them moved to [[Granville, New York#Communities and locations in the town|South Granville]], New York, where he was pastor of [[South Granville Congregational Church]].

Haynes died in South Granville in 1833, and was buried at Lee-Oatman Cemetery in South Granville.

==Early life and education==
Little is known of his early life. He was born on July 18, 1753 at
[[West Hartford, Connecticut|West Hartford]], [[Connecticut]], reportedly to a [[Whites|Caucasian]] mother of some status and a man named Haynes, who was said to be "of some form of African extraction".

At the age of five months, Lemuel Haynes was given over to [[Indentured servant|indentured servitude]] on the [[Granville, Massachusetts|Granville]], [[Massachusetts]] farm of Deacon David Rose. Part of the indenture required Rose to see to Haynes's education, and by accompanying Rose to church, he became exposed to [[Calvinism|Calvinistic]] religious doctrine, including the works of [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]], [[George Whitefield]], and [[Philip Doddridge]], who all became strong influences on Haynes' religious outlook.&lt;ref&gt;Anyabwile, Thabiti M. The decline of African American theology: from biblical faith to cultural captivity. InterVarsity Press, 2007. p67-68&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military service==
Freed in 1774 when his indenture expired, Haynes joined the [[minutemen]] of Granville. In 1775, he marched with his militia company to [[Roxbury, Massachusetts]], following the news of the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]]. In 1776, he accompanied them in the garrisoning of the recently [[Capture of Fort Ticonderoga|captured Fort Ticonderoga]].  He remained on garrison duty until contracting Typhus, which caused him to return home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bogin|first1=Ruth|title=Liberty Further Extended: Antislavery manuscript by Lemuel Haynes|journal=William and Mary Quarterly|date=January 1983|volume=40|issue=1|pages=94–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=White|first1=Deborah|title=Freedom on My Mind|date=2012-12-14|publisher=Bedford/St. Martins|location=Boston/New York|isbn=978-0-312-64883-1|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings==
During the [[American Revolution]], Haynes began to write extensively, criticizing the [[African slave trade|slave trade]] and slavery. He continued these activities after the war, and also began to prepare [[sermon]]s, family [[prayer]]s and other [[Theology|theological]] works. The [[Bible|Scripture]], [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]], and [[republicanism]] affected his published writings, in which Haynes argued that slavery denied black people their [[natural rights]] to "[[Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness]]".  Paralleling the recent American experience with oppression to the slave experience, Haynes wrote: "Liberty is equally as precious to a black man, as it is to a white one, and bondage as equally as intolerable to the one as it is to the other".

==Ministry==
[[File:Lemuel Haynes House, South Granville, NY.jpg|thumb|right|Haynes' last home, in South Granville, now a [[National Historic Landmark]]]]
After his militia service, Haynes studied theology with members of the clergy in Connecticut and Massachusetts. He received his license to preach in 1780, along with a position as temporary 'supply' to his home congregation in Middle Granville. About the same time, he began his many years of service as a missionary in the wilderness of the [[New Hampshire Grants]], soon to be known as the independent [[Vermont Republic]] and finally the American state of [[Vermont]].

Haynes was ordained in 1785 and settled at Hemlock Congregational Church in [[Torrington, Connecticut]]. He was the first [[African American]] ordained in the United States. On March 28, 1788, Haynes left his pastorate at Torrington to accept a call at the West Parish Church of Rutland, Vermont (now [[West Rutland, Vermont|West Rutland]]'s [[United Church of Christ]]), where he served the mostly white congregation for 30 years.

Haynes continued to write and speak about slavery.  His contemporary white republican and abolitionist thinkers did see slavery as a liability to the new country, but most argued for eventual slave expatriation to [[Africa]]. The [[American Colonization Society]] (founded in 1817) was the largest colonization group. Included among its supporters were people such as [[James Madison]], [[James Monroe]], [[Henry Clay]] and [[Daniel Webster]]. The ACS was strongly supported in Vermont. In contrast, Haynes continued to passionately argue along Calvinist lines that God's [[Divine Providence|providential plan]] would defeat slavery and lead to the harmonious integration of the races as equals.

After asking for and accepting dismissal from West Rutland in 1818, he took a temporary post at [[Manchester, Vermont|Manchester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | author = Cooley, Timothy Mather | title = Sketches of the Life and Character of the Rev.

==Death and burial==
Haynes died in South Granville, and was buried at Lee-Oatman Cemetery in South Granville.  He had composed his own epitaph, which was included on his gravestone as he had requested.

{{quote
|text=Here lies the dust of a poor hell-deserving sinner who ventured into eternity trusting wholly on the merits of Christ for salvation. In the full belief of the great doctrines he preached while on earth, he invites his children, and all who read this, to trust their eternal interest in the same foundation.}}

==Family==
While living in Middle Granville in the early 1780s, Haynes met and married Elizabeth Babbitt (1763-1836), a white schoolteacher.  Their children included:

	i.	  Elizabeth (b. November 1785 Granville, Mass, 6 Sep 1866 Rutland)

	ii.	  Eunice (b. 3 March 1789 Rutland, d. 2 January 1859 Granville, New York)	

	iii.	  Louis (b. 1790 Rutland, d. 12 January 1828 Granville, New York)

	iv.	  Electa (b. 26 July 1791 Rutland, d. after 1833 Granville, New York)

	v.	  Lemuel, Jr. (b. 11 July 1794 Rutland, d. after 1850)

	vi.	  Sarah (b. 6 May 1796 Rutland, d. August 1841 Granville, New York)

	vii.      Olive (b. 9 August 1798 Rutland, d. 19 September 1823 Middlebury)

	viii.     Pamela (b. 14 October 1800 Rutland)

	ix.	  Samuel Woodbridge (b. 11 January 1803 Rutland, after 1880 Kansas)

	x.	  William Babbitt (twin, b. 11 January 1803 Rutland, 3 March 1839 at sea)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jwhamil.com/Hamil/Haynes.htm |title=JW Hamil - Lemuel Haynes |website=JWHamil.com |date= |accessdate=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.familysearch.org/search/collection/2075288 |title=Vermont Vital Records 1760-2008 |website=FamilySearch.org |date= |accessdate=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[Middlebury College]] granted Haynes an [[Honorary degree|honorary master of arts]] in 1804, the first honorary degree ever bestowed upon an African American.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part2/2p29.html |title=Africans in America/Part 2/Lemuel Haynes |website=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jbhe.com/chronology/ |title=JBHE Key Events in Black Higher Education |website=JBHE.com |date= |accessdate=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian John Saillant (2003, p.&amp;nbsp;3) writes that Haynes's "faith and social views are better documented than those of any African American born before the luminaries of the mid-nineteenth century."

[[Lemuel Haynes House]], his home for the last 11 years of his life in [[Granville, New York#Communities and locations in the town|South Granville]], New York, when he was pastor of [[South Granville Congregational Church]] was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1975. Originally sitting on a parcel of the PAR Farm, it was purchased from Charles  Halderman in 2009 by Bo Young and William Foote, formerly of Brooklyn.

'''Mathilde Fibiger''' (13 December 1830 &amp;ndash; 17 June 1872) was a Danish [[feminist]], novelist, and [[telegraphist]].

==Biography==
Mathilde Fibiger was born in [[Copenhagen]] in 1830. Her father, Captain Johan Adolph Fibiger, was an army officer; her mother was Margrethe Cecilia Nielsen Aasen. Her elder sister was [[Ilia Fibiger]].

==Literary work==
Mathilde Fibiger was a novelist who championed women's rights in her first novel, ''Clara Raphael, Tolv Breve'' (''Clara Raphael, Twelve Letters''), published in 1851.  It is the partially autobiographical story of a young woman, Clara Raphael, who works as a governess in the provinces; it is based in part on Fibiger's experiences as a private tutor on the island of [[Lolland]] in 1849.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Mathilde Fibiger - womens' emancipation pioneer | work= KVINFO - All About Gender in Denmark | url= http://www.kvinfo.dk/side/680/article/11/ | accessdate= 2011-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel consists largely of letters written by Clara to her friend, Mathilde; Clara's ideas about women living an independent life run counter to the beliefs of the local population, and she resolves to make women's emancipation her life objective.  The book created a great deal of controversy on its publication in 1851; while the Danish literary establishment was divided between those who supported her and those who felt that her ideas were too radical, all agreed on the literary merit of her work.

==Support of women's rights==
Fibiger was the first public figure in Denmark to forward the [[women's rights]] issue. She wrote novels, articles and discussion papers since age 20 in 1851.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adl.dk/adl_pub/fportraet/cv/ShowFpItem.xsql?nnoc=adl_pub&amp;ff_id=55&amp;p_fpkat_id=fskab|title=Mathilde Fibiger|publisher=arkic for Dansk Literatur|language=Danish|accessdate=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In counter opinions in society against women's rights, Fibiger published two pamphlets; ''Hvad er Emancipation?'' (What is Emancipation?) and ''Et Besøg'' (A Visit). Her later novels included ''En Skizze efter det virkelige Liv'' (A Sketch from Real Life, 1853) and ''Minona. En Fortaelling'' (Minona: A Tale, 1854). ''En Skizze efter det virkelige Liv'' is the story of two sisters who were orphaned at an early age, and the men with whom they develop relationships; the older sister rejects her suitor, feeling that men are weak, while the younger sister falls in love. ''Minona'' created new controversy with its complex plot involving unwed mothers and incest; Minona, the chief character, overcomes her incestuous attraction after converting to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Mathilde Fibiger - womens' emancipation pioneer | url= http://www.kvinfo.dk/side/680/article/11/ | accessdate= 2011-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work as telegraphist==
While Fibiger's novels generated critical acclaim, they were not commercially successful, and she began to look for other means to support herself. She supplemented a meager allowance, received from the state, by dressmaking and translating German literary works. In 1863, she began training as a [[telegraph]] operator for the Danish State Telegraph service, which had recently decided to hire women as operators under the management of Director [[Peter Faber (Danish telegraph specialist)|Peter Faber]]. In 1866, she completed her training at the [[Helsingør]] telegraph station, and became the first woman to be employed as a telegraph operator in Denmark.

After two years in [[Helsingør]], she was transferred to [[Nysted]] in 1869 to manage a newly opened station. Not surprisingly, she encountered resistance from male operators, who saw the employment of women as operators as a threat to their livelihood. In spite of her managerial position, her pay at Nysted was scarcely sufficient to enable her to pay her expenses. The following year, she applied for a transfer to the telegraph station in [[Aarhus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Life in Shirt Sleeves | author= Marie Ørstedholm | work= Post &amp; TeleMuseum Danmark | url= http://www.teponia.dk/museumsposten/index.php?artikelid=151/Life-in-shirt-sleeves | accessdate= 2011-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She continued to experience difficulties in Aarhus, where the station manager had opposed her assignment.  The problems she experienced in her telegraphic work began to affect her health; she died in Aarhus in 1872 at the age of 41. She is remembered today in Denmark not only as a pioneering feminist who wrote in support of women's rights, but also as the woman who opened the door for the employment of women in the Danish State Telegraph service.

== Prizes and honors ==

Such was her prominence as an advocate for [[gender equality]], in order to honour it, the ''Dansk Kvindesamfund'' (Danish Women's Society) created ''Mathildeprisen'' (The Mathilde Prize). The Mathilde Prize was established in 1970 and is awarded to both men and women in recognition of work that advances gender equality. Recipients of the prize includes [[Suzanne Brøgger]], [[Joan-søstrene]], [[Kenneth Reinicke]], [[Anja Andersen]] and [[Anja Cetti Andersen|Anja C. Andersen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.danskkvindesamfund.dk/mathildeprisen.html|title=Mathildeprisen|publisher=Dansk Kvindesamfund |language=Danish |date= |accessdate=2013-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A small garden square adjacent to the [[Women's Museum, Aarhus|Women's Museum]] in central Aarhus is named ''Mathilde Fibigers Have'' in her honor.

''' Michael DeKort '''was an American [[engineering]] [[project manager]] at [[Lockheed Martin]] who posted a [[whistleblowing]] video on [[Youtube.com]] about [[Integrated Deepwater System Program#Lockheed whistleblower|the Lockheed Integrated Deepwater System Program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd3VV8Za04g |title=Original-See other copy if this version is frozen |publisher=YouTube |date=2006-08-03 |accessdate=2015-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPo"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/28/AR2006082801293.html|title=On YouTube, Charges of Security Flaws|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=4 April 2013|first=Griff|last=Witte|date=29 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
DeKort began working as an engineer at Lockheed Martin in 1994. He was working as a lead system engineer in 2003 when he noticed that the equipment Lockheed Martin was installing in U. S. [[Coast Guard]] vessels as part of the Deepwater program was faulty. According to DeKort, he alerted the CEO and Board of Directors of Lockheed Martin, but was ignored and removed from his position as project manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Helvarg|first=David |title=Rescue Warriors: The U.S. Coast Guard, America's Forgotten Heroes|year=2009|publisher=MacMillan|isbn=9781429989534|page=252}}&lt;/ref&gt; DeKort then reported the equipment problems to the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]].

'''Minnie M. Sarwal''' is an adult and pediatric [[Nephrology|nephrologist]], researcher of transplant immunology, and biotechnology entrepreneur in [[San Francisco]]. She has made significant contributions to the field of [[organ transplantation]], including conducting the first successful complete steroid avoidance trial in the US and the first dosing safety trial for [[Rituximab]] in pediatric renal transplantation. She also spearheaded genomic and proteomics investigations into mechanisms of organ transplant injury and was the first to determine that there was substantive molecular heterogeneity in acute kidney transplant rejection. She has successfully commercialized blood testing for early diagnosis of both acute rejection and operational tolerance in kidney transplant patients, providing tools for proactive and predictive immunosuppression monitoring for transplant recipients.

'''Girolomo "Momo" Adamo''' (1895–1956) was an [[Italian American]] mobster in the [[American Mafia]]. He lived in [[Chicago]] and [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] before moving to [[Los Angeles]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lait |first1=Jack |authorlink1=Jack Lait |last2=Mortimer |first2=Lee |authorlink2=Lee Mortimer |title=[[U.S.A. Confidential]] |year=1952 |publisher=Crown Publishers |page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1930s and soon became [[underboss]] to [[Jack Dragna]] in the [[Los Angeles crime family]]. His brother Joseph Adamo was also a member of the crime family. Both he and his brother were well connected criminals in San Diego, working with such mobsters as [[Frank Bompensiero]]. In 1950, Momo was arrested along with several members of Jack Dragna's family including [[Tom Dragna]] (brother), Louis Dragna (nephew), and two men named Frank Paul Dragna (his son and nephew, respectively) after Jack fled the state after being named in the California Crime Commission report as a member of a crime syndicate in Los Angeles. The five of them were taken into custody by the [[Los Angeles Police Department]], who believed they were responsible for bombing [[Mickey Cohen]]'s home or knew who was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mobster Gone; Police Fear for His Safety |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=I-IcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=q2QEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=tom-dragna&amp;pg=3778%2C4274974 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |newspaper=[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]] |location=[[Sarasota, Florida]] |date=February 15, 1950 |page=16 |accessdate=April 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were all released without being charged when the police couldn't find evidence of their involvement (Tom built the bomb, but otherwise none of them were involved).

When Jack Dragna died in 1956, the Los Angeles crime family cast a vote to see who would become the next boss. Momo was hoping as a long time L.A. Mob leader, he would be elected. However, USC trained lawyer-turned-mobster [[Frank DeSimone]] was elected boss in what is believed to be a rigged election. DeSimone demoted Adamo, and Adamo moved to San Diego shortly after. In the same year, Adamo attempted a [[murder–suicide]] by shooting his wife [[Marie Adamo]] in the head, before shooting himself. Marie ended up surviving. The reason for the attempted murder isn't confirmed, but according to police informants, Adamo's shooting himself and Marie was possibly out of shame from Frank DeSimone raping Adamo's wife while being forced to watch. Other sources have trouble believing the straight laced DeSimone, a USC graduate and a practicing attorney, would have raped a mob associate's wife, or anyone else. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Reid |first1=Ed |title=The Anatomy of Organized Crime in America: The Grim Reapers |year=1969 |publisher=Regnery |page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adamo's wife Marie was having an affair during their marriage and an alternative theory given is that Adamo committed these actions after finding out about her affair. Marie Adamo who never talked about the shooting incident publicly, recovered and later married [[Frank Bompensiero]], who was widowed after his wife Thelma died.

'''Poppaea Sabina''' (AD 30 – AD 65)—known as '''Poppaea Sabina the Younger''' (to differentiate her from her mother) and, after AD 63, as '''Poppaea Augusta Sabina'''—was a Roman Empress as the second wife of the [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Nero]]. She had also been wife to the future Emperor [[Otho]]. The historians of [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]] describe her as a beautiful woman who used intrigues to become [[List of Roman and Byzantine empresses|empress]].{{Citation needed|reason=According to whom?|date=November 2014}}

==Early life==

===Birth===
Poppaea Sabina the Younger was born in [[Pompeii]] in AD 30 as the daughter of [[Titus Ollius]] and [[Poppaea Sabina the Elder]].&lt;ref name=moesia&gt;Simon Hornblower, Antony Spawforth-E.A. (edd.), [[Oxford Classical Dictionary]], [[Oxford University Press]], 2003 | 1221.&lt;/ref&gt; Most evidence suggesting Poppaea's Pompeiian origins comes from the 20th century excavations of the town, destroyed in the [[Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79]]. For instance, legal documents found during excavations in nearby [[Herculaneum]] described her as being the owner of a brick- or tile-work business in the Pompeii area. It is very likely that Poppaea's family came from Pompeii, and the common belief is that they might have been the owners of the [[Casa del Menandro]] (a house in Pompeii named for the painting of the 4th century BC playwright [[Menander]] that is found there).&lt;ref&gt;Beard, Mary. ''The Fires of Vesuvius: Pompeii Lost and Found'' (p. 46). Cambridge: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family===
[[Titus Ollius]] was a [[quaestor]] in the reign of the Emperor [[Tiberius]]. Ollius' friendship with the infamous imperial palace guardsman [[Lucius Aelius Sejanus]] ruined him before gaining public office. Titus Ollius was from [[Picenum]] (modern [[Marche]] and [[Abruzzo]], Italy) and he was an unknown minor character in imperial politics. Titus Ollius died in 31.

Poppaea Sabina the Elder, her mother, was a distinguished woman, whom [[Tacitus]] praises as wealthy and "the loveliest woman of her day". In 47, she committed suicide as an innocent victim of the intrigues of the Roman Empress [[Valeria Messalina]], having been charged with having committed adultery with former consul [[Decimus Valerius Asiaticus]].

[[Image:Poppaea Olimpia.jpg|250px|left|thumb|Statue of Poppaea in the Archaeological Museum of Olympia (Greece)]]
The father of Poppaea Sabina the Elder was [[Gaius Poppaeus Sabinus]]. This man of humble birth was consul in 9 and was the governor of [[Moesia]] from 12 ''-'' 35.&lt;ref name=moesia/&gt; Passed during his consulship was the [[Lex Papia Poppaea]], a law meant to strengthen and encourage marriage. Sabinus received a military triumph for ending a revolt in [[Thrace]] in 26. From 15 until his death, he served as Imperial [[Proconsul]] (or governor) of Greece and in other provinces. This competent administrator enjoyed the friendship of the Emperors [[Augustus]] and Tiberius. He died in late December of AD 35 from natural causes. After his death, Poppaea Sabina the Younger assumed the name of her maternal grandfather.

After Titus Ollius's death, Poppaea's mother married [[Publius Cornelius Lentulus Scipio]] the Elder, suffect consul, in 24. Her siblings included step-brother [[Publius Cornelius Lentulus Scipio (consul 56)|Publius Cornelius Lentulus Scipio]] the Younger, consul in 56, and half-brother [[Publius Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus]], suffect consul in 68.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Syme, ''The Augustan Aristocracy'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1986), p. 299&lt;/ref&gt;

==First marriage to Rufrius Crispinus==
Poppaea's first marriage was to [[Rufrius Crispinus]], a man of [[equestrian rank]]. They married in 44, when Poppaea was 14 years old. He was the leader of the [[Praetorian Guard]] during the first 10 years of the reign of the Emperor [[Claudius]] until 51 when Claudius' new wife [[Agrippina the Younger]] removed him from this position. Agrippina regarded him as loyal to the deceased Messalina's memory and replaced him with [[Sextus Afranius Burrus]]. Later, under [[Nero]], he was executed. During their marriage, Poppaea gave birth to his son, a younger Rufrius Crispinus, who, after her death, would be drowned by Nero while out on a fishing trip.

==Second marriage to Otho==
Poppaea then married [[Otho]], a good friend of the new Emperor Nero, who was seven years younger than she was. Nero fell in love with Poppaea, and she became Nero's mistress. According to [[Tacitus]], Poppaea divorced Otho in 58 and focused her attentions solely on becoming empress of Rome and Nero's new wife. Otho was ordered away to be governor of [[Lusitania]]. (A decade later, [[Year of the Four Emperors|he became emperor briefly after Nero's death in succession to]] [[Galba]].) [[Suetonius]] places these events after 59.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Caesars'' Life of Otho 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Empress of Rome and marriage to Nero==
According to Tacitus, Poppaea was ambitious and ruthless. He reports that Poppaea married Otho to get close to Nero, and then in turn, became Nero's favorite mistress.

===Deaths of Agrippina the Younger and Claudia Octavia===
Tacitus claims that Poppaea was the reason that Nero murdered his mother. Poppaea induced Nero to murder [[Agrippina the Younger|Agrippina]] in 59 so that she could marry him.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, Annals XIV.1&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholars, though, question the reliability of this story as Nero did not marry Poppaea until 62.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, Alexis, "Whatever Happened to Lady Agrippina?", The Classical Journal, 1969, p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Suetonius mentions how Poppaea's husband, Otho, was not sent away until after Agrippina's death, which makes it very unlikely that an already married woman would be pressing Nero to marry her.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Some modern historians theorize that Nero's decision to kill Agrippina was prompted by her plotting to set Gaius [[Rubellius Plautus]] (Nero's maternal second cousin) on the throne rather than as a result of Poppaea's motives.{{Citation needed|reason=According to whom?|date=February 2017}}

Still, Tacitus claims that, with Agrippina gone, Poppaea pressured Nero to divorce and later execute his first wife and stepsister [[Claudia Octavia]] in order to marry Poppaea. Octavia was initially dismissed to [[Campania]], coincidentally the same general geographic area that [[Pompeii]], Poppaea's place of birth, is located. She was then imprisoned on the island of Pandateria (modern [[Ventotene]]), a common place of banishment for members of the imperial family who fell from favor because of a charge of [[adultery]]. During his eight-year marriage to Claudia Octavia, Nero produced no children, and in AD 62, Poppaea became pregnant. When this happened, Nero divorced Octavia, claimed she was barren, and married Poppaea 12 days after the divorce.

The Jewish historian [[Josephus]] makes questionable claims of a very different Poppaea. He calls her a deeply religious woman who urged Nero to show compassion to the Jewish people. However, in fact, in 64 she secured the position of procurator of [[Iudaea Province|Judaea]] for [[Gessius Florus]], her friend's husband, who was harmful to the Jews.&lt;ref name=moesia/&gt;

She bore Nero one daughter, [[Claudia Augusta]], born on 21 January 63, who died at four months of age. At the birth of Claudia, Nero honored mother and child with the title of [[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]].&lt;ref&gt; See also the positive light cast on her by Girolamo Cardano in his ''Neronis Encomium'' printed in 1562 in Basel. Available in English as: ''Nero: an Exemplary Life'' Inkstone, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
The cause and timing of Poppaea's death is uncertain. According to Suetonius, while she was awaiting the birth of her second child in the summer of 65, she quarreled fiercely with Nero over his spending too much time at the races. In a fit of rage, Nero kicked her in the abdomen, causing her death.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''The Lives of Caesars'' Life of Nero 35.3&lt;/ref&gt; Tacitus, on the other hand, places the death after the Quinquennial Neronia and claims Nero's kick was a "casual outburst." Tacitus also mentions that some writers (now lost) claimed Nero poisoned her, though Tacitus does not believe them.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' XVI.6&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cassius Dio]] claims Nero leapt upon her belly, but admitted that he did not know if it was intentional or accidental.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Epitome of Book 62'', p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;
Modern historians, though, keep in mind Suetonius', Tacitus', and Cassius Dio's severe biases against Nero and the impossibility of their knowing private events, and hence recognize that Poppaea may have died due to fatal complications of [[miscarriage]] or [[stillbirth]].&lt;ref&gt;Rudich, Vasily, ''Political Dissidence Under Nero'', p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

When Poppaea died in 65, Nero went into deep mourning. Poppaea's body was not cremated but embalmed after the Egyptian fashion. She was given a [[state funeral]] and [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)#Divus, deus and the numen|divine honors]], and entombed in an as yet unidentified "Tomb of the Julii"&lt;!--Please do not link to [[Tomb of the Julii]]; that's just the popular name for a probably much later tomb--&gt;.  Nero supposedly burned a year's worth of Arabia's incense production at her funeral.&lt;ref&gt;Counts, Derek B., "Regum Externorum Consuetudine: The Nature and Function of Embalming in Rome", ''Classical Antiquity'', Vol. 15 No. 2, Oct., 1996; pp. 189-190: 193, note 18 "We should not consider it an insult that Poppaea was not buried in the Mausoleum of Augustus, as were other members of the imperial
family until the time of Nerva"; 196, note 37, citing Pliny the elder, ''Natural History'', 12.83 on incense at Poppaea's funeral. DOI: 10.2307/25011039 {{Subscription required |via=[[JSTOR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After that in 67, Nero ordered [[Sporus]], a young [[freedman]], to be castrated and then married him; according to Cassius Dio, Sporus bore an uncanny resemblance to Sabina, and Nero even called him by his dead wife’s name.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] |author=Smith, William |authorlink=William Smith (lexicographer) |publisher=C. C. Little and J. Brown; [etc., etc. ] |volume=3 |year=1849 |pages=1411, 2012|lccn=07038839}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reputation==
According to Cassius Dio, Poppaea enjoyed having [[milk bath]]s. She would have them daily because she was once told "therein lurked a magic which would dispel all diseases and blights from her beauty."

==References in art==
Fifteen centuries after her time, Poppaea was depicted in [[Claudio Monteverdi]]'s last opera ''[[L'incoronazione di Poppea]]'' (''The coronation of Poppaea'') of 1642. Her story clearly was chosen to appeal to the titillation favored in the nascent culture of the Venetian public opera theaters, and its prologue immediately explains that it is not a drama that promotes the triumph of virtue. Poppaea is portrayed as cynically plotting to become empress of Rome by manipulating the emperor Nero into marrying her, and her machinations include the execution of [[Seneca the Younger]], who opposes her plans, which are successful at the end of the drama. 

Poppaea is a principal character also in [[Handel]]'s opera ''[[Agrippina (opera)|Agrippina]]'' of 1709, but as a victim, not a perpetrator, of deceit and manipulation. Here the schemer is [[Agrippina the Younger|Agrippina]], Nero's mother, intent on promoting her son's claim to the throne. Poppaea, the ingenue, is portrayed as the object of desire of [[Claudius]], Nero, and Otho, each of whom served for a time as Roman Emperor, whose rivalries Agrippina attempts to leverage to her advantage. Once Poppaea sees through Agrippina's deceit, she responds in kind, but only in order to be united with Otho, portrayed as her one true love. 

==In film==
Poppaea appears as a character in the several cinema and TV versions of [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]]'s novel ''[[Quo Vadis (novel)|Quo Vadis]]''. In the 1951 film version - in which she is played by [[Patricia Laffan]] in a widely-praised performance - she is strangled to death by Nero, who blames her for turning his 'loyal subjects' the Roman populace against him. (This form of murder may have been suggested to the screenwriters by [[Tacitus]]' claim that Nero had made several unsuccessful attempts at strangling his first wife, Octavia, when drunk.)

Another portrayal of Poppaea is featured in the 1932 film ''[[The Sign of the Cross (1932 film)|The Sign of the Cross]]''. She is seen bathing in asses' milk. Daringly for the time, she is portrayed (by [[Claudette Colbert]]) as being openly bisexual, suggestively inviting a female slave to bathe with her in the asses' milk, but lusting after Roman soldier Marcus Superbus ([[Fredric March]]).

In the 1976 BBC TV series ''[[I, Claudius]]'', Poppaea was played by [[Sally Bazely]].

In ''[[Quo Vadis? (miniseries)|Quo vadis]]'', an international TV mini-series from 1985 based upon a novel by 19th-century Polish writer [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]], Poppaea was portrayed by [[Cristina Raines]]. 

[[Kara Tointon]] played Poppaea in 2003's ''[[Boudica (film)|Boudica]]'', also known as ''Warrior Queen'' in the United States.

Poppaea is portrayed by [[Catherine McCormack]] in the 2006 BBC docu-drama ''[[Ancient Rome: The Rise and Fall of an Empire]]''. In this interpretation, she is kicked to death by Nero after offhandedly and uncritically mentioning a minor glitch during his performance at the [[Quinquennial Neronia]]. Her corpse is later shown mounted on display.

[[Rachel Yakar]] plays the part of Poppaea in the 1979 musical film of [[L'incoronazione di Poppea]] directed by [[Nikolaus Harnoncourt]].

==In popular culture==
In [[Mel Brooks]]' 1968 film ''[[The Producers (1968 film)|The Producers]]'', Leo Bloom is terrified at Max Bialystock when the large man stands over him, and, in reference to the ancient accounts of Poppaea's death, screams "You're going to jump on me. I know you're going to jump on me – like Nero jumped on Poppaea... Poppaea. She was his wife. And she was unfaithful to him.  So he got mad and he jumped on her. Up and down, up and down, until he squashed her like a bug. Please don't jump on me!"

The Gothic metal band [[Theatre of Tragedy]] wrote a song titled "Poppæa", inspired by her story, on their myth-based album ''[[Aégis]]''.

'''Pál Király''' (1880&amp;ndash;1965) was a [[Hungary|Hungaria]]n engineer and weapons designer.

==Personal life==
Pál Dedai Király was born in Budapest, Hungary where he earned his degree in Machine Design at the Technical University of Budapest in 1902. He became a Professor's Assistant at the university. He also earned a Military Reservist degree with an Artillery Lieutenant rank. During World War 1 he served in the military and reached a rank of Artillery Captain. In 1915 he wrote his first publication about automatic weapons. After the war, Hungary was prohibited from weapon development, so he moved to Switzerland and worked for SIG Neuhausen.
 
From 1928 weapon development was again allowed in Hungary, so Király started to develop automatic weapons for Hungary. SIG refused to release some of Király's research to Hungary as they originally agreed, so Király moved back to Hungary to work with the Danuvia Rt, but he still worked for SIG under contracts in the 1930s. During 1929-44 he was paid from the Danuvia Factory's profit sharings.

In 1945 Király escaped to Switzerland before the Soviets arrived. In 1947 he moved to the Dominican Republic, where he was employed by the Armeria of San Cristóbal, ran by a fellow Hungarian, Sándor Kovács. Király developed several weapons there, the most successful of which was his Cristóbal Carbine, of which 250,000 were sold. His last design was adopted in 1962, when he was 82.

==Work and designs==
Király's career as weapon designer had its beginnings in Switzerland, where he emigrated after [[World War I]]. In the 1920s he developed the SIG KE 7 machine gun and the SIG MKMO machine-carbine. The MKMO (and its shortened variant, MKPO) was successfully sold to various countries in 7.63mm and 9mm Mauser and 7.65mm and 9mm Parabellum chamberings.

In 1929 Király designed an advanced 9×19mm pistol, designated the 'KD Danuvia' of which 20 guns were manufactured for trials.

Király's most significant development is the [[Blowback (arms)#Lever delayed|lever-delayed blowback]] working principle, successfully applied in many of his designs. Examples are the machine carbines Danuvia 39.M and [[Danuvia 43M submachine gun|Danuvia 43.M]], and it is also used in the French [[FAMAS]] assault rifle.
 
In 1932 Király designed a self-loading (automatic rifle), which was the first automatic rifle in the world utilizing a muzzle brake (The more famous Simonov Model 1936 featured the first muzzle brake outside Hungary, 4 years later). The Király rifle was very well balanced and weighed less than {{convert|4|kg|lb}}. It had a well-sealed, dust-proof operating mechanism and came with a small 10-round box magazine.

In 1933 Király introduced a larger version of his 1932 automatic rifle. This gun weighed {{convert|6.5|kg|lb}}, had a heavier and longer barrel, a large 80-round magazine and a muzzle brake.

In July 1934, the Italians reviewed Danuvia's available arsenal, showed interest, but eventually decided to stay with their own weapons, except for the 12.7mm Gebauer GKM, to which the Italians had no equivalent.

In 1938, [[Birmingham Small Arms Company|BSA]] in the [[United Kingdom]] acquired the blueprints for Pál Király's submachine gun/machine carbine as well as the rights to manufacture it. Examples were produced in [[9mm Mauser Export]] caliber according to Király's design. BSA estimated that these arms would only cost 5 pounds each to manufacture. However, in the UK, military officials viewed submachine guns as "gangster weapons" and therefore inappropriate for regular troops. Plans to manufacture it were shelved.

In 1939 the Honvédség adopted Király's machine carbine with the Danuvia 39.M designation. A modernized version was adopted in 1943 under the [[Danuvia 43M submachine gun|Danuvia 43.M]] designation. His last Hungarian design, designated Danuvia 44.M was not adopted due to the Soviet invasion of Hungary. His 44.M design was the basis of the Hungarian Kucher K1 Machine Pistol in 1951.
He designed the Danuvia 39M and improved it into the [[Danuvia 43M submachine gun|Danuvia 43M Submachine gun]].

After he moved to the Dominican Republic, he designed the [[Cristobal (carbine)|.30 Kiraly-Cristobal carbine]], which was essentially a copy of his earlier work, specifically the 44M (an improved 43M). He made two more Cristobal carbine versions, the delayed blowback M2 ([[Cristobal Automatic Carbine]]) in [[.30 Carbine]] and the [[Cristobal Model 3|gas-operated M3]] in [[7.62×51mm NATO]]. He patented the latter in 1961 as a competitor to the Belgian [[FN FAL]].&lt;ref&gt;Sunblest.net, [http://www.sunblest.net/gun/Cristo.htm Kiraly-Cristobal Submachine Guns &amp; Machine Pistols] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103212755/http://www.sunblest.net/gun/Cristo.htm |date=2007-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His .30 Carbine M2 model was manufactured in about 200,000 exemplars between 1950 and 1966, and "it remained in service until the late 1980s or early 1990s". Although a semi-automatic weapon, its design was "more akin to submachine guns such as the [[Beretta Model 38]] and the Hungarian 39M."&lt;ref name="Thompson2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Leroy Thompson|title=The M1 Carbine|year=2011|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-1-84908-619-6|pages=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ray Milton Dolby''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|OBEh}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|oʊ|l|b|i|,_|ˈ|d|ɔː|l|-}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/dolby "Dolby"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; January 18, 1933&amp;nbsp;– September 12, 2013) was an [[Americans|American]] [[engineer]] and inventor of the [[Noise (electronics)|noise]] reduction system known as [[Dolby noise-reduction system|Dolby NR]]. He helped develop the [[video tape recorder]] while at [[Ampex]] and was the founder of [[Dolby Laboratories]].

==Early life==
Dolby was born in [[Portland, Oregon]], the son of Esther Eufemia (née Strand) and Earl Milton Dolby, an inventor. He attended [[Sequoia High School (Redwood City, California)|Sequoia High School]] (class of 1951) in [[Redwood City, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2009/03/27/sequoia-high-school-alumni-inducted-into-hall-of-fame/|title=Sequoia High School alumni inducted into Hall of Fame|last=Bishop|first=Shaun|date=2009-03-27|work=The Mercury News|access-date=2018-04-06|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a teenager in the decade following World War II, he held part-time and [[summer]] [[Job (role)|jobs]] at [[Ampex]] in Redwood City,&lt;ref&gt;[http://simplyknowledge.com/popular/biography/ray-dolby] Biography of Ray Dolby&lt;/ref&gt; working with their first [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]] tape recorder in 1949. While at [[San Jose State University|San Jose State College]] and later at [[Stanford University]] (interrupted by two years of [[United States Army|Army]] service),&lt;ref name="racetovideo"/&gt; he worked on early [[prototype]]s of [[video tape recorder]] technologies for [[Alexander M. Poniatoff]] and [[Charlie Ginsburg]]. As a non degree-holding "consultant",&lt;ref name="racetovideo"/&gt; Dolby played a key role in the effort that led Ampex to unveil their prototype [[Quadruplex videotape|Quadruplex]] videotape recorder in April 1956 which soon entered production.&lt;ref name="racetovideo"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wolpin |first=Stewart |url=http://stewartwolpin.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Race-To-Video-100.pdf |title=The Race to Video |journal=[[American Heritage of Invention &amp; Technology]] |date=Fall 1994 |volume=10 |number=2 |issn=8756-7296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1957, Dolby received his [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in [[electrical engineering]] from Stanford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/13/business/ray-dolby-who-put-moviegoers-in-the-middle-is-dead-at-80.html |title=Ray Dolby, Who Put Moviegoers in the Middle of It, Is Dead at 80 |first=Natasha |last=Singer |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=A20 |date=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He subsequently won a [[Marshall Scholarship]] for a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] (1961) in [[physics]] from the [[University of Cambridge]], where he was a Research Fellow at [[Pembroke College, Cambridge|Pembroke College]].

After Cambridge, Dolby acted as a technical advisor to the [[United Nations]] in India, until 1965 when he returned to England, where he founded [[Dolby Laboratories]] in London with a staff of four. In that same year, 1965, he officially invented the Dolby Sound System, a form of [[audio signal processing]]. His first U.S. patent was not filed until 1969, four years later.  The filter was first used by [[Decca Records]] in the UK.&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/ray-dolby-obituary-inventor-whose-noisereduction-technology-transformed-sound-reproduction-8815543.html|title=Ray Dolby obituary: Inventor whose noise-reduction technology transformed sound reproduction |last=Williamson |first=Marcus |authorlink=Marcus Williamson |date=13 September 2013|newspaper=[[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dolby was a [[Fellow (society)|Fellow]] and past president of the [[Audio Engineering Society]].

==Death==
Dolby died of [[leukemia]] on September 12, 2013, at his home in San Francisco at the age of 80.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Founder and Director Emeritus of Dolby Laboratories Dies at Age 80| publisher = [[Dolby Laboratories]] | date = September 12, 2013 | url = http://investor.dolby.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=790493}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dolby was survived by his wife [[Dagmar Dolby|Dagmar]], two sons, [[Tom Dolby|Tom]] and David, and four grandchildren.&lt;ref name=indy&gt;{{cite news |title=A minute's silence: audio pioneer Ray Dolby dies aged 80 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/a-minutes-silence-audio-pioneer-ray-dolby-dies-aged-80-8814025.html | newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date = September 13, 2013 | first = James | last = Vincent}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kevin Yeaman, president and chief executive of Dolby Laboratories, said "Today we lost a friend, mentor and true visionary."&lt;ref name=indy/&gt; [[Neil Portnow]], president of the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]], said Dolby had "changed the way we listen to music and movies for nearly 50 years" and that Dolby's "technologies have become an essential part of the creative process for recording artists and filmmakers, ensuring his remarkable legacy for generations to come."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-24075429 | title = Audio pioneer Ray Dolby dies aged 80 | publisher=[[BBC News]] |date = September 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dolby noise reduction==
{{Main|Dolby noise-reduction system}}
The analog Dolby B noise-reduction system works by compressing and increasing the volume of low-level high-frequency sounds during recording and correspondingly reverses the process during playback.

'''J. Richard Greenwell''' (1942 – November 1, 2005) was a renowned [[cryptozoologist]] and [[explorer]]. During his lifetime he participated in many expeditions to look for mysterious creatures or [[cryptids]]. He served as the secretary for the [[International Society for Cryptozoology]] from its inception to his death.

==Biography==
Born in [[Surrey, England]], Greenwell travelled to [[South America]] and stayed there for six years. He later travelled to [[Tucson, Arizona]], where he was appointed research coordinator for the Office of Arid Land Studies at the [[University of Arizona]]. During the 1970s, he was Assistant Director of the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization (APRO) in Tucson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The A.P.R.O. Bulletin|url=http://www.openminds.tv/pdf/apro-bulletins-searchable/01_APRO_Nov_Dec_1971.pdf|publisher=Aerial Phenomena Research Organization|accessdate=December 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cryptozoology and expeditions===
In 1982, Greenwell, after a discussion with [[Roy Mackal]], helped to found the [[International Society for Cryptozoology]]. With funding from the society, he was able to travel the planet searching for elusive creatures such as [[Bigfoot]], the [[Onza]], and [[Mokele-mbembe]]. He also journeyed to [[China]] along with the anthropologist [[Frank Poirier]] to try to discover the [[Yeren]], a Chinese version of the Bigfoot. All of the expeditions, while unsuccessful, helped to keep awareness of mysterious creatures alive.

===Later life===
Greenwell, until his death, continued in the search for [[cryptids]]. He wrote a column for [[BBC Wildlife Magazine]] for several years. He also appeared as a paid consultant on various documentaries covering the subject of cryptozoology. He lectured at many universities and museums, discussing his experiences. For the last several years of his life, Greenwell was a research associate at the International Wildlife Museum in Tucson, where he also ran the International Society for Cryptozoology. Greenwell participated on his last expedition in August 2005, searching for scientific proof of Bigfoot in the North Californian wilderness, even though he was in the last stages of [[cancer]]. He died on the evening of November 1, 2005, in Tucson, Arizona.

'''Samuel "Sam" Selvon'''  (20 May 1923 &amp;ndash; 16 April 1994)&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/533759/Samuel-Selvon "Samuel Selvon"], Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidad]]-born writer. His 1956 novel ''[[The Lonely Londoners]]'' is groundbreaking in its use of creolised English, or "[[nation language]]", for narrative as well as dialogue.

==Life and work==
Samuel Dickson Selvon was born in [[San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago|San Fernando]] in the south of Trinidad, and  is the sixth of seven children.&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;Kenneth Ramchand, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/69606 "Selvon, Samuel Dickson (1923–1994)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, October 2006. Accessed 19 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  His parents were [[Indo-Trinidadian and Tobagonian|Indian]]: his father was a first-generation [[Christian]] immigrant from [[Madras]] and his mother was a [[Christian]] [[Anglo-Indian]]. His maternal grandfather was [[Scottish people|Scottish]] and his maternal grandmother was [[Indian people|Indian]].&lt;ref&gt;Louis James, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-sam-selvon-1371231.html "Obituary: Sam Selvon"], ''The Independent'', 20 April 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[Naparima College]], San Fernando, before leaving at the age of 15 to work. He was a wireless operator with the local branch of the [[Royal Naval Reserve]] from 1940 to 1945 during the [[Second World War]]. Thereafter, he moved north to [[Port of Spain]], and from 1945 to 1950, worked for the ''[[Trinidad Guardian]]'' as a reporter and for a time on its literary page. In this period, he began writing stories and descriptive pieces, mostly under a variety of pseudonyms including Michael Wentworth, Esses, Ack-Ack, and Big Buffer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peepaltreepress.com/author_display.asp?au_id=84 Author profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201113018/http://www.peepaltreepress.com/author_display.asp?au_id=84 |date=1 February 2009 }} at Peepal Tree Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this early writing is to be found in ''Foreday Morning'' (eds [[Kenneth Ramchand]] and Susheila Nasta, 1989).

Selvon moved to [[London, England]], in the 1950s, where he worked as a clerk for the Indian Embassy, while writing in his spare time.&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt; His short stories and poetry appeared in various publications, including the ''[[London Magazine]]'', ''[[New Statesman]]'', and ''The Nation''. In London he also worked with the [[BBC]], producing two television scripts, ''Anansi the Spiderman'', and ''Home Sweet India''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://caribbean.halloffame.tripod.com/Samuel_Selvon.html "Samuel Selvon"], Caribbean Hall of Fame.&lt;/ref&gt;

Selvon was a fellow in creative writing at the [[University of Dundee]] from 1975 until 1977.&lt;ref name="Dundee"&gt;{{cite web|title=RU 258/7/4 Department of English. Creative Writing, publicity material|url=http://arccat.dundee.ac.uk/dserve.exe?&amp;dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=((text)=%27selvon%27)|website=Archive Services Online Catalogue|publisher=University of Dundee|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1970s Selvon moved to [[Alberta]], [[Canada]], and found a job teaching creative writing as a visiting professor at the [[University of Victoria]]. When that job ended, he took a job as a janitor at the [[University of Calgary]] in Alberta for a few months before becoming writer-in-residence there. He was largely ignored by the Canadian literary establishment, with his works receiving no reviews during his residency.

On a return trip to Trinidad Selvon died of [[respiratory failure]] due to extensive [[bronchopneumonia]] and chronic [[lung disease]] on 16 April 1994 at [[Piarco International Airport]]; his ashes were subsequently interred at the [[University of the West Indies]] cemetery, [[St Augustine, Trinidad]].&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt;

Selvon married twice: in 1947 to Draupadi Persaud, with whom he had one daughter, and in 1963 to Althea Daroux, with whom he had two sons and a daughter.

==Writing==
Selvon is best known for his novels ''[[The Lonely Londoners]]'' (1956) and ''[[Moses Ascending]]'' (1975). His novel ''[[A Brighter Sun]]'' (1952), detailing the construction of the [[Churchill-Roosevelt Highway]] in Trinidad through the eyes of young Indian worker Tiger, was a popular choice on the [[CXC]] [[English Literature]] [[syllabus]] for many years. Other notable works include the collection of stories ''Ways of Sunlight'' (1957), ''Turn Again Tiger'' (1958) and ''Those Who Eat the Cascadura'' (1972). During the 1970s and early 1980s, Selvon converted several of his novels and stories into radio scripts, broadcast by the [[BBC]], which were collected in ''Eldorado West One'' (Peepal Tree Press, 1988) and ''Highway in the Sun'' ([[Peepal Tree Press]], 1991).

''The Lonely Londoners'', like most of Selvon's later work, focuses on the migration of West Indians to Britain in the 1950s and 1960s, and tells, mostly in anecdotal form, the daily experience of settlers from Africa and the Caribbean. Selvon also illustrates the panoply of different subcultures that exist within London, as with any major city, due to class and racial boundaries. In many ways, his books are the precursors to works such as ''[[White Teeth]]'' by [[Zadie Smith]] and ''[[The Buddha of Suburbia (novel)|The Buddha of Suburbia]]'' by [[Hanif Kureishi]]&lt;ref name="The British Library 2016"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Lonely Londoners by Samuel Selvon | publisher=The British Library | date=25 April 2016 | url=https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/the-lonely-londoners-by-samuel-selvon | access-date=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Selvon explained: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"When I wrote the novel that became ''The Lonely Londoners'', I tried to recapture a certain quality in West Indian everyday life. I had in store a number of wonderful anecdotes and could put them into focus, but I had difficulty starting the novel in straight English. The people I wanted to describe were entertaining people indeed, but I could not really move. At that stage, I had written the narrative in English and most of the dialogues in dialect. Then I started both narrative and dialogue in dialect and the novel just shot along."&lt;ref&gt;Michel Fabre, "Samuel Selvon: Interviews and Conversations", in Susheila Nasta (ed.), ''Critical Perspectives on Sam Selvon'', Washington: Three Continents Press, 1988; p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Selvon's papers are now at the [[Harry Ransom Center|Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center]] at the [[University of Texas, Austin]], USA. These consist of [[holograph|holograph manuscripts]], typescripts, book proofs, manuscript notebooks, and correspondence. Drafts for six of his 11 novels are present, along with supporting correspondence and items relating to his career.&lt;ref&gt;[http://research.hrc.utexas.edu:8080/hrcxtf/view?docId=ead/00119.xml "Samuel Selvon]: An Inventory of His Papers at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Selvon was awarded two [[Guggenheim Fellowships]] (in 1955 and 1968),&lt;ref name=NALIS&gt;[http://www.nalis.gov.tt/Research/SubjectGuide/Biographies/BiographiesSZ/tabid/292/Default.aspx?PageContentID=1145 "Sam Selvon"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113063015/http://www.nalis.gov.tt/Research/SubjectGuide/Biographies/BiographiesSZ/tabid/292/Default.aspx?PageContentID=1145 |date=13 November 2014 }}, Trinidad and Tobago National Library and Information Service (NALIS).&lt;/ref&gt; an honorary doctorate from [[Warwick University]] in 1989, and in 1985 the honorary degree of DLitt by the University of the West Indies.&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt; In 1969 he was awarded the Trinidad &amp; Tobago [[Hummingbird Medal|Hummingbird Medal Gold]] for Literature, and in 1994 he was (posthumously) given another national award, the [[Chaconia Medal|Chaconia Medal Gold]] for Literature.&lt;ref name=NALIS /&gt; In 2012 he was honoured with a [[NALIS]] Lifetime Achievement Literary Award for his contributions to Trinidad and Tobago's literature.&lt;ref name=NALIS /&gt;

'''Sidney Rigdon''' (February 19, 1793 – July 14, 1876) was a leader during the early history of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]].

==Biography==
Rigdon was born in [[St. Clair Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|St. Clair Township]], [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania]], about 10 miles south of [[Pittsburgh]]. (The area today is known as Library.) He was the youngest of four children of William and Nancy Rigdon. Rigdon's father was a farmer and a native of [[Harford County, Maryland]].

===Early life===
Sidney's father William Rigdon died in 1810.

According to an 1875 account attributed to Sidney Rigdon's elder brother, as a child Rigdon had suffered an accident that caused a "contusion of the brain". His brother reportedly claimed that he "always considered Sidney a little deranged in his mind by that accident. His mental powers did not seem to be impaired, but the equilibrium in his intellectual exertions seemed thereby to have been sadly affected. He still manifested great mental activity and power, but he was to an equal degree inclined to run into wild and visionary views on almost every question."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/dbroadhu/PA/penn1860.htm#030175|title=Uncle Dale's Old Mormon Articles: Pennsylvania, 1850-1899|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f3XzioqxpaMC|title=Volume III a Divided Mormon Zion: Northeastern Ohio Or Western Missouri?|first=John|last=Hammond|date=1 May 2012|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|via=Google Books}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This account was not published until more than 60 years after the accident.

According to an account by his son John M. Rigdon, young Rigdon "borrowed all the histories he could get and began to read them. ... In this way he became a great historian, the best I ever saw. He seemed to have the history of the world on his tongue's end and he got to be a great biblical scholar as well. He was as familiar with the Bible as a child was with his spelling book. He was never known to play with the boys; reading books was the greatest pleasure he could get. He studied English Grammar alone and became a very fine grammarian. He was very precise in his language."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sedgwickresearch.com/philo/even%20more%20philo%20stuff.htm|title=Wilford woodruff collected discourses|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rigdon remained on the farm until his mother sold it in 1818.

===Baptist ministry and tanner===
On May 31, 1817, Rigdon was baptized by Rev. Phillips and he became a member of the Peter's Creek Baptist Church of Library, Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="sidneyrigdon.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/Rigdchrn.htm|title=Sidney Rigdon Chronology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1818, Rigdon moved to North Sewickley to become an apprentice to Baptist minister Rev. Andrew Clark. Rigdon received his license to preach for the [[Regular Baptist]]s in March 1819.

Rigdon moved in May to [[Trumbull County, Ohio]], where he jointly preached with Adamson Bentley from July 1819. He married Bentley's wife's sister, Phoebe Brooks in June 1820, and remained in Ohio until February 1822, when he returned to Pittsburgh to accept the pastorate of the First Baptist Church there under the recommendation of [[Alexander Campbell (Restoration movement)|Alexander Campbell]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Times and Seasons]]'' May 1, 1843. p. 177 in 1986 reprint by Independence Press, {{ISBN|0-8309-0467-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rigdon and Bentley had journeyed to meet Campbell in the summer of 1821, to learn more about the Baptist who was encountering opposition to his idea that the [[New Testament]] should hold priority over the [[Old Testament]] in the Christian church. They engaged in lengthy discussions, with both men joining the [[Disciples of Christ (Campbell Movement)|Disciples of Christ movement]] associated with Campbell.

On January 28, 1822, Rigdon arrived in Pittsburgh to become minister at the First Baptist Church.&lt;ref name="sidneyrigdon.com"/&gt; Rigdon's ministry met with opposition from member Rev. John Winter, and on July 11, 1823, a schism split the congregation, with each side disfellowshipping the other. On October 11, Rigdon was "excluded from the [[Redstone Baptist Association|Redstone Association]] Baptist Denomination", of which the First Baptist Church was a member.&lt;ref name="sidneyrigdon.com"/&gt;

From 1824 to 1826, Rigdon worked as a [[journeyman]] [[Tanning (leather)|tanner]] in Pittsburgh, while preaching Campbell's [[Restorationism (Christian primitivism)|Restorationism]] on Sundays in the courthouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/features/tannery1.htm|title=SidneyRigdonDotCom Feature Articles: Sidney Rigdon, Journeyman Tanner|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1826, Rigdon became the pastor of the more liberal Baptist church in [[Mentor, Ohio]] in the [[Western Reserve]].

===Latter Day Saint leader in Ohio, Missouri, and Illinois (1830–44)===
Many prominent early Latter Day Saint leaders, including [[Parley P. Pratt]], [[Isaac Morley]] and [[Edward Partridge]], were members of Rigdon's congregations prior to their conversion to the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)]] founded by [[Joseph Smith]].

====Early involvement====
In early September 1830, Rigdon's associate, Pratt, was baptized into the Church of Christ founded by Smith (later known as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints). In October, Pratt and [[Ziba Peterson]] began a mission to preach to the [[American Indians in the United States|American Indians]].

They visited Rigdon in Ohio. Rigdon read the [[Book of Mormon]], proclaimed its truthfulness, and was baptized into the church. He proceeded to convert hundreds of members of his Ohio congregations. In December 1830, Rigdon traveled to New York, where he met Smith.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=July 2015}}

Rigdon was a fiery orator and he was immediately called by Smith to be the spokesman for the church. He also served as a scribe and helped with [[Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible|Smith's re-translation]] of the [[Bible]].

; Rigdon as revelator
Rigdon reportedly received visions jointly with Smith. According to one account: "Joseph would, at intervals, say: 'What do I see?' as one might say while looking out the window and beholding what all in the room could not see. Then he would relate what he had seen or what he was looking at. Then Sidney replied, 'I see the same.' Presently Sidney would say 'what do I see?' and would repeat what he had seen or was seeing, and Joseph would reply, 'I see the same.' This manner of conversation was repeated at short intervals to the end of the vision".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boap.org/LDS/Early-Saints/REC-JS.html|title=Recollections About Joseph Smith|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kirtland, Ohio, 1830–37====
In December 1830, Smith said he received a revelation counseling members of the church in New York to gather to [[Kirtland, Ohio]]. Many of the doctrines Rigdon's group had experimented with found place in the combined movement, such as living with all things in common.
; August/September 1831&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt; Rigdon rebuked
In August 1831, Smith announced that he had received a revelation admonishing Rigdon for exalting himself: "And now behold, verily I say unto you, I, the Lord, am not pleased with my servant Sidney Rigdon; he exalted himself in his heart, and received not counsel, but grieved the Spirit; Wherefore his writing is not acceptable unto the Lord, and he shall make another; and if the Lord receive it not, behold he standeth no longer in the office to which I have appointed him. ... Wherefore, let all men beware how they take my name in their lips—For behold, verily I say, that many there be who are under this condemnation, who use the name of the Lord, and use it in vain, having not authority. Wherefore, let the church repent of their sins, and I, the Lord, will own them otherwise they shall be cut off."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boap.org/LDS/History/History_of_the_Church/Vol_1&lt;/ref&gt;

; March 1832&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt; Tarred and feathered
Smith relocated to [[Hiram, Ohio]], in September 1831. Smith and Rigdon were tarred and feathered at the [[John Johnson Farm]] on March 24, 1832. Smith recorded: "The next morning I went to see elder Rigdon, and found him crazy, and his head highly inflamed, for they had dragged him by his heels, and those too, so high from the earth he could not raise his head from the rough frozen surface, which lascerated it exceedingly; and when he saw me he called to his wife to bring him his razor. She asked him what he wanted of it? and he replied to kill me. Sister Rigdon left the room, and he asked me to bring his razor. I asked him what he wanted of it, and he replied he wanted to kill his wife, and he continued delirious some days."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-CxOAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA243&amp;lpg=PA243|title=History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, 1805-1890|first=Heman Conoman|last=Smith|date=1 January 1917|publisher=Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day saints|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; July 1832&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt; "Rigdon's depression"
{{wikiquote|Lucy Mack Smith#"Rigdon's Depression"|"Rigdon's Depression"}}
On July 5, 1832, Rigdon taught that "the keys of the kingdom were taken from us. On hearing this, many of his hearers wept, and when some one undertook to dismiss the meeting by prayer he said praying would do them no good, and the meeting broke up in confusion."&lt;ref name="boap.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boap.org/LDS/Early-Saints/PDibble.html|title=Autobiography of Philo Dibble (1806-1895)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, [[Hyrum Smith]] traveled to retrieve Joseph Smith, who returned to Kirtland on July 7. Joseph Smith rebuked Rigdon, and publicly prophesied that "[n]o power can pluck those keys from me, except the power that gave them to me; But for what Sidney has done, the devil shall handle him as one man handles another."&lt;ref name="boap.org"/&gt;

Reportedly, "About three weeks after this, Sidney was lying on his bed alone. An unseen power lifted him from his bed, threw him across the room, and tossed him from one side of the room to the other. The noise being heard in the adjoining room, his family went in to see what was the matter, and found him going from one side of the room to the other, from the effects of which Sidney was laid up for five or six weeks. Thus was Joseph's prediction in regard to him verified. "&lt;ref name="boap.org"/&gt;

On July 28, Smith re-ordained Rigdon to the high priesthood for "the Second time" after Rigdon had "repented like Peter of old."

; First Presidency

When Smith organized the church's [[First Presidency]], he set apart [[Jesse Gause]] and Rigdon as his first two counselors. Smith and Rigdon became close partners, and Rigdon tended to supplant [[Oliver Cowdery]], the original "[[Assistant President of the Church|Second Elder]]" of the church.

Rigdon became a strong advocate of the construction of the [[Kirtland Temple]]. When the church founded the [[Kirtland Safety Society]], Rigdon became the bank's president and Smith served as its cashier. When the bank failed in 1837, Rigdon and Smith were both blamed by Mormon dissenters.

====Far West, Missouri, 1838====
Rigdon and Smith moved to [[Far West, Missouri]] and established a new church headquarters there.

According to one report, while the Mormons were encamped at [[Adam-ondi-Ahman]], Rigdon criticized Smith and others who were engaged in recreational wrestling on Sunday. Rigdon reportedly "rushed into the ring, sword in hand, and said that he would not suffer a lot of men to break the Sabbath day in that manner." Smith "dragged him from the ring, bareheaded, and tore Rigdon's fine pulpit coat from the collar to the waist". Reportedly, "after that Rigdon never countermanded the orders of the Prophet, to my knowledge—he knew who was boss."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://antimormon.8m.com/leechp5.html|title=Confessions of John D. Lee. Chapter V.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As spokesman for the First Presidency, Rigdon preached several controversial sermons in Missouri, including the [[Salt Sermon]] and the [[Rigdon's July 4th oration|July 4th Oration]].&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Oration Delivered by Mr. S. Rigdon on the 4th of July at Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Oration Delivered by Mr. S. Rigdon on the 4th of July at Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri]], 1838&lt;/ref&gt; These speeches have sometimes been seen as contributing to the conflict known as the [[Mormon War (1838)|1838 Mormon War]] in Missouri.

As a result of the conflict, the Mormons were expelled from the state and Rigdon and Smith were arrested and imprisoned in [[Liberty Jail]]. Rigdon was released on a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' and made his way to [[Illinois]], where he joined the main body of Mormon refugees in 1839.

====Nauvoo, Illinois, 1839–44====
Smith and his followers were allowed to escape from Liberty Jail in Missouri as ordered by Lt. Governor Boggs, and so they were released by a sheriff on their way to stand trial. Smith went on to found the city of [[Nauvoo, Illinois]]. Rigdon continued to act as church spokesman and gave a speech at the ground-breaking of the [[Nauvoo Temple]]. On June 1, 1841, Sidney Rigdon was ordained as a "[[Prophet, seer, and revelator|Prophet, Seer and Revelator]]".&lt;ref name = McKiernan&gt;{{cite book |last= McKiernan |first= F. Mark |title= The Voice of One Crying in the Wilderness: Sidney Rigdon, Religious Reformer |origyear= 1971 |year= 1979 |publisher= [[Herald House]] |location= Independence, Missouri |isbn= 9780830902415 |oclc= 5436337 |page= 56 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Smith and Rigdon's relationship began to deteriorate in Nauvoo. Rigdon's participation in church administrative affairs became minimal. He did not reside in Nauvoo and served in a local church presidency in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. He was also in poor health.

;October 1843&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt; Smith attempts to replace Rigdon
In October, 1843, a Special Conference was called to consider "the case and standing of Elder Sidney Rigdon".&lt;ref name="restorationisten.fairmormon.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://restorationisten.fairmormon.org/Times_and_Seasons/4/21#330|title=Times and Seasons/4/21 - FairMormon|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Smith "stated his dissatisfaction" with Rigdon. Charges were leveled that Rigdon had correspondence "of a treacherous nature" with [[John C. Bennett]], former Governor Carlin, and "the Missourians". Rigdon was also accused to "leaguing with dishonest persons in endeavoring to defraud the innocent". In "indirect testimony" from [[Porter Rockwell]]'s mother, Rigdon was accused of having had been responsible for informing others about Smith's visit to Dixon and instructing them to arrest him while there.&lt;ref name="restorationisten.fairmormon.org"/&gt;

Smith told the conference that, in light of the charges, Smith requested Rigdon be replaced as First Counselor.&lt;ref name="restorationisten.fairmormon.org"/&gt;

The ''[[Times and Seasons]]'' and the ''[[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]]'' both record that Rigdon addressed the conference, denied the charges and made a "moving appeal"; they record "the sympathies of the congregation were highly excited". A vote was called and the congregation held that Rigdon would be permitted to retain his position.&lt;ref name="restorationisten.fairmormon.org"/&gt;

According to the ''Times and Seasons'', Smith had "wholly removed suspicion from elder Sidney Rigdon" and "expressed entire willingness to have elder Sidney Rigdon retain his station", despite a "lack of confidence in his integrity and steadfastness, judging from their past intercourse". Alternately, the ''History of the Church'' records that Smith replied to the vote by saying, "I have thrown him off my shoulders, and you have again put him on me. You may carry him, but I will not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://restorationisten.fairmormon.org/Mormonism_and_history/Censorship_and_revision/Sidney_Rigdon_trial_in_Times_and_Seasons_versus_History_of_the_Church|title=Mormonism and history/Censorship and revision/Sidney Rigdon trial in Times and Seasons versus History of the Church - FairMormon|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Smith]] ([[B. H. Roberts]] (ed), 1902) ''[[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]]'', vol. 6, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

;1844&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt; Rigdon as Vice-Presidential candidate
When Smith began [[Joseph Smith presidential campaign, 1844|his campaign]] for the [[President of the United States|presidency]] of the [[United States]] in [[United States presidential election, 1844|1844]], Rigdon was selected as his [[Vice President of the United States|vice-presidential]] running mate. After Smith's death, Rigdon was the senior surviving member of the First Presidency. (The other members were [[John Smith (uncle of Joseph Smith)|John Smith]], who was an assistant counselor, and [[Amasa Lyman]], who was a counselor.) During this time, Rigdon was strongly opposed to [[Polygamy and the Latter Day Saint movement|polygamy]] and other innovations within the church.&lt;ref name="McKiernan 1979 p"&gt;{{harvnb|McKiernan|1979|p=}}{{Page needed|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath of Smith's death===
{{See also|Succession crisis (Latter Day Saints)}}

Joseph Smith [[Death of Joseph Smith|was killed]] in 1844. Prior to Smith's death, the First Presidency had made nearly all the major decisions for the church. In 1841, Rigdon had been ordained by Smith as a "Prophet, Seer and Revelator",&lt;ref name="McKiernan"/&gt; as had all other members of the First Presidency and of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church.

Rigdon returned to Nauvoo on August 3, and the next day he announced at a public meeting that he had received a revelation appointing him "Guardian of the Church."&lt;ref&gt;MHBY-1, 171&lt;/ref&gt; The President of the central [[Stake (Mormonism)|stake]], [[William Marks (Mormonism)|William Marks]], supported Rigdon.

At an August 8 conference, Rigdon argued that he should be made the "Protector" of the church."&lt;ref&gt;[[B. H. Roberts]] (ed, 1902) ''[[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]]'', vol. 7, ch. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brigham Young]], [[President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles|president]] of the [[Quorum of the Twelve|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] opposed this motion and asserted a claim for the primacy of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.&lt;ref&gt;[[B. H. Roberts]] (ed, 1902) ''[[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]]'', vol. 7, ch. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; The Quorum of Twelve Apostles were scattered throughout the United States and Europe at the time of Smith's death. The members of the quorum available in Illinois, in addition to a gathered assembly, voted to deny Rigdon his claim for church leadership.&lt;ref&gt;''[[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]]'', vol. 7, ch. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Rigdon felt this action was done without proper order.

One month later, on September 8, Rigdon was excommunicated from the church by a [[Common Council of the Church]] which had been convened by [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)#Presiding Bishop|Presiding Bishop]] [[Newel K. Whitney]].&lt;ref&gt;[[s:J. M. Grant's RIGDON|J. M.

Rigdon fled Nauvoo, claiming that he felt threatened by Young's supporters.&lt;ref name="McKiernan 1979 p"/&gt;

===Latter Day Saint leader in Pennsylvania and New York, 1845–76===

After the succession schism, Rigdon solidified and led an independent faction of Latter Day Saints, originally called the "Church of Christ", but at one point was called as the [[Church of Jesus Christ of the Children of Zion]].&lt;ref name="shilds"&gt;{{Citation |last= Shields |first= Steven |title= Divergent Paths of the Restoration |place= Independence, Missouri |publisher= Restoration Research |year= 1990 |edition= Fourth |isbn= 0-942284-00-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cadman&gt;{{Citation |last= Cadman |first= William H. |authorlink= |title= A History of the Church of Jesus Christ |year= 1945 |publisher= The Church of Jesus Christ |location= Monongahela, PA}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[List of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement#Followers of Sidney Rigdon or William Bickerton ("Bickertonites")|sect]] is often referred to as the [[Rigdonite]]s. The Latter Day Saints who followed Rigdon separated themselves and settled in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]]. On April 6, 1845, Rigdon presided over a conference of the Church of Christ, which he claimed was the rightful continuation of the church founded by Smith.&lt;ref&gt;E. Pitzer (1997).

Launius]] and Linda Thatcher (eds) (1998). ''Dissenters in Mormon History'' (Urbana: University of Illinois Press) pp. 76–101.&lt;/ref&gt; He then reorganized the First Presidency and called his own Quorum of Twelve Apostles.

Although Rigdon's church briefly flourished through the publication of his periodical, ''[[Messenger and Advocate#Rigdonite Messenger and Advocate|The Messenger and Advocate]],'' quarrels among the Rigdonites led most members of the church to desert the senior leader by 1847. A few loyalists, notably [[William Bickerton]], eventually reorganized the church in 1862 under the name [[The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite)|The Church of Jesus Christ]].

Rigdon lived on for many years in Pennsylvania and New York. He maintained his testimony of the [[Book of Mormon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/historyofutahcom04whitrich/historyofutahcom04whitrich_djvu.txt|title=History of Utah, p. 167|last=Whitney|first=Orson F.|date=1904|website=Archive.org|publisher=George Q Cannon and Sons|access-date=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and clung to his claims that he was the rightful heir to Joseph Smith. He died in [[Friendship, New York]].

==Significance in the Latter Day Saint movement==
{{main article|List of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement}}
Following the death of Joseph Smith in 1844, a succession crisis led to schisms within the movement. The Brigham Young branch traveled west to Utah, while Rigdon traveled eastward to Pittsburgh.

[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], with more than 16 million members, is the largest existing Mormon denomination. Its members consider Young to be the successor to Joseph Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Lloyd |first= R. Scott |date= October 26, 2013 |title= Church membership reaches 15 million |url= http://www.ldschurchnewsarchive.com/articles/64095/15-million-members-Spreading-across-the-earth.html |newspaper= [[Church News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rigdon's branch faced less success, modernly accounting for only a small fraction of practicing Latter Day Saints.&lt;ref name = Cadman/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;12,136 as of 2007;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jesus Christ 2007"&gt;"The Church of Jesus Christ: General Business and Organization Conference Minutes."

==Rigdon as purported author of the Book of Mormon==
{{main article|Spalding–Rigdon theory of Book of Mormon authorship}}
Rigdon has been named as a potential author for the Book of Mormon. According to this theory, Rigdon obtained from a Pittsburgh publisher a manuscript for a historical novel written by [[Solomon Spalding]], and by reworking it and adding a theological component, had created the [[Book of Mormon]].

The theory that Sidney Rigdon was the true author of the [[Book of Mormon]] first appeared in print in an August 31, 1831, article by [[James Gordon Bennett, Sr.|James Gordon Bennett]], who had visited [[Palmyra (town), New York|Palmyra]]/[[Manchester (town), New York|Manchester]] area and interviewed several residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Bennett |first= James Gordon, Sr. |author-link= James Gordon Bennett, Sr. |title= Mormonism—Religious Fanaticism—Church and State Party |newspaper= [[New York Courier and Enquirer]]  |date= 31 Aug 1831 |volume= 7 |issue= 562 }} in {{Citation |last= Arrington |first= Leonard J. |author-link= Leonard J. Arrington |title= James Gordon Bennett's 1831 Report on 'The Mormonites' |journal= [[BYU Studies]] |volume= 10 |issue= 3 |year= 1970 |url= http://byustudies.byu.edu/showTitle.aspx?title=4908 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131021171149/https://byustudies.byu.edu/showTitle.aspx?title=4908 |archivedate= 2013-10-21 |df  =}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of Rigdon's use of a Spalding manuscript first appeared in print in the 1834 book ''[[Mormonism Unvailed]]''. The theory also later appeared in 1867 in ''Origin, Rise, and Progress of Mormonism'' by [[Pomeroy Tucker]] in which he says Smith was visited by a "mysterious stranger" as early as 1827, who Tucker implies played a role in the creation of the Book of Mormon and later identifies the stranger as Rigdon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Tucker |first1= Pomeroy |title= Origin, Rise, and Progress of Mormonism: Biography of Its Founders and History of Its Church: Personal Remembrances and Historical Collections Hitherto Unwritten |date= 1867 |publisher= D. Appleton &amp; Company |location= [[New York (state)|New York]] |pages= 28, 76 |oclc= 2314258 |url= https://archive.org/details/originriseprogre00tuck }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This theory contradicts the testimony of Rigdon to his son John, just prior to his death and long after he had ceased an affiliation with any of the sects of Mormonism: "My father, after I had finished saying what I have repeated above, looked at me a moment, raised his hand above his head and slowly said, with tears glistening in his eyes: 'My son, I can swear before high heaven that what I have told you about the origin of [the Book of Mormon] is true. Your mother and sister, Mrs. Athalia Robinson, were present when that book was handed to me in Mentor, Ohio, and all I ever knew about the origin of [the Book of Mormon] was what Parley P. Pratt, Oliver Cowdery, Joseph Smith and the witnesses who claimed they saw the plates have told me, and in all of my intimacy with Joseph Smith he never told me but one story.'" However, Rigdon's grandson, Walter Sidney Rigdon, stated in an interview that the family knew that the "Golden Bible" was a hoax, contrived by Rigdon and Joseph Smith Junior, to make money and that it was based on the Spalding manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/dbroadhu/UT/tribune2.htm#041588 |title=The "Golden Bible" |last=Beadle |first=J. H. |date=April 7, 1888 |website= |publisher=The Salt Lake Daily Tribune |access-date=February 8, 2018 |quote=Sidney Rigdon's Grandson Says Their Family Understood it to be a Fraud.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 computer analysis of the Book of Mormon text supports this theory, although the study does not include Joseph Smith in the author sample on the ground that few pure examples of Smith's writings are extant.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{citation |last1= Jockers |first1= Matthew L. |last2= Witten |first2= Daniela M. |last3= Criddle |first3= Craig S. |url= http://llc.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/fqn040 |title= Reassessing authorship of the ''Book of Mormon'' using delta and nearest shrunken centroid classification |journal= [[Literary and Linguistic Computing]] |volume= 23 |issue= 4 |pages= 465–491 |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |date=December 2008 |doi=10.1093/llc/fqn040}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other significant problems are apparent in the methodology of this computer analysis, specifically the use of closed set methodology instead of open set methodology. For example, the original methodology, when replicated, also assigns Rigdon as the probable author of ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'', which were written five years before his birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1= Schaalje |first1= G. Bruce |last2= Fields |first2= Paul J. |last3= Roper |first3= Matthew |last4= Snow |first4= Gregory L. |url= http://llc.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/1/71 |title= Extended nearest shrunken centroid classification: A new method for open-set authorship attribution of texts of varying sizes |journal= [[Literary and Linguistic Computing]] |volume= 26 |issue= 1 |pages= 71–88 |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |date= December 2011 |doi= 10.1093/llc/fqq029 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3033">'''Stephen Alan Oxman''' (born 1945) was [[United States]] [[Assistant Secretary of State for European and Canadian Affairs]] from 1993 to 1994.

==Biography==

Stephen A. Oxman was educated at [[Princeton University]], graduating ''[[magna cum laude]]'' with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in 1967.  He then earned a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] at [[Yale University]], before becoming a [[Rhodes Scholar]] at [[Oxford University]], where he earned a [[Ph.D.]]

In 1973, Oxman joined the [[law firm]] of [[Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore]] as an [[associate attorney]].  He left Cravath in 1977 when he became Executive Assistant to [[United States Deputy Secretary of State]] [[Warren Christopher]].  He later became a consultant to [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Cyrus Vance]] during the [[Iran hostage crisis]].

Following the end of the [[Carter administration]], in 1980, Oxman joined [[Shearman &amp; Sterling]] as a [[litigation]] [[Partner (business rank)|partner]].  In 1988, he moved to the newly founded [[investment bank]] of [[Wasserstein Perella &amp; Co.]]

In 1981, he was selected to be one of the first ''Young Leaders'' of the [[French-American Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frenchamerican.org/young-leaders|title=Young Leaders|publisher=[[French-American Foundation]]|accessdate=2015-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, [[President of the United States]] [[Bill Clinton]] nominated Oxman as [[Assistant Secretary of State for European and Canadian Affairs]], and he held this office from April 2, 1993 until August 15, 1994.

Upon leaving government service in 1994, Oxman joined [[Wolfensohn &amp; Company]], a private investment and advisory firm founded by [[James Wolfensohn]], as a Senior Partner.  [[Bankers Trust]] acquired Wolfensohn &amp; Co. in 1996, and Oxman became Senior Managing Director of BT Wolfensohn.  He left Wolfensohn &amp; Co. for [[Morgan Stanley]] in 1999.

Oxman currently serves as a trustee of Princeton University.

[[File:Tower Climber Worker.jpg|thumb|A tower climber.]]

A '''tower climber''' is a technician who performs maintenance and repair on [[radio masts and towers]].

==Job Description==
Tower climbers perform routine inspections and tests on broadcasting towers, and may also be called upon to perform repairs and to provide input when plans for new equipment are being developed.

Along with the installers of the tower antennas, other crews climb the towers to perform condition checks of the towers, guy lines and lighting systems. One of the most demanding aspects of many tower climber jobs is hauling materials and tools up to the proper installation height on the tower. In most cases, the climber scales the tower to the desired height and lowers a rope to a ground crew member who then ties it to a needed part on the ground. The tower worker then pulls the piece up and secures the rope before installing the part onto the tower.

==Safety==

Tower climbers may be injured or killed by falling objects, structural collapses and equipment failures. Some of the more frequently encountered hazards include falls from great heights; electrical hazards; hazards associated with hoisting personnel and equipment with base-mounted drum hoists; inclement weather; and structural collapse of towers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vilorio|first=Dennis|title=You’re a what ?

A '''traffic guard''', '''traffic controller''', '''flagman''', or '''flagger''' is a person who directs traffic through a [[construction site]] or other temporary traffic control zone past an area using [[gesture]]s, signs or flags. The person directing traffic is responsible for maintaining the safety and efficiency of traffic, as well as the safety of road workers, while allowing construction, accident recovery or other tasks to proceed. Traffic guards are commonly used to control traffic when two way roads are reduced to one lane, and traffic must alternate. Their duties are to direct traffic to safer areas where [[construction]] or traffic incidents are taking place. In addition they have to moderate the traffic density to not cause [[traffic jam]]s. They guide motorists to follow the [[traffic law]]s; but may not be able to enforce the law. Most traffic guards are seen as [[construction worker]]s; but in some nations, they dress or perform as [[security guard]]s and [[police officer]]s.

==Duties and careers==
;Highway and expressway safety

Traffic guards are employed on highways and expressways. They are trained to set up warning signs and barricades to slow down the speed of traffic in a temporary traffic control zone. Some areas have full-time traffic guard teams for responding to incidents that could risk the safety to motorists. When they are on scene they will set up equipment to warn approaching traffic about the incident.

;Intersections

If  construction or maintenance is occurring in an intersection and a law enforcement officer is not used to direct traffic, a traffic guard would control the intersection instead of the [[traffic light]] or signs.

;Road construction
[[Image:Flagger on M-124.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Flagger on [[M-124 (Michigan highway)|M-124]], [[Hayes State Park]], Michigan]]
Traffic guards who are directing traffic during road construction often alternate opposing traffic through a single lane. One direction of traffic is stopped at a time.

'''Crossings'''
[[File:Chicago 2007-4.jpg|thumb|Traffic guard on [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]] in Chicago]]
Traffic guards who are stationed at a crossing with no signal or placed for extra safety at a junction. They stop pedestrians and vehicles from crossing a junction where another thing has the right of way to cross.

;Parking and gate guard

These traffic guards are waiting for motorists to leave and enter a complex. They also help pedestrians cross or stop them in front of the complex's entrance. They act as second pair of eyes to keep motorists and pedestrians safe. They may direct street traffic to stop for exiting motorists from the complex and they may not allow in doing that.

==Equipment==

*Signal flags; a small or large flag in colors such as white, red, and orange.
*Signal hand sign; called stop/slow paddles in the United States, these are a sign that has 'stop' on one side and 'slow' or 'go' on the other side.
*Signal baton (or marshalling wand); a baton that lights up or reflects light.
*Traffic vest; a brightly colored vest that is made to reflect headlights light or has built in LED lights.
*Helmet (or a hard hat); protecting the head from hazards.
*Signal flares; flares for night or bad weather.
*[[Traffic cones]] and warning signs, which are [[road traffic control devices]] used to slow down traffic and guide drivers.
