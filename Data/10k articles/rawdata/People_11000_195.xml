During the '''Parade of Nations''' portion of the [[1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Summer Olympics opening ceremony]], athletes from each country participating in the Olympics paraded in the arena, preceded by their flag. The flag was borne by a sportsperson from that country chosen either by the [[National Olympic Committee]] or by the athletes themselves to represent their country.

==Parade order==
As the nation of the [[1896 Summer Olympics|first]] modern [[Olympic Games]], [[Greece]] entered the stadium first; whereas, the host nation [[South Korea at the 1988 Summer Olympics|South Korea]] marched last. Other countries entered in alphabetical order in the language of the host country ([[Korean language|Korean]]), according with tradition and [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] guidelines. The [[collation]] method used is based on the names as written in [[Hangul]], a traditional Korean alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Staff | date = November 2005 | title=Technical Manual on Ceremonies|url=http://www.gamesmonitor.org.uk/files/Technical_Manual_on_Ceremonies.pdf| format = PDF;| publisher= [[International Olympic Committee]] |accessdate=11 June 2012 | page = 39_107 | quote = The delegations parade in alphabetical order according to the language of the host country, except for Greece, which leads the parade, and for the host country, which enters the stadium last.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst most countries entered under their [[List of sovereign states|short names]], a few entered under more formal or alternative names, mostly due to political and naming disputes. The [[Republic of China]] (commonly known as Taiwan) entered with the compromised [[Chinese Taipei|name]] and [[Chinese Taipei Olympic flag|flag]] of "Chinese '''T'''aipei" under T so that they did not enter together with [[Two Chinas|conflicting]] [[People's Republic of China]] (commonly known as China), which entered as the "People's Republic of '''C'''hina" under C. The [[Republic of the Congo]] entered as the "People's Republic of the '''C'''ongo" while the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] entered under its former name, [[Zaire]].

==List==
The following is a list of each country's announced flag bearer. The list is sorted by the order in which each nation appears in the parade of nations. This table is sortable by country name (in Korean and its Roman transliteration), the flag bearer's name, and the flag bearer's sport. The names are given in their official designations by the IOC.

'''Agathon Rwasa''' is a [[Burundi]]an politician and the leader of the [[National Liberation Forces]] (''Forces pour la Libération Nationale'', FNL). He was a [[Hutu]] militia leader during the [[Burundi Civil War]].

Rwasa was reported to be a [[Born-again Christian]].&lt;ref name=ANC&gt;[http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/anctoday/2004/at33.htm Young lions of the African Century] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070620174141/http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/anctoday/2004/at33.htm |date=2007-06-20 }}, ''[[African National Congress|ANC]]'', 2004-08-20, accessed on 2007-07-07&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Born to Hutu parents on January 10, 1964 in Ngozi (North), Rwasa is the seventh child in the family of 14 children. He attended primary and secondary education in his native province. At the age of 20, he was appointed head of the association of young intellectuals. After graduating from the [[University of Burundi]], he was wanted by the government like most other Hutu intellectuals in the region. He was responsible for the gatumba massacre that resulted in 166 members of a tutsi minority killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jeuneafrique.com/252724/politique/agathon-rwasa-5-choses-a-savoir-sur-cet-opposant-au-long-passe-de-chef-de-guerre/|language=French|publisher=Jeune Afrique|title=Agathon Rwasa : 5 choses à savoir sur cet opposant burundais au long passé de chef de guerre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
From a member of the political bureau, he quickly rose to become the leader of the National Liberation Forces (FNL). After 20 years in the bush, he returned home in 2008.

The FNL has also been accused of using hundreds of [[child soldiers]], and for killing and maiming women, children and babies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/children/conflict/english/burundi28.html Developments in Burundi] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716211350/http://www.un.org/children/conflict/english/burundi28.html |date=July 16, 2007 }}, ''Office of the UN Special Representative for Children in Armed Conflict'', 2006-11-06&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=U.N.

In September 2006 the FNL signed a peace deal with the government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sabcnews.com/africa/east_africa/0,2172,134464,00.html Burundi govt, FNL sign ceasefire agreement] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929121703/http://www.sabcnews.com/africa/east_africa/0,2172,134464,00.html |date=2007-09-29 }}, ''[[SABC]]'', 2006-09-07, accessed on 2007-07-07&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2010, Rwasa went into hiding, claiming he was facing arrest for allegedly destabilising the country following district elections. However, Burundi's attorney general stated that there is no warrant out for Rwasa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2010/06/2010630131733366396.html Burundi opposition leader in hiding ].  English Al Jazeera. 30 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, he was elected as the deputy speaker of the [[Parliament of Burundi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-33722209|title=Burundi's opposition leader Rwasa becomes deputy speaker|publisher=BBC News|date=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alice Lillian Rosehill  Kahokuoluna''' (February 20, 1888 – March 14, 1957) was a Congregational minister of Native Hawaiian ancestry. In her time and place, she was the first woman ordained by the Hawaiian Evangelical Association, and the only woman Christian minister in the [[Territory of Hawaii]]. Her pastorate was primarily on the Islands of Maui and Molokai, where she helped restore the Siloama Church. Her childhood and young adult church life had been at Kawaiahaʻo Church in Honolulu, and the board of directors of that church later offered her the position of Kahu (pastor).

==Background==

She was born in Honolulu, the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]], to Native Hawaiian mother Kuhilani Awai Kanaina (1861–1930), and  Swedish sea captain father Andrew A. Rosehill (1851–1913) . Her siblings were sisters Minnie and Inez, and brothers Edward, Joseph, Francis and William. A stepbrother Frederick was from her mother's first marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Plan Rosehill Rites Sunday|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/274848481/?terms=Kuhilani+Rosehill|accessdate=March 12, 2018|work=Honolulu Star-Bulletin{{Subscription required|via=Newspapers.com}}|date=September 20, 1930|page=3, col 3}}; {{cite news|title=Picturesque Career Ends In Last Port|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/258588117/?terms=Andrew+Rosehill|accessdate=March 12, 2018|work=The Honolulu Advertiser{{Subscription required|via=Newspapers.com}}|date=November 26, 1913|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educated at Kaahumanu Elementary and [[Mid-Pacific Institute|Kawaiaha{{okina}}o Seminary for Girls]], she was employed as a book binder at the Advertiser Publishing Company in Honolulu when she met Maui sheriff [[Peter Noa Kahokuoluna]]. They were married in 1912 in the home of Kahu (pastor) [[Henry Hodges Parker]] of  [[Kawaiahaʻo Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Personal and social|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/80605533/?terms=Kahokuoluna|accessdate=March 12, 2018|work=The Hawaiian Star{{Subscription required|via=Newspapers.com}}|date=April 20, 1912|page=4, col. 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Call to the ministry==

The Kahokuolunas were devout Christians, who kept their ties to Kawaiahaʻo Church in Honolulu. Encouraged in her faith by Kahu [[Akaiko Akana]], Alice attended [[Auburn Theological Seminary]] and [[Andover Newton Theological School]]. She was called in 1923 to shepherd [[Wananalua Congregational Church]] in [[Hana, Hawaii|Hana, Maui]]. Although she was a licensed minister, she had never been ordained. At the request of the congregants, the [[Hawaiian Evangelical Association]] officially ordained her into the ministry in 1925, the first woman the organization had ever admitted into the clergy. She became pastor of [[Waiola Church|Waine{{okina}}e Church Church]] that same year. Her husband Peter died in 1926 after a lengthy illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Doyle|first=Emma Lyons|title=Vital statistics|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/259144398/?terms=Kahokuoluna|accessdate=March 12, 2018|work=The Honolulu Advertiser{{Subscription required|via=Newspapers.com}}|date=November 26, 1926|page=11 col. 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MotherAlice&gt;{{cite news|last= Doyle|first=Emma Lyons|title=Mother Alice of Kalaupapa|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/267567277/?terms=Alice+Rosehill+Kahokuoluna|accessdate=March 12, 2018|work=The Honolulu Advertiser{{Subscription required|via=Newspapers.com}}|date=September 1, 1957|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Kahu Akana died in 1933, the board of trustees of Kawaiahaʻo Church offered the position to Alice, noting that she was the only ordained woman Christian minister in Hawaii, but she did not accept the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Woman Asked To Pastorate Of Kawaiahao: Alice Kahokuoluna|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/275025563/?terms=Alice+Kahokuoluna|accessdate=March 12, 2018|work=Honolulu Star-Bulletin{{Subscription required|via=Newspapers.com}}|date=July 1, 1933|page=1}}; {{cite news|title=Maui Pastor May Not Take Honolulu Job|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/275026119/?terms=Alice+Kahokuoluna|accessdate=March 12, 2018|work=Honolulu Star-Bulletin{{Subscription required|via=Newspapers.com}}|date=July 6, 1933|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 1, 1933, Kawaiahao held a year-end "Praise Service", with Alice delivering a Hawaiian language sermon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Praise Service At Kawaiahao: Alice Kahokuoluna|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/274983863/?terms=Kahokuoluna|accessdate=March 12, 2018|work=Honolulu Star-Bulletin{{Subscription required|via=Newspapers.com}}|date=December 30, 1933|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Siloama Church]] body of Christians had been formed at [[Kalawao, Hawaii|Kalawao, Molokai]] in 1866, by exiled people afflicted with [[leprosy]]. The Hawaiian Board of Missions erected the actual building in 1871. Over the years, the building fell into disrepair, and Congregationalists erected Kanaana Hou, the Church of New Canaan, at a different Molokai location in 1915. In 1938, Alice accepted a call to be pastor of the Siloama-Kanaana Hou churches, and spearheaded a drive to raise funds and restore the old Siloama Church. While searching through the abandoned ruins, Alice and Floyd McHenry, a naturalist affiliated with the [[Bishop Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Oahu Man's Body Found In Molokai Forest Area|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/269879916/?terms=Floyd+McHenry|accessdate=March 12, 2018|work=Honolulu Star-Bulletin{{Subscription required|via=Newspapers.com}}|date=March 9, 1959|page=17, col. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; discovered a vault beneath its foundation. Therein, they found its original 1866 record book. That discovery inspired Hawaiian historian [[Ethel Moseley Damon]] to write a book on history of the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ethel Damon Tells Story Of Kalaupapa In Book 'Siloama'|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/282647912/?terms=siloama+church|accessdate=March 12, 2018|work=Honolulu Star-Bulletin{{Subscription required|via=Newspapers.com}}|date=November 13, 1948|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan's 1941 [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]], and the United States entry into World War II, caused a shortage of needed building supplies for the restoration effort.  However, the efforts continued, and the restored Siloama was re-dedicated in 1948. Thereafter the congregants of Kanaana Hou Church worshiped at Siloama one Sunday each month.{{sfn|Law|2012|pp=36, 442}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Beloved Pastor of Kalaupapa's Kanaana Hou Church Visiting Here|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/268075711/?terms=siloama+church|accessdate=March 12, 2018|work=Honolulu Star-Bulletin{{Subscription required|via=Newspapers.com}}|date=October 16, 1950|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final years==

Her efforts at Molokai drew support from  other churches and individuals in Hawaii. The choir she had organized participated in a congregational convention in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rev. Kahokuoluna Dies|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/260026712/?terms=Kahokuoluna|accessdate=March 12, 2018|work=The Honolulu Advertiser{{Subscription required|via=Newspapers.com}}|date=March 16, 1957|page=B4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She never remarried or had any children of her own.  For all her years of being in service to leprosy patients, she never contracted the disease herself. But by the end of her life, she was known as "Mother Alice" on Molokai for her selfless caring of others. No one who needed her was turned away, no matter the hour of the day or night. She was said to be "a Hawaiian of quiet distinction, a vigorous, understanding woman of conviction and courage, but with a saving smile in her eyes ... "&lt;ref name=MotherAlice/&gt; Upon her 1957 death of cancer, a bronze plaque was created by Kanaana Hou Church to commemorate her life's service.&lt;ref name=MotherAlice/&gt;

The '''Baiyue''', '''Hundred Yue''' or '''Yue''' were various indigenous non-Chinese peoples who inhabited the region stretching along the coastal area from [[Shandong]] to southeast China, and as far west as the [[Sichuan Basin]] between the first millennium BC and the first millennium AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Tai-Kadai Languages |editor1-surname=Diller |editor1-given=Anthony |editor2-surname=Edmondson |editor2-given=Jerry |editor3-surname=Luo |editor3-given=Yongxian |chapter=Sino-Tai and Tai-Kadai: another look |surname=Luo |given=Yongxian | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=0lmQAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA9 |publisher=Routledge |year=2008 |isbn= 978-0700714575 |pages=9–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meacham (1996:93) notes that, during the [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] and [[Han dynasty|Han]] dynasties, the Yue lived in a vast territory from [[Jiangsu]] to [[Yunnan]],&lt;ref name="Meacham"&gt;{{cite journal| title = Defining the Hundred Yue| first = William | last = Meacham| journal = Bulletin of the Indo-Pacific Prehistory Association | volume = 15 | year = 1996 | pages = 93| url = http://journals.lib.washington.edu/index.php/BIPPA/article/view/11537/10170 |doi=10.7152/bippa.v15i0.11537}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Barlow (1997:2) indicates that the [[Lạc Việt|Luoyue]] occupied the southwest [[Guangxi]] and northern [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=East Asian cultural and historical perspectives: histories and society—culture and literatures|publisher=Research Institute for Comparative Literature and Cross-Cultural Studies, University of Alberta|editor1-first=Steven |editor1-last=Tötösy de Zepetnek |editor2-first=Jennifer W.|editor2-last=Jay|isbn=978-0-921490-09-8|year=1997|chapter=Culture, ethnic identity, and early weapons systems: the Sino-Vietnamese frontier| chapter-url = https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=ZNqDLMYsaysC&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;ots=EuEmMrn_p5&amp;dq=Culture%2C%20ethnic%20identity%2C%20and%20early%20weapons%20systems%3A%20the%20Sino-Vietnamese%20frontier&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |first=Jeffrey G.|last=Barlow |pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Book of Han|''Han shu'' (漢書)]] describes the lands of Yue as stretching from the regions of [[Kuaiji Commandery|''Kuaiji'' (會稽)]] to [[Jiaozhi|''Jiaozhi'' (交趾)]].{{sfn|Brindley|2003|p= 13}} In the [[Warring States period]], the word "Yue" referred to the [[Yue (state)|State of Yue]] in [[Zhejiang]]. The later kingdoms of [[Minyue]] in [[Fujian]] and [[Nanyue]] in [[Guangdong]] were both considered Yue states.

The Yue tribes were gradually displaced or [[Sinicization|assimilated into Chinese culture]] as the Han empire [[Southward expansion of the Han dynasty|expanded]] into what is now Southern China and Northern Vietnam during the first half of the first millennium AD. Many modern southern [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese dialects]] bear traces of [[stratum (linguistics)|substrate]] languages originally spoken by the ancient Yue. Variations of the name are still used for the name of modern Vietnam, in Zhejiang-related names including [[Shaoxing opera|Yue Opera]], the [[Yue Chinese]] language, and in the abbreviation for [[Guangdong]].

== Names ==
The modern term "Yue" ({{CJKV|t={{linktext|越}} or {{linktext|粵}}|s={{linktext|越}} or {{linktext|粵}}|p=Yuè|w=Yüeh&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;|cy=Yuht|v={{linktext|Việt}}}}; [[Standard Zhuang|Zhuang]]: ''Vot''; [[Early Middle Chinese]]: ''Wuat'') comes from [[Old Chinese]] ''*ɢʷat'' ([[William H. Baxter]] and [[Laurent Sagart]] 2014).&lt;ref&gt;Old Chinese pronunciation from Baxter, William H. and Laurent Sagart. 2014. ''Old Chinese: A New Reconstruction''. Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-994537-5}}. These characters are both given as ''gjwat'' in ''[[Grammata Serica Recensa]]'' 303e and 305a.&lt;/ref&gt; It was first written using the pictograph "戉" for an axe (a homophone), in [[oracle bone]] and bronze inscriptions of the late [[Shang dynasty]] ({{circa|lk=no|1200}} BC), and later as "越".&lt;ref name="Norman&amp;Mei"&gt;{{cite journal |title = The Austroasiatics in Ancient South China: Some Lexical Evidence |first1 = Jerry |last1 = Norman |authorlink1 = Jerry Norman (sinologist) |first2 = Tsu-lin |last2 = Mei |journal = Monumenta Serica |year = 1976 |volume = 32 |pages = 274–301 |url = http://tlmei.com/tm17web/1976a_austroasiatics.pdf |jstor = 40726203}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time it referred to a people or chieftain to the northwest of the Shang.&lt;ref name="Meacham"/&gt; In the early 8th century BC, a tribe on the middle [[Yangtze]] were called the ''[[Yangyue|Yángyuè]]'', a term later used for peoples further south.&lt;ref name="Meacham"/&gt; Between the 7th and 4th centuries BC "Yue" referred to the [[State of Yue]] in the lower Yangtze basin and its people.&lt;ref name="Meacham"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Norman&amp;Mei"/&gt;

The term "Hundred Yue" first appears in the book ''[[Lüshi Chunqiu]]'' compiled around 239 BC.&lt;ref&gt;''The Annals of Lü Buwei'', translated by John Knoblock and Jeffrey Riegel, Stanford University Press (2000), p. 510. {{ISBN|978-0-8047-3354-0}}. "For the most part, there are no rulers to the south of the Yang and Han Rivers, in the confederation of the Hundred Yue tribes."&lt;/ref&gt;  It was used as a collective term for many non-Chinese populations of south and southwest China and northern Vietnam.&lt;ref name="Meacham"/&gt;

Ancient texts mention a number of Yue states or groups. Most of these names survived into early imperial times:

[[File:Sword of Goujian, Hubei Provincial Museum, 2015-04-06 09.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Sword of Goujian]], labelled as belonging to a king of Yue]]
In the 5th millennium BC, the lower [[Yangtze]] area was already a major population centre, occupied by the [[Hemudu culture|Hemudu]] ([[Austronesian]]) and [[Majiabang culture]]s, who were among the earliest cultivators of [[rice]] paddy fields in the fecund delta areas.{{sfnp|Marks|2017|p=36}}

By the 3rd millennium BC, the successor [[Liangzhu culture]] shows some influence from the [[Longshan culture|Longshan-era cultures]] due to trade and commerce.&lt;ref name="Goodenough&amp;Chang"&gt;{{cite book
| title = Prehistoric settlement of the Pacific | editor-first = Ward H. | editor-last = Goodenough | publisher = American Philosophical Society | year = 1996 | isbn = 978-0-87169-865-0 | chapter = Archaeology of southeastern coastal China and its bearing on the Austronesian homeland | first1 = Kwang-chih | last1 = Chang | first2 = Ward H. | last2 = Goodenough | pages = 36–54 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, [[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup|Y-chromosome DNA]] from Liangzhu culture sites shows a high frequency of [[haplogroup O-M119]], which is also common among modern [[Taiwanese aborigines]] and speakers of [[Kra–Dai languages]] (formerly called Tai–Kadai) in southwest China.
[[Wucheng culture]] sites had a quite different profile, featuring haplogroups [[haplogroup O-M95|O-M95]] and [[haplogroup O-M122|O-M122]], which are found in several modern populations in east and southeast Asia, especially in [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic speakers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Li |first=Hui |last2=Huang |first2=Ying |last3=F Mustavich |first3=Laura |last4=Zhang |first4=Fan |last5=Tan |first5=Jing-Ze |last6=Wang |first6=Ling-E |last7=Qian |first7=Ji |last8=Gao |first8=Meng-He |last9=Jin |first9=Li |title=Y chromosomes of prehistoric people along the Yangtze River |journal=Human Genetics |date=November 2007 |volume=122 |issue=3–4 |pages=383–388 |pmid=17657509 |doi=10.1007/s00439-007-0407-2 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6180520_Y_chromosomes_of_Prehistoric_People_along_the_Yangtze_River }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 9th century BC, two northern Yue tribes, the Gou-Wu and Yu-Yue, were increasingly influenced by their Chinese neighbours to their north. These two states were based in the areas of what is now southern [[Jiangsu]] and northern [[Zhejiang]], respectively. Traditional accounts attribute the cultural change to [[Taibo]], a [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] prince who had self-exiled to the south. However, this piece of information originates from [[Shiji]] by [[Sima Qian]], who tended to assign Chinese ancestors to most non-Chinese groups.{{sfn|von Stella|2016|p = 36}} This practice, according to von Stella Xu, was used to justify the incorporation of non-Chinese people into his historical records.{{sfn|von Stella|2016|p = 36}} [[Sima Qian]] also assigned Chinese ancestor to King [[Goujian]] of Yue, claiming that he was descended from the legendary [[Yu the Great]]. It is common to craft ancestor myths for non-Chinese people that justify Chinese expansions when needed and also explain the difference between Chinese-ness and non-Chinese-ness.{{sfn|von Stella|2016|p = 36}}

The marshy lands of the south gave Gou-Wu and Yu-Yue unique characteristics. According to Robert Marks (2017:142), the Yue lived in what is now Fujian province gained their livelihood mostly from fishing, hunting, and practiced some kind of swidden rice farming.{{sfnp|Marks|2017|p=142}} Prior to Han Chinese migration from the north, the Yue tribes cultivated wet rice, practiced fishing and slash and burn agriculture, domesticated water buffalo, built stilt houses, tattooed their faces and dominated the coastal regions from shores all the way to the fertile valleys in the interior mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Rice: Origin, Antiquity and History |last= Sharma |first=S.

In the [[Spring and Autumn period]], the two states, now called [[Wu (state)|Wu]] and [[Yue (state)|Yue]], were becoming increasingly involved in Chinese politics.

In 512 BC, Wu launched a large expedition against the large state of [[Chu (state)|Chu]], based in the Middle Yangtze River. A similar campaign in 506 succeeded in sacking the Chu capital [[Ying (Chu)|Ying]]. Also in that year, war broke out between Wu and Yue and continued with breaks for the next three decades.

After the unification of China by [[Qin Shi Huang]], the former Wu and Yue states were absorbed into the nascent [[Qin dynasty|Qin empire]]. The Qin armies also advanced south along the [[Xiang River]] to modern Guangdong and set up commanderies along the main communication routes.

After rebellions by Luo (Lac) peoples in 39–43 C.E., direct rule and greater efforts at sinification were imposed by the Han, the territories of the Luo (Lac) states were annexed and ruled directly, along with other former Yue territories to the north, as provinces of the Han empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= Culture and Customs of Vietnam |last=McLeod |first= Mark |last2= Nguyen |first2= Thi Dieu |publisher= Greenwood  |year=2001 |isbn= 978-0-31336113-5 |publication-date=June 30, 2001 |page=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Division among the Yue leaders were exploited by the Han dynasty with the Han military winning battles against the southern kingdoms and commandaries that were of geographic and strategic value to them.

There is some disagreement about the languages they spoke, with candidates drawn from the non-Sinitic language families still represented in areas of southern China, [[Kra–Dai languages|Kra–Dai]], [[Hmong–Mien languages|Hmong–Mien]] and [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]]. The hypothesis proposed by Jerry Norman and Tsu-Lin Mei arguing for an Austroasiatic homeland along the middle Yangtze has been largely abandoned in most circles, and left unsupported by the majority of Austroasiatic specialists.&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain, James R.

Chinese, Kra–Dai, Hmong–Mien and the [[Vietic languages|Vietic]] branch of Austroasiatic have similar tone systems, syllable structure, grammatical features and lack of inflection, but these features are believed to have spread by means of diffusion across the [[Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area]], rather than indicating common descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

However, Ferlus (2009) showed that the inventions of pestle, oar and a pan to cook sticky rice, which is the main characteristic of the [[Đông Sơn culture]], correspond to the creation of new lexicons for these inventions in Northern Vietic (Việt–Mường) and Central Vietic ([[Cuoi language|Cuoi-Toum]]).&lt;ref name="Ferlus 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferlus|first1=Michael|title=A Layer of Dongsonian Vocabulary in Vietnamese|journal=Journal of the Southeast Asian Linguistics Society|date=2009|volume=1|pages=95-108|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/file/index/docid/991634/filename/Ferlus2009_Dongsonian_JSEALS.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new vocabularies of these inventions were proven to be derivatives from original verbs rather than borrowed lexical items. The current distribution of Northern Vietic also correspond to the area of Đông Sơn culture. Thus, Ferlus concludes that the Northern Vietic (Viet-Muong) is the direct heirs of the Dongsonian, who have resided in Southern part of Red river delta and North Central Vietnam since the 1st millennium BC &lt;ref name="Ferlus 2009" /&gt;.

* A well-known loanword into Sino-Tibetan&lt;ref&gt;Sino-Tibetan Etymological Dictionary and Thesaurus, http://stedt.berkeley.edu/~stedt-cgi/rootcanal.pl/etymon/5560&lt;/ref&gt; is '''k-la''' for [[tiger]] ([[Hanzi]]: 虎 old Chinese (ZS): ''*qʰlaːʔ'' &gt; Mandarin pinyin: ''hǔ'', Sino-Vietnamese "hổ") from Austroasiatic '''*klaʔ''' (compare Vietic ''kʰaːlʔ''  &gt; ''*k-haːlʔ'' &gt; ''kʰaːlʔ'' &gt; Vietnamese ''khái'').
*[[Zheng Xuan]] (127–200 AD) wrote that {{linktext|扎}} (middle Chinese: "jaat", modern Mandarin Chinese ''zā'', modern Sino-Vietnamese: "trát") was the word used by the Yue people (越人) to mean "die". Norman and Mei reconstruct this word as OC *''tsət'' and relate it to Austroasiatic words with the same meaning, such as Vietnamese ''chết'' and [[Mon language|Mon]] ''chɒt''. However, Laurent Sagart points out that {{linktext|扎}} is a well‑attested Chinese word also meaning 'to die', which is overlooked by Norman and Mei.{{sfn|Sagart|2008|p= 142}} This word occurred in the Yue language in Han times could be because Yuè borrowed it from Chinese.{{sfn|Sagart|2008|p= 142}} Therefore, the resemblance of this Chinese word to an Austroasiatic word is probably accidental.{{sfn|Sagart|2008|p= 142}}
*According to the ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'' (100 AD), "In Nanyue, the word for dog is ({{zh|c=撓獀|p=náosōu}}; EMC: ''nuw-ʂuw'')", possibly related to other Austroasiatic terms. ''Sōu'' is "hunt" in modern Chinese. However, in ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'', the word for dog is recorded as 獶獀 with its most probable pronunciation around 100 CE must have been ou-sou or ou-ʂou, which resembles [[proto-Austronesian language|proto-Austronesian]] '''*asu''', '''*u‑asu''' 'dog' than it resembles the palatal‑initialled Austroasiatic monosyllable Vietnamese ''chó'', Old Mon ''clüw'', etc.{{sfn|Sagart|2008|p= 143}}
*The early Chinese name for the Yangtze ({{zh|c={{linktext|江}}|p=jiāng}}; EMC: ''kœ:ŋ''; OC: *''kroŋ''; Cantonese: "kong") was later extended to a general word for "river" in south China. Norman and Mei suggest that the word is cognate with Vietnamese ''sông'' (from *''krong'') and Mon ''kruŋ'' "river".
They also provide evidence of an Austroasiatic [[Stratum (linguistics)|substrate]] in the vocabulary of [[Min Chinese]].&lt;ref name="Norman&amp;Mei"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Norman|1988|pp=18–19, 231}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Norman and Mei's hypothesis is widely quoted, but has recently been criticized by [[Laurent Sagart]] who suggest that on the most eastern coast [[Austronesian languages]] were spoken and in inland areas [[Austroasiatic languages]].{{sfn|Sagart|2008|pp= 141-143}}

Scholars in China often assume that the Yue spoke an early form of Kra–Dai.
The linguist Wei Qingwen gave a rendering of the "Song of the Yue boatman" in [[Standard Zhuang]]. [[Zhengzhang Shangfang]] proposed an interpretation of the song in written [[Thai language|Thai]] (dating from the late 13th century) as the closest available approximation to the original language, but his interpretation remains controversial.&lt;ref name="Zhengzhang"/&gt;{{sfn|Sagart|2008|p= 143}}

Large incoming waves of Han Chinese immigrants from Northern and Central China poured into the south over the centuries through various succeeding Chinese dynasties has resulted in large-scale intermixing between the Han Chinese and Yue with much of the indigenous Yue tribes assimilating into Chinese civilization or ended up being driven out into the hills and mountains.&lt;ref&gt;Wee, J.

By the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907), the term "Yue" had largely become a regional designation rather than a cultural one, as in the [[Wuyue]] state during the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]] in what is now Zhejiang province.

In ancient China, the characters {{linktext|越}} and {{linktext|粵}} (both ''yuè'' in pinyin) were used interchangeably, but they are differentiated in modern Chinese:

* The character "越" refers to the original territory of the state of Yue, which was based in what is now northern [[Zhejiang]], especially the areas around [[Shaoxing]] and [[Ningbo]]. The [[Shaoxing opera]] of Zhejiang, for example, is called "Yue Opera". It is also used to write [[Vietnam]], a word adapted from ''Nányuè'' ({{lang-vi|Nam Việt}}), (literal English translation as ''Southern Yue'').
* The character "粵" is associated with the southern province of [[Guangdong]]. Both the regional dialects of [[Yue Chinese]] and the standard form, popularly called "[[Cantonese]]", are spoken in Guangdong, [[Guangxi]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]] and in many Cantonese communities around the world.

'''D'Ken Neramani''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is best known for being the evil brother of [[Lilandra Neramani|Lilandra]] and Cal'syee (the villain [[Deathbird]]), two important characters in the X-Men franchise.

==Publication history==
D'Ken first appeared in ''[[X-Men]]'' v1 #97 (February 1976), and was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Dave Cockrum]].

==Fictional character biography==
D'Ken inherited the throne of the interstellar [[Shi'ar|Shi'ar Empire]] after his older sister, Deathbird, was exiled for murdering their mother and an unnamed younger sister. The Shi'ar's first known contact with Terrans is during D'Ken's reign. On Earth for an unknown reason, a Shi'ar scout ship encounters the private plane of Chris Summers (later known as [[Corsair (comics)|Corsair]]). Also aboard are a pregnant [[Katherine Anne Summers]] and their children, future X-Men members [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Havok (comics)|Havok]]. The Shi'ar ship attacks the plane and kidnaps Corsair and Katherine. Their two sons are forced to share an escape parachute. Unfortunately, both parties come to believe the other has died.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

Brought to the Shi'ar Empire, D'Ken initially imprisons Corsair and takes Katherine to his royal bedchambers where he attempts to rape Katherine. As Corsair makes an unsuccessful attempt to escape from his holding pen, D'Ken punishes him by making Corsair watch as D'Ken stabs and kills Katherine. D'Ken then rips their unborn child from her womb. Corsair is made a slave while D'Ken keeps the infant alive with Shi'ar technology that also accelerates his growth. The third Summers' son, [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]] is raised a slave and is sent back to Earth to be a servant to [[Erik the Red (comics)|Erik the Red]]. Vulcan is able to escape and find refuge with [[Moira MacTaggert]].{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

Meanwhile, D'Ken seeks to expand the Shi'ar Empire and gain more power through finding and using the legendary [[M'Kraan Crystal]]. Ignoring others' concerns, he eventually located the Crystal, which is placed on an abandoned planet known only as The World. D'Ken's sister [[Lilandra Neramani]] opposes him, due to knowing that the Crystal was nicknamed ''"The End of All That Is"'' for a reason. She attempts a [[coup]] but is marked a [[traitor]]. While fleeing D'Ken's forces, Lilandra accidentally becomes psychically linked with [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] following his mental defeat of a [[List of Marvel Comics alien races#Z|Z'Nox]] invasion.  Lilandra makes her way to Earth and allies herself with the [[X-Men]]. D'Ken's forces capture Lilandra and return with her, via Stargate, to The World to witness D'Ken's attempt to use the Crystal's power. The X-Men quickly pursue.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

The X-Men arrive on The World and face off against D'Ken's [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Imperial Guard]]. Luckily, they are joined and assisted by the [[Starjammers]], who had been attempting their own sabotage of D'Ken rule. The Phoenix Force, still weakened and unexperienced in using the new host body of [[Jean Grey]], flies to the crystal to try to stop D'Ken, but is sucked into it, with everyone else. Inside the crystal, they find a large endless city, at the center of which is the heart of the Crystal - a sphere which contained a Neutron Galaxy. Due to its intense [[gravity]], the Neutron Galaxy could cause all of creation to be sucked into it. Normally, an energy field in the form of a latticework, acted as a living shield but it was deteriorating due to the breach. Unfortunately, nearly all of those sucked into the Crystal are rendered immobile by a ray coming out of the orb that causes everyone to live out their greatest nightmares. Only Phoenix is unaffected.  Using the empathic link she forges with the crystal, Phoenix discovers the imminent danger. Phoenix attempts to use her vast psychic powers to repair the latticework on her own but finds that even she is not strong enough. Phoenix reaches out telepathically to her fellow X-Men for psychic and spiritual support. With their combined will, Phoenix is able to repair the Crystal and save the universe from ultimate destruction. While most of those drawn into the crystal are able to escape unscathed, D'Ken experiences it's nightmarish effects more intensely and its immense power renders him [[coma]]tose for a very long time. With D'Ken out of the picture, his younger sister Lilandra became the ruler of the Shi'ar.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

=== Rise and Fall of the Shi'ar Empire ===
[[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]] reawakens after barely surviving the failed rescue of the original X-Men from [[Krakoa]]. Driven mad by the experience and recalling the horrors of his past, Vulcan swears revenge on all those that he feels have wronged him, including D'Ken and the Shi'ar Empire. Vulcan heads back into outer space. While Vulcan is eventually captured by the Imperial Guard, he escapes when rebel Shi'ar who are against Lilandra's rule attempt to release fellow prisoner [[Deathbird]]. While on the run, the two former prisoners become romantically involved. Vulcan plans to resume his goal of vengeance, but Deathbird manages to convince him to delay his plans for a while. They travel to the planet where it is revealed that a comatose D'Ken has been protected and treated. Several [[telepathy|telepaths]] have attempted to undo the damage that the Crystal had done to D'Ken's mind. All were unsuccessful and were either killed by the experience themselves or also left mindless. The most recent attempts, however, show that D'Ken's mind is almost functioning, only that the neural pathways are not connecting properly. As a favor to Deathbird, who did not want to rule the empire but did want to overthrow her sister, Vulcan offers to use his powers to assist the healing process. Knowing of Vulcan's enmity for the former Shi'ar ruler, the others are concerned but Vulcan assures them that his vengeance means little to someone in D'Ken's current state.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' # 483 (Part 9 of 12 of the Rise and Fall Arc)&lt;/ref&gt; Vulcan succeeds in redirecting energy and jumpstarts D'Ken's mind.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

D'Ken is grudingly grateful to Vulcan for reviving him. After he observes that Deathbird and Vulcan are romantically involved, D'Ken believes that bringing Vulcan into the family will help control the volatile situation. Due to Vulcan's "birth" in the royal house, D'Ken is able to invoking an ancient Shi'ar law that allows Vulcan to marry Deathbird and become part of the Shi'ar royalty. Vulcan agrees, but, following the completion of the wedding ceremony, Vulcan kills D'Ken, saying that since he and Deathbird were now married, he could claim the Shi'ar throne as his own "By right of blood and combat! By right of succession!" &lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' # 485 (Part 11 of 12 of Rise and Fall Arc)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adam-X connection ===
It should also be noted that D'Ken was at one point believed to have some connection to the mysterious [[Adam X the X-Treme|Adam X]], a human-Shi'ar hybrid whom, according to [[Davan Shakari]], was fathered by D'Ken and [[Katherine Anne Summers|Katherine Summers]], which led fans to believe he was the so-called [[Third Summers brother]]. With the revelation that Katherine was pregnant with Vulcan at the time D'Ken abducted her and the fact that he killed her soon after ripping Vulcan out of her womb, the Adam X scenario remains conjecture.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

==Other versions==
D'Ken appeared in ''What If? X-Men - Rise And Fall of the Shi'ar Empire'' #1 in 2008.

==In other media==
[[Image:X-Men ep-33.jpg|thumb|right|D'Ken from [[X-Men: The Animated Series]]]]

D'Ken was seen in the third season of the [[X-Men: The Animated Series|X-Men (1992 Animated Series)]], in the five episode series [[Phoenix Saga (X-Men: Animated Series)|Phoenix Saga]], where his history was very similar to that of the comics. He was also responsible for the abduction of Cyclops's parents with Cyclops becoming an orphan on Earth. He also killed Cyclops's mother and imprisoned his father. D'Ken gained control over the [[M'Kraan Crystal]] in the series, however, which gave him overwhelming powers that drove him completely insane. When D'Ken was fighting Lilandra, the X-Men, and the Imperial Guard, D'Ken was eventually trapped by the Phoenix inside the M'Kraan crystal itself, in control of its vast power but unable to escape it.

D'Ken is mentioned in the game [[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

The '''demographics of Russia''' is about the [[demographic]] features of the population of the [[Russian Federation]] including population growth, population density, [[ethnic group|ethnic composition]], education level, health, economic status and other aspects.

As of 1 January 2018, the population of Russia is 144,530,031 excluding Crimea and Sevastopol, whose [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation]] is not recognized by most UN members. Including Crimea and Sevastopol, the population is 146,880,432 as of January 1, 2018.  Compared to the previous year, the population increased in Russia by 76,060, the result of a net migration gain of 211,878, and a natural population loss of 135,818.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/doc_2018/magazine/st_ob1-eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Around 77% of its population lives in [[European Russia]], while the 23% lives in its [[North Asia|Asian part]].&lt;ref name="Vishnevsky"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/popdecline/vishnevsky.pdf|title=Replacement Migration: Is it a solution for Russia?|last=Vishnevsky|first=Anatoly|date=15 August 2000|publisher=United Nations Population Division, Department of Economic and Social Affairs|pages=6, 10|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-01-14|work=EXPERT GROUP MEETING ON POLICY RESPONSES TO POPULATION AGEING AND POPULATION DECLINE /UN/POP/PRA/2000/14}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}}&lt;ref name="Vishnevsky" /&gt;{{rp|10}}

As of 2017, Russia's TFR of 1.62 children born/woman&lt;ref name="cia.gov"&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2127.html&lt;/ref&gt;  was among the highest in Eastern, Southern and Central Europe. In 2013, Russia experienced the first natural population growth since 1990 at 22,700.

According to the [[Russian Census (2010)|2010 census]], ethnic [[Russian people|Russians]] make up 81% of the total population.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20120118212344/http://www.perepis-2010.ru/results_of_the_census/result-december-2011.ppt&lt;/ref&gt; This share remained steady over the last few decades.&lt;ref name="perepis-2010.ru"&gt;{{cite web|format=PPT|url=http://www.perepis-2010.ru/results_of_the_census/result-december-2011.ppt|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118212344/http://www.perepis-2010.ru/results_of_the_census/result-december-2011.ppt|archivedate=18 January 2012|script-title=ru:Об итогах всероссийской переписи населения 2010 года|trans-title=On the results of the All-Russia Population Census 2010|language=ru|work=perepis-2010.ru|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rg.ru"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rg.ru/2011/12/16/perepis.html |title=Более восьми тысяч деревень исчезли с карты России — Татьяна Смольякова — Российская газета |website=Rg.ru |date= |accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six other ethnicities have a population exceeding 1 million – [[Tatars]] (3.9%), [[Ukrainians]] (1.4%), [[Bashkirs|Bashkir]] (1.1%), [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]] (1%), [[Chechens]] (1%) and [[Armenians]] (0.9%). In total, 160 different ethnic groups live within the Russian Federation's borders.

Russia's population density is 8.4 people per square kilometre (22 per square mile), making it one of the [[List of countries and dependencies by population density|most sparsely populated countries]] in the world. The population is most dense in the European part of the country, with milder climate, centering on Moscow and [[Saint Petersburg]]. 74% of the population is urban, making Russia a [[Urbanization by country|highly urbanized country]].

The population of Russia peaked at 148,689,000 in 1991, just before the [[breakup of the Soviet Union]]. Low birth rates and abnormally high death rates caused Russia's population to decline at a 0.5% annual rate, or about 750,000 to 800,000 people per year from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s. The UN warned in 2005 that Russia's then population of about 143 million could fall by a third by 2050, if trends did not improve.&lt;ref name=t&gt;{{cite news|first=Steven|last=Eke|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4125072.stm|title=Russia's population falling fast|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=15 March 2008|date=23 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esa.un.org/unpp/|title=World Population Statistics|website=esa.un.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070321013235/http://esa.un.org/unpp/|archivedate=21 March 2007|df=dmy-all}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, the UN predicted that Russia's population will fall to 132 million by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://esa.un.org/unpd/wup/|title=World Urbanization Prospects - Population Division - United Nations|website=esa.un.org|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://meduza.io/news/2018/05/17/oon-sprognozirovala-sokraschenie-naseleniya-rossii-k-2050-godu-do-132-millionov-chelovek|title=ООН спрогнозировала сокращение населения России к 2050 году до 132 миллионов человек|work=Meduza|access-date=2018-05-17|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decline slowed considerably in the late 2000s, and in 2009 Russia recorded population growth for the first time in 15 years, adding 23,300.&lt;ref name="gks2009"&gt;[http://www.gks.ru/bgd/free/b10_00/IssWWW.exe/Stg/d01/7-0.htm 2009 demographic figures] [[Goskomstat|Rosstat]] Retrieved on 18 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc1"/&gt; Key reasons for the slow current population growth are improving health care, changing fertility patterns among younger women, falling emigration and steady influx of immigrants from ex-USSR countries. In 2012, Russia's population increased by 292,400.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.highbeam.com/407705/article-1G1-319602206/russian-population-rises-292400-2012-rosstat |title=Russian population rises by 292,400 in 2012 – Rosstat. &amp;#124; HighBeam Business: Arrive Prepared |website=Business.highbeam.com |date=19 February 2013 |accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of Russians living in poverty has decreased by 50% since the economic crisis following the disintegration of the Soviet Union, and the improving economy had a positive impact on the country's low birth rate. The latter rose from its lowest point of 8.27 births per 1000 people in 1999 to 13.3 per 1000 in 2014. Likewise, the fertility rate rose from its lowest point of 1.157 in 1999 to 1.777 in 2015. 2007 marked the highest growth in birth rates that the country had seen in 25 years, and 2009 marked the highest total birth rate since 1991.&lt;ref name=in&gt;[http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/News/International_Business/Russian_policies_ignite_unprecedented_birth_rate_in_2007/articleshow/2750305.cms Russian policies ignite unprecedented birth rate in 2007], ''[[The Economic Times]]'', 21 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Russian birth rate is comparable to that of developed countries, its death rate is much higher, especially among working-age males due to a comparatively high rate of fatalities caused by heart disease and other external causes such as accidents. The Russian death rate in 2010 was 14.3 per 1000 citizens.

=== Demographic crisis and recovery prospects ===

The causes for this sharp increase in mortality are widely debated. According to a 2009 report by ''[[The Lancet]]'',&lt;ref name="thelancet.com"&gt;[http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)60005-2/fulltext Mass privatisation and the post-communist mortality crisis: a cross-national analysis] ''[[The Lancet]]'', Retrieved on 02-12-09&lt;/ref&gt; a British medical journal, mass [[privatization]], an element of the economic-reform package nicknamed [[Shock therapy (economics)|shock therapy]], clearly correlates with higher mortality rates. The report argues that advocates of economic reforms ignored the human cost of the policies they were promoting, such as unemployment and human suffering, leading to an early death. These conclusions were criticized by ''[[The Economist]]''.&lt;ref name=economist&gt;[http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12972677 Ex-communist reform – Mass murder and the market], ''[[The Economist]]'', Retrieved on 02-12-09&lt;/ref&gt; A [[World Health Organization|WHO]] press-release in 2000, on the other hand, reported [[Alcoholism in Russia|widespread alcohol abuse in Russia]] being used as the most common explanation of higher mortality among men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/inf-pr-2000/en/pr2000-life.html|title=WHO Life Expectancy Projections 2000 – ministry|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]|accessdate=7 January 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229035044/http://www.who.int/inf-pr-2000/en/pr2000-life.html|archivedate=29 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 study produced very similar results.&lt;ref&gt;Korotayev A., [[Khaltourina D.]] [https://www.academia.edu/32754260/Russian_Demographic_Crisis_in_Cross-National_Perspective._In_Russia_and_Globalization._Baltimore_John_Hopkins_University_Press Russian Demographic Crisis in Cross-National Perspective. ''Russia and Globalization: Identity, Security, and Society in an Era of Change'']. Ed. by D. W. Blum. Baltimore, MD: [[Johns Hopkins University Press]], 2008. p. 37-78.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 study blamed alcohol for more than half the deaths (52%) among Russians aged 15 to 54 in the '90s. For the same demographic, this compares to 4% of deaths for the rest of the world. The study claimed alcohol consumption in mid-90s in Russia averaged 10.5 litres, and was based on personal interviews conducted in three Siberian industrial cities, [[Barnaul]], [[Biysk]] and [[Omsk]].&lt;ref&gt;Burlington Free Press, 26 June 2009, page 2A, "Study blames alcohol for half Russian deaths"; see also Khaltourina, D. A., &amp; Korotayev, A. V. [http://ehp.sagepub.com/content/31/3/272.short 'Potential for alcohol policy to decrease the mortality crisis in Russia', Evaluation &amp; the Health Professions, vol. 31, no. 3, Sep 2008. pp. 272–281].&lt;/ref&gt; More recent studies have confirmed these findings.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [http://alcalc.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/05/10/alcalc.agv042?rss=1 Khaltourina, Daria, and Andrey Korotayev. "Effects of Specific Alcohol Control Policy Measures on Alcohol-Related Mortality in Russia from 1998 to 2013.]" Alcohol and Alcoholism (2015): agv042.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Russian demographic publication Demoscope,&lt;ref name=demoscope&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demoscope.ru/weekly/2009/0363/lisa01.php|title=Смертность в России сквозь призму приватизации|website=demoscope.ru|accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the rising male death rate was a long-term trend from 1960 to 2005. The only significant reversion of the trend was caused by [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s anti-alcohol campaign, but its effect was only temporary. According to the publication, the sharp rise of death rates in the early 1990s was caused by the exhaustion of the effect of the anti-alcohol campaign, while the market reforms were only of secondary importance. The authors also claimed the Lancet's study is flawed because it used the 1985 death rate as the base, while that was in fact the very maximum of the effect of the anti-alcohol campaign.&lt;ref name=demoscope/&gt;

Other factors contributing to the collapse, along with the economic problems, include the dying off of a relatively large cohort of people born between 1925 and 1940 (between the [[Russian Civil War]] and [[World War II]]), when Russian birth rates were very high, along with, ironically enough, an "echo boom" in the 1980s that may have satisfied the demand of women for children, leading to a subsequent drop in birth rates.

Government measures to halt the demographic crisis was a key subject of [[Vladimir Putin]]'s 2006 state of the nation address.&lt;ref name=mosnews&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mosnews.com/column/2006/05/11/PutinAddress.shtml |title=Vladimir Putin's State-of-the-Nation Address |website=Mosnews.com |date= |accessdate=23 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080121083506/http://www.mosnews.com/column/2006/05/11/PutinAddress.shtml |archivedate=21 January 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, a national programme was developed with the goal to reverse the trend by 2020. Soon after, a study published in 2007 showed that the rate of population decrease had begun to slow: if the net decrease from January to August 2006 was 408,200 people, it was 196,600 in the same period in 2007. The death rate accounted for 357,000 of these, which is 137,000 less than in 2006.&lt;ref name="newsru.com"&gt;Newsru, ''Население России за пять лет уменьшилось на 3,2 миллиона до 142 миллионов человек'', 19.Oct.2007 [http://www.newsru.com/russia/19oct2007/uzhe142.html Retrieved] same date&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time period in 2007, there were just over one million births in Russia (981,600 in 2006), whilst deaths decreased from 1,475,000 to 1,402,300. In all, the number of deaths exceeded the number of births by 1.3 times, down from 1.5 in 2006. 18 of the 83 provinces showed a natural growth of population (in 2006: 16). The Russian Ministry of Economic Development expressed hope that by 2020 the population would stabilize at 138–139&amp;nbsp;million, and by 2025, to increase again to its present-day status of 143–145, also raising the life expectancy to 75 years.&lt;ref name="newsru.com"/&gt;

The natural population decline continued to slow through 2008—2012 due to declining death rates and increasing birth rates. In 2009 the population saw yearly growth for the first time in 15 years.&lt;ref name="gks2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc1"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8468185.stm Russia sees first population increase in 15 years] [[BBC]] Retrieved on 18 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2009, the Ministry of Health and Social Development reported that Russia recorded natural population growth for the first time in 15 years, with 1,000 more births than deaths in August.&lt;ref name="ugj"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finance.rambler.ru/news/economics/52777555.html|title=Миздравсоцразвития: В России впервые за 15 лет зафиксирован прирост населения — Рамблер/финансы|website=finance.rambler.ru|accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011 the Russian Prime Minister (Russian president as of 2012) Vladimir Putin pledged to spend the 1.5 trillion rubles (£32.5 billion or $54 billion) on various measures to boost Russia's declining birthrate by 30 per cent in the next four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Tom Parfitt in Moscow |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/21/vladimir-putin-increasing-russian-life-expectancy |title=Vladimir Putin pledges to spend £32bn on increasing Russian life expectancy, World news |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=14 May 2011 |date=21 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the birth rate increased again. Russia recorded 1,896,263 births, the highest number since 1990, and even exceeding annual births during the period 1967–1969, with a TFR of 1.691, the highest since 1991. (Source: Vital statistics table below). In fact, Russia, despite having only slightly more people than [[Demographics of Japan|Japan]], has recently had nearly twice as many births as that country. The number of births was expected to fall over the next few years as women born during the baby bust in the 1990s enter their prime childbearing years, but this didn't occur thanks to the continued growth of the TFR. The figures for 2013-2015 again showed around 1.9 million births, about the same as in 2012, but because the number of women of childbearing age is dropping, especially for those in their early 20s, the TFR actually rose to 1.777, which places Russia at first 9 or 10 countries out of 50 developed nations, and at 6th place in Europe.

In 2017, the number of births took a drop because of another recession that hit Russia starting in 2014. However, the number of deaths also declined due to improving healthcare.

=== Immigration ===
In 2006, in a bid to compensate for the country's demographic decline, the Russian government started simplifying immigration laws and launched a state program "for providing assistance to voluntary immigration of ethnic Russians from former Soviet republics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/analysis/20060714/51327247.html|title=Russia trying to resolve demographic problem through immigration|first=|last=Sputnik|website=En.rian.ru|accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012, as the country saw its first demographic growth since the 1990s, President Putin declared that Russia's population could reach 146 million by 2025, ''mainly as a result of immigration''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.ria.ru/society/20120820/175324629.html|title=Immigration Drives Russian Population Increase|first=|last=Sputnik|website=En.ria.ru|accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Introduced in April 2014 new citizenship rules&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/node/68299|title=The Caucasus Concerned over Born-Again Russians|first=Giorgi|last=Lomsadze|date=23 April 2014|website=Eurasianet.org|accessdate=1 September 2017|via=EurasiaNet}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing citizens of former Soviet countries to obtain Russian citizenship If they meet certain criteria (e.g. preferred language, ethnicity) have gained strong interest among Russian-speaking residents of those countries (i.e. [[Russians]], [[Germans]], [[Belarusians]] and [[Ukrainians]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/node/68936|title=Uzbekistan: Minorities Taking Advantage of New Russian Citizenship Rules|work=EurasiaNet.org|accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to the opinion of the media, Central Asia is only a tiny source of immigrants; out of 100,000 ethnic Uzbeks who arrived in Russia for work only 489 settled in Russia permanently. 50,000 Russian speakers from Uzbekistan arrived in the Russian Federation to settle. The largest amount were ethnic [[Ukrainians]] – 700,000 people by a far majority. However they came because of the [[Ukraine crisis]] (another thing to note is that they were legal when an overwhelming majority come undocumented). 1.4 million ethnic [[Russians]] repatriated to their homeland in 2014, more than in previous years. {{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

There are an estimated four million illegal immigrants from the [[Republics of the Soviet Union|ex-Soviet]] states in Russia.&lt;ref name="newsru1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsru.com/russia/23nov2010/migranty.html |title=Новости NEWSru.com :: ФМС: в РФ нелегально работают 3 млн трудовых мигрантов, остальные 4 млн "халтурят" с налогами|website=Newsru.com |accessdate=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the [[Russian Federal Security Service]]'s Border Service stated there had been an increase in illegal migration from the Middle East and Southeast Asia (Note that these were Temporary Contract Migrants) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Russia reports surge in illegal migration from Asia |work=[[Indian Express]]|date=|url= http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/russia-reports-surge-in-illegal-migration-from-asia/623952/|accessdate=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under legal changes made in 2012, illegal immigrants who are caught will be banned from reentering the country for 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Migration law violators to be banned from entering Russia – Putin | work=[[Russia Today]]|date=|url= http://rt.com/politics/putin-ban-migrants-entry-755/|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Illegal immigrants can be barred from Russia for 5–10 years | work=[[The Voice of Russia]]|date=|url= http://english.ruvr.ru/2012/01/26/64674045.html|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Russia closed for immigration? |work=Russia|date=|url=http://rbth.ru/articles/2012/01/27/russia_closed_for_immigration_14261.html|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the collapse of the USSR, most immigrants have come from Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan, Moldova, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Armenia, Belarus, and China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fms.gov.ru/about/statistics/data/details/54891/ ФМС России]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Worker migration====
Temporary [[migrant worker]]s in Russia consists of about 7 million people, most of the temporary workers come from [[Central Asia]] the [[Balkans]] and [[East Asia]]. Most of them work in the construction, cleaning and in the household industries. They primarily live in cities such as [[Moscow]], [[Sochi]] and [[Blagoveshchensk]]. While worker migrants are opposed by most Russians, the mayor of Moscow said that Moscow cannot do without worker migrants. New laws are in place that require worker migrants to be fluent in Russian, know Russian history and laws. The [[Anti-Putin opposition in the Russian Federation|Russian Opposition]] and most of the Russian population opposes worker migration, [[Alexei Navalny]] stated that if he came to power he would introduce a [[Travel visa|Visa regime]] to non-[[Eurasian Union]] countries in the [[former Soviet Union]] and have a Visa free regime with the [[European Union]] and [[Western world|The West]] to attract skilled migrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/2/27/new-russian-laws-make-life-difficult-for-migrant-workers.html|title=Ruble ripple: New Russian laws make life difficult for migrant workers|publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]|access-date=2015-12-26|date=2015-02-27|last1=Luxmoore|first1=Matthew}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of worker migration has become so severe it has caused a rise in [[Russian nationalism]], and spawned groups like [[Movement Against Illegal Immigration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= The Backlash Against Immigration in Russia |work=[[Newsweek]]|date= |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2009/02/13/the-kremlin-vigilantes.html|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Some 500 illegal immigrants from Vietnam arrested in Moscow |work=[[RIA Novosti]]|date= |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2009/02/13/the-kremlin-vigilantes.html|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vital statistics==
===Total Fertility Rate from 1840 to 1926===
The [[total fertility rate]] is the number of children born per woman. It is based on fairly good data for the entire period. Sources: [[Our World In Data]] and [[Gapminder Foundation]].&lt;ref name="ourworldindata.org"&gt;{{cite|url=https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/children-born-per-woman?year=1800&amp;country=RUS|title=Total Fertility Rate around the world over the last centuries|author=Max Roser|date=2014|work=[[Our World In Data]], [[Gapminder Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many of the following years, Russia has had the highest [[Total Fertility Rate]]s of the world.&lt;ref name="ourworldindata.org"/&gt; These very high fertility rates did not increase even more the population due to the casualties of the Russian Revolution, the two world wars and political killings.

==Total fertility rate issue==
[[File:Russian Total Fertility Rates.PNG|450px|thumb|Changes in the Russian TFR since 1990.]]

In 2017, Russia's TFR of 1.62 children born/woman&lt;ref name="cia.gov"&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2127.html&lt;/ref&gt; was among the highest in Eastern Europe, meaning that the average Russian family had more children than an average family in most other Eastern European countries, but that the rate was below the [[sub-replacement fertility|replacement rate]] of 2.1. After experiencing a surge in births for several years, Russia's birth rate fell in 2017 by 10.6% percent, reaching its lowest level in 10 years.&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt;

In 1990, just prior to the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Russia's [[total fertility rate]] (TFR) stood at 1.89. Fertility rates had already begun to decline in the late 1980s due to the natural progression of Russia's demographic structure, but the rapid and widely negative changes in society following the collapse greatly influenced the rate of decline.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rand.org/pubs/conf_proceedings/CF124/index.html Russia's Demographic "Crisis"] ''1996'' [[RAND]], ''page 13-18''. Retrieved on 3 March 2009. {{ISBN|0-8330-2446-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TFR hit a historic low of 1.157 in 1999.&lt;ref name="CIA"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2127rank.html |title=The World Factbook 2009 |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] |location =Washington DC |year=2009 |accessdate=7 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only [[Federal subjects of Russia|federal subject of Russia]] to see a decline in fertility since 1999 is [[Ingushetia]], where the TFR fell from 2.443 to 2.278 in 2014.

In 2009, 8 of Russia's federal subjects had a TFR above 2.1 children per woman (the approximate minimum required to ensure population replacement), These federal subjects are [[Chechnya]] (3.38), [[Tuva]] (2.81), [[Ust-Orda Buryat Okrug]] (2.73), [[Agin-Buryat Okrug]] (2.63), [[Komi-Permyak Okrug|Komi-Permyak]] (2.16), [[Evenk Okrug]] (2.58), [[Altai Republic]] (2.36), [[Nenets Autonomous Okrug]] (2.1). Of these federal subjects, four have an ethnic Russian majority (Altai, Evenk, Ust-Orda and Nenets).&lt;ref name="tfr08"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tfr"&gt;[http://demoscope.ru/weekly/2009/0387/barom05.php Fertility Rate Statistics]. Demoscope.ru. Retrieved on 10 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the highest TFR were recorded in [[Chechnya]] (3.362), [[Tuva|Tyva]] (3.249), [[Ingushetia]] (2.94), [[Altai Republic]] (2.836), [[Sakha Republic]] (2.057), [[Buryatia]] (2.027), and [[Nenets Autonomous Okrug]] (2.007).&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/doc_2012/wo-man12.rar |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204000343/http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/doc_2012/wo-man12.rar |archivedate=4 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 2010, the Russian republic of Chechnya was the region with the highest birth rate in the former USSR (excluding Central Asia). However, in 2011, the Armenian province of [[Kashatagh Region|Qashatagh]] overtook it (28.9 vs 29.3 per 1.000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stat-nkr.am/files/yearbooks/2004_2010/5_bnakchut.pdf|format=PDF|title=POPULATION|website=Stat-nkr.am|accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the average number of children born to women has decreased from 1513 to 1000 women from 2002 to 1469 in 2010 in urban areas the figure was 1328 children (2002–1350), and in the village – 1876 (in 2002, – 1993).

In recent years the percentage of children per woman 16 years or more were:

Year : 2002–2010

1 child : 30.5%–31.2%

2 children : 33.7%–34.4%

3 children : 8.9%–8.7%

4 or more children : 5.2%–4.2%

no children : 21.7%–21.5%

Despite a decrease in women who have not had children, the number of three-child and large families has declined between 2002 and 2010.

In every region in Russia, rural areas reported higher TFR compared to urban areas. In most of the federal subjects in [[Siberia]] and the [[Russian Far East]], the total fertility rates were high, but not high enough to ensure population replacement. For example, [[Zabaykalsky Krai]] had a TFR of 1.82, which is higher than the national average, but less than the 2.1 needed for population replacement.&lt;ref name="tfr08"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gks.ru/dbscripts/Cbsd/DBInet.cgi?pl=2415002 |title=Rosstat TFR database |website=Gks.ru |accessdate=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to the [[G7|G7 countries]], in 2015, Russian TFR of 1.78 children/ woman&lt;ref name="euromonitor1"&gt;[http://blog.euromonitor.com/2013/02/russian-birth-rate-above-regional-average.html Russian Birth Rate above Regional Average], Euromonitor International, retrieved on 26 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; was lower than that of France (1.93), the USA (1.84), the UK (1.82). Yet its TFR is higher than in other G7 countries like Canada (1.61), Germany (1.50), Japan (1.46) and Italy (1.35).

Compared to other [[List of countries by population|most populous nations]], Russia has a lower TFR than Nigeria (5.37), Pakistan (3.42), Indonesia (2.5), India (2.30), Mexico (2.19), the USA (1.84),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr61/nvsr61_05.pdf|format=PDF|title=Births: Preliminary Data for 2011|website=Cdc.gov|accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and higher TFR than Brazil (1.74), and China (1.5-1.6).

''Further information:'' [[List of federal subjects of Russia by life expectancy]]

''total population:'' 72.5 years&lt;ref name="lenta.ru"/&gt;
&lt;br&gt;''male:'' 67.5 years&lt;ref name="lenta.ru"/&gt;
&lt;br&gt;''female:'' 77.4 years&lt;ref name="lenta.ru"/&gt;

The disparity in the average lifespan between genders in Russia is largest in the world. Women live 9–12 years longer than men, while the difference in lifespan is typically only five years in other parts of the world.  [[David Stuckler]], [[Lawrence King (sociologist)|Lawrence King]], and [[Martin McKee]] propose mass [[privatization]] and the neo-liberalist [[Shock therapy (economics)|shock therapy]] policies of [[Yeltsin]] administration as key reasons of falling life expectancy of Russian men.&lt;ref name="thelancet.com"/&gt;  As of 2011, the average life expectancy in Russia was 64.3 years for males and 76.1 years for females.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perepis-2010.ru/news/detail.php?ID=7049 |title=Ожидаемая продолжительность жизни россиян выросла на 3,7 года в 2011г – Голикова |website=Perepis-2010.ru |date= |accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the WHO 2011 report,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/publications/global_alcohol_report/msbgsruprofiles.pdf|format=PDF|title=Global status report on alcohol and health|website=Who.int|accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; annual per capita alcohol consumption in Russia is about 15.76 litres, [[List of countries by alcohol consumption|fourth highest]] volume in Europe (compare to 13.37 in the UK, 13.66 in France, 15.6 in [[Ukraine]], 16.45 in the [[Czech Republic]], etc.).
In the late 1950s, the USSR claimed a higher life expectancy than the United States,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/yeltsin-healthier-than-the-average-russian-1365525.html Yeltsin: healthier than the average Russian: Poverty, pollution and drink has slashed life expectancy, writes Phil Reeves], ''[[The Independent]]'', 29 September 1996&lt;/ref&gt; but the Soviet Union has lagged behind Western countries in terms of mortality and life expectancy since the late 1960s.&lt;br /&gt;
When controlling for confounding variables, neither alcoholism, poverty, pollution, nor the collapse of the health system explain the high male mortality. Most former communist countries got through the same economic collapse and health system collapse. Alcohol consumption per capita is as high in other East European countries. Poverty is high in many other countries. One factor that could explain the low male lifespan in Russia is violence, tolerance for violence and tolerance for risk, "male toughness".{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Violence, tolerance for risk together with alcoholism reduce the Russian male lifespan.

The life expectancy was about 70 in 1986,&lt;ref&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/sutoc.html A Country Study: Soviet Union (Former)] Federal Research Division, Library of Congress, Edited by Raymond E. Zickel 1989. Chapter 3 – Population – Vital Statistics&lt;/ref&gt; prior to the transition-induced disruption of the healthcare system. The turmoil in the early 1990s caused life expectancy in Russia to steadily decrease while it was steadily increasing in the rest of the world. Recently however, Russian life expectancy has again begun to rise. Between 2006—2011 the male life expectancy in Russia rose by almost four years, increasing the overall life expectancy by nearly 4 years to 70.3.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

=== Mortality ===
In 2012, 1,043,292, or 55% of all deaths in Russia were caused by [[cardiovascular disease]]. The second leading cause of death was cancer which claimed 287,840 lives (15.2%). External causes of death such as suicide (1.5%), road accidents (1.5%), murders (0.8%), accidental alcohol poisoning (0.4%), and accidental drowning (0.5%), claimed 202,175 lives in total (10.6%). Other major causes of death were diseases of the digestive system (4.6%), respiratory disease (3.6%), infectious and parasitic diseases (1.6%), and tuberculosis (0.9%).&lt;ref name="Gks.ru" /&gt; The [[infant mortality rate]] in 2012 was 7.6 deaths per 1,000 (down from 8.2 in 2009 and 16.9 in 1999).&lt;ref name="Gks.ru"/&gt;

=== Under-five mortality rate ===
:7.7 deaths/1000 live births (2016)&lt;ref&gt;http://databank.worldbank.org/data/reports.aspx?source=2&amp;series=SH.DYN.MORT&amp;country=&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abortions and family planning ===
{{main|Abortion in Russia}}

In the 1980s only 8% to 10% of married Russian women of reproductive age used [[hormonal birth control|hormonal]] and [[Contraception#Intrauterine methods|intrauterine]] [[contraception]] methods, compared to 20% to 40% in [[developed country|developed countries]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
This led to much higher abortion rates in Russia compared to developed countries: in the 1980s Russia had a figure of 120 abortions per 1,000 women of reproductive age compared with only 20 per 1,000 in [[developed countries|Western countries]]. However, after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 many changes took place, such as the demonopolization of the market for contraceptive drugs and media liberalization, which led to a rapid conversion to more efficient pregnancy-control practices. Abortion rates fell in the first half of the 1990s for the first time in Russia's history, even despite declining fertility rates. From the early 1990s to 2006, the number of expected abortions per woman during her lifetime fell by nearly 2.5 times, from 3.4 to 1.2. As of 2004, the share of women of reproductive age using hormonal or intrauterine birth control methods was about 46% (29% intrauterine, 17% hormonal).&lt;ref name="und"&gt;[http://hdr.undp.org/en/reports/nationalreports/europethecis/russia/NHDR_Russia_2008_Eng.pdf National Human Development Report Russian Federation 2008], [[UNDP]],''pages 47–49'', Retrieved on 10 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite an increase in "[[family planning]]", a large portion of Russian families do not achieve the target of desired children at the desired time. According to a 2004 study, current pregnancies were termed "desired and timely" by 58% of respondents, while 23% described them as "desired, but untimely", and 19% said they were "undesired". The share of [[unintended pregnancy|unexpected pregnancies]] remains much lower in countries with developed [[family planning]] culture, such as the [[Netherlands]], whose percentage of unwanted pregnancies 20 years before was half of that in Russia {{as of | 2008 | lc = on}}.&lt;ref name="und"/&gt;

{{Main|Ethnic groups in Russia}}
{{Further|List of indigenous peoples of Russia}}

The Russian Federation is home to as many as 160 different [[ethnic groups]] and [[indigenous people]]s. As of the 2010 census, 80.90% of the population that disclosed their ethnicity (111,016,896 people) is ethnically [[Russians|Russian]], followed by (groups larger than one million):&lt;ref name="perepis-2010.ru"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rg.ru"/&gt;
*1.40% [[Ukrainians]] (1,927,988){{efn|name=ua_pop|Millions of Ukrainians have immigrated into Russia since the start of [[War in Donbass]] in 2014.}}
: 4.1% (5,864,000) settled, refugee or working plus temporaneous or permanent settlement.
*3.77% [[Tatars]] (5,310,649)
*1.15% [[Bashkirs]] (1,584,554)
*1.05% [[Chuvash people|Chuvashs]] (1,435,872)
*1.04% [[Chechen people|Chechens]] (1,431,360)
*0.86% [[Armenians]] (1,182,388)

According to the 2010 Census in Russia lived 142,856,536 people. It is important to note that 5,629,429 people (3.94% of the overall population.) did not declare any ethnic origin, compared to about 1 million in the 2002 Census. This is due to the fact that those people were counted from administrative databases and not directly, and were therefore unable to state their ethnicity.&lt;ref name="perepis-2010.ru"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perepis-2010.ru/news/detail.php?ID=6944 |title=Владивосток: В России стало больше русских |website=Perepis-2010.ru |date=20 December 2011 |accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the percentages mentioned above are taken from the total population that declared their ethnicity, given that the non-declared remainder is thought to have an ethnic composition similar to the declared segment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perepis-2010.ru/news/detail.php?ID=6936 |title=Перепись-2010: русских становится больше |website=Perepis-2010.ru |date=19 December 2011 |accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most smaller groups live compactly in their respective regions and can be categorized by language group.
The ethnic divisions used here are those of the official census, and may in some respects be controversial. The following lists all ethnicities resolved by the 2010 census, grouped by language:&lt;ref name="perepis-2010.ru"/&gt;

The ethno-demographic structure of Russia has gradually changed over time. During the past century the most striking change is the fast increase of the peoples from the [[Caucasus]]. In 1926, these people composed 2% of the Russian population, compared to 6.5% in 2010. Though low in absolute numbers, the Siberian people also increased during the past century, but their growth was mainly realized after WW II (from 0.7% in 1959 to 1.2% in 2010) and not applicable to most of the small peoples (less than 10,000 people).

====Peoples of European Russia====
The relative proportion of the peoples of European Russia gradually decreased during the past century, but still compose 91% of the total population of Russia in 2010. The absolute numbers of most of these peoples reached its highest level in the beginning of the 1990s. Since 1992, natural growth in Russia has been negative and the numbers of all peoples of European Russia were lower in 2010 than in 2002, the only exceptions being the Roma (due to high fertility rates) and the Gagauz (due to high levels of migration from Moldova to Russia).

Several peoples saw a much larger decrease than can be explained by the low fertility rates and high mortality rates in Russia during the past two decades. Emigration and assimilation contributed to the decrease in numbers of many peoples. Emigration was the most important factor for Germans, Jews and Baltic peoples (Estonians, Latvians, Lithuanians). The number of Germans halved between 1959 and 2010. Their main country of destination is [[Germany]].

The number of Jews decreased by more than 80% between 1959 and 2010. In 1970, the Soviet Union had the third largest population of Jews in the world, (2,183,000 of whom 808,000 with residence in Russia), following only that of the United States and [[Israel]]. By 2010, due to Jewish emigration, their number fell as low as 158,000. A sizeable emigration of other minorities has been enduring, too. The main destinations of emigrants from Russia are the USA (Russians, Jews, Belarusians, Chechens, Meskhetian Turks, Ukrainians and others), [[Israel]] (Jews), Germany (Germans and Jews), [[Poland]] (Poles), Canada (Finns and Ukrainians), [[Finland]] (Finns), [[France]] (Jews and Armenians) and the United Kingdom (mainly rich Russians).{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

Assimilation (i.e., marrying Russians and having children of such unions counted as Russians) explains the decrease in numbers of Ukrainians, Belarusians and most of the Uralic peoples. The assimilation is reflected in the high median age of these peoples (see the table below), as assimilation is stronger among young people than among old people. The process of assimilation of the Uralic peoples of Russia is probably going on for centuries and is most prominent among the [[Mordvins]] (1.4% of the Russian population in 1926 and 0.5% in 2010), the [[Karelians]], [[Vepsians|Veps]] and [[Izhorians]].

Assimilation on the other hand slowed down the decrease of the number of ethnic Russians. Besides, the decrease of the number of Russians was also slowed down by the immigration of ethnic Russians from the former Soviet republics, especially Central Asia. Similarly, the numbers of Ukrainians, Belarusians, Germans, Jews, and other non-autochthonous ethnic groups has also been decreased by emigration to Ukraine, Belarus, Germany, Israel, and so forth, respectively.

{{See also|Illegal immigration in Russia|List of countries by immigrant population}}
[[File:COB data Russia.PNG|right|450px|thumb]]
Russia experiences a constant flow of immigration. On average, close to 300,000 legal immigrants enter the country every year; about half{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} are ethnic Russians from the other republics of the former Soviet Union. There is a significant inflow of ethnic [[Armenians]], [[Uzbeks]], [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] and [[Tājik people|Tajiks]] into big Russian cities, something that is viewed unfavorably by some citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2007/10/75118827-7d89-462e-b4b5-6a433de19a49.html Central Asia: Labor Migrants Face Abuse, Xenophobia] Rferl.org, Retrieved on 15 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2013 opinion poll, 74% of Russians view the large number of labor migrants as a negative phenomenon.&lt;ref name="fairobserver.com"&gt;{{cite news|first=Alisher|last=Ilkhamov|url=http://www.fairobserver.com/region/europe/central-asian-migrants-russia-heated-debate-69753/|title=Central Asian Migrants in Russia: A Heated Debate|work=Fair Observer|date=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[United Nations]], Russia's legal immigrant population is the third biggest in the world, numbering 11.6 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ashley|last=Kirk|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/12111108/Mapped-Which-country-has-the-most-immigrants.html|title=Mapped: Which country has the most immigrants?|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=21 Jan 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are an [[Illegal immigration in Russia|estimated 4 million illegal immigrants]] from the [[Republics of the Soviet Union|ex-Soviet]] states in Russia.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsru.com/russia/23nov2010/migranty.html |title=Новости NEWSru.com :: ФМС: в РФ нелегально работают 3 млн трудовых мигрантов, остальные 4 млн "халтурят" с налогами |website=Newsru.com |accessdate=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Ukraine-Russia was the world's largest migration corridor after Mexico-USA.&lt;ref name="http://worldbank.org/"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/661301460400427908/MigrationandDevelopmentBrief26.pdf#page=7|title=Migration and Remittances: Recent Developments and Outlook|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Armenian government, between 80,000 and 120,000 Armenians travel to Russia every year to do seasonal work, returning home for the winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Lilit|last=Arakelyan|url=https://iwpr.net/global-voices/armenians-enticed-russian-passport-offer|title=Armenians Enticed by Russian Passport Offer|date=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Tajik government, at least 870,000 Tajiks are working in Russia.&lt;ref name="rferl.org"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rferl.org/a/tajik-official-says-migration-to-russia-down/27873757.html|title=Tajik Official Says Migration To Russia Down|date=July 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, [[remittance]]s from Russia accounted for around one-third of Kyrgyzstan's and over 40% of Tajikistan's GDP.&lt;ref name="intellinews.com"&gt;{{cite news|first=Kanat|last=Shaku|url=http://www.intellinews.com/central-asian-remittances-from-russia-begin-to-recover-107159/|title=Central Asian remittances from Russia begin to recover|date=September 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kazakhs]] in Russia are mostly not recent immigrants.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} The majority inhabit regions bordering [[Kazakhstan]] such as the [[Astrakhan Oblast|Astrakhan]] (16% of the population are [[Kazakhs]]), [[Orenburg Oblast|Orenburg]] (6% of the population are [[Kazakhs]]), [[Omsk Oblast|Omsk]] (4% of the population are [[Kazakhs]]) and [[Saratov Oblast|Saratov]] (3% of the population are [[Kazakhs]]) oblasts. Together these oblasts host 60% of the Kazakh population in Russia. The number of [[Kazakhs]] slightly decreased between 2002 and 2010 due to emigration to [[Kazakhstan]], which has by far the strongest economy in Central Asia (Russia does receive immigration from Kazakhstan, but they are mainly ethnic Russians); other Central Asian populations, especially Uzbeks, Tajiks, and Kyrgyz, have continued to rise rapidly. (Turkmen are an exception; citizens of Turkmenistan do not have [[visa policy of Russia|visa-free access]] to Russia.)

Russian statistical organizations classify the immigrants based on their ethnicity, although there is an information gap between 2007 and 2013, In 2007, the net immigration was 190,397 (plus another 49,546 for which ethnicity was unknown). Of this, 97,813 was Slavic / Germanic / Finnic (51.4%, of which Russian – 72,769, Ukrainian – 17,802), Turkic and other Muslim – 52,536 (27.6%, of which Azeri – 14,084, Tatar – 10,391, Uzbek – 10,517, Tajik – 9,032, Kyrgyz – 7,533 &amp; Kazakh – (-) 1,424) and Others – 40,048 (21.0%, of which Armenian – 25,719).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gks.ru/bgd/regl/B08_16/IssWWW.exe/Stg/html1/07-11.htm|title=Национальный состав международных мигрантов|website=Gks.ru|accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many immigrants are actually migrant workers, who come to Russia and work for around five years then return to their countries. Major sources of migrant workers but where permanent migrants of majority ethnicity of those countries are virtually nonexistent are in 2013. [[China]] 200,000 migrant workers, 1000 settled permanently. [[Uzbekistan]] 100,000 migrant workers, 489 permanent settlers. [[Tajikistan]] 80,000 migrant workers, 220 settled permanently. [[Kyrgyzstan]] 50,000 miagrant workers, 219 settled permanently. [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]- 20,000 worker arrivals, 612 settled permanently.

===Median age and fertility===
Median ages of ethnic groups vary considerably between groups. Ethnic Russians and other Slavic and Finnic groups have higher median age compared to the Caucasian groups.

Median ages are strongly correlated with [[Total fertility rate|fertility rates]], ethnic groups with higher fertility rates have lower median ages, and vice versa. For example, in 2002, in the ethnic group with the lowest median age – [[Ingush people|Ingush]] – women 35 or older had, on average, 4.05 children; in the ethnic group with the highest median age – Jews – women 35 or older averaged only 1.37 children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perepis2002.ru/ct/html/TOM_12_05.htm|title=5. ЖЕНЩИНЫ НАИБОЛЕЕ МНОГОЧИСЛЕННЫХ НАЦИОНАЛЬНОСТЕЙ ПО ВОЗРАСТНЫМ ГРУППАМ И ЧИСЛУ РОЖДЕННЫХ ДЕТЕЙ ПО СУБЪЕКТАМ РОССИЙСКОЙ ФЕДЕРАЦИИ|website=Prerpis2002.ru|accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ethnic Jews have both the highest median age and the lowest fertility rate; this is a consequence of [[Aliyah|Jewish emigration]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

Ethnic Russians represent a significant deviation from the pattern, with second lowest fertility rate of all major groups, but relatively low median age (37.6 years). This phenomenon is at least partly due to a high mortality rate among older people, especially males as well af the fact that children from mixed marriages are often registered as ethnic Russians in the census. The most noticeable trend in the past couple of decades is the convergence of birth rates between minorities (including Muslim minorities) and the Russian majority.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

The following table shows the variation in median age and fertility rates according to 2002 census.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://perepis2002.ru/ct/doc/TOM_04_07.xls|format=XLS|title=7.

Russia officially recognizes Orthodox Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Buddhism as traditional religions. Russia has large populations of non-practicing believers and non-believers; many people identify only nominally with a religion. There is no official census on religion in Russia. The Pew Research Center found that 71% of Russians identified as Orthodox, with 1.8% Protestants, 0.5% Catholics and 0.3% other Christians.&lt;ref name="Pew Christians"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2011/12/19/table-christian-population-as-percentages-of-total-population-by-country/|title=Christian Population|website=pewforum.org|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pew Orthodox"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2017/05/10/religious-affiliation/|title=Religious Belief and National Belonging in Central and Eastern Europe|website=pewforum.org|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pew estimated 11.7% of the population to be Muslim as of 2010.&lt;ref name="Pew Muslims"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2011/01/27/table-muslim-population-by-country/|title=Muslim Population by Country|website=pewforum.org|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of practicing worshipers are:

Other branches of Christianity present in Russia include Roman Catholicism (approx. 1%), [[Baptists]], [[Pentecostals]], [[Lutherans]] and other Protestant churches (together totalling about 0.5% of the population) and [[Old Believers]].&lt;ref name="ArenaAtlas"&gt;[http://sreda.org/en/arena "Arena: Atlas of Religions and Nationalities in Russia"].

According to the data of the 2010 Census, presented above, 88.26% of the people who stated their ethnicity belong to traditional Christian ethnic groups, 10.90% belong to traditional Muslim ethnic groups and 0.84% belong to traditional Buddhist, Jewish, Hindu and other ethnic groups.

==Education==
[[File:1 сентября - День знаний !.JPG|thumb|200px|The 1st September, [[Knowledge day]] in Russia]]
{{Main|Education in Russia}}

===Literacy===
''definition:'' age 15 and over can read and write
&lt;br&gt;''total literacy:'' 99.7% (2015)
&lt;br&gt;''male:'' 99.7%
&lt;br&gt;''female:'' 99.6%&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt;

Russia's free, widespread and in-depth educational system, inherited with almost no changes from the Soviet Union, has produced nearly 100% literacy. 97% of children receive their compulsory 9-year basic or complete 11-year education in Russian. Other languages are also used in their respective republics, for instance [[Tatar language|Tatar]] (1%), [[Yakut language|Yakut]] (0.4%) etc.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

About 3 million students attend Russia's 519 institutions of higher education and 48 universities. As a result of great emphasis on [[Science, technology and society|science and technology]] in education, Russian medical, mathematical, scientific, and space and aviation research is generally of a high order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eubusiness.com/Russia/russia-country-guide/ |title=Russia country guide – EUbusiness.com – business, legal and financial news and information from the European Union |website=Eubusiness.com |accessdate=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Labour force==
The Russian [[labour force]] is undergoing tremendous changes. Although well-educated and skilled, it is largely mismatched to the rapidly changing needs of the [[Russian economy]]. The unemployment rate in Russia was 5.3% as of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20131017-705657.html | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=Russia Capital Investment Falls 1.6% in September - Rosstat}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unemployment is highest among women and young people. Following the [[breakup of the Soviet Union]] and the economic dislocation it engendered, the standard of living fell dramatically. However, since recovering from the [[1998 Russian financial crisis|1998 economic crisis]], the standard of living has been on the rise. As of 2010 about 13.1% of the population was living below the [[list of countries by percentage of population living in poverty|poverty line]], compared to 40% in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indexmundi.com/russia/population_below_poverty_line.html|title=Russia Population below poverty line|website=Indexmundi.com|accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average yearly salary in Russia was $14,302 (about $23,501 [[purchasing power parity|PPP]]) as of October 2013, up from $455 per year in August 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24443419/ Russians weigh an enigma with Putin's protégé] [[MSNBC]] Retrieved on 29 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Putin's Economy—Eight Years On|website=Russiaprofile.org|url=http://www.russiaprofile.org/page.php?pageid=Business&amp;articleid=a1187177738|accessdate=27 December 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222040740/http://www.russiaprofile.org/page.php?pageid=Business&amp;articleid=a1187177738|archivedate=22 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.CD|title=GDP per capita, PPP (current international $)|website=Data.worldbank.org|accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the FMS, as of 2011, there were 7,000,000 immigrants working in Russia. Half of these were from Ukraine, while the remainder was mostly from Central Asia. Only 3 million or less than half of all the immigrants are legal. Illegal immigrants number 4&amp;nbsp;million, mostly from Ukraine and the Caucasus.&lt;ref name="newsru1"/&gt; The Census usually covers only a part of this population and the last one (2002 Census) counted one million non-citizens.

==Population of main cities==
Russia is a highly urbanized country, with 74.2% of the total population (2017) living in urban areas.&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt; [[Moscow]]  is the capital and [[List of cities and towns in Russia by population|most populous city]] of Russia, with 12.2 million residents within the [[city limits]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/new_site/population/demo/Popul2015.xls&lt;/ref&gt; and 17.1 million within the [[urban area]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citypopulation.de/world/Agglomerations.html |title=Major Agglomerations of the World - Population Statistics and Maps |publisher=Citypopulation.de |date= |accessdate=September 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moscow is recognized as a [[Federal cities of Russia|Russian federal city]].

==Rural life==
[[Image:E7548-Cherlak-typical-street.jpg|thumb|[[Cherlak]], a typical small town - or a large village - in Western Siberia]]
Rural life in Russia is distinct from many other nations.  Relatively few Russian people live in [[village#Russia|villages]]—rural population accounted for 26% of the total population according to the [[Russian Census (2010)|2010 Russian Census]]. Some people own or rent village houses and use them as [[dachas]] (summer houses).

He was assistant professor at Heidelberg University from 1969–1973, professor at the [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg|University of Erlangen]] (1973–1975) and at [[Saarland University]] (1975–1990). Until 2009, he held a chair for [[number theory]] at the [[Institute for Experimental Mathematics]] at the [[University of Duisburg-Essen]], campus [[Essen]].

Frey was a visiting scientist at several universities and research institutions, including the [[Ohio State University]], [[Harvard University]], the [[University of California, Berkeley]], the [[Mathematical Sciences Research Institute]] (MSRI), the Institute for Advanced Studies at [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], and the [[Instituto Nacional de Matemática Pura e Aplicada]] (IMPA) in [[Rio de Janeiro]].

Frey was also the co-editor of the journal ''[[Manuscripta Mathematica]]''.

==Research contributions==
His research areas are [[number theory]] and [[Arithmetic|arithmetical]] [[geometry]], as well as applications to [[coding theory]] and [[cryptography]]. 
In 1985, Frey pointed out a connection between [[Fermat's last theorem]] and the [[Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture]], and this connection was made precise shortly thereafter by [[Kenneth Ribet]], who proved that the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture implies Fermat's last theorem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Piergiorgio |last=Odifreddi |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zAIar8Ee80QC&amp;pg=PA86 |title=The Mathematical Century: The 30 Greatest Problems of the Last 100 years |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |year=2006 |isbn=0-691-12805-7 |page=87 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach provided a framework for the subsequent successful attack on Fermat's last theorem by [[Andrew Wiles]] in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Bernstein |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/28/books/books-times-following-proof-fermat-s-theorem-far-horizon-pure-reason.html?pagewanted=1 |title=Following a Proof of Fermat's Theorem to the Far Horizon of Pure Reason |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=November 28, 1997 |accessdate=January 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Frey proposed the idea of [[Weil descent]] attack for elliptic curves over finite fields with composite degree. As a result of this attack, [[Cryptography|cryptographers]] lost their interest in these curves.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Guide to Elliptic Curve Cryptography|first1=Darrel|last1=Hankerson|first2=Scott|last2=Vanstone|first3=Alfred J.|last3=Menezes|publisher=Springer|year=2004|isbn=9780387952734|pages=170–171}}..&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
Frey was awarded the Gauss medal of the ''Braunschweigische Wissenschaftliche Gesellschaft'' in 1996 for his work on [[Fermat's Last Theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bwg-niedersachsen.de/cgi-bin/moin.cgi/_dcber_20die_20BWG/Die_20Gauss_20Medaille?action=highlight&amp;value=Frey Die Gauß Medaille]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (in German), Braunschweigische Wissenschaftliche Gesellschaft. Accessed January 24, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1998, he has been a member of the [[Göttingen Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/document/download/3716a19481c54eb4f7ff7c65c6429712.pdf/kompetenzhandbuch_web2.pdf |title=Member list |language=German |work=[[Göttingen Academy of Sciences]] |accessdate=January 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, he received the ''Certicom ECC Visionary Award'' for his contributions to [[elliptic curve cryptography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |url=http://www.securitytechnet.com/resource/crypto/code&amp;cipher/CC-06-final.pdf |title=Certicom ECC Visionary Award |work=Code and Cipher |volume=3 |year=2006 |issue=1 |page=1 |accessdate=January 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hannah Dodd''' (born 27 April 1992) is an Australian [[Grade 4 (classification)|Grade IV]] [[Equestrian at the Summer Paralympics|equestrian]] and [[1 point player|1.0 point]] [[wheelchair basketball]] player who represented [[Australia at the 2012 Summer Paralympics|Australia]] in [[equestrian at the 2012 Summer Paralympics]] in London, coming 11th and 12th in her events. Switching to wheelchair basketball, she made her debut with the [[Australia women's national wheelchair basketball team|national team]] at the Osaka Cup in February 2015.

In 2008, Dodd was the Australian national Grade IV para-equestrian champion. She was runner-up in 2009, and won the Australian national championships again in 2011, along with the Oceania Championships and the National Titles team events. By 2012, she was the top-ranked Australian competitor in her event and class.

After the London Paralympics, Dodd took up [[wheelchair basketball]]. She started playing for the Sydney University Flames in the [[Women's National Wheelchair Basketball League]] in 2013, made her debut with the [[Australia women's national wheelchair basketball team|national team]] at the Osaka Friendship Games in [[Osaka]] in February 2015, winning bronze, and was part of the Under 25 team at the [[2015 Women's U25 Wheelchair Basketball World Championship]] in [[Beijing]] in July 2015, winning silver.

==Wheelchair basketball==
After the London Paralympics, Dodd took up [[wheelchair basketball]]. She started for the Sydney University Flames in the [[Women's National Wheelchair Basketball League]] in 2013. She has to strap her fingers and wrists, and usually dislocates a shoulder during a game. "I've had a few bangs and scrapes and been tipped out of my chair a few times," she concedes, "but it's really fun. The fast pace really gives you an adrenalin kick and the girls I play with are awesome."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]| location =  [[Sydney]]||url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/the-hills/arcadia8217s-hannah-dodd-swaps-paralympic-dressage-for-basketball/story-fngr8j1q-1226651644194 |title=Arcadia's Hannah Dodd swaps Paralympic dressage for basketball |first=Lawrence |last=Machado |date=27 May 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; "If I have chose between my two sports for Rio," she said, "I will go with basketball."&lt;ref name="Paralympian Dodd a Dare Devil" /&gt;

'''Hebrew names''' are [[name]]s that have a [[Hebrew language]] origin, classically from the [[Hebrew Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mordecai Schreiber|author2=Alvin I. Schiff|author3=Leon Klenicki|title=The Shengold Jewish Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DK5K72JymAEC&amp;pg=PA190|year=2003|publisher=Schreiber Pub.|isbn=978-1-887563-77-2|page=190}}. Archived [https://web.archive.org/web/20170217052951/https://books.google.com/books?id=DK5K72JymAEC&amp;pg=PA190&amp;dq=%22Hebrew+name%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ButHUYbFA7jI4AP164CgBw&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwAw here]&lt;/ref&gt; They are mostly used by Jews and Christians, but many are also adapted to the [[Islam]]ic world, particularly if a Hebrew name is mentioned in the [[Qur'an]] (example: ''Ibrahim'' is a common Arabic name from the Hebrew ''Avraham'').  A typical Hebrew name can have many different forms, having been adapted to the [[phonology|phonologies]] of many different [[language]]s. A common Jewish practice worldwide is to give a Hebrew name to a child that is used religiously throughout his or her lifetime.

Not all Hebrew names are strictly Hebrew in origin; some names may have been borrowed from other ancient languages,  including from [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]], [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]], or [[Canaanite language|Canaanite]].

==Names of Hebrew origin==
Hebrew names used by [[Jew]]s (along with many Hebrew names used in [[Christendom]]) often come from the [[Tanakh]], also known as the [[Hebrew Bible]] or [[Old Testament]].

Many of these names are thought to have been adapted from Hebrew phrases and expressions, bestowing special meaning or the unique circumstances of birth to the one who receives that name. 

[[Theophoric name]]s are those which include a form of a divine name, such by adding the suffix אל ''-el'', meaning "God," forming names such as מיכאל ''[[Michael]]'' ("who is like God?") and גבריאל ''[[Gabriel]]'' ("man of God"). Another common form of theophory is the use of the [[Tetragrammaton]] as the basis for a suffix; the most common abbreviations used by Jews are יה ''-yāh''/''-iyyāh'' and יהו ''-yāhû''/''-iyyāhû''/''-ayhû'', forming names such as ישׁעיהו ''[[Isaiah|Yəšaʻªyāhû]]'' (Isaiah), צדקיהו ''[[Zedekiah|Ṣiḏqiyyāhû]]'' (Zedekiah) and שׂריה ''[[Seraiah|Śərāyāh]]'' (Seraiah). Most Christian usage is of the shorter suffix preferred in [[translation]]s of the [[Septuagint|Bible]] to European languages: Greek -ιας ''-ias'' and English [[Jah|-iah]], producing names such as Τωβιας ''[[Tobias|Tōbias]]'' (Tobias, Toby) instead of ''Tobiyyahu'' and Ιερεμίας ''[[Jeremiah|Ieremias]]'' (Jeremiah, Jeremy) instead of ''Yirmeyahu''.

In addition to devotion to Elohim and YHWH, names could also be sentences of praise in their own right. The name טוביהו 
''[[Tobiah|Ṭôḇiyyāhû]]'' means "Good of/is the LORD."

== Names of Aramaic origin ==
Judæo-Aramaic was the vernacular language at the time of [[Jesus]], and was also the language used to write parts of the [[Book of Daniel]], the [[Book of Ezra]], and the entire Jewish Babylonian [[Talmud]].  Aramaic remained the [[lingua franca]] of the Middle East until the time of Islam.

Judæo-Aramaic names include עבד־נגו ''[[Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego#Fiery furnace|ʻĂḇēḏ-nəḡô]]'', בר־תלמי ''[[Bartholomew|Bar-Talmay]]'' and תום ''[[Thomas (name)|Tôm]]'', as well as [[Bar Kochba]].

==Hebrew-Greek names==
Due to the [[Hellenization|Hellenisation]] of the Eastern Mediterranean and the movement of Jews around the area, many Hebrew names were adapted to Greek, reinforced by the translation of the Tanakh in the [[Septuagint]] with many Hellenized names.    

Many of the names in the [[New Testament]] are of Hebrew and Aramaic origin, but were adapted to the Greek by Hellenistic Christian writers such as [[Paul of Tarsus]]. 

Such Hebræo-Greek names include Ἰησοῦς ''[[Jesus|Iēsous]]'' (originally from ישׁוע ''Yēšûªʻ''), Νῶε ''[[Noah|Nōē]]'' (originally from נח ''Nōªḥ''), Ἰσαΐας ''[[Isaiah|Isaias]]'' (originally from ישׁעיהו ''Yəšaʻªyāhû''), Ἰσραήλ ''[[Israel|Israēl]]'' (originally from ישראל ''Yiśrā’ēl''). 

Also, some Jews of the time had Greek [[Gentile]] names themselves, such as the Christian [[Luke (name)|Luke]] (Greek Λουκᾶς ''Loukas'').  Though used by some Jews at the time, these names are generally not associated with Jews today, and are considered characteristically Greek and largely confined to use by Christians. Hebrew forms of the names exist, but they are extremely rare.

==Hebræo-Latin names==
Many Hebrew names were adapted into Latin, some via Greek.  Such names include Jesus (from Greek Ιησους ''Iēsous'') and [[Maria (given name)|Maria]] (from Greek Μαριαμ ''Mariam'', originally from Hebrew מרים ''[[Miriam|Miryām]]'').

Also, some Jews during [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times also had Latin names for themselves, such as the Christian evangelist [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]] (Latin [[Marcus (name)|Marcus]]). As was the case with contemporary Jewish names of Greek origin, most of these Latin names are generally not associated with Jews today, and today retain a Roman and Christian character.

== Hebræo-Arabic names ==
With the rise of Islam and the establishment of an Arab [[Caliphate]], the [[Arabic language]] became the lingua franca of the Middle East and some parts of [[Berber people|Berber]] [[North Africa]]. Islamic scripture such as the Qurʼan, however, contains many names of Hebrew origin (often via Aramaic), and there were Jewish and Christian [[minority group|minorities]] living under Arab Islamic rule. As such, many Hebrew names had been adapted to Arabic, and could be found in the Arab world. Jews and Christians generally used the Arabic adaptions of these names, just as in the present English-speaking Jews (and sometimes Muslims) often use Anglicized versions (Joshua rather than Yəhôšúªʼ, for instance.)

While most such names are common to traditional Arabic translations of the Bible, a few differ; for instance, Arabic-speaking Christians use ''Yasūʻ'' instead of ''[[Jesus in Islam|ʻĪsā]]'' for "[[Jesus]]".

Such Hebræo-Arabic names include:

*[[Job in Islam|ʼAyyūb]] أيّوب (from Hebrew איוב ''[[Book of Job|ʼIyyôḇ]]'') (Job)
*[[Joseph in Islam|Yūsuf]] يوسف (from Hebrew יוסף ''[[Joseph (given name)|Yôsēp̄]]'') (Joseph)
*[[David in Islam|Dāʼūd]] داۇد (from Hebrew דוד ''[[David|Dāwiḏ]]'') (David)
*[[Ishmael in Islam|ʼIsmāʻīl]] اسماعيل (from Hebrew ישׁמעאל ''[[Ishmael|Yišmāʻêl]]'') (Ishmael)
*[[Isaac in Islam|ʼIsḥāq]] إسحاق (from Hebrew יצחק ''[[Isaac|Yiṣḥāq]]'') (Isaac)
*[[Jacob in Islam|Yaʻqūb]] يعقوب (from Hebrew יעקב ''[[Jacob|Yaʻªqōḇ]]'') (Jacob)
*[[Adam in Islam|ʼĀdam]] آدم (from Hebrew אדם ''[[Adam (name)|ʼĀḏām]]'') (Adam)
*[[Hawwa|Ḥawwāʼ]] حواء (from Hebrew חוה ''[[Adam and Eve|Ḥawwāh]]'') (Eve)

The influence of Aramaic is observable in several names, notably ʼIsḥāq (Isaac), where the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] form is simply ''Îsḥāq'', contrasting with more Hebraic forms such as Yaʻqūb (Jacob).

Some of these Arabic names preserve original Hebrew pronunciations that were later changed by regular sound shifts; ''migdal'', recorded in the New Testament as ''Magdal''ene and in Palestinian Arabic as ''Majdala'', which turned ''a'' in unstressed closed syllables into ''i''.

Typically, Hebrew אל ''-ʼēl'' was adapted as ـايل ''-īl'', and Hebrew יה ''-yāh'' as ـيا ''-yāʼ''.

== Hebræo-English names ==
[[James I of England]] commissioned a [[translation]] of the Christian Bible from the original languages, including a translation of the Tanakh or Old Testament from Hebrew into English. This became known as the  [[King James Version of the Bible]], often referred to today by the abbreviation "KJV." 

Even so, many KJV Old Testament names were not entirely without New Testament Greek influence. This influence mostly reflected the vowels of names, leaving most of the consonants largely intact, only modestly filtered to consonants of contemporary English phonology. However, all KJV names followed the Greek convention of not distinguishing between soft and ''dāḡeš'' forms of ב ''bêṯ''.  These habits resulted in multilingually fused Hebræo-Helleno-English names, such as [[Judah (son of Jacob)|Judah]], [[Isaiah]] and [[Jeremiah]]. Additionally, a handful of names were adapted directly from Greek without even partial translations from Hebrew, including names such as [[Isaac]], [[Moses]] and [[Jesse]].

Along with names from the KJV edition of the New Testament, these names constitute the large part of Hebrew names as they exist in the English-speaking world.

'''José Jaime Maussan Flota''' (born May 31, 1953) is a [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[journalist]], television personality and [[Ufology|ufologist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=US/Mexico Business |year=1997 |publisher=Hemisphere Publishers' Group |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8cG2AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Jaime+Maussan%22&amp;dq=%22Jaime+Maussan%22&amp;num=100&amp;pgis=1 |accessdate=2008-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.miamialum.org/s/916/16/interior.aspx?sid=916&amp;gid=1&amp;page_id=61&amp;pgid=253&amp;cid=645&amp;ecid=21703&amp;search=Jaime%20Maussan&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Jaime Maussan studied journalism at [[UNAM]] and [[Miami University]] in [[Ohio]], [[United States]].

Since 1970 he has been a reporter at various newspapers and broadcasting outlets, among them [[Organización Editorial Mexicana|El Sol de México]], [[XEX-AM|XEX Radio]] and with [[Televisa]], he worked at  24 Horas newscast. With Televisa he was a correspondent at the United States and a general assignment reporter for the ''Domingo a Domingo'' (Sunday to Sunday) program hosted by [[Jacobo Zabludovsky]]. He also produced stories for the Sunday show.

In June 1990 he received a Global 500 award from [[Mostafa Kamal Tolba]] Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.global500.org/index.php/thelaureates/online-directory/item/449-jose-jaime-flota&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 Jaime Maussan broke records at  Mexican Television next to [[Nino Canun]] and his program ''Y usted que opina?'', since they transmitted for over 11 hours and a half on the subject of UFOs.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Maussan, in June 2017, was involved in the analysis of 5 [[mummies]] discovered in [[Peru]] at the region where the UNESCO World Heritage [[Nazca Lines]] site is located. The images of these findings were initially aired in a documentary sponsored by [[Gaia, Inc.]] and it allegedly shows a crouched mummified body of a humanoid figure with an elongated skull and three fingers on each hand and foot.)

== Education ==

* [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] (1972–73)
* Graduated from [[Miami University]] with a B.A. in Radio and Television (1974–1976).

==Controversy==
[[Snopes]] reported that Maussan "led an event called Be Witness, at which a mummified body — purportedly that of an alien — was unveiled. Later, though, that 'alien' discovery was debunked. The mummified corpse was shown to be that of a human child.".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.snopes.com/alien-mummy-peru/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=November 2009}}
The '''Jewish name''' has historically varied, encompassing throughout the centuries several different traditions.  This article looks at the [[Onomastics|onomastics practices]] of the Jewish people, that is, the history of the origin and forms of proper names.

Jews have historically used Hebrew [[patronymic]] names. In the Jewish patronymic system the first name is followed by either ben- or bat- ("son of" and "daughter of," respectively), and then the father's name. (Bar-, "son of" in Aramaic, is also seen). Permanent family surnames exist today but only gained popularity among Sephardic Jews in Iberia and elsewhere as early as the 10th or 11th century and did not spread widely to the Ashkenazic Jews of Germany or Eastern Europe until the 18th and 19th century, where the adoption of German surnames was imposed in exchange for Jewish emancipation. An exception was members of the Cohanim (priestly caste) and Levites (descendants of Levi) who performed certain religious duties, who had always appended the surname Cohen and Levi respectively (modern spelling in English may vary) which was usually preceded by "ha" meaning "the" in Hebrew.

Although Ashkenazi Jews now use European or modern-Hebrew surnames for everyday life, the Hebrew patronymic form is still used in Jewish religious and cultural life. It is used in synagogue and in documents in Jewish law such as the ketubah (marriage contract).

== Early Biblical Era ==
The name conferred upon a person in early Biblical times was generally connected with some circumstance of that person's birth—several of [[Jacob]]'s sons are recorded as having received their names in this manner ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 30). Generally, it was the mother who chose the name, as in the case of Jacob's sons, but there were occasions on which the father chose the child's name, such as in Genesis 16:15, 17:19, and 21:2.  Occasionally, persons other than the parents were the name-givers, as in the cases of [[Moses]] ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 2:10) and [[Solomon]] ([[II Samuel]] 12:25).

It appears to have been the custom in early Biblical times to confer a name immediately upon birth, but in later periods a name was given to a boy at circumcision (compare Luke 1:59 to 2:21). Before the [[Babylonian exile]], it was not common practice to name children after their relatives, even in the royal family—none of the twenty-one kings of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] was named after a predecessor, or after [[David]], the founder of the dynasty. On the other hand, a son of [[David and Jonathan|Jonathan]] and of [[Saul the King|King Saul]] were each named [[Meribaal]] (II Samuel 21:7 and following). Instead of repeating the exact name of an ancestor, however, it was customary to make use of one of the elements of the family name. Thus, [[Ahitub]] has two sons, [[Ahijah]] and [[Ahimelech]]. Three of Saul's family members have the element ''ba'al'' (in the altered form ''bosheth'') in their names. As a consequence of this avoidance of repetition, a single name was as a rule sufficient to identify a person. It became traditional to identify a son by his father's name and a chosen name, like [[Jaazaniah|Jaazaniah ben Shaphan]] ([[Ezekiel]] 8:11) only in later years of Hebrew history.

=== Significance ===

It is probable that, as in other ancient societies, a name carried spiritual significance.&lt;ref&gt;Frazer, "Golden Bough", 2d ed., i. 404 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; A large majority of the 2,800 personal names found in the Hebrew Bible (shared among about 15,000 persons) convey a specific meaning. The meanings of the remainder have been obscured either through textual corruption or insufficient current understanding of comparative philology.  In addition, a considerable number of these names are probably [[eponym]]s. There is little doubt that this applies to the names of the [[Israelite]] clans, each of which was assumed to be descended from the descendants of Jacob, described in [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 26.

Names may be derived from the order of birth, as in the cases of [[Akkub]] and Jacob, whose names probably mean "posthumous."  [[Jephthah]] implies "first-born", as does [[Becher (biblical)|Becher]], while names like [[Manasseh (tribal patriarch)|Manasseh]], [[Nahum]], and [[Nehemiah]] refer probably to children who have come to take the place of others that have died in childhood. The idea of relationship is expressed in [[Ahab]], probably originally [[Ahiab]] (Jeremiah 29:21).

Personal peculiarities may give rise to a name, as [[Laban (Bible)|Laban]] ("white", or "blond"), [[Gideon]] ("maimed"), or [[Harim]] ("with pierced nose"). Personality may be referred to, as in the names [[Job (Biblical figure)|Job]] ("assailant") and [[Barak]] ("lightning"). There are no occupational names in the Bible corresponding to Anglo-Saxon names like [[Smith (surname)|Smith]] of England or [[Müller (surname)|Müller]] of Germany, but names taken from objects are found, especially among females. The name [[Rebecca]] (''Rivka'') seems to be derived from a sheep-rope, [[Peninnah]] from [[pearl]], and [[Keren-happuch]] from a box of face-paint. Abstract names seem to have been given primarily to women, such as [[Manoah]] ("rest") and [[Michal]] ("power").

Jacobs gives eighty-four names (applied to 120 different persons) derived from animals and plants.&lt;ref&gt;"Studies in Biblical Archeology", pp. 94–100&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leah]] is generally known as a word for cow, and [[Rachel]] for [[domestic sheep|ewe]] (appropriate since both are considered [[Matriarchs (Bible)|matriarchs]]). [[Oreb]] ("[[raven]]") and [[Ze'ev]] ("[[wolf]]") were princes of the [[Midianites]] (although Ze'ev was also an appellation of [[Benjamin]]), and [[Caleb]] ("the dog") was the founder of the chief Judean [[tribe]]. [[Achbor]] ("[[mouse]]") and [[Shaphan]] ("[[rabbit|coney]]") also occur. [[Jonah]] is the equivalent of "[[dove]]", [[Zipporah]] of "bird", and [[Deborah]] of "[[bee]]."  [[Esther]]'s Jewish name, [[Hadassah]], means "[[Myrtus|myrtle]]."  Citing these animal-inspired names, Robertson Smith and others have attempted to find evidence of [[totemism]] among the ancient [[Hebrews]].

Other Jewish names taken from animals include Ari (lion), Ariel means ("God is my lion"), Dov (bear), and Tzvi or Zvi (deer).

=== Compound names ===

A distinctive characteristic of Bible onomastics is the frequency of composite names, which form at times even complete sentences, as in the case of [[Isaiah]]'s son [[Shear-jashub]] ("the remnant shall return") and [[Hephzibah]] ("my pleasure is in her"). Sometimes these composites have a preposition as their first element, as Bishlam (= "with peace"; [[Book of Ezra|Ezra]] 4:7) and [[Lemuel (disambiguation)|Lemuel]] ("belonging to God"; [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 31:4); but in the majority of cases these composite names are theophorous, referring to, or actually mentioning, the Deity, either by the name of [[YHWH]] or by the name of [[El (god)|El]]. The specific name of the Hebrew God appears at the beginning as ''Jo-'' and at the end as ''-iah''; thus, ''Jonathan'' is a doublet of ''[[Elnathan]]'', and ''[[Joezer]]'' ("YHWH is help") is the same as ''[[Joazar]]'' ("YHWH has helped"). A whole [[theology]] may be deduced from the large number of Biblical names referring to acts, actions, and attributes of the deity; thus: YHWH "gives" (Elnathan, [[Jonathan (name)|Jonathan]], [[Nathaniel]]); "increases the family" ([[Eliasaph]], [[Joseph (given name)|Joseph]]); "is gracious" (Elhanan, [[Hananeel]], [[John (given name)|John]], [[Hananiah (disambiguation)|Hananiah]]); "has mercy" ([[Jerahmeel]]); "blesses" ([[Barachel (disambiguation)|Barachel]], [[Berechiah]]); "loves" ([[Jedidiah]], [[Eldad]]); "helps" ([[Eleazar]], [[Azareel]], [[Azariah (disambiguation)|Azariah]]); "benefits" ([[Gamaliel]]); "holds fast" ([[Jehoahaz (disambiguation)|Jehoahaz]], [[Ahaziah]]); "is strong" ([[Uzziel]], [[Azaziah]], [[Uzziah]]); "delivers" ([[Elpalet]], Eliphalet); "comforts" (Nehemiah); "heals" ([[Rephael]]); "conceals" ([[Elzaphan]], [[Zephaniah]]); "establishes" ([[Eliakim (Bible)|Eliakim]], [[Jehoiakim]]); "knows" ([[Eliada]], [[Jehoiada]]); "remembers" ([[Zechariah (given name)|Zechariah]]); "sees" ([[Hazael]], [[Jahaziel]]); "hears" (Elishama, Hoshama); "answers" (Anaiah, Ananiah, Janai); "speaks" ([[Amariah]]); "is praised" ([[Jehaleel]]); "is asked" ([[Shealtiel]]); "comes" ([[Eliathah]]); "lives" ([[Jehiel]]); "exalts/uplifts" ([[Jeremiah]]); "thunders" ([[Raamiah]]; [[Book of Nehemiah|Nehemiah]] 7:7); "gladdens" ([[Jahdiel]], [[Jehdeiah]]); "judges" ([[Elishaphat]], [[Jehoshaphat]], [[Shephatiah]], [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]]); "is just" ([[Jehozadak]], [[Zedekiah]]); "is king" ([[Elimelech]], [[Malchiel]]); "is lord" ([[Bealiah]]); "is great" ([[Gedaliah]]); "is perfect" ([[Jotham]]); "is high" ([[Jehoram (disambiguation)|Jehoram]]); "is glorious" ([[Jochebed]]); "is incomparable" ([[Michael (archangel)|Michael]], literally "who is like God?")

Besides these distinct names of God other divine names are used, as ''[[Adonai|Adoni]]'' in [[Adoniram]], and ''Melech'' in [[Nathan-melech]] and [[Ebed-melech]], and [[Baal]] in [[Eshbaal|Esh-baal]] (changed for special reasons to [[Ishbosheth]]). In some cases names of relationship seem to be used as applied to the Deity (compare [[Abiel]], [[Abijah]], and [[Abimelech]], signifying in each case the fatherhood of God), and in this way [[Abinadab]] would correspond to [[Jehonadab]] and [[Abiezer]] to [[Eliezer]]. The same applies to the elements ''aḥ-'' ("brother") and ''amm-'' ("uncle"). As, however, some of these words are applied to families, not individuals, the whole must be taken as a sentence: [[Avihud]] means "my father is glorious" (referring to God). On the same principle it must be assumed that some verbal names are theophorous, and refer to the action of the Deity, [[Nathan (given name)|Nathan]] being the abbreviation of [[Elnathan]] ("God gives"), [[Shaphat]] of [[Jehoshaphat]] ("God judges"). Thus [[Ahaz]] appears in a form corresponding to [[Jehoahaz (disambiguation)|Jehoahaz]] in an inscription of [[Tiglath-Pileser III]]. Many of the theophorous endings are contracted into ''-a'', ''-i'', or ''-ai'', as in [[Shebna]], [[Hosa (surname)|Hosa]], [[Talti]], and [[Shemai]]. A few names are adjectival, and may contain references to the Deity: [[Baruch (given name)|Baruch]] ("blessed"), [[David]] ("beloved"), [[Amos (disambiguation)|Amos]] ("strong"). Some names have grammatical endings which it is difficult to interpret, as ''-oth'' in [[Shelomoth]]; the final ''-i'' in [[Omri]] and [[Barzilai]] probably refers to a tribal origin. Many names ending in ''-on'' are animal-names, as [[Ephron]] ("small [[deer]]"), [[Nahshon]] ("small [[snake|serpent]]"); compare [[Samson]] ("small sun").

=== Post-Exilic names ===

After the Exile to Babylon there appeared a tendency toward the use of foreign names, the literal significance of which was disregarded, and this tendency became more and more prominent as time went on. Biblical names ending in ''-a'' (as in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah) are [[Aramaic]]. [[Shamsherai]] ([[I Chronicles]] 8:26), while [[Mordecai]] is probably derived from [[Marduk]], or may be derived from "pure myrrh"), as are [[Belteshazzar]] (Daniel 10:1), [[Shenazar]] (I Chronicles 3:18), and [[Sheshbazzar]] (Ezra 1:8) from other deities. There is in this period a tendency also toward descriptive and adjectival names with the definite article prefixed, which easily gave rise to such surnames as [[Hakkaz]], [[Hakkatan]], and [[Hallosheth]] (Ezra 2:61; 8:12; Nehemiah 3:12; compare the form ''ha-Kohelet'' ([[Ecclesiastes]] 12:8, in the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]). In the [[Hellenistic period]] [[Greek language|Greek]] names became quite usual among the Jews, especially those of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]], [[Jason]], and [[Antigonid dynasty|Antigonus]]. Even the name of a god like [[Apollo]] occurs ([[Book of Acts|Acts]] 18:24). Other names are [[Apollonius (given name)|Apollonius]], [[Hyrcanus]], [[Lysimachus]], [[Demetrius]], [[Dosa (name)|Dosa]], Nicanor, Pappus, [[Patroclus]], [[Philo]], [[Sosa (surname)|Sosa]], [[Symmachus (disambiguation)|Symmachus]], [[Tryphon]], [[Zeno (disambiguation)|Zeno]]. The same occurs among women, as Alexandra and Priscilla. [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] names also occur, as [[Antonius]], [[Apella]], [[Drusus (cognomen)|Drusus]], [[Justinus (disambiguation)|Justinus]], [[Justus]], [[Marcus (name)|Marcus]], [[Rufus (disambiguation)|Rufus]], [[Tiberius]], and [[Titus]]. It was during this period that the practice arose of giving a son the name of his grandfather, as was done in the [[Kohen Gadol|high-priestly]] family, the members of which were named alternately [[Onias (disambiguation)|Onias]] and [[Simon (given name)|Simon]] from 332 to 165 BCE. Similarly, a little later, in the family of the [[Hillel the Elder|Hillelites]], the names [[Gamaliel]] and Judah succeed each other with only an occasional occurrence of Simon and Hillel. Toward the end of the period, owing to the intermixture of foreign languages, the use of double names for the same person began to be adopted, as in the instances of [[Simon Peter]], [[John Mark]], [[Thomas Didymus]], [[Herodes Agrippa]], and [[Salome Alexandra]].

=== Talmudic period ===

Among the names in the [[Talmud]] there is a considerable proportion of Greek ones. A large number also are Aramaic, ending in ''-a'' or ''-ai'': Abba, Huna, and Papa are instances of the former. Even Bible names were transformed in this direction——Ḥanina instead of Hananiah, Abuya instead of Abijah; while others were shortened, as [[Eleazar|Lazar]] (for [[Eleazar]]). Many Biblical names received renewed popularity owing to the distinction of their bearers, as those of [[Gamaliel]], Hillel, and [[Ulla (disambiguation)|Ulla]]. The tendency toward double names existed here, as Sarah Miriam, Johanan Joseph,&lt;ref&gt;[[Gittin|Giṭ.]] 34b&lt;/ref&gt; and Mahaliel Judah.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yoma]] 52b&lt;/ref&gt; Converts to Judaism, like [[Aquila of Sinope|Aquila]], [[Monobaz II|Monabaz]], and [[Helena of Adiabene|Helena]], retained their pagan names (as was the custom also in the early [[Christian Church]]). There was some objection to foreign names among the Jews of this period,&lt;ref&gt;[[Numeri Rabbah|Num. R.]]&lt;/ref&gt; yet legend declares that the high priest Simon promised Alexander the Great that all the children of priestly families born in the year following his visit to [[Jerusalem]] would be named Alexander, after him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yosippon]], folio 87&lt;/ref&gt;

In the adoption of double names during this early period an attempt was made to translate the Hebrew terms into corresponding Greek, as ''Ariston'' for ''Tobi'', ''Boethus'' for ''Ezra'', ''Justus'' for ''[[Zadok]]'', ''Philo'' for ''Jedidah'', ''Theodorus'' for ''Nethaneel'', and ''Zosimus'' for ''Ḥayyim''.

It was somewhat rare for the same name to be used by both sexes. In Biblical times this occurs with regard to the names ''Abigail'', ''Abijah'', ''Athaliah'', ''Chushan'', ''Ephah'', ''Micha'', ''Nahash'', ''Shelomith'', ''Zibiah''; in Talmudic times, with regard to ''Ibu'', ''Johanan'', ''Nehorai'', ''Pasi'', ''Shalom''; the only later instances that may be cited are ''Jeroham'', ''Mazal-Ṭob'', ''Neḥamah'', ''Menuḥah'', ''Simḥah'', ''Tamar'', ''Bongodas'', and ''Bien-li-Viengue''. To wear a man's name seemed as objectionable as wearing men's clothes.

It was already noticed in Talmudic times that the use of family names had died out.&lt;ref&gt;Giṭ. 88a&lt;/ref&gt; The name of [[Rabbi Meïr]] was said to be derived from an experience at school which was regarded as being of good omen.&lt;ref&gt;[[Moed|Eruvin]] 13b&lt;/ref&gt; It is recommended not to name a child after enemies of the Jews, like [[Sisera]] and [[Pharaoh]], but to use the names of the Patriarchs (i.e. [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Yoma]] 36b&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-Talmudic period ===

As the Jews spread throughout the lands bordering the Mediterranean, they drew upon other languages for their personal names while still retaining Biblical ones, and they were especially prone to adopt names ending in ''-el''. These new names became exceptionally popular in Italy. To this source must be traced the new name ''Ḥushiel'', composed on the same plan as the Biblical ones ending in ''-el''. The kings of the [[Khazars]], so far as their names are known, wavered between pure Biblical names, like [[Obadiah]], and local names, like ''Bulan''. The [[Karaite (Jewish sect)|Karaites]] in the same neighborhood adopted [[Tatar]] names, one of them being known as [[Toktamish]]; but elsewhere Karaite names are mostly Arabic and [[Persian language|Persian]].

The custom of calling one of the sons, generally the eldest, after the paternal (sometimes the maternal) grandfather, of which only nine instances are known during the Talmudic period, became more popular, especially in European states. [[Maimonides]]' grandfather was ''Joseph ben Isaac ben Joseph ben Obadiah ben Solomon ben Obadiah'', for instance, and certain families seem to have similarly confined themselves to a few chosen names. Thus, in the [[Kalonymus]] family there occurs ''Meshullam b. Moses b. Ithiel b. Moses b. Kalonymus b. Meshullam b. Kalonymus b. Moses b. Kalonymus b. Jekuthiel b. Moses b. Meshullam b. Ithiel b. Meshullam''—only five names among fourteen persons throughout three centuries. As a consequence certain names became characteristic of certain districts: ''Japheth'' and ''Caleb'' in Greece, and hence among the Karaites; ''Kalonymus'' in south Italy; ''Sheshet'' and ''Joab'' in Rome; ''Sinai'' and ''Pesaḥ'' in Germany. Some of the older names were revived—''Meïr'', for example, of which only two previous instances before, had been known, the [[tanna Meïr]] and the Meïr mentioned by [[Josephus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[History of the Jewish War|BJ]]vi. 5, § 1&lt;/ref&gt; ''Samson'' was never used by Jews before the 11th century.

==== ''Kinnuyim'' ====
{{main|kinnuy}}
The most striking tendency of the post-Talmudic period is the general choice of local names by the Jews for their civic relations. This led to the adoption of two names, one for civic purposes, known as the ''[[kinnuy]]'' (probably from the Arabic ''kunyah''), the other (''shem ha-ḳodesh'') for use in the [[synagogue]] and in all Hebrew documents. The latter, the "sacred" name, was as far as possible associated with the former, and was often a translation of a civic one, e.g., ''Asael'' for ''Diofatto'', ''Manoah'' for ''Tranquillo'', ''Ḥayyim'' for ''Vita''; at times the civic name was merely a contraction of the sacred one, e.g., ''Leser'' for ''Eliezer'', ''Sender'' for ''Alexander''. In other cases mere similarity in sound was sufficient to determine the sacred name, as ''Mann'' for ''Menahem'', ''Kalman'' for ''Kalonymus'', and the like. Especially noteworthy was the use made of Jacob's blessing to transfer a personal name from the civic to the sacred sphere. Judah being compared to a [[lion]]'s whelp in Jacob's blessing, ''Judah'' became ''Leo'', or ''Löwe'', in lay relationship, and ''Ephraim'' became ''Fischlin''. Later on these name-equations became so usual that they formed doublets, which were almost invariably found together, as ''Dov Bär'', ''Naphtali Hirsch'', ''Solomon Zalman'', ''Judah'' or ''Aryeh Löb'', ''Binyamin Wolf'', and these again gave currency to similar correlative names, as ''Uri Phoebus''.

=== Titular abbreviations ===

It was during the [[Middle Ages]] that the somewhat curious custom arose of combining the abbreviation of a title with the initials of a name to form a single personal name. This almost invariably implies frequency of mention, and, therefore, celebrity. The best-known examples are those of '''[[Rashi|RaSHI]]''' and '''[[Rambam|RaMBaM]]''', who are hardly ever quoted in rabbinical texts except by these names; but there exists a large number of similar contractions.&lt;ref&gt;For a fuller list see Händler's list of abbreviations in Dalman's ''Talmudisches Wörterbuch.''&lt;/ref&gt;

A somewhat similar use of a title is the combination with ''Messer'', as in the Italian ''Messer Leon'', while in [[Provence]] the honorary prefixes ''en-'', for men, and ''na-'', for women, are combined with the name to form ''Engusek'' (En-Joseph), ''Nabona'', etc.

Apart from these tendencies, the general trend of nomenclature among Jews in the Middle Ages was to adopt that of the countries in which they lived, the given names being often identical with those of the surrounding peoples, and other means of identification being derived mainly from localities or offices. Certain peculiarities of various countries may be taken separately.

=== Mizrahim ===

Among the [[Mizrahim]] (Arabic-speaking [[Jews]] living in the [[Middle-East]]) it was quite common to replace their [[Hebrew]] names with relevant Arabic ones, whenever they bore a religious note and were deemed sacred to both [[Jews]] and [[Muslims]], so [[Abraham]] turned into [[Ibrahim (name)|Ibrahim]], [[Aharon (given name)|Aharon]] into [[Haroun]], [[David]] into [[Daoud (disambiguation)|Daoud]], [[Moshe]] into [[Moussa]], and [[Shlomo]] into [[Soliman (disambiguation)|Soliman]] and [[Salman (name)|Salman]].

The indication of a family's elevated religious status, which also gained its members the reverence of their non-Jewish neighbors, was expressed in Arabic through their name. One has to note that such names were often given by the surrounding non-Jewish communities, who confused the appropriate religious terms of the [[Halakhah]]. An example of this is the name [[Nader (disambiguation)|Nader]], which is the Arabic translation of [[Nazir (disambiguation)|Nazir]]: the Hebrew root word [[neizer]] (pronounced nay-zeer) means delineation or designation, and refers to the status of [[nezirut]] in which a person makes a vow to isolate himself from certain matters, such as intoxicating beverages, and other material luxuries (the absence of which would deaden his cravings for physical pleasures, as well as enhance his spiritual sensitivity and further his quest to attain spiritual heightenings), as well as things that are considered being [[tamea]] (spiritually unclean, such as corpses). Yet in the Arabic environment a family of [[Cohanim]] (descendents of [[Aaron]] and priests of the [[Beit haMiqdash]]), would often be described as such through the name [[Nazir (disambiguation)|Nazir]], or [[Nader (disambiguation)|Nader]]. The obvious reason behind the wrong usage of the term [[Nazir (disambiguation)|Nazir]] and its attribution to [[Cohanim]], is the fact that the [[Mizrahi Cohanim]] had always strictly adhered to the relevant [[Halachic Laws]] which entail that they avoid coming into contact with corpses, lest they lose their [[status of purity]], and which is similar to the rules that govern the status of [[nazarites]], as well as their perception amongst their surrounding Arab neighbors, especially the [[Coptic Christians]], as being consecrated (vowed) to the religious service of the [[Beit haMiqdash]].

Personal peculiarities also gave rise to a Jew's name in the Arab world, as [[Abyad]] referred to fair skin, [[Afia (disambiguation)|Afia]] possessor of strength, health or well being, [[Tawil]] to a tall person.

It was also quite usual that Hebrew names were translated into their corresponding meaning in the Arabic language, such as [[Adin]] into [[Latif (disambiguation)|Latif]], or [[Loutfi]], [[Eleazar]] into [[Mansour]], [[Gershom]] into [[Ghareeb]], [[Mazliach]] into [[Maimun (disambiguation)|Maimun]], [[Sameah]] into [[Said]], and [[Tovia]] into [[Hassan (surname)|Hassan]], or [[Hassoun]].

Common segments of [[Mizrahi]] society adopted local Arabic names, such as [[Abdallah]], [[Abdela]], [[Abdo (disambiguation)|Abdo]] and [[Aboudi]] (all meaning servant of the Lord), [[Farag]] (relief), [[Massoud]] (fortunate), [[Mourad (disambiguation)|Mourad]] (aspired to), [[Nessim]] (fresh breeze), [[Sabah]] (morning), [[Sahl (disambiguation)|Sahl]] (ease), [[Salama (disambiguation)|Salama]], [[Salem (name)|Salem]] and [[Selim (disambiguation)|Selim]] (all meaning unharmed), [[Zaki (disambiguation)|Zaki]] (well-smelling), because of their beautiful meanings, or the good fortune they seemed to evoke.

As had been the case within the [[Ashkenazi]] ([[Ashkenazi|Central and East European Jewish]]) cultural environment, [[Mizrahim]] bore names that related to their trades and occupations, such as [[Albaz]] (also [[Elbaz]], [[Elvas (disambiguation)|Elvas]] meaning falconer), [[Aboutboul]] ([[Abitbol]], [[Botbol]] all meaning drummer, drum maker, or seller), [[Hayek]] and [[Khayat]] (which both mean tailor), [[Hakim (title)|Hakim]] (physician, or sage), [[Naggar]] (carpenter), [[Sabbagh (disambiguation)|Sabbagh]] (dyer of cloth), [[Sabban]] (soap maker), [[Sannoua]] (labourer), [[Sarrouf]] or ''assaraf'' (money changer), [[Shenhav]] (also [[Chenhav]], [[Shenhavy]], [[Chenhavy]]) all referring to ivory and mean ivory craftsman or trader. Yemenite Jewish names were often adopted by place names such as Tzanani (from [[Sana'a]]), Taeizi (from [[Taiz]]), Harazi (from [[Jabal Haraz]]), and Damari (from [[Dhamar, Yemen|Dhamar]]). Other family names indicate pre-Islamic Jewish origin such as Kahalani ([[Kahlan]]) and Chorath ([[Bnei Chorath]]). Additionally, some Yemenite Jewish was related to their occupation such as Tabib/Taviv (doctor) and Qafih (poet).

[[Mizrahim]] sought to avert the [[ein ha raa]] (evil eye) and envy by never calling the dearest of their children (especially, the firstborn son) by the real name. In their quest to protect a child, parents would even revert to such drastic measures as giving it a very unattractive nickname, such as [[Garboua]] (the one who is clad in rags), which has later become a family name.

Contrary to [[Ashkenazim]], the [[Mizrahim]] applied the rulings of [[Talmud Shabbat 134]], which provides that a child be called after a living relative. This led to the creation of another [[Mizrahi]] particularity, where a child could be named [[Sarah bat Sarah]], or [[Abraham ben Abraham]], which as per [[Ashkenazi customs]], would only have been applied to a [[Convert to Judaism|ger]] ([[gerim]] being convertites to [[Judaism]], and thus, deemed having become [[bnai brith]], that is to say [[Covenant (biblical)|children of the Covenant]], holding the status of children of the [[Patriarch Abraham]] and the [[Matriarch Sarah]]).

Name giving also served as a social welfare tool, whereby poor parents sought to secure the support of a benefactor for their child, by naming him after a wealthy relative or employer, who would show his acceptance to look after the welfare of the child by presenting it with a first set of clothing, and later on support him with marriage expenses and the like.

The [[Mizrahim]] also reverted to this measure, as a means to strengthening the family ties between a married woman and her blood relatives, whereby a newly born child would be named after the elder of the mother's family, or one of its notables, and thus, retain his material benevolence, as well as underline the husband's expressed will to align himself to his spouse's family and gain their goodwill, or at least not to estrange his wife from her roots.

A peculiarity of the Arabic onomatology is the [[kunyah]], the by-name given to a father after the birth of his son, by which he is named after the latter (Abou, Abo, or Abu followed by the name of his son). It may be added here that [[Jonah ibn Janah|Abu al-Walid]] is a [[kunyah]] or by-name for [[Jonah]]. [[Abu (disambiguation)|Abu]] also forms family names, as in the case of [[Abudarham]], or [[Aboab]]. Here it has to be noted, that the word [[Abou]] was sometimes used in the sense of "owner", especially when it was followed by an object that was of importance to the manner in which the surrounding community perceived the person in question. The most prominent example for this is [[Abou Hassira]] (owner of a straw mat), a descendant of a long line of kabbalists and pietists from Morocco (born 1807 in Morocco, died 1880 in Egypt, buried in the village of Demitiouh, near Damanhour, in the Governorate of Beheira), whose real name [[Yaccov Ben Massoud]] has almost been forgotten, as he has become identified as [[Rabbi Abou Hassira]] since his pilgrimage from his homeland to Jerusalem, during which the boat he was on sank, yet he was miraculously saved because he hung on to his straw mat (hassira), which had been his only possession. For this the Egyptian population venerated him from that day on as a holy man and miracle worker, whose life had been protected by the Lord through a frail mat.

Akin to this is the use of the Arabic [[Patronymic#Arabic|Ibn]] which is relaten to Hebraic ''ben'' like in ''benjamin'' or ben yamin, (meaning son of, also spelled [[Aben (disambiguation)|Aben]], [[Aven (disambiguation)|Aven]], [[Avin (disambiguation)|Avin]]) to form a family name amongst [[Mizrahim]] who lived in the Eastern part of the Arab world. Among the best known of this formation are [[Ibn Aknin]], [[Ibn Danan]] (hence [[Abendana]]), [[Ibn Latif]], [[Ibn Migas]], [[Ibn Verga]]. Those [[Jews]] who lived in the [[North Africa]] countries (especially Morocco) chose the use of the  word [[O or sometimes spelled "U"]] (belonging to), which created the names [[Ou'Hanna]], (son of Hanna, also spelled [[Bohana]], [[Abuhana]], [[Abuhenna]]), [[O'Hayon]] (son of Life), [[O'Knine]] (son of Yacob, also spelled [[Waknin]], [[Ouaknin]]).

The Arabic article ''al'' appears in quite a number of names, as in ''Al-Ḥarisi''. Other names of interest, given by Steinschneider in a long list of eight hundred Arabic names in the ''Jewish Quarterly Review'' (ix. -xiii.), are ''Ghayyat'' (in Spanish ''Gayet''), ''Ibn Danan'' and ''Ibn al-Dayyal'', ''Al-Haruni'' ("the Aaronide", the same as ''Cohen''), ''Ibn Waḳar'', ''Ibn Zabara'' and ''Ibn Zimra'', ''Ḥaji'' (applied to Karaites who had performed the pilgrimage to Jerusalem), ''Yaḥya'' (equivalent to ''John'' or ''Judah''). ''Morel'' is said to be derived from ''Samuel''; ''Molko'' means "royal"; ''Mas'ud'' is equivalent to ''Baruch''; ''Muḳattil'' ("champion") would be a proper origin for the family name ''Mocatta''; ''Najar'' and ''Najara'' refer to carpentry; ''Sasun'' is merely a transcript of ''[[Sason]]'' ("[[lily]]"). The proper names ''[[Sa‘id]]'', ''[[Saad]]'', and ''Sa'dan'' are equally popular among Jews and Arabs. ''[[Abbas (disambiguation)|Abbas]]'' ("lion") corresponds to ''Judah'', as ''Leo'' and the like in Europe.

Very many [[Judeo-Arabic]] names are compounded of'' 'abd'' ("servant"), as ''Abdallah'' and '''Abd al-Walid''. ''Al-Faraj'' occurs as the name of the translator at ''Girgenti'', and it is possibly the remote origin of the curious name of Admiral Farragut, whose grandfather came from [[Menorca]]. It is considered doubtful whether the name of the ''Ḳimḥis'' is Hebrew in that form, or whether it should be pronounced as an Arabic word, ''Ḳamḥi'' ("formed of wheat").

== Surname ==
{{Main|Jewish surname|Hebraization of surnames}}

Jews have historically used Hebrew patronymic names. In the Jewish patronymic system the first name is followed by either ben- or bat- ("son of" and "daughter of", respectively), and then the father's name. (Bar-, "son of" in Aramaic, is also seen). Permanent family surnames exist today but only gained popularity among Sephardic Jews in Iberia as early as the 10th or 11th century and did not spread widely to the Ashkenazic Jews of Germany or Eastern Europe until the late 18th and mid 19th century, when laws were passed mandating they adopt surnames. Thus, while many European and North American Jews now use European and German surnames for everyday life, the patronymic form is still used in Jewish religious and cultural life, and is common in [[Israel]]. It is used in synagogue and in documents in Jewish law such as the ketubah (marriage contract). Many Sephardic Jews used the Arabic ibn instead of bat or ben when it was the norm. The Spanish family Ibn Ezra is one example.

Many immigrants to modern Israel change their names to Hebrew names, to erase remnants of Diaspora life still surviving in family names from other languages. This is especially common among Ashkenazic Jews, because most of their European names do not go back far in history; surnames were imposed by the German and Austro-Hungarian Empires in the 18th century (explaining why many Ashkenazi Jews have German or European-sounding names).  The newly-assumed Hebrew names were sometimes based on phonetic similarity with their former (European) surname: Golda Meyersohn became [[Golda Meir]].

A popular form to create a new family names is the false patronymic, using the prefix "ben" or "bar" followed by words who are not the name of a parent. Examples include patriotic themes, such as ben Ami ("son of my people"), or ben Artzi ("son of my country"), and terms related to the Israeli landscape, such as bar Ilan ("son of the trees", also similar phonetically to [[Meir Bar-Ilan|the bearer]]'s original family name Berlin).  Another famous person who used a false patronymic is the first Israeli Prime Minister, [[David Ben-Gurion]]. His former family name was Grün, and he adopted the name "Ben-Gurion" ("son of Gurion"), not "Ben-Avigdor" (his father's name). Gurion was a Jewish leader in the period of the [[First Jewish–Roman War]].

== Change of name ==

Change of name was not an unusual occurrence in Biblical times, if one may judge by the instances occurring among the Patriarchs, and it seems to have been not altogether unknown in later times. Thus, Moses Benveniste mentions a certain Obadiah who wandered from Germany to [[Turkey]] in 1654 and changed his name to Moses because the former name was unusual.&lt;ref&gt;Responsa, i. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the Middle Ages a person who was dangerously sick would change his name in the hope that the [[Death (personification)#Death (angels) in religion|Angel of Death]], who summons persons by name, would be baffled thereby. This custom, known as ''meshanneh shem,'' is given in the Talmud&lt;ref&gt;[[Rosh Hashanah (Talmud)|R. H.]] 17a&lt;/ref&gt; and is mentioned by Judah Ḥasid.&lt;ref&gt;''Sefer Ḥasidim,'' No. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the names thus adopted was the appropriate one of ''Ḥayyim''.&lt;ref&gt;For the various forms of ''Ḥayyim'' see ''Jew. Encyc.'' vi. 271.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to prevent any misunderstanding at the resurrection the [[kabbalah|cabalists]] later recommended persons to learn a [[psalm]] the first and last verses of which began and ended with the first and last letters of their names. Particular care is to be taken in the writing of names in legal documents, the slightest error in which invalidates them. Hence there are quite a number of monographs on names, both personal and geographical, the first of which was that written by [[Simḥah Cohen]]; the best known is that of [[Samuel ben Phoebus]] and [[Ephraim Zalman Margulies]] entitled ''Ṭib Giṭṭin.''

== Superstitions ==

It was thought that Jews of the same name should not live in the same town or permit their children to marry into each other's families;&lt;ref&gt;''Sefer Ḥasidim,'' Nos. 24–34&lt;/ref&gt; this seems to have some reference to [[exogamy]].  It is even urged that one should not marry a woman of the same name as one's mother; or that she should be required to change it. Even to the present day it is considered unlucky in Russia for a father-in-law to have the same name as the bridegroom. In other parts of Russia it is considered bad luck to name a child after a living relative. When several children have died in a family the next that is born has no name given to it, but is referred to as "[[Alter (name)|Alter]]" ({{lang-yi|אלטער}}, literally "old"), or ''Alterke'', the view being that the Angel of Death, not knowing the name of the child, will not be able to seize it. When such a child attains the marriageable age, a new name, generally that of one of the Patriarchs, is given to it.  For a somewhat similar reason it is considered unlucky in [[Lithuania]] to call an only child by its true name.

== Pen-names ==

It was customary for well-known authors of [[medieval]] times to be known by the titles of their works rather than by their own names. Thus, [[Jacob ben Asher]] is referred to as the ''Ṭur'' or the ''Ba'al ha-Ṭurim''; [[Joseph Caro]] is known as the ''Bet Yosef''; and [[Ezekiel Landau]] as ''Noda' bi-Yehudah''; while even more frequently were authors known by contracted forms of their names, with the addition of some honorary prefix, as given above. Among contemporary Hebrew writers this practice is still more widely observed, though no honorary title is prefixed. A list is given by [[Moïse Schwab]] in his ''Repertoire''.&lt;ref&gt;Schwab, Moise.  ''Repertoire'' (Supplement, pp. 200-207)&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[Yiddish]] writers appear to prefer to write under some pen-name or pseudonym, and their example is at times followed by modern writers of Hebrew, though these, as a rule, prefer to give a name composed of their initials.
Of course, other Jewish writers besides the above have adopted pen-names. I. Zangwill has written under the names "[[J. Freeman Bell]]" (in collaboration), "Countess von S.", and "Marshallik"; Mrs. Frankau is known as "[[Frank Danby]]"; and so on; but there is nothing specifically Jewish about this adoption of a pen-name.

'''Jo Freeman''' (born August 26, 1945) is an American [[feminist]], [[political scientist]], writer and attorney. As a student at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in the 1960s, she became active in organizations working for [[civil liberties]] and the [[civil rights movement]]. She went on to do [[voter registration]] and [[community organization]] in [[Alabama]] and [[Mississippi]] and was an early organizer of the [[women's liberation movement]]. She authored several classic feminist articles as well as important papers on [[social movement]]s and political parties. She has also written extensively about women, particularly on law and [[public policy]] toward women and women in mainstream politics.

== Early life and education ==
She was born in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] in 1945. Her mother Helen was from [[Hamilton, Alabama]], and had served during World War II as a first lieutenant in the [[Women's Army Corps]], stationed in England. Soon after Jo's birth she moved to Los Angeles, California where she taught junior high school until shortly before her death from emphysema. Freeman attended [[Birmingham High School]], but graduated in the first class of [[Granada Hills High School]] in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, ''At Berkeley in the Sixties'', pp. 1–5.&lt;/ref&gt; She received her BA with honors in political science from UC Berkeley in 1965. She began her graduate work in political science at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1968 and completed her PhD in 1973. After four years of teaching at the State University of New York she went to Washington, DC as a [[Brookings Institute|Brookings Fellow]] and stayed another year as an [[American Political Science Association]] Congressional Fellow. She entered [[New York University School of Law]] in 1979 as a Root-Tilden Scholar and received her [[Juris Doctor|JD]] degree in 1982. She was admitted to the New York State Bar in 1983.&lt;ref name=SCAF&gt;Jennifer Scanlon, "Jo Freeman," ''Significant Contemporary American Feminists'', pp. 104–110.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Student activist at Berkeley ==
At Berkeley Freeman was active in the University [[Young Democrats of America|Young Democrats]] and the campus political party, [[SLATE]].&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, ''At Berkeley in the Sixties'', pp. 14–22, 29–33, 53.&lt;/ref&gt; SLATE worked to abolish nuclear testing, to eliminate the University's ban on controversial speakers, and to improve undergraduate education at Cal. It developed a guide to classes and professors entitled the ''SLATE Supplement to the General Catalog,'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.slatearchives.org/gs/HASH331a.dir/doc.xml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704123918/http://archive.slatearchives.org/gs/HASH331a.dir/doc.xml |archivedate=2008-07-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for which Freeman wrote reviews of professors and their courses.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, ''At Berkeley in the Sixties'', pp. 53–67.&lt;/ref&gt; One of SLATE's fundamental principles was that students should have the same rights to take stands on issues on campus that they had as citizens off campus. The University had restricted such activity since the 1930s. It became a major issue when the civil rights movement came to the Bay Area in the fall of 1963 because students wanted to support the movement on campus as well as off.

In the fall of 1964 the question was dramatized when student organizations set up tables on campus to solicit money and recruit students for off-campus political action in defiance of the ban. One person was arrested and several students were issued administrative citations. After a mass arrest was narrowly avoided by last minute negotiations with University president [[Clark Kerr]], the [[Free Speech Movement]] (FSM) was formed by the student groups to continue the struggle. Freeman represented the University Young Democrats on the FSM executive committee. After two months of fruitless negotiations, Freeman was one of "the 800" students who were arrested for sitting in at the main administration building on December 2–3, 1964. This was the biggest [[mass arrest]] in California history. The publicity it generated compelled the Regents of the University to change the rules so that students could pursue political issues on campus.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, ''At Berkeley in the Sixties'', p. 171, 193–198.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heirich, ''The Beginning: Berkeley, 1964''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Civil rights activist ==
When the civil rights movement came to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1963, it picketed local employers who didn't hire blacks. Demonstrations were organized at [[Lucky Stores|Lucky]] supermarket and [[Mel's Drive-In]] to get them to sign hiring agreements. Success here was followed by unsuccessful negotiations with San Francisco's most elegant hotels and several automobile dealers. Freeman was one of 167 demonstrators arrested at the Sheraton-Palace Hotel [https://web.archive.org/web/20110807131434/http://www.sfpalace.com/History] in March 1964, and one of 226 arrested at the [[Cadillac]] agency in April. She was acquitted in her first trial and convicted in her second, resulting in a fifteen-day jail sentence. Her second trial kept her from attending the 1964 [[Freedom Summer]] project in Mississippi. After it ended she hitchhiked &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jofreeman.com/photos/mfdp64.html The Civil Rights Vigil at the 1964 Democratic Convention]. Jofreeman.com (1964-04-26). Retrieved on 2015-04-18.&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[1964 Democratic National Convention]] in August in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]] to support the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]]'s petition to be seated in place of the all-white regular Mississippi delegation.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, ''At Berkeley in the Sixties'', pp. 84–126.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following graduation from UC Berkeley, Freeman joined the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]]'s (SCLC) summer project, SCOPE ([[SCOPE Project|Southern Community Organization and Political Education]]). When the summer was over, she joined the SCLC staff as a field worker. For the next year she did voter registration in Alabama and Mississippi, spending a few days in jail in both states. In August 1966, when she was working in [[Grenada, Mississippi]], the ''Jackson Daily News'' published an exposé of her work as a "professional agitator" on its editorial page,&lt;ref&gt;"Professional Agitator Hits All Major Trouble Spots," ''Jackson Daily News'', August 18, 1966, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; implying that she was a communist sympathizer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jofreeman.com/sixtiesprotest/clipping.htm Jackson Daily News : Jo Freeman Story-1966]. Jofreeman.com (1966-08-16). Retrieved on 2015-04-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Accompanied by five photographs, including one taken at Cal during the FSM, this made her a potential target for Mississippi death squads. Thirty years later a federal court order disclosed that these were provided to the newspaper by the [[Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission]]. An informant had documented Freeman's participation in the FSM and recognized her in Grenada. Concerned for her safety, SCLC sent Freeman back to Atlanta, where she worked in the main office and also as [[Coretta Scott King]]'s assistant for six weeks. In October she was sent to work with SCLC's Chicago project. As the SCLC 's Chicago project faded out, Freeman went to work for a community newspaper, the ''West Side TORCH''. When this job ended she tried to find jobs as a journalist and photographer in Chicago, where she was told that girls can't cover riots. Eventually she found work as a re-write editor for a trade magazine, later becoming a freelance writer.&lt;ref name="Scanlon pp. 104"&gt;Scanlon, "Jo Freeman," ''Significant Contemporary American Feminists'', pp. 104–110.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women's liberation activist and author ==
In June 1967 Freeman attended a "free school" course on women at the University of Chicago led by [[Heather Booth]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://jwa.org/feminism/_html/JWA004.htm Heather Booth | Jewish Women's Archive]. Jwa.org. Retrieved on 2015-04-18.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Naomi Weisstein]]. She invited them to organize a woman's workshop at the then-forthcoming [[National Conference of New Politics]] (NCNP), to be held over Labor Day weekend 1967 in Chicago. At that conference a woman's caucus was formed, and it (led by Freeman and [[Shulamith Firestone]]) tried to present its own demands to the plenary session.&lt;ref name="Hall2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Simon Hall|title=American Patriotism, American Protest: Social Movements Since the Sixties|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jhmQvhJMUagC&amp;pg=PA61|date=6 June 2011|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-0365-8|pages=61–}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the women were told their resolution was not important enough for a floor discussion, and when through threatening to tie up the convention with procedural motions they succeeded in having their statement tacked to the end of the agenda, it was never discussed.&lt;ref name="jofreeman.com"&gt;[http://www.jofreeman.com/socialmovements/origins.htm On the Origins of Social Movements]. Jofreeman.com. Retrieved on 2015-04-18.&lt;/ref&gt; When the National Conference for New Politics Director William F. Pepper refused to recognize any of the women waiting to speak and instead called on someone to speak about the American Indian, five women, including Firestone, rushed the podium to demand to know why.&lt;ref name="jofreeman.com"/&gt; But William F. Pepper patted Firestone on the head and said, "Move on little girl; we have more important issues to talk about here than women's liberation,"&lt;ref name="Hall2011"/&gt;{{Efn|[[Women's liberation movement]], a type of feminism}} or possibly, "Cool down, little girl. We have more important things to talk about than women's problems."&lt;ref name="Hall2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jofreeman.com"/&gt; Freeman and Firestone called a meeting of the women who had been at the "free school" course and the women's workshop at the conference; this became the first Chicago women's liberation group. It was known as the Westside group because it met weekly in Freeman's apartment on Chicago's west side. After a few months Freeman started a newsletter which she called ''Voice of the women's liberation movement.'' It circulated all over the country (and in a few foreign countries), giving the new movement its name. Many of the women in the Westside group went on to start other feminist organizations, including the [[Chicago Women's Liberation Union]].

In the fall of 1968 Freeman enrolled in graduate school in political science at the University of Chicago. However, she took courses outside the discipline which would give her an opportunity to explore the research on women, sex roles and related topics. Most of the term papers she wrote were later published in various magazines and in college textbooks. When consciousness about women at the University was raised by a sit-in prompted by the firing of a popular female professor, Freeman led efforts to examine women's experiences at the University and in academia. These included teaching a "free course" on the legal and economic position of women early in 1969, chairing the student subcommittee of the new Committee on University Women, and organizing a major campus conference on women the following fall.

At the annual meeting of the [[American Political Science Association]] (APSA) in 1969, she helped to found the Women's Caucus for Political Science, eventually serving as its treasurer for one year. She also served on APSA's Committee on the Status of Women.

As a result of her publications, Freeman was invited to speak at many other colleges and universities, mostly in the Midwest. She spent the summers of 1970 and 1971 hitchhiking through Europe distributing feminist literature. Her lecture at the [[University of Oslo]] in 1970 is credited for sparking its first new feminist group.&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Lønnå, "Møtet med Jo Freeman," ''Stolthet og Kvinnekamp: Norsk Kinnesakforenings Historie Fra 1913'', pp. 230–232.&lt;/ref&gt; The literature she distributed was also a boon to feminists in the [[Netherlands]].

Although Freeman had not been active in [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] politics since leaving California in 1965 (except for a brief stint on [[Eugene McCarthy]]'s 1968 Presidential campaign), she ran for delegate to the [[1972 Democratic National Convention]] in order to put [[Shirley Chisholm]]'s name on the ballot. She came in ninth out of 24 candidates in Chicago's first district and attended the convention as an alternate with the Chicago Challenge Delegation that unseated Mayor Daley's hand-picked slate. She later worked on California Senator [[Alan Cranston]]'s 1984 Presidential campaign and became active in Democratic Party politics in [[Brooklyn]], New York.&lt;ref name="Scanlon pp. 104"/&gt;

Freeman wrote four classic feminist papers under her movement name "Joreen", which analyzed her experiences in the women's liberation movement. The most widely known is ''[[The Tyranny of Structurelessness]],''&lt;ref&gt;''The Second Wave'', Vol. 2, No. 1 (1972); published under Jo Freeman's name in the ''Berkeley Journal of Sociology'', Vol. 17 (1972–73), pp. 151–165.&lt;/ref&gt; which argued there is no such thing as a structureless group; power is simply disguised and hidden when structure is unacknowledged. All groups and organizations need clear lines of responsibility for democratic accountability, a notion that underlies the theory of [[democratic structuring]]. Her 1969 [http://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/bitch.htm ''BITCH Manifesto''] is considered an early example of language reclamation by a social movement, as well as a celebration of non-traditional gender roles.&lt;ref&gt;Shulamith Firestone and Anne Koedt, ''Notes from the Second Year''.&lt;/ref&gt; A third article, ''Trashing: The Dark Side of Sisterhood,''&lt;ref&gt;''Ms.'', April 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; illuminated an aspect of the women's movement that many participants experienced but few wanted to discuss openly. ''The 51 Percent Minority Group: A Statistical Essay'' appeared in the 1970 anthology ''[[Sisterhood is Powerful: An Anthology of Writings From The Women's Liberation Movement]]'', edited by [[Robin Morgan]].&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Robin, ed., ''Sisterhood is Powerful: An Anthology of Writings From the Women's Liberation Movement'' (N.Y.: Random House, 1st ed. 1970), p. 37 ff. (crediting, in ''id.'', p. [v], the essay's first appearance to ''The Voice of The Women's Liberation Movement'').&lt;/ref&gt;

Freeman's 1973 dissertation analyzed the two branches of the women's movement, arguing that they were separated more by generation and experience than by ideology. What she called the "younger branch" was started by women with experience in civil rights, anti-war, and New Left student activism. The "older branch" was founded by women who had been members of or worked with the [[Presidential Commission on the Status of Women|President's Commission on the Status of Women]] and related state Commissions. The latter branch gave rise to such organizations as the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW) and the Women's Equity Action League (WEAL).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/women-s-equity-action-league Women's Equity Action League: Information from]. Answers.com. Retrieved on 2015-04-18.&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting book, ''The Politics of Women's Liberation'', was published in 1975 and won the APSA's prize for the best scholarly work on women in politics.&lt;ref name="Scanlon pp. 104"/&gt; Freeman wrote The Bitch Manfesto in fall of 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/bitch.htm|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;In this work, Freeman notes that women are labeled as a bitch in society based on three principles, their personality, orientation, and physicality. Freeman argues that women that are labeled "a bitch" are often seen as aggressive or as a man hater. Jo Freeman asked women to embrace their inner bitch, noting that it is difficult to make societal change without angering people (and therefore receiving the bitch label). The Bitch Manifesto was disliked by many but, this made an impact on Feminism. 

In 1977 Freeman became an associate of the [[Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press]] (WIFP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wifp.org/who-we-are/associates/|title=Associates {{!}}  The Women’s Institute for Freedom of the Press|website=www.wifp.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freeman is featured in the feminist history film ''[[She's Beautiful When She's Angry]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shesbeautifulwhenshesangry.com/women/|title=The Women|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shesbeautifulwhenshesangry.com/the-film/ |title=The Film — She's Beautiful When She's Angry |publisher=Shesbeautifulwhenshesangry.com |date= |accessdate=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career in law and political science ==
Before receiving her PhD from the University of Chicago in 1973, Freeman taught for four years at the State University of New York. She then spent two years in Washington, DC as a fellow at the [[Brookings Institution]] and then as an APSA Congressional Fellow.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apsanet.org/section_165.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; With an increasing interest in public policy, and unable to find a full-time appointment in academia, Freeman decided to study law after she was offered a Root-Tilden Scholarship&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.nyu.edu/depts/publicinterest/scholarships/rtk.html |title=Root-Tilden-Kern Scholarship Program |accessdate=2008-08-03 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228075817/http://www.law.nyu.edu/depts/publicinterest/scholarships/rtk.html |archivedate=December 28, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; at New York University School of Law. She received a J.D. degree in 1982 and was admitted to the New York State Bar the next year.&lt;ref name=SCAF/&gt; She maintained a private practice in [[Brooklyn]], New York for many years, serving as counsel to women running for political offices and to pro-choice demonstrators.

Freeman has published 11 books and hundreds of articles. Most are on some aspect of women or feminism, but she also writes about social movements and political parties. Two of these are considered classics: "On the Origins of Social Movements" and "The Political Culture of the Democratic and Republican Parties." ''Women: A Feminist Perspective'' went into five editions and for many years was the leading introductory women's studies textbook. ''A Room at a Time: How Women Entered Party Politics'' (2000) also won a prize for scholarship given at the APSA.

She has continued to attend the major party political conventions, but as a journalist. Many of her articles are posted to her webpage, as are some of her photographs of political events and a small selection from her button collection.

'''Jukka Jalmari Virtanen''' (born 25. July 1933) is a [[Finland|Finnish]] entertainer and author. He has worked as both a film and television director, actor and host. He is also an accomplished songwriter. Starting originally as a newspaper columnist, Virtanen began his television career in the 1950s and his film career in the 1960s.

He won the [[Rose d'Or]] in 1965 for the entertainment program [[Lumilinna]] (The Cold Old Days). He is known for starring and directing in many films by [[Spede Pasanen]], most notably in ''[[Millipilleri]]'', ''[[Pähkähullu Suomi]]'' and ''[[Noin 7 Veljestä]]'', as well as playing bit parts in the [[Uuno Turhapuro]] franchise.

He was also the long-standing host of the TV show [[Levyraati]] (1980-1997) as well as [[Runoraati]]. Additionally, he has been a songwriter for a number of prolific Finnish musical artists such as [[Ilkka Lipsanen]].

== Film career ==
Virtanen started his directorial career in the 1960s and directed a high number of TV movies for [[YLE]]. His first theatrical feature was Millipilleri in 1966 which he co-directed with [[Ere Kokkonen]] and Spede Pasanen, all of whom also played roles in the film. He also directed Pähkähullu Suomi (1967) as well as Noin 7 Veljestä (1968), where he also starred. His last theatrical film was [[Fakta Homma (film)|Fakta Homma]] in 1987, based on the highly popular comedy TV show of the same name.

As an actor, he debuted in the movie [[Iloinen Linnanmäki]] and had a long-standing series of supporting roles in future Spede films, including [[Speedy Gonzales – noin 7 veljeksen poika]] and the [[Vääpeli Körmy]] series.

== TV career ==
His TV career started formally in 1955 when he began directing both commercials and short-films for [[YLE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Uusitalo|first1=Kari|title=Jukka Virtanen - Elonet biografia|url=https://www.elonet.fi/fi/henkilo/105823|website=Elonet|accessdate=13 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He directed and starred in a large variety of programs and TV produced films for YLE throughout the 1960s and 1970s.

He took over the role of host from [[Vesa Nuotio]] (who hosted briefly following the long tenure of [[Jaakko Jahnukainen]]). In the program, a panel of guests rated new hit songs and their music videos weekly. Virtanen became noted for his appearance, manner of speech and cordial way in which he addressed the panel. Based off the format, he later hosted a similar program called Runoraati in which the panel rated poems.

{{Inline|date=June 2014}}

'''Kenelm Henry Digby''' (c. 1797 – 1880) was an Anglo-Irish writer, whose reputation rests chiefly on his earliest publication, ''[[The Broad-Stone of Honour]], or Rules for the Gentlemen of England'' (1822), which contains an exhaustive survey of medieval customs. The work was subsequently enlarged and issued (1828–29) in four volumes entitled: ''Godefridus, Tancredus, Morus ''and'' Orlandus''. Digby's exposure to [[Walter Scott]]'s ''[[Ivanhoe]]'' novels as a youth encouraged him to romanticize the Middle Ages. ''Broad-Stone'' contributed to the [[Young England]] movement’s feudalist ideology and influenced many of Digby's Cambridge contemporaries. The book inculcated readers with ideas of chivalry and staunch Catholicism and stressed the importance of the heart’s knowledge over intellectual learning by presenting historical figures as role models. Digby's revival of medieval principles helped young men of his day construct their idea of what being a "gentleman" means.

Born at [[Clonfert]], he was 15 when his father died in 1812. He moved to England to attend Petersham High School near London. From 1816 to 1819, he went to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]],&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=DGBY814KH|name=Digby, Kenelm Henry}}&lt;/ref&gt; where some members of the university advocated reform and even republicanism; Digby, however, favoured a strong monarchy, the Church, and chivalry. At Cambridge, he read [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson]] and [[Arthur Hallam|Hallam]]; his close friends there were George Darby, [[Julius Hare]], [[William Whewell]], and [[Adam Sedgwick]]. In summer, he traveled across Europe sketching old castles and writing. 

[[Ehrenbreitstein]], a massive mediaeval fortress in Germany, gave him the title ''[[The Broad-Stone of Honour]]''. He published the book in a single volume in 1822, and the beliefs he explored while writing it seem to have contributed to his conversion to Catholicism in 1825. After that, he rewrote and expanded the one volume into four, published in 1828-29: ''Godfridus'', containing a general introduction (named after [[Godfrey of Boulogne]], a Crusade hero); ''Tancredus'', discussing chivalry’s discipline and applauding Christianity (for [[Tancred of Hauteville]], another Crusade hero); ''Morus'', bashing the Reformation as the death of chivalry and religion (after [[Sir Thomas More]]); and ''Orlandus'', which detailed Digby’s idea of chivalric behaviour (after [[Ariosto]]’s ''[[Orlando Furioso]]''). {{cn|date=June 2014}}

[[File:Song of Old Wyoming (1945) 1.jpg|thumb|[[Sarah Padden]], [[Eddie Dean (singer)|Eddie Dean]], and Lash LaRue in ''[[Song of Old Wyoming]]'' (1945).]]
'''Alfred "Lash" LaRue''' (June 15, 1917&lt;ref name=HoF/&gt; – May 21, 1996) was a popular western motion picture star of the 1940s and 1950s. He had exceptional skill with the [[bullwhip]] and taught [[Harrison Ford]] how to use a bullwhip for the [[Indiana Jones]] movies. LaRue was one of the first recipients of the [[Golden Boot Awards]] in 1983.

== Biography ==

=== Early life and education ===
Born Alfred LaRue in [[Gretna, Louisiana]] in 1917,&lt;ref name=gl/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|title=Lash LaRue, 79, Western Star With a Whip|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/31/arts/lash-larue-79-western-star-with-a-whip.html|accessdate=11 July 2015|agency=The New York Times|date=May 31, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was reared in various towns throughout Louisiana, but in his teens the family moved to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]], where he attended St. John's Military Academy. However, California death records show his father's last name as Wilson and that he was born in Michigan.&lt;ref name=HoF&gt;{{citation |title=The hall of fame of western film stars |page=254 |author=Ernest N. Corneau |year=1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also attended the [[College of the Pacific (University of the Pacific)|College of the Pacific]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

=== Films ===
He began acting in films in 1944 (at age 27) as '''Al LaRue''', appearing in two musicals and a serial before being given a role in a [[Western film]] that would result in his being cast in a cowboy persona for virtually the rest of his career. He was given the name Lash because of the {{convert|18|ft|m|adj=on}}-long [[bullwhip]] he used to help bring down the bad guys. The popularity of his first role as the Cheyenne Kid, a [[sidekick]] of singing cowboy hero [[Eddie Dean (singer)|Eddie Dean]], not just brandishing a whip but using it expertly to disarm villains, paved the way for LaRue to be featured in his own series of Western films. After appearing in all three of the Eddie Dean [[Cinecolor]] singing Westerns in 1945-46, he starred in quirky B-westerns from 1947 to 1951, at first for [[Poverty Row]] studio PRC, then for [[Eagle-Lion]] when they took over the studio, and later for producer [[Ron Ormond]].

He developed his image as the cowboy hero Lash LaRue, dressed all in black, and inherited from [[Buster Crabbe]] a comic sidekick in the form of "Fuzzy Q. Jones" played by [[Al St. John]]. LaRue played the Cheyenne Kid sidekick in about 8 films, before he starred in his own film series, playing a character actually named "Marshall Lash LaRue". Those 11 films (from 1948-1951) are the ones that western movie fans refer to as the "Lash LaRue" film series (see Filmography below).

He was different from the usual cowboy hero of the era: dressed in black, he spoke with a "city tough-guy" accent somewhat like that of [[Humphrey Bogart]], whom he physically resembled. His use of a bullwhip, however, was what set him apart from bigger cowboy stars such as [[Gene Autry]] and [[Roy Rogers]]. His influence was felt throughout the dying medium of B-westerns; for example, he had an imitator, [[Whip Wilson]], who starred in his own brief series, and even [[Roy Rogers]] started picking up and using a bullwhip in some of his [[Republic Studios]] Westerns made in the same period.

He also made frequent personal appearances at small-town movie theaters that were showing his films during his heyday of 1948-51, a common practice for cowboy stars in those days. However, his skillful displays of stunts with his whip, done live on movie theater stages, also convinced young Western fans that there was at least one cowboy hero who could do in real life the same things he did on screen. He continued working in films and television until he retired in 1990.

=== Filmography of the "Marshal Lash LaRue" films ===
This is a chronological list of the eleven films in which he actually played the character named "Marshal Lash LaRue". They are all available on a single box set of DVDs (along with a bonus film called ''The Son of Billy The Kid'').

====''Lash LaRue Western''====
''Lash LaRue Western'' [[comic books]] were published first by [[Fawcett Comics]] and later by [[Charlton Comics]] between 1949 and 1961. They were among the most popular Western-themed comics of the era, running for more than 100 (usually monthly) issues.

For a time he was married to [[Reno Browne]], a B-western [[film actress|actress]], who together with [[Dale Evans]] was one of only two Western actresses ever to have their own comic book fashioned after her character. He later married [[Barbra Fuller|Barbara Fuller]], a radio, film and television actress. Their marriage lasted slightly over a year; they wed February 23, 1951 in [[Yuma, Arizona]], and divorced June 2, 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5190348/the_salt_lake_tribune|title=Wife, 26, Divorces Movie Cowboy|work=The Salt Lake Tribune|date=June 3, 1952|agency=United Press|location=Utah, Salt Lake City|pages=40|via=Newspapers.com|accessdate=May 7, 2016}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lash LaRue comic books sold over one million copies each around the world,{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} many of which featured Lash and Barbara's godson, J.P. Sloane.&lt;ref&gt;The Nashville Banner(US)	June 1, 1991, pg. Front Page Sec B, by: Leon Alligood Senior Staff Writer, "Special 'Uncles' Provide Star-studded Childhood"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
In the later 1950s, LaRue was featured in archival footage numerous times on the children's program ''[[The Gabby Hayes Show]]''. He appeared several times on the [[Television syndication|syndicated]] television series ''[[26 Men]]'', true stories of the [[Arizona Rangers]]. LaRue also appeared on Jimmie Jackson's television show ''Memory Lane''&lt;ref&gt;The Hollywood Reporter (US)	November 10, 1950, Vol. CXI, Iss. 31, pg. 10, by: Dan Jenkins, "Lash LaRue guest on Jimmie Jackson's MEMORY LANE"&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared seven times in different roles in the 1956 TV western ''[[Judge Roy Bean (TV series)|Judge Roy Bean]]'', starring [[Edgar Buchanan]] in the title role, with [[Jack Buetel]] and [[Jackie Loughery]]. One of his roles on ''Judge Roy Bean'' was as the [[outlaw]] [[John Wesley Hardin]]. He portrayed another real-life criminal, [[Doc Barker]], in the TV series ''[[Gangbusters]]'', which was later recut into the film ''[[Guns Don't Argue]]''.

LaRue and [[Steve Brodie (actor)|Steve Brodie]] shared the role (from 1959–61) of Sheriff [[Johnny Behan]] in [[Cochise County, Arizona|Cochise County]], [[Arizona]], on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp]]'', starring [[Hugh O'Brian]]. LaRue appeared five times; Brodie, nine times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0479017/?ref_=tt_cl_t9|title=Lash LaRue|publisher=[[Internet Movie Data Base]]|accessdate=August 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A role as the villain in a [[pornographic]] western, ''Hard on the Trail'', in 1972, led him to repentance as a [[missionary]] for ten years, as he had not been informed of the adult nature of the film and would not have consented to appear in the film. He did not actually appear in any of the pornographic scenes. The film was later released without the pornographic scenes and re-titled ''Hard Trail'' in an attempt to eliminate the [[double entendre]].&lt;ref name="Hardy"&gt;[[Phil Hardy (journalist)|Hardy, Phil]] (editor). ''[[The Aurum Film Encyclopedia]]: The Western'', Aurum Press, 1983; {{ISBN|0-906053-57-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Musician ===
LaRue often returned to Louisiana and East Texas, where he grew up. He became a regular at the [[jam session]]s at the [[Dew Drop Inn (New Orleans, Louisiana)|Dew Drop Inn]] in New Orleans and clubs in the Dallas area under the name Lucky LaRue. In his [[autobiography]], ''[[Backbeat (biography)|Backbeat]]'', drummer [[Earl Palmer]] recalls:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Lots of white people wanted to come to the Dew Drop. Most were turned away, but they let a few in. Every time the cowboy actor Lash LaRue came in town, he came by. He played a hell of a [[guitar]] and was a regular guy that people liked.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Faith===
He was a [[born-again Christian]] who was [[baptized]] at [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]] [[Baptist]] Tabernacle by pastor Jimmy G. Tharpe. Tharpe initially met LaRue in [[Alexandria, Louisiana|Alexandria]], the seat of [[Rapides Parish]], when LaRue was visiting the home of his daughter. He and another minister, Don Chelette of Alexandria, were [[proselytizing]] door-to-door when they met LaRue and his daughter.

Tharpe thereafter declared a "Lash LaRue Day" at his church at which LaRue gave his Christian testimony: "He came, and we had a wonderful service in our gymnasium. There were thirty-seven people saved in the gym that day. He cut paper from the mouth of Debbye, my daughter, with his whip. We all rejoiced over Lash LaRue and his testimony. I introduced Lash to others, and several churches invited him to give his testimony, and he accepted."&lt;ref&gt;Jimmy G. Tharpe, ''Mr. Baptist'', [[Springfield, Missouri]]: 21st Century Press, 2003, pp. 74-76.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

LaRue later was an evangelist who worked with alcoholics in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; He was one of several people injured by a tornado while in attendance at the Missouri State Fair in [[Sedalia, Missouri]], on August 20, 1952.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

His name was mentioned in the 1973 song "Childhood - 1949", which was written and recorded by [[Bobby Goldsboro]] as the B-side to his hit single "Summer (The First Time)".

He is one of many classic western stars mentioned in the 1974 [[Statler Brothers]] song "Whatever Happened to Randolph Scott?"

Writer/singer/producer Bruce Blackman of the pop group [[Starbuck (band)|Starbuck]] wrote and recorded the tribute song "Lash LaRue," included on their 1976 album ''[[Moonlight Feels Right]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moonlightfeelsright.com/buy_or_listen_to_music/|title=Starbuck|website=Moonlightfeelsright.com|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1994 film, ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'', Winston Wolfe ([[Harvey Keitel]]), refers to Vincent Vega, ([[John Travolta]]) as Lash LaRue.

LaRue is seen on the 1986 [[Johnny Cash]] and [[Waylon Jennings]] duet album [[Heroes (Johnny Cash and Waylon Jennings album)]]. LaRue holds the lash on the front cover and on the back cover of the album, LaRue is standing with Jennings and Cash.

[[Professional wrestler]] [[John LeRoux]] borrowed his [[ring name]] from LaRue, dubbing himself "Lash LeRoux" in 1999.
In the Rockford Files episode entitled, "Material Difference" 1978, Rockford confronts his notorious sidekick Angel Martin at an outdoor restaurant.  Rockford asks the leather jacket-clad Angel, "What are you a clone of Lash LaRue?"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4488">"'''Duke of [[Cornwall]]'''" appears as a title in pseudo-historical authors as [[Nennius]] and [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]. The list is patchy and not every succession was unbroken. Indeed, Geoffrey repeatedly introduces Dukes of Cornwall only to promote them to the [[List of legendary kings of Britain|Kingship of the Britons]] and thus put an end to their line as (merely) dukes. As adjuncts or supporting roles to the kings of the Britons, the legendary dukes of Cornwall are considered part of the vast [[Matter of Britain]].

The list is more often thought of as a conglomeration of various Celtic rulers, Celtic warlords, and mythical heroes. If the lists of kings of Britain are legendary, then the list of dukes must be considered still more a genealogical and historical legend with no solid basis in the view of most historians. (Even within Geoffrey's ''History'', the title of these rulers fluctuates between "duke" (''dux Cornubiae'') and "king" (''rex Cornubiae'').)

'''Manuel Mondragón''' was a Mexican military officer who played a prominent role in the [[Mexican Revolution]]. He was born in [[Ixtlahuaca]], [[State of Mexico]] in 1859 and died in exile in [[Spain]] in 1922. He graduated from the [[Mexican Military Academy]] as an artillery officer in 1880. He designed Mexico's first [[semi-automatic rifle]], the [[Mondragon rifle|M1908 rifle]], and a 75mm howitzer. General Mondragón was the father of a model, artist and poet [[Carmen Mondragón]], better known as Nahui Ollin.

== Porfiriato ==
[[File:Mondragón rifle.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Mondragón rifle|Mondragón M1908]]  rifle.]]
As an adolescent Mondragón entered the Military Academy of [[Chapultepec]], where he specialised in [[artillery]].  Upon finishing his studies, he worked developing military [[materiel]].  He modified the [[Canon de 75 modèle 1897|French 75]]mm howitzer, earning a name for himself among [[Porfirist]] military circles.  He perfected a repeating rifle and a 75mm [[howitzer]] (the ''[[Saint-Chamond-Mondragón]]''), both of which still bear his name.  In 1904 he wrote a manual ''Description and employment of the instruments for preparing and executing fires'', and in 1910 ''Description of rapid-fire 75mm materiel''.  In 1907 he was named Director of the Department of Artillery.

He initiated a project on military [[organic law]], based on mandatory military service, and as professor of the Military Academy released a work in 1910 entitled ''Defense of the Coasts''.  The artillery at the ports of [[Salina Cruz]] on the [[Pacific]] and [[Puerto México]] on the [[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf]] are due to his efforts.

As a military officer during the Porfirato, he worked against the [[Francisco Madero|Maderista]] movement.  In September 1911, he took leave from the Federal Army, but in 1913 returned, reincorporated in the army to support [[Gregorio Ruiz]] in the anti-Maderista rebellion of the ''[[Decena trágica]]''.  He is suspected of having assassinated the Mexican President [[Francisco I. Madero]] and his Vice-President [[José María Pino Suárez|José María Pino]].

== Revolution ==


At the side of [[Bernardo Reyes]] and [[Félix Díaz (politician)|Félix Díaz]], Mondragón assisted in the start of the rebellion and [[coup]] against [[Francisco I. Madero]]. He allied with General [[Victoriano Huerta]] as Madero was obliged to renounce the presidency, thus frustrating the start of a new democratic direction in the country.  Upon Huerta's assumption of the presidency, Mondragón was named [[Secretariat of National Defense|Secretary of War and the Navy]]. He served in this position only a short time, as in June he resigned amid accusations from prominent Huertist politicians and public opinion of his culpability in the advance of revolutionary forces, due to his incompetence and poor planning in the campaign against them.

== Exile ==
Following these accusations, [[Victoriano Huerta]] expelled Mondragón from Mexico, heeding the rumor of a plot to overthrow him. Mondragón left for [[Spain]], where the government of France awarded him the [[Légion d'honneur]]. General Manuel Mondragón died in [[San Sebastián]] in 1922.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Mark Sloniker was born and grew up in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]. His grandfather worked for
The Baldwin Piano Company. Mark was so obsessed with playing piano all day and all night that his mother would sometimes call the firefighters to get him off the piano.

Sloniker took piano lessons at an early age. He didn't like reading black music dots and try to hear them and would say ''"How is it they call this music? I can't hear a thing."'' He would rather play by ear by listening to the radio or listen to the movie soundtrack.

Later on Sloniker would be inspired by the Hollywood actor Ron Howard and the trombone player Winthrop. He played the Trombone from 5th grade and throughout high school. He still practiced the piano.

===Career===
Sloniker later enrolled at the [[University of Cincinnati]] and finished his Trombone lessons. He went to various colleges. He played at concerts and joined the Jazz fusion group Kinesis. He finally earned his Music Therapy degree. He also married his wife Colleen Crosson and they each made their own music.
His first new age, jazz music is "Paths of Heart", released on cassette and CD album made in 1986. Since then his songs were on the billboard chart around the world. Since then he continued to make more New-age music like "True Nature" in 1988. Some of his songs can be heard in ''The Weather Channel'' Fall Foliage reports or on the locals. His latest CD album is "Miracles and other works of heart" 2009 that both he and his wife Colleen Crosson worked on. His songs include "The Cellphone Blues" that talks about how he doesn't like how distracting cellphones, GPS maps distract people. Also his song "Oil Can" talks about how he enjoys books and movies like ''The Wizard of Oz'' and ''To kill a mocking bird''. He also talks about Christianity religion in his songs.
Today he and his wife are both playing songs for people.

'''Matija Mažuranić''' ([[Novi Vinodolski]] 1817– [[sanatorium]] in [[Feldhof]] near [[Graz]], April 17, 1881), was a [[Croats|Croatian]] writer.

Travelogue writer, brother of more noted [[Ivan Mažuranić|Ivan]], the writer of the well-known epic ''Smrt Smail-age Čengića''. He attended a German school in his native town, where he was trained to become a [[blacksmith]]. Often he indulged into travels ([[Montenegro]], [[Serbia]]), and exceptionally in a few occasions to [[Bosnia]]. In 1841 he was back to Novi, practicing his craft and agriculture, but also engaging in literature and cultural issues in general. In 1847 he ended up in [[Vienna]], in 1848 again in Bosnia (in [[Sarajevo]], at the court of Fazli-paša Šerifija). At the end of 1848, in a latter addressed to his brothers he says: ''"I don't know when I shall return home, for I have been, I'm afraid, created for this country. Turks&lt;ref&gt;In the 19th century the term ''Turk'' ([[Croatian language|Croatian]]: ''Turčin'', ''Turak'') could refer both to [[Ottoman Turks]], and to Islamicised Slavs that today refer themselves them as ''[[Bosniaks|Bosniak]]s.''&lt;/ref&gt; are very fond of me for my prudence, they say, and [[rayah]] grows ever more trust in me, and therefrom there is no other outcome but [[mitre]] on the head or a stake in the arse"''.&lt;ref&gt;"Ja ne znam kad ću se povratiti kući, jer sam, bojim se, samo za ovu zemlju stvoren. Turci me jako ljube radi velike mudrosti, kako kažu, a raja sve većma i većma povjerenje u me stavlja, i otud ne more drugo slijediti nego mitra na glavi ili kolac u dupe".&lt;/ref&gt; After Sarajevo, Matija went to [[Istanbul]] (though the exact dates cannot be ascertained), and according to some legends even further, to [[Suez]] and the [[Egypt]]. In 1852 Matija was back to Novi, where he settled until growing ill in 1879. He lived a secluded life until the symptoms of mind degeneration have started to show, finally dying in the sanatorium of a well-known psychiatrist [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]], near [[Graz]], on April 17, 1881.

As a writer Mažuranić was noted for his travelogue ''Pogled u Bosnu''. During his 1839 travels to Bosnia (from [[Karlovac]], [[Sisak]] and [[Hrvatska Kostajnica|Kostajnica]], over [[Belgrade]], on foot and horse, to Sarajevo, [[Travnik]], over [[Romanija]] up to [[Zvornik]]) – Mažuranić wrote a piece which can be read both as an adventure and as a realistic account of the seen and experienced. The travelogue intermixes author's views on the relationships between the [[Ottoman Turks]] and the Bosniaks, [[Islam]] and Christianity, with accounts of the customs of everyday life, images of [[vizier]] courts of [[Agha (Ottoman Empire)|aga]]s and [[pasha]]s, but also of folk [[meyhane]]s, contemplations on everyday life, love and death.

'''Max Troll''' (1902 – 7 April 1972) was a German communist-turned-[[Informant|informer]] who betrayed hundreds of Bavarian communists to the [[Bavarian Political Police]], a forerunner of the [[Gestapo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Paul|last=Hoser|url=https://www.historisches-lexikon-bayerns.de/Lexikon/Schutzstaffel_(SS),_1925-1945|title=Schutzstaffel (SS), 1925–1945 |publisher=[[Historisches Lexikon Bayerns]] |date= |website= |access-date=21 October 2018 |language=German |trans-title=}}&lt;/ref&gt; between 1933 and 1936. Troll spent a short time in [[Dachau concentration camp]] and served in the German Army during [[World War II]]. After the war he was sentenced to ten years in jail for his role as informer and released after five, in contrast to his Gestapo handlers who were not prosecuted.

Troll was never a Nazi, opposing the regime instead, but a number of factors have been cited for his betrayal, among them financial difficulties, his treatment while being held at Dachau and the threat of physical violence against his stepbrothers should he not cooperate.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Troll, the son of a truck driver, and born in [[Lower Bavaria]], grew up in [[Munich]]. Troll worked as a labourer on building sites and as a life guard for the city of Munich, but lost his job in 1931 because of his left-wing activities and thereafter remained unemployed until 1934.{{sfn|Mehringer|Schönhoven|Grossmann|1983|p=148}} Troll lived in the working class suburb of [[Giesing]], in public housing, an area dominated by unemployment and communist activities,{{sfn|Mehringer|Schönhoven|Grossmann|1983|p=148}} and joined the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD) in 1932.&lt;ref name="Centre" &gt;{{cite news |date=27 January 2018|title=Max Troll (1902–1972)|trans-title=|url=https://www.ns-dokuzentrum-muenchen.de/dauerausstellung/muenchner-biographien/detail/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=20&amp;cHash=0f6003bc570402a8cda3e92cefb88ec8|language=German |work=[[Munich Documentation Centre for the History of National Socialism]]|location=[[Munich]] |access-date=20 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nazi era===
With [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power]] in Germany, the Nazis took power in [[Bavaria]] on 9 March 1933 and Troll was arrested the same day alongside his two stepbrothers and taken to [[Dachau concentration camp]].{{sfn|Mehringer|Schönhoven|Grossmann|1983|p=133}} He and his brothers were some of its first inmates.{{sfn|Meinl|Schröder|2015|p=20}} Troll was released in May and worked as an informer for the [[Bavarian political police]], now under the control of [[Heinrich Himmler]]. The possibility exists that he either already worked as an informer when he joined the KPD in 1932,&lt;ref name="Centre" /&gt; or that he may have been forced into cooperating after his release by the threat that his brothers would be killed or ill treated at Dachau should he refuse. His difficult financial situation as well as the fact that he was broken by ill treatment while at Dachau may also have been factors.{{sfn|Meinl|Schröder|2015|p=21}} In any case, from May 1933 Troll made a concentrated effort to establish the names of Bavarian communists who had gone underground. Because of the decentralized nature of the communist movements it had become very hard for the police to track the communist resistance.&lt;ref name="Centre" /&gt;

Under the code name "Theo", Troll actively recruited members for the communist resistance. He was employed at a building site at the [[Deutsches Museum]] in Munich in 1934 and successfully recruited members there. Those as well as communists who distributed illegal leaflets and collected donations for the ''[[Rote Hilfe]]'', an organisation supporting family members of people arrested by the Nazis, were betrayed by Troll. He rose to become, in April 1935, the leader of the ''Rote Hilfe'' and, in early 1936, the leader of the KPD in Southern Bavaria. Troll travelled repeatedly to Switzerland and Czechoslovakia to obtain donations and instructions while also infiltrating the non-communist resistance in Bavaria with his informers.&lt;ref name="Centre" /&gt;{{sfn|Mehringer|Schönhoven|Grossmann|1983|p=134}}

Because of his work the Bavarian political police were able to wait until mid-1935 until initiating a wave of arrests,&lt;ref name="Centre" /&gt; being in almost complete control of the communist resistance in Munich and able to direct it through Troll.{{sfn|Mehringer|Schönhoven|Grossmann|1983|p=135}} By then, when suspicion started to fall on him, Troll had handed the names of 250 communists and sympathisers to the police as well as betrayed their organisational structure, bringing the communist resistance in Munich to an almost complete standstill. Some of the resistance members he betrayed were subsequently sentenced to death and executed.&lt;ref name="Centre" /&gt; He was also involved in the destruction of the Munich cell of the [[Socialist Workers' Party of Germany]] and made contact with Catholic and monarchist resistance groups as part of the aim of the KPD to create a united peoples front, the ''Volksfront'', to [[German resistance to Nazism|resist Hitler and the Nazis]].{{sfn|Mehringer|Schönhoven|Grossmann|1983|pp=152–153}} 

Troll was withdrawn as an informer by the [[Gestapo]] in 1936 and subsequently worked in the [[Messerschmitt]] aircraft factory in [[Regensburg]],&lt;ref name="Centre" /&gt; courtesy to a glowing referral provided by [[Karl Brunner (SS general)|Karl Brunner]], the head of the Gestapo in Munich.{{sfn|Meinl|Schröder|2015|p=21}} 

While paid well during his times as police informer for his work, receiving up to 240 [[Reichsmark]] per month, Troll did not receive any further benefits once his role had been completed and the Gestapo actively tried to ensure that he would not be employed in any politically sensitive role.{{sfn|Mehringer|Schönhoven|Grossmann|1983|p=156}} From 1940 to 1944 Troll served in the [[Wehrmacht]] until captured in 1944,&lt;ref name="Centre" /&gt; and returned to Germany in 1946 after having been a prisoner of war in France.{{sfn|Mehringer|Schönhoven|Grossmann|1983|p=156}} During his time in the German military his comrades noted that Troll was opposed to the Nazi regime and criticised it, something they testified to in his trial after the war.{{sfn|Mehringer|Schönhoven|Grossmann|1983|p=156}}

===Post-war===
He was tracked down by victims of his betrayal, who extracted a written confession from him, which led to his arrest in West Germany in May 1947. He was sentenced to ten years in a labour camp by a court in Regensburg, but released after five for health reasons. The sentence against Troll in Regensburg was one of the hardest for Nazi crimes there and also included confiscation of his assets, loss of the right to vote, and a ban from working.&lt;ref name="Centre" /&gt;{{sfn|Meinl|Schröder|2015|p=21}} 

Attempts to prosecute him further for the death of communists he betrayed were unsuccessful as the court in Munich deemed the result of his actions as within the frame of the anti-communist laws in Germany at the time and the [[Cold War]] anti-communist attitude in the west after the war.{{sfn|Meinl|Schröder|2015|p=21}}{{sfn|Mehringer|Schönhoven|Grossmann|1983|p=154}} His three former contacts in the Gestapo who he reported to were not prosecuted, although they did spend some compulsory time in detention for being members of the organisation.{{sfn|Meinl|Schröder|2015|p=21}} Some even re-entered Bavarian government service after the war.&lt;ref name="Centre" /&gt;

Troll died in Regensburg on 7 April 1972 without suffering any further repercussions for his actions as informer.&lt;ref name="Centre" /&gt;

The destruction of the communist resistance in Munich and the role Troll played in it became part of the novel ''Verrat in München und Burghausen'' (Betrayal in Munich and Burghausen) by Max Brym, published in 2018, which tells the story a fictional protagonist in the back ground of the real events.&lt;ref &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.max-brym.de.rs/verrat-in-muenchen-und-burghausen-neues-buch|title=Review: ''Verrat in München und Burghausen'' |publisher=Max Brym website |date= |website= |access-date=21 October 2018 |language=German |trans-title=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ned Christie''' (December 14, 1852 – November 3, 1892), also known as '''''NeDe WaDe''''' in [[Cherokee]], was a Cherokee statesman. Ned was a member of the executive council in the Cherokee Nation senate, and served as one of three advisers to Chief [[Dennis Bushyhead]]. He was notable for holding off American lawmen in what was later called [[Ned Christie's War]], after being accused, wrongfully according to testimony in 1918, of murdering a [[United States Marshal]]. This gave him notoriety as an [[outlaw]], and he was eventually killed by lawmen.

==Early life==
Christie was born at [[Wauhillau, Oklahoma|Wauhillau]] (located at {{coord|35.85550 |-94.77426|type:edu_region:US-OK|display=inline}}), Going Snake District, [[Cherokee Nation]], in the present-day state of [[Oklahoma]]. He was the son of the Removal Era [[Trail of Tears]] survivors, Watt and Lydia (Thrower) Christie. They were of the [[United Keetowah Band of Cherokee Indians|Keetowah band]], the most traditional of Cherokee peoples. {{efn|Roy Hamilton wrote that the family surname was originally ''Wakigu'' in Cherokee, which meant either "Sugartree" or "Step Along." Instead of directly translating the Cherokee name, the family took the Christie surname from a female family member before their removal to the West. He also noted that the name ''NeDe WaDe'' actually translates as "Ned, the son of Watt."&lt;ref name="Hamilton"&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Killing-Ned-Christie-Cherokee-Outlaw/dp/1889683132 Hamilton, Roy. "Some Errors in Ned Christie Life Cloud Book." Review of book, ''The Killing of Ned Christie'', authored by Bonnie Stahlman Speer. 2000.] Accessed July 3, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As a child and young man, Christie was a marble champion, stick ball player and a popular fiddle player.&lt;ref name="CherokeeReg"&gt;[http://cherokeeregistry.com/Ned_Christie.pdf "Ned Christie." Cherokee Registry. Undated.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and family==
One source says Ned was married first to Nannie Dick about 1871.&lt;ref name="CherokeeReg"/&gt; {{efn|However Nannie Dick's burial registry shows only that she  lived from about 1848 until April 1882 and that she was Watt Christie's fifth wife.&lt;ref name="ChristieCemetery"&gt;[http://www.okcemeteries.net/adair/wattchristie/wattchristie.htm "Watt Christie Cemetery". Oklahoma Cemeteries. 2015.] Accessed July 4, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Ned's second wife was said to be Peggy Tucker who he married in 1875. Third, he married Jennie Scraper (about 1877). Fourth, he married Nancy Greece (about 1888).&lt;ref name="CherokeeReg"/&gt;

Christie was a big man at {{convert|6|ft|4|in}}, and became a [[blacksmith]] and [[gunsmith]]. In 1885, he was elected to the tribal Senate.&lt;ref name="The Case of Ned Christie"&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/fosm/historyculture/case-of-ned-christie.htm "The Case of Ned Christie"], Fort Smith Historic Site, National Park Service, accessed February 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oky"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/C/CH061.html |title=Christie, Ned (1852-1892) |author=Art T. Burton |date=2009 |work=Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture |publisher=Oklahoma Historical Society |accessdate=February 27, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119125828/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/C/CH061.html |archivedate=November 19, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By religion Ned was a member of the [[Keetoowah]] Society. According to Hamilton, Keetowah translates into English as "principle people" or "real people."&lt;ref name="Hamilton"/&gt; His father, Watt, and grandfather (Lacy Christie), were Chiefs of their ceremonial ground near the family home at Wauhillau (present-day [[Adair County, Oklahoma]]).&lt;ref name="CherokeeReg"/&gt;

Although well-regarded by fellow Cherokees, Christie had a hot temper, especially after drinking whiskey. He had once been charged with manslaughter in the 1885 death of another Cherokee, William Palone.&lt;ref name="CherokeeReg"/&gt; Tried in the tribal court at Talequah, he was found not guilty and released.&lt;ref name="Frates"&gt;[http://thislandpress.com/2016/08/25/the-atonement-of-christie/ Frates, Kent F.

==Ambush of Daniel Maples==
On May 3, 1887, U.S. Deputy Marshal Daniel Maples led a posse into Indian Territory seeking sellers of illegal whiskey.{{efn|Selling whiskey in Indian Territory was a Federal crime, prosecutable in the United States Court of the Western District of Arkansas in [[Fort Smith, Arkansas|Fort Smith]].}} A principal culprit was  Bud Trainer, who already had a record for selling whiskey and committing violent crimes. After spending the day unsuccessfully seeking Trainer, Maples and posse member George Jefferson started back to their camp near Spring Branch Creek. was shot from ambush in the Cherokee Nation by someone who escaped without being identified. Maples died of his wounds on the next day.&lt;ref name="Frates"/&gt;

=="Ned Christie's War"==
According to Frates' version of the story, the other marshals suspected that Trainer was the man who shot Maples, and began arresting his associates. Christie was accused of the murder by a companion, John Parris, who was at first arrested for the crime. Parris told authorities that Christie had fired the shot that killed Maples. Friends convinced Christie to hide, but he also appealed to the United States Court of the Western District of Arkansas in [[Fort Smith, Arkansas|Fort Smith]] for bail to allow time to prove his innocence. (This court also had oversight over the [[Indian Territory]].) US Judge [[Isaac C. Parker]] did not believe he could comply with the request.&lt;ref name="The Case of Ned Christie"/&gt; Parker's sensational cases and record of executions dominate the period's history, although he also worked to rehabilitate offenders, reform the criminal justice system, and advocate the rights of the Indian nations in the territory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/fosm/historyculture/judge-parker.htm "Judge Isaac C. Parker"], Fort Smith Historic Site, National Park Service, accessed February 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Fearing a trial before white people in a U.S. court, Christie fortified his home to resist arrest.{{Christie's home was in the Rabbit Trap community of the Goingsnake District in the Choctaw Nation, where he lived with his then-wife, Nancy Greece, and her 13-year old son James Greece.&lt;ref name="Frates"/&gt;}} He learned that he had already been indicted for Maples' murder and that Judge Parker had sent more marshals to arrest him. Reportedly, he wrote a letter to Judge Parker, saying that he was willing to surrender if Parker would promise to release him on bail while he looked for evidence to prove his innocence. Parker never answered the letter, other than to send the marshals.  He began a stand-off with the U.S. that would last almost five years. He was advertised as an outlaw "wanted, dead or alive."

In 1889, Jacob Yoes became the U.S. Marshal in Fort Smith. Yoes assigned his top deputy, [[Heck Thomas]], to lead the effort to bring in Christie. Thomas was assisted by Deputy Marshall L. P. Isbell of [[Vinita, Oklahoma|Vinita]], two other marshals, plus the notorious Bud Trainer.  In an attack in 1889, lawmen burned his house to the ground, but Christie escaped with friends, although he was wounded by a gunshot. Christie never went to trial.&lt;ref name="The Case of Ned Christie"/&gt;

In 1891 marshals served another warrant for Christie's arrest. He had moved to a more isolated area away from [[Tahlequah, Oklahoma|Talhequah]], and built a fortified house at Wauhillau. Today it is often referred to as Ned's Fort. The "fort" was a double-log-thick home with sand poured between the logs. He made openings only large enough to see from and put a rifle through.&lt;ref name="The Case of Ned Christie"/&gt; Heck announced his demand for Christie's surrender using a traditional Cherokee war cry - the sound of a turkey gobbling. The only response was a gunfight that kept the posse away, and during which Marshal Isbell was seriously wounded. Thomas then decided to burn Christie out. First the marshals set fire to Christie's blacksmith shop. The flames then spread to the cabin. Christie's wife and his nephew, Little Arch Wolf, escaped the burning cabin, although the nephew was wounded by gunfire. Believing that Christie had been killed, Heck and the posse left the scene to obtain medical attention for Isbell, who had already lost a lot of blood. Nancy Christie returned to the burned-out cabin after the wreckage cooled and found her husband wounded but still alive. She dragged him to safety and got him and the Wolf boy to a local white doctor. The white doctor and a Cherokee medicine man saved the lives of Ned and Wolf. According to Frates, this was when Ned Christie declared his one-man war against the U.S. government and swore that he would never surrender.&lt;ref name="Frates"/&gt;

Recovering from his narrow escape, Ned and his friends built a fort for protection. The fort was double-walled with logs and had sand packed between the two walls. It also had gun ports for rifles and was amply stocked with food, water and ammunition to withstand a siege. During this time, the U.S. Government increased the reward for Ned Christie's capture from $500 to $1000. In October 1892, Marshal Yoes sent a posse of six deputies to Christie's known location.  This group was forced to withdraw after two men were wounded in a firefight.&lt;ref name="Frates"/&gt;

Yoes then proposed a military-style raid on the fort. It was led by Deputy Gideon S. “Cap” White, a former captain in the U.S. Cavalry during the Civil War. Gus York, a civilian who was familiar with the territory, was hired to assist White, along with 14 other men. An army post in Kansas agreed to loan White a cannon for the expedition. White's force surrounded the Christie fort on the morning of November 3, 1892. In addition to Ned, the fort was occupied that morning by his wife Nancy, her son Albert, Ned's daughter, Mary, his granddaughter, Charlotte, Little Arch Wolf, and Charles Hair, a young Cherokee.&lt;ref name="Frates"/&gt;{{efn|It is unclear whether James and Charles Hair were also present.&lt;ref name="Frates"/&gt;}} After the first exchange of rifle fire, the marshals allowed the women and children to leave for safety elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Frates"/&gt;

[[File:Ned Christie's War 1892.gif|thumb|Photograph of the posse that attacked Christie's fort November 3, 1892.]]
In 1892, Christie was killed by a posse of lawmen, who attacked his fort with the cannon and dynamite.&lt;ref&gt;Speer, Bonnie. 1990. ''The Killing of Ned Christie: Cherokee Outlaw''. Norman, OK: Reliance Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Frustrated that the cannon balls could not penetrate the fort walls, the lawmen loaded a double charge of powder into the cannon. The next shot instead blew up the cannon, rendering it useless by shattering the barrel. The attackers then managed to push a wagon load of dynamite against one wall. When the marshals detonated the dynamite, the explosion destroyed part of the fort and set the rest afire.&lt;ref name="Frates"/&gt; Ned was shot and killed while running out of the ruined fort toward the posse. They tied his body to a door for transport by train to [[Fayetteville, Arkansas]]. There lawmen had themselves photographed with Christie's body as a trophy of their capturing the "notorious outlaw" who had held off the government for years. Then they transported the body by train to [[Fort Smith, Arkansas]], to gain their reward. Again people had their pictures taken next to Christie's body.&lt;ref name="The Death of Ned Christie"&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/fosm/historyculture/death-of-ned-christie.htm "The Death of Ned Christie"], Fort Smith Historic Site, National Park Service, accessed February 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The Cook photography studio took a photo to reproduce and sell as postcards. Christie's body was released by authorities to his family, who took it to Wauhillau for burial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.larkcom.us/ancestry/allen/reports/allen_us_marshal_display.htm Larry Kraus, "Allen, US Marshal?"], 2000-2001, US Ancestry, accessed February 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The body was interred at the Watt Christie Cemetery in Wauhillau, where its location is marked by a tombstone.&lt;ref name="ChristieCemetery"/&gt;

In 1918, a man named Dick Humphreys came forward to authorities and stated he had seen the killing of Marshal Maples. He said that Christie didn't shoot him, but that a man named Bud Trainer did. Humphries had not said anything earlier because he feared that Trainer would come back to kill him. Christie was cleared at last.&lt;ref name="The Death of Ned Christie"/&gt; Christie's opposition to railroad development in Indian Territory made him many powerful enemies. Some researchers believe that this may have contributed to him being falsely accused of the murder of Maples.&lt;ref name="oky"/&gt; {{efn|Bud Trainer was killed in Vinita in 1896 by a group of four men. Frates says that the men apparently argued over a whiskey deal that had gone bad.&lt;ref name="Frates"/&gt;}}

==Legacy and honors==
Today Christie is honored by a plaque at the Cherokee Court House in [[Tahlequah, Oklahoma]], the oldest public building in the state. The memorial reads that he was "assassinated by U. S. Marshals in 1892." The Fort Smith Historical Site &lt;ref name="The Case of Ned Christie"/&gt; also has material recognizing Christie's assassination.

Many articles about Christie were published in newspapers and western magazines, as his story captured people's imaginations. Christie was also the subject of novels, such as ''Zeke and Ned'' by [[Larry McMurtry]] and Diana Osana, and ''Ned Christie's War'' by Robert Conley. Several non-fiction books have been written, including ''He Was a Brave Man'' by Lisa LaRue.  Christie's great-great-nephew Roy J. Hamilton wrote a non-fiction account of his life, titled ''Ned Christie: Cherokee Warrior''.&lt;ref name="CherokeeReg"/&gt;

'''Nicolas Mathieu Rieussec''' (July 20, 1781 – June 18, 1866) was a French watchmaker.

== Origin of the Rieussec Name ==
The Rieussec family's birthplace was the town of [[Lespinassière]]. Nicolas was the son of Joseph Rieussec, a merchant born in the 18th century in Lespinassière, in [[Languedoc]], then one of the largest provinces in the kingdom of France. Today, Lespinassière is located in [[Aude]], one of the five départements of the [[Languedoc-Roussillon]] region.

== Genealogy of Nicolas Mathieu Rieussec ==

Joseph Rieussec was in Paris at the end of 1778, although no one knows when he left his birthplace, the town of Lespinassière, for the kingdom's capital. His wife, Jeanne Michateau, was expecting. 
On January 20, 1779, she gave birth to their first son, Nicolas Joseph. 
On July 20, 1781, a few years before the outbreak of a [[French Revolution|revolution that was to lead to an upheaval in France and all of Europe]], a younger brother arrived and was named Nicolas Mathieu Rieussec. The baby was baptised three days after his birth in the parish of Sainte-Marie du Temple. Nicolas Mathieu Bogganio, a banker residing on the Rue des Victoires in Paris, stood godfather, and the godmother was Marie Victoire Griveau, also residing on the Rue des Victoires. 
Joseph Rieussec held a literary salon. On an unknown date, probably between 1786 and 1788, he remarried Cécile Paillard. The family grew with the arrival of a third child, Lucile Clotilde Cécile, born on October 25, 1788. She died in 1818. Joseph Rieussec died in 1838.
Some may be astonished that Nicolas Mathieu was born in Paris. It is true that several sources put his birth in Toulouse, sometimes on September 1, 1781, which is not supported by a single document. In contrast, the royal warrant naming Nicolas Mathieu a Watchmaker to the King, is accompanied by a baptismal certificate from the registry of the Sainte-Marie-du-Temple parish in Paris.

==Early years==
Still a minor, young Rieussec was set up as a watchmaker at no. 14, Rue du Marché-Palu, on the [[Île de la Cité]]. 
The Almanac du commerce de Paris pour l’an XIII (Paris Business Yearbook for Year XIII), i.e., 1805, lists 190 watchmakers, including the renowned Breguet. Rieussec does not appear. In contrast, five years later, he is listed among the 222 watchmakers in Paris. He did business at no. 14, Rue du Marché-Palu.
Married to Anne Marie Delan, he had a son named Joseph-Ferdinand, born on December 15, 1804, a few days after Napoleon was crowned Emperor of the French. Two years later, Rieussec became a widower. His wife, born July 21, 1780, died on May 1, 1806. Less than a year later, on February 7, 1807, Nicolas Mathieu married Marie Pierrette Flore Bourdin in Sainte-Marguerite church. Time passed. The year 1815 and [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] arrived, during which [[Napoleon]] and his Empire was swept away in defeat.

== Watchmaker to the King ==

With the royalty restored, the throne passed to a Bourbon, [[Louis XVIII]], brother of the late [[Louis XVI]], who had been guillotined in 1793. All indications are that the new king did not consider Rieussec to be a loyal follower of [[Napoleon]], or to have a black mark against his past. From 1817 on, Rieussec practiced his profession at no. 13, Rue Notre-Dame-des-Petits-Champs. Curiously, he also had a currency exchange there for an indeterminate period of time. That same year, the young watchmaker began to gain recognition when he was named a Watchmaker to the King in a royal warrant dated January 31, 1817.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“On this thirty-first day of January, eighteen hundred and seventeen, the King at Paris, having been made fully aware of the good life and moral conduct of Sieur Nicolas Mathieu Rieussec, and of the distinguished reputation he has acquired in his profession of Watchmaker, desires to confer upon him a mark of his favour and of the protection with which he honours him; for this purpose, His Majesty has granted and does grant him the title of his Watchmaker so that said Sieur Rieussec can enjoy all the honours, prerogatives and other benefits thereunto appertaining; His Majesty desires and intends that he may use said Title at all gatherings and on all public documents […].”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1817, there were already five Watchmakers to the King in Paris: [[Jean-Joseph Lepaute (born 1768)|Lepaute]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lapendulerie.com/Lepaute-Jean-Joseph-DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=45&amp;tabindex=44&amp;artistid=240050 |title=Jean-Joseph Lepaute |website=lapendulerie.com |accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre Le Roy|Le Roy]], [[Jean-Antoine Lépine|Lépine]], [[Robert Robin|Robin]], and [[Lamygonge]]. Rieussec was the sixth. It was not by chance that this honour had been obtained. Since 1815/1816, Nicolas Mathieu had been entrusted with “maintenance of the clocks for the Minister of the King’s Household,” or in other words the Royal Furniture Depository. Created at the beginning of the 17th century, the Royal Furniture Depository was the government office responsible for managing furniture and artwork used to furnish and decorate the royal residences.

An ambitious man, Nicolas Mathieu Rieussec did not stop with this warrant. Scarcely had he been named a Watchmaker to the King when he sought another warrant as Watchmaker to the Crown's Furniture Depository. Between May and June 1817, Rieussec sent a letter to the Baron de la Ville d’Avray, the general superintendent of the Royal Furniture Depository. Having worked for the Depository for nearly two years, Rieussec considered that he had a right to this warrant. Such a request was astonishing, as witnessed by the following letter dated May or June 1817.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“Now that Warrants as Watchmakers to the Royal Furniture Depository are being conferred, he feels that in asking for one, he is requesting only what is his due, since it is a consequence of his employment.
Sieur Rieussec believes he is all the more justified since, out of six warrants with this title that were just conferred, only four of the watchmakers are, like himself, employed by the Royal Furniture Depository, and two (Messrs. Leroy and Lépine) are not at all, and so have been better treated than him if his request is not granted.
Could the Watchmaker to the King warrant be regarded as a favour that would cause the other to be refused him? He cannot convince himself of that, for he values possession of the former too highly to believe that anyone could consider it a precluding honour.
He therefore believes that the title of Watchmaker to the King does not influence the question of the other title in the slightest, and that that question is resolved by the legitimate rights conferred upon him by the duties he performs.
Sieur Rieussec does not seek to hold two titles; his ambition was satisfied when he was granted the Warrant as Watchmaker to the King.
This is a right that he is asserting now. It is a favour obtained by Messrs. Leroy and Lépine, who are not employed by the Royal Furniture Depository at all. In contrast, Sieur Rieussec is indeed one of [His Majesty’s] watchmakers.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He had no choice but to wait, especially since the warrant list for 1817 was already closed. The wait was a short one. 
In 1818, he was granted a warrant as Watchmaker to the Royal Furniture Depository.

== The “Chronograph” ==
[[File:Chronograph invented by Nicolas Rieussec, 1821.jpg|thumb|upright=0.99|Chronograph invented by Nicolas Rieussec, 1821]]

The decade of the 1820s was one of the most prosperous in Nicolas Mathieu Rieussec's life. It certainly did get off to an auspicious start. September 1, 1821, found Rieussec at the [[Champ-de-Mars]] in Paris - not as a race spectator come to watch the Arrondissement de la Seine race, but as a watchmaker testing a “chronometer intended to consistently measure the time horses take to travel the prescribed race distances - not only the winning horse, but also all those that cross the line after it.“&lt;ref&gt;Seine département prefecture, Horse races, excerpt from the minutes of the meeting on September 23, 1821, INPI, 1BA1625&lt;/ref&gt;
Rieussec's presence at the Arrondissement de la Seine race was not by chance. His elder brother, Nicolas Joseph, was an important person in French equestrian circles, which at the time were growing rapidly. Sixteen years earlier, on August 31, 1805, an imperial decree had established horse racing. It was in this context that, before 1805, Nicolas Joseph had founded the Buc stud farm, prior to purchasing that of Viroflay a few years later in 1812. He is also considered the promoter of the thoroughbred in France. Horse racing was the fashion, and young watchmaker Nicolas Mathieu quickly saw it as an opportunity to use his skill. Running the horses and determining the winner was one thing. Being able to measure the time for each of the racers was quite another. At this time, early in the 19th century, the need was felt for an instrument that could accomplish this.

On September 1, 1820, many prominent figures had come to the Champ-de-Mars. A practised eye would have recognized [[Joseph Jérôme, Comte Siméon]], Minister, Junior Minister in the Ministry of the Interior; and [[Gaspard de Chabrol]], Prefect of the Seine [département].

Chabrol's support was doubtless unnecessary, since the Minister had expressed his “kindness” to Rieussec the same day, giving him reason to “hope for a patent on the basis of public utility.” Both the Race Jury's report and Prefect Chabrol's letter referred to Rieussec's invention as a “chronometer” or a “timer.” There was as yet no mention of a “chronograph.” The tests were judged to be satisfactory for the time being, as witnessed by the Race Jury's report. Rieussec's invention met a real need. Better yet, it was a comfortable and reliable way to measure the times. Henceforth, there was “no fear of any errors.” It seemed destined for a promising future!

=== A “Chronograph with Seconds Indicator” ===
In the minutes of its meeting held October 15, 1821, the [[French Academy of Sciences]] reports on Rieussec's invention, which he had presented to them two weeks earlier and which was examined by two of its members, [[Abraham-Louis Breguet|Breguet]] and [[Gaspard de Prony|Prony]]. As Rieussec later wrote to Comte Siméon, it was this prestigious company that was the first to call his invention the “Chronograph with Seconds Indicator.” The expression caught on to such a point that it replaced “chronometer” and “timer.” Then and for all time to come, the term became “Rieussec’s chronograph.” Having the Academy's minutes is no small advantage. They provide a description of the chronograph and its operation that is among the most comprehensive in existence:

&lt;blockquote&gt;”The volume and shape of this instrument are about those of a large pocket chronometer. The dial is movable and turns about an axis that is perpendicular to its plane and passes through its centre. When the Chronograph is operating, this dial makes one revolution per minute, and since its circumference is divided into 60 parts, the angular motion of one division corresponds to one second. A small window next to the hanging ring reveals a number, which is replaced by another number with each revolution of the dial and indicates the minutes; the Chronograph can run about three-quarters of an hour without stopping.
To use this instrument, when it is mounted and in a resting state, one first sets the divisions marking the time to the starting points by turning a knurled knob with one’s hand. Through the intermediary of a gear train, the knob causes the minute and second dials to move. Having done this, when the moment to start timing arrives, one presses a small button next to the knob to set the machine in motion. The observer can give full attention to the phenomena whose successive time intervals he wishes to measure, and as soon as one of the divisions of these intervals is reached, he presses a second button next to the one we have just mentioned. At the moment when it is pressed a small pen, or metal point, passing through the open tip of a cone filled with black oil ink and placed opposite the moving dial’s fixed zero point, marks a point on the circumference that is divided into seconds. This point then indicates the second and fraction of a second corresponding to the beginning or end of the period of time being measured.
Operation of the pen trigger mechanism neither stops nor slows the moving dial’s motion, so the button can be pressed several times while this motion lasts, making a number of black points on the scale divided into 60 parts; each point indicates, by its position, the moment when it was marked.
To stop the chronograph quickly, one need only press the button that started it. The mechanism is arranged such that pressing this button abruptly changes the current state of the machine, making it pass from a resting state to movement or from movement to its resting state.
We did not examine the inside of the instrument, and we do not think that it offers anything particularly remarkable, given the current state of watchmaking. Its principal merit lies in its ability to instantly indicate the first and last moments of several successive time intervals by means of permanent, visible signs on a moving dial, without requiring the attention of the observer’s eyes or ears.
A chronograph with such a property unquestionably offers precious resources to physicians, engineers and, in general, anyone who measures phenomena. A highly satisfactory trial was recently made at public horse races; but its use can obviously extend to an infinite variety of other kinds of observations, the testing of moving machines, gauging of running water, and almost all hydraulic operations. The passage of a star over the cross-hairs of a telescope, when the astronomer has only one free hand, will be very precisely indicated by this new means, which will either serve to verify the count of the seconds on a clock, or will replace such a count if the distant location of the clock or poor hearing keeps the escapement from being heard. […]
We think that Mr. Rieussec’s Chronograph deserves the Academy’s approval.&lt;ref&gt;Institut National de la Propriété Industrielle, 1BA1625&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In summary, on October 14, 1821, Rieussec presented his invention to the Academy of Sciences, which christened it a ''chronograph''. The term was particularly well chosen: ''[[chronograph]]'' comes from the Greek words ''[[chronos]]'' and ''graphin'', which means “that which writes time”. This system works as follows: a nib places a black mark on the dial at the moment when the phenomenon being measured ends. So the user can read the duration of the phenomenon - a horse race or something else - on the dial thanks to the time ''written'' by the hand. The chronograph was born!

=== Obtaining a Patent ===
Armed with the reports from the Race Jury and the Academy of Sciences, Nicolas Mathieu Rieussec sent a letter to “His Excellency, Comte Siméon, Minister, Junior Minister in the Ministry of the Interior.” Ambitious, he reminded the minister that the minister had given him cause to hope for “a Patent on the basis of public utility.” To support his request, he attached a copy of the previously mentioned reports and “the plans and designs for the component parts of the race Chronograph and of the one used for astronomy and for observation of phenomena requiring the strictest accuracy.” This last point is important. It tells that right from the beginning, Rieussec made two different chronographs - one tested at the 1821 Arrondissement de la Seine race, the other presented before the Academy of Sciences that same year.
Rieussec's application, recorded by the Ministry of the Interior's departments, was examined by the Advisory Committee for Arts and Factories at a meeting on December 22, 1821. 
At its meeting on March 2, 1822, the Advisory Committee acknowledged the following facts: “Sieur Rieussec, Watchmaker to the King in Paris, requests a five-year patent for a timepiece that he calls a Chronograph. The description and design furnished by the petitioner were sufficiently clear and detailed; nothing stands in the way of granting the Patent.” One week later, on March 9, 1822, Rieussec obtained a five-year patent for a “Timepiece, or timer for distance covered, called a chronograph with seconds indicator, indicating the duration of several successive phenomena without requiring the observer’s attention.”
In his application packet, Rieussec justifies the improvements he believed he had made to his chronograph. The following text is an excerpt from his justification:

&lt;blockquote&gt;“The first Chronographs, for which I obtained a Patent in 1821, were too large in size to be easily transportable as watches, due to the complicated parts that made up the mechanism.
“Since that time I have attempted to simplify the mechanism enough so that chronographs could be incorporated into very small watches, and as will be seen in the description &lt; &gt;, I have even combined the chronograph movement and the watch movement in a single case, such that this instrument is always available to use. The simplifications that I have added are such that I can adapt this mechanism even to the most ordinary watches and put them on the market at a very moderate price.”&lt;ref name="1BA5889"&gt;Institut National de la Propriété Industrielle, 1BA5889&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He was granted the patent on January 16, 1838. Apart from the simplifications noted above, Rieussec made another important modification to his chronographs. From that time on, they had a fixed dial and a moving hand.

=== Improvements to Chronographs ===
Still, it was not until the fall of 1837 that Rieussec filed a patent application for "Improvements to Chronographs". The wording of this application sounds like a manifesto: Ten-year patent for invention and various significant improvements made to chronographs, which he states he invented and improved.
In his application packet, Rieussec justifies the improvements he believed he had made to his chronograph. Here is an excerpt from his justification:

&lt;blockquote&gt;”The first Chronographs, for which I obtained a Patent in 1821, were too large in size to be easily transportable as watches, due to the complicated parts that made up the mechanism.
Since that time I have attempted to simplify the mechanism enough so that Cronographs could be incorporated into very small watches, and as will be seen in the description […], I have even combined the chronograph movement and the watch movement in a single case, such that this instrument is always available to use. The simplifications that I have added are such that I can adapt this mechanism even to the most ordinary watches and put them on the market at a very moderate price.”&lt;ref name="1BA5889"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He was granted the patent on January 16, 1838. Apart from the simplifications noted above, Rieussec made another important modification to his chronographs. From that time on, they had a fixed dial and a moving hand.

=== Other patents: From the Cart with Measuring Device to the Rieussec Snuffbox ===

On the eve of 1830, Nicolas Mathieu's brother Nicolas Joseph Rieussec was interested in selling heating wood. It was in this context of a new business being developed by his brother that our watchmaker filed two new patents, both completely unrelated to watchmaking. On September 5, 1832, he drew up an application for “a cart for transporting heating wood to a residence [and called a] cart with measuring device [voiture porte mesure] or improved dray.”
An excerpt from one of the documents submitted with the file helps to imagine Rieussec's project:

[[File:Improvements to Chronographs - 1845.jpg|thumb|upright=0.96|right|Improvements to Chronographs invented by Nicolas Rieussec - 1845]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“This cart differs from those known as measuring carts [voitures mesures] mainly in that in these last, the frame that contains the wood to be transported, which is longer and more cumbersome, is placed above the axle and is part of the body of the cart, which necessitates the use of wheels with a small diameter to avoid having it be too high, but then one can see how difficult it is for the horse that has to pull the full cart, especially if it meets with an obstacle.
In contrast, the frame of the cart with measuring device is suspended beneath the axle, which allows for the use of large wheels […].”&lt;ref&gt;Institut National de la Propriété Industrielle, 1BA3981&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He was granted a five-year patent on October 5, 1832. Some months later, Rieussec drew up a new application, again for an invention related to heating wood. This time, he claimed “a new and improved system of devices for sawing, weighing and measuring residential heating wood.” 
Rieussec's interest in heating wood is astonishing, for being so much a part of another time. Yet he did express real concern for some of his contemporaries’ daily concerns. Rieussec's career as an inventor did not stop there. In 1860, at the age of 79, he filed another patent application, his last. This time, it was for a “snuffbox system called the Rieussec [[Snuffbox]].” 
Rieussec's last invention showed a concern for health that was before its time.

== A Veteran of French Watchmaking ==
=== An Award-Winning World’s Fair Exhibitor from 1823-1855 ===
During the first half of the 19th century, the French industrial sector was expanding rapidly. Its newness led public authorities to work toward encouraging a “copycat effect.” Consequently, industry lived by the rhythm of the expositions devoted to its products. From 1823 to 1855, Rieussec was a regular participant in these exhibitions, which initially were held every four years. The first world's fair was held in 1851, in London. Rieussec was there. In 1855, Paris hosted another world's fair, which gave the Second Empire an opportunity to celebrate industry and modernity.
These expositions were an opportunity for Rieussec to collect new honours. In 1823, he exhibited an “astronomical clock with seconds, and a watch of his own invention, which he calls a chronograph.” This earned him a bronze medal. He was also among the exhibitors in 1839, when he introduced a new-style chronograph, after having obtained a patent the year before. The jury awarded him the bronze medal, a repeat of the one received in 1823.
Rieussec was again present at the 1844 exposition. That year, “the jury [was] delighted to acknowledge how prolific Mr. Rieussec’s invention has been in terms of useful applications, and hasten[ed] to do him justice by awarding him a silver medal.” In 1851, he was in London exhibiting in [[the Crystal Palace]]. Once again, his products, attracted notice. “The ingenuity of the mechanical combinations used by Mr. Rieussec to conveniently and reliably obtain a result so valuable to experimenters so impressed the London jury that the creator of this mechanism was unanimously found worthy of the first prize, and - to the great regret of all the judges - was deprived of it only by the clause in the rules stipulating that the highest award could not be given to an invention more than twenty years old.” Which, however, did not prevent him from being awarded a prize medal. The [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|1855 world's fair]] was the crowning achievement of Rieussec's watchmaking career, as “this veteran of French watchmaking” was awarded a first-class medal.

== Supplier to the Royal Furniture Depository ==

Rieussec's work was not limited to sophisticated measuring instruments such as the chronograph, intended to make official measurements of time intervals, whether for horse races or scientific phenomena. His activity as Watchmaker to the Royal Furniture Depository gave him an opportunity to create movements for the clocks ordered to decorate certain rooms of the royal residences. In 1821, Rieussec delivered a clock called “Iris fastening on her wings” intended for the bedchamber of the Duke of Bordeaux, who was the grandson of the [[County of Artois|Count of Artois]], brother of King Louis XVIII.
Between 1820 and 1825, Rieussec signed a movement for a clock depicting Saint Vincent de Paul. This object was brought to Saint-Cloud castle in early 1826. 
In 1821, more active than ever, Rieussec delivered a superb clock representing “Sappho inspired by Love,” followed by a “Homer singing over the ruins of Troy”clock which he delivered to the Royal Furniture Depository that same year. During the last years of the Restoration (1815–1830) or the first years of the July Monarchy (1830–1848), Rieussec signed a movement for a clock representing the shepherd Belisarius, inspired by a painting shown by the painter Gérard at the Salon of 1795.
These few examples are an accurate reflection of Nicolas Rieussec's great productivity between 1820 and the end of the Restoration. Having been Watchmaker to [[Louis XVIII]] (1815–1824), then to his brother [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] (1824–1830), Rieussec remained a Watchmaker to the King under the following regime. [[Louis-Philippe]], who was king from 1830 to 1848, appreciated Rieussec's work enough to keep him in his service. It was also during this time that Rieussec became associated with another watchmaker, [[Chaudé]].

== Was Watchmaking Passed Down from Father to Son? ==
The genealogies that were able to consult for this article repeatedly note that Joseph Ferdinand, the son of Nicolas Mathieu, born December 15, 1804, was a Watchmaker to the King. To date, there has not been found any document confirming this. It remains to be seen whether Joseph Ferdinand followed in his father's footsteps and became a watchmaker. One passage in the property inventory made after Nicolas Mathieu's death implies that the father left his business to his son. Here, again, there is no evidence attesting to the son's watchmaking activity. Everything there is to know about this is that when his father died, Joseph Ferdinand was a merchant and lived at no. 183, Rue de Grenelle-Saint-Germain, now Rue de Grenelle.

== Last Years ==
Nicolas Mathieu Rieussec died at his home at 60 Avenue du Bel-Air in Paris, in 1866. The declaration of succession drawn up after his death noted that he was a gentleman of independent means at the time. His heirs were his son Joseph Ferdinand and the daughters of his own daughter, Marie Clotilde, who had died young in 1842.
The inventory of Nicolas Mathieu's property, drawn up after his death, noted that the deceased was a Knight in the Order of the Legion of Honour. Unfortunately, there has been no trace of his file in the National Archives where the Legion of Honour's records are kept.

In [[Abrahamic religions]], '''Noah'''{{efn|{{Hebrew Name|נוֹחַ or נֹחַ|Nōaẖ|Nōaḥ}}; {{lang-syr|ܢܘܚ}} ''Nukh''; {{lang-am|ኖህ}}, ''Noḥ'';  {{lang-ar|نُوح}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|Nūḥ}}''; {{lang-grc|Νῶε}}}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|oʊ|.|ə}} {{respell|NOH|ə}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/pronunciation?lang=eng LDS.org: "Book of Mormon Pronunciation Guide"] (retrieved 2012-02-25), [[Wikipedia:IPA for English|IPA]]-ified from «nō´a»&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wells|first=John C.|year=2008|title=Longman Pronunciation Dictionary|edition=3rd|publisher=Longman|isbn=9781405881180}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the tenth and last of the [[Antediluvian|pre-Flood]] [[Patriarchs (Bible)|Patriarchs]]. The story of [[Noah's Ark]] is told in the Bible's [[Genesis flood narrative]]. The biblical account is followed by the story of the [[Curse of Ham]].

In addition to the Book of Genesis, Noah is mentioned in the [[Old Testament]] in the [[Books of Chronicles|First Book of Chronicles]], and the books of [[Book of Tobit|Tobit]], [[Book of Wisdom|Wisdom]], [[Sirach]], [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]], [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]], [[2 Esdras]], [[4 Maccabees]]; in the [[New Testament]], he is mentioned in the gospels of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]], [[First Epistle of Peter|1st Peter]] and [[Second Epistle of Peter|2nd Peter]]. Noah was the subject of much elaboration in the literature of later Abrahamic religions, including the [[Quran]] ([[Surah]]s [[Sura 71|71]], [[Sura 7|7]], [[Sura 11|1]], and [[Sura 21|21]]).

==Biblical account==
[[File:Noah mosaic.JPG|thumb|right |12th-century Venetian [[mosaic]] depiction of Noah sending the dove]]
The primary account of Noah in the Bible is in the [[Book of Genesis]].

Noah was the tenth of the pre-flood ([[antediluvian]]) Patriarchs. His father was [[Lamech (father of Noah)|Lamech]]  and his mother is not named in the biblical accounts.&lt;ref&gt;Fullom, S.W. (1855). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ELtYAAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=History+of+Woman+religion&amp;q=noah+mother#v=snippet&amp;q=noah%20mother&amp;f=false ''The History of Woman, and Her Connexion with Religion, Civilization, &amp; Domestic Manners, from the Earliest Period''], p.10&lt;/ref&gt; When Noah was five hundred years old, he became the father of [[Shem]], [[Ham, son of Noah|Ham]] and [[Japheth]] ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|5:32|9}}).

===Genesis flood narrative===
{{Main|Genesis flood narrative}}
The Genesis flood narrative makes up chapters 6–9 in the [[Book of Genesis]], in the [[Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Silverman|first=Jason|title=Opening Heaven's Floodgates: The Genesis Flood Narrative, Its Context, and Reception|year=2013|publisher=[[Gorgias Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The narrative, one of many [[flood myth]]s found in human cultures, indicates that [[Yahweh|God]] intended to return the [[Earth]] to its pre-Creation state of watery [[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]] by flooding the Earth because of humanity's misdeeds and then remake it using the microcosm of [[Noah's ark]]. Thus, the flood was no ordinary overflow but a reversal of [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]].&lt;ref name="Bandstra2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barry L. Bandstra|title=Reading the Old Testament: Introduction to the Hebrew Bible|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vRY9mTUZKJcC&amp;pg=PR19|date=2 July 2008|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=0-495-39105-0|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; The narrative discusses the evil of mankind that moved God to destroy the world by the way of the flood, the preparation of the ark for certain animals, Noah, and his family, and God's guarantee (the [[Noahic Covenant]]) for the continued existence of life under the promise that he would never send another flood.{{sfn|Cotter|2003|pp=49, 50}}

===After the flood===
{{Main|Covenant (biblical)#Noahic covenant}}
After the flood, Noah offered burnt offerings to God, who said: "I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart ''[is]'' evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done" ({{bibleverse-nb||Genesis|8:20–21|9}}).

"And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth" ({{bibleverse-nb||Genesis|9:1|9}}). They were also told that all fowls, land animals, and fishes would be afraid of them. Furthermore, as well as green plants, every moving thing would be their food with the exception that the blood was not to be eaten. Man's life blood would be required from the beasts and from man. "Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man" (9:6). A rainbow, called "my bow", was given as the sign of a covenant "between me and you and every living creature that ''[is]'' with you, for perpetual generations" ({{bibleverse-nb||Genesis|9:2–17|9}}), called the Noahic covenant or the [[rainbow covenant]].

Noah died 350 years after the flood, at the age of 950,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|9:28–29|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; the last of the extremely long-lived [[antediluvian]] Patriarchs. The maximum human lifespan, as depicted by the Bible, diminishes thereafter, from almost 1,000 years to the 120 years of [[Moses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Gen.6:3;Deut.31:22;34:37||9|Genesis 6:3; Deuteronomy 31:22; 34:37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Noah's drunkenness===
[[File:Egerton Genesis Noahs Drunkeness.png|thumb|Noah's drunkenness, Ham  mocks Noah, Noah is covered, Canaan is cursed. [[Egerton Genesis]]]]
After the flood, the Bible says that Noah became a [[husbandman]] and he planted a vineyard.  He drank wine made from this vineyard, and got drunk; and lay "uncovered" within his tent. Noah's son Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father naked and told his brothers, which led to Ham's son [[Curse of Ham|Canaan being cursed]] by Noah.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|9:20–27|9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As early as the [[Classical era]], commentators on {{bibleverse||Genesis|9:20–21|HE}} have excused Noah's excessive drinking because he was considered to be the first wine drinker; the first person to discover the effects of wine.&lt;ref name="Ellen&amp;Rollins"&gt;Ellens &amp; Rollins. ''Psychology and the Bible: From Freud to Kohut'', 2004, ({{ISBN|027598348X}}, 9780275983482), p.52&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Chrysostom]], [[Archbishop of Constantinople]], and a [[Church Father]], wrote in the 4th Century that Noah's behavior is defensible: as the first human to taste wine, he would not know its effects: "Through ignorance and inexperience of the proper amount to drink, fell into a drunken stupor".&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, 1990, pp. 202–203&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philo]], a [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic]] Jewish philosopher, also excused Noah by noting that one can drink in two different manners: (1) to drink wine in excess, a peculiar sin to the vicious evil man or (2) to partake of wine as the wise man, Noah being the latter.&lt;ref&gt;''Philo'', 1971, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Jewish tradition]] and [[Noah in rabbinic literature#His lapse|rabbinic literature on Noah]], rabbis blame [[Satan]] for the intoxicating properties of the wine.&lt;ref&gt;Gen. Rabbah 36:3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Noah's wine JewEnyc"&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=318&amp;letter=N&amp;search=Noah#984 JewishEncyclopedia.com – NOAH]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Curse of Ham===
{{main|Curse of Ham}}
[[File:Noah-Curses-Ham.jpg|thumb|left|''Noah curses Ham'' by [[Gustave Dore]]]]
In the field of [[psychological biblical criticism]], [[J. Harold Ellens|J. H. Ellens]] and W. G. Rollins address the narrative of {{Bibleverse||Genesis|9:18–27|HE}} that narrates the unconventional behavior that occurs between Noah and Ham. Because of its brevity and textual inconsistencies, it has been suggested that this narrative is a "splinter from a more substantial tale".&lt;ref&gt;Speiser, 1964, 62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T. A. Bergren. ''Biblical Figures Outside the Bible'', 2002, ({{ISBN|1563384116}}, {{ISBN|978-1-56338-411-0}}), p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; A fuller account would explain what exactly Ham had done to his father, or why Noah directed a curse at [[Canaan]] for Ham's misdeed, or how Noah came to know what occurred. The narrator relates two facts: (1) Noah became drunken and "he was uncovered within his tent", and (2) Ham "saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without". Thus, these passages revolve around sexuality and the exposure of genitalia as compared with other Hebrew Bible texts, such as {{Bibleverse|Habakkuk|2:15|HE}} and {{Bibleverse|Lamentations|4:21|HE}}.&lt;ref&gt;Ellens &amp; Rollins, 2004, p.53&lt;/ref&gt;

Other commentaries mention that seeing someone's nakedness could mean having sex with that person as seen in {{Bibleverse|Leviticus|18:7-8|HE}} and {{Bibleverse|Leviticus|20:11|HE}}.&lt;ref&gt;Levenson, 2004, 26&lt;/ref&gt;

===Table of nations===
[[File:Noahsworld map.jpg|thumb|right|The dispersion of the descendants of Shem, Ham, and Japheth (map from the 1854 ''Historical Textbook and Atlas of Biblical Geography'')]]
{{See also|Sons of Noah}}
{{Bibleverse||Genesis|10|HE}} sets forth the descendants of Shem, Ham, and Japheth, from whom the nations branched out over the earth after the flood. Among Japheth’s descendants were the maritime nations. (10:2–5) Ham’s son [[Biblical Cush|Cush]] had a son named [[Nimrod]], who became the first man of might on earth, a mighty hunter, king in [[Babylon]] and the land of [[Shinar]]. (10:6–10) From there [[Ashur|Asshur]] went and built [[Nineveh]]. (10:11–12) Canaan’s descendants{{snd}} Sidon, [[Biblical Hittites|Heth]], the [[Jebusite]]s, the [[Amorite]]s, the Girgashites, the [[Hivites]], the Arkites, the Sinites, the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites{{snd}} spread out from [[Sidon]] as far as [[Gerar]], near [[Gaza City|Gaza]], and as far as [[Sodom and Gomorrah]]. (10:15–19) Among Shem’s descendants was [[Eber]]. (10:21)

These genealogies differ structurally from those set out in Genesis 5 and 11. It has a segmented or treelike structure, going from one father to many offspring.  It is strange that the table, which assumes that the population is distributed about the Earth, precedes the account of the [[Tower of Babel]], which says that all the population is in one place before it is dispersed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |last=Bandstra |first=B. |url=https://books.google.com/?id=vRY9mTUZKJcC&amp;pg=PA67#v=onepage&amp;q=%22table%20of%20nations%22%20noah&amp;f=false |title=Reading the Old Testament: Introduction to the Hebrew Bible |publisher= Cengage Learning |year=2008 |pages= 67–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family tree==
{{AdamtoNoah}}

==Narrative analysis==
According to the [[documentary hypothesis]], the first five books of the Bible ([[Pentateuch]]/[[Torah]]), including Genesis, were collated during the 5th century BC from four main sources, which themselves date from no earlier than the 10th century BC. Two of these, the [[Jahwist]], composed in the 10th century BC, and the [[Priestly source]], from the late 7th century BC, make up the chapters of Genesis which concern Noah. The attempt by the 5th-century editor to accommodate two independent and sometimes conflicting sources accounts for the confusion over such matters as how many of each animal Noah took, and how long the flood lasted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Introduction to the Hebrew Bible|last= Collins|first= John J.|year= 2004|publisher= Fortress Press|location= Minneapolis|isbn= 0-8006-2991-4|pages= 56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Who Wrote the Bible?|last= Friedman|first= Richard Elliotty|year= 1989|publisher= HarperCollins Publishers|location= New York|isbn=0-06-063035-3|page= 59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Books of the Bible'' notes that this story echoes parts of the [[Garden of Eden]] story: Noah is the first vintner, while Adam is the first farmer; both have problems with their produce; both stories involve nakedness; and both involve a division between brothers leading to a curse. However, after the flood, the stories differ. Noah plants the vineyard and utters the curse, not God, so "God is less involved".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/?id=SNFMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA334#v=onepage&amp;q=noah%20&amp;f=false ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Books of the Bible''], Oxford University Press, 2011, p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other accounts==
Noah appears in several non-canonical books.

===Pseudepigrapha===
The [[Book of Jubilees]] refers to Noah and says that he was taught the arts of healing by an angel so that his children could overcome "the offspring of the [[Watcher (angel)|Watchers]]".&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Jack Pearl, [https://books.google.com/?id=mO_H2lVTyhkC&amp;pg=PA14#v=snippet&amp;q=%22seems%20to%20have%20little%22&amp;f=false ''A Study of the Interpretation of Noah and the Flood in Jewish and Christian Literature''], BRILL, 1968, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 10:1–3 of the [[Book of Enoch]] (which is part of the [[Orthodox Tewahedo biblical canon]]), [[Uriel]] was dispatched by "the Most High" to inform Noah of the approaching "deluge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=[[s:Book of Enoch/Chapter 10|Chapter X]] |title=The Book of Enoch |others= translated by [[Robert Charles (scholar)|Robert H. Charles]] |location=London |publisher=Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge|year=1917 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dead Sea scrolls===
[[File:Genesis apocryphon.jpg|thumb|[[Genesis Apocryphon]], a portion of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] that features Noah.]]
There are 20 or so fragments of the [[Dead Sea scrolls]] that appear to refer to Noah.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, DM., [https://books.google.com/?id=MXU3PTrFe6gC#v=snippet&amp;q=%22words%20on%20noah%22%20twenty&amp;f=false ''Noah Traditions in the Dead Sea Scrolls: Conversations and Controversies of Antiquity''], Society of Biblical Lit, 2008, pp. 15–17.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lawrence Schiffman]] writes, "Among the Dead Sea Scrolls at least three different versions of this legend are preserved."&lt;ref&gt;Schiffman, LH., [https://books.google.com/?id=jAsaAwAAQBAJ#v=snippet&amp;q=613%20second&amp;f=false ''Encyclopedia of the Dead Sea Scrolls, Volume 2'], Granite Hill Publishers, 2000, pp. 613–614.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, "The [[Genesis Apocryphon]] devotes considerable space to Noah." However, "The material seems to have little in common with Genesis 5 which reports the birth of Noah." Also, Noah's father is reported as worrying that his son was actually fathered by one of the [[Watcher (angel)|Watchers]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Jack Pearl, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mO_H2lVTyhkC&amp;pg=PA11#v=snippet&amp;q=%22the%20offspring%20of%20the%20Watchers%22&amp;f=false ''A Study of the Interpretation of Noah and the Flood in Jewish and Christian Literature''], BRILL, 1968, p. 11. "the offspring of the Watchers"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparative mythology==
{{Main|Flood myth}}
Indian and Greek flood-myths also exist, although there is little evidence that they were derived from the Mesopotamian flood-myth that underlies the biblical account.&lt;ref&gt;Frazer, JG., in Dundes, A (ed.),
[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=E__dnnQwGDwC&amp;dq=frazer+noah&amp;q=%22there+is+little+evidence%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22there%20is%20little%20evidence%22&amp;f=false ''The Flood Myth''], University of California Press, 1988,
pp. 121–122.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mesopotamian===
[[File:Mr. George Smith, the man who transliterated and read the so-called the Babylonian Flood Story of Tablet XI.jpg|thumb|George Smith, the man who transliterated and read the so-called "Babylonian Flood Story" of Tablet XI of the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]].]]
The Noah story of the Pentateuch is almost identical to a flood story contained in the Mesopotamian [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], composed about 2000 BC.  In the Gilgamesh version, the [[Mesopotamian gods]] are enraged by the noise that man has raised from the earth.  To quiet them they decide to send a great flood to silence mankind.  Various correlations between the stories of Noah and Gilgamesh (the flood, the construction of the ark, the salvation of animals, and the release of birds following the flood) have led to this story being seen as the inspiration for the story of Noah.  The few variations include the number of days of the deluge, the order of the birds, and the name of the mountain on which the ark rests.  The flood story in Genesis 6–8 matches the [[Gilgamesh flood myth]] so closely that "few doubt that [it] derives from a Mesopotamian account."&lt;ref name="George2003"&gt;{{cite book|first==A. R. |last=George|title=The Babylonian Gilgamesh Epic: Introduction, Critical Edition and Cuneiform Texts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=21xxZ_gUy_wC&amp;pg=PA70|accessdate=8 November 2012|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-927841-1|page=70 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; What is particularly noticeable is the way the Genesis flood story follows the Gilgamesh flood tale "point by point and in the same order", even when the story permits other alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;Rendsburg, Gary.  "The Biblical flood story in the light of the Gilgamesh flood account," in ''Gilgamesh and the world of Assyria'', eds Azize, J &amp; Weeks, N. Peters, 2007, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest written [[flood myth]] is found in the [[Mesopotamian]] [[Epic of Atrahasis]] and [[Epic of Gilgamesh]] texts. The ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' says "These mythologies are the source of such features of the biblical Flood story as the building and provisioning of the ark, its flotation, and the subsidence of the waters, as well as the part played by the human protagonist."&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'': [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/416799/Noah Noah].&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Encyclopedia Judaica'' adds that there is a strong suggestion that "an intermediate agent was active. The people most likely to have fulfilled this role are the [[Hurrian]]s, whose territory included the city of [[Haran]], where the Patriarch [[Abraham]] had his roots. The Hurrians inherited the Flood story from Babylonia".&lt;ref name=Skolnik287 /&gt;
The encyclopedia mentions another similarity between the stories: Noah is the tenth patriarch and [[Berossus]] notes that "the hero of the great flood was Babylonia’s tenth antediluvian king." However, there is a discrepancy in the ages of the heroes. For the Mesopotamian antecedents, "the reigns of the antediluvian kings range from 18,600 to nearly 65,000 years." In the Bible, the lifespans "fall far short of the briefest reign mentioned in the related Mesopotamian texts." Also, the name of the hero differs between the traditions: "The earliest Mesopotamian flood account, written in the Sumerian language, calls the deluge hero [[Ziusudra]]."&lt;ref name=Skolnik287 /&gt;

[[Gilgamesh]]’s historical reign is believed to have been approximately 2700 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Georges Roux, ''Ancient Iraq'', pages 123, 502&lt;/ref&gt; shortly before the earliest known written stories. The discovery of artifacts associated with [[Aga of Kish|Aga]] and [[Enmebaragesi]] of [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]], two other kings named in the stories, has lent credibility to the historical existence of Gilgamesh.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanie Dalley|Dalley, Stephanie]], ''Myths from Mesopotamia'', Oxford University Press (1989), p. 40–41&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest [[Sumer]]ian Gilgamesh poems date from as early as the [[Third dynasty of Ur]] (2100–2000 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Andrew George, page xix&lt;/ref&gt; One of these poems mentions Gilgamesh’s journey to meet the flood hero, as well as a short version of the flood story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.1.8.1.3# |title=The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature; The death of Gilgameš (three versions, translated)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] versions of the unified epic are dated to ca. 2000–1500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew George, page 101, "Early Second Millennium BC" in Old Babylonian&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the fragmentary nature of these Old Babylonian versions, it is unclear whether they included an expanded account of the flood myth; although one fragment definitely includes the story of Gilgamesh’s journey to meet [[Utnapishtim]]. The "standard" Akkadian version included a long version of the flood story and was edited by [[Sin-liqe-unninni]] sometime between 1300 and 1000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew George, pages xxiv–xxv&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Greek===
Noah has often been compared to [[Deucalion]], the son of [[Prometheus]] and [[Pronoia]] in [[Greek mythology]]. Like Noah, Deucalion is warned of the flood (by [[Zeus]] and [[Poseidon]]); he builds an ark and staffs it with creatures – and when he completes his voyage, gives thanks and takes advice from the gods on how to repopulate the Earth. Deucalion also sends a pigeon to find out about the situation of the world and the bird returns with an olive branch.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/159650/Deucalion Deucalion].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wajdenbaum, P., [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=3kiPBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA92&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q=noah&amp;f=false ''Argonauts of the Desert: Structural Analysis of the Hebrew Bible''], Routledge, 2014, pp. 104–108.&lt;/ref&gt; Deucalion, in some versions of the myth, also becomes the inventor of wine, like Noah.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, G., [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=G9IQt92pbjwC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;dq=noah+deucalion&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BkykVOSEEor0UPvkgbgK&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAjgU#v=onepage&amp;q=noah%20deucalion&amp;f=false ''Greek and Roman Folklore: A Handbook''], Greenwood Publishing Group, 2006. pp. 129–130.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philo]]&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, JP.; Lewis, JP., [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mO_H2lVTyhkC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;dq=the+Interpretation+of+Noah&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zLOqVK-iH4byUKXXgrAL&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=philo%20noah&amp;f=false ''A Study of the Interpretation of Noah and the Flood in Jewish and Christian Literature''], BRILL, 1968, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Justin (historian)|Justin]] equate Deucalion with Noah, and [[Josephus]] used the story of Deucalion as evidence that the flood actually occurred and that, therefore, Noah existed.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, DM., [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MXU3PTrFe6gC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=deucalion+noah&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5-SmVMeWBcb0UqaAgrAO&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=manu%20noah&amp;f=false ''Noah Traditions in the Dead Sea Scrolls: Conversations and Controversies of Antiquity''], Society of Biblical Lit, 2008, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, LH., [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=S349d-yRgCIC&amp;pg=PA166&amp;dq=noah+josephus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vcCqVIXgLcKAU_7Lg6AL&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=deucalion&amp;f=false ''Josephus's Interpretation of the Bible''], University of California Press, 1998, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious views==

===Judaism===
{{See also|Noah in rabbinic literature|Noach (parsha)}}
[[File:Ararat Ms. 11639 521a.jpg|205px|left|thumb|A Jewish depiction of Noah]]
The righteousness of Noah is the subject of much discussion among rabbis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/11571-noah#anchor5 |title=JewishEncyclopedia.com – Noah – His Marriage}}&lt;/ref&gt; The description of Noah as "righteous in his generation" implied to some that his perfection was only relative: In his generation of wicked people, he could be considered righteous, but in the generation of a ''[[tzadik]]'' like [[Abraham]], he would not be considered so righteous. They point out that Noah did not pray to God on behalf of those about to be destroyed, as Abraham prayed for the wicked of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]]. In fact, Noah is never seen to speak; he simply listens to God and acts on his orders. This led some commentators to offer the figure of Noah as "the man in a fur coat," who ensured his own comfort while ignoring his neighbour.&lt;ref&gt;Mamet, D., Kushner, L., [https://books.google.com/?id=Gr0SAQAAIAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=+%22man+in+a+fur+coat%22 ''Five Cities of Refuge: Weekly Reflections on Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy''], Schocken Books, 2003, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as the medieval commentator [[Rashi]], held on the contrary that the building of the Ark was stretched over 120 years, deliberately in order to give sinners time to repent. Rashi interprets his father's statement of the naming of Noah (in Hebrew נֹחַ) "This one will comfort us (in Hebrew– yeNaHamainu יְנַחֲמֵנו) in our work and in the toil of our hands, which come from the ground that the Lord had cursed",&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|5:29|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; by saying Noah heralded a new era of prosperity, when there was easing (in Hebrew – nahah – נחה) from the curse from the time of Adam when the Earth produced thorns and thistles even where men sowed wheat and that Noah then introduced the plow.&lt;ref&gt;Frishman, J., Rompay, L. von, [https://books.google.com/?id=SqThaPjXFyQC&amp;pg=PA63#v=onepage&amp;q=noah%20righteous&amp;f=false ''The Book of Genesis in Jewish and Oriental Christian Interpretation: A Collection of Essays''], Peeters Publishers, 1997, pp. 62–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'', "The [[Book of Genesis]] contains two accounts of Noah." In the first, Noah is the hero of the flood, and in the second, he is the father of mankind and a husbandman who planted the first vineyard. "The disparity of character between these two narratives has caused some critics to insist that the subject of the latter account was not the same as the subject of the former." Perhaps the original name of the hero of the flood was actually ''Enoch''.&lt;ref&gt;''Jewish Encyclopedia'': Noah. [http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/11571-noah#anchor11 Critical View]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Encyclopedia Judaica]] notes that Noah's drunkenness is not presented as reprehensible behavior. Rather, "It is clear that ... Noah’s venture into viticulture provides the setting for the castigation of Israel’s Canaanite neighbors." It was Ham who committed an offense when he viewed his father’s nakedness. Yet, "Noah’s curse, ...is strangely aimed at Canaan rather than the disrespectful Ham." (p.&amp;nbsp;288)&lt;ref name=Skolnik287 /&gt;

===Christianity===
[[File:Noah catacombe.jpg|150px|right|thumb|An early Christian depiction showing Noah giving the gesture of [[orant]] as the dove returns]]
[http://www.bibler.org/versions/nasb/nasb_2peter02_sml.htm#2peter_2:5 2 Peter 2:5] refers to Noah as a "preacher of righteousness". In the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke, Jesus compares Noah's flood with the coming [[Last Judgement|Day of Judgement]]: "Just as it was in the days of Noah, so too it will be in the days of the coming of the [[Son of man (Christianity)|Son of Man]]. For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark; and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away. That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man."&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 24:38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luke 17:26&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[First Epistle of Peter]] compares the saving power of [[baptism]] with the Ark saving those who were in it. In later Christian thought, the Ark came to be compared to the [[Christian Church|Church]]: [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] was to be found only within Christ and his Lordship, as in Noah's time it had been found only within the Ark. [[St Augustine of Hippo]] (354–430), demonstrated in ''[[The City of God (book)|The City of God]]'' that the dimensions of the Ark corresponded to the dimensions of the human body, which corresponds to the [[body of Christ]]; the equation of Ark and Church is still found in the [[Anglican]] rite of baptism, which asks God, "who of thy great mercy didst save Noah," to receive into the Church the infant about to be baptised.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, DM., [https://books.google.com/?id=MXU3PTrFe6gC#v=snippet&amp;q=nuanced%20%22temple%20period%22%20%22and%20early%20christianity%22&amp;f=false ''Noah Traditions in the Dead Sea Scrolls: Conversations and Controversies of Antiquity''], Society of Biblical Lit, 2008, pp. 15–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[History of medieval Christianity|medieval Christianity]], Noah's three sons were generally considered as the founders of the populations of the three known [[continent]]s, [[Japheth]]/Europe, [[Shem]]/Asia, and [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]]/Africa, although a rarer variation held that they represented the three classes of medieval society – the priests (Shem), the warriors (Japheth), and the peasants (Ham). In medieval Christian thought, Ham was considered to be the ancestor of the people of black Africa. So, in racialist arguments, the curse of Ham became a justification for the slavery of the black races.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, JP., Weidman, NM., [https://books.google.com/?id=g4WalMw26IkC&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q=noah%20christianity%20medieval%20shem&amp;f=false ''Race, Racism, and Science: Social Impact and Interaction''], ABC-CLIO, 2004, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Isaac Newton]], in his religious works on the development of religion, wrote about Noah and his offspring. In Newton's view, while Noah was a monotheist, the gods of pagan antiquity are identified with Noah and his descendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |last=Force |first=J E |chapter=Essay 12: Newton, the "Ancients" and the "Moderns"  |editor-last1= Popkin |editor-first1=RH |editor-last2=Force |editor-first2=JE |url=https://books.google.com/?id=gJKaqMDxyL0C&amp;pg=PA254#v=onepage&amp;q=noah%20religion&amp;f=false |title=Newton and Religion: Context, Nature, and Influence |publisher=Kluwer |year=1999 |pages=253–254 |via=Google Books |series=International Archive of the History of Ideas |number =No 161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mormon theology====
In [[Mormonism|Mormon theology]], Noah plays an important role, prior to his birth, as the angel [[Gabriel]], and then lived in his mortal life as the patriarch-prophet Noah. Gabriel and Noah are regarded as the same individual under different names.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution-url= https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bd/noah?lang=eng |contribution= Noah |title= [[Bible Dictionary (LDS Church)|Bible Dictionary]] |series= [[LDS edition of the Bible|KJV (LDS)]] |publisher= [[LDS Church]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution-url= https://www.lds.org/scriptures/gs/noah-bible-patriarch?lang=eng |contribution= Noah, Bible Patriarch |title= Study Helps: The Guide to the Scriptures |series= [[Standard works]] |publisher= [[LDS Church]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mormons]] also believe that Noah returned to earth as Gabriel after his earthly life&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |chapter-url= https://www.lds.org/manual/teachings-joseph-smith/chapter-8?lang=eng |chapter= Chapter 8: The Everlasting Priesthood |title= [[Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith]] |year= 2001 |pages= 101–113 |publisher= LDS Church }}&lt;/ref&gt; and appeared to [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] to teach him about the [[Second Coming]]; to [[Zechariah (priest)|Zacharias]], the father of [[John the Baptist]]; and to [[Latter Day Saint views on Mary|Mary]], the mother of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= https://www.lds.org/ensign/2014/02/noah?lang=eng |title= Old Testament Prophets: Noah |journal= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |date= February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noah is considered the head of a [[Dispensation (period)|dispensation]] along with [[Adam and Eve (LDS Church)|Adam]], [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]], [[Abraham]], [[Moses]], [[Jesus]] and [[Joseph Smith]]. A dispensation is a period of time in which the Lord has at least one authorized servant on earth who bears the keys of the holy priesthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution-url= https://www.lds.org/scriptures/gs/dispensation?lang=eng |contribution= Dispensation |title= Study Helps: The Guide to the Scriptures |series= [[Standard works]] |publisher= LDS Church }}&lt;/ref&gt; Noah became the means by which the gospel of Jesus Christ— the [[plan of salvation (Latter Day Saints)|plan of salvation]] —is revealed anew, the means by which divine transforming powers, including saving covenants and ordinances, are extended to people during an age of time called a dispensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= https://www.lds.org/ensign/1994/06/joseph-smith-among-the-prophets?lang=eng |title= Joseph Smith among the Prophets |first= Robert L. |last= Millet |authorlink= Robert L.

===Islam===
{{Main|Noah in Islam}}
[[File:Noah's Ark by Miskin.jpg|thumb|left|An Islamic depiction of Noah in a 16th-century [[Mughal painting|Mughal miniature]].]]
Noah is a highly important figure in [[Islam]] and he is seen as one of the most significant of all prophets. The [[Quran]] contains 43 references to Noah, or ''Nuḥ'', in 28 chapters, and the seventy-first chapter, [[Nuh (surah)|''Sūrat Nūḥ'']] ({{lang-ar|سورة نوح}}), is named after him. His life is also spoken of in the commentaries and in Islamic legends.

Noah's narratives largely cover his preaching as well the story of the [[Flood myth|Deluge]]. Noah's narrative sets the prototype for many of the subsequent prophetic stories, which begin with the prophet warning his people and then the community rejecting the message and facing a punishment.

Noah has several titles in Islam, based primarily on praise for him in the Qur'an, including "True Messenger of God" (XXVI: 107) and "Grateful Servant of God" (XVII: 3).&lt;ref name=Skolnik287 &gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Skolnik|first1=Fred|last2=Berenbaum|first2=Michael|title=Encyclopaedia Judaica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JD0OAQAAMAAJ|year=2007|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA|isbn=978-0-02-865943-5|pages=287–291}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Enc Islam"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Gibb|first=Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen|authorlink=Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen Gibb|title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam: NED-SAM|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OO4pAQAAMAAJ|year=1995|publisher=Brill|pages=108–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Qur'an focuses on several instances from Noah's life more than others, and one of the most significant events is the Flood. God makes a [[covenant (biblical)|covenant]] with Noah just as he did with Abraham, [[Moses]], [[Jesus]] and [[Muhammad]] later on (33:7). Noah is later reviled by his people and reproached by them for being a mere human messenger and not an angel (10:72–74). Moreover, the people mock Noah's words and call him a liar (7:62), and they even suggest that Noah is possessed by a devil when the prophet ceases to preach (54:9). Only the lowest in the community join Noah in believing in God's message (11:29), and Noah's narrative further describes him preaching both in private and public. Noah prays to God, "Lord, leave not one single family of Infidels from the land: / For if thou leave them they will beguile thy servants and will beget only sinners, infidels."{{dead link|date=March 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://http//www.quranbrowser.com/%20%22family 71:26–27 Rodwell 1876 version]{{dead link|date=March 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Qur'an narrates that Noah received a revelation to build an [[Noah's Ark|Ark]], after his people refused to believe in his message and hear the warning. The narrative goes on to describe that waters poured forth from the Heavens, destroying all the sinners. Even one of his sons disbelieved him, stayed behind, and was drowned. After the Flood ended, the Ark rested atop [[Mount Judi]] ({{cite quran|11|44|s=ns}}).
[[File:Noah's ark and the deluge.JPG|thumb|Noah's ark and the deluge from Zubdat-al Tawarikh]]
Also, Islamic beliefs deny the idea of Noah being the first person to drink wine and experience the aftereffects of doing so.&lt;ref name=Skolnik287 /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Enc Islam"/&gt;

{{cite quran|29|14|s=ns}} states that Noah had been living among the people who he was sent to for 950 years when the flood started.
{{quote|And, indeed, [in times long past] We sent forth Noah unto his people, and he dwelt among them a thousand years bar fifty; and then the floods overwhelmed them while they were still lost in evildoing.}}

According to the [[Ahmadiyya]] understanding of the Quran, the period described in the Quran is the age of his [[Dispensation (period)|dispensation]], which extended until the time of [[Abraham in Islam|Ibrahim]] (Abraham, 950 years). The first 50 years were the years of spiritual progress, which were followed by 900 years of spiritual deterioration of the people of Noah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://www.alislam.org/library/books/HadhratNuh.pdf | title=Hadhrat Nuh | author=Rashid Ahmad Chaudhry | publisher=Islam International Publications |isbn=1-85372-758-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gnostic===
An important Gnostic text, the ''[[Apocryphon of John]]'', reports that the chief [[archon (Gnosticism)|archon]] caused the flood because he desired to destroy the world he had made, but the First Thought informed Noah of the chief archon's plans, and Noah informed the remainder of humanity. Unlike the account of Genesis, not only are Noah's family saved, but many others also heed Noah's call. There is no ark in this account. According to [[Elaine Pagels]], "Rather, they hid in a particular place, not only Noah, but also many other people from the unshakable race. They entered that place and hid in a bright cloud."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Pagels|first=Elaine|authorlink=Elaine Pagels|title=The Gnostic Gospels|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sOfrvFT7RVYC|year=2013|publisher=Orion|isbn=978-1-78022-670-5|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bahá'í===
The [[Bahá'í Faith]] regards the Ark and the Flood as symbolic.&lt;ref&gt;From a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi, October 28, 1949: Bahá'í News, No. 228, February 1950, p. 4. Republished in {{harvnb|Compilation |1983|p=508}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Bahá'í belief, only Noah's followers were spiritually alive, preserved in the ark of his teachings, as others were spiritually dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first = Brent|last = Poirier|title = The Kitab-i-Iqan: The key to unsealing the mysteries of the Holy Bible|url = http://bahai-library.com/poirier_iqan_unsealing_bible|accessdate = 2007-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shoghi Effendi |authorlink=Shoghi Effendi |year=1971 |title=Messages to the Bahá'í World, 1950–1957 |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn=0-87743-036-5 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/MBW/ |page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bahá'í scripture ''[[Kitáb-i-Íqán]]'' endorses the Islamic belief that Noah had a large number of companions, either 40 or 72, besides his family on the Ark, and that he taught for 950 (symbolic) years before the flood.&lt;ref&gt;From a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer, November 25, 1950.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5365">'''Pieros Voidis Mavromichalis''' ({{lang-el|Πιέρος Βοϊδής Μαυρομιχάλης}}) was a military leader of the [[Greek Revolution of 1821]]. He was born in [[Mani Peninsula|Mani]] and he was killed in action on 20 May 1825, during the [[battle of Maniaki]] between Greek revolutionaries and the Egyptian forces of [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]].

==Biography==

Voidis was cousin of [[Petrobey Mavromichalis]]&lt;ref&gt;Apostolos E. Vakalopoulos [Απόστολος Ε. Βακαλόπουλος], Ιστορία του Νέου Ελληνισμού, vol. 7 (Ζ'), Θεσσαλονίκη 1986, p.113.&lt;/ref&gt; and he was considered as one of the most prominent military leaders of Mani, even before the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Amvrosios Frantzis [Αμβρόσιος Φραντζής], Επιτομή της Ιστορίας της αναγεννηθείσης Ελλάδος αρχομένη από του έτους 1715, και λήγουσα το 1837, Εν Αθήναις, 1841, p.152.&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 March 1821 he took part in the liberation of [[Kalamata]].&lt;ref name=a&gt;Fotios Chrysanthopoulos [Φώτιος Χρυσανθόπουλος], Βίοι Πελοποννησίων ανδρών και των εξώθεν εις την Πελοπόννησον ελθόντων κληρικών, στρατιωτικών και πολιτικών των αγωνισαμένων τον αγώνα της επαναστάσεως. Αθήναι 1888, p.253.&lt;/ref&gt; and shortly after that, Voidis, Petrobey and Mourtzinos offered 270 men to [[Theodoros Kolokotronis]], as he decided to continue towards [[Arcadia]].&lt;ref&gt;Dionysios Kokkinos [Διονύσιος Κόκκινος], Η Ελληνική Επανάστασις, εκδόσεις Μέλισσα, έκτη έκδοσις, Αθήναι, 1974, vol. Α', p.184.&lt;/ref&gt;

A few days later, on 28 March, participated in the battle of Agios Athanasios, in which the rebels tried to prevent the retreat of the Muslims of Fanari to [[Tripolitsa]]. During the severe conflict Voidis was injured and was taken away from the battlefield by his men while the battle resulted in a Greek victory and the death of approximately 500 Turks, including many civilians who followed their armed compatriots.&lt;ref&gt;Dionysios Kokkinos [Διονύσιος Κόκκινος], Η Ελληνική Επανάστασις, εκδόσεις Μέλισσα, έκτη έκδοσις, Αθήναι, 1974, vol. Α', p.358.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Voidis took part in a series of military operations in [[Peloponnese]], mainly in the region of [[Argolis]].&lt;ref name=a/&gt; He also managed to become one of the most important lieutenants of Kolokotronis.&lt;ref&gt;Σύγχρονος Εγκυκλοπαίδεια Ελευθερουδάκη, έκδοσις πέμπτη - εκσυγχρονισμένη δια συμπληρώματος κατά τόμον, vol. 17, p.232.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1825, Voidis reinforced [[Papaflessas]] in Maniaki with 120 men, because of the impending battle against the Egyptian forces of Ibrahim Pasha. He was in charge of the southernmost of the three strongholds. Papaflessas and his brother Dimitrios Dikaios&lt;ref&gt;Fotios Chrysanthopoulos [Φώτιος Χρυσανθόπουλος], Βίος του παπά Φλέσα, Εν Αθήναις, 1868, p.55, 57.&lt;/ref&gt; were in charge of the other two. The stronghold defended by Voidis and the other Maniots was the strongest of the three and the last that was seized by enemy forces. In fact, the Greek soldiers that had managed to stay alive from the other two retreated there. However, during the battle, Voidis was killed&lt;ref&gt;Fotios Chrysanthopoulos [Φώτιος Χρυσανθόπουλος], Βίος του παπά Φλέσα, Εν Αθήναις, 1868, p.66.&lt;/ref&gt; just like Papaflessas, Dimitrios Dikaios and [[Panagiotis Kefalas]].

{{Rick Perry series}}
'''James Richard "Rick" Perry''' (born March 4, 1950) is an American politician who is the 14th and current [[United States Secretary of Energy]], serving in the [[Cabinet of Donald Trump]]. Prior to his cabinet position, Perry served as the [[List of Governors of Texas|47th]] [[Governor of Texas]] from December 2000 to January 2015. A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], he was elected [[Lieutenant Governor of Texas]] in 1998 and assumed the governorship in December 2000 when Governor [[George W. Bush]] resigned to become president. Perry was the longest-serving Governor in Texas history.

Perry was elected three times to full gubernatorial terms and is the fourth Texas Governor (after [[Allan Shivers]], [[Price Daniel]] and [[John Connally]]) to serve three terms. With a tenure in office of 14 years, 30 days, Perry was, at the time he left office, the second longest-serving current governor (after [[Terry Branstad]] of Iowa). Perry ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination for president in [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012]] and [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016]].

On December 14, 2016, President-elect [[Donald Trump]] announced his intention to nominate Perry as his [[United States Secretary of Energy|Secretary of Energy]]. On March 2, 2017, he was confirmed by the United States Senate in a 62–37 vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://decisiondeskhq.com/vote-tracker/confirmation-vote-of-rick-perry-for-secretary-of-energy/|title=Confirmation Vote of Rick Perry for Secretary of Energy {{!}} Decision Desk HQ|date=March 2, 2017|work=Decision Desk HQ|access-date=March 2, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
A fifth-generation Texan, he was born on March 4, 1950, in [[Haskell, Texas]], and raised in [[Paint Creek, Texas]], the son of [[Dryland farming|dryland]] cotton farmers Joseph Ray Perry and Amelia June Holt Perry. He has one older sister. Perry's ancestry is almost entirely English, dating as far back as the original [[Thirteen Colonies]]. His family has been in Texas since before the [[Texas Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/celeb/perry.htm|title=rick perry|publisher=Freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com|accessdate=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.surnamedb.com/Surname/Perry|title=Surname Database: Perry Last Name Origin|publisher=Surnamedb.com|accessdate=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His father, a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], was a long-time Haskell County commissioner and [[school board]] member. Perry has said that his interest in politics probably began in November 1961, when his father took him to the funeral of U.S. Representative [[Sam Rayburn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Richard L.

Perry was in the [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]] (BSA) and earned the rank of [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]].&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.governor.state.tx.us/about|title=Texas Governor Rick Perry|publisher=Office of the Governor|accessdate=November 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="perryCNSNEWS"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewCulture.asp?Page=/Culture/archive/200802/CUL20080211b.html|title=Texas Governor Urges Protection for Boy Scouts of America|last=Lucas|first=Fred|publisher=[[Cybercast News Service]]|date=February 11, 2008|archivedate=May 18, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518183709/http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewCulture.asp?Page=%2FCulture%2Farchive%2F200802%2FCUL20080211b.html|accessdate=August 12, 2011|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BSA has honored Perry with the [[Distinguished Eagle Scout Award]].&lt;ref name="PerryDESA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scouting.org/filestore/pdf/02-529.pdf|title=Distinguished Eagle Scout Award|publisher=[[Boy Scouts of America]]|accessdate=November 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perry graduated from [[Paint Creek Independent School District|Paint Creek High School]] in 1968.

===College===
Perry attended [[Texas A&amp;M University]] where he was a member of the [[Texas A&amp;M University Corps of Cadets|Corps of Cadets]] and the [[Alpha Gamma Rho]] fraternity. He was elected senior class social secretary, a member and [[Aggie bonfire leadership|'''redpot''']] in [[Aggie Bonfire]], and one of A&amp;M's five [[Aggie Yell Leaders|"yell leaders"]].&lt;ref name=time20090125&gt;{{cite news|last=Hylton|first=Hilary|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1873143,00.html|title=Bush Returns to a Divided Texas Republican Party|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=January 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/cheerleading-politics/story?id=16380524#5 From Cheerleading to Politics], Abcnews.go.com (May 19, 2012); retrieved September 13, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated in 1972 with a Bachelor of Science degree in animal science.&lt;ref name=aggiestime&gt;{{cite news|last=Hooks|first=Chris|url=http://www.texastribune.org/texas-people/rick-perry/perry-aggie-years|title=Texas A&amp;M Years Launched Perry – and a Rivalry|work=[[The Texas Tribune]]|location=Austin|date=August 2, 2011|accessdate=August 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Trivia question: Which presidential candidate has a degree in economics?|url=http://caucuses.desmoinesregister.com/2011/09/21/trivia-question-which-presidential-candidate-has-a-degree-in-economics/|date=September 21, 2011|first=Jennifer|last=Jacobs|work=[[The Des Moines Register]]|accessdate=November 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, he said that "I was probably a bit of a free spirit, not particularly structured real well for life outside of a military regime, I would have not lasted at [[Texas Tech University|Texas Tech]] or the [[University of Texas]]. I would have hit the fraternity scene and lasted about one semester."&lt;ref name=aggiestime/&gt;

===First jobs===
In the early 1970s, Perry interned during several summers with [[Southwestern Advantage]], as a [[Door-to-door salesman|door-to-door book salesman]]. "I count my time working for Dortch Oldham [then president of the [[Southwestern family of companies]]] as one of the most important formative experiences of my life", Perry said in 2010. "There is nothing that tests your commitment to a goal like getting a few doors closed in your face." He said that "Mr. Oldham taught legions of young people to communicate quickly, clearly and with passion, a lesson that has served me well in my life since then."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nashvillepost.com/news/2009/2/27/dortch_oldham_dies_at_89 |title=Dortch Oldham dies at 89 |accessdate=December 2, 2010 |last=Wood |first=E. Thomas |date=February 27, 2009 |publisher=[[NashvillePost.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon graduation from college in 1972, Perry was commissioned as an officer in the [[United States Air Force]] and completed pilot training in February 1974. He was then assigned as a [[C-130]] pilot with the 772nd Tactical Airlift Squadron at [[Dyess Air Force Base, located in Abilene, Texas]]. Perry's duties included two-month overseas rotations at [[RAF Mildenhall]], located in [[Mildenhall, Suffolk|Mildenhall]], England and [[Rhein-Main Air Base]], located at Frankfurt am Main, Germany. His missions included a 1974 [[U.S. State Department]] drought relief effort in [[Mali]], [[Mauritania]] and [[Chad]], and two years later, earthquake relief in Guatemala.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/26/us/politics/for-rick-perry-air-force-service-broadened-and-narrowed-life.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | title=For Rick Perry, Air Force Service Broadened and Narrowed Life | date=November 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left the [[United States Air Force]] in 1977 with the rank of [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]], returned to Texas, and went into business farming cotton with his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usglc.org/2011/08/12/rick-perry/ |title=Candidates' Corner 2012– Rick Perry |publisher=U.S. Global Leadership Coalition &amp;#124; American Foreign Policy &amp; Foreign Affairs – Usglc.org |date=August 13, 2011 |accessdate=August 18, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514054016/http://www.usglc.org/2011/08/12/rick-perry/ |archivedate=May 14, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early political career==
[[File:Bush Contact Sheet P17939 (cropped2).jpg|thumb|right|Perry with [[President of the United States|President]] [[George H. W. Bush]] in 1990]]

=== Texas Legislature ===
In 1984, Perry was elected to the [[Texas House of Representatives]] as a Democrat from district 64, which included his home county of [[Haskell County, Texas|Haskell]]. He served on the House Appropriations and Calendars committees during his three two-year terms in office. He befriended fellow freshman state representative [[Lena Guerrero]], a staunch liberal Democrat who endorsed Perry's reelection bid in 2006.

Perry was part of the "Pit Bulls", a group of Appropriations members who sat on the lower dais in the committee room (or "pit") who pushed for austere state budgets during the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/onpolitics/post/2011/07/rick-perry-presidential-race-former-democrat/1 |title=GOP's Rick Perry spent early years as a Democrat |first=Catalina |last=Camia |work=USA Today |date=July 15, 2011 |accessdate=August 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one point, ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' named him one of the ten most effective members of the legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=71st Legislature, 6th C.S., HR63. |url=http://www.lrl.state.tx.us/scanned/members/honorary/71/Perry_Rick_HR63.pdf |year=1990 |publisher=Legislative Reference Library of Texas |accessdate=August 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Perry voted for a $5.7 billion tax increase proposed by Republican governor [[Bill Clements]].&lt;ref&gt;Jay Root, [http://www.texastribune.org/texas-politics/2012-presidential-election/rick-perry-democrat-years/ Rick Perry: The Democrat Years] ''[[The Texas Tribune]]'' July 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Perry supported [[Al Gore]] in the 1988 Democratic presidential primaries and worked for Gore's campaign in Texas.&lt;ref name="poli_Rick"&gt;{{cite web | title = Rick Perry backed Al Gore, didn't lead his Texas campaign | last = Selby | first = W.

=== Agriculture Commissioner ===
In 1990, as a newly minted Republican, Perry challenged [[Jim Hightower]], the incumbent Democratic [[Texas Agriculture Commissioner|Agriculture Commissioner]]. [[Karl Rove]] was Perry's campaign manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bickerstaff|first1=Steve|title=Lines in the Sand: Congressional Redistricting in Texas and the Downfall of Tom DeLay|date=2010|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=9780292783058|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Republican primary on March 13, 1990, Perry polled 276,558 votes (47%), with [[Richard McIver]] garnering 176,976 votes (30%) and Gene L. Duke, who placed third, polling 132,497 votes (23%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=783049|title=TX Agriculture Commissioner – R Primary Race – Mar 13, 1990|work=Our Campaigns|accessdate=February 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Perry fell shy of the necessary 50% to win outright, a runoff was held between Perry and McIver set on April 10, 1990. In the runoff, he emerged victorious, garnering 96,649 votes (69%) to McIver's 43,921 votes (31%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=783050|title=TX Agriculture Commissioner – R Runoff Race |date=April 10, 1990|work=Our Campaigns|accessdate=February 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1990, Hightower's office was embroiled in an FBI investigation into corruption and bribery. Three aides were convicted in 1993 of using public funds for political fundraising, although Hightower himself was not found to be involved in the wrongdoings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120302061411/http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl/1993_1166833/three-ex-aides-to-hightower-are-sentenced.html Three ex-aides to Hightower are sentenced] [[Houston Chronicle]]. November 11, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Perry narrowly defeated Hightower in November 1990, garnering 1,864,463 votes (49%) to Hightower's 1,820,145 votes (48%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=309970 |title=TX Agriculture Commissioner Race |date=November 6, 1990 |publisher=Our Campaigns|accessdate=February 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rove raised $3 million to raise Perry's profile, "while tarnishing the name of Jim Hightower" resulting in Perry's name becoming a "household name in Texas—and Hightower's name synonymous with corruption".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lou Dubose|author2=Jan Reid|author3=Carl M.

As Agriculture Commissioner, Perry was responsible for promoting the sale of Texas farm produce to other states and foreign nations, and for supervising the calibration of weights and measures, such as [[gasoline]] pumps and [[grocery store]] scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agr.state.tx.us/agr/main_render/0,1968,1848_8330_0_0,00.html?channelId=8330 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822090027/http://www.agr.state.tx.us/agr/main_render/0%2C1968%2C1848_8330_0_0%2C00.html?channelId=8330 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 22, 2006 |title=What is the Texas Department of Agriculture? |publisher=Texas Department of Agriculture |accessdate=August 18, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1993, Perry, while serving as Texas agriculture commissioner, expressed support for the effort [[Health care reform in the United States|to reform]] the nation's healthcare, describing it as "most commendable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2011/sep/24/ron-paul/ron-paul-says-rick-perry-wrote-letter-supporting-h/|title=Ron Paul says Rick Perry wrote a letter supporting Hillarycare|date=September 24, 2011|work=[[Austin American-Statesman]] / [[PolitiFact.com]]|accessdate=October 18, 2011|first=Meghan|last=Ashford-Grooms}}&lt;/ref&gt; The healthcare plan, first revealed in September, was ultimately [[Clinton health care plan of 1993#Defeat|unsuccessful]] due to Republican congressional opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Perry-letter-commending-Hillary-Clinton-found-1914428.phpa|title=Perry letter commending Hillary Clinton found|date=March 29, 2005|work=Houston Chronicle|author=R.G.

In 1994, Perry was reelected Agriculture Commissioner by a large margin, getting 2,546,287 votes (62 percent) to Democrat Marvin Gregory's 1,479,692 (36 percent).

===Lieutenant Governor===
In 1998, Perry ran for the powerful job of [[Lieutenant Governor of Texas|Lieutenant Governor]]. During this election, Perry had a notable falling out with his previous top political strategist Karl Rove, which began the much-reported rivalry between the [[George W.

Perry became the state's [[List of lieutenant governors of Texas|first Republican lieutenant governor since Reconstruction]], taking office on January 19, 1999.

Bush]]—who was preparing to become [[President of the United States]].&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; He won the office in his own right in the [[Texas gubernatorial election, 2002|2002 gubernatorial election]], where he received 58% of votes to Laredo oilman and businessman [[Tony Sanchez (politician)|Tony Sanchez]]'s 40%.&lt;ref name="1994 General Election" /&gt; He was re-elected in the [[Texas gubernatorial election, 2006|2006 gubernatorial election]] against three major opponents, polling 39% of votes against runner-up former U.S. Congressman [[Chris Bell (politician)|Chris Bell]] of Houston with 30%. In the [[Texas gubernatorial election, 2010|2010 gubernatorial election]], Perry became the first Texas governor to be elected to three four-year terms, polling 55% of votes to former Houston Mayor [[Bill White (Texas politician)|Bill White]]'s 42%.

According to [[Texans for Public Justice]], in his three gubernatorial campaigns, Perry received hard-money campaign contributions of $102 million, half of which came from 204 donors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Taibbi | first = Matt | author-link = Matt Taibbi | title = Rick Perry: The Best Little Whore In Texas| newspaper = [[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]] | date = October 26, 2011| url = https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/rick-perry-the-best-little-whore-in-texas-20111026?page=3 | accessdate = November 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2001 legislative session, Perry set a record for his use of the [[veto]], rejecting 82 acts, more than any other governor in any single legislative session in the history of the state since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]].&lt;ref name="Vetoes"&gt;[http://texaspolitics.laits.utexas.edu/1_4_2.html "The Executive Branch: Budgetary Powers"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223083855/http://texaspolitics.laits.utexas.edu/1_4_2.html |date=February 23, 2014 }}, ''Texas Politics'', [[University of Texas at Austin]], retrieved June 20, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vetoes 2"&gt;[http://texaspolitics.laits.utexas.edu/1_5_2.html The Limits of the Veto] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228182445/http://texaspolitics.laits.utexas.edu/1_5_2.html |date=February 28, 2014 }}, ''Texas Politics'', [[University of Texas at Austin]], retrieved June 20, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Vetoes – Then and Now|url=http://www.texastribune.org/texas-legislature/82nd-legislative-session/on-the-records-vetoes--then-and-now/|date=June 17, 2011|first=Becca|last=Aaronson|work=[[The Texas Tribune]]|location=Austin|postscript=|accessdate=June 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Perry formed the [[non-profit organization]], the OneStar Foundation, designed to connect non-profits with resources and expertise to accomplish their missions and to promote [[Volunteering|volunteerism]]. He tapped the state Republican chairman [[Susan Weddington]], who stepped down from that position after six years, as the president of OneStar.

In his presidential campaign, Perry highlighted the economic success Texas achieved under his governorship.

A proclaimed proponent of fiscal conservatism, Perry often campaigned on job growth and tax issues, such as his opposition to creating a state [[income tax]].

In 2006, Perry stated that he believes in the [[Biblical inerrancy|inerrancy of the Bible]] and that those who do not accept [[Jesus]] as their Savior will go to hell.

''[[The Washington Post]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The event was criticized as going beyond prayer and fasting to include launching Perry's presidential campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Fikac| first = Peggy| title = Email on voting prompts questions about Perry prayer event| newspaper = [[Houston Chronicle]]| date = August 19, 2011| url = http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Email-on-voting-prompts-questions-about-Perry-2132729.php| accessdate = August 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perry has called himself "a firm believer in [[intelligent design]] as a matter of faith and intellect", and has expressed support for its teaching alongside [[evolution]] in Texas schools, but has also said that "educators and local school officials, not the governor, should determine science curriculum".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gosanangelo.com/news/2010/sep/11/this-series-examines-important-issues-to-texans/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100916041148/http://www.gosanangelo.com/news/2010/sep/11/this-series-examines-important-issues-to-texans/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 16, 2010 |title=2010 The Vote: K-12 Education |work=[[San Angelo Standard-Times]] |date=September 11, 2010 |accessdate=August 18, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
In 2005, Perry said he would not "approve an education budget that shortchanges teacher salary increases, textbooks, education technology, and education reforms. And I cannot let $2 billion sit in some bank account when it can go directly to the classroom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://governor.state.tx.us/news/press-release/3589|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820055259/http://governor.state.tx.us/news/press-release/3589/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=August 20, 2010|title=Press Release: Gov.

Following a second rejection of Perry's bill, Perry asked [[John Sharp (Texas politician)|John Sharp]] to head a task force charged with preparing a bipartisan education plan, which was subsequently adopted.&lt;ref name="CSHB2 Record Vote"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/hjrnl/792/html/79c2day03final.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051130095557/http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/hjrnl/792/html/79c2day03final.htm|archivedate=November 30, 2005|title=Proceedings: Third Day – Tuesday, July 26, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.governor.state.tx.us/priorities/tax_reform/TTRC_report/files/TTRC_report.pdf|title=Gov.

In 2001, Perry expressed his pride in the enactment of the statute extending in-state tuition to [[undocumented immigrants]] who meet Texas' residency requirements. It also required the undocumented students to pledge to apply for permanent residency or citizenship if this became a possibility for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Perry|first=Rick|title=Gov.

===LGBT rights===
[[File:Rick Perry by Gage Skidmore 10.jpg|left|thumb|Perry speaking at the 2015 [[Conservative Political Action Conference]] in National Harbor, Maryland]]
In 2002, Perry described the Texas same-sex [[sodomy law|anti-sodomy law]] as "appropriate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl/2002_3605756/perry-calls-sodomy-law-appropriate.html|title=Perry calls sodomy law 'appropriate{{'-}}|work=[[Houston Chronicle]]|agency=Associated Press|date=December 4, 2002|accessdate=August 19, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202221217/http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl/2002_3605756/perry-calls-sodomy-law-appropriate.html|archivedate=February 2, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] struck down the statute in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', determining that it violated the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution]].

In his 2010 book, Perry referenced the ''Lawrence'' decision, writing "Texans have a different view of the world than do the nine oligarchs in robes."&lt;ref name="Saenz"&gt;Arlette Saenz, [http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/12/perry-draws-blank-on-landmark-texas-anti-sodomy-supreme-court-case/ Perry Draws Blank on Landmark Texas Anti-Sodomy Supreme Court Case], ABC News, December 29, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Perry admitted that he did not know about the ''Lawrence'' decision; when told that the Supreme Court case had struck down Texas's anti-sodomy law, Perry said: "I'm not taking the [[bar exam]] ... I don't know what a lot of legal cases involve ... [M]y position on traditional marriage is clear ... I don't need a federal law case to explain it to me."&lt;ref name="Saenz"/&gt;

Perry supported [[Texas Proposition 2 (2005)|Texas Proposition 2 in 2005]], a ballot proposition that [[List of former U.S. state constitutional amendments banning same-sex unions by type|amended the Texas constitution by defining marriage]] as "only a union between a man and a woman" and prohibiting the state from creating or recognizing "any legal status identical or similar to marriage" (such as [[civil union]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Same-sex marriage ban wins OK|url=http://www.chron.com/default/article/Same-sex-marriage-ban-wins-OK-1933429.php|date=November 8, 2005|first=Janet|last=Elliott|work=[[Houston Chronicle]]|accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, after [[Marriage Equality Act (New York)|New York legalized same-sex marriage]], Perry stated that it was their right to do so under the principle of [[states' rights]] in the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://caucuses.desmoinesregister.com/2011/07/23/perry-defends-gay-marriage-as-a-states-choice-santorum-takes-a-swipe/|title=Perry defends gay marriage as states' choice; Santorum takes a swipe|first=Jennifer|last=Jacobs|work=[[The Des Moines Register]]|date=July 23, 2011|accessdate=August 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesman later reiterated Perry's support for a [[Federal Marriage Amendment|federal constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage]], saying that position was not inconsistent, since an amendment would require ratification by three-fourths of the states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jul/28/news/la-pn-perry-gay-marriage-20110728|title=Rick Perry contorts over same-sex marriage|first=Mark Z.|last=Barabak|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=July 28, 2011|accessdate=August 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'' in 2015 that the fundamental right to marry is guaranteed to same-sex couples by the Constitution, Perry condemned the decision, saying: "I'm a firm believer in traditional marriage, and I also believe the 10th Amendment leaves it to each state to decide this issue."&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Rubin, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/06/26/the-gop-contenders-react-to-the-same-sex-marriage-decision/ The GOP contenders react to the same-sex marriage decision], ''The Washington Post'', June 26, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his first book, ''On My Honor'', published in 2008, Perry drew a parallel between [[homosexuality]] and alcoholism, writing that he is "no expert on the 'nature versus nurture' debate" but that gays should simply choose abstinence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://swampland.time.com/2011/08/24/perry-compared-homosexuality-to-alcoholism-in-2008-book|title=Perry Compared Homosexuality to Alcoholism in 2008 Book|date=August 24, 2011|first=Mark|last=Benjamin|work=Time|accessdate=October 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2012 presidential campaign, he criticized the repeal of the "[[don't ask, don't tell]]" policy for the U.S. military.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Rick Perry's Anti-Gay Iowa Ad Divides His Top Staff|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/08/rick-perry-anti-gay-iowa-ad-divides-top-staff_n_1136587.html|date=December 8, 2011|first=Sam|last=Stein|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=February 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perry said using foreign aid as a policy tool against foreign countries that violate the human rights of homosexuals was "not in America's interests" and was part of a "war on traditional American values".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/12/rick-perry-says-human-rights-for-gays-not-in-americas-interests|title=Rick Perry Says Human Rights for Gays 'Not in America's Interests'|publisher=ABC News|date=December 6, 2011|accessdate=February 22, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301081125/http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/12/rick-perry-says-human-rights-for-gays-not-in-americas-interests/|archivedate=March 1, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perry, an Eagle Scout, has called on the [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]] to continue their ban on homosexuality and blamed America for not living up to the ideals of the Scouts.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/us/rick-perry-opposes-opening-boy-scouts-to-gays.html Perry Fights Letting Gays in Boy Scouts], nytimes.com, February 2, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crime===
Perry's campaigns for lieutenant governor and governor focused on a [[Law and order (politics)|tough stance on crime]]. He has supported [[block grant]]s for crime programs.&lt;ref name=NGA10&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Notebook/Note_01-NGA10.htm|title=Public Notes on 01-NGA10|publisher=[[On The Issues]]|date=September 14, 2001|accessdate=August 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeff L. Blackburn, chief counsel of the [[Innocence Project of Texas]], said of Perry that "He has done more good than any other governor we've ever had ... unless, of course, it involves the death penalty. On the [[Rick Perry#Death penalty|death penalty]], Rick Perry has a profound mental block."&lt;ref name=NYTCrimeStance&gt;Sontag, Deborah (October 30, 2011).

In 2007, Perry signed a law ending automatic arrest for [[cannabis]] possession.&lt;ref&gt;Yoder, Steve (November 7, 2011). [http://www.salon.com/2011/11/07/the_gop_tough_on_crime_no_more/ "The GOP, 'tough on crime' no more?"] Salon.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death penalty===

Cases in which Perry has been criticized for his lack of intervention include those of [[Cameron Todd Willingham]] and Mexican nationals [[José Medellín]] and [[Humberto Leal Garcia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=From arson to politics: Why has Texas's governorderailed a death-penalty investigation?|newspaper=[[The Economist]]|date=October 22, 2009|url=http://www.economist.com/node/14699746|accessdate=August 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grann1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Grann|first=David|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/09/07/090907fa_fact_grann|title=Cameron Todd Willingham, Texas, and the death penalty|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=January 7, 2009|accessdate=August 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Graczyk|first=Michael|url=http://www.star-telegram.com/2011/07/08/3209871/criticism-of-texas-execution-of.html|title=Criticism of Texas' execution of Mexican Humberto Leal Garcia doesn't bother Perry|work=[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]|date=July 8, 2011|accessdate=August 7, 2011}}{{dead link|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perry commuted the death sentence of [[Kenneth Foster]], who was convicted of murder despite evidence that he was only present at the scene of the crime. Foster was convicted under a Texas law that makes co-conspirators liable in certain cases of homicide. In this case, it tied Foster to the triggerman. Perry raised doubts about the law and urged the legislature to re-examine the issue. "I believe the right and just decision is to commute Foster's sentence from the death penalty to life imprisonment", Perry said in a statement at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/31/us/31execute.html?_r=1&amp;|newspaper=The New York Times|title=Governor Commutes Sentence in Texas|date=August 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perry also refused to grant a stay of execution in the case of [[Cameron Todd Willingham]] even though an investigation by the [[Texas Forensic Science Commission]] determined parts of the original investigation may not have looked at all of the evidence correctly. Perry called Willingham a "monster" and later replaced the chairman of the Science Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thornton|first1=Paul|title=Cameron Todd Willingham's ghost won't stop haunting Rick Perry|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/opinion-la/la-ol-cameron-todd-willingham-rick-perry-execution-20140806-story.html|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=August 6, 2014|accessdate=May 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infrastructure===
In 2002, Perry proposed the [[Trans-Texas Corridor]], a $175 billion transportation network that would include a 4,000-mile network of highways, rail, and utility lines and would be funded by private investors. Plans for the project were dropped in 2009 in favor of more incremental road projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ruiz|first1=Rosanna|last2=Elliott|first2=Janet|last3=Ratcliffe|first3=R.G.|title=Trans-Texas Corridor plans dropped after public outcry|url=http://www.chron.com/neighborhood/cyfair-news/article/Trans-Texas-Corridor-plans-dropped-after-public-1745411.php|accessdate=13 June 2017|publisher=Houston Chronicle|date=January 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trans-texas Corridor|url=https://www.texastribune.org/tribpedia/trans-texas-corridor/about/|publisher=Texas Tribune|accessdate=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illegal immigration===
During a large surge in [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigration]] through the U.S. southern border in the summer of 2014, Perry criticized U.S. President [[Barack Obama]], saying that the surge was "a humanitarian crisis that he has the ability to stop."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Texas Gov.

In February 2016, Perry was cleared of all charges.&lt;ref&gt;Dann, Carrie. "Texas Court Dismisses Second Felony Charge Against Rick Perry", [[NBC News]] (February 24, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Texas Court of Criminal Appeals]] ruled that courts could not limit [[veto power]] and that prosecuting Perry over his action violates "the [[separation of powers]] provision of the Texas Constitution" and infringed on Perry's [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right to [[freedom of speech]].&lt;ref name="MalewitzTXTrib02242016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Malewitz|first1=Jim|last2=Ramsey|first2=Ross|date=February 24, 2016|title=Texas Court of Criminal Appeals Dismisses Rick Perry Indictment|url=http://www.texastribune.org/2016/02/24/texas-high-court-dismisses-rick-perry-indictments|newspaper=[[Texas Tribune]]|location=[[Austin, Texas]]|accessdate=February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retirement as governor===
{{see also|Political positions of Rick Perry|United States presidential election, 2016}}
By the end of his third full term, he had served more than 14 consecutive years in office. A University of Texas at Austin–''[[Texas Tribune]]'' poll released in June 2013, showed Perry leading potential primary challenger [[Texas Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Greg Abbott]] by double digits, 45–19%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.texastribune.org/2013/06/17/uttt-poll-texans-favor-cruz-over-perry-president/ UT/TT Poll: Texans Favor Cruz Over Perry for President], TexasTribune.org; retrieved August 12, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In February, the same poll had Perry leading by a 3-to-1 margin (49–17%) of 32 points over Abbott.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.texastribune.org/2013/03/04/uttt-poll-perry-starts-ahead-abbott-2014-race UT/TT Poll: Perry Starts Ahead of Abbott in 2014 Race], TexasTribune.org; retrieved on August 12, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Perry decided not to run for re-election to a fourth full term, announcing in front of family and supporters at the [[Holt Manufacturing Company|Holt Cat]] headquarters in [[San Antonio]] on July 8, 2013 that he would retire instead.&lt;ref name="abclocal1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/story?section=news/state&amp;id=9164598|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130711043937/http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/story?section=news%2Fstate&amp;id=9164598|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 11, 2013|title=Texas Gov.

==2012 presidential campaign==
{{main|Rick Perry presidential campaign, 2012}}
[[File:RickPerry Iowa Fair.jpg|thumb|Perry campaigning at the Iowa State Fair, August 14, 2011]]

Perry was considered as a potential candidate since as early as the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]], initially denying he was interested in the office but later becoming more open-minded. He formally launched his campaign on August 13, 2011, in [[Charleston, South Carolina]].&lt;ref name="nyt110813"&gt;{{cite news |first=Ashley |last=Parker |work=[[The New York Times]] |title=Promising Better Direction, Perry Enters Race |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/14/us/politics/14perry.html |date=August 13, 2011 |accessdate=January 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While he was initially successful in fundraising and was briefly considered a serious contender for the nomination, he struggled during the debates and his poll numbers began to decline. After finishing fifth with just over 10% of the vote in the [[Iowa caucuses]] on January 3, 2012, Perry considered dropping out of the presidential race but did not.&lt;ref name="reu120104"&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Whitesides |publisher=Reuters |title=Perry may drop presidential bid after Iowa |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/04/us-usa-campaign-perry-idUSTRE8020LC20120104 |date=January 4, 2012 |accessdate=January 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lat120103"&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael A. |last=Memoli |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |title=Rick Perry suspending campaign after disappointing finish in Iowa caucuses |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-rick-perry-suspend-campaign-20120103,0,7870108.story |date=January 3, 2012 |accessdate=January 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a poor showing in New Hampshire and with "lagging" poll numbers in South Carolina, Perry formally announced he was suspending his campaign on January 19, 2012.&lt;ref name="nyt120119a"&gt;{{Cite news |first1=Jeff |last1=Zeleny |first2=Michael D. |last2=Shear |work=The Caucus |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |title=Perry to End Bid for Presidency |url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/19/perry-to-end-bid-for-presidency/ |date=January 19, 2012 |accessdate=January 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost immediately following the 2012 election, Perry was mentioned as a potential candidate for the presidency in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]], with a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine article in July 2013 saying that "everything is aligned for Rick Perry to be the Republican nominee for president in 2016."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Miller|first1=Zeke|title=Can Anyone Stop Rick Perry In 2016?|url=http://swampland.time.com/2013/07/09/can-anyone-stop-rick-perry-in-2016/|accessdate=May 16, 2015|publisher=Time|date=July 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perry officially launched his 2016 presidential candidacy on June 4, 2015, in [[Addison, Texas]].

On March 2, 2017, Perry was confirmed by the United States Senate in a 62–37 vote.

In November 2017, Perry suggested that using fossil fuels to light dangerous places in Africa could reduce sexual assault, saying, "When the lights are on, when you have light that shines the righteousness, if you will, on those types of acts."

In 2001, the [[American Cowboy Culture Association]], based in [[Lubbock]], handed Perry its "The Top Cowboy of Texas" award. In accepting the honor, Perry cited the importance of his father, Ray Perry, and a former neighbor in Haskell County, the late Watt R. Matthews (born 1899), who Perry said taught him "not only about Texas and [its] history... but also about the importance of the values that we learned growing up in a [[rural]] environment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://lubbockonline.com/stories/102401/loc_1024010044.shtml|first=Dirk|last=Fillpot|title=Perry becomes a driving force|date=October 24, 2001|work=[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]|accessdate=September 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert James Kenneth Peston''' (born 25 April 1960) is a British journalist,  presenter, and founder of the education charity Speakers for Schools. He is the Political Editor of [[ITV News]] and host of the weekly political discussion show ''[[Peston (TV show)|Peston]]'' (previously ''[[Peston on Sunday]]''). From February 2006 until March 2014, he was the Business Editor for [[BBC News]] and Economics Editor from March 2014 to November 2015. He became known to a wider public with his reporting of the [[late-2000s financial crisis]], especially with his [[scoop (news)|scoop]] on [[Nationalisation of Northern Rock|the Northern Rock crisis]].

==Early life and education==
Peston is from a Jewish family and is the son of the late [[Maurice Peston, Baron Peston|Lord Peston]], an economist and Labour [[life peer]], and Helen Conroy. As the son of a life baron, he is entitled to the courtesy title "The Honourable", but does not use it. Peston attended [[Highgate Wood Secondary School]], in [[Crouch End]], [[North London]],&lt;ref name="Telg1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/features/3635393/Robert-Peston-Im-not-going-to-become-smooth-and-phoney.html |title=Robert Peston: 'I'm not going to become smooth and phoney'|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=24 January 2008 |accessdate=8 October 2008 | location=London | first=Elizabeth | last=Grice}}&lt;/ref&gt; graduated from [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]],&lt;ref name=telegraph-20160508/&gt; and then studied at the [[Université Libre de Bruxelles]].&lt;ref name=jc-20080221/&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Robert Peston and crew, 2016 Labour Party Conference.jpg|thumb|Peston with a film crew at the 2016 Labour Party Conference]]
Peston briefly worked as a stockbroker at Williams de Broë,&lt;ref name=DWhite&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2928108/Peston-in-line-as-BBC-voice-of-business.html|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |title=Peston in line as BBC voice of business |first=Dominic |last=White |date=10 December 2005 |accessdate=28 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming a journalist in 1983 at the ''[[Investors Chronicle]]'' and joining ''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper on its launch in 1986. From 1989 to 1990, Peston worked for the short-lived ''[[Sunday Correspondent]]'' newspaper as Deputy City Editor, before being appointed City Editor of the ''[[Independent on Sunday]]'' in 1990.&lt;ref name=telegraph-20160508/&gt;&lt;ref name="JSilverBio"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/dec/19/mondaymediasection7 |title=This man means business at the BBC |author=Silver, James |date=19 December 2005 |accessdate=28 February 2009 |newspaper=The Guardian | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1991 to 2000, he worked for the ''[[Financial Times]]''. At the ''FT'', he was – at various times – Political Editor, Banking Editor and head of an investigations unit&lt;ref name="JSilverBio"/&gt; (which he founded). During his time as Political Editor, he memorably fell out with the then Downing Street Press Secretary [[Alastair Campbell]], who regularly mimicked Peston's habit of flicking back his hair, and once responded to a difficult question with the words: "Another question from the Peston school of smartarse journalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/people,1482,robert-peston-thorn-in-darlings-side,48854 |title=Robert Peston, thorn in Darling's side|date=8 October 2008 |accessdate=28 February 2009 |work=The First Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became close friends with fellow journalist, now PR man, [[Roland Rudd]], where the two were known as the "Pest and the Rat".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/32df3c52-c2f1-11e0-8cc7-00144feabdc0.html|title=The networker|publisher=''Financial Times''|first=Lucy |last=Kellaway|date=12 August 2011|accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His last position at the ''FT'' was Financial Editor (in charge of business and financial coverage).&lt;ref name="JSilverBio"/&gt;

In 2000, he became editorial director of the online financial analysis service Quest,&lt;ref name="JSilverBio"/&gt; owned by the financial firm Collins Stewart. At the same time, he became a contributing editor of ''[[The Spectator]]'' and a weekly columnist for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''. In 2001, he switched allegiance from the ''Telegraph'' to the ''[[Sunday Times]]'', where he wrote a weekly business profile, Peston's People, and left ''The Spectator'' for the ''[[New Statesman]],'' where he wrote a weekly column.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/newswatch/ifs/hi/newsid_4950000/newsid_4950500/4950578.stm |title=Robert Peston |publisher=BBC| date=14 July 2006 |accessdate=28 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, he joined ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'' as City editor and assistant editor. He became associate editor in 2005.&lt;ref name="JSilverBio"/&gt;

In late 2005, it was announced that Peston would succeed [[Jeff Randall (reporter)|Jeff Randall]] as BBC Business Editor, responsible for business and City coverage on the corporation's flagship TV and radio news programmes, the [[BBC News Channel]], its [[BBC Online|website]] and on [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]]'s ''[[Today Programme|Today]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=He may sound like a Dalek doing a bad impression of Kenneth Williams, but why DO so many BBC stars want to exterminate Pesto? |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2063409/He-sound-like-Dalek-doing-bad-impression-Kenneth-Williams-DO-BBC-stars-want-exterminate-Pesto.html |newspaper=[[Daily Mail]] |location=London|first=Andrew| last=Pierce |date=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While no impropriety on the part of Peston was implied, it was claimed in ''The Observer''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/oct/19/bbc-peston-creditcrunch |title=SFO probe |author=Helm, Toby|work=The Guardian|location=London|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 19 October 2008, that the [[Serious Fraud Office (United Kingdom)|Serious Fraud Office]] (SFO) could enquire into the source of one of Peston's scoops which, in September 2008, in the fraught atmosphere of the [[global financial crisis]], revealed that merger talks between [[HBOS]] and [[Lloyds TSB]] were at an advanced stage. In the minutes before the broadcast, buyers purchased millions of HBOS shares at the deflated price of 96p; in the hour following it, they could be sold for 215p. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP [[Greg Hands]] had written to the SFO about this.

On 4 February 2009, Peston appeared as a witness at the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] [[Treasury Select Committee]], along with [[Alex Brummer]] (City Editor, ''[[Daily Mail]]''), [[Lionel Barber]] (editor of the ''[[Financial Times]]''), [[Simon Jenkins|Sir Simon Jenkins]] (''The Guardian'') and [[Sky News]] Business Editor [[Jeff Randall (journalist)|Jeff Randall]] to answer questions on the role of the media in financial stability and "whether financial journalists should operate under any form of reporting restrictions during banking crises."&lt;ref&gt;Treasury Committee [http://webarchive.parliament.uk/20090619012820/http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/treasury_committee/tc0809pn12.cfm Treasury Committee: Press List]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 August 2009, Peston had a highly publicised row with [[James Murdoch (media executive)|James Murdoch]], following the latter's MacTaggart lecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c21media.net/archives/45052|title=Murdoch, Peston in Edinburgh bust-up|publisher=''C21 Media''|first=Adam|last=Benzine|date=29 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/aug/30/robert-peston-james-murdoch-bbc|title=BBC's Robert Peston in furious face-to-face row with James Murdoch|work=The Observer|first1=Leigh|last1=Holmwood|first2=James|last2=Robinson|location=London|date=30 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, he has repeatedly broken stories relating to [[News International]]'s [[News International phone hacking scandal|involvement with phone hacking]] at times which were perceived as advantageous to the company, leading to criticisms that he has become a Murdoch stooge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ianbone.wordpress.com/2011/07/12/bbcs-robert-peston-is-conduit-for-murdoch-leaks-undermining-cop-inquiry-into-corruption/|title=BBC's Robert Peston Is Conduit For Murdoch Leaks Undermining Cop Inquiry Into Corruption|work=Ian Bone|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/press/bbc-in-a-spin-over-robert-pestons-inside-track-to-news-international-2312701.html | title=BBC in a spin over Robert Peston's inside track to News International | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Ian | last=Burrell | date=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peston is the founder of Speakers for Schools, a pro-bono education venture which organises speakers from the worlds of business, politics, media, the arts, science, engineering and sports to give talks for free in state schools.&lt;ref name=telegraph-20160508/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.speakers4schools.org/about-us/|title=About Us – Speakers for Schools|publisher=speakers4schools.org|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 October 2013, Peston was appointed Economics Editor of [[BBC News]], replacing [[Stephanie Flanders]] who was appointed as Chief Market Strategist at [[JP Morgan Asset Management]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; He continued as Business Editor, as well until his replacement [[Kamal Ahmed (journalist)|Kamal Ahmed]] took over the post on 24 March 2014.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news |title=Robert Peston to become BBC economics editor |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24574963 |publisher=BBC News |date=17 October 2013 |accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Delivery style==
Peston's delivery on radio and television news has attracted comment. Richard Wenner complained of it being that of a "verbal slug – leaving a trail of audio slime".  Tim Teeman in ''[[The Times]]'' described his "intonation" as "raggedy [and] querulous" in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Teeman|first1=Tim|title=Bianca barrels back on to EastEnders|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/bianca-barrels-back-on-to-eastenders-tbp5fj878rc|accessdate=13 June 2017|work=The Times|subscription=y|date=2 April 2008|quote=Agggh. What is it with Robert Peston’s raggedy, querulous intonation?}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ann Treneman]] described Peston as "excruciatingly hard to listen to" in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Treneman|first1=Ann|authorlink1=Ann Treneman|title=Appalling delivery, rambling replies but the Robert Peston show is a masterclass|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/appalling-delivery-rambling-replies-but-the-robert-peston-show-is-a-masterclass-v9pq9w7ph9g|accessdate=13 June 2017|work=The Times|subscription=y|date=5 February 2009|quote=But this was the Peston show because Pesto, as he is called, has had a very, very good credit crunch.

Many is the morning when I shout at the radio: 'Spit it out, man!'}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' identifies "strangulated diction" and "repetition of small words" among his traits; in the same article, maintaining he is "loads better than [he] was", Peston himself conceded he is "still not as polished as some".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/portal/main.jhtml?xml=/portal/2008/01/24/ftpeston124.xml|title=Robert Peston Interview|date=24 January 2008|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His characteristic mannerisms have been observed by impressionist [[Rory Bremner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3562776/Bremner,-Bird-and-Fortune-Silly-Money.html|title=Bremner, Bird and Fortune: Silly Money|date=1 November 2008|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peston has stated "I am not going to endeavour to become somebody hugely smooth and polished."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thelondonpaper.typepad.com/thelondonblog/2009/03/cheryl-loses-tv-crown-to-er-bbc-new-man.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330173739/http://thelondonpaper.typepad.com/thelondonblog/2009/03/cheryl-loses-tv-crown-to-er-bbc-new-man.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=30 March 2009 |title=Cheryl loses TV crown to, er, BBC news man |publisher=''thelondonpaper'' |date=27 March 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
Peston published his biography of [[Gordon Brown]], ''Brown's Britain'', in January 2005. It details the rivalry between Brown and the then Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]]. ''Brown's Britain'' was described by [[Howard Davies (economist)|Sir Howard Davies]], former director of the [[London School of Economics]], as "a book of unusual political significance". The cover of the book describes how "Peston was given unprecedented access to Gordon Brown and his friends and colleagues." Having told Brown's side of the Blair/Brown power struggle, it is believed that Peston used the relationship then built up with Brown for many of his later financial news story "scoops" at the BBC.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

In February 2008, [[Hodder &amp; Stoughton]] published Peston's book ''Who Runs Britain? How the Super-Rich are Changing our Lives.'' In ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Polly Toynbee]] said of it: "Reading Peston's book, you can only be flabbergasted all over again at how Labour kowtowed to wealth, glorified the City and put all the nation's economic eggs into one dangerous basket of fizzy finance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/feb/19/labour.economy?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=politics |work=The Guardian |date=19 February 2008 |accessdate=28 February 2009 |title=Labour's election hopes rely on things they don't control |first=Polly|last=Toynbee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, Hodder &amp; Stoughton published ''How Do We Fix This Mess? The Economic Price of Having it All and the Route to Lasting Prosperity''. ''The Observer'' described it as "A must read...mandatory reading for anyone who wants to have a voice in where we go from here."

His latest book ''WTF'' was published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton in November 2017 and charts the events that led up to the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|2016 Brexit referendum]]. [[Vernon Bogdanor]] in the ''Financial Times'' said it was "a deeply thoughtful analysis that should be mandatory reading for anyone seeking to understand where we have gone wrong."{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Personal life==
[[File:Robert Peston, June 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Peston, June 2007]]
Peston married the writer [[Siân Busby]] in 1998, with whom he had a son, Maximilian.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/9526100/Sian-Busby.html Obituary: Siân Busby], telegraph.co.uk, 6 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Peston and Busby had known each other since their teens, and only rekindled their relationship after her friend, Peston's sister Juliet, was hospitalised after a road accident.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Grice [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/features/3635393/Robert-Peston-Im-not-going-to-become-smooth-and-phoney.html "Robert Peston: 'I'm not going to become smooth and phoney'"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 24 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, Busby had married and been divorced from the Dutch film maker Kees Ryninks, with whom she also had a son, Simon.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; Busby died in September 2012 from lung cancer, after a long illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19490209 |title=Robert Peston – Leave of absence |work=BBC |date=5 September 2012 |accessdate=5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He lives in [[Muswell Hill]], north London. After a domestic burglary in December 2012, Peston made an appeal for the return of rings that had belonged to his late wife. Peston said: "It's an incredibly distressing time, especially so soon after losing Siân. It's not about the monetary value, it's about the sentimental value. The rings are irreplaceable and they mean a lot to me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9758431/BBC-business-editor-Robert-Peston-appeals-for-return-of-late-wifes-stolen-rings.html|title=BBC business editor Robert Peston appeals for return of late wife's stolen rings|work=The Daily Telegraph|first=Sam|last=Marsden|location=London|date=20 December 2012|accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018, as part of an interview with '' [[The Sunday Times Magazine]]'', Peston described feeling "desperately guilty" after falling in love with another woman several years after his wife's death. Peston said that he was now in a relationship with Charlotte Edwardes, the diary editor of London's ''[[London Evening Standard|Evening Standard]]''. They met at a Christmas party, and had previously worked together briefly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45617514|title=Peston: I felt guilt after falling in love again|date=23 September 2018|work=BBC News|access-date=23 September 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His family is of Jewish descent.&lt;ref name=telegraph-20160508/&gt; Peston has described himself as "culturally [[Jewish]]".&lt;ref name=jc-20080221&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejc.com/business/business-features/robert-peston-the-bbc-reporter-who-means-business|title=Robert Peston: The BBC reporter who means business|work=The Jewish Chronicle|date=21 February 2008|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He supports [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/robertpeston/2007/01/about_robert_peston.html |title=Peston's Picks: About Robert Peston |work=BBC |accessdate=5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slotnik |date=June 20, 2011 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American stunt performer, television personality, comedian, actor, writer,  musician, and one of the stars of the [[MTV]] reality stunt show ''[[Jackass (TV series)|Jackass]]''.

Dunn rose to fame in the late 1990s as a member of the [[List of CKY Crew members|CKY Crew]] with his long-time friend, [[Bam Margera]], for their extreme stunts and pranks recorded on camera, which led to the rise of ''Jackass''. Dunn also hosted ''[[Homewrecker (TV series)|Homewrecker]]'' and ''[[Proving Ground (TV series)|Proving Ground]]'', and appeared in the feature films ''[[Blonde Ambition]]'' and ''[[Street Dreams (film)|Street Dreams]]'', as well as in Margera's films ''[[Haggard: The Movie|Haggard]]'' and ''[[Minghags: The Movie|Minghags]]''. Dunn died in a car crash in 2011.

== Career ==
Dunn took part in the characteristic stunts that made ''Jackass'' famous, and featured in three released films, ''[[Jackass: The Movie]]'', ''[[Jackass Number Two]]'' and ''[[Jackass 3D]]''.

In [[Gumball 3000#2006|2006]], Dunn and Bam Margera participated in the [[Gumball 3000]] road rally in Margera's [[Lamborghini Gallardo]].&lt;ref name="Gumball 2006"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gtspirit.com/2006/04/12/bam-margera-and-dunn-in-gumball-2006 |title=Bam Margera and Dunn in Gumball 2006 |publisher=GTspirit.com |date=April 12, 2006 |accessdate=July 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later went on a tour with [[Vincent Margera|Don Vito]] called "The Dunn and Vito Rock Tour" for which the DVD was released on March 20, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Margera |first=Bam |url=https://www.amazon.com/Dunn-Vitos-Rock-Tour/dp/B000LPS2PY |title=Dunn &amp; Vito's Rock Tour: Movies &amp; TV: Ryan Dunn, Steve-O, Don Vito |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=June 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dunn and Margera again participated in the rally in [[Gumball 3000#2008|2008]].

Bam Margera stated during a December 2, 2008, radio interview with ''Big O and Dukes'' of 106.7 [[WJFK-FM]], that he and Dunn would be going to Italy to film ''Where the F*%# Are My Ancestors''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wjfk.com/topic/play_window.php?audioType=Episode&amp;audioId=3156296 Interview with Big O and Dukes WJFK 1067] {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same month, Dunn appeared on the episode "[[List of Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit episodes#Season 10|Smut]]" of ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]'' in December 2008. He is also featured in a movie called ''[[Street Dreams (film)|Street Dreams]]'' which was released in spring 2009. He co-starred along with [[Rob Dyrdek]] and [[Paul Rodriguez Jr]]. Dunn was also featured on a show with fellow ''Jackass'' star Bam Margera about them traveling through Europe in a ''Viva la Bam''-like show called ''[[Bam's World Domination]]'' for [[Spike (TV channel)|Spike]].

The film was later renamed ''The Bates Haunting'' and was released in 2013.

== Personal life ==
Dunn was born in [[Medina, Ohio]] and spent much of his childhood in [[Brecksville, Ohio]]. From 2002 to his death, Dunn was in a long-term relationship with Angie Cuturic, who had a part in Margera's directorial debut ''Haggard: The Movie'' and later ''[[Minghags]]''. Dunn had several tattoos of Cuturic, including in his inner arm and left ring finger.&lt;ref name="GlobalGrind"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://globalgrind.com/entertainment/ryan-dunns-girlfriend-angie-cuturic-woman-behind-tragedy-photos |publisher=Global Grind |title=Ryan Dunn's Girlfriend, Angie Cuturic: The Woman Behind The Tragedy (PHOTOS) |author=Global Grind |date=June 24, 2011 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117071706/http://globalgrind.com/entertainment/ryan-dunns-girlfriend-angie-cuturic-woman-behind-tragedy-photos |archivedate=January 17, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During shooting of the closing scenes for ''Jackass Number Two'' in 2006, Dunn injured his shoulder during one of his final bits, where he and co-star [[Bam Margera]] are pulled out of shot by a running horse by a rope tied around their feet. Dunn dropped straight onto his shoulder, causing damage to the muscles and leading to a [[blood clot]] that was at one point life-threatening, due to its proximity to his heart and brain. While seeking treatment for it and [[Lyme disease]], Dunn became depressed, eventually cutting off all contact with his friends, co-workers, and others for nearly two years, and did not participate in ''[[Jackassworld.com: 24 Hour Takeover]]'', or any subsequent events related to the films and series.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;A Tribute to Ryan Dunn: MTV special&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually returned to the Jackass cast in the production of ''Jackass 3D'' and ''[[Jackass 3.5]]'' later saying that he was happy to rejoin the cast and had more enjoyment working on ''Jackass 3D'' than any previous film endeavors.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

He was buried at Highland Drive Cemetery, Brecksville, Ohio.

Hours before the crash, Dunn had posted a photo to his Twitter account of himself and Hartwell drinking at a West Chester bar.&lt;ref name="calher"&gt;{{cite web|work=The Calgary Herald |title=Jackass star Ryan Dunn died of blunt, thermal trauma caused by fiery car wreck: coroner |url=http://www.calgaryherald.com/news/Jackass+star+Ryan+Dunn+died+blunt+thermal+trauma+caused+fiery+wreck+coroner/4983508/story.html |accessdate=June 27, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625021933/http://www.calgaryherald.com/news/Jackass+star+Ryan+Dunn+died+blunt+thermal+trauma+caused+fiery+wreck+coroner/4983508/story.html |archivedate=June 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dunn was identified in the police report as the vehicle's driver,&lt;ref name="policereport"&gt;{{cite news |title=West Goshen Township Police Department, Press Release |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/sites/default/files/westgoshenpdpressrelease.pdf |work=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a subsequent [[toxicology]] report showed Dunn had a blood alcohol level of 0.196 g/dL&amp;nbsp;– more than twice the state's maximum legal limit of 0.08%&lt;!--Pennsylvania http://www.edgarsnyder.com/drunk-driving/statute-limitations/pennsylvania-drunk-driving-laws.html--&gt;.&lt;ref name="Scoop BAC"&gt;{{cite web |title=Ryan Dunn Was Drunk and Speeding: Police |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/ryan-dunn-jackass-blood-alcohol-level-limit/story?id=13902127 |date=June 22, 2011 |accessdate=June 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police report stated "speed may have been a contributing factor in the crash"&lt;ref name="policereport" /&gt; and preliminary investigations suggested the car had been traveling between {{convert|132|and|140|mph}} in a {{convert|55|mph}} zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Police: 'Jackass' star Ryan Dunn was drunk and driving over 132 mph |url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/SHOWBIZ/celebrity.news.gossip/06/22/ryan.dunn.drunk/ |accessdate=June 23, 2011 |publisher=CNN |date=June 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, the parents of Zachary Hartwell filed a [[civil suit]] in the [[Pennsylvania Courts of Common Pleas|Court of Common Pleas]] of [[Philadelphia County]], naming the co-administrators of Dunn's estate as defendants, along with Barnaby's West Chester, the Pennsylvania bar where Dunn drank prior to the fatal crash. The suit claims negligence and recklessness, as well as wrongful death in the incident that killed 30-year-old Hartwell.

The plaintiffs claim that Dunn displayed negligence and recklessness in failing to have his vehicle under adequate and proper control, operating his vehicle under the influence of alcohol, operating his vehicle at an excessive speed and violently veering off a road and into a tree, among other alleged transgressions. They are seeking unspecified punitive and compensatory damages, as well as interest, court costs and "delay damages as the law may allow."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/10/ryan-dunn-lawsuit-estate-sued-parents-dead-passenger_n_1765600.html|title=Ryan Dunn Lawsuit: ‘Jackass’ Star’s Estate Sued By Parents Of Dead Passenger (VIDEO)|first=Huffington|last=Post|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
Dunn is remembered by friends and fans alike as the "go-to guy for outrageous stunts that even such stalwarts as Steve-O weren't willing to try" and  "the kind of guy who would do anything for a friend," gaining the nickname "Random Hero".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1676452/ryan-dunn-dead-2011-news.jhtml |title=Ryan Dunn's Death Shocked Us All in 2011 |author=Gil Kaufman |date=December 26, 2011 |publisher=MTV News |accessdate=December 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the news of his death, [[Dickhouse Productions]] and the producers of the show released the following statement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I don't really know what to say right now everybody, because the sadness is overwhelming, but today we lost one of our own. Our brother Ryan Dunn has passed. He died in a car wreck in West Goshen, Pennsylvania this morning at 3 a.m.
 that's tough to write. Our hearts go out to his family and his beloved Angie. Ryan will be missed and remembered by us all. Thanks for the kind words of support everybody.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many celebrities expressed their grief and condolences on Twitter including [[Sofia Coppola]], [[Tom Green]], [[Carey Hart]], [[Dwayne Johnson]], [[Tony Hawk]] and his ''Jackass'' cast members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1666070/ryan-dunn-dead-dies-car-crash.jhtml |title=Ryan Dunn Remembered By 'Jackass' Co-Stars, Fans |author=James Montgomery |date=June 20, 2011 |publisher=MTV News |accessdate=July 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kings of Leon]] also paid homage to Dunn at their London Hyde Park concert by dedicating their song "McFearless" to him. [[Skrillex]] dedicated his remix of the song "Cinema" to Dunn after a moment of silence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/viral-videos/469980/kings-of-leon-salute-ryan-dunn-at-london-show |title=Kings of Leon Salute Ryan Dunn at London Show |author=Sophie Schillaci |date=June 23, 2011 |work=Billboard |accessdate=July 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alkaline Trio]] also dedicated their song "Goodbye Forever" to Dunn on their fifteen-year anniversary tour. Singer/songwriter [[Roger Alan Wade]] wrote and composed the song dedicated to Dunn titled, "The Light Outlives the Star." Occasional ''Jackass'' member [[Loomis Fall]] also wrote the song "Bid Farewell" in memory of Dunn. Both songs were used in a music video tribute by Dickhouse Productions for its official website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1666761/ryan-dunn-tribute-video.jhtml |title=Ryan Dunn Remembered in Tribute Video |author=Kara Warner |date=July 1, 2011 |publisher=MTV News |accessdate=July 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dunn also came in at number three in top trending searches of 2011 on Google's Zeitgeist report following his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mashable.com/2011/12/15/most-searched-on-google/ |title=Google Zeitgeist: How the World Googled In 2011 |author=Lauren Indvick |date=December 15, 2011 |accessdate=December 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 28, 2011, MTV aired an hour-long tribute to Dunn, where several details of his life previously unknown to the public were revealed as well as never-before seen stunts he performed. Dunn's parents, sister, friends and both ''Jackass'' and ''Viva La Bam'' cast mates recalled his early beginnings to final months.

'''Saleem Karim''' born (born 1965 in [[Karachi]]) is a [[Pakistan]]i disabled [[Cricket]] Team founder, cricketer and a businessman. Karim, was born with [[polio]] in his right leg and later had accident while riding a bike, in which his left leg was effected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/the-newspaper/sport/disable-team-to-feature-in-magna-cricket-series-669 Magna Cricket Series 669]. Dawn.com. Accessed May 9, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite all this, his interest to play cricket was not affected. He started playing cricket as a hobby but, as he grew older, he realized that there was a need to form a cricket team dedicated to the [[Disability|disabled people]], which would give them a chance to play with people with similar abilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vcricket.com/cricket-news/pakistan-s-disabled-cricket-team-embarks-on-first-tour-14973.html Pakistan's disabled cricket team embarks on first tour] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005121720/http://www.vcricket.com/cricket-news/pakistan-s-disabled-cricket-team-embarks-on-first-tour-14973.html |date=2011-10-05 }}. VCricket.com. Accessed May 9, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather depending on the [[Pakistani government]] to support this cause, Karim went his way and founded a cricket team with people with disabilities in the year 2006. The team has since won many laurels and gained recognition in the country. Karim, funds the team himself. Karim, has also been able to organize two national championships, sparking country-wide interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malaysiacricket.com/NEWS/NEWS-ARCHIVES/CAPABLE-ASIA-FRONTIERS-SURVIVE-EARLY-PDCA-SCARE-AWAN-DEMOLISHED.asp Capable Asia Frontiers Survive Early PDCA Scare].

'''Samuel Chapman''' (1859 – 22 May 1943) was a British [[philatelist]] who was added to the [[Roll of Distinguished Philatelists]] in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.abps.org.uk/Awards/Roll_of_Distinguished_Philatelists/RDP_Background_20111231_LR.pdf Background notes on The Roll of Distinguished Philatelists September 2011]'', Roll of Distinguished Philatelists Trust, London, 2011. [https://www.webcitation.org/6OlHSBOTl Archived here.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapman lived in Mexico for many years and became an expert on the stamps of that country.

'''Scott Louis Bolzan''' (born July 25, 1962) is a [[motivational speaker]], [[author]], [[entrepreneur]], former [[NFL]] and [[USFL]] [[American football|football player]], and the founder and [[CEO]] of Legendary Jets in [[Tempe, Arizona]]. In December 2008, he suffered a [[brain injury]] which has left him with profound [[retrograde amnesia]]. Scott, along with Joan Bolzan and [[Caitlin Rother]], have written a book titled ''My Life: Deleted'', which was published by [[Harper Collins]] and was released on October 4, 2011. ''My Life: Deleted'' appeared on [[The New York Times Best Seller List]] on October 8 at #16 for ebooks non-fiction and #29 for combined hardcover and ebooks non-fiction.&lt;ref name="Bordow"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/reports-reviews-sections/profiles-biographies/12672598-1.html|title=Gilbert man struggles to remember his life|first=Scott|last=Bordow|publisher=[[East Valley Tribune]]|date=August 16, 2009|accessdate=October 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Scott Bolzan was born to Louis and Alice Bolzan in 1962. He grew up in Chicago, Illinois where he attended [[Northern Illinois University]] from 1980 to 1984 on a full [[athletic scholarship]]. It was there that he met his wife, Joan, whom he married in 1984.

==Football career==
In college, Bolzan played [[American football|football]] for the [[Northern Illinois Huskies football|Northern Illinois Huskies]]. After graduating, he went on to play professionally, though his career lasted only two years.&lt;ref name="Bordow" /&gt;

Bolzan was [[NFL draft|drafted]] in May 1984 by the [[New England Patriots]] in the 9th round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=a6QyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Oe8FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3804,917596&amp;dq=scott+bolzan&amp;hl=en|title=NFL Draft|publisher=[[Ottawa Citizen]]|date=May 2, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[Waivers (American football)|waived]] by the Patriots in August of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=h_EKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=708DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3544,4390557&amp;dq=scott+bolzan&amp;hl=en|title=Transactions|publisher=[[The Prescott Courier]]|date=August 22, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He went on to play for the [[Memphis Showboats]] in the [[USFL]] in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nflalumniaz.org/about.html|title=About NFL Alumni Arizona|publisher=[[NFL Alumni]] Arizona|accessdate=October 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bolzan was then picked up by the [[Cleveland Browns]] in May 1985&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sPUPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Z48DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1977,4877971&amp;dq=scott+bolzan&amp;hl=en|title=Transactions|publisher=[[Ellensburg Daily Record]]|date=May 6, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later waived in September 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ahYzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RzIHAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6916,107197&amp;dq=scott+bolzan&amp;hl=en|title=Familiar names are put on waivers as teams cut to 45|publisher=[[Lodi News-Sentinel]]|date=September 3, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was re-signed later in the month&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=10ojAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Nc8FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4191,5356361&amp;dq=scott+bolzan&amp;hl=en|title=Transactions|publisher=[[The Palm Beach Post]]|date=September 27, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cut in October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=28sqAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0c4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1106,1525886&amp;dq=scott+bolzan&amp;hl=en|title=Notes...|publisher=The Palm Beach Post|date=October 3, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bolzan was signed by the Browns again in May 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lB0jAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Ac8FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4449,2464543&amp;dq=scott+bolzan&amp;hl=en|title=Transactions|publisher=The Palm Beach Post|date=May 3, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was injured in August 1986 and retired soon after.

==Entrepreneurship==
After his football career ended due to an injury, Bolzan entered the financial services field where he owned his own financial planning firm specializing in insurance and investments. After moving to [[Arizona]] in 1993, he took up [[aviation]], and later developed West Jet Aircraft&amp;mdash;a charter company specializing in the charter of [[Lear Jet]]s and King Airs in the Scottsdale area of Arizona.  West Jet grew to become the Number 1 Charter Operator in Arizona according to ''Arizona Ranking Magazine'' in 2007.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} He sold West Jet aircraft in February 2008 and opened the doors of Legendary Jets shortly after, where he is the CEO/Founder specializing in private jet management.

==Brain injury==
On December 17, 2008, Scott Bolzan slipped in the men's bathroom at his place of work.&lt;ref name="PhoenixBiz"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://phoenix.bizjournals.com/phoenix/stories/2009/09/28/story3.html?b=1254110400%5E2156121|title=Entrepreneur suffers from amnesia following fall|first=Chris|last=Casacchia|publisher=[[Phoenix Business Journal]]|date=September 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nightline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/amnesia-man-hits-head-loses-memories/story?id=10396719|title=Amnesia Man Hits Head Loses All Memories|publisher=[[ABC News]] ''[[Nightline]]''|date=April 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He says his last "actual memory" was "my feet going above my head". The fall caused a severe [[concussion]]. Bolzan was initially told his [[memory loss]] was normal and temporary, but as months passed by and he still did not remember any part of his life before the fall, he revealed his condition to his wife and they sought help from [[neurologist]]s.

A [[SPECT scan]] of Bolzan's [[human brain|brain]] showed that he had no [[blood flow]] to his right [[temporal lobe]]&amp;mdash;the part of the brain that stores [[long-term memory]]. Blood flow to the front of his brain on both sides is also dramatically reduced.&lt;ref name="Nightline" /&gt; He suffered brain [[atrophy]], which killed [[brain cells]] and damaged connections between them.&lt;ref name="PhoenixBiz" /&gt; The loss of blood flow caused Bolzan to suffer an unusually severe case of [[retrograde amnesia]]. Dr. Teresa Lanier, Bolzan's primary physician, has said "It would basically have to be a miracle for him to one day wake up and have complete and intact memory of everything he has lost. That's probably just never going to happen."&lt;ref name="Nightline" /&gt;

Bolzan's wife has tried to help him remember parts of his life since his fall, showing him photographs of key events in his life in hopes of jogging his memory.&lt;ref name="Nightline" /&gt; Along with memories of his personal life, he has lost memories of historical events and basic [[interpersonal relationship]] concepts. He did not understand [[birthday]]s&lt;ref name="PhoenixBiz" /&gt; or the relationship between a [[husband]] and [[wife]].&lt;ref name="Nightline" /&gt; He had no reference points. He did, however, remember basic life tasks, like using [[eating utensil]]s and how to drive a car.&lt;ref name="KPHO"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kpho.com/news/22861673/detail.html|title=Amnesia Patient Shares Story Of Struggle|first=Cara|last=Liu|publisher=KPHO.com|date=March 16, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614060245/http://www.kpho.com/news/22861673/detail.html|archivedate=June 14, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scott has appeared on talk shows such as Dr. Phil, The View, Fox and Friends, Good Morning America, The Huckabee Show, The Doctors, Nightline, guest appearance on Couples Therapy. Scott has also been a guest on numerous syndicated radio shows and local news stations.

The New York Post published an article on October 9, 2011 reporting that a doctor who examined Bolzan after his fall stated that Bolzan was possibly "feigning his alleged memory deficits", explaining that it is questionable that an injury to one part of the brain could affect all the different memories distributed among the organ, while not damaging his cognitive abilities or his ability to form new memories. The article also cited other neurologists who, while having not examined Bolzan, stated that his amnesia violates fundamental knowledge of neurobiology, in that old memories are more resistant to brain damage than recent ones, in contrast to Bolzan's case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Memory 'loss' is hi$ gain |first=Susannah |last=Cahalan |authorlink=Susannah Cahalan |url=https://nypost.com/2011/10/09/memory-loss-is-hi-gain/ |newspaper=The New York Post |date=October 9, 2011 |accessdate=September 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stage Irish''' or Paddywhackery is a stereotyped portrayal of [[Irish people]] once common in plays.&lt;ref name="oxford-companion-irish-literature"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vDsAaXKLGvYC&amp;pg=PA534&amp;lpg=PA534&amp;dq=%22stage+Irish%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=tFER5-skQ-&amp;sig=mJmUMAZ3Bb0NfmfIhbDZvFuHYJ4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result#PPA533,M1 stage Irishman], ''The Oxford Companion to Irish Literature'', Oxford University Press, p.534-5.&lt;/ref&gt; The term refers to an exaggerated or caricatured portrayal of supposed Irish characteristics in speech and behaviour. The stage Irishman was generally "garrulous, boastful, unreliable, hard-drinking, belligerent (though cowardly) and chronically impecunious."&lt;ref name="oxford-companion-irish-literature"/&gt; This caricature includes many cultural outlets, including the stage, Punch cartoons and English language cliché, such as the terms "Paddywagon" and "hooligan." Collectively, this phenomenon is called "Paddywhackery."

The early stage Irish persona arose in England in the context of the war between the [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]] and [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] supporters of [[William III of England|William of Orange]] at the end of the 17th century. Later, the stage Irish persona become more comic and less threatening. Irish writers also used the persona in a satirical way.

==Early examples==
The character of Captain Macmorris in [[Henry V (play)|Henry V]] has been claimed to be the first example of the type.&lt;ref name="oxford-companion-irish-literature"/&gt; His line "What ish my nation?" was later appropriated by modern Irish writers, becoming a "recurrent epigraph".&lt;ref name="oxford-companion-irish-literature"/&gt; However, Macmorris is a loyal and valiant supporter of Henry V, quite different from later, generally lower-class, stage Irishmen. ''Ben Johnson's The Irish Masque at Court'' (29 December 1613; printed 1616) is another early example of the conventions.

James Farewell's poem ''The Irish Hudibras'' (1689) was published in the wake of William's invasion of Ireland to suppress the Jacobite uprising. It is considered to be the principal origin of the stereotype. This takes the form of a parody of book VI of Virgil's [[Aeneid]], in which Aeneas descends into the underworld. In the poem, this is replaced by Fingal in County Dublin, in which Irish costume, behaviour, and speech-patterns are parodied as if they were denizens of Hades. A companion piece, ''Hesperi-Neso-Grapica or A Description of the Western Isle'' by "W.M." was published in 1715. Pamphlets published under the title "Bog witticisms" also parodied the supposed illogicality and stupidity of the Irish.&lt;ref name="oxford-companion-irish-literature"/&gt;

==18th–20th century==
Irish characters appeared in a number of plays during the 18th century. These were not all negative stereotypes. Sometimes the Irishman could be a noble, or at least sympathetic character. In others he could outwit others. [[Thomas Sheridan (actor)|Thomas Sheridan]]'s play ''Captain O'Blunder'' is about a naive Irishman who in the end triumphs over his English enemy. Lucius O'Trigger in [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]]'s ''[[The Rivals]]'' is an excessively quick-tempered individual. The character had to be rewritten because of complaints that it was insultingly anti-Irish. All these characters were from the genteel social classes.

By the 19th century, the stage Irishman became more of a lower-class stereotype, associated with the emigrations of mid-century. [[Dion Boucicault]]'s successful plays ''[[The Colleen Bawn]]'' (1860) and ''[[The Shaughraun]]'' (1874) included several Stage Irish characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McFeely|first1=Deirdre|title=Dion Boucicault: Irish Identity on Stage|date=May 2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=9781139051743|pages=13–28|doi=10.1017/cbo9781139051743.003|url=https://doi.org/10.1017/cbo9781139051743.003|language=en|chapter=Nationalism, Race and Class in ''The Colleen Bawn''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kao|first1=Wei H.|title=Contemporary Irish Theatre: Transnational Practices|date=29 December 2015|publisher=Peter Lang B.|isbn=9783035265743|doi=10.3726/978-3-0352-6574-3/6|url=https://doi.org/10.3726/978-3-0352-6574-3/6|language=en|chapter=Remaking the Stage Irishman in the New World: Dion Boucicault’s ''The Shaughraun'', Edward Harrigan’s ''The Mulligan Guard Ball'', and Sebastian Barry’s ''White Woman Street''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patriotic inversions of the stereotype appeared in Ireland and it was commented upon by writers such as [[George Bernard Shaw]] in [[John Bull's Other Island]] and by [[John Millington Synge]] in ''[[The Playboy of the Western World]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Innes|first1=Christopher|title=A Companion to Irish Literature|date=2010|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=9781444328066|pages=35–49|doi=10.1002/9781444328066.ch31|url=https://doi.org/10.1002/9781444328066.ch31|language=en|chapter=Defining Irishness: Bernard Shaw and the Irish Connection on the English Stage}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oxford-companion-irish-literature"/&gt; The latter play was condemned by Irish nationalists, including [[Sinn Féin]] leader [[Arthur Griffith]], who described the play as "a vile and inhuman story told in the foulest language we have ever listened to from a public platform", and that it insulted Irish men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maume|first1=Patrick|title=The Ancient Constitution: Arthur Griffith and His Intellectual Legacy to Sinn Féin|journal=Irish Political Studies|date=1 January 1995|volume=10|issue=1|pages=123–137|doi=10.1080/07907189508406541|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/07907189508406541|issn=0790-7184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Steven Neil Posner''' (pronounced POZ-ner; January 11, 1943 &amp;ndash; November 29, 2010) was an American [[corporate raid]]er who worked together on a number of major [[Takeover#Hostile takeovers|hostile takeovers]] with his father, [[Victor Posner]], though the two would later have a falling out that resulted in a series of acrimonious lawsuits. A 1989 corporate takeover staged by the Posners led to fraud convictions for [[Ivan Boesky]] and [[Michael Milken]] levied by the [[United States Securities and Exchange Commission]] for their role in improperly assisting the Posners in the attempted deal.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==Biography==
Posner was born on January 11, 1943, in [[Baltimore]] and joined his father's business acquiring and managing corporations. In 1988, the SEC charged that the Posners had colluded with Ivan Boesky and Michael Milken to conceal their stock purchases during the 1984 Posner-led takeover of the [[Fischbach Corporation]]. While Boesky and Milken agreed to plead guilty to felony counts in relation to their activities in the Fischbach case, the Posners were required to relinquish the financial gains they had made in the deal and to relinquish ownership stakes they held in other companies.&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;Hevesi, Dennis. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/01/business/01posner.html "Steven Posner, 67, Former Corporate Raider, Dies"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 30, 2010. Accessed December 1, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Posner sued his father in 1995, claiming that the senior Posner had overpaid himself while operating a firm in which his son had an ownership stake. The settlement amount was determined based on the result of a gold coin flipped in front of the judge.&lt;ref&gt;via [[Associated Press]].

Accessed December 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; After his father's death in 2002, Steven took over the real estate investments that his father had controlled.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1966, he married Susan Goldman; they had three children: Kelly Posner Gerstenhaber (married to David Gerstenhaber, son of [[Murray Gerstenhaber]]); Sean Posner; and Jarrett Posner&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Hevesi  |first=Dennis |authorlink=   |title=Steven Posner, 67, Former Corporate Raider   |publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=December 2, 2010 |url=https://archive.nytimes.com/query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage-9F03EEDA1631F931A35751C1A9669D8B63.html  |accessdate=March 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (married to Elana Waksal, daughter of [[Samuel D.

The crash was described as the result of a mechanical failure in one of the boats as they were traveling next to each other in [[Biscayne Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;Litz, Steve.

Accessed December 1, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He was survived by his wife, as well as by a daughter, two sons and five grandchildren.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

Family member, Jillian Posner, has taken over Steven's charity roles and was recently awarded a Proclamation from the City of Miami Beach for her fluent work in philanthropy.

'''Tang Xiangming''' ({{zh|汤芗铭}}) (1885–1975) was a Chinese naval officer. Tang studied Naval warfare in [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. In 1905, he joined the Chinese United League ([[Tongmenghui]]). In 1911, during the Wuchang Uprising, Tang, under the command of Admiral [[Sa Zhenbing]], sailed to [[Hankou]] as part of the Qing Navy's assistance to the Qing Army operations in the area. In December 1915, he supported [[Yuan Shikai]]'s creation of the [[Empire of China (1915-16)]]. After Yuan's death, he supported the [[Zhili clique]] until their defeat by the [[Fengtian clique]] in the [[Second Zhili-Fengtian War]] in 1924. In 1930, he supported Shanxi warlord [[Yan Xishan]] in opposing [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. In 1933, he became a member of the [[China Democratic Socialist Party]]. During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], he went to [[Chongqing]]. After the end of the [[Chinese Civil War]], he stayed on the mainland and died in Beijing at the age of 90.

'''Yekaterina Alexeyevna Furtseva''' ({{lang-ru|Екатерина Алексеевна Фурцева}}; 7 December 1910 &amp;ndash; 24 October 1974) was probably the most influential woman in [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] politics and the second woman to be admitted as secretary of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (the first being [[Yelena Stasova]], member of the [[7th Bureau and the 7th Secretariat of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|7th Bureau]]). 

Furtseva was born in [[Vyshny Volochyok]].  Until the 1940s, she worked as an ordinary weaver at one of [[Moscow]]'s textile factories. She had been a minor party worker in [[Kursk]] and the [[Crimea]], and was called to Moscow and sent to the Institute of Chemical Technology from where she graduated in 1941 as a chemical engineer.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,861981-1,00.html O, Ekaterina.] [[Time magazine|Time]],  March 12, 1956. Accessed 4 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
Furtseva's party career started under [[Joseph Stalin]]. Gradually, she became active in [[Komsomol]] affairs and rose to the position of Secretary of the [[Moscow]] City Council in 1950. She gave a speech at the [[19th Congress of the CPSU]] in 1952,&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt; the last party congress of the Stalin era, where she was also elected a candidate member of the [[Central Committee of the CPSU]]. Under [[Nikita Khrushchev]], who sympathized with her, Furtseva was the first secretary of Moscow Committee of the CPSU from 1954 to 1957.

In 1952, Furtseva attacked the leading filmstar, [[Boris Babochkin]], who was famous since starring as [[Vasily Chapayev]].&lt;ref name="Secret"/&gt; This time Furtseva saw the actor starring in a stageplay, and was enraged by Babochkin's satirical portrayal of the Soviet communist leadership. Her angry article in the Soviet newspaper [[Pravda]] called for censorship of Babochkin, while Furtseva furthered her career in the Soviet elite.&lt;ref name="Secret"/&gt; Then Furtseva personally ordered that all film studios and drama companies of the USSR should refuse Babochkin any jobs, keeping him [[unemployed]].&lt;ref name="Secret"&gt;[http://www.sovsekretno.ru/magazines/article/1135 Совершенно СЕКРЕТНО – Чапаем заклейменный]. Sovsekretno.ru. Retrieved on 2012-08-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956 she was appointed a Secretary of the [[Central Committee]] and was elected a candidate member of Politburo. She became the first woman to join the Politburo the next year. In this capacity, she sided with Khrushchev in [[de-Stalinization]] during the [[Khrushchev's Thaw]], and secured the downfall of [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], [[Georgy Malenkov]], and [[Lazar Kaganovich]] when they conspired to depose her patron.

During that time she fell in love with [[Nikolay Firyubin]], the Soviet ambassador in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref name="gazeta"&gt;[http://gazeta.aif.ru/online/superstar/104/36_01 Любимые мужчины Екатерины Фурцевой, Аргументы и факты № 02 (104]. Gazeta.aif.ru (30 January 2007). Retrieved on 2012-08-05.&lt;/ref&gt; Furtseva scandalized the Soviet elite by her weekend trips abroad in order to meet her lover.&lt;ref name="gazeta"/&gt; As he married her and rose to become the Deputy Foreign Minister, they settled in Moscow, and their relations cooled down somewhat.&lt;ref name="gazeta"/&gt;

During the following 14 years, remembered as the Age of Furtseva, she exerted immense influence on Soviet culture, both repressive and beneficent.&lt;ref name="Secret"/&gt; As she became increasingly interested in manipulating theatre and cinema, many remarkable actors and directors tried to secure her friendship in order to further their own careers. According to the most intimate of her friends (such as the singer [[Lyudmila Zykina]]), she also became addicted to alcohol. On 19 June 1974, ''[[Pravda]]'' revealed that she had failed to be re-elected to the Supreme Soviet. Two months previous she had been disciplined by the Party for extravagance and fined 40,000 rubles.&lt;ref&gt;"Taste for luxury downs Soviet leader," ''[[Deseret News]]'', 19 June 1974, p. A1&lt;/ref&gt; She died in [[Moscow]] a few months later, officially of heart failure. Yet there were rumors that she was implicated in illegal commercial dealings and, wishing to preclude the impending scandal and disgrace, committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Shlapentokh, and Joshau Woods.
