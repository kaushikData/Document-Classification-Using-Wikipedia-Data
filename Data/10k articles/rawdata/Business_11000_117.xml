'''Additional funds needed''' (AFN) is a [[Financial accounting|financial]] concept used when a business looks to expand its operations. Since a business that seeks to increase its sales level will require more assets to meet that goal, some provision must be made to accommodate the change in assets. To phrase it another way, the business must have some plan to actually finance the new [[assets]] that will be needed to increase sales.

==Calculation==
AFN is a way of calculating how much new [[funding]] will be required, so that the firm can realistically look at whether or not they will be able to generate the additional funding and therefore be able to achieve the higher sales level. Determining the amount of external funding needed is a key part of calculating AFN. 

A simplified version of the AFN equation is as follows: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;code&gt;AFN = Projected increase in assets – spontaneous increase in liabilities – any increase in retained earnings&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

When calculating AFN, consideration must be given to whether the company is already operating at full capacity; if not, they can expand sales some without having to invest in new equipment.

If a negative value is found for AFN, that means that the action would generate extra [[income]] that could be invested elsewhere. 

The AFN equation is as follows: 

AFN = (A*/S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)ΔS – (L*/S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)ΔS – MS&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(RR)&lt;ref&gt;Brigham, E.F., and M. Ehrhardt. 2008. ''Financial Management: Theory and Practice'', 12th ed. Thomson South-Western, Mason, OH. {{ISBN|978-0-324-42269-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Where:

A* = Assets tied directly to sales and will increase

L* = Spontaneous liabilities that will be affected by sales. (NOTE: Not all liabilities will be affected by sales such as long-term debt)

S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = Sales during the last year

S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = Total sales projected for next year (the new level of sales).

ΔS = The increase in sales between S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;

M = Profit margin, or the profit per unit of sales

MS&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = Projected [[Net Income]]

RR = The retention ratio from Net Income and is also calculated as (1 – payout ratio)

The relevant ratios within the formula are:

(A*/S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;): Called the capital intensity ratio

(L*/S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;): Called the spontaneous liabilities ratio

In July 2018 de Lesseps and his two children filed a lawsuit against his ex-wife Luann, alleging that she had violated the terms of their 2009 divorce and deprived the children of their inheritance. De Lesseps claimed that Luann was required to establish a [[trust fund]] for their two children based on half the value of the family's [[Bridgehampton, New York]] house, which she received in the divorce. Instead she sold the house in 2014 for $8 million and purchased a $3.1 million home in [[Sag Harbor, New York| Sag Harbor]] with the proceeds, without establishing the agreed trust. The lawsuit seeks to have de Lesseps' ex-wife declared in violation of the divorce agreement, and in the interim to bar her from selling or obtaining loans against her Sag Harbor home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-5948417/Luann-Lessepss-ex-accuses-stealing-childrens-inheritance-breaking-divorce-deal.html| title=Luann de Lesseps' ex-husband accuses her of stealing children's inheritance by breaking divorce deal| author=Christine Rendon| publisher=Daily Mail| date=2018-07-12| access-date=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alfred Conkling''' (October 12, 1789 – February 5, 1874) was a lawyer, politician, statesman and [[United States federal judge|United States Federal judge]] from [[New York (state)|New York]].

==Early life and career==
Alfred Conkling was born in [[Amagansett, New York|Amagansett, East Hampton, Suffolk County, New York]], the son of Benjamin Conkling and Esther Hand. He graduated from [[Union College]] in 1810. He was admitted to the bar in 1812, and practiced in [[Johnstown (city), New York|Johnstown]] from 1812 to 1813, and in [[Canajoharie (town), New York|Canajoharie]] from 1813 to 1818. During this time he married Eliza Cockburn, and they had five children. From 1818 to 1821, Conkling was District Attorney of [[Montgomery County, New York|Montgomery County]].

==Federal government service==
Conkling was elected as a [[Democratic-Republican]] to the [[17th United States Congress]], holding office from December 3, 1821, to March 3, 1823. Afterwards he resumed his private practice in the [[Albany, New York|Albany]] area. On August 27, 1825, Conkling received a [[recess appointment]] from President [[John Quincy Adams]] to the seat on the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of New York]] vacated by the death of [[Roger Skinner]]. Formally nominated on December 13, 1825, Conkling was confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] on December 14, 1825, and received his commission the same day.

Judge Conkling sat in Albany from 1825 until 1836 when he moved to [[Auburn, New York]]. On August 25, 1852 he resigned from the bench. Conkling was then appointed [[United States Ambassador to Mexico|U.S. Minister to Mexico]] by President [[Millard Fillmore]], and remained at this post until 1853.

==Later life==
Upon his return from Mexico, Conkling entered private practice in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]. He attended the Nebraska State Constitution Convention and served as the Chairman of the state's Republican Committee.

He returned to New York in 1861 to pursue literary endeavours.  Several of his writings are listed in the 
[http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/bibdisplay.pl?index=C000679  biographical directory of the United States Congress].  During this period he lived in [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[Geneseo (village), New York|Geneseo]] and [[Utica, New York|Utica]].  Judge Conkling died on February 5, 1874, in Utica.

A photograph of Judge Conkling hangs in the courtroom at the United States District Court in Utica, New York.  He is interred at the [[Forest Hill Cemetery, Utica|Forest Hill Cemetery]] in Utica.

==Family legacy==
Among Conkling's five children, [[Frederick Augustus Conkling]] became a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] U.S. Congressman from New York. Aurelian Conkling studied law and served as the Clerk of Court for the [[Northern District of New York]] in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] until his death in May 1860.  Eliza Conkling married Rev. Samuel Hanson Coxe, the son of abolitionist minister, author, and educator [[Samuel Hanson Cox]]. Margaret Cockburn Conkling (also known as Mrs. Steele; born 27 January 1814; died 1890) became an accomplished author, with works such as ''The American Gentleman's Guide To Politeness and Fashion'', ''Memoirs of the Mother and Wife of Washington'' (Auburn, N.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3631">The '''Association of Corporate Treasurers''' ('''ACT''') is the British [[professional body]] specialising in the profession of [[corporate treasury]]. It was founded in 1979 and was re-established on 1 January 2013 by Royal Charter requiring it to operate in the public interest. It is both an examining body, providing a wide range of qualifications for those working in treasury, risk and [[corporate finance]], and a membership organisation which supports and represents its members.

==Membership==
There are two possible routes to membership of ACT. Most members are individuals who have completed ACT's professional qualifications.

The levels of membership are:

* Associate Membership (AMCT)
* Membership (MCT)
* Fellowship (FCT)
* Corporate Membership
* International Affiliates

Associates use the designatory letters AMCT, while members are entitled to use the letters MCT.  Fellowship is the highest level of membership of the Association and confers the right to use the designatory letters FCT. It is a public recognition of the fact that the individual has made a contribution to the treasury profession.

Many members of the ACT are also [[British qualified accountants|qualified accountants]] who belong to a member organisation of the  [[Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies]].

The ACT is a member of the [[European Association of Corporate Treasurers]] and the [[International Group of Treasury Associations]], the umbrella bodies for corporate treasury organisations in Europe and worldwide.

;Fast-track qualification

Automatic exemption from stage 1 of the AMCT Diploma, the Associate Membership qualification is available for all accountants qualified through [[International Federation of Accountants|IFAC]] member bodies. The ACT also offers a fast-track route for qualified accountants who wish to gain AMCT. This accelerated course of study is open exclusively to [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants|ACCA]] members and affiliates, [[Chartered Institute of Management Accountants|CIMA]] members and students, [[ICAEW]] members and [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland|ICAS]] members.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080411215937/http://uk.accaglobal.com/uk/members/support/uk/act Association of Corporate Treasurers Qualifications] on [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants|ACCA]] website&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
The ACT works with the British government and other bodies such as the [[Association of British Insurers]] and [[International Capital Market Association]] to help large and medium-sized companies to raise funds through the [[bond market]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifaonline.co.uk/ifaonline/news/1598003/budget-2010-boost-bond-issuance-uk-firms |title=Budget 2010: Govt to help boost access to bond market |accessdate= 2010-12-01 |author=Walker, David |date=24 Mar 2010 |work= |publisher=IFAonline |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifaonline.co.uk%2Fifaonline%2Fnews%2F1598003%2Fbudget-2010-boost-bond-issuance-uk-firms&amp;date=2010-12-01 |archivedate=2010-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Detroit Photographic Company (0041).jpg|thumb|Spreckels Building, circa 1897-1905]]
'''Central Tower''' is a {{convert|91|m|abbr=on}} 21-story office building at [[Market Street (San Francisco)|Market]] and [[Third Street (San Francisco)|Third]] Streets in [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. The building has undergone numerous renovations since its completion in 1898 as the  '''Call Building'''. It was later known as the '''Spreckels Building'''.

==History==
In 1890, [[M. H. de Young]], owner of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', built San Francisco's first skyscraper, the {{convert|218|ft|adj=on}} [[Ritz-Carlton Club and Residences|Chronicle Building]], to house his newspaper.  In response, [[John D. Spreckels]] and his father [[Claus Spreckels]] purchased the ''[[San Francisco Call]]'' in 1895 and commissioned a tower of their own that would dwarf the Chronicle Building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Korom | first=Joseph J. | pages= 211–213 | title=The American Skyscraper, 1850-1940 | location=Boston  | publisher=Branden Books | year=2008 | isbn=0-8283-2188-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JVzYO1TyZ6AC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=0828321884&amp;ei=ZEqES_SpFIeuNb2a4OcP&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=Call%20Building}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 1895, ''The Call'' wrote:

{{quote|quote=The San Francisco Call is to have the finest building ever erected for a newspaper office. It is to be built on the corner of Market and Third streets, of granite and white marble, and will be fifteen stories — 310 feet high, the highest building this side of Chicago. Unlike the Chronicle building it will be a beautiful building and a credit to its owner, Claus Spreckels, and worthy of the great paper to be printed within its walls. A light granite will be used for the first three stories, but above the third story white marble will be used. The main entrance or rotunda will be finished in some polished California marble, the very choicest obtainable, and the floor will be mosaic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=SFC18950918.2.75 |title=San Francisco Call, Volume 78, Number 110 |date=18 September 1895 |accessdate=25 November 2013 |publisher=California Digital Newspaper Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The building eventually stood 315 feet (96 m) tall with an ornate [[baroque]] [[dome]]&amp;mdash;which housed the offices of [[Reid &amp; Reid]], the building's architects&lt;ref&gt;John Leroux, [http://www.aanb.org/html/en/architects_in_the_comm/jl-chasing.html "Chasing the noblest of arts and the American dream"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203005023/http://www.aanb.org/html/en/architects_in_the_comm/jl-chasing.html |date=December 3, 2013 }}, Architects Association of New Brunswick, no date.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;and four corner [[cupola]]s when construction finished in 1898. It was the tallest building west of the Mississippi River for many years. The structure was badly burned and damaged by the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], although the building did not collapse.

After the fire, ''The Call'' reopened its offices at a new location, [[The Montgomery (San Francisco)|The Montgomery]], and the former Call Building became known as the Spreckels Building. In 1938 Albert Roller completely refurbished Central Tower. The building's height was reduced to 298 feet (91 m) and the number of stories was increased from 15 to 21; the ornate dome and the cupolas atop the building were removed.

'''Charles Okpaleke''' (born March 14, 1983), popularly known as Charles, is a Nigerian health economist, Nightlife tycoon, Nollywood movie producer and businessman. He was born in Onitsha and raised in Lagos, Nigeria, where he studied in his earlier years. Okpaleke worked as a consultant health economist for various governmental and non-governmental organisations including the United Nations and Family Healthcare International before co-founding the Play Entertainment Network in 2008, alongside his brothers Elvis and Jeffrey Okpaleke.

==Early life and career==

Charles Okpaleke was born in Onitsha in Anambra State, [[Nigeria]] to a family of four that would later grow to become a family of eight. His father, Late Julian Chukwuemeka Okpaleke was a retired Assistant Inspector General of Police in the [[Nigeria Police Force]] prior to his death and his mother; Florence Ngozi Okpaleke, remains a legal practitioner in [[Lagos]] Nigeria.

Okpaleke attended [[King's College, Lagos|Kings College]] in Lagos where he graduated in 1999. He then proceeded to the University of Nigeria, Enugu Campus where he studied Medical Laboratory Science until 2005 when he obtained his Bachelor of Sciences degree.  Between 2005 and 2006, Okpaleke landed a Housemanship Programme with the State House Clinic, [[Aso Villa|Aso Rock]], Abuja where he worked as a Medical Laboratory Scientist.

Convinced that his career path would be one in health economics, Okpaleke relocated temporarily to Birmingham, United Kingdom in 2007 to pursue a master's degree in Health Economics and Health Policy. He obtained his MSc in 2007 from the [[University of Birmingham Medical School|University of Birmingham]], United Kingdom and relocated back home to [[Nigeria]] shortly after to focus fully on his chosen career.

From its inception till date, the P.L.A.Y. forum has encouraged youth participation in Nigerian politics regardless of sex, tribe, religion or political affiliation.

[[File:Creative Commons and Commerce.ogg|thumb|thumbtime=18|This video explains how Creative Commons licenses can be used in conjunction with commercial licensing arrangements]]
A '''Creative Commons''' ('''CC''') '''license''' is one of several [[public copyright license]]s that enable the free distribution of an otherwise [[copyright]]ed "work".&lt;ref group="note"&gt;A "work" is any creative material made by a person. A painting, a graphic, a book, a song/ the lyrics to a song, or a photograph of almost anything are all examples of "works".&lt;/ref&gt;  A CC license is used when an author wants to give other people the right to share, use, and build upon a work that he or she (that author) has created. CC provides an author flexibility (for example, he or she might choose to allow only non-commercial uses of a given work) and protects the people who use or redistribute an author's work from concerns of copyright infringement as long as they abide by the conditions that are specified in the license by which the author distributes the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.openeducationeuropa.eu/en/blogs/teachers-guide-creative-commons-licenses|title=The teacher's guide to Creative Commons licenses|last=Shergill|first=Sanjeet|date=2017-05-06|website=Open Education Europa|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wur.nl/en/article/What-are-Creative-Commons-licenses.htm|title=What are Creative Commons licenses?|last=|first=|date=|website=Wageningen University &amp; Research|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://guides.lib.umich.edu/creativecommons/licenses|title=Creative Commons licenses|last=|first=|date=|website=University of Michigan Library|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gla.ac.uk/media/media_464806_en.pdf|title=Creative Commons licenses|last=|first=|date=|website=University of Glasgow|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/open-access/creative-commons-licenses|title=The Creative Commons licenses|last=|first=|date=|website=UNESCO|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several types of Creative Commons licenses. The licenses differ by several combinations that condition the terms of distribution. They were initially released on December 16, 2002 by [[Creative Commons]], a [[United States|U.S.]] [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]] corporation founded in 2001. There have also been five versions of the suite of licenses, numbered 1.0 through 4.0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/License_Versions|title=License Versions - Creative Commons|website=wiki.creativecommons.org |accessdate=July 4, 2017 |deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630063933/https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/License_Versions|archivedate=June 30, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2018|February}}, the 4.0 license suite is the most current.

In October 2014 the [[Open Knowledge Foundation]] approved the Creative Commons CC BY, CC BY-SA and CC0 licenses as conformant with the "[[The Open Definition|Open Definition]]" for content and data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://opendefinition.org/od/2.1/en/ Open Definition 2.1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170127074917/http://opendefinition.org/od/2.1/en/ |date=January 27, 2017 }} on opendefinition.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="opendefinition.org"&gt;[http://opendefinition.org/licenses/ licenses] on opendefinition.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="blog.creativecommons.org"&gt;[https://blog.creativecommons.org/2013/12/27/creative-commons-4-0-by-and-by-sa-licenses-approved-conformant-with-the-open-definition/ Creative Commons 4.0 BY and BY-SA licenses approved conformant with the Open Definition] by Timothy Vollmer on creativecommons.org (December 27th, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applicable works ==

Work licensed under a Creative Commons license is governed by applicable copyright law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/au/legalcode |title=Creative Commons Legal Code |date=January 9, 2008 |publisher=[[Creative Commons]] |accessdate=February 22, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211175916/http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/au/legalcode |archivedate=February 11, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows Creative Commons licenses to be applied to all work falling under copyright, including: books, plays, movies, music, articles, photographs, blogs, and websites.

While [[Software]] is also governed by copyright law and CC licenses are applicable, the Creative Commons recommends [[free and open-source|Free and open-source software]] [[software license]]s instead of Creative Commons licenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wiki.creativecommons.org/FAQ#Can_I_use_a_Creative_Commons_license_for_software.3F |title=Creative Commons FAQ: Can I use a Creative Commons license for software? |publisher=Wiki.creativecommons.org |date=July 29, 2013 |accessdate=September 20, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127205528/http://wiki.creativecommons.org/FAQ#Can_I_use_a_Creative_Commons_license_for_software.3F |archivedate=November 27, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the FOSS licensing use case for software there are [[:Category:Creative Commons-licensed video games|several usage examples]] to utilize CC licenses to specify a "[[Freeware]]" license model; examples are [[The White Chamber]], [[Mari0]] or [[Assault Cube]].&lt;ref name="contentlicense"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://assault.cubers.net/docs/license.html#entirepackage |title=AssaultCube - License |accessdate=2011-01-30 |work=assault.cubers.net| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101225031357/http://assault.cubers.net/docs/license.html| archivedate= 25 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no|quote=''AssaultCube is FREEWARE.

There are over 35,000 works that are available in hardcopy and have a registered ISBN number.  Creative Commons splits these works into two categories, one of which encompasses self-published books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Books|title=Books - Creative Commons|website=wiki.creativecommons.org|access-date=2016-04-01|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412095136/https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Books|archivedate=April 12, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, application of a Creative Commons license may not modify the rights allowed by [[fair use]] or fair dealing or exert restrictions which violate copyright exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Do Creative Commons licenses affect exceptions and limitations to copyright, such as fair dealing and fair use? |url=https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Frequently_Asked_Questions#Do_Creative_Commons_licenses_affect_exceptions_and_limitations_to_copyright.2C_such_as_fair_dealing_and_fair_use.3F |website=Frequently Asked Questions - Creative Commons |accessdate=July 26, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150808182345/https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Frequently_Asked_Questions#Do_Creative_Commons_licenses_affect_exceptions_and_limitations_to_copyright.2C_such_as_fair_dealing_and_fair_use.3F |archivedate=August 8, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Creative Commons licenses are non-exclusive and non-revocable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What if I change my mind about using a CC license? |url=https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Frequently_Asked_Questions#What_if_I_change_my_mind_about_using_a_CC_license.3F |website=Frequently Asked Questions - Creative Commons |accessdate=July 26, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150808182345/https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Frequently_Asked_Questions#What_if_I_change_my_mind_about_using_a_CC_license.3F |archivedate=August 8, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Any work or copies of the work obtained under a Creative Commons license may continue to be used under that license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What happens if the author decides to revoke the CC license to material I am using? |url=https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Frequently_Asked_Questions#What_happens_if_the_author_decides_to_revoke_the_CC_license_to_material_I_am_using.3F |website=Frequently Asked Questions - Creative Commons |accessdate=July 26, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150808182345/https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Frequently_Asked_Questions#What_happens_if_the_author_decides_to_revoke_the_CC_license_to_material_I_am_using.3F |archivedate=August 8, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last two clauses are not [[free content]] licenses, according to definitions such as [[Debian Free Software Guidelines|DFSG]] or the [[Free Software Foundation]]'s standards, and cannot be used in contexts that require these freedoms, such as [[Wikipedia]]. For [[software]], Creative Commons includes three free licenses created by other institutions: the [[BSD License]], the [[GNU]] [[LGPL]], and the [[GNU]] [[GNU General Public License|GPL]].&lt;ref name="GNU LGPL"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://creativecommons.org/license/cc-lgpl|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622222019/http://creativecommons.org/license/cc-lgpl|archivedate=June 22, 2009|title=Creative Commons GNU LGPL|accessdate=July 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mixing and matching these conditions produces sixteen possible combinations, of which eleven are valid Creative Commons licenses and five are not. Of the five invalid combinations, four include both the "nd" and "sa" clauses, which are mutually exclusive; and one includes none of the clauses. Of the eleven valid combinations, the five that lack the "by" clause have been retired because 98% of licensors requested attribution, though they do remain available for reference on the website.&lt;ref name="retiredlicenses"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://creativecommons.org/retiredlicenses/ |title=Retired Legal Tools |accessdate=May 31, 2012 |publisher=[[Creative Commons]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503224254/https://creativecommons.org/retiredlicenses/ |archivedate=May 3, 2016 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="v2announcement"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4216 |title=Announcing (and explaining) our new 2.0 licenses |publisher=Creativecommons.org |date=May 25, 2004 |accessdate=September 20, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921060401/http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4216 |archivedate=September 21, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=licenses&gt;{{cite web |url=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/ |title=About The Licenses - Creative Commons |publisher=[[Creative Commons]] |accessdate=July 26, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150726003931/http://creativecommons.org/licenses/ |archivedate=July 26, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This leaves six regularly used licenses + the CC0 [[public domain]] [[waiver]]:

The original non-localized Creative Commons licenses were written with the U.S. legal system in mind, therefore the wording may be incompatible with local legislation in other [[jurisdictions]], rendering the licenses unenforceable there. To address this issue, Creative Commons asked its affiliates to translate the various licenses to reflect local laws in a process called "[[Creative Commons jurisdiction ports|porting]]."&lt;ref name=murray&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Laura|title=Putting intellectual property in its place: rights discourses, creative labor, and the everyday|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2014|isbn=0-19-933626-1|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2011, Creative Commons licenses have been ported to over 50 jurisdictions worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://creativecommons.org/worldwide |title=Worldwide |publisher=Creative Commons |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015194903/http://creativecommons.org/worldwide |archivedate=October 15, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rights ==

=== Attribution ===
Since 2004, all current licenses (beside the CC0 waiver) require attribution of the original author, the BY component.&lt;ref name="v2announcement"/&gt; The attribution must be given to "the best of [one's] ability using the information available".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wiki.creativecommons.org/FFAQ#How_do_I_properly_attribute_a_Creative_Commons_licensed_work.3F |title=Frequently Frequently Asked Questions |date=February 2, 2010 |publisher=[[Creative Commons]] |accessdate=February 22, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226070130/http://wiki.creativecommons.org/FFAQ#How_do_I_properly_attribute_a_Creative_Commons_licensed_work.3F |archivedate=February 26, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally this implies the following:
* '''Include any copyright notices (if applicable)'''. If the work itself contains any copyright notices placed there by the copyright holder, those notices must be left intact, or reproduced in a way that is reasonable to the medium in which the work is being re-published.
* '''Cite the author's name, screen name, or user ID''', etc. If the work is being published on the Internet, it is nice to link that name to the person's profile page, if such a page exists.
* '''Cite the work's title or name (if applicable)''', if such a thing exists. If the work is being published on the Internet, it is nice to link the name or title directly to the original work.
* '''Cite the specific CC license the work is under'''. If the work is being published on the Internet, it is nice if the license citation links to the license on the CC website.
* '''Mention if the work is a derivative work or adaptation'''. In addition to the above, one needs to identify that their work is a derivative work, e.g., "This is a Finnish translation of [original work] by [author]." or "Screenplay based on [original work] by [author]."

=== Non-commercial licenses ===
{{further|Creative Commons#Criticism of the non-commercial license}}
The "non-commercial" option included in some Creative Commons licenses is controversial in definition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/17127 |title=Defining Noncommercial report published |publisher=Creativecommons.org |date= |accessdate=September 20, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921060638/http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/17127 |archivedate=September 21, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; as it is sometimes unclear what can be considered a non-commercial setting, and application, since its restrictions differ from the principles of [[open content]] promoted by other [[permissive license]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://freedomdefined.org/Licenses/NC |title=The Case for Free Use: Reasons Not to Use a Creative Commons -NC License |publisher=Freedomdefined.org |date=August 26, 2013 |accessdate=September 20, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68gq4ELlU?url=http://freedomdefined.org/Licenses/NC |archivedate=June 25, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 [[Wikimedia Deutschland]] published a guide to using Creative Commons licenses as [[m:Open Content - A Practical Guide to Using Creative Commons Licences|wiki pages]] for translations and as PDF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Open_Content_A_Practical_Guide_to_Using_Creative_Commons_Licences_web.pdf|title=Open Content – A Practical Guide to Using Creative Commons Licenses|isbn=978-3-940785-57-2|author=Till Kreutzer|year=2014|publisher=[[List of Wikimedia chapters|Wikimedia Deutschland]] e.a.|accessdate=March 23, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404014103/https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Open_Content_A_Practical_Guide_to_Using_Creative_Commons_Licences_web.pdf|archivedate=April 4, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides licenses, Creative Commons also offers through '''CC0''' a way to release material worldwide into the [[public domain]].&lt;ref name="CC0"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://creativecommons.org/choose/zero |title=CC0 |publisher=[[Creative Commons]] |accessdate=February 22, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226071411/http://creativecommons.org/choose/zero |archivedate=February 26, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; CC0 is a legal tool for [[Waiver|waiving]] as many rights as legally possible.&lt;ref name="kreutzer"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rd-alliance.org/sites/default/files/cc0-analysis-kreuzer.pdf|title=Validity of the Creative Commons Zero 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication and its usability for bibliographic metadata from the perspective of German Copyright Law|author=Dr. Till Kreutzer|publisher=|accessdate=July 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Or, when not legally possible, CC0 acts as fallback as [[public domain equivalent license]].&lt;ref name="kreutzer"/&gt; Development of CC0 began in 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://creativecommons.org/press-releases/entry/7919 |title=Creative Commons Launches CC0 and CC+ Programs |date=December 17, 2007 |publisher=[[Creative Commons]] |accessdate=February 22, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100223053554/http://creativecommons.org/press-releases/entry/7919 |archivedate=February 23, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the tool was released in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/2009/01/report-from-cc-board-meeting.html |title=Report from CC board meeting |first=Gavin |last=Baker |work=Open Access News |date=January 16, 2009 |accessdate=February 22, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919010433/http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/2009/01/report-from-cc-board-meeting.html |archivedate=September 19, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/13304 |title=Expanding the Public Domain: Part Zero |publisher=Creativecommons.org |date= |accessdate=September 20, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921060406/http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/13304 |archivedate=September 21, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A major target of the license was the scientific data community.&lt;ref name="zero-withdraw"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://projects.opensource.org/pipermail/license-review/2012-February/000231.html| title = CC withdrawl of CC0 from OSI process |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906005825/https://lists.opensource.org/pipermail/license-review/2012-February/000231.html| archivedate=2015-09-06| author = Christopher Allan Webber |work=In the Open Source Initiative Licence review mailing list| accessdate = February 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Creative Commons announced its [[Public Domain Mark]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/22940 |title=Marking and Tagging the Public Domain: An Invitation to Comment |publisher=Creativecommons.org |date=August 10, 2010 |accessdate=September 20, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921060643/http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/22940 |archivedate=September 21, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; a tool for labeling works already in the public domain. Together, CC0 and the Public Domain Mark replace the Public Domain Dedication and Certification,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/ |title=Copyright-Only Dedication (based on United States law) or Public Domain Certification |date=August 20, 2009 |publisher=[[Creative Commons]] |accessdate=February 22, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100223035835/http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/ |archivedate=February 23, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which took a U.S.-centric approach and co-mingled distinct operations.

In 2011, the [[Free Software Foundation]] added CC0 to its [[List of FSF approved software licenses|free software licenses]],&lt;ref name="CConCC0software"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/27081 |title=Using CC0 for public domain software |date=April 15, 2011 |publisher=[[Creative Commons]] |accessdate=May 10, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514163106/https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/27081 |archivedate=May 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and currently recommends CC0 as the preferred method of releasing [[public domain software|software into the public domain]].&lt;ref name="fsfCC0"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html |title=Various Licenses and Comments about Them |publisher=[[GNU Project]] |accessdate=April 4, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724023833/https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html |archivedate=July 24, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012 CC0 was submitted to [[Open Source Initiative]] (OSI) for their approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url         = http://projects.opensource.org/pipermail/license-review/2012-February/

 |df          = mdy-all
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, controversy arose over its clause which excluded from the scope of the license any relevant patents held by the copyright holder. This clause was added with scientific data in mind rather than software, but some members of the OSI believed it could weaken users' defenses against [[software patent]]s. As a result, Creative Commons withdrew their submission, and the license is not currently approved by the OSI.&lt;ref name="zero-withdraw"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In October 2014 the [[Open Knowledge Foundation]] approved the Creative Commons CC0 as conformant with the "Open Definition" and recommend the license to dedicate content to the public domain.&lt;ref name="opendefinition.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="blog.creativecommons.org"/&gt;

== Legal aspects ==
The legal implications of large numbers of works having Creative Commons licensing are difficult to predict, and there is speculation that media creators often lack insight to be able to choose the license which best meets their intent in applying it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Katz|first=Zachary|title=Pitfalls of Open Licensing: An Analysis of Creative Commons Licensing|journal=[[IDEA: The Intellectual Property Law Review]]|year=2005|volume=46|issue=3|page=391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some works licensed using Creative Commons licenses have been involved in several court cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Law |title=Creative Commons Case Law |accessdate=August 31, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901220753/http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Law |archivedate=September 1, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Creative Commons itself was not a party to any of these cases; they only involved licensors or licensees of Creative Commons licenses. When the cases went as far as decisions by judges (that is, they were not dismissed for lack of jurisdiction or were not settled privately out of court), they have all validated the legal robustness of Creative Commons public licenses. Here are some notable cases:

=== Dutch tabloid ===
In early 2006, podcaster [[Adam Curry]] sued a Dutch tabloid who published photos from Curry's Flickr page without Curry's permission.

While the verdict was in favor of Curry, the tabloid avoided having to pay restitution to him as long as they did not repeat the offense. Professor Bernt Hugenholtz, main creator of the Dutch CC license and director of the Institute for Information Law of the University of Amsterdam, commented, "The Dutch Court's decision is especially noteworthy because it confirms that the conditions of a Creative Commons license automatically apply to the content licensed under it, and binds users of such content even without expressly agreeing to, or having knowledge of, the conditions of the license."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1030_3-6052292.html|title=Creative Commons license upheld by court|publisher=News.cnet.com|date=|accessdate=December 24, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025165735/http://news.cnet.com/2100-1030_3-6052292.html|archivedate=October 25, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1ONyncVruj8C&amp;pg=PA271&amp;dq=The+Dutch+Court%27s+decision+is+especially+noteworthy+because+it+confirms+that+the+conditions+of+a+Creative+Commons+license+automatically&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SzKvUMOkJseF4gSp4oEY&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Dutch%20Court%27s%20decision%20is%20especially%20noteworthy%20because%20it%20confirms%20that%20the%20conditions%20of%20a%20Creative%20Commons%20license%20automatically&amp;f=false |title=Digital Copyright and the Consumer Revolution: Hands Off My Ipod - Matthew Rimmer - Google Böcker |publisher=Books.google.se |date= |accessdate=December 24, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414003634/https://books.google.com/books?id=1ONyncVruj8C&amp;pg=PA271&amp;dq=The+Dutch+Court%27s+decision+is+especially+noteworthy+because+it+confirms+that+the+conditions+of+a+Creative+Commons+license+automatically&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SzKvUMOkJseF4gSp4oEY&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Dutch%20Court%27s%20decision%20is%20especially%20noteworthy%20because%20it%20confirms%20that%20the%20conditions%20of%20a%20Creative%20Commons%20license%20automatically&amp;f=false |archivedate=April 14, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20060316052623594|title=Creative Commons License Upheld by Dutch Court|work=[[Groklaw]]|date=March 16, 2006|accessdate=September 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5823|title=Creative Commons Licenses Enforced in Dutch Court|accessdate=August 31, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906074741/http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5823|archivedate=September 6, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Virgin Mobile ===
In 2007, [[Virgin Mobile Australia]] launched an advertising campaign promoting their cellphone text messaging service using the work of amateur photographers who uploaded their work to [[Flickr]] using a Creative Commons-BY (Attribution) license. Users licensing their images this way freed their work for use by any other entity, as long as the original creator was attributed credit, without any other compensation required. Virgin upheld this single restriction by printing a URL leading to the photographer's Flickr page on each of their ads. However, one picture, depicting 15-year-old Alison Chang at a fund-raising carwash for her church,&lt;ref name="permission"&gt;{{Cite news |first=Noam |last=Cohen |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Use My Photo? Not Without Permission. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/01/technology/01link.html |quote=One moment, Alison Chang, a 15-year-old student from Dallas, is cheerfully goofing around at a local church-sponsored car wash, posing with a friend for a photo. Weeks later, that photo is posted online and catches the eye of an ad agency in Australia, and the altered image of Alison appears on a billboard in Adelaide as part of a [[Virgin Mobile]] advertising campaign. |publisher=New York Times |date= |accessdate=September 25, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615133400/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/01/technology/01link.html |archivedate=June 15, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; caused some controversy when she sued Virgin Mobile.  The photo was taken by Alison's church youth counselor, Justin Ho-Wee Wong, who uploaded the image to Flickr under the Creative Commons license.&lt;ref name="permission"/&gt; In 2008, the case (concerning [[personality rights]] rather than copyright as such) was thrown out of a Texas court for lack of jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.internetcases.com/2009/01/22/no-personal-jurisdiction-over-australian-defendant-in-flickr-right-of-publicity-case/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713050011/http://blog.internetcases.com/2009/01/22/no-personal-jurisdiction-over-australian-defendant-in-flickr-right-of-publicity-case/|archivedate=July 13, 2011 |title=No personal jurisdiction over Australian defendant in Flickr right of publicity case |author=Evan Brown |date=January 22, 2009 |work= |publisher=Internet Cases, a blog about law and technology |accessdate=September 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7680|title=Lawsuit Against Virgin Mobile and Creative Commons – FAQ|accessdate=August 31, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907054202/http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7680|archivedate=September 7, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== SGAE vs Fernández ===
In the fall of 2006, the [[Copyright collective|collecting society]] Sociedad General de Autores y Editores ([[SGAE]]) in Spain sued Ricardo Andrés Utrera Fernández, owner of a disco bar located in [[Badajoz]] who played CC-licensed music. SGAE argued that Fernández should pay royalties for public performance of the music between November 2002 and August 2005. The Lower Court rejected the collecting society's claims because the owner of the bar proved that the music he was using was not managed by the society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5830 |title=Spanish Court Recognizes CC-Music |author=Mia Garlick |date=March 23, 2006 |work= |publisher=Creative Commons |accessdate=September 25, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100809082620/http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5830 |archivedate=August 9, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2006, the Cultural Association Ladinamo (based in Madrid, and represented by [[Javier de la Cueva]]) was granted the use of copyleft music in their public activities. The sentence said: "Admitting the existence of music equipment, a joint evaluation of the evidence practiced, this court is convinced that the defendant prevents communication of works whose management is entrusted to the plaintiff [SGAE], using a repertoire of authors who have not assigned the exploitation of their rights to the SGAE, having at its disposal a database for that purpose and so it is manifested both by the legal representative of the Association and by Manuela Villa Acosta, in charge of the cultural programming of the association, which is compatible with the alternative character of the Association and its integration in the movement called '[[copyleft|copy left]]'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.derecho-internet.org/node/359 |title=Sentencia nº 12/2006 Juzgado de lo Mercantil nº 5 de Madrid &amp;#124; Derecho de Internet |language=es |publisher=Derecho-internet.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126165923/http://www.derecho-internet.org/node/359 |archivedate=November 26, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== GateHouse Media, Inc. vs. That's Great News, LLC ===
On June 30, 2010 [[GateHouse Media]] filed a lawsuit against [[That's Great News]]. GateHouse Media owns a number of local newspapers, including ''[[Rockford Register Star]]'', which is based in Rockford, Illinois. That's Great News makes plaques out of newspaper articles and sells them to the people featured in the articles.&lt;ref name="New Copyright Lawsuit"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.internetcases.com/2010/07/02/new-copyright-lawsuit-involves-creative-commons/ |title=New Copyright Lawsuit Involves Creative Commons |author=Evan Brown |date=July 2, 2010 |work= |publisher=Internet Cases: A blog about law and technology |accessdate=April 20, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621215029/http://blog.internetcases.com/2010/07/02/new-copyright-lawsuit-involves-creative-commons/ |archivedate=June 21, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; GateHouse sued That's Great News for copyright infringement and breach of contract. GateHouse claimed that TGN violated the non-commercial and no-derivative works restrictions on GateHouse Creative Commons licensed work when TGN published the material on its website. The case was settled on August 17, 2010, though the settlement was not made public.&lt;ref name="New Copyright Lawsuit" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citmedialaw.org/threats/gatehouse-media-v-thats-great-news#description |title=GateHouse Media v.

=== Drauglis v. Kappa Map Group, LLC ===
The plaintiff was photographer Art Drauglis, who uploaded several pictures to the photo-sharing website Flickr using Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 Generic License (CC BY-SA), including one entitled "Swain's Lock, Montgomery Co., MD.". The defendant was Kappa Map Group, a map-making company, which downloaded the image and used it in a compilation entitled "Montgomery Co. Maryland Street Atlas". Though there was nothing on the cover that indicated the origin of the picture, the text "''Photo: Swain's Lock, Montgomery Co., MD Photographer: Carly Lesser &amp; Art Drauglis, Creative Commoms'' {{sic}}'', CC-BY-SA-2.0''" appeared at the bottom of the back cover.

The validity of the CC BY-SA 2.0 as a license was not in dispute. The CC BY-SA 2.0 requires that the licensee to use nothing less restrictive than the CC BY-SA 2.0 terms. The atlas was sold commercially and not for free reuse by others. The dispute was whether Drauglis' license terms that would apply to "derivative works" applied to the entire atlas. Drauglis sued the defendants in June 2014 for copyright infringement and license breach, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, damages, fees, and costs. Drauglis asserted, among other things, that Kappa Map Group "exceeded the scope of the License because defendant did not publish the Atlas under a license with the same or similar terms as those under which the Photograph was originally licensed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCOURTS-dcd-1_14-cv-01043/pdf/USCOURTS-dcd-1_14-cv-01043-0.pdf |title=Memorandum Opinion |publisher=United States District Court for the District of Columbia |date=August 18, 2015 |accessdate=August 29, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921202242/https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCOURTS-dcd-1_14-cv-01043/pdf/USCOURTS-dcd-1_14-cv-01043-0.pdf |archivedate=September 21, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge dismissed the case on that count, ruling that the atlas was not a [[derivative work]] of the photograph in the sense of the license, but rather a [[collective work]]. Since the atlas was not a derivative work of the photograph, Kappa Map Group did not need to license the entire atlas under the CC BY-SA 2.0 license. The judge also determined that the work had been properly attributed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guadamuz|first1=Andres|title=US Court interprets copyleft clause in Creative Commons licenses|url=http://www.technollama.co.uk/us-court-interprets-copyleft-clause-in-creative-commons-licenses|website=TechnoLlama|accessdate=10 December 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222123232/http://www.technollama.co.uk/us-court-interprets-copyleft-clause-in-creative-commons-licenses|archivedate=December 22, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, the judge determined that it was sufficient to credit the author of the photo as prominently as authors of similar authorship (such as the authors of individual maps contained in the book) and that the name "CC-BY-SA-2.0" is sufficiently precise to locate the correct license on the internet and can be considered a valid URI of the license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2017-10-02|title=Carrollogos: U.S. Court Correctly Interprets Creative Commons Licenses|url=https://carrollogos.blogspot.com/2016/04/us-court-correctly-interprets-creative.html|author=[[Michael W.

=== Verband zum Schutz geistigen Eigentums im Internet (VGSE) ===
This incident has not been tested in court, but it highlights a potentially disturbing practice.  In July 2016, German computer magazine [[LinuxUser]] reports that a German blogger Christoph Langner used two {{nowrap|CC-BY}} licensed photographs from Berlin photographer [http://www.skley.de Dennis Skley] on his private blog [https://linuxundich.de Linuxundich.de].  Langner duly mentioned the author and the license and added a link to the original.  Langner was later contacted by the ''Verband zum Schutz geistigen Eigentums im Internet'' (VGSE) (Association for the Protection of Intellectual Property in the Internet) with a demand for €2300 for failing to provide the full name of the work, the full name of the author, the license text, and a source link, as is apparently required by the fine print in the license.  Of this sum, €40 goes to the photographer and remainder is retained by VGSE.&lt;ref name="luther-2016"&gt;

'''Data ownership''' is the philosophical and legal concept of an entity owning the rights to control access to a particular set or group of [[data]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Data ownership is typically handled in a legal setting and often associated with the question of [[copyright]],&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; with the person or entity that has created the data in question possessing the above [[rights]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Data ownership refers to the rights of the creator of data as opposed to the subject of the data. Ownership also confers a variety of responsibilities to data owners regarding the maintenance and usability of that data.

== Determination ==
Ownership of data is conventionally assumed to belong to the entity that generated or purchased it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Universities and other research labs are assumed to own the data of their employees.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fishbein|first=E. A.|date=March 1991|title=Ownership of research data|journal=Academic Medicine|volume=66|issue=3|pages=129–133|issn=1040-2446|pmid=1997022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legally, data ownership is determined by the laws of the nation in which the data is being used. Laws concerning data ownership vary greatly not only from continent to continent, but also from nation to nation.

=== America ===
[[United States|American]] laws consider research data to be [[intellectual property]] and therefore qualifies for the same legal protections of copyright.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cleary|first=Michelle|last2=Jackson|first2=Debra|last3=Walter|first3=Garry|date=2013-08-01|title=Editorial: Research data ownership and dissemination: is it too simple to suggest that ‘possession is nine-tenths of the law’?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jocn.12140/abstract|journal=Journal of Clinical Nursing|language=en|volume=22|issue=15-16|pages=2087–2089|doi=10.1111/jocn.12140|issn=1365-2702}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, research data is often assumed to be the property of the institution that commissioned the research through a process known as "works for hire".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Europe ===
Each of the individual members of the [[European Union]] as well as non-member countries are required to develop their own laws on data ownership.

==== United Kingdom ====
Data ownership is not officially offered through any statues. Offenses introduced in the 1990 [[Computer Misuse Act 1990|Computer Misuse Act]], which was developed in order to make hacking illegal, and includes an offense for unauthorized access to computer materials.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publications.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/d0bec895-b603-11e6-9e3c-01aa75ed71a1/language-en|title=Legal study on ownership and access to data : final report. Publications Office of the European Union|date=2016-11-28|language=en|doi=10.2759/299944|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== France ====
Personal data ownership is covered under the 1978 Data Protection Act (Loi Informatique et Libertés). Laws concerned with access to and ownership of data do not exist.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Germany ====
No specific rights have been implemented via statute into German law, but personal information are protected in the "Right to Personality"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Spain ====
Laws in Spain that concern [[trade secret]]s prevent these secrets from being accessed illegally as determined in a 2008 [[Supreme Court of Spain|Supreme Court]] decision.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Privileges ==
Ownership over a dataset allows an entity to control the sale of the data and the access to it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/922155358|title=The quantified self : a sociology of self-tracking|last=Deborah,|first=Lupton,|isbn=9781509500604|location=Cambridge, UK|oclc=922155358}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ownership of data also allows the owning entity to decide how to define and control the data and to determine how the data is to be used.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Owners of the data are not required to publish this data and are entitled to use it for their own purposes such as research.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Owners of data are able to gather it exclusively for the purposes of selling it to another entity through the purposes of "Works for Hire".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Responsibilities ==
Data ownership comes with the responsibility to maintain and manage the data.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frugoli|first=Julia|last2=Etgen|first2=Anne M.|last3=Kuhar|first3=Michael|date=2010-12-01|title=Developing and Communicating Responsible Data Management Policies to Trainees and Colleagues|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11948-010-9219-1|journal=Science and Engineering Ethics|language=en|volume=16|issue=4|pages=753–762|doi=10.1007/s11948-010-9219-1|issn=1353-3452}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data owners are responsible for defining, compiling, managing both the sale, delivery distribution and security of the data.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43820637|title=Enterprise knowledge management : the data quality approach|last=1963-|first=Loshin, David,|date=2001|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|isbn=0124558402|location=San Diego|oclc=43820637}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data ownership also comes with a responsibility to store the data, and keep the data up to date. This becomes more difficult with data types that update frequently. Because of the large amount of responsibility associated with the maintenance of the data, some [[data scientists]] such as Scofield (1998) argue that Data Ownership should be called Data stewardship. In order for data to be considered effective, the owner of the data has a responsibility to update it frequently in order to ensure the data is still relevant, come up with a system to categorize and make the data usable, and allow those looking to access the data to understand how to use it.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Ethics ===
Data ownership of some data can be highly controversial due to the rise of the quantifiable self=movement through fitness devices.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These devices allow users to measure heartbeat and other self-regulating statistics. The data generated by these devices are collected by the companies that produce them. Ethical concerns are raised due to the sale of these units of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wissinger|first=Elizabeth|date=2017-11-01|title=Wearable tech, bodies, and gender|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/soc4.12514/abstract|journal=Sociology Compass|language=en|volume=11|issue=11|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.1111/soc4.12514|issn=1751-9020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arguments for increased regulation of data ownership laws encourage more control over the sale of human data.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ori.hhs.gov/education/products/n_illinois_u/datamanagement/dotopic.html|title=Data Ownership|website=ori.hhs.gov|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns have also risen over how patient data must be handled. in 1991 Fishbein argued that patient and financial records should be made available to the subjects.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Open data ownership ==
Government-owned data is typically expected to be open and freely available for public viewing in democratic countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://okfn.org/opendata/|title=Open Knowledge International|website=okfn.org|accessdate=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Failure to make data free and available can result in the government's intent being questioned. The [[Open Knowledge International|Open Knowledge Foundation]], an international organization that specializes in data openness and freedom of access scores nations based on the openness of the data, with a higher score indicating that the data is more free or available. Open Data is still owned by the organization that created it in accordance with the legal definitions of the nation in question. Governments are not required to make their data open, but many nations have in order to improve transparency.

DeBartolo Sr.]] and the late Marie Patricia Montani DeBartolo.

==Early life==
DeBartolo grew up in a family famous for [[real estate development]].&lt;ref name="family business"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2000/09/01/MN73220.DTL | title=The Family Business | work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] | date=September 1, 2000 | author=Nancy Gay | accessdate=2007-05-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She attended [[Saint Mary's College (Indiana)|Saint Mary's College]] of [[Indiana]], the Catholic women's college adjacent to the [[University of Notre Dame]].&lt;ref name="49ers bio" /&gt;

==Career==
After graduation, she joined the family business, [[The DeBartolo Corporation]], and became its executive vice president.&lt;ref name="49ers bio" /&gt; In 1994, following her father's death, she became company co-chairman&lt;ref name="49ers bio" /&gt; and all 78 DeBartolo malls were sold.

In 1978, Edward DeBartolo purchased the [[National Hockey League]]'s [[Pittsburgh Penguins]].&lt;ref name="49ers bio" /&gt; and established DeBartolo York as owner and president.  She presided over the Penguins [[1990–91 NHL season|1990–91 championship season]],&lt;ref name="49ers bio" /&gt; and was the third woman to serve as President of a [[Stanley Cup]] winning team.&lt;ref name="stanley cup"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nhl.com/cup/notebook.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516103230/http://www.nhl.com/cup/notebook.html | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2008-05-16 | title=Stanley Cup Notebook | publisher=[[National Hockey League]] | accessdate=2007-05-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, the year following the championship, she sold the Penguins to assist the DeBartolo Corporation, which was facing challenges in the aftermath of the real estate collapse of 1987. In 2000, DeBartolo York and her husband gained control of the 49ers and other sporting assets from her brother, [[Edward J. DeBartolo, Jr.]] She and her husband have since given over control of the 49ers to their son, [[Jed York]].

On 24 May 2018, the York family via [[San Francisco 49ers|49ers Enterprises]] bought shares in English soccer club [[Leeds United]] to become a minority investor, the 49's Enterprises is the business arm of the [[NFL]] side [[San Francisco 49ers]].&lt;ref name="49ers-investor"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.leedsunited.com/news/club-news/23401/san-francisco-49ers-enterprises-become-minority-investor|title=San Francisco 49ers Enterprises Become Minority Investor |publisher=Leeds United Football Club|date=24 May 2018 |accessdate=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.leedsunited.com/club/Ownership-structure|title=Ownership structure - Leeds United|author=|date=|website=www.leedsunited.com|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[variance analysis (accounting)]] '''direct material price variance''' is the difference between the [[standard cost]] and the [[actual cost]] for the [[actual quantity]] of material purchased. It is one of the two components (the other is [[direct material usage variance]]) of [[direct material total variance]].

==Example==
Let us assume that the standard direct material cost of [[Widget (economics)|widget]] is as follows:
:2 kg of [[unobtainium]] at € 60 per kg ( = € 120 per unit). 
Let us assume further that during the given period, 100 widgets were manufactured, using 212&amp;nbsp;kg of [[unobtainium]] which cost € 13,144.

Under those assumptions direct material price variance can be calculated as:
{{Infobox VarianceAnalysis VarianceBox|tx1=212 kg of [[unobtainium]] should have cost (&amp;times; € 60)
|tx2=but did cost
|tx3=Direct material ([[unobtainium]]) price variance
|am1=12,720
|am2=13,144
|am3=424
|va1=A
}}
Direct material price variance is because Todd pays too much for steel can be reconciled to [[direct material total variance]] by way of [[direct material usage variance]]:
{{Infobox VarianceAnalysis VarianceBoxRec|tx1=Direct material usage variance
|tx2=Direct material price variance
|tx3=Direct material total variance
|am1=720
|am2=424
|am3=1,144
|va1=A
|va2=A
|va3=A
spending variance seen as per product cost
(212*62)-(200*60)
See [[direct material total variance#Example]] and [[direct material usage variance#Example]] for computations of both components.

'''Export subsidy''' is a government policy to encourage export of goods and discourage sale of goods on the domestic [[Market (economics)|market]] through direct payments, low-cost [[loans]], tax relief for exporters, or government-financed international advertising. An export subsidy reduces the price paid by foreign importers, which means [[Domestic market|domestic]] consumers pay more than foreign consumers. The [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) prohibits most subsidies directly linked to the volume of [[exports]], except for [[Least Developed Countries|LDCs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/agrm8_e.htm Anti-dumping, subsidies, safeguards: contingencies, etc], Understanding the WTO: The Agreements&lt;/ref&gt; Incentives are given by the government of a country to exporters to encourage export of goods.  

Export subsidies are also generated when internal price supports, as in a guaranteed minimum price for a [[commodity]], create more production than can be consumed internally in the country. (These [[price]] supports are often coupled with import tariffs, which keeps the domestic price high by discouraging or taxing imports on the difference between the world price and the mandatory minimum.) Instead of letting the commodity rot or destroying it, the government exports it. [[Saudi Arabia]] is a net exporter of [[wheat]], [[Japan]] often is a net exporter of [[rice]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

At the WTO's Tenth Ministerial Conference, which was held in [[Nairobi, Kenya]] from 15 to 19 December 2015, the WTO member states agreed to eliminate export subsidies for agricultural products; least-developed nations have until the end of 2018 to eliminate agricultural export subsidies (until 1 January 2017 in relation to cotton exports), while developed nations agreed to eliminate most such subsidies immediately.

Export subsidies can cause [[inflation]]: the government subsidises the industry based on costs, but an increase in the subsidy is directly spent on wage hikes demanded by employees. Now the wages in the subsidised [[industry]] are higher than elsewhere, which causes the other employees demand higher [[wage]]s, which are then reflected in prices, resulting in inflation everywhere in the [[economy]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Some countries provide indirect export subsidies in the form of tax reductions. In the United States closely held exporters of U.S. made goods may get a reduction of tax using an Interest Charge Domestic International Sales Corporation (IC-DISC).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aicpa.org/Publications/TaxAdviser/2012/October/Pages/clinic-story-05.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5235">In [[United States]] [[business law]], a '''forward-looking statement''' or '''safe harbor statement''' is a statement that cannot sustain itself as merely a historical [[fact]]. A forward-looking statement predicts, projects, or uses future events as expectations or possibilities. These statements can often be misleading, as they can be mistaken for factual statements, while they are actually speculation. According to [[United States Code]] 15 Section 78u-5, a forward-looking statement may include future economic performance such as revenues or income, plans for future operations, or use of a report written by an outside reviewer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/78u-5 | title = 15 USC 78u-5- Application of safe harbor for forward-looking statements | accessdate = 2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== United States law ==

Under U.S. law, section 27A of the [[Securities Act of 1933]], as amended, and section 21E of the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]], as amended, businesses must comply to standards of communication that limit risk factors. These acts were put into place partially to protect investors from ambiguous language, preventing them from making a poorly informed investment decision based on speculative statements.

The [[Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995]] provides a "[[Safe harbor (law)|safe harbor]]" for certain forward-looking statements. Businesses usually include a form of a disclaimer that states that any instance of a forward-looking statement found in their material is only true at the time it was written, and they further claim that they are under no obligation to update such written statements if conditions change or that unexpected occurrences happen to affect the statement afterwards. Such forward-looking statements, however, must be identifiable by the use of certain prescribed words. This act allows companies to make speculative statements based on current market trends or research directions without fear of major repercussion, while ensuring that potential investors are informed of the speculative nature of the statements.

=== Linguistic perspective ===

[[Sentence (linguistics)|Sentence]]s and [[phrase]]s are forward-looking statements when they include any tense from [[present tense|present]] to [[future tense|future]] or similar inflection. Words like "believe", "estimate", "anticipate", "plan", "predict", "may", "hope", "can", "will", "should", "expect", "intend", "is designed to", "with the intent", "potential", the negative of these words or such other variations thereon or comparable terminology, may indicate forward-looking statements, but their absence does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking.

==Examples==
Below are some hypothetical examples of forward-looking statements:
*Company'' X'' plans on building a new facility in Asia by 2018, expanding our current market share.
*We anticipate the value of our company to continue to rise for over the next few years, increasing [[dividends]] for shareholders.
*We predict that our product will revolutionize the healthcare industry, improving the quality of healthcare for millions of patients.

'''George Cabot "Bay" Lodge''' (October 10, 1873 – August 21, 1909) was an [[United States|American]] [[poet]] of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

==Early life==
Lodge was born in [[Boston]] on October 10, 1873. His father was [[Henry Cabot Lodge]], a politician who eventually represented [[Massachusetts]] in the [[U.S. Senate]]. His mother was Anna Cabot Mills Davis. He was named after his great-great-grandfather, U.S. Senator [[George Cabot]].

Lodge began studies at [[Harvard College]], and continued them in France and Berlin into his mid-twenties. At Harvard, he was a member of the Harvard Polo Club.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/constitutionbyla00harv#page/16/mode/2up The constitution and by-laws of the Harvard Polo Club with the list of officers and members, 1883-1905&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1897, Lodge began work as a secretary to both his father and a U.S. Senate committee in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. He later served successfully in the [[Spanish–American War]] as a naval cadet. Lodge was a close friend of [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who penned a fond introduction for the posthumous 1911 collection ''Poems and Dramas of George Cabot Lodge.'' He was best known for his delicate sonnets, such as ''the Song of the Wave'', ''Essex'', and ''Trumbull Stickney'' ([[Trumbull Stickney|Stickney]] was a friend and admirer), several of which were anthologized. His style and artistic outlook were deeply affected by the pessimism of [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] and [[Giacomo Leopardi]], as well as French influences including [[Baudelaire]] and [[Leconte de Lisle]].

==Personal life==
In 1900, he married Mathilda Frelinghuysen Davis, with whom he had three children.&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of American Biography.'' Page 346. Scribner, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; Their sons [[Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.|Henry]] and [[John Davis Lodge|John]] became politicians, rising to the offices of [[U.S. senator]] from Massachusetts and [[governor]] of [[Connecticut]], respectively.&lt;ref name=polgrave&gt;[http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/lockyer-loftus.html#R9M0J4FEU The Political Graveyard] accessed 2007-07-06&lt;/ref&gt; Henry also was [[Richard Nixon|Richard Nixon’s]] running mate in the [[1960 United States Presidential Election]].

He died of heart failure while vacationing on Tuckernuck Island, near [[Nantucket]], on August 21, 1909.&lt;ref&gt;The Harvard Graduates' Magazine, Volume XVIII, 1909-1910, page 337.&lt;/ref&gt; A biography, ''The Life of George Cabot Lodge'' (1911), was written by his friend and confidant [[Henry Brooks Adams|Henry Adams]]. His collected poems and dramas, in two volumes, were published in 1911 by [[Houghton Mifflin Company]].

'''Henry De Courcy Forbes''' (February 24, 1849 – July 1920)&lt;ref name="HdCFObit1920"/&gt; was an American attorney, clubman, and member of the [[Forbes family]] who was prominent in New York society during the [[Gilded Age]].

==Early life==
Forbes was born on February 24, 1849. He was the second son of Valeria Medora ([[née]] Wright) Forbes and Paul Siemen Forbes (1808–1886), who traveled to China in 1857 joined his cousin [[John Murray Forbes]], the United States Consul in [[Guangzhou|Canton]] who was a partner in [[Russell &amp; Co.]], the largest American trading house in [[Qing dynasty]] China from the 1840s until its closing in 1891.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~bak00124|title=Forbes Family.

His maternal grandparents were Eliza Lee (née Warner) Wright and [[A History of the Adjutants General of Maryland#Samuel Turbutt Wright (1807–1810)|Samuel Turbutt Wright]], the 2nd [[State adjutant general|Adjutant General]] of [[Maryland]].&lt;ref name="Hardy1911"/&gt; After his grandfather's early death in 1810, his grandmother remarried to Forbes' namesake, William Henry De Courcy Wright, the son of [[U.S. Senator]] and [[Governor of Maryland]] [[Robert Wright (politician)|Robert Wright]] and Sarah (née De Courcy) Wright.&lt;ref name="Hardy1911"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hardy |first1=Stella Pickett |title=Colonial Families of the Southern States of America: A History and Genealogy of Colonial Families who Settled in the Colonies Prior to the Revolution |date=1911 |publisher=Wright |page=537 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e1VlAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA537 |accessdate=18 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Following the family tradition, Forbes entered [[Russell &amp; Co.]] as a director,&lt;ref name="Whitaker1884"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Whitaker |first1=Joseph |title=An Almanack for the Year of Our Lord ... |date=1884 |publisher=J.

Russells attempted to rescue itself when it was about to bankrupt by founding the [[National Bank of China]] to draw some capital.  Forbes, his brother William, and the [[Howqua]] family became founders of the Bank.  S. W. Pomeroy, a Russell partner and former director of the [[Hongkong and Shanghai Bank]], with other members of the company, criticized the Forbes brothers for sponsoring the new Bank which the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank viewed as rival.&lt;ref name="company"/&gt;  This led to further curtailment of credit to Russell &amp; Co., forcing the firm to sell its assets resulting in a full collapse on June 9, 1891.  The business was acquired by two of its employees, [[Robert Shewan]] and Alexander Charles Tomes, who renamed the firm [[Shewan, Tomes &amp; Co.]] in 1895.&lt;ref name="company"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.amstudy.hku.hk/news/treatyports2011/files/sibinghe.pdf|title=Russell and Company in Shanghai, 1843–1891: U.

===Society life===
In 1892, Forbes was included in [[Ward McAllister]]'s [[Ward McAllister#"The Four Hundred"|"Four Hundred"]], purported to be an index of New York's best families, published in ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name="McAllister1892"&gt;{{cite news|last1=McAllister|first1=Ward|title=THE ONLY FOUR HUNDRED {{!}} WARD M'ALLISTER GIVES OUT THE OFFICIAL LIST.

==Personal life==
Forbes, who did not marry, lived at the [[Knickerbocker Club]] in New York City.&lt;ref name="SR1901"&gt;{{cite book |title=Social Register, New York |date=1901 |publisher=Social Register Association |page=156 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qmpIAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA156 |accessdate=18 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died at the home of his brother Paul, 37 Avenue de l'Alma, in Paris in July 1920.&lt;ref name="HdCFObit1920"&gt;{{cite news |title=H.

The '''Indian Readership Survey''' (IRS) is the largest continuous readership research study in the world with an annual sample size exceeding 2.56 lakh (256,000) respondents. IRS collects a comprehensive range of [[Demography|demographic]] information and provides extensive coverage of consumer and product categories, including cars, household appliances, household durables, household care and personal care products, food and beverages, finance and holidays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mruc.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=15&amp;Itemid=31 |title=Media Research Users Council - IRS Introduction - Providing In-depth Research Knowledge to Media Buyers &amp; Sellers |publisher=Mruc.net |date= |accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IRS]] is not restricted to survey of readership alone but is synonymous with both readership &amp; consumption across various FMCG ([[Fast-Moving Consumer Goods]]) products throughout [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mruc.net/index.php?option=com_easyfaq&amp;Itemid=93 |title=Media Research Users Council - IRS FAQ |publisher=Mruc.net |date= |accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; IRS covers information on over 100 product categories. IRS is conducted by MRUC (Media Research Users Council) and RSCI (Readership Studies Council of India).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/irs-2013-has-shocking-anomalies-defying-logic/article5640030.ece |title=IRS 2013 has shocking anomalies defying logic |publisher=The Hindu |date=2014-01-31 |accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
IRS was launched in the year 1995 with an objective of setting an industry standard for readership &amp; other media measurement, &amp; to provide insights on media &amp; product consumption as well as consumer behavior patterns. In the year 1995-96, 23 Metro Reports were released followed by the All India Report consisting of urban and rural data. Simultaneously a software programme was developed to not just enable the optimum use of raw data but to also carry out multi media planning which provided a common basis of media evaluation.Over the years IRS has evolved to be very progressive, covering a broad spectrum of categories from Media data, [[Demographics of India|Indian Demographics]], Indian Market, Product Profiles, to the recently developed Telecom Report, TV Report, and IRS Countryside. Apart from a range of products offered new changes have been introduced in the method of classification of sub-regions from SCR’s to ISD’s, which is a more microscopic view of the consumer profile based on the socio−cultural [[ethnicity]]. From a user’s perspective, a few introductions in the form of participative sampling, customized queries have been introduced. Sub Metro level reporting for a better understanding of the consumer behavior patterns across different zones in the Metros &amp; Edition wise reporting is the other recent introduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mruc.net/index.php?option=com_easyfaq&amp;Itemid=93 |title=Media Research Users Council - IRS FAQ |publisher=Mruc.net |date= |accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
IRS covers nearly 70 cities, 1178 towns and 2894 villages with the coverage being reviewed before the start of every round. The universe for IRS has been defined as the total resident urban and rural population of India aged 12 years and over. The survey excludes the off-shore territories such as [[Lakshadweep]] and [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]]. North Eastern states (excluding [[Assam]]) and [[Jammu and Kashmir]] (excluding [[Srinagar]]) are also excluded from the survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mruc.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=24&amp;Itemid=35 |title=Media Research Users Council - IRS Methodology |publisher=Mruc.net |date= |accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sampling===
* The annual sample spread exceeds 2.56 lakh (256,000) respondents with continuous fieldwork spread across 10 months of the year
* Sample allocated proportionate to 12 years+ Universe of a geographic unit 
* More than 1 Lakh towns are sampled
* All publication towns and districts are sampled in the four rounds
* Remaining towns and non-publication districts are randomly sampled
* Rural Sampling: Once a district is selected, 2 [[Talukas]] from the district are randomly sampled

===Universe projection and weightlifting===
* The IRS data is weighted to the [[census]] universe
* Since the Census is conducted every ten years, the estimated population for any given date is calculated by using the growth rate in between two census points.
* Projection of Universe = the midpoint date of the Fieldwork period.

==Significance==
IRS is the single source survey for media and product ownership/usage. The prime objective of the study is to collect readership information from a cross-section of individuals, in great detail, so as to present a true and unbiased picture of their readership habits. On the media front, it also captures information on television and cinema viewing habits, radio listening habits and Internet usage. In addition to this, IRS captures information on various FMCG ([[Fast-moving consumer goods|Fast Moving Consumer Goods]]) products, usage and consumption and durable ownership amongst households. Since media and product ownership/ consumption information is captured from the same household, it enables linkages between the media and product data. IRS equips you with information that is truly reflective of the Indian population for making informed decisions.&lt;ref name="hansaresearch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hansaresearch.com/about_irs.asp |title=Indian Readership Survey (IRS) |publisher=Hansaresearch.com |accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Leading newspaper groups of India have jointly condemned the 2013 Indian Readership Survey, calling it badly flawed demanding withdrawal of the survey and a change in [[methodology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/18-top-papers-rubbish-readership-survey-findings/articleshow/29674900.cms |title=18 top media houses rubbish readership survey findings - The Times of India |publisher=Timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=2014-01-31 |accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph Frederick Cullman III''' (April 9, 1912 – April 30, 2004) was an [[United States|American]] businessman, CEO of [[Altria Group|Philip Morris]] Company from 1957 to 1978 and tennis aficionado.

==Biography==
Cullman was born to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family on April 9, 1912 in [[New York City]], the son of Francis Nathan Wolff and Joseph F. Cullman Jr.&lt;ref name=BioDict&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KRjPBj19i-4C&amp;pg=PA228&amp;lpg=PA228&amp;dq=cullman#v=onepage&amp;q=cullman&amp;f=false|first= John N.|last=Ingham|title=Biographical Dictionary of American Business Leaders, Volume 1|pages=228–230 |publisher=Greenwood (1st edition)|date=September 27, 1983|ISBN=9780313239076}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had two brothers [[Edgar M. Cullman]] and [[Lewis B. Cullman]] (married to [[Dorothy Cullman|Dorothy Freedman Cullman]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Fox  |first= Margalit |authorlink=   |title= Edgar M.

In 1929, his father purchased the Webster Tobacco Company after the 1929 stock market collapse where the younger Cullman worked during the summers while attending [[Yale University]] from which he graduated in 1935.&lt;ref name=BioDict /&gt; After college he worked as a clerk in a local tobacco store and then worked at the Uppmann Cigar factory in Cuba.&lt;ref name=BioDict /&gt; In 1941, his father and uncle, [[Howard S. Cullman]], founded an investment company, Cullman Brothers Incorporated, to purchase [[Benson &amp; Hedges]].&lt;ref name=BioDict /&gt; Cullman served during World War II and after the war, he went to work for Benson &amp; Hedges as executive vice president until 1953.&lt;ref name=BioDict /&gt; In 1954, Cullman brothers exchanged its interest in Benson &amp; Hedges for $22.4 million in [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]] stock.&lt;ref name=BioDict /&gt; Cullman was appointed a vice president at Philip Morris in 1954; executive vice president in 1955; president and CEO in 1957; and chairman of the board and CEO in 1967,&lt;ref name=BioDict /&gt; a position he held until 1978.&lt;ref name=LATimesObit&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2004/may/03/local/me-cullman3 "Joseph Cullman III, 92; Made Philip Morris a Power"], ''Los Angeles Times'', 3 May 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

During his tenure as CEO, the Philip Morris brand [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] became the most popular brand of cigarette in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Adam Bernstein, [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-179960.html "Philip Morris Chief Joseph Cullman Dies"], ''The Washington Post'', May 3, 2004 (online at highbeam.com)&lt;/ref&gt; Described as "the cigarette industry’s chief defender against the antitobacco movement",&lt;ref name=LATimesObit /&gt; he oversaw the creation of the successful [[Marlboro Man]] campaign from the 1950s onwards which has since become known as an icon of American [[TV advertising]]. In a now notorious 1971 television interview on the American current affairs program ''[[Face the Nation]]'', in response to a  recently published study on the large numbers of undersized babies born to pregnant female smokers he declared "I concluded from that report that it's true that babies born from women who smoke are smaller, but they are just as healthy as the babies born to women who do not smoke. Some women would prefer having smaller babies."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nndb.com/people/509/000045374/ "Joseph F. Cullman III"], NNDB&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1935, he married Susan Lehman, daughter of [[Harold M.

Away from the tobacco industry he had a great interest in Tennis.  His Company, Philip Morris, at the request of [[Gladys Heldman]], sponsored the first [[Virginia Slims Women's Tennis Tour]] starting in 1970.  He  served as Chairman of the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] at [[West Side Tennis Club|Forest Hills]] in 1969 and 1970 and as both President and Chairman of the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] from 1982 to 1988, into which he was inducted in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tennisfame.com/hall-of-famers/joseph-cullman "Joseph F.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4411">'''Julio Carrizosa Mutis''' is a Colombian businessman active  in the construction and financial sectors in [[Colombia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.semana.com/economia/articulo/termodorada/33836-3|title=TERMODORADA|last=Semana|website=TERMODORADA|access-date=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Career ==
Carrizosa started his business career in the construction industry. He founded the company Industrial de Construcciones in the city of [[Bucaramanga]]. He became a major contractorforf the public entity known as Land Loans Institute ([[Instituto de Credito Territorial]]), which controlled the construction industry. He specialized in the construction of low-cost housing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the 1980s, Carrizosa became the major shareholder of [[Granahorrar Bank]] and an investor in other financial institutions such as Davivienda and Ahorramás. Construction and housing credits (mortgages) became the bank's core businesses. The housing policy of the former President [[Belisario Betancur]] helped boost the bank's success.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-789127|title=EL HOMBRE DE GRANAHORRAR|last=Tiempo|first=Casa Editorial El|website=El Tiempo|language=es-CO|access-date=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1988 to 1998, the bank showed a real annual growth rate of 45%.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.semana.com/economia/articulo/pelea-de-socios/34888-3|title=PELEA DE SOCIOS|last=Semana|website=PELEA DE SOCIOS, Sección Economía, edición 815, Jan 12 1998|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Granahorrar Bank was part of a conglomerate called Grupo Grancolombiano which also owned Banco de Colombia, Colombia’s largest bank. In 1998, the country experienced a financial crisis, and, the Colombian government seized ownership of (expropriated) the bank from Carrizosa.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Granahorrar was expropriated in 1998 as part of the economic policies executed by the Government to mitigate the financial crisis; it was the only bank expropriated without compensation. On October 31, 2005, the government sold the bank to the Spanish Bank [[Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria|BBVA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-2735668|title=Carrizosa, el ganador detrás de Granahorrar|last=Tiempo|first=Casa Editorial El|website=El Tiempo|language=es-CO|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International fight ===
As of September 2018, the Carrizosa family and the Colombian government are fighting over the government's 1998 expropriation of the bank before the United Nations Commission for International Commercial Law (UNCITRAL) in The Hague, Netherlands.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://flbusinessdaily.com/stories/511554673-panel-considers-colombia-s-illicit-use-of-regulatory-authority-in-seizure-of-bank|title=Panel considers Colombia’s “illicit use of regulatory authority” in seizure of bank|last=|first=|date=2018-09-05|work=Florida Business Daily|access-date=2018-09-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dispute is whether the Colombian government overstepped its boundaries and used expropriation as a political weapon, in violation of international trade treaties, in seizing the bank and then selling it for a profit.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Carrizosa family alleges that in 1998, then-President [[Andrés Pastrana Arango|Andres Pastrana]] targeted Granahorrar Bank for seizure for political reasons because Carrizosa had made political donations to the opposite political party.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

The Carrizosa family says that their bank was among the strongest in Colombia at the time it was seized by the government.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A court ordered the government to compensate the Carrizosa family, but the government did not pay because it claimed it didn't have "several hundred million dollars."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The government appealed to overturn the verdict and won. Therefore, the Carrizosa family turned to international arbitration.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Personal life ==
Carrizosa is from the city of Bucaramanga, Santander. He is married to Astrida Benita; together they have three sons, Alberto, Enrique and Felipe Carrizosa. Astrida was born in Latvia and emigrated to the United States after [[World War II]]. All three sons have dual Colombian-American citizenship.

Kata, a Japanese word, meaning {{Nihongo||[[wikt:型|型]] or [[wikt:形|形]]|literally: "form"}}, is a detailed choreographed pattern of movements made to be practiced alone, but are also practiced within groups and in unison when training. It is practiced as a way to memorize and perfect the movement being executed. There are many professions which use the term Kata, but Kata as a term is known generally by the Martial Arts world, and typically reserved for Japanese empty hand combat systems (Karate -meaning empty hand). Traditional Korean Karate, called (Tang Soo Do) uses the term Kata and some Tang Soo Do schools do not, which is brought on by the memory of the Japanese and Korean war, where in at that time traditional Korean Karate was introduced.

Kata are used in many traditional Japanese arts such as theatre forms like [[kabuki]] and schools of tea ceremony (''[[chadō]]''), but are most commonly known for the presence in the martial arts. Kata are used by most [[Japanese martial arts|Japanese]] and [[Okinawan martial arts]], such as [[aikido]], [[judo]], [[kendo]], [[kempo]], and [[karate]].

== Background ==
Kata originally were teaching and training methods by which successful combat techniques were preserved and passed on. Practicing kata allowed a company of persons to engage in a struggle using a systematic approaches, rather by practicing in a repetitive manner the learner develops the ability to execute those techniques and movements in a natural, reflex-like manner. Systematic practice does not mean permanently rigid. The goal is to internalize the movements and techniques of a kata so they can be executed and adapted under different circumstances, without thought or hesitation. A novice’s actions will look uneven and difficult, while a master’s appear simple and smooth.&lt;ref name="Rosen"&gt;Rosenbaum, Michael. ''Kata and the Transmission of Knowledge in Traditional Martial Arts.'' YMAA Publication Center, Boston, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kata'' is a loanword in English, from the 1950s in reference to the [[judo kata]] due to [[Jigoro Kano]], and from the 1970s also of [[karate kata]]; but the word has come to be used as a generic term for "forms" in martial arts in general, or even figuratively applied to other fields.&lt;ref name="Rother"&gt;{{cite book | title=Toyota Kata: Managing People for Improvement, Adaptiveness, and Super Results | publisher=McGraw Hill Education | author=Rother, Mike | year=2010 | location=New York | pages=15-18 | isbn=978007163523-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Japanese martial arts ==
In Japanese martial arts practice, kata is often seen as an essential partner to ''[[randori]]'' training with one complementing the other.{{cn|date=May 2014}} However, the actual type and frequency of kata versus ''randori'' training varies from art to art.{{cn|date=May 2014}} In [[iaido]], solo kata using the Japanese sword ([[katana]]) comprises almost all of the training.{{cn|date=May 2014}} Whereas in [[judo]], kata training is de-emphasized and usually only prepared for [[dan rank|dan]] grading.{{cn|date=May 2014}}

In [[kenjutsu]], paired kata at the beginners level can appear to be stilted.{{cn|date=May 2014}} At higher levels serious injury is prevented only by a high sensitivity of both participants to important concepts being taught and trained for.{{cn|date=May 2014}} These include timing and distance, with the kata practiced at realistic speed. This adjustability of kata training is found in other Japanese arts with roles of attacker and defender often interchanging within the sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Classical Japanese Warrior Training Methods The Kata|url=https://shinmunenryu.org/2018/02/01/classical-japanese-warrior-training-methods-kata/|website=www.shinmunenryu.org|accessdate=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many martial arts use kata for public demonstrations and in competitions, awarding points for such aspects of technique as style, balance, timing, and verisimilitude (appearance of being real).{{cn|date=May 2014}}

=== Karate ===
{{main|Karate kata}}

The most popular image associated with kata is that of a [[karate]] practitioner performing a series of punches and kicks in the air. The kata are executed as a specified series of approximately 20 to 70 moves, generally with stepping and turning, while attempting to maintain perfect form. There are perhaps 100 kata across the various forms of karate, each with many minor variations. The number of moves in a kata may be referred to in the name of the kata, e.g., ''Gojū Shiho'', which means "54 steps." The number of moves may also have links with Buddhist spirituality. The number 108 is significant in Buddhism &amp; Hinduism, and kata with 54, 36, or 27 moves (divisors of 108) are common. The practitioner is generally counselled to visualize the enemy attacks, and his responses, as actually occurring, and ''karateka'' are often told to "read" a kata, to explain the imagined events. Kata can contain techniques beyond the superficially obvious ones. The study of the meaning of the movements is referred to as the [[bunkai]], meaning analysis, of the kata.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110208012048/http://kata-reference.com/ Karate, Okinawan Kobudo and Kendo Kata videos]&lt;/ref&gt;

One explanation of the use of kata is as a reference guide for a set of moves. Not to be used following that "set" pattern but to keep the movements "filed". After learning these kata, this set of learned skills can then be used in a [[sparring]] scenario (particularly without points). The main objective here is to try out different combinations of techniques in a safe, practice environment to ultimately find out how to defeat your opponent.{{cn|date=May 2014}}

[[File:Hiki-otoshi.jpg|right|210px|thumb|[[Koshiki-no-kata]] by Kano(l) and [[Yamashita Yoshitsugu|Yamashita]](r)]]

Recently, with the spread of Extreme Martial arts or XMA, a style of kata called CMX kata has formed.{{cn|date=May 2014}} These kata are performed in tournaments and include gymnastics related elements, such as backflips, cartwheels, and splits.{{cn|date=May 2014}} These kata can also be performed with weapons such as the Bo staff.{{cn|date=May 2014}}

=== Judo ===
{{main|Judo kata}}
[[Judo]] has several kata, mostly created in the late 19th century by [[Kano Jigoro]], the founder of judo. The judo kata involve two participants. Judo kata preserve a number of techniques that are not permitted in competition or in ''randori'', including punches, kicks, and the use of the [[katana]] and other weapons. The study of kata is usually begun typically at around the green belt level. The most commonly studied judo kata is [[Nage-no-kata]], which consists of fifteen throwing techniques. The [[Katame-no-kata]] is composed of pinning techniques, chokes, and joint locks. [[Kime-no-kata]] is a long kata consisting of self-defense techniques against both unarmed attacks, and attacks with swords and knives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.judoinfo.com/katamenu.htm|title=Forms of Judo: Kata – Judo Info|website=www.judoinfo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.judo-snijders.nl/engels/video-kata-judo.html|title=Kata, nage, karame, gonosen, itsutsu, kime, no, video, movie, film, armlock, judo, Judoschool Jan Snijders, Oirschot, Bladel, Deurne, Gemert|first=|last=R.GROULS@WXS.NL|website=www.judo-snijders.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-Japanese martial arts ==
While the Japanese term is most well known in the English language, forms are by no means exclusive to Japan. They have been recorded in [[China]] as early as the [[Tang dynasty]], and are referred to in Mandarin as ''[[Taolu (martial arts)|taolu]]''.{{cn|date=May 2014}}

South and [[Indochinese martial arts|Southeast Asian martial arts]] incorporate both preset and freestyle forms. In [[silat]] these are referred to as ''jurus'' and ''tari'' respectively. Malay folklore credits the introduction of forms to the Buddhist monk [[Bodhidharma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Silat Tua: The Malay Dance Of Life |author=Zainal Abidin Shaikh Awab and Nigel Sutton |year=2006 |publisher=Azlan Ghanie Sdn Bhd |location=Kuala Lumpur |isbn=978-983-42328-0-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[:Category:Korean martial arts|Korean martial arts]] such as [[taekwondo]] and [[Tang Soo Do]], the word ''[[hyung]]'' or ''hyeong'' is usually employed, though in some cases other words are used.{{cn|date=May 2014}} The [[International Taekwon-Do Federation]] uses the word ''[[Hyung|tul]]'', while the [[World Taekwondo Federation]] uses the word ''poomsae'' or simply the English translations "[[pattern]]" or "form."{{cn|date=May 2014}} Taekwondo patterns have multiple variations including ''Palgwe'' and the more popular ''Taeguk'' forms used by the WTF. Forms are included in certain taekwondo competitions and are a key element of gradings.{{cn|date=May 2014}}

In [[Sanskrit]], forms are known either as ''yudhan'' (combat form) or ''pentra'' (tactical deployment).{{cn|date=May 2014}} Other [[Asian martial arts]] refer to forms by various terms specific to their respective languages, such as the Burmese word ''[[aka (Burmese)|aka]]'', the Vietnamese ''quyen'' and the Kashmiri ''khawankay''.{{cn|date=May 2014}}

In the [[Historical European martial arts]] and their modern reconstructions, forms are referred to as plays, drills or flourishes.{{cn|date=May 2014}}

{{other uses}}
More recently [[:wikt:kata#English|kata]] has come to be used in English in a more general or figurative sense,  referring  to any basic form, routine, or pattern of behavior that is practiced to various levels of mastery.&lt;ref&gt;Shook, John. ''Managing to Learn.'' Lean Enterprise Institute, 2008, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japanese language ''kata'' (though written as 方) is a frequently-used suffix meaning “way of doing,” with emphasis on the form and order of the process.  Other meanings are “training method” and “formal exercise.”  The goal of a painter’s practicing, for example, is to merge his consciousness with his brush; the potter’s with his clay; the garden designer’s with the materials of the garden.  Once such mastery is achieved, the theory goes, the doing of a thing perfectly is as easy as thinking it.&lt;ref&gt;DeMenthe, Boye Lafayette. ''Kata, The Key to Understanding and Dealing with the Japanese!'' Tuttle Publishing, 2003, pp. 1–3&lt;/ref&gt;

Kata is a term used by some programmers in the Software Craftsmanship&lt;ref&gt;[[Software craftsmanship|The Software Craftsmanship Movement]]&lt;/ref&gt; movement. Computer programmers who call themselves "Software Craftsmen"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.8thlight.com/micah-martin/2013/05/28/performing-code-katas.html|title=Performing Code Katas - 8th Light|website=8thlight.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; will write 'Kata'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/unclebobconsultingllc/home/articles/what-s-all-this-nonsense-about-katas|title=What's all this Nonsense about Katas? - Clean Coder|website=sites.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; - small snippets of code that they write in one sitting, sometimes repeatedly,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://codekata.com/kata/codekata-how-it-started/|title=CodeKata: How It Started - CodeKata|first=Dave Thomas|last=(@PragDave)|website=codekata.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; often daily, in order to build muscle memory and practise their craft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/unclebobconsultingllc/home/articles/what-s-all-this-nonsense-about-katas|title=What's all this Nonsense about Katas? - Clean Coder|website=sites.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the things that characterize an organization’s culture is its kata – its routines of thinking and practice.&lt;ref&gt;Ichijo, Kazuo and Nonaka, Ikujiro, Knowledge Creation and Management:  New Challenges for Managers, Oxford University Press, 2006, page 25&lt;/ref&gt;  Edgar Schein suggests an organization's culture helps it cope with its environment,&lt;ref&gt;Schein, Edgar. ''Organizational Culture and Leadership: A Dynamic View.'' Jossey-Bass, 1985, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; and one meaning of ''kata'' is, "a way to keep two things in sync or harmony with one another." A task for leaders and managers is to create and maintain the organizational culture through consistent role modeling, teaching, and coaching, which is in many ways analogous to how kata are taught in the martial arts.

'''Larry Clinton Brewer''' (November 22, 1948 &amp;ndash; May 23, 2003) was the offensive end for the [[Louisiana Tech University]] Bulldogs during the 1966, 1967, 1968, and 1969 [[American football|football]] seasons.

==Football career==

In 1968 and 1969, he served as one of two main receivers for [[Terry Bradshaw]], the [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]] native who subsequently embarked on a highly successful career with the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. Brewer caught the first college touchdown pass thrown by Bradshaw. Brewer was initially given a two-year contract with the [[Atlanta Falcons]], but he left the team after sustaining an injury at the [[National Football League Training Camp|training camp]] in [[Johnson City, Tennessee|Johnson City]], [[Tennessee]].
 
In 1969, Brewer was among five members of the Louisiana Tech football team selected for All-Gulf State Conference honors by the Louisiana Sports Writers Association. The others were Bradshaw, [[split end]] [[Tommy Spinks|Thomas Allen "Tommy" Spinks]] of Shreveport and later [[Arlington, Texas|Arlington]], [[Texas]], [[offensive tackle]] Wayne Williams, Jr., later the [[Webster Parish, Louisiana|Webster Parish]] school superintendent, and [[defensive back]] Mark Graham.  Brewer and Spinks were recorded among the top pass receivers in Louisiana Tech history. Seven other Tech players were cited for "honorable mention" by the same sports writers, who also selected Tech [[coach (sport)|coach]] [[Maxie Lambright]] as the GSC "Coach of the Year".

Brewer played in four post-season classics, including two [[Grantland Rice Bowl]]s, the [[North-South Shrine Game]], and the [[Senior Bowl]] in [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], [[Alabama]]. He was voted Minden's "Outstanding Advertiser" a month before "Larry Brewer Day" was observed in his hometown on May 14, 1970.&lt;ref name&gt;''[[Minden Press-Herald]]'', April 16, 1970, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Brewer was born in [[Minden, Louisiana|Minden]] to the former Helen Lockhart (1924-2018), a former civil servant originally from [[Ringgold, Louisiana|Ringgold]] in [[Bienville Parish, Louisiana|Bienville Parish]],&lt;ref name=helenbrewer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press-herald.com/helen-lockhart-brewer/|title=Helen Lockhart Brewer|publisher=''The Minden Press-Herald''|date=October 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Henry Clinton "Clint" Brewer (1920–2008), a graduate of Doyline High School in [[Doyline, Louisiana|Doyline]] in south Webster Parish. The senior Brewer attended [[United Methodist]]-affiliated [[Centenary College of Louisiana|Centenary College]] in [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]], compiled a distinguished military record in [[World War II]], was commissioned a [[Second Lieutenant]] in the [[Louisiana National Guard]], and served as the Webster Parish registrar of voters until his retirement in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nwlanews.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=9798&amp;Itemid=33&lt;/ref&gt;

Larry Brewer played successfully for [[Minden High School (Minden, Louisiana)|Minden High School]], from which he graduated on May 24, 1966. He procured his bachelor's degree from Tech, located in [[Ruston, Louisiana|Ruston]] in [[Lincoln Parish, Louisiana|Lincoln Parish]], and then coached football at several private schools including Trinity Heights Academy in Shreveport and [[Sam Barthe School for Boys]] in [[Metairie, Louisiana|Metairie]] in [[Jefferson Parish]]. Brewer also taught junior high school science at Barthe. His first wife, Nancy, taught mathematics at the same school. Brewer subsequently left coaching and received a [[Master of Science]] degree from the [[University of Louisiana at Monroe]] in [[Ouachita Parish]] and thereafter passed the [[Certified Public Accountant]] examination. He was a hospital administrator in Ruston, Shreveport, and later for the Hillcrest Health Group in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]], [[Oklahoma]].

==Death and family==

Brewer [[drowning|drowned]] while on a family vacation in [[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]]. He is interred in [[Sand Springs, Oklahoma|Sand Springs]] near Tulsa. In addition to his parents, he was survived by his second wife, the former Toni Milam, since Toni Harris of [[Hot Springs, Arkansas|Hot Springs]], [[Arkansas]], the wife of John Harris; three children, Blake, Marcus, and Natalie Brewer, and a brother, Gary Loftin Brewer (born 1951) and his wife, Pamela Hill Brewer, and their three children, of the [[resort]] city of [[Glenwood Springs, Colorado|Glenwood Springs]], [[Colorado]].&lt;ref name=helenbrewer/&gt; 
 
One of Brewer's first cousins, Michael L. "Mike" Brewer (born 1946), was also a highly talented athlete: All-District in football in 1962 and 1963 and All-State in baseball, football, and track in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;''Minden High School Grig'', 1964 edition.&lt;/ref&gt; Mike Brewer signed a football scholarship with [[Louisiana State University]] in [[Baton Rouge]], but like his cousin, his career ended because of an injury. Mike Brewer and his wife, the former Cynthia "Cindy" Williams (born 1947), reside in the [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] [[suburb]] of [[Collierville, Tennessee|Collierville]], Tennessee.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10876">'''Lucy Randolph Mason''' (26 July 1882– 6 May1959) was a 20th-century American labor activist and suffragette.  She was involved in the union movement, the [[Consumer activism|consumer movement]] and the [[civil rights movement]] in the mid-20th century.

==Early life==

Lucy Randolph Mason was born on the [[Clarens (Alexandria, Virginia)|Clarens]] estate in Virginia near [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] July 26, 1882 and grew up near [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.episcopalchurch.org/library/glossary/mason-lucy-randolph|title=Mason, Lucy Randolph|date=2012-05-22|work=Episcopal Church|access-date=2018-11-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mason was one of five children born to Episcopal minister Landon Mason and his wife Lucy Ambler Mason.  She was a fifth-generation descendant of [[George Mason]], author of the [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]] which was the model for the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Salmond|1988|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mason was also related to [[John Marshall]] and [[Robert E. Lee]] (her father's second cousin).

Growing up in the Episcopal church with a clergyman father and devoted mother developed strong social convictions in Lucy and her siblings. After high school, Mason taught herself stenography while teaching Sunday school classes. It was during this time that she began to be interested in women's rights, specifically voting rights, working towards improving conditions for working people and ending racial injustice, specifically in the South.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Salmond|1988|pp=41–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
==Career==
During her 20s while supporting herself as a stenographer, she devoted her free time to volunteer social service work and the suffragette movement.  In 1914 the Richmond [[YWCA USA|YWCA]] offered her a job as its industrial secretary, which she stayed on as until 1918.  In 1918, Mason's mother passed away and she was forced to quit in order to be able to care for her ailing father.  During the years that Mason cared for her father she continued to volunteer for the Union Label League and served as president of both the Richmond Equal Suffrage League and the Richmond League of Women Voters.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1923, Mason's father passed and she returned to the YWCA as the general secretary and remained there until 1932.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Mason_Lucy_Randolph_1882-1959#start_entry|title=Mason, Lucy Randolph (1882–1959)|website=www.encyclopediavirginia.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During her time as general secretary she developed a range of innovative programs that were aimed at training and the economic advancement in the lives of both white and black young women and workers in general.  With the YWCA Mason generated public support for state labor laws that ensure safe workplaces, end [[Child labour|child labor]], raise [[Minimum wage|minimum wages]], and shorten work hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Salmond|1988|pp=53–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mason also traveled throughout the South during this time promoting voluntary employment agreements that incorporated fair labor standards.  To aid this effort she wrote a pamphlet ''Standards for Workers in Southern Industry'' (1931), which was the first pamphlet of its kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Salmond|1988|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

She belonged to the [[Union Label Department, AFL-CIO|Union Label League]] in Richmond and was a frequent speaker to community and labor groups about the importance of buying union made products and services. During World War I, [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL) President, [[Samuel Gompers|Samuel Gompers,]] appointed Mason as the Virginia chairwoman of the [[Women in Industry Committee]], a division of the wartime [[National Advisory Committee on Labor]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/mason-lucy-randolph-1882-1959|title=Mason, Lucy Randolph (1882–1959) {{!}} Encyclopedia.com|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was so successful in her ventures during this time that she drew the interest of other female reformers, [[Florence Kelley|Florence Kelly]] and [[Eleanor Roosevelt|First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt]].  Mason made such an impression that Kelly chose her as successor for her role as secretary of the National Consumers League (NCL).  In 1932 she was appointed as General Secretary to the NCL, and moved to New York, where she lived for five years; working closely with social workers and recruiting staff for relief and welfare agencies created under the [[New Deal]].  It was during this period she met and impressed Eleanor Roosevelt, with whom she was friends with for the rest of their lives.

From the 1900s to the 1930s, the NCL worked to pass protective labor laws and to convince consumers to buy only goods and services produced by workers who enjoyed a living wage and decent working conditions. Under Mason, the NCL won the passage of new state labor laws, lobbied for improved labor codes in the 1933 [[National Industrial Recovery Act]] and helped ensure the passage of the 1938 [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] (FLSA).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Salmond|1988|pp=49, 55–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The South and the CIO ===

In 1937, during congressional hearings on the FLSA, Mason met [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO) President, [[John L. Lewis]], who helped arrange a job for her as the CIO's public relations representative for the South.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Salmond|1988|pp=73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1937, at age 55, Mason moved to Atlanta and started working at the Textile Workers Organizing Committee offices and became the CIO's "roving ambassador" for the next 16 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Salmond|1988|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Mason, the CIO was "a training ground for citizenship" for Southern workers, a vehicle "to bring democracy to the South" and the means to alleviate the economic and racial injustices experienced by minorities and the poor. Mason traveled alone to small towns where union organizers and their sympathizers had been shot, beaten, threatened and jailed. She cornered hostile sheriffs, judges, newspaper editors, politicians and ministers, explaining workers' rights to organize and bargain under the new federal statutes and promoting an understanding of the need for unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Mason|1952|pp=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was known by friend and foe as "Miss Lucy". Her social status as a Southern lady and the daughter of an old, respected Virginia family often gained her access to political and community leaders when others were denied. &lt;blockquote&gt;You can't get much kosher than that in Virginia, but she kind of had an interest in working people that most people of that kind of background don't have...Boy, she was a power.  We would all yell for Lucy anytime that we needed help and she would come into the toughest situations and was great.  She played a tremendous role, a tremendous role. - [[Myles Horton]]&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Miss Lucy's success also rested on her blunt speech, her calm yet steely demeanor and her ability to bring civil liberties violations to the attention of federal officials, including President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. For example, Mason convinced Roosevelt to send a special federal investigator to Memphis in 1940 in the wake of physical attacks on the United Rubber Workers' organizers who were trying to create an interracial union.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Salmond|1988|pp=83–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1944, Mason worked with the CIO Political Action Committee ("[[CIO-PAC]]") in the South, helping to register union members, black and white, and working for the elimination of the [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]]. She also forged lasting links between labor and religious groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Salmond|1988|pp=106–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; She helped get the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] to adopt a resolution in 1938 recognizing "the right of labor to organize and engage in collective bargaining to the end that labor may have a fair and living wage, such as will provide not only the necessities of life, but for recreation, pleasure, and culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Salmond|1988|pp=136–137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s, she organized interfaith, multi-union and interracial groups in Atlanta and other Southern cities of workers dedicated to building bridges between organized labor and the churches. Eventually, these local groups formed the National Religion and Labor Foundation. Mason was dedicated to ending white supremacy in the South, where she was a founding member of the Southern Conference for Human Welfare and she was a frequent speaker at interracial gatherings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1952, Lucy Randolph Mason's autobiography was published called ''To Win These RIghts,'' which contained an introduction written but her close friend, Eleanor Roosevelt.  Then, in 1953, Mason retired from the CIO due to declining health.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  

In 1953, due to ill health, Mason retired from active union work. Then, in 1959, she passed away in a nursing home in Atlanta.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

At the beginning of the 20th century he was one of the most influential people in [[Serbia]], a patriot and a great benefactor, also a philanthropist of education. He was the first president of the [[Belgrade Cooperative]].

==Biography==
He finished his grammar school in [[Trebinje]], [[Banja Luka]] and [[Brčko (town)|Brčko]], and after a basic education, he was denied higher education by Turkish authorities. Instead of languishing there he left [[Bosnia and Hercegovina]] in 1872 for [[Belgrade]], where Archimandrite [[Nićifor Dučić]], a family friend, found him a job as an apprentice in then famous store held by Radosavljević &amp; Ignjatijević.

Three years later, when [[Herzegovina Uprising (1875-1878)]] began, Ćelović went back to his native [[Hercegovina]] as a volunteer soldier. In combat against [[Ottoman empire|Turks]] he was wounded, but soon recovered and continued to fight. When [[Serbia]] declared war on the [[Ottoman Empire]], volunteers from Hercegovina went back to Belgrade, thus Luka continued combating in both Serbo–Turkish wars.

After the war, with the support of his countrymen, traders Aleksa Krsmanović and Rista Parnanos, Ćelović started his own business as an independent merchant, selling plums, corn, wheat and pigs. 

In 1882 he established the Belgrade Cooperative, whose main goal was to help the middle class traders and artists by providing soft loans and avoiding loan sharks. In 1899 Ćelović was elected as President of the Board of the Belgrade Cooperative. Self-taught, with a hard work ethic he made the [[Belgrade Cooperative]] one of the strongest Serbian financial institutions.
 
Ćelović also did a lot to help the weaker member of society, founding the Committee for the Protection of the Blind Girls in Belgrade.
 
Although he had a rudimentary education himself, his concern for the development of science and education was remarkable. It stemmed from the period of his life, during which he was part of the Chetnik movement, when he became closely connected with [[Milorad Gođevac]], general [[Jovan Atanacković]]  and the students from Old Serbia (now Macedonia), leading him to the lifelong conviction that education was the basis of the Serbian future. That and other reasons resulted in his making the [[University of Belgrade]] the sole beneficiary of his fortune when he died. 

Printing of the ''Glasnik Hemijskog Drustva Beograd'' (Bulletin of the Chemical Society) with Nikola A. Pušin as editor and chief, was enabled thanks to financial assistance from the Luka Ćelović-Trebinje Fund.

[[Milorad Gođevac]], impressed by the success of the Bulgarian agents and ''četnici'' in converting the Macedonian Slavs to Bulgarian nationalism, proposed a similar plan of action by Serbia. In 1902 a group of Serbian nationalists, headed by Luka Ćelović and Milorad Gođevac, organized the Executive Committee of the [[Serbian Chetnik Organization]]. Ćelović himself gave generous sums from his very considerable savings to the organization. A Committee (''Komitski odbor'') was organized at [[Vranje]] with branches at [[Leskovac]] and [[Niš]]. Serbia's government for a time discouraged this private action but educators and teachers who suffered at the hands of the Bulgars thought otherwise and eventually impressed upon the government and prevailed. 

Apart from being a successful businessman, Ćelović was also a supportive towards common welfare, he and Dr. Milorad Gođevac, a Belgrade physician, were funding troops to fight for [[Old Serbia]]. The Bulgarian committee noticed the danger in such actions, and sentenced Ćelović and Gođevac to death in absentia. An [[assassin]] was sent by them to Serbia, but he never made it to Belgrade.

Ćelović was indirectly linked with Serbian combat in [[Macedonian Struggle]], by financially helping troops to organize. In fact, Dr. Gođevac established a society which financially aided and recruited men for what became known as the "Četnik Campaign." The first president was Luka Ćelović and the other leaders of the campaign were [[Vasa Jovanović]], [[Ljubomir Kovačević]], [[Žika Rafajlović]] and [[Nikola Spasić]]. The men solicited for the cause, and Luka Ćelović donated the enormous sum of 50,000 ''dinars'' annually to the Četnik Campaign.

==Investing in Belgrade's Architectural Heritage==
Ćelović founded the Belgrade Cooperative and funded the construction of this extravagant and extraordinary building. His memory is best embodied by the buildings that now define [[Savamala]], without him Savamala, as it is now would not exist. His investment in the quarter regenerated this once squalid and frequently flooded market district. Ćelović built his home on "Kraljević Marko" Street as well as building the palatial [[Belgrade Cooperative]], now known as ''Geozavod'', and considered one of the most beautiful buildings in Belgrade, the work of architects Andra Stevanović and Nikola Nestorović. The magnificent [[Hotel Bristol, Belgrade|Hotel Bristol]], near [[Park Bristol]] and [[Park Luka Ćelović]] is the other gem in the Savamala neighbourhood. The buildings are his only real legacy, and their combination of using new architectural techniques and promoting Serbian [[Baroque]] and [[Art Nouveau]] in Belgrade show Ćelović to be a true visionary.

==Aftermath==
In his will, after passing away, Ćelović left almost all of his property to the [[University of Belgrade]]. Besides, he has founded an endowment named "A Foundation of Luka Ćelović – Trebinjac"

'''Maximilian Egon II, Prince of Fürstenberg''' (1863 – 1941) was a German landowner and investor. He was a member of the [[House of Fürstenberg]] and a minor noble in several German-speaking states, including [[Austria]].

==Family==

Born as Maximilian Egon Christian Karl Aloys Emil Leo Richard Anton, [[Fürstenberg (princely family)|Prince of Fürstenberg]], he was the son of Maximilian Egon, Prince of Fürstenberg, and his wife Leontina, Countess of [[Khevenhüller]]-Metsch. He had a younger brother, born in 1867, named Karl Emil Egon, Prince of Fürstenberg.

By his marriage to Countess Irma von [[Schönborn-Buchheim]], he had three sons and two daughters:
* Karl Egon V zu Fürstenberg (1891–1973)
* Leontina zu Fürstenberg (1892–1979)
* Anna zu Fürstenberg (1894–1928)
* Maximilian Egon zu Fürstenberg (1896–1959)
* Friedrich Eduard zu Fürstenberg (1898–1916)

He also had an illegitimate daughter, Marie-Louise-Auguste von Almey, by a liaison with ''[[Freiin]]'' Marguerite von Almey.

==Life==
A close friend and adviser of Emperor [[Wilhelm II of Germany]],&lt;ref name=conze/&gt; Max of Fürstenberg inherited territorial titles in [[Prussia]], [[Austria]], [[Hungary]], [[Württemberg]] and [[Baden]], and by virtue of them had a seat in the House of Lords in each of the five states. Until the [[World War I|First World War]], he was vice-president of the [[Prussian House of Lords]]. 

His principal residence was at [[Donaueschingen]], near the source of the [[Danube]], where he owned a castle and great deer forests. Emperor Wilhelm II frequently visited him there, and Max invariably accompanied the Emperor on his hunting expeditions and [[Norway|Norwegian]] trips. As well as his vast ancestral forests, he also owned coal mines, hotels and breweries.{{sfn|Rines|1920}}

Although he was a member of the high Roman Catholic ''[[Uradel]]'' who had long stood aloof from party politics, after meeting [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Ernst Roehm]] in November 1933, Max became enthusiastic about Hitler's leadership, commenting that "It was wonderful, to be able to meet such a great man".&lt;ref name=conze&gt;Eckart Conze, Monika Wienfort, eds., ''Adel und Moderne: Deutschland im europäischen Vergleich im 19. und 20. Jahrhundert'' , [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SzblA-uuDLEC&amp;pg=136#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 136]: "Es war herrlich, diesem einzig grossen Mann gegenueberstehen zu duerfen."&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year, 1933, he joined the [[Nazi Party]] and the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]]. In 1938, he was appointed to the rank of ''[[Standartenführer]]''. He died in 1941, during the [[World War II|Second World War]], and was succeeded by his son, Karl Egon V (1891–1973).&lt;ref&gt;John Kennedy, John E.

Henslin|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis US|year=2002|page=159|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=852vjh_IwusC&amp;pg=PA159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/means_of_production |title=means of production |author=Oxford Dictionaries |date= |publisher=Oxford Dictionaries |accessdate=7 December 2017|quote= the facilities and resources for producing goods. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the terminology of [[classical economics]], the means of production are the "[[factors of production]]" minus [[financial capital|financial]] and [[human capital]].

The '''social means of production''' are capital goods and assets that require organized collective labor effort, as opposed to individual effort, to operate on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Selected Political Writings|author=Karl Kautsky|publisher=978-0333283844|year=1983|page=9|quote= "Here we encounter a further characteristic of the modern wage proletarian. He works not with individual but with social means of production, means of production so extensive that they can be operated only by a society of workers, not by the individual worker."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ownership and organization of the social means of production is a key factor in categorizing and defining different types of [[economic system]]s.

The means of production includes two broad categories of objects: ''[[instruments of labor]]'' (tools, [[factories]], [[infrastructure]], ''etc.'') and ''[[subjects of labor]]'' ([[natural resource]]s and [[raw material]]s). People operate on the subjects of labor using the instruments of labor to create a product; or stated another way, labor acting on the means of production creates a good.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Evans, ''Karl Marx'', London, England, 1975. Part II, Chap. 2, sect. a; p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; In an [[agrarian society]] the principal means of production is the soil and the shovel. In an [[industrial society]] the means of production become social means of production and include factories and mines. In a [[knowledge economy]], computers and networks are means of production. In a broad sense, the "means of production" also includes the "means of [[Distribution (economics)|distribution]]" such as stores, the internet and railroads ([[Infrastructural capital]]).&lt;ref&gt;Flower, B. O. ''The Arena'', Volume 37. The Arena Pub. Co, originally from Princeton University. p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marxian analysis ==
The analysis of the technological sophistication of the means of production and how they are owned is a central component in the [[Marxist]] theoretical framework of historical materialism and in [[Marxian economics]].

In Marx's work and subsequent developments in Marxist theory, the process of [[socioeconomic]] evolution is based on the premise of [[technological improvements]] in the means of production. As the level of technology improves with respect to productive capabilities, existing forms of [[Social relations of production|social relations]] become superfluous and unnecessary, creating contradictions between the level of technology in the means of production on the one hand and the [[organization of society]] and its [[economy]] on the other. These contradictions manifest themselves in the form of [[class conflicts]], which develop to a point where the existing mode of production becomes unsustainable, either collapsing or being overthrown in a [[social revolution]]. The contradictions are resolved by the emergence of a new mode of production based on a different set of [[social relations]] including, most notably, different patterns of ownership for the means of production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/m/o.htm#mode-production Mode of Production]. Marxism.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Ownership of the means of production and control over the [[surplus product]] generated by their operation is the fundamental factor in delineating different [[modes of production]]. Capitalism is defined as private ownership and control over the means of production, where the surplus product becomes a source of [[unearned income]] for its owners. By contrast, [[socialism]] is defined as [[social ownership]] of the means of production so that the surplus product accrues to [[society]] at large.

=== Determinant of class ===
Marx's theory of class defines classes in their relation to their ownership and control of the means of production. In a capitalist society, the [[bourgeoisie]], or the capitalist class, is the class that owns the means of production and derives a passive income from their operation. In contrast, the [[proletariat]], or [[working class]], comprises the majority of the population that lacks access to the means of production and are therefore induced to sell their [[labor power]] for a wage or salary to gain access to necessities, goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Ishiyama, Breuning |first= John, Marijke|title= 21st Century Political Science: A Reference Handbook |publisher= SAGE Publications, Inc |date= October 22, 2010|isbn= |page = |quote= For Marx, class was defined by an individual’s relationship to the means of production...Class is determined by the extent to which people own most, some, or little of the means of production, or by their relationship to the means of production. It is generally conflict over control or access to the means of production that drives history. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To the question of why classes exist in [[human societies]] in the first place, Karl Marx offered a [[Marx's theory of history|historical]] and scientific explanation that it was the [[cultural practice]] of ownership of the means of production that gives rise to them. This explanation differs dramatically from other explanations based on "differences in ability" between individuals or on religious or political affiliations giving rise to [[castes]]. This explanation is consistent with the bulk of Marxist theory in which Politics and [[Marxism and religion|Religion]] are seen as mere outgrowths ([[base and superstructure|superstructures]]) of the basic underlying economic reality of a people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marx2mao.com/M&amp;E/SUS80.html Frederick Engels: Socialism: Utopian and Scientific Chapter III Historical Materialism] Marx2mao.com.  p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related terms ==
[[Factors of production]] are defined by German [[economist]] [[Karl Marx]] in his book ''[[Das Kapital]]'' as labor, [[subjects of labor]], and instruments of labor: the term is equivalent to means of production plus labor. The factors of production are often listed in economic writings derived from the [[classical economics|classical school]] as "land, labour and capital". Marx sometimes used the term "productive forces" equivalently with "factors of production;" in ''Kapital'', he uses "factors of production", in his famous Preface to the ''[[Critique of Political Economy]]'', he uses "productive forces" (that may depend on the translation).

[[relations of production|Production relations]] (German: ''Produktionsverhältnis'') are the relations humans enter into with each other in using the means of production to produce. Examples of such relations are [[employer]]/employee, buyer/seller, the technical division of labour in a factory, and property relations.

[[Mode of production]] (German: ''Produktionsweise'') means the dominant way in which production is organised in society. For instance, "[[capitalism]]" is the name for the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist ''mode of production'']] in which the means of production are [[Private property|owned privately]] by a small [[Social class|class]] (the [[bourgeoisie]]) who profits off the labor of the [[working class]] (the [[proletariat]]). [[Communism]] is a mode of production in which the means of production are not owned by anyone, but [[Common ownership|shared in common]], without class based [[exploitation of labour|exploitation]].

==Overview==
The text focuses on subtle and invisible trends in demography, sociology, business, family life, technologies, human interactions, and many other areas—that are currently shaping the potential future the world and society. Overall, the authors try to categorize approximately 75 microtrends (hence the name of the book) seen in the modern world.

==WSJ column==
The book examines how small groups of people can trigger big changes. Specifically, Penn shows how a mere one percent of the American public, or 3 million people, can create a "microtrend" capable of launching a major business or even a new cultural movement, changing commercial, political and social landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.penguincatalogue.co.uk/lo/press/title.html?titleId=3877&amp;catalogueId=214|title=Microtrends |publisher=Penguin Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; From December 2008 to December 2009, Penn authored a regular online column for the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' called "Microtrends", focusing on demographic trends in society and business. ''Microtrends'' appeared regularly in the Media &amp; Marketing section of the ''Wall Street Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsjmediakit.com/pdf/digital/press.20081211a.pdf|work=Wall Street Journal|title=Mark Penn to Author "Microtrends" Column for wsj.com | date=December 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
{{quote| "Microtrends" is a diligently researched tome chock-full of counterintuitive facts and findings that may radically alter the way you see the present, the future, and your places in both. The book’s 15 main chapters group microtrends in virtually every area of life, like "Love, Sex, and Relationships," "Politics," "Technology," "Education," "Food, Drink &amp; Diet" and "Looks and Fashion." ... "Microtrends" is the perfect bible for a game of not-so-trivial pursuits concerning the hidden sociological truths of modern times.}}

'''Molasky Corporate Center''' is a 17-story office and retail building in [[downtown Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. The building was developed by [[Irwin Molasky]]'s company, The Molasky Group. Construction began in 2005, and the building was [[Topping out|topped off]] in July 2006, before opening in August 2007. The Molasky Corporate Center is a [[green building]] designed with energy efficient features which earned it a Gold certification from the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED). The [[Southern Nevada Water Authority]] is a major tenant in the building, and owns five of the building's office floors.

==History==
In December 2004, developer [[Irwin Molasky]] was planning a $75 million office building in [[downtown Las Vegas]] through his company, The Molasky Group. The project, known as Parkway Center, would be located on property at the intersection of Grand Central Parkway and F Street (later renamed City Parkway),&lt;ref name=Touts/&gt; directly south of [[U.S. Route 95 in Nevada|Highway 95]] and [[Interstate 15 in Nevada|Interstate 15]].&lt;ref name=Water/&gt;&lt;ref name=TopGreen/&gt; The vacant {{convert|2.3|acre|abbr=on|sing=on}} property&lt;ref name=Private/&gt; was worth $2 million, and the city gave Molasky the land on the condition that he use it for the construction of extensive office space to generate substantial [[Property tax in the United States|property taxes]] for the city.&lt;ref name=Authority/&gt; The 14 ½-story building would include a 6 ½-story parking garage topped by eight floors of office space.&lt;ref name=Authority/&gt; The project, designed by Howard F. Thompson &amp; Associates,&lt;ref name=Trust/&gt; would include {{convert|192000|sqft|abbr=on}} of office space.&lt;ref name=Water&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brean|first1=Henry|last2=Kalil|first2=J.M.|title=Water authority considers move to new building: Board scheduled to vote on plan to go downtown|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com:80/lvrj_home/2004/Dec-14-Tue-2004/news/25470779.html|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|date=December 14, 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050307155959/http://www.reviewjournal.com:80/lvrj_home/2004/Dec-14-Tue-2004/news/25470779.html|archivedate=March 7, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in December 2004, the [[Southern Nevada Water Authority]] (SNWA) approved plans to lease at least five floors of office space in the building, totaling {{convert|129000|sqft|abbr=on}}, with the option to lease further space in the future.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2942">The '''Moore family''' was a prominent political family of North and South Carolina during the 18th and 19th centuries.  They are believed to be related to or descended from [[Rory (Roger) O'Moore|Roger O'Moore]], a leader of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]].  The family is most closely associated with the [[Cape Fear (region)|Cape Fear]] coastal region around [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]].  Several members of the family held prominent political positions in colonial North and South Carolina, were officers in the [[Continental Army]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]], or held high positions in the United States federal government during the early years of the republic.

== Governor James Moore ==

{{main|James Moore (South Carolina politician)}}

Governor James Moore was the patriarch of the family.  He served as the governor of the [[Province of Carolina]] from 1700-1703.  He had two prominent sons, [[James Moore II|James]] and [[Maurice Moore (Carolina legislator)|Maurice]].

== James Moore II ==
{{main|James Moore II}}

James Moore II was a colonel in the colonial militia who served in the [[Yamassee War]] and would be a governor of the [[Province of South Carolina]] after North and South Carolina split.  He served in that position 1719-1721.

== Maurice Moore ==

Maurice had been a speaker of the North Carolina legislature.  As speaker the Maurice Moore had championed settlement of the Cape Fear region under [[George Burrington|Governor George Burrington]] and led frequent conflicts with Burrington's successor, [[Sir Richard Everard, 4th Baronet|Richard Everard]].  Maurice had two sons, named James and Maurice.

== Maurice Moore II ==

Maurice Moore II had been appointed as a Judge, but when the younger Maurice became a vocal opponent of the [[Stamp Act]], he was removed from the bench by [[William Tryon|Governor William Tryon]].  Both he and his brother James served in the colonial legislature.  He had at least one son, Alfred.

== General James Moore ==
{{main|James Moore (Continental Army officer)}}

General James Moore served in the Continental Army, first as a colonel, and later, after he distinguished himself leading the troops at the [[Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge]], as a Brigadier General and commander of the [[Departments of the Continental Army|Southern Department]], a position he would only hold for a few months before his sudden death in April, 1777.

== Alfred Moore ==
{{main|Alfred Moore}}

Alfred Moore would serve as an officer in the Continental Army, and later as an Associate Justice of the [[United States Supreme Court]].

== Other people related to the Moore family ==

*General [[Robert Howe (Continental Army officer)|Robert Howe]] was a Major General in the Continental Army and was a great-grandson of Governor James Moore.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3534">[[Image:Recycle001.svg|thumb|right|173px|The international [[recycling symbol]] ]] '''myGreenElectronics''' is a public service online portal for consumers to recycle or reuse their electronics products once they have reached [[end-of-life (product)|end-of-life]].  It was designed by The [[Consumer Electronics Association]] to empower consumers to make what some people consider "responsible choices" throughout their products’ life cycle (purchasing, use, reuse, and recycling), but does not specifically endorse any one company or business practice, and is meant to be an objective resource.

==Uses==
There are two main ways that consumers use this site
# It allows consumers to identify  [[Green syndicalism|"green]] products".  The green product database includes various items such as baby monitors, cell phones, plasma TVs and  [[environmentally friendly|eco-friendly]] accessories.  
#It gives consumers the opportunity to find an [[Recycling|electronics recycler]] in their area using a zip-code search.

==Additional components==
Aside from the immediate functional uses,  the site educates the public on how to "reduce" their energy usage and "rethink" the way they consume electronics products.  In order to "reduce" the amount of electricity consumer's products consume, it advises that consumers look for the [[Energy Star]] logo on the products that they buy.  A comprehensive list of advice and recommendations are available in the "Reduce" section of the site. 
Thus, it encourages consumers to "rethink" ways in which they can make smarter, environmentally friendlier choices when purchasing electronics products.

==Varying perspectives on electronics recycling==
There are some entities in the United States and abroad that raise serious concerns about electronics recycling.  Some groups are concerned that the workers who do the actual recycling are exposed to toxins that can be harmful to their health.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.computertakeback.com/ ''Toxic Sweatshops'' - Computer Takeback Campaign&lt;/ref&gt;    MyGreenElectronics represents a consumer-driven voluntary approach to recycling.  Some people believe that the government should do more to compel consumers to pay for an advance fee for the future recycling cost of their product.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gnet.org/news/newsdetail.cfm?Page=1&amp;NewsID=34648{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''States Take on E-Waste Problem'' - GreenBiz.com&lt;/ref&gt;  Others believe that manufacturers of electronics should take full responsibility for the recycling or disposal of their products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cbs5.com/consumer/local_story_066004605.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070318232232/http://cbs5.com/consumer/local_story_066004605.html |archivedate=2007-03-18 |df= }} ''HP, Other Computer Firms Boost Recycling Efforts'' - CBS News&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ritual servitude(trokosi system)
''' is a practice in [[Ghana]], [[Togo]], and [[Benin]] where traditional religious shrines (popularly called [[fetish shrines]] in Ghana) take human beings, usually young virgin girls, in payment for services, or in religious atonement for alleged misdeeds of a family member. In Ghana and in Togo it is practiced by the [[Ewe people|Ewe tribe]] in the Volta region; in Benin it is practiced by the [[Fon people|Fon]].&lt;ref&gt;FAQ About the Form of Slavery Called Trokosi, ECM Publications, 2002, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

These shrine slaves serve the priests, elders, and owners of a traditional religious shrine without remuneration and without their consent, although the consent of the family or clan may be involved.  Those who practice ritual servitude usually feel that the girl is serving the god or gods of the shrine and is married to the gods of the shrine.&lt;ref&gt;''Field Findings on the System of Slavery Commonly Known as Trokosi'', L W Rouster, M.R.E., ECMAfrica Publications, 2005, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

If a girl runs away or dies, she must be replaced by another girl from the family. Some girls in ritual servitude are the third or fourth girl in their family suffering for the same crime, sometimes for something as minor as the loss of trivial property.

It is still practiced in the Volta region in Ghana, in spite of being outlawed in 1998, and despite carrying a minimum three-year prison sentence for conviction. Among the Ewes who practice the ritual in Ghana, variations of the practice are also called ''trokosi'', ''fiashidi'', and ''woryokwe'', with "trokosi" being the most common of those terms.&lt;ref&gt;"The Revealed Myths about Trokosi Slavery/Human Rights Violations" by Stephen Awudi Gadri, Authorhouse, UK, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In Togo and Benin it is called ''voodoosi'' or ''vudusi''.&lt;ref&gt;"Field Findings on the System of Slavery Commonly Known as Trokosi", L W Rouster, M.R.E., ECMAfrica Publications, 2005, p.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Victims are commonly known in Ghana as fetish slaves because the gods of African Traditional Religion are popularly referred to as fetishes and the priests who serve them as fetish priests.

==Other names==
''Trokosi'': the general name by which it is called in Ghana by both proponents and opponents of the practice

''Ritual'' or ''customary servitude'': designations by which it is called in Ghana law forbidding the practice

''Fiashidi'': another name used by some districts in Ghana

''Woryokwe'': another name used by some districts in Ghana

''Vudusi'' (also voodoosi, voudousi, vaudounsi, voudounsi, etc.): the general name by which it is called in French-speaking countries such as Togo and Benin

''Shrine slavery'': a designation often used by NGOs to describe the practice&lt;ref&gt;Rouster, ''Wives of the gods--An Analysis of West African Ritual Servitude'', L W Rouster, M.R.E., ECMAfrica Publications, 2008, PO Box 810, Hebron, IN 46341,'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fetish slavery'': a popular designation used in Ghana, where "fetish" refers to the deity of the shrine

''Hierodulic slavery'': a designation used by anti-slavery groups meaning sacred or religious slavery&lt;ref&gt;"Hierodulic Slavery" www.anti-slaverysociety.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of the terms "servitude", "slave" and "slavery"==
Human rights organizations and other NGO's commonly use the words "servitude", "slaves", and "slavery" as non-technical, popularly understood terms that describe the reality of this practice.  They point out that the practice meets all the commonly accepted definitions of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;''Rouster, Wives of the gods'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
Shrine slaves perform services which are not voluntary and are not paid.  Their lives are totally controlled by the shrines, who in a sense become their owners.

Proponents of the system  of ritual servitude by any of its names object to this term, but except for the technical terms "trokosi", "vudusi", "fiashidi", "woryokoe", the problem is coming up with a suitable alternative.  Sometimes they have compared the trokosi to traditional queen mothers, implying a sense of respect for them, but one representative of an NGO who claims to have interviewed hundreds of participants reports that the participants themselves are offended at being called queens and insist they are/were simply slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Rouster, ''Wives of the gods'' p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Juliana Dogbadzi, who served 17 years as a trokosi, says she was "slave to a fetish priest".&lt;ref&gt;Juliana Dogbadzi, PARADE magazine, "One Voice," September 24, 2000, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Cudjoe Adzumah made a study of the practice in the Tongu Districts of Ghana and defined "trokosi" as "slaves of the gods".&lt;ref&gt;Cudjoe Adzumah, "The Trokosi Practice in N Tongu: Its Impact on the Rights of Women and Children, BA Thesis, Sociology Department, University of Ghana, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Emmanuel Kwaku Akeampong, a native Ghanaian of Harvard University, says that "tro" means a "god" and "kosi" is used at different times to mean either "slave", "virgin", or "wife".&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel Kwaku Akeampong, ''Between the Sea and the Lagoon, an Eco-Social History of the Anlo of Southeastern Ghana c. 1850 to Recent Times,'' Ohio University Press, Athens, OH, James Currey, Oxford, 2001, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; Anita Ababio, a Ghanaian lawyer who has extensively researched the issue, explains that the Adangbe and Ga word, "woryokwe" comes from "won" meaning cult, and "yokwe", meaning "slave".  Thus, she claims, a "woryokwe" is a "slave of a cult".&lt;ref&gt;Anita Mamusina Heymann Ababio, "Trokosi, Woryokwe, Cultural and Individual Rights: A Case Study of Women's Empowerment and Community Rights in Ghana, St. Mary's University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, August 22, 2000, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Kwame Amen in ''Ghana Studies'' also refers to trokosi as an institution of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;
Robert Kwame Amen, ''Trokosi (Child Slavery) in Ghana, a Policy Approach'', Ghana Studies I, 1998, p. 35-62.&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, Stephen Awudi Gadri, President of the Trokosi Abolition Fellowship of Ghana, and also himself from a shrine family, claims that trokosi are "slaves of the deities of the shrines".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Awudi Gadri, ''History of the Trokosi System in Ghana'', Vol. 1, Paper presented to the First National Congress on the Trokosi System, June 29, 2000, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;   "Though euphemistically, they are called the 'deity's wives', yet they serve the priests and elders of the shrine and do all the hard chores, as well as becoming sexual partners of the priest," Gadri says.&lt;ref&gt;Gadri, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also says, "the trokosi works for the priest without any form of remuneration whatsoever", and "it is a form of slavery".&lt;ref&gt;Gadri, p. 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt;
Ababio claims, "The servile status of the trokosi is seen in the duties they perform in the shrines, for which no payment is made...unfortunately for most trokosi, when they are freed they are still bound by rituals which keep them connected or attached to a shrine for life. Practically it means that these victims of ritual servitude always have the rights of ownership exercised over them."&lt;ref&gt;Ababio, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; She then goes on to quote Article 7 of ''The Convention on Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery'', which defines a slave as "a person over whom any or all powers attaching to the rights of ownership are exercised".  Angela Dwamena-Aboagye, a Ghanaian lawyer, says ritual servitude is "slavery, pure and simple.  It violates every human right."&lt;ref&gt;Ababio, quoting ''The Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery'', 1956, ECOSOC, Res. 608, XXI, 1956.  This convention has been ratified and acceded to by Ghana.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the traditional priests also admit the trokosi are slaves.  For example, Togbe Adzimashi Adukpo, a shrine priest, admitted in an interview with BBC in February 2001, "Yes, the girls are my slaves.  They are the property of my shrine."&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey Hawaley, "Ghana's Trapped Slaves", BBC News, February 8, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the question of whether trokosi is a form of slavery and whether sexual abuse is involved the answers are polarized into two camps.  Some traditionalists defend the system saying that it is simply a cultural practice of certain shrines and as such should be protected.  These defenders claim that while instances of sexual abuse may occur, there is no evidence that sexual or physical abuse is an ingrained or systematic part of the practice.  According to them, the practice explicitly forbids a Trokosi to engage in sexual activity or contact.  The other camp is represented by NGOs working with the trokosi and by former trokosi who have been liberated.  These opponents of the practice have recorded testimony of hundreds of former (now liberated) trokosi who say that sexual abuse was a regular part of their time at the shrine, claiming the number of children born to them by the priest and shrine elders is a witness.&lt;ref&gt;Rouster, Field Findings, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although virtually everyone recognizes that the victims themselves have no choice or say in their lot, Stephen Awudi Gadri says that "both the parents (of the victims) and the girls (that is, the victims) have no choice".&lt;ref&gt;The Revealed Myths about Trokosi Slavery", p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious connections==
Simon Abaxe has researched the practice in Ghana.  He says that ritual servitude is part of African Traditional Religion in some places, but not a universal practice of that religion.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Abaxer, "Trokosi Situation on the Ground in Volta Region", ECMAfrica Publications, 2007, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  A form of it is also practiced in India and Nepal as part of Hindu religion, and various forms of it were part of ancient religious traditions of devotion to various gods and goddesses.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}  It is distinguished from the Christian monastic tradition at a basic level since ritual servitude is involuntary on the part of the participant, in contrast to Christian monasticism, which is voluntary.&lt;ref&gt;Rouster, ''Field Findings'' p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons==
There are two major reasons for the practice of ritual servitude.  Most common is the concept of atonement.  A girl is given to the shrine or to the gods as a kind of "living sacrifice" to atone for the real or alleged crimes of a family member or ancestor, as discerned by the priest of the shrine.  During a process of divination he calls on the gods of the shrine to reveal this information.  Girls given to atone for such crimes in a sense are considered a kind of savior, for as long as she remains in the shrine or under its control, the anger of the god is believed to be averted from the rest of the family.&lt;ref name="Rouster, Field Findings p. 5"&gt;Rouster, ''Field Findings'' p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second most frequent reason for the practice of ritual servitude is that the girl is given for the continuous repayment of the gods for services believed to have been obtained or favors believed to have been rendered from the shrine.  Thus a girl may be given into ritual servitude when someone believes a child has been conceived or a person has been healed, for example, through the intervention of the shrine.&lt;ref name="Rouster, Field Findings p. 5"/&gt;

Proponents of the practice claim that some participants choose a life of ritual servitude of their own volition, but human rights organizations claim that while this may be theoretically possible, they haven't found one yet.&lt;ref&gt;Rouster, ''Field Findings'' p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, the traditions of the shrines were veiled in secrecy, and people dared not discuss them, fearing the wrath of the gods if they dared to do so.  For this reason, the practice was neither widely known nor well understood.  In more recent times, since the 1990s at least, abolitionists and human rights advocates have penetrated the veil of secrecy.  The issue has been widely discussed, for instance, in the newspapers and on the radio in Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;Every Child Ministries, ''The Three Pillars of Trokosi'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and history==

===In the Dahomey Empire===
The giving of virgin girls to the gods was part of many ancient religions.  In West Africa, the practice has gone on for at least several hundred years.  Similar practices using similar terminology were found in the royal court of the Kingdom of Dahomey (in what is now Benin) in the 18th and 19th centuries.  Wives, slaves, and in fact all persons connected with the royal palace of Dahomey were called "ahosi", from "aho" meaning "king", and "si" meaning "dependent" or "subordinate."&lt;ref&gt;Wives of the Leopard-- Gender, Politics &amp; Culture in the Kingdom of Dahomey, Edna G. Bay, University of Virginia Press, 1998, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;   By one estimate there were 5,000 to 7,000 ahosi living in the palace at Abomey,&lt;ref&gt;Warrior Women, The Amazons of Dahomey &amp; the Nature of War", Robert B. Edgerton, University of California at Los Angeles, Westview Press, 2000, p. 15 &amp; 52.&lt;/ref&gt; and no men lived there except for a few hundred eunuchs were charged with controlling the women.  After sunset no men at all were allowed in the palace except the king, and he was guarded by women guards called Amazons.  The king controlled every aspect of the lives and even the deaths of the ahosi.  Visitors to old Abomey today are shown a mass grave and told that the king's wives "volunteered," on his death, to be buried alive with him in order to accompany him and serve him in the world to come.  One researcher pointed out, "Of course, one should not make the mistake of ascribing modern democratic meaning to the word "volunteered" as if the wives wanted to die or had any choice in the matter.&lt;ref&gt;"Lorella Rouster, Report on Visit to the Ancient Kingdom of Dahomey, May 2006, ECM Publications, p.2.&lt;/ref&gt; Ahosi who became too powerful or too independently minded were simply sacrificed (literally and physically) in the annual office ceremony lasting several days in which the power of the king was renewed by hundreds of human sacrifices, usually performed by public beheadings.&lt;ref&gt;Edgerton, Warrior Women, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice was documented by [[A. B. Ellis]] who was an eyewitness of the practice in the Dahomey Empire (now Benin) in 1879. According to Ellis, one god called "Khebioso" had 1500 wives in Dahomey alone, the women being called "kosio".  He said they cared for the shrines of the gods, but their main business was religious prostitution.  According to Ellis, most of the gods of the Ewe-speaking people at that time had such women who were similarly consecrated to their service and were commonly considered "wives" of the gods.&lt;ref&gt;A. B. Ellis, Major, First Battalion West India Regiment, ''The Ewe-Speaking Peoples of the Slave Coast of West Africa'', Bahamas, 1890, republished by Benin Press, Chicago, 1965, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

One might argue that those ahosi were wives of the king and lived in the palace, not wives of the gods living in the shrines.  But that distinction is not as clearcut as it might first seem, for the palace was the center of Dahomean religious life, and the place where sacrifices were made and rituals to the ancestors were performed.  Over time, then, it was an easy jump from being ahosi living lives totally controlled by the king in the palace where sacrifices were offered and rituals were performed, to being trokosi living lives totally controlled by a priest in a shrine where sacrifices were offered and rituals were performed.  It was a very easy transition indeed.  Even in the time of the Kingdom of Dahomey, one reads of the vodun or gods successfully demanding that someone become a devotee or vodunsi (wife or follower of the god).&lt;ref&gt;Wives of the Leopard, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Ghana===
As people migrated within West Africa, the practice spread.  Sandra Greene has noted that in Ghana, the practice dates to at least the late 18th century.  At the time the Amlade clan Sui became very powerful, and began to demand female slaves from those who sought its services.  The practice called "replacement" also began in Ghana at that time.  Under this practice, if a shrine slave died or ran away, the family was required to replace her with another girl.&lt;ref&gt;Sandra E. Greene, Gender, Ethnicity and Social Change on the Upper Slave Coast: A History of the Anlo-Ewe, Portsmouth, 1996, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the 19th century, Nyigbla became the chief Anlo deity, and its shrines also began to demand slaves for its services.  Involuntary slavery, however, was not at that time and in that place common, since Nyigbla also instituted a practice called foasi, whereby two servants were recruited annually on a more-or-less voluntary basis.  At that time, the slaves were often married to members of powerful priestly families.&lt;ref&gt;Akeampong,p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of opposition to the practice==

===In colonial times===
It is reported by traditionalists that since the mid-18th century the Bremen missionaries decried the practice and purchased freedom for individual trokosi, which were then called "new made slaves", converting them to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mypage.bluewin.ch/yehwehpyramid/trokosi.html Pyramid of Yahweh, about trokosi, p. 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

When Ghana (then [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]]) was under colonial rule, a few citizens complained about the practice, but the colonial masters turned their heads.  They derided him{{who|date=July 2012}} as "the blind man who wants to help others see".  The colonial government did investigate the practice at Atigo shrine near Battor from 1919 to 1924.  The investigating District Commissioner, W. Price Jones, called it "a pernicious habit of handing girls over to the fetish", but for economic reasons, decided not to interfere.  As a result of that inquiry, shrine slaves held at the Atigo shrine were told they could return home if they wished.&lt;ref&gt;National Archives of Ghana, Accra, ADM 11/1/768 Acting District Commissioner of Ada, W. Price Jones to Commissioner for the Eastern Province (CEP), 10 March 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;  Soon after, the colonial government ignored another complaint that the shrine was still keeping trokosi.&lt;ref&gt;National Archives of Ghana, CEP, to Secretary of Native Affairs, Koforidua, 10 September 1924.&lt;/ref&gt; After that, the practice slid back into secrecy and was not brought to the public consciousness again until 1980.

===In the 1980s===
The practice was drawn into the national spotlight at that time when [[Mark Wisdom]], a Baptist pastor, responded to what he claims was a vision from God, and challenged the system in the national media. Wisdom claimed that as he prayed, he saw a vision of women in bonds, crying out for help.  Wisdom claimed to have later discovered these same women on one of his evangelistic missions, held in bondage in a shrine just across the Volta River from his home, but previously unknown to him.  He began publicly denouncing the practice, so much so that headlines in Ghana screamed that he was not afraid of the shrine priests.  Wisdom wrote a book on the subject, founded FESLIM (Fetish Slaves Liberation Movement), and was instrumental in some of the earliest liberations, but it was his bold public statements reported in the news that pricked the national consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Mark Wisdom granted to the VR staff of Every Child Ministries, June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the 1990s===
In the early 1990s, Ghanaian journalist Vincent Azumah found courage to write publicly about the practice and sparked a nationwide debate.  Then the International Federation of Women Laywyers in Ghana (FIDA) organized an investigation into shrine practices and issued a report in 1992.  These events took place while [[Jerry Rawlings]] still held the presidency of Ghana with an iron fist.  Rawlings and his administration were defenders of African Traditional Religion, calling it the "African Heritage" and a cause for national pride.  One example of this was his granting of free air time to the founder of the Afrikania movement, Okomfo Damuah, at a time when Christian churches were virtually denied access to both radio and TV.  Azumah and FIDA's actions were very bold in the light of the political climate of the day.&lt;ref name="Ababio, p. 21"&gt;Ababio, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ghana National Commission on Children brought attention to the issue during the celebration of the Organization of African Unity Day of the African Child on June 16, 1993. In 1994 and 1995 Ghanaian lawyer Anita Heymann Ababio researched the practice in the light of Ghanaian law, and recommendations from this research later became a Law Reform Commission report to the Ghana government in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Heymann, Ababio A., ''The Impact of the Constitutional Provisions on the Customary Disabilities of Women in Ghana'', Report on the Abolition of Ritual Slavery, Forced Labour and Other Related Practices, Institute of Advanced Legal Studies, University of London, April 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Emmanuel Kweku Akeampong, a Ghanaian professor of history at Harvard University, the practice of trokosi was much in the national attention in 1996 and 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Akeampong, p. 221-226.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outlawed in Ghana 1998===
In 1998 the Law Reform Commission, drawing on the recommendations of Ababio and others, drafted a law specifying "ritual or customary servitude" as a crime.  The law passed, requiring a mandatory three-year prison term for those found guilty.&lt;ref name="Ababio, p. 21"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Criminal Code of Ghana, Act. 1998 Act. 554.&lt;/ref&gt;

===International award 1999===
In 1999 Juliana Dogbadzi, a former trokosi, won the Reebok Human Rights Award for her efforts in speaking up on behalf of her fellow trokosi.&lt;ref&gt;James Aidoo, "Ghana, Liberating the Trokosi" p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===NGOs oppose the practice===
Although the practice was outlawed in Ghana in 1998, it continued, due to fear and the reluctance of the government to interfere with traditional practices.  Some NGOs had already worked to liberate shrines, but after the law did not solve the problem, NGOs began to get even more seriously involved in advocating against the practice and in working for agreements to reduce the practice by liberating individual shrines.
Some of the organizations that have joined the effort are UNICEF, International Needs Network Ghana, the Swiss "Sentry Movement", Trokosi Abolition Fellowship, the Anti-Slavery Society, and Every Child Ministries.  Survivors for Change is a group of former trokosi who have banded together to speak up against the practice.  Organizations that have been most active in liberating ritual slaves are FESLIM (Fetish Slaves Liberation Movement), founded by Mark Wisdom, International Needs, and Every Child Ministries.  Christian NGOs and human rights organizations have been fighting it—working to end the practice and to win liberation for the shrine slaves.  They have carried out their activities with strong support from CHRAJ—The Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice—and the Ministry of Women's and Children's Affairs.  A Court of Women was organized in Accra in 2003 to continue the fight against the practice.

==Meaning of "Trokosi" and "Vudusi"==
The word '''''trokosi''''' comes from the [[Ewe language|Ewe]] words "tro", meaning deity or fetish, and "kosi", meaning female slave.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Trokosi Terms, www.trokosi.com&lt;/ref&gt; The "tro" deity is not, according to African traditional religion, the Creator or what might be called the "High" or Ultimate God.  "Tro" refers to what African Traditional Religion calls the "small gods" or "lesser deities"—spirits of nature, etc. which are venerated in traditional religion.  The term '''''trokosi''''' is commonly used in English in Ghana, as a [[loanword]].

===Categories of ''Tro'' adherents===

#Those who join the ''Tro'' of their own volition (extremely rare) and those who were born to women associated with the ''Tro'' and initiated as children (''Trovivo'');
#Those thought to have been born through the intervention of the ''Tro'' (''Dorflevivo'') and thus incur a lifetime obligation of servitude to the tro;
#Those allegedly called by the tro to serve as priest and priestesses of the shrine (''Tronua'');
#Those who were forced to become ''Trokosi'' to repay the ''Tro'' because their family supposedly benefited from it.
#Those ''Trokosi'' who are sent by families, often against the will of the girl involved, out of fear that if they do not do so, further calamities may afflict them through the anger of the shrine deities. This last group consists of those vestal virgins who are sent into servitude at the shrines of the ''Troxovi'' due to crimes allegedly committed by their senior or elder family members, almost always males like fathers, grandfathers, and uncles.  The trokosi is sort of a "living sacrifice," who by her suffering is thought to save the family from trouble.

Opponents of the practice claim that all except those who joined of their own volition are virtually slaves in every normal sense of the word.

NGO's point out that practices in traditional shrines vary, but trokosi are usually denied education, suffer a life of hardship, and are a lonely lot, stigmatized by society.&lt;ref&gt;Rouster, Field Findings, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The period of servitude varies from a few months to life.  In some cases it involves payment of a heavy fine to the shrine, which can require many years of hard labor or even a lifetime of service to pay.  In shrines where the period of servitude is limited, after a ritual and sometimes after months or years in the shrine, the Trokosi returns to her family, but her life is still controlled by the shrine for the rest of her life. Supporters of the practice claim that in the vast majority of cases, there is no particular stigma attached to one's status as a former Trokosi shrine participant. NGOs working to rehabilitate former trokosi say that the social stigma is immense and that it is the most enduring and difficult aspect of the practice.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Lorella Rouster, International Director of Every Child Ministries, June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main variations in the practice==
Ritual slavery shows a high degree of cohesiveness, but there are many significant differences as it is practiced in various shrines and in various areas.  Every Child Ministries, a Christian NGO that has done much research on the topic, lists these as variations that they have observed in their work:&lt;ref name="Interview with Rouster, ECM, 2006"&gt;Interview with Rouster, ECM, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Entry age of the participants===
Most frequently those in ritual servitude are young virgin girls at the time of entry into the shrine.  Of course, the girls grow up, so where their servitude is long or lifetime, the participants are of all ages.

===Length of service===
There are two basic lengths of service—perpetual or lifetime service and limited service.  One traditional priest expressed the view that once a crime had been committed, it had to be atoned for until the end of time.  This is the view of lifetime or perpetual service.  Shrine slaves serving for a lifetime have no hope of ever getting free unless outsiders intervene on their behalf.  In some shrines, in some areas, and for some alleged crimes, the service is limited to a specific number of years.  In other cases, a substantial fee is exacted from the shrine slave or her family.  The girls work to try to earn that fee, but in reality the fee is so high and their means of paying it so low that there is virtually no hope of ever paying off the debt that has been laid on them.
Some shrines have taken so many slaves that they cannot contain them all.  Some slaves become unattractive or unuseful to the priest.  In these cases trokosia may be given what is called "temporary" release.  This is actually a misnomer, since it is a permanent condition.  The temporary part only gives the slave permission to live outside the shrine temporarily.  All the important decisions of her life are still controlled by the shrine, she is still at the beck and call of the priest, and she has to serve at the annual festival of the god every year, for which she is required to bring gifts that may take her all year to accumulate.
One child of a trokosi on "temporary release" said, "whenever my mother goes fishing or does any work, she must divide it into three, with two parts going to the priest."&lt;ref&gt;"Revealed Myths about Trokosi Slavery", p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

===Practice of replacement===
Where perpetual or lifetime servitude is practiced, the shrines often, but not always, practice what they call "replacement."  when a trokosi or vudusi dies or runs away, she has to be replaced by another virgin from the same family or clan.  Some human rights interviewers report that they have interviewed numerous girls who were the third or fourth replacements for their families for a crime that was allegedly committed long ago.&lt;ref name="Interview with Rouster, ECM, 2006"/&gt;

===Practice of rape by the priest and elders of the shrine===
In most shrines it is considered a duty of the shrine slaves to have obligatory sex with the priest and sometimes the elders.  The priest's genital organs have been dedicated to the gods of the shrine, so having sex with him is considered a sacred act - in a sense, copulating with the gods.  This is the origin and meaning of the term "wives of the gods."  Many trokosi and vudusi have described beatings and other severe punishments imposed on them for refusing sex with the priest.  In Ghana, human rights organizations monitoring the practice of "trokosi" claim that shrine slaves often end up with an average of four children while in servitude, many of them by the priest or elders of the shrines.  Proponents of ritual servitude deny that this is a part of the practice.  There seem to be wide differences between practices in different districts, but Rouster claims that the problem of forced sex in many of the shrines is too well documented to be disputed.&lt;ref name="Interview with Rouster, ECM, 2006"/&gt;
Stephen Awudi Gadri, founder of Trokosi Abolition Fellowship, speaks of "ritual violation after menarche" (first menses) as the beginning of a life of coerced sex.&lt;ref&gt;"The Revealed Myths about Trokosi Slavery", p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; He refers to the trokosi as "vestal virgins." &lt;ref&gt;Revealed Myths about Trokosi Slavery, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment of shrine slaves===
Treatment of girls in the shrine varies as to feeding practices, reasons for and severity of punishments, sleeping and living conditions.  Severe and widespread problems have been documented in all these areas by human rights organizations.  Many of the shrine slaves are required to do heavy physical labor like cultivating fields with a hand hoe.  Other common duties are weaving mats, making and selling firewood (with all profits going to the priest or the shrine), fetching wood and water, sweeping the compound and attending the images of the gods.

==Liberation of shrine slaves==
[[NGO]]'s and other [[human rights]] organizations are fighting the practice.  Since the 1990s, these groups have actively sought to liberate girls held in ritual servitude.  Liberation has been done on a shrine-by-shrine basis, with NGO's seeking to reach community-wide agreements that all the slaves of a particular shrine will be liberated and the practice of slavery or ritual servitude will be permanently ended in that place.  When such an agreement is reached, a public ceremony is held for the signing of the documents and often, liberation certificates for the former slaves.  The shrine is compensated for its loss and the former trokosi begin a process of rehabilitation which usually includes learning vocational skills.

The most active groups in liberating shrine slaves through negotiated community agreements have been FESLIM, Fetish Slaves Liberation Movement, International Needs Network, and Every Child Ministries.

The first liberation ceremonies were held at Lomo and Me shrines in Volo in October 1996, at three shrines in Dorfor in December 1996, and at Atigo shrine in Battor in January 1997.[54] International Needs Network liberated 400 trokosi from a group of small shrines in November 2000, and 126 at Adidome in November 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Nirit Ben-Ari, "Liberating Girls from Trokosi" from Africa Recovery, Vol 15, #4, Dec. 2001, p. 26.
&lt;/ref&gt; Every Child Ministries cooperated with International Needs Network to liberate 465 trokosi from three shrines of the Agave area in January 2003 and with Fetish Slaves Liberation Movement to liberate 94 shrine slaves from Aklidokpo shrine near Adidome in January 2004.  They continued the effort, liberating 120 from Sovigbenor shrine in Aflao in December 2005, and 52 "yevesi" or servants of the thunder god from the Kadza Yevesi Shrine at Aflao in March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;"African Jewels",a 2nd Quarter 2010, Every Child Ministries&lt;/ref&gt; Shrines of the Anlo clan in Ghana also hold trokosi, but have resisted liberation and defended the practice, defending their practice of trokosi as being more humane than the practices of other districts. Human rights organizations insist that the practice must be totally eradicated.

In [[law]], '''vesting''' is to give an immediately secured right of present or future deployment.  One has a '''vested right''' to an asset that cannot be taken away by any third party, even though one may not yet possess the asset.  When the right, interest, or title to the present or future possession of a legal estate can be transferred to any other party, it is termed a '''vested interest'''.

The concept can arise in any number of contexts, but the most common are [[inheritance]] law and [[retirement plan]] law. In real estate, '''to vest''' is to create an entitlement to a privilege or a right. For example, one may cross someone else’s property regularly and unrestrictedly for several years, and one’s right to an [[easement]] becomes vested. The original owner still retains the possession, but can no longer prevent the other party from crossing.

==Inheritance==
Some [[bequest]]s do not vest immediately upon death of the [[testator]]. For example, many [[Will (law)|will]]s specify that an [[heir]] who dies within a set period (such as 60 days) is not to inherit, and further specify how the corresponding share is to be distributed. This is generally done to obviate disputes over the precise time of death, and to avoid paying taxes twice in rapid succession should multiple members of a family die in the wake of a disaster. Such a bequest does not vest until the expiration of the specified period, because the actual heir cannot be determined with certainty.

It is also possible to give a person, A, a life interest in a property, with the [[Remainder (law)|remainder]] to go to another person or persons, B. If the beneficiary of the remainder cannot yet be known, then the remainder is said not to have vested, and the remainder is said to be [[Remainder (law)#Contingent remainder|contingent]]. This may happen with [[Fee tail|entail]]ed [[Estate (law)|estate]]s, or when property is left in trust to care for a child or relative without heirs. (See [[trust law]] for details).

==Employment==

===Retirement plans===
Vesting is an issue in conjunction with [[employer]] contributions to an [[employee stock option]] plan, deferred compensation plan, or to a retirement plan such as a [[401(k)]], [[Annuity (financial contracts)|annuity]] or [[pension]] plan.

A '''vested right''' is "an absolute right; when a plan is fully vested, the employee has an absolute right to the entire amount of money in the account".&lt;ref&gt;[http://lectlaw.com/def2/u032.htm Lectric Law Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a "basic right that has been granted, or has accrued, and cannot be taken away"; for example. one has a right to a vested [[pension]].&lt;ref&gt;Ballentine's Law Dictionary, p. 577 (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, the portion ''vested'' cannot be reclaimed by the employer, nor can it be used to satisfy the employer's debts. Any portion not vested may be forfeited under certain conditions, such as termination of employment. The portion invested is often determined [[pro-rata]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

Generally, for retirement plans in the [[United States]], employees are fully vested in their own salary deferral contributions upon inception.  For employer contributions, however, the employer has limited options under the [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act]] (ERISA) to delay the vesting of their contributions to the employee. For example, the employer can say that the employee must work with the company for three years or they lose any employer contributed money, which is known as ''cliff vesting''. Or it can choose to have the 20% of the contributions vest each year over five years, known as ''graduated vesting''.

Choosing a vesting plan allows an employer to selectively reward employees who remain employed for a period of time. In theory, this allows the employer to make greater contributions than would otherwise be prudent, because the money they contribute on behalf of employees goes to the ones they most want to reward.

===Ownership in startup companies===
Small entrepreneurial companies usually offer grants of [[common stock]] or positions in an [[employee stock option]] plan to employees and other key participants such as [[independent contractor|contractors]], [[board of directors|board members]], [[Advisory board|advisors]] and major vendors. To make the reward commensurate with the extent of contribution, encourage loyalty, and avoid spreading ownership widely among former participants, these grants are usually subject to vesting arrangements.

Vesting of options is straightforward. The grantee receives an option to purchase a block of common stock, typically on commencement of employment, which vests over time. The option may be exercised at any time but only with respect to the vested portion. The entire option is lost if not exercised within a short period after the end of the employer relationship. The vesting operates simply by changing the status of the option over time from fully unexercisable to fully exercisable according to the vesting schedule.

Common stock grants are similar in function but the mechanism is different.  An employee, typically a company founder, purchases stock in the company at nominal price shortly after the company is formed. The company retains a [[Repurchase agreement|repurchase]] right to buy the stock back at the same price should the employee leave. The repurchase right diminishes over time so that the company eventually has no right to repurchase the stock (in other words, the stock becomes fully vested).

Beginning in the 1990s, vesting periods in the United States are usually 3–5 years for employees, but shorter for board members and others whose expected tenure at a company is shorter. The vesting schedule is most often a [[pro-rata]] monthly vesting over the period with a six or twelve month cliff. Alternative vesting models are becoming more popular including milestone-based vesting and dynamic equity vesting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://slicingpie.com/bootstrapper-equity-why-time-based-vesting-is-a-waste-of-time/|title=Perfect Equity Splits for Bootstrapped Startups|work=Slicing Pie|access-date=2017-09-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of both stock and options, large initial grants that vest over time are more common than periodic smaller grants because they are easier to account for and administer, they establish the arrangement up-front and are thus more predictable, and (subject to some complexities and limitations) the value of the grants and holding period requirements for tax purposes are set upon the initial grant date, giving a considerable tax advantage to the employee.

=== Profit sharing plans ===

[[Profit-sharing]] plans are usually vested in ten years, although in some cases a plan may serve essentially as a pension by allowing a limited amount of vesting should the employee retire or leave on good terms after an extended period of employment.

== Vested rights doctrine in zoning law ==
The '''vested rights doctrine''' is the rule of [[zoning]] law by which an owner or developer is entitled to proceed in accordance with the prior zoning provision where there has been a substantial change of position, expenditures, or incurrence of obligations made in good faith by an innocent party under a [[building permit]] or in reliance upon the probability of its issuance.

== Vesting arrangements and terminology==

A "vesting period" is a period of time an investor or other person holding a right to something must wait until they are capable of fully exercising their rights and until those rights may not be taken away.

In many cases vesting does not occur all at once. Specific portions of the rights grant vest on different dates over the duration of the period of the vesting.  When part of a right is vested and part remains unvested, it is considered "partly vested".

In cases of partial vesting, a "vesting schedule" is a table or chart showing the portion of a right that is vested over time; typically the schedule provides for equal portions to vest on periodic vesting dates, usually once per day, month, quarter, or year, in stairstep fashion over the course of the vesting period.  Often there is a cliff by which the first few steps in the graph are missing, so that there is no vesting at all for a period (usually six or twelve months in the case of employee equity), after which there is a cliff date upon which a large amount of vesting occurs all at once.

Some arrangements provide for "accelerated vesting", by which all or a major portion of the unvested right vests all at once upon the occurrence of a specified event such as a termination of employment by the company or acquisition of the company by another. Less commonly, the vesting schedule may call for variable grants or subject to conditions such as reaching milestones or employee performance. "Graded vesting" (vesting after each year until the employee is fully vested) may be "uniform" (e.g., 20% of the compensation vested each year for five years) or "non-uniform" (e.g., 20%, 30%, and 50% of the compensation vested each year for the next three years).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/graded-vesting.asp#ixzz20GyLrEjY Graded Vesting]&lt;/ref&gt;

In law, '''wrongful dismissal''', also called '''wrongful termination''' or '''wrongful discharge''', is a situation in which an employee's [[contract of employment]] has been terminated by the employer, where the termination breaches one or more terms of the contract of employment, or a [[statutory|statute]] provision or rule in [[employment law]]. Laws governing wrongful dismissal vary according to the terms of the employment contract, as well as under the laws and public policies of the [[jurisdiction]].

A related concept is [[constructive dismissal]] in which an employee feels no choice but to resign from employment for reasons that result from the employer's violation of the employee's legal rights.

==Forms of wrongful dismissal==
Being terminated for any of the items listed below may constitute wrongful termination:

* '''Discrimination''': The employer cannot terminate employment because the employee is a certain race, nationality, religion, sex, age, or (in some jurisdictions) sexual orientation.
* '''Retaliation''': An employer cannot fire an employee because the employee filed a claim of discrimination or is participating in an investigation for discrimination. In the US, this "retaliation" is forbidden under civil rights law.
* '''Employee's refusal to commit an illegal act''': An employer is not permitted to fire an employee because the employee refuses to commit an act that is illegal.
* '''Employer is not following the company's own termination procedures''': In some cases, an employee handbook or company policy outlines a procedure that must be followed before an employee is terminated. If the employer fires an employee without following this procedure, depending upon the laws of the jurisdiction in which the termination occurs, the employee may have a claim for wrongful termination.

The absence of a formal contract of employment does not preclude wrongful dismissal in jurisdictions in which a ''de facto'' contract is taken to exist by virtue of the employment relationship. Terms of such a contract may include obligations and rights outlined in an [[employee handbook]].

Many jurisdictions provide tribunals or courts which that hear actions for wrongful dismissal. A proven wrongful dismissal will tend to lead to the award of one or both of the following remedies:
*reinstatement of the dismissed employee;
*monetary compensation for the wrongfully dismissed.

==Probationary employees==
One way to avoid potential liability for wrongful dismissal with newer employees is to institute an [[probation (workplace)|employment probation]] period after which a new employee is automatically terminated unless there is sufficient justification not to do so. The dismissed employee may still assert a claim, but proof will be more difficult, as the employer may have broad discretion with retaining such a temporary employee.

==United States==
In the United States, there is no single “wrongful termination” law. Rather there are several state and federal laws and court decisions that define this concept.

In all U.S. states except Montana,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://dli.mt.gov/resources/faq|website=Montana Department of Labor &amp; Industry|publisher=State of Montana|accessdate=20 December 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222051735/http://dli.mt.gov/resources/faq|archivedate=22 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; workers are considered by default to be [[At-will employment|at-will employees]], meaning that they may be fired at any time without cause.

Some employees have contracts of employment that limit their employers' ability to terminate them without cause. Other employees may be members of unions and benefit from a [[Collective agreement|collective bargaining agreement]] that defines disciplinary proceedings and limits when an employee may be terminated. Employees who work for government agencies normally benefit from civil service protections that restrict termination. Those employees, if terminated, may attempt to bring wrongful termination claims under the terms of the contract or agreement, or civil service law.

===Termination of at-will employment===
Although at-will employees are protected from termination by civil rights laws and other laws that prohibit retaliatory termination, in the absence of a contract of employment or collective bargaining agreement, or civil service protections extended to government workers, they have few protections from being fired.&lt;ref name="lars"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Wrongful Termination of At Will Employment|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/employment/at_will.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=20 December 2017|date=5 August 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222050932/https://www.expertlaw.com/library/employment/at_will.html|archivedate=22 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some situations an at-will employee may be able to claim wrongful termination. Three leading grounds for claiming wrongful termination are:
#'''Implied contract''': In some situations a court might find an implied contract of employment that restricts the employer's ability to terminate an employee without cause. For example, the terms of an employee manual may support an employee's claim that the employer must follow a defined disciplinary process prior to termination.
#'''Public policy''': In many states it is possible to argue that the employer's reasons for terminating an employee, although not in violation of a statute, violated the state's public policy such that a wrongful termination claim should be allowed. For example, a court might allow a claim by an employee who was fired for refusing to take an action that was in violation of the law, for reporting a violation of the law to an enforcement agency, or for otherwise exercising the employee's rights under the law.
#'''Covenant of good faith and fair dealing''': In what is in many senses an extension of public policy doctrine, some states allow an at-will employee to pursue a wrongful termination claim if the cause for the termination is deemed to reflect bad faith on the part of the employer. For example, a state might apply this doctrine to allow a claim against an employer that terminated an employee a week before that employee's pension benefits vested, for no reason other than to avoid paying the employee a pension.

A 2016 study found evidence that the implied-contract exception to at-will employment reduced state employment rates by 0.8% to 1.7%. The initial impact is largest for female and less-educated workers (those who change jobs frequently), while the longer-term effect is greater for older and more-educated workers (those most likely to litigate). By contrast, we find no robust employment or wage effects of two other widely recognized wrongful-discharge laws: the public-policy and goodfaith exceptions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Autor|first=David H|last2=Donohue|first2=John J|last3=Schwab|first3=Stewart J|date=2006-05-01|title=The Costs of Wrongful-Discharge Laws|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1162/rest.88.2.211|journal=Review of Economics and Statistics|volume=88|issue=2|pages=211–231|doi=10.1162/rest.88.2.211|issn=0034-6535}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Termination in violation of the law===
In the United States, termination of employment is not legal if it is based on your membership in a group protected from discrimination by law.&lt;ref name="lars"/&gt; It is unlawful for an employer to terminate an employee based upon factors including employee's race, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, disability, medical condition, pregnancy, or age (over 40), pursuant to U.S. federal laws such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964|url=https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/titlevii.cfm|website=Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|publisher=U.S. Government|accessdate=20 December 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171219201431/https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/titlevii.cfm|archivedate=19 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA)|url=https://www.ada.gov/pubs/adastatute08.htm|website=Americans with Disabilities website|publisher=U.S. Government|accessdate=28 June 2018|deadurl=no|}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967|url=https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/adea.cfm|website=Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|publisher=U.S. Government|accessdate=28 June 2018|deadurl=no|}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Many states also have civil rights laws that protect workers from discrimination. For example, those forms of discrimination are prohibited by the [[California Fair Employment and Housing Act|California’s Fair Employment and Housing Act]] (FEHA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unlawful Discrimination|url=http://ag.ca.gov/civilrights/pdf/01cr_handbook.pdf|website=California Attorney General's Office|accessdate=20 December 2017|date=August 2001|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231104941/http://ag.ca.gov/civilrights/pdf/01cr_handbook.pdf|archivedate=31 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many laws also prohibit termination, even of at-will employees. For example, [[whistleblower]] laws may protect an employee who reports a legal or safety violation by the employer to an appropriate oversight agency. Most states prohibit employers from firing employees in retaliation for filing a workers' compensation claim, or making a wage complaint over unpaid wages.

==Canada==
In Canadian law, absent a written contract which addresses how to end the employment relationship, the law implies into the employment relationship a term that it will not be ended without "notice" of its termination.

Notice is advanced warning an employer must provide an employee that their employment will be terminated. It is measured in units of time. The employer has the option to provide one of two kinds of notice:
# working notice, or
# pay in lieu of notice

If an adjudicator determines a dismissal was unjust, the employer may be ordered to reinstate the employee with or without compensation for lost wages, pay compensation for lost wages without reinstating the employee, or do anything that is equitable to remedy any consequences of the dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/labour-standards/reports/unjust-dismissal.html#h2.6|title=Unjust Dismissal|last=|first=|date=|website=Government of Canada|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Working notice ===

Working notice is legal in Canada. Therefore, if the employee is provided a reasonable amount of working notice, the employer owes the employee no additional money.

=== Pay in lieu of notice ===

Pay in lieu of notice, sometimes referred to as termination pay, is the amount of money the employer must pay the employee if the employer seeks to immediately terminate the employee without working notice.

=== Notice is measured in two different ways: statutory notice and common law "reasonable notice". ===

Employees may be entitled to either statutory or reasonable notice, which ever is greater, but at the very minimum, must receive statutory notice. Provincial legislation such as Ontario's Employment Standards Act, delineates statutory notice by way of a formula.

Reasonable notice, on the other hand, has no formula. The [[common law]] dictates how much reasonable notice an employee is entitled to.[http://www.slaw.ca/2015/11/29/the-new-bardal-factors-may-just-be-the-old-bardal-factors/] In this regard, the length of reasonable notice depends on a number of factors, best described by [[James Chalmers McRuer|McRuer CJHC]] in the 1960 Ontario decision of ''Bardal v Globe &amp; Mail'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Bardal v Globe &amp; Mail|vol= 24|reporter= DLR (2d)|opinion= 140|pinpoint= 145|court= Ont. H.C.|date= 1960|url= |accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There could be no catalogue laid down as to what was reasonable notice in particular classes of cases. The reasonableness of the notice must be decided with reference to each particular case, having regard to the character of the employment, the length of the service of the servant, the age of the servant and the availability of similar employment, having regard to the experience, training and qualifications of the servant.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As the so-called "Bardal Factors" feature in hundreds of cases, predictive modeling is now possible.[http://www.bardalfactors.ca/new-blog/2017/11/16/predictive-analytics-what-are-they] Notwithstanding the above, the courts are open to creative interpretations of reasonable notice. For example, if an employee was persuaded to leave a job to come to another (i.e. inducement), the courts may take that into account in calculating the employee’s length of service and thus drastically increase the notice period.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] has significantly expanded the scope of wrongful dismissal in Canadian jurisprudence:

An employer is entitled to dismiss an employee according to the terms of the employment contract. There are oral employment contracts, and written employment contracts, and combinations of oral and written employment contracts. In Canadian common law, there is a basic distinction as to dismissals. There are two basic types of dismissals, or terminations: dismissal with cause and termination without cause. An example of cause would be an employee's behaviour which constitutes a fundamental breach of the terms of the employment contract. Where cause exists, the employer can dismiss the employee without providing any notice. If no cause exists yet the employer dismisses without providing lawful notice, then the dismissal is a wrongful dismissal. A wrongful dismissal will allow the employee to claim monetary damages in an amount that compensates the employee for the wages, commissions, bonuses, profit sharing and other such emoluments the employee would have earned or received during the lawful notice period, minus earnings from new employment obtained during the lawful notice period. In Canadian employment law, in those jurisdictions where a remedy for [[unjust dismissal]] is not available, it has long been the rule that reinstatement is not a remedy available to either the employer or the employee{{em dash}}damages must be paid instead.

Although Canadian employment law provides some of the above remedies, each (provincial) jurisdiction may treat employment law differently. It is important to determine which jurisdiction the employment occurs in or is regulated by, then seek appropriate legal advice relevant to that jurisdiction and its particular employment laws.

At [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]'s investor day presentation in September 2016, CEO [[Mark Fields (businessman)|Mark Fields]] described difficulties with Ford's prior strategy in India, but commented "Our new mobility business could be a factor that plays in there.

== Competition ==
Zoomcar faces competition from [[Drivezy (formerly JustRide)|Drivezy]], [[MylesCar]]s (backed by [[Carzonrent]]) and other similar car rental companies.

== Partnerships ==
Zoom partners with the auto manufacturers like [[Ford]] &amp; [[Mahindra &amp; Mahindra|Mahindra]] which allowed them to become the first car rental company in India to offer an electric vehicle (the Mahindra REVA E2O by Mahindra) and the Ford EcoSport "urban SUV by Ford" in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.at.ford.com/news/cn/Pages/Zoom%20Chooses%20Ford%20to%20Pioneer%20Innovative%20Car%20Rental%20Service%20in%20India.aspx|title=Zoom Chooses Ford to Pioneer Innovative Car Rental Service in India|date=24 April 2013|publisher=@Fordonline|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Zoom also works with locally established real estate developers, universities, hotels, and corporate IT parks to secure parking for its vehicles and offer pick-up points to its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bangalore.tie.org/article/8/featured-member-greg-moran|title=Featured Member : Greg Moran|publisher=TIE Bangalore Chapter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, Zoom, [[Uber (company)|Uber]] (a cab booking mobile app provider) and the Ashoka Foundation came together and launched a month-long campaign in Bangalore called RideSmartBLR to encourage car-rental and discourage drunk driving for its health, economical and environmental benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/enterprise-it/services-apps/ZoomCar-Uber-launch-smart-riding-campaign-in-Bangalore/articleshow/26125804.cms|title=ZoomCar, Uber launch smart riding campaign in Bangalore|author=Shilpa Phadnis|date=21 November 2013|publisher=The Times Of India|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Opposition ==
In July 2015, Zoomcar issued caution information to its customers following opposition from the [[Ladakh]] taxi union. Following an incident in which a convoy of 15 cars rented from the company was reportedly attacked by members of the union with stones and iron rods, Zoomcar issued a cautionary mail to customers traveling to Khardung La and Nubra valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Updated: Zoomcar &amp; Myles advise caution after Ladakh taxi union revolts against self-drive rental cars|url = http://www.medianama.com/2015/07/223-zoomcar-ladakh-taxi-union/|website = MediaNama|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following week Zoom issued an update stating that the situation had aggravated and the company urged extreme caution to customers traveling to the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = "The situation has aggravated"; Zoomcar advises extreme caution as taxi unions damage cars in Ladakh|url = http://www.medianama.com/2015/07/223-zoomcar-ladakh-taxi-union-cars/|website = MediaNama|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The taxi unions of [[Gulmarg]] and Ladakh continue to resist entry of non-local commercial cars in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Self drive rental service cos offer a string of benefits|url = http://www.businesstoday.in/magazine/features/self-drive-rental-service-companies-like-revv-zoomcar-myles-offers-a-string-of-benefits/story/226510.html|website = www.businesstoday.in|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
In December 2015, the [[Advertising Standards Council of India]] [[Advertising Standards Council of India|(ASCI)]] banned 54 controversial Indian ads which included a video advertisement by Zoomcar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ASCI bans 54 ads, including HUL, Godrej, Marico, Airtel 4G, Flipkart, Bennett Coleman &amp; Co, HT Media, Shoppers Stop, HDFC Bank, Max Bupa, in September -  Moneylife|url = http://www.moneylife.in/article/asci-bans-54-ads-including-hul-godrej-marico-airtel-4g-flipkart-bennett-coleman-co-ht-media-shoppers-stop-hdfc-bank-max-bupa-in-september/44495.html|website = www.moneylife.in|accessdate = 2015-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ad was found to be in violation of India's [[Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961]] by the council, following which the advertisement was pulled off by the company.
