The '''1966 flood of the Arno''' ({{lang-it|Alluvione di Firenze del 4 novembre 1966}}) in [[Florence]] killed 101 people and damaged or destroyed millions of masterpieces of art and rare books. It is considered the worst [[flood]] in the city's history since 1557. With the combined effort of Italian and foreign volunteers alike, or ''angeli del fango'' ("Mud Angels"), many of these fine works have been restored. New methods in [[Art conservation|conservation]] were devised and [[Art conservation and restoration|restoration]] laboratories established. However, even decades later, much work remains to be done.

== Overview ==
Located in the [[Tuscany]] region of [[Central Italy]], the [[Arno]] river is approximately {{convert|240|km|mi}} long.  It flows from the Mount Falterona hills of the [[Apennine Mountains]] to the [[Ligurian Sea]], just {{convert|11|km|mi|0}} west of [[Pisa]].  Lush vineyards and olive groves line the river's scenic course to the west, out to sea. Principally utilized for [[irrigation]] purposes, only {{convert|32|km|mi}} of the river is used for navigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Arno River | encyclopedia=Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia | year=2007 | url=http://gme.grolier.com/cgi-bin/article?assetid=0017000-0 | accessdate =23 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Arno River | encyclopedia=The World Book Encyclopedia | volume=1 | publisher=World Book, Inc. | year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The highest flows of the river generally occur in spring and autumn of every year, when rainfall in the Apennines is at its greatest. The intensity of the 1966 flood was further increased by both the [[orography]] of the Apennines, which contributed to the high run-off rates and river discharges, and urban development. Roads, such as the Via de Calzaiuoli, served as narrow channels for floodwaters, allowing for their greater speed and destruction within the city; bridges, on the other hand, hindered river flow where it was needed, allowing water to pour over the [[floodplain]] with great force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Florence Floods: 4 November 1966 | journal=The Geographical Journal | date=June 1967 | volume=133 | issue=2 | pages=277–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Timeline of events ==
[[File:1966 Arno Florence flood 2008.JPG|thumb|Square in Florence with a white [[high water mark]] of the 1966 flood. At this point the marker is about {{convert|4|m|ft}} high.]]

===3 November===

* After a long period of steady rain, the Levane and La Penna dams in Valdarno began to discharge more than {{convert|2000|m3|cuft}} of water per second toward Florence.
* At 14:30, the Civil Engineering Department reported "'an exceptional quantity of water.'"
* Cellars in the [[Florence#Subdivisions|Santa Croce]] and San Frediano areas began to flood.
* Police received calls for assistance from villagers up the Arno Valley.
* The flood's first victim, a 52-year-old worker, died at the Anconella [[Water purification|water treatment plant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===4 November 1966===

* At 04:00, engineers, fearing that the Valdarno dam would burst, discharged a mass of water that eventually reached the outskirts of Florence at a rate of {{convert|60|km/h}}.
* At 07:26, the Lungarno delle Grazie cut off gas, electricity and water supplies to affected areas.
* By 08:00, army barracks were flooded.
* By 09:00, hospital emergency generators (the only source of electrical power remaining) failed.
* Landslides obstructed roads leading to Florence, while narrow streets within city limits funneled floodwaters, increasing their height and velocity.
* By 09:45, the [[Piazza del Duomo, Florence|Piazza del Duomo]] was flooded.
* The powerful waters ruptured central heating oil tanks, and the oil mixed with the water and mud, causing greater damage.
* Florence was divided in two, and officials were unable to immediately reach citizens of the city past the Piazza Michelangelo.
* At its highest, the water reached over {{convert|6.7|m|ft}} in the Santa Croce area.
* By 20:00, the water began to lower.&lt;ref name="Clarkson, Christopher 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Clarkson, Christopher | title = The Florence Flood of November 1966 &amp; Its Aftermath | year = 2003 | url = http://www.ndl.go.jp/en/publication/ndl_newsletter/135/lecture1_135_353.pdf | format = PDF

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==
The flood has had a lasting impact on Florence, economically and culturally. City officials and citizens were unprepared for the storm and the widespread devastation that it caused. There were virtually no emergency measures in place, at least partially because Florence is located in an area where the frequency of flooding is relatively low. In fact, approximately 90% of the city's population were completely unaware of the imminent disaster.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Residents were set to celebrate their country's World War I victory over [[Austria]] on 4 November, [[Armed Forces Day#Italy|Armed Forces Day]]. In commemoration, businesses were closed and many of their employees were out of town for the public holiday. While many lives were likely spared as a result, the locked buildings greatly inhibited the salvaging of valuable materials from numerous institutions and shops, with the exception of a number of jewellery stores whose owners were warned by their nightwatchmen.

5,000 families were left homeless by the storm, and 6,000 stores were forced out of business.  Approximately 600,000 tons of mud, rubble and sewage severely damaged or destroyed numerous collections of books, manuscripts and fine art. In fact, it is estimated that between 3 and 4 million books and manuscripts were damaged, as well as 14,000 movable works of art.&lt;ref name="Clarkson, Christopher 2003" /&gt;

Artist [[Marco Sassone]], in a 1969 interview, recalled the impact of the flood on Florence's residents: "The only thing you could do was watch and be helpless. Nature was master...the women became crazy with fear. They began throwing things from the windows and screaming 'who is going to save my children?'" It was reported that 101 people lost their lives in the flood waters.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, Phyllis. County Artist Relives Florence Disaster. The Register, Sunday 2 November 1969, p 10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collections affected===
* Archives of the Opera del [[Florence Cathedral|Duomo]] (Archivio di Opera del Duomo): 6,000 volumes of documents and 55 illuminated manuscripts were damaged.
* [[Gabinetto Vieusseux|Gabinetto Vieusseux Library]] (Biblioteca del Gabinetto Vieusseux): All 250,000 volumes were damaged, including titles of romantic literature and Risorgimento history; submerged in water, they became swollen and distorted. Pages, separated from their text blocks, were found pressed upon the walls and ceiling of the building.
* [[National Central Library (Florence)|National Central Library]] (Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale Firenze): Located alongside the Arno, the National Library was cut off from the rest of the city by the flood. 1,300,000 items (a third of their holdings) were damaged, including prints, maps, posters, newspapers and a majority of works in the Palatine and Magliabechi collections.
* The State Archives ([[Archivio di Stato di Firenze|Archivio di Stato]]): Roughly 40% of the collection was damaged, including property and financial records; birth, marriage and death records; judicial and administrative documents; and police records, among others.

== Funding and assistance ==
{{more citations needed|section|date=November 2017}}&lt;!--most of section has no citations--&gt;
Realizing the immense wealth and importance of Florentine culture in a global context, many individuals and organizations contributed to the conservation mission, providing both funding and manpower. Art historian and professor Carlo Ludovico Ragghianti assembled a committee with [[List of mayors of Florence|Mayor Piero Bargellini]] as chairman to raise awareness of the needs of Florence's art and academic institutions. Members included prominent figures from around the world, representatives of their own respective institutions.

A number of other international committees were formed with the intention of sponsoring various institutions in Florence:
* The Franco-Italian Committee aided the Church of Santa Maria Maddalena di Pazzi in Borgo Pinti.
* The U.S. Committee to Rescue Italian Art, composed of 25 sub-committees and chaired by [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]], assisted in restoring frescoes around the city.
* The Viennese armory was responsible for restoring the arms and armor of the [[Bargello]] Museum.
* A Dutch committee sponsored the Buonarroti House Museum.
* A group of Germans repaired the musical instruments of the Bardini Museum.
The work of and contributions made by these committees were supervised by a central committee in Rome.

Additional funding came from various governments, [[UNESCO]], and the International Committee for the Assistance of Museums, Works of Art, Libraries and Archives, among others.  The city of [[Edinburgh]] (Scotland), twinned with Florence, sent practical help for the citizens in the form of double-decker buses to temporarily replace those which had been lost in the floods.  When these eventually returned home, they operated with the international 'GB' registration plate still affixed to the rear; each also carried a small plaque presented by the Florentine transport authorities indicating their gratitude for the gesture made by the people of Edinburgh.

Charity auctions were also organised. In a show of support for the Florentine art community, [[Pablo Picasso]] had one of his paintings, ''Recumbent Woman Reading'', auctioned off on an internationally televised programme. He donated the $105,000 it earned to restoration efforts in Italy. Similarly, [[Pietro Annigoni]] and [[Luciano Guarnieri]] donated the money they earned from selling 575 colour [[lithographs]] (depicting the events surrounding the flood and its aftermath), produced from 13 of their drawings.

Florentine native [[Franco Zeffirelli]] produced the short documentary ''[[Florence: Days of Destruction]]'' to raise awareness of the flood. Released a month after the disaster, it reputedly raised more than $20 million for reconstruction efforts.&lt;ref name='NGA'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/podcasts/lectures/2011.shtm |title=National Gallery of Art - Videos and Podcasts, December 2011 |publisher=National Gallery of Art |accessdate=29 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201205345/http://www.nga.gov/podcasts/lectures/2011.shtm |archivedate=1 December 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was narrated in English and Italian by actor [[Richard Burton]].&lt;ref name='DukeLib'&gt;{{cite web| url=https://blogs.library.duke.edu/preservation/2012/02/15/florence-days-of-destruction-a-film-by-franco-zeffirelli/|title=Preservation Underground - Florence: Days of Destruction (A Film by Franco Zeffirelli)|publisher=Duke University Library|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many institutions from around the world financially compensated employees who travelled to Italy and aided in the restoration of Florence, many others volunteered their services for absolutely no pay. Collectively, these people have been fondly referred to as "Mud Angels", due to their commitment to working in such deplorable conditions.&lt;ref name="Batini 1967"&gt;{{cite book | last=Batini | first=Giorgio | title=4 November 1966: The River Arno in the Museums of Florence:Galleries, Monuments, Churches, Libraries, Archives and Masterpieces Damaged by the Flood | year=1967 | publisher=Bonechi | location=Florence}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Thorough flood... | journal=The Burlington Magazine | date=November 1986 | volume=128 | issue=1004 | page=779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The "Mud Angels"===
[[List of mayors of Florence|Mario Primicerio]], the mayor of Florence from 1995 to 1999, helped celebrate the Mud Angels' (''angeli del fango'') efforts during an anniversary celebration in 1996. Thirty years earlier, he was a professor who lent his assistance in preserving the priceless artefacts of Florence. The Angels cleaned the city of refuse, mud and oil, and retrieved works of art, books and other materials from flooded rooms; experts from around the world volunteered their time and knowledge in the conservation of the aforementioned materials.

In a 1996 interview, Primicerio offered three principal reasons as to why the Mud Angels felt compelled to help: a concern for future generations, a feeling of international unity and a pervasive sense of solidarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|first=Mario |last=Primicerio |url=http://www.mega.it/allu/eng/intventt.htm |title=We are really delighted to invite the Mud Angels to Florence: Interview with Mario Primicerio, the Mayor of Florence |year=1996 |accessdate=21 February 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217085124/http://www.mega.it/allu/eng/intventt.htm |archivedate=17 February 2007 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|What we were doing was dictated by the desire to give back the traces of the history of the past to future generations, so that it could be used for the spiritual growth of people who perhaps had yet to be born...it was the international community that worked to try to save Florence, this unique patrimony which belonged to the whole world.|Mario Primicerio|Speciale Alluvione}}

===The "Flood Ladies"===
The [[Flood Ladies]] were a group of international female artists who contributed artworks to the city of Florence following the catastrophic 1966 flood of the Arno as a sign of solidarity and to help repair the psychological damage done by the flood. The group was formed in [[Florence]], [[Italy]] in 1966. Contributors to the collection lived all over the world. In 2014 the organization Advancing Women Artist Foundation headed an effort to preserve, exhibit and acknowledge the contribution of these women.

== Conservation measures ==
Many experts in the field of conservation, such as [[Peter Waters]], utilised their knowledge in restoring the works of art and literature ravaged by the flood. Staff from the Central Institute of Restoration and Institute of Book Pathology, for example, volunteered their time, efforts, and expertise in this enormous undertaking. New concepts, such as "phased conservation," and methods in conservation, such as mass deacidification, were conceived during this period after the flood ravaged the city of Florence.&lt;ref name="channel4.com"&gt;{{cite web | title = Cities and Disaster: The Florence Flood of 1966 | url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/c-d/cities06.html| accessdate =5 April 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070517215628/http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/c-d/cities06.html| archivedate= 17 May 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Books and records===
Priorities were established during the process of conserving damaged books and records, the most critical of which became the retrieval of materials from flooded rooms. After they were rescued, books and records were typically washed and disinfected. In certain cases, [[Bookbinding|bindings]] were cut and sheets treated individually.  Following a thorough cleansing, the materials were then dried in Florentine libraries, space permitting, or at locations outside of the city, such as [[kiln|tobacco kilns]] and [[granaries]]. In some circumstances, large quantities of books were covered with sawdust, as a means of drawing out moisture. When not washed prior to drying, dried mud was then scraped off the exterior of the books.

One or both of two drying techniques was applied: interleaving by hand and/or drying with the aid of domestic heaters or other mechanical equipment. Interleaving involved the placement of blotting papers within the text-block of a book and replacing them once they were fully soaked; a variety of papers were used, including mimeograph paper and green blotting paper (the latter of which ultimately caused more damage). In kilns, the [[humidity]] level was slowly lowered from ninety to forty percent. If deemed necessary, bindings were removed and dried separately.  Removed pages were hung out to dry on an apparatus similar to a [[clothes line]].

Fearing the spread of [[mold]], workers completed these tasks with the greatest speed possible. After they were disinfected and dried, the items were then reassembled, restored and, if necessary, rebound. [[Library catalog|Card catalogs]] and in some cases, the actual books and documents were reproduced by reprinting on early [[Printing press|presses]], [[photocopying]], or copying by hand.&lt;ref name="Clarkson, Christopher 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Batini 1967" /&gt;
&lt;ref name="The Florentine Flood Disaster"&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Florentine Flood Disaster | journal=The Burlington Magazine | date=April 1967 | volume=109 | issue=769 | pages=192–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Libraries and Archives of Florence | journal=Times Literary Supplement | date=1 December 1966| first=Nicolai | last=Rubinstein | page=1133 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | url = http://data.scl.utah.edu/fmi/xsl/stream/details.xsl?-recid=354&amp;a::v=1O9iEOa749 | title = The Restoration of Books: Florence 1968 | medium = DVD | publisher = Royal College of Art | location = London | date = 1968 | accessdate= 27 February 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

====The National Library Centers of Florence: a case study====
Initially the transportation of large numbers of books to other institutes (to repair and rebind) was considered, but decided against on logistical grounds. Within six months of the flood, the National Library of Florence had 144 workers on hand: three binders, eight binder trainees, two librarians, forty-two workmen, eighty-one student volunteers and eight other library staff members.

Together they devised a logical and efficient method of book repair, involving nine separate and clearly defined steps:

* Books were selected for treatment. The details of work to be done were recorded on a formatted card that accompanied its respective book throughout its treatment. Once work was completed, the card was permanently filed. A universal language utilising symbols, created with [[foreign worker]]s in mind, was employed in the formatting of this card.  Symbols were assigned to key phrases that communicated the condition of each book and how its repair was to be conducted, such as:
** historically important-only to be dealt with by experts
** incomplete
** medium mud
** rebind
** collation part missing
* The book was photographed.
* The book's collation was verified and its covers removed and stored in a marked case (if they were to be used in a new binding).
* If necessary, the book was carefully taken apart to wash it in warm water and disinfect it with Topane.
* In certain cases, the leaves of the book were [[mass deacidification|deacidified]] and buffered.
* The text-block was pressed.
* The text-block was dried in specially designed cabinets.
* Sections of the book were then reconstructed and the text-blocks collated.
* Finally, each book was wrapped in a paper sheet that had been impregnated with an antimicrobial substance, then they were set aside for any later repair or rebinding. The binding was completed in the main reading room of the library, which had been converted (temporarily) for this purpose.

This methodical nine-part system enabled workers to process between seventy and a hundred books a day.&lt;ref name="Clarkson, Christopher 2003" /&gt;

After the Florence flood, the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale was not allowed to put books back into the lower levels.&lt;ref&gt;Lenzuni, Anna. “Coping with Disaster.” Preservation of library materials: conference held at the National Library of Austria, Vienna, 7–10 April 1986. Ed. Merrily A. Smith. IFLA publications, 40–41. München: Saur, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paintings===
Many panel paintings were critically damaged as a result of water saturating their wood, causing the glue and [[gesso]], which compose the priming layer, to dissolve. Consequently, the paintings' colours dissolved as well. In addition, the moisture caused paintings to buckle and crack or develop blisters, and the paint to chip and fall.  Actions were taken to stabilize the problem by applying [[rice paper]] to the affected paintings and storing them in cool, stable environments where humidity was slowly decreased. In extreme cases, the paint layer was extracted from the wood and gesso and then reapplied to a new support. [[Nystatin]], an antifungal, was sprayed on the wood to prevent mold from growing. Treatment facilities were established at locations such as the Boboli Garden Lemon-House, where over two hundred of these panel paintings were restored.

Similar measures were necessary to conserve canvas paintings. First, an original canvas was relined and gauze applied to the painted surface, which was then ironed. This process is referred to as the ''rintelatura'', or "new canvas" method. Relatively minor surface work was often completed with a variety of solvents and/or types of [[resin]].

===Frescoes===
[[Fresco]]es demanded more complicated treatment. Normally water, once it evaporates, will leave a layer of residual salt on the surface of the wall that absorbed it. In some instances, the resultant [[efflorescence]] obscured painted images. In other cases, the impermeability of the fresco plaster caused the salt to become trapped beneath the surface, causing bubbles to form and erupt, and the paint to fall. The adhesion of the plaster to the wall was often also seriously compromised. A fresco could only be detached when fully dry. To dry a fresco, workers cut narrow tunnels beneath it, in which heaters were placed to draw out moisture from below (instead of outwards, which would have further damaged the paintings). Within a few days, the fresco was ready to be detached.

Fuel oil, which coated many painted works of art, was removed by using Japanese tissue paper to apply a solvent, which dissolved the tar. An [[absorption (chemistry)|absorbent]], such as [[talcum powder]], was then distributed on the tissue paper.

===Sculpture and other objects===
It became imperative to clean sculpture immediately, before it fully absorbed the oil. Flaking sculpture was sprayed with a [[silicate]] mixture, while wooden pieces were treated with [[insecticides]] and toxic gases to kill insects and prevent future infestation. [[Weapon]]ry, like firearms and swords, were taken apart, cleaned with [[Kerosene|paraffin]], and finally lubricated to prevent future rusting.

[[Bronze]] objects were kept in dehumidification chambers for a few weeks and cleaned with distilled water or polished. For more severely damaged pieces, experts completed "depth cleaning," which entailed the use of small drills and vacuuming. Similar measures were taken with gold.  Broken objects were reassembled using photographs and other retrieved documentation.&lt;ref name="Batini 1967" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Florentine Flood Disaster" /&gt;

===Effect on preservation and conservation awareness===
The disastrous results of the flood established an international awareness of the need for preservation and conservation education and facilities.  In the United States, for example, it is no coincidence that the [[National Historic Preservation Act]] was passed in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Stipe | first=Robert and Antoinette J. Lee | url=http://www.emich.edu/public/geo/history.html#preservationact | title=The American Mosiac: Preserving A Nation's Heritage | year=1987 | publisher= U.S. Committee, International Council on Monuments and Sites | location=Washington, D.C.| accessdate= 4 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the next twenty years:
{{Quotation|2,000 to 3,000 preservation organizations actively engaged in public education, advocacy, preservation and restoration projects of various kinds, many of them operating revolving funds. In terms of geographic interest, distinctions among the regions are no longer drawn. Membership in the National Trust for Historic Preservation grew from 10,700 in 1966 to 185,000 in 1986. More than 35 university graduate professional and technical courses directly related to historic preservation were created in the interim. It would be reasonable to estimate that more than 54,000 jobs were created in the administrative aspect of preservation alone.|Robert E. Stipe and Antoinette J. Lee}}

===Work outstanding===
A significant amount of restorative work remains to be done in Florence.  Due to a lack of awareness, funding, and manpower, a great number of works of art and books lie in storage, dirty and damaged.  Christopher Clarkson, noted conservator, called attention to this problem in a 2007 letter, stating that the National Library still has a "warehouse" full of books to be repaired and bound; many others need cleaning or reassembling.  According to a 1993 report, approximately 25% of the 80,000 items belonging to the Magliabecchi and Palatino collections had not been fully restored in the nearly thirty years since the flood.  The number of conservators that work at the library presently is only about a tenth of the amount that worked there immediately after the flood.&lt;ref name="channel4.com"/&gt;

==Environmental measures==

Regional officials in Tuscany are responsible for organizing a massive project, the purpose of which is to not only protect the area from future flooding but to maintain high water quality and effectively utilize water resources.

Work commenced in 1984, with the construction of the Bilancino Dam, near Florence.  The Sieve tributary and spillway at [[Pontedera]] are among other developments.  The national government has funded a majority of these various subprojects, with the city of Florence being the primary recipient of the money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Bilancino Dam, A Reservoir for Florence | url=http://www.comune.firenze.it/servizi_pubblici/ambiente/acqua/ciclo/Inglese/1BILenglish.htm | accessdate =1 March 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20041221224245/http://www.comune.firenze.it/servizi_pubblici/ambiente/acqua/ciclo/Inglese/1BILenglish.htm |archivedate = 21 December 2004|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''AM stereo''' is a term given to a series of mutually incompatible techniques for [[radio broadcasting]] [[stereophonic|stereo]] [[Audio frequency|audio]] in the [[mediumwave|AM]] band in a manner that is compatible with standard [[amplitude modulation|AM]] [[receiver (radio)|receiver]]s. There are two main classes of systems: [[independent sideband]] (ISB) systems, promoted principally by [[United States|American]] [[broadcast engineer]] [[Leonard R. Kahn]]; and [[quadrature amplitude modulation]] (QAM) [[multiplexing]] systems (conceptually closer to [[FM stereo]]).

Initially adopted by many commercial AM broadcasters in the mid to late 1980s, AM stereo broadcasting soon began to decline due to a lack of receivers (most "AM/FM stereo" radios only receive in stereo on FM), a growing exodus of music broadcasters to FM, concentration of ownership of the few remaining stations in the hands of large corporations and the removal of music from AM stations in favour of news/talk or sports broadcasting. By 2001, most of the former AM stereo broadcasters were no longer stereo or had left the AM band entirely.

==History==
Early experiments with stereo AM radio involved two separate stations (both AM or sometimes one AM and one FM) broadcasting the left and right audio channels. This system was not very practical, as it required the listener to use two separate receivers. Synchronization was problematic, often resulting in "ping-pong" effects between the two channels. Reception was also likely to be different between the two stations, and many listeners used mismatching models of receivers.

After the early experiments with two stations, a number of systems were invented to broadcast a stereo signal in a way which was compatible with standard AM receivers.

[[FM stereo]] was first implemented in 1961. In the [[United States]], FM overtook AM as the dominant broadcast radio band in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

===Timeline===
* 1924: WPAJ (now [[WDRC (AM)]]) broadcast in stereo from [[New Haven, Connecticut]], using two transmitters: one on 1120&amp;nbsp;kHz and the other on 1320&amp;nbsp;kHz. However stereo separation was poor, to preserve compatibility for mono listeners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wa2fnq.com/fnq/amstrdoc.htm | title = AM Stereo | work = WA2FNQ web site | first = Gerald J. | last = Mehrab | location = [[Northport, New York]] | date = 2008-02-01 | accessdate = 2010-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the 1950s, several AM stereo systems were proposed (including the original RCA AM/FM system which later became the Belar system in the 1970s) but the FCC did not propose any standard as AM was still dominant over FM at the time.
* 1960: AM stereo first demonstrated on [[XETRA-AM]], [[Tijuana]], [[Mexico]], using the Kahn [[independent sideband]] system.
* 1963: [[WHAZ (AM)|WHAZ]] runs a stereo program on eight AM stations, four on each channel.
* 1980: After five years of testing the five systems, the United States [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) selected the [[Magnavox]] system as the official AM stereo standard. The FCC's research is immediately accused of being flawed and incomplete.
* 1982: After a series of lawsuits and accusations, the FCC decides to let the marketplace decide and revokes the [[Magnavox]] certification as the AM stereo standard for political reasons. Belar had dropped out of the AM stereo race due to receiver distortion problems, leaving [[Motorola]] [[C-QUAM]], [[Harris Corporation]], Magnavox, and the Kahn/Hazeltine [[independent sideband]] system.
* 1984: [[General Motors]], [[Ford]], [[Chrysler]], and a number of import automakers begin installing C-QUAM AM stereo receivers in automobiles, beginning with the 1985 model year. [[Harris Corporation]] abandons its AM stereo system and puts its support behind C-QUAM (Harris continues to manufacture C-QUAM equipment today).
* 1985: AM stereo broadcasting officially begins in [[Australia]], with the C-QUAM standard.
* 1988: [[Canada]] and [[Mexico]] adopt C-QUAM as their standard for AM stereo.
* 1992: [[Japan]] adopts C-QUAM as its standard for AM stereo.
* 1993: The FCC makes C-QUAM the AM stereo standard for stations in the U.S., and also grants "stereo preference" for radio stations requesting to move to the [[AM expanded band]] (1610–1700&amp;nbsp;kHz), although such stations have never actually been required to transmit in stereo.
* 1993: The [[AMAX]] certification program begins. This was to set an official manufacturing standard for high-quality AM radio receivers, with a wider audio bandwidth for higher fidelity reception of strong signals, and optionally C-QUAM AM stereo. Despite the availability of AMAX receivers from companies like [[Sony]], [[General Electric]], [[Denon]], and AMAX-certified car radios from the domestic and Japanese automakers, most electronics manufacturers did not wish to implement the more costly AMAX [[tuner (radio)|tuner]] design in their radios, so most AM radios today remain in mono with limited fidelity.
* 2006 to present: AM stereo gains new life through the support for C-QUAM decoding in most receivers designed for [[HD Radio]].{{clarify|date=September 2010}}&lt;!-- other articles say HD Radio and C-QUAM are mutually incompatible. --&gt;  These new digital radios receive AM stereo signals, although the AM transmitters are now limited to 10&amp;nbsp;kHz audio bandwidth and the HD receivers flip Left and Right channels in decoding C-QUAM stereo.

==Broadcasting systems==
The Magnavox PMX, Harris Corporation V-CPM, and Motorola C-QUAM (Compatible—Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) were all based around modulating the phase and amplitude of the carrier, placing the stereo information in the phase modulated portion, while the standard mono (L+R) information is in the amplitude modulation. The systems all did this in similar (but not completely compatible) ways. The original Harris Corporation system was later changed to match the Motorola C-QUAM pilot tone for indicating the station was in stereo, thus making it compatible with all C-QUAM receivers.

===Harris System===
This system, known as V-CPM for Variable Angle Compatible Phase Multiplex, was developed by [[Harris Corporation]], a major manufacturer of radio/TV transmitters. It incorporated a left minus right component which was frequency modulated by about 1&amp;nbsp;kHz. Harris is the successor to the pioneer Gates radio line, which has changed its name in 2014 to Gates-Air. The Harris system eventually changed their pilot tone to be compatible with C-QUAM, after C-QUAM became the more popular and eventually, the FCC approved standard. [[CKLW (AM)|CKLW]] in [[Windsor, Ontario]], [[Canada]] (also serving nearby [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]) was among the first stations to broadcast in Harris AM stereo. The Harris system is currently no longer used in its original form.

===Magnavox System===
This system was developed by electronics manufacturer, [[Magnavox]]. It is a [[phase modulation]] system. It was initially declared the AM stereo standard by the FCC in 1980, but the FCC later declared that stations were free to choose any system. As with the Harris system, it was popular in the 1980s, but most stations stopped broadcasting in stereo, or downgraded to the C-QUAM system as time went on. 1190 [[WOWO (AM)|WOWO]] in [[Fort Wayne]], [[Indiana]] was the (then) 50,000-watt clear channel Magnavox flagship station.

===Motorola C-QUAM===
[[C-QUAM]] was developed and promoted primarily by Motorola, a longtime manufacturer of two-way radio equipment. It became the dominant system by the late 1980s, and was declared the official standard by the FCC in 1993. While many stations in the USA have since discontinued broadcasting in stereo, many still have the necessary equipment to do so. C-QUAM is still popular in other parts of the world, such as [[Canada]], [[Japan]], and [[Australia]] which it was declared the official standard.

QUAM uses [[quadrature phase]] and [[amplitude modulation]]: the phase of the audio is rotated ahead or behind the carrier and the amplitude of each phase is also changed; thus giving 16 points for reference (used also in dialup modems to get past the 9,600 bit/s limit on analog lines). The QUAM signal (left minus right, or "L-R", information) is then phase modulated on the transmitter (the QUAM exciter replaced the crystal in the AM transmitter) and the left plus right (or "L+R") still modulated the transmitter as it had in the past. C-QUAM is a modified QUAM and thus called "compatible" (the "C-" in "C-QUAM").

C-QUAM had been long criticized by the Kahn-Hazeltine system's creator, Leonard Kahn as being inferior to his system. First generation C-QUAM receivers suffered from "platform motion" effects when listening to stations received via [[skywave]]. Later improvements by Motorola minimized the platform motion effect and increased audio quality and stereo separation, especially on [[AMAX]]-certified receivers in the 1990s.

===Kahn-Hazeltine===
The Kahn-Hazeltine system also called [[Independent sideband|ISB]] was developed by American engineer [[Leonard R. Kahn]] and the [[Hazeltine Corporation]]. This system used an entirely different principle—using independently modulated upper and lower sidebands. While a station using the system would sound best with proper decoding, it was also possible to use two standard AM radios (one tuned above and the other below the primary carrier) to achieve the stereophonic effect, although with poor stereo separation and fidelity compared to a proper Kahn system AM stereo receiver. One of the best known stations to use the Kahn system was 890/[[WLS (AM)|WLS]], Chicago. WLS still transmits in AM stereo today but uses the Motorola C-QUAM system instead.

However, the Kahn system suffered from lower stereo separation above 5&amp;nbsp;kHz (reaching none at 7&amp;nbsp;kHz whereas FM stereo has 40&amp;nbsp;dB or more separation at 15&amp;nbsp;kHz) and the [[radio antenna]] array on directional AM (common on a lot of nighttime and some daytime stations) had to have a flat response across the entire 20&amp;nbsp;kHz AM channel. If the array had a higher reactance value (leading to a higher [[Standing wave ratio]]) on one side of the frequency vs the other, it would affect the audio response of that channel and thus the stereo signal would be affected. Also, Kahn refused to license any radio receivers manufacturers with his design, although multi-system receivers were manufactured by various companies such as [[Sony]], [[Sansui Electric|Sansui]], and [[Sanyo]], which could receive any of the four AM stereo systems.

Nonetheless, this system remained competitive with C-QUAM into the late 1980s and Kahn was very vocal about its advantages over Motorola's system. Kahn filed a lawsuit claiming that the Motorola system did not meet FCC emission bandwidth specifications, but by that time, C-QUAM had already been declared as the single standard for AM stereo in the USA.

Kahn's AM stereo design was later revamped for monaural use and used in the Power-Side system, in which a decreased signal in one sideband is used to improve coverage and loudness, especially with directional antenna arrays. Power-Side became the basis for [[CAM-D]], Compatible AM Digital, a new digital system being promoted by Leonard Kahn and used on several AM stations.

Kahn receiver chips have also been used as an inexpensive method for providing high frequency ([[world band]]) receivers with synchronous detection technology.

===Belar System===
The Belar system was used in limited number of stations, such as [[WJR]]. The Belar system, originally designed by [[RCA]] in the 1950s, was a simple FM/AM modulation system,&lt;ref&gt;AM Stereo articles from Radio-Electronics Dec77, Popular-Electronics Dec78, and Popular-Electronics Aug80 [http://www.amstzone.org/RE77,PE78,PE80-AM_Stereo.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; with an attenuated L-R signal frequency modulating the carrier (with a 400&amp;nbsp;µs pre-emphasis) in the extent of +/- 320&amp;nbsp;Hz around the center frequency, and the L+R doing the normal "high level" AM modulation (usually referred to as [[Amplitude modulation#High-level generation|plate modulation]] in transmitters using a tube in the final stage, where the audio is applied to the plate voltage of the tube; in solid state transmitters, various different techniques are available that are more efficient at lower power levels). The Belar system (by the company of the same name) was dropped due to issues with its design though it was much easier to implement than the other systems. It and the Kahn system did not suffer from platform motion (which was a killer for AM stereo at night; platform motion is where the stereo balance would shift from one side to the other and then back to center) but the use of low level frequency modulation did not permit a high separation of L and R channels.

==Adoption in the United States==
In 1975, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) started a series of five-year tests to determine which of the five competing standards would be selected. By the end of the testing period, the Belar system was dropped. In 1980, the FCC announced that the [[Magnavox]] system would become the standard. This announcement was met with harsh criticism and a series of lawsuits. On March 4, 1982, the FCC revoked their endorsement to the Magnavox standard and let the marketplace decide, meaning that all four standards were allowed. After the 1982 decision, many stations implemented one of the four standards. Initially, all systems remained competitive, but by the later 1980s, [[Motorola]] [[C-QUAM]] had a clear majority of stations and receivers. Around this same time, [[Harris Corporation]] dropped their system and instead endorsed C-QUAM. During this time, radio manufactures either made receivers which decoded just one system, or decoded all four. The multiple systems used greatly confused consumers and severely impacted consumer adoption. As a result of this confusion, and the continued growth of the FM band, interest in AM stereo dwindled.

In 1993, the FCC declared Motorola's C-QUAM system the standard. To ensure that all AM stereo receivers maintained the same sound quality, the [[National Association of Broadcasters]] and the [[Electronic Industries Association]] started the [[AMAX]] certification program.

==Global adoption==
In the early 1980s, other countries, most notably [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[Japan]] approved and implemented AM stereo systems. Most governments approved a single standard, usually Motorola's C-QUAM, which greatly reduced confusion and increased user adoption.

Following the launch of the American-owned, ship-based [[pirate radio]] station [[Laser 558]] off the British coast, there were announcements that another such station, provisionally called Stereo Hits 576, would soon follow, using AM stereo on an adjacent frequency to Laser. Nothing ever came of this project and 576&amp;nbsp;kHz was adopted by [[Radio Caroline]] instead.

In many countries, especially those where the AM band is still dominant, AM stereo radios are still manufactured and stations still broadcast stereo signals.

==Current status==
Globally, interest in and use of AM stereo has been declining steadily since the 1990s, as many music stations have continued to move to the FM band. As a result, the vast majority of AM stations broadcast [[Talk radio|news/talk]] or [[Sports radio|sports/sports talk]] formats. Many of the stations that initially implemented AM stereo are [[clear-channel station|clear-channel]] 50,000-watt stations, and are more concerned with listening range than stereo sound (although there is no proof that use of AM stereo affects listening range){{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}. As a result, these stations still have the necessary equipment to broadcast in stereo, but it is left unused (or converted to [[HD Radio]]). Also, many former AM stereo stations were bought up by broadcasting conglomerates, which generally discourage AM stereo broadcasting. In the United States, most stations currently using AM stereo are small, independently owned and broadcast a variety or music format.

* United States: AM Stereo radio stations in the United States
* Japan: Between 1992 and 1996, 16 commercial broadcasting companies in [[Japan]] adopted C-QUAM because of the narrow Japanese FM band; it covers only 14&amp;nbsp;MHz (76-90&amp;nbsp;MHz), as opposed to the 20.5&amp;nbsp;MHz used in the rest of the world (87.5-108&amp;nbsp;MHz). However, it is now quite rare to see AM radios with the stereo function at appliance stores in Japan because of the decline in AM stereo stations and the limited available area, mainly in densely populated areas. 13 of the 16 stereo stations have since reverted to mono, 11 since the start of 2010 ([[:ja:AMステレオ放送]]), leaving only 3 stations broadcasting in stereo.
* Australia: AM stereo was popular in [[Australia]] because AM covers a wide geographic area compared to FM, in addition to the government's adoption of a single standard (Motorola C-QUAM) several years sooner than the USA, and Australia's relatively late adoption of FM (the frequencies in the FM band were originally allocated for TV). As of June 2008 no [[Melbourne]] AM stations broadcast C-QUAM AM stereo. At its peak popularity in the late 1980s the majority of stations did.
* Europe: After some experiments in the 1980s, AM stereo was deemed to be unsuitable for the crowded band conditions and narrow bandwidths associated with AM broadcasting in Europe. However, [[Motorola]] C-QUAM AM stereo remains in use today on a handful of stations in [[Italy]] and [[Greece]].
* Canada: AM stereo was more widely adopted in [[Canada]] than in the USA. This may have been due to the Canadian government's decision to use a single standard, and the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) licensing stations by format and their hit/non-hit rules for FM (hence, more music stations on AM). However, unlike in the USA, some former AM stereo stations have moved to the FM band and left the AM band altogether instead of simply reverting to mono.
* Brazil: AM stereo was considered in the 90s, however it never was implemented because of economic reasons.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newtoncbraga.com.br/index.php/artigos/49-curiosidades/6246-tel053.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surround sound==
On February 26, 2010, [[KCJJ]] (AM 1630) in Coralville, Iowa, aired a four-hour [[quadraphonic]] radio broadcast of the Robb Spewak show. The show spotlighted music from the quadraphonic era on the 40th anniversary of the format's release in America and was engineered by Tab Patterson. All the music was from discrete 4-channel tapes, then encoded into [[Dolby Pro Logic#Dolby Pro Logic II|Dolby Pro-Logic II]] and transmitted using their stereo C-QUAM transmitter.

==Decline in use==
Radio stations around the world are converting to various systems of [[digital radio]], such as [[Digital Radio Mondiale]], [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]] or [[HD Radio]] (in the United States). Some of these digital radio systems, most notably [[HD Radio]] have "hybrid modes" which let a station broadcast a standard AM signal along with the digital information. While these transmission modes allow standard AM, they are not compatible with any AM stereo system (meaning both cannot be broadcast at the same time).

Digital AM broadcasting systems, such as HD Radio have been criticized by supporters of AM stereo{{who|date=February 2014}} as sounding "harsh" and "artificial", but supporters of Digital systems argue that the extended frequency response, increased dynamic range, lack of noise and lower distortion make up for the compression artifacts. However, HD Radio also increases adjacent channel noise due to the digital sidebands, which pose serious problems for nighttime broadcasts. Some have proposed to use HD Radio in the daytime and AM stereo at night. Many HD radios are based on a common [[chipset]] that decodes C-QUAM.{{clarify|date=September 2010}}&lt;!-- other articles say HD Radio and C-QUAM are mutually incompatible. --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5681">The '''Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy''' ('''AURA''') is a consortium of universities and other institutions that operates [[astronomy|astronomical]] [[observatory|observatories]] and [[telescope]]s.  AURA recognizes its mission statement as "To promote excellence in astronomical research by providing access to state-of-the-art facilities."

Founded October 10, 1957 with the encouragement of the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF), AURA was incorporated by a group of seven U.S. universities: [[University of California|California]], [[University of Chicago|Chicago]], [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Indiana University|Indiana]], [[University of Michigan|Michigan]], [[Ohio State University|Ohio State]], and [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|Wisconsin]].  The first meeting of the Board of Directors took place in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]].  Today, AURA has 39 member institutions in the United States and seven international affiliate members.

AURA began as a small organization dedicated to ground-based optical astronomy, managing a range of 1- to 4-meter telescopes and providing community advocacy for optical/infrared astronomy.  Over the years, AURA expanded its focus to include Solar Astronomy and the Gemini 8-meter telescopes, going on to partner with other consortia such as WIYN (Wisconsin Indiana Yale &amp; NOAO) and SOAR (Southern Astrophysical Research).  In the 1980s, AURA took on the management of the Space Telescope Science Institute, opening up the ultraviolet, optical, and infrared wavelength bands in space with the Hubble Space Telescope.  AURA is furthering its aims in infrared space astronomy through the [[James Webb Space Telescope]] (JWST).

The organization is responsible for the operation of several important observatories, known as "AURA centers": the [[Gemini Observatory]]; the [[Large Synoptic Survey Telescope]] (LSST); the [[National Optical Astronomy Observatory]] (NOAO); the [[National Solar Observatory]] (NSO); and the [[Space Telescope Science Institute]] (STScI).

==Centers==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16554">A '''bachelor herd''' is a [[herd]] of (usually) juvenile male animals who are still sexually immature or 'harem'-forming animals who have been thrown out of their parent groups but not yet formed a new family group. It may also refer to a group of males who are not currently territorial or mating with females. &lt;ref name="estes"&gt;{{cite book |last=Estes |first=R.D. |authorlink=Richard Despard Estes |title=The Behavior Guide to African Mammals: Including Hoofed Mammals, Carnivores, Primates |year=2004 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley, US |pages=158-66 |isbn=978-0-520-08085-0|}} &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="Braje"&gt;{{cite book |last=Braje |first=Todd |title=Human Impacts on Seals, Sea Lions, and Sea Otters: Integrating Archaeology and Ecology in the Northeast Pacific |year=2011 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley, US |pages=210-222 |isbn=978-0-520-67268-0}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Examples include [[seal (mammal)|seal]]s, [[dolphin]]s, [[lion]]s, and many [[herbivore]]s such as [[deer]], [[horse]]s, and [[elephant]]s. Bachelor herds are thought to provide useful protection for social animals against more established herd competition or aggressive, dominant males. Males in bachelor herds are sometimes closely related to each other. Some animals, for example [[Arctocephalus forsteri|New Zealand fur seals]], live in a bachelor herd all year except for the mating season, when there is a substantial increase in aggression and competition. &lt;ref name="Chilvers"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chilvers |first1=B.L. |last2=Goldsworthy |first2=S.D. |title=Arctocephalus forsteri, New Zealand Fur Seal |journal=[[The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]] |year=2015 |pages=1-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many species, males and females move in separate groups, often coming together at mating time, or to fight for [[territory (animal)|territory]] or mating partners. In many species it is common for males to leave or be driven from the group as they mature, and they may wander as lone animals or form a bachelor group for the time being. This arrangement may be long term and stable, or short term until they find a new group to join. 

== Types of bachelor herds ==
The social structure, aggression level, population size, and duration of presence of these herds across species varies greatly. Bachelor herds are most often found in mammals and are especially common in the grasslands.  

===Impala===

Male [[impala]] form small bachelor herds during both the wet and dry seasons. These bachelor herds are generally smaller than herds of females, numbering around 4 members, compared to upwards of 10. &lt;ref name=”activity”&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jarman |first1=M.V. |last2=Jarman |first2=P.J. |title=Daily activity of impala |journal=[[African Journal of Ecology]] |year=1973 |volume=11 |pages=75-92 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2028.1973.tb00074.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Juvenile males begin to join bachelor herds at 8 months of age. &lt;ref name=”activity”&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jarman |first1=M.V. |last2=Jarman |first2=P.J. |title=Daily activity of impala |journal=[[African Journal of Ecology]] |year=1973 |volume=11 |pages=75-92 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2028.1973.tb00074.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Serengeti, immature or older males will usually form their own bachelor herds, while males of reproductive age are more often in mixed groups with females. &lt;ref name="estes"&gt;{{cite book |last=Estes |first=R.D. |authorlink=Richard Despard Estes |title=The Behavior Guide to African Mammals: Including Hoofed Mammals, Carnivores, Primates |year=2004 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley, US |pages=158-66 |isbn=978-0-520-08085-0|}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Being actively territorial in the [[Serengeti National Park|Serengeti]] is physically demanding for male impala, so males occupy this role for about 3 months. &lt;ref name="estes"&gt;{{cite book |last=Estes |first=R.D. |authorlink=Richard Despard Estes |title=The Behavior Guide to African Mammals: Including Hoofed Mammals, Carnivores, Primates |year=2004 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley, US |pages=158-66 |isbn=978-0-520-08085-0|}} &lt;/ref&gt; Males will then join a bachelor herd, though this results in them occupying a social dominance status at the bottom of the [[Dominance hierarchy|linear rank hierarchy]] until their physical condition returns to pre-territorial levels. &lt;ref name="Jarman"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jarman |first=Martha J. |date=1974 |title=Impala social behaviour: territory, hierarchy, mating, and the use of space}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bachelor herds may coexist with territorial males in the same area, but these individual males are always dominant above bachelor males. &lt;ref name="Jarman"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jarman |first=Martha J. |date=1974 |title=Impala social behaviour: territory, hierarchy, mating, and the use of space}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the herds, bachelor males are less [[Territory (animal)|territorial]] toward each other than males in mixed herds. These males maintain, on average, a relatively large distance of approximately {{convert|2.5|-|3|m|ft}} between them. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Hart |first1 = B.L. |last2 = Hart |first2 = L.A. |title = Reciprocal allogrooming in impala, ''Aepyceros melampus'' |journal = [[Animal Behaviour (journal)|Animal Behaviour]] |year = 1992 |volume = 44 |issue = 6 |pages = 1073–1083 |doi = 10.1016/S0003-3472(05)80319-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, bachelor males exhibit [[Social grooming|reciprocal grooming]] despite occasional aggressive interactions between bachelors. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Murray |first = M.G. |title = Structure of association in impala, ''Aepyceros melampus'' |journal = [[Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology]] |date = 1981 |volume = 9 |issue = 1 |pages = 23–33 |doi = 10.1007/BF00299849}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fur seals===
[[File:Fur seal rookery on St. Paul Island (6383866587).jpg|thumb|Fur seal rookery during the non-mating season at [[Saint Paul Island (Alaska)|St. Paul Island, Alaska]]]]
Male [[fur seals]], as a family, commonly live in bachelor herds during the non-[[breeding season]]. &lt;ref name="Crawley"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crawley |first1=M.C. |last2=Wilson |first2=G.J. |title=The Natural History and Behaviour of the New Zealand Fur Seal |journal=[[Tuatara: Journal of the Biological Society]] |year=1976 |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=1-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the breeding season (April-September in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], September-January in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]), the size of herds greatly diminishes. &lt;ref name="Chilvers"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chilvers |first1=B.L. |last2=Goldsworthy |first2=S.D. |title=Arctocephalus forsteri, New Zealand Fur Seal |journal=[[The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]] |year=2015 |pages=1-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; These bachelor herds are large in size, ranging from 15,000 to more than 20,000 seals living in one area, referred to as a [[rookery]]. &lt;ref name="Braje"&gt;{{cite book |last=Braje |first=Todd |title=Human Impacts on Seals, Sea Lions, and Sea Otters: Integrating Archaeology and Ecology in the Northeast Pacific |year=2011 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley, US |pages=210-222 |isbn=978-0-520-67268-0}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The grounds occupied by fur seal bachelor herds are generally far away from [[breeding grounds]], anywhere from {{convert |1|mi|km}} or more.  Members of the group range from seal that are one year old, called yearlings, up through older seals. &lt;ref name="Braje"&gt;{{cite book |last=Braje |first=Todd |title=Human Impacts on Seals, Sea Lions, and Sea Otters: Integrating Archaeology and Ecology in the Northeast Pacific |year=2011 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley, US |pages=210-222 |isbn=978-0-520-67268-0}} &lt;/ref&gt; There appears to be no rigid social structure during the non-breeding season and there is little competition for food or mates. The male fur seals are also mostly non-aggressive. &lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;{{cite book |last=Martin |first=Fredericka |title=Before the Storm: A Year in the Pribilof Island, 1941-1942 |year=2010 |publisher=University of Alaska Press |pages=33-35 |isbn=978-1-602-23103-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="Braje"&gt;{{cite book |last=Braje |first=Todd |title=Human Impacts on Seals, Sea Lions, and Sea Otters: Integrating Archaeology and Ecology in the Northeast Pacific |year=2011 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley, US |pages=210-222 |isbn=978-0-520-67268-0}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Fur seal bachelor herds are frequently targets of the [[seal hunt]] due to large populations being concentrated in a relatively small area. There are few regulations in regard to adult male seal hunting due to limited effects on the future population. &lt;ref name="Braje"&gt;{{cite book |last=Braje |first=Todd |title=Human Impacts on Seals, Sea Lions, and Sea Otters: Integrating Archaeology and Ecology in the Northeast Pacific |year=2011 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley, US |pages=210-222 |isbn=978-0-520-67268-0}} &lt;/ref&gt;

===Cape mountain zebras===
[[Cape mountain zebra]] male [[foals]] often leave the breeding herd they were born in after the birth of siblings or around age 2, though the [[stallion]] of the breeding herd does not force them out. &lt;ref name=”Skinner”&gt;{{cite book |last1=Skinner |first1=J.D. |last2=Chimimba |first2=Christian |title=The Mammals of the Southern African Subregion |year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |pages=538-540 |isbn=978-0-521-84418-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, it has been observed that stallions often try to prevent foals from leaving the herd. &lt;ref name=”Skinner”&gt;{{cite book |last1=Skinner |first1=J.D. |last2=Chimimba |first2=Christian |title=The Mammals of the Southern African Subregion |year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |pages=538-540 |isbn=978-0-521-84418-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; These males then often go on to form their own bachelor herd or join an existing one. Males then stay in these bachelor herds until age 5, when they leave to become the stallion of their own breeding herd with one or more [[mares]]. &lt;ref name="Penzhorn"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Penzhorn |first1=Banie |title=Social organization of the Cape Mountain Zebra in the Mountain Zebra National Park |journal=[[Koedoe: African Protect Area Conservation and Science]] |year=1979 |volume=22 |pages=115-156 |doi=10.4102/koedoe.v22i1.655}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Cape mountain zebra bachelor herds, there is usually no [[social hierarchy]]. &lt;ref name=”Estes”&gt;{{cite book |last=Estes |first=R.D. |authorlink=Richard Despard Estes |title=The Behavior Guide to African Mammals: Including Hoofed Mammals, Carnivores, Primates |year=2004 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley, US |pages=246-248 |isbn=978-0-520-08085-0|}} &lt;/ref&gt; Dominance is given to the more senior members of the herd and when the oldest males leave to form a breeding herd, the next oldest bachelors take on the leadership role. There is minimal intragroup aggression and no observed fighting between members for a higher social position. &lt;ref name="Penzhorn"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Penzhorn |first1=Banie |title=Social organization of the Cape Mountain Zebra in the Mountain Zebra National Park |journal=[[Koedoe: African Protect Area Conservation and Science]] |year=1979 |volume=22 |pages=115-156 |doi=10.4102/koedoe.v22i1.655}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bachelor herds often move with a breeding herd that is occupying a nearby area. &lt;ref name=”Estes”&gt;{{cite book |last=Estes |first=R.D. |authorlink=Richard Despard Estes |title=The Behavior Guide to African Mammals: Including Hoofed Mammals, Carnivores, Primates |year=2004 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley, US |pages=246-248 |isbn=978-0-520-08085-0|}} &lt;/ref&gt; At least one member of the bachelor herd in this case is usually the offspring of a mare in the breeding herd. &lt;ref name=”Estes”&gt;{{cite book |last=Estes |first=R.D. |authorlink=Richard Despard Estes |title=The Behavior Guide to African Mammals: Including Hoofed Mammals, Carnivores, Primates |year=2004 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley, US |pages=246-248 |isbn=978-0-520-08085-0|}} &lt;/ref&gt; [[Fillies]] also often temporarily join bachelor herds after leaving their maternal herd at the onset of their first [[estrus]]. The fillies then stay with the group until they join an existing breeding herd or make their own breeding herd with a bachelor male from the herd. &lt;ref name=”Skinner”&gt;{{cite book |last1=Skinner |first1=J.D. |last2=Chimimba |first2=Christian |title=The Mammals of the Southern African Subregion |year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |pages=538-540 |isbn=978-0-521-84418-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="Penzhorn"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Penzhorn |first1=Banie |title=Social organization of the Cape Mountain Zebra in the Mountain Zebra National Park |journal=[[Koedoe: African Protect Area Conservation and Science]] |year=1979 |volume=22 |pages=115-156 |doi=10.4102/koedoe.v22i1.655}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Red deer===
[[File:RedDeerStag.jpg|thumb|Red deer stags before shedding their antlers]]
[[Red deer]] [[Stag|males]] leave their mothers between 1 and 2 years of age. &lt;ref name=”Geist”&gt;{{cite book |last1=Geist |first1=Valerie |title=Deer of the World: Their Evolution, Behaviour, and Ecology |year=1998 |publisher=Stackpole Books |location=Mechanicsburg, PA |pages=202-206 |isbn=978-0-811-70496-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; They then join bachelor herds, in which they spend most of the year. &lt;ref name=”Geist”&gt;{{cite book |last1=Geist |first1=Valerie |title=Deer of the World: Their Evolution, Behaviour, and Ecology |year=1998 |publisher=Stackpole Books |location=Mechanicsburg, PA |pages=202-206 |isbn=978-0-811-70496-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; These herds are smaller (less than 50 members) and more unstable than the female herds and they follow a [[Dominance hierarchy|linear dominance hierarchy]]. &lt;ref name=”Manning”&gt;{{cite book |last1=Manning |first1=Aubrey |last2=Dawkins |first2=Marian Stamp |title=An Introduction to Animal Behaviour |year=2012 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |pages=381-382 |isbn=978-1-107-37773-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=”Webster”&gt;{{cite book |last1=Webster |first1=John |title=Management and Welfare of Farm Animals: The UFAW Farm Handbook |year=2011 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |pages=394-400  |isbn=978-1-118-27940-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hierarchy is determined by both body size and the size of the stag’s [[antlers]], with older stags having on average larger antlers. &lt;ref name=”Geist”&gt;{{cite book |last1=Geist |first1=Valerie |title=Deer of the World: Their Evolution, Behaviour, and Ecology |year=1998 |publisher=Stackpole Books |location=Mechanicsburg, PA |pages=202-206 |isbn=978-0-811-70496-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The older stags in the herd maintain their dominance from one year to the next. &lt;ref name=”Webster”&gt;{{cite book |last1=Webster |first1=John |title=Management and Welfare of Farm Animals: The UFAW Farm Handbook |year=2011 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |pages=394-400  |isbn=978-1-118-27940-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aggression within the herd is low until the stags shed their antlers, usually in early April. &lt;ref name=”Manning”&gt;{{cite book |last1=Manning |first1=Aubrey |last2=Dawkins |first2=Marian Stamp |title=An Introduction to Animal Behaviour |year=2012 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |pages=381-382 |isbn=978-1-107-37773-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intragroup clashes then increase as the females go into [[estrus]]. Males compete with members of their own bachelor herd for the attention of the females. &lt;ref name=”Manning”&gt;{{cite book |last1=Manning |first1=Aubrey |last2=Dawkins |first2=Marian Stamp |title=An Introduction to Animal Behaviour |year=2012 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |pages=381-382 |isbn=978-1-107-37773-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is called the “[[rutting season]]” and it lasts only a few weeks before males and females separate into their respective herds. &lt;ref name=”Geist”&gt;{{cite book |last1=Geist |first1=Valerie |title=Deer of the World: Their Evolution, Behaviour, and Ecology |year=1998 |publisher=Stackpole Books |location=Mechanicsburg, PA |pages=202-206 |isbn=978-0-811-70496-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The level of aggression within the bachelor herd then decreases substantially. &lt;ref name=”Webster”&gt;{{cite book |last1=Webster |first1=John |title=Management and Welfare of Farm Animals: The UFAW Farm Handbook |year=2011 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |pages=394-400  |isbn=978-1-118-27940-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Community studies''' is an [[List of academic disciplines|academic field]] drawing on both [[sociology]] and [[anthropology]] and the [[social research]] [[methodology|methods]] of [[ethnography]] and [[participant observation]] in the study of community. In academic settings around the world, community studies is variously a sub-discipline of anthropology or sociology, or an independent discipline. It is often interdisciplinary and geared toward practical applications rather than purely theoretical perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;The University of California at Santa Cruz has an interdisciplinary [http://communitystudies.ucsc.edu/about_us/ Community Studies Department] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904163357/http://communitystudies.ucsc.edu/about_us/ |date=2006-09-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Community studies is sometimes combined with other fields, i.e., "Urban and Community Studies," "Health and Community Studies," or "Family and Community studies."&lt;ref&gt;Examples of Community Studies programs with a particular focus: [http://www.urbancenter.utoronto.ca/aboutcucs.html Urban and Community Studies] at the University of Toronto; [http://www.bournemouth.ac.uk/ihcs/ The Institute of Health and Community Studies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060713153603/http://www.bournemouth.ac.uk/ihcs/ |date=2006-07-13 }} at Bournemouth University, UK, and [http://www.douglas.bc.ca/faculties/child-family-community-studies/ The Faculty of Child, Family and Community Studies]  {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120730082307/http://www.douglas.bc.ca/faculties/child-family-community-studies/ |date=2012-07-30 }} at Douglas College, New Westminster BC, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epistemology ==
In [[North America]], community studies drew inspiration from the classic [[urban sociology]] texts produced by the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago School]], such as the works of [[Louis Wirth]] and [[William Foote Whyte]]. In [[United Kingdom|Britain]], community studies was developed for colonial administrators working in East Africa, particularly [[Kenya]].  It was further developed in the [[post-war]] period with the [[Institute of Community Studies]] founded by [[Michael Young (politician)|Michael Young]] in east London, and with the studies published from the Institute, such as ''[[Family and Kinship in East London]]''.

Community studies, like [[Colonialism|colonial]] [[anthropology]], have often assumed the existence of discrete, relatively [[wiktionary:Homogeneous|homogeneous]], almost [[tribe]]-like [[communities]], which can be studied as [[organic (model)|organic]] [[Holism|wholes]]. In this, it has been a key [[Social influence|influence]] on [[communitarianism]] and [[communalism]], from the [[Local community|local context]] to the [[Globalism|global]] and everywhere in between.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

== Curricula ==

Community studies [[Curriculum|curricula]] are often centered on the "concerns" of communities. These include mental and physical health, stress, addiction, AIDS, racism, immigration, ethnicity, gender, identity, sexuality, the environment, crime, deviance, delinquency, family problems, social competence, poverty, homelessness and other psycho-social aspects. Understanding the socio-cultural completeness and the anthropological ramifications of the accurate analysis of community health is key to the sphere of these studies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Journal of Community and Applied Social Psychology]], Aims and Scope&lt;/ref&gt;

Another focus of curricula in community studies is upon anthropology, [[cultural anthropology]] in particular. Some programs set as prerequisite knowledge, the background and historical contexts for community, drawing upon [[archeology|archeological findings]] and the theoretical underpinnings for social organization in ancient and prehistorical community settings. The theories connected with the so-called "[[Neolithic revolution]]" is one example of a deep study into how, where and why, hunter-gatherer communities formed.&lt;ref&gt;Bellwood, Peter. (2004). First Farmers: The Origins of Agricultural Societies. Blackwell Publishers. {{ISBN|0-631-20566-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Community studies have been linked to the causes of social justice, promoting peace and nonviolence and working towards social change, often within an [[Activism|activist]] framework.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: [http://admissions.ucsc.edu/pdf/Community_Studies_2005.pdf Community Studies 2005]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823122545/http://admissions.ucsc.edu/pdf/Community_Studies_2005.pdf |date=2006-08-23 }}, U.C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5668">'''Corticocortical Coherence''' is referred to the synchrony in the neural activity of different cortical brain areas. The neural activities are picked up by electrophysiological recordings from the brain (e.g. [[Electroencephalography|EEG]], [[Magnetoencephalography|MEG]], [[Electrocorticography|ECoG]], etc.). It is a method to study the brain's neural communication and function at rest or during functional tasks.

== History and Basics ==
Initial applications of spectral analysis for finding the relationship between the EEG recordings from different regions of scalp dates back to 1960's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walter|first=D. O.|date=1963-08-01|title=Spectral analysis for electroencephalograms: mathematical determination of neurophysiological relationships from records of limited duration|journal=Experimental Neurology|volume=8|pages=155–181|issn=0014-4886|pmid=20191690}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corticocortical coherence has since been extensively studied using [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] and [[Magnetoencephalography|MEG]] recording for potential diagnostic applications&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sklar|first=B.|last2=Hanley|first2=J.|last3=Simmons|first3=W. W.|date=1972-12-15|title=An EEG experiment aimed toward identifying dyslexic children|journal=Nature|volume=240|issue=5381|pages=414–416|issn=0028-0836|pmid=4564321}}&lt;/ref&gt; and beyond.

The exact origins of corticocortical is under active investigation. While the consensus suggests that the functional neural communication between distinct brain sources leads to synchronous activity in those regions (possibly connected by neural tracts, in either direct or indirect way),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lei|first=Xu|last2=Wu|first2=Taoyu|last3=Valdes-Sosa|first3=Pedro|date=2015-01-01|title=Incorporating priors for EEG source imaging and connectivity analysis|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnins.2015.00284/abstract|journal=Frontiers in Neuroscience|language=English|volume=9|doi=10.3389/fnins.2015.00284|issn=1662-453X|pmc=4539512|pmid=26347599}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-0-387-88630-5_8|title=Computational Neuroscience|last=Ramírez|first=Rey R.|last2=Wipf|first2=David|last3=Baillet|first3=Sylvain|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Springer New York|isbn=9780387886299|editor-last=Chaovalitwongse|editor-first=Wanpracha|series=Springer Optimization and Its Applications|pages=127–155|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-0-387-88630-5_8|editor-last2=Pardalos|editor-first2=Panos M.|editor-last3=Xanthopoulos|editor-first3=Petros}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=He|first=B.|last2=Liu|first2=Z.|date=2008-01-01|title=Multimodal Functional Neuroimaging: Integrating Functional MRI and EEG/MEG|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4664427/|journal=IEEE Reviews in Biomedical Engineering|volume=1|pages=23–40|doi=10.1109/RBME.2008.2008233|issn=1937-3333|pmc=2903760|pmid=20634915}}&lt;/ref&gt; an alternative explanation emphasises on single focal oscillations that occur at single brain sources that eventually appear connected or synchronous in different scalp or brain source regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Delorme|first=Arnaud|last2=Palmer|first2=Jason|last3=Onton|first3=Julie|last4=Oostenveld|first4=Robert|last5=Makeig|first5=Scott|date=2012-02-15|title=Independent EEG Sources Are Dipolar|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0030135|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=7|issue=2|pages=e30135|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0030135|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3280242|pmid=22355308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corticocortical coherence has been of special interest in delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma frequency bands (commonly used for [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] studies).

==  Methods, Mathematics and Statistics ==
Cortico-cortical coherence is commonly studied using bipolar channels of EEG recordings, as well as unipolar channels of EEG or MEG signals; however, unipolar channels are usually used to estimate the brain sources and their connectivity, using electrical source imaging and connectivity analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mehrkanoon|first=Saeid|last2=Breakspear|first2=Michael|last3=Britz|first3=Juliane|last4=Boonstra|first4=Tjeerd W.|date=2014-09-17|title=Intrinsic Coupling Modes in Source-Reconstructed Electroencephalography|url=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/brain.2014.0280|journal=Brain Connectivity|volume=4|issue=10|pages=812–825|doi=10.1089/brain.2014.0280|issn=2158-0014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A classic and commonly used approach to assess the synchrony between neural signals is to use [[Coherence (signal processing)|Coherence]].&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, D. M., Rosenberg, J. R., Amjad, A. M., Breeze, P., Conway, B. A., &amp; Farmer, S. F. (1995). A framework for the analysis of mixed time series/point process data—Theory and application to the study of physiological tremor, single motor unit discharges and electromyograms. Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology, 64(2–3), 237–278. http://doi.org/10.1016/S0079-6107(96)00009-0&lt;/ref&gt;

Statistical significance of coherence is found as function of number of data segments with assumption of the signals' normal distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, D. M., &amp; Rosenberg, J. R. (1999). Time and frequency domain analysis of spike train and time series data. In Modern techniques in neuroscience research (pp. 503–543). Springer. Retrieved from http://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-58552-4_18&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively non-parametric techniques such as bootstrapping can be used.

{{About|the University of Illinois satellite|the Surrey satellite|CubeSail}}
'''CubeSail''' mission is a low-cost spacecraft propulsion demonstration using two identical 1.5U [[CubeSat]] satellites to deploy a 260 m-long, 20 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; [[solar sail]] ribbon between them.  This mission is a technology demonstration for the larger [[UltraSail]] heliogyro by the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois]].

==Overview==

[[File:sail-design-types.gif|thumb|right|Solar sail types. A heliogyro could have dozens of blades]]
The University of Illinois together with CU Aerospace designed this mission to demonstrate deployment and to measure the thrust on a 7.7cm × 260 m membrane (about 20 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The membrane will be deployed between two 1.5U CubeSats that will separate from each other in low Earth orbit. It is intended as a first step towards a larger (1,600 kg&lt;ref name='development 2014'/&gt;) solar sail concept called [[UltraSail]] intended for interplanetary and [[Interstellar travel|interstellar missions]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://aerospace.illinois.edu/news/nasa-launch-two-small-ae-satellites NASA to Launch Two Small AE Satellites]. ''Aerospace Illinois''. 22 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This last consists of multiple CubeSail-like structures that extend kilometers long film blades to ultimately form a [http://wiki.solarsails.info/index.php/Heliogyro heliogyro]. Each sail blade would be as long as  {{convert|5|km|mi}}.&lt;ref name='development 2014'&gt; [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gary_Swenson/publication/264854518_INITIAL_DEVELOPMENT_OF_THE_CUBESAILULTRASAIL_SPACECRAFT/links/53fdc6140cf2dca8000383d7/INITIAL-DEVELOPMENT-OF-THE-CUBESAIL-ULTRASAIL-SPACECRAFT.pdf Initial development of the CubeSail UltraSail spacecraft.] R. L. Burton, J. K. Laystrom-Woodard, G. F. Benavides, D. L. Carroll, V. L. Coverstone, G. R. Swenson, A. Pukniel, A. Ghosh, and A. D. Moctezuma.  27 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In the UltraSail version, the spacecraft spins around a central hub to flatten the blades by centrifugal force, supported by tip-CubeSats.  For the kilometre long blades' stability, this requires a rotational period of 1 – 2 hours so they overcome the solar pressure force by 3 to 5 times. Each blade is a thin [[polyimide]] film coated with [[ripstop]].&lt;ref name='development 2014'/&gt; The blades would provide propulsion by [[radiation pressure]] exerted by sunlight. 

The heliogyro was conceived by Richard H. MacNeal in 1967 and published in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;MacNeal R. H., "Structural Dynamics of the Heliogyro", NASA-CR-1745A, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='development 2014'/&gt;

==UltraSail control==

Although the heliogyro design has no mass advantage over a square sail, it remains attractive because the method of deploying a large sail is simpler than a strut-based design.&lt;ref name=jpl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://solarsails.jpl.nasa.gov/introduction/design-construction.html |title=Design &amp; Construction|publisher=NASA JPL |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050311004606/http://solarsails.jpl.nasa.gov/introduction/design-construction.html |archivedate = 2005-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blade stiffness is achieved by spinning the spacecraft (centrifugal force) with rotational axis generally pointing at the Sun. The heliogyro's [[Attitude control|attitude]] (orientation), and therefore thrust direction, is controlled by changing the cyclic and collective blade pitch similar to a helicopter, but in this case blade control is initiated by low-mass controllable mini-satellites at the tip of each blade.&lt;ref name='development 2014'/&gt; Each mini-satellite would be a 5 meter long carbon-fiber structure with a total mass of 50 kg, including avionics and 20 kg propellant (catalyzed nitrous oxide (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) and cold gas).&lt;ref name='development 2014'/&gt;

The maximum expected thrust force due to solar pressure for the baseline UltraSail design is 0.228 [[Newton (unit)|N]].

==Launch==
   
CubeSail is planned to be launched on an [[Electron (rocket)|Electron]] launch vehicle in 2018 from New Zealand.&lt;ref name='launch date'/&gt;&lt;ref name=nz&gt;{{cite web |title=New Zealand Launch Record (2009 to present) |url=http://www.sworld.com.au/steven/space/nz-rec.txt |first=Steven |last=Pietrobon |access-date=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was selected in 2012 by NASA to be launched as part of the [[Educational Launch of Nanosatellites|ELaNa]] program.&lt;ref name=''&gt;[http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/cubesail.htm CubeSail]].

[[Image:Decision Problem.svg|thumb|200px|A ''decision problem'' has only two possible outputs (''yes'' or ''no'') on any input.]]
In [[computability theory]] and [[computational complexity theory]], a '''decision problem''' is a problem that can be posed as a [[yes-no question]] of the input values. An example of a decision problem is deciding whether a given natural number is [[prime]]. Another is the problem "given two numbers ''x'' and ''y'', does ''x'' evenly divide ''y''?".  The answer is either 'yes' or 'no' depending upon the values of ''x'' and ''y''. A method for solving a decision problem, given in the form of an [[algorithm]], is called a '''decision procedure''' for that problem. A decision procedure for the decision problem "given two numbers ''x'' and ''y'', does ''x'' evenly divide ''y''?" would give the steps for determining whether ''x'' evenly divides ''y''. One such algorithm is [[long division]]. If the remainder is zero the answer is 'yes', otherwise it is 'no'. A decision problem which can be solved by an algorithm is called ''decidable''.

Decision problems typically appear in mathematical questions of [[decidability (logic)|decidability]], that is, the question of the existence of an [[effective method]] to determine the existence of some object or its membership in a set; some of the most important problems in mathematics are [[undecidable problem|undecidable]].

The field of computational complexity categorizes ''decidable'' decision problems by how difficult they are to solve. "Difficult", in this sense, is described in terms of the [[computational resource]]s needed by the most efficient algorithm for a certain problem. The field of [[recursion theory]], meanwhile, categorizes ''undecidable'' decision problems by [[Turing degree]], which is a measure of the noncomputability inherent in any solution.

==Definition==
A ''decision problem'' is a yes-or-no question on an [[infinite set]] of inputs. It is traditional to define the decision problem as the set of possible inputs together with the set of inputs for which the answer is ''yes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cs.stanford.edu/~trevisan/cs254-10/lecture02.pdf|title=CS254: Computational Complexity: Lecture 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These inputs can be natural numbers, but can also be values of some other kind, like binary [[string (computer science)|string]]s or strings over some other [[Alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]]. The subset of strings for which the problem returns "yes" is a [[formal language]], and often decision problems are defined as formal languages.

Using an encoding such as [[Gödel numbering]]s, any string can be encoded as a natural number, via which a decision problem can be defined as a subset of the natural numbers.

==Examples==
A classic example of a decidable decision problem is the set of prime numbers. It is possible to effectively decide whether a given natural number is prime by testing every possible nontrivial factor. Although much more efficient methods of [[primality testing]] are known, the existence of any effective method is enough to establish decidability.

== Decidability ==

{{main|Undecidable problem|Decidability (logic)}}

A decision problem ''A'' is ''decidable'' or ''effectively solvable'' if ''A'' is a [[recursive set]].  A problem is ''partially decidable'', ''semidecidable'', ''solvable'', or ''provable'' if ''A'' is a [[recursively enumerable set]].  Problems that are not decidable are ''undecidable''. For those it is not possible to create an algorithm, efficient or otherwise, that solves them.

The [[halting problem]] is an important undecidable decision problem; for more examples, see [[list of undecidable problems]].

== Complete problems ==

{{main|Complete problem}}

Decision problems can be ordered according to [[many-one reduction|many-one reducibility]] and related to feasible reductions such as [[polynomial-time reduction]]s. A decision problem ''P'' is said to be ''[[complete problem|complete]]'' for a set of decision problems ''S'' if ''P'' is a member of ''S'' and every problem in ''S'' can be reduced to ''P''. Complete decision problems are used in [[computational complexity theory]] to characterize [[complexity class]]es of decision problems. For example, the [[Boolean satisfiability problem]] is complete for the class [[NP (complexity)|NP]] of decision problems under polynomial-time reducibility.

==Function problems==
{{main|function problem}}

Decision problems are closely related to [[function problem]]s, which can have answers that are more complex than a simple 'yes' or 'no'.  A corresponding function problem is "given two numbers ''x'' and ''y'', what is ''x'' divided by ''y''?".

A [[function problem]] consists of a [[partial function]] ''f''; the informal "problem" is to compute the values of ''f'' on the inputs for which it is defined.

Every function problem can be turned into a decision problem; the decision problem is just the graph of the associated function.   (The graph of a function ''f'' is the set of pairs (''x'',''y'') such that ''f''(''x'') = ''y''.)  If this decision problem were effectively solvable then the function problem would be as well.  This reduction does not respect computational complexity, however.  For example, it is possible for the graph of a function to be decidable in polynomial time (in which case running time is computed as a function of the pair (''x'',''y'') ) when the function is not computable in [[polynomial time]] (in which case running time is computed as a function of ''x'' alone).  The function ''f''(''x'') = ''2''&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; has this property.

Every decision problem can be converted into the function problem of computing the [[indicator function|characteristic function]] of the set associated to the decision problem.   If this function is computable then the associated decision problem is decidable. However, this reduction is more liberal than the standard reduction used in computational complexity (sometimes called polynomial-time many-one reduction); for example, the complexity of the characteristic functions of an [[NP-complete]] problem and its [[co-NP-complete]] [[Complement (complexity)|complement]] is exactly the same even though the underlying decision problems may not be considered equivalent in some typical models of computation.

==Optimization problems==
{{main|Optimization problem}}

Unlike decision problems, for which there is only one correct answer for each input, optimization problems are concerned with finding the ''best'' answer to a particular input.  Optimization problems arise naturally in many applications, such as the [[traveling salesman problem]] and many questions in [[linear programming]].

There are standard techniques for transforming function and optimization problems into decision problems. For example, in the traveling salesman problem, the optimization problem is to produce a tour with minimal weight. The associated decision problem is: for each ''N'', to decide whether the graph has any tour with weight less than ''N''.  By repeatedly answering the decision problem, it is possible to find the minimal weight of a tour.

Because the theory of decision problems is very well developed, research in complexity theory has typically focused on decision problems. Optimization problems themselves are still of interest in computability theory, as well as in fields such as [[operations research]].

In [[cell biology]], a '''deuterosome''' is a protein structure within a multiciliated cell (such as an epithelial cell of [[respiratory tract]]) that produces multiple [[centriole]]s.

Most cells in human body possess one primary [[cilium]],&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, Mary Beth (September 2005). ''The Importance of Being Cilia''. HHMI Bulletin (Howard Hughes Medical Institute) 18 (2). Retrieved 2008-07-26&lt;/ref&gt; a relatively small protrusion of the cell membrane that looks like a stick or a finger under the electron microscope. Primary cilium is typically used by the cell as a sensory organelle, or antenna.&lt;ref&gt;Singla V (2006). ''The primary cilium as the cell's antenna: signaling at a sensory organelle.'' Science. 313(5787):629-33.&lt;/ref&gt; Some cells, however, have numerous cilia which they use to generate directed fluid flow. The examples include epithelial cells of the respiratory tract in which multiple cilia are used for mucus clearance, the oviduct, in which cilia help the egg migrate to the uterus, and others.  

Each cilium has a [[basal body]] formed from a centriole to which it is anchored and from which it starts to grow after each cell division, when a new daughter cell is formed. Centrioles typically replicate once during cell division, thus allowing for only one cilium for a daughter cell. Multiciliated cells, on the other hand, need to produce more than 100 centrioles in order to grow multiple cilia.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah A. Klos Dehring (2013). ''Deuterosome-Mediated Centriole Biogenesis.'' Developmental Cell 27, 103–112&lt;/ref&gt; This problem is solved by the existence of deuterosome, a structure thought to be formed from amorphous filamentous material and able to make many centrioles at once.

The evidence of the existence of deuterosome first came from electron microscopy work in various multiciliated tissues. It was found that both centriole duplication and ''de novo'' generation of centrioles occurs in such cells. The generation of new centrioles which will serve as basal bodies for multiple cilia is due to a cytoplasmic structure, which was termed the “deuterosome” by Sorokin.&lt;ref&gt;Eric R. Brooks (2014). ''Multiciliated cells: a review''. Curr Biol. Oct 6; 24(19): R973–R982&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diamond Light Source''' (''"Diamond"'') is the UK's national [[synchrotron]] science facility located at the [[Harwell Science and Innovation Campus]] in [[Oxfordshire]]. Its purpose is to produce [[synchrotron light|intense beams of light]] whose special characteristics are useful in many areas of scientific research. In particular it can be used to investigate the structure and properties of a wide range of materials from [[proteins]] (to provide information for designing new and better drugs), and engineering components (such as a fan blade from an aero-engine&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diamond.ac.uk/Home/Media/LatestNews/02_12_10.html Diamond and Rolls-Royce shine light on world’s biggest synchrotron stage]&lt;/ref&gt;) to conservation of archeological artifacts (for example [[Henry VIII]]'s flagship the [[Mary Rose]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diamond.ac.uk/Home/Media/LatestNews/7February2008.html High-tech conservation solutions for old warship – Diamond Lights Source]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nakeddiscovery.com/downloads/split_individual/09.10.29/Naked_Scientists_Show_09.10.29_4852.mp3 Podcast – Dr Mark Jones from The Mary Rose Trust discusses his research]&lt;/ref&gt;).

== Design, construction and finance ==
[[File:Diamond Light Source building - 3338870 ff7a8854.jpg|thumb|300px|The Diamond Light Source building]]
Following early work during the 1990s, a final design study was completed in 2001 (the so-called '[https://epubs.stfc.ac.uk/work/25071633 Green Book]') by scientists at [[Daresbury Laboratory]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://diamond10.org/timeline/2002-3/] DIAMOND Light Source, 10th Anniversary Blog&lt;/ref&gt; construction then began following the creation of the operating company, DIAMOND Light Source Ltd.

Diamond was built at [[Chilton, Oxfordshire|Chilton]] near [[Didcot]] in [[Oxfordshire]], UK, next to the [[Rutherford Appleton Laboratory]] operated by the [[Science and Technology Facilities Council|Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC)]]. It produced its first user beam towards the end of January 2007, and was formally opened by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] on 19 October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diamond.ac.uk/Home/Media/LatestNews/October2007.html Diamond News: Her Majesty The Queen Officially Opens Diamond Light Source]&lt;/ref&gt;

The facility is operated by Diamond Light Source Ltd,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diamond.ac.uk/Home/About/Company.html Diamond Light Source Ltd] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130707191907/http://www.diamond.ac.uk/Home/About/Company.html |date=2013-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[joint venture]] company established in March 2002. The company receives 86% of its funding from the UK Government (via the STFC) and 14% from the [[Wellcome Trust]]. Diamond cost £260m to build which covered the cost of the synchrotron building, the accelerators inside it, the first seven experimental stations (beamlines) and the adjacent office block, Diamond House. [[Costain Group|Costain Ltd]] constructed the building and the synchrotron hall.
Significant construction achievements to note:

i) The project was completed on time and on budget;

ii) The construction of Diamond was completed with one of the lowest accident rates of a mega project ever completed in the UK. Over 1.4 million [[person-hour]]s were completed during the peak of construction without a single recordable accident.

== The synchrotron ==
Diamond generates [[synchrotron light]] at wavelengths ranging from [[X-rays]] to the [[infrared#Different regions in the infrared|far infrared]]. This is also known as [[synchrotron radiation]] and is the [[electromagnetic radiation]] emitted by charged particles travelling near the [[speed of light]]. It is used in a huge variety of experiments to study the structure and behaviour of many different types of matter.

The particles Diamond uses are [[electron]]s travelling at an energy of 3 [[electronvolt|GeV]] &lt;ref&gt;Equivalent to accelerating them through a voltage of 3 billion Volts; 1 electronvolt is the energy an electron gains when accelerated by a potential difference of 1 Volt.&lt;/ref&gt; round a 561.6 m circumference [[storage ring]]. The ring is not circular, but is shaped as a forty-eight-sided polygon, using a 'double bend achromat' magnet configuration in which two bending magnets are placed in each of 24 cells. As the electrons pass through specially designed magnets at each vertex, their sudden change of direction causes them to emit an exceptionally bright beam of electro-magnetic radiation. This is the synchrotron light used for experiments.

The electrons reach this high energy via a series of pre-accelerator stages before being injected into the 3 GeV storage ring:
* an [[electron gun]] – 90&amp;nbsp;keV
* a 100&amp;nbsp;MeV [[linear accelerator]]
* a 100&amp;nbsp;MeV – 3&amp;nbsp;GeV booster synchrotron (158&amp;nbsp;m in circumference).

The Diamond synchrotron is housed in a silver [[Toroid (geometry)|toroidal]] building of 738m in circumference, covering an area in excess of 43,300 square metres, or the area of over six [[Association football pitch|football pitches]]. This contains the [[storage ring]] and a number of [[beamline]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diamond.ac.uk/Home/Beamlines.html Current list of Diamond Beamlines]&lt;/ref&gt; with the linear accelerator and booster synchrotron housed in the centre of the ring. These beamlines are the experimental stations where the synchrotron light's interaction with matter is used for research purposes.  Seven (Phase I) beamlines were available when Diamond became operational in 2007, with  another fifteen (Phase II) completed over the period 2007–2012. As of January 2013 there were 22 in operation. The Government and the Wellcome Trust have now agreed to fund Phase III of Diamond which will increase the number of operational beamlines to 32 by 2017.

The seven beamlines which were available when Diamond first became operational in January 2007 were:
* extreme conditions beamline for studying materials under intense temperatures and pressures (Beamline I15).
* materials and magnetism beamline, set up to probe electronic and magnetic materials at the atomic level (Beamline I16).
* three [[macromolecule|macromolecular]] [[crystallography]] beamlines, for decoding the structure of complex biological samples, such as [[protein]]s (Beamlines I02, I03 and I04).
* microfocus spectroscopy beamline, able to map the chemical make up of complex materials such as [[moon rocks]] and geological samples (Beamline I18).
* [[nanoscience]] beamline, capable of imaging structures and devices at the scale of a few nanometres (millionths of a millimetre) (Beamline I06).

Phase III of Diamond provides for the design, procurement, construction and commissioning of an additional 10 beamlines to complement those in Phases I and II of Diamond. They will become operational over the period 2013–2017/18.

Diamond is intended ultimately to host up to ~ forty beamlines, supporting the life, physical and environmental sciences.

In 2015, Diamond began the electron Bio-Imaging Centre (eBIC), a UK national facility providing instruments and expertise in the field of [[cryo-electron microscopy]]. Initially, one FEI Titan Krios microscope I was housed in the experimental hall at Diamond. In September 2018, Dr. [[Richard Henderson (biologist)]], the 2017 Nobel Laureate in Chemistry, officially opened eBICs own dedicated facility. Housing four dedicated FEI cryo-electron microscopes for academia as well as two new cryo-electron microscopes and professional cryo-EM services designed exclusively for the pharmaceutical industry.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.selectscience.net/editorial-articles/nobel-prize-winner-in-chemistry-talks-cryo-em-and-its-impact-on-drug?artID=47351&lt;/ref&gt;  Experimental techniques available at this facility include single particle analysis of biological macromolecules, cellular tomography and electron crystallography.

== Case studies ==
* On 13 September 2007, scientists from [[Cardiff University]], led by Professor Tim Wess, found that the Diamond synchrotron could be used to discover hidden content of ancient documents by [[Lighting|illumination]] without opening them (penetrating layers of [[parchment]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6991893.stm  BBC NEWS, 'Super-scope' to see hidden texts]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diamond.ac.uk/Home/Beamlines/small-angle/Case-Studies/casestudy3.html Diamond: Unravelling the secrets of ancient parchments]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In November 2010 the Journal [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] published an article detailing how scientists Goedele Maertens, Stephen Hare &amp; Peter Cherepanov from [[Imperial College London]] used data collected at Diamond to advance the understanding of how HIV and other retroviruses infect human or animal cells.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diamond.ac.uk/Home/Media/LatestNews/10_11_10.html Diamond News: X-rays illuminate the mechanism used by HIV to attack human DNA]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v468/n7321/full/nature09517.html Nature Article: The mechanism of retroviral integration from X-ray structures of its key intermediates]&lt;/ref&gt; The findings may enable improvements in gene therapy to correct gene malfunctions.
* In June 2011 an international team of scientists led by Professor So Iwata published an article in the Journal Nature detailing how using Diamond they had successfully solved the complex 3D structure of the human [[Histamine H1 receptor]] protein.

== Background ==
Diamond is a UK National Facility that aims at providing researchers from the UK and the world with synchrotron-based techniques for a wide range of scientific applications.

The name DIAMOND was originally conceived by Mike Poole (the originator of the DIAMOND project) and stood as an acronym meaning '''DI'''pole '''A'''nd '''M'''ultipole '''O'''utput for the '''N'''ation at [[Daresbury Laboratory|'''D'''aresbury]].  With the location of Diamond now being in Oxfordshire, the explanation has been changed, and now derives from that the fact that the light from the synchrotron is both 'hard' (referring to the "hard" X-ray region of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]) and bright, and hence the current name "Diamond" was born).&lt;ref&gt;Private Communications with Prof [[Gerhard Materlik|Gerd Materlik]], CEO of Diamond, and with Mike Poole&lt;/ref&gt;

Diamond is located on the [[Science and Technology Facilities Council|STFC]] [[Rutherford Appleton Laboratory]] site, near to the [[ISIS neutron source|ISIS Neutron and Muon Source]], the Central Laser Facility, and the nearby laboratories at Harwell and Culham (including the [[Joint European Torus]] (JET) project). Diamond was originally due to replace the second-generation synchrotron at Daresbury in Cheshire, however, it was decided to locate the new British synchrotron in Oxfordshire.

The Diamond synchrotron is the largest UK-funded scientific facility to be built in the UK for over 45 years, since the Nimrod proton synchrotron which was sited at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. In 1977 financial approval was given to convert the Nimrod facility into the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) named [[ISIS neutron source|ISIS]].

There are approximately 70&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lightsources.org/cms/?pid=1000098 ''Lightsources.org'': List of world Synchrotron (Light Source) Facilities]&lt;/ref&gt; ''dedicated'' synchrotron facilities in the world, and Diamond (3&amp;nbsp;GeV) is the world's largest ''medium energy'' synchrotron. Only four dedicated synchrotron facilities in the world are currently larger than Diamond, and all are ''high energy'' machines. These are: i) [[SPring-8]] in Japan (8&amp;nbsp;GeV); ii) The [[European Synchrotron Radiation Facility]] in Grenoble, France (6.03&amp;nbsp;GeV); iii) The [[Advanced Photon Source]] (APS) in Chicago, USA (7&amp;nbsp;GeV); iv) [[DESY]]'s PETRA III (6&amp;nbsp;GeV) in Germany, which is currently the world's largest dedicated synchrotron source.

'''EQOS Energie''' is a corporate group, based in [[Foetz]], [[Luxembourg]]. The company has more than 30 branches in eight countries. EQOS Energie specialises in railway and energy technology, overhead lines, communication technology and technical building services.

Until August 2014, the company operated under the name ALPINE-ENERGIE.&lt;ref name="new owner"&gt;[http://www.triton-partners.com/media/archive/triton-new-owner-of-alpine-energie/ „Triton new owner of ALPINE-ENERGIE“], Press release from Triton. Retrieved November 24, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  EQOS is an [[acronym]] that stands for '''Excellent Quality Of Services''', and represents the brand promise.&lt;ref name="EQOS DE"&gt;[http://www.eqos-energie.com/en/company/germany „EQOS Energie in Germany“], EQOS Energie. Retrieved November 24, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
EQOS Energie is owned by the European investment company Triton.

== History ==
Founded as "ENERGIE-Gesellschaft für elektrische und industrielle Unternehmungen mbH" in [[Stuttgart]] by Wilhelm Blättchen in 1920, EQOS Energie has a nearly hundred-year-old company history.&lt;ref name="„Hist“"&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=64784199 „Construction and Engineering: Company Overview of EQOS Energie Holding S.à r.l.“], Bloomberg. Retrieved November 25, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Back then, the business segment was constituted by electrical and industrial enterprises.
In 1978, the subsidiary "ENERGIE Lignes Hautes Tension" was founded in [[Luxembourg]]. 15 years later, the first working group (ARGE) combined their operations with the Austrian “ALPINE Bau GmbH" in a joint venture. In connection with ARGE, a 380-kV forwarding line was set up for the Austrian composite company as were the first steel towers for mobile radio networks. This resulted in the foundation of "ALPINE-ENERGIE Gesellschaft für elektrische und industrielle Unternehmungen GmbH", which is headquartered in [[Linz]], [[Austria]]. Due to the foundation of "ENERGIE-Gesellschaft für Leitungsbau und Kommunikationstechnik AG" in [[Berne]], the company expanded its business into [[Switzerland]]. Entry into the rail sector was marked by "ALPINE ENERGIE’s" launch in the catenary building sector at the Austrian [[St. Valentin]] main railway station in 1999. As a result, the catenary lines there were modernised. Three years later, the ALPINE Group took over the shares owned by Blättchen. While founding the "ALPINE-ENERGIE Holding AG" and "ALPINE-ENERGIE Deutschland GmbH", the business expanded and the company grew quickly.

In 2006, the Spanish building group [[Fomento de Construcciones y Contratas|Fomento de Construcciones y Contratas (FCC)]] became majority shareholder of the ALPINE Group. In the same year, "SAG Kommunikationstechnik" was taken over. Through its acquisition of "SAG Kommunikationstechnik", the company extended its business in Switzerland and Austria. Between 2009 and 2011, "ALPINE-ENERGIE" companies were founded in [[Poland]], the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Hungary]].&lt;ref name="„Hist“"/&gt;

In 2013, the FCC assumed ownership of ALPINE-ENERGIE, which became a subsidiary of FCC. Subsequently, the company was taken over by [[Triton Fonds]] in 2014.&lt;ref name="new owner"/&gt; Since then, the long-established group member has conducted its business under the name of '''EQOS Energie'''.&lt;ref name="new owner"/&gt; Following the turnaround, as one of the industry’s foremost suppliers, the company realigned its business model in 2015 to address growing market requirements. In a management buy-out, EQOS Energie retired in 2016 from the Swiss market and focused in all service areas on its eight core markets: [[Germany]], Austria, Luxembourg, [[France]], [[Belgium]], Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary.

== Business Sector ==
EQOS Energie provides its customers with a wide range of solutions in five business sectors: railway and energy technology, overhead lines, communication technology and technical building services. Its range of activities include consulting, planning and construction as well as maintenance and optimisation. In addition to complete projects the company also offers individual services for various project stages.

Concerning railway technology, EQOS Energie is specialised in the construction of catenary lines, signalling technology and technical equipment in the local and long-distance transport sector. 
The construction of switchgear and substations is the key expertise of the energy technology division. In the production and manufacturing processes, EQOS Energie plans, delivers, installs and maintains all technical facilities. Also, the company offers solutions in the areas of transport and lighting technology in Austria. Given changes in energy policy, EQOS Energie has taken over new construction and increased high-voltage network construction.&lt;ref name="EQOS DE" /&gt; As a nationwide full-service provider, EQOS Energie plans, constructs and maintains mobile communications and fixed networks.
EQOS Energie focuses on technical equipment for buildings and the public sector in Poland and the Czech Republic. The spectrum of services extends from acquisition and construction to maintenance, modernisation and repair of commercial real estate and industrial plants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finyear.com/Dr-Helmut-Steurer-is-new-CFO-of-EQOS-Energie-Holding_a36204.html "The Management Board of EQOS Energie now consists of Eric Mendel and Dr. Helmut Steurer"], financial and innovation all the year.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7575">'''Ecological death''' is the inability of an organism to function in an ecological context, leading to death.&lt;ref name="scott"&gt;Scott, G.R., and K.A. Sloman.  2004.  The effects of environmental pollutants on complex fish behavior: integrating behavioural and physiological indicators of toxicity.  Aquatic Toxicology 68:369-392.&lt;/ref&gt;  This term can be used in many fields of biology to describe any species.  In the context of [[aquatic toxicology]], a toxic chemical, or [[toxicant]], directly affects an aquatic organism but does not immediately kill it; instead it impairs an organism’s normal ecological functions which then lead to death or lack of offspring.  The toxicant makes the organism unable to function ecologically in some way, even though it does not suffer obviously from the toxicant.&lt;ref name="scott"/&gt;  Ecological death may be caused by sublethal toxicological effects that can be [[behavior]]al, [[physiology|physiological]], [[biochemistry|biochemical]], or [[histology|histological]].&lt;ref name="rand"&gt;Rand, G.M. (Ed). Fundamentals of Aquatic Toxicology: Effects, Environmental Fate, and Risk Assessment.  2nd Ed.  Florida: CRC Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of sublethal effects causing ecological death ==

Sublethal effects consist of any effects of an organism caused by a [[toxicant]] that do not include death.  These effects are generally not observed well in a shorter [[acute toxicity]] test.&lt;ref name="rand"/&gt;  A longer, [[chronic toxicity]] test will allow enough time for these effects to appear in an organism and for them to lead to ecological death.&lt;ref name="rand"/&gt;

=== Behavioral effects ===

[[Toxicant]]s can affect an organism’s behavior, which with aquatic organisms, may impact their ability to swim, feed or avoid predators.&lt;ref name="rand"/&gt;  The impacted behavior can lead to an organism’s death because it may starve or get eaten by predators.&lt;ref name="rand"/&gt;  Toxicants may affect behavior by impacting the sensory systems which organisms depend on to collect information about their environment or by impacting an organism’s motivation to properly respond to [[sensory cue]]s.&lt;ref name="scott"/&gt;  If an organism is unable to use sensory cues effectively, they may be unable to respond to early warning signs of predation risk.&lt;ref name="scott"/&gt;  Toxicants can also affect later stages of predation by impacting an organism’s ability to respond to predators or follow through with escape strategies.&lt;ref name="scott"/&gt;

=== Physiological effects ===

[[Toxicant]]s can affect an organism’s physiology which may impact its growth, reproduction, and/or development.&lt;ref name="rand"/&gt;  If an organism does not grow correctly and is undersize or has growth defects, it will be more likely to be eaten by predators.  If an organism’s reproduction is impaired, it may not directly die, but it will be unable to pass on its genes to the population.  The organism will no longer be representative in the population’s [[gene pool]].

=== Biochemical Effects ===

[[Toxicant]]s can alter the enzymes or ions present in an organism.&lt;ref name="rand"/&gt;  If this alteration does not directly cause death, but impacts the behavior or physiology of the organism, it can also lead to ecological death.

=== Histological effects ===

[[Toxicant]]s can alter an organism’s tissues.&lt;ref name="rand"/&gt;  If this alteration does not directly cause death, but impacts the behavior or physiology of the organism, it can also lead to ecological death.

== Toxicant examples leading to ecological death ==

=== DDT ===

An effect caused by [[DDT]] is shell thinning in bird eggs, leading to the death of the chick.  Once DDT has been accumulated by an adult bird, it is metabolized into the form [[Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene|DDE]] which is both stable and toxic.&lt;ref name="US"&gt;U.S. Dept. of Interior, National Biological Service. “Environmental Contaminants”.  Status and Trends of the Nation’s Biological Resources. Dept. of Interior, National Biological Service: Washington, DC. 1998. &lt;http://www.nwrc.usgs.gov/sandt/&gt; 15 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  Once in the form of DDE, the chemical impacts the metabolism of calcium in adult female birds’ shell glands, ultimately causing a decrease in eggshell thickness.&lt;ref name="US"/&gt;  At high concentrations of DDT, the eggshells will no longer be able to support the incubating parents’ weight and will lead to the death of the unborn chick.&lt;ref name="US"/&gt;  This is an example of physiological and biochemical sublethal effects leading to ecological death of the chick.

=== Diazinon ===

An effect caused by [[diazinon]] is a decrease in response to predator cues in [[Chinook salmon]] (''Oncorhynchus tshawytscha'').  Diazinon, an organopesticide, was exposed to juvenile Chinook salmon for two hours at 1 and 10 μg/L, and these concentrations were enough to eliminate the behavioral responses of the fish to predator chemical cues.&lt;ref name="scholz"&gt;Scholz, N.L., Truelove, N.K., French, B.L., Berejikian, B.A., Quinn, T.P., Casillas, E., Collier, T.K. 2000. Diazinon disrupts antipredator and homing behaviors in Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytschaI). Can. J. Fish. Aquat. Sci. 57: 1911-1918.&lt;/ref&gt;  If the fish cannot recognize that a predator is nearby, it is likely to be eaten.  This is an example of a behavioral sublethal effect leading to ecological death.

=== Pentachlorophenol ===

An effect caused by [[pentachlorophenol]] is a decrease in response to predator attacks in [[guppy|guppies]] (''Poecilia reticula'').  Pentachlorophenol was exposed to juvenile guppies at 500 and 700 μg/L, and both concentrations decreased the guppies’ reactions to predators.&lt;ref name="brown"&gt;Brown, J.A., Johansen, P.H., Colgan, P.W., Mathers, R.A.  1985.  Changes in the predator-avoidance behavior of juvenile guppies (Poecilia reticulata) exposed to pentachlorophenol.  Can. J. Zool. 63: 2001-2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  The predators did not have to strike as frequently, did not have to pursue as frequently, or have to pursue the guppies as long as guppies that had not been exposed to these levels of pentachlorophenol.&lt;ref name="brown"/&gt;    The guppies that were exposed to this chemical were more likely to be eaten due to their slower responses.  This is another example of a behavioral sublethal effect that leads to ecological death.

=== Copper ===

An effect caused by [[copper]] is impacting the [[salmon]] [[olfactory system]].  The olfactory system is used to gather important information about one’s environment.  In the case of salmon, olfactory cues can gather information about habitat quality, predators, mates and more.&lt;ref name="baldwin"&gt;Baldwin, D.H., Sandahl, J.F., Labenia, J.S., Scholz, N.L. 2003.  Sublethal effects of copper on Coho Salmon: Impacts on nonoverlapping receptor pathways in the peripheral olfactory nervous system.  Environ. Tox. and Chem. 22(10):2266-2274.&lt;/ref&gt;  Salmon can detect distinct copper gradients using their olfactory system, and use this information to avoid [[contamination|contaminated]] waters.&lt;ref name="baldwin"/&gt; However, when salmon are affected by copper, the olfactory system can be impacted in a matter of minutes.&lt;ref name="baldwin"/&gt;  If the fish is no longer able to gather environmental information, it may be at risk for predation or unable to find resources for survival.  This is an example of a physiological sublethal effect leading to ecological death.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8426">[[File:Ecological Pyramid.svg|thumb|An energy pyramid is a presentation of the trophic levels in an ecosystem. Energy from the sun is transferred through the ecosystem by passing through various trophic levels. Roughly 10% of the energy is transferred from one trophic level to the next, thus preventing a large number of trophic levels. There must be higher amounts of biomass at the bottom of the pyramid to support the energy and biomass requirements of the higher trophic levels.]]
An '''ecological pyramid''' (also '''trophic pyramid''', '''eltonian pyramid''', '''energy pyramid''', or sometimes '''food pyramid''') is a graphical representation designed to show the [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] or [[Primary production|bio productivity]] at each [[trophic level]] in a given [[ecosystem]].

''Biomass pyramids'' show how much biomass (the amount of living or organic matter present in an organism) is present in the organisms at each trophic level, while ''productivity pyramids'' show the procreation or turnover in biomass. There is also ''pyramid of numbers'' which represent the number of organisms in each trophic level. They may be upright (e.g. Grassland ecosystem), inverted (parasitic ecosystem) or dumbbell shaped (forest ecosystem).

Energy pyramids begin with [[autotroph|producers]] on the bottom (such as plants) and proceed through the various trophic levels (such as herbivores that eat plants, then carnivores that eat flesh, then omnivores that eat both plants and flesh, and so on).  The highest level is the [[Apex predator|top]] of the [[food chain]].

==History==
The concept of pyramid of numbers ("Eltonian pyramid") was developed by [[Charles Sutherland Elton|Charles Elton]] (1927).&lt;ref&gt;Elton, C. 1927. ''Animal Ecology''. New York, Macmillan Co. [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/7435#/summary link].&lt;/ref&gt; Later, it would also be expressed in terms of biomass by [[Shimon Fritz Bodenheimer|Bodenheimer]] (1938).&lt;ref&gt;Bodenheimer, F. S. 1938. ''Problems of Animal Ecology''. Oxford University Press. [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.218303 link].&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of pyramid of productivity or energy relies on works of [[G. Evelyn Hutchinson]] and [[Raymond Lindeman]] (1942).&lt;ref name="lindeman_1942"&gt;Lindeman, R. L. (1942). The trophic-dynamic aspect of ecology. ''Ecology'' 23: 399–418. [http://www.fcnym.unlp.edu.ar/catedras/ecocomunidades/Lindman_1942.pdf link].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trebilco, R., Baum, J.K., Salomon, A.K., Dulvy, N.K. 2013. Ecosystem ecology: size-based constraints on the pyramids of life. ''Trends Ecol. Evol.'' 28, 423–431. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267279432_Understanding_Eltonian_biomass_pyramids_with_size-based_ecological_theory#pf8 link].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pyramid of numbers==
[[File:Numbers Pyramid.svg|thumb|A numbers pyramid shows the relevant number of organisms that each trophic level occupies in an ecosystem. Often, there are more producers than consumers, however, it can also be seen in many ecosystems that there are more primary consumers than producers.]]

A "pyramid of numbers" shows graphically the population of each level in a food chain. It is an upright pyramid given in an ecosystem, where usually the producers are more in number than any other [[Trophic level]]. This shows the number of organisms in each trophic level without any consideration for their size. This type of pyramid can be convenient, as counting is often a simple task and can be done over the years to observe the changes in a particular ecosystem. However, some types of organisms are difficult to count, especially when it comes to some juvenile forms. Unit: number of organisms.

==Pyramid of biomass== 
[[File:Biomass Pyramid.svg|thumb|A biomass pyramid shows the total mass of the organisms that each trophic level occupies in an ecosystem. Usually, producers have a higher biomass than any other trophic level, but there can be lower amounts of biomass at the bottom of the pyramid if the rate of primary production per unit biomass is very fast.]]

A "pyramid of biomass" shows the relationship between biomass and trophic level by quantifying the biomass present at each trophic level of an [[biocoenosis|energy community]] at a particular time. It is a graphical representation of biomass (total amount of living or organic matter in an ecosystem) present in unit area in different tropic levels. Typical units are grams per meter&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, or calories per meter&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
The pyramid of biomass may be "inverted". For example, in a pond ecosystem, the [[standing crop]] of [[phytoplankton]], the major [[autotrophs|producers]], at any given point will be lower than the mass of the [[heterotrophs]], such as fish and insects. This is explained as the phytoplankton [[reproduce]] very quickly, but have much shorter individual lives.

One problem with biomass pyramids is that they can make a trophic level appear to contain more [[energy]] than it actually does. For example, all [[birds]] have [[beak]]s and [[skeleton]]s, which despite having [[mass]] are not typically digested by the next trophic level.

==Pyramid of Energy==
A "pyramid of productivity" is often more useful, showing the production or turnover (the rate at which energy or mass is transferred from one trophic level to the next) of biomass at each trophic level. Instead of showing a single snapshot in time, [[primary production|productivity]] pyramids show the flow of [[energy]] through the [[food chain]]. Typical units are grams per meter&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; per year or calories per meter&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; per year. As with the others, this graph shows producers at the bottom and higher trophic levels on top.

When an ecosystem is healthy, this graph produces a standard ''ecological pyramid''. This is because in order for the ecosystem to sustain itself, there must be more energy at lower trophic levels than there is at higher trophic levels. This allows organisms on the lower levels to not only to maintain a stable population, but also to transfer energy up the pyramid. The exception to this generalization is when portions of a [[food web]] are supported by inputs of resources from outside the local [[biocoenosis|community]]. In small, forested streams, for example, the volume of higher levels is greater than could be supported by the local [[primary production]].

When energy is transferred to the next trophic level, typically only 10% or 12% of it is used to build new biomass, becoming stored energy (the rest going to metabolic processes) (Pauly and Christensen, 1995). In this case, in the ''pyramid of productivity'' each step will be 10% the size of the previous step (100,000, 10,000, 1,000, 100, 10, 1, .1, .01).

The advantages of the ''pyramid of productivity'' as a representation:
* It takes account of the rate of production over a period of time.
* Two species of comparable biomass may have very different [[life expectancy|life spans]]. Thus a direct comparison of their total biomasses is misleading, but their productivity is directly comparable.
* The relative energy chain within an ecosystem can be compared using pyramids of energy; also different [[ecosystems]] can be compared.
* There are no inverted pyramids.
* The input of solar energy can be added.

The disadvantages of the ''pyramid of productivity'' as a representation:
* The rate of biomass production of an organism is required, which involves measuring growth and reproduction through time.
* There is still the difficulty of assigning the organisms to a specific trophic level. As well as the organisms in the [[food chain]]s there is the problem of assigning the [[decomposers]] and [[detritivore]]s to a particular trophic level.

Nonetheless, [[productivity]] pyramids usually provide more insight into an [[biocoenosis|ecological community]] when the necessary information is available.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15014">'''Failure analysis''' is the process of collecting and analyzing data to determine the cause of a [[failure]], often with the goal of determining corrective actions or liability.
According to Bloch and Geitner, machinery failures reveal a reaction chain of cause and effect… usually a deficiency commonly referred to as the symptom…”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Machinery Failure Analysis and Troubleshooting|last=Bloch|first=Heinz|last2=Geitner|first2=Fred|publisher=Gulf Publishing Company|year=1994|isbn=0-87201-232-8|location=Houston, Texas|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; failure analysis can save money, lives, and resources if done correctly and acted upon. It is an important discipline in many branches of manufacturing industry, such as the electronics industry, where it is a vital tool used in the development of new products and for the improvement of existing products. The failure analysis process relies on collecting failed components for subsequent examination of the cause or causes of failure using a wide array of methods, especially [[microscopy]] and [[spectroscopy]]. [[Nondestructive testing]] (NDT) methods (such as [[industrial computed tomography scanning]]) are valuable because the failed products are unaffected by analysis, so inspection sometimes starts using these methods. 

==Forensic investigation==
[[Forensic]] inquiry into the failed process or product is the starting point of failure analysis. Such inquiry is conducted using scientific analytical methods such as electrical and mechanical measurements, or by analyzing failure data such as product reject reports or examples of previous failures of the same kind. The methods of [[forensic engineering]] are especially valuable in tracing product defects and flaws. They may include [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]] cracks, [[brittle]] cracks produced by [[stress corrosion cracking]] or [[environmental stress cracking]] for example. Witness statements can be valuable for reconstructing the likely sequence of events and hence the chain of cause and effect. Human factors can also be assessed when the cause of the failure is determined. There are several useful methods to prevent product failures occurring in the first place, including [[Failure mode and effects analysis|failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA)]] and [[Fault tree analysis|fault tree analysis (FTA)]], methods which can be used during [[prototyping]] to analyze failures before a product is marketed.

Failure theories can only be constructed on such data, but when corrective action is needed quickly, the [[precautionary principle]] demands that measures be put in place. In aircraft accidents for example, all planes of the type involved can be grounded immediately pending the outcome of the inquiry.

Several of the techniques used in failure analysis are also used in the analysis of [[No fault found|no fault found (NFF)]] which is a term used in the field of maintenance to describe a situation where an originally reported mode of failure can't be duplicated by the evaluating technician and therefore the potential defect can't be fixed.

NFF can be attributed to oxidation, defective connections of electrical components, temporary shorts or opens in the circuits, software bugs, temporary environmental factors, but also to the operator error. A large number of devices that are reported as NFF during the first troubleshooting session often return to the failure analysis lab with the same NFF symptoms or a permanent mode of failure.

The term failure analysis also applies to other fields such as business management and military strategy.

==Failure analysis engineers==
A failure analysis engineer often plays a lead role in the analysis of failures, whether a component or product fails in service or if failure occurs in manufacturing or during production processing. In any case, one must determine the cause of failure to prevent future occurrence, and/or to improve the performance of the device, component or structure. Structural Engineers and Mechanical Engineers are very common for the job. More specific majors can also get into the position such as materials engineers. Specializing in metallurgy and chemistry is always useful along with properties and strengths of materials. Someone could be hired for different reasons, whether it be to further prevent or liability issues. The median salary of a failure analysis engineer, an engineer with experience in the field, is $81,647.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Failure_Analysis_Engineer/Salary|title=Failure Analysis Engineer Salary|last=|first=|date=|website=PayScale|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A failure analysis engineer requires a good amount of communication and ability to work with others. Usually, the person hired, has a bachelors in engineering but there are certifications that can be acquired.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Case Studies ==

=== Two Shear Key Rods failed on the Bay Bridge ===

==== People on the Case ====
Mr. Brahimi is an American Bridge Fluor consultant and has a Masters in materials engineering.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brahimi|first=Salim|last2=Agiular|first2=Rosme|last3=Christensen|first3=Conrad|date=7 May 2013|title=Shear Key Rod Failure Analysis Report|url=http://www.baybridgeinfo.org/sites/default/files/pdf/Appendix%20H_E2%20Shear%20Key%20Rod%20Failure%20Fracture%20Analysis%20Report_1.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=Bay Bridge Info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mr. Aguilar is the Branch Chief for Caltrans Structural Materials Testing Branch with 30 years’ experience as an engineer.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Mr. Christensen who is a Caltrans consultant with 32 years of experience with metallurgy and failure analysis.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Steps ====
'''Visual Observation''' which is non-destructive examination. This revealed sign of brittleness with no permanent plastic deformation before it broke. Cracks were shown which were the final breaking point of the shear key rods. The engineers suspected hydrogen was involved in producing the cracks.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Scanning Electron Microscopy''' which is the scanning of the cracked surfaces under high magnification to get a better understanding of the fracture. The full fracture happened after the rod couldn’t hold under load when the crack reached a critical size.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Micro Structural Examination''' where cross-sections were examined to reveal more information about interworking bonds of the metal.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Hardness Testing''' using two strategies, the Rockwell C Hardness and the Knoop Microhardness which reveals that it was not heat treated correctly.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Tensile Test''' tells the engineer the yield strength, tensile strength, and elongation was sufficient to pass the requirements. Multiple pieces were taken and performed by Anamet Inc.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Charpy V-Notch Impact Test''' shows the toughness of the steel by taking different samples of the rod and done by Anamet Inc.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Chemical Analysis''' was the Final Test also done by Anamet Inc. which met the requirements for that steel.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Conclusion of the Case Study ====
The rods failed from hydrogen embrittlement which was susceptible to the hydrogen from the high tensile load and the hydrogen already in the material. The rods did not fail because they did not meet the requirements for strength in these rods. While they met requirements, the structure was inhomogeneous which caused different strengths and low toughness.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

This study shows a couple of the many ways failure analysis can be done. It always starts with a nondestructive form of observation, like a crime scene. Then pieces of the material are taken from the original piece which are used in different observations. Then destructive testing is done to find toughness and properties of the material to find exactly what went wrong.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Failure of failure analysis ===
The collapse of the Oakland Nimitz Freeway was a bridge that collapsed during an earthquake even after the program to strengthen the bridge. Different engineers were asked on their take on the situation. While some don’t blame the program or the department, like James Rogers who said that the earthquake could have “a good chance the Embarcadero would do the same thing the Nimitz did.”&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/21/us/experts-ask-if-anti-quake-steps-contributed-to-highway-collapse.html|title=Experts Ask if Anti-Quake Steps Contributed to Highway Collapse|last=Bishop|first=Katherine|date=1989|website=NY Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some said more prevention could’ve been done. Dr. Priestly says that “neither of the department’s projects to strengthen roadways addressed the problems of weakness…” in the bridges joints. Some experts agreed that more could’ve been done to prevent this disaster. The program is under fire for making “the failure more serious”.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== From a design engineer's POV ===
[[File:F101 - T-9 Jet Engine Test Cell.ogv|thumb|Jet Engine Test Cell&lt;ref&gt;''T-9 Jet Engine Test Cell.'' Dir. Timothy Kirchner. ''Defense Visual Information Distribution Services''. DVIDS, 12 Aug. 2013. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A product needs to be able to work even in the hardest of scenarios. This is very important on products made for expensive builds such as buildings or aircraft. If these parts fail, they can cause serious damage and/or safety problems. A product starts to be designed "...to minimize the hazards associated with this "worst case scenario." Discerning the worst case scenario requires a complete understanding of the product, its loading and its service environment. Prior to the product entering service, a prototype will often undergo laboratory testing which proves the product withstands the worst case scenario as expected."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brady|first=Brian|date=1999|title=Failure Analysis|url=http://www.matscieng.sunysb.edu/disaster/fail-anal/|journal=|publisher=Department of Material Science and Engineering|publication-place=State University of New York at Stony Brook|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the tests done on jet engines today are very intensive checking if the engine can withstand:

* ingestion of debris, dust, sand, etc.;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.klm.com/how-do-we-test-jet-engines/|title=How do we Test Jet Engines?|last=Duivis|first=Rob|date=7 March 2016|website=Meanwhile at KLM|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ingestion of hail, snow, ice, etc.;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* ingestion of excessive amounts of water.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

These tests must be harder than what the product will experience in use. The engines are pushed to the max in order to ensure that the product will function the way it should no matter the condition. Failure analysis on both sides is about the prevention of damage and maintaining safety.

A special case is a [[mathematical fallacy]], an intentionally invalid [[mathematical]] [[mathematical proof|proof]], often with the error subtle and somehow concealed. Mathematical fallacies are typically crafted and exhibited for educational purposes, usually taking the form of spurious proofs of obvious [[contradiction]]s.

==Overview==
Fallacies are defects that weaken arguments. Fallacious arguments are very common and can be persuasive in common use. They may be even "unsubstantiated assertions that are often delivered with a conviction that makes them sound as though they are proven facts".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title = The new handbook of cognitive therapy techniques |last = McMullin |first = Rian E. |date = 2000 |publisher = W. W. Norton |isbn = 978-0393703139 |edition = [Rev. ed.] |location = New York |oclc = 41580357 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Informal fallacies in particular are found frequently in mass media such as television and newspapers.&lt;ref name="McMurty1990"&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = McMurtry |first1 = John |title = The mass media: An analysis of their system of fallacy |journal = Interchange |date = December 1990 |volume = 21 |issue = 4 |pages = 49–66 |doi = 10.1007/BF01810092 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to understand what fallacies are so that one can recognize them in either one's own or others' writing. Avoiding fallacies will strengthen one's ability to produce strong arguments.

It can be difficult to evaluate whether an argument is fallacious, as arguments exist along a continuum of [[soundness]] and an argument that has several stages or parts might have some sound sections and some fallacious ones.&lt;ref name="DeLancey_Handout"&gt;{{cite web |last1 = DeLancey |first1 = Craig, Ph.D. |title = Evaluating Arguments—Distinguishing between reasonable and fallacious tactics |url = https://writingcenter.ua.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/evaluatingarguments.pdf |website = oswego.edu |publisher = self-published |accessdate = 7 March 2018 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130903171329/http://writingcenter.ua.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/evaluatingarguments.pdf |archive-date = 2013-09-03 |dead-url = yes |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Fallacious arguments usually have the deceptive appearance of being good arguments."{{refn|1={{named ref|name=Damer 2009}} [https://books.google.cz/books?id=-qZabUx0FmkC&amp;pg=PA52 page&amp;nbsp;52].}} Recognizing fallacies in everyday arguments may be difficult since arguments are often embedded in [[rhetoric]]al patterns that obscure the logical connections between statements. Informal fallacies may also exploit the [[emotion]]al, intellectual, or [[psychology|psychological]] weaknesses of the audience. Recognizing fallacies can develop reasoning skills to expose the weaker links between premises and conclusions to better discern between what appears to be true and what is true.

[[Argumentation theory]] provides a different approach to understanding and classifying fallacies. In this approach, an argument is regarded as an interactive protocol between individuals that attempts to resolve their disagreements. The protocol is regulated by certain rules of interaction, so violations of these rules are fallacies.

Fallacies are used in place of valid reasoning to communicate a point with the intention to persuade. Examples in the [[mass media]] today include but are not limited to [[propaganda]], [[advertisement]]s, [[politics]], newspaper editorials and opinion-based “news” shows.

==&lt;span id="Material fallacy"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Systems of classification==
Because of their variety of structure and application, fallacies are challenging to classify so as to satisfy all practitioners. Fallacies can be classified strictly by either their structure or their content, such as classifying them as [[Formal fallacy|formal fallacies]] or [[Informal fallacy|informal fallacies]], respectively. The classification of informal fallacies may be subdivided into categories such as linguistic, relevance through omission, relevance through intrusion, and relevance through presumption.&lt;ref name="Pirie2006"&gt;{{cite book |last = Pirie |first = Madsen |authorlink = Madsen Pirie |title = How to Win Every Argument: The Use and Abuse of Logic |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Gh5UjNNc0v4C&amp;pg=PA46 |accessdate = 10 September 2015 |year = 2006 |publisher = A&amp;C Black |isbn = 978-0-8264-9006-3 |page = 46 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, fallacies may be classified by the process by which they occur, such as [[Material fallacy|material fallacies]] (content), [[Verbal fallacy|verbal fallacies]] (linguistic), and again formal fallacies (error in inference). In turn, material fallacies may be placed into the more general category of informal fallacies. Yet, verbal fallacies may be placed in either formal or informal classifications; compare [[equivocation]] which is a word or phrase based [[ambiguity]], e. g. "he is mad", which may refer to either him being angry or clinically insane, to the [[fallacy of composition]] which is premise and inference based ambiguity, e. g. "this must be a good basketball team because each of its members is an outstanding player".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = fallacy |url = https://www.britannica.com/topic/fallacy#toc280530 |website = Encyclopedia Brittanica |publisher = Encyclopedia Brittanica |accessdate = 13 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even the definitions of the classes may not be unique. For example, [[#Whately's grouping|Whately]] treats material fallacies as a complement to logical fallacies, which makes them synonymous to informal fallacies, while others consider them to be a subclass of informal fallacies, like mentioned above.

===&lt;span id="Verbal fallacy"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Aristotle===
[[Aristotle]] was the first to systematize logical errors into a list, as being able to refute an opponent's thesis is one way of winning an argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Frans |first1 = van Eemeren |last2 = Bart |first2 = Garssen |last3 = Bert |first3 = Meuffels |title = Fallacies and judgements of reasonableness, Empirical Research Concerning the Pragma-Dialectical Discussion Rules |date = 2009 |publisher = Springer Science+Business Media B.V. |location = Dordrecht |isbn = 978-90-481-2613-2 |page = 2 |language = English |chapter = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle's "[[Sophistical Refutations]]" (''De Sophisticis Elenchis'') identifies thirteen fallacies. He divided them up into two major types, linguistic fallacies and non-linguistic fallacies, some depending on language and others that do not depend on language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://thenonsequitur.com/?page_id=621 |title = Aristotle's original 13 fallacies |publisher = The Non Sequitur |accessdate = 2013-05-28 |date = 2008-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.logiclaw.co.uk/fallacies/Straker3.html |title = Aristotle's 13 fallacies |website = www.logiclaw.co.uk |access-date = 2017-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These fallacies are called verbal fallacies and material fallacies, respectively. A [[material fallacy]] is an error in what the arguer is talking about, while a [[verbal fallacy]] is an error in how the arguer is talking. Verbal fallacies are those in which a conclusion is obtained by improper or ambiguous use of words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://aristotle.tamu.edu/~rasmith/Courses/PhilosophicalWriting/08a/fallacies.html |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080905215503/http://aristotle.tamu.edu/~rasmith/Courses/PhilosophicalWriting/08a/fallacies.html |dead-url = yes |archive-date = 2008-09-05 |title = PHIL 495: Philosophical Writing (Spring 2008), Texas A&amp;M University |date =  |accessdate = 2013-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
An example of a language dependent fallacy is given as a debate as to who amongst humanity are learners: the wise or the ignorant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Frans |first1 = van Eemeren |last2 = Bart |first2 = Garssen |last3 = Bert |first3 = Meuffels |title = Fallacies and judgements of reasonableness, Empirical Research Concerning the Pragma-Dialectical Discussion Rules |date = 2009 |publisher = Springer Science+Business Media B.V. |location = Dordrecht |isbn = 978-90-481-2613-2 |page = 3 |language = English |chapter = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A language-independent fallacy is for example:
# "[[Coriscus of Scepsis|Coriscus]] is different from Socrates."
# "Socrates is a man."
# "Therefore, Coriscus is different from a man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Frans |first1 = van Eemeren |last2 = Bart |first2 = Garssen |last3 = Bert |first3 = Meuffels |title = Fallacies and judgements of reasonableness, Empirical Research Concerning the Pragma-Dialectical Discussion Rules |date = 2009 |publisher = Springer Science+Business Media B.V. |location = Dordrecht |isbn = 978-90-481-2613-2 |page = 4 |language = English |chapter = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Whately's grouping===

[[Richard Whately]] defines a fallacy broadly as, "any argument, or apparent argument, which professes to be decisive of the matter at hand, while in reality it is not".&lt;ref&gt;Frans H. van Eemeren, Bart Garssen, Bert Meuffels (2009). ''Fallacies and Judgments of Reasonableness: Empirical Research Concerning the Pragma-Dialectical Discussion Rules'', p.8. {{ISBN|9789048126149}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whately divided fallacies into two groups: ''logical'' and ''material''. According to Whately, logical fallacies are arguments where the conclusion does not follow from the premises. Material fallacies are not logical errors because the conclusion does follow from the premises. He then divided the logical group into two groups: purely logical and semi-logical. The semi-logical group included all of Aristotle's [[sophisms]] except:''[[ignoratio elenchi]]'', ''[[petitio principii]]'', and ''[[non causa pro causa]]'', which are in the material group.&lt;ref name="Coffey1912"&gt;{{cite book |first = P. |last = Coffey |year = 1912 |title = The Science of Logic |publisher = Longmans, Green, and Company |lccn = 12018756 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=j8BCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA302 |page = 302 |accessdate = 2016-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other systems of classification===
Of other classifications of fallacies in general the most famous are those of [[Francis Bacon (philosopher)|Francis Bacon]] and [[John Stuart Mill|J. S. Mill]]. Bacon (''[[Novum Organum]]'', Aph. 33, 38 sqq.) divided fallacies into four Idola (Idols, i.e. False Appearances), which summarize the various kinds of mistakes to which the human intellect is prone. With these should be compared the Offendicula of Roger Bacon, contained in the Opus maius, pt. i. J. S. Mill discussed the subject in book v. of his Logic, and [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s Book of Fallacies (1824) contains valuable remarks. See Rd. Whateley's Logic, bk. v.; A. de Morgan, Formal Logic (1847); A. Sidgwick, Fallacies (1883) and other textbooks.

==Formal fallacy==
{{Main|Formal fallacy}}

A formal fallacy, deductive fallacy, logical fallacy or ''non sequitur'' ([[Latin]] for "it does not follow") is a flaw in the structure of a [[deductive reasoning|deductive]] [[logical argument|argument]] which renders the argument [[Validity (logic)|invalid]]. The flaw can neatly be expressed in standard system of logic.&lt;ref name="GenslerAZ"/&gt; Such an argument is always considered to be wrong.
The presence of the formal fallacy does not imply anything about the argument's [[premise]]s or its conclusion. Both may actually be true, or may even be more probable as a result of the argument; but the deductive argument is still invalid because the conclusion does not follow from the premises in the manner described.

{{Dubious span|text=By extension, an argument can contain a formal fallacy even if the argument is not a deductive one: for instance, an [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]] argument that incorrectly applies principles of probability or [[causality]] can be said to commit a formal fallacy.|date=May 2018}} "Since deductive arguments depend on formal properties and inductive arguments don't, formal fallacies apply only to deductive arguments."&lt;ref name=garns /&gt;

A logical form such as "''A'' and ''B''" is independent of any particular conjunction of meaningful propositions. Logical form alone can guarantee that given true premises, a true conclusion must follow. However, formal logic makes no such guarantee if any premise is false; the conclusion can be either true or false. Any formal error or logical fallacy similarly invalidates the deductive guarantee. Both the argument and all its premises must be true for a statement to be true.

The term ''logical fallacy'' is in a sense self-contradictory, because ''logic'' refers to valid reasoning, whereas a ''fallacy'' is the use of poor reasoning. Therefore, the term ''formal fallacy'' is preferred. In informal discourse however, ''logical fallacy'' is used to mean an argument which is problematic for any reason.

The term ''non sequitur'' denotes a general formal fallacy, often meaning one which does not belong to any named subclass of formal fallacies like [[affirming the consequent]].

===Common examples===
{{main|List of fallacies#Formal fallacies}}

==== Ecological fallacy ====
An [[ecological fallacy]] is committed when one draws an inference from data based on the premise that qualities observed for groups necessarily hold for individuals; for example, "if countries with more Protestants tend to have higher suicide rates, then Protestants must be more likely to commit suicide."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Freedman |first = David A. |title = Encyclopedia of Social Science Research Methods |year = 2004 |publisher = Sage |location = Thousand Oaks, CA |isbn = 978-0761923633 |pages = 293–295 |authorlink = Ecological Fallacy |editor = Michael S. Lewis-Beck &amp; Alan Bryman &amp; Tim Futing Liao }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The fallacy fork===
[[Maarten Boudry]] argues that formal, deductive fallacies rarely occur in real life and that arguments that would be fallacious in formally deductive terms are not necessarily so when context and prior probabilities are taken into account, thus making the argument defeasible and inductive. For a given fallacy, one must either characterize it by means of a deductive argumentation schema, which rarely applies (the first prong of the fork) or one must relax definitions and add nuance to take the actual intent and context of the argument into account (the other prong of the fork).  To argue, for example, that one became nauseous after eating a mushroom because the mushroom was poisonous could be an example of the ''post hoc ergo propter hoc'' fallacy unless one were actually arguing inductively and probabilistically that it is likely that the mushroom caused the illness since some mushrooms are poisonous, it is possible to misidentify a mushroom as edible, one doesn't usually feel nauseous, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Boudry |first1=Maarten |authorlink1=Maarten Boudry |title=The Fallacy Fork: Why It's Time to Get Rid of Fallacy Theory |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=5 |pages=46–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Informal fallacy==
In contrast to a formal fallacy, an informal fallacy originates in a reasoning error other than a flaw in the logical form of the argument.&lt;ref name=garns /&gt; A [[deductive argument]] containing an informal fallacy may be formally [[Validity (logic)|valid]],&lt;ref name=Downden /&gt; but still remain rationally unpersuasive. Nevertheless, informal fallacies apply to both deductive and non-deductive arguments.

Though the form of the argument may be relevant, fallacies of this type are the "types of mistakes in reasoning that arise from the mishandling of the ''content'' of the propositions constituting the argument".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1 = Copi |first1 = Irving M. |last2 = Cohen |first2 = Carl |year = 2005 |title = Introduction to Logic |edition = 12 |publisher = Pearson Education, Inc. |isbn = 978-0-13-189834-9 }} p.125&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Faulty generalization ===
A special subclass of the informal fallacies is the set of [[faulty generalization]]s, also known as inductive fallacies. Here the most important issue concerns inductive strength or methodology (for example, [[statistical inference]]). In the absence of sufficient evidence, drawing conclusions based on induction is unwarranted and fallacious. With the backing of [[empirical evidence]], however, the conclusions may become warranted and convincing (at which point the arguments are no longer considered fallacious).{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==== Hasty generalization ====
For instance, [[hasty generalization]] is making assumptions about a whole group or range of cases based on a [[Sample (statistics)|sample]] that is inadequate (usually because it is atypical or just too small).
Stereotypes about people ("frat boys are drunkards", "grad students are nerdy", "women don’t enjoy sports", etc.) are a common example of the principle.

Hasty generalisation often follows a pattern such as:

:X is true for A.
:X is true for B.
:Therefore, X is true for C, D, etc.

While never a valid logical deduction, if such an inference can be made on statistical grounds, it may nonetheless be convincing. This is because with enough empirical evidence, the generalization is no longer a hasty one.

=== Relevance fallacy ===
The [[fallacy of relevance|fallacies of relevance]] are a broad class of informal fallacies (see the [[#Fallacies of relevance|navbox below]]), generically represented by [[missing the point]]: Presenting an argument, which may be [[soundness|sound]], but fails to address the issue in question.

==== ''Argumentum ex silentio'' ====
An [[argument from silence]] features an unwarranted conclusion advanced based on the absence of data.

=== Examples of informal fallacies ===
{{Main|List of fallacies#Informal fallacies}}

==== ''Post hoc'' (false cause) ====
This fallacy gets its name from the Latin phrase "post hoc, ergo propter hoc," which translates as "after this, therefore because of this."
''Definition:'' Assuming that because B comes after A, A caused B.
Sometimes one event really does cause another one that comes later—for example, if I register for a class, and my name later appears on the roll, it's true that the first event caused the one that came later. But sometimes two events that seem related in time aren't really related as cause and event. That is, correlation isn't the same thing as causation.

==== Slippery slope ====
''Definition:'' The arguer claims that a sort of chain reaction, usually ending in some dire consequence, will take place, but in fact there is not enough evidence for that assumption.
The arguer asserts that if we take even one step onto the "[[slippery slope]]," we will end up sliding all the way to the bottom; he or she assumes we can't stop halfway down the hill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/eng207-td/Logic%20and%20Analysis/most_common_logical_fallacies.htm |title = The Most Common Logical Fallacies |website = www.webpages.uidaho.edu |access-date = 2017-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== False analogy ====
This error in reasoning occurs when claims are supported by unsound comparisons, hence the [[false analogy]]'s informal nickname of the "[[apples and oranges]]" fallacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Kornprobst |first = Markus |title = Comparing Apples and Oranges? Leading and Misleading Uses of Historical Analogies |journal = Millennium&amp;nbsp;— Journal of International Studies |year = 2007 |volume = 36 |pages = 29–49 |doi = 10.1177/03058298070360010301 |url = http://mil.sagepub.com/content/36/1/29 |archive-url = https://archive.is/20131030094151/http://mil.sagepub.com/content/36/1/29 |dead-url = yes |archive-date = 30 October 2013 |accessdate = 29 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement fallacy==
Some of the fallacies described above may be committed in the context of measurement.
Where [[mathematical fallacies]] are subtle mistakes in reasoning leading to invalid mathematical proofs, measurement fallacies are unwarranted inferential leaps involved in the extrapolation of raw data to a measurement-based value claim. The ancient Greek Sophist [[Protagoras]] was one of the first thinkers to propose that humans can generate reliable measurements through his "human-measure" principle and the practice of ''dissoi logoi'' (arguing multiple sides of an issue).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Schiappa |first = Edward |title = Protagoras and Logos: A Study in Greek Philosophy and Rhetoric |year = 1991 |publisher = University of South Carolina Press |location = Columbia, SC |isbn = 978-0872497580 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Protagoras |title = The Older Sophists |year = 1972 |publisher = Hackett Publishing Co. |location = Indianapolis, IN |isbn = 978-0872205567 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This history helps explain why measurement fallacies are informed by [[informal logic]] and [[argumentation theory]].

===Knowledge value measurement fallacy===
Increasing availability and circulation of [[big data]] are driving proliferation of new metrics for scholarly authority,&lt;ref name=Meho&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Meho |first = Lokman I. |year = 2007 |title = The Rise and Rise of Citation Analysis |journal = [[Physics World]] |volume = January |pages = 32–36 |arxiv = physics/0701012 |bibcode = 2007physics...1012M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://chronicle.com/article/The-New-Metrics-of-Scholarly/5449 |title = The New Metrics of Scholarly Authority |last = Jensen |first = Michael |date = June 15, 2007 |work = [[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |access-date = 28 October 2013 |publisher = The Chron |editor-last = Riley |editor-first = Michael G. |issn = 0009-5982 |oclc = 1554535 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is lively discussion regarding the relative usefulness of such metrics for measuring the value of knowledge production in the context of an "information tsunami".&lt;ref name="Baveye 2010 191–215"&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Baveye |first = Phillippe C. |year = 2010 |title = Sticker Shock and Looming Tsunami: The High Cost of Academic Serials in Perspective |url = https://muse.jhu.edu/article/369309 |journal = [[Journal of Scholarly Publishing]] |volume = 41 |issue = 2 |pages = 191–215 |doi = 10.1353/scp.0.0074 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=28 October 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, [[anchoring]] fallacies can occur when unwarranted weight is given to data generated by metrics that the arguers themselves acknowledge is flawed. For example, limitations of the [[journal impact factor]] (JIF) are well documented,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url = http://www.natcom.org/uploadedFiles/More_Scholarly_Resources/CCA%20Impact%20Factor%20Report%20Final.pdf |title = Impact Factors, Journal Quality, and Communication Journals: A Report for the Council of Communication Associations |last = National Communication Journal |publisher = National Communication Association |year = 2013 |location = Washington, D.C. |access-date = 2016-02-22 |archive-date = April 4, 2016 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160404212454/http://www.natcom.org/uploadedFiles/More_Scholarly_Resources/CCA%20Impact%20Factor%20Report%20Final.pdf |deadurl = yes |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and even JIF pioneer Eugene Garfield notes, "while citation data create new tools for analyses of research performance, it should be stressed that they supplement rather than replace other quantitative-and qualitative-indicators."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Gafield |first = Eugene |title = What Citations Tell us About Canadian Research |journal = Canadian Journal of Library and Information Science |year = 1993 |volume = 18 |issue = 4 |page = 34 |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; To the extent that arguers jettison acknowledged limitations of JIF-generated data in evaluative judgments, or leave behind Garfield's "supplement rather than replace" caveat, they court commission of anchoring fallacies.

A [[naturalistic fallacy]] can occur for example in the case of sheer quantity metrics based on the premise "more is better"&lt;ref name="Baveye 2010 191–215" /&gt; or, in the case of developmental assessment in the field of psychology, "higher is better."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Stein |first = Zachary |title = Myth Busting and Metric Making: Refashioning the Discourse about Development |journal = Integral Leadership Review |date = October 2008 |volume = 8 |issue = 5 |url = http://www.archive-ilr.com/archives-2008/2008-10/2008-10-article-stein.php |archive-url = https://archive.is/20131030094158/http://www.archive-ilr.com/archives-2008/2008-10/2008-10-article-stein.php |archive-date = October 30, 2013 |access-date = October 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[false analogy]] occurs when claims are supported by unsound comparisons between data points. For example, the [[Scopus]] and [[Web of Science]] bibliographic databases have difficulty distinguishing between citations of scholarly work that are arms-length endorsements, ceremonial citations, or negative citations (indicating the citing author withholds endorsement of the cited work).&lt;ref name=Meho/&gt; Hence, measurement-based value claims premised on the uniform quality of all citations may be questioned on false analogy grounds.

For the next example let us consider Academic Analytics' [[Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index]], which purports to measure overall faculty productivity, yet the tool does not capture data based on citations in books. This creates a possibility that low productivity measurements using the tool may constitute [[argument from silence]] fallacies, to the extent that such measurements are supported by the absence of book citation data.

[[Ecological fallacy|Ecological fallacies]] can be committed when one measures scholarly productivity of a sub-group of individuals (e.g. "Puerto Rican" faculty) via reference to aggregate data about a larger and different group (e.g. "Hispanic" faculty).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Allen |first = Henry L. |title = Faculty Workload and Productivity: Ethnic and Gender Disparities |journal = NEA 1997 Almanac of Higher Education |year = 1997 |page = 39 |url = http://www.nea.org/assets/img/PubAlmanac/ALM_97_04.pdf |format = PDF |access-date = October 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intentional fallacy==

Sometimes a speaker or writer uses a fallacy intentionally. In any context, including academic debate, a conversation among friends, political discourse, advertising, or for comedic purposes, the arguer may use fallacious reasoning to try to persuade the listener or reader, by means other than offering relevant evidence, that the conclusion is true.

Examples of this include the speaker or writer:&lt;ref name="Shewan"&gt;

In humor, errors of reasoning are used for comical purposes. Groucho Marx used fallacies of [[amphiboly]], for instance, to make ironic statements; [[Gary Larson]] and [[Scott Adams]] employed fallacious reasoning in many of their cartoons. Wes Boyer and Samuel Stoddard have written a humorous essay teaching students how to be persuasive by means of a whole host of informal and formal fallacies.&lt;ref name="How to Be Persuasive"&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.rinkworks.com/persuasive/ |title = How to Be Persuasive |last = Boyer |first = Web |last2 = Stoddard |first2 = Samuel |website = Rink Works |access-date = December 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessment&amp;nbsp;— pragmatic theory==
According to the pragmatic theory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1 = Douglas N. |last1 = Walton |url = https://books.google.es/books?id=4uTWAAAAMAAJ |title = A Pragmatic Theory of Fallacy |publisher = [[University of Alabama Press]] |author-link = Douglas N. Walton |year = 1995 |location = Tuscaloosa |pages = 324 |isbn = 9780817307981 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a fallacy can in some instances be an error a fallacy, use of a heuristic (short version of an argumentation scheme) to jump to a conclusion. However, even more worryingly, in other instances it is a tactic or ploy used inappropriately in argumentation to try to get the best of a speech part unfairly. There are always two parties to an argument containing a fallacy&amp;nbsp;— the perpetrator and the intended victim. The dialogue framework required to support the pragmatic theory of fallacy is built on the presumption that argumentative dialogue has both an adversarial component and a collaborative component. A dialogue has individual goals for each participant, but also collective (shared) goals that apply to all participants. A fallacy of the second kind is seen as more than simply violation of a rule of reasonable dialogue. It is also a deceptive tactic of argumentation, based on sleight-of-hand. Aristotle explicitly compared contentious reasoning to unfair fighting in athletic contest. But the roots of the pragmatic theory go back even further in history to the Sophists. The pragmatic theory finds its roots in the Aristotelian conception of a fallacy as a sophistical refutation, but also supports the view that many of the types of arguments traditionally labelled as fallacies are in fact reasonable techniques of argumentation that can be used, in many cases, to support legitimate goals of dialogue. Hence on the pragmatic approach, each case needs to analyzed individually, to determine by the textual evidence whether the argument is fallacious or reasonable.

&lt;!--Still contains unverified claims.  Still looking though--&gt;

'''Fides''' ([[Latin]]: ''trust'') is a guide allowing estimated reliability calculation for electronic components and systems. The reliability prediction is generally expressed in [[Failure rate|FIT]] (number of failures for 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; hours) or [[Mean time between failures|MTBF]] (Mean Time Between Failures). This guide provides reliability data for RAMS (Reliability, Availability, Maintainability, Safety) studies.

==Purpose==
Fides is a ''[[Délégation générale pour l'armement|DGA]]'' ([[France|French]] armament industry supervision agency) study conducted by a [[Europe]]an consortium formed by eight [[Business magnate|industrialists]] from the fields of [[aeronautics]] and Defence:

*[[Airbus|AIRBUS]] France
*[[Eurocopter]]
*[[Nexter]] Electronics
*[[MBDA]] Missiles Systems
*Thales Services
*Thales Airborne Systems
*Thales Avionics
*[[Thales Underwater Systems]]

The first aim of the Fides project was to develop a new reliability assessment method for electronic components which takes into consideration [[Commercial off-the-shelf|COTS]] (commercial off-the-shelf) and specific parts and the new technologies. The global aim is to find a replacement to the worldwide reference MIL-HDBK-217F,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://assist.daps.dla.mil/quicksearch/basic_profile.cfm?ident_number=53939|title =MIL-HDBK-217F. Military Handbook – Reliability Prediction of Electronic Equipment. Department of Defense, 1991|accessdate =2007-11-17|date =|format =|pages =|publisher =|quote =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070311233011/http://assist.daps.dla.mil/quicksearch/basic_profile.cfm?ident_number=53939|archivedate =2007-03-11|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is old and has not been revised since 1995 (issue F notice 2). Moreover, the MIL HDBK 217F is very pessimistic for COTS components which are more and more widely used in military and aerospace systems.

The second aim was to write a reliability engineering guide in order to provide engineering process and tools to improve reliability in the development of new electronic systems.

==Method content==
The Fides guide is made of two distinct parts. The first is a reliability prediction calculation method concerning main electronic component families and complete subassemblies like [[Hard disk drive|hard disks]] or [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] displays. The second part is a [[process control]] and [[audit]] guide which is a tool to assess the reliability quality and technical know-how in the operating time of the studied product, operational specification and maintenance. 

==Availability==&lt;!--Probably not the best way, but it works.  Drawing attention to the fact the site requires free registration before the viewer visits--&gt;
The Fides guide is freely available on the &lt;span class="reference"&gt;[[#External_FidesSiteLink|Fides reliability website]]&lt;/span&gt;.

== Standardization==
The French standardisation organisation UTE (''Union Technique de l'Electricité'') has accepted the Fides publication, with the reference UTE C 80 811 (available in both French and English). An international normative reference extension ([[International Electrotechnical Commission]]) is planned for the future.

==Future==
Fides has met great interest and success since the end of the study in 2004. The method has been quickly declared a standard that can be applied to French military programs. For two years, the French military experts of DGA have already used FIDES method in different major programs for Defence, in missiles or tactical [[telecommunication]]s fields for example.

[[United States|American]] companies like [[Boeing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.aero.org/conferences/mrqw/2004-papers/Bechtold.pdf |title = COTS Electronics Reliability - An Assessment of FIDES |accessdate = 2007-11-19 |date = 2005-01-03 &lt;!--date was specified as 3/01/2005. document metadata states 2005-01-03--&gt; |format = PDF |pages =  |publisher = Boeing |quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Japan]]ese organisations like [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency|JAXA]] (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) as well as French companies or organisations like ''[[Électricité de France|EDF]]'' (''Electricité de France'', French electricity provider) or ''[[CNES]]'' (''Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales'', the French space agency) showed an interest in FIDES methodology, but none of them are using FIDES at this time.

Further developments of the Fides guide (such as the improvement of existing models and the widening of the spectrum covered by component families) resulted in a new version of the Fides guide being published in the middle of year 2009.

[[File:Trailing edge NACA 0012.svg|thumb|300px|right|{{center|Fins typically function as [[foil (fluid mechanics)|foils]] that provide lift or thrust, or provide the ability to steer or stabilize motion in water or air}}]]

A '''fin''' is a thin component or appendage attached to a larger body or structure. Fins typically function as [[foil (fluid mechanics)|foils]] that produce [[lift (force)|lift]] or [[thrust]], or provide the ability to steer or stabilize motion while traveling in water, air, or other [[fluids]]. Fins are also used to [[Fin (extended surface)|increase surface areas for heat transfer purposes]], or simply as ornamentation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/american_english/fin Fin] ''Oxford dictionary''. Retrieved 24 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fin Fin] ''Merriam-Webster dictionary''. Retrieved 24 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fins first evolved on [[fish]] as a means of locomotion. [[Fish fin]]s are used to generate [[thrust]] and control the subsequent motion. Fish, and other aquatic animals such as [[cetaceans]], actively propel and steer themselves with [[pectoral fin|pectoral]] and [[Caudal fin|tail fins]]. As they swim, they use other fins, such as [[dorsal fin|dorsal]] and [[anal fin]]s, to achieve stability and refine their maneuvering.&lt;ref name=Sfakiotakis /&gt;&lt;ref name=Helfman&gt;Helfman G, Collette BB, Facey DE and Bowen BW (2009) [http://limnology.wisc.edu/courses/zoo510/2009/helfman_ch8.pdf "Functional morphology of locomotion and feeding"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602082907/http://limnology.wisc.edu/courses/zoo510/2009/helfman_ch8.pdf |date=2015-06-02 }} Chapter 8, pp. 101–116. In:''The Diversity of Fishes: Biology'', John Wiley &amp; Sons. {{ISBN|9781444311907}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generating thrust==
Foil shaped fins generate [[thrust]] when moved, the lift of the fin sets water or air in motion and pushes the fin in the opposite direction. Aquatic animals get significant [[thrust]] by moving fins back and forth in water. Often the [[Caudal fin|tail fin]] is used, but some aquatic animals generate thrust from [[pectoral fins]].&lt;ref name=Sfakiotakis /&gt; Fins can also generate thrust if they are rotated in air or water. [[Turbine]]s and [[propeller]]s (and sometimes [[Mechanical fan|fans]] and [[pump]]s) use a number of rotating fins, also called foils, wings, arms or blades.  Propellers use the fins to translate torquing force to lateral thrust, thus propelling an aircraft or ship.&lt;ref&gt;Carlton, John (2007) [https://books.google.com/books?id=QrLNCxzynU4C ''Marine Propellers and Propulsion''] Pages 1–28, Butterworth-Heinemann. {{ISBN|9780750681506}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Turbines work in reverse, using the lift of the blades to generate torque and power from moving gases or water.&lt;ref&gt;Soares, Claire (2008) [https://books.google.com/books?id=rTPZp1YCQBkC ''Gas Turbines: A Handbook of Air, Land, and Sea Applications''] Pages 1–23, Butterworth-Heinemann. {{ISBN|9780750679695}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cavitation]] can be a problem with high power applications, resulting in damage to propellers or turbines, as well as noise and loss of power.&lt;ref name=Franc&gt;Franc, Jean-Pierre and Michel, Jean-Marie (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=QJOQYa_oo24C ''Fundamentals of Cavitation''] Springer. {{ISBN|9781402022326}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Cavitation occurs when negative pressure causes bubbles (cavities) to form in a liquid, which then promptly and violently collapse. It can cause significant damage and wear.&lt;ref name=Franc /&gt; Cavitation damage can also occur to the tail fins of powerful swimming marine animals, such as dolphins and tuna. Cavitation is more likely to occur near the surface of the ocean, where the ambient water pressure is relatively low. Even if they have the power to swim faster, dolphins may have to restrict their speed because collapsing cavitation bubbles on their tail are too painful.&lt;ref name=hurts&gt;{{cite news | last = Brahic | first = Catherine | title = Dolphins swim so fast it hurts   | publisher = New Scientist | date = 2008-03-28 | url = https://www.newscientist.com/channel/life/dn13553-dolphins-swim-so-fast-it-hurts.html | accessdate = 2008-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cavitation also slows tuna, but for a different reason. Unlike dolphins, these fish do not feel the bubbles, because they have bony fins without nerve endings. Nevertheless, they cannot swim faster because the cavitation bubbles create a vapor film around their fins that limits their speed. Lesions have been found on tuna that are consistent with cavitation damage.&lt;ref name=hurts/&gt;

[[Scombrid]] fishes (tuna, mackerel and bonito) are particularly high-performance swimmers. Along the margin at the rear of their bodies is a line of small rayless, non-retractable fins, known as [[finlet]]s. There has been much speculation about the function  of these finlets. Research done in 2000 and 2001 by Nauen and Lauder indicated that "the finlets have a hydrodynamic effect on local flow during steady swimming" and that "the most posterior finlet is oriented to redirect flow into the developing tail vortex, which may increase thrust produced by the tail of swimming mackerel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nauen | first1 = JC | last2 = Lauder | first2 = GV | year = 2001a | title = Locomotion in scombrid fishes: visualization of flow around the caudal peduncle and finlets of the Chub mackerel ''Scomber japonicus'' | url = http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/13/2251.long | journal = Journal of Experimental Biology | volume = 204 | issue = 13| pages = 2251–63 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nauen | first1 = JC | last2 = Lauder | first2 = GV | year = 2001b | title = Three-dimensional analysis of finlet kinematics in the Chub mackerel ''(Scomber japonicus)'' | url = http://www.biolbull.org/content/200/1/9.full | journal = The Biological Bulletin | volume = 200 | issue = 1| pages = 9–19 | doi=10.2307/1543081| pmid = 11249216 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nauen | first1 = JC | last2 = Lauder | first2 = GV | year = 2000 | title = Locomotion in scombrid fishes: morphology and kinematics of the finlets of the Chub mackerel ''Scomber japonicus'' | url = http://jeb.biologists.org/content/203/15/2247.full.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Experimental Biology | volume = 203 | issue = 15| pages = 2247–59 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fish use multiple fins, so it is possible that a given fin can have a hydrodynamic interaction with another fin. In particular, the fins immediately upstream of the caudal (tail) fin may be proximate fins that can directly affect the flow dynamics at the caudal fin. In 2011, researchers using [[Particle image velocimetry|volumetric imaging]] techniques were able to generate "the first instantaneous three-dimensional views of wake structures as they are produced by freely swimming fishes". They found that "continuous tail beats resulted in the formation of a linked chain of vortex rings" and that "the dorsal and anal fin wakes are rapidly entrained by the caudal fin wake, approximately within the timeframe of a subsequent tail beat".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Flammang | first1 = BE | last2 = Lauder | first2 = GV | last3 = Troolin | first3 = DR | last4 = Strand | first4 = TE | year = 2011 | title = Volumetric imaging of fish locomotion | url = http://intl-rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/7/5/695.full | journal = Biology Letters | volume = 7 | issue = 5| pages = 695–698 | doi = 10.1098/rsbl.2011.0282 | pmc = 3169073 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bodies of [[reef fish]]es are often shaped differently from [[Pelagic fish|open water fishes]]. Open water fishes are usually built for speed, streamlined like torpedoes to minimise friction as they move through the water. Reef fish operate in the relatively confined spaces and complex underwater landscapes of [[coral reef]]s. For this manoeuvrability is more important than straight line speed, so coral reef fish have developed bodies which optimize their ability to dart and change direction.

There is an old theory, which has been often disregarded in science textbooks, "that fins and (later) limbs evolved from the gills of an extinct vertebrate". Gaps in the fossil record had not allowed a definitive conclusion. In 2009, researchers from the University of Chicago found evidence that the "genetic architecture of gills, fins and limbs is the same", and that "the skeleton of any appendage off the body of an animal is probably patterned by the developmental genetic program that we have traced back to formation of gills in sharks".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090323212021.htm Evolution Of Fins And Limbs Linked With That Of Gills] ''ScienceDaily''. 25 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gillis | first1 = JA | last2 = Dahn | first2 = RD | last3 = Shubin | first3 = NH | year = 2009 | title = Shared developmental mechanisms pattern the vertebrate gill arch and paired fin skeletons | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/106/14/5720.full | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 106 | issue = 14| pages = 5720–5724 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0810959106 | pmid=19321424 | pmc=2667079}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uctv.tv/shows/Wings-Legs-and-Fins-How-Do-New-Organs-Arise-in-Evolution-16421 Wings, legs, and fins: How do new organs arise in evolution?] [[Neil Shubin]], University of Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt;

About 200 million years ago the first mammals appeared. A group of these mammals started returning to the sea about 52 million years ago, thus completing a circle.

[[Ichthyosaur]]s are ancient reptiles that resembled dolphins. They first appeared about 245 million years ago and disappeared about 90 million years ago.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"This sea-going reptile with terrestrial ancestors converged so strongly on fishes that it actually evolved a [[dorsal fin]] and tail in just the right place and with just the right hydrological design. These structures are all the more remarkable because they evolved from nothing — the ancestral terrestrial reptile had no hump on its back or blade on its tail to serve as a precursor."&lt;ref name="Martill, 1993"&gt;Martill D.M.

;Terminology
There is some degree of overlap and interchangeably between the term ''fin'' and other terms. Most typically, a fin refers to a thin component or appendage attached to a larger body which is submerged in water. Fin-like structure which occur in other contexts are can be referred to by other terms, such as flipper, foil, wing, flap, keel sail or blade.

The term ''wing'' refers to the large fin-like structure that produce lift, particularly in air, such as the main wings of an airplane or bird.

The term ''wing'' often refers to larger fin-like structure that produce lift, particularly in air, such as the main wings of an airplane or bird. Smaller foil-like appendages not used primarily for lift, are still referred to as''fins'', such as ''tail fins''. Birds are said to''flap'' their wings, and the small fin-like appendages to wings that are used to modify their shape are called ''flaps''.. --&gt;

Robotic fish offer some research advantages, such as the ability to examine an individual part of a fish design in isolation from the rest of the fish. However, this risks oversimplifying the biology so key aspects of the animal design are overlooked. Robotic fish also allow researchers to vary a single parameter, such as flexibility or  a specific motion control. Researchers can directly measure forces, which is not easy to do in live fish. "Robotic devices also facilitate three-dimensional kinematic studies and correlated hydrodynamic analyses, as the location of the locomotor surface can be known accurately. And, individual components of a natural motion (such as outstroke vs. instroke of a flapping appendage) can be programmed separately, which is certainly difficult to achieve when working with a live animal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lauder | first1 = G.

A '''gender expression''' is a person's behavior, mannerisms, interests, and appearance that are associated with [[gender]] in a particular cultural context, specifically with the categories of [[femininity]] or [[masculinity]]. This also includes [[gender role]]s. These categories rely on [[stereotype]]s about gender.
==Defining gender expression==

Gender expression typically reflects a person's [[gender identity]] (their internal sense of their own gender), but this is not always the case.&lt;ref name="Summers"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Summers|first1=Randal W.|title=Social Psychology: How Other People Influence Our Thoughts and Actions [2 volumes]|date=2016|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781610695923|page=232|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5nF1DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA232|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="APA2015"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=American Psychological Association|title=Guidelines for Psychological Practice With Transgender and Gender Nonconforming People|journal=American Psychologist|date=December 2015|volume=70|issue=9|page=861|url=http://www.apa.org/practice/guidelines/transgender.pdf|doi=10.1037/a0039906}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender expression is separate and independent both from [[sexual orientation]] and [[Sex assignment|gender assigned at birth]]. A type of gender expression that is considered atypical for a person's externally perceived gender may be described as [[Gender variance|gender non-conforming]].

In men and boys, typical gender expression is often described as ''manly'', while atypical expression is known as [[Effeminacy|effeminate]]. In girls, atypical expression is called [[tomboy]]ish. In (especially queer) women, atypical and typical expression are known as [[butch and femme]] respectively. A mixture of typical and atypical expression may be described as [[Androgyny|androgynous]]. A type of expression that is perceived as neither typically feminine or masculine can be described as gender-neutral or undifferentiated.

The term ''gender expression'' is used in the [[Yogyakarta Principles]], which concern the application of international [[human rights law]] in relation to sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and [[Sex characteristics (legal term)|sex characteristics]].&lt;ref name="ypplus10"&gt;[http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/principles-en/yp10/ Yogyakarta Principles plus 10]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evaluating gender expression==

The [[Bem Sex-Role Inventory]] was designed to evaluate gender expression objectively (within a White American cultural context).

The '''handicap principle''' is a [[hypothesis]] originally proposed in 1975 by [[Israelis|Israeli]] [[biology|biologist]] [[Amotz Zahavi]] to explain how [[evolution]] may lead to "honest" or reliable [[Signalling theory|signaling]] between animals which have an obvious motivation to bluff or deceive each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Amotz |last=Zahavi |year=1975 |title=Mate selection—a selection for a handicap |journal=[[Journal of Theoretical Biology]] |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=205–214 |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(75)90111-3 |pmid=1195756}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Amotz |last=Zahavi |year=1977 |title=The cost of honesty (Further remarks on the handicap principle) |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=67 |issue=3 |pages=603–605 |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(77)90061-3 |pmid=904334}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Amotz |last=Zahavi |year=1997 |title=The handicap principle: a missing piece of Darwin's puzzle |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-510035-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The handicap principle suggests that [[signalling theory|reliable signals]] must be costly to the signaler, costing the signaler something that could not be afforded by an individual with less of a particular trait. For example, in the case of [[sexual selection]], the theory suggests that animals of greater [[fitness (biology)|biological fitness]] signal this status through handicapping [[ethology|behaviour]] or [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] that effectively lowers this quality. The central idea is that [[sexual selection|sexually selected]] traits function like [[conspicuous consumption]], signalling the ability to afford to squander a resource. Receivers know that the signal indicates quality because inferior quality signallers cannot afford to produce such wastefully extravagant signals.

The generality of the phenomenon is the matter of some debate and disagreement, and Zahavi's views on the scope and importance of handicaps in biology has not been accepted by the mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grose|first1=Jonathan|title=Modelling and the fall and rise of the handicap principle|journal=Biology &amp; Philosophy|date=7 June 2011|volume=26|issue=5|pages=677–696|doi=10.1007/s10539-011-9275-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Review by {{cite journal |first=Andrew |last=Pomiankowski |last2=Iwasa |first2=Y. |year=1998 |title=Handicap Signaling: Loud and True? |journal=[[Evolution (journal)|Evolution]] |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages=928–932 |doi= 10.2307/2411290|jstor=2411290 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, the idea has been very influential,&lt;ref name="Johnstone97"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Johnstone |first=R.

M. |year=1973 |title=Job Market Signaling |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=87 |issue=3 |pages=355–374 |doi=10.2307/1882010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where the job applicant signals their quality by declaring a costly education.  In Grafen’s model, the courting male's quality is signalled by investment in an extravagant trait—such as the [[peacock]]'s tail.  In both cases, the signal is reliable if the cost to the signaller of producing it is lower for higher-quality signallers than it is for lower-quality signallers (Fig. 2).

A series of papers by [[Thomas Getty]] shows that Grafen’s proof of the handicap principle depends on the critical simplifying assumption that signalers trade off costs for benefits in an additive fashion, the way humans invest money to increase income in the same currency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Getty |first=T. |year=1998a |title=Handicap signalling: when fecundity and viability do not add up |journal=[[Animal Behaviour (journal)|Anim.

It can be reasoned that as fitness depends on the production of offspring, this is therefore a multiplicative function, not an additive function, of reproductive success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nur |first=N. |last2=Hasson |first2=O. |year=1984 |title=Phenotypic plasticity and the handicap principle |journal=J.

The hungrier the baby bird, the more food is of value to it, and the higher the optimal signalling level (the louder its chirping).

Counter-examples to handicap models predate handicap models themselves. Models of signals (such as threat displays) without any handicapping costs show that [[Cheap talk|conventional signalling]] may be evolutionarily stable in biological communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Enquist |first=M. |year=1985 |title=Communication during aggressive interactions with particular reference to variation in choice of behaviour |journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=1152–1161 |doi=10.1016/S0003-3472(85)80175-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of some begging models also shows that, in addition to the handicapped outcomes, non-communication strategies are not only evolutionarily stable, but lead to higher payoffs for both players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rodriguez-Girones |first=M.

--&gt;

==Generality and empirical examples==
The theory predicts that a [[sexual ornament]], or any other signal, must be costly if it is to accurately advertise a trait of relevance to an individual with conflicting interests.  Typical examples of handicapped signals include [[bird song]]s, the [[peacock]]'s tail, [[courtship dance]]s, [[bowerbird]]'s bowers, or even possibly [[jewellery]] and [[humor]]{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}.  [[Jared Diamond]] has proposed that certain risky human behaviours, such as [[bungee jumping]], may be expressions of instincts that have evolved through the operation of the handicap principle.  Zahavi has invoked the [[potlatch]] ceremony as a human example of the handicap principle in action.  This interpretation of potlatch can be traced to [[Thorstein Veblen]]'s use of the ceremony in his book ''[[Theory of the Leisure Class]]'' as an example of "[[conspicuous consumption]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bliege Bird |first=R. |last2=Smith |first2=E. A. |year=2005 |title=Signalling theory, strategic interaction, and symbolic capital |journal=[[Current Anthropology]] |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=221–248 |jstor=427115 |doi=10.1086/427115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The handicap principle gains further support by providing interpretations for behaviours that fit into a single unifying [[gene-centered view of evolution]] and making earlier explanations based on [[group selection]] obsolete. A classic example is that of ''[[stotting]]'' in [[gazelle]]s. This behaviour consists in the gazelle initially running slowly and jumping high when threatened by a [[predator]] such as a [[lion]] or [[cheetah]]. The explanation based on group selection was that such behaviour might be adapted to alerting other gazelle to a cheetah's presence or might be part of a collective behaviour pattern of the group of gazelle to confuse the cheetah. Instead, Zahavi proposed that each gazelle was communicating  that it was a fitter individual than its fellows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Amotz Zahavi |author2=Avishag Zahavi |title=Jumping to Bold Conclusions A Review of The Handicap Principle: A Missing Piece of Darwin's Puzzle|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=286|url=http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/261475/1/10.1.1.40.3266.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may communicate to the cheetah to avoid chasing this fitter individual, or the message may be oriented toward the other gazelles, which would indicate its fitness to potential mates.

==Immunocompetence handicaps==
The theory of [[immunocompetence]] handicaps suggests that [[androgen]]-mediated traits accurately signal condition due to the immunosuppressive effects of androgens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Folstad |first=I. |last2=Karter |first2=A. K. |year=1992 |title=Parasites, bright males, and the immunocompetence handicap |journal=American Naturalist |volume=139 |issue=3 |pages=603–622 |jstor=2462500 |doi=10.1086/285346}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This immunosuppression may be either because testosterone alters the allocation of limited resources between the development of [[Secondary sex characteristic|ornamental traits]] and other tissues, including the immune system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wedekind |first=C. |last2=Folstad |first2=I. |year=1994 |title=Adaptive or non-adaptive immunosuppression by sex hormones? |journal=American Naturalist |volume=143 |issue=5 |pages=936–938 |jstor=2462885 |doi=10.1086/285641}}&lt;/ref&gt; or because heightened immune system activity has a propensity to launch autoimmune attacks against gametes, such that suppression of the immune system enhances fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Folstad |first=I. |last2=Skarstein |first2=F. |year=1996 |title=Is male germ line control creating avenues for female choice? |journal=[[Behavioral Ecology (journal)|Behavioral Ecology]] |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=109–112 |doi=10.1093/beheco/8.1.109 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Healthy individuals can afford to  suppress their immune system by raising their testosterone levels, which also augments secondary sexual traits and displays.  A review of empirical studies into the various aspects of this theory found weak support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Roberts |first=M. L. |last2=Buchanan |first2=K. L. |last3=Evans |first3=M. R. |year=2004 |title=Testing the immunocompetence handicap hypothesis: a review of the evidence |journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=68 |issue=2 |pages=227–239 |doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2004.05.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Directed at members of the same species===
[[File:SC06 2006 Rolls-Royce Phantom.jpg|thumb|Luxury cars and other "Veblen goods" may be an example of the handicap principle in humans]]
[[Amotz Zahavi]] studied in particular the [[Arabian babbler]], a very social bird, with a life-length of 30 years, which was considered to have [[altruistic]] behaviors. The helping-at-the-nest behavior often occurs among unrelated individuals, and therefore cannot be explained by kin selection. Zahavi reinterpreted these behaviours according to his signal theory and its correlative, the handicap principle. The altruistic act is costly to the donor, but may improve its attractiveness to potential mates. The evolution of this condition may be explained by [[competitive altruism]].&lt;ref name=Zahavi1974&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zahavi A. |year=1974 |title=Communal nesting by the Arabian Babbler: A case of individual selection|journal=Ibis|volume=116 |pages=84–87 |doi=10.1111/j.1474-919X.1974.tb00225.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Anava | first1=A. | last2=Kam | first2=M. | last3=Shkolnik | first3=A. | last4=Degen | first4=A.A. |year=2001|jstor=4089815|title=Does group size affect field metabolic rate of Arabian Babbler (''Turdoides squamiceps'') nestlings?|journal=The Auk|volume=118|pages=525–528|url=http://sora.unm.edu/node/131937}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zahavi1990&gt;Zahavi, A.

The tail of a [[peacock]] makes the peacock more vulnerable to predators, and may therefore be a handicap. However, the message that the tail carries to the potential mate peahen may be 'I have survived in spite of this huge tail; hence I am fitter and more attractive than others'.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

In the [[stalk-eyed fly]], research by Patrice David has demonstrated that genetic variation underlies the response to environmental stress, such as variable food quality, or of male sexual ornaments, such as increased eye span.&lt;ref name="david"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=P. David |author2=T. Bjorksten |author3=K. Fowler |author4=A. Pomiankowski |year=2000 |title=Condition-dependent signalling of genetic variation in stalk-eyed flies |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=406 |pages=186–188 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v406/n6792/abs/406186a0.html |doi=10.1038/35018079 |pmid=10910358 |issue=6792}}&lt;/ref&gt; David demonstrated that some male genotypes develop large eye spans under all conditions, whereas other genotypes progressively reduce eye spans as environmental conditions deteriorate. Several non-sexual traits, including female eye span and male and female wing length, also show condition-dependent expression, but their genetic response is entirely explained by scaling with body size. Unlike these characteristics, male eye span still reveals genetic variation in response to environmental stress after accounting for differences in body size. Thus, David inferred that these results strongly support the conclusion that female mate choice yields genetic benefits for offspring as eye span acts as a truthful indicator of male fitness. Eye span is therefore not only selected on the basis of attractiveness, but also because it demonstrates good genes in mates.&lt;ref name="david"/&gt;

An example in humans was suggested by [[Geoffrey Miller (evolutionary psychologist)|Geoffrey Miller]] who expressed that [[Veblen good]]s such as luxury cars and other forms of [[conspicuous consumption]] are manifestations of the handicap principle, being used to advertise "fitness", in the form of wealth and status, to potential mates. Obesity, a sign of ability to procure or afford plenty of food, comes at the expense of health, agility, and in more advanced cases, even strength; in cultures that experience food scarcity, this exhibits "fitness" to the opposite sex and is also often associated with wealth.  Recent cultural changes have altered this perception, particularly in western societies.

===Directed at other species===
[[File:Stotting gazelle.jpg|thumb|Impala [[stotting]], a behavior that may signal to predators that a pursuit would be wasted]]
The signal receiver need not be a [[Biological specificity|conspecific]] of the sender, however. Signals may also be directed at [[predator]]s, with the function of showing that pursuit will probably be unprofitable. [[Stotting]], for instance, is a sort of hopping that certain gazelles do when they sight a predator. As this behavior gives no evident benefit and would seem to waste resources (diminishing the gazelle's head start if chased by the predator), it was a puzzle until handicap theory offered an explanation.
According to this analysis, if the gazelle simply invests a little energy to show a lion that it has the fitness necessary to avoid capture, it may not have to evade the lion in an actual pursuit. The lion, faced with the demonstration of fitness, might decide that it will not catch this gazelle, and thus, avoid a wasted pursuit.
The benefit to the gazelle is twofold. First, for the small amount of energy invested in the stotting, the gazelle might not have to expend the tremendous energy required to evade the lion. Second, if the lion is in fact capable of catching this gazelle, the gazelle's bluff leads to its survival that day.&lt;ref name=Caro&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347286800525 | title=The functions of stotting in Thomson’s gazelles: Some tests of the predictions | author=Caro, TM | journal=Animal Behaviour | year=1986 | volume=34 | pages=663–684 | doi=10.1016/S0003-3472(86)80052-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is provided by [[lark]]s, some of which discourage [[merlin (bird)|merlins]] by sending a similar message: they [[Bird vocalization|sing]] while being chased, telling their predator that they will be difficult to capture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cresswell|first1=Will|title=Song as a pursuit-deterrent signal, and its occurrence relative to other anti-predation behaviours of skylark (Alauda arvensis) on attack by merlins (Falco columbarius)|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|date=March 1994|volume=34|issue=3|pages=217–223|doi=10.1007/BF00167747|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00167747}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Industrial data processing''' is a branch of applied [[computer science]] that covers the area of design and programming of computerized systems which are not computers as such — often referred to as [[embedded system]]s ([[programmable logic controller|PLC]]s, [[Automation|automated systems]], intelligent instruments, etc.).  The products concerned contain at least one [[microprocessor]] or [[microcontroller]], as well as couplers (for [[I/O]]).

Another current definition of industrial data processing is that it concerns those [[computer program]]s whose variables in some way represent [[Physics|physical]] quantities; for example the [[temperature]] and [[pressure]] of a tank, the position of a [[robot]] arm, etc.

'''Language geography''' is the branch of [[human geography]] that studies the geographic distribution of language(s) or its constituent elements. There are two principal fields of study within the geography of language: 
# "''geography of languages''", which deals with the distribution through history and space of languages,&lt;ref&gt;Delgado de Carvalho, C.M. (1962). ''The geography of languages.'' In Wagner, P.L.; Mikesell, M.W. ''Readings in cultural geography.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 75-93.&lt;/ref&gt; and/or is concerned with 'the analysis of the distribution patterns and spatial structures of languages in contact'.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, C.H. (1980). ''Language contact and language change in Wales, 1901-1971: a study in historical geolinguistics.'' Welsh History Review 10, 207-238.&lt;/ref&gt;
# "''[[geolinguistics]]''" being, when used as a sub-discipline of geography, the study of the 'political, economic and cultural processes that affect the status and distribution of languages.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gunnemark|first=Erik|year=1991|title=What is geolinguistics ?|trans-title=|url=|journal=Geolinguistics, journal of the American Society of geolinguistics.|publisher=American Society of Geolinguistics|volume=17|page=12|pages=|issn=0190-4671|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When perceived as a sub-discipline of linguistics which incorporates contact linguistics, one definition appearing has been 'the study of languages and dialects in contact and in conflict with various societal, economic, ideological, political and other contemporary trends with regard to a particular geographic location and on a planetary scale'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://politlinguist.ru/announcements/17.doc|title=International Conference on multilingual perspectives in geolinguistics, April 11, 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguistic geography can also refer to studies of how people talk about the landscape. For example, [[toponymy]] is the study of place names.&lt;ref name="Toponymy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kadmon|first1=Naftali|title=Toponymy : the lore, laws, and language of geographical names|date=2000|publisher=Vantage Press|location=New York|isbn=0533135311|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Landscape ethnoecology, also known as ethnophysiography, is the study of landscape ontologies and how they are expressed in language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Johnson|editor1-first=Leslie Main|editor2-last=Hunn|editor2-first=Eugene S.|title=Landscape Ethnoecology: Concepts of Biotic and Physical Space|date=2012|publisher=Berghahn Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many studies in what is now called contact linguistics have researched the effect of [[language contact]],&lt;ref&gt;Weinrich, U. (1974). ''Languages in contact.'' The Hague: Mouton.&lt;/ref&gt; as the languages or dialects (varieties) of peoples have interacted.&lt;ref name=Dict/&gt; This territorial expansion of language groups has usually resulted in the overlaying of languages upon existing speech areas, rather than the replacement of one language by another. An example could be sought in the [[Norman Conquest of England]]: [[Old French]] became the language of the aristocracy but [[Middle English]] remained the language of the majority of the population.&lt;ref&gt;Burchfield, Robert [1985] (2003). ''The English Language'', New York: Oxford University Press, 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Linguistic geography ==
Linguistic geography, as a field, is dominated by [[Linguistics|linguists]] rather than [[geographer]]s.&lt;ref name=Trud3/&gt; [[Charles W. J. Withers]] describes the difference as resulting from a focus on "elements of language, and only then with their geographical or social variation, as opposed to investigation of the processes making for change in the extent of language areas."&lt;ref name=Dict/&gt; [[Peter Trudgill]] says, "linguistic geography has been geographical only in the sense that it has been concerned with the spatial distribution of linguistic phenomena."&lt;ref name=Trud2/&gt; Greater emphasis has been laid upon explanation rather than mere description of the patterns of linguistic change.&lt;ref name=Trud3/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dict/&gt; That move has paralleled similar concerns in [[geography]] and language studies.&lt;ref&gt;Withers, C.W.J. (1984). ''Gaelic in Scotland 1698-1981: the geographical history of a language.'' Edinburgh: John Donald; Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Some studies have paid attention to the social use&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M. (2009). Language ecology and linguistic landscape analysis. In E. Shohamy &amp; D. Gorter (Eds.), ''Linguistic landscape: Expanding the scenery'' (pp. 88-104). London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; of language and to variations in dialect within languages in regard to [[social class]] or occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Giglioli, P.P. (1972). ''Language and social context.'' Harmondsworth: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding such variations, lexicographer [[Robert Burchfield]] notes that their nature "is a matter of perpetual discussion and disagreement" and notes that "most professional linguistic scholars regard it as axiomatic that all varieties of English have a sufficiently large vocabulary for the expression of all the distinctions that are important in the society using it." He contrasts this with the view of the historian [[John Vincent (historian)|John Vincent]], who regards such a view as

{{quote|"a nasty little orthodoxy among the educational and linguistic establishment. However badly you need standard English, you will have the merits of non-standard English waved at you. The more extravagantly your disadvantages will be lauded as 'entirely adequate for the needs of their speakers', to cite the author of ''Sociolinguistics''. It may sound like a radical cry to support pidgin, patois, or dialect, but translated into social terms, it looks more like a ploy to keep Them (whoever Them may be) out of the middle-class suburbs."|John Vincent|The Times&lt;ref&gt;''The Times, 23 February 1983, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Burchfield concludes, "Resolution of such opposite views is not possible.... future of dialect studies and the study of class-marked distinctions are likely to be of considerable interest to everyone."&lt;ref&gt;Burchfield, Robert [1985] (2003). ''The English Language'', New York: Oxford University Press, 128-130.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[England]], linguistic geography has traditionally focused upon rural English,rather than urban English.&lt;ref&gt;In 1985, one could still say, "We still know far more about the distribution of ''byre/shippon/mistall/cow-stable/cow-house/cow-shed/neat-house/beast-house'' for 'cow-shed' than we do about urban synonyms  for pedestrian crossings, lollipop men, machines used to wash cars, forecourts of petrol stations, bollards, sleeping policemen, pay-out desks, supermarket trolleys, traffic wardens, telephone booths and hundreds of other items found in every city in the United Kingdom." Burchfield, Robert [1985] (2003). ''The English Language'', New York: Oxford University Press, 128.&lt;/ref&gt;  A common production of linguistic investigators of dialects is the shaded and dotted map showing to show where one linguistic feature ends and another begins or overlaps. Various compilations of these maps for England have been issued over the years, including Joseph Wright's ''English Dialect Dictionary'' (1896–1905), the ''[[Survey of English Dialects]]'' (1962-8), and ''The Linguistic Atlas of England'' (1978).&lt;ref&gt;Burchfield, Robert [1985] (2003). ''The English Language'', New York: Oxford University Press, 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geolinguistic organizations ==

Most [[geolinguistic organizations]] identify themselves as associations of linguists rather than of geographers. This includes the two oldest which both date to 1965 with "Amici Linguarum" (language friends) being founded by [http://www.kebi.se/erikgunnemark/engindex.html Erik V. Gunnemark] and The American Society of Geolinguistics by Prof. [[Mario A. Pei]]. The research in [[geolinguistics]] which these organizations and others, which are more geographically oriented, promote is often interdisciplinary, being at times simultaneously both linguistic and geographic, and also being at times linked to other sub-disciplines of linguistics as well as going beyond linguistics to connect to sociology, anthropology, ethnology, history, demographics, political science, studies of cognition and communication, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5140">The '''log wind profile''' is a semi-empirical relationship commonly used to describe the vertical distribution of horizontal mean wind speeds within the lowest portion of the [[planetary boundary layer]].  The relationship is well described in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Oke, T.R.|title=Boundary Layer Climates|edition=|publisher=Methuen|year=1987|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]] profile of wind speeds is generally limited to the lowest 100 m of the atmosphere (i.e., the [[surface layer]] of the [[atmospheric boundary layer]]). The rest of the atmosphere is composed of the remaining part of the planetary boundary layer (up to around 1000 m) and the troposphere or free atmosphere.  In the free atmosphere, geostrophic wind relationships should be used.

==Definition==
The equation to estimate the mean wind speed (&lt;math&gt;u_z&lt;/math&gt;) at height &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; (meters) above the ground is:
&lt;CENTER&gt;
&lt;math&gt;u_z = \frac{u_*}{\kappa} \left[\ln \left(\frac{z-d}{z_0} \right) + \psi(z,z_0,L)\right]&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/CENTER&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;u_*&lt;/math&gt; is the [[friction velocity]] (m s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Von Kármán constant]] (~0.41), &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the zero plane displacement (in metres), &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Roughness Length|surface roughness]] (in meters), and &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|stability]] term where &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Monin-Obukhov length|Obukhov length]] from [[Monin-Obukhov similarity theory]]. Under [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|neutral stability]] conditions, &lt;math&gt;z/L = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; drops out and the equation is simplified to,
&lt;CENTER&gt;
&lt;math&gt;u_z = \frac{u_*}{\kappa} \left[\ln \left(\frac{z-d}{z_0} \right)\right]&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;/CENTER&gt;

Zero-plane displacement (&lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;) is the height in meters above the ground at which zero wind speed is achieved as a result of flow obstacles such as trees or buildings.  It can be approximated as &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; of the average height of the obstacles.&lt;ref name="Holmes2015"&gt;Holmes JD. Wind Loading of Structures. 3rd ed. Boca Raton, Florida: CRC Press; 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, if estimating winds over a forest canopy of height 30 m, the zero-plane displacement could be estimated as d = 20 m.

Roughness length (&lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt;) is a corrective measure to account for the effect of the roughness of a surface on wind flow.  That is, the value of the roughness length depends on the terrain.  The exact value is subjective and references indicate a range of values, making it difficult to give definitive values. In most cases, references present a tabular format with the value of &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; given for certain terrain descriptions. For example, for very flat terrain (snow, desert) the roughness length may be in the range 0.001 to 0.005 m.&lt;ref name="Holmes2015"/&gt;  Similarly, for open terrain (grassland) the typical range is 0.01-0.05 m.&lt;ref name="Holmes2015"/&gt;  For cropland, and brush/forest the ranges are 0.1-0.25 m and 0.5-1.0 m respectively. When estimating wind loads on structures the terrains may be described as suburban or dense urban, for which the ranges are typically 0.1-0.5 m and 1-5 m respectively.&lt;ref name="Holmes2015"/&gt;

In order to estimate the mean wind speed at one height (&lt;math&gt;{{z}_{2}}&lt;/math&gt;) based on that at another (&lt;math&gt;{{z}_{1}}&lt;/math&gt;), the formula would be rearranged,&lt;ref name="Holmes2015"/&gt;
&lt;CENTER&gt;
&lt;math&gt;u({{z}_{2}})=u({{z}_{1}})\frac{\ln \left( ({{z}_{2}}-d)/{{z}_{0}} \right)}{\ln \left( ({{z}_{1}}-d)/{{z}_{0}} \right)}&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;/CENTER&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;u({{z}_{1}})&lt;/math&gt; is the mean wind speed at height &lt;math&gt;{{z}_{1}}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Limits==
The log wind profile is generally considered to be a more reliable estimator of mean wind speed  than the [[wind profile power law]] in the lowest 10–20 m of the planetary boundary layer. Between 20 m and 100 m both methods can produce reasonable predictions of mean wind speed in neutral atmospheric conditions. From 100 m to near the top of the atmospheric boundary layer the power law produces more accurate predictions of mean wind speed (assuming neutral atmospheric conditions).&lt;ref name="Cook, N.J. 1985"&gt;{{cite book|author=Cook, N.J.|title=The designer's guide to wind loading of building structures: Part 1|edition=|publisher=Butterworths|year=1985|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The neutral atmospheric stability assumption discussed above is reasonable when the hourly mean wind speed at a height of 10 m exceeds 10&amp;nbsp;m/s where turbulent mixing overpowers atmospheric instability.&lt;ref name="Cook, N.J. 1985"/&gt;

==Applications==
Log wind profiles are generated and used in many [[atmospheric dispersion modeling|atmospheric pollution dispersion models]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Beychok, Milton R.|title=[[Fundamentals Of Stack Gas Dispersion]]|edition=4th|publisher=author-published|year=2005|isbn=0-9644588-0-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2125">In [[descriptive set theory]], the '''Martin measure''' is a [[filter (mathematics)|filter]] on the set of [[Turing degree]]s of sets of [[natural number]]s, named after [[Donald A. Martin]]. Under the [[axiom of determinacy]] it can be shown to be an [[ultrafilter]].

== Definition ==
Let &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; be the set of Turing degrees of sets of natural numbers. Given some equivalence class &lt;math&gt;[X]\in D&lt;/math&gt;, we may define the ''cone'' (or ''upward cone'') of &lt;math&gt;[X]&lt;/math&gt; as the set of all Turing degrees &lt;math&gt;[Y]&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;X\le_T Y&lt;/math&gt;; that is, the set of Turing degrees which are "more complex" than &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; under Turing reduction.

We say that a set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of Turing degrees has measure 1 under the Martin measure exactly when &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; contains some cone. Since it is possible, for any &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, to construct a game in which player I has a winning strategy exactly when &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; contains a cone and in which player II has a winning strategy exactly when the complement of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; contains a cone, the [[axiom of determinacy]] implies that the measure-1 sets of Turing degrees form an ultrafilter.

== Consequences ==
It is easy to show that a countable intersection of cones is itself a cone; the Martin measure is therefore a [[Ultrafilter#Completeness|countably complete]] filter. This fact, combined with the fact that the Martin measure may be transferred to &lt;math&gt;\omega_1&lt;/math&gt; by a simple mapping, tells us that &lt;math&gt;\omega_1&lt;/math&gt; is measurable under the axiom of determinacy. This result shows part of the important connection between determinacy and [[large cardinal]]s.

'''Microturbulence''' is a form of [[turbulence]] that varies over small distance scales. (Large-scale turbulence is called macroturbulence.)

==Stellar==

Microturbulence is one of several mechanisms that can cause [[Spectral line|broadening]] of the [[absorption line]]s in the stellar spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Convection is the mechanism believed to be responsible for the observed turbulent velocity field, both in low mass stars and massive stars.
When examined by a [[spectroscope]], the velocity of the convective gas along the line of sight produces [[Doppler shift]]s in the absorption bands. It is the distribution of these velocities along the line of sight that produces the microturbulence broadening of the absorption lines in low mass stars that have convective envelopes. In massive stars convection can be present only in small regions below the surface; these sub-surface convection zones can excite turbulence at the stellar surface through the emission of acoustic and gravity waves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6268">A '''model transformation language''' in [[systems engineering|systems]] and [[software engineering]] is a language intended specifically for [[model transformation]].

== Overview ==
The notion of [[model transformation]] is central to [[Model-driven_engineering|model-driven development]]. A model transformation, which is essentially a program which operates on models, can be written in a general-purpose programming language, such as [[Java (programming language)|Java]]. However, special-purpose model transformation languages can offer advantages, such as syntax that makes it easy to refer to model elements. For writing bidirectional model transformations, which maintain consistency between two or more models, a specialist bidirectional model transformation language is particularly important, because it can help avoid the duplication that would result from writing each direction of the transformation separately. 

Currently, most model transformation languages are being developed in academia. The [[Object_Management_Group|OMG]] has standardised a family of model transformation languages called [[QVT]], but the field is still immature.&lt;ref name="FranceRumpe"/&gt;

== Available transformation languages ==
* [[ATLAS Transformation Language|ATL]] : a transformation language developed by the [[INRIA]]
* Beanbag (see [http://code.google.com/p/synclib/]) : an operation-based language for establishing consistency over data incrementally
* [[GReAT]] : a transformation language available in the [[Generic Modeling Environment|GME]]
* Epsilon family (see [http://www.eclipse.org/epsilon]) : a model management platform that provides transformation languages for model-to-model, model-to-text, update-in-place, migration and model merging transformations.
* F-Alloy [http://lightning.gforge.uni.lu]: a [[Domain-specific_language|DSL]] reusing part of the [[Alloy_Analyzer|Alloy]] syntax and allowing the concise specification of efficiently computable model transformations. 
* Henshin (see [https://www.eclipse.org/henshin/]) : a model transformation language for [[Eclipse Modeling Framework|EMF]], based on [[graph rewriting|graph transformation]] concepts, providing state space exploration capabilities
* [[Janus Transformation Language|JTL]] : a bidirectional model transformation language specifically designed to support non-bijective transformations and change propagation (see [http://jtl.di.univaq.it/]).
* [[Kermeta]] : a general purpose modeling and programming language, also able to perform transformations
* Lx family (see [https://archive.is/20120710031939/http://lx.mii.lu.lv/]) : a set of low-level transformation languages
* [[M2M (Eclipse)|M2M]] is the [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] implementation of the [[Object Management Group|OMG]] [[QVT]] standard
* Mia-TL : a transformation language developed by Mia-Software
*[[MOF Model to Text Transformation Language]]: the [[Object Management Group|OMG]] has defined a standard for expressing M2T transformations
* MOLA (see [http://mola.mii.lu.lv/]) : a graphical high-level transformation language built in upon Lx.
* MT : a transformation language developed at King's College, London (UK) (based  on [[Converge PL]])
* [[QVT]] : the [[Object Management Group|OMG]] has defined a standard for expressing M2M transformations, called '''MOF/QVT''' or in short QVT.
* SiTra [http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~bxb/SiTra.html] : a pragmatic transformation approach based on using a standard programming language, e.g. Java, C#
* [[Stratego/XT]] : a transformation language based on rewriting with programmable strategies
* [[Tefkat]] : a transformation language and a model transformation engine
* [[Tom_(pattern_matching_language)|Tom]] : a language based on rewriting calculus, with pattern-matching and strategies
* UML-RSDS [http://www.dcs.kcl.ac.uk/staff/kcl/uml2web/] : a model transformation and MDD approach using UML and OCL
* [[VIATRA]] : a framework for transformation-based verification and validation environment

'''Naval Materials Research Laboratory''' ('''NMRL''') is an [[India]]n defence laboratory of the [[Defence Research and Development Organisation]] (DRDO). Located at Ambernath, in [[Thane]] district, Maharashtra. It develops materials and alloys for Naval use, and is a single-window agency for all materials requirement of the [[Indian Navy]]. NMRL is organized under the Naval Research &amp; Development Directorate of DRDO. The present director of NMRL is Dr Manoranjan Patri.

==History==
NMRL was established in 1953 as the Naval Chemical and Metallurgical Laboratory, an in-house laboratory of the Navy, located at the Naval Dockyard, Mumbai. It was brought under the administrative control of DRDO  in the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.drdo.gov.in/labs/nr%26d/nmrl/history.shtml |title=NMRL Historical Origins |access-date=2008-02-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302224124/http://www.drdo.gov.in/labs/nr%26d/nmrl/history.shtml |archive-date=2008-03-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The laboratory is located in its own technical-cum residential complex at Ambernath, Maharashtra. The laboratory still has its erstwhile infrastructure intact in Naval Dockyard, Mumbai, without any physical scientific or administrative presence.

[[Image:Jalbert2 01.jpg|thumb|200 px|Illustrations from Jalbert's 1966 patent, showing the keels and the airfoil shape.]][[Image:X-38 Ship -2 Landing on Lakebed EC99-45080-101-EDIT1.jpg|thumb|200 px|The [[NASA X-38]] prototype makes a gentle lakebed landing at the end of a July 1999 test flight at the Dryden Flight Research Center.]]

A '''parafoil''' is a nonrigid ([[textile]]) [[airfoil]] with an aerodynamic cell structure which is inflated by the wind. Ram-air inflation forces the parafoil into a classic [[wing]] cross-section. Parafoils are most commonly constructed out of [[ripstop nylon]].

The device was developed in 1964 by [[Domina Jalbert]] (1904–1991). Jalbert had a history of designing kites and was involved in the development of hybrid balloon-kite aerial platforms for carrying scientific instruments. He envisaged the parafoil would be used to suspend an aerial platform or for the recovery of space equipment. A patent was granted in 1966.  

Deployment shock prevented the parafoil's immediate acceptance as a [[parachute]]. It was not until the addition of a '''drag canopy''' on the riser lines (known as a "[[Slider (parachuting)|slider]]") which slowed their spread that the parafoil became a suitable parachute. Compared to a simple [[Parachute#Round|round]] [[Canopy (parachute)|canopy]], a parafoil parachute has greater steerability, will glide further and allows greater control of the rate of descent; the parachute format is mechanically a [[Hang gliding|hang glider]] of the free-flight [[Kite types|kite type]] and such aspects spawned [[Paragliding|paraglider]] use. 

The air flow into the parafoil is coming more from below than the flight path might suggest, so the frontmost ropes tow against the airflow. When gliding, the angle of attack is lowered and the airflow meets the parafoil head on. This makes it difficult to achieve an optimum gliding angle without the parafoil deflating.

In 1984 Jalbert was awarded the [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]] (FAI) Gold Parachuting Medal for inventing the parafoil.

Parafoils see wide use in a variety of [[windsport]]s such as [[kite flying]], [[powered parachute]]s, [[paragliding]], [[kitesurfing]], [[speed flying]], [[wingsuit flying]] and [[skydiving]]. The [[Peter Lynn|world's largest kite]] is a parafoil-variant.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4904">'''Product stewardship''' is where environmental, health, and safety protection centers on the product itself, and everyone involved in the lifespan of the product is called upon to take up responsibility to reduce its environmental, health, and safety impacts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/epr/ The United States Environment Protection Agency]&lt;/ref&gt;  For manufacturers, this includes planning for, and if necessary, paying for the recycling or disposal of the product at the end of its useful life. This may be achieved, in part, by redesigning products to use fewer harmful substances, to be more durable, reusable and recyclable, and to make products from recycled materials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-ncec.com/productstewardship/intro The National Chemical Emergency Centre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070528102118/http://www.the-ncec.com/productstewardship/intro/ |date=2007-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For retailers and consumers, this means taking an active role in ensuring the proper disposal or recycling of an end-of-life product.

Those who advocate it are concerned with the later phases of [[Product lifecycle (marketing)|product lifecycle]] and the [[comprehensive outcome]] of the whole production process.  It is considered a pre-requisite to a strict [[service economy]] interpretation of (fictional, national, legal) "commodity" and "product" relationships.

The most familiar example is the [[container-deposit legislation]].  A fee is paid to buy the bottle, separately from the fee to buy what it contains.  If the bottle is returned, the fee is returned, and the supplier must return the bottle for re-use or [[recycling]].  If not, the collected fee can be used to pay for [[landfill]] or [[litter]] control measures.  Also, since the same fee can be collected by anyone finding and returning the bottle, it is common for people to collect these and return them as a means of surviving.  This is quite common for instance among [[homeless]] people in [[United States|U.S.]] cities.

However, the principle is applied very broadly beyond bottles to [[paint]] and [[automobile]] parts such as [[tire]]s.  When purchasing paint or tires in many places, one simultaneously pays for the disposal of the [[toxic waste]] they become.  In some countries, such as [[Germany]], [[law]] requires attention to the [[comprehensive outcome]] of the whole extraction, production, distribution, use and waste of a product, and holds those profiting from these legally responsible for any outcome along the way.  This is also the trend in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[European Union|EU]] generally.  In the [[United States]], the issue has been confronted via [[class action suit|class action lawsuits]] that attempt to hold companies [[Legal liability|liable]] for the environmental impact of their products.  Thus far, such as [[litigation]] or proposed [[accounting reform]]s such as [[full cost accounting]] have not gained much traction for the product stewardship concept in the United States beyond the realm of [[academe]] and corporate [[public relations]] (derisively referred to as [[greenwashing]]). 

The [[Demand|demand-side]] approach [[ethical consumerism]], supported by consumer education and information about environmental impacts, may approach some of the same outcomes as product stewardship.

== Extended producer responsibility ==

Product Stewardship is often used interchangeably with [[Extended producer responsibility]], a similar concept. However, there are distinct differences between the two, as suggested by the semantics of the different terms used. 

While both concepts bring the onus of waste management for end-of-life products from the government to the manufacturers, Product Stewardship further extends this responsibility to everyone involved in the life-cycle of the product.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilsr.org/recycling/epr/index.html Waste to Wealth] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310194722/http://www.ilsr.org/recycling/epr/index.html |date=2012-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes not only the manufacturers, but also the retailers, consumers and recyclers as well.

'''RPM Nautical Foundation''' is a non-profit [[archaeological]] research and educational organization dedicated to the advancement of [[maritime archaeology]] that includes littoral surveys and excavation of individual [[shipwreck]] and [[harbor]] sites.

RPM Nautical Foundation (RPMNF) is organized to operate exclusively for charitable, scientific, literary and educational purposes, all within the meaning of sections [[Charitable contribution deductions in the United States|170(c)(2) and 501(c)(3)]] of the [[United States Internal Revenue Code]]. The operating purpose of the company is to engage in the detection, identification, study and preservation of nautical archaeological and [[historic site]]s for scientific research, public education, the advancement of technology. The organization also provides fieldwork and training experience in the field to students as well as the personnel and staff of various government, cultural and educational institutions.

Among the goals for RPMNF is the effort to assist [[Mediterranean countries]] with the location, identification, assessment, and research of their submerged cultural material so that these important cultural resources can be protected for future generations.  Accordingly, RPMNF projects are carried out in conjunction with host governments in the Mediterranean and serve as a crucial component in the effort to protect submerged archaeological sites and maritime heritage in association with UNESCO’s efforts to preserve world heritage sites. RPMNF policy stipulates that all artifacts are under the jurisdiction of the host government at all times. The location and assessment of [[Shipwreck|wreck sites]], as well as site and artifact analysis is beneficial to the many governments that RPMNF works with, as it provides cultural authorities pertinent information for protecting archaeological resources.&lt;ref name=Smith2009/&gt;

Over the past decade RPMNF has made advances in maritime archaeology of the littoral region of the Mediterranean through intensive and systematic use of technology. RPMNF’s research vessel, the R/V Hercules, is a purpose-built maritime archaeological platform that has seafloor mapping and three-dimensional modeling capabilities for identification of submerged cultural material sites. The vessel is designed as a self-sufficient base for a wide range of project functions in moderately deep littoral waters, typically limited to 500 m.  These operations include remote sensing equipment that includes autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and various multibeam systems, the deployment of ROVs, data and media processing and other research functions.  Hercules is equipped with a dynamic positioning system and advanced data processing capabilities, as well as adequate deck space and lifting systems to transport and deploy survey equipment.  Potential sites are verified and documented with ROV investigation.  The ROV is employed for video and image documentation, sampling, artifact retrieval, and limited excavation of sites.&lt;ref name=Hvistendahl2011&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hvistendahl, Mara |title=The Adriatic's Uncharted Past |journal=[[Archaeology (magazine)|Archaeology]] |year=2011 |volume=64 |issue=2 |url=http://archive.archaeology.org/1103/features/adriatic_shipwrecks_albania.html |accessdate=2013-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ROV is also employed for the excavation of deep-water sites; an excavation methodological process that RPMNF is helping to advance within the field of [[maritime archaeology]].

RPMNF research vessel R/V ''Hercules'' is Maltese flagged and based in [[Valletta]], Malta during the winter months.  This research vessel can be deployed throughout the Mediterranean on a project basis.

==History==
[[File:RPMNF expedition areas through 2014.png|thumbnail|RPMNF expedition areas through 2014]]
The foundation was established in 2001 by its President, George Robb, who was a Director for the Institute of Nautical Archaeology.  As part of RPMNF's initial foundation, it was establishes as a supporting institute for the Institute of Nautical Archaeology  Early field work centered in Florida and select supporting projects in the Mediterranean.  In 2003, Dr. Jeff Royal became Archaeological Director, then in 2011 took over as Executive Director, during which time RPMNF's focus has centered on the Mediterranean.  At the end of 2010, RPMNF entered into an agreement and is a supporting institute for the Program in Maritime Studies at [[East Carolina University]].  RPMNF continues to grow its associations with Universities, individual scholars, students, and new countries around the Mediterranean.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==Project History==
[[File:Maritimearchaeologistworking.jpg|thumbnail|left]]
RPMNF's cooperative projects have proved successful in the identification, mapping, and recording of shipwreck sites and harbor works from the ancient through modern eras.  To date, project areas include Spain, Albania, Montenegro, Croatia, Malta, Morocco, Cyprus, Sicily, Amalfi and Calabria in Italy, Tunisia, and Turkey.  As all archaeological work is performed in conjunction with the host country’s cultural authority, the one of the crucial outcomes is that the projects assist in both scholarly research and educational projects.  All recovered artifacts remain under the jurisdiction of the host government for educational/research purposes and eventual museum display in each country.  The location and assessment data of wreck sites has proved beneficial to the many governments with which RPMNF have worked as it provides their cultural authorities pertinent information for protecting their submerged archaeological resources.  Bathymetric data is also made available to host country hydrographic departments in order to supplement their oceanographic mapping programs.  RPMNF research vessel Hercules is flagged in Malta, where it based in Valletta during the off-season, and is deployed throughout the Mediterranean on a project basis.

==Publications==
RPMNF Project reports are filed with the appropriate government agency in each country.  Scholarly articles from RPMNF field work are published.

'''''Raḍāʿ''''' or '''''riḍāʿa''''' ({{lang-ar|رضاع, رضاعة}} &amp;nbsp;{{IPA-ar|rɪˈdˤɑːʕ(æ)|pron}}, "breastfeeding") is a [[List of Islamic terms in Arabic|technical term]] from [[Sunni]] [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]] meaning "the suckling which produces the legal impediment to marriage of foster-kinship".&lt;ref&gt;Giladi, ''Infants, Parents and Wet Nurses: Medieval Islamic Views on Breastfeeding and Their Social Implications'', {{ISBN|90-04-11223-5}}, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;  The term derives from the [[infinitive]] noun of the [[Arabic language|Arabic word]] ''radiʿa'' or ''radaʿa'' ("he sucked the breast of his mother").  Often it is translated as "[[fosterage]]" or "[[milk kinship]]".&lt;ref&gt;G. J. H. van Gelder, ''Close Relationships: Incest and Inbreeding in Classical Arabic Literature'', {{ISBN|1-85043-855-2}}, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of ''radāʿ'' derives from Islamic and [[pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic]] [[Islam and children#Breast-feeding|notions]] concerning the state of [[consanguinity]] created between [[wet nurse]] and unrelated nursling—that is, a woman and a baby other than her own—through the act of [[breastfeeding]].  ''Radāʿ'' also defines the links between various relations and family members of both wet nurse and baby, such that not only are the two [[Mahram|forbidden in marriage]] to one another, but so are their relations in various combination (e.g. the nursling's biological brother with the milk-mother's biological daughter).  Conversely, the milk-relationship allows usually forbidden familiarities between the two, particularly if the nursling is male and of adult stature, such as viewing the milk-mother [[Hijab|unveiled]] or [[Sex segregation in Islam|in private]], exactly as if he were a relation.{{Original research inline|date=April 2008}}

== In Islamic law ==
=== Sunni ===
''Radāʿ'' receives extensive treatment in the Islamic jurisprudence (''[[fiqh]]'') of the classical jurists (''[[Faqīh|faqih]]'').  A primary feature of such works is the delineation of which relationships are [[Harām|subject to prohibition]] once the milk relationship is established.  The following are the sorts of questions directed to the founder of the [[Hanbali]] [[Madhhab|school of jurisprudence]] by his son:

{{cquote|
I asked [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal|my father]] about a man who has two wives, each of whom has a daughter.  Then one of the wives nurses a certain man.  'Is it [[Halal|lawful]] for this man's son to marry the daughter of the wife who did not nurse him?'  (...) I asked my father about a man who has a wife who nurses both a youth and a girl, and the youth has a brother.  'Is it lawful for the brother to marry the girl?' (...)  I hear my father asked about a woman who nurses a young female slave belonging to someone else.   Then a certain man marries the woman who has nursed the young female slave.  'Is it lawful for the man to have intercourse with the [[Islamic views on slavery|female slave]] his wife has nursed if he buys and takes [[Ma malakat aymanukum|possession of her]]?'&lt;ref&gt;Giladi, ''Infants, Parents and Wet Nurses'', p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Other common topics included the following:

* ''laban al-fahl'', "milk of the sire", as under Islam the wet nurse's husband is considered the actual owner of her milk (it is his semen which caused the pregnancy that stimulated her lactation), which ties of consanguinity exist between his relations and the nursling?
* ''sifat al-radāʿ al-muharrim'', "quality of the milk", which ways of transmission create consanguinity?
* '' ʿadad al-radāʿ al-muharrim'', minimal number of sucklings necessary to establish fosterage;
* ''radāʿ al-kabīr'', suckling of a grown-up person, the maximum age at which the milk-relationship may be established;
* ''al-radāʿ min mayyita'', whether or not the absorption of milk from a dead woman creates the impediment.

''ʿAdad al-radāʿ al-muharrim'', or minimal number of sucklings necessary to establish the milk-kinship, was the subject of extensive debate and ever more elaborate [[Tafsīr|exegetical theorizing]].  For the adherents of older [[Madhhab|schools of law]], such as the [[Maliki]]s and [[Hanafi]]s, one suckling was enough.  Others, such as the [[Shafiʿi|Shāfi'ī]]s, maintained that the minimum number was five or ten, and that in fact a [[Qur'ān|Qur'ainic]] verse had once stipulated this exact number until [[Naskh (tafsir)#Modes|its wording]] had been [[Naskh (tafsir)|expurgated]] from the [[mushaf|Qur'ānic text]]&lt;ref&gt;John Burton, ''The Sources of Islamic Law: Islamic Theories of Abrogation'', {{ISBN|0-7486-0108-2}}, pp. 156-158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burton, ''[[Naskh (tafsir)|Naskh]]'', [[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]²&lt;/ref&gt;  The following tradition (''[[Hadīth|hadith]]'') treats both this topic as well as that of ''radāʿ al-kabīr'', or suckling of an adult:

{{cquote|
She [Aisha] [[Isnad|reported]] that 'in what was revealed of the Qur'ān, ten attested breast-feedings were mentioned as required to establish the marriage-ban.  The ten were replaced by mention of five attested breast-feeds.  The [[Muhammad|Prophet]] died and the five were still being recited in the Qur'ān.  No man ever called upon [[Aisha|'Ā'isha]] who had not completed the minimum number of five sucklings'...

[[Urwah ibn Zubayr|Urwa b. al-Zubayr]] reports that the Prophet commanded the wife of Abū Hudhayfa to feed her husband's [[mawla|mawlā]] [i.e. servant], Sālim, so that he could go on living with them [upon attaining manhood]. Sāalim b. 'Abdullāh reports that he was never able to visit 'Ā'isha.  She had sent him to be suckled by her sister [[Umm Kulthum (name)|Umm Kulthum]] who, however, suckled him only three times, then fell sick.  Sālim added, 'Thus I never did complete the course of ten sucklings.'&lt;ref&gt;John Burton, ''The Sources of Islamic Law: Islamic Theories of Abrogation'', pp. 157&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

For most jurists ([[Ibn Hazm]] being one prominent exception), the bar to marriage was effective only if the nursling was an infant.  Yet even these allowed that a new relationship resulted between the two; [[Ibn Rushd]], for example, ruled that the woman could now comport herself more freely in front of the nursed adult male, such as appearing before him [[hijab|unveiled]].&lt;ref&gt;Giladi, ''Infants, Parents and Wet Nurses'', p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; The famous [[Muhaddith|traditionist]] [[Muhammad al-Bukhari]] was forced to resign his position of ''[[mufti]]'' and leave the city of [[Bukhara]] after ruling that two nurslings who suckled from the same farm animal became milk-siblings.&lt;ref&gt;Giladi, ''Infants, Parents and Wet Nurses'', p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shia ===
As per Quranic guidelines, non-mahram (not related) people are forbidden for each other as long as they are not legally married. Shi'ite Islam prohibits marriage to the consanguineous kin of a milk-parent. In Shi'ite societies, the wet nurse was always from a subordinate group, so that marriage to her kin would not have been likely.

== Examples ==
=== Egypt ===
In May 2007 Dr. Izzat Atiyya, lecturer at [[Cairo]]'s [[Al-Azhar University]], issued a ''[[fatwa]]'' that suggested that male and female colleagues could use breastfeeding to get around a religious ban on being alone together.  The ''fatwa'' said that if a woman fed a male colleague "directly from her breast" at least five times they would establish a family bond and thus be allowed to be alone together at work. "Breast feeding an adult puts an end to the problem of the private meeting, and does not ban marriage," he ruled. "A woman at work can take off the veil or reveal her hair in front of someone whom she breastfed."&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/6681511.stm Breastfeeding fatwa causes stir]''. BBC. May 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''fatwa'' sparked outrage and embarrassment, with critics deriding the author on [[Egyptian television]]. The university suspended the lecturer, who headed the university's ''[[hadith]]'' department.  The ''fatwa'' was widely publicized by Arabic-language [[satellite television]] channels and was discussed in the [[Parliament of Egypt|Egyptian parliament]].&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;''[http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKL2173061220070521 Lecturer suspended after breastfeeding fatwa]''. Reuters. May 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  After being threatened with disciplinary action by the university, Atiyya issued a retraction, saying the ''fatwa'' was "a bad interpretation of a particular case" during the time of Muhammad&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; and that it was based on the opinions of only a minority of scholars.&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt;  Egypt's minister of religious affairs, [[Mahmoud Zaqzouq]], has called for future ''fatwas'' to "be compatible with logic and human nature".&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

=== Saudi Arabia ===
In 2010, a clerical adviser to the Royal court and Ministry of Justice issued a [[fatwa]] suggesting that women should provide breast milk to their employed drivers thereby making them relatives (a concept known as ''Rada'').&lt;ref name=Shaheen&gt;{{Cite news|last=Shaheen|first=Abdul Rahman|title=Saudi women use fatwa in driving bid|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/saudi-arabia/saudi-women-use-fatwa-in-driving-bid-1.643431|accessdate=19 September 2010|newspaper=gulfnews.com|date=20 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The driver could then be trusted to be alone with the woman. The fatwa was ridiculed by women campaigners.

Scan lines are important in representations of image data, because many [[image file format]]s have special rules for data at the end of a scan line. For example, there may be a rule that each scan line starts on a particular boundary (such as a byte or word; see for example [[BMP file format]]). This means that even otherwise compatible raster data may need to be analyzed at the level of scan lines in order to convert between formats.

'''Shamanic music''' is music played either by actual shamans as part of their rituals, or by people who, whilst not themselves shamans, wish to evoke the cultural background of [[shamanism]] in some way. So '''Shamanic music''' includes both music used as part of shamans' rituals and music that refers to, or draws on, this.

In shamanism the shaman has a more active musical role than the medium in [[spirit possession]]. But a shaman's ritual is a ritual performance and not a musical performance, and this shapes its musical dimension. A shaman uses various ways of making sounds to which different ritual purposes are ascribed. Of particular importance are the shaman's song and shaman's drumming.

Recently in [[Indigenous peoples of Siberia|Siberia]], music groups drawing on a knowledge of shamanic culture have emerged. In the West shamanism has served as an imagined background to musics meant to [[altered state of consciousness|alter a listener's state of mind]].

[[Culture of Korea|Korea]] and [[Tibetan culture|Tibet]] are two cultures where the music of shamanic ritual has interacted closely with other traditions.

[[File:Gitksan man.jpg|thumb|right|Gitksan shaman with rattle]]

== Shamanic and musical performance ==

Although shamans use singing as well as drumming and sometimes other instruments, a shamanic ritual is not a musical performance in the normal sense, and the music is directed more to [[spirits]] than to an audience. Several things follow from this. First, a shamanic ritual performance is, above all, a series of actions and not a series of musical sounds.&lt;ref&gt;Mihály Hoppál, ''Tracing Shamanism in Tuva: A History of Studies'', in Mongush Kenin Lopsan,  ''Shamanic Songs and Myths of Tuva'', Istor Budapest 1997 p 129 "...the struggle with the harmful spirits during which great drumbeats indicated that the shaman had driven a "steel arrow" for each beat into the spirits of sickness."&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the shaman's attention is directed inwards towards her or his visualisation of the spirit world and communication with the spirits, and not outwards to any listeners who might be present.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Hodgkinson, ''Musicians, Carvers, Shamans'', Cambridge Anthropology vol 25, no 3, (2005/2006) p 9."Sergei Tumat (a Tuvan shaman who had previously studied music):   “When I shamanize, I'm not here, not in the place where I'm playing the dungur drum, it's just  my material body that's there: I'm away with the spirits, that's where my total attention is. If someone touches me, tries to get my attention there in the yurt, that's dangerous, it  would be like falling a long way: so it's completely different from playing music to an  audience, where you have to be there, to be attentive to what your material body is  doing, to everything I learned in music school...”"&lt;/ref&gt; Third, it is important for the success of the ritual that it be given its own clearly defined context that is quite different from any kind of entertainment. Fourth, any theatrical elements that are added to impress an audience are of a type to make the contact with the spirits seem more real and not to suggest the performer's musical virtuosity. From a musical perspective shamanic ritual performances have the distinctive feature of {{wt|en|discontinuity}}. Breaks may happen because a spirit is proving difficult to communicate with, or the shaman needs to call a different spirit. Typically, phases of the performance are broken off abruptly, perhaps to be restarted after a gap, perhaps not.&lt;ref&gt;Carole Pegg, ''Mongolian Music, Dance and Oral Narrative'', University of Washington Press, 2001, p135-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Hutton, ''The Shamans of Siberia'', Isle of Avalon Press, 1993, p29 and p31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Humphrey, ''Shamans and elders''. Oxford, OUP1996,  p 235-7&lt;/ref&gt; The rhythmic dimension of the music of shamans' rituals has been connected to the idea of both incorporating the rhythms of nature and magically re-articulating them.&lt;ref&gt;Carlo Serra, (in Italian)''Ritmo e ciclità nella cultura sciamanica'', in Antonello Colimberti (ed) ''Musiche e sciamani'', Textus, Milan 2000, p67&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shamanism and possession ==

It has been argued&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Rouget, ''Music and Trance'', University of Chicago Press 1985 p125&lt;/ref&gt; that shamanism and [[spirit possession]] involve contrasting kinds of special states of mind. The shaman actively enters the spirit world, negotiates with her or his own helper spirit and then with other spirits as necessary, and moves between different territories of the spirit world. The possessed medium, on the other hand,  is the passive recipient of a powerful spirit or god. This reflects on the different uses of music involved. Possession music&lt;ref&gt;Fremont E.Besmer, ''Horses, Musicians and Gods: The Hausa Cult of Possession-Trance''.  Ahmadu Bello UP 1983&lt;/ref&gt; is typically long in duration, [[Hypnosis|mesmeric]], loud and intense, with climaxes of rhythmic intensity and volume to which the medium has learned to respond by entering a trance state: the music is not played by the medium but by one or more musicians. In shamanism, the music is played by the shaman, confirms the shaman's power (in the words of the shaman's song), and is used actively by the shaman to modulate movements and changes of state as part of an active journey within the spirit world. In both cases the connection between music and an [[altered state of mind]] depends on both psychoacoustic and cultural factors, and the music cannot be said to 'cause' trance-states.&lt;ref&gt;Roberte Hamayon,(in French) ''Pour en finir avec la 'trance' et 'l'extase' dans l'étude du chamanisme'', in Etudes mongoles et sibériennes 26: Variations Chamaniques 2, 1995, p155 seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use of sounds ==
{{See also|Sound mimesis in various cultures|Imitation of sounds in shamanism}}

Sound is tactile; whereas visual information is experienced at the surface, auditory information seems to be both outside and inside the body.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Ong, ''Orality and Literacy: The technologizing of the word'', Methuen, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Sound mimesis in various cultures|In oral cultures in which survival involves close contact with nature, sound often connects inner feelings to features of the natural environment]]. In many cases, this holds also for the [[Imitation of sounds in shamanism|music in shamanistic practice, including e.g. onomatopoeia, imitation of animal cries etc.]]. The shaman's use of sound is to catalyse an imaginary inner environment which is experienced as a sacred space-time in which the shaman travels and encounters spirits.  Sound, passing constantly between inner and outer, connects this imaginary space with the actual space of the ritual in which the shaman is moving and making ritual actions and gestures.

It has been suggested that the sound material used by the shaman constitutes a system of sounds.&lt;ref&gt;Massimo Ruggero, (in Italian)  ''La musica sciamanica'' . - Xenia - 2004, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; This idea of a [[semiotics]] of the sound material would imply a symbolic language shared between the shaman and the surrounding community. However, the evidence suggests that any symbolic language elements are understood only by the shaman and perhaps by other shamans initiated by this shaman. In other words, the symbolic language - if there is one - is more likely to be shared with the spirits than with a human community.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Taussig,  ''The Nervous System'' . - Routledge - 1992 p.177&lt;/ref&gt;

A shaman may use different sounds for different ritual purposes: 
*'''Setting up the sound-space of the ritual''' 
A very important element in [[Shamanism in Siberia|Siberian shamanism]] is the use of hanging metallic objects - possibly including small bells - attached to the shaman's ritual cloak and to the inside of the drum and also sometimes to the beater. This sets up a continuously moving sound field, heard as a single complex sound.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Stiller, ''Handbook of Instrumentation'', University of California Press, 1985, p 121, {{ISBN|0-520-04423-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further element is the spatialisation of sound brought about not only by the shaman's movement, but also by techniques of singing into the drum to create the illusion of the voice coming from elsewhere. Different individual shamans and different local traditions may use different sounds. For example, in the south of Tuva and in Mongolia the ''khomus'', or jaw harp is commonly used in shamanising.&lt;ref&gt;Carole Pegg, ''Mongolian Music, Dance and Oral Narrative'', University of Washington Press, 2001, p124&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Preparation'''
Particular sounds, like bells, may be used for purifying the place in which the ritual is to be performed.&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn Walker, ''Music as Knowledge in Shamanism and Other Healing Traditions of Siberia'', in
Arctic Anthropology.2003; 40(2): p45&lt;/ref&gt; This is because a ritual involving contact with the spirits is always potentially dangerous, and one of the dangers is that of pollution.

*'''Calling and sending back spirits'''
A bell may also be used for calling or sending back spirits.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Kongin Seo, ''Hanyang Kut: Korean Shaman Ritual Music from Seoul'', Routledge 2002 p14&lt;/ref&gt; Shamans will also imitate the sounds of birds and animals in order to call spirits.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Levin, ''Where Rivers and Mountains Sing'',  (Indiana University Press 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Sami shamanic singing, called [[Joik]], is also about summoning, for example, animal spirits, rather than singing about them or representing them: the spirit is experienced as being present.&lt;ref&gt;Tina Ramnarine, ''Acoustemology, Indigeneity &amp; Joik'', Ethnomusicology vol 53, no 2, spring/summer 2009, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Healing'''
Within shamanic ritual, sound can also be used as a healing power, conceived as a way of directing spiritual energy from the shaman into an afflicted person.&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn Walker, 2003, p46&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Tuva]] sick persons are said to have been healed by the sound of a stringed instrument made from a tree struck by lightning.

== Shaman's song ==

The '''shaman's song''' - or ''algysh'' &lt;ref&gt;Mongush Kenin Lopsan, ''Shamanic Songs and Myths of Tuva'' Istor Budapest 1997&lt;/ref&gt; in Tuvan - is personal to the shaman&lt;ref&gt;Mihály Hoppál, ''Studies on Eurasian Shamanism'' in ''Shamans and Cultures''  in Mihály Hoppál and Keith Howard eds pp258-288 Istor Budapest 1993&lt;/ref&gt; and tells of her or his birthplace, initiation, ancestral pedigree, special gifts and special connections to particular spirits. The melody and words are composed by the shaman and generally remain the same throughout the shaman's professional life.  The ''algysh'' is often sung near the beginning of the ritual and accompanied by drumming on the dungur drum. It serves to remind the shaman of their shamanic identity and power. It proclaims the shaman's abilities and announces the shaman to the spirits. In some traditions the shaman's song may be broken up into short sections, varied and recombined in different performances.&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Humphrey, ''Shamans and elders''. Oxford, OUP1996,  p 235&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shaman's drum ==

The single headed frame [[frame drum|'''drum''']]  is widely used in shamanic ritual, often with metallic ritual objects dangling inside, held by an interior wooden cross-piece, and played with a special beater that may also itself be a rattle.&lt;ref&gt;Ken Hyder, ''Shamanism and Music in Siberia :  DRUM AND SPACE'' {{cite web |url=http://www.soas.ac.uk/musicanddance/projects/project6/essays/file45912.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622115511/http://www.soas.ac.uk/musicanddance/projects/project6/essays/file45912.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The drum will be made of consecrated materials, a specially chosen tree and the skin of a carefully chosen animal, sometimes by a specialist drum-maker. It will also have been 'enlivened' usually by a more powerful shaman so as to give it its spiritual properties.&lt;ref&gt;Carole Pegg, ''Mongolian Music, Dance and Oral Narrative'', University of Washington Press, 2001 p128&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sevyan Vainshtein, ''The Tuvan Shaman's Drum and the ceremony of its Enlivening'', in V.Dioszegi (ed), ''Popular Beliefs and Folklore in Siberia'', Bloomington 1968&lt;/ref&gt; The head is sometimes decorated with a graphic typically representing the [[Religious cosmology|division of the cosmos into upper, middle and lower worlds]].  A shamanic ritual often begins with heating the drum head over a fire to bring it up to the desired pitch. A number of theories have been advanced to explain the importance of percussion in ritual music in general.&lt;ref&gt;Damian Walter, ''The Medium of the Message: Shamanism as Localised Practice in the Nepal Himalayas'' in ''The Archaeology of Shamanism'', ed Neil Price, Routledge 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rodney Needham, ''Percussion and Transition'', Man 2:606-14. 1967&lt;/ref&gt;  One line of explanation is [[psychoacoustics|psychoacoustic]], whereby the tempo of the drum enables the shaman to enter the desired brain wave state, which corresponds to the number of beats per second of the drum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earthlove.org/ECSTATIC%20TRANCE.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105162700/http://www.earthlove.org/ECSTATIC%20TRANCE.pdf |archivedate=2009-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the case of shamanism, it seems that the portable drum is highly suited for a performance in which action and gesture are the top line.&lt;ref&gt;Roberte Hamayon, (in French)''Gestes et Sons, Chamane et Barde'',   in ''Chamanisme et Possession, Cahiers de Musiques Traditionelles 19'', Ateliers d'Ethnomusicologie, Genève, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The physical gesture of playing the drum is often integrated into a shamanic dance. For this reason the drumming is not restricted to regular tempo but may speed up and slow down with irregular accents.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Hodgkinson, ''Siberian shamanism and improvised music'', Contemporary Music Review vol 14, parts 1-2, Netherlands, Harwood,1996, p62.&lt;/ref&gt; In some regions, the skin of a shaman's drum should be cut after his/her death.&lt;ref&gt;Mongush Kenin Lopsan,  ''Shamanic Songs and Myths of Tuva'' Istor Budapest 1997  p121&lt;/ref&gt; In others, not.&lt;ref&gt;Vilmos Diószegi,  ''Tracing Shamans in Siberia'' Anthropological Publications, Netherlands 1968, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shamanic groups ==

From the late 1980s with the loosening up of political restrictions a number of Siberian native cultures underwent a cultural renaissance, shamans began to practice openly again, and musicians formed '''bands''' drawing on shamanic traditions. Cholbon&lt;ref&gt;Henri Lecomte,(in French) ''Approches Autochtones du Chamanisme Sibérien au début du XXI Siècle'',  in ''Chamanisme et Possession, Cahiers de Musiques Traditionelles 19'', Ateliers d'Ethnomusicologie, Genève, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and AiTal,&lt;ref&gt;Aimar Ventsel, ''Sakha Pop Music'' p.10 http://www.princeton.edu/~restudy/soyuz_papers/Ventsel.pdf{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Sakha/Yakutsk, Biosyntes and early [[Yat-Kha]] in Tuva fall into this category. Nevertheless, the musicians involved, if sometimes unsure of their own exact role, recognized an important difference between artists using shamanic themes and shamans themselves. In the West bands began to apply the label 'shamanic' loosely to any music that might induce a trance state.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Howard, ''Sonic Transformations of  Shamanic Representations''  in AHRP Research Centre Newsletter 4, SOAS 2004, p19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terence McKenna, ''The Archaic revival''  Harper Collins 1991&lt;/ref&gt; This was partly due to the rarity of actual recordings of shamans' rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Rouget, ''Music and Trance'', University of Chicago Press 1985 p130&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the British-Tuvan group [[K-Space (band)|K-Space]] developed ways of combining improvisation, electronics and experimental recording and montage techniques with the more shamanic side of Tuvan traditional music. In Hungary [[Galloping Coroners|Vágtázó Halottkémek]]&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Milun quotes Anna Szemere: ''Up From the Underground - The Culture of Rock Music in Postsocialist Hungary'' Penn State Press 2001, http://www.pum.umontreal.ca/revues/surfaces/vol1/milun.html&lt;/ref&gt;(in English: Galloping Coroners) later [[Galloping Wonder Stag|Vágtázó Csodaszarvas]] set out under the banner of shamanpunk  to use ethnographic materials as manuals on how to reach and communicate ecstatic states. From 2005 Vágtázó Csodaszarvas (Galloping Wonder Stag) continued Vágtázó Halottkémek music philosophy turning it into a neotraditional music style closer to world music, replacing electronic guitars and drums with acoustic volk instruments.

== Korean shamanic music ==
{{See also|Korean shamanism}}

'''[[Korea]]''' is the only country where shamanism appears to have been a state religion practiced by the literate classes, during the Three Kingdoms Period (57BC-668AD). Under successive dynasties shamanism was gradually relegated to a popular or folk status with the arrival of Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism. The early official status of shamanism is the probable explanation for the fact that shamanic ritual in Korea developed highly complex and established forms. Correspondingly the music used in shamanic rituals is more elaborate in Korea than elsewhere. Furthermore, since the emergence of Korean contemporary nationalism, there has been a strong and sustained state intervention to preserve artistic traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Howard, ''Perspectives on Korean Music: Preserving Korean Music: Intangible Cultural Properties as Icons of Identity'' v. 1 (SOAS Musicology Series) 2006&lt;/ref&gt; All of these factors make it uniquely difficult in Korea to distinguish the 'pure' from hybrid and concert forms of shamanic ritual music. For example, ''[[Sinawi]]'' is a musical form that can be used in shamanic rituals, or to accompany folk dances, or for urban concert performance. In the ritual context ''Sinawi'' is often performed by a small ensemble with the ''changgo'' hour-glass drum and two melodic instruments, often the ''taegum'' flute and the ''[[piri]]'' oboe. In concert the ensemble is augmented with stringed instruments&lt;ref&gt;Kyo-Chul Chung  CD notes for ''Seoul Ensemble of Traditional Music'' World Network 12, WDR 54.039.&lt;/ref&gt;   Modern ''Sinawi'' is played in a minor mode in 12/8 time.&lt;ref&gt;CD notes for''A selection of Korean traditional music, volume 2''. Instrumental Music 2, SBCD-4380-2&lt;/ref&gt; The role of music in Korean shamanism seems intermediary between the possession trance model and the Siberian model: in the ''Kut'' ritual, the music, played by musicians, first calls on the god to possess the ''mudang'' (shaman), then accompanies the god during their time in the shaman's body, then sends back and placates the god at the end.&lt;ref&gt;''Shamanism, The Spirit World of Korea'', eds Chai-shin Yu and R.Guisso, Asian Humanities Press, Berkeley California 1988&lt;/ref&gt; However, the shaman is the singer and dancer and the shaman directs the musicians.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Bo Hyeong CD notes for Kim Suk Chul Ensemble: ''Shamanistic Ceremonies of the Eastern Seaboard'',  JVC, VICG-5261 (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bön shamanic music and Buddhist music ==

Before Buddhism came to Tibet, the local form of shamanism was '''[[Bön]]'''.  Bön developed into an organised religion. When Buddhism arrived, both religions began competing with each other, and incorporated many of each other's practices. The Bön shaman's drum on a pole became part of Tibetan Buddhist ritual music ensembles. Also, the shang - a kind of bell-cymbal - became incorporated in Buddhist rituals. It was formerly only used by shamans to clear away negative energy before shamanic rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret J. Kartomi ''On concepts and classifications of musical instruments''University of Chicago Press, 1990 pp 75-83 {{ISBN|978-0-226-42549-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frankperry.co.uk/Tibetan%20Bowls.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216183730/http://frankperry.co.uk/Tibetan%20Bowls.htm |archivedate=2009-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thepathoflight.it/worken.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613215026/http://www.thepathoflight.it/worken.php |archivedate=2010-06-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The practice of giving a sonorous identity to deities, of calling them and sending them back by means of sounds, may well have entered Tibetan Buddhist ritual from Bön tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Mireille Helffer (in French)''Traditions musicales dans un monastère du Bouddhisme Tibétain'' in ''L'Homme 171-2'', Paris 2004 pp 183-184&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spaltklang''' (literally: ''split sound'') is a term in [[music theory]]. It is defined as an extremely clear and transparent sound pattern of an [[instrumental piece]]. It stands in opposition to the music of the Classical-Romantic period which favoured the merging of the individual instrumental voices to one complex sound.

Examples of applied Spaltklang can be found in [[New Music]] such as [[Igor Stravinsky]]’s [[Histoire du soldat]]. Instrumental categories are represented by the high- and low-[[Pitch (music)|pitch]]ed instruments; middle-toned instruments, on the other hand, are not accounted for. In the [[string section]], for instance, only [[violin]] and [[double bass]] are represented, while [[viola]] and [[cello]] are not. This pitch gap creates a clear contrast and prevents the individual tones from merging into one sound.

Moreover, the term appears in connection with [[multiphonics]].

The term Spaltklang can also be found in the field of [[organ building]]. Here, it refers to organs that have [[Register (phonology)|registers]] with very different and distinct [[timbres]]. Therefore, single registers tend to be played in isolation. This is in contrast to organs which operate on the basis of a merged sound, which is achieved by adding registers to a [[root note]]. Spaltklang seems to be particularly associated with organs from the [[Renaissance]] period. Amongst organists, Spaltklang is furthermore used to describe the omission of a register, e.g. playing the 8‘ and 2’ registers but omitting the 4’ register.

'''Structural genomics''' seeks to describe the [[Protein Structure|3-dimensional structure]] of every protein encoded by a given [[genome]]. This genome-based approach allows for a high-throughput method of structure determination by a combination of [[protein structure prediction|experimental and modeling approaches]]. The principal difference between structural genomics and [[protein structure prediction|traditional structural prediction]] is that structural genomics attempts to determine the structure of every protein encoded by the genome, rather than focusing on one particular protein. With full-genome sequences available, structure prediction can be done more quickly through a combination of experimental and modeling approaches, especially because the availability of large number of sequenced genomes and previously solved protein structures allows scientists to model protein structure on the structures of previously solved homologs.

Because protein structure is closely linked with protein function, the structural genomics has the potential to inform knowledge of protein function. In addition to elucidating protein functions, structural genomics can be used to identify novel protein folds and potential targets for drug discovery. Structural genomics involves taking a large number of approaches to structure determination, including experimental methods using genomic sequences or modeling-based approaches based on sequence or [[homology modeling|structural homology]] to a protein of known structure or based on chemical and physical principles for a protein with no homology to any known structure.

As opposed to traditional [[structural biology]], the determination of a [[protein structure]] through a structural genomics effort often (but not always) comes before anything is known regarding the protein function. This raises new challenges in [[structural bioinformatics]], i.e. determining protein function from its [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] structure.

Structural genomics emphasizes high throughput determination of protein structures. This is performed in dedicated [[Protein Structure Initiative#External links|centers of structural genomics]].

While most structural biologists pursue structures of individual proteins or protein groups, specialists in structural genomics pursue structures of proteins on a genome wide scale. This implies large-scale cloning, expression and purification. One main advantage of this approach is economy of scale. On the other hand, the scientific value of some resultant structures is at times questioned. A ''Science'' article from January 2006 analyzes the structural genomics field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chandonia JM, Brenner SE |title=The impact of structural genomics: expectations and outcomes |journal=Science |volume=311 |issue=5759 |pages=347–51 |date=January 2006 |pmid=16424331 |doi=10.1126/science.1121018 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/311/5759/347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One advantage of structural genomics, such as the [[Protein Structure Initiative]], is that the scientific community gets immediate access to new structures, as well as to reagents such as clones and protein. A disadvantage is that many of these structures are of proteins of unknown function and do not have corresponding publications. This requires new ways of communicating this structural information to the broader research community. The Bioinformatics core of the Joint center for structural genomics (JCSG) has recently developed a wiki-based approach namely [[Open protein structure annotation network]] (TOPSAN) for annotating protein structures emerging from high-throughput structural genomics centers.

== Goals==
One goal of structural genomics is to identify novel protein folds. Experimental methods of protein structure determination require proteins that express and/or crystallize well, which may inherently bias the kinds of proteins folds that this experimental data elucidate. A genomic, modeling-based approach such as [[de novo protein structure prediction|''ab initio'' modeling]] may be better able to identify novel protein folds than the experimental approaches because they are not limited by experimental constraints.

Protein function depends on 3-D structure and these 3-D structures are more highly conserved than [[peptide sequence|sequences]]. Thus, the high-throughput structure determination methods of structural genomics have the potential to inform our understanding of protein functions.  This also has potential implications for drug discovery and protein engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kuhn P, Wilson K, Patch MG, Stevens RC |title=The genesis of high-throughput structure-based drug discovery using protein crystallography |journal=Curr Opin Chem Biol |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=704–10 |date=October 2002 |pmid=12413557 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1367593102003617 |doi=10.1016/S1367-5931(02)00361-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, every protein that is added to the structural database increases the likelihood that the database will include homologous sequences of other unknown proteins. The [[Protein Structure Initiative]] (PSI) is a multifaceted effort funded by the [[National Institutes of Health]] with various academic and industrial partners that aims to increase knowledge of protein structure using a structural genomics approach and to improve structure-determination methodology.

== Methods ==
Structural genomics takes advantage of completed genome sequences in several ways in order to determine protein structures.  The gene sequence of the target protein can also be compared to a known sequence and structural information can then be inferred from the known protein’s structure. Structural genomics can be used to predict novel protein folds based on other structural data.  Structural genomics can also take modeling-based approach that relies on homology between the unknown protein and a solved protein structure.

=== ''de novo'' methods ===
Completed genome sequences allow every [[open reading frame]] (ORF), the part of a gene that is likely to contain the sequence for the [[messenger RNA]] and protein, to be cloned and expressed as protein. These proteins are then purified and crystallized, and then subjected to one of two types of structure determination: [[X-ray crystallography]] and [[Protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR).  The whole genome sequence allows for the design of every primer required in order to amplify all of the ORFs, clone them into bacteria, and then express them.  By using a whole-genome approach to this traditional method of protein structure determination, all of the proteins encoded by the genome can be expressed at once.  This approach allows for the structural determination of every protein that is encoded by the genome.

=== Modelling-based methods===

==== ''ab initio''  modeling====
This approach uses protein sequence data and the chemical and physical interactions of the encoded amino acids to predict the 3-D structures of proteins with no homology to solved protein structures. One highly successful method for ''ab initio'' modeling is the [[Rosetta@home|Rosetta]] program, which divides the protein into short segments and arranges short polypeptide chain into a low-energy local conformation.  Rosetta is available for commercial use and for non-commercial use through its public program, Robetta.

====Sequence-based modeling====
This modeling technique compares the gene sequence of an unknown protein with sequences of proteins with known structures. Depending on the degree of similarity between the sequences, the structure of the known protein can be used as a model for solving the structure of the unknown protein. Highly accurate modeling is considered to require at least 50% amino acid sequence identity between the unknown protein and the solved structure. 30-50% sequence identity gives a model of intermediate-accuracy, and sequence identity below 30% gives low-accuracy models.  It has been predicted that at least 16,000 protein structures will need to be determined in order for all structural motifs to be represented at least once and thus allowing the structure of any unknown protein to be solved accurately through modeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Baker D, Sali A |title=Protein structure prediction and structural genomics |journal=Science |volume=294 |issue=5540 |pages=93–6 |date=October 2001 |pmid=11588250 |doi=10.1126/science.1065659 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11588250}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One disadvantage of this method, however, is that structure is more conserved than sequence and thus 	sequence-based modeling may not be the most accurate way to predict protein structures.

====Threading====
[[Threading (protein sequence)|Threading]] bases structural modeling on fold similarities rather than sequence identity.  This method may help identify distantly related proteins and can be used to infer molecular functions.

== Examples of structural genomics ==
There are currently a number of on-going efforts to solve the structures for every protein in a given proteome.

===''Thermotogo maritima'' proteome===
One current goal of the [[Joint Center for Structural Genomics]] (JCSG), a part of the [[Protein Structure Initiative]] (PSI) is to solve the structures for all the proteins in ''[[Thermotoga|Thermotogo maritima]]'', a thermophillic bacterium. ''T. maritima'' was selected as a structural genomics target based on its relatively small genome consisting of 1,877 genes and the hypothesis that the proteins expressed by a thermophilic bacterium would be easier to crystallize.

Lesley ''et al'' used ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' to express all the open-reading frames (ORFs) of ''T. martima''. These proteins were then crystallized and structures were determined for successfully crystallized proteins using X-ray crystallography.  Among other structures, this structural genomics approach allowed for the determination of the structure of the TM0449 protein, which was found to exhibit a novel fold as it did not share structural homology with any known protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Lesley SA, Kuhn P, Godzik A, etal |title=Structural genomics of the Thermotoga maritima proteome implemented in a high-throughput structure determination pipeline |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=99 |issue=18 |pages=11664–9 |date=September 2002 |pmid=12193646 |pmc=129326 |doi=10.1073/pnas.142413399 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12193646}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'' proteome===
The goal of the [[Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Structural Genomics Consortium|TB Structural Genomics Consortium]] is to determine the structures of potential drug targets in ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'', the bacterium that causes tuberculosis. The development of novel drug therapies against tuberculosis are particularly important given the growing problem of [[multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis]].

The fully sequenced genome of ''M. tuberculosis'' has allowed scientists to clone many of these protein targets into expression vectors for purification and structure determination by X-ray crystallography.  Studies have identified a number of target proteins for structure determination, including extracellular proteins that may be involved in pathogenesis, iron-regulatory proteins, current drug targets, and proteins predicted to have novel folds. So far, structures have been determined for 708 of the proteins encoded by ''M. tuberculosis''.

'''Temporal logic of actions''' ('''TLA''') is a logic developed by [[Leslie Lamport]], which combines [[temporal logic]] with a [[logic of action]]s.
It is used to describe behaviours of [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrent systems]].

== Details ==
Statements in temporal logic are of the form &lt;math&gt;[A]_t&lt;/math&gt;, where ''A'' is an action and ''t'' contains a subset of the variables appearing in ''A''. An action is an expression containing primed and non-primed variables, such as &lt;math&gt;x+x'*y=y'&lt;/math&gt;. The meaning of the non-primed variables is ''the variable's value in this state''. The meaning of primed variables is ''the variable's value in the next state''.
The above expression means the value of ''x'' ''today'', plus the value of ''x'' ''tomorrow'' times the value of y ''today'', equals the value of ''y'' ''tomorrow''.

The meaning of &lt;math&gt;[A]_t&lt;/math&gt; is that either A is valid now, or the variables appearing in t do not change. This allows for stuttering steps, in which none of the program variables change their values.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12423">'''Tethered particle motion''' ('''TPM''') is a biophysical method that is used for studying various [[polymers]] such as [[DNA]] and their interaction with other entities such as [[proteins]]. 
[[Image:Tethered particle motion sketch.JPG|right|thumb|250px|'''TPM''' - the bead diffuses in the solution, but because of the tethering, it can move only in restricted volume.]]
The method allows observers to measure various physical properties on the substances, as well as to measure the properties of biochemical interactions with other substances such as proteins and enzymes.
TPM is a [[single molecule experiment]] method.

==History==
TPM was first introduced by Schafer, Gelles, Sheetz and Landick in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v352/n6334/pdf/352444a0.pdf Schafer, D.A., et al., ''Transcription by single molecules of RNA polymerase observed by light microscopy.'' Nature, 1991. '''352''': p. 444-448.]&lt;/ref&gt; In their research, they attached [[RNA polymerase]] to the surface, and gold beads were attached to one end of the DNA molecules. In the beginning, the RNA polymerase "captures" the DNA near the gold bead. During the [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]], the DNA "slides" on the RNA polymerase so the distance between the RNA polymerase and the gold bead (the tether length)is increased. Using an [[optical microscope]] the area that the bead moves in was detected. The transcription rate was extracted from data.&lt;br&gt;
Since then, a lot of TPM experiments have been done, and the method was improved in many ways such as beads types, biochemstry techniques, imaging (faster cameras, different microscopy methods etc.) data analysis and combination with other single-molecule techniques (e.g. optical or magnetical tweezers).

== Principle of the method ==
One end of a polymer is attached to a small bead (tens to hundreds of nanometer), while the other end is attached to a surface.
Both the polymer and the bead stay in an aqueous environment, so the bead moves in [[Brownian motion]]. Because of the tether, the motion is restricted. Using an [[optical microscope]] and [[CCD camera]], one can track the bead position in a time series. Although the bead is usually smaller than the [[diffraction limit]], so the image is a spot which is larger than the bead itself ([[point spread function]]), the center of the spot represents the projection on the X-Y plane of the end of the polymer ([[end-to-end vector]]). Analyzing the distribution of the bead position can tell us a lot of information about the polymer.
[[Image:New TPM simulation.gif|right|thumb|250px|'''TPM simulation'''. The simulation done by [[MATLAB]], using [[Freely Jointed Chain]] model of [[polymer]]. The green points represent the projection of the end-to-end vector of the polymer on the XY plane.]]

===Excursion number===
In order that the motion would be polymer dominated, and not bead dominated, one should notice that the excursion number, N&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Segall | first1 = D.E. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2006| title = Volume-exclusion effects in tethered-particle experiments: bead size matters |journal=Physical Review Letters | volume = 96 | issue = 8| page = 088306 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.96.088306 | bibcode=2006PhRvL..96h8306S| arxiv = q-bio/0508028 }}&lt;/ref&gt; will be less than 1:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;N_R\equiv\frac{r}{\sqrt{L\cdot{l_p/3}}}&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the bead radius, &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the [[contour length]] of the polymer and &lt;math&gt;l_p&lt;/math&gt; is the [[persistence length]] (50&amp;nbsp;nm in physiological conditions) of the polymer. (It is possible to work also when &lt;math&gt;N_R&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, but it should be treated carefully.)

===Bead types===
Metallic beads (usually gold) scatter light with high intensity, so one can use very small beads (~40&amp;nbsp;nm diameter), and still have a good picture. From the other hand, metallic beads are not the appropriate tool for [[optical tweezers]] experiments.

Polystyrene beads scatter light weaker than metallic (in order to get the same intensity as getting from 40&amp;nbsp;nm gold bead, the polystyrene bead should be ~125&amp;nbsp;nm!&lt;ref&gt;Paul R. Selvin, Taekjip Ha, ''Single Molecule Techniques (Chapter 19)'', Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;), but it has the advantage that it can be combined with optical tweezers experiments.

The major advantage of fluorospheres is that the excitation [[wavelength]] and the emission wavelength are not the same, so [[dichroic filter]] can be used to give a cleaner signal. The disadvantage of the fluorospheres is [[photobleaching]].

All of the bead types and diameters (with the biochemistry marker, look at the tether assembly section) are manufactured by commercial companies, and can purchased easily.

==Chip and tether assembly==

===Chip assembly===
A chip can be made of two coverslips. One of them should be drilled to make two hole, allowing the reagents to be injected into the flowcell. The slides should be cleaned to remove dirt. A bath sonicator is a good tool for that, 15 minutes in Isopropanol should do the trick. Next, the a channel should be made. One way of doing so is to cut parafilm in the center, leaving a frame of parafilm that would be used as a spacer between the slides. The slides should be assembled one on the other with the cut parafilm between them. The final step is to heat the chip so that the parafilm will melt and glue the slides together.

===Tether assembly===
First, the chip has to be passivated so that the polymer won't stick to the glass, there are plenty of blocking reagents available (BSA, alpha-casein, etc.) and one should find what works best for the specific situation
Next, the surface should be coated with an antibody or other reactive molecule (such as anti-[[digoxigenin]]) that will bind to an antigen ([[digoxigenin]]) at one end of the polymer. After an incubation of about 45min, the excess antibody has to be washed away.
After washing the excess antibody, the polymer should be injected into the chip and incubated for about the same time. The polymer had been modified before at the ends. One end has a biotin tail and the other has a digoxigenin tail. After incubation, unbound polymer has to be washed out from the cell. Then, anti-[[biotin]] coated beads should be injected to the flowcell and incubate for about 30-45min. Excess beads should be washed out.

== Data analysis ==
[[File:TPM Experiment video.ogv|right|thumb|250px|Video taken from TPM experiment, using darkfield microscope. The green framed beads are tethered beads, and the red framed are immobilized beads.]]

===Tracking===
As mentioned above, the image doesn't show the bead itself but a larger spot according to its '''PSF''' ([[Point spread function]]). In addition, the [[pixel]] size on the camera may reduce the resolution of the measure.
In order to extract the exact bead's position (that corresponds to the end-to-end vector), the center of the spot should be found as accurate as possible. It can be done with good resolution using two different techniques, both based on spot characteristics. The light intensity in the [[focal plane]] distributed as [[airy disk]], and has circular symmetry.

A 2-dimensional [[Gaussian function]] is a good approximation for [[airy disk]]. By fitting this function to the spot one can find the parameters &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_0&lt;/math&gt; that are the coordinates of the center of the spot, and of the end-to-end vector.

The second technique is to find the center of intensity,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biophysj.org/cgi/reprint/89/2/1272.pdf Blumberg, S., et al., ''Three-dimensional characterization of tethered microspheres by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy.'' Biophysical Journal, 2005. '''89''': p. 1272-1281.]{{dead link|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; using the definition of [[center of mass]]:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\vec{R}_{cm}=\frac{1}{I_{tot}}\cdot\sum_{k=1}^{N}I_k\cdot\vec{r}_k&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\vec{R}_{cm}&lt;/math&gt; is the center of mass coordinate, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle I_{tot}&lt;/math&gt; is the total intensity of the spot, and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle I_k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\vec{r}_k&lt;/math&gt; are the intensity and coordinate of the ''k''-th pixel. Because of the circular symmetry, the coordinate of the center of intensity is the coordinate of the center of the bead.&lt;br&gt;
Both techniques give us the coordinate of the end-to-end vector in a resolution better than pixel size.

[[Image:TPM drift correction.jpg|left|thumb|250px|'''TPM drift:'''&lt;br&gt; '''top:''' The green graph is the data of the TPM experiment, the black curve is smoothing of the data (the drift).&lt;br&gt;'''bottom:''' Subtraction of the drift from the data.]]

===Drift correction===
Usually, the whole system drifts during the measuring. There are several methods to correct the drift, generally these can divided into 3 groups:

The Brownian motion frequency is much larger than the drift frequency, so one can use [[high-pass filter]] in order to remove the drift. Similar effect can achieve by smoothing the data, and subtraction of the smoothed from the data (see figure).

If few beads are shown in the frame, because every bead moving randomly, averaging over the position of them for every frame should give us the drift (it should subtracted from the data for having clean data).

If an immobilized bead is shown in the frame, we can take its position as a reference, and correct the data by the immobilized bead's position. (Another advantage of looking at immobilized bead, is the fact that the motion of it can tell us about the accuracy of the measure.)&lt;br&gt;
Of course one can use more than one method.

===Polymer characterization===
It is common to fit [[random walk]] statistics to the end-to-end vector of the polymer.&lt;ref&gt;Rubinstein, M. &amp; Colby, R.H., ''Polymer Physics (chapter 2.5 – Distribution of end-to-end Vector)'', OXFORD University Press (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; For 1-dimensional we'll get the [[Normal distribution]], and for 2-dimensional the [[Rayleigh distribution]]:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
P_{1D}(x)dx=\sqrt{\frac{3}{4{\pi}Ll_p}}\exp{\left(-\frac{3x^2}{4Ll_p}\right)}dx \,\,\,;\,\,\,\,\,\,
P_{2D}(R)dR=2{\pi}R\frac{3}{4{\pi}Ll_p}\exp{\left(-\frac{3R^2}{4Ll_p}\right)}dR
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the contour length and &lt;math&gt;l_p&lt;/math&gt; is the persistence length.&lt;br&gt;
After collecting the data of time series, one should fitting the [[histogram]] of the data to the distribution function (one or two dimensional). If the contour length of the polymer is known, the only fitting parameter is the persistence length.

===Spring constant===
Due to [[entropic force]], the polymer acts like [[Statistical mechanics#Random walks in space|Hookian spring.]] According to [[Boltzmann distribution]], the distribution is proprtional to exponent of the ratio between the [[elastic energy]] and the [[thermal energy]]:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;  P(x)\propto \exp{\left(-\frac{\frac{1}{2}kx^2}{K_BT}\right)}  &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where  &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the [[spring constant]], &lt;math&gt;K_B&lt;/math&gt; is [[Boltzmann constant]] and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature. By taking the [[logarithm]] of the distribution &lt;math&gt;P(x)&lt;/math&gt; and fitting it to a [[parabola]] shape, one can get the spring constant of the polymer:&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich, H.R.C., et al., ''A new optical method for characterizing single molecule interactions based on dark field microscopy.'' Proceedings of the SPIE, 2007. {{DOI|10.1117/12.699040}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle k=2{\alpha}K_BT&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; from the parabola fit.

==Advantage and disadvantage==

Advantages include a simple setup, cost, the fact that observations are made in the polymer's natural environment (no external forces are used), it is suitable for various microscopy methods (e.g. [[TIRFM]], [[dark field]], [[differential interference contrast microscopy]], etc.), it can be combined and manipulated using other methods, and there are a high variety of applications.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Disadvantages include low spatial resolution (~30&amp;nbsp;nm) and that it fits to [[in vitro]] experiments only.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Parts of Surveyor were brought back to Earth by Apollo 12. The camera (near Conrad's right hand) is on display at the [[National Air and Space Museum]]]]

'''Third-party evidence for Apollo Moon landings''' is evidence, or analysis of evidence, about [[Moon landing]]s that does not come from either [[NASA]] or the [[U.S. government]] (the first party), or the [[Moon landing conspiracy theories|Apollo Moon landing hoax theorists]] (the second party). This evidence serves as independent confirmation of NASA's account of the Moon landings.

==Independent evidence==

In this section are only those observations that are completely independent of NASA—no NASA facilities were used, and there was no NASA funding. Each of the countries mentioned in this section ([[Soviet Union]], [[Japan]], [[China]], and [[India]]) has its own [[Space exploration|space program]], builds its own [[space probe]]s which are launched on their own [[launch vehicle]]s, and has its own [[Deep Space Network (disambiguation)|deep space communication network]].

===SELENE photographs===
In 2008, the [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA) [[SELENE]] lunar probe obtained several [[photograph]]s showing evidence of Moon landings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=The "halo" area around Apollo 15 landing site observed by Terrain Camera on SELENE (KAGUYA) |date=May 20, 2009 |publisher=[[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] |location=Chōfu, Tokyo |url=http://www.jaxa.jp/press/2008/05/20080520_kaguya_e.html |accessdate=May 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the left are two photos taken on the lunar surface by the [[Apollo 15]] [[astronaut]]s August 2, 1971 during EVA 3 at station 9A near Hadley Rille. On the right is a 2008 reconstruction from images taken by the SELENE terrain camera and [[3D computer graphics|3D]] projected to the same vantage point as the surface photos. The terrain is a close match within the SELENE camera resolution of 10 metres.

file:JAXA_Moon_photo.jpg|[[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[SELENE]] reconstructed photo
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The light-colored area of blown lunar surface dust created by the lunar module engine blast at the Apollo 15 landing site was photographed and confirmed by comparative analysis of photographs in May 2008. They correspond well to photographs taken from the Apollo 15 [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command/Service Module]] showing a change in surface reflectivity due to the plume. This was the first visible trace of manned landings on the [[Moon]] seen from space since the close of the [[Apollo program]].

===Chandrayaan-1===

As with SELENE, the Terrain Mapping Camera of India's [[Chandrayaan-1]] probe did not have enough [[angular resolution#Explanation|resolution]] to record Apollo hardware. Nevertheless, as with SELENE, Chandrayaan-1 independently recorded evidence of [[Space weathering#Effects on spectral properties|lighter, disturbed soil]] around the Apollo 15 site.&lt;ref name="badsci"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://depletedcranium.com/apollo-15-confirmed-times-three/ |title=Apollo 15: Confirmed Times Three |last=drbuzz0 |date=November 7, 2009 |website=Depleted Cranium |publisher=Steve Packard |type=Blog |accessdate=May 2, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917234008/http://depletedcranium.com/apollo-15-confirmed-times-three/ |archivedate=September 17, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isro"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chauhan |first1=Prakash |last2=Kirankumar |first2=A.

===Chang'e 2===
China's second lunar probe, [[Chang'e 2]], which was launched in 2010 is capable of capturing lunar surface images with a resolution of up to 1.3 metres. It claims to have spotted traces of the Apollo landings, though the relevant imagery has not been publicly identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=China publishes high-resolution full moon map |editor-last=Lina |editor-first=Yang |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/sci/2012-02/06/c_131393210.htm |work=English.news.cn |publisher=[[Xinhua News Agency]] |location=Beijing |date=February 6, 2012 |accessdate=May 2, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527201104/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/sci/2012-02/06/c_131393210.htm |archivedate=May 27, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Apollo missions tracked by independent parties ===
Aside from NASA, a number of entities and individuals observed, through various means, the Apollo missions as they took place. On later missions, NASA released information to the public explaining where third party observers could expect to see the various craft at specific times according to scheduled launch times and planned trajectories.&lt;ref name="astr.ua.edu" /&gt;

==== Observers of all missions ====
The Soviet Union monitored the missions at their Space Transmissions Corps, which was "fully equipped with the latest intelligence-gathering and surveillance equipment."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Scott &amp; Leonov|Scott &amp; Leonov 2004]], p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vasily Mishin]], in an interview for the article "The Moon Programme That Faltered," describes how the Soviet Moon programme dwindled after the Apollo landing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=March 1991 |title=The Moon Programme That Faltered |journal=[[Spaceflight (magazine)|Spaceflight]] |volume=33 |pages=2–3 |location=London |publisher=[[British Interplanetary Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The missions were tracked by radar from several countries on the way to the Moon and back.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hansen|Hansen 2005]], p. 639&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Apollo 8 ====
{{main|Apollo 8}}
* On December 21, 1968, at 18:00 UT, amateur astronomers (H.R. Hatfield, M.J. Hendrie, F. Kent, Alan Heath, and M.J. Oates) in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] photographed a fuel dump from the jettisoned [[S-IVB]] third rocket stage.&lt;ref name="astr.ua.edu"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.astr.ua.edu/keel/space/apollo.html | title = Telescopic Tracking of the Apollo Lunar Missions | work = Bill Keel's Space History Bits |date=August 2008 | first = Bill | last = Keel}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pic du Midi de Bigorre|Pic du Midi Observatory]] (in the [[French Pyrenees]]); the [[Catalina Station]] of the [[Lunar and Planetary Laboratory]] ([[University of Arizona]]); [[Corralitos Observatory]], [[New Mexico]], then operated by [[Northwestern University]]; [[McDonald Observatory]] of the [[University of Texas]]; and [[Lick Observatory]] of the [[University of California]] all filed reports of observations.&lt;ref name="astr.ua.edu"/&gt;
* Dr. Michael Moutsoulas at Pic du Midi Observatory reported an initial sighting around 17:10 UT on December 21 with the 1.1-metre reflector as an object ([[Apparent magnitude|magnitude]] near 10, through clouds) moving eastward near the predicted location of Apollo 8. He used a 60-cm [[Refracting telescope|refractor telescope]] to observe a cluster of objects which were obscured by the appearance of a nebulous cloud at a time which matches a firing of the service module engine to assure adequate separation from the [[S-IVB]]. This event can be traced with the Apollo 8 Flight Journal, noting that launch was at 0751 EST or 12:51 UT on December 21.&lt;ref name="astr.ua.edu"/&gt;
* Justus Dunlap and others at Corralitos Observatory (then operated by Northwestern University) obtained over 400 short-exposure intensified images, giving very accurate locations for the spacecraft.&lt;ref name="astr.ua.edu"/&gt;
* The 2.1m [[Otto Struve Telescope]] at McDonald Observatory, from 01:50–2:37 UT on December 23, observed the brightest object flashing as bright as magnitude 15, with the flash pattern recurring about once a minute.&lt;ref name="astr.ua.edu"/&gt;
* The Lick Observatory observations during the return coast to Earth produced live television pictures broadcast to United States west coast viewers via [[KQED-TV]] in San Francisco.&lt;ref name="astr.ua.edu"/&gt;
* An article in the March 1969 issue of ''[[Sky &amp; Telescope]]'' contained many reports of optical tracking of Apollo 8.&lt;ref name="astr.ua.edu" /&gt;
* The first post-launch sightings were from the [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]] (SAO) station on [[Maui]].&lt;ref name="astr.ua.edu" /&gt; Many in [[Hawaii]] observed the trans-lunar injection burn near 15:44 UT on December 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Apollo 8 Mission Leaves Earth on Historic Voyage |first=Dave |last=Swaim |url=https://newspaperarchive.com/independent-star-news/1968-12-22 |newspaper=Independent Star News |location=Pasadena, CA |page=1 |date=December 22, 1968 |accessdate=May 9, 2013 |quote=The TLI firing was begun at 7:41 a.m. (PST) while the craft was over Hawaii, and it was reported there that the burn was visible from the ground.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Apollo 10 ====
{{main|Apollo 10}}
* A list of sightings of Apollo 10 were reported in "Apollo 10 Optical Tracking" by ''Sky &amp; Telescope'' magazine, July 1969, pp.&amp;nbsp;62–63.
* During the Apollo 10 mission The Corralitos Observatory was linked with the CBS news network. Images of the spacecraft going to the Moon were broadcast live.&lt;ref name="NASA1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://naca.larc.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19760016037&amp;qs=Ns%3DLoaded-Date%7C0%26N%3D4294707799 |title=The Corralitos Observatory Program for the Detection of Lunar Transient Phenomena |last=Hynek |first=J.

==== Apollo 11 ====
{{main|Apollo 11}}
* The [[Bochum Observatory]] director (Professor [[Heinz Kaminski]]) was able to provide confirmation of events and data independent of both the [[Russia]]n and U.S. space agencies.&lt;ref name="Bochum"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.honeysucklecreek.net/other_stations/bochum/index.html | work = A Tribute to Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station | title = Bochum}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A compilation of sightings appeared in "Observations of Apollo 11" by ''Sky and Telescope'' magazine, November 1969, pp.&amp;nbsp;358–59.
* At [[Jodrell Bank Observatory]] in the UK, the telescope was used to observe the mission, as it was used years previously for [[Sputnik]].&lt;ref name="open2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.open.edu/openlearn/history-the-arts/history/the-other-space-race-transcript | title=The other space race: Transcript | accessdate=February 6, 2006 | work=[[OpenLearn]] | first=Michael | last=Portillo | date=June 2, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Also see http://www.mikepeel.net/site/Jodrell_Bank_stories --&gt; At the same time, Jodrell Bank scientists [https://web.archive.org/web/20090717021523/http://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/multimedia/audio/luna15-apollo11.html were tracking] the unmanned Soviet spacecraft [[Luna 15]], which was trying to land on the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/news/2009/luna15-apollo11/ | title = Recording of Russia's lunar gatecrash attempt released | date = 3 July 2009 | publisher = [[Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics]] | accessdate = July 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2009, Jodrell released some recordings they made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/recording-tracks-russias-moon-gatecrash-attempt-1730851.html | title = Recording tracks Russia's Moon gatecrash attempt | first = Jonathan | last = Brown | date = 3 July 2009 | work = [[The Independent]] | location = London | accessdate = July 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Maley reports several sightings of the Apollo 12 Command Module.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==== Apollo 13 ====
{{main|Apollo 13}}
[[Chabot Observatory]] calendar records an application of optical tracking during the final phases of Apollo 13, on April 17, 1970:

{{quote|Rachel, Chabot Observatory's 20-inch refracting telescope, helps bring Apollo 13 and its crew home. One last burn of the lunar lander engines was needed before the crippled spacecraft's re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. In order to compute that last burn, NASA needed a precise position of the spacecraft, obtainable only by telescopic observation. All the observatories that could have done this were clouded over, except Oakland's Chabot Observatory, where members of the Eastbay Astronomical Society had been tracking the Moon flights. EAS members received an urgent call from NASA Ames Research Station, which had ties with Chabot's educational program since the 60's, and they put the Observatory's historic 20-inch refractor to work. They were able to send the needed data to Ames, and the Apollo crew was able to make the needed correction and to return safely to Earth on this date in 1970.&lt;ref name="astr.ua.edu"/&gt;}}

==== Apollo 15 ====
{{main|Apollo 15}}

Paul Wilson and Richard T. Knadle, Jr. received voice transmissions from the Command/Service Module in lunar orbit on the morning of August 1, 1971. In an article for ''[[QST]]'' magazine they provide a detailed description of their work, with photographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=P. M. |last1=Wilson |first2=R.

==== Apollo 16 ====
{{main|Apollo 16}}
[[Jewett Observatory]] at [[Washington State University]] reported sightings of Apollo 16.&lt;ref name="astr.ua.edu" /&gt;

At least two different radio amateurs, W4HHK and K2RIW, reported reception of Apollo 16 signals with home-built equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=432 Record, W4HHK Apollo 16 Reception |work=QST |publisher=American Radio Relay League |location=Newington, CT |date=June 1971 |pages=93–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=K2RIW Apollo 16 Reception &amp; 2300 EME |work=QST |publisher=American Radio Relay League |location=Newington, CT |date=July 1971 |pages=90–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bochum Observatory tracked the astronauts and intercepted the television signals from Apollo 16. The image was re-recorded in black and white in the [[576i|625 lines, 25 frames/s television standard]] onto 2-inch [[videotape]] using their sole quad machine. The transmissions are only of the astronauts and do not contain any voice from Houston, as the signal received came from the Moon only. The videotapes are held in storage at the observatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sternwarte Bochum beobachtet US-Apollo-Mondexperimente |last=Kaminski |first=H. |authorlink=Heinz Kaminski |url=http://www.classicbroadcast.de/stories/stories_sternwarte_bochum.pdf |date=October–November 1972 |work=Neues von Rohde &amp; Schwarz |publisher=[[Rohde &amp; Schwarz]] |location=Munich |volume=57 |pages=24–27 |language=German |trans-title=Bochum Observatory Observed U.S. Apollo Moon Experiments |format=PDF |accessdate=April 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Independent research consistent with NASA claims==

In this section is evidence, by independent researchers, that NASA's account is correct. However, at least somewhere in the investigation, there was some NASA involvement, or use of US government resources.

===Existence and age of Moon rocks===
A total of 382 kilograms (842&amp;nbsp;lb) of [[Moon rocks]] and dust were collected during the Apollos 11, 12, 14, 15, 16 and 17 missions.&lt;ref name="Papike98"&gt;{{cite journal | author = James Papike | author2 = Grahm Ryder| author3 = Charles Shearer  | last-author-amp = yes| title = Lunar Samples | journal = Reviews in Mineralogy and Geochemistry | volume = 36 | pages = 5.1–5.234 | date = 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 10&amp;nbsp;kg (22&amp;nbsp;lb) of the Moon rocks have been used in hundreds of experiments performed by both NASA researchers and planetary scientists at research institutions unaffiliated with NASA. These experiments have confirmed the age and origin of the rocks as lunar, and were used to identify lunar meteorites collected later from [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/news/spaceagencies/apollo_moonrock_000927.html |title=House Passes Bill to Award Apollo Astronauts Moon Rocks |first=Robert |last=Pearlman |authorlink=Robert Pearlman |date=September 27, 2000 |work=[[Space.com]] |publisher=[[TechMediaNetwork, Inc.]] |location=New York |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001017185913/http://www.space.com/news/spaceagencies/apollo_moonrock_000927.html |archivedate=October 17, 2000 |accessdate=May 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest Moon rocks are up to 4.5 billion years old,&lt;ref name="Papike98" /&gt; making them 200 million years older than the [[Oldest rock|oldest Earth rocks]], which are from the [[Hadean]] eon and dated 3.8 to 4.3 billion years ago.

The image on the left shows what is considered some of the most unambiguous evidence. This experiment repeatedly fires a laser at the Moon, at the spots where the Apollo landings were reported. The dots show when [[photon]]s are received from the Moon. The dark line shows that a large number come back at a specific time, and hence were reflected by something quite small (well under a metre in size). Photons reflected from the surface come back over a much broader range of times (the whole vertical range of the plot corresponds to only 30 metres or so in range). The concentration of photons at a specific time appears when the laser is aimed at the Apollos 11, 14 or 15 landing sites; otherwise the expected featureless distribution is observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://physics.ucsd.edu/~tmurphy/apollo/apollo.html |title=APOLLO (the Apache Point Observatory Lunar Laser-ranging Operation) |first=Tom |last=Murphy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Apollo reflectors are still in use.&lt;ref name="lunar-geophysics"&gt;{{cite conference | url = http://ilrs.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/williams_lw13.pdf | title = Lunar Geophysics, Geodesy, and Dynamics | first = James G. | last = Williams |author2=Dickey, Jean O. | conference = 13th International Workshop on Laser Ranging |date=October 2002 | format = PDF | conferenceurl = http://cddis.nasa.gov/lw13/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strictly speaking, although retroreflectors left by Apollo astronauts are strong evidence that human-manufactured artifacts currently exist on the Moon and that human visitors left them there, they are not, on their own, ''conclusive'' evidence. Unmanned missions are known to have placed such objects on the Moon as early as 1970. Smaller retroreflectors were carried by the unmanned landers [[Lunokhod 1]] and [[Lunokhod 2]] in 1970 and 1973, respectively.&lt;ref name="lunar-geophysics" /&gt; The location of Lunokhod 1 was unknown for nearly 40 years but it was rediscovered in 2010 in photographs by the [[Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter]] (LRO) and its retroreflector is now in use. Both the United States and the USSR had the capability to soft-land objects on the surface of the Moon for several years before that. The USSR successfully landed its first unmanned probe ([[Luna 9]]) on the Moon in February 1966, and the United States followed with [[Surveyor 1]] in June 1966, but no unmanned landers carried retroreflectors before Lunokhod 1 in November 1970.

====New lunar missions====
[[File:Lroc apollo11 landing site 20091109 zoom.jpg|right|thumb|Apollo 11 landing site photographed by [[Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter|LRO]]]]
Post-Apollo lunar exploration missions have located and imaged artifacts of the Apollo program remaining on the Moon's surface.

Images taken by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter mission beginning in July 2009 show the six Apollo [[Lunar Module]] descent stages, [[Apollo Lunar Surface Experiment Package]] (ALSEP) science experiments, astronaut footpaths, and [[lunar rover]] tire tracks. These images are the most effective proof to date to rebut the "landing hoax" theories.&lt;ref name="LRO1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LRO/multimedia/lroimages/apollosites.html |title=LRO Sees Apollo Landing Sites |last1=Hautaluoma |first1=Grey |last2=Freeberg |first2=Andy |editor-last=Garner |editor-first=Robert|date=July 17, 2009 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=July 18, 2007 |quote=NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, or LRO, has returned its first imagery of the Apollo Moon landing sites.

After the images shown here were taken, the LRO mission moved into a lower orbit for higher resolution camera work. All of the sites have since been re-imaged at higher resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/news/?archives/101-Apollo-11-Second-look.html |title=Apollo 11: Second look |last=Robinson |first=Mark |date=September 29, 2009 |publisher=LROC News System |accessdate=May 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/news/index.php?/archives/137-Exploring-the-Apollo-17-Site.html/ |title=Exploring the Apollo 17 Site |last=Robinson |first=Mark |date=October 28, 2009 |publisher=LROC news system |accessdate=May 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further imaging in 2012 shows the shadows cast by the flags planted by the astronauts on all Apollo landing sites. The exception is that of Apollo 11, which matches Buzz Aldrin's account of the flag being blown over by the lander's rocket exhaust on leaving the Moon.&lt;ref name="bbcflags"&gt;{{cite news |title=Apollo Moon flags still standing, images show |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-19050795 |work=[[BBC News]] |publisher=[[BBC]] |location=London |date=July 30, 2012 |accessdate=July 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Apollo missions tracked by non-NASA personnel ===
This section contains reports of the lunar missions from facilities that had significant numbers of non-NASA employees. This includes facilities such as the [[Deep Space Network]], which employed (and still employs) many local citizens in [[Spain]] and Australia, and facilities such as the [[Parkes Observatory]], which were hired by NASA for specific tasks, but staffed by non-NASA personnel.

==== Observers of all missions ====

The NASA [[Manned Space Flight Network]] (MSFN) was a worldwide network of stations that tracked the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]], [[Project Gemini|Gemini]], Apollo and [[Skylab]] missions. Most MSFN stations were only needed during the launch, Earth orbit and landing phases of the lunar missions, but three "deep space" sites with larger antennas provided continuous coverage during the trans-lunar, trans-Earth and lunar mission phases. Today, these three sites form the NASA [[Deep Space Network]]: the [[Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex]] near Goldstone, California; the [[Madrid Deep Space Communication Complex]] near [[Madrid]], Spain; and the [[Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex]], adjacent to the [[Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve]], near [[Canberra]], Australia.

Although most MSFN stations were NASA-owned, they employed many local citizens. NASA also contracted the [[Parkes Observatory]] in [[New South Wales]], Australia, to supplement the three deep space sites, most famously during the Apollo 11 EVA as documented by radio astronomer John Sarkissian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sarkissian |first=John M. |title=On Eagle's Wings: The Parkes Observatory's Support of the Apollo 11 Mission |date=2001 |journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=287–310 |location=Collingwood, Victoria |publisher=[[CSIRO Publishing]] for the [[Astronomical Society of Australia]] |doi=10.1071/AS01038 |accessdate=May 2, 2013 |url=http://www.parkes.atnf.csiro.au/news_events/apollo11/|bibcode = 2001PASA...18..287S }} October 2000 website version, part 1 of 12: "Introduction." Original version available from [http://www.parkes.atnf.csiro.au/news_events/apollo11/pasa/on_eagles_wings.pdf CSIRO Parkes Observatory] (PDF).&lt;/ref&gt; and portrayed (humorously and not quite accurately) in the movie ''[[The Dish]]''. The Parkes Observatory is not NASA-owned; it is, and always has been, owned and operated by the [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] (CSIRO), a research agency of the [[Government of Australia|Australian government]]. It would have been relatively easy for NASA to avoid using the Parkes Observatory to receive the Apollo 11 EVA television signals by scheduling the EVA at an earlier time when the Goldstone station could provide complete coverage.

==== Apollo 11 ====

==Plans==
As new research facilities such as orbiters and telescopes are built, the question arises whether they can see Apollo artifacts on the Moon.

'''Universidad San Francisco de Quito USFQ''' (informally '''Universidad San Francisco''', or simply '''USFQ''') is a [[liberal-arts]], [[non-profit]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}, [[private university]] located in [[Quito]], [[Ecuador]]. It was the first totally private self-financed university in Ecuador and the first liberal-arts institution in the [[Andes|Andean region]].&lt;ref name="sobrelausfq"&gt;Sobre la USFQ {{cite web |url=http://www.usfq.edu.ec/Paginas/SobreUSFQ.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501123205/http://www.usfq.edu.ec/Paginas/SobreUSFQ.aspx |archivedate=2012-05-01 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="qstopuniversities"&gt;Universidad San Francisco de Quito @QSTopUniversities {{cite web |url=http://www.topuniversities.com/institution/universidad-de-san-francisco-de-quito |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011160235/http://www.topuniversities.com/institution/universidad-de-san-francisco-de-quito |archivedate=2011-10-11 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Academically, USFQ ranks as one of the three-top universities (category A) in the ranking of Ecuadorian universities (being the only totally private university to qualify for the highest category), issued by the Ecuadorian Council of Evaluation and Accreditation of High Education ([[:es:Consejo Nacional de Evaluación y Acreditación de la Educación Superior del Ecuador|Consejo Nacional de Evaluación y Acreditación de la Educación Superior CONEA]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vistazo.com/webpages/pais/?id=7926 |title=Calificación de las universidades según el CONEA |publisher=Vistazo.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511085200/http://www.vistazo.com/webpages/pais/?id=7926 |archivedate=2012-05-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CONEA: sólo 11 Universidades tienen calificación "A" y 9 calificación "B" [http://www.eldiario.com.ec/noticias-manabi-ecuador/136020-conea-solo-11-universidades-tienen-calificacion-a-y-9-calificacion-b/]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, it was ranked first in Ecuador in relation to the number of [[peer-reviewed]] [[scientific publication]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Orbe, T. 2009. Ecuador produce pocas publicaciones científicas. Scidev.Net [http://www.scidev.net/es/news/ecuador-produce-pocas-publicaciones-cient-ficas.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

The university now enrolls 5,500 students, 4,500 of whom are undergraduates. The university each year has about 100 indigenous students and 1,000 international students participate in USFQ academic programs. USFQ has developed a scholarship program for indigenous students, offering full scholarships to the best students of public high schools throughout Ecuador.&lt;ref&gt;David E. Weaver. 2008. Transforming universities: The expediency of interculturality for indigenous superior education in Ecuador. MS Thesis, Tulane University. https://books.google.com.ec/books?id=e6dkwYIabIYC&lt;/ref&gt; Although USFQ receives no funding from the government of Ecuador, its faculty comprises one-half of all the people in that nation who hold a doctorate.&lt;ref name="sobrelausfq" /&gt;

The main campus of USFQ is located in Cumbayá, outside of [[Quito]] (capital city of [[Ecuador]]), where students use a library, education and research laboratories, classrooms, and seven restaurants. USFQ is the only university in the world that owns a campus in the [[Galapagos Islands]], and a campus in the [[Yasuni National Park|Yasuni]] [[Biosphere Reserve]] ([[Tiputini Biodiversity Station]]), one of Earth's most biodiverse areas.&lt;ref name="sobrelausfq" /&gt;&lt;ref name="qstopuniversities" /&gt;

==History==
Universidad San Francisco de Quito USFQ was founded in 1988&lt;ref name="sobrelausfq" /&gt; by the ''Corporación de Promoción Universitaria'', its umbrella non-profit foundation. It was the first totally private self-financed university in Ecuador. It was named after the city of [[Quito]]: San Francisco de Quito (not after the saint), in response to the need of a private [[higher education|higher-education]] institution in Ecuador. It was recognized by the [[Ministry of Education and Culture of Ecuador]] in October 1995 and accredited by [http://www.conesup.net CONESUP] in May 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conesup.net/info_universidades.php?id_univ=1038]. conesup.net.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Establishment of the ''Corporación de Promoción Universitaria''===
In 1980, a group of Ecuadorian and international intellectuals and businesspeople, under the leadership of Santiago Gangotena González, established the non-profit ''Corporación de Promoción Universitaria'', with the mission to create a private Ecuadorian university. The corporation was legalized by the [[Ministry of Education and Culture of Ecuador]] in June 1985 (published in the Official Registry of the Ecuadorian Government in 28 de June 1985).

===Foundation of the University===
After eight years of planning and promotion, the first class of USFQ students started on September 1, 1988, in a manor located on the 12 de Octubre Ave. 1983 and Salazar St.,in the northern area of [[Quito]], with 130 students. The university was recognized by the Ecuadorian government on October 18, 1995, under Executive Decree 3166, published in the Official Registry 809 on October 25, 1995. The statutes of the university were approved by the National Council of High Education [http://www.conesup.net CONESUP] on May 18, 2001.

===Creation of the colleges===
USFQ is divided among academic colleges ([[Faculty (division)|faculties]]). In 1988, students were distributed among three academic colleges: ''Colegio de Administración para el Desarrollo'' for business studies, ''Colegio de Ciencias Aplicadas'' for applied sciences, and ''Colegio de Comunicación y Cultura'' for communication, arts and cultural studies. In 1990, USFQ started the ''Colegio de Ciencias Ambientales'' for environmental sciences.

In 1992, six colleges were established: ''Colegio de Administración para el Desarrollo'', ''Colegio de Comunicación y Artes'', ''Colegio de Ciencias Ambientales'', ''Colegio de Ciencias Aplicadas'', ''Colegio de Ciencias Sociales y Humanidades'', y ''Colegio de Lenguas''. Subsequently, in 1993, the ''Colegio de Arquitectura'' started, followed in 1994 by the ''Colegio de Agricultura'' and the ''Colegio de Ciencias de la Salud''. In 1997, the ''Colegio de Ciencias Sociales y Humanidades'' changed its name to ''Colegio de Artes Liberales''.

===Colleges of the university===
By 2017, USFQ is divided in 15 academic colleges and institutes spread across three campuses across [[Ecuador]] ([[Quito|Cumbayá-Quito]], [[Tiputini Biodiversity Station]], and the [[Galápagos Islands]]&lt;ref name="sobrelausfq" /&gt;):

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5909">'''Volume contraction''' is a decrease in the volume of [[body fluid]], including the dissolved substances that maintain osmotic balance ([[osmolyte]]s). The loss of the water component of body fluid is specifically termed [[dehydration]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2933 MedicineNet &gt; Definition of Dehydration] Retrieved on July 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==By body fluid compartment==
Volume contraction is more or less a loss of [[extracellular fluid]] (ECF) and/or [[intracellular fluid]] (ICF).

===ECF volume contraction===
{{Main|Hypovolemia}}
Volume contraction of extracellular fluid is directly coupled to and almost proportional to volume contraction of [[blood plasma]], which is termed [[hypovolemia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3871 MedicineNet &gt; Definition of Hypovolemia] Retrieved on July 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/hypovolemia TheFreeDictionary.com --&gt; hypovolemia] Citing Saunders Comprehensive Veterinary Dictionary, 3 ed. Retrieved on July 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it primarily affects the [[circulatory system]], potentially causing [[hypovolemic shock]].

ECF volume contraction or hypovolemia is usually the type of volume contraction of primary concern in emergency, since ECF is approximately half the volume of ICF and is the first to be affected in e.g. [[bleeding]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Volume contraction is sometimes even used synonymously with [[hypovolemia]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===ICF volume contraction===
Volume contraction of intracellular fluid may occur after substantial fluid loss, since it is much larger than ECF volume, or loss of [[potassium]] (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) ''see section below''. 

ICF volume contraction may cause disturbances in various organs throughout the body.

===Dependence on lost solutes===
Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; loss approximately correlates with fluid loss from ECF, since Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; has a much higher concentration in ECF than ICF. In contrast, K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; has a much higher concentration in ICF than ECF, and therefore its loss rather correlates with fluid loss from ICF, since K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; loss from ECF causes the K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in ICF to diffuse out of the cells, dragging water with it by [[osmosis]].

===Estimation===
When the body loses fluids, the amount lost from ICF and ECF, respectively, can be estimated by measuring volume and [[amount of substance]] of [[sodium]] (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[potassium]] (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) in the lost fluid, as well as estimating the body composition of the person.

'''1.''' To calculate an estimation, the total amount of substance in the body before the loss is first estimated:

&lt;math&gt; n_b = Osm_b \times TBW_b &lt;/math&gt;

where:
*n&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; = Total amount of substance before fluid loss
*Osm&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; = Body [[osmolarity]] before loss (almost equal to [[plasma osmolality]] of 275-299 milli-osmoles per kilogram&lt;ref name="urlCase 422 --Neuropathology Case"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://path.upmc.edu/cases/case422.html |title=Case 422 --Neuropathology Case |format= |work= |accessdate=2009-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
*TBW&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; = [[Total body water]] before loss (approximately 60% of body weight, or using tritiated water or deuterium)

'''2.''' The total amount of substance in the body after the loss is then estimated:

&lt;math&gt; n_a = n_b - n_{lost Na^+} - n_{lost K^+} &lt;/math&gt;

where:
*n&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = Total amount of substance after fluid loss
*n&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; = Total amount of substance before fluid loss
*n&lt;sub&gt;lost Na+&lt;/sub&gt; = Amount of substance of lost sodium
*n&lt;sub&gt;lost K+&lt;/sub&gt; = Amount of substance of lost potassium

'''3.''' The new osmolarity becomes:

&lt;math&gt; Osm_a = \frac{n_a}{TBW_b - V_{lost}} &lt;/math&gt;

where:
*Osm&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = Body [[osmolarity]] after loss
*n&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = Total amount of substance after fluid loss
*TBW&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; = [[Total body water]] before loss
*V&lt;sub&gt;lost&lt;/sub&gt; = Volume of lost fluid

'''4.''' This osmolarity is evenly distributed in the body, and is used to estimate the new volumes of ICF and ECF, respectively:

&lt;math&gt; V_{ICF a} = \frac{n_{ICF a}}{Osm_a} = \frac{V_{ICF b} \times Osm_b - n_{lost K^+}}{Osm_a} &lt;/math&gt;

where:
*V&lt;sub&gt;ICF a&lt;/sub&gt; = Intracellular fluid volume after fluid loss
*n&lt;sub&gt;ICF a&lt;/sub&gt; = Amount of substance in ICF after fluid loss
*Osm&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = Body osmolarity after loss
*V&lt;sub&gt;ICF b&lt;/sub&gt; = Intracellular fluid volume before fluid loss (approximately 40% of body weight, or subtracting ECF from TBW)
*Osm&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; = Body [[osmolarity]] before loss (almost equal to [[plasma osmolality]] of 275-299 milli-osmoles per kilogram&lt;ref name="urlCase 422 --Neuropathology Case"/&gt;)
*n&lt;sub&gt;lost K+&lt;/sub&gt; = Amount of substance of lost potassium

In homologous manner:

&lt;math&gt; V_{ECF a} = \frac{n_{ECF a}}{Osm_a} = \frac{V_{ECF b} \times Osm_b - n_{lost Na^+}}{Osm_a} &lt;/math&gt;

where:
*V&lt;sub&gt;ECF a&lt;/sub&gt; = Extracellular fluid volume after fluid loss
*n&lt;sub&gt;ECF a&lt;/sub&gt; = Amount of substance in ECF after fluid loss
*V&lt;sub&gt;ECF b&lt;/sub&gt; = Extracellular fluid volume before fluid loss (approximately 20% of body weight, or by using inulin)
*Osm&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; = Body [[osmolarity]] before loss (almost equal to [[plasma osmolality]] of 275-299 milli-osmoles per kilogram&lt;ref name="urlCase 422 --Neuropathology Case"/&gt;)
*n&lt;sub&gt;lost K+&lt;/sub&gt; = Amount of substance of lost potassium

'''5.''' The volume of lost fluid from each compartment:

&lt;math&gt; V_{lost ICF} = V_{ICF b} - V_{ICF a} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; V_{lost ECF} = V_{ECF b} - V_{ECF a} &lt;/math&gt;

where:
*V&lt;sub&gt;I/ECF b&lt;/sub&gt; = Intra/Extra-cellular fluid volume before fluid loss
*V&lt;sub&gt;I/ECF a&lt;/sub&gt; = Intra/Extra-cellular fluid volume after fluid loss

}}'''Voyant Tools''' is an open-source, web-based application for performing text analysis. It supports scholarly reading and interpretation of texts or corpus, particularly by scholars in the [[digital humanities]], but also by students and the general public. It can be used to analyze online texts or ones uploaded by users.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://voyant-tools.org/docs/#!/guide/about|title=Voyant Tools Help|website=voyant-tools.org|access-date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voyant has a large, international user base: in October 2016 alone, Voyant's main server had 81,686 page views originating from 156 countries, invoking the tool 1,173,252 times.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hermeneuti.ca/VoyantFacts|title=Voyant Facts|last=Sinclair|first=Stéfan|last2=Rockwell|first2=Geoffrey|date=2016|website=Hermeneuti.ca: Computer-Assisted Interpretation in the Humanities|publisher=Stéfan Sinclair &amp; Geoffrey Rockwell|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voyant "was conceived to enhance reading through lightweight text analytics such as word frequency lists, frequency distribution plots, and KWIC displays."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klein|first=Lauren F.|last2=Eisenstein|first2=Jacob|last3=Sun|first3=Iris|year=2015|title=Exploratory Thematic Analysis for Digitized Archival Collections|url=|journal=Digital Scholarship in the Humanities|volume=30|issue=Supp. 1|pages=i138|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its interface is composed of panels which perform these varied analytical tasks. These panels can also be embedded in external web texts (e.g. a web article could include a Voyant panel that creates a word cloud from it). The book ''Hermeneutica: Computer-Assisted Interpretation in the Humanities'' demonstrates different approaches to text analysis using Voyant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hermeneutica: Computer-Assisted Interpretation in the Humanities.|last=Rockwell|first=Geoffrey|last2=Sinclair|first2=Stéfan|publisher=MIT Press|year=2016|isbn=9780262332057|location=Cambridge|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Voyant Tools was developed by Stéfan Sinclair ([[McGill University|McGill]]) and Geoffrey Rockwell ([[University of Alberta]]) and continues to be updated. It developed out of earlier text analysis tools including HyperPo, [[Text Analysis Portal for Research|Taporware]], and TACT. Contributors have included Andrew MacDonald, Cyril Briquet, Lisa Goddard,and Mark Turcato.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Range of Uses ==
Researchers have used Voyant Tools to analyze texts in a wide range of contexts including literature,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rambsy|first=Kenton|year=2016|title=Text-Mining Short Fiction by Zora Neale Hurston and Richard Wright using Voyant Tools|url=|journal=CLA Journal|volume=59| issue =  3|pages=251–258|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; language teaching,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McIlroy|first=Tara|year=2013|title=Exploring Poetry and Identity in a Language Learning Environment|url=|journal=Studies in Linguistics and Language Teaching|volume=24|pages=31–45|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; healthcare,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De Caro|first=W.|last2=Mitello|first2=L.|last3=Marucci|first3=A.R.|last4=Lancia|first4=L.|last5=Sansoni|first5=J.|year=2016|title=Textual Analysis and Data Mining: An Interpreting Research on Nursing|url=|journal=Studies In Health Technology And Informatics|volume=225|pages=948|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maramba|first=Inocencio Daniel|display-authors=etal|year=2015|title=Web-based textual analysis of free-text patient experience comments from a survey in primary care|url=|journal=JMIR Medical Informatics|volume=3| issue =  2|pages=e20|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and system architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moullec|first=Marie-Lise|last2=Jankovic|first2=Marija|last3=Eckert|first3=Claudia|year=2016|title=Selecting system architecture: What a single industrial experiment can tell us about the traps to avoid when choosing selection criteria|url=|journal=System Architecture Design|volume=30|issue=3|pages=250–262|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Describing approaches to studying the internet using web scraping, Black has noted that "the Voyant Tools project is an excellent source to learn about the kinds of data that humanists can extract from Internet sources because it already supports text extraction from webpages."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Black|first=Michael L.|year=2016|title=The World Wide Web as Complex Data Set: Expanding the Digital Humanities into the Twentieth Century and Beyond through Internet Research|url=|journal=[[International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing]]|volume= 10|issue=1|page=106|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''worm cast''' is a structure created by [[worm]]s, typically on [[soils]] such as those on [[beach]]es &lt;ref name=BBC&gt;[http://www.open2.net/coast/postcard_beachlife.html BBC Beach Life]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wir&gt;[http://www.wirral.gov.uk/er/nwcp_intertidal.htm North Wirral - Intertidal Habitats]&lt;/ref&gt; that gives the appearance of multiple worms.
