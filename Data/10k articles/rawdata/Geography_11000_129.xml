'''780 Armenia''' is a [[minor planet]] in the [[asteroid belt]] orbiting the [[Sun]]. It is named after the [[Kingdom of Armenia (disambiguation)|Kingdom of Armenia]], now [[Armenia]].

This object is the namesake of the [[Armenia family]], a very small [[Asteroid family|family]] of 13–76 asteroids that share similar spectral properties and [[orbital elements]]; hence they may have arisen from the same collisional event. All members have a relatively high [[orbital inclination]].&lt;ref name="Novakovic2011"/&gt;

[[File:Diagram of Holland Channel cable.png|thumb|300px|right|A period depiction of the Ambrose Channel pilot cable in action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bond|1920}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''Ambrose Channel pilot cable''', also called the '''Ambrose Channel leader cable''', was a cable laid in [[Ambrose Channel]] at the entrance to the [[Port of New York and New Jersey]] that provided an audio tone for guiding ships in and out of port at times of low visibility. The cable was laid during 1919 and 1920;  it had been removed from the channel and replaced by wireless technology by the end of the 1920s.
&lt;!-- Note: this image needs 500px as it has detail which gets blurred out at lower resolution. --&gt;

==Background==
[[Ambrose Channel]] is the only shipping channel in and out of the [[Port of New York and New Jersey]], an important [[commercial port]]. Delays posed a major problem for shipping en route to [[New York City]], and bad weather could close the channel for days. Ships were forced to wait at the harbor's entrance for conditions to clear. These delays cost shipping companies substantial amounts of money, with each ship costing between $500 and $4000 per hour it was stopped (roughly $5,700 to $46,000 in 2013 dollars).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilhelm|1922|p=249 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description and operation==
[[File:Ambrose pilot cable cross section.png|thumb|The Cable was composed of several layers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921b|p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]The Ambrose leader cable was an armored cable with a single internal conductor (see picture) that acted like a long radio antenna laid on the channel floor. It originated at [[Fort Lafayette]] (near the present day [[Verrazano-Narrows Bridge]]), then extended 16 miles down the [[Ambrose Channel]] to the vicinity of [[Lightship Ambrose]] offshore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|pp=44–45}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was powered by a generator at Fort Lafayette that produced 500&amp;nbsp;[[hertz|Hz]] (cycles per second) current at 400&amp;nbsp;volts, resulting in an alternating electromagnetic field along the length of the cable that could be detected to approximately a thousand yards away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|p=51}}. Other voltages may have been used in subsequent operation.&lt;/ref&gt;  The current was mechanically keyed to send the word "NAVY" in [[Morse Code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|New York Times|1920|p=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ship received by a pair of [[induction coil]]s hung on opposite sides of the ship, and fed through an amplifier into a headset (see diagram, below). By switching between coils, the relative strength of the signal on each side could be compared. The ship maintained a course parallel to the cable by maneuvering to keep the signal strength constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|pp=46–47}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and development==
[[File:SE 1600 amplifier ckt.png|thumb|200px|Two-stage vacuum-tube amplifier alternately takes input from inductance coils (top) hung on each side of ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|p=36}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The pilot cable required a series of prior discoveries and inventions. In 1882,  A. R. Sennett patented the use of a submerged electrical cable to communicate with a ship at a fixed location. Around the same time Charles Stevenson patented a means of navigating ships over an electrically charge cable using a [[galvanometer]]. The method became practical when Earl Hanson adapted early [[vacuum tube]] circuits to amplify the signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|p=34}}; {{Harvnb|Current History|1921|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert H. Marriott]] was a radio pioneer employed by the Navy in [[Puget Sound]], where he conducted early experiments with underwater pilot cables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Geselowitz|2009}}; {{Harvnb|Marriott|1924}}; {{Harvnb|Woods|1980|p=523}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His results were sufficiently promising that he recommended further development to Commander Stanford C. Hooper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilhelm|1922|p=250 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In October, 1919 Commander Hooper instructed A. Crossley, an expert radio aid, to develop and test the concept on a larger scale at the [[Naval Submarine Base New London#History|New London Naval Base]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilhelm|1922|p=250 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Crossley installed a longer version of the cable that Marriott had designed. He used a wooden hulled [[launch (ship)|launch]] for the first round of tests before moving to a steel-hulled [[submarine]] for later tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilhelm|1922|p=250 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Both types of vessel picked up the signal and followed the underwater test cable without problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilhelm|1922|p=250 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Installation and testing==
[[File:Ambrose Channel pilot cable in action.PNG|frame|left|Commander R. F. McConnell on the USS ''Semmes'' with the "Hanson apparatus".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nautical Gazette|1920}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Following the successful tests at New London, the Navy proceeded to large scale testing in Ambrose Channel late in 1919. The [[Minelayer#Naval minelayers|minelayer]] ''Ord'' laid a pilot cable composed of 2,000 feet of leaded and armored cable, 2,000 feet of leaded cable, and 83,000 feet of standard rubber-insulated cable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|pp=38–39 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[USS O'Brien (DD-51)|USS ''O'Brien'']] was fitted with receiving equipment and attempted to follow the cable out of the channel. Unfortunately, it was unable to detect a signal past the 1,000 foot mark, where a break in the cable had prevented the signal from continuing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|p=40 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The break in the cable was repaired, but over the course of the winter of 1919-1920, crews found that the cable had broken in a total of fifty-two different places due to the strain placed on it while it was being laid. The damage was irreparable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|p=40 }}; {{Harvnb|Wilhelm|1922|p=250 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Going back to the drawing board, engineers tested 150-foot segments of three different types of cable and used the results to design a new full-size pilot cable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|pp=40–41}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Navy ordered 87,000 feet of cable from the Simplex Wire and Cable Company in Boston.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|p=42}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once complete, the cable was loaded onto the [[USS Pequot (ID-2998)|USS ''Pequot'']] in the [[Boston Navy Yard]]. The ship arrived in New York on July 31, 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|p=43 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ambrose Channel was already crossed by three telegraph cables, owned by [[Western Union]], the [[United States Army|Army]], and the [[New York City Police Department|police]], all of which had to be raised to the surface so the pilot cable could be laid underneath them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|p=43 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The installation of the cable was completed on August 6, 1920,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|pp=38–39 }}; {{Harvnb|New York Times|1920|p=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and by August 28, electrical tests showed that both the sending and receiving circuits were functioning properly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Los Angeles Times|1920}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Navy tested the cable using the seagoing tug [[USS Algorma (AT-34)|USS ''Algorma'']]. It then invited "representatives of various radio companies, shipping interests, [[Maritime pilot|pilots']] associations, governmental bureaus, naval attaches, and others" for a public demonstration on board the destroyer [[USS Semmes (DD-189)|USS ''Semmes'']] from October 6 through October 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|p=290}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ship's windows were covered with canvas and the captains took turns navigating using only the audio cues from the cable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|New York Times|1920|p=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cable was well received. Even before the New London tests, the Washington Post called it "the greatest development in marine travel since the invention of the steam turbine"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Washington Post|1919|p=21}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Los Angeles Times declared the technology to be "one of the greatest peacetime gifts that science has devised."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Los Angeles Times|1919}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Once operational, the latter newspaper called it "the greatest safeguard devised for shipping in modern history".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Los Angeles Times|1920}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a 1921 trade magazine, leader cables had five functions: "to enable a ship to make a good landfall in thick weather, to lead a ship up the harbor, to lead a ship from open water through a restricted channel to open water on the far side, to give warning of outlying dangers, and to assist a vessel to keep a straight course from port to port and thus save fuel."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bennett|1921|p=951}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1922, the publication ''Radio World'' stated that the cable's first two years of operation had been successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gordon|1922|p=72}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in 1922, ''Radio Broadcast'' boasted about the money saved by the cable as well as the ease of using it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilhelm|1922|p=249 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The cable itself was paid for using public funds, but it was the responsibility of ship owners to outfit their vessels with receiving equipment. Installation of the cable cost roughly $50,000&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilhelm|1922|p=249 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the listening apparatus installed on each ship using the channel cost $1,200,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|New York Times|1920|p=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; compared with hourly costs of delays that ranged from $500 to $4,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilhelm|1922|p=249 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Radio Broadcast'' expressed the belief that navigation cables would become common for both ships and aircraft: "...there is a future for the audio cable... Its fullest usefulness at American ports and elsewhere waits, however, on that large appreciation of radio devices for sea as well as air navigation which pilots, both on the sea and in the air, expect, but do not as yet demand."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilhelm|1922|p=251}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Obsolescence and legacy ==
Despite the media hype, it appears that the Ambrose Channel pilot cable never met with large scale commercial success. Initially, some contemporaries of the cable proposed that it be extended several miles past the Ambrose light.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilhelm|1922|p= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such plans never came to fruition, as advances in technology rendered the pilot cable obsolete.  By 1929 the ''Baltimore Sun'' reported ships navigating the Channel blindly without making any reference to the cable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Baltimore Sun|1929}}; {{Harvnb|Putnam|1924|p=215}}; {{Harvnb|Science|1924|p=xiv}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In that year, Marriott publicly complained that navigation cables still had unrealized potential for guiding ships. &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Science News-Letter|1929}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Leader cable systems appear to have been made obsolete by the refinement of [[radio direction finding]] and the placement of [[Electric beacon|radio beacons]] (low-power radio transmitters) at strategic locations. Those beacons are analogous to lighthouses, but can be "seen" in all weather, and are used for navigation in the same way as regular lighthouses.  The first successful application of these radio beacons as "radio fog signals" were three stations installed near New York in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Putnam|1924}}; {{Harvnb|Radio Broadcast|1922|p=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1924, there were eleven stations in operation in the United States and nearly three hundred ships suitably equipped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Putnam|1924|p=213}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1930, an article in the ''Journal of the [[Royal Society of Arts]]'' declared that "wireless aids and echo sounding have superseded [the leader cable]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cooper|1930|pp=995–996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, more modern navigation tools such as [[radar]], [[global positioning system|GPS]], and lighted [[buoy]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s help ships navigate Ambrose Channel.



Earl Hanson, one of the key players in designing the Ambrose Channel cable, writing for ''Popular Mechanics,'' viewed it as a step toward applying radio cable technology in vast swaths of everyday life, including guiding aircraft and navigating and powering automobiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hanson|1934}}; {{Harvnb|Yates|Pacent|1922|p=296}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ambrose Channel cable was removed from the channel and used in testing an early system of [[autolanding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Howeth|1963|loc= Chap. 28, [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112064674325;view=1up;seq=367 §16]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The cable found no more success in that role than it did in guiding ships. The [[Blind Landing Experimental Unit]] later tried a similar system briefly before also abandoning it in favor of wireless.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wood|1930|p=13 }}; {{Harvnb|Davis|1922|p=5}}; {{Harvnb|Armstrong|1930|pp=1–2}}; {{Harvnb|Perry|2004|p=100}}; {{Harvnb|Hanson|1919|p=489}}; {{Harvnb|Current History|1921|p=162}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arabia Deserta''' (Latin meaning "Abandoned/Deserted Arabia"), also known as '''Arabia Magna''' ("Great Arabia"), signified the [[desert]] interior of the [[Arabian peninsula]]. In ancient times, this land was populated by [[nomad]]ic tribes who frequently invaded richer lands, such as [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Arabia Felix]].

Arabia Deserta was one of three regions into which the [[ancient Rome|Romans]] divided the Arabian peninsula: ''Arabia Deserta'' (or ''Arabia Magna''), ''Arabia Felix'', and ''[[Arabia Petraea]]''. As a name for the region, it remained popular into the 19th and 20th centuries, and was used in [[Charles M. Doughty]]'s ''[[Travels in Arabia Deserta]]'' (1888).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url={{wdl|58}} |title=Carte des trois Arabies : tirée en partie de l'Arabe de Nubie, en partie de divers autres auteurs  |language=French |trans-title=Map of the Three Arabias: Excerpted Partly from the Arab of Nubia, Partly from Several Other Authors |date=1654 |work=[[World Data Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ashton Nichols''' is the current Walter E. Beach ’56 Distinguished Chair in Sustainable Studies and Professor of English Language and Literature at [[Dickinson College]]. His interests are in literature, contemporary [[ecocriticism]], [[Romanticism]], and [[nature writing]]. Nichols teaches courses in [[Romanticism]], 19th century literature, literature and the environment, and nature writing. He is especially well-known for his study of [[James Joyce]]'s literary concept of "epiphany" and his coinage of the phrase "urbanatural roosting," an idea which links urban with natural modes of existence and argues for ways of living more lightly on the earth, for inhabiting our planet the way birds do, by altering our environments without harming those same environments.

== Academic background ==

Nichols graduated from the [[University of Virginia]] with a B.A. with high honors in Philosophy in 1975. As an undergraduate, he received a four-year full academic scholarship as a DuPont Regional Scholar and was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]]. He was also selected for an Honors Program in philosophy, a program which allowed him to sit in on any class at the university and work individually with a separate tutor for each of three semesters: in epistemology, metaphysics, and ethics, and then to write an honors thesis in his final semester. On the advice of Cora Diamond,&lt;ref&gt;[[Cora Diamond]]&lt;/ref&gt; he attended [[University College London]] in from 1973 to 1974 to study philosophy. He served as a staff reporter for the [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]] ''Free Lance-Star'', where he received awards from the [[Associated Press|AP]] and the Virginia Press Association, and as an editor for the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] before returning to the University of Virginia for an M.A. and later a Ph.D. in English Literature, specializing in Romantic and Victorian literature. He spent time as a Visiting Researcher at [[Cambridge University]] with John Beer.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Beer]]&lt;/ref&gt; His Ph.D. dissertation, supervised by Robert Langbaum&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Langbaum]]&lt;/ref&gt; was entitled, “The Poetics of Epiphany: Nineteenth-Century Origins of the Modern Literary Moment.” It was later revised for publication with the same title, as his first book.

Nichols's time at Dickinson is punctuated by active membership on the President's Commission on Environmental Sustainability (PCES)--and before that, on the steering committee of the Center for Sustainability Education (CSE)--as a member of the Climate Change Curriculum Task Force, and a recipient of the Willoughby Institute Award for Teaching with Technology;&lt;ref name="blogs.dickinson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.dickinson.edu/willoughby/about/2008-2010-willoughby-fellows/ |accessdate=July 20, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703180319/http://blogs.dickinson.edu/willoughby/about/2008-2010-willoughby-fellows/ |archivedate=July 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he has also served on the Science Advisory Committee and the General Education Committee of the college. In 1994-95, he was a Visiting Lecturer at the [[University of East Anglia]] and Director of the Dickinson Programs in the Humanities and Sciences in [[Norwich]], U.K. He is a member of the selection committee for the Sam Rose '58 and Julie Walters Prize at Dickinson College for Global Environmental Activism,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dickinson.edu/homepage/749/the_sam_rose_58_and_julie_walters_prize_at_dickinson_college_for_global_environmental_activism&lt;/ref&gt; a $100,000 a year award to a major environmentalist whose impact has been powerful and fully international. Recipients so far have included Bill McKibben&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill McKibben]]&lt;/ref&gt; (author and climate activist), Lisa P. Jackson&lt;ref&gt;[[Lisa P. Jackson]]&lt;/ref&gt; (Barack Obama's first EPA administrator), James Balog&lt;ref&gt;[[James Balog]]&lt;/ref&gt; (video and still photographer of melting glaciers and icecaps), Mark Ruffalo&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Ruffalo]]&lt;/ref&gt; (actor and river activist), Elizabeth Kolbert&lt;ref&gt;[[Elizabeth Kolbert]]&lt;/ref&gt; (Pulitzer Prize-winning environmental writer for ''The New Yorker'' and professor at Williams College), Brett Jenks&lt;ref&gt;[[Rare (conservation organization)|Rare]]&lt;/ref&gt; (CEO and president of conservation organization ''Rare''), and Our Children's Trust&lt;ref&gt;[[Our Children's Trust]]&lt;/ref&gt; the organization that supports 21 young people--aged 11-22--who have brought suit against the federal U. S. government, claiming that the climate of the earth is being damaged in ways that threaten the youths' rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness). In addition to his current joint appointment in the Environmental Studies and Sciences, as well as the English, departments, Nichols has also served terms as Chair of both of these departments. He has also been an Associate Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at Dickinson.

== Recognition ==

Nichols was awarded the Ganoe Award for Inspirational Teaching&lt;ref name="archives.dickinson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.dickinson.edu/lists-rosters/ganoe-award-inspirational-teaching |title=Ganoe Award for Inspirational Teaching &amp;#124; Dickinson College |publisher=Archives.dickinson.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1993-1994). Speaking to his ability to reach students, this award is given by members of the senior class prior to graduation. He has also won the Lindback Award for Distinguished Teaching&lt;ref name="dickinson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dickinson.edu/academics/programs/english/Faculty/ |accessdate=July 20, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006135309/http://www.dickinson.edu/academics/programs/english/Faculty/ |archivedate=October 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (1992-1993); selected by fellow faculty members, it recognizes superior educators in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, and Virginia. His most recent book, ''Beyond Romantic Ecocriticism: Toward Urbanatural Roosting''&lt;ref&gt;http://us.macmillan.com/beyondromanticecocriticism/AshtonNichols&lt;/ref&gt; has been widely praised, from ''Choice'': "Combining literary, anecdotal, and philosophical perspectives, this invaluable book crossbreeds political, spiritual, scientific, and aesthetic elements within the outworn dichotomy of town and country. Summing Up: Essential"&lt;ref name="blogs.dickinson.edu"&gt;http://blogs.dickinson.edu/romnat/2011/07/20/new-york-times-review/&lt;/ref&gt; to the ''Sierra'' Club Magazine: "Both critically and artfully, Nichols explores how our conceptions of nature have derived from Enlightenment-era ideas (humans and nature are separate) and Romantic poetry (humans and nature are connected). Relying heavily on poetic examples, Nichols also envisions an 'urbanatural' future in which we see ourselves as part of the earth.";&lt;ref name="blogs.dickinson.edu"/&gt; the book was released in paperback in 2012. Nichols is now at work on a follow-up to ''Urbanatural Roosting'', entitled ''Humanature: 21st-Century Challenges to ''Homo sapiens'' in a World of Plants and Animals''.

[[The Teaching Company]] selected Nichols as one of the approximately 100 professors chosen to video and audio tape (also download) as part of their ''Great Courses''&lt;ref&gt;[[The Great Courses]]&lt;/ref&gt; Program; he has so far produced 24 lectures on "Emerson, Thoreau and American Transcendentalism."&lt;ref&gt;[[Transcendentalism]]&lt;/ref&gt; He was included in ''Who's Who in America'' in 2000 and ''Who's in the World'' in 2002. In recent years, he has delivered keynote speeches and lectures in countries around the world: in England, Ireland, Puerto Rico, Portugal, France, Italy, Morocco, Cameroon, India, China, and Japan.

== Research ==

His ongoing writing and research includes a website that organizes and analyzes sources of eco-criticism and natural history to explore the definition of nature.&lt;ref name="blogs.dickinson_a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.dickinson.edu/romnat |title=Romantic Natural History &amp;#124; A survey of relationships between literary works &amp; natural history in the century before Charles Darwin's ''On the Origin of Species'' (1859) |publisher=Blogs.dickinson.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sarah Freierman, of ''The New York Times'', says of the project:

:''A Romantic Natural History, maintained by Dr. Ashton Nichols, a professor of English at Dickinson College, examines the way artists, writers and scientists viewed nature in the century before Charles Darwin published ''On the Origin of Species'' in 1859. The timeline offers wonderful juxtapositions, like the publication of Jane Austen’s ”Sense and Sensibility” and the ”New Idea of the Anatomy of the Brain,” a paper by Charles Bell, in 1811; and the 1832 posthumous publication of ”Faust, Part II,” by Goethe, followed by an 1834 entry noting the invention of the first computer, an ”analytical engine” by Charles Babbage.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web|author=Shelly Freierman |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/21/technology/news-watch-views-of-nature-before-darwin-jumped-into-the-debate.html |title=NEWS WATCH; Views of Nature Before Darwin Jumped Into the Debate - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2000-09-21 |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;''
  
The multidisciplinary application of Nichols' research has been praised not only by literary critics and environmentalists but also by urban planners and architects such as Charles Morris Anderson.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Anderson Landscape Architecture#Charles Anderson Landscape Architecture]]&lt;/ref&gt; This link between "urbanature" and architecture is evident in urban design projects such as The Olympic Sculpture Park&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbuildingsdirectory.com/project.cfm?id=801 |title=Olympic Sculpture Park, Seattle Art Museum |publisher=World Buildings Directory |date= |accessdate=2014-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217034444/http://www.worldbuildingsdirectory.com/project.cfm?id=801 |archivedate=2014-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Seattle, WA and Project Phoenix,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archdaily.com/327179/world-class-soccer-stadium-underway-in-haiti/ |title=World-Class Soccer Stadium Underway in Haiti |publisher=ArchDaily |date= |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; a soccer stadium in Haiti.

Most recently, Nichols has established a blog on [http://blogs.dickinson.edu/urbanaturalroosting/ urbanatural roosting], also accessible at this superscript&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.dickinson.edu/urbanaturalroosting/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This site offers practical applications and descriptions of urbanatural roosting in cities ([[Boston]], [[New York City]], and [[Baltimore]], for example) as well as in natural areas (The [[Adirondacks]], [[Cape Cod]], the [[Chesapeake Bay]], and the like). These examples show how modern cities have naturalized themselves to produce sustainable forms of energy (sunlight electricity, wind energy, hydroelectric power), to grow food (greenroofs, greenwalls), and to increase the size of natural environment in urban spaces ([[Central Park]], [[Boston Common]], the [[Baltimore Inner Harbor]], etc.). Likewise, the site shows how human culture and urban ideas have helped to make natural spaces more livable: strict architectural regulations in the Adirondacks and in national and state parks, careful use of roads and trails throughout natural areas nationwide, and detailed rules for living with nonhuman species in wild and wilderness areas (hunting and trapping regulations, catch-and-release fishing streams, and strict protections for even the wildest species: rattlesnakes, wolves, and grizzly bears). In addition to other nature writing—currently for the [http://thoreaufarm.org/?s=ashton+nichols Thoreau Farm blog "The Roost"] in Concord, Massachusetts&lt;ref&gt;http://thoreaufarm.org/?s=ashton+nichols&lt;/ref&gt;—Nichols has also published poetry and short fiction.

== Personal ==

Nichols has been married since 1975 (to the calligrapher Kimberley Anne Smith), with whom he has four daughters (born 1979, 1981, 1982, 1984), three granddaughters and three grandsons.

[[Image:Bocage boulonnais.jpg|thumb|425px|Bocage of the [[Boulonnais (land area)|Boulonnais]], [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]], France]]

'''Bocage''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|oʊ|k|ɔː|ʒ}}  {{respell|BOH|kawzh}}) is a terrain of mixed woodland and pasture characteristic of parts of [[France]] and [[England]].
[[File:Candelabrum (one of a pair) MET DP-12374-056 (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Chelsea porcelain]] candle-holder with bocage background, c. 1765]]
''Bocage'' may also refer to a small forest, a decorative element of leaves, or a type of [[rubble-work]], comparable with the English use of "rustic" in relation to garden ornamentation.  In the decorative arts, especially [[porcelain]], it refers to a leafy screen spreading above and behind figures. Though found on continental figures, it is something of an English speciality, beginning in the mid-18th century, especially in [[Chelsea porcelain]], and later spreading to more downmarket [[Staffordshire pottery]] figures.  

In English, ''bocage'' refers to a terrain of mixed woodland and pasture, with fields and winding country lanes [[sunken lane|sunken]] between narrow low ridges and banks surmounted by tall thick hedgerows that break the wind but also limit visibility. It is the sort of landscape found in many parts of southern England, for example in [[Devon]].  However the term is more often found in technical than general usage in England. In France the term is in more general use, especially for Normandy, with a similar meaning.

==Etymology==
[[File:Bocage country at Cotentin Peninsula.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Bocage country on the [[Cotentin Peninsula]], Lower Normandy]]
[[File:Bocagenormandy.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Location of bocage (in the context of [[Operation Overlord]])]]

''Bocage'' is a [[Norman language|Norman]] word that comes from the Old Norman ''boscage'' (Anglo-Norman ''boscage'', Old French ''boschage''), from the Old French root ''bosc'' ("wood") &gt; Modern French ''bois'' ("wood") cf. Medieval Latin ''boscus'' (first mentioned in 704 AD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnrtl.fr/etymologie/bocage|title=BOCAGE : Etymologie de BOCAGE|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Norman toponymy|Norman place names]] retain it as ''Bosc-'', ''-bosc'', ''Bosc-'', pronounced  traditionally {{IPA-fr|bɔk|}} or {{IPA|[bo]}}. The [[suffix]] ''-age'' means "a general thing". The ''boscage'' form was used in English for leafy decoration such as is found on eighteenth-century porcelain; now this usually called "bocage". Similar words occur in Scandinavian (cf. Swedish ''buskage'') and other Germanic languages (cf. Dutch ''bos'', ''boshaag''); the original root is thought to be the Proto-Germanic ''*bŏsk-''. The ''boscage'' form seems to have developed its meaning under the influence of eighteenth-century [[romanticism]].

The 1934 ''Nouveau Petit Larousse'' defined ''bocage'' as 'a ''bosquet'', a little wood, an agreeably shady wood' and a ''bosquet'' as a little wood, a clump of trees'. By 2006, the ''Petit Larousse'' definition had become '(Norman word) Region where the fields and meadows are enclosed by earth banks carrying hedges or rows of trees and where the habitation is generally [[Dispersed settlement|dispersed]] in farms and hamlets.'

==Historic role==
===England===
[[File:Mamtor-valley.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|English bocage ([[Edale]] valley, [[Peak District]])]]

In [[Southeast England]], in spite of a [[sedimentary]] soil which would not fit this landscape, a bocage resulted from the movement of the [[enclosure]] of the [[open-field system|open field]]s.

England developed in the 17th century an ambitious sea policy.
It imported Russian wheat, cheaper than English wheat.
The enclosures favoured [[sheep]] husbandry and limited English cereal production.
As a consequence of this policy, the [[rural exodus]] was amplified, accelerating the [[Industrial Revolution]].
The surplus of agricultural workers migrated to the cities to work in factories.

===Normandy===
In [[Normandy]], the bocage acquired a particular significance in the [[Chouannerie]] during the French Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Moulin, Mémoires de Michelot Moulin sur la Chouannerie normande, A. Picard, 1893, pp.88–89&lt;/ref&gt; It was also significant during the [[Invasion of Normandy|Battle of Normandy]] in World War II, as it made progress against the German defenders difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cgsc.cdmhost.com/cdm/ref/collection/p4013coll8/id/2707|title=Combined Arms Research Library (CARL) Digital Library|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, "[[Rhino tank]]s" fitted with bocage-cutting modifications were developed. American personnel usually referred to ''bocage'' as ''[[hedge]]rows''. The German army also used [[sunken lane]]s to implement strong points and defenses to stop the American troops on the [[Cotentin]] peninsula and around the town of [[Saint-Lô]].&lt;ref&gt;George Bernage, Objectif Saint-Lô : 7 juin-18 juillet 1944, Edition Heimdal, 2012, p.97&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Boulders Beach''' is a sheltered beach made up of inlets between [[granite]] boulders, from which the name originated. It is located in the [[Cape Peninsula]], near [[Simon's Town]] towards [[Cape Point]], near [[Cape Town]] in the [[Western Cape]] province of [[South Africa]]. It is also commonly known as Boulders Bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.capetown.travel/attractions/entry/Boulders_penguin_colony# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-03-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312224411/http://www.capetown.travel/attractions/entry/Boulders_penguin_colony# |archive-date=2014-03-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a popular tourist stop because of a colony of [[African penguin]]s which settled there in 1982.  Boulders Beach forms part of the [[Table Mountain National Park]].

These African penguins are only found on the coastlines of Southern Africa - (South Africa &amp; Namibia). These penguins are currently on the verge of extinction. As a result, the penguins are under the protection of the Cape Nature Conservation.

Although set in the midst of a residential area, it is one of the few sites where this vulnerable bird (''[[Spheniscus demersus]]'') can be observed at close range, wandering freely in a protected natural environment. From just two breeding pairs in 1982, the penguin colony has grown to about 3,000 birds in recent years. This is partly due to the reduction in commercial pelagic trawling in [[False Bay]], which has increased the supply of [[pilchard]]s and [[anchovy]], which form part of the penguins' diet.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sanparks.co.za/parks/table_mountain/tourism/attractions.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Bordered mainly by indigenous bush above the high-water mark on the one side, and the clear water of [[False Bay]] on the other, the area comprises a number of small sheltered bays, partially enclosed by [[granite]] boulders that are 540 million years old.

The most popular recreational spot is Boulders Beach, but the penguins are best viewed from Foxy Beach, where newly constructed boardwalks take visitors to within a few meters of the birds. It is also a popular swimming beach, although people are restricted to beaches adjacent to the penguin colony.

{{Confuse|Centralized government}}
{{Forms of government}}
A '''central government''' is the [[government]] that holds absolute supremacy over a [[unitary state]]. Its equivalent in a [[federation]] is the [[Federation#Federal governments|federal government]], which may have distinct powers at various levels authorized or delegated to it by its [[Federated state|federated states]], though the adjective 'central' is sometimes also used to describe it.&lt;ref name=USWH&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/our-government/the-constitution |title=The Constitution |publisher=US federal government |accessdate=17 Jul 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100717011932/http://www.whitehouse.gov/our-government/the-constitution/ |archivedate=2010-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The structure of central governments vary. Many countries have created autonomous regions by delegating powers from the central government to governments on subnational level, such as regional, state, provincial, local and other instances. Based on a broad definition of a basic political system, there are two or more levels of government that exist within an established territory and govern through common institutions with overlapping or shared powers as prescribed by a [[constitution]] or other law.

Common responsibilities of this level of government which are not granted to lower levels are maintaining [[national security]] and exercising international [[diplomacy]], including the right to sign binding [[treaties]]. Basically, the central government has the power to make laws for the whole country, in contrast with [[local government]]s.

The difference between a central government and a federal government is that the autonomous status of self-governing regions exists by the sufferance of the central government and are often created through a process of [[devolution]]. As such they may be unilaterally revoked with a simple change in the law. An example of this was done in 1973 when the [[Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973]] abolished the [[Executive Committee of the Privy Council of Northern Ireland|government of Northern Ireland]] which had been created under the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]]. It is common for a federal government to be brought into being by agreement between a number of formally independent states and therefore its powers to affect the status of the balance of powers is significantly smaller (i.e. the United States). Thus federal governments are often established voluntarily from 'below' whereas devolution grants self-government from above.

* {{flagicon|Vietnam}} [[Government of Vietnam|Vietnam]]

=== Federations ===
A federal government is the common or national government of a [[federation]]. The [[United States]] is considered the first modern federation. After declaring independence from Britain, the U.S. adopted its first constitution, the [[Articles of Confederation]] in 1781. This was the first step towards federalism by establishing the confederal Congress. However, Congress was limited as to its ability to pursue economic, military, and judiciary reform. In 1787, a [[Constitutional_Convention_(United_States)|Constitutional Convention]] drafted the [[United States Constitution]] during the [[Philadelphia Convention]]. After the ratification of the Constitution by nine states in 1788, the U.S. was officially a federation, putting the U.S. in a unique position where the central government exists by the sufferance of the individual states rather than the reverse. 

Other states followed suit in establishing federal governments: [[Switzerland]] (1848); [[Canada]] (1867); [[Germany]] (1871 and again 1949); [[Brazil]] (1891); [[Australia]] (1901); [[Austria]] (1920 and again 1945) and [[India]] (1947 and again 1950).&lt;ref&gt;Watts, R., "Comparing Federal Systems" (2nd ed.) SPC Queen's U (1999) pp 20–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include:

'''Ceres''' is a [[non-profit]] [[sustainability]] advocacy organization based in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. Founded in 1989, Ceres' mission is to "mobilize investor and business leadership to build a thriving, sustainable global economy". Ceres brings together disparate stakeholders - investors, companies and public interest groups - to accelerate and expand the adoption of sustainable business practices and [[solution]]s to build a healthy global economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Investing in sustainability |url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/kt-article-display-1.asp?xfile=data/todayevent/2013/January/todayevent_January8.xml&amp;section=todayevent |newspaper=Khaleej Times |date=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Ceres was named one of the 100 most influential players in corporate governance by ''Directorship'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.directorship.com/directorship-honors-the-100 |title=Directorship Honors the 100 Most Influential Players in Corporate Governance |accessdate=2009-06-19 |publisher=Directorship Magazine |date=December 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ceres was a recipient of the [[Skoll Foundation]] Award for Social Entrepreneurship in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skollfoundation.org/media/press_releases/internal/031406.asp |title=Skoll Foundation Awards $16 Million to Nonprofits Around the World in Support of Social Entrepreneurship |accessdate=2009-06-19 |publisher=Skoll Foundation |date=March 14, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090518141948/http://www.skollfoundation.org/media/press_releases/internal/031406.asp |archivedate=May 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a recipient of the ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]'' Social Capitalist Awards in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/social/2008/profiles/ceres.html |title=The 2008 Social Capitalist Awards: Ceres |accessdate=2009-06-19 |work=Fast Company |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409130425/http://www.fastcompany.com/social/2008/profiles/ceres.html |archivedate=2009-04-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 2017, its president is [[Mindy Lubber]].

== History ==
Ceres was founded in 1989 when Joan Bavaria, then-president of Trillium Asset Management, formed an alliance with leading environmentalists with the goal of changing corporate environmental practices. She named the organization the "'''C'''oalition for '''E'''nvironmentally '''R'''esponsible '''E'''conomie'''S'''", or CERES. [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] was the ancient Roman goddess of fertility and agriculture.

That same year, following the [[Exxon Valdez oil spill]], CERES announced the creation of the Valdez Principles (later renamed the CERES Principles&lt;ref name="ceres_principles"/&gt;), a 10-point code of corporate environmental conduct to be publicly endorsed by Ceres companies.

In 1993, following lengthy negotiations, [[Sunoco]] became the first [[Fortune 500]] company to endorse the Ceres Principles. Since then, over 50 companies have endorsed the Ceres Principles, including 13 Fortune 500 companies that have adopted their own equivalent environmental principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ceres.org/Page.aspx?pid%3D416 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530121630/http://www.ceres.org/Page.aspx?pid=416 |archivedate=2009-05-30 |df= }} Ceres website&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fiasco di chianti monteriggioni.jpg|thumb|right|A bottle of Chianti wine enclosed in a traditional ''[[fiasco (bottle)|fiasco]]''.]]
A '''Chianti wine''' ({{IPA-it|'kjanti}}) is any [[wine]] produced in the Chianti region, in central [[Tuscan wine|Tuscany]], Italy. It was historically associated with a squat [[bottle]] enclosed in a straw basket, called a ''[[fiasco (bottle)|fiasco]]'' ("flask"; ''pl. fiaschi''). However, the ''fiasco'' is only used by a few makers of the wine as most Chianti is now bottled in more standard shaped wine bottles. [[Baron]] [[Bettino Ricasoli]] (later [[Prime Minister of Italy|Prime Minister]] of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]]) created the Chianti recipe of 70% [[Sangiovese]], 15% [[Canaiolo]] and 15% [[Malvasia|Malvasia bianca]] in the middle of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 162-163"&gt;J. Robinson (ed) ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'' Third Edition  pg 162-163 Oxford University Press 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first definition of a wine-area called ''Chianti'' was made in 1716. It described the area near the villages of [[Gaiole (Chianti)|Gaiole]], [[Castellina (Chianti)|Castellina]] and [[Radda (Chianti)|Radda]]; the so-called ''Lega del Chianti'' and later ''Provincia del Chianti'' (Chianti province). In 1932 the Chianti area was completely re-drawn and divided in seven sub-areas: Classico, Colli Aretini, Colli Fiorentini, Colline Pisane, Colli Senesi, Montalbano and Rùfina. Most of the villages that in 1932 were suddenly included in the new Chianti Classico area added ''in Chianti'' to their name-such as [[Greve in Chianti]] which amended its name in 1972. Wines labelled "Chianti Classico" come from the biggest sub-area of Chianti, that includes the original Chianti heartland. Only Chianti from this sub-zone may boast the black rooster seal (known in Italian as a ''gallo nero'') on the neck of the bottle, which indicates that the producer of the wine is a member of the Chianti Classico Consortium, the local association of producers.&lt;ref&gt;Consorzio del Marchio Storico&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Consorzio del vino Chianti Classico&lt;/ref&gt;  Other variants, with the exception of Rufina from the north-east side of [[Florence]] and Montalbano in the south of [[Pistoia]], originate in the respective named provinces: [[Province of Siena|Siena]] for the Colli Senesi, [[Province of Florence|Florence]] for the Colli Fiorentini, [[Province of Arezzo|Arezzo]] for the Colli Aretini and [[Province of Pisa|Pisa]] for the Colline Pisane. In 1996 part of the Colli Fiorentini sub-area was renamed ''Montespertoli''.

During the 1970s producers started to reduce the quantity of white grapes in Chianti. In 1995 it became legal to produce a Chianti with 100% Sangiovese. For a wine to retain the name of Chianti, it must be produced with at least 80% Sangiovese grapes.&lt;ref name="Dummies pg 147-159"&gt;M. Ewing-Mulligan &amp; E. McCarthy ''Italian Wines for Dummies'' pg 147-159 Hungry Minds 2001 {{ISBN|0-7645-5355-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aged Chianti (38 months instead of 4–7) may be labelled as Riserva. Chianti that meets more stringent requirements (lower yield, higher alcohol content and dry extract) may be labelled as [[Chianti Superiore]], although Chianti from the "Classico" sub-area is not allowed in any event to be labelled as "Superiore".

==History==
{{Main|History of Chianti}}

[[File:Grand Duke CosimoIII of Tuscany by van Douven.jpg|left|thumb|150px|left|In 1716 Cosimo III de' Medici, the Grand Duke of Tuscany, legislated the first official boundaries of the Chianti region in what is today part of the Chianti Classico DOCG.]]

The earliest documentation of a "Chianti wine" dates back to the 13th century when viticulture was known to flourish in the ''"Chianti Mountains"'' around Florence. The merchants in the nearby townships of Castellina, Gaiole and Radda formed the ''Lega del Chianti'' (League of Chianti) to produce and promote the local wine. In 1398, records note that the earliest incarnation of Chianti was as a white wine.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 162-163"/&gt; In 1716 [[Cosimo III de' Medici]], Grand Duke of Tuscany issued an edict legislating that the three villages of the ''Lega del Chianti'' ([[Castellina in Chianti]], [[Gaiole in Chianti]] and [[Radda in Chianti]]) as well as the village of [[Greve (Chianti)|Greve]] and a {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=mid|-long stretch|abbr=off|order=flip}} of hillside north of Greve near [[:it:Spedaluzzo|Spedaluzzo]] as the only officially recognised producers of Chianti. This delineation existed until July 1932, when the Italian government expanded the Chianti zone to include the outlying areas of [[Barberino Val d'Elsa]], [[Chiocchio]], [[:it:Robbiano|Robbiano]], [[San Casciano in Val di Pesa]] and [[:it:Strada in Chianti|Strada]]. Subsequent expansions in 1967 would eventually bring the Chianti zone to cover a very large area all over central Tuscany.

[[File:Bettino Ricasoli.jpg|150px|thumb|Baron [[Bettino Ricasoli]] developed the first "modern" Chianti recipe that was Sangiovese based.]]

By the 18th century, Chianti was widely recognised as a red wine, but the exact composition and grape varieties used to make Chianti at this point is unknown. [[Ampelographer]]s find clues about which grape varieties were popular at the time in the writings of Italian writer [[Cosimo Villifranchi]] who noted that [[Canaiolo]] was widely planted variety in the area along with Sangiovese, [[Mammolo]] and [[Marzemino]].&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 162-163"/&gt; It was not until the work of the Italian statesman [[Bettino Ricasoli]] that the modern "Chianti recipe" as a Sangiovese-based wine would take shape.&lt;ref name="Johnson pg 414-420"&gt;H. Johnson ''Vintage: The Story of Wine'' pg 414-420 Simon and Schuster 1989 {{ISBN|0-671-68702-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to Ricasoli, Canaiolo was emerging as the dominant variety in the Chianti blend with Sangiovese and [[Malvasia]] playing supporting roles. In the mid-19th century, Ricasoli developed a recipe for Chianti that was based primarily on Sangiovese. His recipe called for 70% Sangiovese, 15% Canaiolo, 10% Malvasia (later amended to include [[Trebbiano]]) and 5% other local red varieties. In 1967, the Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) regulation set by the Italian government firmly established the "Ricasoli formula" of a Sangiovese-based blend with 10–30% Malvasia and Trebbiano.&lt;ref name="Wine pg 402-411"/&gt;

The late 19th century saw a period of economic and political upheaval. First came [[Uncinula necator|oidium]] and then the [[phylloxera epidemic]] would take its toll on the vineyards of Chianti just as they had ravaged vineyards across the rest of Europe. The chaos and poverty following the ''[[Risorgimento]]'' heralded the beginning of the [[Italian diaspora]] that would take Italian vineyard workers and winemakers abroad as immigrants to new lands.&lt;ref name="Johnson pg 414-420"/&gt; Those that stayed behind and replanted choose high-yielding varieties like [[Trebbiano]] and Sangiovese clones such as the ''Sangiovese di Romagna'' from the nearby [[Romagna]] region. Following the [[Second World War]], the general trend in the world wine market for cheap, easy-drinking wine saw a brief boom for the region. With over-cropping and an emphasis on quantity over quality, the reputation of Chianti among consumers eventually plummeted. By the 1950s, Trebbiano (which is known for its neutral flavours) made up to 30% of many mass-market Chiantis.&lt;ref name="MacNeil pg 376-379"&gt;K. MacNeil ''The Wine Bible'' pg 376-379 Workman Publishing 2001 {{ISBN|1-56305-434-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 20th century, Chianti was often associated with basic Chianti sold in a squat bottle enclosed in a straw basket, called a ''fiasco''. However, during the same period, a group of ambitious producers began working outside the boundaries of DOC regulations to make what they believed would be a higher quality style of Chianti. These wines eventually became known as the "[[Super Tuscans]]".&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 162-163"/&gt;
[[File:Italian DOCG Chianti label.jpg|left|thumb|The Italian DOCG Chianti label]]
Many of the producers behind the Super Tuscan movement were originally Chianti producers who were rebelling against what they felt were antiquated DOC regulations. Some of these producers wanted to make Chiantis that were 100% [[varietal]] Sangiovese. Others wanted the flexibility to experiment with blending [[French (wine)|French]] grape varieties such as [[Cabernet Sauvignon]] and [[Merlot]] or to not be required to blend in any white grape varieties. The late 20th century saw a flurry of creativity and innovation in the Chianti zones as producers experimented with new grape varieties and introduced modern wine-making techniques such as the use of new [[oak barrels (wine)|oak barrels]]. The prices and [[wine ratings]] of some Super Tuscans would regularly eclipse those of DOC sanctioned Chiantis. The success of the Super Tuscans encouraged government officials to reconsider the DOC regulations in order to bring some of these wines back into the fold labelled as Chianti.&lt;ref name="Wine pg 402-411"/&gt;

==Chianti subregions==
[[File:sottozone chianti.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Chianti wine area within Tuscany]]

The Chianti region covers a vast area of Tuscany and includes within its boundaries several overlapping ''[[Denominazione di origine controllata]]'' (DOC) and ''[[Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita]]'' (DOCG) regions. Other well known Sangiovese-based [[Tuscan wines]] such as [[Brunello di Montalcino]] and [[Vino Nobile di Montepulciano]] could be bottled and labelled under the most basic designation of "Chianti" if their producers chose to do so.&lt;ref name="Sotheby pg 282-286"&gt;T. Stevenson ''"The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia"'' pg 282-286 Dorling Kindersley 2005 {{ISBN|0-7566-1324-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the collective Chianti region more than 8 million cases of wines classified as DOC level or above are produced each year. Today, most Chianti falls under two major designations of Chianti DOCG, which includes basic level Chianti, as well as that from seven designated sub-zones, and Chianti Classico DOCG.&lt;ref name="Dummies pg 147-159"/&gt; Together, these two Chianti zones produce the largest volume of DOC/G wines in Italy.&lt;ref name="Wine pg 402-411"/&gt;

The Chianti DOCG covers all the Chianti wine and includes a large stretch of land encompassing the western reaches of the [[province of Pisa]] near the coast of the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]], the Florentine hills in the province of Florence to the north, to the [[province of Arezzo]] in the east and the Siena hills to the south. Within this regions are vineyards that overlap the DOCG regions of Brunello di Montalcino, Vino Nobile di Montepulciano and [[Vernaccia di San Gimignano]]. Any Sangiovese-based wine made according to the Chianti guidelines from these vineyards can be labelled and marked under the basic Chianti DOCG should the producer wish to use the designation.&lt;ref name="Dummies pg 147-159"/&gt;

Within the Chianti DOCG there are eight defined sub-zones that are permitted to affix their name to the [[wine label]].&lt;ref name="Sotheby pg 282-286"/&gt;  Wines that are labelled as simply Chianti are made either from a blend from these sub-zones or include grapes from peripheral areas not within the boundaries of a sub-zone. The sub-zones are (clockwise from the north): the Colli Fiorentini which is located south of the city of Florence; Chianti Rufina in the northeastern part of the zone located around the commune of [[Rufina]]; Classico in the centre of Chianti, across the provinces of Florence and Siena; Colli Aretini in the Arezzo province to the east; Colli Senesi south of Chianti Classico in the Siena hills, which is the largest of the sub-zones and includes the Brunello di Montalcino and Vino Nobile di Montepulciano areas; Colline Pisane, the westernmost sub-zone in the province of Pisa; Montespertoli located within the Colli Fiorentini around the commune of [[Montespertoli]]; Montalbano in the north-west part of the zone which includes the [[Carmignano (wine)|Carmignano]] DOCG.&lt;ref name="Dummies pg 147-159"/&gt; {{As of|2006}}, there were {{convert|786|acre|ha|order=flip}} under production in Montalbano, {{convert|2236|acre|ha|abbr=in|order=flip}} in the Colli Fiorentini, {{convert|140|acre|ha|abbr=in|order=flip}} in Montespertoli, {{convert|1840|acre|ha|abbr=in|order=flip}} in Rufina, {{convert|8780|acre|ha|abbr=in|order=flip}} in the Colli Senesi, {{convert|380|acre|ha|abbr=in|order=flip}} in Colline Pisane, {{convert|1603|acre|ha|abbr=in|order=flip}} in the Colli Aretini, and an additional {{convert|25511|acre|ha|abbr=in|order=flip}} in the peripheral areas that do not fall within one of the sub-zone classifications. Wines produced from these vineyards are labelled simply "Chianti".&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 162-163"/&gt;

===Chianti Classico===

[[File:Chianti 0002.JPG|thumb|Chianti Classico premium wine.]]
[[File:Chianti-colline2-2.jpg|thumb|left|Vineyards in [[Gaiole in Chianti]] in the Chianti Classico area.]]
[[File:Chianti Classico.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Iconic black rooster seal of the Consorzio Chianti Classico.]]

The original area dictated by the edict of [[Cosimo III de' Medici]] would eventually be considered the heart of the modern "Chianti Classico" subregion.&lt;ref name="Wine pg 402-411"&gt;A. Domine (ed.) ''Wine'', pp. 402-411, Ullmann Publishing, 2008 {{ISBN|978-3-8331-4611-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wine pg 402-411"/&gt; {{As of|2006}}, there were {{convert|17,640|acre|ha|abbr=in|order=flip}} of vineyards in the Chianti Classico subregion.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 162-163"/&gt; The Chianti Classico subregion covers an area of approximate {{convert|100|sqmi|abbr=in|order=flip}} between the city of [[Florence]] to the north and [[Siena]] to the south. The four communes of Castellina in Chianti, Gaiole in Chianti, Greve in Chianti and Radda in Chianti are located entirely within the boundaries of the Classico area with parts of Barberino Val d'Elsa, San Casciano in Val di Pesa and [[Tavarnelle Val di Pesa]] in the [[province of Florence]] as well as [[Castelnuovo Berardenga]] and [[Poggibonsi]] in the [[province of Siena]] included within the permitted boundaries of Chianti Classico. The soil and geography of this subregion can be quite varied, with altitudes ranging from {{convert|820|to|2000|ft|abbr=in|order=flip}}, and rolling hills producing differing [[macroclimate]]s. There are two main soil types in the area: a weathered sandstone known as ''[[alberese]]'' and a bluish-gray [[chalk]]y [[marlstone]] known as ''[[galestro]]''.&lt;ref name="Wine pg 402-411"/&gt; The soil in the north is richer and more fertile with more ''galestro'', with the soil gradually becoming harder and stonier with more ''albarese'' in the south. In the north, the [[Arno River]] can have an influence on the climate, keeping the temperatures slightly cooler, an influence that diminishes further south in the warmer Classico territory towards Castelnuovo Berardenga.&lt;ref name="Dummies pg 147-159"/&gt;

Chianti Classico are premium Chianti wines that tend to be medium-bodied with firm [[tannins (wine)|tannins]] and medium-high to high [[acidity (wine)|acidity]]. Floral, cherry and light nutty notes are characteristic [[aromas (wine)|aromas]] with the wines expressing more notes on the mid-[[palate]] and [[finish (wine)|finish]] than at the front of the mouth. As with [[Bordeaux (wine)|Bordeaux]], the different zones of Chianti Classico have unique characteristics that can be exemplified and perceived in some wines from those areas. According to [[Master of Wine]] [[Mary Ewing-Mulligan]], Chianti Classico wines from the Castellina area tend to have a very delicate aroma and flavour, Castelnuovo Berardegna wines tend to be the [[most ripe (wine)|most ripe]] and richest tasting, wines from Gaiole tend to have been characterised by their structure and firm tannins while wines from the Greve area tend to have very concentrated flavours.&lt;ref name="Dummies pg 147-159"/&gt;

The production of Chianti Classico is realised under the supervision of [[:it:Consorzio del Vino Chianti Classico|Consorzio del Vino Chianti Classico]], a union of producers in the Chianti Classico subregion. The Consorzio was founded with the aim of promoting the wines of the subregion, improving quality and preventing [[wine fraud]]. Since the 1980s, the foundation has sponsored extensive research into the viticultural and winemaking practice of the Chianti Classico area, particularly in the area of clonal research. In the last three decades, more than 50% of the vineyards in the Chianti Classico subregion have been replanted with improved Sangiovese clones and modern vineyard techniques as part of the Consorzio Chianti Classico's project "Chianti 2000".&lt;ref name="Wine pg 402-411"/&gt;

In 2014 a new category of Chianti Classico was introduced: Chianti Classico Gran Selezione.&lt;ref name=CCGS&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chianticlassico.com/en/2014/02/chianti-classico-gran-selezione-carta-d%E2%80%99identita/|title=Chianti Classico Gran Selezione: Identity Card|work=chianticlassico.com|publisher=Consorzio Vino Chianti Classico|accessdate=January 22, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122121031/http://www.chianticlassico.com/en/2014/02/chianti-classico-gran-selezione-carta-d%E2%80%99identita/|archivedate=22 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gran Selezione is made exclusively from a winery’s own grapes grown according to stricter regulations compared to regular Chianti Classico.&lt;ref name=CCGS /&gt; Gran Selezione is granted to a Chianti Classico after it passes a suitability test conducted

=== Greater Chianti region ===

[[File:Fiaschi of basic Chianti.jpg|right|thumb|''Fiascos'' of basic Chianti that does not specify any sub-zone on the label. This wine may be a blend from several zones.]]

Outside of the Chianti Classico area, the wines of the Chianti sub-zone of Rufina are among the most widely recognised and exported from the Chianti region. Located in the [[Arno]] valley near the town of [[Pontassieve]], the Rufina region includes much area in the [[Pomino]] region, an area that has a long history of wine production. The area is noted for the cool climate of its elevated vineyards located up to {{convert|2,950|ft|abbr=in|order=flip}}. The [[vineyard soil]]s of the area are predominantly [[marl]] and [[chalk]]. The Florentine merchant families of the [[Antinori]] and [[Frescobaldi]] own the majority of the vineyards in Rufina. Chianti from the Rufina area is characterised by its multi-layered [[complexity (wine)|complexity]] and elegance.&lt;ref name="Wine pg 402-411"/&gt;

The Colli Fiorentini subregion has seen an influx of activity and new vineyard development in recent years as wealthy Florentine business people move to the country to plant vineyards and open wineries. Many foreign "[[flying winemaker]]s" have had a hand in this development, bringing global [[viticulture]] and [[winemaking]] techniques to the Colli Fiorentini. Located in the hills between the Chianti Classico area and Arno valley, the wines of the Colli Fiorentini vary widely depending on producer, but tend to have a simple structure with strong character and fruit notes.&lt;ref name="Wine pg 402-411"/&gt; The Montespertoli sub-zone was part of the Colli Fiorentini sub-zone until 2002 when it became its own tiny enclave.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 162-163"/&gt;

The Montalbano subregion is located in the shadow of the Carmignano DOCG, with much of the best Sangiovese going to that wine. A similar situation exists in the Colli Senesi which includes the well known DOCG region of Vino Nobile di Montepulciano. Both regions rarely appear on wine labels that are exported out of Tuscany. The Colli Pisane area produces typical Chiantis with the lightest body and color. The Colli Aretini is a relatively new and emerging area that has seen an influx of investment and new winemaking in recent years.&lt;ref name="Wine pg 402-411"/&gt;

==Grapes and classification==
Since 1996 the blend for Chianti and Chianti Classico has been 75–100% Sangiovese, up to 10% Canaiolo and up to 20% of any other approved red grape variety such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot or Syrah. Since 2006, the use of white grape varieties such as Malvasia and Trebbiano have been prohibited in Chianti Classico.&lt;ref name="Robinson.com"&gt;Jancis Robinson ''"[http://www.jancisrobinson.com/articles/20080701.html Chianti Classico - thoroughly red now]"'' 5 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Chianti Classico must have a minimum [[alcohol level]] of at least 12% with a minimum of 7 months aging in oak, while Chianti Classicos labeled ''[[riserva]]'' must be aged at least 24 months at the winery, with a minimum alcohol level of at least 12.5%.&lt;ref name="Dummies pg 147-159"/&gt; The [[harvest (wine)|harvest]] [[yields (wine)|yields]] for Chianti Classico are restricted to no more than {{convert|7.5|tonne/ha|0|abbr=in}}. For basic Chianti, the minimum alcohol level is 11.5% with yields restricted to {{convert|9|tonne/ha|0|abbr=in}}.&lt;ref name="Wine pg 402-411"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Disciplinari dei vini DOP e IGP italiani – Disciplinari DOCG|url=http://www.politicheagricole.it/flex/cm/pages/ServeAttachment.php/L/IT/D/7%252Ff%252F7%252FD.17d17e8733bdd61a0792/P/BLOB%3AID%3D4625|publisher=Ministero delle politiche agricole alimentari e forestali|language=Italian|accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aging for basic Chianti DOCG is much less stringent with most varieties allowed to be released to the market on 1 March following the [[vintage]] year. The sub-zones of Colli Fiorentini, Montespertoli and Rufina must be aged for a further three months and not released until 1 June. All Chianti Classicos must be held back until 1 October in the year following the vintage.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 162-163"/&gt;

[[File:Sangiovese grapes for chianti.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sangiovese]] grapes used to make Chianti wine]]
[[Jancis Robinson]] notes that Chianti is sometimes called the "[[Bordeaux (wine)|Bordeaux]] of [[Italy (wine)|Italy]]" but the structure of the wines is very different from any French wine .&lt;ref name="Robinson.com"/&gt; The flexibility in the blending recipe for Chianti accounts for some of the variability in styles among Chiantis. Lighter [[body (wine)|bodied]] styles will generally have a higher proportion of white grape varieties blended in, while Chiantis that have only red grape varieties will be fuller and richer. While only 15% of Cabernet Sauvignon is permitted in the blend, the nature of the grape variety can have a dominant personality in the Chianti blend and be a strong influence in the wine.&lt;ref name="Dummies pg 147-159"/&gt;

Chianti Classico wines are characterised in their youth by their predominantly floral and [[cinnamon]] spicy bouquet. As the wine [[ages (wine)|ages]], aromas of [[tobacco]] and [[leather]] can emerge. Chiantis tend to have medium-high [[acidity (wine)|acidity]] and medium [[tannins (wine)|tannins]]. The acidity in the wines make them very flexible with [[food and wine pairings]], particularly with [[Italian cuisine]]s that feature [[tomato sauce|red sauce]], as well as with [[beef]], [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]] and [[wild game|game]].&lt;ref name="Wine pg 402-411"/&gt; Basic level Chianti is often characterised by its juicy fruit notes of [[cherry]], [[plum]] and [[raspberry]] and can range from simple quaffing wines to those approaching the level of Chianti Classico. Wine expert [[Tom Stevenson]] notes that these basic everyday-drinking Chiantis are at their peak drinking qualities often between three and five years after vintage with premium examples having the potential to age for four to eight years. Well-made examples of Chianti Classico often have the potential to age and improve in the bottle for six to twenty years.&lt;ref name="Sotheby pg 282-286"/&gt;

===Chianti Superiore===
Chianti Superiore is an Italian DOCG wine produced in the provinces of Arezzo, Florence, Pisa, Pistoia, Prato and Siena, in Tuscany. Superiore is a specification for wines produced with a stricter rule of production than other Chianti wines. Chianti Superiore has been authorised since 1996.&lt;ref&gt;D.M. 5.08.1996&lt;/ref&gt; Chianti Superiore wines can be produced only from grapes cultivated in the Chianti wine areas except from those vineyards that are registered in the Chianti Classico sub-zone. Vineyards registered in Chianti sub-zones other than Classico can produce Chianti Superiore wines but must omit the sub-zone name on the label. Aging is calculated from 1 January after the picking. Chianti Superiore cannot be sold to the consumer before nine months of aging, of which three must be in the bottle. Therefore, it cannot be bottled before the June after picking or sold to consumers before the next September.

The '''djong''', '''jong''', or '''jung''' (also called '''junk''' in English) is a type of ancient sailing ship originating from [[Java]] that was widely used by [[Javanese people|Javanese]] and [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] sailors. The word was and is spelled ''jong'' in its languages of origin, the "djong" spelling being the colonial Dutch romanisation.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;

Djongs are used mainly as seagoing passenger and cargo vessels. They traveled as far as [[Ghana]] or even [[Brazil]] in ancient times.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Cartas de Afonso de Albuquerque, Volume 1, p. 64, April 1, 1512&lt;/ref&gt; The average burthen was 4-500 tons, with a range of 85-700 tons. In the [[Majapahit]] era these vessels were used as warship, but still predominantly as transport vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anthony Reid and the Study of the Southeast Asian Past|last=Reid|first=Anthony|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|year=2012|isbn=9814311960|location=Singapore|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''jong'' or ''jung'' derives from the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] word for boat (船),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Collins Compact Dictionary|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2002|isbn=0-00-710984-9|page=483}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Junk|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=junk|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; originally pronounced ''ɦljon'' in [[Old Chinese]]. It is related to several Southeast Asian terms for boat, and entered the [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] and [[Malay language]]s at an early date. The word jong can be found in a number of ancient Javanese inscriptions dating to the 9th century.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manguin|first=Pierre-Yves|date=1993|title=Trading Ships of the South China Sea. Shipbuilding Techniques and Their Role in the History of the Development of Asian Trade Networks|url=|journal=Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient|volume=|pages=253-280|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is first recorded in the [[Malay language|Malay]] language by the 15th century, when a Chinese word list identified it as a Malay term for ship. The late 15th century [[Undang-Undang Laut Melaka|Malay Maritime Laws]] uses jong frequently as the word for freight ships.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Charting the Shape of Early Modern Southeast Asia|last=Reid|first=Anthony|publisher=Silkworm Books|year=2000|isbn=9747551063|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; European writings from 1345 through 1601 use a variety of related terms, including &lt;i&gt;jonque&lt;/i&gt; ([[French language|French]]), ''ioncque'' ([[Italian language|Italian]]), ''iuncque'' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]), and ''ionco'' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnrtl.fr/etymologie/jonque|title=JONQUE : Etymologie de JONQUE|website=www.cnrtl.fr|language=fr|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; The "djong" spelling is of colonial Dutch origin, rendering the j sound as "dj", though both traditional British and current Indonesian orthography romanises it as ''jong''.&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;{{cite book|title=Illustrated Oxford Dictionary|publisher=DK|year=1998|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the Nusantara==
The [[Nusantara|Nusantara archipelago]] was known for production of large junks. A Portuguese account described how the Javanese people already had advanced seafaring skills when they arrived:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Decada Quarta da Asia|last=de Couto|first=Diogo|publisher=Em Lisboa : Impresso por Pedro Crasbeeck|year=1602|isbn=|location=Portugal|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|text=([[Javanese people|The Javanese]]) are all men very experienced in the art of navigation, to the point that they claim to be the most ancient of all, although many others give this honor to the Chinese, and affirm that this art was handed on from them to the Javanese. But it is certain that they formerly navigated to the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and were in communication with the east coast of the island of San Laurenzo ([[Madagascar]]), where there are many brown and Javanized natives who say they are descended from them.|sign=Diogo de Couto|source=Decada Quarta da Asia}}When the Portuguese captured Malacca, they recovered a chart from a Javanese pilot, Albuquerque said:&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;{{quote|"...a large map of a Javanese pilot, containing the Cape of Good Hope, Portugal and the land of [[Brazil]], the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Persian Gulf|Sea of Persia]], the Clove Islands, the navigation of the Chinese and the Gom, with their rhumbs and direct routes followed by the ships, and the hinterland, and how the kingdoms border on each other. It seems to me. Sir, that this was the best thing I have ever seen, and Your Highness will be very pleased to see it; it had the names in Javanese writing, but I had with me a Javanese who could read and write. I send this piece to Your Highness, which Francisco Rodrigues traced from the other, in which Your Highness can truly see where the Chinese and Gores come from, and the course your ships must take to the Clove Islands, and where the gold mines lie, and the islands of Java and Banda, of actions of the period, than any of his contemporaries; and it appears highly  probable, that what he has related is substantially true: but there is also reason to believe that he composed his work from recollection, after his return to Europe, and he may not have been scrupulous in supplying from a fertile imagination the unavoidable failures of a memory, however richly stored."|Letter of Albuquerque to King Manuel I of Portugal, April 1512.|source=}}
For seafaring, the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] people independently invented [[Junk rig|junk sails]], made from woven mats reinforced with bamboo, at least several hundred years before 1 BC. By the time of the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC to 220 AD) the Chinese were using such sails, having learned it from Malay sailors visiting their Southern coast. Beside this type of sail, they also made [[Lug sail|balance lugsail]]s (tanja sails). The invention of these types of sail made sailing around the western coast of Africa possible, because of their ability to sail against the wind.&lt;ref&gt;Shaffer, Lynda Norene (1996). ''Maritime Southeast Asia to 1500.'' M.E. Sharpe. Quoting Johnstone 1980: 191-192&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Duarte Barosa reported that the ships from Java, which have four masts, are very different from Portuguese ships. A Javanese ship is made of very thick wood, and as it gets old, the Javanese fix it with new boards. The rope and the sail is made with [[Willow|osier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Early Kingdoms of the Indonesian Archipelago and the Malay Peninsula|last=Michel Munoz|first=Paul|publisher=Continental Sales|year=2008|isbn=9814610119|location=|pages=396–397}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Javanese junks were made using jaty/jati wood ([[teak]]) at the time of his report (1512), at that time Chinese junks were still using softwood as their main material.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Javanese ship's hull is formed by joining planks to the keel and then to each other by wooden dowels, without using either a frame (except for subsequent reinforcement), nor any iron bolts or nails. The vessel was similarly pointed at both ends, and carried two oar-like rudders and lateen-rigged sails.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Tanja sails, in the early European reports, are called lateen sail. Also, this type of sail may looked like triangular sail when sighted from afar.&lt;/ref&gt; It differed markedly from the Chinese vessel, which had its hull fastened by [[strake]]s and iron nails to a frame and to structurally essential bulkheads which divided the cargo space. The Chinese vessel had a single rudder on a transom stern, and (except in [[Fujian]] and [[Guangdong]]) they had flat bottoms without keels.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Historical engravings also depict usage of [[bowsprit]]s and [[Spritsail (square-rigged)|bowsprit sail]]s, with deckhouse above the upper deck, and the appearance of stemposts and [[sternpost]]s.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;[[File:Demak locator-2.png|thumb|Muria strait during Pati Unus reign. In 1657 this strait has been narrowed or disappeared.]] 
Barosa also reported various goods carried by these ships, which include rice, meat of cows, sheep, pigs, and deer, dried and salted, many chickens, garlic, and onions. Traded weapons include lances, dagger, and swords, worked in inlaid metal and very good steel. Also brought with them [[cubebs]] and yellow die called cazumba (''kasumba'') and gold which is produced in Java. Barosa mention places and route in which these ships visited, which include Malacca, China, Molucca Islands, Sumatra, Tenasserim, Pegu, Bengal, Palicat, Coromandel, Malabar, Cambay, and Aden. The passenger brought their wives and children, even some of them never leave the ship to go on shore, nor have any other dwelling, for they are born and die in the ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Description of the Coasts of East Africa and Malabar in the Beginning of the Sixteenth Century|last=Barosa|first=Duarte|publisher=The Hakluyt Society|year=1866|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The size and special requirements of the ''djong'' demanded access to expertise and materials not available everywhere. Consequently, the ''djong'' was mainly constructed in two major shipbuilding centres around Java: north coastal Java, especially around [[Rembang Regency|Rembang]]-[[Demak Regency|Demak]] (along the Muria strait) and [[Cirebon]]; and the south coast of Borneo ([[Banjarmasin]]) and the adjacent islands. A common feature of these places was their accessibility to forests of teak, as this wood was highly valued because of its resistance to [[Teredo navalis|shipworm]]. Southern Borneo's supply of teak would have come from north Java, whereas Borneo itself would supply [[Eusideroxylon zwageri|ironwood]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge History of Southeast Asia|last=Manguin|first=P.Y.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1980|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Greek Astronomer, [[Ptolemy|Claudius Ptolemaeus]], ca. AD 100, said in his work ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]'' that huge ships came from the east of India. This was also confirmed by an anonymous work called ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea|Periplus Marae Erythraensis]]''. Both mention a type of ship called ''kolandiaphonta'', which may be a translation of the Chinese word ''K'un-lun po''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Phantom Voyagers: Evidence of Indonesian Settlement in Africa in Ancient Times|last=Dick-Read|first=Robert|publisher=Thurlton|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 3rd century book ''[[Yiwu Zhi|Strange Things of the South]]'' (南州異物志) by Wan Chen (萬震) describes ships capable of carrying 700 people together with 260 tons of cargo ("more than 10,000 "斛"). These ships came from ''K'un-lun'', meaning "Southern country" or "Islands below the wind." The ships called ''K'un-lun po'' (or ''K'un-lun bo''), could be more than 50 meters in length and had a [[freeboard]] of 4-7 meters. Wan Chen explains the ships' design as follows:{{quote|The four sails do not face directly forward, but are set obliquely, and so arranged that they can all be fixed in the same direction, to receive the wind and to spill it.  Those sails which are behind the most windward one receiving the pressure of the wind, throw it from one to the other, so that they all profit from its force.  If it is violent, (the sailors) diminish or augment the surface of the sails according to the conditions.  This oblique rig, which permits the sails to receive from one another the breath of the wind, obviates the anxiety attendant upon having high masts. Thus these ships sail without avoiding strong winds and dashing waves, by the aid of which they can make great speed.|Wan Chen, ''[[Yiwu Zhi|Strange Things of the South]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Yiwu Zhi|Strange Things of the South]]'', Wan Chen, from Robert Temple&lt;/ref&gt;}} A 260 CE book by Kang Tai (康泰) also described these ships as seven-masted vessels called ''K'un-lun po'' (Southern country ships) that could travel as far as [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Southeast Asia in the Age of Commerce|last=Reid|first=Anthony|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1988|isbn=|location=New Haven|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "po" is derived from the Malay word [[Proa|proa-prauw-perahu]], which means large ship. Note that in modern usage, perahu refers to a small [[boat]]. [[Faxian]] in his return journey to China from India (413-414) embarked a ship carrying 200 passengers and sailors from ''K'un-lun'' which towed a smaller ship. A cyclone struck and forced the passengers to move into the smaller ship. The crew of the smaller ship feared that the ship would be overloaded, therefore they cut the rope and separated from the big ship. Luckily the bigger ship survived,  the passengers were stranded in ''Ye-po-ti'' ([[Yawadwipa]] - Java).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Some scholars believe this place is actually [[Kalimantan]].&lt;/ref&gt; After 5 months, the crew and the passengers built a new ship comparable in size to sail back to China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Malay Peninsula: Crossroads of the Maritime Silk-Road (100 BC-1300 AD)|last=Micheal Jacq-Hergoualc'h|first=|publisher=BRILL|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=51-52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Notes on the Malay Archipelago and Malacca, Compiled from Chinese Sources|last=Groeneveldt|first=W.P.|publisher=Transactions of the Batavian Society of Arts and Science|year=1877|isbn=|location=Batavia|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Javanese Perahu.jpg|thumb|Javanese "perahu" ca. 1300.|alt=]]In ''I-ch’ieh-ching yin-i'', a dictionary compiled by [[Yiqiejing Yinyi (Huilin)|Huei-lin]] ca. 817 AD, po is mentioned several times:&lt;blockquote&gt;Ssu-ma Piao, in his commentary on Chuang Tzü, said that large ocean-going ships are called "po”.

In 1178, the [[Guangzhou]] customs officer Zhou Qufei, wrote in ''[[Lingwai Daida]]'' about the ships of the Southern country:&lt;blockquote&gt;The ships which sail the southern sea and south of it are like giant houses. When their sails are spread they are like great clouds in the sky. Their [[Rudder|rudders]] are several tens of feet long. A single ship carries several hundred men, and has in the stores a year's supply of grain. Pigs are fed and wine [[Fermentation (food)|fermented]] on board. There is no account of dead or living, no going back to the mainland when once the people have set forth upon the cerulean sea. At daybreak, when the gong sounds aboard the ship, the animals can drink their fill, and crew and passengers alike forget all dangers. To those on board everything is hidden and lost in space, mountains, landmarks, and the countries of foreigners. The shipmaster may say "To make such and such a country, with a favourable wind, in so many days, we should sight such and such a mountain, (then) the ship must steer in such and such a direction". But suddenly the wind may fall, and may not be strong enough to allow of the sighting of the mountain on the given day; in such a case, bearings may have to be changed. And the ship (on the other hand) may be carried far beyond (the landmark) and may lose its bearings. A [[gale]] may spring up, the ship may be blown hither and thither, it may meet with shoals or be driven upon hidden rocks, then it may be broken to the very roofs (of its deckhouses). A great ship with heavy cargo has nothing to fear from the high seas, but rather in shallow water it will come to grief.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 4642"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 464.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; In 1322 friar [[Odoric of Pordenone]] reported that the archipelagic vessel of the ''zunc''[um] type carried at least 700 people, either sailors or merchants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cathay and the way thither: Being a Collection of Medieval Notices of China vol. 1|last=Yule|first=Sir Henry|publisher=The Hakluyt Society|year=1866|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Majapahit Empire used jongs as its main source of naval power. It is unknown how many exactly the total number of jong used by Majapahit, but they are grouped into 5 fleets. The largest number of jong deployed in an expedition is about 400 jongs accompanied with uncountable malangbang and [[kelulus]], when Majapahit attacked Pasai.&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle of the Kings of Pasai'', 3: 98&lt;/ref&gt; Each ship was about {{convert|70|m|ft}} long, with burthen around 500 tons and could carry 600 men.

[[Wang Dayuan]]'s 1349 composition ''[[Daoyi Zhilüe|Daoyi Zhilüe Guangzheng Xia]]'' ("Description of the Barbarian of the Isles") described the so called "horse boats" at a place called Gan-mai-li in Southeast Asia. These ships were bigger than normal trading ships, with the sides constructed from multiple planks. The ships uses neither nails or mortar to join them, instead they are using coconut fibre. The ships has two or three decks, with deckhouse over the upper deck. In the lower hold they carried pressed-down [[frankincense]], above them they are carrying several hundred horses. Wang made special mention of these ships because pepper, which is also transported by them, carried to places much away with large quantity. The normal trading ships carried less than 1/10 of their cargo.&lt;ref&gt;Kwee, H. K. (1997). ''Dao Yi Zhi Lue as a maritime traders’ guidebook''. Unpublished honour’s thesis, National University of Singapore.&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually, the main vessel towed behind a smaller "tender" for landing. Data from [[Marco Polo]] records made it possible to calculate that the largest ships may have had capacities of 500-800 tons, about the same as Chinese vessels used to trade in the 19th century. The tender itself may have been able to carry about 70 tons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wake|first=Christopher|date=December 1997|title=The Great Ocean-going Ships of Southern China in the Age of Chinese Maritime Voyaging to India, Twelfth to Fifteenth Centuries|url=|journal=International Journal of Maritime History|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Niccolò da Conti]], in relating his travels in Asia between 1419 and 1444, describes ships much larger than European ships, capable of reaching 2,000 tons in size, with five sails and as many masts. The lower part is constructed with three planks, to withstand the force of the tempests to which they are much exposed. The ships are built in compartments, so that if one part is punctured, the other portion remaining intact to accomplish the voyage.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=India in the Fifteenth Century|url=https://archive.org/stream/indiainfifteenth00majorich#page/n181/mode/2up|page=27|year=1857|editor=R.

[[Fra Mauro]] in his [[Fra Mauro map|map]] explained that one junk rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and traveled far into the [[Atlantic Ocean]], in 1420:{{quote|About the year of Our Lord 1420 a ship, what is called an Indian zoncho, on a crossing of the Sea of India towards the "Isle of Men and Women", was diverted beyond the "Cape of Diab" (Shown as the Cape of Good Hope on the map), through the "Green Isles" (lit. "isole uerde", [[Cape Verde|Cabo Verde Islands]]), out into the "Sea of Darkness" (Atlantic Ocean) on a way west and southwest. Nothing but air and water was seen for 40 days and by their reckoning they ran 2,000 miles and fortune deserted them. When the stress of the weather had subsided they made the return to the said "Cape of Diab" in 70 days and drawing near to the shore to supply their wants the sailors saw the egg of a bird called [[roc (mythology)|roc]], which egg is as big as an [[amphora]].|Text from Fra Mauro map, 10-A13|&lt;ref&gt;Text from Fra Mauro map, 10-A13, original Italian: "Circa hi ani del Signor 1420 una naue ouer çoncho de india discorse per una trauersa per el mar de india a la uia de le isole de hi homeni e de le done de fuora dal cauo de diab e tra le isole uerde e le oscuritade a la uia de ponente e de garbin per 40 çornade, non trouando mai altro che aiere e aqua, e per suo arbitrio iscorse 2000 mia e declinata la fortuna i fece suo retorno in çorni 70 fina al sopradito cauo de diab.

[[File:Jong from Miller Atlas.png|thumb|426x426px|Depiction of five, six, and seven masted jongs from [[Miller Atlas]]. They are wrongly depicted as using regular rectangular sails instead of canted rectangular sails (tanja sails).]]
The Portuguese historian [[João de Barros]] (1496&amp;#x2013;1570) wrote that when a violent storm arose as Albuquerque's fleet entered the vast waters between [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Aceh]], a ship commanded by Simão Martinho was sunk, but his entire crew was rescued by [[Fernão Pires de Andrade]] and taken aboard his ship. To make up for this loss, the Portuguese captured and commandeered five ships from [[Gujarat]] that were sailing between Malacca and [[Sumatra]]. The small fleet of Albuquerque engaged an enemy "junk" ship of the Malaccan "[[Moors]]" near an island between [[Lumut, Malaysia|Lumut]] and [[Belawan]]. According to Barros, they fought against this ship for two days. The enemy crew employed tactics of setting their own ship on fire as a means of burning Albuquerque's ships as they employed ramming techniques and close-range volleys of artillery. Although the ship surrendered, the Portuguese gained such an admiration for the junk and its crew that they nicknamed it ''O Bravo'' (The Brave Junk). The Portuguese crew pleaded with Fernão Pires to convince Albuquerque that the crew should be spared and viewed vassals of Portugal who were simply unaware of who they were actually fighting. Albuquerque eventually agreed to this.&lt;ref&gt;Dion, Mark. ''"Sumatra through Portuguese Eyes: Excerpts from [[João de Barros]]' 'Decadas da Asia',"''. ''Indonesia'' (Volume 9, 1970): 128&amp;#x2013;162.&lt;/ref&gt;

Passing by [[Samudera Pasai Sultanate|Pacem]] (Samudera Pasai) the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] came across a ''Djong''—a junk larger and faster than their flagship, the [[Flor de la Mar|Flor do Mar]]. At the time, the Portuguese currently had one squadron of 40-43 vessels. The Portuguese ordered it to halt but it promptly opened fire on the fleet, after which the Portuguese quickly followed suit. Reported by Gaspar Correia:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lendas da Índia vol. 2|last=Correia|first=Gaspar|publisher=|year=1602|isbn=|location=|page=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|text="Because the junco started the attack, the Governor approached him with his entire fleet. The Portuguese ships began firing on the junco, but it had no effect at all. Then the junco sailed away .... The Portuguese ships then fired on the junco masts .... and the sails are falling. Because it's so tall, our people dare not board it, and our shots did not spoil it one bit because the junco has four layers of board. Our largest cannon was only able to penetrate no more than two layers ... Seeing that, the Governor ordered his nau (carrack) to move to the side of junco. This ship is [[Flor de la Mar]], the highest Portuguese ship. And while trying to climb the junco, the rear of the ship could barely reach its bridge. The junco's crew defended themselves so well that the Portuguese ships were forced to sail away from the ship again. (After two days and two nights of fighting) the Governor decides to break the two rudders at the side of the vessel. Only then did the junco surrender."|sign=Albuquerque|source=}}
Once aboard, the Portuguese found a member of the royal family of [[Samudera Pasai Sultanate|Pacem]], whom [[Afonso de Albuquerque|Albuquerque]] hoped he could exchange for the Portuguese prisoners.
[[File:Djong Pati Unus.jpg|thumb|300x300px|Illustration of Pati Unus' junk compared to an English [[galleon]]]]
In January 1513 [[Demak Sultanate#Pati Unus|Paty Onuz]] (also known as Fatih Yunus or Pati Unus) tried to surprise [[Malacca City|Malacca]] with 100 vessels with 5,000 Javanese from [[Jepara]] and [[Palembang]]. About 30 of those were junks weighing about 350-600 tons (except for Pati Unus' flagship), the rest being smaller boats of [[Penjajap|pangajava]], [[Lancaran (ship)|lancaran]], and kelulus types. These vessels carried much Javanese [[artillery]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Most likely refers to regional [[swivel gun]] like cetbang or rentaka and medium cannon of lela type.&lt;/ref&gt; Although defeated, Pati Unus sailed home and beached his warship as a monument of a fight against men he called the bravest in the world, his exploit winning him a few years later the throne of [[Demak Sultanate|Demak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of Malay|last=Winstedt|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to Afonso de Albuquerque, from Cannanore, 22 Feb. 1513, Fernão Pires de Andrade, the Captain of the fleet that routed Pate Unus, says:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Suma Oriental|last=Pires|first=Tome|publisher=The Hakluyt Society|year=|isbn=9784000085052|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|text="The junk of Pati Unus is the largest seen by men of these parts so far. It carried a thousand fighting men on board, and your Lordship can believe me . . . that it was an amazing thing to see, because the Anunciada near it did not look like a ship at all. We attacked it with bombards, but even the shots of the largest did not pierce it below the water-line, and (the shots of) the esfera (Portuguese large cannon) I had in my ship went in but did not pass through; it had three sheathings, all of which were over a cruzado thick. And it certainly was so monstrous that no man had ever seen the like. It took three years to build, as your Lordship may have heard tell in Malacca concerning this Pati Unus, who made this armada to become king of Malacca."|sign=Fernao Peres de Andrade|source=Suma Oriental}}

The Portuguese remarked that such large, unwieldy ships were weaknesses. The Portuguese succeeded in repelling the attack using smaller but more maneuverable ships. They did not specify the exact size of Pati Unus' junk, only noted that it must have been 4-5 times the size of Flor do Mar (a [[Carrack|nau]]). This would make its size about 144-180 m, with the tonnage between 1600-2000 tons.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other scholars put it as low as 1000 tons, which indicates a length of 70-90 m.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Giovanni da Empoli (a [[Florence|Florentine]] merchant) said that in the land of Java, a junk is no different in its strength than a castle, because it had three and four boards, one above the other, which cannot be harmed with artillery. They sail with their women, children, and family, and everyone has a room to themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lettera di Giovanni da Empoli|last=da Empoli|first=Giovanni|publisher=Istituto Italiano per il Medio ed Estremo Oriente|year=2010|isbn=|location=California|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tome Pires in 1515 wrote that the authorities of [[Guangzhou|Canton]] (Guangzhou) made a law that obliged foreign ships to anchor at an island off-shore. He said that the Chinese made this law about banning ships from Canton for fear of the Javanese and Malays, for it was believed that one of their junks would rout 20 Chinese junks. China had more than a thousand junks, but one ship of 400 tons could depopulate Canton, and this depopulation would bring great loss to China. The Chinese feared that the city would be taken from them, because Canton was one of China's wealthiest city.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Vessels of Banten.png|thumb|Banten jong with 2 mast and bowsprit sail, from 1646 Dutch engraving]]
In 1574, queen [[Ratu Kalinyamat|Kalinyamat]] of Jepara attacked the [[Portuguese Malacca]] with 300 vessels, which included 80 jong of 400 tons burthen and 220 kelulus. The attacking force retreated after 30 jongs were set on fire by the Portuguese and their supplies dwindled. It is also to be noted that by this time European ships has increased in size to 400-500 tons galleon.&lt;ref&gt;Sumatra, 431. William Marsden, Cambridge University Press (2012).

==Decline==
Production of ''djongs'' ended in the 1700s, perhaps because of the decision of [[Amangkurat I of Mataram|Amangkurat I]] of [[Mataram Sultanate]] to destroy ships on coastal cities and close ports to prevent them from rebelling. The disappearance of Muria strait denied the shipbuilders around Rembang-Demak access to open water. By 1677, the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) reported that the Javanese no longer owned large ships and shipyards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jung Jawa|last=Kurniawan|first=Rendra F.|publisher=Babel Publishing|year=2009|isbn=978-979-25-3953-0|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the VOC gained a foothold in Java, they prohibited the locals from building vessels more than 50 tons in tonnage and assigned European supervisors to shipyards.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14634">'''FIPS state codes''' were numeric and two-letter alphabetic [[codes]] defined in U.S. [[Federal Information Processing Standard]] Publication ("FIPS PUB") 5-2 to identify U.S. states and certain other associated areas. The standard superseded FIPS PUB 5-1 on May 28, 1987, and was superseded on September 2, 2008, by [[ANSI]] standard INCITS 38:2009.&lt;ref name=fips52/&gt;

The codes are used in [[Geographic Names Information System]], overseen by the [[U.S. Board on Geographic Names]]. The codes were assigned by [[NIST]] and each uniquely identified a state, the District of Columbia, or an outlying area of the [[United States|U.S.]].  These codes were used by the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]], the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]] to form milk-processing plant numbers, some [[cash register]]s during check approval, and in the [[Emergency Alert System]] (EAS).

The [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] assigned additional numeric codes used with the EAS for [[territorial waters]] of the U.S., but these were not part of the FIPS standard.

The FIPS state alpha code for each U.S. states and the District of Columbia are identical to the [[U.S. postal abbreviations|postal abbreviations]] by the [[United States Postal Service]]. From September 3, 1987, the same was true of the alpha code for each of the outlying areas, with the exception of U.S. Minor Outlying Islands (UM) as the USPS routes mail for these islands indirectly.

Each of the various minor outlying islands that fell within alpha code UM had an individual numeric code, but no individual alpha code.

On September 2, 2008, FIPS 5-2 was one of ten standards withdrawn by [[NIST]] as a Federal Information Processing Standard.&lt;ref name=fr&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] |url=https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2008/09/02/E8-20138/announcing-approval-of-the-withdrawal-of-ten-federal-information-processing-standards-fips |title=Announcing Approval of the Withdrawal of Ten Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) |journal=[[Federal Register]] |volume=73 |page=51276 |date=September 2, 2008 }} {{FedReg|73|51276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== FIPS state codes ==

The following table enumerates the FIPS state alpha and numeric codes for the states, the District of Columbia, the outlying areas of the United States, the freely associated states, and trust territory, and FIPS state numeric codes for the individual minor outlying island territories.

Only actual U.S. states and the District of Columbia had FIPS state numeric codes in the range 01 through 56.

FIPS PUB 5-1 (published on June 15, 1970, and superseded by FIPS PUB 5-2 on May 28, 1987) stated that certain numeric codes "are reserved for possible future use in identifying American Samoa (03), Canal Zone (07), Guam (14), Puerto Rico (43), and Virgin Islands (52)", but these codes were omitted from FIPS PUB 5-2 without comment. These areas are marked with a &lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;  and highlighted in red in the table below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=States and Outlying Areas of the United States (FIPS PUB 5-1)

'''Horticulture''' has been defined as the culture of plants for food, comfort and beauty.&lt;ref&gt;Arteca, R. 2015, Introduction to Horticultural Science, 2nd ed., Gengage Learning, Stamford, USA, p. 584. {{ISBN|978-1-111-31279-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more precise definition can be given as "The cultivation, processing, and sale of fruits, nuts, vegetables, ornamental plants, and flowers as well as many additional services".&lt;ref&gt;Shyr, C.L. &amp; Reily, H.E. 2017. Introductory Horticulture, 9th ed. Gengage Learning, Stamford, USA, p. 5. {{ISBN|978-12854-2472-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also includes [[conservation biology|plant conservation]], [[restoration ecology|landscape restoration]], [[soil management]], landscape and [[garden design]], construction, and maintenance, and [[arboriculture]]. In contrast to [[agriculture]], horticulture does not include [[Intensive crop farming|large-scale crop production]] or [[animal husbandry]].

Horticulturists apply their knowledge, skills, and technologies used to grow intensively produced plants for human food and non-food uses and for personal or social needs. Their work involves [[plant propagation]] and cultivation with the aim of improving plant growth, yields, quality, nutritional value, and resistance to insects, diseases, and environmental stresses. They work as gardeners, growers, therapists, designers, and technical advisors in the food and non-food sectors of horticulture. Horticulture even refers to the growing of plants in a field or garden.

==Etymology==
The word ''horticulture'' is modeled after ''[[agriculture]]'', and comes from the Latin ''hortus'' "garden"&lt;ref&gt;{{L&amp;S|hortus|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''cultūra'' "cultivation", from ''cultus'', the perfect passive [[participle]] of the verb ''colō'' "I cultivate".&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|horticulture}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hortus'' is [[cognate]] with the native English word ''yard'' (in the meaning of land associated with a building) and also the borrowed word ''garden''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/yard Entry for ''yard''] Dictionary.com (presenting information supposedly from Random House Dictionary)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==

The major areas of Horticulture include:

* [[Arboriculture]] is the study of, and the selection, plant, care, and removal of, individual trees, shrubs, vines, and other perennial woody plants.
* [[Turf management]] includes all aspects of the production and maintenance of turf grass for sports, leisure use or amenity use.
* [[Floriculture]] includes the production and marketing of floral crops.Study of flower cultivation.
* [[Landscape architecture|Landscape horticulture]] includes the production, marketing and maintenance of landscape plants.
* [[Olericulture]] includes the production and marketing of [[vegetable]]s.
* [[Pomology]] includes the production and marketing of [[pome]] fruits.
* [[Viticulture]] includes the production and marketing of [[grapes]].
* [[Oenology]] includes all aspects of [[wine]] and [[winemaking]].

Horticulture has a very long history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/history/default.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910033023/http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/history/default.html |archivedate=September 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The study and science of horticulture dates all the way back to the times of [[Cyrus the Great]] of ancient Persia, and has been going on ever since, with present-day horticulturists such as Freeman S. Howlett and [[Luther Burbank]]. The practice of horticulture can be retraced for many thousands of years. The cultivation of taro and yam in Papua New Guinea dates back to at least 6950–6440 cal BP.&lt;ref&gt;Fullagar, Richard, Judith Field, Tim Denham, and Carol Lentfer (2006) ''Early and mid Holocene tool-use and processing of taro (Colocasia esculenta), yam (Dioscorea sp.) and other plants at Kuk Swamp in the highlands of Papua New Guinea'' Journal of Archaeological Science 33: 595–614&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of horticulture lie in the transition of human communities from nomadic [[hunter-gatherer]]s to sedentary or semi-sedentary horticultural communities, cultivating a variety of crops on a small scale around their dwellings or in specialized plots visited occasionally during migrations from one area to the next (such as the "[[milpa]]" or maize field of [[Mesoamerican]] cultures).&lt;ref&gt;von Hagen, V.W. (1957) The Ancient Sun Kingdoms Of The Americas. Ohio: The World Publishing Company&lt;/ref&gt; In the Pre-Columbian Amazon Rainforest, natives are believed to have used [[Biochar#History|biochar]] to enhance soil productivity by smoldering plant waste.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, Dawit, Johannes Lehmann, Janice Thies, Thorsten Schafer, Biqing Liang, James Kinyangi, Eduardo Neves, James Petersen, Flavio Luizao, and Jan Skjemstad, ''Molecular signature and sources of biochemical recalcitrance of organic carbone in Amazonian Dark Earths'', Geochemica et cosmochemica ACTA 71.9 2285–2286 (2007) ("Amazonian Dark Earths (ADE) are a unique type of soils apparently developed between 500 and 9000 years B.P. through intense anthropogenic activities such as biomass-burning and high-intensity nutrient depositions on pre-Columbian Amerindian settlements that transformed the original soils into Fimic Anthrosols throughout the Brazilian Amazon Basin.") (internal citations omitted)&lt;/ref&gt; European settlers called it [[Terra preta|''Terra Preta de Indio'']].&lt;ref&gt;Glaser, Bruno, Johannes Lehmann, and Wolfgang Zech,'' Ameliorating physical and chemical properties of highly weathered soils in the tropics with charcoal – a review'', Biology and Fertility of Soils 35.4 219-220 (2002) ("These so called Terra Preta do Indio (Terra Preta) characterize the settlements of pre-Columbian Indios. In Terra Preta soils large amounts of black C indicate a high and prolonged input of carbonized organic matter probably due to the production of charcoal in hearths, whereas only low amounts of charcoal are added to soils as a result of forest fires and slash-and-burn techniques.") (internal citations omitted)&lt;/ref&gt; In forest areas such horticulture is often carried out in [[swidden]]s ("[[slash and burn]]" areas).&lt;ref&gt;McGee, J.R. and Kruse, M. (1986) Swidden horticulture among the Lacandon Maya [videorecording (29 mins.)]. University of California, Berkeley: Extension Media Center&lt;/ref&gt; A characteristic of horticultural communities is that useful trees are often to be found planted around communities or specially retained from the natural ecosystem.

Horticulture primarily differs from agriculture in two ways. First, it generally encompasses a smaller scale of cultivation, using small plots of mixed crops rather than large fields of single crops. Secondly, horticultural cultivations generally include a wide variety of crops, even including fruit trees with ground crops. Agricultural cultivations however as a rule focus on one primary crop. In pre-contact North America the semi-sedentary horticultural communities of the Eastern Woodlands (growing maize, squash and sunflower) contrasted markedly with the mobile [[hunter-gatherer]] communities of the [[Plains Indians|Plains people]]. In Central America, [[Maya civilization|Maya]] horticulture involved augmentation of the forest with useful trees such as [[papaya]], [[avocado]], [[Theobroma cacao|cacao]], [[ceiba]] and [[sapodilla]]. In the cornfields, multiple crops were grown such as beans (using cornstalks as supports), squash, pumpkins and chilli peppers, in some cultures tended mainly or exclusively by women.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, S.I. (1977) Women, Horticulture, and Society in Tropical America. American Anthropologist, N.S., 79: 908–10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations==
Since 1804 [[Royal Horticultural Society|The Royal Horticultural Society]], a UK charity, leads on the encouragement and improvement of the science, art and practice of horticulture in all its branches&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rhs.org.uk/science|title=The Royal Horticultural Society, UK charity focussed on the art, science and practice of horticulture.|last=|first=|date=|website=The Royal Horticultural Society Website|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and shares this knowledge through its community and learning programmes, world class gardens and shows. The oldest Horticultural society in the world, founded in 1768, is the Ancient Society of York Florists. They still have four shows a year in York, UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ancientsocietyofyorkflorists.co.uk/|title=Ancient society of York Florists,oldest horticultural society in world,longest running horticultural show in world established 1768.|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The professional body representing horticulturists in Great Britain and Ireland is the Institute of Horticulture (IOH).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.horticulture.org.uk/ IOH]&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, the IOH has an international branch for members outside of these islands.

The International Society for Horticultural Science&lt;ref&gt;[http://ishs.org/about ISHS] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922225337/http://ishs.org/about |date=September 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; promotes and encourages research and education in all branches of horticultural science.

The American Society of Horticultural Science&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ashs.org/|title=ASHS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  promotes and encourages research and education in all branches of horticultural science in the Americas.

The Australian Society of Horticultural Science was established in 1990 as a professional society for the promotion and enhancement of Australian horticultural science and [[horticultural industry|industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aushs.org.au/|title=Australian Society of Horticultural Science – Australian Society of Horticultural Science|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Junior Horticultural Association (NJHA) was established in 1934 and was the first organisation in the world dedicated solely to youth and horticulture. NJHA programs are designed to help young people obtain a basic understanding of, and develop skills in, the ever-expanding art and science of horticulture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.njha.org/|title=Home – NJHA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Zealand Horticulture Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rnzih.org.nz/|title=RNZIH – Royal New Zealand Institute of Horticulture – Home Page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Global Horticulture Initiative (GlobalHort) fosters more efficient and effective partnerships and collective action among different stakeholders in horticulture. The organisation has a special focus on horticulture for development (H4D), i.e. using horticulture to reduce poverty and improve nutrition worldwide. To be efficient, GlobalHort is organised in a consortium of national and international organisations to collaborate in research, training, and technology-generating activities designed to meet mutually-agreed-upon objectives. GlobalHort is a not-for-profit organisation registered in Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalhort.org/|title=The Global Horticulture Initiative|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
The purpose of the Archive is to document the history of [[women in architecture|women's involvement in architecture]] by acquiring, preserving, storing, and making available to researchers the professional papers of women architects, landscape architects, designers, architectural historians and critics, urban planners, and the records of women's architectural organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zellner|first=Paola|year=2016|title=El Archivo Internacional de Mujeres en Arquitectura celebra 30 años: una nueva visión|url=|journal=Bitácora Arquitectura|publisher=UNAM|volume=33|pages=16–23|issn=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collections ==
The IAWA collects the papers of women who practiced at a time when there were few women in the field (i.e., before the 1950s) and to fill serious gaps in the availability of primary research materials for architectural, women's, and social history research. As of October 2006 there were over {{convert|1200|cuft|m3}} of materials in the 298 collections in the IAWA, which are housed in Virginia Tech's University Libraries' Special Collections.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As part of its mission to act as a clearinghouse of information about all women architects, past and present, the IAWA also collects and catalogs books, monographs and other publications written by or about women architects, designers, planners, etc. These publications are accessible through the Virginia Tech library's online catalog, Addison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://addison.vt.edu/|title=Addison: Search|website=addison.vt.edu|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IAWA began with a collecting focus on the papers of pioneering women in architecture, individuals who practiced at a time when there were few women in the field. Today, the IAWA includes materials that document multiple generations of women in architecture, providing vital primary source materials for architectural, women's, and social history research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://placesjournal.org/article/unforgetting-women-architects-from-the-pritzker-to-wikipedia/|title=Unforgetting Women Architects: From the Pritzker to Wikipedia|last=Stratigakos|first=Despina|date=April 2016|website=Places|publisher=|access-date=December 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collections includes material of relevant women architects as [[Jane Hastings|L. Jane Hastings]], [[Anna Keichline]], [[Yasmeen Lari]], [[Doina Marilena Ciocănea]], [[Eleanore Pettersen]], [[Sigrid Lorenzen Rupp]], [[Beverly Willis]], [[Diana Balmori]], [[Han Schröder]], [[Mary Colter]], [[Zelma Wilson]], [[Liane Zimbler]], Trudy Rosen, Pamela Webb, [[Berta Rahm]], and [[Olive Chadeayne]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The IAWA also compiles biographical information. There is information about more than 650 women representing 48 countries and 42 states/territories in the United States available in the IAWA Biographical Database.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://iawadb.lib.vt.edu/|title=IAWA Biographical Database|last=|first=|date=|website=International Archive of Women in Architecture|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the IAWA's resources, approximately 1200 images from 28 collections, have been scanned and are available through the VT ImageBase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://imagebase.lib.vt.edu/browse.php?folio_ID=/iawa|title=Browsing International Archive of Women in Architecture - IAWA|last=|first=|date=|website=Imagebase. Virginia Tech|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Board ==
The IAWA is overseen by a board of advisors&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://spec.lib.vt.edu/IAWA/BOA.html|title=IAWA (International Archive of Women in Architecture) Board of Advisors, Virginia Tech|last=|first=|date=|website=International Archive of Women in Architecture|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; that includes architects, city planners, industrial and interior designers, librarians, archivists, and faculty from around the world and the U.S. The head of Special Collections or her designee serves as the Archivist for the IAWA and sits on the Board of Advisors and the Executive Board. She prepares a report for presentation to the annual meeting held in the fall of each year at Virginia Tech's Newman Library in the President's Board Room.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Milka Bliznakov Research Prize ==
The Milka Bliznakov Research Prize was established in 2001 to honor IAWA founder and advisor emerita, Dr. [[Milka Bliznakov]] (1927-2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sokolina|first=Anna|year=|title=In Memoriam: Milka Bliznakov, 1927-2010|url=|journal=Slavic Review|volume=70-2 (Summer 2011)|pages=498–499.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IAWA Center invites architects, scholars, professionals, students, and researchers to contribute research on women in architecture and related design fields. This research, in concert with the preservation efforts of the IAWA, will help fill the current void in historical knowledge about the achievements and work of women who shaped the built environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://spec.lib.vt.edu/IAWA/Bliznakov/Bliznakov.html|title=Milka Bliznakov Research Prize|last=|first=|date=|website=International Archive of Women in Architecture|publisher=|access-date=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
''Jagir'' ({{lang-fa|{{nq|جاگیر}}}}, [[Devanagari]]: जागीर, {{lang-bn|জায়গীর}}) is a Persian word, and means "holding land".&lt;ref name=britjagir/&gt;

The [[Supreme Court of India]] used the following definition of ''jagir'' from ''Rajasthan Land Reforms and Resumption of Jagirs Act (Rajasthan Act VI of 1952)'' in its ''Thakur Amar Singhji vs State Of Rajasthan (And Other ...)'' in a 15 April 1955 judgement: &lt;br /&gt;
''The word 'jagir' connoted originally grants made by [[Rajput]] Rulers to their clansmen for military services rendered or to be rendered. Later on grants made for religious and charitable purposes and even to non-Rajputs were called jagirs, and both in its popular sense and legislative practice, the word jagir came to be used as connoting all grants which conferred on the grantees rights in  respect of land revenue, and that is the sense in  which the word jagir should be construed in Article 31-A.''{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

== Succession ==
A jagir was technically a feudal [[life estate]], as the grant reverted to the state upon the jagirdar's death. However, in practice, jagirs became hereditary to the male lineal heir of the jagirdar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John F. Richards|title=The Mughal Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HHyVh29gy4QC&amp;pg=PA292|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-56603-2|pages=292–293}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sind. Commissioner's Office|title=History of Alienations in the Province of Sind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fl8SAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA143|year=1886|publisher=Karachi: Commissioner's Press|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family was thus the ''de facto'' ruler of the territory, earned income from part of the tax revenues and delivered the rest to the treasury of the state during the Islamic rule period, and later in parts of India that came under Afghan, Sikh and Dogra rulers. The ''jagirdar'' did not act alone, but appointed administrative layers for revenue collection. These positions, according to Shakti Kak, were called ''[[patwari]]'', ''tahsildar'', ''amil'', ''fotedar'', ''[[munsif]]'', ''qanungo'', ''[[Chowdhury|chaudhri]]'', ''[[dewan]]'' and others.&lt;ref name="ErnstPati2007p71"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shakti Kak|editor1=Waltraud Ernst|editor2=Biswamoy Pati|title=India's Princely States: People, Princes and Colonialism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9eKbW3ukh9oC&amp;pg=PA71 |year=2007| publisher=Routledge| isbn=978-1-134-11988-2|pages=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 13th-century origin and successors ==
This [[feudal]] system of land ownership is referred to as the ''jagirdar'' system. The system was introduced by the [[Sultans]] of [[Delhi]] from the 13th century onwards, was later adopted by the [[Mughal Empire]], and continued under the [[British East India Company]].&lt;ref name=britjagir/&gt;
 
Some Hindu jagirdars were converted into Muslim vassal states under [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] imperial sway, such as the [[nawwab]]s of [[Kurnool]]. Most [[List of princely states of India|princely states of India]] during the colonial [[British Raj]] era were jagirdars such as [[Mohrampur Jagir]]. Shortly following independence from the [[British Crown]] in 1947, the ''jagirdar'' system was abolished by the [[Indian government]] in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | page=834 | author=Staff | title=Merriam-Webster's collegiate encyclopedia | publisher=Merriam-Webster | year=2000 | isbn=0-87779-017-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Singh, Kumar Suresh |author2=Lal, Rajendra Behari | page=1350 | title=Gujarat, Part 3 | volume=22 | series=People of India, Kumar Suresh Singh Gujarat, Anthropological Survey of India | publisher=Popular Prakashan | year=2003 | isbn=81-7991-106-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of jagirs ==
The jagir grants were of several kinds and were known by different names, including ''jagir'', an area of neighboring towns or villages with an administrative ''paigah'', ''agrahar'', ''umli'', ''mukasa'', ''inam'', and ''[[maktha]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indiankanoon.org/doc/105792/ Indian Kanoon document 10572]&lt;/ref&gt;
==Jagir in Nepal==
The appointment letter of [[Mathabarsingh Thapa]] issued late on Ashwin Badi 7, 1901 (i.e. September 1844) consists grant of jagir to the appointed [[Mukhtiyar]] (Prime Minister) and [[Chief of the Nepalese Army|Commander-In-Chief of the Nepalese Army]]. The English translation by Historian [[Mahesh Chandra Regmi]] is as follows: {{Quote|From King [[Rajendra Bikram Shah|Rajendra]], To [[Mathabar Singh Thapa|Mathbar Singh Thapa]] ''Bahadur'', son of [[Nain Singh Thapa]], grandson of [[Amar Singh Thapa (born 1759)|Ambar Singh Thapa]], resident of Gorkha. We hereby appoint you as [[Mukhtiyar]] of all civil and administrative affairs throughout our country, as well as [[Prime Minister of Nepal|Prime Minister]], [[Commander-In-Chief of the Nepalese Army|Commander-In-Chief]] and General with '''Jagir''' emoluments amounting to Rs 12,401. Remain in attendance during war and other occasions as commanded by us, be faithful to our salt and utilize the following lands and revenues as your Jagir with due loyalty. (Particulars of lands and revenues follow).{{sfn|Regmi|1971|p=24}}}}

This is a '''list of [[bailiff (Channel Islands)|bailiff]]s of [[Jersey]]'''.
The position of Bailiff was created shortly after the [[Treaty of Paris (1259)|Treaty of Paris 1259]] in which the King of England, [[Henry III of England|Henry III]], gave up claim to all of the Duchy of Normandy but the Channel Islands. In 1290, separate bailiffs for [[Guernsey]] and Jersey were appointed.

The list of bailiffs is only reliably traceable from Philippe L’Evesque’s appointment in 1277, although earlier bailiffs are mentioned and the office may date from before 1204.

==Inclusion of France==
While most countries on the list are those with a history of instability or tension with the US, the inclusion of [[France]] in 2009 did attract some media attention in Japan when a French citizen was blocked from visiting a "Friendship Day" at [[Naval Housing Annex Negishi|Negishi Heights]] in [[Yokohama]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2010/09/07/issues/u-s-navy-friendship-festival-draws-line-at-the-french/ U.S. Navy ‘Friendship Festival’ draws line at the French September 7, 2010] ''[[Japan Times]]'' Retrieved April 29, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2011 France had been removed from the list.&lt;ref name=list2011/&gt;

==Differences between 2009 and 2011 lists==
In the 2009 list [[Albania]], [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Bolivia]], [[Colombia]], [[Croatia]], [[France]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Mali]], [[Morocco]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Oman]], [[Peru]], [[Serbia and Montenegro]], [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Vietnam]] were included.&lt;ref name=list2009/&gt; In the 2011 list they were removed.&lt;ref name=list2011/&gt;

In the 2011 list [[Rwanda]] and [[South Africa]] were added.&lt;ref name=list2011/&gt;

&lt;!-- The two hatnotes above are intended primarily for those following old links to this article. Numerous other Wikipedia articles link here as a reference for the so-called "Disney Animated Classics", i.e., the official list of Walt Disney Animation Studios (WDAS) productions (57 films thru 2018, ''Snow White'' thru ''Ralph Breaks the Internet''), which is now in another article linked in the first hatnote. (That list also has the nine "associated productions", or primarily live-action films with WDAS animation such as ''Song of the South'', ''Mary Poppins'' and ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit'', often confused with the official WDAS canon of fully- or mostly-animated films.) The introduction to the first hatnote restates this article's current purpose for those following the older links expecting the "Disney animation canon".

The second hatnote is for the other two Disney-owned feature animation studios (Pixar &amp; DisneyToon), whose lists were formerly duplicated in this article before it was simplified to its current form. (Marvel Animation is omitted as it does not produce theatrical features and was not included in prior versions of this article.)

The older version also had a separate list of Disney-released Studio Ghibli films, but due to its independence and more recent developments (i.e., some newer Ghibli releases in the U.S. are thru GKIDS instead of Disney) Ghibli is best dealt with in the current opening text.
--&gt;

This '''list of theatrical animated feature films''' consists of animated films produced or released by [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|The Walt Disney Studios]], the film division of [[The Walt Disney Company]].

[[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|The Walt Disney Studios]] releases films from [[Animation studios owned by The Walt Disney Company|Disney-owned]] and non-Disney owned animation studios. Most films listed below are from [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] which began as the feature animation department of Walt Disney Productions, producing its first feature-length animated film ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' in 1937 and as of 2018 has produced a total of [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|57 feature films]].&lt;ref group="st" name="WDAS"&gt;Animated films listed as produced by '''Walt Disney''' were either entirely produced prior to 1986 as part of the animation department of [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Productions]] or by the restructured studio unit '''Walt Disney Feature Animation''', known after 2006 as '''[[Walt Disney Animation Studios]]'''. Some films may have been animated at various [[Animation studios owned by The Walt Disney Company|satellite animation studios]] as well. {{cite web | url=http://www.disneyanimation.com/studio/history | title=Walt Disney Animated Films - History | publisher=Walt Disney Animation Studios | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130121160130/http://www.disneyanimation.com/studio/history | archivedate=2013-01-21 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with ''[[Toy Story]]'' in 1995, The Walt Disney Studios also [[List of Pixar films|released animated films]] by [[Pixar Animation Studios]], which became a wholly owned subsidiary in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/01/24/news/companies/disney_pixar_deal/ | date=January 24, 2006 |publisher=CNN | title=Disney buys Pixar | first=Paul R. | last=La Monica}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=The Walt Disney Studios |url=http://www.waltdisneystudios.com/corp/unit/76 |title=Walt Disney Studios Animation |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929161735/http://waltdisneystudios.com/corp/unit/76 |archive-date=2013-09-29 |access-date=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studio units have also released films theatrically, namely Walt Disney Television Animation's Disney MovieToons/Video Premiere unit (now [[DisneyToon Studios]]) and the studio's distribution unit, which acquires film rights from outside animation studios to release films under the [[Walt Disney Pictures]], [[Touchstone Pictures]], or previously owned [[Miramax#Disney era|Miramax]] film labels.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} In 1996, The Walt Disney Studios signed a deal with [[Tokuma Shoten]] for distribution rights to the theatrical works of [[Studio Ghibli]] worldwide (excluding Asia except for Japan and Taiwan and excluding ''[[Grave of the Fireflies]]'' which was not published by Tokuma), including what then was the most recent film, ''[[Princess Mononoke]]''. The deal later grew to include DVD rights and newer Ghibli movies; the English language Disney release of ''[[Spirited Away]]'' won the [[75th Academy Awards|2002]] [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]]. Studio Ghibli remains wholly independent of Disney and maintains strict creative control over the handling of the foreign language localization Disney produces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/disney/ The Disney-Tokuma Deal //]. Nausicaa.net. Retrieved on 2013-08-12.&lt;/ref&gt; All of the theatrical Ghibli back catalog originally included in the deal have since been released to DVD in North America and several other countries. Other studios globally have released films through [[Walt Disney Pictures]] which maintains distribution rights in certain territories.

==Films==
&lt;!-- First of all, please do not change "Walt Disney Animated Studios" to "Walt Disney Animated Features Canon" in the header of this.

Second, please do not move these films from one portion of this list to another. In particular, do not add other films to the Walt Disney Animation Studio (WDAS) films portion of the list UNLESS Disney has announced a new WDAS production. What is and what isn't in the official canon is already fixed; the official canon is posted by WDAS at http://www.disneyanimation.com/studio/history.

The following are not part of the official WDAS canon:

*Pixar films, whether made before or after Disney acquired Pixar. (Pixar remains a separate production unit within Disney. There have been no WDAS/Pixar co-productions as of 2014; if there is one, its inclusion in the list will have to be determined then.)
*Marvel films, whether made before or after Disney acquired Marvel. (WDAS has not made any Marvel films as of May 2013) However it appears that WDAS will produce Big Hero 6, a fully animated Marvel film.)
*''Piglet's Big Movie'' and ''The Tigger Movie'', produced by Disneytoon studios
*All sequels (except ''The Rescuers Down Under'', ''Fantasia 2000'', and ''Winnie the Pooh'', which were produced by WDAS and included in the canon) were produced by DisneyToon Studios. All except for the three WDAS-produced sequels, ''Return to Neverland'' and ''The Jungle Book 2'' were released direct-to-video. DisneyToon productions are listed in a separate section below.
*Live-action Disney films that include animated bits or sequences (even if produced by WDAS), such as ''Song of the South'', ''Mary Poppins'', ''Bedknobs and Broomsticks'', ''Pete's Dragon'', ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit'', and ''Enchanted''. Those are listed below in another section. An exception is ''Dinosaur'', which is a film with a live-action setting and animated characters, but is officially included in the canon.
*Films distributed by Disney but not produced by Disney, such as ''The Wild''. Those are listed below in other sections.

Third, please do *not* use the spine numbers of UK Disney releases in the WDAS section. Those numbers omit ''Dinosaur'' (made by a special unit of Walt Disney Feature Animation called "The Secret Lab" which folded shortly thereafter; included by official WDAS sources in the U.S.) and ''Winnie the Pooh'', but include ''The Wild'' (*not* produced by WDAS, or even by Disney; merely Disney-distributed). Thus, UK spine numbers 39-46 &amp; 51- will *not* match this list. This list conforms to the official WDAS canon in the U.S. (where WDAS is based), *NOT* the UK.

Finally, please do not add films to the bottom of this list without a reliable source. Reliable sources can be searched by doing a Google News search on Disney. One important note is that the source MUST reveal that it is animated. No official info to date reveals Tux is animated. One special note is that although some sources say that ''King of the Elves'' will be released in 2013, those sources are old, predating when it was revealed that a Pixar film about dinosaurs was confirmed to have a fall 2013 release.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="54827">This is a '''list of lingua francas'''. A [[lingua franca]] (English plural "lingua francas", although the pseudo-Latin form "linguae francae" is also seen) is a language systematically used to make communication possible between people not sharing a [[first language]], in particular when it is a third language, distinct from both speakers' first languages. 

Examples of lingua francas are numerous, and exist on every continent. The most obvious modern example is [[English language|English]], which is the current dominant lingua franca of international diplomacy, business, science, technology and aviation, but many other languages serve, or have served at different historical periods, as lingua francas in particular regions, or in special contexts.
{{horizontal TOC}}

==Africa==
===Afrikaans===
During [[apartheid]], the South African government aimed to establish [[Afrikaans]] as the primary lingua franca in South Africa and South African-controlled [[South-West Africa]] (now Namibia), although English was also in common use. Since the end of apartheid, English has been widely adopted as the sole lingua franca. Many institutions that had names in English and Afrikaans have since dropped the Afrikaans names. Notable cases are [[South African Airways]] and the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]]. 

In [[Namibia]], Afrikaans holds a more universal role than in South Africa, across ethnic groups and races and is the spoken lingua franca in the capital [[Windhoek]] and throughout most of central and southern Namibia. There are pockets where [[German language in Namibia|German]] is commonly spoken. English is the sole official language.

===Amharic===
[[Amharic language|Amharic]] is widely spoken in [[Ethiopia]]. It is an official national language, and thereby serves as a lingua franca for the many different local populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Factbook - Ethiopia|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2098.html#et|publisher=CIA|accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arabic===
There are more [[Arabic]] speakers in Africa than Asia. It is spoken as an official language in all of the continent's [[Arab League]] states. Arabic is also spoken as a trade language across the Sahara as far as the Sahel, including parts of Mali, Chad and [[Borno State]] in Nigeria.

===Berber===
During the rise of Berber dynasties like the [[Almoravids]] and [[Almohads]] between 1040 and 1500, [[Berber languages|Berber]] served as both the vernacular and lingua franca of Northwest Africa. Today the language is less influential due to its suppression and marginalization, and the adoption of French and Arabic by the political regimes of the Berber world as working languages. However, [[Tuareg languages|Tuareg]], a branch of the [[Berber languages]], is still playing the role of a lingua franca to some extent in some vast parts of the [[Sahara Desert]], especially in southern [[Algeria]], [[Mali]], [[Niger]], and [[Libya]]. Another branch, [[Standard Moroccan Tamazight|Tamazight]], has become an official language of [[Morocco]]. In Algeria, Tamazight has been a national language since 2002, and an official State Language in 2016.

===Fanagalo===
[[Fanagalo]] or Fanakalo is a [[pidgin]] based on the [[Zulu language|Zulu]], English, and [[Afrikaans]] languages. It was used as a lingua franca mainly in the mining industries in [[South Africa]], however in this role it is being increasingly eclipsed by English which is viewed as being more neutral politically.&lt;ref&gt;[http://salanguages.com/fanagalo/ FANAGALO] – © J. Olivier (2009) – SA Languages.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fula===
[[Fula language|Fula]] ({{lang-ff|Fulfulde}} ''or'' Pulaar ''or'' Pular'', depending on the region''; {{lang-fr|Peul}}) the language of the [[Fula people]] or Fulani ({{lang-ff|Fulɓe}}; {{lang-fr|Peuls}}) and associated groups such as the [[Toucouleur people|Toucouleur]]. Fula is spoken in all countries directly south of the Sahara (such as [[Cameroon]], [[Chad]], [[Nigeria]], [[Niger]], [[Mali]]...). It is spoken mainly by Fula people, but is also used as a lingua franca by several populations of various origin, throughout Western Africa.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

===Hausa===
[[Hausa language|Hausa]] is widely spoken through Nigeria and Niger and recognised in neighbouring states such as [[Ghana]], [[Benin]], and [[Cameroon]]. The reason for this is that Hausa people used to be traders who led caravans with goods (cotton, leather, slaves, food crops etc.) through the whole West African region, from the Niger Delta to the Atlantic shores at the very west edge of Africa.  They also reached North African states through Trans-Saharan routes. Thus trade deals in [[Timbuktu]] in modern Mali, [[Agadez]], [[Ghat, Libya|Ghat]], [[Fes, Morocco|Fez]] in Northern Africa, and other trade centers were often concluded in Hausa. {{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

===Krio===
[[Krio language|Krio]] is the most widely spoken language throughout [[Sierra Leone]] even though its native speakers, the [[Sierra Leone Creole people]] or Krios (a community of about 300,000 descendants of formerly enslaved people from the [[West Indies]], United States and Britain), make up only about 5% of the country's population. The Krio language unites all the different ethnic groups, especially in their trade and interaction with each other. Krio is also spoken in [[The Gambia]].

===Lingala===
[[Lingala language|Lingala]] is used by over 10 million speakers throughout the northwestern part of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and a large part of the [[Republic of the Congo]], as well as to some degree in Angola and the Central African Republic, although it has only about two million native speakers.&lt;ref name="Bokamba2009"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Languages of Urban Africa | publisher=Continuum | author=Bokamba, Eyamba G. | year=2009 | location=London, New York | isbn=978-1-84706-116-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VD0vV48p8XIC&amp;pg=PA50#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | accessdate=21 July 2011 | editor=McLaughlin, Fiona | chapter=The spread of Lingala as a lingua franca in the Congo Basin | pages=50–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its status is comparable to that of Swahili in eastern Africa.

Between 1880 and 1900, the colonial administration, in need of a common language for the region, adopted a simplified form of [[Bangi language|Bobangi]], the language of the [[Ngala (people)|Bangala]] people, which became Lingala.  Spoken Lingala has many loanwords from French, inflected with Lingala affixes.

===Manding===
The largely interintelligible [[Manding languages]] of West Africa serve as lingua francas in various places. For instance [[Bambara language|Bambara]] is the most widely spoken language in [[Mali]], and [[Jula language|Jula]] (almost the same as Bambara) is commonly used in western [[Burkina Faso]] and northern [[Côte d'Ivoire]]. Manding languages have long been used in regional commerce, so much so that the word for trader, ''jula'', was applied to the language currently known by the same name. Other varieties of Manding are used in several other countries, such as [[Guinea]], [[The Gambia]], and [[Senegal]].

===Sango===
The [[Sango language]] is a lingua franca developed for intertribal trading in the [[Central African Republic]].  It is based on the Northern [[Ngbandi language]] spoken by the Sango people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo but with a large vocabulary of French loan words. It has now been institutionalised as an official language of the Central African Republic.

===Swahili===
[[Swahili language|Swahili, known as Kiswahili to its speakers]], is used throughout large parts of East Africa and the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo as a lingua franca, despite being the mother tongue of [[Swahili people|a relatively small ethnic group]] on the East African coast and nearby islands in the [[Indian Ocean]].  At least as early as the late 18th century, Swahili was used along trading and slave routes that extended west across Lake Tanganyika and into the present-day [[Democratic Republic of Congo]].  Swahili rose in prominence throughout the colonial era, and has become the predominant African language of [[Tanzania]] and [[Kenya]].  Some ethnic groups now speak Swahili more often than their mother tongues, and many, especially in urban areas,  choose to raise their children with Swahili as their first language, leading to the possibility that several smaller East African languages will fade away as Swahili transitions from being a regional lingua franca to a regional first language.

It has official status as a national language in DR Congo, Tanzania and Kenya, and symbolic official status (understood but not widely spoken) in Uganda,  Rwanda and Burundi. It is the first language of education in Tanzania and in much of eastern Congo. It is also the auxiliary language to be in the proposed [[East African Federation]].

===Wolof===
[[Wolof language|Wolof]] is a widely spoken lingua franca of Senegal and The Gambia (especially the capital, Banjul).  It is the native language of approximately 5 million [[Wolof people]] in Senegal, and is spoken as a second language by an equal number.

==Asia==

===Akkadian===
In the Middle East, from around 2600BCE to 1500BCE, forms of [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] were the universally recognized language. It was used throughout the Akkadian empire as well as internationally as a diplomatic language — for example between Egypt and Babylon — well after the fall of the Akkadian empire itself and even while Aramaic was more common in Babylon.

===Arabic===
[[File:Learning Arabic calligraphy.jpg|thumb|300px|right|An example of a text written in [[Arabic calligraphy]].]]
[[Arabic]], the native language of the [[Arabs]], who originally came from the [[Arabian Peninsula]], became the lingua franca of the [[Caliphate|Islamic (Arab) Empire]] (from CE 733 – 1492), which at its greatest extent was bordered by China and [[North India|Northern India]], Central Asia, [[Persian Empire|Persia]], [[Asia Minor]], the Middle East, North Africa, Spain and Portugal.

During the [[Islamic Golden Age]] (around CE 1200), Arabic was the language of science and diplomacy. Arabic loanwords are found in many languages, including [[List of Arabic loanwords in English|English]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], [[Somali language|Somali]], [[Arabic influence on the Spanish language|Spanish]], [[List of Portuguese words of Arabic origin|Portuguese]] and [[Swahili language|Swahili]]. In Iberia, this is a legacy of the [[Al-Andalus]] period. Additionally, Arabic was used by people neighbouring the Islamic Empire.

[[Arabic script]] was adopted by many other languages such as [[Urdu]], Persian, [[Swahili language|Swahili]] (changed to Latin in the late 19th century), [[Turkish language|Turkish]] (switched to Latin script in 1928), and [[Somali language|Somali]] (changed to Latin in 1972). Arabic became the lingua franca of these regions not simply because of commerce or diplomacy, but also on religious grounds since Arabic is the language of the [[Qur'an]], Islam's [[holy book]], sacred to Muslims. Arabic remains the [[List of official languages#Official languages of sovereign countries|lingua franca for 23 countries]] (25 with the Palestinian territories and Western Sahara), in the Middle East, North Africa, Horn of Africa, in addition to [[Chad]] and [[Eritrea]]. Despite a few language script conversions from Arabic to Latin as just described, Arabic is the second most widely used alphabetic system in the world after Latin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9008156/Arabic-alphabet |title=Arabic Alphabet |accessdate=2007-11-23 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arabic script is/has been used in languages including [[Arabic Afrikaans|Afrikaans]], [[Azerbaijani language|Azeri]], [[Arebica|Bosnian]], [[Hausa language|Hausa]], [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]], [[Malay Language|Malay]], [[Morisco]], [[Pashto language|Pashto]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], [[Somali language|Somali]], [[Tatar language|Tatar]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]], [[Urdu language|Urdu]], [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]], and [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]].&lt;ref name="United Nations"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/Depts/OHRM/sds/lcp/Arabic/|title=United Nations Arabic Language Programme|accessdate=2008-01-25 |publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[List of languages by number of native speakers#More than 100 million native speakers|Encarta]]'', which classified Chinese as a single language, Arabic is the second largest native language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encarta.msn.com/media_701500404/Languages_Spoken_by_More_Than_10_Million_People.html |title=Languages Spoken by More Than 10 Million People |accessdate=2007-02-18 |publisher=Microsoft  Encarta  2006 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwPyXpQ1?url=http://encarta.msn.com/media_701500404/Languages_Spoken_by_More_Than_10_Million_People.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Used by more than a billion Muslims around the world,&lt;ref name="United Nations" /&gt; it is also one of the six official languages of the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name="un.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Depts/DGACM/faq_languages.htm |title=Department for General Assembly and Conference Management – What are the official languages of the United Nations? |accessdate=2008-01-25 |publisher=United Nations |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012035848/http://www.un.org/Depts/DGACM/faq_languages.htm |archivedate=2007-10-12 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aramaic===
[[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] was the native language of the [[Aramaeans]] and became the lingua franca of the [[Assyrian Empire]] and the western provinces of the [[Persian Empire]], and was adopted by conquered peoples such as the Hebrews.  A dialect of Old Aramaic developed into the literary language [[Syriac language|Syriac]].  The Syriacs, such as the [[Syriac flag|Syriac-Aramaean]],  [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] and [[Chaldean Christians]], continued the use of Aramaic which ultimately evolved into the [[Neo-Aramaic]] dialects of the Middle East.

===Azeri===
[[Azerbaijani language|Azeri]] served as a lingua franca in [[Transcaucasia]] (except the [[Black Sea]] coast), [[Republic of Dagestan|Southern Daghestan]], [[Eastern Anatolia]],&lt;ref&gt;Pieter Muysken, "Introduction: Conceptual and methodological issues in areal linguistics", in Pieter Muysken, ''From Linguistic Areas to Areal Linguistics'', 2008 {{ISBN|90-272-3100-1}}, p. 30–31 [https://books.google.com/books?id=n9p4rl09ec0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=azeri+lingua+franca&amp;ei=8voWSYynLJWszASRneW3Ag#PPA30,M1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Viacheslav A.

Concise encyclopedia of languages of the world. — Elsevier, 2009. — С. 110-113. — {{ISBN|978-0-08-087774-7}}. An Azerbaijanian koine´ functioned for centuries as a lingua franca, serving trade and intergroup communication all over Persia, in the Caucasus region and in southeastern Dagestan. Its transregional validity continued at least until the 18th century.&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Iranian Azerbaijan]] from the 16th century to the early 20th century. Its role has now been taken over by Russian in the North Caucasus, and by the official languages of the various independent states of the South Caucasus.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gxXtKAAACAAJ&amp;dq=Nasledie+Chingiskhana Nasledie Chingiskhana] by [[Nikolai Trubetzkoy]].

===Bengali===
[[Bengali language]] acts as a lingua franca for the people living in [[Bangladesh]] and in [[West Bengal]].

===Chinese===
[[File:LetterFromKhubilaiToJapan1266.jpg|thumb|A letter dated 1266 from [[Kublai Khan]] of the [[Mongol Empire]] to the "[[Emperor of Japan|King of Japan]]" (日本國王)&lt;!--The text within the image reads 日本國王, "The King of Japan". The Emperor of Japan was always referred to as King of Japan in Chinese texts, and prior to the Meiji Period, no Chinese dynasty ever recognised the Emperor status of the Japanese Emperor. Do not change the text within this caption.--&gt; was written in [[Classical Chinese]]. Now stored in [[Todai-ji]], [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], Japan.]]

Until the early 20th century, [[Classical Chinese]] served as both the written lingua franca and the diplomatic language in [[Far East Asia]] including China, [[Mongolia]], [[Korea]], Japan, Taiwan, the [[Ryūkyū Kingdom]], and [[Vietnam]]. In the early 20th century, [[vernacular written Chinese]] replaced Classical Chinese within China as both the written and spoken lingua franca for speakers of different Chinese dialects, and because of the falling power and cultural influence of China in East Asia, English has since replaced Classical Chinese as the lingua franca in East Asia.

===Hebrew===
Throughout the centuries of Jewish exile, [[Hebrew]] has served the Jewish people as a lingua franca; allowing Jews from  different areas of the world to communicate effectively with one another. This was particularly valuable for cross-culture mercantile trading that became one of the default occupations held by Jews in exilic times. Without the need for translators, documents could easily be written up to convey significant legal trade information. Among early Zionists, a newly reconstructed form of Hebrew served as a common language between Jews from nations as diverse as Poland and Yemen. In modern Israel, Hebrew is the commonly accepted language of administration and trade, even among [[Israeli-Arabs]] whose mother-tongue remains [[Arabic]].

===Hindustani===
[[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], or [[Hindi]]–[[Urdu]], is commonly spoken in India and Pakistan. It encompasses two [[standard language|standardized]] [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]]s in the form of the official languages of Hindi and Urdu, as well as several [[nonstandard dialect]]s. Hindi is one of the official languages of India, and Urdu is the national language and lingua franca of Pakistan. Urdu is also an official language in India. However, whilst the words and much of the speaking may sound similar, many literary differences are present, and Urdu is written in [[Nastaliq]] script while Hindi is written in the [[Devanagari]] script.

Hindi has emerged as a lingua franca for the locals of [[Arunachal Pradesh]], a linguistically diverse state in Northeast India.&lt;ref&gt;https://scroll.in/article/675419/how-hindi-became-the-language-of-choice-in-arunachal-pradesh&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that 90 percent of the state's population knows Hindi.&lt;ref&gt;https://indianexpress.com/article/research/how-hindi-language-became-arunachal-pradeshs-lingua-franca-narendra-modi-5079079/&lt;/ref&gt;

Hindi is also a lingua franca in [[Nepal]]. In the [[Terai]] i.e. floodplain districts of Nepal (along the Indian border), Hindi is a dominant language, though the people's mother tongues are typically [[Avadhi]], [[Maithili language|Maithili]], or [[Bhojpuri]]. Additionally, Urdu is quite useful throughout the Middle East countries due to the export of labor from South Asia. It is commonly spoken among labour working populations on land and at sea throughout the Middle East.

===Malay===
[[File:Trilingual Chinese-Malay-English text from 1839.jpg|thumb|[[1839]] - Trilingual Chinese-Malay-English text - [[Malay language|Malay]] was the linga franca across the [[Strait of Malacca]], including the coasts of the [[Malay Peninsula]] of Malaysia and the eastern coast of [[Sumatra]] in Indonesia, and has been established as a native language of part of western coastal [[Sarawak]] and [[West Kalimantan]] in [[Borneo]].]]
In the 15th century, during the [[Malacca Sultanate]], [[Malay language|Malay]] was used as a lingua franca in [[Maritime Southeast Asia]], by locals, and traders and artisans that stopped at [[Malacca]] via the [[Straits of Malacca]]. Malay was also presumably used as a [[Malay trade and creole languages|language of trade]] among the [[Tumao|elites]] and artisans around the [[Islands of the Philippines|islands]] of modern-day [[Philippines]]. [[Netherlands|Dutch]] scholar, [[Francois Valentijn]] (1666–1727) described the use of Malay in the region as being equivalent to the contemporary use of [[Latin]] and [[French language|French]] in [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ms}} [http://appw05.dbp.gov.my/dokumen/buku_pelan_strategik.pdf Wawasan: Bahasa Melayu Salah Satu Bahasa Utama Dunia, ''Buku Pelan Tindakan Strategik DBP 2011–2015 (Memartabatkan Bahasa dan Persuratan Melayu)''. page 10. Terbitan Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka (DBP).] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151009110929/http://appw05.dbp.gov.my/dokumen/buku_pelan_strategik.pdf |date=2015-10-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malay is currently used primarily in [[Malaysia]] (officially called [[Bahasa Malaysia|Bahasa Melayu]]) and [[Brunei]], and to a lesser extent in [[Singapore]] and parts of [[Sumatra]]. One of Singapore's four official languages, the Malay language or 'Bahasa Melayu' was the lingua franca for Malays in Singapore prior to the introduction of English as a working and instructional language, and remains so for the elder generation.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

[[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], a language based on traditional Malay and with which it is [[mutually intelligible]], but also influenced by various languages such as Dutch, Sanskrit, Javanese, Arabic, and Portuguese, serves as a lingua franca throughout [[Indonesia]] and [[East Timor]] (where it is considered a working language), areas that are home to over 700 [[Languages of Indonesia|indigenous languages]].

===Nepali===
[[Nepali language|Nepali]] is the lingua franca of the many ethnic, religious and cultural communities of [[Nepal]], and is also spoken in [[Bhutan]], parts of India and parts of [[Myanmar]] (Burma). It is one of 23 [[official languages of India]] incorporated in 8th annex of the [[Indian Constitution]]. It has official language status in the formerly independent state of [[Sikkim]] and in [[West Bengal]]'s [[Darjeeling district]]. Similarly, it is spoken by the Nepalese living in the state of [[Assam]] and other [[Northeast India]]n states. While Nepali is closely related to the [[Hindi]]–[[Urdu]] complex and is mutually intelligible to a degree, it has more [[Sanskrit]]ic derivations and fewer Persian or English loan words. Nepali is commonly written in the [[Devanagari]] script, as are Hindi, Sanskrit and Marathi.

===Persian===
[[Persian language|Persian]] became the second lingua franca of the Islamic world, in particular of the eastern regions.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Seyyed Hossein Nasr, ''Islam: Religion, History, and Civilization'', HarperCollins,Published 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Besides serving as the state and administrative language in many Islamic dynasties, some of which included [[Samanids]], [[Ghurids]], [[Ghaznavids]], [[Ilkhanid]]s, [[Seljuqids]], [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] and early [[Ottomans]], Persian cultural and political forms, and often the Persian language, were used by the cultural elites from the [[Balkans]] to [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Famighetti, ''The World Almanac and Book of Facts'', World Almanac Books, 1998, p. 582&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Persian was the only oriental language known and used by [[Marco Polo]] at the Court of [[Kublai Khan]] and in his journeys through China.&lt;ref&gt;John Andrew Boyle, ''SOME THOUGHTS ON THE SOURCES FOR THE IL-KHANID PERIOD OF PERSIAN HISTORY'', in Iran: Journal of the British Institute of Persian Studies, British Institute of Persian Studies, vol. 12 (1974), p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arnold Joseph Toynbee]]'s assessment of the role of the Persian language is worth quoting in more detail:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the Iranic world, before it began to succumb to the process of Westernization, the New Persian language, which had been fashioned into literary form in mighty works of art ... gained a currency as a lingua franca; and at its widest, about the turn of the 16th and 17th centuries of the Christian Era, its range in this role extended, without a break, across the face of South-Eastern Europe and South-Western Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold J. Toynbee, A Study of History,V, pp. 514–15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Persian remains the lingua franca in [[Iran]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Tajikistan]].

===Sanskrit===
[[Sanskrit]] historically served as a lingua franca throughout the majority of India.&lt;ref&gt;The Last Lingua Franca: English Until the Return of Babel. Nicholas Ostler. Ch.7. {{ISBN|978-0802717719}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/culture/3952-cultural-crossroads-how-sanskrit-became-mughal-lingua-franca&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Dictionary of Buddhism p.350 {{ISBN|0191579173}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Before the European Challenge: The Great Civilizations of Asia and the Middle East p.180 {{ISBN|0791401685}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Tagalog===
Tagalog was declared the official language by the first [[Constitution of the Philippines|constitution]] in the Philippines, the [[wikisource:Provisional Constitution of the Philippines (1897)#ARTICLE VIII: OFFICIAL LANGUAGE|Constitution of Biak-na-Bato]] in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.filipiniana.net/ArtifactView.do?artifactID=L00000000001&amp;page=1&amp;epage=1 |title=1897 Constitution of Biak-na-Bato, Article VIII |publisher=Filipiniana.net |accessdate=2008-01-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228152829/http://www.filipiniana.net/ArtifactView.do?artifactID=L00000000001&amp;page=1&amp;epage=1 |archivedate=2009-02-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Native Tagalog speakers continue to make up one of the country's largest linguistic and cultural groups, numbering an estimated 14 million. The [[Filipino language]], which is  standardised register of Tagalog, is taught in schools throughout the [[Philippines]] and is an official language of education and business along with [[Philippine English|English]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alsintl.com/resources/languages/Tagalog/&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the large number of [[Languages of the Philippines]], the designation of Tagalog (as 'Filipino') as 'national' in character is often disputed, as [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] and [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]] are among several tongues that have comparatively large numbers of speakers, and are themselves used as lingua francas. See also [[Imperial Manila]].

===Tamil===
[[Tamil language|Tamil]] is an official language in [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Singapore]]. It is also the official language of the Indian states and territories of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Puducherry]] and [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]]. Tamil is also recognized as minority language in countries like [[Malaysia]], [[Mauritius]] and [[South Africa]]. Tamil historically must be served as a lingua franca throughout the majority of [[India]] and Sri Lanka.

{{Main article|English as a lingua franca}}
{{See also|International English}}
English is the current lingua franca of international business, education, science, technology, diplomacy, entertainment, radio, seafaring, and aviation.  After World War II, it has gradually replaced French as the lingua franca of international diplomacy.&lt;ref name="otte2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Otte|first1=T.G.|title=H-Diplo Review of Sir Ivor Roberts, ed. ''Satow's Guide to Diplomatic Practice'', 6th edition|journal=H-Diplo|date=1 September 2010|page=5|url=http://h-diplo.org/essays/PDF/Otte-Roberts.pdf|quote=One of the striking external changes in diplomatic practice over the past three decades is the extent to which English has now become indisputably the lingua franca of international diplomacy. A comparison of Satow V and VI quickly establishes the fact. It is remarkable how many passages in the Gore-Booth edition of 1979 are still in French. This has been swept away by the tides of recent history ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of English in diplomacy began in 1919, when the [[Treaty of Versailles]] was written in English as well as in French, the dominant language used in diplomacy until that time. The widespread use of English was further advanced by the prominent international role played by English-speaking nations (the United States and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]) in the aftermath of World War II, particularly in the establishment and organization of the [[United Nations]]. English is one of the six [[official languages of the United Nations]] (the other five being French, Arabic, Chinese, Russian and Spanish). The seating and roll-call order in sessions of the United Nations and its subsidiary and affiliated organizations is determined by alphabetical order of the English names of the countries.

When the United Kingdom became a colonial power, English served as the lingua franca of the colonies of the [[British Empire]]. In the post-colonial period, some of the newly created nations which had multiple [[indigenous language]]s opted to continue using English as an official language to avoid the political difficulties inherent in promoting any one indigenous language above the others. The British Empire established the use of English in regions around the world such as North America, India, Africa, Australia and New Zealand, so that by the late 19th century its reach was truly global,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ehistling-pub.meotod.de/01_lec06.php |title=Lecture 7: World-Wide English |accessdate=2007-03-26|publisher=&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;HistLing }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the latter half of the 20th century, widespread international use of English was much reinforced by the global economic, financial, scientific, military, and cultural pre-eminence of the English-speaking countries and especially the U.S. Today, more than half of all [[scientific journals]] are published in English, while in France, almost one-third of all [[natural science]] research appears in English,&lt;ref&gt;Reinhold Wagnleitner, "Coca-colonization and the Cold War: the cultural mission of the United States in Austria after the Second World War", p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; lending support to English being the lingua franca of science and technology. English is also the lingua franca of international [[air traffic control]] and seafaring communications.

===French===
French was the language of [[diplomacy]] from the 17th century until the mid-20th century,&lt;ref name="otte2010"/&gt; and is still a working language of some [[List of international organisations which have French as an official language|international institutions]]. In the international sporting world French is still the lingua franca of the [[International Olympic Committee]] and [[FIFA]]. French is still seen on documents ranging from passports to airmail letters. Until the accession of the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Denmark in 1973, French and German were the official working languages of the [[European Economic Community]].

French is spoken by educated people in cosmopolitan cities of the Middle East and North Africa and remains so in the former French colonies of the [[Maghreb]], where French is particularly important in economic capitals such as [[Algiers]], [[Casablanca]] and [[Tunis]]. Until the outbreak of the [[Lebanese Civil War|civil war]] in Lebanon, French was spoken by the upper-class Christian population. French is still a lingua franca in most [[West Africa|Western]] and [[Central Africa]]n countries and an official language of many, a remnant of French and Belgian colonialism. These African countries and others are members of the [[Francophonie]]. French is the official language of the [[Universal Postal Union]], with English added as a working language in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upu.int/en/the-upu/languages.html |title=The UPU: Languages |publisher=Universal Postal Union |accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===German===
German served as a lingua franca in large portions of Europe for centuries, mainly the [[Holy Roman Empire]] outside of the sphere of influence of the [[Hanseatic League]], which used ''[[List of lingua francas#Low German|Low German]]''.

Previously one of the official languages of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], German remained an important second language in much of [[Central and Eastern Europe]] long after the dissolution of that empire after World War I. Today, although to a much diminished degree after [[World War II]], it is still the most common second language in some of the countries in the region like [[Slovenia]] (45% of the population), [[Croatia]] (34%),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_243_en.pdf|title=Europeans and their languages – European commission special barometer FEB2006|accessdate=2010-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Czech Republic]] (31%) and [[Slovakia]] (28%). In others, it is also known by significant numbers of the population (in Poland by 18%, in Hungary by 16%).

[[World War II]] and [[Expulsion of Germans|its following resettlements during 1945-1950]] had a disastrous effect on the use of the German language in Central and Eastern Europe, where it was often suppressed and eventually dropped as a lingua franca by the mid-to-late 20th century.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, German was a prerequisite language for scientists. Despite the anti-German sentiment after World War I and World War II, it remains a widespread language among scientists.

===Greek and Latin===
[[File:Ephesians 2,12 - Greek atheos.jpg|thumb|[[Koine Greek]]]]
During the time of the [[Hellenistic civilization]] and [[Roman Empire]], the lingua francas were [[Koine Greek]] and [[Latin]]. During the [[Middle Ages]], the lingua franca was Greek in the parts of Europe, Middle East and Northern Africa where the [[Byzantine Empire]] held hegemony, and Latin was primarily used in the rest of Europe.  Latin, for a significant portion of the expansion of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], was the universal language of prayer and worship.  During the [[Second Vatican Council]], Catholic liturgy changed to local languages, although Latin remains the official language of the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. Latin was used as the language of scholars in Europe until the early 19th century in most subjects. For instance, [[Christopher Simpson]]'s "[[Chelys]] or The [[Division viol]]" on how to improvise on the [[viol]] (viola da gamba) was published in 1665 in a multilingual edition in Latin and English, to make the material accessible for the wider European music community. Another example is the Danish-Norwegian writer [[Ludvig Holberg]], who published his book "[[Niels Klim's Underground Travels|Nicolai Klimii iter subterraneum]]" in 1741 about an ideal society "Potu" ("[[utopia|Utop]]" backwards) with equality between the genders and an egalitarian structure, in Latin in Germany to avoid Danish censorship and to reach a greater audience. [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s [[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]] was published in Latin in 1687: the first English translation did not appear until 1729. In subjects like medicine and theology Latin has been a subject of study until the present day in most European universities, despite declining use in recent years.

===Italian===
The [[Mediterranean Lingua Franca]] was largely based on Italian and [[Provençal dialect|Provençal]].  This language was spoken from the 11th to 19th centuries around the Mediterranean basin, particularly in the European commercial empires of Italian cities ([[Genoa]], [[Venice]], [[Florence]], [[Milan]], [[Pisa]], [[Siena]]) and in trading ports located throughout the eastern Mediterranean rim.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Romanos Kahane. ''The Lingua Franca in the Levant'' (Turkish Nautical Terms of Italian and Greek Origin)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Renaissance]], standard Italian was spoken as a language of culture in the main royal courts of Europe, and among intellectuals. This lasted from the 14th century to the end of the 16th, when French replaced Italian as the usual lingua franca in northern Europe.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} On the other hand, Italian [[musical terms]], in particular dynamic and tempo notations, have continued in use to the present day, especially for [[classical music]], in music revues and program notes as well as in printed scores. Italian is considered the language of [[Opera]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15040264&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Catholic ecclesiastic hierarchy, Italian is known by a large part of members and is used in substitution of Latin in most official documents as well. The presence of Italian as the official language in [[Vatican City]] indicates its use not only in the seat in Rome, but also anywhere in the world where an episcopal seat is present.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Italian served as the official lingua franca in [[Italian North Africa]] (present-day [[Libya]], consisting of the colonies of [[Cyrenaica]], [[Tripolitania]] and [[Fazzan]]) and in [[Italian East Africa]] (consisting of the present-day countries of the [[Horn of Africa]]: [[Eritrea]], [[Ethiopia]] and [[Somalia]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uwm.edu/~corre/franca/edition3/lingua5.html Lingua Franca (in Italian)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Low German===
From about 1200 to 1600, [[Middle Low German]] was the language of the [[Hanseatic League]] which was present in most [[Northern Europe]]an seaports, even London.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} It resulted in numerous Low German words being borrowed into Danish, Norwegian and Swedish. After the Middle Ages, modern High German and Dutch began to displace Low German, and it has now been reduced to many regional dialects, although they are still largely mutually intelligible. In recent years, the language has seen a resurgence in public interest, and it is increasingly being used as a mode of communication between speakers of (northern) German and (eastern) Dutch nationality.

===Polish===
Polish was a lingua franca in areas of [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]], especially regions that belonged to the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. Polish was for several centuries the main language spoken by the ruling classes in [[Lithuania]] and [[Ukraine]], and the modern state of [[Belarus]].&lt;ref name="Barbour"&gt;{{cite book

===Portuguese===
Portuguese served as lingua franca in the Portuguese Empire, Africa, South America and Asia in the 15th and 16th centuries. When the Portuguese started exploring the seas of Africa, America, Asia and Oceania, they tried to communicate with the natives by mixing a Portuguese-influenced version of lingua franca with the local languages. When English or French ships came to compete with the Portuguese, the crews tried to learn this "broken Portuguese". Through a process of change the lingua franca and Portuguese lexicon was replaced with the languages of the people in contact.

Portuguese remains an important lingua franca in Africa ([[Portuguese-speaking African countries|PALOP]]), [[East Timor]], [[Goa]], and to a certain extent in [[Macau]] where it is recognized as an official language alongside Chinese though in practice not commonly spoken.

===Russian===
Russian is in use and widely understood in Northern and Central Asia, areas formerly part of the Soviet Union or [[Soviet bloc|bloc]], and may be understood by older people in Central and Eastern Europe, formerly part of the [[Warsaw Pact]]. It remains the lingua franca in the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (the former Soviet Union minus the more Western [[Baltic states]], where English and German are preferred). Russian is also one of the [[Official languages of the United Nations|six official languages of the United Nations.]]&lt;ref name="un.org"/&gt;

===Serbo-Croatian===
[[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] is a lingua franca in several of the territories of the [[former Yugoslavia]], that is, modern [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Croatia]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Serbia]]. In those four countries it is the main native language, and is also spoken by ethnic minorities. For example, a [[Hungarians in Serbia|Hungarian]] from [[Vojvodina]] and an [[Istrian Italians|Italian]] from [[Istria]] might use it as a shared second language. Most people in [[Slovenia]] and [[Macedonia (country)|Macedonia]] can understand or speak Serbo-Croatian as well. It is a pluricentric language and is commonly referred to as Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian or Montenegrin depending on the background of the speaker.

===Spanish===

With the growth of the [[Spanish Empire]], Spanish became established in the Americas, as well as in parts of Africa, Asia and Oceania. It became the language of global trade until [[Napoleonic Wars]]{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} and the breakup of the Spanish Empire at the beginning of the 19th century. Spanish was used as a lingua franca throughout the former Spanish Colonial Empire, including territory in present-day U.S., but particularly in present-day [[Mexico]], [[Spanish Caribbean]], [[Central America|Central]], [[South America]] and [[Captaincy General of the Philippines|the Philippines]], and still remains the lingua franca within [[Hispanic America]].

At present it is the second most used language in international trade, and the third most used in politics, diplomacy and culture after English and French.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quadernsdigitals.net/index.php?accionMenu=secciones.VisualizaArticuloSeccionIU.visualiza&amp;proyecto_id=361&amp;articuloSeccion_id=4463 "¿Por qué los brasileños deben aprender español?"] – Copyright 2003 Quaderns Digitals Todos los derechos reservados ISSN 1575-9393.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkish===

[[Turkish language|Turkish]] is still in use and widely spoken in several areas formerly part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and may be understood by older people in other parts of the [[Middle East]].
.

===Yiddish===
[[Yiddish]] originated in the [[Ashkenazi]] culture that developed from about the 10th century in the [[Rhineland]] and then spread to [[Central Europe|central]] and [[eastern Europe]] and eventually to other continents. For a significant portion of its history, Yiddish was the primary spoken language of the [[Ashkenazi Jews]]. [[Yiddish dialects|Eastern Yiddish]], three dialects of which are still spoken today, includes a significant but varying percentage of words from [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and other local languages.

On the eve of World War II, there were 11 to 13 million Yiddish speakers, for many of whom Yiddish was not the primary language. [[The Holocaust]], however, led to a dramatic, sudden decline in the use of Yiddish, as the extensive Jewish communities, both secular and religious, that used Yiddish in their day-to-day life were largely destroyed. Although millions of Yiddish speakers survived the war, further assimilation in countries such as the United States and the Soviet Union, along with the strictly [[Hebrew]] monolingual stance of the [[Zionist]] movement, led to a decline in the use of Yiddish. However, the number of speakers within the widely dispersed [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] (mainly [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]]) communities is now increasing. It is a home language in most [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] communities, where it is the first language learned in childhood, used in schools, and in many social settings.

In the United States, as well as South America, the Yiddish language bonded Jews from many countries. Most of the Jewish immigrants to the New York metropolitan area during the years of [[Ellis Island]] considered Yiddish their native language. Later, Yiddish was no longer the primary language for the majority of the remaining speakers and often served as lingua franca for the Jewish immigrants who did not know each other's primary language, particularly following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Yiddish was also the language in which second generation immigrants often continued to communicate with their relatives who remained in Europe or moved to Israel, with English, Spanish or Portuguese being primary language of the first and Russian, Romanian, or Hebrew that of the second.

==Pre-Columbian North America==

===Chinook Jargon===
[[Chinook Jargon]] was originally constructed from a great variety of Amerind words of the Pacific Northwest, arising as an intra-indigenous contact language in a region marked by divisive geography and intense linguistic diversity. The participating peoples came from a number of very distinct language families, speaking dozens of individual languages.

After European contact, the Jargon also acquired English and French loans, as well as words brought by other European, Asian, and Polynesian groups. Some individuals from all these groups soon adopted the Jargon as a highly efficient and accessible form of communication. This use continued in some business sectors well into the 20th century and some of its words continue to feature in company and organization names as well as in the regional [[toponymy]].

In the [[Diocese of Kamloops]], [[British Columbia]], hundreds of speakers also learned to read and write the Jargon using the [[Duployan shorthand]] via the publication ''[[Kamloops Wawa]]''. As a result, the Jargon also had the beginnings of its own literature, mostly translated scripture and classical works, and some local and episcopal news, community gossip and events, and diaries. Novelist and early Native American activist, Marah Ellis Ryan (1860?–1934) used Chinook words and phrases in her writing.

According to Nard Jones, Chinook Jargon was still in use in Seattle until roughly the eve of World War II, especially among the members of the Arctic Club, making Seattle the last city where the language was widely used. Writing in 1972, he remarked that at that later date "Only a few can speak it fully, men of ninety or a hundred years old, like [[Henry Broderick (Seattle)|Henry Broderick]], the realtor, and [[Joshua Green (seaman and banker)|Joshua Green]], the banker."

Jones estimates that in pioneer times there were about 100,000 speakers of Chinook Jargon.

===Nahuatl===
[[Classical Nahuatl language|Classical Nahuatl]] was the lingua franca of the [[Aztec Empire]] in Mesoamerica prior to the Spanish invasion in the 16th century.  An extensive corpus of the language as spoken exists.  Like Latin and Hebrew (prior to the founding of modern Israel), Classical Nahuatl was more of a [[sociolect]] spoken among the elites (poets, priests, traders, teachers, bureaucrats) than a language spoken in any common family household.

After the Spanish conquest, Nahuatl remained the lingua franca of [[New Spain]]. Spanish friars matched the language to a [[Latin alphabet]], and schools were established to teach Nahuatl to Spanish priests, diplomats, judges, and political leaders. In 1570, Nahuatl was made the official language of New Spain, and it became the lingua franca throughout Spanish North America, used in trade and the courts. During the prolonged [[Spanish conquest of Guatemala]] Spain's native allies, mostly from [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcala]] and [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]], spread Nahuatl to [[Maya civilization|Maya]] areas where it was not spoken prior to the arrival of the Spanish, resulting in Nahuatl placenames across Guatemala which persist up to the present.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p764"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 764.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1696, the official use of any language other than Spanish was banned throughout the empire. Especially since Mexican independence, the use of Nahuatl has dwindled.

===Occaneechi===
Prior to European colonization, the Occaneechi dialect of the [[Tutelo language|Tutelo]] language served as a lingua franca in the land that would become the state of Virginia. Tutelo was a Siouan language. But Robert Beverley, Jr. observed that the Tuscarora, who spoke an Iroquoian language, and the Powhatan, who spoke an Algonquian language, both used Occaneechi in religious ceremonies, much like modern Christian communities use Latin.&lt;ref&gt;http://docsouth.unc.edu/southlit/beverley/beverley.html&lt;/ref&gt; Beverley also noted that the Occaneechi language was used by all native nations of Virginia as a trade language.

After European colonists introduced devastating infectious diseases, all native languages of Virginia began to decline. All dialects of Tutelo, including Occaneechi, became extinct by the end of the 20th century. However, there is considerable documentation of the language by numerous linguists, and interest among modern Tutelo people in reviving the language.&lt;ref&gt;http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2005/06/08/tutelo-language-revitalized-96387&lt;/ref&gt;

==South America==
Portuguese and Spanish started to grow as lingua francas in the region in since the conquests of the 16th century. In the Case of Spanish this process was not even and as the Spanish used the structure of Inca Empire to consolidate their rule Quechua remained the lingua franca of large parts of what is now Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia. Quechua importance as a language for trade and dealing with Spanish-approved indigenous authorities ([[curaca]]) made the language expand even after the Spanish conquest. It was not until the [[rebellion of Túpac Amaru II]] that the Spanish authorities changed to a policy of Hispanization that was continued by the republican states of Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia. Quechua also lost influence to Spanish as the commerce circuits grew to integrate other parts of the Spanish Empire where Quechua was unknown, for example in the [[Rio de la Plata]].

===Quechua===
Also known as [[Runa Simi]], as the [[Inca empire]] rose to prominence in South America, this imperial language became the most widely spoken language in the western regions of the continent. Even among tribes that were not absorbed by the empire Quechua still became an important language for trade because of the empire's influence. Even after the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|Spanish conquest]] of the Andes, Quechua for a long time was the most common language, and was promoted by the Spanish colonial authorities in the first centuries of colonization. Today it is still widely spoken although it has given way to Spanish as the more common lingua franca. It is spoken by some 10 million people through much of South America (mostly in Peru, south-western and central Bolivia, southern Colombia and Ecuador, north-western Argentina and northern Chile).

===Mapudungun===
[[Mapudungun]] was for a long time used as a lingua franca in large portions of Chile and Argentine [[Patagonia]]. Adoption of Spanish was in Chile a slow process and by the 19th century the unconquered Indians of [[Araucanía (historic region)|Araucanía]] had spread their language across the Andes during a process called [[Araucanization]]. Pehuenches were among the first non-Mapuche tribes to adopt the language. The increasing commerce over the Andes and the migration of Mapuches into the Patagonian plains contributed to the adoption of Mapudungun by other tribes of a more simple material culture. Even in [[Chiloé Archipelago]] Spaniards and mestizos adopted a dialect of Mapudungun as their main language.

===Tupi===
The [[Old Tupi language]] served as the lingua franca of Brazil among speakers of the various indigenous languages, mainly in the coastal regions. Tupi as a lingua franca, and as recorded in colonial books, was in fact a creation of the Portuguese, who assembled it from the similarities between the coastal indigenous [[Tupi–Guarani languages]]. The language served the Jesuit priests as a way to teach natives, and it was widely spoken by Europeans. It was the predominant language spoken in Brazil until 1758, when the Jesuits were expelled from Brazil by the Portuguese government and the use and teaching of Tupi was banned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://galileu.globo.com/edic/89/conhecimento2.htm "Abá nhe'enga oîebyr – Tradução: a língua dos índios está de volta", by Suzel Tunes] essay in Portuguese.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Tupi as lingua franca was quickly replaced by Portuguese, although various Tupi–Guarani languages are still spoken by small native groups in Brazil.

==Pidgins and creoles==
{{further information|Pidgin|Creole language}}
Various [[pidgin]] languages have been used in many locations and times as a common trade speech. They can be based on English, French, Chinese, or indeed any other language. A pidgin is defined by its use as a lingua franca, between populations speaking other mother tongues. When a pidgin becomes a population's first language, then it is called a [[creole language]].

===Guinea-Bissau Creole===
[[Guinea-Bissau Creole]] is a [[Portuguese Creole]] used as a lingua franca of [[Guinea-Bissau]] and [[Casamance]], [[Senegal]] among people of different ethnic groups. It is also the mother tongue of many people in Guinea-Bissau.

===Tok Pisin===
[[Tok Pisin]] is widely spoken in [[Papua New Guinea]] as a lingua franca. It developed as an Australian English-based creole with influences from local languages and to a smaller extent German or [[Unserdeutsch language|Unserdeutsch]] and Portuguese. Tok Pisin originated as a pidgin in the 19th century, hence the name 'Tok Pisin' from 'Talk Pidgin', but has now evolved into a modern language.

Also called Pidgin English, this lingua franca is also spoken in the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. The versions of Pidgin vary between PNG, the Solomons and Vanuatu, but all Pidgin speakers from these countries are able to communicate and often understand each other's language variations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2696">This is a list of '''[[river]]s''' and '''[[creek (waterway)|creeks]]''' located on the island of '''[[Prince Edward Island]]'''.

Despite the fact that many are called ''rivers'', their freshwater portions are not large enough to warrant this name.  These watercourses are more correctly categorized as '''[[streams]]''', with the majority of their length being [[tidal]] inlets or [[estuaries]] where the small amount of fresh water interchanges with salt water from the Gulf of St. Lawrence or Northumberland Strait.

'''Macedonia''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Macedonia.ogg|ˌ|m|æ|s|ɪ|ˈ|d|oʊ|n|i|ə}}) is a [[geographical]] and [[Historical regions of the Balkan Peninsula|historical region of the Balkan peninsula]] in southeastern Europe. Its boundaries have changed considerably over time; however, it came to be defined as the modern geographical region by the mid 19th century. Nowadays the region is considered to include parts of six [[Balkan]] countries: [[Greece]], the [[Republic of Macedonia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Albania]], [[Serbia]] and [[Republic of Kosovo|Kosovo]].{{ref label|status|a|}} It covers approximately {{convert|67000|km2|mi2|0}} and has a population of 4.76 million.

Its oldest known settlements date back approximately to 7,000 BC. From the middle of the 4th century BC, the [[Kingdom of Macedon]] became the dominant power on the [[Balkan peninsula]]; since then Macedonia has had a diverse history.

{{further information|History of Macedonia (ancient kingdom)}}

===Ancient Times===
[[File:Macedonian Kingdom.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The kingdom of Macedon with its provinces]]

The definition of Macedonia has changed several times throughout history. Prior to its expansion under [[Alexander the Great]], the ancient kingdom of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]], to which the modern region owes its name, lay entirely within the central and western parts of the current Greek province of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] and was consisted of 17 provinces/districts or eparchies ([[Ancient Greek]]: επαρχία).&lt;ref&gt;The Ancient Greeks: New Perspectives, Stephanie Lynn Budin, ABC-CLIO, 2004, {{ISBN|1576078140}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=u-Py1QbavoQC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=borders+of+ancient+macedon&amp;hl=bg&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qYy1UtvIF42ihgf-7IHICQ&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 12.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Expansion of Kingdom of Macedon:

1. Kingdom of [[Perdiccas I]]: Macedonian Kingdom of Emathia consisting of six provinces [[Emathia]], [[Pieria (regional unit)|Pieria]], [[Bottiaea]], [[Mygdonia]], [[Eordaea]] and [[Almopia]].

2. Kingdom of [[Alexander I of Macedon|Alexander I]]: All the above provinces plus the eastern annexations [[Crestonia]], [[Bisaltia]] and the western annexations [[Elimiotis]], [[Orestis (region)|Orestis]] and [[Lynkestis]].

[[File:Borders of Macedonia according authors (1843-1927).png|thumb|upright=1.2|Borders of Macedonia, based on the Roman province, according to different authors (1843–1927)]]

3. Kingdom of [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]]: All the above provinces plus the appendages of [[Pelagonia]] and [[Paeonia (kingdom)|Macedonian Paeonia]] to the north, [[Sintike]], [[Odomantis]] and [[Edonis (region)|Edonis]] to the east and the [[Chalkidike]] to the south.

===Roman Era===
In the 2nd century, Macedonia covered approximately the area where it is considered to be today, but the northern regions of today Republic of Macedonia were not identified as Macedonian lands.&lt;ref&gt;Entangled Histories of the Balkans: Volume One, Roumen Daskalov, Tchavdar Marinov, BRILL, 2013, {{ISBN|900425076X}}, pp. 278-279.&lt;/ref&gt; For reasons that are still unclear, over the next eleven centuries Macedonia's location was changed significantly. The [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Roman province of Macedonia]] consisted of what is today Northern and Central Greece, much of the geographical area of the present-day Republic of Macedonia and southeast Albania. Simply put, the Romans created a much larger administrative area under that name than the original ancient [[Macedon]]. In late Roman times, the provincial boundaries were reorganized to form the [[Diocese of Macedonia]], consisting of most of modern mainland Greece right across the Aegean to include [[Crete]], southern Albania, parts of south-west Bulgaria and southern Republic of Macedonia.

[[File:Greater Macedonia.png|thumb|right|upright=1.2|The modern geographical region of Macedonia shown in blue. The region is [[Macedonia (terminology)#Subregions|divided]] by the national boundaries of [[Greece]] ([[Macedonia (Greece)|Greek Macedonia]]), the [[Republic of Macedonia]], [[Bulgaria]] ([[Blagoevgrad Province]]), [[Albania]] ([[Mala Prespa]] and [[Golloborda|Golo Brdo]]), [[Serbia]] ([[Prohor Pčinjski]]), and [[Kosovo]] ([[Gora (region)|Gora]]).]]

===Byzantine Era===
In the Byzantine Empire, a [[Theme of Macedonia|province under the name of Macedonia]] was carved out of the original [[Theme of Thrace]], which was well east of the Struma River.&lt;ref&gt;''The migrations during the early Byzantine centuries also changed the meaning of the geographical term Macedonia, which seems to have moved to the east together with some of the non-Slavic population of the old Roman province. In the early 9th century an administrative unit (theme) of Makedonikon was established in what is now Thrace (split among Bulgaria, Greece, and Turkey) with Adrianopleas its capital. It was the birthplace of Emperor Basil I (867–886), the founder of the so-called Macedonian dynasty in Byzantinum.'' Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Macedonia, Dimitar Bechev, Scarecrow Press, 2009, {{ISBN|0810862956}}, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ilGfCIF4Ao4C&amp;pg=PR52&amp;dq=in+the+early+9th+century+an+administrative+unit+macedonia+it+was+the+birthplace&amp;hl=bg&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=u5qtUuHdJqTmywPZ0oKQCg&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Iii].&lt;/ref&gt; This ''[[Theme (Byzantine district)|thema]]'' variously included parts of [[Thrace]] and gave its name to the [[Macedonian dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;''By the beginning of the 9th century, the theme of Macedonia, with its capital at Adrianople consisted not of Macedonian but of Thracian territories. During the Byzantine period the Macedonia proper corresponded to the themes of Thessalonica and Strymon. The Ottoman administration ignored the name of Macedonia. It was only revived during the Renaissance, when western scholars rediscovered the ancient Greek geographical terminology.'' Brill's Companion to Ancient Macedon: Studies in the Archaeology and History of Macedon, 650 BC - 300 AD, Robin J. Fox, Robin Lane Fox, BRILL, 2011, {{ISBN|9004206507}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=kjLPBsB2dIkC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=Macedonia+adrianople+capital&amp;hl=bg&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tjCsUtzYGpCAhAfG3oD4DA&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 35].&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, Byzantine documents of this era that mention Macedonia are most probably referring to the Macedonian thema. The region of Macedonia, on the other hand, which was ruled by the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] throughout the 9th and the 10th century, was incorporated into the Byzantine Empire in 1018 as the [[Bulgaria (theme)|Themе of Bulgaria]].&lt;ref&gt;''When the barbarian invasions started in the fourth through seventh centuries AD in the Balkans, the remnants of the Hellenes who lived in Macedonia were pushed to eastern Thrace, the area between Adrianople (presently the Turkish city of Edirne) and Constantinople. This area would be called theme of Macedonia by the Byzantines... whereas the modern territory of R. of Macedonia was included in the theme of Bulgaria after the destruction of Samuels Bulgarian Empire in 1018.'' Contested Ethnic Identity: The Case of Macedonian Immigrants in Toronto, 1900-1996, Chris Kostov, Peter Lang, 2010, {{ISBN|3034301960}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=P-1m1FLtrvsC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;dq=the+area+between+Adrianople+(presently+the+Turkish+city+of+Edirne)+and+macedonia&amp;hl=bg&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xaKtUveCH4P_ywOL_4K4Dw&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 48.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman Era===
With the gradual conquest of southeastern Europe by the [[Ottomans]] in the late 14th century, the name of Macedonia disappeared as an administrative designation for several centuries and was rarely displayed on maps. The name was again revived to mean a distinct geographical region in the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;''The ancient name 'Macedonia' disappeared during the period of Ottoman rule and was only restored in the nineteenth century originally as geographical term.'' The Oxford Handbook of the History of Nationalism, John Breuilly, Oxford University Press, 2013, {{ISBN|0199209197}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-pI25h1bHPIC&amp;pg=PA192&amp;dq=name+of+macedonia+historical+region+ottoman&amp;hl=bg&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gharUvLGFtCrhQeZ_IBA&amp;ved=0CG8Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 192.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jelavich|first1=Barbara|title=History of the Balkans, Vol. 2: Twentieth Century|date=1983|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521274591|page=91|quote=However, in the nineteenth century the term Macedonian was used almost exclusively to refer to the geographic region}}&lt;/ref&gt;  defining the region bounded by [[Mount Olympus]], the [[Pindus]] range, mounts [[Šar Mountains|Shar]] and [[Osogovo]], the western [[Rhodope Mountains|Rhodopes]], the lower course of the river Mesta (Greek [[Nestos (river)|Nestos]]) and the [[Aegean Sea]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Brown|editor1-first=Keith|editor2-last=Ogilvie|editor2-first=Sarah|title=Concise Encyclopedia of Languages of the World|date=2008|publisher=Elsevier Science|isbn=0080877745|page=663}}&lt;/ref&gt; developing roughly the same borders that it has today.&lt;ref&gt;''The region was not called "Macedonia" by the Ottomans, and the name "Macedonia" gained currency together with the ascendance of rival nationalism.''

==Demographics==
{{Main|Demographic history of Macedonia}}
[[File:Distribution of races in the Balkans c.1910.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Distribution of ethnic groups in the Balkan Peninsula and Asia Minor in 1910 (''Historical Atlas'' by William R. Shepherd, New York)]]
[[File:Distribution Of Races 1918 National Geographic.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Distribution of ethnic groups in the Balkan Peninsula and Asia Minor in 1918 (''National Geographic'')]]

During medieval and modern times, Macedonia has been known as a Balkan region inhabited by ethnic Greeks, Albanians, Vlachs, Serbs, Bulgarians, Jews, and Turks.&lt;ref&gt;"Macedonia Redux", Eugene N. Borza, The Eye Expanded: Life and the Arts in Greco-Roman Antiquity&lt;/ref&gt; Today, as a frontier region where several very different cultures meet, Macedonia has an extremely diverse demographic profile.

*[[Macedonians (Greek)|Macedonian Greeks]] self-identify culturally and regionally as "Macedonians" (Greek: Μακεδόνες, ''Makedónes''). They form the majority of the region's population (~51%). They number approximately 2,500,000 and, today, they live almost entirely in [[Macedonia (Greece)|Greek Macedonia]]. The Greek Macedonian population is mixed, with other indigenous groups and with a large influx of Greek refugees descending from [[Asia Minor]], [[Pontians|Pontic Greeks]], and [[Eastern Thrace|East Thracian Greeks]] in the early 20th century. This is due to the [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]], during which over 1.2 million Orthodox Christian refugees from Turkey were settled in Greece, 638,000 of whom were settled in the Greek province of Macedonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greek-language.gr/greekLang/modern_greek/tools/corpora/pi/content.html?c=9&amp;t=3,3997|title=Διδακτικά Βιβλία του Παιδαγωγικού Ινστιτούτου|website=www.greek-language.gr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller Greek minorities exist in Bulgaria and the Republic of Macedonia, although their numbers are difficult to ascertain. In official census results, only 86 persons declared themselves Greeks in Bulgarian Macedonia (Blagoevgrad Province) in 2011, out of a total of 1,379 in all Bulgaria; while only 442 persons described themselves as Greeks in the 2002 census in the Republic of Macedonia.
*[[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Ethnic Macedonians]] self-identify as "Macedonians" (Macedonian: Македонци, ''Makedonci'') in an ethnic sense as well as in the regional sense. They are the second largest ethnic group in the region. Because of their primarily [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] origin they are also known as "Macedonian Slavs" and "Slav Macedonians" (Greek: Σλαβομακεδόνες, "Slavomakedones"). They form the majority of the population in the [[Republic of Macedonia]] where according to the 2002 census, approximately 1,300,000 people declared themselves as Macedonians. According to the latest Bulgarian census held in 2011, there are 561 people declaring themselves ethnic Macedonians in the [[Blagoevgrad Province]] of Bulgaria ([[Pirin Macedonia]]). The official number of [[ethnic Macedonians in Bulgaria]] is 1,654. A relatively small number of ethnic Macedonians exist among the [[Slavic-speakers of Greek Macedonia]]. There has not been a census in Greece on the question of mother tongue since 1951, when the census recorded 41,017 [[Slavic language (Greece)|Slavic-speakers]], mostly in the [[West Macedonia]] periphery of Greece. The linguistic classification of the Slavic dialects spoken by these people can be either [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] or [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]&lt;!--Trudgill--&gt;, although the people themselves call their language "[[Slavic language (Greece)|Slavic]]"&lt;!--Sotiriou--&gt;. Most of these people declare themselves as ethnic Greeks ([[Slavic speaking minority in northern Greece|Slavophone Greeks]]), although there are small groups espousing ethnic Macedonian&lt;ref name="USCountryReport"&gt;"Northwestern Greece is home to an indeterminate number of citizens who speak a Slavic dialect at home, particularly in Florina province. Estimates ranged widely, from under 10,000 to 50,000. A small number identified themselves as belonging to a distinct ethnic group and asserted their right to "Macedonian" minority status" {{cite web|title=2002 U.S. Country Reports on Human Rights Practices – Greece|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2002/18368.htm|date=31 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bulgarian national identities. In the 2011 Albanian census, 5,870 Albanian citizens declared themselves Macedonians.
*[[Macedonian Bulgarians]] are ethnic Bulgarians who self-identify regionally as "Macedonians" (Bulgarian: Mакедонци, ''Makedontsi''). They represent the bulk of the population of [[Bulgarian Macedonia]] (also known as "[[Pirin Macedonia]]"). They number approximately 250,000 in the [[Blagoevgrad Province]] where they are mainly situated. There are small Bulgarian-identifying groups in Albania, Greece and the Republic of Macedonia with an uncertain size. In the Republic of Macedonia, 1,417 people claimed a Bulgarian ethnic identity in the 2002 census. Paradoxically, during the last few years around 53,000 Macedonians have applied for Bulgarian citizenship and more than 70,000 ethnic Macedonians have already obtained Bulgarian passports.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sdk.mk/index.php/makedonija/53-000-makedontsi-chekaat-bugarski-pasosh-vlastite-sakaat-da-go-skratat-rokot-na-6-mesetsi/ 53.000 МАКЕДОНЦИ ЧЕКААТ БУГАРСКИ ПАСОШ, ВЛАСТИТЕ САКААТ ДА ГО СКРАТАТ РОКОТ НА 6 МЕСЕЦИ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bnr.bg/varna/post/100908984/nad-70-000-makedonci-imat-balgarsko-grajdanstvo Над 70 000 македонци имат българско гражданство]&lt;/ref&gt; Bulgaria's admission to the [[European Union]] is evidently a powerful motivation factor. In order to obtain it they must sign a statement proving they are ''Bulgarian by origin'', effectively not recognizing their rights as a minority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vmacedonianews.com/2006/07/macedonias-former-pm-ljubco.html |title=Macedonian News: Macedonia’s Former PM Ljubco Georgievski Received Bulgarian Citizenship (REVIEW) |publisher=Vmacedonianews.com |date=16 July 2006 |accessdate=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/23/world/europe/23bulgaria.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin | work=The New York Times | title=For Dream Jobs in Europe, the Line Forms in Bulgaria | first=Nicholas | last=Wood | date=23 July 2006 | accessdate=5 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Albanians]] are another major ethnic group in the region. Ethnic Albanians make up the majority in certain northern and western parts of the Republic of Macedonia, and account for 25.2% of the total population of the Republic of Macedonia, according to the 2002 census.
*Smaller numbers of [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Bosniaks]], [[Romani people|Roma]], [[Serbs]], [[Vlachs]] ([[Aromanians]] and [[Megleno-Romanians]]), [[Egyptians (Balkans)|Egyptians]], [[Armenians]] and [[Jews]] ([[Sephardi Jews|Sephardim]] and [[Romaniotes]]) can also be found in Macedonia.

===Religion===
Most present-day inhabitants of the region are [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] [[Christians]], principally of the [[Church of Greece|Greek Orthodox]], [[Bulgarian Orthodox]], [[Serbian Orthodox]] and [[Macedonian Orthodox Church|Macedonian Orthodox]] Churches. Notable [[Muslim]] minorities are present among the Albanian, [[Bulgarian Muslims|Bulgarian]] ([[Pomaks]]), [[Macedonian Muslims|Macedonian]] ([[Torbeš]]), [[Bosniak]], and [[Turkish people|Turkish]] populations.

==History==
{{see also|History of Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|History of modern Macedonia (Greece)|History of the Republic of Macedonia}}

===Early Neolithic===
While Macedonia shows signs of human habitation as old as the [[paleolithic]] period (among which is the [[Petralona cave]] with the oldest European humanoid), the earliest known settlements, such as [[Nea Nikomedeia]] in [[Imathia]] (today's Greek Macedonia), date back 9,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;R.J. Rodden and K.A. Wardle, Nea Nikomedia: The Excavation of an Early Neolithic Village in Northern Greece 1961–1964, Vol I, The Excavation and the Ceramic Assemblage, British School at Athens Supplementary Volume 25, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; The houses at Nea Nikomedeia were constructed—as were most structures throughout the Neolithic in northern Greece—of [[wattle and daub]] on a timber frame. The cultural assemblage includes well-made pottery in simple shapes with occasional decoration in white on a red background, clay female figurines of the 'rod-headed' type known from [[Thessaly]] to the [[Danube Valley]], stone axes and adzes, chert blades, and ornaments of stone including curious 'nose plugs' of uncertain function. The assemblage of associated objects differs from one house to the next, suggesting some degree of craft specialisation had already been established from the beginning of the site's history. The farming economy was based on the cultivation of cereal crops such as wheat and barley and [[pulse (legume)|pulses]] and on the herding of sheep and goats, with some cattle and pigs. Hunting played a relatively minor role in the economy. Surviving from 7000 to 5500 BCE, this Early Neolithic settlement was occupied for over a thousand years.

===Middle Neolithic===
The Middle Neolithic period (c. 5500 to 4500 BCE) is at present best represented at [[Servia, Greece|Servia]] in the [[Haliacmon]] Valley in western Macedonia, where the typical red-on-cream pottery in the [[Sesklo]] style emphasises the settlement's southern orientation. Pottery of this date has been found at a number of sites in Central and Eastern Macedonia but so far none has been extensively excavated.

===Late Neolithic===
[[File:Map of Balkans linguistic groups late 3rd millenium BC, according to Georgiev.png|thumbnail|right|upright=1.4|Linguistic zones in Macedonia at ''end'' of 3rd millennium BCE, according to Georgiev, Map 2 "Introduction to Indo-European Languages" &lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Georgiev - The Genesis of the Balkan Peoples, The Slavonic and East European Review, Vol. 44, No. 103 (Jul., 1966), pp. 285-297
ancient Macedonian is closely related to Greek, and Macedonian and Greek are descended from a common Greek-Macedonian idiom that was spoken till about the second half of the 3rd millennium BC.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The Late Neolithic period (c. 4500 to 3500 BCE) is well represented by both excavated and unexcavated sites throughout the region (though it should be noted that in Eastern Macedonia levels of this period are still called Middle Neolithic according to the terminology used in the Balkans). Rapid changes in pottery styles, and the discovery of fragments of pottery showing trade with quite distant regions, indicate that society, economy and technology were all changing rapidly. Among the most important of these changes were the start of copper working, convincingly demonstrated by Renfrew to have been learnt from the cultural groups of Bulgaria and Roumania to the North.&lt;ref&gt;A.C. Renfrew, The autonomy of the south-east European Copper Age, Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society 35 1969: 12–47.&lt;/ref&gt; Principal excavated settlements of this period include Makryialos&lt;ref&gt;Stella G. Souvatzi, A Social Archaeology of Households in Neolithic Greece: An Anthropological Approach Series: Cambridge Studies in Archaeology, 2008, 166–178&lt;/ref&gt; and Paliambela near the western shore of the Thermaic gulf, Thermi to the south of [[Thessaloniki]] and [[Sitagroi]]&lt;ref&gt;Colin Renfrew, Marija Gimbutas and Ernestine S. Elster 1986. Excavations at Sitagroi, a prehistoric village in northeast Greece. Vol. 1. Los Angeles : Institute of Archaeology, University of California, 1986, Monumenta archaeologica 13; E.

Some of these sites were densely occupied and formed large mounds (known to the local inhabitants of the region today as 'toumbas'). Others were much less densely occupied and spread for as much as a kilometer (Makryialos). Both types are found at the same time in the same districts and it is presumed that differences in social organisation are reflected by these differences in settlement organisation. Some communities were clearly concerned to protect themselves with different kinds of defensive arrangements: ditches at Makryialos and concentric walls at Paliambela. The best preserved buildings were discovered at Dikili Tas, where long timber-framed structures had been organised in rows and some had been decorated with bulls' skulls fastened to the outside of the walls and plastered over with clay.

Remarkable evidence for cult activity has been found at [[Promachonas]]-Topolnica, which straddles the Greek Bulgarian border to the north of [[Serres]]. Here a deep pit appeared to have been roofed to make a subterranean room; in it were successive layers of debris including large numbers of figurines, bulls' skulls, and pottery, including several rare and unusual shapes.&lt;ref&gt;Stella G. Souvatzi, A Social Archaeology of Households in Neolithic Greece: An Anthropological Approach
Series: Cambridge Studies in Archaeology, 2008, 217–220&lt;/ref&gt;

The farming economy of this period continued the practices established at the beginning of the Neolithic, although sheep and goats were less dominant among the animals than they had previously been, and the cultivation of vines (''[[Vitis vinifera]]'') is well attested.

Only a few burials have been discovered from the whole of the Neolithic period in northern Greece and no clear pattern can be deduced. Grave offerings, however, seem to have been very limited.

===Ancient Macedonia (500 to 146 BCE)===
{{main|Macedonia (ancient kingdom)}}
[[File:ExpansionOfMacedon.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Expansion of Macedon into a kingdom]]

In classical times, the region of Macedonia comprised parts of what at the time was known as Macedonia, Illyria and Thrace. Among others, in its lands were located the kingdoms of Paeonia, Dardania, Macedonia and Pelagonia, historical tribes like the Agrianes, and colonies of southern Greek city states. Prior to the Macedonian ascendancy, parts of southern Macedonia were populated by the [[Bryges]],&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides. ''The Peloponnesian War'',[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200;query=chapter%3D%23245;layout=;loc=2.98.1 2.99].&lt;/ref&gt; while western, (i.&amp;nbsp;e., [[Upper Macedonia|Upper]]) Macedonia, was inhabited by Macedonian and [[Illyrians|Illyrian tribes]]. Whilst numerous wars are later recorded between the Illyrian and Macedonian Kingdoms, the Bryges might have co-existed peacefully with the Macedonians.&lt;ref&gt;Borza, Eugene N. ''In the Shadow of Olympus: the Emergence of Macedon''. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1990, {{ISBN|0-691-00880-9}}, p. 65. "There is no record of conflict between the Bryges and the local population; they are described as ''synoikoi'' ("fellow inhabitant" or neighbors) of the Macedonians."&lt;/ref&gt; In the time of [[Classical Greece]], [[Paionia]], whose exact boundaries are obscure, originally included the whole [[Vardar|Axius]] River valley and the surrounding areas, in what is now the northern part of the Greek region of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]], most of the [[Republic of Macedonia]], and a small part of western Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9057963/Paeonia|title=Paeonia - historical region|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 500 BCE, the ancient kingdom of [[Macedon]] was centered somewhere between the southern slopes of Lower Olympus and the lowest reach of the Haliakmon River.&lt;ref&gt;N.G.L. Hammond, "Connotations of 'Macedonia' and of 'Macedones' Until 323 B. C.", ''The Classical Quarterly'', New Series, Vol. 45, No. 1, (1995), p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; Since 512/511 BCE, and through the Persian Wars, the kingdom of Macedonia was [[Achaemenid Macedonia|subject]] to the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]], but after the [[Battle of Plataea|battle of Plataia]] it regained its independence.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2011|pp=135-138, 342-345}} Under Philip II and Alexander the Great, the kingdom of Macedonia forcefully expanded, placing the whole of the region of Macedonia under their rule.
Alexander's conquests produced a lasting extension of Hellenistic culture and thought across the ancient [[Near East]], but his empire broke up on his death. His generals divided the empire between them, founding their own states and dynasties. The kingdom of Macedon was taken by [[Cassander]], who ruled it until his death in 297 BC. At the time, Macedonian control over the Thracoillyrian states of the region slowly waned, although the kingdom of Macedonia remained the most potent regional power. This period also saw several Celtic invasions into Macedonia. However, the [[Gallic invasion of the Balkans|Celts]] were each time successfully repelled by Cassander, and later Antigonus, leaving little overall influence on the region.&lt;ref&gt;The Celts.

===Roman Macedonia===
{{Main|Macedonia (Roman province)}}
[[File:Roman provinces of Illyricum, Macedonia, Dacia, Moesia, Pannonia and Thracia.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Early Roman Macedonia (illustrated here encompassing Paeonia &amp; south Illyria) and environs, from Droysens Historical Atlas, 1886]]

[[Macedon]]ian sovereignty in the region was brought to an end at the hands of the rising power of Rome in the 2nd century BC. [[Philip V of Macedon]] took his kingdom to war against the Romans in two wars during his reign (221-179 BC). The [[First Macedonian War]] (215-205 BC) was fairly successful for the Macedonians but Philip was decisively defeated in the [[Second Macedonian War]] in (200-197 BC). Although he survived war with Rome, his successor [[Perseus of Macedon]] (reigned 179-168 BC) did not; having taken Macedon into the [[Third Macedonian War]] in (171-168 BC), he lost his kingdom when he was defeated. Macedonia was initially divided into four republics subject to Rome before finally being annexed in 146 BC as a [[Roman province]]. Around this time, vulgar Latin was introduced in the Balkans by Latin-speaking colonists and military personnel.

With the division of the [[Roman Empire]] into west and east in 298 AD, Macedonia came under the rule of Rome's [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] successors. The population of the entire region was, however, depleted by destructive invasions of various [[Goths|Gothic]] and [[Huns|Hun tribes]] c. 300 – 5th century AD. Despite this, other parts of the Byzantine empire continued to flourish, in particular some coastal cities such as [[Thessaloniki]] became important trade and cultural centres. Despite the empire's power, from the beginning of the 6th century the Byzantine dominions were subject to frequent raids by various [[Early Slavs|Slavic tribes]] which, in the course of centuries, eventually resulted in drastic demographic and cultural changes in the Empire's Balkan provinces. Although traditional scholarship attributes these changes to large-scale colonizations by Slavic-speaking groups, it has been proposed that a generalized dissipation of Roman identity might have commenced in the 3rd century, especially among rural provincials who were crippled by harsh taxation and famines. Given this background, penetrations carried by successive waves of relatively small numbers of Slavic warriors and their families might have been capable of assimilating large numbers of indigenes into their cultural model, which was sometimes seen as a more attractive alternative. In this way and in the course of time, great parts of Macedonia came to be controlled by Slavic-speaking communities. Despite numerous attacks on Thessaloniki, the city held out, and Byzantine-Roman culture continued to flourish, although Slavic cultural influence steadily increased.

The Slavic settlements organized themselves along tribal and territorially based lines which were referred to by Byzantine Greek historians as "Sklaviniai". The Sklaviniai continued to intermittently assault the Byzantine Empire, either independently, or aided by [[Bulgars|Bulgar]] or [[Pannonian Avars|Avar]] contingents. Around 680 AD a "Bulgar" group (which was largely composed of the descendants of former Roman Christians taken captive by the Avars), led by Khan [[Kuber]] (theorized to have belonged to the same [[Dulo clan|clan]] as the Danubian Bulgarian khan [[Asparukh]]), settled in the [[Pelagonia|Pelagonian plain]], and launched campaigns to the region of Thessaloniki. When the Empire could spare imperial troops, it attempted to regain control of its lost Balkan territories. By the time of [[Constans II]] a significant number of the Slavs of Macedonia were captured and transferred to central Asia Minor where they were forced to recognize the authority of the Byzantine emperor and serve in his ranks. In the late 7th century, [[Justinian II]] again organized a massive expedition against the Sklaviniai and Bulgars of Macedonia. Launching from Constantinople, he subdued many Slavic tribes and established the ''Theme of Thrace'' in the hinterland of the Great City, and pushed on into Thessaloniki. However, on his return he was ambushed by the Slavo-Bulgars of Kuber, losing a great part of his army, booty, and subsequently his throne.&lt;ref&gt;The Early Medieval Balkans. John Fine. Page 71: "In 688/89 the emperor Justinian II marched through Thrace where at least enough Byzantine rule had been restored for a theme administration to be established.... The purpose of the campaign was to punish the Bulgars and Slavs. Justinian successfully subdued many Slavs (taking many captives) and reached Thessaloniki. On his return toward Constantinople in 689 he was ambushed by the Bulgars who wiped out most of his army"&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these temporary successes, rule in the region was far from stable since not all of the Sklaviniae were pacified, and those that were often rebelled. The emperors rather resorted to withdrawing their defensive line south along the Aegean coast, until the late 8th century. Although a new theme—that of "Macedonia"—was subsequently created, it did not correspond to today's geographic territory, but one farther east (centred on Adrianople), carved out of the already existing Thracian and Helladic themes.

===Medieval Macedonia===
{{Further|Byzantine Empire|Bulgaria (theme)|Macedonia (theme)|Strymon (theme)|Thessalonica (theme)}}

There are no Byzantine records of "Sklaviniai" after 836/837 as they were absorbed into the expanding [[First Bulgarian Empire]]. Slavic influence in the region strengthened along with the rise of this state, which incorporated parts of the region to its domain in 837. In the early 860s [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]], two [[Byzantine Greek]] brothers from Thessaloniki, created the first Slavic [[Glagolitic alphabet]] in which the [[Old Church Slavonic]] language was first transcribed, and are thus commonly referred to as the apostles of the Slavic world. Their cultural heritage was acquired and developed in medieval Bulgaria, where after 885 the region of [[Ohrid]] (present-day Republic of Macedonia) became a significant ecclesiastical center with the nomination of the Saint [[Clement of Ohrid]] for "first archbishop in Bulgarian language" with residence in this region. In conjunction with another disciple of Saints Cyril and Methodius, [[Saint Naum]], Clement created a flourishing Slavic cultural center around Ohrid, where pupils were taught theology in the [[Old Church Slavonic]] language and the Glagolitic and [[Cyrillic script]] at what is now called [[Ohrid Literary School]]. The Bulgarian-Byzantine boundary in the beginning of 10th century passed approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} north of Thessaloniki according to the inscription of Narash. According to the Byzantine author [[John Kaminiates]], at that time the neighbouring settlements around Thessaloniki were inhabited by "Scythians" (Bulgarians) and the Slavic tribes of [[Drugubites]] and [[Sagudates]], in addition to Greeks.

At the end of the 10th century, what is now the Republic of Macedonia became the political and cultural heartland of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]], after Byzantine emperors [[John I Tzimiskes]] conquered the eastern part of the Bulgarian state during the [[Rus'–Byzantine War (970–971)|Rus'–Byzantine War of 970–971]]. The Bulgarian capital [[Preslav]] and the Bulgarian Tsar Boris II were captured, and with the deposition of the Bulgarian regalia in the [[Hagia Sophia]], Bulgaria was officially annexed to Byzantium. A new capital was established at Ohrid, which also became the seat of the [[Bulgarian Patriarchate]]. A new dynasty, that of the [[Comitopuli]] under Tsar [[Samuil of Bulgaria|Samuil]] and his successors, continued resistance against the Byzantines for several more decades, before also [[Byzantine conquest of Bulgaria|succumbing]] in 1018. The western part of Bulgaria including Macedonia was incorporated into the Byzantine Empire as the province of Bulgaria ([[Theme of Bulgaria]]) and the Bulgarian Patriarchate was reduced in rank to an [[Bulgarian Archbishopric of Ohrid|Archbishopric]].

Intermittent Slavic uprisings continued to occur, often with the support of the Serbian princedoms to the north. Any temporary independence that might have been gained was usually crushed swiftly by the Byzantines. It was also marked by [[Byzantine-Norman Wars|periods of war]] between the [[Normans]] and Byzantium. The Normans launched offensives from their lands acquired in southern Italy, and temporarily gained rule over small areas in the northwestern coast.

From the 12th century, parts of Macedonia were conquered by the Serbian kingdom of [[Raška (state)|Raška]]. In the 13th century, following the [[Fourth Crusade]], Macedonia was disputed among [[Byzantine Greeks]], [[Latin Empire|Latin]] crusaders of the short-lived [[Kingdom of Thessalonica]], and the [[Second Bulgarian Empire|revived Bulgarian state]]. Most of southern Macedonia was secured by the [[Despotate of Epirus]] and then by the [[Empire of Nicaea]], while the north was ruled by Bulgaria. After 1261 however, all of Macedonia returned to Byzantine rule, where it largely remained until the [[Byzantine civil war of 1341–1347]]. Taking advantage of this conflict, the Serb ruler [[Stefan Dushan]] expanded his realm and founded the [[Serbian Empire]], which included all of Macedonia, northern and central Greece – excluding Thessaloniki, Athens and the Peloponnese. Dushan's empire however broke up shortly after his death in 1355. After his death rulers of Macedonia were [[Vukašin Mrnjavčević]] and his son [[Marko Mrnjavčević]].

At this time, the Ottoman threat was looming in the Balkans, as the Ottomans defeated the various Christian principalities, whether Serb, Bulgarian or Greek. After the Ottoman victory in the [[Battle of Maritsa]] in 1371, most of Macedonia accepted vassalage to the Ottomans and by the end of the 14th century the Ottoman Empire fully annexed it. Macedonia remained a part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] for nearly 500 years, during which time it gained a substantial [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] minority. Thessaloniki later become the home of a large [[Sephardi|Sephardi Jewish]] population following the expulsions of Jews after 1492 from [[Spain]].

}}

After the revival of Greek, Serbian, and Bulgarian statehood in the 19th century, the Ottoman lands in Europe that became identified as "Macedonia", were contested by all three governments, leading to the creation in the 1890s and 1900s of rival armed groups who divided their efforts between fighting the Turks and one another. The most important of these was the [[Bulgarian Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Committee]] (BMARC, SMARO from 1902) (an alternative version says that it consisted of the [[Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (MRO, TMORO from 1902), under [[Gotse Delchev]] who in 1903 rebelled in the so-called [[Ilinden-Preobrazhenie Uprising]], fighting for an autonomous or independent Macedonian state (before 1902 only Bulgarians could join, but afterward, it invited "any Macedonian or Odrinian, irrespective of nationality, to join together"), and the Greek efforts from 1904 until 1908 ([[Greek Struggle for Macedonia]]). Diplomatic intervention by the European powers led to plans for an autonomous Macedonia under Ottoman rule.

[[File:Greekhistory.GIF|thumb|left|Evolution of the territory of Greece. The 'Macedonia' shown is the Greek province.]]

The restricted borders of the modern Greek state at its inception in 1830 disappointed the inhabitants of northern Greece (Epirus and Macedonia).{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Addressing these concerns in 1844, the Greek Prime Minister Kolettis addressed the constitutional assembly in Athens that "the [[Kingdom of Greece (Wittelsbach)|kingdom of Greece]] is not Greece; it is only a part, the smallest and poorest, of Greece. The Greek is not only he who inhabits the kingdom, but also he who lives in Ioannina, or Thessaloniki, or Serres, or Odrin" . He mentions cities and islands that were under Ottoman possession as composing the [[Great Idea]] (Greek: Μεγάλη Ιδέα, ''Megáli Idéa'') which meant the reconstruction of the [[Ancient Greece|classical Greek world]] or the revival of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The important idea here is that for Greece, Macedonia was a region with large Greek populations expecting annexation to the new Greek state. At this time, the region which today is known as the [[Republic of Macedonia]] was part of the [[Kosovo Vilayet]].

[[File:Contested regions.jpg|thumb|left|Map of the region contested by Serbia and Bulgaria and subject to the arbitration of the Russian Tsar]]

The 1878 [[Treaty of Berlin, 1878|Congress of Berlin]] changed the Balkan map again. The treaty restored Macedonia and Thrace to the Ottoman Empire. Serbia, Romania and Montenegro were granted full independence, and some territorial expansion at the expense of the Ottoman Empire. Russia would maintain military advisors in Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia until May 1879. Austria-Hungary was permitted to occupy Bosnia, Herzegovina and the Sanjak of Novi Pazar. The Congress of Berlin also forced Bulgaria, newly given autonomy by the 1878 [[Treaty of San Stefano]], to return over half of its newly gained territory to the Ottoman Empire. This included Macedonia, a large part of which was given to Bulgaria, due to Russian pressure and the presence of significant numbers of Bulgarians and adherents to the [[Bulgarian Exarchate]]. The territorial losses dissatisfied Bulgaria; this fuelled the ambitions of many Bulgarian politicians for the following seventy years, who wanted to review the treaty – by peaceful or military means and to reunite all lands which they claimed had a Bulgarian majority. Besides, Serbia was now interested in the Macedonian lands, until then only Greece was Bulgaria's main contender, which after the addition of Thessaly to Greece in (1881) was bordering Macedonia. Thus, the Berlin Congress renewed the struggle for Turkey in Europe, including the so-called Macedonia region, rather than setting up a permanent regime. In the following years, all of the neighboring states struggled over Turkey in Europe; they were only kept at bay by their own restraints, the Ottoman Army and the territorial ambitions of the Great Powers in the region.

Serbian policy had a distinct anti-Bulgarian flavor, attempting to prevent the Bulgarian influencing the inhabitants of Macedonia. On the other hand, Bulgaria was using the power of its religious institutions (Bulgarian Exarchate established in 1870) to promote its language and make more people identify with Bulgaria. Greece, in addition, was in an advantageous position for protecting its interests through the influence of Patriarchate of Constantinople which traditionally sponsored Greek-language and Greek-culture schools also in villages with few Greeks. This put the Patriarchate in dispute with the Exarchate, which established schools with Bulgarian education. Indeed, belonging to one or another institution could define a person's national identity. Simply, if a person supported the Patriarchate they were regarded as Greek, whereas if they supported the Exarchate they were regarded as Bulgarian. Locally, however, villagers were not always able to express freely their association with one or the other institution as there were numerous armed groups trying to defend and/or expand the territory of each. Some were locally recruited and self-organized while others were sent and armed by the protecting states.

The aim of the adversaries, however, was not primarily to extend their influence over Macedonia but merely to prevent Macedonia succumbing to the influence of the other. This often violent attempt to persuade the people that they belonged to one ethnic group or another pushed some people to reject both. The severe pressure on the peaceful peasants of Macedonia worked against the plans of the Serbians and Bulgarians to make them adopt their ethnic idea and eventually a social divide became apparent. The British Ambassador in Belgrade in 1927 said: "At present the unfortunate Macedonian peasant is between the hammer and the anvil. One day 'comitadjis' come to his house and demand under threat lodging, food and money and the next day the gendarm hales him off to prison for having given them; the Macedonian is really a peaceable, fairly industrious agriculturist and if the (Serbian) government give him adequate protection, education, freedom from malaria and decent communications, there seems no reason why he should not become just as Serbian in sentiment as he was Bulgarian 10 years ago". As a result of this game of tug-of-war, the development of a distinct Macedonian national identity was impeded and delayed. Moreover, when the imperialistic plans of the surrounding states made possible the division of Macedonia, some Macedonian intellectuals such as Misirkov mentioned the necessity of creating a Macedonian national identity which would distinguish the Macedonian Slavs from Bulgarians, Serbians or Greeks.

Baptizing Macedonian Slavs as Serbian or Bulgarian aimed therefore to justify these countries' territorial claims over Macedonia. The Greek side, with the assistance of the Patriarchate that was responsible for the schools, could more easily maintain control, because they were spreading Greek identity. For the very same reason the Bulgarians, when preparing the Exarchate's government (1871) included Macedonians in the assembly as "brothers" to prevent any ethnic diversification. On the other hand, the Serbs, unable to establish Serbian-speaking schools, used propaganda. Their main concern was to prevent the [[Slavic speakers in Ottoman Macedonia|Slavic-speaking Macedonians]] from acquiring Bulgarian identity through concentrating on the myth of the ancient origins of the Macedonians and simultaneously by the classification of Bulgarians as Tatars and not as Slavs, emphasizing their 'Macedonian' characteristics as an intermediate stage between Serbs and Bulgarians. To sum up the Serbian propaganda attempted to inspire the Macedonians with a separate ethnic identity to diminish the Bulgarian influence. This choice was the 'Macedonian ethnicity'. The Bulgarians never accepted an ethnic diversity from the Slav Macedonians, giving geographic meaning to the term. In 1893 they established the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (VMRO) aiming to confront the Serbian and Greek action in Macedonia. VMRO hoped to answer the Macedonian question through a revolutionary movement, and so they instigated the [[Ilinden–Preobrazhenie Uprising|Ilinden Uprising]] (1903) to release some Ottoman territory. Bulgaria used this to internationalize the Macedonian question. Ilinden changed Greece's stance which decided to take Para-military action. In order to protect the Greek Macedonians and Greek interests, Greece sent officers to train guerrillas and organize militias ([[Greek Struggle for Macedonia|Macedonian Struggle]]), known as ''makedonomahi'' (Macedonian fighters), essentially to fight the Bulgarians. After that it was obvious that the [[Macedonian Question]] could be answered only with a war.

The rise of the Albanian and the Turkish nationalism after 1908, however, prompted Greece, Serbia and Bulgaria to bury their differences with regard to Macedonia and to form a joint coalition against the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1912. Disregarding public opinion in Bulgaria, which was in support of the establishment of an autonomous Macedonian province under a Christian governor, the Bulgarian government entered a pre-war treaty with Serbia which divided the region into two parts.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The part of Macedonia west and north of the line of partition was contested by both Serbia and Bulgaria and was subject to the arbitration of the Russian Tsar after the war. Serbia formally renounced any claims to the part of Macedonia south and east of the line, which was declared to be within the Bulgarian sphere of interest. The pre-treaty between Greece and Bulgaria, however, did not include any agreement on the division of the conquered territories – evidently both countries hoped to occupy as much territory as possible having their sights primarily set on Thessaloniki.

In the [[First Balkan War]], Bulgaria, Serbia, Greece and Montenegro occupied almost all Ottoman-held territories in Europe. Bulgaria bore the brunt of the war fighting on the Thracian front against the main Ottoman forces. Both her war expenditures and casualties in the First Balkan War were higher than those of Serbia, Greece and Montenegro combined. Macedonia itself was occupied by Greek, Serbian and Bulgarian forces. The Ottoman Empire in the [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]] in May 1913 assigned the whole of Macedonia to the [[Balkan League]], without, specifying the division of the region, to promote problems between the allies. Dissatisfied with the creation of an autonomous Albanian state, which denied her access to the [[Adriatic]], Serbia asked for the suspension of the pre-war division treaty and demanded from Bulgaria greater territorial concessions in Macedonia. Later in May the same year, Greece and Serbia signed a secret treaty in Thessaloniki stipulating the division of Macedonia according to the existing lines of control. Both Serbia and Greece, as well as Bulgaria, started to prepare for a final war of partition.

[[File:Macedonia 1913 map.png|left|thumb|Macedonia's division in 1913]]
In June 1913, Bulgarian Tsar [[Ferdinand I of Bulgaria|Ferdinand]], without consulting the government, and without any declaration of war, ordered Bulgarian troops to attack the Greek and Serbian troops in Macedonia, initiating the [[Second Balkan War]]. The Bulgarian army was in full retreat in all fronts. The Serbian army chose to stop its operations when achieved all its territorial goals and only then the Bulgarian army took a breath. During the last two days the Bulgarians managed to achieve a defensive victory against the advancing Greek army in the [[Kresna Gorge]]. However at the same time the Romanian army crossed the undefended northern border and easily advanced towards [[Sofia]]. Romania interfered in the war, in order to satisfy its territorial claims against Bulgaria. The [[Ottoman Empire]] also interfered, easily reassuming control of Eastern Thrace with [[Edirne]]. The Second Balkan War, also known as Inter-Ally War, left Bulgaria only with the Struma valley and a small part of Thrace with minor ports at the Aegean sea. Vardar Macedonia was incorporated into Serbia and thereafter referred to as South Serbia. Southern (Aegean) Macedonia was incorporated into Greece and thereafter was referred to as northern Greece. The region suffered heavily during the Second Balkan War. During its advance at the end of June, the Greek army set fire to the Bulgarian quarter of the town of [[Kilkis]] and over 160 villages around Kilkis and Serres driving some 50,000 refugees into Bulgaria proper. The Bulgarian army retaliated by burning the Greek quarter of [[Serres, Greece|Serres]] and by arming Muslims from the region of [[Drama]] which led to a [[massacre]] of Greek civilians.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

In September 1915, the Greek government authorized the landing of the troops in Thessaloniki. In 1916 the pro-German King of Greece agreed with the Germans to allow military forces of the Central Powers to enter Greek Macedonia to attack Bulgarian forces in Thessaloniki. As a result, Bulgarian troops occupied the eastern part of Greek Macedonia, including the port of [[Kavala]]. The region was, however, restored to Greece following the victory of the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] in 1918. After the destruction of the Greek Army in Asia Minor in 1922 Greece and Turkey exchanged most of Macedonia's Turkish minority and the Greek inhabitants of Thrace and [[Anatolia]], as a result of which Aegean Macedonia experienced a large addition to its population and became overwhelmingly Greek in ethnic composition. Serbian-ruled Macedonia was incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (later the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]) in 1918. Yugoslav Macedonia was subsequently subjected to an intense process of "[[Serbianization]]" during the 1920s and 1930s.

During [[World War II]] the boundaries of the region shifted yet again. When the German forces occupied the area, most of Yugoslav Macedonia and part of Aegean Macedonia were transferred for administration to Bulgaria. During the Bulgarian administration of Eastern Greek Macedonia, some 100,000 Bulgarian refugees from the region were resettled there and perhaps as many Greeks were deported or fled to other parts of Greece. Western Aegean Macedonia was occupied by [[Italy]], with the western parts of Yugoslav Macedonia being annexed to Italian-occupied Albania. The remainder of Greek Macedonia (including all of the coast) was occupied by [[Nazi Germany]]. One of the worst episodes of [[the Holocaust]] happened here when 60,000 Jews from Thessaloniki were deported to [[extermination camps]] in occupied [[Poland]]. Only a few thousand survived.

Macedonia was liberated in 1944, when the Red Army's advance in the Balkan Peninsula forced the German forces to retreat. The pre-war borders were restored under U.S. and British pressure because the Bulgarian government was insisting to keep its military units on Greek soil. The Bulgarian Macedonia returned fairly rapidly to normality, but the Bulgarian patriots in Yugoslav Macedonia underwent a process of ethnic cleansing by the Belgrade authorities, and Greek Macedonia was ravaged by the [[Greek Civil War]], which broke out in December 1944 and did not end until October 1949.

After this civil war, a large number of former ELAS fighters who took refuge in communist Bulgaria and Yugoslavia and described themselves as "ethnic Macedonians" were prohibited from reestablishing to their former estates by the Greek authorities. Most of them were accused in Greece for crimes committed during the period of the German occupation.

===Macedonia in the Balkan Wars, World War I and II===

====Balkan Wars====
{{see also|First Balkan War}}
The imminent [[dissolution of the Ottoman Empire|collapse of the Ottoman Empire]] was welcomed by the Balkan states, as it promised to restore their European territory. The [[Young Turk Revolution]] of 1908 proved a nationalistic movement thwarting the peoples' expectations of the empire's modernization and hastened the end of the Ottoman occupation of the Balkans. To this end, an alliance was struck among the Balkan states in Spring 1913. The First Balkan War, which lasted six weeks, commenced in August 1912, when Montenegro declared war on the Ottoman Empire, whose forces ultimately engaged four different wars in Thrace, Macedonia, Northern and Southern Albania and Kosovo. The Macedonian campaign was fought in atrocious conditions. The retreat of the Ottoman army from Macedonia succeeded the desperate effort of the Greek and Bulgarian forces to reach the city of [[Thessalonica]], the "single prize of the first Balkan War" for whose status no prior agreements were done. In this case possession would be equal to acquisition. The Greek forces entered the city first liberating officially, a progress only positive for them. Glenny says: "for the Greeks it was a good war".

The first Balkan War managed to liberate Balkans from Turks and settled the major issues except Macedonia. In the spring 1913 the Serbs and Greeks begun the '[[Serbianization]]' and the '[[Hellenization]]' of the parts in Macedonia they already controlled, while Bulgarians faced some difficulties against the Jews {{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} and the Turkish populations. Moreover, the possession of Thessalonica was a living dream for the Bulgarians that were preparing for a new war. For this, the Bulgarian troops had a secret order in June 1913 to launch surprise attacks on the Serbs. Greece and Serbia signed a previous bilateral defensive agreement (May 1913). Consequently, Bulgaria decided to attack Greece and Serbia. After some initial gains the Bulgarians were forced to retreat back to Bulgaria proper and lose nearly all of the land they had conquered during the first war.

The Treaty of Bucharest (August 1913) took off most of the Bulgarian conquests of the previous years. Large part of Macedonia became Southern Serbia, including the territory of what today is the Republic of Macedonia and Aegean Macedonia became Northern Greece. Greece almost doubled its territory and population size and its northern frontiers remain today, more or less the same since the Balkan Wars. However, when Serbia acquired 'Vardarska Banovina' (the present-day Republic of Macedonia), it launched having expansionist views aiming to descend to the Aegean, with Thessalonica as the highest ambition. However, Greece after the population exchange with Bulgaria, soon after its victory in the Balkan wars, managed to give national homogeneity in the Aegean and any remaining Slavic-speakers were absorbed.

Many volunteers from Macedonia joined Bulgarian army and participated in the battles against Bulgarian enemies in these wars—on the strength of the [[Macedonian-Adrianopolitan Volunteer Corps]] and other units.

====World War I====
{{see also|World War I}}
After World War I [[Macedonian front (World War I)|Macedonian Campaign]] the status quo of Macedonia remained the same. The establishment of the 'Kingdom of Serbians, Croats and Slovenes' in 1918, which in 1929 was renamed 'Yugoslavia' (South Slavia) predicted no special regime for Skopje neither recognized any Macedonian national identity. In fact, the claims to Macedonian identity remained silent at a propaganda level because, eventually, north Macedonia had been a Serbian conquest.

The situation in Serbian Macedonia changed after the Communist Revolution in Russia (1918–1919). According to Sfetas, Comintern was handling Macedonia as a matter of tactics, depending on the political circumstances. In the early 1920s it supported the position for a single and independent Macedonia in a Balkan Soviet Democracy. Actually, the Soviets desired a common front of the Bulgarian communist agriculturists and the Bulgarian-Macedonian societies to destabilize the Balkan Peninsula. The [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (IMRO), under the protection of Comintern, promoted the idea of an independent Macedonia in a Federation of Balkan states, unifying all Macedonians. However, the possible participation of Bulgaria in a new war, on the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]] side, ended the Soviet support some years later.

====World War II====
{{see also|World War II}}
Bulgaria joined the [[Axis powers]] in 1941, when German troops prepared to invade Greece from Romania reached the Bulgarian borders and demanded permission to pass through Bulgarian territory. Threatened by direct military confrontation, [[Tsar Boris III]] had no choice but to join the fascist block, which officially happened on 1 March 1941. There was little popular opposition, since the Soviet Union was in a non-aggression pact with Germany.

On 6 April 1941, despite having officially joined the Axis Powers, the Bulgarian government maintained a course of military passivity during the initial stages of the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] and the [[Battle of Greece]]. As German, Italian, and Hungarian troops crushed Yugoslavia and Greece, the Bulgarians remained on the sidelines. The Yugoslav government surrendered on 17 April. The Greek government was to hold out until 30 April. On 20 April, the period of Bulgarian passivity ended. The Bulgarian Army entered the Aegean region. The goal was to gain an [[Aegean Sea]] outlet in Thrace and Eastern Macedonia and much of eastern Serbia. The so-called [[Vardar Banovina]] was divided between Bulgaria and Italians which occupied West Macedonia. The Bulgarian occupation of Macedonia was viewed as oppressive by the inhabitants of the region, further distancing any previous affiliations between Macedonian and Bulgarians.

During the German occupation of Greece (1941–1944) the Greek Communist Party-KKE was the main resistance factor with its military branch [[Ethniko Apeleftherotiko Metopo|EAM]]-[[Ethnikos Laikos Apeleftherotikos Stratos|ELAS]] (National Liberation Front). Although many members of EAM were Slavic-speaking, they had either Bulgarian, Greek or distinct Macedonian conscience. To take advantage of the situation KKE established [[SNOF]] with the cooperation of the Yugoslav leader Tito, who was ambitious enough to make plans for Greek Macedonia. For this he established the Anti-Fascistic Assembly for the National Liberation of Macedonia (ASNOM) giving an actual liberating character to the whole region of Macedonia. Besides, KKE was very positive to the option of a greater Macedonia, including the Greek region, since it realized that a victory in the Greek Civil War was utopic. Later EAM and SNOF disagreed in issues of policy and they finally crashed and the latter was expelled from Greece (1944).

====Post–World War II====
The end of the War did not bring peace to Greece and a strenuous civil war between the Government forces and EAM broke out with about 50,000 casualties for both sides. The defeat of the Communists in 1949 forced their Slav-speaking members to either leave Greece or fully adopt Greek language and surnames. The Slav minorities were discriminated against, and not even recognised as a minority.  Since 1923 the only internationally recognized minority in Greece are the Muslims in Western Thrace.

Yugoslav Macedonia was the only region where Yugoslav communist leader [[Josip Broz Tito]] had not developed a Partisan movement because of the Bulgarian occupation of a large part of that area. To improve the situation, in 1943 the Communist Party of 'Macedonia' was established in [[Tetovo]] with the prospect that it would support the resistance against the Axis. In the meantime, the Bulgarians' violent repression led to loss of moral support from the civilian population. By the end of the war "a Macedonia national consciousness hardly existed beyond a general conviction, gained from bitter experience, that rule from Sofia was as unpalatable as that from Belgrade. But if there were no Macedonian nation there was a Communist Party of Macedonia, around which the People's Republic of Macedonia was built".

Tito thus separated Yugoslav Macedonia from Serbia after the war. It became a republic of the new federal Yugoslavia (as the Socialist Republic of Macedonia) in 1946, with its capital at [[Skopje]]. Tito also promoted the concept of a separate Macedonian nation, as a means of severing the ties of the [[Macedonian Slav|Slav population of Yugoslav Macedonia]] with Bulgaria. Although the [[Macedonian language]] is very close to [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], the differences were deliberately emphasized and the region's historical figures were promoted as being uniquely Macedonian (rather than Serbian or Bulgarian).{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} A separate [[Macedonian Orthodox Church]] was established, splitting off from the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]], but it has not been recognized by any other Orthodox Church, including the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]]. The Communist Party sought to deter pro-Bulgarian sentiment, which was punished severely; convictions were still being handed down as late as 1991.

Tito had a number of reasons for doing this. First, as an ethnic Croat, he wanted to reduce Serbia's dominance in Yugoslavia; establishing a territory formerly considered Serbian as an equal to Serbia within Yugoslavia achieved this effect. Secondly, he wanted to sever the ties of the Macedonian Slav population with Bulgaria because recognition of that population as Bulgarian would have undermined the unity of the Yugoslav federation. Third of all, Tito sought to justify future Yugoslav claims towards the rest of Macedonia ([[Pirin Macedonia|Pirin]] and [[Aegean Macedonia|Aegean]]), in the name of the "liberation" of the region. The potential "Macedonian" state would remain as a constituent republic within Yugoslavia, and so Yugoslavia would manage to get access to the [[Aegean Sea]].

Tito's designs on Macedonia were asserted as early as August 1944, when in a proclamation he claimed that his goal was to reunify "all parts of Macedonia, divided in 1912 and 1913 by Balkan imperialists".{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} To this end, he opened negotiations with Bulgaria for a new federal state, which would also probably have included Albania, and supported the Greek Communists in the [[Greek Civil War]]. The idea of reunification of all of Macedonia under Communist rule was abandoned as late as 1949 when the Greek Communists lost and Tito fell out with the [[Soviet Union]] and pro-Soviet Bulgaria.

Across the border in Greece, [[Slavic speaking minority in northern Greece|Slavophones]] were seen as a potentially disloyal "[[fifth column]]" within the Greek state by both the US and Greece, and their existence as a minority was officially denied. Greeks were resettled in the region many of whom emigrated (especially to [[Australia]]) along with many Greek-speaking natives, because of the hard economic conditions after the Second World War and the Greek Civil War. Although there was some liberalization between 1959 and 1967, the Greek military dictatorship re-imposed harsh restrictions. The situation gradually eased after Greece's return to democracy, although even as recently as the 1990s Greece has been criticised by international human rights activists for "harassing" Macedonian Slav political activists, who, nonetheless, are free to maintain their own political party ([[Rainbow (political party)|Rainbow]]). Elsewhere in Greek Macedonia, economic development after the war was brisk and the area rapidly became the most prosperous part of the region. The coast was heavily developed for tourism, particularly on the [[Halkidiki]] peninsula.

Under [[Georgi Dimitrov]], [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] loyalist and head of the [[Comintern]], Bulgaria initially accepted the existence of a distinctive Macedonian identity. It had been agreed that [[Pirin Macedonia]] would join Yugoslav Macedonia and for this reason the population declared itself "Macedonian" in the 1946 census.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} This caused resentment and many people were imprisoned or interned in rural areas outside Macedonia. After Tito's split from the [[Soviet bloc]] this position was abandoned and the existence of a Macedonian nation or language was denied.

Attempts of Macedonian historians after the 1940s to claim a number of prominent figures of the 19th century [[History of Bulgaria|Bulgarian]] cultural revival and armed resistance movement as Macedonians has caused ever since a bitter resentment in Sofia. Bulgaria has repeatedly accused the Republic of Macedonia of appropriating Bulgarian national heroes and symbols and of editing works of literature and historical documents so as to prove the existence of a [[Macedonian Slav]] consciousness before the 1940s. The publication in the Republic of Macedonia of the folk song collections 'Bulgarian Folk Songs' by the [[Miladinov Brothers]] and 'Songs of the Macedonian Bulgarians' by Serbian archaeologist Verkovic under the "politically correct" titles 'Collection' and 'Macedonian Folk Songs' are some of the examples quoted by the Bulgarians. The issue has soured the relations of Bulgaria with former Yugoslavia and later with the Republic of Macedonia for decades.

==Foundation of the Republic of Macedonia as an independent state==
[[Kiro Gligorov]], the president of Yugoslav Macedonia, sought to keep his republic outside the fray of the [[Yugoslav wars]] in the early 1990s. Yugoslav Macedonia's very existence had depended on the active support of the Yugoslav state and Communist Party. As both began to collapse, the Macedonian authorities allowed and encouraged a stronger assertion of Macedonian Slav national identity than before. This included toleration of demands from Macedonian Slav nationalists for the reunification of Macedonia. The [[Albanians in the Republic of Macedonia]] were unhappy about an erosion of their national rights in the face of a more assertive Macedonian Slav nationalism. Some nationalist Serbs called for the republic's re-incorporation into Serbia, although in practice this was never a likely prospect, given Serbia's preoccupation with the wars in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] and [[Croatia]] and the relatively small number of Serbs in the Republic of Macedonia compared to Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.

As communism fell throughout Eastern Europe in the late 20th century, Macedonia followed its other federation partners and declared its independence from Yugoslavia in late 1991. In 1991, the (then Socialist) Republic of Macedonia held a referendum on independence which produced an overwhelming majority in favor of independence. The referendum was boycotted by the ethnic Albanians, although they did create ethnic political parties and actively contributed in the Macedonian government, parliament etc. The republic seceded peacefully from the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav federation]], declaring its independence as the Socialist Republic of Macedonia. Bulgaria was consequently the first country to officially recognize Republic of Macedonia's independence – as early as February 1992, followed by other countries as well. The new Macedonian constitution took effect 20 November 1991 and called for a system of government based on a parliamentary democracy. [[Kiro Gligorov]] became the first President of the new independent state, succeeded by [[Boris Trajkovski]]. In early January 2001 [[2001 Macedonia conflict|armed conflict]] took place between the ethnic Albanian National Liberation Army ([[National Liberation Army (Macedonia)|UÇK]]) militant group and the Republic of Macedonia's security forces. The conflict partially ended with the signing of the [[Ohrid Framework Agreement]] by the government of the Republic of Macedonia and Albanian representatives on 13 August 2001, which provided for greater rights for Macedonian Albanian population. In January 2002, the Macedonian conflict ended when the amnesty was announced to Albanian irregulars and rebels. Occasional unrest continued throughout 2002.

==Controversy between the Republic of Macedonia and Greece==
{{Main|Macedonia naming dispute}}
A controversy exists in regard to whether or not any parts of the historic region of Macedonia are incorporated in the present-day Republic of Macedonia, as very little if any of the ancient Macedonian kingdom is. There is also controversy, however, with regard to the Slavic peoples who are concentrated in less than half of the region. They first arrived in the late 6th and early 7th centuries AD when [[Slavic languages|Slavic]]-speaking populations overturned Macedonia's [[Greeks|Greek]] ethnic composition.&lt;ref name="Britannica-Macedonia"&gt;Macedonia. (2006). In ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Retrieved 16 June 2006, from Encyclopædia Britannica Premium Service: [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article?tocId=4411]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the appropriation by the "Republic of Macedonia" of what Greece held as its "Greek symbols", raised concerns in Greece as well as fuelling nationalist anger.&lt;ref&gt;Floudas, Demetrius Andreas; {{cite news|publisher=24 (1996) Journal of Political and Military Sociology, 285 |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3719/is_199601/ai_n8752910 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060127053906/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3719/is_199601/ai_n8752910 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=27 January 2006 |title=A Name for a Conflict or a Conflict for a Name? An Analysis of Greece's Dispute with FYROM |accessdate=11 February 2008 |year=1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This anger was reinforced by the legacy of the Civil War and the view in some quarters, that members of Greece's [[Slavic speaking minority in northern Greece|Slavic-speaking minority]] were pro-Yugoslavian and presented a danger to its borders. The status of the Republic of Macedonia became a heated political issue in Greece where demonstrations took place in [[Athens]] while one million Macedonian Greeks took to the streets in [[Thessaloniki]] in 1992, under the slogan: "Macedonia is Greek", referring to the name and ancient history of the region, not posing a territorial claim against their northern neighbor. Initially, the Greek government objected formally to any use of the name Macedonia (including any derivative names) and also to the use of symbols such as the [[Vergina Sun]]. On the other hand, also in 1992, demonstrations by more than 100,000 ethnic Slav Macedonians took place in Skopje, the capital of the Republic of Macedonia, over the failure to receive recognition and supporting the constitutional name of the country.

The controversy was not just nationalist, but it also played out in Greece's internal politics. The two leading Greek political parties, the ruling conservative [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] under [[Constantine Mitsotakis]] and the socialist [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement|PASOK]] under [[Andreas Papandreou]], sought to outbid each other in whipping up nationalist sentiment and the long-term (rather than immediate) threat posed by the [[Foreign relations of the Republic of Macedonia#Constitutional issue|apparent irredentist policies]] of Skopje. To complicate matters further, New Democracy itself was divided; the then prime minister, Mitsotakis, favored a compromise solution on the Macedonian question, while his foreign minister [[Adonis Samaras]] took a hard-line approach. The two eventually fell out and Samaras was sacked, with Mitsotakis reserving the foreign ministry for himself. He failed to reach an agreement on the Macedonian issue despite [[United Nations]] mediation; he fell from power in October 1993, largely as a result of Samaras causing the government's majority of one to fall in September 1993.

When Andreas Papandreou took power following the October 1993 elections, he established a "hard line" position on the issue. The United Nations recommended recognition of the "Republic of Macedonia" under the temporary name of the "former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia", which would be used internationally while the country continued to use "Republic of Macedonia" as its constitutional name. The [[United States]] and European Union (therefore, including Greece) agreed to this proposal and duly recognized the Republic of Macedonia. This was followed by new, though smaller demonstrations in Greek cities against what was termed a "betrayal" by Greece's allies. Papandreou supported and encouraged the demonstrations, boosting his own popularity by taking the "hard line" against the Republic of Macedonia. In February 1994, he imposed a total trade embargo on the country, with the exception of food, medicines and humanitarian aid. The effect on the Republic of Macedonia's economy was limited, mainly because the real damage to its economy had been caused by the collapse of Yugoslavia and the loss of central European markets due to the war. Also, many Greeks broke the trade embargo by entering through Bulgaria. However, the embargo had bad impact on the Republic of Macedonia's economy as the country was cut off from the port of Thessaloniki and became landlocked because of the UN embargo on Yugoslavia to the north, and the Greek embargo to the south. Later, the signing of the Interim accord between Greece and the Republic of Macedonia marked the increased cooperation between the two neighboring states. The blockade had a political cost for Greece, as there was little understanding or sympathy for the country's position, and exasperation over what was seen as Greek obstructionism from some of its European Union partners. Athens was criticized in some quarters for contributing to the rising tension in the Balkans, even though the wars in the former Yugoslavia were widely seen as having been triggered by the premature recognition of its successor republics, a move to which Greece had objected from the beginning.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} It later emerged that Greece had only agreed to the dissolution of Yugoslavia in return for EU solidarity on the Macedonian issue.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} In 1994, the [[European Commission]] took Greece to the [[European Court of Justice]] in an effort to overturn the embargo, but while the court provisionally ruled in Greece's favor, the embargo was lifted by Athens the following year before a final verdict was reached. This was for the "Republic of Macedonia" and Greece to enter into an "interim agreement" in which the Republic of Macedonia agreed to remove any implied territorial claims to the greater Macedonia region from its constitution and to drop the Vergina Sun from its flag. In return, Greece lifted the blockade.

Republic of Macedonia, Croatia and Albania were qualified to join NATO and an invitation for those three countries was planned to be issued on the NATO summit in Bucharest (Romania), in April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2008/02/mil-080221-afps03.htm |title=Albania, Croatia, Macedonia Qualify for NATO Membership, U.S. Official Says |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date=21 February 2008 |accessdate=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the beginning of the summit, the American president Bush said that NATO would make a historic decision on the admission of three Balkan nations: Croatia, Albania and Macedonia; and that the United States strongly supported inviting these nations to join NATO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/4/2/worldupdates/2008-04-02T203446Z_01_NOOTR_RTRMDNC_0_-328122-1&amp;sec=Worldupdates |title=Greece stands by NATO veto threat for Macedonia – World Updates &amp;#124; The Star Online |publisher=Thestar.com.my |date= |accessdate=7 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609203125/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2008%2F4%2F2%2Fworldupdates%2F2008-04-02T203446Z_01_NOOTR_RTRMDNC_0_-328122-1&amp;sec=Worldupdates |archivedate=9 June 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the summit NATO leaders decided not to extend a membership invitation to Macedonia because Greece vetoed the move after the dispute over the name issue. The Macedonian representative and negotiator with Greece in the name issue complained that the Republic of Macedonia was punished not because it had failed to fulfill NATO accession criteria, but because it had been trying to defend its national identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=91875 |title=Bulgaria: Macedonia Remains Out of NATO Because of Greek Veto over Name Dispute – Novinite.com – Sofia News Agency |publisher=Novinite.com |date=3 April 2008 |accessdate=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NATO leaders agreed to extend a membership invitation for Macedonia as soon as the name issue with Greece is resolved, but until now no progress has been made in the negotiations between the Republic of Macedonia and Greece to resolve the name issue.

In November 2008, Republic of Macedonia filed a lawsuit against Greece before the [[International Court of Justice]] in The Hague accusing Athens that it violated the Interim Accord by blocking its NATO membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20081117-macedonia-sues-greece-blocking-nato-entry-membership-name |title=Macedonia sues Greece for blocking NATO entry |publisher=FRANCE 24 |date=17 November 2008 |accessdate=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, the two countries signed an agreement by which Macedonia agreed to use the provisional reference in international organizations, while Greece pledged not to block Macedonia's integration into the European Union and NATO.&lt;ref name="Interim Accord"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://untreaty.un.org/unts/120001_144071/6/3/00004456.pdf |title=Interim Accord |year=1995 |publisher=[[United Nations]] |accessdate=14 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325011434/http://untreaty.un.org/unts/120001_144071/6/3/00004456.pdf |archivedate=25 March 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, the European Parliament expressed support for the Republic of Macedonia's EU candidacy and asked the EU to grant the country a date for the start of accession talks by the end of 2009, regretting that the country is waiting three years after the country was granted a candidate status, which makes a demoralizing effect on Macedonia and brings risks of destabilizing the whole region. The parliament also recommended a speedy lifting of the visa regime for the country citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://balkaninsight.com/en/main/news/17331/ |title=All Balkans Home |publisher=Balkan Insight |date=21 January 2011 |accessdate=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy between the Republic of Macedonia and Bulgaria==
The number of ethnic Macedonians in Bulgaria is controversial as several Bulgarian censuses showed conflicting numbers of ethnic Macedonians living in that country. As the Bulgarian authorities did not publish the results of the 1946 census regarding the number of ethnic Macedonians in Bulgaria, Yugoslav sources claimed that some 252,000 people declared themselves as Macedonians in that census. Bulgarian embassy in London in 1991 stated that some 169,000 people were recorded as Macedonians on the same census.&lt;ref&gt;Poulton, Hugh (2000). Who are the Macedonians?. C. Hurst and co. Publishers, p.148. {{ISBN|1-85065-534-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The census in 1956 registered 187,789 ethnic Macedonians in Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;Bates, Daniel. 1994. "What's in a Name: Minorities, Identity and Politics in Bulgaria," Identities, Vol.1, No.2, May 1994&lt;/ref&gt; During this period the [[Macedonian Language]] was to be the official language of [[Pirin Macedonia]].&lt;ref&gt;Poulton, Hugh (2000). Who are the Macedonians?. C. Hurst and co. Publishers, p.107. {{ISBN|1-85065-534-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1992 the number of the ethnic Macedonians was 10,803&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greekhelsinki.gr/pdf/cedime-se-bulgaria-macedonians.PDF Center for Documentation and Information on Minorities in Europe – Southeast Europe, Macedonians of Bulgaria] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060723084106/http://www.greekhelsinki.gr/pdf/cedime-se-bulgaria-macedonians.PDF |date=23 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2001 only 5,071 citizens declared as ethnic Macedonians. Bulgarian governments and public opinion throughout the period continued their policy of non-recognition of Macedonians as a distinct ethnic group. The recent Bulgarian view on the issue is that the Bulgarian policy after the Second World War regarding the Macedonians in Bulgaria was conducted despite the unwillingness of the local population to cooperate, in the conditions of the pressure and reprisals by the Bulgarian communists authorities against the Bulgarians in Pirin Macedonia.&lt;ref&gt;Ангелов, Веселин. Хроника на едно национално предателство, София 1999, p. 298-302&lt;/ref&gt; After 1958 when the pressure from [[Moscow]] decreased, Sofia turned back to the view that the separate Macedonian language did not exist and that the [[Macedonians (Bulgarians)|Macedonians]] in [[Blagoevgrad province]] (Pirin Macedonia) were actually Bulgarians.

There are several ethnic Macedonian organizations in Bulgaria: "Traditional Macedonian Organization Ilinden", later renamed the "[[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization|IMRO]] independent – Ilinden", registered in 1992 at the Sofia City Court. Later, in 1998, the organization was registered as a public NGO. The "United Macedonian Organization (UMO) – Ilinden" is another organization. In 1990, the Blagoevgrad District Court refused to register this organization as some parts of the organization statute were not in accordance with the Bulgarian Constitution. In October 1994 this association split up on three different factions. Later two wings were unified under the "UMO Ilinden – PIRIN" organization. In 1998 the European Commission of Human Rights gave admissibility to two out of five complaints of Macedonians from Pirin Macedonia. After the [[Bulgaria]]n Electoral Committee endorsed in 2001 the registration of a wing of UMO Ilinden, which had dropped separatist demands from its Charter, the mother organization became largely inactive. In 2007, the Sofia City Court refused registration of UMO Ilinden Pirin organization, despite an October 2005 ruling by the European Court of Human Rights that a previous ban of the party violated rights to freedom of association and assembly. In November the European Parliament Rapporteur on Bulgaria and the Enlargement Commissioner of the European Commission urged the government to register the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/refworld/rwmain?page=search&amp;amp;docid=46558ec111&amp;amp;skip=0&amp;amp;query=ilinden|title=Error|website=www.unhcr.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were repeated complaints of official harassment of ethnic Macedonian activists in the 1990s. Attempts of ethnic Macedonian organization UMO Ilinden to commemorate the grave of revolutionary [[Yane Sandanski]] throughout the 1990s were usually hampered by the Bulgarian police. Several incidents of mobbing of UMO Ilinden members by Bulgarian Macedonian organization IMRO activists were also reported.

There is a newspaper published by the Macedonian organizations in Bulgaria, ''Narodna Volja'' ("People's Will"), which is printed in 2,500 copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greekhelsinki.gr/pdf/cedime-se-bulgaria-macedonians.PDF |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-07-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060723084106/http://www.greekhelsinki.gr/pdf/cedime-se-bulgaria-macedonians.PDF |archivedate=23 July 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cases of harassment of organizations of the Bulgarians in Republic of Macedonia and activists have been reported. In 2000 several teenagers threw smoke bombs at the conference of Bulgarian organization Radko in Skopje, causing panic and confusion among the delegates. The [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonian]] Constitutional Court annulled the status and program of the organization (hence terminating its existence), as those documents question the constitutional establishment of Macedonia and creating national and religious hatred and intolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://groups.yahoo.com/group/balkanhr/message/1895|title=Yahoo! Groups|website=groups.yahoo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, apparently there are very little or not reported public activities of that organization.

In 2001 Radko issued in Skopje the original version of the folk song collection ''Bulgarian Folk Songs'' by the [[Miladinov Brothers]] (issued under an edited name in the Republic of Macedonia and viewed as a collection of Slav Macedonian lyrics). The book triggered a wave of other publications, among which the memoirs of the Greek bishop of [[Kastoria]], in which he talked about the Greek-Bulgarian church struggle at the beginning of the 20th century, as well the &lt;!--http://vmro.150m.com/en/carnegie/ --&gt; Report of the Carnegie Commission on the causes and conduct of the Balkan Wars from 1913. Neither of these addressed the ethnic Macedonian population of Macedonia as Macedonians but as Bulgarians. Being the first publications to question the official Macedonian position of the existence of a distinct Macedonian identity going back to the time of [[Alexander the Great]] ([[Macedonism]]), the books triggered a reaction of shock and disbelief in Macedonian public opinion. The scandal after the publication of ''Bulgarian Folk Songs'' resulted in the sacking of the Macedonian Minister of Culture, Dimitar Dimitrov.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.online.bg/kultura/my_html/2216/makedon.htm|title=Вестник "Култура", бр.8/9, 1 март 2002 г.|first=Kultura Weekly Newspaper - Sofia,|last=Bulgaria|website=www.online.bg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2000, Bulgaria started to grant Bulgarian citizenship to members of the Bulgarian minorities in a number of countries, including the Republic of Macedonia. The vast majority of the applications have been from Macedonian citizens. As of May 2004, some 14,000 Macedonians had applied for a Bulgarian citizenship on the grounds of Bulgarian origin and 4,000 of them had already received their Bulgarian passports. According to the official Bulgarian sources, in the period between 2000 and 2006 some 30,000 Macedonian citizens applied for Bulgarian citizenship, attracted by the Bulgaria's recent positive development and the opportunity to get European Union passports after Bulgaria joined EU on the beginning of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = The Sofia Echo: 82 000 Foreigners apply for Bulgarian citizenship| url = http://www.sofiaecho.com/article/82-000-foreigners-apply-for-bulgarian-citizenship/id_18185/catid_68| date =  16 October 2006 | accessdate = 11 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 the former Macedonian Premier and chief of IMRO-DPMNE [[Ljubčo Georgievski]] became a Bulgarian citizen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Former Macedonian Prime Minister received a Bulgarian passport | publisher = Trud | date =  16 July 2006| language = Bulgarian }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Former Prime Minister of Macedonia became Bulgarian | publisher = Monitor | date = 16 July 2006 | accessdate = 16 July 2006 | url = http://www.monitor.bg/article?sid=&amp;aid=87934&amp;cid=1&amp;eid=775 | language = Bulgarian | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110706143152/http://www.monitor.bg/article?sid=&amp;aid=87934&amp;cid=1&amp;eid=775 | archivedate = 6 July 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Expremier-deputy of Macedonia Ljubcho Georgievski declared: "I'm Bulgarian" and received citizenship, passport and registration in Blagoevgrad, pulling down the pyramid of historical falsifications of Skopje | publisher = Struma | date = 14 July 2006 | accessdate = 16 July 2006 | url = http://www.struma.com/contents_def/home.html | language = Bulgarian | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061104012137/http://www.struma.com/contents_def/home.html | archivedate = 4 November 2006 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rules governing good neighbourly relations agreed between [[Bulgaria]] and the [[Republic of Macedonia]] were set in the [[s:Joint Declaration of 22 February 1999|Joint Declaration of 22 February 1999]] reaffirmed by a joint memorandum signed on 22 January 2008 in Sofia.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Bulgarian Policies on the Republic of Macedonia|''Bulgarian Policies on the Republic of Macedonia: Recommendations on the development of good neighbourly relations following Bulgaria's accession to the EU and in the context of NATO and EU enlargement in the Western Balkans'']].

Bulgaria has proposed to sign a treaty (based on that 1999 Joint Declaration) guaranteeing the good neighbourly relations between the two countries, to enable Bulgarian support for the accession of the Republic of Macedonia to the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sofiaecho.com/article/bulgarias-position-concerning-macedonia-unchanged--kalfin/id_16822/catid_64 Bulgaria's Position Concerning Macedonia Unchanged – Kalfin.] The Sofia Echo, 31 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/main/news/26662/ Bulgaria Treaty Proposal Called 'Indecent'.] BalkanInsight, 17 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4555">An alluvial '''[http://www.megafans.in/ megafan]''' is a large cone or fan-shaped deposit built up by complex deposition patterns of stream flows originating from a single source point known as an apex. Megafans differ from [[Alluvial fan]]s in their sheer size. Due to their larger size, they may be formed by different geomorphic processes. The criterion of what differentiates megafans from typical alluvial fans is an artificial one of scale. The scale divide varies in the literature, with the most common being a 100-km apex-to-toe length. Alternative values as little of 30-km apex-to-toe length have been proposed, as well as alternative metrics like coverage areas of greater than 10,000 square-km.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Latrubesse | first1 = E.

==Formation==
The flow source from the apex occupies a portion of the fans apron, building up that portion with depositions. Through complex processes like avulsion, the stream changes course over time occupying different areas of the fan. Over long periods of time, sediment builds up creating a fan formation. Generally the three-dimensional architecture of megafan deposits consists of multi-storied sandsheets, gravel in upper reaches, interbedded with overbank muddy layers, thickness and facies distribution vary from upstream to downstream reaches &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Latrubesse | first1 = E.

Rivers forming large fans happen in various settings around the world most notably, in foreland settings (e.g. Kosi, Gandak, Pastaza), intracratonic basins (e.g. Pantanal, Taquari, Cuiaba), and in complex settings like in the case of Pilcomayo. Although the distribution of megafans occur throughout many environments, the Tropics are home of the largest megafans of the world in the Chaco Plain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Latrubesse | first1 = E.

==History==
{{Main article|History of Mithila Region|}}
{{See also|Videha}}

===Vedic period===
Mithila first gained prominence after being settled by [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]] peoples who established the [[Videha]] kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Witzel]] (1989), ''Tracing the Vedic dialects in Dialectes dans les litteratures Indo-Aryennes'' ed. Caillat, Paris, pages 13, 17 116–124, 141–143&lt;/ref&gt;
During the late Vedic period (c. 1100–500 BCE), Videha became one of the major political and cultural centers of South Asia, along with Kuru and Pañcāla. The kings of the Videha Kingdom were called [[Janaka]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Witzel, M. |author-link=Michael Witzel |year=1989 |chapter=Tracing the Vedic dialects |title=Dialectes dans les litteratures Indo-Aryennes |location=Paris |editor1-last=Caillat |editor1-first=C. |pages=141–143 |publisher=Fondation Hugot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Videha Kingdom was later incorporated into the [[Vajji]] confederacy, which had its capital in the city of [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vaishali]], which is also in Mithila.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hemchandra, R. |year=1972 |title=Political History of Ancient India |location=Calcutta |publisher=University of Calcutta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval period===
From the 11th century to the 20th century, Mithila was ruled by various indigenous dynasties. The first of these were the [[Karnatas of Mithila|Karnatas]] who were of [[Parmar]] [[Rajput]] origin, the [[Oiniwar Dynasty]] who were [[Maithil Brahmins]] and the Khandavalas of [[Raj Darbhanga]] who were also Maithil Brahmins. It was during this period that the capital of Mithila was shifted to [[Darbhanga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=A0i94Z5C8HMC&amp;pg=PA56 | title=Anthropology of Ancient Hindu Kingdoms: A Study in Civilizational Perspective|pages=55-56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Mithila is a distinct geographical region with natural boundaries like rivers and hills. It is largely a flat and fertile [[alluvial]] plain criss-crossed by numerous rivers which originate from the [[Himalayas]]. Due to the flat plains and fertile land Mithila has a rich variety of biotic resources; however, because of frequent floods people could not take full advantage of these resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Thakur, B.|author2= Singh, D.P.|author3= Jha, T. |year=2007 |chapter=The Folk Culture of Mithila |editor=Thakur, B.|editor2= Pomeroy, G.|editor3= Cusack, C.|editor4= Thakur, S.K. |pages=422–446 |chapterurl=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=odCJoIaDqZ0C&amp;lpg=PA424&amp;pg=PA422#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=City, Society, and Planning. Volume 2: Society}}{{dead link|date=July 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven major rivers flow through Mithila: [[Mahananda River|Mahananda]], [[Gandaki River|Gandak]], [[Koshi River|Kosi]], [[Bagmati River|Bagmati]], [[Kamala River|Kamala]], [[Balan River|Balan]], and the [[Burhi Gandak River|Budhi Gandak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bihar.ws/info/Geography-of-Bihar/Rivers-of-Bihar.html |title=Rivers of Bihar &amp;#124; Bihar Articles |publisher=Bihar.ws |accessdate=4 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723055131/http://www.bihar.ws/info/Geography-of-Bihar/Rivers-of-Bihar.html |archivedate=23 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They flow from the Himalayas in the north to the [[Ganges]] river in the south. These rivers regularly flood, depositing silt onto the farmlands and sometimes causing death or hardship.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

==People==
{{Main article|Maithils}}
Maithili language speakers are referred to as Maithils and they are an [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]] [[ethno-linguistic]] group. There are an estimated 35 million Maithils in India alone. The vast majority of them are [[Hindu]] but there is a small [[Muslim]] minority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fOQkpcVcd9AC&amp;pg=PT215#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Ethnic Groups of South Asia and the Pacific: An Encyclopedia: An Encyclopedia | author=James B. Minahan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The people of Mithila can be split into various [[Indian caste system|caste]]/[[jāti|clan]] affiliations such as [[Brahmins]], [[Rajput]]s, [[Kayastha]]s, [[Ahir]]s, [[Kurmi]]s, [[Koeri]]s, [[Baniya]]s and many more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=A0i94Z5C8HMC&amp;pg=PA33 | title=Anthropology of Ancient Hindu Kingdoms: A Study in Civilizational Perspective | author=Makhan Jha | pages=33–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mount Oread''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɔr|i|.|æ|d}} is a hill in [[Lawrence, Kansas]] upon which the [[University of Kansas]] is located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qi9cXyTWt9EC&amp;pg=PA331#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true | title=Kansas: A Cyclopedia of State History, Volume 2 | publisher=Standard Publishing Company | author=Blackmar, Frank Wilson | year=1912 | pages=331}}&lt;/ref&gt; It sits on the [[water divide]] between the [[Kansas River|Kansas]] and [[Wakarusa River|Wakarusa]] rivers.  It was named after the [[Oread Institute]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]].  The hill was originally called Hogback Ridge by many Lawrence residents until the Oread name was adopted in 1866.&lt;ref name=KUConnection&gt;{{cite web | title =This Week in KU History | url =http://www.kuconnection.org/archive/2002/03/people_Fullers.asp | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20121130014530/http://www.kuconnection.org/archive/2002/03/people_Fullers.asp | archivedate =2012-11-30 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For emigrants going westward by [[wagon train]] on the [[Oregon Trail#Routes|Oregon Trail]], "The Hill", as Mount Oread is now commonly referred to by residents of Lawrence, was the next big [[topographical]] challenge after crossing the [[Wakarusa River]] near today's [[Haskell Indian Nations University]].

[[File:The Oread Hotel Lawrence Nima 13.jpg|thumb|160px|left|''The Oread'', a hotel on Mount Oread, about one block south of the Old North College site.]]
According to the [[United States Geological Survey]], Mount Oread is located approximately {{convert|1037|ft|m}} above [[sea level]]. By way of comparison, downtown Lawrence is about {{convert|846|ft|m}} above sea level.  Mount Oread is perhaps best known for being the staging area of [[William Quantrill|William Quantrill's]] [[Battle of Lawrence|raid]] into Lawrence on August 21, 1863, during the [[American Civil War]]. Presently, the campus of the [[University of Kansas]] (KU) rests on Mount Oread.

Mount Oread is the [[Type locality (geology)|type locality]] for the [[Oread Limestone]], and so, gives its name to the Oread [[Escarpment]] rising in this region of Kansas. Oread Limestone was quarried from the hilltop and used in the earliest of the campus buildings of KU, including [[Spooner Hall]] and [[University of Kansas Natural History Museum|Dyche Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |title= National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: University of Kansas Historic District  |publisher= National Park Service |url= https://www.nps.gov/nr/feature/places/pdfs/13000167.pdf |quote = Local craftsmen quarried Oread limestone from the north slope of the ridge for the first generation of buildings. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Provinces of Cuba|provinces]] of [[Cuba]] are divided into 168 [[municipality|municipalities]] or ''municipios''. They were defined by Cuban Law Number 1304 of July 3, 1976 &lt;ref&gt;Fifth United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names, Vol. II, published by the United Nations, New York, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; and reformed in 2010 with the abrogation of the municipality of Varadero and the creation of two new provinces: [[Artemisa Province|Artemisa]] and [[Mayabeque Province|Mayabeque]] in place of former [[La Habana Province]].

{{Contains Pashto text}}

The [[Pakistan]]i [[Provinces of Pakistan|province]] of '''[[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]]''' ({{lang-ps|خیبر پښتونخوا}}, {{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|خیبر پختونخوا}}}}) has been known by a number of names throughout its [[History of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|history]]. In addition to '''[[North-West Frontier Province (1901–2010)|North-West Frontier Province]]''', the official name by which it was known from 1901 to 2010, other names used or proposed for the province include '''Gandhara''', '''Afghania''', '''Pakhtunistan''', '''Pashtunistan''', '''Pathanistan''', '''Sarhad''', '''Abasin''', '''Khyber''', or a combination of these and other names.

==North-West Frontier Province==
{{Further|North-West Frontier Province (1901–1955)}}
For over a hundred years after its founding as a province of [[British India]] in 1901, it was known as the '''[[North-West Frontier Province (1901–1955)|North-West Frontier Province]]''' ({{lang-ps|شمال مغربی سرحدی صوبہ}} ''Śhumāl maġribī sarhadī sūbha''). Unofficially, it was known as '''Sarhad''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|سرحد}}}}), derived from the province's Urdu name, which means "frontier".

==Pakhtunkhwa==
{{See also|Pashtunistan}}
'''Pakhtunkhwa''', '''Pakhtoonkhwa''', '''Pukhtunkhwa''' or '''Pashtunkhwa''' ({{lang-ps|پښتونخوا}}) has often been the name used by the [[Pashtun people]] for the [[Pashtunized]] and [[Pashtunistan|Pashtun-dominated areas]] of [[Pakistan]]. More recently it was used by [[Pashtun nationalism|Pashtun nationalists]] in Pakistan as the name by which they wanted to rename the former North-West Frontier Province (NWFP), where they are the ethnic majority.

''Pakhtunkhwa'' (and the other transliteration variants) is derived from ''Pakhtun'' and ''khwa'', the former refers to the ethnic group and the latter literally means "heart".{{refn|group=eg|For instance, the sayings: "khwa ta me kena" means ‘set closer to my heart’; "khwa ta me na kegee" means ‘my heart does not want to eat’; and "khwa de bada ma sha" means ‘be happy in your heart’; "khwa la me rasha" means ‘come to my heart’.}} Metaphorically, it is used to indicate "near the Pakhtuns (Pashtuns)". Nationalist Pashtuns claim ''Pakhtunkhwa'' is an old name of the area inhabited by Pashtuns. But in fact Pashtun leader [[Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan]] (Bacha Khan) proposed this name as alternative to ''Pakhtunistan'' to military dictator [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]] in 1978, when the latter refused to accept the demand from the former to rename the NWFP as Pashtunistan. The famous Greek historian [[Herodotus]] had recorded it as ''Paktia'', but Pashtun poets from the time of Shahabuddin Muhammad Ghori down to the present age, have been mentioning it as Pakhtunkhwa.

The earliest available historical evidence is Akhund Darweza's (died 1638) ''Makhzanul Islam'' (written between 1603 and 1612). A verse in this book reads: "''Pakhtunkhwa pa misal shpa wa, dai deewa wo pa andher ke.''" (Translation: Pakhtunkhwa was like a night and he [Pir Baba Syed Ali Termezi] was like a candle).

Similarly, the often-quoted two lines of a poem by [[Ahmad Shah Abdali]] (1723–1773), the Founding Father of Afghan state, mention Pakhtunkhwa as the land of the Pashtuns:

{{blockquote|''Da Dehli takht herawoma che rayad kram''
''Zama da khpale Pakhtunkhwa da ghro saroona''}}
:Translation: ''I forget my [[Delhi]] throne when I recall the mountain peaks of my own Pakhtunkhwa''.

After him, Pashtun poets and writers have frequently used this name for the area which was later named as North-West Frontier Province by the British after they occupied and [[Durand Line|separated it from today's Afghanistan]] dividing the Pashtuns into four divisions. The word Pakhtunkhwa was also used in the modern poetry by contemporary poets like Qalandar Momand (1930–2003) long before it was suggested as the nomenclature for the NWFP.

Dr. A. H. Dani, a well known historian and archaeologist, presently the Director of the Islamabad-based Center for the Study of the Civilizations of Central Asia, told ''[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]'' that ''[[Pakhtunistan]]'' is a political name but ''Pakhtunkhwa'' is not. "Culturally there is no doubt that the land was called ''Pakhtunkhwa'' in [[Pashto]] literature since the 15th century (we have a trace of literature since that time only). The term has been applied for both tribal and settled areas, he added.

Besides Pashtus, there are many non-Pashtuns who have mentioned this name in their writings. A book by French orientalist [[James Darmesteter]] has the title, ''Da Pakhtunkhwa Bagh w Bahar'', a selection of Pashto poems with a valuable essay on Pashto language.

==Afghania==

The need for a change was explained by the man who named Pakistan in his "[[Pakistan Declaration|Now or Never]]" pamphlet, [[Choudhary Rahmat Ali]] Khan, as:
{{Quote| "'North-West Frontier Province' is semantically non-descript and socially wrongful. It is non-descript because it merely indicates their geographical situation as a province of old 'British India' [which no longer exists]. It is wrongful because it suppresses the social entity of these people. In fact, it suppresses that entity so completely that when composing the name 'Pakistan' for our homelands, I had to call the North-West Frontier Province the Afghan Province."&lt;ref&gt;Choudhary Rahmat Ali, 1947, ''Pakistan: the fatherland of the Pak nation,'' Cambridge, OCLC: 12241695&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Efforts to change the name==
{{See also|History of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa}}
For most of the history of the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP), there were efforts to change its name. As early as 1933, when ''Afghania'' was proposed, suggestions for new names came and went. Although [[#Other names|some of the names]] were ethnically neutral, most proposals emphazised the province's Pashtun ethnic identity. The renaming issue was an emotional one which often crossed party lines and not all supporters of a renaming agreed on the name Pakhtunkhwa (some preferred [[Pashtunistan]]/Pakhtunistan).

===20th-century efforts===
By the late 20th century, President [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]] agreed with [[Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan]] to change the name but he contended that the term Pashtunistan had become controversial and was being politicized by Afghanistan. Ghaffar Khan suggested Pakhtunkhwa, but Zia-ul-Haq asked Ghaffar Khan to suggest an alternative.&lt;ref name="khyber.org"&gt;[http://www.khyber.org/articles/2003/MatterofIdentity.shtml Matter of Identity by Dr. Sher Zaman Taizai]&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Pakhtunkhwa for NWFP was heard for the first time in 1988 in the Provincial Assembly when the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] (PPP) leadership wanted to move a resolution for changing the name. At that time, neither the Pashtun nationalist [[Awami National Party]] (ANP) nor any other party pressed any further for the adoption of the resolution as the then speaker of the Provincial Assembly, Masoud Kausar, ruled that the MPAs were free to call their province whatever name they liked.

The name was first used in the National Assembly in November 1990, when [[Muhammad Afzal Khan]] of [[Pakistan Democratic Alliance]] referred to the province as Pakhtunkhwa.

The name Pakhtunkhwa is very popular with the ordinary Pashtun people{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} and was approved by the democratically elected constitutional assembly of the province,&lt;ref name="ghazali.net"&gt;Abdus Sattar Ghazali. [http://www.ghazali.net/book1/Chapter10a/body_page_3.html "Pakhtoonkhwa: Renaming of the NWFP."] ''Islamic Pakistan: Illusions &amp; Reality.''&lt;/ref&gt; in 1997, by a 53 to 2 (45 abstentions) majority vote. Some 53 percent of the total lawmakers of the NWFP Assembly voted in favour of the Pakhtunkhwa name when a resolution was moved and passed by the provincial assembly in November 1997, it was tabled by [[Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao]] and supported by the ANP, [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F)]], Independent MPAs, and [[Jamiat-e-Islami]]. It was opposed by two MPAs, Salim Saifullah and Humayun Saifullah, both Pashtuns of the [[Pakistan Muslim League (J)]] faction, while the [[Pakistan Muslim League (N)]] with 37 members abstained.

However, the PML (N) parliamentary party of NWFP rejected the ANP demand but called for Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] to suggest another "non-controversial" name.&lt;ref name="ghazali.net"/&gt; PML (N) members noted that Sarhad was a good name for the province but, if a change was needed, then it should be named Khyber or Abasin.&lt;ref name="ghazali.net"/&gt; The NWFP chief minister, Sardar Mehtab Ahmed Khan, called for a referendum on the issue as a way of determining the name.&lt;ref name="ghazali.net"/&gt; These offers were rejected by the ANP leadership and the ANP withdrew from both the federal and provincial governments&lt;ref name="ghazali.net"/&gt;

===21st-century efforts===
The lack of support for a name change by the PML (N) was defended as opposition to the nationalistic politics being pursued by the ANP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2008\11\05\story_5-11-2008_pg7_45 "ANP asks opponents not to raise Pakhtunkhwa issue."] 5 November 2008. Retrieved 15 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2008, to accommodate a demand by the people of NWFP who voted for the ANP, the PPP proposed that the name of the North-West Frontier Province be changed to Pakhtunkhwa,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/pakistan/2032986/Pakistan-renames-North-West-Frontier-Province-to-end-'colonial-anachronism'.html Pakistan renames North West Frontier Province to end 'colonial anachronism' ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Dawn News]] - [http://www.dawn.com/2008/05/25/top1.htm PPP out to tame presidency, empower parliament]&lt;/ref&gt; however the [[Pakistan Muslim League (N)|Muslim League Nawaz]] which had considerable support in the [[Hindko]]-speaking [[Hazara, Pakistan|Hazara]] region of the province announced it might oppose the name change because of it "being on ethnic grounds" because of opposition by its provincial leadership, yet the party fails to explain the fact that the names of the other three provinces (Punjab, Sindh and Baluchistan) represent the ethnic identity of their majority populace, despite how they camouflage that fact with their version of the history of those provinces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenews.com.pk/print1.asp?id=116938 PML-N may oppose NWFP renaming as Pakhtunkhwa - The News]&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''Pakhtunkhwa'' was mentioned for the first time in the United Nation's General Assembly by Pakistani President Asif Zardari on 26 September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Riaz Khan. [http://www.thenews.com.pk/daily_detail.asp?id=138240 "ANP jubilant as Pakhtunkhwa echoes in UNGA."] 27 September 2008. Retrieved 29 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renaming and the renaming controversy==
{{anchor|Renaming and the renaming controversy}}

In early 2010, the process of renaming proceeded and the [[Pakistani Senate]] confirmed the name change to ''Khyber Pakhtunkhwa'' in the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|18th amendment]] to the [[Constitution of Pakistan]] with a unanimous 90 votes on 15 April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=123455&amp;sectionid=351020401 "Pakistan Senate amends constitution."] Press TV. 15 Apr 2010. Retrieved 15 Apr 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/07-senate-begins-voting-on-18th-amendment-ha-02|title=NWFP officially renamed as Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa |date=15 April 2010 |publisher=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn.com]]|accessdate=15 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Hazara residents said that the new name should be '''Hazara-Pakhtunkhwa''', and others said the name should not be changed since the people were accustomed to North-West Frontier Province.&lt;ref name="Brulliard"/&gt;

Arif Nizami, former editor of ''[[The Nation (Pakistani newspaper)|The Nation]]'', said, "This has actually opened a Pandora's box, because of Pakistan's very tenuous polity. Now, on one side, there are identity issues and ethnic issues and provincial autonomy issues. The other side is religious issues and terrorism. It's a very explosive situation."&lt;ref name="Brulliard"&gt;Karin Brulliard.

The '''orthometric height''' of a point is the distance H along a plumb line from the point to a reference height.&lt;ref&gt;Paul R. Wolf and Charles D. Ghilani, Elementary Surveying, 11th ed. p. 581&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hofmann-Wellenhof and Moritz, Physical Geodesy p.47, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;  When the reference height is a [[geoid]] model, orthometric height is for practical purposes "height above [[sea level]]".

In the US, the current [[NAVD88]] datum is tied to a defined [[elevation]] at one point rather than to any location's exact mean sea level. Orthometric heights are usually used in the US for engineering work, although  [[dynamic height]] may be chosen for large-scale hydrological purposes. Heights for measured points are shown on National Geodetic Survey data sheets,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ngs.noaa.gov&lt;/ref&gt; data that was gathered over many decades by precise [[spirit leveling]] over thousands of miles. 

Alternatives to orthometric height include [[dynamic height]] and [[normal height]], and various countries may choose to operate with those definitions instead of orthometric.  They may also adopt slightly different but similar definitions for their reference surface.

Since gravity is not constant over large areas the orthometric height of a level surface other than the reference surface is not constant, and orthometric heights need to be corrected for that effect. For example, gravity is 0.1% stronger in the northern United States than in the southern, so a level surface that has an orthometric height of 1000 meters in Montana will be 1001 meters high in Texas.

Practical applications must use a model rather than measurements to calculate the change in gravitational potential versus depth in the earth, since the geoid is below most of the land surface (e.g., the Helmert Orthometric heights &lt;ref&gt;Hofmann-Wellenhof and Moritz, Physical Geodesy p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; of [[NAVD88]]).

GPS measurements give [[ECEF|earth-centered coordinates]], usually displayed as height above the [[reference ellipsoid]], which cannot be related accurately to orthometric height above the geoid without accurate gravity data for that location.  In the US, NGS has undertaken the GRAV-D ten-year program to obtain such data with a goal of releasing a new definition in 2022.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/GRAV-D/&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the withdrawal of the British from the region in the late 1960s, Bahrain declared independence in 1971. Formerly a state, Bahrain was declared a "Kingdom" in 2002. Since early 2011, the country has experienced sustained protests and unrest inspired by the regional Arab Spring, particularly by the majority Shia population.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1728">The permanent adjustments of [[theodolite]]s are made to establish fixed relationship between the instrument's fundamental lines. The fundamental lines or axis of a [[theodolite|transit theodolite]] include the following:-
* [[Vertical axis]]
* Axis of plate levels
* Axis of [[telescope]]
* Line of collimation
* [[Horizontal axis]]
* Axis of altitude bubble and the vernier should read zero.
These adjustments once made last for a long time. These are important for accuracy of observations taken from the instrument. The permanent adjustments in case of transit theodolite are:-
* '''Horizontal axis adjustment'''.
The horizontal axis must be [[perpendicular]] to the vertical axis.
* '''Vertical circle index adjustment'''.
The vertical circle must read [[zero]] when the line of [[collimation]] is horizontal.
* '''Adjustment of altitude level'''.
The axis of altitude level must be [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the line of collimation.
* '''Collimation adjustment'''.
The line of collimation or line of sight should coincide with axis of the telescope.&lt;ref&gt;Surveying by Dr. B.C Punmia and Dr  Ashok Kumar Jain&lt;/ref&gt; The line of sight should also be perpendicular to the horizontal axis at its intersection with the vertical axis . Also, the [[optical axis]] , the axis of the objective slide, and the [[Sightline|line of sight]] should coincide.

'''Photoautotrophic tissue culture''' is defined as "[[micropropagation]] without sugar in the culture medium, in which the growth or accumulation of carbohydrates of cultures is dependent fully upon [[photosynthesis]] and inorganic nutrient uptake".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kozai|first=Toyoki|date=1991|title=Photoautotrophic Micropropagation|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02632127|journal=In Vitro Cellular &amp; Developmental Biology|doi=10.1007/BF02632127|pmid=|access-date=2016-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are multiple advantages to using this form of propagation, because this system actively encourages plant growth.  Namely, there are lower contamination rates due to the lack of sugar in the [[Growth medium|growing medium]], and more catering to plants that aren't able to be successfully multiplied by conventional means.  Many plants have trouble being propagated to due physiological or morphological inhibitions that make root formation difficult from cuttings.  And after the plantlet develops in vitro, then the ex-planting process can often be very stressful and result in plant death, which isn't a problem for pre-acclimated plantlets grown via photoautotrophic tissue culture (In this context, pre-acclimated refers to plantlets that have developed a cuticle and have been cultivated in an open air system as opposed to the closed system seen in typical operations).

== History and Development of Photoautotrophic tissue culture ==
A [[Light-dependent reactions|light-dependent reaction]] was observed in that a decrease in the available [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] was found after the light switch in sealed containers used in conventional tissue culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xiao|first=Yulan|last2=Niu|first2=Genhua|last3=Kozai|first3=Toyoki|date=2010-10-23|title=Development and application of photoautotrophic micropropagation plant system|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11240-010-9863-9|journal=Plant Cell, Tissue and Organ Culture (PCTOC)|language=en|volume=105|issue=2|pages=149–158|doi=10.1007/s11240-010-9863-9|issn=0167-6857}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the idea that plants, even in vitro, are capable of actively producing sugars via [[photosynthesis]] and this idea was quickly tested and validated using potato and strawberry in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=和宏|first=富士原|last2=豊樹|first2=古在|last3=一郎|first3=渡部|date=1987-01-01|title=植物組織培養器内環境の基礎的研究|url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/agrmet1943/43/1/43_1_21/_article/-char/ja/|journal=農業気象|volume=43|issue=1|pages=21–30|doi=10.2480/agrmet.43.21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pros and Cons of Photoautotrophic tissue culture ===
Major limitations inhibit the widespread adoption of this methodology.  Namely, there is a more stringent environmental maintenance that needs to be practiced.  Proper ventilation, temperature regulation, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration, and avoiding contamination are some of the hardest hurdles to overcome if resources are limiting.  Generally speaking, temperature and light are already going to be standards of control practiced in micropropagation.  However, ventilation and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration become a challenge, especially while trying to maintain sterile conditions (even though if there is no sugar in the growing medium, aseptic technique is still an essential practice that is required to avoid contamination).

=== Current use of the Technology ===
As of 2016 a number of genera have been found to be well-suited to this form of micro propagation.  Many researchers have adopted aspects of this type of propagation for certain projects by integrating ventilated lids or altering light intensity and sugar content in media, but only select few genera have been fully employed in a micro propagation project using this technology.

=== Use of Gas-Permeable Membrane Discs and Forced Ventilation ===
By using permeable discs as lids, air diffusion within the culture vessel can be improved.  This will in turn allow for increased carbon dioxide concentrations during 'day' periods and less water vapor in the container which encourages [[transpiration]].  These combined features have an overall effect of enhancing photosynthesis, increasing growth rate, and shortening production time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paek|first=Cui  Y.-Y.

Using forced ventilation tubules within the culture vessels was developed after the idea of using the discs, as a way to ensure that uniform content of water vappor and carbon dioxide is within each individual container.  This ensures uniform growth habit and less fringe effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Sandra B.|last2=Heo|first2=Jeongwook|last3=Kubota|first3=Chieri|last4=Kozai|first4=Toyoki|date=2001-01-01|title=A Forced Ventilation Micropropagation System for Photoautotrophic Production of Sweetpotato Plug Plantlets in a Scaled-up Culture Vessel: II.

'''Pico de Orizaba''', also known as '''{{lang|nah|Citlaltépetl|italic=no}}''' (from [[Nahuan languages|Nahuatl]] {{lang|nah|citlal(in)}} = star, and {{lang|nah|tepētl}} = mountain), is a [[stratovolcano]], the highest [[mountain]] in [[Mexico]] and the [[Table of the highest major summits of North America|third highest]] in [[North America]], after [[Denali]] of [[Alaska]] in the [[United States]] and [[Mount Logan]] of [[Canada]].  It rises {{convert|5636|m}} above sea level in the eastern end of the [[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt]], on the border between the states of [[Veracruz]] and [[Puebla]]. The volcano is currently [[dormant volcano|dormant]] but not [[extinct volcano|extinct]], with the last eruption taking place during the 19th century. It is the second most [[topographic prominence|prominent]] [[volcanic Seven Summits|volcanic peak]] in the world after Africa's [[Mount Kilimanjaro]].

==Toponymy==

Pico de Orizaba overlooks the valley and city of [[Orizaba]], from which it gets its name. The name Citlaltépetl is not used by Nahuatl speakers of the Orizaba area, who instead call it ''Istaktepetl'' (''Iztactépetl'' in the traditional orthography for [[Classical Nahuatl]]), or 'White Mountain'.

Citlaltépetl comes from the Náhuatl ''citlalli'' (star) and tepētl (mountain) and thus means "Star Mountain". This name is thought to be based on the fact that the snow-covered peak can be seen year round for hundreds of kilometers throughout the region.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} During the colonial era, the volcano was also known as Cerro de San Andrés due to the nearby settlement of San Andrés Chalchicomula at its base.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

A third name, Poyauhtecatl, which means "the one that colors or illuminates", has also been recorded. This name was given by the Tlaxcaltecs in memory of their lost country.&lt;ref&gt;Map of Cuauhtinchan 2 Vol 2. Keiko Yoneda. p 239&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topography==

The peak of Citlaltépetl rises dramatically to an elevation of {{convert|5636|m|abbr=on}} above sea level; it has a [[topographic prominence]] of {{convert|4922|m|abbr=on}}. Regionally dominant, Pico de Orizaba is the highest peak in Mexico and the highest volcano in North America; it is also the third highest peak in North America after [[Denali]] and [[Mount Logan]]. Orizaba is ranked [[List of peaks by prominence|7th]] in the world in [[topographic prominence]].  It is the second most prominent [[Volcanic Seven Summits|volcanic peak]] in the world after Africa's [[Mount Kilimanjaro]], and the volcano is also ranked 16th in the world for [[topographic isolation]]. About {{convert|110|km|abbr=on}} to the west of the port of [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]], its peak is visible to ships approaching the port in the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and at dawn rays of sunlight strike the Pico while Veracruz still lies in shadow.

The topography of Pico de Orizaba is [[Asymmetry|asymmetrical]] from the center of the crater; the eastern face is the steepest side of the volcano and the northwestern face the most gradual side. The gradual slopes of the northwestern face of the volcano allows for the presence of large glaciers and is the most traveled route to take for hikers traveling to the summit.

==Glaciers==
[[File:Citlaltépetl Glaciers.svg|thumb|right|The main peaks and glaciers of Pico de Orizaba]]
Pico de Orizaba is one of only three volcanoes in México that continue to support glaciers and is home to the largest glacier in Mexico, [[Gran Glaciar Norte]]. Orizaba has nine known glaciers: Gran Glaciar Norte, Lengua del Chichimeco, Jamapa, Toro, Glaciar de la Barba, Noroccidental, Occidental, Suroccidental, and Oriental. The [[Snow line|equilibrium line altitude]] (ELA) is not known for Orizaba. Snow on the south and southeast sides of the volcano melts quickly because of solar radiation, but lower temperatures on the northwest and north sides allow for glaciers. The insolation angle and wind redeposition on the northwest and north sides allow for constant accumulation of snow providing a source for the [[Glacier#Types of glaciers|outlet glaciers]]. On the north side of Orizaba, the Gran Glaciar Norte fills the elongated highland basin and is the source for seven outlet glaciers. The main glacier extends {{convert|3.5|km|abbr=on}} north of the crater rim, has a surface area of about {{convert|9.08|km2|abbr=on}} descending from {{convert|5650|m|abbr=on}} to about {{convert|5000|m|abbr=on}}. It has a slightly irregular and stepped profile that is caused in part by the configuration of the bedrock. Most [[crevasses]] show an ice thickness of approximately {{convert|50|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="orizaba_glaciers"&gt;

[[File:Pico de Orizaba 1 Zoom.jpg|thumb|left|Pico de Orizaba looking south from atop [[Cofre de Perote]]]]Below the {{convert|5000|m|ft|abbr=on}} in elevation on the north side of the volcano, the outlet glaciers Lengua del Chichimeco and Jamapa extend north and northwest another {{convert|1.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} and {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}}, respectively. The terminal lobe of Lengua del Chichimeco at {{convert|4740|m|ft|abbr=on}}, having a gradient of only {{convert|140|m/km|abbr=on}}, is a low, broad ice fan that has a convex-upward profile, a front typical of almost all Mexican glaciers. The most distinct glacier is Glaciar de Jamapa, which leaves Gran Glaciar Norte at about {{convert|4975|m|ft|abbr=on}} and, after {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} with a gradient of {{convert|145|m/km|abbr=on}}, divides into two small tongues that end at {{convert|4650|m|ft|abbr=on}} and {{convert|4640|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Both tongues terminate in broad convex-upward ice fans thinning along their edges. The retreat of these tongues prior to 1994 produced much erosion downstream and buried their edges by ablation rock debris.&lt;ref name="orizaba_glaciers" /&gt;

The west side of Gran Glaciar Norte generates five outlet glaciers. From north to south, the first two, Glaciar del Toro and Glaciar dela Barba, are hanging cliff or icefall glaciers, reaching the tops of giant lava steps at {{convert|4930|m|ft|abbr=on}} and {{convert|5090|m|ft|abbr=on}}, respectively. Then they then descend {{convert|200|to|300|m|ft|abbr=on}} farther down into the heads of stream valleys as huge ice blocks but are not regenerated there. About {{convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on}}, Glaciar Noroccidental, a small outlet glacier {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, drains away from the side of Gran Glaciar Norte at about {{convert|5100|m|ft|abbr=on}} and draws down the ice surface a few tens of meters over a distance of {{convert|500|m|ft|abbr=on}}, descending to {{convert|4920|m|ft|abbr=on}} with a gradient of {{convert|255|m/km|abbr=on}}. Another {{convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on}} still farther south, Glaciar Occidental breaks away from Gran Glaciar Norte west of the summit crater at about {{convert|5175|m|ft|abbr=on}} as a steep, {{convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on}} long glacier having a gradient of {{convert|270|m/km|abbr=on}} that ends at {{convert|4930|m|ft|abbr=on}}. From the southwest corner of the mountain, another outlet glacier, Glaciar Suroccidental, {{convert|1.6|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, flows from Gran Glaciar Norte at {{convert|5250|m|ft|abbr=on}} with a gradient of {{convert|200|m/km|abbr=on}}, which also ends at {{convert|4930|m|ft|abbr=on}} in a long smooth surface.&lt;ref name="orizaba_glaciers" /&gt;

East of the summit cone, a separate steep niche glacier, Glaciar Oriental, {{convert|1.2|km|abbr=on}} long and having a gradient of {{convert|440|m/km|abbr=on}}, flows down the mountainside from about {{convert|5600|to|5070|m|ft|abbr=on}}; it contains many crevasses and seracs and is the most difficult glacier to climb. Glacier Oriental had a surface area of about {{convert|420000|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} in 1958, which makes the total area of glaciers and firn field on Citlaltépetl about {{convert|9.5|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. No earlier historical record of glacier tongue activity (advance or recession) is known for Citlaltépetl’s glaciers. Although the Gran Glaciar Norte ice cap is covered with snow, it is possible to see the seven outlet glaciers on the irregular west margin of the ice cap, especially Glaciar de Jamapa and Glaciar Occidental.&lt;ref name="orizaba_glaciers" /&gt;

[[File:Citlaltepetll.jpg|thumb|right|Southeast of Citlaltépetl]]
[[File:Citlalepetl2.JPG|thumb|right|Northwest of Citlaltépetl]]

The climate of Pico de Orizaba, like the [[Sierra Madre Oriental]], varies greatly due to the change of elevation and [[prevailing winds]]. Due to the latitude and the extreme rugged terrain the volcano experiences many [[microclimates]]. Vegetation varies from tropical at the lower elevations on the eastern face to alpine forests in the higher elevations.

Large amounts of precipitation fall on the eastern face of the volcano due to [[adiabatic cooling]] and condensation from the [[trade winds]] that bring moisture off the Gulf of Mexico. The eastern face is frequently covered by fog and low cloud cover. The climate of the eastern face varies from tropical [[Tropical rainforest climate|(Af)]] at the lower elevations to subtropical highland [[Oceanic climate#Subtropical highland variety (Cwb)|(Cwb)]] at the higher elevations, with mild variation in temperatures and an average annual rainfall of {{convert|1600|mm|in|abbr=on}}.

Subtropical climates are found between {{convert|2200|–|3200|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level with a regular rainfall all year long. Autumn and winter come with frequent freezes and light snow, but the snow on the south and southeast sides melt quickly due to solar radiation. The northern face is dominated by subtropical highland [[Oceanic climate#Subtropical highland variety (Cwb)|(Cwb)]]. The southern face mostly experiences humid subtropical climate [[Humid subtropical climate|Cfa]] which experiences the highest annual temperatures in the month of April.

Due to [[katabatic wind]]s the western side is dominated by steppe [[Semi-arid climate|(BSk)]] creating a rain shadow below {{convert|2600|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level. Although there are some areas on the western side that experience [[Humid subtropical climate|(Cfa)]] most of the area is semi-dry with temperate to warm temperatures and an annual precipitation average of {{convert|550|mm|in|abbr=on}}. Vegetation here is grass and shrubs with few alpine species.

Between {{convert|3200|–|4300|m|ft|abbr=on}} where temperatures usually are between {{convert|2|to|5|C|F}}, continental subarctic climate [[Subarctic climate|(Dfc)]] predominates. Over {{convert|4300|m|ft|abbr=on}} with an annual average low of {{convert|-2|C|F}}, [[alpine tundra]] [[Polar climate|(ET)]] prevails to the summit; heavy snowfalls and blizzards are common throughout the year. Snow on the south and southeast melts due to solar radiation, but continually remains on the north and northwestern faces. Extreme cold dominates a surface area of approximately {{convert|31|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.

==Geology==
[[File:Pico de Orizaba caldera.jpg|thumb|Pico de Orizaba [[caldera]]]]
Pico de Orizaba evolved in three stages, the most recent initiated about 16,000 years ago during the late [[Pleistocene]] and [[Holocene]]. Citlaltépetl consists of three superimposed stratovolcanoes and dome intrusions which are: Torrecillas (650–250 [[Year#Symbol|ka]]), Espolón de Oro (210– 16 ka), and Citlaltépetl (16 ka to present). The volcano was formed by thick [[Andesite|andesitic]] and [[Dacite|dacitic]] lavas that followed repetitive explosive eruptions and [[Effusive eruption|lava effusions]] which created the iconic cone structure. The volcano is currently [[dormant volcano|dormant]] but not [[extinct volcano|extinct]]. The latest eruption of the volcano occurred in 1846 with a magnitude of  [[VEI]] 2. Previous eruptions occurred in: 1687, 1613, 1589–1569, 1566, 1555–1545,1539–1533, 1351, 1260, 1187, 1175, 1157, 220 AD, 140 AD, 90 AD, 40 AD, ~780 BC, ~1500 BC, ~2110 BC, ~2300, ~2500, ~2780, ~4690, ~6220, ~6710, ~7030, and ~7530.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volcano.si.edu/world/volcano.cfm?vnum=1401-10=&amp;volpage=erupt|last=Simkin |first=T, Siebert L|title=Pico de Orizaba|work=Global Volcanism Program|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most violent eruption in the volcano's history is thought to have occurred around 6710 BC reaching a magnitude of [[VEI]] 5 characterized by [[lava dome]] extrusion and [[pyroclastic flow]].

The volcano's crater is elliptical with a [[ellipse|transverse diameter]] measuring {{convert|478|m|ft|abbr=on}} and a [[ellipse|conjugate diameter]] measuring {{convert|410|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The crater has an estimated {{convert|154,830|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} with a maximum depth of {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Pico de Orizaba is constantly covered by an [[Glacier#Types of glaciers|ice cap]] consisting of several glaciers. An outlet glacier, known as Jamapa Glacier is located on the northeastern side of the peak; it has been a powerful force in shaping the volcano. The Jamapa Glacier is responsible for a significant portion of the [[Geomorphology|geomorphologic]] evolution of the region surrounding the volcano.&lt;ref name="orizaba_stats"&gt;{{cite journal

==Geography==
[[File:15-07-14-Landschaft-zwischen-Mexico-und-Golfküste-RalfR-WMA 0456.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Pico de Orizaba]]
[[File:Pico de Orizaba, Mexico.JPG|thumb|Shadows accentuate several features of Pico de Orizaba in this astronaut photograph.]]
Pico de Orizaba is located at 19°1′48″N 97°16′12″W at a distance of {{convert|100|km|mi}} from the shores of the Gulf of Mexico. Orizaba is located {{convert|200|km|mi}} east of [[Mexico City]] lies on the border between the states of Veracruz and Puebla. The volcano is approximately {{convert|480|km|mi}} south of the [[Tropic of Cancer]]. Orizaba is found at the southeastern end of the [[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt]], a volcanic chain that runs from west to east across Central Mexico; it is the only historically active volcano in the area. A companion peak lying about six km to the southwest of Pico de Orizaba is the [[Sierra Negra]], at {{convert|4640|m|ft|0}}. This subsidiary peak is significantly lower than its massive neighbor, but is traversed by the highest road in North America passing over its summit.

Pico de Orizaba, like the [[Sierra Madre Oriental]], forms a barrier between the coastal plains of the Gulf of Mexico and the [[Mexican Plateau]]. The volcano blocks the moisture from the Gulf of Mexico from saturating central Mexico and influences the climates of both areas. Both the state of Veracruz and Puebla depend on Pico de Orizaba for supplying fresh water. The largest river originating on the volcano is the [[Jamapa River]].

==History==
[[File:Church and volcano by mexikids.jpg|thumb|Hacienda de las Flores near Citlaltépetl]]
[[File:Pico de Orizaba glacier ascent.jpg|thumb|right|Climber ascending Jamapa Glacier.]]

Pico de Orizaba was important in pre-Hispanic cultures, such as those of the Nahuatl-speaking [[Aztec]]s and the [[Totonac]]s. The volcano is part of many native mythologies.

During the [[Spanish Conquest]] of Mexico, [[Hernán Cortés]] passed through the foothills of Pico de Orizaba; the volcano and the surrounding mountains made his journey to [[Tenochtitlan]] more difficult and delayed him for many days. During the 1600s, the Spanish Crown financed several roads to be built that would circumvent Citlaltépetl. One of the roads was routed south of the volcano through the cities of Orizaba and Fortín de las Flores, which became the main trade route between Mexico City and Veracruz on the Gulf Coast. A short road was later built by [[Jesuits]] to establish settlements at the base of Pico de Orizaba. The Spanish used the volcano as a landmark to guide themselves to the port of Veracruz. Many battles were fought near this volcano throughout Mexico's struggle for independence.

In 1839, [[Henri Guillaume Galeotti|Henri Galeotti]] was the first European to explore the volcano, but did not hike to the summit. During the American occupation of Mexico in 1848, two American soldiers, F. Maynard and [[William F. Raynolds]], were the first known hikers to reach the summit of Pico de Orizaba.&lt;ref name=ortenburger&gt;{{Cite book| last = Ortenburger | first = Leigh N|author2=Reynold G.

During the mid-19th century Citlaltépetl was explored by many scientists, including the German botanist, [[Hugo Fink]] who was the first to record the numerous species of flora found on the volcano. In 1873, [[Martin Tritschler]] raised the Mexican flag at the summit.

On December 16, 1936, President [[Lázaro Cárdenas]], in an effort to protect the natural beauty of Pico de Orizaba, created a national park with an area of {{convert|19750|ha|acre}} which included the volcano with the surrounding area and the settlements of Tlachichuca, Ciudad Serdán, La Perla, Mariano Escobedo, and Calcahualco. The federal decree became federal law on January 4, 1937.

Pico de Orizaba attracts a large number of international climbers every year. There are multiple routes for approaching and climbing the volcano, and many people attempt it. Most people climb the mountain during the period from October to March when the weather is most ideal;{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} temperatures do not vary much month to month due to being in the tropics and April through September are rainy months in the region. The most frequented route begins from the base camp Piedra Grande Hut ("refugio") via the Jamapa Glacier, located at an elevation of {{convert|4270|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level.

Another option as a starting point is high camp located at the base of the glacier about {{convert|4900|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level. For a more technical challenge for the experienced climber, there is a technical ice climb called the Serpents Head which involves 10 pitches of grade 3 ice. Additionally, the southern side offers another challenging option; although the trail is shorter, it is also steeper and more difficult. No glaciers are found on the southern side. The final ascent to the summit is via a normally straightforward and crevasse-free glacier route. The caldera can be circumnavigated with relative ease, although at one point this requires a short, exposed traverse of steep rock and ice above the Glacier Este.

The '''Sea Level Datum of 1929''' was the vertical control [[datum (geodesy)|datum]] established for vertical control [[surveying]] in the [[United States|United States of America]] by the General Adjustment of 1929.  The datum was used to measure [[elevation]] ([[altitude]]) above, and [[depression (geology)|depression]] ([[:wikt:depth|depth]]) below, [[mean sea level]] (MSL).

Mean sea level was measured at 26 tide gauges: 21 in the United States and 5 in [[Canada]].  The datum was defined by the observed heights of mean sea level at the 26 tide gauges and by the set of elevations of all bench marks resulting from the adjustment.  The adjustment required a total of 66,315 miles (106,724&amp;nbsp;km) of leveling with 246 closed circuits and 25 circuits at sea level.

Since the Sea Level Datum of 1929 was a hybrid model, it was not a pure model of [[mean sea level]], the [[geoid]], or any other [[equipotential]] surface.  Therefore, it was renamed the '''National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929''' (NGVD 29) in 1973.  NGVD29 was superseded by the [[North American Vertical Datum of 1988]] ([[NAVD 88]]), based upon an equipotential definition and a readjustment, although many cities and [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] projects with established data continued to use the older datum.

'''Sibilan''', as depicted in ''[[Bayan Ko (TV series)]]'', is a fictional province where [[Lagros, Sibilan|Lagros]] are.

==Premise==
{{Main|Bayan Ko (TV series)}}
Lagros' newly elected mayor, Joseph Santiago, discovers that a bunch of wayward employees have turned the municipal hall into a boarding house and, worse, have been making under the table deals. His efforts to fight corruption are blocked by a political dynasty led by Governor Antonio Rubio and Congressman Anton Rubio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/video/shows/bayanko |title=Bayan Ko &amp;#124; GMA News TV Shows &amp;#124; Videos and Episodes &amp;#124; GMA News Online |publisher=Gmanetwork.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Belgium, Botrange, Communication tower.JPG|left|125px|thumb|Communication tower on the Signal de Botrange]]
'''Signal de Botrange''' (German [outdated] ''Baldringen'', Latin ''Sicco Campo'') is the highest point in [[Belgium]], located in the ''[[High Fens]]'' (''Hautes Fagnes'' in [[French language|French]], ''Hoge Venen'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], ''Hohes Venn'' in [[German language|German]]), at {{Convert|694|m|ft|0}}. It is the top of a broad [[plateau]] and a road crosses the summit, passing an adjacent [[café]]. 

For several decades a meteorological station was installed at signal Botrange. Since 1999, it was replaced by an automatic station of the Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium installed on Mount Rigi (scientific station of the High Fens - University of Liege), which is between the signal and the house [[Baraque Michel]].

Signal de Botrange experiences stronger winds than the centre of Belgium. Average and extreme temperatures are usually lower than at any other place in Belgium: the minimum temperature recorded (-25.6&amp;nbsp;°C) does not, however, exceed the absolute record (-30.1&amp;nbsp;°C), observed in the valley of the Lomme, at [[Rochefort, Belgium|Rochefort]] during a temperature inversion. In winter, for three months, on average, the average temperature remains below 0&amp;nbsp;°C.

Rainfall is much greater than most of the rest of the country, at an annual average of 1450&amp;nbsp;mm compared with 800&amp;nbsp;mm in [[Uccle]]. Rainfall is also much more common: there are over 200 days of precipitation per year (against just over 170 in Uccle). Maximum temperatures in summer rarely exceed 30&amp;nbsp;°C. The number of days of frost is over 130 days per year and the number of days of snowfall exceeds 35 days. The maximum thickness of snow was measured on 9 February 1953, at 115&amp;nbsp;cm of snow. Frost and early snowfall can occur in late September, but that is exceptional. Late snow may sometimes occur until mid-May.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

At the height of winter the site is used as the start of a number of [[cross-country skiing]] routes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ski-botrange.be/index.asp?l=en&amp;rub=carte Cross-country ski map of Botrange]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Towers and Transmitters Botrange ==
In 1923, the 6 metres [[Herman Baltia|Baltia]] tower was built on the summit to allow visitors to reach an altitude of 700 metres. A stone tower built in 1933/34 by François Fagnoul from [[Ovifat]] on the Botrange crowned a steel weather vane with the relieved name '' SICCO CAMPO '' until [[World War II]]. Meanwhile, the spire serves as transmitter of [[Radio Contact (Eupen)|Radio Contact]] and reaches a de facto height of 718 metres.

In November 2013, at the Signal de Botrange, a 50-m high tower with [[parabolic antenna]]s was agreed to provide data interchange by [[Microwave transmission]] between [[London Stock Exchange]] and [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]], because the data transmission via [[Communications satellite]] or [[fiber optic]] involves a small delay, which interferes the stock exchange trading. The data transfer takes place in [[Real-time data|real time]] via the intermediate station Botrange, which was set up directly next to the existing tower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://brf.be/nachrichten/regional/678187/ ''New Tower at Botrange'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''TARANIS''' ('''Tool for the Analysis of Radiation from [[lightning]] and [[Sprite (lightning)|Sprites]]''') is an [[Earth observation satellite|observation satellite]] of the French Space Agency ([[CNES]]) which will study the transient events produced the Earth's [[atmospheric layer]] between 10 and 100&amp;nbsp;km altitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://taranis.cnes.fr/en/TARANIS/index.htm|title=Taranis|website=taranis.cnes.fr|language=en|access-date=2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lefeuvre|first=Francois|last2=Blanc|first2=Elisabeth|last3=Pinçon|first3=Jean-Louis|last4=Roussel-Dupré|first4=Robert|last5=Lawrence|first5=David|last6=Sauvaud|first6=Jean-André|last7=Rauch|first7=Jean-Louis|last8=Feraudy|first8=Hervé de|last9=Lagoutte|first9=Dominique|date=2008-06-01|title=TARANIS—A Satellite Project Dedicated to the Physics of TLEs and TGFs|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11214-008-9414-4|journal=Space Science Reviews|language=en|volume=137|issue=1-4|pages=301–315|doi=10.1007/s11214-008-9414-4|issn=0038-6308}}&lt;/ref&gt; TARANIS will be launched in 2019 and placed in a [[Sun-synchronous orbit|sun-synchronous]] orbit at an altitude of 700&amp;nbsp;km, for a mission duration of at least two years.

== Science objectives ==
The satellite is intended to collect data on transient events that are observed during thunderstorms.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://taranis.cnes.fr/en/TARANIS/GP_mission.htm|title=Mission|website=taranis.cnes.fr|language=en|access-date=2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; These events are happening between the medium and upper [[atmosphere]], the [[ionosphere]] and the [[magnetosphere]] ([[Van Allen radiation belt|radiation belts]]). The resulting phenomena in visible light are called [[Transient luminous event|Transient Luminous Events]] (TLE) and take a great diversity of forms (elves, halos, blue jets) varying in color, shape and duration. Thunderstorms are also known to generate  gamma and X-ray emissions called [[Terrestrial gamma-ray flash|Terrestrial Gamma-Ray Flashes]] (TGF), generated by intense electric fields in which the electrons are accelerated to the point of reaching an energy up to 30 MeV. The link between TLEs and TGFs is one of the scientific questions of the TARANIS mission.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Lightning-induced [[Electron precipitation|Electron Precipitations]] (LEP) will also be studied.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; All these events have associated electromagnetic wave emissions that will be investigated as well.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[Atmosphere-Space Interaction Monitor]] (ASIM) will operate as the same time as TARANIS and will provide complementary observations.

== Technical characteristics ==
The TARANIS micro-satellite has a mass of 152&amp;nbsp;kg, and uses the Myriade platform powered by solar panels providing 85 W. The amount of data transferred is planned to be 24 GB per day.

The '''transverse Mercator''' [[map projection]] is an adaptation of the standard [[Mercator projection]]. The transverse version is widely used in national and international mapping systems around the world, including the [[Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system|UTM]]. When paired with a suitable [[geodetic datum]], the transverse Mercator delivers high accuracy in zones less than a few degrees in east-west extent.

==Standard and transverse aspects==
The transverse Mercator projection is the [[map projection#Aspect_of_the_projection|transverse aspect]] of the standard (or ''Normal'') Mercator projection. They share the same underlying mathematical construction and consequently the transverse Mercator inherits many traits from the normal Mercator:
* Both [[map projection|projections]] are [[map projection#Cylindrical|cylindrical]]: for the Normal Mercator, the axis of the cylinder coincides with the polar axis and the line of tangency with the equator. For the transverse Mercator, the axis of the cylinder lies in the equatorial plane, and the line of tangency is any chosen meridian, thereby designated the ''[[Meridian (geography)|central meridian]]''.
* Both projections may be modified to secant forms, which means the scale has been reduced so that the cylinder slices through the model globe.
* Both exist in spherical and [[Figure of the Earth|ellipsoidal]] versions.
* Both projections are [[conformal map|conformal]], so that the [[Scale (map)|point scale]] is independent of direction and ''local'' shapes are well preserved;
* Both projections have constant scale on the line of tangency (the equator for the normal Mercator and the central meridian for the transverse).

Since the central meridian of the transverse Mercator can be chosen at will, it may be used to construct highly accurate maps (of narrow width) anywhere on the globe. The secant, ellipsoidal form of the transverse Mercator is the most widely applied of all projections for accurate large-scale maps.

==Spherical transverse Mercator==
In constructing a map on any projection, a [[Spherical Earth|sphere]] is normally chosen to model the Earth when the extent of the mapped region exceeds a few hundred kilometers in length in both dimensions. For maps of smaller regions, an [[Figure of the Earth|ellipsoidal model]] must be chosen if greater accuracy is required; see next section. The spherical form of the transverse Mercator projection was one of the seven new projections presented, in 1772, by [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]].&lt;ref name=lambert &gt;Lambert, Johann Heinrich. 1772.

==Ellipsoidal transverse Mercator==
The ellipsoidal form of the transverse Mercator projection was developed by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] in 1825&lt;ref name=gauss1825&gt;Gauss, Karl Friedrich, 1825. "Allgemeine Auflösung der Aufgabe: die Theile einer gegebnen Fläche auf einer andern gegebnen Fläche so abzubilden, daß die Abbildung dem Abgebildeten in den kleinsten Theilen ähnlich wird" Preisarbeit der Kopenhagener Akademie 1822.

[Reprinted, 1894, Ostwald’s Klassiker der Exakten Wissenschaften, no. 55: Leipzig, Wilhelm Engelmann, p. 57&amp;ndash;81, with editing by Albert Wangerin, pp. 97&amp;ndash;101. Also in Herausgegeben von der Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu Göttingen in Kommission bei Julius Springer in Berlin, 1929, v. 12, pp. 1&amp;ndash;9.]&lt;/ref&gt; and further analysed by [[Johann Heinrich Louis Krüger]] in 1912.&lt;ref name=kruger&gt;Krüger, L. (1912). ''[https://dx.doi.org/10.2312/GFZ.b103-krueger28 Konforme Abbildung des Erdellipsoids in der Ebene]''. Royal Prussian Geodetic Institute, New Series 52.&lt;/ref&gt; The projection is known by several names: Gauss Conformal or Gauss-Krüger in Europe; the transverse Mercator in the US; or Gauss–Krüger transverse Mercator generally. The projection is conformal with a constant scale on the central meridian. (There are other conformal generalisations of the transverse Mercator from the sphere to the ellipsoid but only Gauss-Krüger has a constant scale on the central meridian.) Throughout the twentieth century the Gauss–Krüger transverse Mercator was adopted, in one form or another, by many nations (and international bodies);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://eusoils.jrc.ec.europa.eu/Projects/Alpsis/Docs/ref_grid_sh_proc_draft.pdf | title = Short Proceedings of the 1st European Workshop on Reference Grids, Ispra, 27–29 October 2003 | publisher = [[European Environment Agency]] | date = 2004-06-14 | accessdate = 2009-08-27 | page = 6}} The EEA recommends the transverse Mercator for conformal pan-European mapping at scales larger than 1:500,000.&lt;/ref&gt; in addition it provides the basis for the [[Universal Transverse Mercator]] series of projections. The Gauss–Krüger projection is now the most widely used projection in accurate large-scale mapping.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

The projection, as developed by Gauss and Krüger, was expressed in terms of low order power series which were assumed to diverge in the east-west direction, exactly as in the spherical version. This was proved to be untrue by British cartographer E. H. Thompson, whose unpublished exact (closed form) version of the projection, reported by L. P. Lee in 1976,&lt;ref name="lee_exact"&gt;Lee, L.P. (1976). ''Conformal Projections Based on Elliptic Functions''. Supplement No. 1 to ''Canadian Cartographer'', Vol 13. (Designated as Monograph 16). Toronto: Department of Geography, York University. "A report of unpublished analytic formulae involving incomplete elliptic integrals obtained by E. H. Thompson in 1945".

This is the most striking difference between the spherical and ellipsoidal versions of the transverse Mercator projection: Gauss–Krüger gives a reasonable projection of the ''whole'' ellipsoid to the plane, although its principal application is to accurate large-scale mapping "close" to the central meridian.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

[[File:MercTranEll.png|center|thumb|350px|Ellipsoidal transverse Mercator: a finite projection.]]

===Features===
*Near the central meridian (Greenwich in the above example) the projection has low distortion and the shapes of Africa, western Europe, the British Isles, Greenland, and Antarctica compare favourably with a globe.
* The central regions of the transverse projections on sphere and ellipsoid are indistinguishable on the small-scale projections shown here.
*The meridians at 90° east and west of the chosen central meridian project to horizontal lines through the poles. The more distant hemisphere is projected above the north pole and below the south pole.
*The equator bisects Africa, crosses South America and then continues onto the complete outer boundary of the projection; the top and bottom edges and the right and left edges must be identified (i.e. they represent the same lines on the globe). (Indonesia is bisected.)
*Distortion increases towards the right and left boundaries of the projection but it does not increase to infinity. Note the Galapagos Islands where the 90° west meridian meets the equator at bottom left.
*The map is conformal. Lines intersecting at any specified angle on the ellipsoid project into lines intersecting at the same angle on the projection. In particular parallels and meridians intersect at 90°.
*The point scale factor is independent of direction at any point so that the shape of a ''small'' region is reasonably well preserved. The necessary condition is that the magnitude of scale factor must not vary too much over the region concerned. Note that while South America is distorted greatly the island of Ceylon is small enough to be reasonably shaped although it is far from the central meridian.
*The choice of central meridian greatly affects the appearance of the projection. If 90°W is chosen then the whole of the Americas is reasonable. If 145°E is chosen the Far East is good and Australia is oriented with north up.

In most applications the [[Gauss–Krüger coordinate system]] is applied to a narrow strip near the central meridians where the differences between the spherical and ellipsoidal versions are small, but nevertheless important in accurate mapping. Direct series for scale, convergence and distortion are functions of eccentricity and both latitude and longitude on the ellipsoid: inverse series are functions of [[Eccentricity (mathematics)#Ellipses|eccentricity]] and both ''x'' and ''y'' on the projection. In the secant version the lines of true scale on the projection are no longer parallel to central meridian; they curve slightly. The convergence angle between projected meridians and the ''x'' constant grid lines is no longer zero (except on the equator) so that a grid bearing must be corrected to obtain an azimuth from true north. The difference is small, but not negligible, particularly at high latitudes.

===Implementations of the Gauss–Krüger projection===
In his 1912&lt;ref name="kruger"/&gt; paper, Krüger presented two distinct solutions, distinguished here by the expansion parameter:
* '''Krüger&amp;ndash;''n''''' (paragraphs 5 to 8): Formulae for the direct projection, giving the coordinates ''x'' and ''y'', are fourth order expansions in terms of the third flattening, ''n'' (the ratio of the difference and sum of the major and minor axes of the ellipsoid). The coefficients are expressed in terms of latitude (''φ''), longitude (''λ''), major axis (''a'') and eccentricity (''e''). The inverse formulae for ''φ'' and ''λ'' are also fourth order expansions in ''n'' but with coefficients expressed in terms of ''x'', ''y'', ''a'' and ''e''.
* '''Krüger–''λ''''' (paragraphs 13 and 14): Formulae giving the projection coordinates ''x'' and ''y'' are expansions (of orders 5 and 4 respectively) in terms of the longitude ''λ'', expressed in radians: the coefficients are expressed in terms of ''φ'', ''a'' and ''e''. The inverse projection for ''φ'' and ''λ'' are sixth order expansions in terms of the ratio {{sfrac|''x''|''a''}}, with coefficients expressed in terms of ''y'', ''a'' and ''e''. (See [[Transverse Mercator: Redfearn series]].)

The Krüger–''λ'' series were the first to be implemented, possibly because they were much easier to evaluate on the hand calculators of the mid twentieth century.

Redfearn extended the series to eighth order and examined which terms were necessary to attain an accuracy of 1 mm (ground measurement). The [[Transverse Mercator: Redfearn series|Redfearn series]] are still the basis of the OSGB map projections.&lt;ref name=osgb /&gt;

*Many variants of the Redfearn series have been proposed but only those adopted by national cartographic agencies are of importance. For an example of modifications which do not have this status see [[Transverse Mercator: Bowring series]]). All such modifications have been eclipsed by the power of modern computers and the development of high order ''n''-series outlined below.  The precise Redfearn series, although of low order, cannot be disregarded as they are still enshrined in the quasi-legal definitions of OSGB and UTM etc.

===Exact Gauss–Krüger and accuracy of the truncated series===
An exact solution by E. H. Thompson is described by L. P. Lee.&lt;ref name=lee_exact /&gt; It is constructed in terms of elliptic functions (defined in chapters 19 and 22 of the NIST&lt;ref&gt;F. W.J. Olver, D.W. Lozier, R.F. Boisvert, and C.W. Clark, editors,2010, NIST Handbook of Mathematical Functions (Cambridge University Press), available online at URL http://dlmf.nist.gov.&lt;/ref&gt; handbook) which can be calculated to arbitrary accuracy using algebraic computing systems such as Maxima.&lt;ref&gt;Maxima, 2009, A computer algebra system, version 5.20.1, URL http://maxima.sf.net.&lt;/ref&gt; Such an implementation of the exact solution is described by Karney (2011).&lt;ref name=karney&gt;C. F. F. Karney (2011), ''[https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00190-011-0445-3 Transverse Mercator with an accuracy of a few nanometers]'', J. Geodesy 85(8), 475-485 (2011); preprint of paper and C++ implementation of algorithms are available at [https://geographiclib.sourceforge.io/tm.html tm.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact solution is a valuable tool in assessing the accuracy of the truncated ''n'' and λ series. For example, the original 1912 Krüger–''n'' series compares very favourably with the exact values: they differ by less than 0.31&amp;nbsp;μm within 1000&amp;nbsp;km of the central meridian and by less than 1&amp;nbsp;mm out to 6000&amp;nbsp;km. On the other hand, the difference of the Redfearn series used by Geotrans and the exact solution is less than 1&amp;nbsp;mm out to a longitude difference of 3 degrees, corresponding to a distance of 334&amp;nbsp;km from the central meridian at the equator but a mere 35&amp;nbsp;km at the northern limit of an UTM zone. Thus the Krüger–''n'' series are very much better than the Redfearn λ series.

The Redfearn series becomes much worse as the zone widens. Karney discusses Greenland as an instructive example. The long thin landmass is centred on 42W and, at its broadest point, is no more than 750&amp;nbsp;km from that meridian while the span in longitude reaches almost 50 degrees. Krüger–''n'' is accurate to within 1&amp;nbsp;mm but the Redfearn version of the Krüger–''λ'' series has a maximum error of 1&amp;nbsp;kilometre.

Karney's own 8th-order (in ''n'') series is accurate to 5&amp;nbsp;nm within 3900&amp;nbsp;km of the central meridian.

==Formulae for the spherical transverse Mercator==

===Spherical normal Mercator revisited===
[[File:Cylindrical Projection basics.svg|thumb|400px|center|The normal aspect of a tangent cylindrical projection of the sphere]]
The normal cylindrical projections are described in relation to a cylinder tangential at the equator with axis along the polar axis of the sphere. The cylindrical projections are constructed so that all points on a meridian are projected to points with ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''aλ'' and ''y'' a prescribed function of ''φ''. For a tangent Normal Mercator projection the (unique) formulae which guarantee conformality are:&lt;ref name=merc/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x = a\lambda\,,\qquad
y  = a\ln \left[\tan \left(\frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{\varphi}{2} \right)\right]
   = \frac{a}{2}\ln\left[\frac{1+\sin\varphi}{1-\sin\varphi}\right].
&lt;/math&gt;
Conformality implies that the [[Scale (map)|point scale]], ''k'', is independent of direction: it is a function of latitude only:
:&lt;math&gt;k(\varphi)=\sec\varphi.\,&lt;/math&gt;
For the secant version of the projection there is a factor of ''k''{{sub|0}} on the right hand side of all these equations: this ensures that the scale is equal to ''k''{{sub|0}} on the equator.

===Normal and transverse graticules===
[[File:Transverse mercator graticules.svg|thumb|400px|center|Transverse mercator graticules]]
&lt;!--=============================================================--&gt;
The figure on the left shows how a transverse cylinder is related to the conventional graticule on the sphere. It is tangential to some arbitrarily chosen meridian and its axis is perpendicular to that of the sphere. The ''x''- and ''y''-axes defined on the figure are related to the equator and central meridian exactly as they are for the normal projection. In the figure on the right a rotated graticule is related to the transverse cylinder in the same way that the normal cylinder is related to the standard graticule. The 'equator', 'poles' (E and W) and 'meridians' of the rotated graticule are identified with the chosen central meridian, points on the equator 90 degrees east and west of the central meridian, and great circles through those points.

[[File:Transverse mercator geometry.svg|thumb|Transverse mercator geometry]]
The position of an arbitrary point (''φ'',''λ'') on the standard graticule can also be identified in terms of angles on the rotated graticule: ''φ′'' (angle M′CP) is an effective latitude and −''λ′'' (angle M′CO) becomes an effective longitude. (The minus sign is necessary so that (''φ′'',''λ′'') are related to the rotated graticule in the same way that (''φ'',''λ'') are related to the standard graticule). The Cartesian (''x′'',''y′'') axes are related to the rotated graticule in the same way that the axes (''x'',''y'') axes are related to the standard graticule.

The tangent transverse Mercator projection defines the coordinates (''x′'',''y′'') in terms of −''λ′'' and ''φ′'' by the transformation formulae of the tangent Normal Mercator projection:
:&lt;math&gt;x' = -a\lambda'\,\qquad
y'  = \frac{a}{2}
         \ln\left[\frac{1+\sin\varphi'}{1-\sin\varphi'}\right].
&lt;/math&gt;
This transformation projects the central meridian to a straight line of finite length and at the same time projects the great circles through E and W (which include the equator) to infinite straight lines perpendicular to the central meridian. The true parallels and meridians (other than equator and central meridian) have no simple relation to the rotated graticule and they project to complicated curves.

===The relation between the graticules===
The angles of the two graticules are related by using [[spherical trigonometry]] on the spherical triangle NM′P defined by the true meridian through the origin, OM′N, the true meridian through an arbitrary point, MPN, and the great circle WM′PE. The results are:&lt;ref name=merc/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\sin\varphi'&amp;=\sin\lambda\cos\varphi,\\
\tan\lambda'&amp;=\sec\lambda\tan\varphi.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Direct transformation formulae===
The direct formulae giving the Cartesian coordinates (''x'',''y'') follow immediately from the above. Setting ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''y′'' and ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−''x′'' (and restoring factors of ''k''{{sub|0}} to accommodate secant versions)
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
x(\lambda,\varphi)&amp;= \frac{1}{2}k_0a
         \ln\left[
       \frac{1+\sin\lambda\cos\varphi}
        {1-\sin\lambda\cos\varphi}\right],\\[5px]
y(\lambda,\varphi)&amp;= k_0 a\arctan\left[\sec\lambda\tan\varphi\right],
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
The above expressions are given in Lambert&lt;ref name=lambert/&gt; and also (without derivations) in Snyder,&lt;ref name=snyder&gt;{{cite book | author=Snyder, John P. | title=Map Projections—A Working Manual. U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper 1395 | publisher =United States Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. | year=1987}}This paper can be downloaded from [https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/pubs/pp/pp1395 USGS pages.] It gives full details of most projections, together with interesting introductory sections, but it does not derive any of the projections from first principles.&lt;/ref&gt; Maling&lt;ref name=maling&gt;{{cite book | author=Maling, Derek Hylton | title=Coordinate Systems and Map Projections | publisher =Pergamon Press| year=1992|isbn=0-08-037233-3 |edition=second}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and Osborne&lt;ref name=merc&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130924093049/http://www.mercator99.webspace.virginmedia.com/ The Mercator Projections] Detailed derivations of all formulae quoted in this article&lt;/ref&gt; (with full details).

===Inverse transformation formulae===
Inverting the above equations gives
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
  \lambda(x,y)&amp;
= \arctan\left[ \sinh\frac{x}{k_0a}
                     \sec\frac{y}{k_0a} \right],
\\[5px]
  \varphi(x,y)&amp;= \arcsin\left[ \mbox{sech}\;\frac{x}{k_0a}
                        \sin\frac{y}{k_0a} \right].
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Point scale===
In terms of the coordinates with respect to the rotated graticule the [[Scale (map)|point scale]] factor is given by ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;sec&amp;nbsp;''φ′'': this may be expressed either in terms of the geographical coordinates or in terms of the projection coordinates:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
  k(\lambda,\varphi)&amp;=\frac{k_0}{\sqrt{1-\sin^2\lambda\cos^2\varphi}},\\[5px]
k(x,y)&amp;=k_0\cosh\left(\frac{x}{k_0a}\right).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
The second expression shows that the scale factor is simply a function of the distance from the central meridian of the projection. A typical value of the scale factor is ''k''{{sub|0}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.9996 so that ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 when ''x'' is approximately 180&amp;nbsp;km. When ''x'' is approximately 255&amp;nbsp;km and ''k''{{sub|0}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.0004: the scale factor is within 0.04% of unity over a strip of about 510&amp;nbsp;km wide.

{{anchor|convergence}}

===Convergence===
[[File:Transverse mercator convergence.svg|right|thumb|upright|The angle of convergence]]

The convergence angle ''γ'' at a point on the projection is defined by the angle measured ''from'' the projected meridian, which defines true north, ''to'' a grid line of constant ''x'', defining grid north. Therefore, ''γ'' is positive in the quadrant north of the equator and east of the central meridian and also in the quadrant south of the equator and west of the central meridian. The convergence must be added to a grid bearing to obtain a bearing from true north. For the secant transverse Mercator the convergence may be expressed&lt;ref name=merc/&gt; either in terms of the geographical coordinates or in terms of the projection coordinates:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\gamma(\lambda,\varphi)&amp;=\arctan(\tan\lambda\sin\varphi),\\[5px]
\gamma(x,y)&amp;=\arctan\left(\tanh\frac{x}{k_0a}\tan\frac{y}{k_0a}\right).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

* Fourth order Redfearn series by concise formulae (example): [[Transverse Mercator: Bowring series]]

==Coordinates, grids, eastings and northings==
The projection coordinates resulting from the various developments of the ellipsoidal transverse Mercator are Cartesian coordinates such that the central meridian corresponds to the ''x'' axis and the equator corresponds to the ''y'' axis. Both ''x'' and ''y'' are defined for all values of ''λ'' and ''ϕ''. The projection does not define a grid: the grid is an independent construct which could be defined arbitrarily. In practice the national implementations, and UTM, do use grids aligned with the Cartesian axes of the projection, but they are of finite extent, with origins which need not coincide with the intersection of the central meridian with the equator.

The '''true grid origin''' is always taken on the central meridian so that grid coordinates will be negative west of the central meridian. To avoid such negative grid coordinates, standard practice defines a '''false origin''' to the west (and possibly north or south) of the grid origin: the coordinates relative to the false origin define '''eastings''' and '''northings''' which will always be positive. The '''false easting''', ''E''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, is the distance of the true grid origin  east of the false origin. The '''false northing''', ''N''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, is the distance of the true grid origin north of the false origin. If the true origin of the grid is at latitude ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; on the central meridian and the scale factor the central meridian is ''k''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; then these definitions give eastings and northings by:
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
    E&amp;=E_0+x(\lambda,\varphi),\\[5px]
    N&amp;=N_0+y(\lambda,\varphi)-k_0 m(\varphi_0).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
The terms "eastings" and "northings" do not mean strict east and north directions. Grid lines of the transverse projection, other than the ''x'' and ''y'' axes, do not run north-south or east-west as defined by parallels and meridians. This is evident from the global projections shown above. Near the central meridian the differences are small but measurable. The difference between the north-south grid lines and the true meridians is the [[Transverse Mercator projection#Convergence|angle of convergence]].
