{{Infobox argon}}

'''Argon''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol&amp;nbsp;'''Ar''' and [[atomic number]]&amp;nbsp;18. It is in group 18 of the [[periodic table]] and is a [[noble gas]].&lt;ref&gt;In older versions of the periodic table, the noble gases were identified as Group VIIIA or as Group 0. See [[Group (periodic table)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Argon is the third-most abundant gas in the [[Earth's atmosphere]], at 0.934% (9340 [[Parts-per notation|ppmv]]). It is more than twice as abundant as [[water vapor]] (which averages about 4000 ppmv, but varies greatly), 23 times as abundant as [[carbon dioxide]] (400 ppmv), and more than 500 times as abundant as [[neon]] (18 ppmv). Argon is the most abundant noble gas in Earth's crust, comprising 0.00015% of the crust.

Nearly all of the argon in the Earth's atmosphere is [[radiogenic]] [[argon-40]], derived from the [[Radioactive decay|decay]] of [[potassium-40]] in the Earth's crust. In the universe, [[argon-36]] is by far the most common argon [[isotope]], as it is the most easily produced by stellar [[nucleosynthesis]] in [[supernova]]s.

The name "argon" is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|ἀργόν}}, neuter singular form of {{lang|grc|ἀργός}} meaning "lazy" or "inactive", as a reference to the fact that the element undergoes almost no chemical reactions. The complete [[octet rule|octet]] (eight electrons) in the outer atomic shell makes argon stable and resistant to bonding with other elements. Its [[triple point]] temperature of 83.8058&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]] is a defining fixed point in the [[International Temperature Scale of 1990]].

Argon is produced industrially by the [[fractional distillation]] of [[liquid air]]. Argon is mostly used as an [[Inert gas|inert]] [[shielding gas]] in welding and other high-temperature industrial processes where ordinarily unreactive substances become reactive; for example, an argon atmosphere is used in [[graphite]] electric furnaces to prevent the graphite from burning. Argon is also used in [[Incandescent light bulb|incandescent]], [[fluorescent lighting]], and other gas-discharge tubes. Argon makes a distinctive [[Ion laser#Argon laser|blue-green gas laser]]. Argon is also used in fluorescent glow starters.

==Characteristics==
[[File:Argon ice 1.jpg|upright|thumb|left|A small piece of rapidly melting solid argon]]
Argon has approximately the same [[solubility]] in water as oxygen and is 2.5 times more soluble in water than [[nitrogen]]. Argon is colorless, odorless, nonflammable and nontoxic as a solid, liquid or gas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uigi.com/MSDS_gaseous_Ar.html Material Safety Data Sheet Gaseous Argon], Universal Industrial Gases, Inc. Retrieved 14 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Argon is chemically [[Inert gas|inert]] under most conditions and forms no confirmed stable compounds at room temperature.

Although argon is a [[noble gas]], it can form some compounds under various extreme conditions. [[Argon fluorohydride]] (HArF), a compound of argon with [[fluorine]] and [[hydrogen]] that is stable below {{cvt|17|K}}, has been demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==History==
[[Image:Isolation of Argon.png|thumb|left |upright|[[John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Lord Rayleigh]]'s method for the isolation of argon, based on an experiment of [[Henry Cavendish]]'s. The gases are contained in a test-tube (A) standing over a large quantity of weak [[alkali]] (B), and the current is conveyed in wires insulated by U-shaped glass tubes (CC) passing through the liquid and round the mouth of the test-tube. The inner platinum ends (DD) of the wire receive a current from a battery of five [[Grove cell]]s and a [[Ruhmkorff coil]] of medium size.]]
''Argon'' ([[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀργόν}}, neuter singular form of {{lang|grc|ἀργός}} meaning "lazy" or "inactive"), is named in reference to its chemical inactivity. This chemical property of this first [[noble gas]] to be discovered impressed the namers.&lt;ref name="lazyone1"&gt;

The difference was slight, but it was important enough to attract their attention for many months. They concluded that there was another gas in the air mixed in with the nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;

{{Main|Isotopes of argon}}

The main [[isotope]]s of argon found on Earth are {{chem|40|Ar}} (99.6%), {{chem|36|Ar}} (0.34%), and {{chem|38|Ar}} (0.06%). Naturally occurring {{chem|40|[[potassium|K]]}}, with a [[half-life]] of 1.25{{e|9}} years, decays to stable {{chem|40|Ar}} (11.2%) by [[electron capture]] or [[positron emission]], and also to stable {{chem|40|Ca}} (88.8%) by [[beta decay]].

In the Earth's atmosphere, {{chem|39|Ar}} is made by [[cosmic ray]] activity, primarily by neutron capture of {{chem|40|Ar}} followed by two-neutron emission. In the subsurface environment, it is also produced through [[neutron capture]] by {{chem|39|K}}, followed by proton emission. {{chem|37|Ar}} is created from the [[neutron capture]] by {{chem|40|Ca}} followed by an [[alpha particle]] emission as a result of subsurface [[nuclear testing|nuclear explosions]]. It has a half-life of 35 days.&lt;ref name=iso/&gt;

Between locations in the [[Solar System]], the isotopic composition of argon varies greatly. Where the major source of argon is the decay of [[potassium-40|{{chem|40|K}}]] in rocks, {{chem|40|Ar}} will be the dominant isotope, as it is on Earth. Argon produced directly by [[stellar nucleosynthesis]], is dominated by the [[alpha process|alpha-process]] nuclide {{chem|36|Ar}}. Correspondingly, solar argon contains 84.6% {{chem|36|Ar}} (according to [[solar wind]] measurements),&lt;ref&gt;

The predominance of [[radiogenic]] {{chem|40|Ar}} is the reason the [[standard atomic weight]] of terrestrial argon is greater than that of the next element, [[potassium]], a fact that was puzzling when argon was discovered. [[Dmitri Mendeleev|Mendeleev]] positioned the elements on his [[periodic table]] in order of atomic weight, but the inertness of argon suggested a placement ''before'' the reactive [[alkali metal]]. [[Henry Moseley]] later solved this problem by showing that the periodic table is actually arranged in order of [[atomic number]] (see [[History of the periodic table]]).

Argon's complete octet of [[electron]]s indicates full s and p subshells. This full [[valence shell]] makes argon very stable and extremely resistant to bonding with other elements. Before 1962, argon and the other noble gases were considered to be chemically inert and unable to form compounds; however, compounds of the heavier noble gases have since been synthesized. The first argon compound with tungsten pentacarbonyl, W(CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Ar, was isolated in 1975. However it was not widely recognised at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Young|first1=Nigel A.|title=Main group coordination chemistry at low temperatures: A review of matrix isolated Group 12 to Group 18 complexes|journal=Coordination Chemistry Reviews|date=March 2013|volume=257|issue=5–6|pages=956–1010|doi=10.1016/j.ccr.2012.10.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2000, another argon compound, [[argon fluorohydride]] (HArF), was formed by researchers at the [[University of Helsinki]], by shining ultraviolet light onto frozen argon containing a small amount of [[hydrogen fluoride]] with [[caesium iodide]]. This discovery caused the recognition that argon could form weakly bound compounds, even though it was not the first.&lt;ref name="sciencenews-harf"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = Kean, Sam|chapter = Chemistry Way, Way Below Zero|title = The Disappearing Spoon|date = 2011|publisher=Black Bay Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

==Production==

===Industrial===
Argon is produced industrially by the [[fractional distillation]] of [[liquid air]] in a [[cryogenic]] [[air separation]] unit; a process that separates [[liquid nitrogen]], which boils at 77.3&amp;nbsp;K, from argon, which boils at 87.3&amp;nbsp;K, and [[liquid oxygen]], which boils at 90.2&amp;nbsp;K. About 700,000 [[tonne]]s of argon are produced worldwide every year.&lt;ref name=emsley/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

 |title=Periodic Table of Elements: Argon – Ar
 |publisher=Environmentalchemistry.com
 |accessdate=12 September 2008
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In radioactive decays===
[[Isotopes of argon|&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ar]], the most abundant [[isotope]] of argon, is produced by the decay of &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;[[potassium|K]] with a half-life of 1.25{{e|9}} years by [[electron capture]] or [[positron emission]]. Because of this, it is used in [[potassium–argon dating]] to determine the age of rocks.

==Applications==
[[Image:Argon.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Cylinders containing argon gas for use in extinguishing fire without damaging server equipment]]

Argon has several desirable properties:
* Argon is a chemically [[inert gas]].
* Argon is the cheapest alternative when [[nitrogen]] is not sufficiently inert.
* Argon has low [[thermal conductivity]].
* Argon has electronic properties (ionization and/or the emission spectrum) desirable for some applications.

Other [[noble gas]]es would be equally suitable for most of these applications, but argon is by far the cheapest. Argon is inexpensive, since it occurs naturally in air and is readily obtained as a byproduct of [[cryogenic]] [[air separation]] in the production of [[liquid oxygen]] and [[liquid nitrogen]]: the primary constituents of air are used on a large industrial scale. The other noble gases (except [[helium]]) are produced this way as well, but argon is the most plentiful by far. The bulk of argon applications arise simply because it is inert and relatively cheap.

===Industrial processes===
Argon is used in some high-temperature industrial processes where ordinarily non-reactive substances become reactive. For example, an argon atmosphere is used in graphite electric furnaces to prevent the graphite from burning.

For some of these processes, the presence of nitrogen or oxygen gases might cause defects within the material. Argon is used in some types of [[arc welding]] such as [[gas metal arc welding]] and [[gas tungsten arc welding]], as well as in the processing of [[titanium]] and other reactive elements. An argon atmosphere is also used for growing crystals of [[silicon]] and [[germanium]].

Argon is used in the poultry industry to [[asphyxiant gas|asphyxiate]] birds, either for mass culling following disease outbreaks, or as a means of slaughter more humane than the electric bath. Argon is denser than air and displaces oxygen close to the ground during [[inert gas asphyxiation|gassing]].&lt;ref&gt;

===Scientific research===
Liquid argon is used as the target for neutrino experiments and direct [[dark matter]] searches. The interaction between the hypothetical [[Weakly interacting massive particles|WIMP]]s and an argon nucleus produces [[scintillation (physics)|scintillation]] light that is detected by [[photomultiplier tubes]]. Two-phase detectors containing argon gas are used to detect the ionized electrons produced during the WIMP–nucleus scattering. As with most other liquefied noble gases, argon has a high scintillation light yield (about 51 photons/keV&lt;ref&gt;

Compared to [[xenon]], argon is cheaper and has a distinct scintillation time profile, which allows the separation of electronic recoils from nuclear recoils.  On the other hand, its intrinsic beta-ray background is larger due to {{chem|39|Ar}} contamination, unless one uses argon from underground sources, which has much less {{chem|39|Ar}} contamination. Most of the argon in the Earth’s atmosphere was produced by electron capture of long-lived {{chem|40|K}} ({{chem|40|K}} + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → {{chem|40|Ar}} + ν) present in natural potassium within the Earth.  The {{chem|39|Ar}} activity in the atmosphere is maintained by cosmogenic production through the knockout reaction {{chem|40|Ar}}(n,2n){{chem|39|Ar}} and similar reactions.  The half-life of {{chem|39|Ar}} is only 269&amp;nbsp;years.  As a result, the underground Ar, shielded by rock and water, has much less {{chem|39|Ar}} contamination.&lt;ref&gt;

Neutrino experiments include [[ICARUS (experiment)|ICARUS]] and [[MicroBooNE]], both of which use high-purity liquid argon in a [[time projection chamber]] for fine grained three-dimensional imaging of neutrino interactions.

===Preservative===

[[File:CsCrystals.JPG|thumb|A sample of [[caesium]] is packed under argon to avoid reactions with air]]
Argon is used to displace oxygen- and moisture-containing air in packaging material to extend the shelf-lives of the contents (argon has the [[E numbers|European food additive code]] E938). Aerial oxidation, hydrolysis, and other chemical reactions that degrade the products are retarded or prevented entirely. High-purity chemicals and pharmaceuticals are sometimes packed and sealed in argon.

In [[winemaking]], argon is used in a variety of activities to provide a barrier against oxygen at the liquid surface, which can spoil wine by fueling both microbial metabolism (as with [[acetic acid bacteria]]) and standard [[redox]] chemistry.

Argon is sometimes used as the propellant in [[aerosol]] cans for such products as [[varnish]], [[polyurethane]], and paint, and to displace air when preparing a container for storage after opening.&lt;ref&gt;Zawalick, Steven Scott "Method for preserving an oxygen sensitive liquid product" {{US patent|6629402}} Issue date: 7 October 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2002, the American [[National Archives]] stores important national documents such as the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] within argon-filled cases to inhibit their degradation. Argon is preferable to the helium that had been used in the preceding five decades, because helium gas escapes through the intermolecular pores in most containers and must be regularly replaced.&lt;ref&gt;

===Laboratory equipment===
[[Image:Glovebox.jpg|thumb|[[Glovebox]]es are often filled with argon, which recirculates over scrubbers to maintain an [[oxygen]]-, [[nitrogen]]-, and moisture-free atmosphere]]
{{See also|Air-free technique}}

Argon may be used as the [[inert gas]] within [[Schlenk line]]s and [[glovebox]]es. Argon is preferred to less expensive nitrogen in cases where nitrogen may react with the reagents or apparatus.

Argon may be used as the carrier gas in [[gas chromatography]] and in [[electrospray ionization mass spectrometry]]; it is the gas of choice for the plasma used in [[Inductively coupled plasma|ICP]] [[spectroscopy]]. Argon is preferred for the sputter coating of specimens for [[scanning electron microscopy]]. Argon gas is also commonly used for [[sputter deposition]] of thin films as in [[microelectronics]] and for [[microfabrication|wafer cleaning in microfabrication]].

===Medical use===
[[Cryosurgery]] procedures such as [[cryoablation]] use liquid argon to destroy tissue such as [[cancer]] cells. It is used in a procedure called "argon-enhanced coagulation", a form of argon [[plasma torch|plasma beam]] [[electrosurgery]]. The procedure carries a risk of producing [[gas embolism]] and has resulted in the death of at least one patient.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Incandescent light]]s are filled with argon, to preserve the [[electrical filament|filaments]] at high temperature from oxidation. It is used for the specific way it ionizes and emits light, such as in [[plasma globe]]s and [[Calorimeter (particle physics)|calorimetry]] in experimental [[particle physics]]. [[Gas-discharge lamp]]s filled with pure argon provide lilac/violet light; with argon and some mercury, blue light. Argon is also used for blue and green [[argon laser|argon-ion lasers]].

Argon-39, with a half-life of 269 years, has been used for a number of applications, primarily [[ice core]] and [[ground water]] dating. Also, [[potassium–argon dating]] and related [[Argon argon dating|argon-argon dating]] is used to date [[Sedimentary rock|sedimentary]], [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic]], and [[igneous rock]]s.&lt;ref name="emsley" /&gt;

Argon has been used by athletes as a doping agent to simulate [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxic]] conditions.  In 2014, the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA) added argon and [[xenon]] to the list of prohibited substances and methods, although at this time there is no reliable test for abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=WADA amends Section S.2.1 of 2014 Prohibited List |url=https://www.wada-ama.org/en/media/2014-05/wada-amends-section-s21-of-2014-prohibited-list#.VARJ3WNqOIl |date=31 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==
Although argon is non-toxic, it is 38% [[density|denser]] than air and therefore considered a dangerous [[asphyxiant gas|asphyxiant]] in closed areas. It is difficult to detect because it is colorless, odorless, and tasteless. A 1994 incident, in which a man was [[asphyxia]]ted after entering an argon-filled section of oil pipe under construction in [[Alaska]], highlights the dangers of argon tank leakage in confined spaces and emphasizes the need for proper use, storage and handling.&lt;ref&gt;

'''''Arroba''''' was a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] and [[Spain|Spanish]] custom unit of weight, mass or volume. Its symbol is [[At sign|@]].

==History==
The word ''arroba'' has its origin in Arabic ''ar-rubʿ'' (الربع) or "quarter," specifically the fourth part (of a [[quintal]]), which defined the average load which a [[donkey]] could carry.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/201202/the.other.side.of.cork.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spain and Portugal==
In weight it was equal to 32 [[Portuguese customary units#Weight units|pounds]] (14.7&amp;nbsp;kg) in Portugal and 25 [[Spanish customary units|pounds]] (11.5&amp;nbsp;kg) in Spain.

Arroba and bushel as weight units are similar (15&amp;nbsp;kg).

==Latin America==

The unit is still used in Portugal by [[cork (material)|cork]] merchants, and in [[Brazil]] by the agricultural sector. The modern metric arroba used in these country life activities is defined as {{convert|15|kg}}.

In [[Peru]] the arroba is equivalent to {{convert|11.5|kg}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[La República]], [http://www.larepublica.pe/sociedad/24/04/2010/en-feria-de-la-mujer-emprendedora-presentan-antibioticos-naturales-saludables En Feria de la Mujer Emprendedora presentan antibióticos naturales saludables] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Bolivia]] nationally it is equivalent to {{convert|30.46|l}}. However locally there are many different values, ranging from {{convert|11.5|l}} in [[Inquisivi]] to {{convert|16|l}} in [[Baures]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sizes.com/units/arroba_bolivia.htm Arroba in Bolivia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206230602/http://www.sizes.com/units/arroba_bolivia.htm |date=February 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet==

In Spanish-speaking and Portuguese-speaking countries, "arroba" has continued as the word for the "@" symbol used in Internet email addresses.

[[Image:Barabus Kazan.jpg|thumb|350px|Barabuses in Kazan]]
'''Barabus''' (rendering of [[Tatar language|Tatar]] ''barabız'' “we are going”  + [[English language|English]] ''[[bus]]'') was a winter [[public transport]] in 19th – early 20th centuries, probably the first public transport in [[Kazan]] after [[taxicab|cab]]s. They were operated by private carriers who were poor [[Tatar]] [[commoner]]s from surrounding [[village]]s. A typical barabus was a [[sledge]] sheeted with [[Burlap|sacking]]. Barabus was a [[transport]] of [[pauper]]s competing with cabs, [[Horsecar|horse railways]] and later [[tram]]way. Until the 1930s, when trams were installed in the [[suburbs]] and any private enterprise was prohibited, barabuses were the only transport to connect quarters of poor mill-hands with other parts of the city.

In [[mathematics]], a [[topological space]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a '''D-space''' if for any family &lt;math&gt;\{U_x:x\in X\}&lt;/math&gt; of [[open set]]s such that &lt;math&gt;x\in U_x&lt;/math&gt; for all points &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;, there is a closed discrete [[subset]] &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; of the [[space]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{x\in D}U_x=X&lt;/math&gt;.

== History ==

The notion of D-spaces was introduced by Eric Karel van Douwen and E.A. Michael. It first appeared in a 1979 paper by van Douwen and Washek Frantisek Pfeffer in the [[Pacific Journal of Mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=van Douwen|first1=E.|last2=Pfeffer|first2=W.|year=1979|title=Some properties of the Sorgenfrey line and related spaces|url=http://msp.org/pjm/1979/81-2/pjm-v81-n2-p07-s.pdf|journal=Pacific Journal of Mathematics|volume=81|pages=371–377}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether every [[Lindelöf]] and regular [[topological space]] is a D-space  is known as the '''D-space problem'''. This problem is among twenty of the most important problems of set theoretic topology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/162136062|title=Open problems in topology II|last=Elliott.|first=Pearl,|date=2007-01-01|publisher=[[Elsevier]]|isbn=9780444522085|oclc=162136062}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dhanushsagar''' is a religious place of worship for Hindus where the Patala bhaana of Shiva's bow is housed. The significance of Patala bhaana receives a mention in the [[Hindu]] epic [[Ramayana]], wherein [[Rama]] during the [[Sita]] swayamvara broke the bow of Shiva into three pieces. Akasha bhaana flew to [[Dhanushkodi]] in Raameshwaram, bhoomi bhaana housed at [[Dhanushadham]] and paatala bhaana creating Dhanushsagar. The bow has been seen by devotees till the early 1980s after which it has got submerged due to the ever-increasing pollution. The lake is 1&amp;nbsp;km from the famous Janaki temple of Janakpur (erstwhile Mithila). [[Janakpur]] draws its fame as the birthplace of Maharani Sita who was one of the principal deities of [[Ramayana]]. Presently the area surrounding the lake is used by road side sellers. There are a few bathing ghats built around the lake for public use. A walk around the lake gives a few glimpses of Maa Gayatri temple and Gangasagar which is colacated with Dhanushsagar.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4593">[[Image:DRIFT-IIb.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The DRIFT-IId Detector removed from the vacuum vessel for maintenance.]]
The '''Directional Recoil Identification from Tracks''' ('''DRIFT''') detector is a low pressure [[negative ion]] [[time projection chamber]] (NITPC) designed to detect [[weakly interacting massive particles]] (WIMPs) - a prime [[dark matter]] candidate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_matter.html ''Universe 101''.NASA website ] Hinshaw, Gary F. (January 29, 2010) Retrieved 2011-09-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are currently two DRIFT detectors in operation. DRIFT-IId, which is located 1100m underground in the [[Boulby Underground Laboratory]] at the Boulby Mine in North Yorkshire, England,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stfc.ac.uk/Boulby/default.aspx Boulby Underground Science Facility]&lt;/ref&gt; and DRIFT-IIe, which is located on the surface at [[Occidental College]], Los Angeles, CA, USA.

The DRIFT collaboration ultimately aims to develop and operate an underground array of DRIFT detectors for observing and reconstructing WIMP-induced nuclear recoil tracks with enough precision to provide a signature of the [[dark matter halo]].

== WIMP detection ==
There are numerous experiments worldwide attempting to detect the energy deposition that is expected to occur when a WIMP directly collides with an atom of ordinary matter. Ultra sensitive experiments are required to detect the low energy and extremely rare interaction that is predicted to occur between a WIMP and the nucleus of an atom in a target material. The DRIFT detectors vary from the majority of WIMP detectors in their use of a low pressure gas as a target material. The low pressure gas means that an interaction within the detector causes an [[ionisation]] track of measurable length compared to the point like interactions seen in detectors with solid or liquid target materials. Such ionisation tracks can be reconstructed in three dimensions to determine not only the type of particle that caused it, but from which direction the particle came. This directional sensitivity has the potential to prove the existence of WIMPs by their distinct directional signature.

== Detection technology ==
[[Image:track formation.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Negative ion track formation in the DRIFT detector.]]
The DRIFT detector's target material is a 1&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; cubical [[drift chamber]] filled with a low pressure mixture of [[carbon disulfide]] (CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[carbon tetrafluoride]] (CF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) gases ({{convert|30|and|10|torr|kPa|lk=on}}, respectively). It is predicted that WIMPs will occasionally collide with the nucleus of a sulfur or carbon atom in the carbon disulfide gas causing the nucleus to recoil. An energetic recoiling nucleus will ionise gas particles creating a path of free electrons. These free electrons readily attach to the [[electronegative]] CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules creating a track of {{SubSup|CS|2|−}} ions.  The gas volume is divided in half by a [[cathode]] at {{val|-34|u=kV}}, which produces a static electric field that causes these negative ions to drift, whilst maintaining the track structure, to the [[MWPC]] planes at two ends of the detector. Addition of {{convert|1|torr|Pa}} of oxygen to the gas mixture has been the key to full fiducialisation of sensitive volume of the DRIFT detector.

All celestial bodies in the Solar System, including planets such as our own, orbit around the Solar System's centre of mass. The sun makes up 99.76% of this mass which is why the centre of mass is extremely close to the sun.

'''Earth's orbit''' is the [[orbit|trajectory]] along which [[Earth]] travels around the [[Sun]]. The [[list of Solar System objects in hydrostatic equilibrium#Planets|average distance]] between the Earth and the Sun is [[astronomical unit|149.60 million km]] (92.96 million mi),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Display=Facts&amp;Object=Sun | title = Sun: Facts &amp; Figures | work = Solar System Exploration | publisher = [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] | accessdate = July 29, 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150703111716/http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Sun&amp;Display=Facts | archive-date = July 3, 2015 | dead-url = yes | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and one complete orbit takes {{gaps|365.256||}}&amp;nbsp;days (1 [[sidereal year]]), during which time Earth has traveled 940&amp;nbsp;million km (584 million mi).&lt;ref name="AA"&gt;[[Jean Meeus]], ''Astronomical Algorithms'' 2nd ed, {{ISBN|0-943396-61-1}} (Richmond, VA: Willmann-Bell, 1998) 238. See [[Ellipse#Circumference]]. The formula by Ramanujan is accurate enough.&lt;/ref&gt; Earth's orbit has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.0167.

As seen from Earth, the planet's orbital [[prograde motion]] makes the Sun [[diurnal motion|appear to move]] with respect to [[fixed stars|other stars]] at a rate of about 1° (or a Sun or Moon diameter every 12&amp;nbsp;hours) eastward per [[solar day]].&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Our planet takes about 365 days to orbit the Sun. A full orbit has 360°. That fact demonstrates that each day, the Earth travels roughly 1° in its orbit. Thus, the Sun will appear to move  across the sky relative to the stars by that same amount.&lt;/ref&gt; Earth's [[orbital speed]] averages about 30&amp;nbsp;km/s (108,000&amp;nbsp;km/h; 67,000&amp;nbsp;mph), which is fast enough to cover the planet's diameter in 7 minutes and the [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|distance]] to the [[Moon]] in 4 hours.&lt;ref name="earth_fact_sheet"&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=David R.|date=2004-09-01|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/earthfact.html|title=Earth Fact Sheet|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=2007-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a vantage point above the north pole of either the Sun or Earth, Earth would appear to revolve in a counter[[clockwise]] direction around the Sun. From the same vantage point, both the Earth and the Sun would appear to rotate also in a counterclockwise direction about their respective axes.

[[Heliocentrism]] is the scientific model that first placed the Sun at the center of the [[Solar System]] and put the planets, including Earth, in its orbit. Historically, heliocentrism is opposed to [[geocentrism]], which placed the Earth at the center. [[Aristarchus of Samos]] already proposed a heliocentric model in the 3rd century BC. In the 16th century, [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]' ''[[De revolutionibus]]'' presented a full discussion of a [[Copernican heliocentrism|heliocentric model]] of the universe&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = De revolutionibus orbium coelestium|last = |first = |publisher = Johannes Petreius|date = 1543|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; in much the same way as [[Ptolemy]] had presented his geocentric model in the 2nd century. This "[[Copernican revolution]]" resolved the issue of planetary [[apparent retrograde motion|retrograde motion]] by arguing that such motion was only perceived and apparent. "Although Copernicus's groundbreaking book...had been [printed] over a century earlier, [the Dutch mapmaker] [[Joan Blaeu]] was the first mapmaker to incorporate his revolutionary heliocentric theory into a map of the world."&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Brotton, ''A History of the World in Twelve Maps'', London: Allen Lane, 2012, {{ISBN|9781846140990}} p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on Earth==
{{main|Season}}
Because of Earth's [[axial tilt]] (often known as the obliquity of the [[ecliptic]]), the inclination of the Sun's trajectory in the sky (as seen by an observer on Earth's surface) varies over the course of the year. For an observer at a northern latitude, when the north pole is tilted toward the Sun the day lasts longer and the Sun appears higher in the sky. This results in warmer average temperatures, as additional solar radiation reaches the surface. When the north pole is tilted away from the Sun, the reverse is true and the weather is generally cooler. North of the [[Arctic Circle]] and south of the [[Antarctic Circle]], an extreme case is reached in which there is no daylight at all for part of the year, and continuous daylight during the opposite time of year. This is called [[polar night]] and [[midnight sun]]. This variation in the weather (because of the direction of the Earth's axial tilt) results in the [[season]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://spaceplace.nasa.gov/seasons/en/|title = What causes the seasons? (NASA)|accessdate = January 22, 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events in the orbit==
By astronomical convention, the four seasons are determined by the [[solstice]]s (the two points in the Earth's orbit of the maximum tilt of the Earth's axis, toward the Sun or away from the Sun) and the [[equinox]]es (the two points in the Earth's orbit where the Earth's tilted axis and an imaginary line drawn from the Earth to the Sun are exactly perpendicular to one another). The solstices and equinoxes divide the year up into four approximately equal parts. In the northern hemisphere [[winter solstice]] occurs on or about December 21; summer solstice is near June 21; spring equinox is around March 20; and autumnal equinox is about September 23.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/longest-day/equinox-solstice-2010-2019.htm|title = Date &amp; Time of Solstices &amp; Equinoxes|date = August 28, 2013|accessdate = Jan 22, 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of the Earth's axial tilt in the southern hemisphere is the opposite of that in the northern hemisphere, thus the seasons of the solstices and equinoxes in the southern hemisphere are the reverse of those in the northern hemisphere (e.g. the northern summer solstice is at the same time as the southern winter solstice).

In modern times, Earth's [[Perihelion and aphelion|perihelion]] occurs around January 3, and the [[Perihelion and aphelion|aphelion]] around July 4 (for other eras, see [[precession (astronomy)|precession]] and [[Milankovitch cycles]]). The changing Earth–Sun distance results in an increase of about 6.9%&lt;ref&gt;Aphelion is 103.4% of the distance to perihelion. See "Orbital characteristics" table. Due to the inverse square law, the radiation at perihelion is about 106.9% of the radiation at aphelion.{{citation needed|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in total solar energy reaching the Earth at perihelion relative to aphelion. Since the southern hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun at about the same time that the Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the southern hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year. However, this effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the southern hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Jack|date=2005-12-20|url=https://www.usatoday.com/weather/tg/wseason/wseason.htm|title=Earth's tilt creates seasons|publisher=USAToday|accessdate=2007-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hill sphere]] ([[gravity|gravitational]] sphere of influence) of the Earth is about 1,500,000 [[kilometer]]s (0.01 [[Astronomical unit|AU]]) in radius, or approximately 4 times the average distance to the moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Vázquez, M.|author2=Montañés Rodríguez, P.|author3=Palle, E.|date=2006|url= http://www.iac.es/folleto/research/preprints/files/PP06024.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Earth as an Object of Astrophysical Interest in the Search for Extrasolar Planets|publisher=Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias|accessdate=2007-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;For the Earth, the Hill radius is

:&lt;math&gt;R_H = a \left(\frac{m}{3M}\right)^{1/3},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is the mass of the Earth, ''a'' is an astronomical unit, and ''M'' is the mass of the Sun. So the radius in AU is about

&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{1}{3 \cdot 332\,946}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.01&lt;/math&gt;.{{citation needed|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the maximal distance at which the Earth's gravitational influence is stronger than the more distant Sun and planets. Objects orbiting the Earth must be within this radius, otherwise they can become unbound by the gravitational perturbation of the Sun.

The following diagram shows the relation between the line of solstice and the line of [[Apsis|apsides]] of Earth's elliptical orbit. The orbital ellipse goes through each of the six Earth images, which are sequentially the perihelion (periapsis — nearest point to the Sun) on anywhere from January 2 to January 5, the point of March equinox on  March 19, 20, or 21, the point of June solstice on June 20, 21, or 22, the aphelion (apoapsis — farthest point from the Sun) on anywhere from July 3 to July 5, the September equinox on September 22, 23, or 24, and the December solstice on December 21, 22, or 23.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The diagram shows an exaggerated shape of Earth's orbit; the actual orbit is less eccentric than pictured.

[[Image:Seasons1.svg|center|600px]]
Because of the [[Axial tilt#Obliquity of the ecliptic (Earth's axial tilt)|axial tilt]] of the Earth in its orbit, the maximal intensity of Sun rays hits the Earth 23.4 degrees north of equator at the June Solstice (at the '''[[Tropic of Cancer]]'''), and 23.4 degrees south of equator at the December Solstice (at the '''[[Tropic of Capricorn]]''').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=551|title = What is the significance of the Tropic of Cancer, Tropic of Capricorn, Arctic Circle and Antarctic Circle?|date = |accessdate = Jan 22, 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
{{main|Stability of the Solar System}}
Mathematicians and astronomers (such as [[Laplace]], [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]], [[Gauss]], [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]], [[Kolmogorov]], [[Vladimir Arnold]], and [[Jürgen Moser]]) have searched for evidence for the stability of the planetary motions, and this quest led to many mathematical developments and several successive "proofs" of stability for the Solar System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Astronomy and Astropvhysics|editor-last=Murdin|editor-first=Paul|id=article 2198|url=http://eaa.iop.org/abstract/0333750888/2198|last=Laskar|first=J.|title=Solar System: Stability|date=2001|publisher=[[Institute of Physics Publishing]]|location=Bristol}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; By most predictions, Earth's orbit will be relatively stable over long periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gribbin|first=John|title=Deep simplicity : bringing order to chaos and complexity|date=2004|publisher=[[Random House]]|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4000-6256-0|edition=1st U.S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, [[Jacques Laskar]]'s work indicated that the Earth's orbit (as well as the orbits of all the inner planets) can become chaotic and that an error as small as 15 meters in measuring the initial position of the Earth today would make it impossible to predict where the Earth would be in its orbit in just over 100 million years' time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.news.com.au/national/earth-venus-smash-up-possible/story-e6frfkp9-1225732704812|title = Earth-Venus smash-up possible|last = |first = |date = June 11, 2009|work = |access-date = Jan 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modeling the Solar System is a subject covered by the [[n-body problem]].

==Notes==
{{reflist|group=nb|refs=
&lt;ref name=apsis&gt;aphelion = ''a'' × (1 + ''e''); perihelion = ''a'' × (1&amp;nbsp;– ''e''), where ''a'' is the semi-major axis and ''e'' is the eccentricity.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=epoch&gt;All astronomical quantities vary, both [[Secular phenomena|secularly]] and [[Frequency|periodically]]. The quantities given are the values at the instant [[J2000.0]] of the secular variation, ignoring all periodic variations.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=arg_peri&gt;The reference lists the [[longitude of periapsis|longitude of perihelion]], which is the sum of the longitude of the ascending node and the argument of perihelion. Subtracting from that (102.937°) the node longitude of 174.873° gives −71.936°. Adding 360° gives 288.064°. That addition does not change the angle but expresses it in the usual 0–360° range for longitudes.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Felling''' is the process of cutting down individual trees,&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;"Feller" def. 2. and "Felling", def. 1. ''Oxford English Dictionary'' Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) © Oxford University Press 2009&lt;/ref&gt; an element of the task of [[logging]]. The person cutting the trees is a ''feller''.&lt;ref name="OED" /&gt;

==Methods==
===Hand felling===
In hand felling, an [[axe]], [[saw]], or [[chainsaw]] is used to ''fell'' a tree, followed up by [[limbing]] and [[log bucking|bucking]] in traditional applications. In the modern commercial logging industry, felling is typically followed by limbing and [[skidder|skidding]].

===Feller buncher===
{{main|Feller buncher}}
A '''feller-buncher''' is a motorized vehicle with an attachment which rapidly cuts and gathers several trees in the process of felling them. 

In [[cut-to-length logging]] a [[harvester (forestry)|harvester]] performs the tasks of a feller-buncher additionally doing the delimbing and bucking of the trees as well. When harvesting wood from a felled tree, the recommended methods should be followed in order to get more wood recovery. The suggested trend is to make deeper cuts and smaller openness when performing undercuts. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Borz|first=Stelian Alexandru|last2=Ignea|first2=Gheorghe|last3=Vasilescu|first3=Maria Magdalena|date=2014-10-02|title=Small Gains in Wood Recovery Rate when Disobeying the Recommended Motor-Manual Tree Felling Procedures: Another Reason to Use the Proper Technical Prescriptions|url=http://ojs.cnr.ncsu.edu/index.php/BioRes/article/view/BioRes_09_4_6938_Borz_Small_Gains_Wood_Recovery_Rate|journal=BioResources|language=en|volume=9|issue=4|pages=6938–6949|doi=10.15376/biores.9.4.6938-6949|issn=1930-2126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of Cut ==

=== Undercut ===
This is the guiding or aiming slot for the tree and is a V-shaped notch placed on the side of the tree in the direction of the falling. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://extension2.missouri.edu/g1958|title=Felling, Limbing and Bucking Trees|website=extension2.missouri.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are two types of undercut: 

# Standard Undercut
# Reverse Undercut

=== Back Cut ===
This cut is made on the opposite side of the tree and is helpful in the process of felling by releasing the stress on the back of the tree. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Boom - Corridor Experiment ==
This was an experiment conducted regarding felling trees and the continuous felling of trees in boom-corridors which might lead to an increase in harvester productivity. An efficient way to do this would be to use felling heads which would increase efficiency and fall time. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bergström|first=Dan|last2=Bergsten|first2=Urban|last3=Hörnlund|first3=Thomas|last4=Nordfjell|first4=Tomas|date=July 2012|title=Continuous felling of small diameter trees in boom-corridors with a prototype felling head|url=https://www-tandfonline-com.ezproxy.uky.edu/doi/full/10.1080/02827581.2012.663404?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true|journal=Scandinavian Journal of Forest Research|volume=27|issue=5|pages=474–480|doi=10.1080/02827581.2012.663404|issn=0282-7581}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was first launched to the public in the Netherlands, and received the "2006 [[International Van of the Year]]" award by an international jury from 19 countries. In Singapore, a 1.4 litre LAV variant is marketed as the '''Fiat Panorama''' in five and seven seater versions.&lt;ref name="fiat.com.sg"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fiat.com.sg/panorama_carinfo.asp |title=Fiat Panorama |accessdate=2008-01-04 |publisher=fiat.com.sg |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071230062000/http://www.fiat.com.sg/panorama_carinfo.asp |archivedate=2007-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Doblò was sold in January 2001.

The Doblò carries a payload of up to {{convert|730|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, with an interior volume of {{convert|3.2|m3|cuft}}. The Doblò uses [[Fiat Strada]]'s platform, in turn derived from the [[Fiat Palio]]'s one, using a rigid axle with leaf springs at the rear, instead of a torsion beam with coil springs as on the Palio.&lt;ref name="carsfromitaly.net" /&gt;

It is manufactured by Fiat's [[Tofaş]] subsidiary factory in Bursa, Turkey, in Brazil since 2002 and in Russia and Vietnam. Turkish models have an engine range that includes a 1.4 litre petrol, a 1.9 litre [[MultiJet]], and a 16 valve 1.3 litre MultiJet.

In North Korea, [[Pyonghwa Motors]] produces Doblò branded as its own name Ppeokkugi.&lt;ref name="rickross.com"&gt;{{cite web |title=Pyonghwa Motors, Unification Church Do a Deal |publisher=Ross Institute |url=http://www.culteducation.com/reference/unif/unif208.html |accessdate=2008-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The facelift version came in October 2005, and was restyled with modifications to the front and rear light groups, and the total design of the front part.

=== Brazilian Doblò ===
Launched in 2002, the Brazilian Doblòs were initially available with two 16 valve petrol engines, a 1.3 litre [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|Fire]] and a 1.6 litre [[Fiat 128 SOHC engine|Torque]]. From 2004 to 2009, the only engine available in Brazil was an 8 valve 1.8 litre ''Ecotec'', supplied by [[General Motors do Brasil]]. This engine was produced initially in a petrol version, and later as [[Flexible-fuel vehicle|flex fuel]].

In September 2003, Fiat Brazil introduced an off road 4x2 version called '''Fiat Doblò Adventure''', also with the [[straight-4]] ''Ecotec'' 1800 cc engine. It has revised exterior look with bigger bumpers and mouldings and raised ride height {{convert|6|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} and spare wheel on the rear.&lt;ref name="italiaspeed.com"&gt;{{cite web |title=25.09.2003 FIAT BRAZIL INTRODUCE OFF-ROAD DOBLÒ ADVENTURE |url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/new_models/new_models_2003/doblo_adventure/doblo_adventure.html |accessdate=2008-01-04 |publisher=italiaspeed.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2009, the whole '''Adventure''' line (Doblò, [[Fiat Idea|Idea]], [[Fiat Strada|Strada]] and [[Fiat Palio Weekend|Palio Weekend]]) was equipped with a [[locking differential]]. The line was rebadged as '''Adventure Locker'''. Only in the model year of 2010, the Brazilian Doblò and the Doblò Adventure were updated with the European facelift of 2005. 

Besides the 1.8 litre ''Powertrain'', Doblò is now equipped with a 1.4 litre [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|Fire]] [[Flexible-fuel vehicle|flex]] engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.uol.com.br/bestcars/testes3/fiat-doblo-2010-1.htm |title=Best Cars Web Site – Avaliação – Fiat Doblò 2010 |publisher=.uol.com.br |accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the model year of 2011, the 8 valve 1.8 litre ''Ecotec'' engine was replaced by the brand new 16 valve 1.8 litre ''[[Fiat E.torQ engine|E.torQ]]'' engine, produced by [[Fiat Powertrain Technologies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.uol.com.br/bestcars/un13/331-fiat-doblo-siena-2011.htm |title=Best Cars Web Site – Fiat adota motor E-Torq no Doblò e altera detalhes no Siena 2011 |publisher=.uol.com.br |accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electric versions ===
[[Micro-Vett]] Fiat Doblò has three battery versions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.micro-vett.it |title=Micro-Vett SpA veicoli elettrici |publisher=Micro-vett.it |date=2009-06-30 |accessdate=2009-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Go Green, an 18 [[kWh]] [[Altairnano]] [[lithium-ion]] [[NanoSafe]] battery pack. The battery pack can be fully recharged in less than ten minutes using [[AeroVironment]]'s high voltage, 125&amp;nbsp;kW rated, rapid charging system.
* a 43 kWh lead acid battery pack, providing a range of {{convert|150|km|mi|abbr=on}} in the urban duty cycle on a single charge; recharging takes 5–8 hours
* 60 x 200 AH 3.6V lithium modules; Battery life: 1000 cycles at 80% DOD / 2000 cycles at 70% DOD

The vehicle uses a 30 [[kW]] (60&amp;nbsp;kW peak) motor from Ansaldo Electric Drives, that gives {{convert|120|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} top speed.

On October 2, 2007, a sixty day demonstration of the All-Electric Fiat Doblo was begun. The Electric engine is powered by a custom 18 kWh Altairnano high performance NanoSafe(R) battery pack, travelled {{convert|300|km|mi}} in an urban delivery circuit.

The custom battery pack was fully recharged in less than ten minutes a total of three times using AeroViroments' high voltage, 125&amp;nbsp;kW rated, rapid charging system. The vehicle was driven an estimated total of {{convert|7500|km|mi}} during the sixty day demonstration period, which translates to an annual equivalent use of {{convert|45000|km|mi}}.{{Clear}}

The all new Doblò (Type 263) was launched in the beginning of 2010, and it is built in [[Turkey]] by [[Tofaş]]. The 2010 Doblò uses the [[GM Fiat Small platform|Fiat Small platform]], derived from the [[Grande Punto]], with a new bi link independent rear suspension instead of a torsion beam, which has {{Convert|2755|mm|in|1|sing=on}} wheelbase, {{Convert|790|L|cuft|sing=on}} luggage compartment, and low [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] emissions (129 g/km with the 1.3 [[JTD engine|Multijet]] {{Convert|90|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} engine).&lt;ref name="italiaspeed.com3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2009/cars/fiat/11/new_doblo/1611.html |title=16.11.2009 New MODEL: NEW Fiat Doblò Cargo/Panorama |accessdate=2009-11-19 |publisher=italiaspeed.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Doblò is also sold by General Motors European [[Opel]] and [[Vauxhall]] brands as Combo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fiat launches the Doblò Work Up. |url=http://europeancarnews.com/2011/07/04/fiat-launches-the-doblo-work-up/ |publisher=European Car News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These two features are combined for the Fiat Doblò Cargo XL, a high roofed, long wheelbase panel van model, with a one tonne payload, equipped with the {{convert|105|hp|kW|abbr=on}} 1.6 litre Multijet common rail diesel. The XL, which can carry as much as the bigger and more expensive [[Fiat Scudo|Scudo]], was presented in the United Kingdom in May 2013.&lt;ref name=Bvans&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.businessvans.co.uk/fiat-doblo-van-review-the-chunky-funky-big-small-van/ | title = Fiat Doblo Cargo XL van review – the chunky funky big small van | last = Witherington | first = Peter | work = Business Vans | publisher = Business Car Manager | date = 2013-05-21 | accessdate = 2013-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ram ProMaster City ===
[[File:2015 Ram ProMaster City Tradesman Cargo Van, front left.jpg|thumb|left|A 2015 Ram ProMaster City Tradesman Cargo Van (US)]]

The Ram ProMaster City (Type 636) is an Americanised version of the Fiat Doblò introduced in the model year of 2015, to succeed the [[Dodge Caravan]] based C/V Tradesman. The ProMaster City is built in the same plant in Turkey as the Doblò but is imported to North America. 

To circumvent the [[chicken tax]], only passenger vans are imported into North America, with cargo vans being post import conversions.

Unlike the Doblò, passenger versions of the ProMaster City use solid metal panels instead of glass in its rear quarters, and third row seating and the lift tailgate options are not offered. The 2.4 litre [[World Gasoline Engine#2.4 2|Tigershark]] engine mated to the [[ZF 9HP transmission|948TE]] nine speed automatic transmission is the only power train available for the ProMaster City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caranddriver.com/news/2015-ram-promaster-city-photos-and-info-news 2015 Ram ProMaster City: The Ram-PMC Is a True Rock Box]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Filter capacitors''' are [[capacitor]]s used for filtering of undesirable frequencies. They are common in electrical and electronic equipment, and cover a number of applications, such as:
* Glitch removal on [[Direct current]] (DC) power rails
* [[Radio frequency interference]] (RFI) removal for signal or power lines entering or leaving equipment
* Capacitors used after a [[voltage regulator]] to further smooth [[power supply|dc power supplies]]
* Capacitors used in audio, [[intermediate frequency]] (IF) or [[radio frequency]] (RF) [[electronic filter|frequency filters]] (e.g. low pass, high pass, notch, etc.)
* [[Arc suppression]], such as across the [[contact breaker]] or 'points' in a [[spark-ignition engine]]

Filter capacitors are not the same as [[reservoir capacitor]]s, the tasks the two perform are different, albeit related.

==Types==
Many filtering tasks have specific types of capacitor that are required or typically used for the task.

===High-pass and low-pass filters===
{{See|High-pass filter|Low-pass filter}}

===Power rail filtering===
[[Electrolytic capacitor]]s are usually used due to high capacity at low cost and low size. Smaller non-electrolytics may be paralleled with these to compensate for electrolytics' poor performance at high frequencies.

===Radio frequency work===
[[Ceramic capacitor|Ceramic plate capacitors]] are usually favoured due to extremely low inductance and low cost. Where precision is needed, [[silver mica capacitor]]s offer superior precision and stability. Where manual tunability is required, plastic film trimmers are sometimes used, though it has long been more popular to adjust the [[inductor]] to achieve [[Tuned filter|tuning]].

==== Ultra High Frequency-UHF====
Disc and plate ceramic capacitors are used due to particularly low [[inductor|inductance]]. Often a ceramic disc sits in a notch cut in the PCB, with the tracks soldered directly to the disc for best performance.

====Microwave====
At [[microwave]] frequencies, the (FR4) [[Printed circuit board]] (PCB) material acts as a capacitor, and the PCB track has inherent inductance. The net result depends on the ratio of capacitance and inductance present.

Increasing PCB track width causes additional capacitance, and thus a net capacitance. Narrowing track width reduces capacitance, produces a net inductance.

===Computer power rail filtering===
[[Computer]]s use large numbers of filter capacitors, making size an important factor. Solid tantalum and wet tantalum capacitors offer some of the best CV (capacitance/voltage) performance in some of the most volumetrically efficient packaging available.  High currents and low voltages also make low [[equivalent series resistance]] (ESR) important. [[Solid tantalum capacitor]]s offer low ESR versions that can often meet ESR requirements but they are not the lowest ESR option among all capacitors. Solid tantalums have an additional issue which must be addressed during the design stage.  Solid tantalum capacitors must be voltage derated in all applications.  A 50% voltage derating is recommended and generally accepted as the industry standard; e.g.:  A 50V solid tantalum capacitor should never be exposed to an actual application voltage above 25V.  Solid tantalum capacitors are very reliable components if the proper care is taken and all design guidelines are carefully followed.  Unfortunately, the failure mechanism for a solid tantalum capacitor is a short which will result in a violent flaring up and smoking on a PCB capable of damaging other components in close proximity as well as completely destroying the capacitor.  Fortunately, most solid tantalum capacitor failures will be immediate and very evident.  Once in application solid tantalum capacitor performance will improve over time and the chances of a failure due to component mis-manufacturing decrease.  Wet tantalums are a type of the electrolytic capacitor, using a tantalum pellet in an electrolytic material sealed in a hermetic package.  This type of tantalum capacitor does not require the same derating that a solid tantalum does and its failure mechanism is open.  A 10% to 20% voltage derating curve is recommended for wet tantalums when operating from 85C to 125C.  Wet tantalums are not commonly referred to as just 'electrolytics' because usually 'electrolytic' refers to aluminium electrolytics.

===Lowest cost===
Ceramic (for values &lt;0.47 micro-[[farad]]-µF) and electrolytic (for 0.47 µF and up) are normally the preferred types where their performance is sufficient, since these are the lowest cost types of capacitors. Hence they are very popular in filters of many types.

===Mains filtering===
Mains filter capacitors are usually encapsulated wound plastic film types, since these deliver high voltage rating at low cost, and may be made self healing and fusible.
Mains filter capacitors are often [[ceramic capacitor#RFI/EMI suppression ceramic capacitors | ceramic RFI/EMI suppression capacitors]].
The additional safety requirements for mains filtering are:
* Line to neutral capacitors are flame retardant, and in Europe are required to use class X dielectrics
* Line or neutral to earth: Must be flame retardant; also, the dielectric must be self healing and fusible. In Europe these are class Y capacitors.

===Contact suppression===
A wound plastic film mains rated capacitor plus series [[resistor]] are incorporated into a single component envelope for convenience and robustness. This reduces [[switch]] arcing and [[Electromagnetic interference|RFI]]. The most common combination of values is 0.1 µF + 100 Ω.

===DC motor suppression===
Ceramic disc capacitors are usually used in [[snubber]] circuits for [[Brushed DC electric motor|low voltage motor]]s for their low [[inductance]] and low cost.

===Switched mode power supply filtering===
Low ESR (equivalent series resistance) electrolytics are often required to handle the high [[ripple (electrical)|ripple current]].

A '''firelog''' is a manufactured log constructed to be used as [[wood fuel]].  Firelogs are designed to be inexpensive, while being easier to ignite, and burn longer, and more efficiently than [[firewood]].  Firelogs are traditionally manufactured using two methods.  The first uses only  compressed [[sawdust]] and the second uses sawdust and [[Paraffin wax|paraffin]], which is mixed and extruded into a log shape. The extruded firelogs are individually wrapped in paper packaging which can be ignited to start burning the firelog as the paraffin is readily combustible.

A new cleaner firelog has now been developed using waste fibre from the [[oil palm]] fruit bunches of South East Asia.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} Unlike sawdust logs these burn with zero [[sulfur]] emissions. Also unlike [[sawdust]] logs, no trees need to be felled to produce these firelogs{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}. While it is beneficial that the oil palm derived logs use waste fibre, the overall impact of palm oil plantations is problematic because vast areas of virgin tropical rain forest in [[Borneo]] and [[Sumatra]] are being [[clear cut]] to open up land for palm plantations. This activity directly threatens habitats of endangered species such as the [[orangutan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE EFFECTS OF PALM OIL HOW DOES PALM OIL HARM ORANGUTANS AND OTHER WILDLIFE?|url=http://orangutan.org/rainforest/the-effects-of-palm-oil/|publisher=Orangutan Foundation International|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other new types of firelogs include one made from waste wax-cardboard such as that used in the packing of perishable foods for shipment, which is used to create a compressed cardboard firelog, and another made from renewable Greek cotton plants, offering a high energy content.

The materials used for a traditional firelog are variable, the sawdust used is often commercial wood waste from manufacturers, or waste agricultural biomass (nut shells, fruit pits, etc.); additionally bio-wax may be used in lieu of paraffin (petroleum-based wax).

There are now a number of wood and wax firelogs made using renewable materials. These are made using plant or animal based renewable waxes such as palm oil. These logs can be considered to be carbon neutral firelogs during combustion as the carbon released on combustion is the same carbon absorbed when the plants are growing.
Sulphur emissions are virtually eliminated with renewable firelogs as they do not contain paraffin waxes.

'''George Kerevan''' (born 28 September 1949) is a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] journalist, economist, and [[Scottish National Party]] politician. He was the [[Member of parliament#United Kingdom|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[East Lothian (UK Parliament constituency)|East Lothian]] from 2015, until he lost his seat at the snap 2017 general election.

==Early life and education==
Born in [[Glasgow]], Kerevan was educated at Kingsridge Secondary School in Knightswood and the [[University of Glasgow]], graduating with a [[British undergraduate degree classification|First-class]] [[Master of Arts (Scotland)|MA]] degree in [[political economy]].&lt;ref name="EN 9May2015"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/midlothian-elects-owen-thompson-as-council-leader-1-3194409 |title=SNP brings seismic shift to Edinburgh politics |first=Ian |last=Swanson |work=[[Edinburgh Evening News|Evening News]] |publisher=[[Johnston Press]] |date=9 May 2015 |accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Kerevan held academic posts at [[Edinburgh Napier University|Napier College]], including Senior Lecturer in Economics, from 1975–2000, specialising in [[energy economics]]. He was associate editor of ''[[The Scotsman]]'' from 2000 to 2009,&lt;ref name="EN 9May2015" /&gt; and was the chief executive of What If Productions (Television) Ltd. He is co-organiser of the Prestwick World Festival of Flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/heritage/people-places/twin-pin-planes-to-fly-for-scottish-homecoming-trip-1-2821216 |title=Twin Pin planes to fly for Scottish homecoming trip |first=Alastair |last=Dalton |work=The Scotsman |date=6 March 2013 |accessdate=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
Kerevan was a member of the [[International Marxist Group]], a [[Trotskyist]] group, between 1972-77.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://redlug.com/cwi/DefendSoc.htm|title=Defending a socialist programme|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later served as a [[Scottish Labour Party|Labour]] councillor in [[Edinburgh]] from 1984–1996. In 1996, he left Labour to join the Scottish National Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Denver|first=DT|title=Scotland decides: the devolution issue and the 1997 referendum|publisher=Routledge|year=2000|isbn=978-0-7146-5053-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EDTrBxO3_xgC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=%22George+Kerevan%22&amp;lr=&amp;hl=sv&amp;cd=20#v=onepage&amp;q=%22George%20Kerevan%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to stand unsuccessfully as the SNP candidate for [[Edinburgh East (UK Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh East]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 UK general election]], as well as an SNP candidate in the [[Lothian (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|Lothian region]] in the [[Scottish Parliament election, 2011|2011 Scottish Parliament election]].

Kerevan eventually stood successfully as the SNP candidate for [[East Lothian (UK Parliament constituency)|East Lothian]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 UK general election]]. He won 25,104 votes, a majority of 6,803, and unseated the then-incumbent Labour MP [[Fiona O'Donnell]]. He was a member of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] [[Treasury Select Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/treasury-committee/membership/ |title=Treasury Committee - membership |publisher=House of Commons |date=8 July 2015 |accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently lost his seat in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017 snap election]] to [[Martin Whitfield]] of the Labour Party, who won with a majority of 3,083 votes over Kerevan.

==Selected works==
He is the co-author, with [[Alan Cochrane]], of ''Scottish Independence: Yes or No'', published in April 2014.

The '''Great Blizzard of 1888''' or '''Great Blizzard of '88''' (March 11&amp;nbsp;– March 14, 1888) was one of the most severe recorded [[blizzard]]s in the history of the United States of America. The storm, referred to as the '''Great White Hurricane''', paralyzed the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] from the [[Chesapeake Bay]] to [[Maine]],&lt;ref name=Christiano&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nycsubway.org/articles/1888-blizzard.html |title=The Blizzard of 1888; the Impact of this Devastating Storm on New York Transit}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= noaa/&gt; as well as the [[Atlantic Canada|Atlantic provinces of Canada]].&lt;ref name=douglas /&gt;   Snowfalls of {{convert|10|to|58|in|cm}} fell in parts of [[New Jersey]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Rhode Island]], and [[Connecticut]], and sustained winds of more than {{convert|45|mph|km/h|0}} produced [[snowdrift]]s in excess of {{convert|50|ft|m}}.  Railroads were shut down, and people were confined to their houses for up to a week.&lt;ref name=douglas&gt;{{cite book | last = Douglas | first = Paul | title = Restless Skies | publisher = [[Barnes &amp; Noble|Barnes &amp; Noble Publishing, Inc]]. | year = 2004 | pages = 12–13 | isbn = 0-7607-6113-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Railway and [[Electrical telegraph|telegraph]] lines were disabled, and this provided the impetus to move these pieces of [[undergrounding|infrastructure underground]]. Emergency services were also affected.

==Storm details==
[[File:Blizzard 1888 01.jpg|thumb|left|Streets in New York City as the storm hit. Many overhead wires broke and presented a hazard to city dwellers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Building the invisible city |publisher=Virtual New York |url=http://www.vny.cuny.edu/blizzard/building/building.html |accessdate=2007-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Brooklyn Bridge snowy.jpg|thumb|left|[[Brooklyn Bridge]] during the blizzard]]

The weather preceding the blizzard was unseasonably mild with heavy rains that turned to snow as temperatures dropped rapidly.&lt;ref name=douglas /&gt;
The storm began in earnest shortly after midnight on March 12 and continued unabated for a full day and a half.  The [[National Weather Service]] estimated this [[Nor'easter]] dumped as much as {{convert|50|in|cm}} of snow in parts of Connecticut and Massachusetts, while parts of New Jersey and New York had up to {{convert|40|in|cm}}.&lt;ref name= noaa&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/mkx/climate/big.php |title=Biggest Snowstorms in the United States: From 1888 to Present |accessdate=2007-12-21 |format= |work=NWS Milwaukee/Sullivan, WI|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070324154647/http://www.crh.noaa.gov/mkx/climate/big.php|archivedate=24 March 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of northern Vermont received from {{convert|20|in|cm}} to {{convert|30|in|cm}} in this storm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www5.ncdc.noaa.gov/climatenormals/clim60/states/Clim_VT_01.pdf |title=Climate of Vermont |accessdate=2007-12-21 |format=pdf |work=National Climatic Data Center |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229021750/http://www5.ncdc.noaa.gov/climatenormals/clim60/states/Clim_VT_01.pdf |archivedate=2008-02-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drifts were reported to average {{convert|30|–|40|ft|m}}, over the tops of houses from New York to New England, with reports of drifts covering three-story houses.  The highest drift ({{convert|52|ft|m|disp=or}}) was recorded in [[Gravesend, Brooklyn|Gravesend, New York]]. It was reported that {{convert|58|in|cm}} of snow fell in [[Saratoga Springs, New York]]; {{convert|48|in|cm}} in [[Albany, New York]]; {{convert|45|in|cm}} of snow in [[New Haven, Connecticut]]; and {{convert|22|in|cm}} of snow in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=NCDC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/blizzard/blizz.txt |title= The Big One!

==Impacts==
In New York, neither rail nor road transport was possible anywhere for days,&lt;ref name=Christiano/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nycsubway.org/articles/1888-blizzard.html |title=The Blizzard of 1888; the Impact of this Devastating Storm on New York Transit}}&lt;/ref&gt; and drifts across the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad|New York–New Haven rail line]] at [[Westport, Connecticut]], took [[New Haven Line#History|eight days]] to clear. Transportation gridlock as a result of the storm was partially responsible for the creation of the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|first underground subway]] system in the United States, which opened nine years later in Boston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.massmoments.com/moment.cfm?mid=77 |title=Blizzard shuts down Massachusetts |publisher=Massachusetts Foundation for the Humanities |quote=Perhaps the most important legacy of the Blizzard of 1888 was the Boston subway system.  Alarmed by the paralysis and economic damage the storm caused, Boston decided to build a subway.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nycsubway.org/articles/1888-blizzard.html |title=The Blizzard of 1888; the Impact of this Devastating Storm on New York Transit |quote=There is no overstating the significant impact this tragedy had on the metropolis, especially on transportation.  The resulting standstill on the elevated lines resulted in the city adopting a plan to build subways.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[New York Stock Exchange]] was closed for two days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE SPECIAL CLOSINGS, 1885–date |url=https://www.nyse.com/pdfs/closings.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070925210452/http://www.nyse.com/pdfs/closings.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, telegraph [[infrastructure]] was disabled, isolating [[Montreal]] and most of the large northeastern U.S. cities from [[Washington, D.C.]] to Boston for days.  Following the storm, New York began placing its telegraph and telephone infrastructure underground to prevent their destruction.

[[Fire station]]s were immobilized, and property loss from fire alone was estimated at $25&amp;nbsp;million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|25|1888|r=-1}} million in {{currentyear}}).&lt;ref name=Christiano/&gt;
The blizzard resulted in the founding of the [[Christman Bird and Wildlife Sanctuary]] located near [[Delanson, New York]].

From Chesapeake Bay through the [[New England]] area, more than 200 ships were either grounded or wrecked, resulting in the deaths of at least 100 seamen.&lt;ref name=NCDC/&gt; More than 400 people died from the storm and the ensuing cold, including 200 in New York City alone.&lt;ref name=NCDC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/iwx/program_areas/wxhisttdy/index.php?url=Mar12 |title=On Mar 12 in weather history |accessdate=2007-12-21 |format= |work=NWS Northern Indiana Weather History }}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts were made to push the snow into the Atlantic Ocean. Severe flooding occurred after the storm due to melting snow, especially in the [[Brooklyn]] area, which was susceptible to flooding because of its topography.&lt;ref name=NCDC/&gt;

Not all areas were notably affected by the Blizzard of 1888; an article in the ''Cambridge Press'' published five days after the storm noted that the "fall of snow in this vicinity was comparatively small, and had it not been accompanied by a strong wind it would have been regarded as rather trifling in amount, the total depth, on a level, not exceeding ten inches".&lt;ref&gt;[http://cambridge.dlconsulting.com/cgi-bin/cambridge?a=d&amp;d=Press18880317-01.2.16&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN------ "The Great Storm"] ''Cambridge Press'', Cambridge, MA, 17 March 1888. Retrieved 29 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roscoe Conkling]], an influential [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] politician, died as a result of the storm.

The '''Guimaras oil spill''' occurred in the [[Panay Gulf]] on August 11, 2006 when the [[oil tanker]] M/T ''Solar 1'' sank off the coast of [[Guimaras]] and [[Negros (island)|Negros]] islands in the [[Philippines]], causing what is considered as the worst [[oil spill]] in the country.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|title=Oil spill threatens Philippines|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4795649.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=15 July 2013|author=Sarah Toms|date=15 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="inq7-1"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://newsinfo.inq7.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=16764| title = Arroyo forms task force to oversee oil spill cleanup| publisher = [[INQ7.net]]| date = 2006-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2017}}
The [[oil tanker]] M/T ''Solar 1'', carrying more than two million liters of [[bunker fuel]], sank during a violent storm approximately {{convert|20.5|km}} off the southern coast of [[Guimaras]] at around
midnight on August 11, 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper | author = Arias, de la Cruz, Guillergan &amp; Presaldo | title = Responding to an Oil Spill Disaster: Data Management Support for the Rehabilitation of Guimaras Island, Philippines | publisher = International Society for Environmental Information Sciences | date = 2006 | url = http://www.iseis.org/EIA/pdfstart.asp?no=07024 | format = PDF | accessdate = 2013-05-24 | journal =  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140812024022/http://www.iseis.org/EIA/pdfstart.asp?no=07024 | archive-date = 2014-08-12 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; causing some {{convert|500000|l}} of oil to pour into the gulf, that traveled up through the [[Guimaras Strait]] and [[Iloilo Strait]]. [[Siphon]]ing the remaining 1.5 million liters from the sunken tanker, at a depth of more than {{convert|600|m}}, was scheduled for March 2007.

The oil spill adversely affected [[Marine sanctuary|marine sanctuaries]] and [[mangrove]] [[nature reserve|reserves]] in three out of five [[Municipalities of the Philippines|municipalities]] in Guimaras Island and reached the shores of [[Iloilo]] and [[Negros Occidental]]. The oil spill occurred in the Guimaras Strait that connects the [[Visayan Sea]] with the [[Sulu Sea]], and is considered a rich fishing ground that supplies most of the demand for the entire country. (NDCC, August 2006)

[[Haribon Foundation|Haribon]] sent two biologists to Guimaras to assess the damage and talk to the affected communities regarding their immediate needs. Haribon provided assistance particularly for the long-term rehabilitation of the area. The government evacuated the affected families who had been exposed to the toxic elements of the [[crude oil]]. According to reports gathered in the field, people contracted skin diseases associated with these elements.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

==Causes==
Several causes have been cited, including bad weather and [[human error]]. Allegations have been made stating that the tanker only had a capacity of 1.2 million liters, implying the possibility of overloading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://coordination-maree-noire.eu/spip.php?article3881| title = Inquiry lists 3 factors behind Solar 1 sinking| publisher = The Manila Times| date = 2006-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other investigations have claimed that the ship's Captain was not qualified to sail the vessel.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

==Effects==
[[File:Oil Spill 2 (Nueva Valencia, Guimaras).jpg|250px|thumbnail|left|The Taklong Island National Marine Reserve was severely damaged. This bird was rescued in one of the mangroves being cleaned up.]]
The spill damaged [[Taklong Island National Marine Reserve]], a marine sanctuary for feeding and breeding ground for fish and other species.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;  The oil slick also posed a threat to the [[Portunus pelagicus|blue crab]] industry in the municipality of [[Enrique B. Magalona, Negros Occidental|Enrique B. Magalona]] in [[Negros Occidental]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/bac/2006/08/23/news/slick.to.ruin.blue.crabs.habitat.in.eb.magalona.html| title = Slick to ruin blue crabs habitat in EB Magalona| publisher = Sun.Star Bacolod| date = 2006-08-23| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060829144205/http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/bac/2006/08/23/news/slick.to.ruin.blue.crabs.habitat.in.eb.magalona.html| archivedate = 2006-08-29| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Jose Ingles, eco-region coordinator of the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] in the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia, said that the damage may be felt by at least two generations. He warned that the disaster may have damaged the reefs and mangroves, scarring the ecosystem and causing seafood yields to significantly decrease. According to him, the worst hit would be the shorelines, the coasts and the swamplands with mangroves. This will greatly impact the livelihood of the fishermen, mostly living in poor conditions.&lt;ref name="inq7"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://newsinfo.inq7.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view_article.php?article_id=16966| title = ‘Sensitive habitats can be smothered by oil’ | publisher = INQ7.net| date = 2006-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the south-southeast of the spill site is located the [[Sulu Sea]], a deep-water area frequented by commercially valued fish such as [[Indo-Pacific blue marlin|blue marlin]] and the [[yellowfin tuna]], prized by the towns of southern Negros Occidental province as an important source of income for the communities. The oil slick may damage this thriving local industry.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

On August 22, 2006, the [[Philippine Coast Guard]] stated that the spill has affected 20 communities in 4 municipalities in Guimaras. It also threatened 27 communities in [[Iloilo province]] and 17 others in [[Negros Occidental]].&lt;ref name="sunstar-1"&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/bac/2006/08/23/news/governor.says.no.to.oil.sludge.disposal.in.guimaras.html| title = Governor says no to oil sludge disposal in Guimaras| publisher = Sun.Star Bacolod| date = 2006-08-23| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070717134931/http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/bac/2006/08/23/news/governor.says.no.to.oil.sludge.disposal.in.guimaras.html| archivedate = 2007-07-17| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Casualties==
A villager from Barangay Lapaz, [[Nueva Valencia, Guimaras]], became the first casualty directly affected by the spill.

==Response==
Due to the extent of the disaster, the cleanup was expected to reach three years.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

===Local response===
[[File:Oil Spill (Nueva Valencia, Guimaras).jpg|thumb|Cleanup in Barangay La Paz, [[Nueva Valencia, Guimaras]]]]
On August 19, the Philippine government has asked the governments of [[Indonesia]], [[Japan]] and the [[United States]] to help assist with the cleanup.&lt;ref name="inq7.net"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://newsinfo.inq7.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view_article.php?article_id=16179| title = RP sends SOS on oil spill US, Japan, Indonesia help sought

President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] created Task Force Guimaras on August 22 in order to oversee both the cleanup of the oil spill and the retrieval of the 1.5 million liters of [[fuel oil]] still remaining inside the tanker. The government also ordered the creation of the Special Board of Marine Inquiry to determine who and what caused the spill.&lt;ref name="inq7-1" /&gt;

[[Guimaras province|Guimaras]] Governor JC Rahman Nava has objected to the proposal of disposing the oil wastes within the province.&lt;ref name="sunstar-1" /&gt;

Clemente Cancio, President of Sunshine Maritime Development Corporation (SMDC), the company which owns M/T Solar I, said that their foreign insurer is willing to pay the cost of damage brought about by the oil spill.&lt;ref name="sunstar-1" /&gt;

President Gloria Arroyo ordered a full investigation into the country's worst oil spill that devastated marine ecosystems in the central Philippines. Arroyo also ordered the Justice Department to join a special task force heading an investigation and cleanup on the island of Guimaras, where some {{convert|300|km|mi|sp=us}} of coastline, including stretches of pristine beaches, had been affected by the oil slick from the sunken tanker. "We shall do everything in our power to right the wrongs caused by this unfortunate incident," Arroyo said after visiting the island, adding that she was deeply pained by the disaster that she declared a "national calamity".&lt;ref name="PhilStar report on Guimaras oil spill"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.philstar.com/philstar/NEWS_FLASH082620061737_12.htm | title = Arroyo vows to get to bottom of oil spill | publisher = PhilStar | date = 2006-08-26 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International response===
On August 17, [[United Kingdom|British]] oil experts, sent by SMDC's foreign insurer, arrived in Guimaras to assess the situation. SMDC stated that the experts will check the extent of the oil pollution. The Britons conducted an aerial survey over [[Guimaras Island]] and made recommendations based on their findings.&lt;ref name="GlobalNation"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://globalnation.inq7.net/news/news/view_article.php?article_id=15982| title = British experts to help with oil spill clean-up| publisher = INQ7.net| date = 2006-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="YahooBritishOil"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20060818/sc_afp/philippinesenvironmentshippingoil_060818061700| title = British experts to help with oil spill clean-up| publisher = YahooNews| date = 2006-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A four-man team from the [[U.S. Coast Guard]] arrived on August 23 to assist in determining the exact location of the tanker.&lt;ref name="sunstar-1" /&gt;

The '''hydrohelium(1+)''' cation, HeH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, also known as the '''helium hydride ion''' or '''helium-hydride molecular ion''', is a [[electric charge|positively charged]] [[ion (chemistry)|ion]] formed by the reaction of a [[proton]] with a [[helium]] [[atom]] in the [[gas phase]], first produced in the laboratory in 1925. It is [[isoelectronic]] with molecular [[hydrogen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=T. R. Hogness |author2=E. G.

==Properties==

HHe&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cannot be prepared in a [[condensed phase]], as it would [[protonate]] any anion, molecule or atom with which it were associated. However it is possible to estimate a ''hypothetical'' aqueous acidity using [[Hess's law]]:

:{|
|-
| HHe&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''g'') 
| → 
| H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''g'') 
| + He(''g'') 
| align=right|+178&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol
| &lt;ref name="Epa"/&gt;
|-
| HHe&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''aq'') 
| → 
| HHe&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''g'')
| &amp;nbsp;
| align=right|+973&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol
| &lt;ref&gt;Estimated to be the same as for Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''aq'') → Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''g'').&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''g'') 
| → 
| H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''aq'')

|}

A [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] change of dissociation of −360&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol is equivalent to a [[Acid dissociation constant|p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;]] of −63.

The length of the [[covalent bond]] in HeH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is 0.772 [[Ångstrom|Å]].&lt;ref name="Coyne"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Coyne| first = John P.|author2=Ball, David W.| title = Alpha particle chemistry.

The dihelium hydride cation is formed by the reaction of [[dihelium]] cation with molecular hydrogen:
:{{chem|He|2|+}} + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;.
He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is a linear ion with hydrogen in the centre.&lt;ref name=Gran004&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grandinetti|first1=Felice|title=Helium chemistry: a survey of the role of the ionic species|journal=International Journal of Mass Spectrometry|date=October 2004|volume=237|issue=2-3|pages=243–267|doi=10.1016/j.ijms.2004.07.012|bibcode=2004IJMSp.237..243G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
The helium hydride cation reacts with most substances. It has been shown to add a proton to [[Oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Ammonia|NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Sulfur dioxide|SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Water|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]], and [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], giving O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [[Ammonium|{{chem|NH|4|+}}]], {{chem|HSO|2|+}}, [[Hydronium|H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]], and {{chem|HCO|2|+}}.&lt;ref name=Gran004/&gt; Other molecules such as [[nitric oxide]], [[nitrogen dioxide]], [[nitrous oxide]], [[hydrogen sulfide]], [[methane]], [[acetylene]], [[ethylene]], [[ethane]], [[methanol]] and [[acetonitrile]] react but break up due to the large amount of energy produced.&lt;ref name=Gran004/&gt; One technique used to study reactions between organic substances and HeH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is to make a tritium derivative of the organic compound. Decay of tritium to &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; followed by its extraction of a hydrogen atom yields &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;HeH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; which is then surrounded by the organic material and will in turn react.&lt;ref name=Gran004/&gt;

Extra helium atoms can attach to HeH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to form larger clusters such as He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, He&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, He&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, He&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and He&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; which is particularly stable.&lt;ref name=Grand004&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grandinetti|first1=Felice|title=Helium chemistry: a survey of the role of the ionic species|journal=International Journal of Mass Spectrometry|date=October 2004|volume=237|issue=2–3|pages=243–267|doi=10.1016/j.ijms.2004.07.012|bibcode=2004IJMSp.237..243G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural occurrence==
The helium hydride ion is formed during the decay of [[tritium]] in the molecule HT or tritium molecule T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Although excited by the recoil from the beta decay, the molecule remains bound together.&lt;ref&gt;F Mannone: ''Safety in Tritium Handling Technology'' Springer 1993, p 92&lt;/ref&gt;

HeH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is thought to exist in the [[interstellar medium]], although it has not yet been unambiguously detected.&lt;ref name="EngelEtAl"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Engel| first = Elodie A.| authorlink = |author2=Doss, Natasha |author3=Harris, Gregory J. |author4=Tennyson, Jonathan| title = Calculated spectra for HeH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and its effect on the opacity of cool metal-poor stars| journal = Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society| volume = 357| issue = 2| pages = 471–477| year =2005| doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2966.2005.08611.x| bibcode=2005MNRAS.357..471E|arxiv = astro-ph/0411267 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed to be the first compound to have formed in the universe,&lt;ref name="EngelEtAl"/&gt; and is of fundamental importance in understanding the chemistry of the early universe.&lt;ref name="LiuEtAl"&gt;{{Cite journal

Stars formed from the primordial material should contain HeH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, which could influence their formation and subsequent evolution. In particular, its strong [[Molecular dipole moment|dipole moment]] makes it relevant to the opacity of [[Metallicity#Population III stars|zero-metallicity stars]].&lt;ref name="EngelEtAl"/&gt; HeH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is also thought to be an important constituent of the atmospheres of helium-rich white dwarfs, where it increases the opacity of the gas and causes the star to cool more slowly.&lt;ref name="HarrisEtAl"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Harris| first = G.J. |author2=Lynas-Gray, A.E. |author3=Miller, S. |author4=Tennyson, J.

HeH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; could be formed in the cooling gas behind dissociative shocks in dense interstellar clouds, such as the shocks caused by [[stellar wind]]s, [[supernova]]e and outflowing material from young stars. If the speed of the shock is greater than about 90&amp;nbsp;km/s, quantities large enough to detect might be formed.

'''''Hibiscus acetosella''''', the '''cranberry hibiscus''' or '''African rosemallow''', is an [[flowering plant]] of the genus ''[[Hibiscus]]'' or rosemallow. The word ''acetosella'' is of Latin origin and is derived from an old name for sorrel (Oxalis) which comes from the sour taste experienced when eating the young leaves of the plant.&lt;ref name="numberfive"&gt;Klingaman, Gerald (23 September 2011).

==Characteristics==

The foliage of cranberry hibiscus is similar to that of the Japanese maple. It has dicot leaves which vary in shape from 3-5-lobed to un-lobed or undivided in the upper leaves of the plant and are generally the size of a small child's hand, about 10×10&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name="Grubben2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="numberthree"&gt;[http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=HIAC3 "PLANTS Profile: ''Hibiscus acetosella'' Welw. ex Hiern. African rosemallow"]. United States Department of Agriculture.&lt;/ref&gt; They tend to be alternate, simple, and deeply cut with crenate or jagged edges.&lt;ref name="numberfive"/&gt; Leaf color is observed as a dark maroon to a patchy red/green appearance. Stipules are linear, measured approximately 1.5&amp;nbsp;cm in length.&lt;ref name="Grubben2004"/&gt; Both stems and petioles (3–11&amp;nbsp;cm in length) are smooth or generally free from hair.&lt;ref name="Grubben2004"/&gt; Acetosella is further divided into a section called Furcaria, which is a group of approximately 100 species that have non-fleshy calyx or sepals.&lt;ref name="Grubben2004"/&gt; The sepals contain 10 veins, 5 of which run to the apices of the segments; the other 5 run to the sinuses.&lt;ref name="Grubben2004"/&gt; Stems tend to be variegated.&lt;ref name="Numberone"/&gt; Flowers are solitary and sit atop a 1&amp;nbsp;cm long pedicel. They vary in color and are most often the dark maroon that is characteristic of the foliage with darker vein-like markings. Flowers are rarely yellow in color and are about 5&amp;nbsp;cm {2 inches} deep. Each flower contains numerous stamens at about 2&amp;nbsp;cm in length.&lt;ref name="Grubben2004"/&gt; The cranberry hibiscus is bisexual and is thought to be self-pollinating. It produces seeds that are reniform and dark brown with dimensions of 3×2.5&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name="Grubben2004"/&gt;

== Genetics ==

''Hibiscus acetosella'' is an allotetraploid [2n = 4x = 72] with a genome composition of AABB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Contreras, Ryan N., Ruter, John M. and Hanna, Wayne W. |journal=Journal of the American Society for Horticultural Science|title=An Oryzalin-induced Autoallooctoploid of ''Hibiscus Acetosella'' 'Panama Red' |url=http://journal.ashspublications.org/content/134/5/553.abstract|volume= 134 |issue= 5 |pages=553–559}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often used to transfer genetic resistance to root-knot nematodes with compatible Hibiscus species. Cranberry hibiscus is often grown after tomatoes and potatoes and related species of which are not resistant to nematodes&lt;ref name="Grubben2004"/&gt;

== Origin ==

''Hibiscus acetosella'' is thought to have come about via hybridization between ''Hibiscus asper Hook.f.'' and ''Hibiscus surattensis L.'' secondary to their cultivation.&lt;ref name="Grubben2004"/&gt; It was first recognized in 1896 by French botanists as a distinct plant and given the name it currently has. The plant was probably first found growing around African villages in the southern DR Congo-Angola-Zambia region. The crop was brought to Brazil and South-East Asia where it was most likely used as sustenance for slaves.&lt;ref name="Grubben2004"/&gt; It is now considered more popular in Brazil than its original location in Africa, where it is now regularly cultivated and eaten as a spinach-like green.

== Living conditions ==

Cranberry hibiscus is cultivated in medium altitudes in areas of high rainfall although it does do fairly well in droughts.&lt;ref name="Grubben2004"/&gt; It requires moist soil with good drainage and a range of partial shade to full sun exposure.&lt;ref name="Grubben2004"/&gt; The plant does well in slightly acidic conditions with a soil pH between 6.1 and 6.5.&lt;ref name="numberfour"&gt;[http://edibleplantproject.org/cranberryhibiscus/ "Cranberry Hibiscus (Hibiscus acetosella, False roselle, African rosemallow)."] Edibleplantproject.org.&lt;/ref&gt; Cranberry hibiscus tends to flower late in season when days are shorter. Flowers open for a few hours during the late fall to early winter at midday.&lt;ref name="Numberone"/&gt; Although the plant itself remains in bloom for a few weeks, once open, a flower remains so for just one day. Plants typically succumb to cold weather in the Midwest prior to flowers appearing

== Growing at home ==

Seeds germinate easily within 3–4 days in a container but tend to grow rapidly. Light is not required for germination. Cranberry hibiscus propagates well with cuttings, which will take root in soil or water.&lt;ref name="Numberone"/&gt; The plant can be maintained in an oval form by pinching or cutting it back during the summer. Otherwise, it will have one dominant stem.&lt;ref name="numberfive"/&gt;

== Edible properties ==

Cranberry hibiscus is mostly known for its slightly sour or pleasantly tart young leaves which are commonly used as a vegetable, either raw or cooked. In South America, the leaves are used sparingly in salads and stir-fries. Leaves are eaten in small quantities due to acid content and because they are mucilaginous. Cranberry hibiscus leaves also contribute to the décor of various dishes since they retain their color after being cooked.&lt;ref name="numberfour"/&gt;
 
Flowers are used to make teas or other drinks where they contribute color rather than taste. In Central America the flowers are combined with ice, sugar, lemon, or lime juice and water to make a purple lemonade.&lt;ref name="Grubben2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="numberfour"/&gt;

The root is edible however thought of as fibrous and distasteful.&lt;ref name="Grubben2004"/&gt; Contrary to similar species such as the ''[[Hibiscus sabdariffa]]'', the calyx or sepals of ''Hibiscus acetosella'' is non-fleshy and not eaten.&lt;ref name="numberfour"/&gt; In Angola a tea made from the leaves of cranberry hibiscus are used as a post-fever tonic and to treat anemia.&lt;ref name="Grubben2004"/&gt; The plant is also utilized to treat myalgias by crushing leaves into cold water to bathe children.&lt;ref name="Grubben2004"/&gt; The plant is thought to contain [[polyphenols]], a compound that may combat inflammation and is commonly used to treat inflammatory diseases.&lt;ref name ="number 6"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Tsumbu CN, Deby-Dupont G, Tits M, Angenot L, Frederich M, Kohnen S, Mouithys-Mickalad A, Serteyn D, Franck T |title=Polyphenol Content and Modulatory Activities of Some Tropical Dietary Plant Extracts on the Oxidant Activities of Neutrophils and Myeloperoxidase|journal= International Journal of Molecular Sciences|year= 2012|volume= 13|issue=1|pages=628–650|doi=10.3390/ijms13010628|pmid=22312276|pmc=3269710}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Home Energy Saver''' is a set of on&amp;ndash;line resources developed by the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] at the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] intended to help consumers and professional energy analysts, analyze, reduce, and manage home energy use.&lt;ref name="Tyghe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2008/may/31-would-al-gore-call-you-naughty-or-nice|title=Would Al Gore Call You Naughty or Nice?|last=Trimble|first=Tyghe|date=March 31, 2008|publisher=Kalmbach Publishing Co.|accessdate=2 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Home Energy Saver energy assessment tool allows consumers to conduct a do-it-yourself home [[energy audit]] and provides specific recommendations to help lower household [[Domestic energy consumption|energy consumption]] and utility costs. By entering a zip code, users get estimates for typical and efficient homes in their area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Janeway |first=Kimberly |title=This Audit Might Actually Save You Money |url=http://blogs.consumerreports.org/home/2008/01/home-energy-use.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113053028/http://blogs.consumerreports.org/home/2008/01/home-energy-use.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=13 January 2008 |publisher=Consumer Reports |accessdate=10 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The estimates break down energy consumption by "end use". End uses reported by Home Energy Saver include: [[heating]], [[Air conditioning|cooling]], [[water heating]], [[major appliances]], [[small appliances]], and [[lighting]].

The more details a user enters, (e.g., [[Building insulation|insulation]] levels, [[Roofing material|roofing]], age of major equipment, how systems are used) the more customized the assessment results and [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] recommendations become. The tailored reports allows consumers to drill into estimated cost of improvements, anticipated [[Payback period|payback]] time, projected utility bill savings, and how much energy use and [[green house gas]] production will be reduced. Consumers can vary the [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] assumptions and the upgrade costs, (e.g., replacing the default values with actual estimates from contractors) and recalculate the [[Payback period|payback]] times and other details.

The Home Energy Saver website includes a section called LEARN which offers tips about energy savings, an explanation of the house-as-system energy efficiency approach, and other information to help people understand how energy is used in a home.

When launched in 1994, Home Energy Saver was the first and only online home energy calculator. Thereafter, 6 million people have used it to analyze their home energy use. Nearly 1 million people visit the site each year. In 2009, a second version of the tool, Home Energy Saver Professional, was launched. This advanced version provides a low cost, interactive energy simulation/assessments tool for [[contractors]], building professionals, [[weatherization]] professionals, and building designers.

== The Home Energy Simulation Model ==
The Home Energy Saver is built on DOE-2, a computer program for building heating and cooling energy analysis and design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Calculating Energy Savings |url=http://www.rdmag.com/Awards/Rd-100-Awards/2010/08/Calculating-Energy-Savings/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203034544/http://www.rdmag.com/Awards/Rd-100-Awards/2010/08/Calculating-Energy-Savings/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=3 December 2010 |publisher=R&amp;D |accessdate=12 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DOE-2 performs a thermal load simulation that accounts for heating and cooling equipment and thermal distribution efficiencies, infiltration, and thermostat management.&lt;ref&gt;Raad. Z. Homod, K. S. M. Sahari, H. A.F. Almurib, F. H. Nagi, Double cooling coil model for non-linear HVAC system using RLF method, Energy and Buildings, Volume 43 (2011) 2043–2054&lt;/ref&gt; User-entered zip codes are mapped to one of about 300 unique "weather tapes" that impose a year's worth of local weather conditions on the home to determine heating and cooling needs.

Home Energy Saver extends DOE-2 in a number of ways to improve the simulation model.&lt;ref&gt;Raad Z. Homod,  K.S.M. Sahari, H.A.F. Mohamed, F. Nagi,  Modeling of heat and moisture transfer in building using RLF method, conference on research and development, IEEE, (2010) 287 – 292&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when users enter their actual electricity tariffs, the predictive power of the model improves. Other methods are used to calculate the energy used by appliances, water heating, and lighting.

The [[public domain]] HES calculation methods and underlying data are clearly documented on the website. Other web-based tool developers are welcome to use this information at no cost, providing that the source is properly credited.

== Energy Saving Recommendations ==
The Home Energy Saver enables users to quantify the benefits of improving the energy efficiency and comfort of homes in the following ways:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Orman|first=Suzie|title=The Cheapest Way to Go Green|url=http://www.oprah.com/money/Suze-Ormans-Guide-to-Making-Low-Cost-Eco-Upgrades/print/1|publisher=Oprah.com|accessdate=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* No Cost Changes – No cost changes are modifications to the way energy is used, like lowering the [[hot water heater]] temperature, unplugging the second [[refrigerator]] that is running to cool just a few things, doing laundry with cool or cold water instead of hot, or programming the [[thermostat]] a bit lower. These changes don't cost anything, but they can save a substantial amount of energy over time.
* Low Cost Changes – Low cost changes include actions like changing out [[incandescent light bulbs]] for [[compact fluorescent lamps]] (CFLs) or [[LED|LED bulbs]], wrapping a hot water heater in an insulating blanket, or [[weatherization|weatherizing]] a home by caulking or adding weather stripping. Low cost changes are typically [[Do-It-Yourself]] tasks that can improve the energy efficiency of a home dramatically.
* Deep Home Energy Upgrades or Retrofits – Upgrades can include actions ranging from replacing old inefficient appliances with new [[Energy Star]] appliances, adding [[Building insulation|insulation]], or replacing major systems like [[heating]] equipment or the [[roof]].

The energy improvement recommendations are drawn from the National Residential Energy Efficiency Measures Database.

== Awards &amp; Recognition ==
Each year, the [[R&amp;D 100 Awards]] recognize the year's 100 most significant, innovative, newly introduced research and development advances. The awards are recognized in industry, government, and academia as proof that a product is one of the most [[innovative]] ideas of the year, nationally and internationally. Home Energy Saver and [[Hohm]] received an [[R&amp;D 100 Award]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet the R&amp;D 100 Winners for 2010|url=http://www.rdmag.com/Awards/RD-100-Awards/2010/07/R-D-100-2010-Winners-Overview/|publisher=R&amp;D Magazine|accessdate=7 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Home Energy Saver received the [[U.S. Department of Energy]]'s "Energy 100" award as one of the best 100 scientific and technological accomplishments over DOE's 23-year lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Department of Energy Honors Most Notable Scientific and Technological Accomplishments |url=http://www.science.energy.gov/News_Information/News_Room/2001/Most%20Notable%20Scientific.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528130412/http://science.energy.gov/News_Information/News_Room/2001/Most%20Notable%20Scientific.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=28 May 2010 |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy |accessdate=8 January 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The discoveries were chosen based on their impact in saving consumers money and improving quality of life.

PC Magazine recognized Home Energy Saver in 2004 as one of the "Top 100 Undiscovered Websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=2004 100 Top Websites You Didn't Know You Couldn't Live Without|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2312019,00.asp|publisher=PC Magazine|accessdate=20 April 2004|date=20 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MSN-Money rates Home Energy Saver among the "Best Sites for Free Government Help" including it in the list of "The 100 most Useful Sites on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pulliam Weston|first=Liz|title=The 100 most useful sites on the Internet|url=http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/SavingandDebt/FindDealsOnline/weston-the-100-most-useful-sites-on-the-Internet.aspx|publisher=MSN|accessdate=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Licensing ==
Organizations who want to provide their customers tools to predict home energy consumption can license the Home Energy Saver [[Application Programming Interfaces]] (APIs).

[[Microsoft]], the first organization to license the Home Energy Saver, uses it to drive Microsoft [[Hohm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Katie|first=Fehrenbacher|title=Microsoft Reveals Its Energy Management Tool: Hohm|url=http://gigaom.com/cleantech/microsoft-reveals-its-energy-managent-tool-hohm/|publisher=GIGAom|accessdate=24 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3470">The '''Hume-Rothery rules''', named after [[William Hume-Rothery]], are a set of basic rules that describe the conditions under which an element could dissolve in a [[metal]], forming a [[solid solution]].  There are two sets of rules; one refers to substitutional solid solutions, and the other refers to [[Interstitial defect|interstitial]] solid solutions.

==Substitutional solid solution rules==
For substitutional solid solutions, the Hume-Rothery rules are as follows:

# The [[atomic radius]] of the solute and [[solvent]] atoms must differ by no more than 15%:
#:&lt;math&gt; \% \mbox{ difference} = \left ( \frac{r_{solute} - r_{solvent}}{r_{solvent}} \right ) \times 100\% \le 15\%.&lt;/math&gt;
# The [[crystal structure]]s of solute and solvent must be similar.
# Complete [[solubility]] occurs when the solvent and solute have the same [[Valence (chemistry)|valency]].&lt;ref&gt;''Foundations of Materials Science and Engineering'', 4th ed., W. Smith and J. Hashemi, pp.139-140 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;   A metal of higher valency is more likely to dissolve in a metal with lower valency.&lt;ref&gt;VALENCY  EFFECTS AND  RELATIVE SOLUBILITIES IN  TRANSITION METAL ALLOYS D.

It appears more easily-obtainable 2ndary sources say lower is likelier to dissolve in higher than this.  Two independent 2ndary sources are needed to leave this statement as is.  References in talk page.|date=January 2018}}
# The solute and solvent should have similar [[electronegativity]]. If the electronegativity difference is too great, the metals tend to form [[Intermetallics|intermetallic compounds]] instead of solid solutions.

==Interstitial solid solution rules==
For [[Interstitial defect|interstitial]] solid solutions, the Hume-Rothery rules are:

# Solute atoms should have radius no larger than 59% of the radius of solvent atoms.&lt;ref&gt;https://madeeasy.in/admin/ESEGroup/12.%20ME_ESE_FST_Paper-2_Conv_2109.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://slideplayer.com/slide/7666224/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://slideplayer.com/slide/5866092/&lt;/ref&gt;
# The solute and solvent should have similar [[electronegativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Hume-Rothery Rules  | encyclopedia = Van Nostrand's Scientific Encyclopedia | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc | year = 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# They should show a wide range of composition.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} {{confusing | section | reason = this statement is either circular, or contradictory, or incomprehensible. |date=January 2018}}
# Valency factor: two elements should have the same valence. The greater the difference in valence between solute and solvent atoms, the lower the solubility.

The work on the Digital platform is focussed on capture, transfer and integration of [[Real-time data]] from the remote production installations to the decision makers. A risk evaluation across the whole chain is also included. The platform is based on [[open standards]] and enables a higher degree of [[interoperability]]. Requirements for the digital platform come from use cases defined within the [[Oil_and_gas_well_drilling#Drilling|Drilling]] and [[Oil_and_gas_well_drilling#Completion|Completion]], Reservoir and Production and Operations and Maintenance domains. The platform will subsequently be demonstrated through pilots within these three domains.&lt;ref name="IOHNsite"&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7655">[[File:Wood Carver Kim Bong.JPG|thumb|A woodcarver plies his trade at a Kim Bồng woodworking studio.]]
'''Kim Bồng woodworking village''' ({{lang-vi|Làng mộc Kim Bồng}}) is a village located in Cẩm Kim commune, [[Hội An]], [[Quảng Nam Province]], most notable for its [[carpentry]] (including [[cabinet making]] and [[shipbuilding]]) and traditional [[woodworking]] products. Established in the 15th century, it reached its peak in the 18th century, during which time village craftsmen contributed their skills in woodworking to many different projects, including the [[Imperial City, Huế|Imperial capital]] in [[Huế]].&lt;ref name="vnnet-june09" /&gt; Using their shipbuilding skills, they supplied ships and ''ghe bầu'' (large boats used for sailing) for the activities of the busy commercial port of Hội An.&lt;ref name="vnnet-june09" /&gt;

To deal with a marked decline of interest in the woodworking profession during the 20th century, the village successfully offered training and other incentives to young apprentices,&lt;ref name="vnnet-june09" /&gt; resulting in an increase to over 200 woodworkers and 18 different woodcarving companies as of 2008.&lt;ref name="unesco-impact" /&gt; Additionally, a successful community-based tourism project in Kim Bồng has allowed greater tourism revenue for the village; the venture's success has been suggested as a pattern for future [[sustainable tourism]] projects throughout [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref name="eprp06" /&gt;

The village's name comes from the Vietnamese ''kim'' (yellow) and ''bồng'' (floating), supposedly after the [[jackfruit]] wood that sometimes floats on the [[Thu Bồn River]].

== History ==
Kim Bồng was settled in the 15th century, supposedly by four soldiers from the army of Emperor [[Lê Lợi]], who founded the Later [[Lê Dynasty]]. According to traditional stories, these four soldiers were adept at [[woodworking]], and went on to establish the village's four most notable craft families (Huynh, Nguyen, Phan, and Truong), many of whose members carry on that trade to the present day. As the neighbouring town of [[Hội An]] developed during the late 16th and early 17th centuries, Kim Bồng's [[carpentry|carpenters]] and woodworkers became more widely known; in the 17th century, local carpenters were supposedly commissioned to build a warship for the Spanish navy.&lt;ref name="vnnet-june09" /&gt; Craftsmen from Kim Bồng also produced most of the detail work on the buildings of the former Imperial capital in [[Huế]], and, more recently, on Vietnamese revolutionary leader [[Ho Chi Minh]]'s tomb.&lt;ref name="vnnet-june09"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.vietnamnet.vn/lifestyle/2009/06/850646/|title=Kim Bong village carves itself into history|date=2009-06-01|publisher=VietnamNet|accessdate=2010-07-05|archiveurl=http://www.lookatvietnam.com/2009/06/kim-bong-village-carves-itself-into-history.html|archivedate=2010-10-15}} {{Unreliable source?|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the present day, Kim Bồng craftsmen are often involved in restoration projects. For example, since the old town of Hội An was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1999, many of the village's artisans have found work restoring historic buildings, some of which have remained otherwise untouched for hundreds of years. Local craftsmen have also worked on restoration projects in nearby [[Da Nang]], and in [[Quảng Ninh Province]].&lt;ref name="vnnet-june09" /&gt;

==Economy==
[[File:Three Heads in Kim Bong.JPG|thumb|190px|Kim Bồng wood carvings.]]
As its popular appellation suggests, the economy of Kim Bồng has long been dominated by [[carpentry]] (including [[cabinetmaking]] and [[shipbuilding]]) and [[woodworking]]. Kim Bồng woodwork is featured on unique columns, rafters and furniture found throughout the greater [[Hội An]] area and [[Quảng Nam Province]];&lt;ref name="unesco-impact"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001826/182646e.pdf|title=Cultural Tourism and Heritage Management in the World Heritage Site of the Ancient Town of Hoi An, Viet Nam|work=IMPACT: The Effects of Tourism on Culture and the Environment in Asia and the Pacific|publisher=UNESCO Bangkok|year=2008|accessdate=2010-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; local craftsmen have also been employed in many high-profile projects in Vietnam, including detail work on the buildings of the former [[Imperial City, Huế|Imperial capital]] in [[Huế]], and on [[Vietnam]]ese [[revolutionary]] leader [[Ho Chi Minh]]'s tomb.

In more recent years, woodworking as a profession fell out of favour with young people, mainly due to poor returns: the average income of a woodworker in Kim Bồng is about [[Vietnamese đồng|VND]] 1.5 million (US$85) per month. By the 1990s, few master carvers remained in the village. To help promote the profession, Cẩm Kim commune created a program allowing young people to receive free training in carpentry and woodworking, along with providing a monthly stipend of VND 150,000 ($8) and tools of the trade.&lt;ref name="vnnet-june09" /&gt; Training courses are provided by master carver Huynh Ri, whose family includes 12 generations of woodcarvers. Several other local woodworking studios also provide on-the-job training to apprentice woodcarvers. These training programs have resulted in an increase in skilled woodworkers: the village numbered over 200 workers and 18 different woodcarving companies as of 2008. These results were lauded by UNESCO as "keeping the traditional skills and intangible heritage of the town of Hoi An and its surrounding villages alive".&lt;ref name="unesco-impact" /&gt;

Tourism is a more recent contributor to the local economy, beginning in 2002, when the Vietnam National Administration of Tourism (VNAT) led a community-based tourism project in Kim Bồng, together with [[UNESCO]] and the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]]/[[World Trade Organization]]'s Export-led Poverty Reduction Programme (EPRP). The village was selected as a promising location for the project because of its proximity to Hội An (already a major tourist destination), which provided an existing tourist base, and its existing craft sector. A dual pedestrian-[[segregated cycle facilities|bicycle trail]] was established to lead visitors through the village to see the local woodworking shops, where they are able to observe craftsmen working and purchase their products. Concurrent with the development of infrastructure, a tourism service [[cooperative]] was established, as well as a skills training program for members and a marketing program which resulted in market linkages with several major hotels and tour operators operating in Hội An. Local and provincial tourism authorities have also incorporated the village into festivals and promotional campaigns. The success of the venture has led it to be considered a model case on which future [[sustainable tourism]] projects throughout Southeast Asia can be patterned.&lt;ref name="eprp06"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intracen.org/wedf/ef2006/global-debate/Case-Studies/Vietnam.pdf|title=Poverty Reduction Through Community-Based Tourism in Viet Nam: A Case Study|author=Export-led Poverty Reduction Programme (UNCTAD/WTO)|date=October 2006|accessdate=2010-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Linoleum 003.jpg|thumb|240px|Linoleum from around the 1950s]]

'''Linoleum''', also called '''Lino''', is a [[floor covering]] made from materials such as solidified [[linseed oil]] (linoxyn), pine [[rosin]], ground [[Cork (material)|cork]] dust, [[wood flour]], and mineral fillers such as [[calcium carbonate]], most commonly on a [[burlap]] or [[canvas]] backing. Pigments are often added to the materials to create the desired colour finish.

The finest linoleum floors, known as "inlaid", are extremely durable, and were made by joining and inlaying solid pieces of linoleum. Cheaper patterned linoleum came in different grades or gauges, and were printed with thinner layers which were more prone to wear and tear. High quality linoleum is flexible and thus can be used in buildings where a more rigid material (such as [[Tile#Floor tiles|ceramic tile]]) would crack.

== History ==
[[File:Tyntesfield 2015 087.jpg|thumb|right|Early linoleum at [[Tyntesfield]].]]
Linoleum was invented by Englishman [[Frederick Walton]]. In 1855, Walton happened to notice the rubbery, flexible skin of solidified linseed oil (linoxyn) that had formed on a can of oil-based paint and thought that it might form a substitute for [[natural rubber|India rubber]]. Raw linseed oil oxidizes very slowly, but Walton accelerated the process by heating it with [[lead acetate]]{{Clarify|Lead(II) acetate or Lead(IV) acetate|date=November 2017}} and [[zinc sulfate]]. This made the oil form a resinous mass into which lengths of cheap cotton cloth were dipped until a thick coating formed. The coating was then scraped off and boiled with [[benzene]] or similar solvents to form a varnish. Walton initially planned to sell his varnish to the makers of water-repellent fabrics such as [[oilcloth]], and patented the process in 1860. However, his method had problems: the cotton cloth soon fell apart, and it took months to produce enough of the linoxyn. Little interest was shown in Walton's varnish. In addition, his first factory burned down, and he suffered from persistent and painful rashes.

Walton soon came up with an easier way to transfer the oil to the cotton sheets, by hanging them vertically and sprinkling the oil from above, and he tried mixing the linoxyn with sawdust and cork dust to make it less tacky. In 1863 he applied for a further [[patent]], which read: "For these purposes canvas or other suitable strong fabrics are coated over on their upper surfaces with a composition of oxidized oil, cork dust, and gum or resin ... such surfaces being afterward printed, embossed, or otherwise ornamented. The back or under surfaces of such fabrics are coated with a coating of such oxidized oils, or oxidized oils and gum or resin, and by preference without an admixture of cork."

At first Walton called his invention "Kampticon", which was deliberately close to [[Kamptulicon]], the name of an existing floor covering, but he soon changed it to Linoleum, which he derived from the Latin words "linum" (flax) and "oleum" (oil). In 1864 he established the Linoleum Manufacturing Company Ltd., with a factory at [[Staines]], near London. The new product did not prove immediately popular, mainly due to intense competition from the makers of Kamptulicon and oilcloth. The company operated at a loss for its first five years, until Walton began an intensive advertising campaign and opened two shops in London for the exclusive sale of Linoleum. Walton's friend Jerimiah Clarke designed the linoleum patterns, typically with a Grecian urn motif around the borders.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Other inventors began their own experiments after Walton took out his patent, and in 1871 [[William Parnacott]] took out a patent for a method of producing linoxyn by blowing hot air into a tank of linseed oil for several hours, then cooling the material in trays. Unlike Walton's process, which took weeks, Parnacott's method took only a day or two, although the quality of the linoxyn was not as good. Despite this, many manufacturers opted to use the less expensive Parnacott process.

Walton soon faced competition from other manufacturers, including a company which bought the rights to Parnacott’s process, and launched its own floor covering, which it named Corticine, from the Latin "cortex" (bark or rind). Corticine was mainly made of cork dust and linoxyn without a cloth backing, and became popular because it was cheaper than linoleum.

By 1869 Walton's factory in [[Staines]], England was exporting to Europe and the United States. In 1877, the [[Scotland|Scottish]] town of [[Kirkcaldy]], in [[Fife]], became the largest producer of linoleum in the world, with no fewer than six floorcloth manufacturers in the town, most notably Michael Nairn &amp; Co., which had been producing floorcloth since 1847.

Walton opened the American Linoleum Manufacturing Company in 1872 on [[Staten Island]], in partnership with Joseph Wild, the company's town being named Linoleumville (renamed [[Travis, Staten Island|Travis]] in 1930).&lt;ref name=lino23/&gt; It was the first U.S. linoleum manufacturer, but was soon followed by the American Nairn Linoleum Company, established by Sir Michael Nairn in 1887 (later the Congoleum Nairn Company, and The Congoleum Corporation of America), in [[Kearny, New Jersey]]. Congoleum now manufactures sheet [[vinyl (fabric)|vinyl]] and no longer has a linoleum line. {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

In 2016 a Dutch flooring producer changed the old concept of a factory manufactured linoleum in rolls or tiles to a liquid poured version (liquid lino) of the linoleum which is applied seamlessly on site. By adding a hybrid extra vegetable based binder the liquid lino sets overnight. This hybrid bindersystem makes the liquid lino highly chemical resistant and permanently flexible.  

=== Loss of trademark protection ===
Walton was unhappy with Michael Nairn &amp; Co's use of the name Linoleum and brought a lawsuit against them for trademark infringement. However, the term had not been trademarked, and he lost the suit, the court opining that even if the name ''had'' been registered as a trademark, it was by now so widely used that it had [[genericized trademark|become generic]], only 14 years after its invention. It is considered to be the first product name to become a generic term.&lt;ref name=lino23&gt;Powell and Svendsen, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use == 
Between the time of its invention in 1860 and its being largely superseded by other hard floor coverings in the 1950s, linoleum was considered to be an excellent, inexpensive material for high-use areas. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, it was favoured in hallways and passages, and as a surround for carpet squares. However, most people associate linoleum with its common twentieth century use on kitchen floors. Its water resistance enabled easy maintenance of sanitary conditions and its resilience made standing easier and reduced breakage of dropped china.

Other products devised by Walton included Linoleum Muralis in 1877, which became better known as [[Lincrusta]]. Essentially a highly durable linoleum wallcovering, Lincrusta could be manufactured to resemble carved plaster or wood, or even leather. It was very successful, and inspired a much cheaper imitation, [[Anaglypta]], originally devised by one of Walton’s showroom managers.

Walton also tried integrating designs into linoleum during the manufacturing stage, coming up with granite, marbled, and jaspé (striped) linoleum. For the granite variety, granules of various colours of linoleum cement were mixed together, before being hot-rolled. If the granules were not completely mixed before rolling, the result was marbled or jaspé patterns.

Walton’s next product was inlaid linoleum, which resembled encaustic tiles, in 1882. Previously, linoleum had been produced in solid colours, with patterns printed on the surface if required. In inlaid linoleum, the colours extend all the way through to the backing cloth. Inlaid linoleum was made using a stencil type method where different-coloured granules were placed in shaped metal trays, after which the sheets were run through heated rollers to fuse them to the backing cloth. In 1898 Walton devised a process for making straight-line inlaid linoleum that allowed for crisp, sharp geometric designs. This involved strips of uncured linoleum being cut and pieced together patchwork-fashion before being hot-rolled. Embossed inlaid linoleum was not introduced until 1926.

The heavier gauges of linoleum are known as “battleship linoleum”, and are mainly used in high-traffic situations like offices and public buildings. It was originally manufactured to meet the specifications of the U.S. Navy for warship deck covering on enclosed decks instead of wood, hence the name. Most U.S. Navy warships removed their linoleum deck coverings following the attack on Pearl Harbor, as they were considered too flammable. (Use of linoleum persisted in U.S. Navy submarines.&lt;ref&gt;Beach, Edward L., Jr. “Run Silent, Run Deep” and “Dust on the Sea”.&lt;/ref&gt;) Royal Navy warships used the similar product “Corticine”.

Early in the twentieth century, a group of [[Dresden]] artists adapted the [[printmaking]] techniques for [[woodcut]] prints to linoleum, thus creating the [[linocut]] printmaking technique.  Prominent artists who created linocut prints included [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] and [[Henri Matisse]].

== Present day ==
[[Image:Linoleum Querschnitt.jpg|thumb|Unlike most [[polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] flooring, the colour goes all the way through the linoleum]]
Linoleum has largely been replaced as a floor covering by [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC), which is often colloquially but incorrectly called linoleum or lino. PVC has similar flexibility and durability to linoleum, but also has greater brightness and translucency, and is relatively less flammable. The fire-retardant properties of PVC are due to chlorine-containing combustion products, some of which are highly [[toxic]].  [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|Dioxins]] are released by burning PVC.&lt;ref&gt;Costner, Pat, (2005), [http://www.pops.int/documents/meetings/cop_2/followup/toolkit/submissions/IPEN%20Comments/Estimating%20Dioxin%20Releases%20English.pdf "Estimating Releases and Prioritizing Sources in the Context of the Stockholm Convention"], International POPs Elimination Network, Mexico.&lt;/ref&gt;  While the polymer itself is generally considered safe, additives such as [[plasticizer]]s, and unintentional impurities such as free [[monomers]], are considered a hazard by some: see the [[Polyvinyl chloride#Health and safety|health and safety]] section of the main PVC article for more information and references.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1877">[[Image:Loaddurationcurve.JPG|480px|center|thumb|Typical Load Duration Curve.&lt;ref&gt;Renewable and Efficient Electric Power Systems By Gilbert M. Masters&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A load duration curve illustrates the variation of a certain load in a downward form such that the greatest load is plotted in the left and the smallest one in the right. On the time axis, the time duration for which each certain load continues during the day is given.

There are some facts about the LDC that can be summarized as:
# the LDC is an arrangement of all load levels in a descending order of magnitude.
# the area under the LDC represents the energy demanded by the system (consumed).
# can be used in economic dispatching, system planning and reliability evaluation.
# it is more convenient to deal with than the load curve.
 
A '''load duration curve''' (LDC) is used in [[Electricity generation|electric power generation]] to illustrate the relationship between generating capacity requirements and capacity utilization.

A LDC is similar to a [[load curve]] but the demand data is ordered in descending order of magnitude, rather than chronologically. The LDC curve shows the capacity utilization requirements for each increment of load. The height of each slice is a measure of capacity, and the width of each slice is a measure of the utilization rate or [[capacity factor]]. The product of the two is a measure of electrical energy (e.g. kilowatthours).

A price duration curve shows the proportion of time for which the price exceeded a certain value.

Together, the price duration curve and load duration curve enable the analyst to understand the behaviour of the electricity market, for example, the likelihood of [[peaking power plant]] being required for service, and the impact that this might have on [[Electricity pricing|price]].

'''Metropolitan-Vickers''', '''Metrovick''', or '''Metrovicks''', was a [[United Kingdom|British]] heavy [[electrical engineering]] company of the early-to-mid 20th century formerly known as [[British Westinghouse]]. Highly diversified, they were particularly well known for their industrial electrical equipment such as [[Electrical generator|generators]], [[steam turbine]]s, [[switchgear]], [[transformer]]s, [[electronics]] and railway traction equipment. Metrovick holds a place in history as the builders of the first commercial [[transistor computer]], the [[Metrovick 950]], and the first British [[axial-flow]] [[jet engine]], the [[Metropolitan-Vickers F.2]]. Their factory in Trafford Park, Manchester, was for most of the 20th century one of the biggest and most important heavy engineering facilities in Britain and the world.

==History==
{{Main article|British Westinghouse|Vickers Limited}}
[[File:Metrovick 375 KW turbo-alternator.jpg|thumb|Metropolitan-Vickers 375 KW steam turbo-alternator]]
[[File:Metropolitan Vickers advertisement Brasseys 1923.jpeg|thumb|right|170px|Advertisement for marine turbines in [[Brassey's Naval and Shipping Annual]] 1923.]]
[[File:Ferrocarriles Argentinos - Metropolitan Vickers.jpg|thumb|250px|Metrovick [[electric multiple unit]] made for [[Central Argentine Railway]] in 1931. They worked until 1995.]]
Metrovick started as a way to separate the existing [[British Westinghouse|British Westinghouse Electrical and Manufacturing Company]] factories from United States control, which had proven to be a hindrance to gaining government contracts during the [[First World War]]. In 1917 a holding company was formed to try to find financing to buy the company's properties.&lt;ref name=scott-140-142&gt;Scott (1963). P.140-142.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1917, control of the holding company was obtained jointly by the [[Metropolitan Carriage, Wagon and Finance Company]], of [[Birmingham]], chaired by [[Dudley Docker]], and [[Vickers Limited]], of [[Barrow-in-Furness]].&lt;ref name=scott-140-142/&gt;&lt;ref name=gillham-2&gt;Gillham (1988), Chapter 2: ''The Manufacturers.&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 March 1919, Docker agreed terms with Vickers, for Vickers to purchase all the [[shares]] of the Metropolitan Carriage, Wagon and Finance Company for almost thirteen million pounds.&lt;ref name=scott-140-142/&gt;&lt;ref name=gillham-2/&gt;&lt;ref name=scott-a&gt;Scott (1963). Appendix A.&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 September 1919, Vickers changed the name of the British Westinghouse Electrical and Manufacturing Company to '''Metropolitan Vickers Electrical Company'''.&lt;ref name=scott-140-142/&gt;&lt;ref name=gillham-2/&gt;

The immediate post-war era was marked by low investment and continued labour unrest. Fortunes changed in 1926 with the formation of the [[Central Electricity Board]] which standardized electrical supply and led to a massive expansion of electrical distribution, installations, and appliance purchases. Sales shot up, and 1927 marked the company's best year to date.

On 15 November 1922 the [[BBC]] was registered and the BBC's Manchester station, [[2ZY]], was officially opened on 375 metres transmitting from the Metropolitan Vickers Electricity works in Old Trafford.

===BTH merger and transition to AEI===
{{Main article|British Thomson-Houston|Associated Electrical Industries}}

In 1928 Metrovick merged with the rival [[British Thomson-Houston]] (BTH), a company of similar size and basically the same product lineup. Combined, they would be one of the few companies able to compete with [[Marconi Company|Marconi]] or [[English Electric]] on an equal footing. In fact the merger was marked by poor communication and intense rivalry, and the two companies generally worked at cross purposes.

The next year the combined company was purchased by the [[Associated Electrical Industries]] (AEI) holding group, who also owned [[Edison Swan]] (Ediswan); and [[Ferguson, Pailin &amp; Co]], manufacturers of electrical switchgear in Openshaw, Manchester. The rivalry between Metrovick and BTH continued, and AEI was never able to exert effective control over the two competing subsidiary companies.

Problems worsened in 1929 with the start of the [[great depression]], but Metrovick's overseas sales were able to pick up some of the slack, notably a major railway electrification project in [[Brazil]]. By 1933 world trade was growing again, but growth was nearly upset when six Metrovick engineers were arrested and found guilty of [[espionage]] and "[[Wrecking (Soviet crime)|wrecking]]" in [[Moscow]] after a number of turbines built by the company in and for the [[Soviet Union]] proved to be faulty. The British government intervened; the engineers were released and trade with Russia was resumed after a brief embargo.

During the 1930s Metropolitan Vickers produced two dozen very large diameter (3m/10&amp;nbsp;ft) three-phase AC traction motors&lt;ref &gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the Hungarian railway's [[MÁV Class V40|V40]] and [[MÁV Class V60|V60]] electric locomotives. The 1640&amp;nbsp;kW rated power machinery, designed by [[Kálmán Kandó]], was paid for by British government economic aid.

In 1935 the company built a 105 [[Megawatt|MW]] steam [[turbogenerator]], the largest in Europe at that time, for the [[Battersea Power Station]].&lt;ref &gt;[http://www.scienceandsociety.co.uk/results.asp?image=10250275&amp;wwwflag=3&amp;imagepos=57 "Turbine, Battersea Power Station, 31 January 1935"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936 Metrovick started work with the [[Air Ministry]] on [[autopilot|automatic pilot]] systems, eventually branching out to gunlaying systems and building [[radar]]s the next year. In 1938 they reached an agreement with the Ministry to build a [[turboprop]] design developed at the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE) under the direction of [[Hayne Constant]]. It is somewhat ironic that BTH, their erstwhile partners, were at the same time working with [[Frank Whittle]] on his pioneering jet designs.

===Wartime aircraft production===

In mid-1938, MV's were given a contract to build [[Avro Manchester]] twin-engined heavy bombers under licence from [[Avro|A.V. Roe]]. As this type of work was very different from their traditional heavy engineering activities, a new factory was built on the western side of Mosley Road and this was completed in stages through 1940.  There were significant problems producing this aircraft, not least being the unreliability of the Rolls-Royce Vulture engine and that the first 13 Manchesters were destroyed in a ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' bombing raid on [[Trafford Park]] on 23 December. Despite this the firm went on to complete 43 examples. With the design of the much improved four-engined derivative, the [[Avro Lancaster]], MV switched production to that famous type, supplied with [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]] engines from the [[Ford]] [[Ford Trafford Park Factory|Trafford Park]] [[shadow factory]]. Three hangars were erected on the southside of Manchester's [[Ringway Airport]] for assembly and testing of their Lancasters, before a policy switch was made to assembling them in a hangar at Avro's Woodford airfield. By the end of the war, MV's had built 1,080 Lancasters. These were followed by 79 [[Avro Lincoln]] derivatives before remaining orders were cancelled and MV's aircraft production ceased in December 1945.

In 1940 the turboprop effort was re-engineered as a pure jet engine after the successful run of Whittle's designs. The new design became the [[Metrovick F.2]] and eventually flew in [[1943 in aviation|1943]] on a [[Gloster Meteor]]. Considered to be too complex to bother with, Metrovick then re-engineered the design once again to produce roughly double the power, while at the same time starting work on a much larger design, the [[Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire|Metrovick F.9 ''Sapphire'']]. Although the F.9 proved to be a winner, the [[Ministry of Supply]] nevertheless forced the company to sell the jet division to [[Armstrong Siddeley]] in 1947 to reduce the number of companies in the business.

In addition to building aircraft, other wartime work included the manufacture of both [[Dowty Group|Dowty]] and Messier undercarriages, automatic pilot units, searchlights and radar equipment.

===Metrovicks postwar===

[[File:Metropolitan-Vickers electron-microscope 0001.jpg|thumb|Metropolitan-Vickers electron microscope]]

The post-war era led to massive demand for electrical systems, leading to additional rivalries between Metrovick and BTH as each attempted to [[One-upmanship|one-up]] the other in delivering ever-larger turbogenerator contracts. Metrovick also expanded their appliance division during this time, becoming a well known supplier of refrigerators and stoves.

The design and manufacture of sophisticated scientific instruments, such as [[electron microscope]]s, and [[mass spectrometer]]s, became an important area of scientific research for the company.

In 1947 a Metrovick G.1 Gatric [[gas turbine]] was fitted to the [[Motor Gun Boat]] ''MGB 2009'', making it the world's first [[gas turbine]] powered naval vessel. The [[Bluebird K7]] jet-propelled 3-point hydroplane in which [[Donald Campbell]] broke the 200&amp;nbsp;mph water speed barrier was powered with a Metropolitan-Vickers Beryl jet engine producing 3,500&amp;nbsp;lbf (16&amp;nbsp;kN) of thrust. The K7 was unveiled in late 1954. Campbell succeeded on Ullswater on 23 July 1955, where he set a record of 202.15&amp;nbsp;mph (325.33&amp;nbsp;km/h), beating the previous record by some 24&amp;nbsp;mph (39&amp;nbsp;km/h) held by Stanley Sayres.

Another major area of expansion was in the diesel locomotive market, where they combined their own generators and traction motors, with third-party diesel engines to develop in 1950 the [[WAGR X class]] [[UIC classification|2-Do-2]] locomotive and in 1958 the type 2 Co-Bo, later re-classified under the [[TOPS]] system as the [[British Rail Class 28]]. This [[Diesel-electric transmission|diesel-electric]] locomotive was unusual on two counts; its Co-Bo wheel arrangement and its [[Crossley]] 2-Stroke diesel engine (evolved from a World War II marine engine). Intended as part the [[British Railways]] [[1955 Modernisation Plan|Modernisation Plan]], the twenty-strong fleet saw service between Scotland and England before being deemed unsuccessful and withdrawn towards the end of the 1960s. Metrovick also produced the [[CIE 001 Class]] (originally 'A' Class) from 1955, the first production mainline diesels in [[Ireland]].

Metropolitan Vickers also produced electrical equipment for the [[British Rail Class 76]] (EM1), and [[British Rail Class 77]] (EM2), 1.5 kV DC locomotives, built at [[Gorton locomotive works|Gorton Works]] for the [[electrification]] of the [[Woodhead Line]] in the early 1950s. Larger but broadly similar locomotives were also supplied to the [[New South Wales Government Railways|NSWGR]] as their [[New South Wales 46 class locomotive|Class 46]]. The company also designed the [[British Rail Class 82]], 25 kV AC locomotives built by [[Beyer Peacock]] in Manchester using Metrovick electrical equipment. The company also supplied electrical equipment for the [[British Rail Class 303]] "Blue Train" [[electric multiple units]].

During the 1950s the company built a large [[power transformer]] works at [[Wythenshawe]], near Manchester. The factory was opened in 1957 and later closed by GEC in 1971, after which it was sold to the American compressor manufacturer [[Ingersoll Rand]].

In 1961, the Russian cosmonaut [[Yuri Gagarin]] was invited to the company's factory at Trafford Park as part of his tour of Manchester.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yurigagarin50.org/history/gagarin-in-britain "Yuri Gagarin in the UK"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://yurigagarin50.org/history/gagarin-in-britain/gagarin-in-manchester "Yuri Gagarin's visit to Manchester"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The rivalry between Metrovick and BTH was eventually ended in an unconvincing fashion when the AEI management eventually decided to rid themselves of both brands and be known as AEI universally, a change they made on 1 January 1960. This move was almost universally resented within both companies. Worse, the new brand name was utterly unknown to their customers, leading to a noticeable fall-off in sales and AEI's stock price.

===General Electricity Company takeover===
When AEI attempted to remove the doubled-up management structures, they found this task to be even more difficult.  By the mid-1960s the company was struggling under the weight of two complete management hierarchies, and they appeared to be unable to control the company any more.  This allowed AEI to be purchased by [[General Electric Company plc|General Electricity Company]] in 1967, which was later restructured into many other companies, including Marconi plc in 1999, later [[Marconi Corporation plc]], and others.

[[File:Nanowire laser.png|thumb|Nanowire lasers for ultrafast transmission of information in light pulses]]
[[Semiconductor]] nanowire lasers are nano-scaled [[lasers]] that can be embedded on chips and constitute an advance for computing and information processing applications. Nanowire lasers are coherent light sources (single mode optical waveguides) as any other laser device, with the advantage of operating at the nanoscale. Built by [[molecular beam epitaxy]], nanowire lasers offer the possibility for direct integration on silicon, and the construction of optical interconnects and data communication at the chip scale. Nanowire lasers are built from III–V semiconductor heterostructures. Their unique 1D configuration and high refractive index allow for low optical loss and recirculation in the active nanowire core region. This enables subwavelength laser sizes of only a few hundred nanometers &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ning|first=C.

Nanowires are Fabry–Perot resonator cavities defined by the end facets of the wire, therefore they do not require polishing or cleaving for high-reflectivity facets as in conventional lasers &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ning|first=C.

==Properties==
Nanowire lasers can be grown site-selectively on Si/SOI wafers with conventional [[molecular beam epitaxy|MBE]] techniques, allowing for pristine structural quality without defects. Nanowire lasers using the group-III nitride and ZnO materials systems have been demonstrated to emit in the visible and ultraviolet, however infrared at the 1.3–1.55 μm is important for telecommunication bands&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koblmüller|first=Gregor|last2=Mayer|first2=Benedikt|last3=Stettner|first3=Thomas|last4=Abstreiter|first4=Gerhard|last5=Finley|first5=Jonathan J.|date=2017|title=GaAs–AlGaAs core–shell nanowire lasers on silicon: invited review|url=http://stacks.iop.org/0268-1242/32/i=5/a=053001|journal=Semiconductor Science and Technology|language=en|volume=32|issue=5|pages=053001|doi=10.1088/1361-6641/aa5e45|issn=0268-1242|bibcode=2017SeScT..32e3001K}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Also, nanowire lasers have shown to store the phase information of a pulse over 30ps when excited with subsequent pulse pairs. Mode locked lasers at the nano-scale are therefore feasible with such configurations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3977">The '''pao''' is an obsolete [[Unit of measurement|unit]] of [[dry measure]] (mass) which was used in South Asia. The name may come from the [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] ਪਾਓ ''páo'', which was a traditional charge of one quarter of a [[seer (unit)|seer]] per every [[maund]] of grain that was weighed, converted into a tax by [[Sawan Mal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/contextualize.pl?p.2.singh.963111 | last = Singh | first = Maya | title = The Panjabi dictionary | location = Lahore | publisher = Munshi Gulab Singh &amp; Sons | year = 1895 | page = 862}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ralph Lilley Turner|Turner]] also cites a [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] word ''pāu'' ({{lang|sd| پاءُ }}) meaning a quarter of a seer.&lt;ref name="Turner"&gt;{{citation | last = Turner | first = Ralph Lilley | authorlink = Ralph Lilley Turner | title = A comparative and etymological dictionary of the Nepali language | url = http://dsal.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/turner/ | location = London | publisher = K.&amp;nbsp;Paul, Trench, Trubner | year = 1931 | page = 371}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author = Parmanand Mewaram | title = A Sindhi-English dictionary | url = http://dsal.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/mewaram | location = Hyderabad | publisher = Sind Juvenile Co-operative Society | year = 1910}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The pao was recorded in the [[Bengal Presidency]] in 1850, but was not considered to be an integral part of the local system of weights. It was equal to four [[chitak]]s, and hence a quarter of a seer: the equivalent [[Imperial units|Imperial weight]] at the time was given as 7&amp;nbsp;[[Ounce|oz.]] 10&amp;nbsp;[[Pennyweight|dwt.]] [[Troy weight|Troy]] (233.3&amp;nbsp;[[gram]]s).&lt;ref name="AHH"&gt;{{citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6LwIAAAAQAAJ | title = The Anglo-Hindoostanee Handbook | location = Calcutta | publisher = W. Thacker &amp; Co. | year = 1850 | page = 206}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of a quarter-seer weight in [[Ahmedabad]] had also been noted in a [[British East India Company]] survey of South Asian metrology carried out in 1821: the name of the unit was not recorded, but it would have been equivalent to 4&amp;nbsp;[[Ounce|oz.]] 3&amp;nbsp;[[Dram (unit)|dr.]] 17&amp;nbsp;[[Grain (unit)|gr.]] [[avoirdupois]] (119.8&amp;nbsp;grams) based on the measurement of the Ahmedabad seer.&lt;ref name="Prinsep"&gt;{{citation | author = Prinsep, James | year = 1840 | title = Useful tables, forming an appendix to the Journal of the Asiatic Society: part the first, Coins, weights, and measures of British India | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LTYGAAAAQAAJ | edition = 2nd | location = Calcutta | publisher = Bishop's College Press | page = 84}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Nepal]], the pao ({{lang-ne|पाउ|translit=pāu}}) was {{frac|12}} of a [[dharni (unit)|dharni]], and equivalent to about 194.4&amp;nbsp;grams in 1966.&lt;ref name="UN"&gt;{{citation | author = Statistical Office of the United Nations | title = World Weights and Measures.

In [[Pakistan]], the pao was slightly heavier, at 233.3&amp;nbsp;grams.&lt;ref name="UN"/&gt;

As to [[Afghanistan]], it was reported in 1950 that 1&amp;nbsp;pao ≈ 1&amp;nbsp;[[Pound (mass)|lb]] (450&amp;nbsp;grams) in [[Kabul]], with four paos to one [[Charak (unit)|charak]] and sixteen paos to a seer.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = https://archive.org/stream/statesmansyearbo030477mbp/statesmansyearbo030477mbp_djvu.txt |  last = Steinberg | first = S.

'''Atmospheric aerosol particles''' – also known as '''atmospheric particulate matter''', '''particulate matter''' ('''PM'''), '''particulates''', or '''suspended particulate matter''' ('''SPM''') – are [[microscopic]] solid or liquid matter [[suspension (chemistry)|suspended]] in the [[atmosphere of Earth]]. The term ''[[aerosol]]'' commonly refers to the particulate/air [[mixture]], as opposed to the particulate matter alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Seinfeld |first=John |author2=Spyros Pandis |title=Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics: From Air Pollution to Climate Change |edition=2nd |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |year=1998 |location=Hoboken, New Jersey |isbn=978-0-471-17816-3 |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sources of particulate matter can be natural or [[anthropogenic hazard|anthropogenic]].

==Sources of atmospheric particulate matter==

Some particulates occur naturally, originating from [[volcano]]es, [[dust storm]]s, [[forest fire|forest]] and [[grassland]] fires, living vegetation and [[sea spray]]. Human activities, such as the burning of [[fossil fuel]]s in vehicles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Omidvarborna |title=Recent studies on soot modeling for diesel combustion |journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews |volume=48 |pages=635–647 |doi=10.1016/j.rser.2015.04.019 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032115002890 |display-authors=etal|year=2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[stubble burning]], [[Power station|power plants]], wet [[cooling tower]]s in cooling systems and various industrial processes, also generate significant amounts of particulates. Coal combustion in developing countries is the primary method for heating homes and supplying energy. Because salt spray over the oceans is the overwhelmingly most common form of particulate in the atmosphere, ''anthropogenic'' aerosols—those made by human activities—currently account for about 10 percent of the total mass of aerosols in our atmosphere.&lt;ref name=nasaaeros&gt;{{cite web |url= http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Aerosols/ |title=Aerosols and Climate Change |last=Hardin |first=Mary |last2=Kahn |first2=Ralph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition ==
{{see|particulate organic matter}}
The composition of aerosols and particles depends on their source.
Wind-blown [[mineral dust]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/168.htm#5221 |title=Primary and Secondary Sources of Aerosols: Soil dust |website=Climate Change 2001: Working Group 1 |publisher=UNEP |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; tends to be made of mineral [[oxide]]s and other material blown from the [[Earth's crust]]; this particulate is [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|light-absorbing]].&lt;ref name=SOA&gt;{{cite journal |title=Nonequilibrium atmospheric secondary organic aerosol formation and growth |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=109 |issue=8 |pages=2836–41 |date=30 January 2012 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1119909109 |pmid=22308444 |bibcode=2012PNAS..109.2836P |last1=Perraud |first1=V. |last2=Bruns |first2=E.

The drift/mist emissions from the wet [[cooling tower]]s is also source of particulate matter as they are widely used in industry and other sectors for dissipating heat in cooling systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wet cooling towers: guide to reporting |url= https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/national-pollutant-release-inventory/report/sector-specific-tools-calculate-emissions/wet-cooling-tower-particulate-guide.html |accessdate=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondary particles derive from the [[oxidation]] of primary gases such as [[sulfur oxide|sulfur]] and [[nitrogen oxide]]s into [[sulfuric acid]] (liquid) and [[nitric acid]] (gaseous). The precursors for these aerosols—i.e. the gases from which they originate—may have an anthropogenic origin (from fossil fuel or coal [[combustion]]) and a natural [[biogenic]] origin. In the presence of [[ammonia]], secondary aerosols often take the form of [[ammonium]] salts; i.e. [[ammonium sulfate]] and [[ammonium nitrate]] (both can be dry or in aqueous [[solution]]); in the absence of ammonia, secondary compounds take an [[acid]]ic form as sulfuric acid (liquid aerosol droplets) and nitric acid (atmospheric gas), all of which may contribute to the health effects of particulates.&lt;ref name="Int Panis"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Int Panis |first=L.L.R. |title=The Effect of Changing Background Emissions on External Cost Estimates for Secondary Particulates |journal=Open Environmental Sciences |volume=2 |pages=47–53 |year=2008 |url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/250144316 |doi=10.2174/1876325100802010047}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondary sulfate and nitrate aerosols are strong [[scattering|light-scatterers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/172.htm#5226 |title=Primary and Secondary Sources of Aerosols: Primary biogenic aerosols |website=Climate Change 2001: Working Group 1 |publisher=UNEP |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is mainly because the presence of sulfate and nitrate causes the aerosols to increase to a size that scatters light effectively.

[[Organic compound|Organic matter]] (OM) can be either primary or secondary, the latter part deriving from the oxidation of [[Volatile organic compound|VOCs]]; organic material in the atmosphere may either be biogenic or [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]]. Organic matter influences the atmospheric [[electromagnetic radiation|radiation]] field by both scattering and absorption. Another important aerosol type is [[soot|elemental carbon]] (EC, also known as ''[[black carbon]]'', BC): this aerosol type includes strongly light-absorbing material and is thought to yield large positive [[radiative forcing]]. Organic matter and elemental carbon together constitute the [[carbon]]aceous fraction of aerosols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/170.htm |title=Primary and Secondary Sources of Aerosols: Carbonaceous aerosols |website=Climate Change 2001: Working Group 1 |publisher=UNEP |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondary organic aerosols (SOAs), tiny "tar balls" resulting from combustion products of internal combustion engines, have been identified as a danger to health.&lt;ref name="NYTSOA"&gt;{{cite news |title=Scientists Find New Dangers in Tiny but Pervasive Particles in Air Pollution |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/science/earth/scientists-find-new-dangers-in-tiny-but-pervasive-particles-in-air-pollution.html |accessdate=19 February 2012 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=18 February 2012 |author=Felicity Barringer |quote=Fine atmospheric particles – smaller than one-thirtieth of the diameter of a human hair – were identified more than 20 years ago as the most lethal of the widely dispersed air pollutants in the United States.

The chemical composition of the aerosol directly affects how it interacts with solar radiation. The chemical constituents within the aerosol change the overall [[refractive index]]. The refractive index will determine how much light is scattered and absorbed.

The composition of particulate matter that generally causes visual effects such as smog consists of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, mineral dust, organic matter, and elemental carbon also known as black carbon or [[soot]]. The particles are hygroscopic due to the presence of sulfur, and SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is converted to sulfate when high humidity and low temperatures are present. This causes the reduced visibility and yellow color.&lt;ref name="Mongolia"&gt;{{cite web| title=Mongolia: Air Pollution in Ulaanbaatar – Initial Assessment of Current Situations and Effects of Abatement Measures| publisher=The World Bank| year=2010| url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/866561468274261208/pdf/529700REPLACEM1paper0FINAL002110110.pdf| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919230954/http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/866561468274261208/pdf/529700REPLACEM1paper0FINAL002110110.pdf| dead-url=yes| archive-date=2016-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Size distribution of particulates==
{{see|#Size, shape and solubility matter}}
Aerosol particles of natural origin (such as windblown [[dust]]) tend to have a larger radius than human-produced aerosols such as [[Particulate pollution|particle pollution]].&lt;ref name=nasaaeros/&gt; The false-color maps in the third image on this page show where there are natural aerosols, human pollution, or a mixture of both, monthly.

Among the most obvious patterns that the size distribution time series shows is that in the planet’s most southerly latitudes, nearly all the aerosols are large, but in the high northern latitudes, smaller aerosols are very abundant. Most of the Southern Hemisphere is covered by ocean, where the largest source of aerosols is natural sea salt from dried sea spray. Because the land is concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere, the amount of small aerosols from fires and human activities is greater there than in the Southern Hemisphere. Over land, patches of large-radius aerosols appear over deserts and arid regions, most prominently, the [[Sahara Desert]] in North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, where dust storms are common. Places where human-triggered or natural fire activity is common (land-clearing fires in the Amazon from August–October, for example, or lightning-triggered fires in the forests of northern Canada in Northern Hemisphere summer) are dominated by smaller aerosols. Human-produced (fossil fuel) pollution is largely responsible for the areas of small aerosols over developed areas such as the eastern United States and Europe, especially in their summer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/GlobalMaps/view.php?d1=MODAL2_M_AER_RA, ''Click for more detail''].&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=December 2014}}

Satellite measurements of aerosols, called aerosol optical thickness, are based on the fact that the particles change the way the atmosphere reflects and absorbs visible and infrared light. As shown in the seventh image on this page, an optical thickness of less than 0.1 (palest yellow) indicates a crystal clear sky with maximum visibility, whereas a value of 1 (reddish brown) indicates very hazy conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/GlobalMaps/view.php?d1=MODAL2_M_AER_OD ''Click for more detail''].&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=December 2014}}

== Deposition processes ==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}
{{Main article|Deposition (aerosol physics)}}
In general, the smaller and lighter a particle is, the longer it will stay in the air. Larger particles (greater than 10 micrometers in diameter) tend to settle to the ground by gravity in a matter of hours whereas the smallest particles (less than 1 micrometer) can stay in the atmosphere for weeks and are mostly removed by [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]. [[Diesel particulate matter]] is highest near the source of emission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://papers.sae.org/2013-01-2741/|title=Behaviour Study of Particulate Matter and Chemical Composition with Different Combustion Strategies|access-date=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any info regarding DPM and the atmosphere, flora, height, and distance from major sources would be useful to determine health effects.

== Controlling technologies ==
{{Main article|Dust collector}}A complicated blend of solid and liquid particles result in [[particulate matter]] and these particulate matter emissions are highly regulated in most industrialized countries. Due to [[Environmental issue|environmental concerns]], most industries are required to operate some kind of dust collection system to control particulate emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://ijates.com/images/short_pdf/1404370755_P118-129.pdf|title = Effect Of Particulate Matter On Plants Climate, Ecosystem and Human Health|date = April 2014|access-date = 3 February 2016|website = |publisher = www.ijates.com|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; These systems include inertial collectors ([[cyclonic separator]]s), fabric filter collectors [[baghouse|(baghouses)]], [[wet scrubber]]s, and [[electrostatic precipitators]].

Cyclonic separators are useful for removing large, coarse particles and are often employed as a first step or "pre-cleaner" to other more efficient collectors. Well-designed cyclonic separators can be very efficient in removing even fine particulates, and may be operated continuously without requiring frequent shutdowns for maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Dry Dust Collection Systems &amp; Bulk Handling {{!}} Cyclonaire|url = https://www.cyclonaire.com/products/dust-collection/|website = Cyclonaire|access-date = 2016-02-03|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dust collector|Fabric filters]] or baghouses are the most commonly employed in general industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.baghouse.com/2011/02/01/the-encyclopedia-of-filters-dust-collection-systems/ | title = The Encyclopedia of Dust Collection | author = Dominick DalSanto}}&lt;/ref&gt; They work by forcing dust laden air through a bag shaped fabric filter leaving the particulate to collect on the outer surface of the bag and allowing the now clean air to pass through to either be exhausted into the atmosphere or in some cases recirculated into the facility. Common fabrics include polyester and fiberglass and common fabric coatings include [[PTFE]] (commonly known as Teflon). The excess dust buildup is then cleaned from the bags and removed from the collector.

Wet scrubbers pass the dirty air through a scrubbing solution (usually a mixture of water and other compounds) allowing the particulate to attach to the liquid molecules. Electrostatic precipitators electrically charge the dirty air as it passes through. The now charged air then passes through large electrostatic plates which attract the charged particle in the airstream collecting them and leaving the now clean air to be exhausted or recirculated.

Besides removing particulates from the source of the pollution, it can also be cleaned in the open air.

==Climate effects==
[[File:Radiative-forcings.svg|thumb|right|2005 radiative forcings and uncertainties as estimated by the IPCC.]]

===Aerosol radiative effects===

====Direct effect====
[[File:Cloud 3.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Particulates in the air causing shades of grey and pink in [[Mumbai]] during sunset]]
The direct aerosol effect consists of any direct interaction of radiation with atmospheric aerosols, such as absorption or scattering. It affects both short and longwave radiation to produce a net negative radiative forcing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=[[Robert Jay Charlson|Charlson]] |first=R.J.|author2=S E Schwartz |author3=J M Hales |author4=R D Cess |author5=J A Coakley |author6=J E Hansen |author7=D J Hofmann |year= 1992|title=Climate forcing by anthropogenic aerosols| journal=Science|volume=255| issue=5043| pages=423–30| doi=10.1126/science.255.5043.423 | pmid=17842894|bibcode = 1992Sci...255..423C }}&lt;/ref&gt; The magnitude of the resultant radiative forcing due to the direct effect of an aerosol is dependent on the [[albedo]] of the underlying surface, as this affects the net amount of radiation absorbed or scattered to space. e.g. if a highly scattering aerosol is above a surface of low albedo it has a greater radiative forcing than if it was above a surface of high albedo. The converse is true of absorbing aerosol, with the greatest radiative forcing arising from a highly absorbing aerosol over a surface of high albedo.&lt;ref name="Haywood2000" /&gt; The direct aerosol effect is a first order effect and is therefore classified as a radiative forcing by the [[IPCC]].&lt;ref name="Forster2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Forster |first=Piers|author2=Venkatachalam Ramaswamy |author3=Paulo Artaxo |author4=Terje Berntsen |author5=Richard Betts |author6=David W Fahey |author7=James Haywood |author8= 2007 |chapter=Contribution of Working Group I to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis, |editors=S.

The SSA tends to unity if scattering dominates, with relatively little absorption, and decreases as absorption increases, becoming zero for infinite absorption. For example, the sea-salt aerosol has an SSA of 1, as a sea-salt particle only scatters, whereas soot has an SSA of 0.23, showing that it is a major atmospheric aerosol absorber.

==== Indirect effect ====
The Indirect aerosol effect consists of any change to the earth's radiative budget due to the modification of clouds by atmospheric aerosols, and consists of several distinct effects. Cloud droplets form onto pre-existing aerosol particles, known as [[cloud condensation nuclei]] (CCN).

For any given meteorological conditions, an increase in CCN leads to an increase in the number of cloud droplets. This leads to more scattering of shortwave radiation i.e. an increase in the albedo of the cloud, known as the Cloud albedo effect, First indirect effect or [[Twomey effect]].&lt;ref name="Twomey1977" /&gt; Evidence supporting the cloud albedo effect has been observed from the effects of ship exhaust plumes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ackerman| first1=A S |first2=O B |last2=Toon | first3=J P |last3=Taylor | first4=D W |last4=Johnson | first5= P V |last5=Hobbs| first6= R J |last6=Ferek|year=2000|title= Effects of Aerosols on Cloud Albedo : Evaluation of Twomey's Parameterization of Cloud Susceptibility Using Measurements of Ship Tracks|journal=Physics| volume=57| issue=16 | pages= 2684–2695 | doi=10.1175/1520-0469(2000)057&lt;2684:EOAOCA&gt;2.0.CO;2|bibcode = 2000JAtS...57.2684A  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[biomass burning]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaufman |first=Y.

An increase in cloud droplet number due to the introduction of aerosol acts to reduce the cloud droplet size, as the same amount of water is divided into more droplets.

====Semi-direct effect====
The Semi-direct effect concerns any radiative effect caused by absorbing atmospheric aerosol such as soot, apart from direct scattering and absorption, which is classified as the direct effect. It encompasses many individual mechanisms, and in general is more poorly defined and understood than the direct and indirect aerosol effects. For instance, if absorbing aerosols are present in a layer aloft in the atmosphere, they can heat surrounding air which inhibits the condensation of water vapour, resulting in less cloud formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ackerman | first1 = A. S. | last2 = Toon | first2 = O. B. | last3 = Stevens | first3 = D. E. | last4 = Heymsfield | first4 = A. J. | last5 = Ramanathan v | first5 = V. | last6 = Welton | first6 = E.

This inhibits the convective uplift of moisture,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Koren | first1 = I. | last2 = Kaufman | first2 = Y. J. | last3 = Remer | first3 = L. A. | last4 = Martins | first4 = J.

The heating of the atmosphere aloft also leads to a cooling of the surface, resulting in less evaporation of surface water. The effects described here all lead to a reduction in cloud cover i.e. an increase in planetary albedo. The semi-direct effect classified as a climate feedback) by the [[IPCC]] due to the interdependence between it and the hydrological cycle.&lt;ref name="Forster2007" /&gt; However, it has previously been classified as a negative radiative forcing.&lt;ref name="Hansen1997"/&gt;

===Roles of different aerosol species===

==== Sulfate aerosol ====
{{Main article|stratospheric sulfur aerosols}}
Sulfate aerosol has two main effects, direct and indirect. The direct effect, via [[albedo]], is a cooling effect that slows the overall rate of [[global warming]]: the IPCC's best estimate of the radiative forcing is −0.4 [[watt]]s per square meter with a range of −0.2 to −0.8 W/m²&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/232.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020620082532/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/232.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=20 June 2002|title=6.7.2 Sulphate Aerosol|website=IPCC Third Assessment Report, Working Group I: The Scientific Basis|publisher=IPPCC|year=2001|accessdate=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there are substantial uncertainties. The effect varies strongly geographically, with most cooling believed to be at and downwind of major industrial centres. Modern [[climate model]]s addressing the [[attribution of recent climate change]] take into account sulfate forcing, which appears to account (at least partly) for the slight drop in global temperature in the middle of the 20th century. The indirect effect (via the aerosol acting as cloud condensation nuclei, [[Cloud condensation nuclei|CCN]], and thereby modifying the cloud properties -albedo and lifetime-) is more uncertain but is believed to be a cooling.

==== Black carbon ====
Black carbon (BC), or carbon black, or elemental carbon (EC), often called soot, is composed of pure carbon clusters, skeleton balls and [[Fullerene|buckyballs]], and is one of the most important absorbing aerosol species in the atmosphere. It should be distinguished from organic carbon (OC): clustered or aggregated organic molecules on their own or permeating an EC buckyball. BC from fossil fuels is estimated by the IPCC in the Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC, 4AR, to contribute a global mean radiative forcing of +0.2 W/m² (was +0.1 W/m² in the Second Assessment Report of the IPCC, SAR), with a range +0.1 to +0.4 W/m². Bond et al., however, states that "the best estimate for the industrial-era (1750 to 2005) direct radiative forcing of atmospheric black carbon is +0.71 W/m² with 90% uncertainty bounds of (+0.08, +1.27) W/m²" with "total direct forcing by all black carbon sources, without subtracting the preindustrial background, is estimated as +0.88 (+0.17, +1.48) W/m²"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bond, T. C. |title=Bounding the role of black carbon in the climate system: A scientific assessment |date= |doi=10.1002/jgrd.50171 |volume=118 |issue=11 |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres |pages=5380–5552|year=2013 |bibcode=2013JGRD..118.5380B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Instances of aerosol affecting climate===
[[File:Mauna Loa atmospheric transmission.png|thumb|350px|Solar radiation reduction due to volcanic eruptions]]
Volcanoes are a large natural source of aerosol and have been linked to changes in the earth's climate often with consequences for the human population. Eruptions linked to changes in climate include the 1600 eruption of [[Huaynaputina]] which was linked to the [[Russian famine of 1601 - 1603]],&lt;ref name="Geology"&gt;[http://www.geologytimes.com/Research/1600_Eruption_Caused_Global_Disruption.asp "1600 Eruption Caused Global Disruption"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110215095449/http://www.geologytimes.com/Research/1600_Eruption_Caused_Global_Disruption.asp |date=15 February 2011 }}, ''Geology Times'', 25 April 2008, accessed 13 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24467948/ Andrea Thompson, "Volcano in 1600 caused global disruption"], MSNBC.com, 5 May 2008, accessed 13 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencecentric.com/news/article.php?q=08042402 "The 1600 eruption of Huaynaputina in Peru caused global disruption"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424000000/http://www.sciencecentric.com/news/article.php?q=08042402 |date=24 April 2008 }}, ''Science Centric''&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the deaths of two million, and the 1991 eruption of [[Mount Pinatubo]] which caused a global cooling of approximately 0.5&amp;nbsp;°C lasting several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last =McCormick|first= M P|author2=L W Thomason |author3=C R Trepte |year= 1995|title= Atmospheric effects of the Mt Pinatubo eruption|journal=Nature|volume=373|issue=6513|pages=399–404|doi=10.1038/373399a0|url=http://jack.pixe.lth.se/kfgu/KOO090_FKF075/Artiklar/P05.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215145220/http://jack.pixe.lth.se/kfgu/KOO090_FKF075/Artiklar/P05.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-02-15|bibcode = 1995Natur.373..399M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stowe | first1 = L.

Aerosols are also thought to affect weather and climate on a regional scale. The failure of the Indian Monsoon has been linked to the suppression of evaporation of water from the Indian Ocean due to the semi-direct effect of anthropogenic aerosol.&lt;ref name="Chung2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chung | first1 = C E | last2 = Ramanathan | first2 = V | year = 2006 | title = Weakening of North Indian SST Gradients and the Monsoon Rainfall in India and the Sahel | url = | journal = Journal of Climate | volume = 19 | issue = 10| pages = 2036–2045 | doi = 10.1175/JCLI3820.1 |bibcode = 2006JCli...19.2036C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Size, shape and solubility matter===
The size of the particle is a main determinant of where in the [[respiratory tract]] the particle will come to rest when inhaled. Larger particles are generally filtered in the [[human nose|nose]] and [[throat]] via cilia and mucus, but particulate matter smaller than about 10 micrometers, can settle in the bronchi and [[lung]]s and cause health problems. The 10-micrometer size does not represent a strict boundary between respirable and non-respirable particles, but has been agreed upon for monitoring of airborne particulate matter by most regulatory agencies. Because of their small size, particles on the order of 10 micrometers or less (PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;) can penetrate the deepest part of the lungs such as the bronchioles or alveoli.&lt;ref&gt;Region 4: Laboratory and Field Operations – PM 2.5 (2008).''PM 2.5 Objectives and History.'' U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.&lt;/ref&gt; when asthmatics are exposed to these conditions it can trigger bronchoconstriction&lt;ref&gt;J.R. Balmes, J.M. Fine, D. Sheppard Symptomatic bronchoconstriction after short-term inhalation of sulfur dioxide Am. Rev. Respir. Dis., 136 (1987), p. 1117&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchor|PM2.5}}Similarly, so called fine PM, (often referred to as ''PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;''), tend to penetrate into the [[gas exchange]] regions of the lung (alveolus), and very small particles (&lt; 100 nanometers) may pass through the lungs to affect other organs. Penetration of particles is not wholly dependent on their size; shape and chemical composition also play a part. To avoid this complication, simple nomenclature is used to indicate the different degrees of relative penetration of a PM particle into the [[cardiovascular]] system. '''Inhalable particles''' penetrate no further than the [[bronchi]] as they are filtered out by the [[cilia]]. '''Thoracic particles''' can penetrate right into terminal [[bronchioles]] whereas PM&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;, which can penetrate to [[alveoli]], the gas exchange area, and hence the [[circulatory system]] are termed '''respirable particles'''.
In analogy, the inhalable dust fraction is the fraction of dust entering nose and mouth which may be deposited anywhere in the respiratory tract. The thoracic fraction is the fraction that enters the thorax and is deposited within the lung's airways. The respirable fraction is what is deposited in the gas exchange regions (alveoli).&lt;ref&gt;Nieuwenhuijsen, M.J. (2003). Exposure Assessment in Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology. London: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The smallest particles, less than 100 nanometers ([[nanoparticles]]), may be even more damaging to the cardiovascular system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=washingtonstory&amp;sid=aBt.yLf.YfOo |publisher=Bloomberg L.P. |title=Pollution Particles Lead to Higher Heart Attack Risk |date=17 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629014447/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=washingtonstory&amp;sid=aBt.yLf.YfOo |archivedate=29 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nanoparticles can pass through cell membranes and migrate into other organs, including the brain. Particles emitted from modern [[diesel engine]]s (commonly referred to as [[Diesel Particulate Matter]], or DPM) are typically in the size range of 100 nanometers (0.1 micrometer). These [[soot]] particles also carry [[carcinogen]]s like [[benzopyrene]]s adsorbed on their surface. Particulate mass is not a proper measure of the health hazard, because one particle of 10&amp;nbsp;µm diameter has approximately the same mass as 1 million particles of 100&amp;nbsp;nm diameter, but is much less hazardous, as it is unlikely to enter the alveoli. Legislative limits for engine emissions based on mass are therefore not protective. Proposals for new regulations exist in some countries,{{which|date=September 2014}} with suggestions to limit the particle ''surface area'' or the ''particle count'' (numerical quantity) instead.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

The site and extent of absorption of inhaled gases and vapors are determined by their solubility in water. Absorption is also dependent upon air flow rates and the partial pressure of the gases in the inspired air. The fate of a specific contaminant is dependent upon the form in which it exists (aerosol or particulate). Inhalation also depends upon the breathing rate of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Lippmann, M., Cohen, B.S., Schlesinger, R.S. (2003). Environmental Health Science. New York: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Another complexity not entirely documented is how the shape of PM can affect health, except for the needle-like shape of [[asbestos]] which can lodge itself in the lungs. Geometrically angular shapes have more surface area than rounder shapes, which in turn affects the binding capacity of the particle to other, possibly more dangerous substances.

The largest US study on acute health effects of coarse particle pollution between 2.5 and 10 micrometers in diameter. was published 2008 and found an association with hospital admissions for cardiovascular diseases but no evidence of an association with the number of hospital admissions for respiratory diseases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newswise.com/articles/view/540721/ Newswise: National Study Examines Health Risks of Coarse Particle Pollution]&lt;/ref&gt; After taking into account fine particle levels (PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; and less), the association with coarse particles remained but was no longer statistically significant, which means the effect is due to the subsection of fine particles.

Particulate matter studies in Bangkok Thailand from 2008 indicated a 1.9% increased risk of dying from cardiovascular disease, and 1.0% risk of all disease for every 10 micrograms per cubic meter. Levels averaged 65 in 1996, 68 in 2002, and 52 in 2004. Decreasing levels may be attributed to conversions of diesel to natural gas combustion as well as improved regulations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baq2008.org/system/files/sw16_Vajanapoom+presentation.pdf Health Effects of Air Pollution in Bangkok] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217174016/http://www.baq2008.org/system/files/sw16_Vajanapoom+presentation.pdf |date=17 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mongolian government agency recorded a 45% increase in the rate of respiratory illness in the past five years (reported in September 2014). Bronchial asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and interstitial pneumonia were the most common ailments treated by area hospitals.

A study In 2000 conducted in the U.S. explored how fine particulate matter may be more harmful than coarse particulate matter. The study was based on six different cities. They found that deaths and hospital visits that were caused by particulate matter in the air were primarily due fine particulate matter.&lt;ref&gt;Laden, F., Neas, L.M., Dockery, D.W. and Schwartz, J., 2000.

Cleveland| publisher=National Council for Science and the Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this manner, high particulate matter concentrations in the atmosphere can lead to growth stunting or mortality in some plant species.

==Regulation==
Due to the highly toxic health effects of particulate matter, most governments have created regulations both for the emissions allowed from certain types of pollution sources (motor vehicles, industrial emissions etc.) and for the ambient concentration of particulates. The [[International Agency for Research on Cancer|IARC]] and [[WHO]] designate particulates a [[List of IARC Group 1 carcinogens|Group 1 carcinogen]]. Particulates are the deadliest form of [[air pollution]] due to their ability to penetrate deep into the lungs and blood streams unfiltered, causing permanent [[DNA]] [[mutations]], [[heart attacks]] and [[premature death]].&lt;ref name="epa.gov"/&gt; In 2013, the ESCAPE study involving 312,944 people in nine European countries revealed that there was no safe level of particulates and that for every increase of 10 μg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, the lung cancer rate rose 22%.

In [[Canada]] the standard for particulate matter is set nationally by the federal-provincial [[Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment]] (CCME). Jurisdictions (provinces and territories) may set more stringent standards. The CCME standard for particulate matter 2.5 (PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;) as of 2015 is 28&amp;nbsp;μg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (calculated using the 3-year average of the annual 98th percentile of the daily 24-hr average concentrations) and 10 μg/m³ (3-year average of annual mean).

====California====
{{Update|section|date=September 2016|22 Jan 2009}}
In October 2008, the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC), within the [[California Environmental Protection Agency]], announced its intent to request information regarding analytical test methods, fate and transport in the environment, and other relevant information from manufacturers of carbon nanotubes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Nanotechnology web page |publisher=Department of Toxic Substances Control |url=http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/TechnologyDevelopment/Nanotechnology/index.cfm |year=2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100101100532/http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/TechnologyDevelopment/Nanotechnology/index.cfm |archivedate=1 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DTSC is exercising its authority under the California Health and Safety Code, Chapter 699, sections 57018-57020.&lt;ref name="chemical_call_in"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Chemical Information Call-In web page |publisher=Department of Toxic Substances Control |url=http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/PollutionPrevention/Chemical_Call_In.cfm|year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These sections were added as a result of the adoption of Assembly Bill AB 289 (2006).&lt;ref name="chemical_call_in" /&gt; They are intended to make information on the fate and transport, detection and analysis, and other information on chemicals more available. The law places the responsibility to provide this information to the Department on those who manufacture or import the chemicals.

On 22 January 2009, a formal information request letter&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Call in letter | date= 22 January 2009 | last = Wong | first = Jeffrey |url=http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/TechnologyDevelopment/Nanotechnology/upload/Formal_AB289_Call_In_Letter_CNTs.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; was sent to manufacturers who produce or import carbon nanotubes in California, or who may export carbon nanotubes into the State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/TechnologyDevelopment/Nanotechnology/upload/AB289_CNT_Contact_List.pdf|title = Contact List for CNT January 22 &amp; 26 2009 Document}}&lt;/ref&gt; This letter constitutes the first formal implementation of the authorities placed into statute by AB 289 and is directed to manufacturers of carbon nanotubes, both industry and academia within the State, and to manufacturers outside California who export carbon nanotubes to California. This request for information must be met by the manufacturers within one year. DTSC is waiting for the upcoming 22 January 2010 deadline for responses to the data call-in.

The California Nano Industry Network and DTSC hosted a full-day symposium on 16 November 2009 in Sacramento, CA. This symposium provided an opportunity to hear from nanotechnology industry experts and discuss future regulatory considerations in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Archived DTSC Nanotechnology Symposia |publisher=Department of Toxic Substances Control |url=http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/TechnologyDevelopment/Nanotechnology/ArchivedSymposium.cfm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100101164727/http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/TechnologyDevelopment/Nanotechnology/ArchivedSymposium.cfm |archivedate=1 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DTSC is expanding the Specific Chemical Information Call-in to members of the nanometal oxides, the latest information can be found on their website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/TechnologyDevelopment/Nanotechnology/index.cfm dtsc.ca.gov] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100101100532/http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/TechnologyDevelopment/Nanotechnology/index.cfm |date=1 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Colorado====
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}
Key points in the Colorado Plan include reducing emission levels and solutions by sector. Agriculture, transportation, green electricity, and renewable energy research are the main concepts and goals in this plan. Political programs such as mandatory vehicle emissions testing and the prohibition of smoking indoors are actions taken by local government to create public awareness and participation in cleaner air. The location of Denver next to the Rocky Mountains and wide expanse of plains makes the metro area of Colorado's capital city a likely place for smog and visible air pollution.

The most concentrated particulate matter pollution resulting from the burning of fossil fuels by transportation and industrial sources tends to be in densely populated metropolitan areas in developing countries such as [[Delhi]] and [[Beijing]].

===Australia===
PM10 pollution in [[coal mining]] areas in Australia such as the [[Latrobe Valley]] in Victoria and the [[Hunter Region]] in New South Wales significantly increased during 2004 to 2014. Although the increase did not significantly add to non-attainment statistics the rate of increase has risen each year during 2010 to 2014.&lt;ref name=Guardian4115&gt;{{cite news|author1=Oliver Milman|title=Call for action on pollution as emissions linked to respiratory illnesses double|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/02/call-for-action-on-pollution-as-emissions-linked-to-respiratory-illnesses-double|accessdate=3 April 2015|work=The Guardian|date=1 April 2015|quote=emissions of a key pollutant linked to respiratory illness have doubled over the past five years}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
Some cities in Northern China and South Asia have had concentrations above 200&amp;nbsp;µg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; up to a few years ago{{when|date=December 2014}}.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The PM levels in Chinese cities have been extreme in recent years{{when|date=December 2014}}, reaching an all-time high in Beijing on 12 January 2013, of 993&amp;nbsp;µg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Mongolia" /&gt;

To monitor the air quality of south China, the U.S. Consulate [[Guangzhou]] set a PM 2.5 monitor on [[Shamian Island]] in Guangzhou, and displays readings on its official website and social platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guangzhou.usembassy-china.org.cn/guangzhou-air-quality-monitor.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110701120727/http://guangzhou.usembassy-china.org.cn/guangzhou-air-quality-monitor.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-07-01|author=Consulate General of the United States of America Guangzhou, China|title=U.S. Consulate Air Quality Monitor and StateAir|publisher=U.S. Department of State|date=n.d.|accessdate=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ulaanbaatar ===
[[Mongolia]]'s capital city [[Ulaanbaatar]] has an annual average mean temperature of about 0&amp;nbsp;°C, making it the world's coldest capital city. About 40% of the population lives in apartments, 80% of which are supplied with central heating systems from 3 combined heat and power plants. In 2007, the power plants consumed almost 3.4 million tons of coal. The pollution control technology is in poor condition. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The other 60% of the population reside in shantytowns (Ger districts), which have developed due to the country's new market economy and the very cold winter seasons. The poor in these districts cook and heat their wood houses with indoor stoves fueled by wood or coal. The resulting air pollution is characterized by raised sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide levels and very high concentrations of airborne particles and [[particulate matter]] (PM).&lt;ref name="Mongolia" /&gt;
Annual seasonal average particulate matter concentrations have been recorded as high as 279&amp;nbsp;µg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (micrograms per cubic meter).{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The World Health Organization's recommended annual mean PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; level is 20&amp;nbsp;µg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs313/en/ WHO | Ambient (outdoor) air quality and health]&lt;/ref&gt; which means that Ulaanbaatar's PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; annual mean levels are 14 times higher than recommended.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

During the winter months in particular, the air pollution obscures the air, affecting the visibility in the city to such an extent that airplanes on some occasions are prevented from landing at the airport.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In addition to stack emissions, another source unaccounted for in the emission inventory is [[fly ash]] from ash ponds, the final disposal place for fly ash that has been collected in settling tanks. Ash ponds are continually eroded by wind during the dry season.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

{{Infobox praseodymium}}
'''Praseodymium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Pr''' and [[atomic number]] 59. It is the third member of the [[lanthanide]] series and is traditionally considered to be one of the [[rare-earth metal]]s. Praseodymium is a soft, silvery, malleable and ductile [[metal]], valued for its magnetic, electrical, chemical, and optical properties. It is too reactive to be found in native form, and pure praseodymium metal slowly develops a green oxide coating when exposed to air.

Praseodymium always occurs naturally together with the other rare-earth metals. It is the fourth most common rare-earth element, making up 9.1&amp;nbsp;[[parts per million]] of the Earth's crust, an abundance similar to that of [[boron]]. In 1841, Swedish chemist [[Carl Gustav Mosander]] extracted a rare-earth oxide residue he called [[didymium]] from a residue he called "lanthana", in turn separated from [[cerium]] salts. In 1885, the Austrian chemist [[Baron]] [[Carl Auer von Welsbach]] separated didymium into two elements that gave salts of different colours, which he named praseodymium and [[neodymium]]. The name praseodymium comes from the Greek ''prasinos'' (πράσινος), meaning "green", and ''didymos'' (δίδυμος), "twin".

Like most [[rare-earth element]]s, praseodymium most readily forms the +3 oxidation state, which is the only stable state in aqueous solution, although the +4 oxidation state is known in some solid compounds and, uniquely among the lanthanides, the +5 oxidation state is attainable in matrix-isolation conditions. Aqueous praseodymium ions are yellowish-green, and similarly praseodymium results in various shades of yellow-green when incorporated into glasses. Many of praseodymium's industrial uses involve its ability to filter yellow light from light sources.

==Characteristics==
===Physical===
Praseodymium is the third member of the [[lanthanide]] series. In the [[periodic table]], it appears between the lanthanides [[cerium]] to its left and [[neodymium]] to its right, and above the [[actinide]] [[protactinium]]. It is a [[ductile]] metal with a hardness comparable to that of [[silver]].&lt;ref name=CRC&gt;{{RubberBible86th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its 59 electrons are arranged in the [[electron configuration|configuration]] [Xe]4f&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;6s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; theoretically, all five outer electrons can act as [[valence electron]]s, but the use of all five requires extreme conditions and normally, praseodymium only gives up three or sometimes four electrons in its compounds. Praseodymium is the first of the lanthanides to have an electron configuration conforming to the [[Aufbau principle]], which predicts the 4f orbitals to have a lower energy level than the 5d orbitals; this does not hold for lanthanum and cerium, because the sudden contraction of the 4f orbitals does not happen until after lanthanum, and is not strong enough at cerium to avoid occupying the 5d subshell. Nevertheless, solid praseodymium takes on the [Xe]4f&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;5d&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;6s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; configuration, with one electron in the 5d subshell like all the other trivalent lanthanides (all but [[europium]] and [[ytterbium]], which are divalent in the metallic state).&lt;ref name=Greenwood1232&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 1232–5&lt;/ref&gt;

Like most lanthanides, praseodymium usually only uses three electrons as valence electrons, as afterwards the remaining 4f electrons are too strongly bound: this is because the 4f orbitals penetrate the most through the inert xenon core of electrons to the nucleus, followed by 5d and 6s, and this increases with higher ionic charge. Praseodymium nevertheless can continue losing a fourth and even occasionally a fifth valence electron because it comes very early in the lanthanide series, where the nuclear charge is still low enough and the 4f subshell energy high enough to allow the removal of further valence electrons.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1235&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 1235–8&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, similarly to the other early trivalent lanthanides, praseodymium has a [[close-packing of equal spheres|double hexagonal close-packed]] crystal structure at room temperature. At about 560&amp;nbsp;°C, it transitions to a [[face-centered cubic]] structure, and a [[body-centered cubic]] structure appears shortly before the melting point of 935&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/4010212-0BbwUC/4010212.pdf "Phase Diagrams of the Elements"], David A. Young, UCRL-51902 "Prepared for the U.S. Energy Research &amp; Development Administration under contract No. W-7405-Eng-48".&lt;/ref&gt;

Praseodymium, like all of the lanthanides (except lanthanum, ytterbium, and [[lutetium]], which have no unpaired 4f electrons), is paramagnetic at room temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cullity|first1=B. D.|last2=Graham|first2=C. D.|year=2011|title=Introduction to Magnetic Materials|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|isbn=978-1-118-21149-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike some other rare-earth metals, which show [[antiferromagnetic]] or [[ferromagnetic]] ordering at low temperatures, praseodymium is [[paramagnetic]] at all temperatures above 1&amp;nbsp;K.&lt;ref name=jackson/&gt;

===Isotopes===
{{main|Isotopes of praseodymium}}
Praseodymium has only one stable and naturally occurring isotope, &lt;sup&gt;141&lt;/sup&gt;Pr. It is thus a [[mononuclidic element]], and its [[standard atomic weight]] can be determined with high precision as it is a constant of nature. This isotope has 82 neutrons, a [[magic number (physics)|magic number]] that confers additional stability.&lt;ref name="Audi"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Audi | first = Georges | title = The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties | journal = Nuclear Physics A | volume = 729 | pages = 3–128 | publisher = Atomic Mass Data Center | date = 2003|doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001 | bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A | last2 = Bersillon | first2 = O. | last3 = Blachot | first3 = J. | last4 = Wapstra | first4 = A.H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This isotope is produced in stars through the [[s-process|s-]] and [[r-process]]es (slow and rapid neutron capture, respectively).&lt;ref name="Cameron"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cameron |first1=A. G. W. |year=1973 |title=Abundance of the Elements in the Solar System |url=http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/1973/1973_Cameron_1.pdf |journal=Space Science Reviews |volume=15 |pages=121–146 |doi=10.1007/BF00172440 |bibcode=1973SSRv...15..121C |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111021030549/http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/1973/1973_Cameron_1.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All other praseodymium isotopes have half-lives under a day (and most under a minute), with the single exception of &lt;sup&gt;143&lt;/sup&gt;Pr with a half-life of 13.6&amp;nbsp;days. Both &lt;sup&gt;143&lt;/sup&gt;Pr and &lt;sup&gt;141&lt;/sup&gt;Pr occur as [[fission product]]s of [[uranium]]. The primary decay mode of isotopes lighter than &lt;sup&gt;141&lt;/sup&gt;Pr is [[beta plus decay|inverse beta decay]] or [[electron capture]] to [[isotopes of cerium]], while that of heavier isotopes is [[beta decay]] to [[isotopes of neodymium]].&lt;ref name=Audi/&gt;

Praseodymium metal tarnishes slowly in air, forming a [[spallation|spalling]] oxide layer like [[iron]] rust; a centimetre-sized sample of praseodymium metal corrodes completely in about a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elementsales.com/re_exp/index.htm |title = Rare-Earth Metal Long Term Air Exposure Test|accessdate=2009-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It burns readily at 150&amp;nbsp;°C to form [[praseodymium (III,IV) oxide]], a [[nonstoichiometric compound]] approximating to Pr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;:&lt;ref name=webelements&gt;{{cite web| url =https://www.webelements.com/praseodymium/chemistry.html| title =Chemical reactions of Praseodymium| publisher=Webelements| accessdate=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tetrafluoride, PrF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, is also known, and is produced by reacting a mixture of [[sodium fluoride]] and [[praseodymium(III) fluoride]] with fluorine gas, producing Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PrF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, following which sodium fluoride is removed from the reaction mixture with liquid [[hydrogen fluoride]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood1240&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1240–2&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, praseodymium forms a bronze diiodide; like the diiodides of lanthanum, cerium, and [[gadolinium]], it is a praseodymium(III) [[electride]] compound.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1240/&gt;

Organopraseodymium compounds are very similar to [[organolanthanide compound|those of the other lanthanides]], as they all share an inability to undergo [[pi backbonding|π backbonding]]. They are thus mostly restricted to the mostly ionic [[cyclopentadienide]]s (isostructural with those of lanthanum) and the σ-bonded simple alkyls and aryls, some of which may be polymeric.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1248&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 1248–9&lt;/ref&gt; The coordination chemistry of praseodymium is largely that of the large, electropositive Pr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ion, and is thus largely similar to those of the other early lanthanides La&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ce&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Nd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;. For instance, like lanthanum, cerium, and neodymium, praseodymium nitrates form both 4:3 and 1:1 complexes with [[18-crown-6]], whereas the middle lanthanides from [[promethium]] to [[gadolinium]] can only form the 4:3 complex and the later lanthanides from [[terbium]] to [[lutetium]] cannot successfully coordinate to all the ligands. Such praseodymium complexes have high but uncertain coordination numbers and poorly defined stereochemistry, with exceptions resulting from exceptionally bulky ligands such as the tricoordinate [Pr{N(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]. There are also a few mixed oxides and fluorides involving praseodymium(IV), but it does not have an appreciable coordination chemistry in this oxidation state like its neighbour cerium.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1244&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 1244–8&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Auer von Welsbach.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|[[Carl Auer von Welsbach]] (1858–1929), discoverer of praseodymium in 1885.]]
In 1751, the Swedish mineralogist [[Axel Fredrik Cronstedt]] discovered a heavy mineral from the mine at [[Bastnäs]], later named [[cerite]]. Thirty years later, the fifteen-year-old [[Vilhelm Hisinger]], from the family owning the mine, sent a sample of it to [[Carl Scheele]], who did not find any new elements within. In 1803, after Hisinger had become an ironmaster, he returned to the mineral with [[Jöns Jacob Berzelius]] and isolated a new oxide, which they named ''ceria'' after the [[dwarf planet]] [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], which had been discovered two years earlier.&lt;ref name="Emsley120"&gt;Emsley, pp. 120–5&lt;/ref&gt; Ceria was simultaneously and independently isolated in Germany by [[Martin Heinrich Klaproth]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood1424&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1424&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1839 and 1843, ceria was shown to be a mixture of oxides by the Swedish surgeon and chemist [[Carl Gustaf Mosander]], who lived in the same house as Berzelius; he separated out two other oxides, which he named ''lanthana'' and ''didymia''.&lt;ref name="Weeks"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ed009p1231 | last = Weeks | first = Mary Elvira |authorlink=Mary Elvira Weeks| title = The Discovery of the Elements: XI.

The metals that formed these oxides were thus named ''lanthanum'' and ''[[didymium]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See:

From p. 356:  ''"L'oxide de cérium, extrait de la cérite par la procédé ordinaire, contient à peu près les deux cinquièmes de son poids de l'oxide du nouveau métal qui ne change que peu les propriétés du cérium, et qui s'y tient pour ainsi dire caché.  Cette raison a engagé M. Mosander à donner au nouveau métal le nom de ''Lantane''."'' (The oxide of cerium, extracted from cerite by the usual procedure, contains almost two fifths of its weight in the oxide of the new metal, which differs only slightly from the properties of cerium, and which is held in it so to speak "hidden".  This reason motivated Mr. Mosander to give to the new metal the name ''Lantane''.)

The heavy pair of [[samarium]] and europium were only removed in 1879 by [[Paul-Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran]] and it was not until 1885 that [[Carl Auer von Welsbach]] separated didymium into praseodymium and neodymium.&lt;ref name=Lost&gt;{{cite book|ref=Fontani|last1=Fontani|first1=Marco|last2=Costa|first2=Mariagrazia|last3=Orna|first3=Virginia|title=The Lost Elements: The Periodic Table's Shadow Side|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ck9jBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA122|pages=122–123|isbn=978-0-19-938334-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since neodymium was a larger constituent of didymium than praseodymium, it kept the old name with disambiguation, while praseodymium was distinguished by the leek-green colour of its salts (Greek πρασιος, "leek green").&lt;ref name=Greenwood1229/&gt; The composite nature of didymium had previously been suggested in 1882 by [[Bohuslav Brauner]], who did not experimentally pursue its separation.&lt;ref name=Lost_p40&gt;{{cite book|ref=Fontani|last1=Fontani|first1=Marco|last2=Costa|first2=Mariagrazia|last3=Orna|first3=Virginia|title=The Lost Elements: The Periodic Table's Shadow Side|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ck9jBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA40|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|page=40|isbn=978-0-19-938334-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occurrence and production==
Praseodymium is not particularly rare, making up 9.1&amp;nbsp;mg/kg of the Earth's crust. This value is between those of [[lead]] (13&amp;nbsp;mg/kg) and [[boron]] (9&amp;nbsp;mg/kg), and makes praseodymium the fourth-most abundant of the lanthanides, behind cerium (66&amp;nbsp;mg/kg), neodymium (40&amp;nbsp;mg/kg), and lanthanum (35&amp;nbsp;mg/kg); it is less abundant than the [[rare-earth element]]s [[yttrium]] (31&amp;nbsp;mg/kg) and [[scandium]] (25&amp;nbsp;mg/kg).&lt;ref name=Greenwood1229&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1229–32&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, praseodymium's classification as a rare-earth metal comes from its rarity relative to "common earths" such as lime and magnesia, the few known minerals containing it for which extraction is commercially viable, as well as the length and complexity of extraction.&lt;ref name=patnaik&gt;{{cite book | last =Patnaik | first =Pradyot  | date = 2003 | title =Handbook of Inorganic Chemical Compounds | publisher = McGraw-Hill | pages = 444–446| isbn =0-07-049439-8 |  url= {{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=Xqj-TTzkvTEC |page=243 }} | accessdate = 2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not particularly rare, praseodymium is never found as a dominant rare earth in praseodymium-bearing minerals. It is always preceded by cerium, lanthanum and usually also by neodymium.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Monazite acid cracking process.svg|frameless|center|730px]]
The Pr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ion is similar in size to the early lanthanides of the cerium group (those from lanthanum up to [[samarium]] and [[europium]]) that immediately follow in the periodic table, and hence it tends to occur along with them in [[phosphate]], [[silicate]] and [[carbonate]] minerals, such as [[monazite]] (M&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[bastnäsite]] (M&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F), where M refers to all the rare-earth metals except scandium and the radioactive [[promethium]] (mostly Ce, La, and Y, with somewhat less Nd and Pr).&lt;ref name=Greenwood1229/&gt; Bastnäsite is usually lacking in [[thorium]] and the heavy lanthanides, and the purification of the light lanthanides from it is less involved. The ore, after being crushed and ground, is first treated with hot concentrated sulfuric acid, evolving carbon dioxide, [[hydrogen fluoride]], and [[silicon tetrafluoride]]. The product is then dried and leached with water, leaving the early lanthanide ions, including lanthanum, in solution.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1229/&gt;

The procedure for monazite, which usually contains all the rare earths, as well as thorium, is more involved. Monazite, because of its magnetic properties, can be separated by repeated electromagnetic separation. After separation, it is treated with hot concentrated sulfuric acid to produce water-soluble sulfates of rare earths. The acidic filtrates are partially neutralised with [[sodium hydroxide]] to pH 3–4, during which thorium precipitates as a hydroxide and is removed. The solution is treated with [[ammonium oxalate]] to convert rare earths to their insoluble [[oxalate]]s, the oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing, and the oxides are dissolved in nitric acid. This last step excludes one of the main components, [[cerium]], whose oxide is insoluble in HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=patnaik/&gt; Care must be taken when handling some of the residues as they contain [[radium-228|&lt;sup&gt;228&lt;/sup&gt;Ra]], the daughter of &lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Th, which is a strong gamma emitter.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1229/&gt;

Praseodymium may then be separated from the other lanthanides via ion-exchange chromatography, or by using a solvent such as [[tributyl phosphate]] where the solubility of Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; increases as the atomic number increases. If ion-exchange chromatography is used, the mixture of lanthanides is loaded into one column of cation-exchange resin and Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; or Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; or Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; is loaded into the other. An aqueous solution of a complexing agent, known as the eluant (usually triammonium edtate), is passed through the columns, and Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; is displaced from the first column and redeposited in a compact band at the top of the column before being re-displaced by {{chem|NH|4|+}}. The [[Gibbs free energy]] of formation for Ln(edta·H) complexes increases along the lanthanides by about one quarter from Ce&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; to Lu&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, so that the Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; cations descend the development column in a band and are fractionated repeatedly, eluting from heaviest to lightest. They are then precipitated as their insoluble oxalates, burned to form the oxides, and then reduced to the metals.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1229/&gt;

==Applications==
Leo Moser (son of Ludwig Moser, founder of the [[Moser Glass]]works in what is now [[Karlovy Vary]] in the Czech Republic, not to be confused with [[Leo Moser|the mathematician of the same name]]) investigated the use of praseodymium in glass colouration in the late 1920s, yielding a yellow-green glass given the name "Prasemit". However, at that time far cheaper colourants could give a similar colour, so Prasemit was not popular, few pieces were made, and examples are now extremely rare. Moser also blended praseodymium with neodymium to produce "Heliolite" glass ("Heliolit" in [[German language|German]]),&lt;!--http://books.google.de/books?id=36dRAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=praseodymium+glass+moser&amp;dq=praseodymium+glass+moser&amp;hl=de&amp;ei=Ptt0TLLYE5KHswalhr2IBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAQ--&gt; which was more widely accepted. The first enduring commercial use of purified praseodymium, which continues today, is in the form of a yellow-orange "Praseodymium Yellow" stain for ceramics, which is a solid solution in the [[zirconium(IV) silicate|zircon]] lattice.  This stain has no hint of green in it; by contrast, at sufficiently high loadings, praseodymium glass is distinctly green rather than pure yellow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kreidl | first1 = Norbert J. | title = RARE EARTHS* | journal = Journal of the American Ceramic Society | volume = 25 | pages = 141 | date = 1942 | doi = 10.1111/j.1151-2916.1942.tb14363.x | issue = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the lanthanides are so similar, praseodymium can substitute for most other lanthanides without significant loss of function, and indeed many applications such as [[mischmetal]] and [[ferrocerium]] alloys involve variable mixes of several lanthanides, including small quantities of praseodymium. The following more modern applications involve praseodymium specifically, or at least praseodymium in a small subset of the lanthanides:&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

The early lanthanides have been found to be essential to some [[methanotrophic]] bacteria living in [[Mudpot|volcanic mudpots]], such as ''[[Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum]]'': lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, and neodymium are about equally effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1462-2920.12249 |pmid=24034209 |title=Rare earth metals are essential for methanotrophic life in volcanic mudpots |date=2013 |last1=Pol |first1=Arjan |last2=Barends |first2=Thomas R.

Intravenous injection of rare earths into animals has been known to impair liver function, but the main side effects from inhalation of rare-earth oxides in humans come from radioactive [[thorium]] and [[uranium]] impurities.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

Such objects may appear in the scrap metal industry if people mistake them for harmless bits of metal.&lt;ref&gt;D M Smith, [http://www.srp-uk.org/srpcdrom/p8-5.doc Radioactive Material in Scrap Metal - The UK Approach], Health &amp; Safety Executive, Midlands Region Specialist Group&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] has provided guides for scrap metal collectors on what a sealed source might look like.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Booklets/SealedRadioactiveSources/pdfs/flyer_public.pdf Could that be a sealed radioactive source?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060322093838/http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Booklets/SealedRadioactiveSources/pdfs/flyer_public.pdf |date=2006-03-22 }}, IAEA&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Booklets/SealedRadioactiveSources/pdfs/handout_scrap.pdf Reducing Risks in the Scrap Metal Industry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614013429/http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Booklets/SealedRadioactiveSources/pdfs/handout_scrap.pdf |date=2006-06-14 }}, IAEA&lt;/ref&gt; The best known example of this type of event is the [[Goiânia accident]], in [[Brazil]].

While some lost-source accidents have not involved the scrap metal industry, they are good examples of the likely scale and scope of a lost-source accident. For example, the [[Red Army]] left sources behind in [[Lilo Training Detachment of Frontier Troops|Lilo]].{{elucidate|date=August 2014}} Another case occurred at [[Yanango]] where an [[Iridium-192|&lt;sup&gt;192&lt;/sup&gt;Ir]] [[radiography]] source was lost and at [[Gilan]], [[Iran]] a radiography source harmed a [[welder]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub1123_scr.pdf The Radiological Accident in Gilan], IAEA (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Radioactive sources have a wide range of uses in medicine and industry, and it is common for the design (and nature) of a source to be tailored to the specific application. Hence, it is impossible to state with confidence what the "typical" source looks like or contains. For instance, [[antistatic]] devices include [[beta emission|beta]] and [[alpha emission|alpha]] emitters: [[polonium]] containing devices have been used to eliminate [[static electricity]] in such devices as paint [[spray paint|spraying]] equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1868414.stm College breaches radioactive regulations], [[BBC News]], 12 March 2002&lt;/ref&gt; An overview of the gamma sources used for [[radiography]] can be seen at [[Radiographic equipment]], and it is reasonable to consider this to be a good overview of small to moderate gamma sources.

== Examples ==
{{main|List of civilian radiation accidents}}
*1930s and 1940s – In the US, [[gold]] which was contaminated with radioactive [[lead-210]] entered the jewelry industry. This was from gold "seeds" used in cancer therapy which had held [[radon]]-222 and were later melted down and recycled after the radon had decayed. The daughter elements left by the radon remained a radioactive hazard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orau.org/ptp/collection/hpposters/goldjewelry.htm Poster Issued by the New York Department of Health (ca. 1981)]&lt;/ref&gt;
*1982 –  In northern [[Taiwan]], radioactive steel scavenged from a nuclear reactor was recycled into [[rebar]] and used in the construction of apartment buildings, principally in [[Taipei]] from 1982 through 1984. Over 2,000 apartment units and shops were suspected as having been built using the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Chiu Yu-Tzu |title=AEC urged to complete radioactive-rebar probe |publisher=[[Taipei Times]] |date=Sep 9, 2003 |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2003/09/09/2003067098 |accessdate=2011-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 10,000 people are believed to have been exposed to long-term low-level irradiation as a result.&lt;ref name="Yu-Tzu_rebar"&gt;{{cite news |author=Chiu Yu-Tzu |title=Radioactive rebar linked to cancer |work=Taipei Times |date=Apr 29, 2001 |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/local/archives/2001/04/29/0000083627 |accessdate=2011-03-20

*December 1983 – [[Ciudad Juárez]], [[Mexico]]. A local resident salvaged materials from a discarded radiation therapy machine containing 6,010 pellets of [[cobalt-60]]. Transport of the material led to severe contamination of his truck. When the truck was scrapped, it contaminated another 5,000 [[metric ton]]nes of steel to an estimated {{convert|300|Ci|TBq|abbr=on}} of activity. This steel was used to manufacture kitchen and restaurant table legs and rebar, some of which was shipped to the US and Canada. The incident was discovered months later when a truck delivered contaminated steel building materials to the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] drove into the facility through a radiation monitoring station intended to detect radiation leaving the facility. Contamination was later measured on roads used to transport the original damaged radiation source. Some pellets were found embedded in the roadway. In the state of [[Sinaloa]], 109 houses were condemned due to use of contaminated building material. This incident prompted the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] and [[United States Customs Service|Customs Service]] to install radiation detection equipment at all major border crossings.&lt;ref name="El Cobalto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.window.state.tx.us/border/ch09/cobalto.html |title=El Cobalto |date=July 1998 |work=Bordering the Future |publisher=Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5WJdA3Qgz?url=http://www.window.state.tx.us/border/ch09/cobalto.html |archivedate=2008-03-14 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*September 1987 – [[Goiânia accident]] in Brazil; four people died from [[caesium]] radiation poisoning during their search for scrap metal, and 249 other people had significant radiation exposure.

*January 2000 – At [[Samut Prakan radiation accident|Samut Prakarn]], a {{convert|15.7|TBq|Ci|abbr=on|lk=on}} [[cobalt-60]] [[teletherapy]] source was stolen and sold as scrap,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub1124_scr.pdf The Radiological Accident in Samut Prakarn], IAEA&lt;/ref&gt; and attempts were made by scrap metal workers to recycle the metal.  Three people died, and thousands of others were exposed to radiation. It was found that at the edge of the scrap yard, the dose rate was about 1 to 10&amp;nbsp;[[sievert|mSv]]·h&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.{{explain|date=August  2014}} The exact location of the source in the scrap yard was determined using a [[fluorescent]] screen which acted as a [[scintillator]]; this device was held on the end of a long pole.
*July 2010 – During a routine inspection at the [[Port of Genoa]], on [[Italy|Italy's]] northwest coast, a cargo container from [[Saudi Arabia]] containing nearly {{nowrap|23 000 kg}} of scrap [[copper]] was detected to be emitting [[gamma radiation]] at a rate of around {{nowrap|500 [[sievert|mSv]]/h.}} After spending over a year in quarantine on Port grounds, Italian officials dissected the container using robots and discovered a rod of [[cobalt-60]] {{nowrap|23 cm}} long and 0.8&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter intermingled with the scrap. Officials suspected its [[provenance]] to be inappropriately disposed of medical or food-processing equipment. The rod was sent to [[Germany]] for further analysis, after which it was likely to be recycled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Curry|first=Andrew|title=Why Is This Cargo Container Emitting So Much Radiation?|url=https://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/10/ff_radioactivecargo/all/1|publisher=Wired.com|accessdate=2011-11-03 |date=2011-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*May 2013 – A batch of metal-studded belts sold by online retailer [[ASOS.com]] were confiscated and held in a US radioactive storage facility after testing positive for cobalt-60.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.sky.com/story/1096486/asos-belts-seized-over-radioactive-studs |title=Asos Belts Seized Over Radioactive Studs |publisher=Sky News |date=28 May 2013 |accessdate=2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physical and chemical compositions ==
The cleanup operation for the [[Goiânia accident]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub815_web.pdf The Radiological Accident in Goiânia], IAEA Vienna (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; was difficult both because the source containment had been opened, and the radioactive material was water-soluble.

In 1983, a [[List of civilian radiation accidents#1980s|different incident in Mexico]] wherein [[cobalt-60]] was spilled in an otherwise similar exposure led to a very different pattern of contamination, since the cobalt in such a source is normally in the form of cobalt metal alloyed with some [[nickel]] to improve the mechanical properties of the radioactive metal. If such a source is abused, then the cobalt metal fragments do not tend to dissolve in water or become very mobile. If a [[cobalt]] or [[iridium]] source is lost at a [[ferrous metal]] scrapyard then it is often the case that the source will enter a furnace, the radioactive metal will melt and contaminate the steel from this furnace. In Mexico, some buildings have been demolished because of the level of cobalt-60 in the steel used to make them. Also, some of the steel which was rendered radioactive in the Mexican event was used to make legs for 1400 tables.&lt;ref name="El Cobalto"/&gt;

== Source melting ==
In the case of some high-value scrap metals it is possible to decontaminate the material, but this is best done long before the metal goes to a scrap yard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mfnl.xjtu.edu.cn/gov-doe-netl/products/em/IndUnivProg/pdf/234.pdf]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.earthvision.net/industryprograms/pdfs/dd/30170.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ferrous scrap ===
In the case of a caesium source being melted in an [[electric arc furnace]] used for steel scrap, it is more likely that the caesium will contaminate the [[fly ash]] or dust from the furnace, while [[radium]] is likely to stay in the ash or [[slag]]. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] provide data about the fate of different contaminating elements in a scrap furnace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/radiation/docs/cleanmetals/tsd/scrap_tsd_041802_ch6a.pdf |accessdate=September 17, 2006 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four different fates for the element exist: the element can stay in the metal (as with [[cobalt]] and [[ruthenium]]); the element can enter the [[slag]] (as in [[lanthanide]]s, [[actinide]]s and [[radium]]); the element can enter the furnace dust or fly ash (as with [[caesium]]), which accounts for around 5%; or the element can leave the furnace and pass through the bag house to enter the air (as with [[iodine]]).

[[Image:Dirtyferrousscrap.png|center|700px|The fates of different elements present in ferrous scrap which is melted in an electric arc furnace. The average of the two extremes is shown and the error bars indicate the possible limits]]

=== Aluminium scrap ===
It is normal to place [[silicon]], [[aluminium]] scrap and [[flux]] in a furnace. This is heated to form molten aluminium. From the furnace three main streams are obtained, metal product, [[dross]] (metal oxides and halides which are skimmed off the molten metal product) and off gases which go to the [[baghouse]]. The cooled waste gasses are then allowed out into the environment.

[[Image:Dirtyaluminiumscrap.png|center|700px|The fates of different elements present in aluminium scrap which is melted in a furnace. The average of the two extremes is shown and the error bars indicate the possible limits]]

=== Copper scrap ===
It is normal that good-quality scrap copper, such as that from a [[nuclear power|nuclear plant]], is refined in one furnace before being refined further in an electrochemical process. The furnace generates impure metal, [[slag]], [[dust]] and gases. The dust accumulates in a bag house, while the gases are vented to the atmosphere. The impure metal from the furnace may be further refined in an electrochemical process.

The average of the two extremes is shown and the error bars indicate the possible limits. The elements present in the scrap end up in different proportions in the impure metal, the slag, the bag-house dust or the exhaust gases that leave the plant via the stack]]

If the copper refinery includes an electrochemical process after the furnace, then unwanted elements are removed from the impure metal and deposited as [[Copper extraction techniques#Electrorefining|anode slime]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13596">'''Rocket Candy''', or '''R-Candy''', is a type of [[rocket propellant]] for [[model rockets]] made with [[sugar]] as a fuel, and containing an [[oxidizer]]. The propellant can be divided into three groups of components: the fuel, the oxidizer, and the additive(s). The fuel is a sugar; [[sucrose]] is the most commonly used. The most common oxidizer is [[potassium nitrate]] (KNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). [[Potassium nitrate]] is most commonly found in household stump remover. Additives can be many different substances, and either act as catalysts or enhance the aesthetics of the liftoff or flight. A traditional sugar propellant formulation is typically prepared in a 13:7 oxidizer to fuel ratio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Richard Nakka's Experimental Rocketry Web Site|url=http://www.nakka-rocketry.net/sucrose.html|website=nakka-rocketry.net|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many different methods for preparation of a sugar-based rocket propellant. Dry compression does not require heating, only the grinding of the components and then packing into the motor. However, this method is not recommended for serious experimenting.&lt;ref name=Jacob&gt;[http://www.jacobsrocketry.com/aer/caramel_candy_propellant.htm Jacob's Rocketry ]&lt;/ref&gt; Dry heating does not actually melt the KNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, but it melts the sugar and then the KNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; grains become suspended in the sugar.

The specific impulse, total impulse, and thrust are generally lower for the same amount of fuel than other composite model rocket fuels, but rocket candy is significantly cheaper.

In the United States, rocket candy motors are legal to make, but illegal to transport without a low explosives users permit. Since they count as [[Amateur rocketry|amateur motors]], a user must launch them at a sanctioned [[Tripoli Rocketry Association]] research launch and must have at least a Tripoli Rocketry Association high power [[High-power rocketry#Certification|level 2 certification]]. Similar laws apply in Canada, the UK, and Australia.

==Components==
Rocket candy can be broken down into three major groups of components: [[fuels]], [[oxidizers]], and additives. The fuel is the substance that burns, releasing rapidly expanding gases that provide thrust as they exit the nozzle. The oxidizer provides oxygen, which is required for the burning process. The additives can be catalysts, to speed up or make the burning more efficient. However, some additives are more aesthetic, and can add sparks and flames to liftoff, or add smoke for ease of following the rocket in the air.

===Fuels===
Many different sugars can be used as the fuel for rocket candy, including glucose, fructose, and sucrose; however, sucrose is the most common. [[Sorbitol]], a [[sugar alcohol]] commonly used as a sweetener in food, produces a less brittle propellant with a slower burn rate. This reduces the risk of cracking propellant grains.&lt;ref name=Nakka&gt;[http://www.nakka-rocketry.net/ Richard Nakka's Rocketry Site]&lt;/ref&gt; Sugars with a double bonded oxygen, such as fructose and glucose, are less thermally stable and tend to caramelize when overheated,&lt;ref name=Jolley&gt;[http://www.ajolleyplace.com/fuel.html The Jolley Rocket Site ]&lt;/ref&gt; but have a lower melting point for ease of preparation. Sugars that only have alcohol groups, like sorbitol, are much less prone to this decomposition. Some other commonly used sugars include [[erythritol]], [[xylitol]], [[lactitol]], [[maltitol]], or [[mannitol]].

===Oxidizers===
The oxidizer most often used in the preparation of sugar motors is [[potassium nitrate]] (KNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Other oxidizers can be used as well, such as [[sodium nitrate|sodium]] and [[calcium nitrate|calcium]] nitrates as well as mixtures of sodium and potassium nitrate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://66.163.168.225/babelfish/translate_url_content?.intl=us&amp;lp=ru_en&amp;trurl=http%3a%2f%2fserge77.rocketworkshop.net%2fcansorb%2fcansorb.htm Serge's Rocket Workshop]&lt;/ref&gt; KNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can be acquired through purchasing a granular “stump remover" from stores that carry garden supplies. Other rarely used oxidizers are ammonium and potassium perchlorate.

Two main issues need to be addressed with respect to the oxidizer if one is using potassium nitrate. The most important issue is the purity of the material. If a purchased material does not perform satisfactorily it may be necessary to recrystallize the KNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The second important issue with respect to the oxidizer portion of a propellant is its particle size. Most propellant makers prefer their KNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ground to a small particle size, such as 100 mesh (about 150&amp;nbsp;µm) or smaller.&lt;ref name=Jacob /&gt; This can be done using a coffee grinder.  Rock-tumblers can also be used to mill into a fine grained well mixed powder.

===Additives===
[[File:Rocket candy samples.jpg|thumb|Left is the sample of the basic mixture, right contains 1% of red iron oxide added]]Additives are often added to rocket propellants to modify their burn properties. Such additives may be used to increase or decrease the burn rate of the propellant. Some are used to alter the color of the flame or smoke produced. They can also be used to modify a certain physical property of the propellant itself, such as plasticizers or [[surfactant]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s to facilitate the casting of the formulation. There are many types of experimental additives; the ones listed here are only the most commonly used.

Metal oxides have been found to increase the burn rate of sugar propellants. Such additives have been found to function best at levels from 1 to 5 percent.&lt;ref name=Nakka /&gt; Most often used are iron oxides. Red iron oxide is used most often as it is somewhat easier to obtain than the [[Iron(III) oxide-hydroxide|yellow]], brown, or black versions. Brown iron oxide exhibits unusual burn rate acceleration properties under pressure.

Carbon in the form of charcoal, carbon black, graphite, etc., can be and sometimes is used as a fuel in sugar formulations.  Most often, however, a small amount of carbon is used as an opacifier, making a visible smoke trail. The carbon acts as a heat sink, keeping a portion of the heat of combustion located in the propellant rather than having it transferred quickly to the motor casing.

If metallic fuels such as aluminum or magnesium are used in a sugar formulation, a danger exists if traces of acids are found in the oxidizer.  Acidic materials can react readily with the metal, producing hydrogen and heat, a dangerous combination. The addition of weak bases helps to neutralize these acidic materials, greatly reducing their danger.

Titanium metal flake or sponge (about 20 mesh in size) is often added to sugar formulations at levels from 5 to 10% in order to produce a sparking flame and smoke on lift off.&lt;ref name=Jolley /&gt;

Surfactants are used to reduce the melting viscosity of sugar propellants. For example, [[propylene glycol]] helps reduce the melt viscosity of sucrose based propellants.&lt;ref name=Nakka /&gt;

===Formulations===
A typical sugar propellant formulation is typically prepared in a 13:7 oxidizer to fuel ratio (weight ratio). However, this formulation is slightly fuel rich.,&lt;ref name=Jolley /&gt; and can be varied by up to 10%. There are many different possible formulations that will allow for flight in amateur rocketry.

==Preparation==
There are a number of different methods for preparing a sugar-based rocket propellant. Other than dry compressed, all of these methods involve heating the propellant. These various methods include: dry compressed, dry heated, and dissolved and heated twice.

In dry compression, the sugar and potassium nitrate are '''individually''' ground as finely as possible, and then mixed in a [[ball mill]] or [[Tumble finishing|tumbler]] to ensure uniform mixing of the components. This mixture is then compressed into the motor tube, similar to a method for loading black powder. However, this method is rarely used for serious experiments, and careful safety considerations should be made before deciding to employ this method. There is a significant chance for self-ignition while mixing, which could lead to serious injury.&lt;ref name=Jacob /&gt;

Another, more common and safer method of preparing a sugar-based rocket propellant is dry heating. First, the potassium nitrate is ground or milled to a fine powder, and then thoroughly mixed with powdered sugar which is then heated. This method does not actually melt the potassium nitrate, as the melting temperature of KNO&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt; is 613 degrees Fahrenheit (323 degrees Celsius), but it melts the sugar and coats the grains of KNO&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt; with the melted sugar. The melting process must be performed using a [[heat spreader]], so as to avoid creating autoignition hot-spots.

James Yawn, a well known amateur rocket experimentalist, advocates for the dissolving and heating method.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamesyawn.net/ James Yawn Rocketry ]&lt;/ref&gt; Dissolving and heating the propellant actually dissolves both elements of the propellant and combines them. First, the KNO&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt; and sugar are placed in a pot or saucepan. Then, just enough water is added to be able to completely dissolve the KNO&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt; and the sugar. The mixture is then heated and brought to a boil until the water evaporates. The mixture will go through several stages, first boiling, then bubbling and spitting, then it will turn to a smooth creamy consistency. There are several advantages to dissolving the sugar and KNO&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt; in water before heating. One advantage is that the KNO&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt; and the sugar do not have to be finely powdered, because they both end up completely dissolved. This method of preparation also causes the resultant propellant to resist caramelization in the pot, giving more time to pack it into the motors.

==Performance==
Sugar based rocket propellants have an average I&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;([[specific impulse]]) of between 115 and 130 seconds. Compare that to the average I&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; of an APCP (Ammonium perchlorate composite propellant), which is 180 to 260 seconds. Sorbitol and KNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; based propellants with a typical 35:65 ratio are capable of an I&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; of between 110 and 125 seconds. However, sorbitol and KNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; rockets with additives have been recorded as having specific impulses of up to 128 seconds.&lt;ref name=Jolley /&gt;

Xylitol and KNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; based rocket propellants are capable of a specific impulse of ~100 seconds. These have an unconfined burn rate of about 1.3&amp;nbsp;mm/s. Overall, sugar rockets can compete fairly well.

Dextrose and KNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; based fuels are capable of  an I&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; of 118 seconds.&lt;ref name=Jolley /&gt;

==Applications==
[[File:Rocket candy BATES grain.JPG|thumb|[[BATES]] grain of basic sorbitol mixture]]Rocket candy is also occasionally known as "caramel candy", a term that was popularized by [[Bertrand R. Brinley]], in his pioneering book on [[amateur rocketry]], ''Rocket Manual for Amateurs'', published in 1960. This propellant was used in some of the amateur rockets described by [[Homer Hickam]] in his best-selling [[memoir]] ''[[Rocket Boys]]''.

Rocket candy was also employed in a small amateur rocket described by Lt. Col. Charles M. Parkin in a lengthy ''[[Electronics Illustrated]]'' article that continued over several issues, beginning in July 1958. Parkin described how to prepare the propellant mixture by using an electric frying pan as a heat source for the melting operation. This article was reprinted in Parkin's book, ''The Rocket Handbook for Amateurs'', which was published in 1959. Parkin's article contributed to the increasing popularity of the rocket candy propellant among amateur rocket groups beginning in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

[[Hamas]] uses a formulation of rocket candy for short range [[Quassam rocket|improvised rocket weapons]], due to an abundance of the required materials.

The [[Sugar Shot to Space]] program was formed with the goal "to loft a rocket powered by a ‘sugar propellant’ into space"&lt;ref name=Sugar &gt;[http://www.sugar-shot.org/project_description.html Sugar Shot to Space Project ]&lt;/ref&gt; equivalent to 100&amp;nbsp;km (62.137&amp;nbsp;mi) in altitude. The ''Double Sugar Shot'' rocket will reach 33&amp;nbsp;km, or one third of the goal altitude.&lt;ref name=Sugar /&gt; The first ''Mini Sugar Shot'' rocket, a prototype of the ''Extreme Sugar Shot'' rocket, reached an altitude of 4&amp;nbsp;km before a catastrophic motor malfunction occurred; contact with the second Mini Sugar Shot rocket was lost at an altitude of nearly 6&amp;nbsp;km going in excess of mach one. The ''Extreme Sugar Shot'' rocket, the rocket expected to meet the goal of entering space, has not yet been completed and is in the development progress.&lt;ref name=Sugar /&gt;

[[File:علبة ستيرنو.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A can of Sterno aflame.]]
'''Sterno''' ("canned heat") is a fuel made from [[denatured alcohol|denatured]] and jellied alcohol. It is designed to be burned directly from its can. Its primary uses are in the food service industry for [[buffet]] heating and in the home for [[fondue]] and as a [[chafing fuel]] for heating [[chafing dish]]es. Other uses are for [[camp stove]]s and as an emergency heat source. It is also a popular fuel for use with toy and model steam and other [[external combustion engines]].  Sterno cans were sometimes taken on trips and used to heat curling irons and hot combs for hairstyling, for use when travelers were not near salons providing these services.

==History==
[[File:Sterno ad 1915.jpg|thumb|1915 magazine ad]]
The Sterno brand and trademark is owned by Sterno Products, a portfolio company of Westar Capital LLC based in [[Corona, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.insideview.com/directory/the-sterno-group-llc|publisher=insideview.com]|title= The Sterno Group LLC |accessdate=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brand was purchased from [[Blyth, Inc.]] in late 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Blyth, Inc. Announces Sale Of Sterno Business (Press release)|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/article/2012-10-29/ahfpJSEjayrc.html|accessdate=10 June 2014|work=Bloomberg|agency=PR Newswire|date=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blyth had acquired the business from [[Colgate-Palmolive]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Company News; Colgate To Sell Heating Fuel Business For $70 Million|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/02/business/company-news-colgate-to-sell-heating-fuel-business-for-70-million.html|accessdate=11 February 2015|work=The New York Times|date=2 October 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name comes from that of the original manufacturer, S.&amp;nbsp;Sternau &amp; Co. of [[Brooklyn, New York]], a maker of [[chafing dish]]es, [[coffee percolator]]s and other similar appliances since 1893. It had previously applied the name to its "Sterno-Inferno" alcohol burner. In 1918, it promoted its Sterno Stove as being a perfect gift for a soldier going overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.loc.gov/resource/sn78004456/1918-08-25/ed-1/?sp=6&amp;st=text|title=Image 6 of The New York Times, August 25, 1918|work=The Library of Congress|access-date=2018-02-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''[[With the Old Breed]]'', [[Eugene Sledge|E.&amp;nbsp;B. Sledge]] describes its use on the battlefields of the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific Theatre]] in 1944 and 1945.

Invented around 1900, Sterno is made from [[ethanol]], [[methanol]], water and an [[amphoteric (chemistry)|amphoteric]] oxide [[gel|gelling agent]], plus a dye that gives it a characteristic pink color. The methanol is added to [[Denatured alcohol|denature]] the product, which is intended to make it too toxic for consumption. Designed to be odorless, a 7 oz (198 g) can will burn for up to two hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.homedepot.com/p/Sterno-CandleLamp-7-oz-Odorless-Canned-Heat-6-Pack-20503/206680428|title=Sterno CandleLamp 7 oz. Odorless Canned Heat (6-Pack)-20503 - The Home Depot|website=The Home Depot|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was discovered while producing [[nitrocellulose]] during the manufacturing process.

Nitrocellulose is a material used in manufacturing explosives and is made by combining shredded wood pulp and adding a nitric sulfuric acid mix. A by-product of the manufacturing process produces a gel-like substance later refined as Sterno.

In 2007, [[NASCAR]] owner/driver [[Michael Waltrip]] and his team had severe penalties handed down by officials. Team Vice-President Bobby Kennedy and Crew Chief David Hyder of Waltrip's No. 55 were ejected from the Daytona International Speedway. Hyder was  fined $100,000 for his involvement with lining fuel tanks and intake valves with Sterno. NASCAR also docked Waltrip 100 owner points and disqualified his qualifying speed for the Daytona 500. Mid-week, NASCAR determined that the then unknown substance was Sterno. When the highly regulated NASCAR fuel was added, the Sterno would liquefy, giving the car an added octane boost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/021207/spr_7944840.shtml |title=Waltrip could face a Sterno penalty |first=Don |last=Coble |work=[[The Florida Times-Union]] |date=February 12, 2007 |quote=[...] inspectors found a gel-like coating inside the manifold. Several engine builders from other teams said the substance appeared to be Sterno, a bluish gel that could provide a hotter, cleaner burn inside the engine to create more horsepower.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a drink==
There are many instances of people drinking Sterno to become intoxicated, i.e. as a form of [[surrogate alcohol]]. Since the alcohol it contains is denatured, Sterno is poisonous. Bluesman [[Tommy Johnson (blues musician)|Tommy Johnson]] alludes to the practice in his song ''Canned Heat Blues'' recorded in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/history/delta/blues/people/tommy_johnson.htm National Park Service, Trail of the Hellhound: Tommy Johnson Accessed on 10/09/11]&lt;/ref&gt; The blues band Canned Heat derived their name from the practice. 

The practice is said to have become popular during [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PyW8a_2bvMsC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;lpg=PA95&amp;dq=sterno+prohibition&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XFJlZmBPnB&amp;sig=TrldGlu2LazLf0hO9C64GjItRLw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Hw3QVOjnO4HQgwSC74LQAw&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=sterno%20prohibition&amp;f=false in google books]&lt;/ref&gt; and during the [[Great Depression]] in [[hobo]] camps, or "jungles", when the Sterno would be squeezed through [[cheesecloth]] or a [[sock]] and the resulting liquid mixed with [[fruit juice]] to make "jungle juice," "sock wine," or "squeeze".&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1798&amp;dat=19620105&amp;id=5vMeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=04sEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7280,483466 "Police Start Drive on Drinkers of Canned Heat"], ''The Sarasota Journal'', January 5, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1956 American documentary ''[[On the Bowery]]'' includes footage of three homeless men straining Sterno cooking fuel to make "squeeze" and then drinking the alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/this-month/movie-news.html?id=473080&amp;name=On-the-Bowery-Lionel-Rogosin-s-Landmark-1956-Documentary "On The Bowery" Turner Classic Movies ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article for the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' in 1961, Capt. James H. Shinaberger, MC, writes about a study of three people who had suffered methanol poisoning as a result of drinking Sterno. One of the patients "had been drinking Sterno for about a week and had been in the city prison for 48 hours when severe abdominal pain and vomiting occurred".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In December 1963, a rash of 31 deaths in [[Philadelphia]]'s homeless population was traced to a local store that knowingly sold Sterno to people for them to consume and get drunk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.leagle.com/decision/1967311211PaSuper100_1294.xml/COMMONWEALTH%20v.%20FEINBERG |title=Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v.

== Origins ==
The cultivation of the olive tree in Terra d'Otranto has been introduced by the Greeks and by Phoenicians. Nevertheless, after the cessation of this activity during the Middle Ages, the [[Basilian monks]] started the first booming market of olive oil of this territory&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sviluppoagricolo.regione.puglia.it/index.php?page=progetti&amp;opz=display&amp;id=10|title=Portale Sviluppo Agricolo|website=sviluppoagricolo.regione.puglia.it|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Geography ==
The extra-virgin olive oil ''Terra d'Otranto'' is produced in the area between the [[Ionian Sea|Ionian]] and the [[Adriatic Sea]], between the ''[[Altopiano delle Murge|Murge]]'' in the province of Taranto and the ''Serre'' next to Lecce. This territory includes all the cities and villages of the province of Lecce, in the eastern part of the province of Taranto and in the municipalities of [[Brindisi]], [[Cellino San Marco]], [[Erchie]], [[Francavilla Fontana]], [[Latiano]], [[Mesagne]], [[Oria, Apulia|Oria]], [[San Donaci]], [[San Pancrazio Salentino]], [[San Pietro Vernotico]], [[Torchiarolo]] and [[Torre Santa Susanna]] in the northern part of [[Salento]]. The limit of the altitudinal range is 517 m. above sea level. The soil is mainly made of limestone&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oliodopterradotranto.it/|title=Olio DOP Terra D'Otranto|website=www.oliodopterradotranto.it|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Murray''' (October 21, 1860 &amp;ndash; July 21, 1929) was an [[United States|American]] [[inventor]] and [[businessman]] who developed [[Power station|electric power plants]] for New York City as well as many electrical devices which influenced life around the world, including the [[dimmer switch]] and [[Fuse (electrical)|screw-in fuse]].  It has been said that he "invented everything from the power plant up to the light bulb".

Murray is considered one of the most [[prolific inventors]] in history after [[Thomas Edison]], holding 462 U.S. [[patent]]s in his name.  However, unlike Edison, Murray did not patent the work of others under his name; the employee would have the patent in their name, and assign it to the Murray company. Also, if Murray worked with anyone else on an invention, their name would be listed on the patent.

==Early life==
Thomas E. Murray was born in [[Albany, New York]], to an Irish family and was one of 12 children. Upon the death of his father when he was nine, he took three jobs to help support his family.

His son, Thomas E. Murray Jr., was also an engineer who worked with Edison.

In 1875, he was an apprentice at the Albany Iron &amp; Machine works. In 1881, at the age of 21, he became the Chief Engineer of the Albany Waterworks. In 1887, [[Anthony N. Brady]] hired Murray to run the power station of the Albany Municipal Gas Co,

Murray was responsible for the power stations that powered [[New York City]] for the first half of the 20th century.  He eventually was in complete charge of all the allied Edison companies in New York City, Brooklyn and Westchester.

'''''Thunder Bay''''' is a 1953 American [[adventure film]] distributed by [[Universal International]], produced by [[Aaron Rosenberg]], directed by [[Anthony Mann]], and stars [[James Stewart]], [[Joanne Dru]], [[Gilbert Roland]], and [[Dan Duryea]]. It was shot in [[Technicolor]] and was released on May 21. This film tells the story of two engineers drilling for oil in the Louisiana gulf while dealing with hostility of the local shrimp fishermen fearing for their livelihood and features the first non-[[western movie|western]] collaboration between Stewart and Mann.

==Plot==
Penniless but full of ideas, Steve Martin ([[James Stewart]]) and Johnny Gambi ([[Dan Duryea]]), engineers who served in the [[Navy]] during [[World War II]], walk down a quiet road on the gulf coast of [[Louisiana]]. Teche Bossier ([[Gilbert Roland]]), owner of the Port Felicity Fish Co., agrees to drive them into the shrimping town Port Felicity for five dollars. Upon reaching their destination, Gambi rents a shrimp boat from Dominique Rigaud ([[Antonio Moreno]]), although the fisherman's daughter Stella ([[Joanne Dru]]) distrusts them immediately.

Gambi and Steve use the boat to show potential investor Kermit MacDonough ([[Jay C. Flippen]]) the location in which they plan to drill for offshore oil. Claiming that he has designed a drilling platform that can withstand any storm, Steve estimates that by investing one million dollars now, they will soon tap an oil reserve worth two billion. His enthusiasm is so infectious that MacDonough agrees to fund the project against the advice of his secretary, Rawlins. However, MacDonough warns Steve that he must discover oil within three months, or his company, due to huge investments made in an offshore oil lease, will put them both out of work.

Several weeks later, Gambi meets and falls for Stella's younger sister Francesca ([[Marcia Henderson]]), but according to custom, she has been betrothed since childhood to Philippe Bayard. After singing a love song in the local gathering place Bon Chance, Philippe is upset to see Francesca enter with Gambi. Teche, who good-naturedly calls the oilmen "foreigners," agrees to help Steve and Gambi, but Stella refuses to accept Steve's statement that oil will be good for the town, claiming that she learned about "their kind" during her stay in [[Chicago]]. Nevertheless, the outsiders hire a crew and begin their search for oil.

When Teche sees dynamite charges being dropped into the gulf, he begs them to stop, believing that the explosions will kill the shrimp and worsen an already dismal shrimping season. Steve maintains that the charges are safe, but Teche returns to town and incites the fishermen to form an angry mob. He scares the mob away by exploding sticks of dynamite behind them and he placates Stella by warning Gambi to stay away from Francesca. Steve gently advises Francesca to "go back to [her] people."

With one month gone, Steve drives the building crew relentlessly and the platform and rig are completed on-schedule. He immediately orders the drilling crew to get started and the exhausted Gambi is relieved when a hurricane warning gives the men an excuse to take the night off. Gambi and his men enter the Bon Chance with Francesca, and Philippe furiously punches his rival and starts a brawl. The sheriff arrests the oilmen and Francesca angrily denounces all the men.

During the storm, Stella visits Steve at the rig, determined to have Gambi fired so he stops seeing her sister. Steve explains to Stella that if he could pull up a resource that has been in the earth for millions of years, then he will truly have accomplished something. Stella finally abandons her suspicion and kisses Steve, but back in town, Philippe persuades Teche to help him destroy the oil rig. With the hurricane winds rising, Philippe climbs onto the platform and lights a bundle of dynamite, but Steve sees him and the two men fight. Philippe trips and disappears under the waves, and Steve, horrified, assumes that Stella was involved in Philippe's plot.

The rig survives the storm, and in the morning, drilling begins. However, eight days before the deadline, MacDonough visits Steve and sadly delivers the news that the board of his company has voted to stop the drilling operation on the following day, fearing a penalty for non-payment on their lease. MacDonough has already spent all of his own money and the crew is unable to work for no pay. Gambi soon returns from town, announcing that he has just married Francesca. Steve punches Gambi, who in retort loudly chastises Steve for having driven him and the men too hard. Steve tells them all to leave, intending to do the drilling himself, whereupon Gambi hesitates and then persuades the crew to remain. While the men are drilling, they discover that the troublesome shrimp that have been clogging the valves are actually the huge golden shrimp that have so long eluded the local fishermen.

Steve later takes Francesca to the rig, infuriating Dominique, who inflames the fisherman by declaring that the oilmen will steal their daughters and destroy the town. At Stella's request, Teche go to warn Steve about the impending mob on its way to the rig. There, Steve feigns ignorance about the golden shrimp and asks Teche if he can help him get rid of the creatures. He then addresses the furious mob to assure the men on their concerns: Francesca's marriage is a happy one and moreover, oil will bring progress to Port Felicity. Despite these words, the mob decides to destroy the structure, but at that moment, oil explodes through the rig and onto the platform. Later on, the fishermen discover that the golden shrimp bed is huge, and consequently, the conflict between the oilmen and the fishermen is resolved. Teche then convinces Steve that Stella was not involved in Philippe's plot and the lovers finally come together.

==Production==
Production for this film started from late September to mid-November 1952. It was filmed in 1.37 to 1 [[full frame]] aspect ratio while it was released in 1.85 to 1 [[anamorphic widescreen]].

The film marked Universal's first use of stereophonic sound, which at the time was presentable only in select theaters. It was also originally planned to be photographed in 3-D, but those plans were scrapped sometime during production.

Most of the picture was shot in [[Morgan City, Louisiana]] while some scenes were shot in [[New Orleans]] and on an oil-drilling barge thirty miles out in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. While filming the scenes on-location in Louisiana, [[Dan Duryea]] slipped and fell from the roof of a tugboat (which appears throughout the film). He suffered a broken rib, contusion, and bruises but was able to continue filming after a day or two of rest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sarahbethonline.com/danduryea/articles/1952-thunderbay-duryeainjured.html Oct. 17, 1952 Article from Nevada State Journal]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Some contemporary reviewers complained that the sound from the film's stereophonic presentation, with its use of three speakers, was loud and distracting.

The film currently has a  6.6/10 rating on [[IMDb]], a 3/5 rating on [[AllMovie]], and an audience score of 59% on the film [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], with an average score of 3.4/5, based on 267 reviews.

==Home video availability==
Universal first released this film on [[VHS]] on March 1, 1992.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Thunder-Bay-VHS-James-Stewart/dp/6300184943&lt;/ref&gt; Then, on June 12, 2007, it was released on [[DVD]] as part of the ''[[James Stewart]] Screen Legend Collection'', a 3-disc set featuring four other films (''[[Next Time We Love]]'', ''[[You Gotta Stay Happy]]'', ''[[The Glenn Miller Story]]'', and ''[[Shenandoah (film)|Shenandoah]]'').&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/James-Stewart-Collection-Shenandoah-Thunder/dp/B000NNUWYS&lt;/ref&gt; This film was re-released on August 30, 2013 as a stand-alone DVD as part of the [[Universal Pictures Home Entertainment#Universal Vault Series|''Universal Vault Series'']].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Thunder-Bay-James-Stewart/dp/B00EVIOXTQ&lt;/ref&gt; (The DVD releases of the movie are not in presented in the film's original 1.33:1 aspect ratio.)

'''Windy Hill Wind Farm''' is a [[wind power]] station near [[Ravenshoe, Queensland|Ravenshoe]] on the [[Atherton Tableland]]s, [[Queensland]], [[Australia]]. Windy Hill has 20 [[wind turbines]] with a generating capacity of 12&amp;nbsp;MW of [[electricity]], providing enough power for about 3,500 homes. The cost of the project was A$20&amp;nbsp;million. It was the first wind farm to be constructed in Queensland and remains the state's largest.

The power station was commissioned in 2000 and was initially operated by the [[Stanwell Corporation]]. In December 2007 Windy Hill was sold to Transfield Services Infrastructure Fund (TSIF) as part of Queensland Government's ClimateSmart 2050 strategy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanwell.com/Files/General_PDF_Files/2008_Annual_Report_Part_1.pdf Stanwell Annual Report]&lt;/ref&gt; A new substation was built to allow the wind farm's power to connect to the existing 66&amp;nbsp;kV transmission line.&lt;ref name="cec"/&gt; RATCH-Australia Corporation bought TSIF in 2011.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3398">[[Lumber]] and [[wood]] products are created from the trunks and branches of [[tree]]s through a series of steps, as follows.

==Harvesting==
Mature trees are harvested from pine plantations and also from native forests. Trees harvested at a younger age can produce smaller logs, which can be turned into lower value products. Factors such as the site and climatic conditions, the species, the growth rate, and [[silviculture]] can affect the size of a mature tree.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.forestlearning.edu.au/australian-forests/wood-production-process/harvesting&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timber mills==
The native hardwood sawmilling industry originally consisted of small family-owned mills, but this has recently changed to include a small number of larger mills. The mills produce large volumes of standard products, and aim to ensure a "standard quality of product, efficiently and safely, at low cost, with rapid production time and high output".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.forestlearning.edu.au/australian-forests/wood-production-process/timber-mills&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Once the timber has manipulated in the required fashion, it can be used for its purpose. There are many different purposes for wood including: plywood, veneer, pulp, [[paper]], particleboard, pallets, craft items, toys, instrument-making, furniture production, packing cases, wine barrels, cardboard, firewood, garden mulch, fibre adhesives, packaging and pet litter. Western Australia has a unique substance called ‘bio-char’, which is made from [[jarrah]] and [[pine]]. Bio-char can be used in the manufacture of silicone and as a soil additive.
Products&lt;ref&gt;http://www.forestlearning.edu.au/australian-forests/wood-production-process/products&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hardwoods and softwoods==
Softwoods, such as the Australian [[eucalyptus]], are highly valued, and are used mainly for [[Wood#Construction|construction]], [[Pulpwood|paper making]], and [[Cladding_(construction)|cladding]]. The term "roundwood" describes all the wood that is removed from forests in log form and used for purposes other than fuel. Wood manufacturing residues, such as sawdust and chippings, are collectively known as "pulp".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.forestlearning.edu.au/australian-forests/wood-production-process/hardwood-softwood&lt;/ref&gt;

==Changes in technology==
Originally, "trees were felled from native forests using axes and hand-held cross-cut saws". This was a slow process involving manual labour. Nowadays, harvesting is done by a small team of contractors, who are aided by various pieces of machinery. Sawmills were traditionally located within forests, so logs had to be transported over long distances and rough terrain to reach their destination. Soon, waterways were used to transport the logs. Later on, logs were transported via tramlines, "first by steam-powered log haulers then by steam-powered locomotives, and finally diesel and petrol-powered locomotives". Even in the modern era, timber is dried in kilns. The first steam railway in Australia opened in Melbourne in 1854. This dramatically changed the nature of timber transportation and made it possible for the sawmilling industry to move inland away from the coast, due to transportation being made quicker and cheaper.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.forestlearning.edu.au/australian-forests/wood-production-process/changing-technologies&lt;/ref&gt;

It has the appearance of a gray metallic powder with [[cubic crystal system|cubic]] [[crystal structure]]. It is highly [[corrosion]] resistant. This Group IV interstitial transition-metal carbide is also a member of [[ultra high temperature ceramics]] or (UHTC). Due to the presence of metallic bonding, ZrC has a [[thermal conductivity]] of 20.5&amp;nbsp;W/m·K and an electrical conductivity (resistivity ~43&amp;nbsp;μΩ·cm), both of which are similar to that for zirconium metal. The strong covalent Zr-C bond gives this material a very high melting point (~3530&amp;nbsp;°C), high [[Elastic modulus|modulus]] (~440&amp;nbsp;GPa) and [[hardness]] (25&amp;nbsp;GPa). ZrC has a lower [[density]] (6.73&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) compared to other carbides like [[Tungsten carbide|WC]] (15.8&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), [[tantalum carbide|TaC]] (14.5&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) or [[hafnium carbide|HfC]] (12.67&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). ZrC seems suitable for use in [[re-entry vehicle|re-entry vehicles]], [[rocket]]/[[SCRAM jet]] [[engine|engines]] or [[supersonic vehicle|supersonic vehicles]] in which low [[density|densities]] and high [[temperature|temperatures]] load-bearing capabilities are crucial requirements.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Like most carbides of refractory metals, zirconium carbide is sub-stoichiometric, i.e., it contains carbon vacancies. At carbon contents higher than approximately ZrC&lt;sub&gt;0.98&lt;/sub&gt; the material contains free carbon.&lt;ref name=baker /&gt;  ZrC is stable for a carbon-to-metal ratio ranging from 0.65 to 0.98.

The group '''IVA''' metal carbides, [[Titanium carbide|TiC]], ZrC, and [[Silicon carbide|SiC]] are practically inert toward attack by strong aqueous acids (HCl) and strong aqueous bases (NaOH) even at '''100'''' C, however, ZrC does react with HF.

The mixture of zirconium carbide and [[tantalum carbide]] is an important [[cermet]] material.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Uses==
[[Hafnium]]-free zirconium carbide and [[niobium carbide]] can be used as refractory coatings in [[nuclear reactor]]s. Because of a low neutron absorption cross-section and weak damage sensitivity under irradiation, it finds use as the coating of [[uranium dioxide]] and [[thorium dioxide]] particles of [[nuclear fuel]]. The coating is usually deposited by thermal [[chemical vapor deposition]] in a [[fluidized bed reactor]]. It also has high emissivity and high current capacity at elevated temperatures rendering it as a promising material for use in thermo-photovoltaic radiators and field emitter tips and arrays.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

It is also used as an [[abrasive]], in [[Cladding (metalworking)|cladding]], in [[cermet]]s, incandescent [[Electrical filament|filament]]s and cutting tools.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Production==
Zirconium carbide is made by carbo-thermal reduction of zirconia by graphite. Densified ZrC is made by sintering powder of ZrC at upwards of 2000&amp;nbsp;°C. Hot pressing of ZrC can bring down the sintering temperature and consequently helps in producing fine grained fully densified ZrC. Spark plasma sintering also has been used to produce fully densified ZrC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3390/ma9070577|pmid=28773697|pmc=5456903|title=Zirconium Carbide Produced by Spark Plasma Sintering and Hot Pressing: Densification Kinetics, Grain Growth, and Thermal Properties|journal=Materials|volume=9|issue=7|pages=577|year=2016|last1=Wei|first1=Xialu|last2=Back|first2=Christina|last3=Izhvanov|first3=Oleg|last4=Haines|first4=Christopher|last5=Olevsky|first5=Eugene|bibcode=2016Mate....9..577W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poor oxidation resistance over 800&amp;nbsp;°C limits the applications of ZrC. One way to improve the oxidation resistance of ZrC is to make composites. Important composites proposed are ZrC-ZrB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ZrC-ZrB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-SiC composite. These composites can work up to 1800&amp;nbsp;°C.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}
