'''100 Crore Club''' is an unofficial designation by the [[Indian cinema|Indian film trade]] and the media, related to [[Languages of India|Indian language]] films that have [[Net income|net]] {{INR}}100 [[crore]] (1 billion [[Indian rupee]]s) or more in [[India]] after deducting the [[entertainment tax]].&lt;ref name=Overview&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/brunch/bollywood-s-100-crore-club/story-QfLp7zFAqDgXNKaJKo1KNP.html|title=Bollywood's 100 crore club|last=Nahta|first=Komal|date=31 May 2012|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|accessdate=1 June 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603054117/http://www.hindustantimes.com/Brunch/Brunch-Stories/Bollywood-s-100-crore-club/Article1-864033.aspx|archivedate=3 June 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2012, the {{INRConvert|100|c}} box office target had become "a new benchmark for a film to be declared a hit",&lt;ref name="Fad"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/100-crore-club-is-just-a-fad-shahid-kapoor/story-0PcKJAKa3jAiaiezagvOWJ.html |title=100 crore club is just a fad: Shahid Kapoor |date=18 June 2012 |work=[[Hindustan Times]] |access-date=29 December 2013 |agency=PTI}}&lt;/ref&gt; and those affiliated with the 100 Crore Club were considered part of the "elite strata" within the [[Bollywood]] film community.&lt;ref name=Ganti&gt;{{cite book|last=Ganti|first=Tejaswini|title=Bollywood: A Guidebook to Popular Hindi Cinema|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2GAdCp1VAf0C&amp;pg=PA66|accessdate=29 December 2013|date=5 March 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136849299|pages=66–}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was succeeded by the [[1000 Crore Club]] in 2017.

==History==
The first Indian film to cross {{INR|100 crore}} worldwide was the 1982 [[Bollywood]] film ''[[Disco Dancer]]'', directed by Babbar Subhash, written by [[Rahi Masoom Raza]], and starring [[Mithun Chakraborty]], with over {{INR}}90 crore [[Gross revenue|grossed]] at the [[List of Soviet films of the year by ticket sales|Soviet box office]].&lt;ref group="n" name="Disco"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cain|first=Rob|title=For Indian Movies, 1,000 Crore Rupees Is The New 100|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/robcain/2017/10/02/for-indian-movies-the-%E2%82%B91000-crore-club-is-the-new-100/|work=[[Forbes]]|date=2 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Indian film to gross over {{INR}}100 crore domestically in India was the [[Salman Khan]] and [[Madhuri Dixit]] starrer ''[[Hum Aapke Hain Kaun]]'' (1994).&lt;ref name="boxofficeindia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://boxofficeindia.com/boxnewsdetail.php?page=shownews&amp;articleid=3826&amp;nCat= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425231804/http://boxofficeindia.com/boxnewsdetail.php?page=shownews&amp;articleid=3826&amp;nCat= |archivedate=25 April 2012 |title=The 100 Crore Worldwide Grossers: 34 Films Since 1994 |publisher=Box Office India |date= |accessdate=19 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014072959/http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=126&amp;catName=MTk5MC0xOTk5|title=Boxofficeindia.com|date=14 October 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 100 Crore Club emerged more than a decade later, when the [[Aamir Khan]] starrer ''[[Ghajini (2008 film)|Ghajini]]'' (2008) became the first Indian film to [[Net income|net]] over {{INR}}100 crore domestically in India,&lt;ref name="rediff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/report/aamir-khans-10-biggest-hits/20141222.htm|title=Aamir Khan's 10 BIGGEST Hits|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; soon after which the term "100 Crore Club" was coined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The 100-crore Club|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/The-100-crore-Club/articleshow/3993923.cms|work=[[The Times of India]]|date=18 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The later Aamir Khan films ''[[3 Idiots]]'' (2009), ''[[Dhoom 3]]'' (2013), ''[[PK (film)|PK]]'' (2014) and ''[[Dangal (film)|Dangal]]'' (2016) expanded the club to 200, 300, 400, 500, 600 and 700 crore. Overseas, the first Indian film to gross {{INR}}100 crore in international markets was the [[Shah Rukh Khan]] and [[Kajol]] starrer ''[[My Name is Khan]]'' (2010),&lt;ref name="ibtimes"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hooli|first=Shekhar|title=Baahubali 2 overseas box office collection: Rajamouli's film beats Chennai Express, Kabali's lifetime record in 1st weekend|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.in/baahubali-2-overseas-box-office-collection-rajamoulis-film-beats-chennai-express-kabalis-725036|work=[[International Business Times]]|date=1 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by ''3 Idiots'' in 2011.&lt;ref name="3idiots2011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Chumbhale|first=Ameya|title=3 Idiots wins over Chinese, collects Rs 11 crore in two weeks|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/3-idiots-wins-over-chinese-collects-rs-11-crore-in-two-weeks/articleshow/11286751.cms|work=[[The Economic Times]]|date=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="china3idiots"&gt;{{cite web|title=Three Idiots Creates History In China|url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/boxnewsdetail.php?page=shownews&amp;articleid=3866&amp;nCat=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107201817/http://www.boxofficeindia.com/boxnewsdetail.php?page=shownews&amp;articleid=3866&amp;nCat=|dead-url=yes|archive-date=7 January 2012|work=30 December 2011|publisher=BoxOfficeIndia.Com|accessdate=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When adjusted for inflation, the first Indian film to gross an adjusted {{INR}}100 crore was the 1940 film ''[[Zindagi (1940 film)|Zindagi]]'', directed by [[P.C. Barua]] and written by Javed Hussain.&lt;ref group="n" name="Zindagi"/&gt; The first Indian film to gross an adjusted {{INR}}100 crore overseas was the 1951 film ''[[Awaara]]'', directed by [[Raj Kapoor]], written by [[Khwaja Ahmad Abbas]], and starring Raj Kapoor and [[Nargis]], becoming a blockbuster in the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref group="n" name="Awaara"/&gt;

In their annual awards for the year 2012, [[2013 Zee Cine Awards|Zee Cine Awards]] added a category "The Power Club Box Office" to recognise directors whose films had reached the 100 crore mark.&lt;ref name="Award"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report-directors-worth-rs100-crore-1790618|title=Directors worth Rs100 crore!|last=DNA|date=20 Jan 2013|work=[[Daily News and Analysis]]|accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 100Crore Club designation has replaced previous Bollywood indications of success which had included great music, the "Silver Jubilee"&lt;ref name="EconTimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2012-02-11/news/31050052_1_box-office-collection-khans-entertainment-tax|title=Business of Bollywood: Why Rs 100 crore is the Biggest Star in Bollywood - Economic Times|last=Nandini Raghavendra|date=11 Feb 2012|work=[[Indiatimes]]|accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the "Diamond Jubilee" (films that ran for 75 weeks in theatres).&lt;ref name="EconTimes2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2012-08-26/news/33386102_1_box-office-movie-rotten-tomatoes|title=Business of Rs 100-cr films: Who gets what and why|last=Binoy Prabhakar|date=28 Aug 2012|work=[[Indiatimes]]|accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concentration on reaching the club has been criticised, with actor and producer [[Arshad Warsi]] stating, "I find this whole Rs. 100 crore club very stupid. How can every film releasing lately do a business of Rs. 100 crores all of a sudden? Instead of this, we need to concentrate on making good films."&lt;ref name="Stupid"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/bollywood/rs-100-crore-club-is-stupid-arshad-warsi/article1-1017742.aspx|title=Rs 100 crore club is stupid: Arshad Warsi|last=Navdeep Kaur Marwah|date=26 Feb 2013|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Hindustan Times'' claims that their magazine ''Brunch'' coined the term.&lt;ref name="Origin"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/brunch/the-brave-new-world-of-indie-films/story-WCxWo5GFhiEbedltqs61eM.html |title=The brave new world of Indie films |last=Khanna |first=Parul |date=6 December 2013 |work=[[Hindustan Times]] |accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the term applied only to the lead male actor.&lt;ref name=Overview/&gt;  Komal Nahta stated that "excluding women from the group is characteristic of an industry which exercises gender discrimination more than other industries."&lt;ref name=Overview/&gt; By 2013, the usage had expanded to variously include the film itself, the director,&lt;ref name=Award/&gt; and the lead female actor.&lt;ref name="women"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/slide-show/slide-show-1-kareena-asin-deepika-bollywoods-rs-100-crore-club-gals/20130903.htm|title=Kareena, Asin, Deepika: Bollywood's Rs 100 crore club gals|last=Joginder Tuteja|date=3 September 2013|work=Rediff.com|accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 100 crore domestic box office became possible in part because of a steady rise in the ticket price, a tripling in the number of theaters and an increase in the number of prints of a film being released.&lt;ref name="ETAug"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2012-08-26/news/33386102_1_box-office-movie-rotten-tomatoes|title=Business of Rs 100-cr films: Who gets what and why|last=Binoy Prabhakar|date=26 Aug 2012|work=[[Indiatimes]] Economic Times|accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, DNA reported that "Filmmakers and distributors too are known to leave no stone unturned in their attempt to cross over to the right side" of the 100 crore mark."&lt;ref name=Award/&gt; ''The Times of India'' cancelled its "Box Office" column in November 2013 because "The stakes of filmmakers have increased so much that they are willing to go any distance to manipulate and jack up their numbers to beat each other's records." and the Times felt they were no longer able to provide accurate enough figures because "Films that have not reached the '100 crore mark but are close will insist that they have reached the `100 crore figure as they can't resist being in the '100 crore club.'"&lt;ref name="NoBO"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-11-23/news-interviews/44388852_1_weekend-numbers-box-office-numbers-small-films|title=Box Office column discontinued|last=Priya Gupta|date=23 Nov 2013|work=[[Indiatimes]]|accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shahid Kapoor]] called the designation a "fad" which was leading to "massy films which are very basic in their understanding and high on entertainment. But if we run only to achieve those figures then we will restrict ourselves as actors"&lt;ref name=Fad/&gt; On the other hand, [[Dibakar Banerjee]], while agreeing with Kapoor about the impact on content stated, "I hope the club stays and grows to many more crores. Films as they do more business boost the confidence of audience and investors alike and everybody benefits."&lt;ref name="Aditi Pant"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/tabloid/i-miss-delhi-winter-dibakar-banerjee/article1-981495.aspx|title=I miss Delhi winter: Dibakar Banerjee|last=Aditi Pant|date=27 December 2012|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Priyanka Chopra]] said that being part of films in the 100 Crore Club allowed her to also do less commercial "women oriented films", and lamented that as of December 2013 no woman oriented films had achieved the 100 Crore Club designation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news-interviews/Films-cannot-change-society-Priyanka/articleshow/26914624.cms?|title=Films cannot change society: Priyanka|last=PTI|date=6 Dec 2013|work=[[Indiatimes]]|accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond Bollywood, the first [[Cinema of South India|South Indian film]] to gross over {{INR}}100 crore worldwide was 2007 [[Rajinikanth]] starring [[Tamil film]] ''[[Sivaji (film)|Sivaji]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2010-10-23/news/27594754_1_theatres-ticket-rates-rajinikanth|title=Rajinikanth's overseas market doubles from Sivaji|publisher=''Economic Times''|date=23 October 2010|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[Telugu film]] to enter the "100 Crore club" was 2009 film by S.S Rajamouli, ''[[Magadheera]]''.&lt;ref name="100CC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.apherald.com/Movies/ViewArticle/125430/7-Telugu-movies-which-entered-100-Crore-club-/|title=100 crores club: Telugu film collections|date=28 April 2016|work=Apherald}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016, ''[[Sairat]]'' become the first [[Marathi language|Marathi]] film to gross over {{INRConvert|100|c}} worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report-success-ka-effect-sairat-to-now-be-remade-in-4-different-languages-2222912|title=Success ka effect: Sairat to now be remade in 4 different languages!  {{!}} Latest News &amp; Updates at Daily News &amp; Analysis|date=12 June 2016|website=dna|language=en-US|access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, ''[[Pulimurugan]]'' became the first [[Malayalam]] film to enter the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://english.manoramaonline.com/entertainment/entertainment-news/mohanlal-pulimurugan-enters-100-crore-club.html| title=It's official: Mohanlal's 'Pulimurugan' enters 100-crore club}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Variations of the "Bollywood 100 Crore Club" came into use, such as the "Bollywood 400 Crore Club" when the [[Shah Rukh Khan]] film ''[[Chennai Express]]'' reported box office receipts of 400 crore in 2013,&lt;ref name="400CC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news-interviews/Rohit-Shetty-dreams-of-a-film-city-in-Goa/articleshow/26658726.cms?|title=Rohit Shetty dreams of a film city in Goa|last=Anisha Francis|date=1 December 2013|work=[[Indiatimes]]|accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Tollywood 600 Crore Club", which relates to [[Telugu cinema|Telugu]] films that have earned over {{INRConvert|650|c}} in 2015 film ''[[Baahubali: The Beginning]]''.&lt;ref name="600CC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.desiretrees.com/baahubali-bahubali-total-worldwide-box-office-collections/|title=Telugu Movie 650 Crores Bhahubali Box Office Collections|work=Desiretrees}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were eventually succeeded by the [[1000 Crore Club]], when ''[[Baahubali 2: The Conclusion]]'' and ''Dangal'' grossed over {{INRConvert|1000|c}} in 2017.

'''Anecdotal''' '''evidence''' is [[evidence]] from [[anecdote]]s, i.e., evidence collected in a casual or informal manner and relying heavily or entirely on personal testimony. When compared to other types of evidence, anecdotal evidence is generally regarded as limited in value due to a number of potential weaknesses, but may be considered within the scope of [[scientific method]] as some anecdotal evidence can be both empirical and verifiable, e.g. in the use of [[case studies]] in medicine. Other anecdotal evidence, however, does not qualify as scientific evidence, because its nature prevents it from being investigated by the scientific method.

Where only one or a few anecdotes are presented, there is a larger chance that they may be unreliable due to [[Cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry-picked]] or otherwise [[Sampling (statistics)|non-representative]] samples of typical cases.&lt;ref name=weiten&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sILajOhJpOsC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PT121#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 75 of Psychology: Themes and Variations] by Wayne Weiten&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=eNsVUGTMcDoC p. 25 in Research in Psychology: Methods and Design], by C. James Goodwin.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, psychologists have found that due to [[cognitive bias]] people are more likely to remember notable or unusual examples rather than typical examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gibson |first=Rhonda |last2=Zillman |first2=Dolf |year=1994 |title=Exaggerated Versus Representative Exemplification in News Reports: Perception of Issues and Personal Consequences |journal=Communication Research |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=603–624 |doi=10.1177/009365094021005003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, even when accurate, anecdotal evidence is not necessarily representative of a typical experience. Accurate determination of whether an anecdote is typical requires [[statistical]] evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz J, Barrett S. ''Some Notes on the Nature of Evidence''.[http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/science.html Link.] Retrieved 26 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Misuse of anecdotal evidence is an [[informal fallacy]] and is sometimes referred to as the "person who" fallacy ("I know a person who..."; "I know of a case where..." etc.) which places undue weight on experiences of close peers which may not be typical. Compare with [[hasty generalization]].

The term is sometimes used in a legal context to describe certain kinds of [[testimony]] which are uncorroborated by objective, independent evidence such as notarized documentation, photographs, audio-visual recordings, etc.

When used in [[advertising]] or promotion of a product, service, or idea, anecdotal reports are often called a [[testimonial]], which are highly regulated&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/press-releases/ftc-publishes-final-guides-governing-endorsements-testimonials/091005revisedendorsementguides.pdf Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising]&lt;/ref&gt; or banned in some{{which|date=December 2015}} jurisdictions.

==Introduction==
In all forms of anecdotal evidence, its reliability by objective independent assessment may be in doubt. This is a consequence of the informal way the information is gathered, documented, presented, or any combination of the three. The term is often used to describe evidence for which there is an absence of documentation, leaving verification dependent on the credibility of the party presenting the evidence.

==Scientific context==
In science, definitions of anecdotal evidence include:

*"casual observations or indications rather than rigorous or scientific analysis"&lt;ref name="yourdictionary"&gt;[http://www.yourdictionary.com/ahd/a/a0294100.html YourDictionary.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312062259/http://www.yourdictionary.com/ahd/a/a0294100.html |date=March 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"information passed along by word-of-mouth but not documented scientifically"{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Anecdotal evidence can have varying degrees of formality. For instance, in medicine, published anecdotal evidence by a trained observer (a doctor) is called a [[case report]], and is subjected to formal [[peer review]].&lt;ref name="Jenicek"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jenicek |first=M. |title=Clinical Case Reporting in Evidence-Based Medicine |location=Oxford |publisher=Butterworth–Heinemann |year=1999 |pages=117 |isbn=0-7506-4592-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although such evidence is not seen as conclusive, it is sometimes regarded as an invitation to more rigorous scientific study of the phenomenon in question.&lt;ref name="Vandenbroucke"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vandenbroucke |first=J. P. |year=2001 |title=In Defense of Case Reports and Case Series |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |volume=134 |issue=4 |pages=330–334 |url=http://www.annals.org/content/134/4/330.short |pmid=11182844 |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-134-4-200102200-00017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, one study found that 35 of 47 anecdotal reports of drug side-effects were later sustained as "clearly correct."&lt;ref name="Venning"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Venning |first=G. R. |title=Validity of anecdotal reports of suspected adverse drug reactions: the problem of false alarms |journal=Br Med J (Clin Res Ed) |year=1982 |volume=284 |issue=6311 |pages=249–52 |pmid=0006799125 |doi=10.1136/bmj.284.6311.249 |pmc=1495801}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anecdotal evidence is considered the least certain type of scientific information.&lt;ref name="isbn0-12-588560-1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Riffenburgh, R. H. |title=Statistics in Medicine |publisher=Academic Press |location=Boston |year=1999 |pages=196 |isbn=0-12-588560-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers may use anecdotal evidence for suggesting new [[hypothesis|hypotheses]], but never as validating evidence.

==Faulty logic==

Anecdotal evidence is often unscientific or [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] because various forms of [[cognitive bias]] may affect the collection or presentation of evidence. For instance, someone who claims to have had an encounter with a supernatural being or alien may present a very vivid story, but this is not [[falsifiability|falsifiable]]. This phenomenon can also happen to large groups of people through [[subjective validation]].

Anecdotal evidence is also frequently misinterpreted via the [[availability heuristic]], which leads to an overestimation of prevalence. Where a cause can be easily linked to an effect, people overestimate the likelihood of the cause having that effect (availability). In particular, vivid, emotionally charged anecdotes seem more plausible, and are given greater weight. A related issue is that it is usually impossible to assess for every piece of anecdotal evidence, the rate of people not reporting that anecdotal evidence in the population.

A common way anecdotal evidence becomes unscientific is through [[fallacy|fallacious]] reasoning such as the ''[[Post hoc ergo propter hoc]]'' fallacy, the human tendency to assume that if one event happens after another, then the first must be the cause of the second. Another fallacy involves [[inductive reasoning]]. For instance, if an anecdote illustrates a desired conclusion rather than a logical conclusion, it is considered a [[faulty generalization|faulty]] or [[hasty generalization]].&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;Thompson B. [http://www.cuyamaca.edu/bruce.thompson/Fallacies/anecdotal.asp Fallacies.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060420154531/http://www.cuyamaca.edu/bruce.thompson/Fallacies/anecdotal.asp |date=April 20, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, here is anecdotal evidence presented as proof of a desired conclusion:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There's abundant proof that drinking water cures cancer. Just last week I read about a girl who was dying of cancer. After drinking water she was cured.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Anecdotes like this do not prove anything.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infidels.org/news/atheism/logic.html |title=The Atheism Web: Logic &amp; Fallacies |website=infidels.org |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030602105657/http://www.infidels.org/news/atheism/logic.html |archivedate=2003-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any case where some factor affects the probability of an outcome, rather than uniquely determining it, selected individual cases prove nothing; e.g. "my grandfather smoked 40 a day until he died at 90" and "my sister never went near anyone who smoked but died of lung cancer". Anecdotes often refer to the exception, rather than the rule: "Anecdotes are useless precisely because they may point to idiosyncratic responses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Scott H. |last=Sicherer |title=Food allergy: When and how to perform oral food challenges |journal=Pediatric Allergy &amp; Immunology |year=1999 |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=226–234 |doi=10.1034/j.1399-3038.1999.00040.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, a statistical correlation between things does not in itself prove that one causes the other (a [[causal]] link). A study found that television viewing was strongly correlated with sugar consumption, but this does not prove that viewing causes sugar intake (or vice versa).

In medicine anecdotal evidence is also subject to [[placebo effect]]s:&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;Lee D (2005). [http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=55090&amp;page=2 Evaluating Medications and Supplement Products.] via MedicineNet&lt;/ref&gt; it is well-established that a patient's (or doctor's) expectation can genuinely change the outcome of treatment. Only [[double-blind]] [[random sample|randomized]] [[placebo]]-controlled [[clinical trial]]s can confirm a [[hypothesis]] about the effectiveness of a treatment independently of expectations.

By contrast, in science and logic, the "relative strength of an explanation" is based upon its ability to be tested or repeated, proven to be due to the stated cause, and verifiable under neutral conditions in a manner that other researchers will agree has been performed competently, and can check for themselves.

[[Witness]] [[testimony]] is a common form of [[evidence (law)|evidence]] in law, and law has mechanisms to test witness evidence for reliability or credibility. Legal processes for the taking and assessment of evidence are formalized. Some witness testimony may be described as anecdotal evidence, such as individual stories of [[harassment]] as part of a [[class action lawsuit]]. However, witness testimony can be tested and assessed for reliability. Examples of approaches to testing and assessment include the use of questioning to identify possible gaps or inconsistencies, evidence of corroborating witnesses, documents, video and forensic evidence. Where a court lacks suitable means to test and assess testimony of a particular witness, such as the absence of forms of corroboration or substantiation, it may afford that testimony limited or no "weight" when making a decision on the facts.

==Scientific evidence as legal evidence==

In certain situations, scientific evidence presented in court must also meet the legal requirements for evidence. For instance, in the United States, expert testimony of witnesses must meet the [[Daubert standard]]. This ruling holds that before evidence is presented to witnesses by experts, the methodology must be "generally accepted" among scientists. In some situations, anecdotal evidence may meet this threshold (such as certain case reports which corroborate or refute other evidence).

Altman and Bland argue that the case report or statistical outlier cannot be dismissed as having no weight: "With rare and uncommonly occurring diseases, a nonsignificant finding in a randomized trial does not necessarily mean that there is no causal association between the agent in question and the disease."&lt;ref name="Altman"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Altman |first=D.

An '''apportionment paradox''' exists when the rules for [[Apportionment (politics)|apportionment]] in a political system produce results which are unexpected or seem to violate [[common sense]].

To apportion is to divide into parts according to some rule, the rule typically being one of [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportion]]. Certain quantities, like milk, can be divided in any proportion whatsoever; others, such as horses, cannot—only whole numbers will do. In the latter case, there is an inherent tension between the desire to obey the rule of proportion as closely as possible and the constraint restricting the size of each portion to discrete values. This results, at times, in unintuitive observations, or [[paradox]]es.

Several paradoxes related to apportionment, also called ''fair division'', have been identified. In some cases, simple ''post facto'' adjustments, if allowed, to an apportionment methodology can resolve observed paradoxes. However, as shown by examples relating to the [[United States House of Representatives]], and subsequently proven by the Balinski–Young theorem, [[mathematics]] alone cannot always provide a single, fair resolution to the apportionment of remaining fractions into discrete equal whole-number parts, while complying fully with all the competing fairness elements.&lt;ref name=Stein2008/&gt;{{rp|227–235}}

==History==
The [[Alabama]] paradox was discovered in 1880,&lt;ref name=Stein2008/&gt;{{rp|228–231}} when census calculations found that if the total number of seats in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] were hypothetically increased, this would decrease Alabama's seats from 8 to 7. An actual impact was observed in 1900, when Virginia lost a seat to Maine, even though Virginia's population was growing more rapidly: this is an example of the population paradox.&lt;ref name=Stein2008/&gt;{{rp|231–232}} In 1907, when [[Oklahoma]] became a state, New York lost a seat to Maine, thus the name "the new state paradox".&lt;ref name=Stein2008/&gt;{{rp|232–233}}&lt;ref name=Caulfield/&gt;

The [[Hamilton method|method for apportionment]] used during this period, originally put forth by [[Alexander Hamilton]], but vetoed by [[George Washington]] and not adopted until 1852,&lt;ref name=Stein2008/&gt;{{rp|228}} was as follows:

* First, the fair share of each state is computed, i.e. the proportional share of seats that each state would get if fractional values were allowed. 
* Second, each state receives as many seats as the whole number portion of its fair share.
* Third, any state whose fair share is less than one receives one seat, regardless of population, as required by the United States Constitution.
* Fourth, any remaining seats are distributed, one each, to the states whose fair shares have the highest fractional parts.

The Hamilton method replaced a rounding method proposed by [[Thomas Jefferson]],&lt;ref name=Stein2008/&gt;{{rp|228}} and was itself replaced by the [[Huntington–Hill method]] in 1941.&lt;ref name=Stein2008/&gt;{{rp|233}} Under certain conditions, it too can give paradoxical results.

==Examples of paradoxes==

===Alabama paradox===
The '''Alabama paradox''' was the first of the apportionment paradoxes to be discovered. The US House of Representatives is [[United States Constitution|constitutionally]] required to allocate seats based on population counts, which are required every 10 years. The [[United States congressional apportionment|size of the House]] is set by statute.

After the [[United States Census, 1880|1880 census]], C. W. Seaton, chief clerk of the [[United States Census Bureau]], computed [[United States Congressional Apportionment|apportionments]] for all House sizes between 275 and 350, and discovered  that Alabama would get eight seats with a House size of 299 but only seven with a House size of 300.&lt;ref name=Stein2008/&gt;{{rp|228–231}} In general the term ''Alabama paradox'' refers to any apportionment scenario where increasing the total number of items would decrease one of the shares. A similar exercise by the Census Bureau after the [[United States Census, 1900|1900 census]] computed apportionments for all House sizes between 350 and 400: Colorado would have received three seats in all cases, except with a House size of 357 in which case it would have received two.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cut-the-knot.org/ctk/Democracy.shtml Cut-the-knot: The Constitution and Paradoxes]&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a simplified example (following the [[largest remainder method]]) with three states and 10 seats and 11 seats.

{| class="wikitable" width="500px"
! colspan="2" | !! colspan="2" | With 10 seats !! colspan="2" | With 11 seats
|-
! State !! Population !! Fair share !! Seats !! Fair share !! Seats
|-
| A || align="right" | 6 || align="right" | 4.286 || align="right" | 4 || align="right" | 4.714 || align="right" | 5
|-
| B || align="right" | 6 || align="right" | 4.286 || align="right" | 4 || align="right" | 4.714 || align="right" | 5
|-
| C || align="right" | 2 || align="right" | 1.429 || align="right" | 2 || align="right" | 1.571 || align="right" | 1
|}

Observe that state C's share decreases from 2 to 1 with the added seat.

This occurs because increasing the number of seats increases the fair share faster for the large states than for the small states. In particular, large A and B had their fair share increase faster than small C. Therefore, the fractional parts for A and B increased faster than those for C. In fact, they overtook C's fraction, causing C to lose its seat, since the Hamilton method examines which states have the largest remaining fraction.

The Alabama paradox is an example of violation of the [[resource monotonicity]] axiom.

===Population paradox===
The '''population paradox''' is a counterintuitive result of some procedures for apportionment. When two states have populations increasing at different rates, a small state with rapid growth can lose a legislative seat to a big state with slower growth.

Some of the earlier Congressional apportionment methods, such as Hamilton, could exhibit the population paradox. In 1900, Virginia lost a seat to Maine, even though Virginia's population was growing more rapidly.&lt;ref name=Stein2008/&gt;{{rp|231–232}} However, divisor methods such as the current method do not.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;

===New states paradox===
Given a fixed number of total representatives (as determined by the United States House of Representatives), adding a new state would in theory ''reduce'' the number of representatives for existing states, as under the United States Constitution each state is entitled to at least one representative regardless of its population. Also, even if the number of members in the House of Representatives is increased by the number of Representatives in the new state, a pre-existing state could lose a seat because of how the particular apportionment rules deal with rounding methods. In 1907, when [[Oklahoma]] became a state, it was given a fair share of seats and the total number of seats increased by that number. The House increased from 386 to 391 members. A recomputation of apportionment affected the number of seats because of other states: New York lost a seat while Maine gained one.&lt;ref name=Stein2008/&gt;{{rp|232–233}}&lt;ref name=Caulfield/&gt;

==Balinski–Young theorem==
In 1983, two mathematicians, [[Michel Balinski]] and [[Peyton Young]], proved that any method of apportionment will result in paradoxes whenever there are three or more parties (or states, regions, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |title=Fair Representation: Meeting the Ideal of One Man, One Vote  |last=Balinski |first=M  |author2=Young HP |year=1982 |publisher=Yale Univ Pr  |isbn=0-300-02724-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |title=Fair Representation: Meeting the Ideal of One Man, One Vote  |edition=2nd |last=Balinski |first=M  |author2=Young HP|year=2001 |publisher=Brookings Institution Press |isbn=0-8157-0111-X }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The theorem shows that any possible method used to allocate the remaining fraction will necessarily fail to always follow quota. More precisely, their theorem states that there is no apportionment system that has the following properties&lt;ref name=Stein2008/&gt;{{rp|233–234}}  (as the example we take the division of seats between parties in a system of [[proportional representation]]):
* It avoids violations of the [[quota rule]]: Each of the parties gets one of the two numbers closest to its fair share of seats. For example, if a party's fair share is 7.34 seats, it must get either 7 or 8 seats to avoid a violation; any other number will violate the rule.
* It does not have the Alabama paradox: If the total number of seats is increased, no party's number of seats decreases.
* It does not have the population paradox: If party A gets more votes and party B gets fewer votes, no seat will be transferred from A to B.

Methods may have a subset of these properties, but can't have all of them:
* A method may follow quota and be free of the Alabama paradox. Balinski and Young constructed a method that does so, although it is not in common political use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Balinski |first=M  |author2=Young HP |year=1974 |title=A new method for congressional apportionment |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=71 |issue=11  |pages=4602–4606 |doi=10.1073/pnas.71.11.4602|pmc=433936 |pmid=16592200}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A method may be free of both the Alabama paradox and the population paradox. These methods are [[Highest averages method|divisor methods]],&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rangevoting.org/Apportion.html |title=Apportionment and rounding schemes |last=Smith |first=WD}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Huntington-Hill method|Huntington-Hill]], the method currently used to apportion House of Representatives seats, is one of them. However, these methods will necessarily fail to always follow quota in other circumstances.
* No method may always follow quota and be free of the population paradox.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;

The division of seats in an election is a prominent cultural concern. In 1876, the United States [[United States presidential election, 1876|presidential election]] turned on the method by which the remaining fraction was calculated. [[Rutherford Hayes]] received 185 electoral college votes, and [[Samuel Tilden]] received 184. Tilden won the popular vote. With a different rounding method the final electoral college tally would have reversed.&lt;ref name=Stein2008/&gt;{{rp|228}} However, many mathematically analogous situations arise in which quantities are to be divided into discrete equal chunks.&lt;ref name=Stein2008/&gt;{{rp|233}} The Balinski–Young theorem applies in these situations: it indicates that although very reasonable approximations can be made, there is no mathematically rigorous way in which to reconcile the small remaining fraction while complying with all the competing fairness elements.&lt;ref name=Stein2008/&gt;{{rp|233}}

'''Bahinabai Chaudhari''' ([[Devanagari]]: बहिणाबाई चौधरी) (11 August 1880 [नागपंचमी] – 3 December 1951) was an illiterate cotton farmer from the [[Jalgaon district]] in [[Maharashtra]], [[India]] who became a noted [[Marathi language|Marathi]] poet posthumously.&lt;ref name=n&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nashikcorporation.com/html/personalities/index.shtml|title=Famous Personalities|publisher=Nashik Municipal Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women Writing in India|last=Tharu|first=Susie|last2=Lalita|first2=K.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1993|isbn=0195631951|volume=1|location=New Delhi|pages=352–53|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Bahinabai was born in a [[Mahajan]] family at Asode in [[Khandesh]] region of the present-day [[Jalgaon district]] in the year 1880. She had 3 brothers and 3 sisters. At the age of 13,[1893] she was married to Nathuji Khanderao Chaudhari. Following her husband's death,[1910] she led a very difficult life because of the economic, social, cultural, and emotional circumstances arising out of widowhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://marathilevasamaj.org/bahinabai-chaudhary.html|title=Marathi Leva Samaj|website=marathilevasamaj.org|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had a daughter named Kashi and two sons, Madhusudan and Sopandev (1907-1982).

== Poetic Compositions ==
Bahinabai composed her songs verbally in ''ovi'' (ओवी) metre in a mixture of two dialects: Khandesi and Varhadi.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zelliot|first=Eleanor|year=1982|title=A Note on Bahinabai Chaudhari|url=|journal=Journal of South Asian Literature|volume=17|issue=1|pages=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her son Sopandev, who became a well-known poet, transcribed them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; According to one account, Sopandev read the story of Savitri and Satyavan to his mother from his textbook, and by the next morning, she had composed a song of the tale.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Impressed by her talent, he began writing down of her songs in a notebook. Her poetry is characterized as reflective and abstract with iconic and realist imagery.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It captures the essence of her life, reflects the culture of village and farming life, and presents her wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nmu.ac.in/bcsrc/en-us/home.aspx|title=Kavayatri Bahinabai Chaudhari Study and Research Centre &gt; Home|last=Centre|first=Kavayatri Bahinabai Chaudhari Study and Research|website=www.nmu.ac.in|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Posthumous Publication ==
After his mother's death on 03 Decembar 1951, Sopandev found the notebook and shared one of her poems with [[Pralhad Keshav Atre|Prahlād Keshav (Acharya) Atre]]'s attention. Atre recounts calling the first of Bahinabai's poems he heard "pure gold" in his introduction to the collection published under the title ''Bahinabainchi gani'' [Bahinabai's Songs] in 1952 by Suchitra Prakashan. Although the many of Bahinabai's poems were lost, 732 of them were preserved.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Yeshwantrao Chavan Maharashtra Open University has recommended ''Bahinabainchi gani'' as a part of their curriculum since June 2012.

== Family ==
Sopandev's son Madhusudhan Chaudhari served in the police forces and retired as an Assistant Commissioner of Police in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. The late Madhusudhan Chaudhari's son Rajeev Chaudhari—the great-grandson of Bahinabai Chaudhari—and his mother Suchitra Chaudhari continue to be the sole publishers of ''Bahinabainchi gani'' in whose name the publication house Suchitra Prakashan operates.

'''''Bhabhi''''' ([[Hindi language|Hindi]]: {{lang|hi|भाभी}}, {{transl|hi|''bhābhī''}}) means 'elder brother’s wife', also used by [[Indian people|Indian]] and [[Pakistani]] men to address wives of friends, colleagues and even wives of strangers when an unknown couple of similar age presents themselves.&lt;ref name=hinkhoj&gt;{{cite web|title=Get Meaning of भाभी in English|url=http://dict.hinkhoj.com/words/meaning-of-भाभी-in-english.html|publisher=Hinkhoj.com|accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Familial role==
In a traditional joint North Indian family, an elder brother's wife is called Bhabhi by his younger brothers. The wife of the eldest brother is traditionally considered to have higher authority over the matters of the house, and is given the charge of running household affairs. The younger brothers’ wives traditionally seek her advice and permission in regards to many matters/decisions regarding the household, and the rearing of children. In popular culture, Hindi dramas typically display these relationships as contentious, as the ''bhabhi'' frequently abuses her position of power.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}
The term Bhabhi is also used to address a friend's wife, as a general term of respect. A bhabhi can also play the role of a mother, if both parents are dead, and in such cases the bhabhi often does raise her husband's younger siblings. She can be quite a pillar in a family. The relation between the bhabhi and the younger siblings of the husband is considered as one where a lot of humor is allowed, and  the siblings, "devar" in case of a brother and "nanad" in case of a sister of the husband, may turn to the bhabhi to seek advice in personal matters, whereas they might feel shy in seeking the advice of their parents or elder

[[Image:Attic,_Elips.jpg|thumb|256px|One example of a catwalk with a number of lighting instruments]]A '''catwalk''' is an elevated service platform from which many of the technical functions of a [[theater]], such as lighting and sound, may be manipulated.

== Function ==
Catwalks are used to suspend lighting instruments and microphones directed at the [[Stage (theatre)|stage]]. The catwalks provide easy access for theater personnel to perform common tasks. For example lights may need to be accessed for maintenance, position adjustment, or addition and removal of [[color gel|gels]] and [[gobo (lighting)|gobos]].

== Placement ==
Typically, catwalks are located in positions hidden from audience view or directly above an audience, and are considered "behind-the-scenes". For example, many [[proscenium]] theaters have a series of two or more catwalks running parallel to the [[proscenium arch]] above a false ceiling. Stairs or a ladder up to the catwalks is usually located somewhere backstage. In modern theatres, many architects design catwalks into the "look" of the theatre. In [[black box theater|black box]] theatres, catwalks and pipe grids may be the only architectural feature.

A catwalk may also be placed [[Parts of a theater|upstage]] of the [[proscenium]] as part of the [[fly system]].  These may be fixed, or they may be able to be raised and lowered.

== Construction ==
===Structural===
[[Image:Catwalk1b.JPG|thumb|256 px|A Hub Electric designed catwalk]]
Most catwalks have several battens (pipes) that lighting fixtures may be attached to. Lights are usually attached by a [[C-Clamp (stagecraft)|C-Clamp]] or a hook clamp around the pipes. In addition to this primary attachment, fixtures generally have an additional safety cable attaching them to the catwalk, so that if the clamp or bolt gives way, the safety cable will catch the light. This is used because the lights are generally very expensive and heavy, but mainly to protect the audience members and performers from the possibility of fixtures falling down from the catwalks. Catwalks often include a platform for a [[spotlight operator]] to work from.

===Electrical===
A typical catwalk has a built in [[Electrical conduit]] to carry power for the lighting fixtures from the [[dimmer]]s. They often hold other electrical wiring, for example standard sockets for tools, [[coaxial cable]] for projection and video monitors, built-in safety lighting to protect technicians, audio cables, and special cables for headset communications with other technicians.

==Safety==
Since a catwalk is usually placed high above the floor, spaces where lighting instruments can go are usually chained or otherwise blocked off when a light is not present to prevent people and/or objects from falling through. The instruments themselves are attached by a safety chain to prevent them from falling. Technicians normally attach objects (such as [[wrench]]es) to themselves before going onto the catwalk, so that such objects cannot fall and possibly injure someone or damage something. This also prevents objects from falling into a place where they cannot be retrieved, such as between the catwalk floor and the ceiling, or into an [[HVAC]] vent.

Sometimes, to create better lighting positions or allow more flexibility, catwalks have minimal railings. Because of this, sometimes it is necessary for people working on them to wear [[fall arrest]] to satisfy safety requirements, as the railing cannot be considered sufficient.

'''Co-option''' (also '''co-optation''', sometimes spelled '''coöption''' or '''coöptation''') has two common meanings. It may refer to the process of adding members to an elite [[Social group|group]] at the discretion of members of the body, usually to manage opposition and so maintain the stability of the group. Outsiders are ‘co-opted’ by being given a degree of power on the grounds of their élite status, specialist knowledge, or potential ability to threaten essential commitments or goals ("formal co-optation").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/co-optation "Co-optation" Dictionary of Sociology, Oxford University Press 1998.]&lt;/ref&gt;  

In a classic 1979 article for ''Harvard Business Review'', consultants [[John Kotter]] and [[Leonard Schlesinger]] presented co-optation as a "form of manipulation" for dealing with employees who are resistant to new management programs: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Co-opting an individual usually involves giving him or her a desirable role in the design or implementation of the change. Co-opting a group involves giving one of its leaders, or someone it respects, a key role in the design or implementation of a change. This is not a form of participation, however, because the initiators do not want the advice of the co-opted, merely his or her endorsement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hbr.org/2008/07/choosing-strategies-for-change John P. Kotter and Leonard A. Schlesinger, "Choosing Strategies for Change" ''Harvard Business Review'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Co-optation also refers to the process by which a group subsumes or acculturates a smaller or weaker group with related interests; or, similarly, the process by which one group gains converts from another group by replicating some aspects of it without adopting the full program or ideal ("informal co-optation"). Co-optation is associated with the cultural tactic of [[Recuperation (politics)|recuperation]], and is often understood to be synonymous with it.&lt;ref&gt;Kurczynski, Karen [https://books.google.com/books?id=RXnBTZK1DvgC&amp;pg=PA295 ''Expression as vandalism: Asger Jorn's "Modifications"''], in ''RES: Anthropology and Aesthetics'' No. 53/54 (Spring - Autumn, 2008), pp.295-6. Quotation: {{quotation|the process by which those who control the spectacular culture, embodied most obviously in the mass media, co-opt all revolutionary ideas by publicizing a neutralized version of them, literally turning oppositional tactics into ideology. [] The SI {[[Situationist International]]} identified the threat of revolutionary tactics being absorbed and defused as reformist elements. [] The SI pinpointed the increasingly evident problem of capitalist institutions subverting the terms of oppositional movements for their own uses [] recuperation operated on all fronts: in advertising, in academics, in public political discourse, in the marginal discourses of leftist factions, and so on.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First sense==
===Reasons for use===
Two common uses of co-option are firstly, to recruit members who have specific skills or abilities needed by the group which are not available among existing members. Secondly, to fill vacancies which could not be filled by the usual process (normally election), e.g. if suitable candidates appear subsequently.  Co-opted members may or may not have the same rights as the elected members of a group (such as the right to vote on motions), depending on the rules of the group. Sociologist [[William Gamson]] defined co-optation as "challengers gaining access to the public policy process but without achieving actual policy changes." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470674871.wbespm054/abstract|title=The Wiley-Blackwell Encyclopedia of Social and Political Movements|last=Coy|first=Patrick G.|date=2013|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd|isbn=9780470674871|language=en|doi=10.1002/9780470674871.wbespm054/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limitations on use===
If a group is elected or appointed based on its members representing specific [[constituency|constituencies]], co-option to fill vacancies is inappropriate, as a member selected by existing members will not necessarily represent the interests of the group represented by the vacating member.  In this case, vacancies may be filled via a mechanism specified in its rules, such as a [[by-election]].  Examples are:
* geographical constituencies (as used in [[legislatures]] in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]])
* constituencies of adherents to a [[political party]], known as [[proportional representation]] (as used in legislatures in [[Israel]] and [[New Zealand]])
* ethnic groups (as used in [[Māori people|Māori]] constituencies in the New Zealand legislature)
* any other affinity group.

===Nomenclature===
Sociologist [[Philip Selznick]], in the context of the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (TVA), described this form as "formal co-optation" (he used the term "cooptation").&lt;ref name=selznick&gt; {{cite book |last1=Selznick |first1=Philip |authorlink = Philip Selznick|title= TVA and the Grass Roots: a Study in the Sociology of Formal Organization|url=https://archive.org/details/tvandgrassrootss00selzrich |year= 1949|publisher= University of California Press |location= Berkeley |oclc=2293803}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Second sense==
This is arguably a derivation from the first sense.  The outcome of such co-option will be specific to the individual case, and will depend on the relative strength of the co-opting and co-opted groups, the degree of alignment of their interests, and the vigour with which their members are prepared to pursue those interests. For example, when corporations [[greenwash]] their brands by co-opting the tone of [[environmentalism]] without any deep reform of their [[environmental impact]], both environmental advocates and the general public must decide how to engage (or not) with the greenwashed result (accept it wholly, boycott it, apply pressure from another angle, ignore it, or some other path).

Selznick, again in the context of the Tennessee Valley Authority, &lt;ref name="selznick"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; described this form as "informal co-optation", although the process he describes is almost indistinguishable from the [[corruption (political)|corrupt]] sale of political influence.

'''E. Moidu Moulavi'''(1886–1995) was a [[freedom fighter]] of [[Malabar District|Malabar]], born at [[Maranchery]] in [[Ponnani]].

==Early years==

E Moidu Moulavi was born in 1886 to the family of Malayankulathel Marakkar Musliyar Maranchery, a scholar and freedom activist from Ponnani. He did his primary schooling at the Kodenchery Dars religious seminary before moving to [[Vazhakkad]]. After completing his studies at the [[Vazhakkad]] Darul Uloom Arabic college under the tutelage of Chalilakath Kunhahammad Haji, he joined the [[Indian National Movement]] from 1919 onwards. As a skilled orator and organizer, he was instrumental in drawing [[Mohammed Abdul Rahiman]] into the Indian Independence movement. He was the founding secretary of the ''Majlisul Ulema'', an organization formed for social reform amongst the [[Mappila]] community and to draw their participation in the Indian National Movement. Moulavi was arrested and underwent rigorous imprisonment during the [[Khilafat Movement]] of 1921. He had to undergo imprisonment for another 9 months in 1930 for his participation in the Payyannur Salt Sathyagraha struggle. Yet again he was given jail terms for a period of 3 years for taking part in the [[Quit India Movement]]. He was released in 1947 after the Congress party came to power in India.&lt;ref name="malappuram.entegramam.gov.in"&gt;[http://malappuram.entegramam.gov.in/content/%E0%B4%87%E0%B4%AE%E0%B5%8A%E0%B4%AF%E0%B5%8D%E0%B4%A4%E0%B5%81-%E0%B4%AE%E0%B5%97%E0%B4%B2%E0%B4%B5%E0%B4%BF Malappuram district Official portal - Famous personalities - E Moidu Moulavi (Malayalam) ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Whoswho"&gt;Pg 361, Who is who of freedom fighters in Kerala - K. Karunakaran Nair, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

Moidu Moulavi served as [[K.P.C.C]] working Committee Member, [[All India Congress Committee|AICC]] member etc. He was elected to the Malabar District Board from [[Andathode]] [[farqa]] in 1938. He was also member of the [[Kozhikode]] Municipality. In Independent India, he was nominated for [[Parliament of India|Parliament membership]] but declined the offer to resign from politics and concentrate on education and social reform within his community.

E Moidu Moulavi, along with [[Mohammed Abdul Rahiman]] launched the ''Al-Ameen'' newspaper from Calicut during 1929–1939. It was later closed down by the British authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Pg 474, The Indian economic and social history review, Volume 26, Delhi School of Economics, Vikas Pub. House, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
He was specially honoured in the Indian Freedom Fighters' conference organised in 1985 January in [[Allahabad]] and he was the man who hoisted the flag in the opening ceremony. He was a highly knowledgeable person and he had deep knowledge in six languages. He was also the author of several books including an Autobiography.&lt;ref name="Whoswho"/&gt;
Moidu Moulavi continued the nationalist traditions of [[Mohammed Abdul Rahiman]] through a long and distinguished career. His participation in the freedom movement was an inspiration to many later Congress Party leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Mappila Muslims of Kerala: a study in Islamic trends,Roland E. Miller - 1992 - 389&lt;/ref&gt; There hardly was another popular leader in the whole of Kerala except [[K. Kumar|K. Kumarji of Travancore]] who constantly wore the 'Gandhi Cap' openly proclaiming deep commitment to the nationalist sentiments.&lt;ref&gt;Kumarji in My View : article by N.G. Chacko Ex MLA - K. Kumarj Souvenir - 1974 (page 49)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
His autobiography was published in 1981 as ''Maulaviyude Athmakatha''.&lt;ref&gt;No 117, www.keralahistory.ac.in/ListofBiographiesinKCHRarchives.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote a biography of his close associate [[Mohammed Abdul Rahiman]] titled ''Ente Kuttukaran'' (My friend).&lt;ref name="brill"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ChEVAAAAIAAJ Pg 465, Roland Miller, The Encyclopaedia of Islam, Vol VI , Brill 1988]&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in 1995, aged 109. A memorial was constructed in his memory at [[Kozhikode]].&lt;ref name="malappuram.entegramam.gov.in"/&gt; M Rasheed, journalist and author is his son.&lt;ref&gt;Pg 85, Muhammad Abdurahman, NP Chekkutty, National Book Trust, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[sailing]], an '''earing''' is a small line ([[rope]]) used to fasten the corner of a sail to a spar or yard.

In the [[Age of Sail]], a position at the Weather Earing (the earing at the windward side of the ship) was considered a place of honor for the topmen, and on a merchant ship was the position of the second mate during [[reefing]].

An '''eco-municipality''' or '''eco-town''' is a [[local government]] area that has adopted [[ecological]] and [[social justice]] values in its [[charter]]. The development of eco-municipalities stems from changing systems in [[Sweden]], where more than seventy municipal governments have accepted varying principles of [[sustainability]] in their operations as well as community-wide decision making processes.&lt;ref&gt;Miranda Spencer (September 22, 2005) [http://sustainablebusiness.com/features/feature_template.cfm?ID=1269 Building Sustainable Cities: Scandinavia's "Eco-Municipalities" Show the Way].sustainablebusiness.com. Retrieved on: November 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of these policies is to increase the overall sustainability of the community.

The distinction between an eco-municipality and other [[sustainable development]] projects (such as [[green building]] and [[alternative energy]]) is the focus on community involvement and social transformation in a public agency as well as the use of a [[holistic]] [[systems thinking|systems]] approach. An eco-municipality is one that recognizes that issues of sustainability are key to all decisions made by government. &lt;ref&gt;Torbjorn Lahti and Sarah James (May 17, 2005) [http://www.wisconsinplanners.org/Ecomunicipalities/EcoMunicipalitySynopsis.pdf The Eco-municipality Model for Sustainable Community Change: A systems approach to creating sustainable communities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807163009/http://www.wisconsinplanners.org/Ecomunicipalities/EcoMunicipalitySynopsis.pdf |date=2008-08-07 }}.

==History==
In 1983 the [[Övertorneå]] community of Sweden first adopted an Eco-municipality framework followed by a formal organization in 1995 (SEKOM).

==Framework==
In becoming an eco-municipality, cities or towns typically adopt a resolution, based on the [[Natural Step|Natural Step framework]] (or Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development ([[FSSD]])), which sets the following objectives:
* Reduce dependence upon fossil fuels.
* Reduce dependence upon synthetic chemicals.
* Reduce encroachment upon nature.
* Better meet human needs fairly and efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;Alliance for Sustainability [http://www.afs.nonprofitoffice.com/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&amp;SEC=%7B2E02B44E-ED9D-4C45-B7C7-A670267AE29A%7D&amp;DE=%7B037A8207-109E-46C0-B083-E96FD3882316%7D Ashland, WI and Duluth, MN become Sustainable Cities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903103742/http://www.afs.nonprofitoffice.com/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&amp;SEC=%7B2E02B44E-ED9D-4C45-B7C7-A670267AE29A%7D&amp;DE=%7B037A8207-109E-46C0-B083-E96FD3882316%7D |date=2011-09-03 }}. Retrieved on: February 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Municipalities adopting framework==
Communities in [[North America]], [[Europe]] and Africa ranging in size from villages of 300 to cities of 700,000 have become eco-municipalities. In Sweden, over one hundred municipalities have officially become eco-municipalities. They have formed a [http://www.sekom.se national association of eco-municipalities] to assist one another and work to influence national policy. [[Whistler, BC]], was awarded first place in a [[United Nations]]-endorsed international competition for sustainable communities. Its long-term sustainability plan, Whistler 2020, is based on the Natural Step framework.&lt;ref&gt;Sustain Dane [http://www.sustaindane.org/Pages/ecomunicipality_where.htm Eco-municipalities: Where Are They?]. Retrieved on: February 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Wisconsin]], there is a growing eco-municipality movement which began in the Chequamegon Bay region. As of November 2007, twelve local communities had formally adopted eco-municipality resolutions. The resolutions state the community's intention to become an eco-municipality, endorsing the Natural Step sustainability principles and framework as a guide.&lt;ref&gt;1,000 Friends of Wisconsin.

{{English phonology topics}}
Like many other languages, [[English language|English]] has wide variation in [[pronunciation]], both [[History of the English language|historically]] and from [[List of dialects of the English language|dialect to dialect]]. In general, however, the regional dialects of English share a largely similar (but not identical) [[phonology|phonological]] system. Among other things, most dialects have [[vowel reduction]] in [[unstressed]] [[syllable]]s and a complex set of [[phonological feature]]s that distinguish [[fortis and lenis]] [[consonant]]s ([[stop consonant|stops]], [[affricate]]s, and [[fricative]]s). Most dialects of English preserve the consonant {{IPA|/w/}} (spelled {{angbr|w}}) and many preserve {{IPA|/θ, ð/}} (spelled {{angbr|th}}), while most other Germanic languages have shifted them to {{IPA|/v/}} and {{IPA|/t, d/}}: compare English ''will'' {{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-will.ogg|w|ɪ|l}} and ''then'' {{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-then.ogg|ð|ɛ|n}} with German {{wikt-lang|de|will}} {{IPA-de|vɪl||De-will.ogg}} ('want') and {{wikt-lang|de|denn}} {{IPA-de|dɛn||De-denn.ogg}} ('because').

Phonological analysis of English often concentrates on or uses, as a reference point, one or more of the [[prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]] or [[standard language|standard]] accents, such as [[Received Pronunciation]] for [[England]], [[General American]] for the [[United States]], and [[Australian English|General Australian]] for [[Australia]]. Nevertheless, many other dialects of English are spoken, which have developed independently from these standardized accents, particularly regional dialects. Information about these standardized accents functions only as a ''limited'' guide to all of '''English phonology''', which one can later expand upon once one becomes more familiar with some of the many other dialects of English that are spoken.

==Phonemes==
A [[phoneme]] of a language or dialect is an [[abstraction]] of a [[speech sound]] or of a group of different sounds which are all perceived to have the same function by speakers of that particular language or dialect. For example, the English word ''through'' consists of three phonemes: the initial "th" sound, the "r" sound, and a vowel sound. The phonemes in this and many other English words do not always correspond directly to the letters used to spell them (English [[orthography]] is not as strongly [[phonemic orthography|phonemic]] as that of many other languages).

The number and distribution of phonemes in English vary from dialect to dialect, and also depend on the interpretation of the individual researcher. The number of consonant phonemes is generally put at 24 (or slightly more). The number of vowels is subject to greater variation; in the system presented on this page there are 20 vowel phonemes in [[Received Pronunciation]], 14–16 in [[General American]] and 20–21 in Australian English {{citation needed|date=November 2018}}. The pronunciation keys used in dictionaries generally contain a slightly greater number of symbols than this, to take account of certain sounds used in foreign words and certain noticeable distinctions that may not be—strictly speaking—phonemic.

=== Consonants ===
The following table shows the 24 consonant phonemes found in most dialects of English, in addition to {{IPA|/x/}}, whose distribution is more limited. [[Fortis and lenis|Fortis]] consonants are always [[voicelessness|voiceless]], [[Aspirated consonant|aspirated]] in [[syllable onset]] (except in clusters beginning with {{IPA|/s/}}), and sometimes also [[Glottalization|glottalized]] to an extent in [[syllable coda]] (most likely to occur with {{IPA|/t/}}, see [[T-glottalization]]), while lenis consonants are always [[unaspirated consonant|unaspirated]] and un-glottalized, and generally partially or fully [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]]. The alveolars are usually [[Apical consonant|apical]], i.e. pronounced with the tip of the tongue touching or approaching the roof of the mouth, though some speakers produce them [[Laminal consonant|laminally]], i.e. with the blade of the tongue.{{sfnp|Rogers|2014|p=20}}

# Most varieties of English have [[syllabic consonant]]s in some words, principally {{IPA|[l̩, m̩, n̩]}}, for example at the end of ''bottle'', ''rhythm'' and ''button''. In such cases, no phonetic vowel is pronounced between the last two consonants, and the last consonant forms a [[syllable]] on its own. Syllabic consonants are generally transcribed with a vertical line under the consonant letter, so that phonetic transcription of ''bottle'' would be {{IPA|[ˈbɒtl̩]}}, {{IPA|[ˈbɑɾl̩]}}, or {{IPA|[ˈbɔɾl̩]}} in {{abbr|RP|Received Pronunciation}}, {{abbr|GA|General American}}, and Australian respectively, and for ''button'' {{IPA|[ˈbʌʔn̩]}}. In theory, such consonants could be analyzed as individual phonemes. However, this would add several extra consonant phonemes to the inventory for English,{{sfnp|Roach|2009|pp=100–1}} and phonologists prefer to identify syllabic nasals and [[liquid consonant|liquids]] phonemically as {{IPA|/ə[[consonant|C]]/}}.{{sfnp|Kreidler|2004|p=84}}{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=55}} Thus ''button'' is phonemically {{IPA|/ˈbʌtən/}} or {{IPA|/ˈbɐtən/}} and ''bottle'' is phonemically {{IPA|/ˈbɒtəl/}}, {{IPA|/ˈbɑtəl/}}, or {{IPA|/ˈbɔtəl/}}.
# The [[voiceless velar fricative]] {{IPA|/x/}} is mainly used in [[Hiberno-English|Hiberno-]], [[Scottish English|Scottish]], [[South African English|South African]] and [[Welsh English]]; words with {{IPA|/x/}} in Scottish accents tend to be pronounced with {{IPA|/k/}} in other dialects. The velar fricative sometimes appears in recent [[loanword]]s such as ''chutzpah''. Under the influence of [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Afrikaans]], the actual phonetic realization of {{IPA|/x/}} in Welsh English and White South African English is uvular {{IPAblink|χ}}, rather than velar {{IPAblink|x}}.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|pp=389, 619}}{{sfnp|Tench|1990|p=132}}{{sfnp|Bowerman|2004|p=939}} Dialects do not necessarily agree on the exact words in which {{IPA|/x/}} appears; for instance, in Welsh English it appears in loanwords from Welsh (such as ''[[Amlwch]]'' {{IPA|/ˈæmlʊx/}}), whereas in White South African English it appears only in loanwords from Afrikaans or [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] (such as ''gogga'' {{IPA|/ˈxɒxə/}} 'insect').{{sfnp|Wells|1982|pp=389, 619}}{{sfnp|Bowerman|2004|p=939}}
# In some conservative accents in Scotland, Ireland, the southern United States, and New England, the digraph {{angbr|wh}} in words like ''which'' and ''whine'' represents a voiceless ''w'' sound {{IPA|[ʍ]}}, a [[voiceless labio-velar approximant|voiceless labiovelar fricative]]{{sfnp|Gimson|2008|p=230}}{{sfnp|McMahon|2002|p=31}}{{sfnp|Giegerich|1992|p=36}} or [[voiceless labio-velar approximant|approximant]],{{sfnp|Ladefoged|2006|p=68}} which contrasts with the voiced ''w'' of ''witch'' and ''wine''. In most dialects, this sound is lost, and is pronounced as a voiced ''w'' (the [[Wine–whine merger|''wine''–''whine'' merger]]). Phonemically this sound is analysed as a consonant cluster {{IPA|/hw/}}, rather than as a separate phoneme {{IPA|*/ʍ/}}. Thus ''which'' and ''whine'' are transcribed phonemically as {{IPA|/hwɪtʃ/}} and {{IPA|/hwaɪn/}}. This does not mean that such speakers actually pronounce {{IPA|[h]}} followed by {{IPA|[w]}}: the phonemic transcription {{IPA|/hw/}} is simply a convenient way of representing a single sound {{IPA|[ʍ]}} without analysing such dialects as having an extra phoneme.{{sfnp|Roach|2009|p=43}}
# Similarly, the sound at the beginning of ''huge'' in most accents{{verification needed|date=January 2017}} is a [[voiceless palatal fricative]] {{IPA|[ç]}}, but this is analysed phonemically as the consonant cluster {{IPA|/hj/}} so that ''huge'' is transcribed {{IPA|/hjuːdʒ/}}. As with {{IPA|/hw/}}, this does not mean that speakers pronounce {{IPA|[h]}} followed by {{IPA|[j]}}; the phonemic transcription {{IPA|/hj/}} is simply a convenient way of representing the single sound {{IPA|[ç]}}.{{sfnp|Roach|2009|p=43}} The [[yod-dropping]] found in [[Norfolk dialect]] means that the traditional Norfolk pronunciation of ''huge'' is {{IPA|[hʊudʒ]}} and not {{IPA|[çuːdʒ]}}.
# This phoneme is conventionally transcribed with the basic Latin letter {{angbr|r}} (the IPA symbol for the [[alveolar trill]]), even though its pronunciation is usually a [[postalveolar approximant]] {{IPA|[ɹ̠]}}. The trill does exist but it is rare, found only in [[Scottish English|Scottish]] dialects and sporadically in [[Received Pronunciation]] preceding a stressed vowel in highly emphatic speech or when placing special emphasis on a word. See [[Pronunciation of English /r/]].
# The [[postalveolar consonant]]s {{IPA|/tʃ, dʒ, ʃ, ʒ, r/}} are also often slightly [[Labialization|labialized]]: {{IPA|[tʃʷ dʒʷ ʃʷ ʒʷ ɹ̠ʷ]}}.

====Sonorants====
{{See also|Pronunciation of English /r/}}
* The pronunciation of {{IPA|/l/}} varies by dialect:
** Received Pronunciation has two main allophones of {{IPA|/l/}}: the clear or plain {{IPA|[l]}}, and the dark or [[velarization|velarized]] {{IPA|[ɫ]}}. The clear variant is used before vowels when they are in the same syllable, and the dark variant when the {{IPA|/l/}} precedes a consonant or is in syllable-final position before silence.
** In South Wales, Ireland, and the Caribbean, {{IPA|/l/}} is often always clear, and in North Wales, Scotland, Australia, and New Zealand it is always dark.
** In General American and Canada, {{IPA|/l/}} is generally dark, but to varying degrees: before stressed vowels it is neutral or only slightly velarized.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=490}} In southern U.S. accents it is noticeably clear between vowels, and in some other positions.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=550}}
** In urban accents of Southern England, as well as New Zealand and some parts of the United States, {{IPA|/l/}} can be pronounced as an approximant or [[semivowel]] ({{IPA|[w], [o], [ʊ]}}) at the end of a syllable ([[l-vocalization|''l''-vocalization]]).
* Depending on dialect, {{IPA|/r/}} has at least the following allophones in varieties of English around the world:
** [[postalveolar approximant]] {{IPA|[ɹ̠]}} (the most common realization of the {{IPA|/r/}} phoneme, occurring in most dialects, RP and General American included)
** [[retroflex approximant]] {{IPA|[ɻ]}} (occurs in most Irish dialects and some American dialects)
** [[labiodental approximant]] {{IPA|[ʋ]}} (occurs in south-east England and some London accents; known as [[R-labialization|''r''-labialization]])
** [[alveolar flap]] {{IPA|[ɾ]}} (occurs in most Scottish and some South African dialects, some conservative dialects in England and Ireland; not to be confused with [[flapping]] of {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}})
** [[alveolar trill]] {{IPA|[r]}} (occurs in some very conservative Scottish dialects)
** [[voiced uvular fricative]] {{IPA|[ʁ]}} (occurs in northern Northumbria,  largely disappeared; known as the [[Northumbrian burr]])
* In most dialects {{IPA|/r/}} is [[labialized]] {{IPA|[ɹ̠ʷ]}} in many positions, as in ''reed'' {{IPA|[ɹ̠ʷiːd]}} and ''tree'' {{IPA|[tɹ̠̊ʷiː]}}; in the latter case, the {{IPA|/t/}} may be slightly labialized as well.{{sfnp|Ladefoged|2001|p=55}}
* In some [[Rhoticity in English|rhotic accents]], such as General American, {{IPA|/r/}} when not followed by a vowel is realized as an [[r-colored vowel|r-coloring]] of the preceding vowel or its coda: ''nurse'' {{IPA|[ˈnɚs]}}, ''butter'' {{IPA|[ˈbʌtɚ]}}.
* The distinctions between the nasals are [[Phoneme#Neutralization|neutralized]] in some environments. For example, before a final {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}} or {{IPA|/k/}} there is nearly always only one nasal sound that can appear in each case: {{IPA|[m]}}, {{IPA|[n]}} or {{IPA|[ŋ]}} respectively (as in the words ''limp'', ''lint'', ''link'' – note that the ''n'' of ''link'' is pronounced {{IPA|[ŋ]}}). This effect can even occur across syllable or word boundaries, particularly in stressed syllables: ''synchrony'' is pronounced {{IPA|[ˈsɪŋkɹəni]}} whereas ''synchronic'' may be pronounced either as {{IPA|[sɪŋˈkɹɒnɪk]}} or as {{IPA|[sɪnˈkɹɒnɪk]}}. For other possible syllable-final combinations, see {{slink||Coda}} in the Phonotactics section below.

====Obstruents====
In most dialects, the fortis stops and affricate {{IPA|/p, t, tʃ, k/}} have various different allophones, and are distinguished from the lenis stops and affricate {{IPA|/b, d, dʒ, ɡ/}} by several phonetic features.{{sfnp|Celce-Murcia|Brinton|Goodwin|1996|pp=62–67}}
* The allophones of the fortes {{IPA|/p, t, tʃ, k/}} include:
** [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] {{IPA|[pʰ, tʰ, kʰ]}} when they occur at the beginning of a word, as in '''''t'''omato'', '''''t'''rip'',&lt;!-- In trip, aspiration is realized as voicelessness of the r rather than the vowel. --&gt; or at the beginning of a [[lexical stress|stressed]] syllable in the middle of a word, as in ''po'''t'''ato''. They are unaspirated {{IPA|[p, t, k]}} after {{IPA|/s/}} within the same syllable, as in ''s'''t'''an, s'''p'''an, s'''c'''an'', and at the ends of syllables, as in ''mat'', ''map'', ''mac''.{{sfnp|Roach|2009|pp=26–28}} The voiceless fricatives are always unaspirated, but a notable exception to this are English-speaking areas of Wales, where they are often aspirated.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=388}}
** In many accents of English, fortis stops {{IPA|/p, t, k, tʃ/}} are [[Glottalization|glottalized]] in some positions. This may be heard either as a glottal stop preceding the oral closure ("pre-glottalization" or "glottal reinforcement") or as a substitution of the glottal stop {{IPA|[ʔ]}} for the oral stop (glottal replacement). {{IPA|/tʃ/}} can only be pre-glottalized. Pre-glottalization normally occurs in British and American English when the fortis consonant phoneme is followed by another consonant or when the consonant is in final position. Thus ''football'' and ''catching'' are often pronounced {{IPA|[ˈfʊʔtbɔːl]}} and {{IPA|[ˈkæʔtʃɪŋ]}}, respectively. Glottal replacement often happens in cases such as those just given, so that ''football'' is frequently pronounced {{IPA|[ˈfʊʔbɔːl]}}. In addition, however, glottal replacement is increasingly common in British English when {{IPA|/t/}} occurs between vowels if the preceding vowel is stressed; thus ''getting better'' is often pronounced by younger speakers as {{IPA|[ˈɡeʔɪŋ ˌbeʔə]}}.{{sfnp|Gimson|2008|pp=179–180}} Such [[t-glottalization|''t''-glottalization]] also occurs in many British regional accents, including [[Cockney English|Cockney]], where it can also occur at the end of words, and where {{IPA|/p/}} and {{IPA|/k/}} are sometimes treated the same way.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=323}}
* Among stops, both fortes and lenes:
** May have [[no audible release]] {{IPA|[p̚, b̚, t̚, d̚, k̚, ɡ̚]}} in the word-final position.{{sfnp|Celce-Murcia|Brinton|Goodwin|1996|p=64}}{{sfnp|Gimson|2014|pp=173–182}} These allophones are more common in North America than Great Britain.{{sfnp|Celce-Murcia|Brinton|Goodwin|1996|p=64}}
** Always have a 'masked release' before another plosive or affricate (as in ''ru'''bb'''ed'' {{IPA|[ˈrʌˑb̚d̥]}}), i.e. the release of the first stop is made after the closure of the second stop. This also applies when the following stop is [[Homorganic consonants|homorganic]] (articulated in the same place), as in ''to'''p p'''layer''.{{sfnp|Gimson|2014|pp=170 and 173–182}} A notable exception to this is [[Welsh English]], where stops are usually released in this environment.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=388}}
** The affricates {{IPA|/tʃ, dʒ/}} have a mandatory fricative release in all environments.{{sfnp|Gimson|2014|p=190}}
* Very often in the United States and Canada, and less frequently in Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Trudgill|Hannah|2002|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and New Zealand,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Trudgill|Hannah|2002|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; both {{IPA|/t/ and /d/}} can be [[flapping|pronounced as a voiced flap]] {{IPA|[ɾ]}} in certain positions: when they come between a preceding stressed vowel (possibly with intervening {{IPA|/r/}}) and precede an unstressed vowel or [[syllabic consonant|syllabic]] {{IPA|/l/}}. Examples include ''wa'''t'''er'', ''bo'''tt'''le'', ''pe'''t'''al'', ''pe'''dd'''le'' (the last two words sound alike when flapped). The flap may even appear at word boundaries, as in ''pu'''t''' it on''. When the combination {{IPA|/nt/}} appears in such positions, some American speakers pronounce it as a [[nasalization|nasalized]] flap that may become indistinguishable from {{IPA|/n/}}, so ''winter'' {{IPA|[ˈwɪɾ̃ɚ]}} may be pronounced similarly or identically to ''winner'' {{IPA|[ˈwɪnɚ]}}.&lt;ref&gt;Mojsin, Lisa (2009), ''Mastering the American Accent'',  Barron’s Education Series, Inc., p. 36.  "The t after n is often silent in American pronunciation.  Instead of saying internet Americans will frequently say 'innernet.'  This is fairly standard speech and is not considered overly casual or sloppy speech."&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Yod-coalescence]] is a process that [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalizes]] the [[Consonant cluster|clusters]] {{IPA|/dj/}}, {{IPA|/tj/}}, {{IPA|/sj/}} and {{IPA|/zj/}} into {{IPA|[dʒ]}}, {{IPA|[tʃ]}}, {{IPA|[ʃ]}} and {{IPA|[ʒ]}} respectively, frequently occurring with clusters that would be considered to span a syllable boundary.&lt;ref&gt;Wyld, H.C., A History of Modern Colloquial English, Blackwell 1936, cited in {{harvp|Wells|1982|p=262}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
**Yod-coalescence in stressed syllables, such as in ''tune'' and ''dune'', occurs in [[Australian English phonology|Australian]], [[Cockney#Cockney speech|Cockney]], [[Estuary English]], [[Hiberno-English]] (some speakers), [[Newfoundland English]], [[South African English]], and to a certain extent in [[New Zealand English]] and [[Scottish English]] (many speakers). This can lead to additional homophony; for instance, ''dew'' and ''due'' come to be pronounced the same as ''Jew''.&lt;ref name="Schneider"&gt;Bauer, L. &amp; Warren, P. [https://books.google.com/books?id=mtd3a-56ysUC&amp;pg=PA596 New Zealand English: phonology] in Schneider, E.W. "A handbook of varieties of English: Phonology, Volume 1", [[Walter de Gruyter|Mouton De Gruyter]], 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
**In certain varieties—such as [[Australian English]], South African English, and New Zealand English—{{IPA|/sj/}} and  {{IPA|/zj/}} in stressed syllables can coalesce into {{IPA|[ʃ]}} and {{IPA|[ʒ]}}, respectively. In Australian English for example, ''assume'' is pronounced {{IPA|[əˈ'''ʃʉ'''ːm]}} by some speakers.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=207}} Furthermore, some British, Canadian, American, New Zealand and Australian speakers may change the {{IPA|/s/}} sound to {{IPA|/ʃ/}} before {{IPA|/tr/}},&lt;ref&gt;Durian, David (2007) "Getting [ʃ]tronger Every Day?: More on Urbanization and the Socio-geographic Diffusion of (str) in Columbus, OH," University of Pennsylvania Working Papers in Linguistics: Vol. 13: Iss. 2, Article 6&lt;/ref&gt; so that a word having a cluster of "str" like in '''''st'''rewed'' would be pronounced {{IPA|[ʃtʃruːd]}}.&lt;ref name="Hay2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jennifer Hay|title=New Zealand English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=--eqBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA37|date=6 March 2008|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-3088-2|pages=37–}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to author Wayne P. Lawrence, "this [[Phonological change|phonemic change]] seems to be neither dialectal nor regional."&lt;ref&gt; Lawrence, Wayne P. (2000) "Assimilation at a Distance," American Speech Vol. 75: Iss. 1: 82-87; doi:10.1215/00031283-75-1-82&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vowels===
English has a particularly large number of vowel phonemes, and on top of that the [[vowel]]s of English differ considerably between dialects. Because of this, corresponding vowels may be transcribed with various symbols depending on the dialect under consideration. When considering English as a whole, [[lexical set]]s are often used, each named by a word containing the vowel or vowels in question. For example, the {{sc2|LOT}} set consists of words which, like ''lot'', have {{IPA|/ɒ/}} in [[Received Pronunciation]] and {{IPA|/ɑ/}} in [[General American]]. The "{{sc2|LOT}} vowel" then refers to the vowel that appears in those words in whichever dialect is being considered, or (at a greater level of [[abstraction]]) to a [[diaphoneme]], which represents this interdialectal correspondence. A commonly used system of lexical sets, devised by [[John C. Wells]], is presented below; for each set, the corresponding phonemes are given for RP and General American, using the notation that will be used on this page.

For a table that shows the pronunciations of these vowels in a wider range of English dialects, see [[IPA chart for English dialects]].

The following tables show the vowel phonemes of three standard varieties of English. The notation system used here for Received Pronunciation (RP) is fairly standard; the others less so. The feature descriptions given here (front, close, etc.) are abstracted somewhat; the actual pronunciations of these vowels are somewhat more accurately conveyed by the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] symbols used (see [[Vowel]] for a chart indicating the meanings of these symbols; though note also the points listed below the following tables).

# Although the notation {{IPA|/ʌ/}} is used for the vowel of {{sc2|STRUT}} in RP, the actual pronunciation is closer to a [[near-open central unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|[ɐ]}}. The symbol {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ʌ}}}} continues to be used for reasons of tradition (it was historically a back vowel) and because it is still back in other varieties.{{sfnp|Roca|Johnson|1999|p=135}}
# General American lacks a truly contrastive {{sc2|NURSE}} vowel, so pairs like ''forward'' vs. ''foreword'' (distinguished in RP as {{IPA|/ˈfɔːwəd/}} and {{IPA|/ˈfɔːwɜːd/}}, respectively) are most typically homophonous as {{IPA|[ˈfɔɹwɚd]}}. Also, {{IPA|[ʌ]}} (stressed) and {{IPA|[ə]}} (unstressed) may be considered allophones of a single phoneme in General American.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|pp=121, 132}}
# Although the notation {{IPA|/eɪ oʊ/}} are used for the vowels of {{sc2|FACE}} and {{sc2|GOAT}} respectively in General American, they are analysed as phonemic monophthongs and frequently transcribed as {{IPA|/e o/}} in the literature.
# Many North American speakers do not distinguish {{IPA|/ɔ/}} from {{IPA|/ɑ/}} and merge them into {{IPA|/ɑ/}}, except before {{IPA|/r/}} (see [[Cot–caught merger|''cot–caught'' merger]]).

The differences between these tables can be explained as follows:
* General American lacks a phoneme corresponding to RP {{IPA|/ɒ/}} ({{sc2|LOT}}, {{sc2|CLOTH}}), instead using {{IPA|/ɑ/}} in the {{sc2|LOT}} words and generally {{IPA|/ɔ/}} in the {{sc2|CLOTH}} words. In a few North American accents, namely in [[Eastern New England English|Eastern New England]] ([[Boston]]), [[Western Pennsylvania English|Western Pennsylvania]] ([[Pittsburgh]]), and to some degree in [[Pacific Northwest English|Pacific Northwest]] ([[Seattle]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]]) and Eastern [[Canadian English]], {{sc2|LOT}} words do not have the vowel of {{sc2|PALM}} (the [[father–bother merger|''father''–''bother'' merger]] has not occurred) but instead merge with {{sc2|CLOTH/THOUGHT}}.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|pp=473–474}}&lt;ref name="Atlas2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Labov|first1=William|last2=Ash|first2=Sharon|last3=Boberg|first3=Charles|title=The Atlas of North American English: Phonetics, Phonology and Sound Change|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tsPvynQtlMoC&amp;pg=PA171|year=2006|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-020683-8|pages=13, 171–173}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Woods1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Woods|first=Howard B.|editor-last=Clarke|editor-first=Sandra|title=Focus on Canada|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zkV4e1b8q_oC&amp;pg=PA170|year=1993|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|isbn=90-272-7681-1|pages=170–171|chapter=A synchronic study of English spoken in Ottawa: Is Canadian becoming more American?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kiefte|first1=Michael|last2=Kay-Raining Bird|first2=Elizabeth|title=The Lesser-Known Varieties of English: An Introduction|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-TGSgT2SyH0C&amp;pg=PA63|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-48741-2|pages=63–64, 67|chapter=Canadian Maritime English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* RP transcriptions use {{IPA|/e/}} rather than {{IPA|/ɛ/}} largely for convenience and historical tradition; it does not necessarily represent a different sound from the General American phoneme, although the RP vowel may be described as somewhat less open than the American one.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=128}}
* The different notations used for the vowel of {{sc2|GOAT}} in RP and General American ({{IPA|/əʊ/}} and {{IPA|/oʊ/}}) reflect a difference in the most common phonetic realizations of that vowel.
* The triphthongs given in the RP table are usually regarded as sequences of two phonemes (a diphthong plus {{IPA|/ə/}}); however, in RP, these sequences frequently undergo [[smoothing (phonetics)|smoothing]] into single diphthongs or even monophthongs.
* The different notations used here for some of the Australian vowels reflect the phonetic realization of those vowels in Australian: a central {{IPA|[ʉː]}} rather than {{IPA|[uː]}} in {{sc2|GOOSE}}, a more closed {{IPA|[e]}} rather than {{IPA|[ɛ]}} in {{sc2|DRESS}}, an open-mid {{IPA|[ɔ]}} rather than traditional RP's {{IPA|[ɒ]}} in {{sc2|LOT}} and {{sc2|CLOTH}}, a close-mid {{IPA|[oː]}} rather than mid {{IPA|[ɔː]}} in {{sc2|THOUGHT}}, {{sc2|NORTH}} and {{sc2|FORCE}} (here the difference lies almost only in transcription rather than pronunciation), an opener {{IPA|[ɐ]}} rather than somewhat closer {{IPA|[ʌ]}} in {{sc2|STRUT}}, a fronted {{IPA|[ɐː]}} rather than {{IPA|[ɑː]}} in {{sc2|CALM}} and {{sc2|START}}, and somewhat different pronunciations of most of the diphthongs. Note that central {{IPA|[ʉː]}} in {{sc2|GOOSE}} and open-mid {{IPA|[ɔ]}} in {{sc2|LOT}} are possible realizations in modern RP; in the case of the latter vowel, it is even more common than the traditional open {{IPA|[ɒ]}}.{{sfnp|Gimson|2014|pp=126 and 133}}
* The Australian monophthong {{IPA|/eː/}} corresponds to the RP diphthong {{IPA|/eə/}} ({{sc2|SQUARE}}).
* Australian has the [[bad–lad split|''bad''–''lad'' split]], with distinctive short and long variants in various words of the {{sc2|TRAP}} set: a long phoneme {{IPA|/æː/}} in words like ''bad'' contrasts with a short {{IPA|/æ/}} in words like ''lad''. (A similar split is found in the accents of some speakers in southern England.)
* The vowel {{IPA|/ʊə/}} is often omitted from descriptions of Australian, as for most speakers it has split into the long monophthong {{IPA|/oː/}} (e.g. ''poor'', ''sure'') or the sequence {{IPA|/ʉːə/}} (e.g. ''cure'', ''lure'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first1=Felicity|last1=Cox|first2=Sallyanne|last2=Palethorpe|title=Illustrations of the IPA: Australian English|journal=Journal of the International Phonetic Association|year=2007|volume=37|number=3|pages=341–350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other points to be noted are these:
* The vowel {{IPA|/æ/}} is coming to be pronounced more open (approaching {{IPA|[a]}}) by many modern RP speakers. In American speech, however, there is a tendency for it to become more closed, tenser and even diphthongized (to something like {{IPA|[eə]}}), particularly in certain environments, such as before a [[nasal consonant]].{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=129}} Some American accents, for example those of [[New York City]], [[Philadelphia]] and [[Baltimore]], make a marginal phonemic distinction between {{IPA|/æ/}} and {{IPA|/eə/}}, although the two occur largely in mutually exclusive environments. See [[:/æ/ raising]].
* A significant number of words (the {{sc2|BATH}} group) have {{IPA|/æ/}} in General American, but {{IPA|/ɑː/}} in RP (and mostly {{IPA|/ɐː/}} in Australian).
* In General American and Canadian (which are [[Rhotic and non-rhotic accents|rhotic accents]], where {{IPA|/r/}} is pronounced in positions where it does not precede a vowel), many of the vowels can be [[R-colored vowel|r-colored]] by way of realization of a following {{IPA|/r/}}. This is often transcribed phonetically using a vowel symbol with an added retroflexion [[diacritic]] {{IPA |[ ˞ ]}}; thus the symbol {{IPA|[ɚ]}} has been created for an r-colored [[schwa]] (sometimes called schwar) as in {{sc2|LETT'''ER'''}}, and the vowel of {{sc2|START}} can be modified to make {{IPA|[ɑ˞]}} so that the word ''start'' may be transcribed {{IPA|[stɑ˞t]}}. Alternatively, the {{sc2|START}} vowel might be written {{IPA|[stɑɚt]}} to indicate an r-colored offglide. The vowel of {{sc2|NURSE}} is generally always r-colored in these dialects, and this can be written {{IPA|[ɚ]}} (or as a syllabic {{IPA|[ɹ̩]}}).
* In modern RP and other dialects, many words from the {{sc2|CURE}} group are coming to be pronounced by an increasing number of speakers with the {{sc2|NORTH}} vowel (so ''sure'' is often pronounced like ''shore''). Also the RP vowels {{IPA|/ɛə/}} and {{IPA|/ʊə/}} may be monophthongized to {{IPA|[ɛː]}} and {{IPA|[oː]}} respectively.{{sfnp|Roach|2004|p=240}}
* The vowels of {{sc2|FLEECE}} and {{sc2|GOOSE}} are commonly pronounced as narrow diphthongs, approaching {{IPA|[ɪi]}} and {{IPA|[ʊu]}}, in RP. Near-RP speakers may have particularly marked diphthongization of the type {{IPA|[əi]}} and {{IPA|[əu ~ əʉ]}}, respectively.  In General American, the pronunciation varies between a monophthong and a diphthong.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|pp=140, 147, 299}}

====Allophones of vowels====
Listed here are some of the significant cases of [[allophony]] of vowels found within standard English dialects.
*Vowels are shortened when followed in a syllable by a voiceless ([[fortis consonant|fortis]]) consonant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Collins|first1=Beverley|last2=Mees|first2=Inger|title=Practical Phonetics and Phonology|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415506496|page=58|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is known as [[Clipping (phonetics)|''pre-fortis clipping'']]. Thus in the following word pairs the first item has a shortened vowel while the second has a normal length vowel: 'right' {{IPA|/raɪt/}} - 'ride' {{IPA|/raɪd/}}; 'face' {{IPA|/feɪs/}} - 'phase' {{IPA|/feɪz/}}; 'advice' {{IPA|/ədvaɪs/}} - 'advise' {{IPA|/ədvaɪz/}}.
* In many accents of English, [[tenseness|tense]] vowels undergo [[vowel breaking|breaking]] before {{IPA|/l/}}, resulting in pronunciations like {{IPA|[pʰiəɫ]}} for ''peel'', {{IPA|[pʰuəɫ]}} for ''pool'', {{IPA|[pʰeəɫ]}} for ''pail'', and {{IPA|[pʰoəɫ]}} for ''pole''.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}
* In RP, the vowel {{IPA|/əʊ/}} may be pronounced more back, as {{IPA|[ɒʊ]}}, before syllable-final {{IPA|/l/}}, as in ''goal''. In Australian English the vowel {{IPA|/əʉ/}} is similarly backed to {{IPA|[ɔʊ]}} before {{IPA|/l/}}. A similar phenomenon may occur in [[Southern American English]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}
* The vowel {{IPA|/ə/}} is often pronounced {{IPA|[ɐ]}} in open syllables.{{sfnp|Gimson|2008|p=132}}
* The {{sc2|PRICE}} and {{sc2|MOUTH}} diphthongs may be pronounced with a less open starting point when followed by a [[voiceless]] consonant;{{sfnp|Celce-Murcia|Brinton|Goodwin|1996|p=66}} this is chiefly a feature of Canadian speech ([[Canadian raising]]), but is also found in parts of the United States.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=149}} Thus ''writer'' may be distinguished from ''rider'' even when [[flapping]] causes the {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} to be pronounced identically.

====Unstressed syllables====
{{hatnote|For more information, see [[Stress and vowel reduction in English]].}}

[[Unstressed syllable]]s in English may contain almost any vowel, but in practice vowels in stressed and unstressed syllables tend to use different inventories of phonemes. In particular, long vowels are used less often in unstressed syllables than stressed syllables. Additionally there are certain sounds—characterized by [[central vowel|central]] position and weakness—that are particularly often found as the nuclei of unstressed syllables. These include:
* [[schwa]], {{IPA|[ə]}}, as in {{sc2|COMM'''A'''}} and (in non-rhotic dialects) {{sc2|LETT'''ER'''}} ([[Panda–pander merger|''panda''–''pander'' merger]]); also in many other positions such as '''''a'''bout'', ''phot'''o'''graph'', ''padd'''o'''ck'', etc. This sound is essentially restricted to unstressed syllables exclusively. In the approach presented here it is identified as a phoneme {{IPA|/ə/}}, although other analyses do not have a separate phoneme for schwa and regard it as a reduction or neutralization of other vowels in syllables with the lowest degree of stress.
* [[r-colored schwa]], {{IPA|[ɚ]}}, as in {{sc2|LETT'''ER'''}} in General American and some other rhotic dialects, which can be identified with the underlying sequence {{IPA|/ər/}}.
* [[syllabic consonant]]s: {{IPA|[l̩]}} as in ''bott'''le''''', {{IPA|[n̩]}} as in ''butt'''on''''', {{IPA|[m̩]}} as in ''rhyth'''m'''''. These may be phonemized either as a plain consonant or as a schwa followed by a consonant; for example ''button'' may be represented as {{IPA|/ˈbʌtn̩/}} or {{IPA|/ˈbʌtən/}} (see above under [[#Consonants|Consonants]]).
* {{IPA|[ɨ̞]}}, as in ''ros'''e'''s'' and ''mak'''i'''ng''. This can be identified with the phoneme {{IPA|/ɪ/}}, although in unstressed syllables it may be pronounced more centrally, and for some speakers (particularly in Australian and New Zealand and some American English) it is merged with {{IPA|/ə/}} in these syllables ([[weak vowel merger]]). Among speakers who retain the distinction there are many cases where [[free variation]] between {{IPA|/ɪ/}} and {{IPA|/ə/}} is found, as in the second syllable of ''typ'''i'''cal''. (The [[OED]] has recently adopted the symbol {{angbr|ᵻ}} to indicate such cases.)
* {{IPA|[ʉ̞]}}, as in ''arg'''u'''ment'', ''t'''o'''day'', for which similar considerations apply as in the case of {{IPA|[ɨ̞]}}. (The symbol {{angbr|ᵿ}} is sometimes used in these cases, similarly to {{angbr|ᵻ}}.) Some speakers may also have a rounded schwa, {{IPA|[ɵ]}}, used in words like ''omission'' {{IPA|[ɵˈmɪʃən]}}.{{sfnp|Bolinger|1986|pp=347-360}}
* {{IPA|[i]}}, as in ''happ'''y''''', ''coff'''ee''''', in many dialects (others have {{IPA|[ɪ]}} in this position).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lewis|first=J. Windsor|title=HappYland Reconnoitred|url=http://www.yek.me.uk/happyland.html|accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phonemic status of this {{IPA|[i]}} is not easy to establish. Some authors consider it to correspond phonemically with a close front vowel that is neither the vowel of {{sc2|KIT}} nor that of {{sc2|FLEECE}}; it occurs chiefly in contexts where the contrast between these vowels is neutralized,{{sfnp|Kreidler|2004|pp=82–3}}{{sfnp|McCully|2009|pp=123–4}}{{sfnp|Roach|2009|pp=66–8}} implying that it represents an [[archiphoneme]], which may be written {{IPA|/i/}}. Many speakers, however, do have a contrast in pairs of words like ''studied'' and ''studded'' or ''taxis'' and ''taxes''; the contrast may be {{IPA|[i]}} vs. {{IPA|[ɪ]}}, {{IPA|[ɪ]}} vs. {{IPA|[ə]}} or {{IPA|[i]}} vs. {{IPA|[ə]}}, hence some authors consider that the ''happY''-vowel should be identified phonemically either with the vowel of {{sc2|KIT}} or that of {{sc2|FLEECE}}, depending on speaker.{{sfnp|Wells|2014|p=53}} See also [[happy-tensing|''happy''-tensing]].
* {{IPA|[u]}}, as in ''infl'''u'''ence'', ''t'''o''' each''. This is the back rounded counterpart to {{IPA|[i]}} described above; its phonemic status is treated in the same works as cited there.

[[Vowel reduction]] in unstressed syllables is a significant feature of English. Syllables of the types listed above often correspond to a syllable containing a different vowel ("full vowel") used in other forms of the same [[morpheme]] where that syllable is stressed. For example, the first ''o'' in ''photograph'', being stressed, is pronounced with the {{sc2|GOAT}} vowel, but in ''photography'', where it is unstressed, it is reduced to schwa. Also, certain common words (''a'', ''an'', ''of'', ''for'', etc.) are pronounced with a schwa when they are unstressed, although they have different vowels when they are in a stressed position (see [[Weak and strong forms in English]]).

Some unstressed syllables, however, retain full (unreduced) vowels, i.e. vowels other than those listed above. Examples are the {{IPA|/æ/}} in '''''a'''mbition'' and the {{IPA|/aɪ/}} in ''fin'''i'''te''. Some phonologists regard such syllables as not being fully unstressed (they may describe them as having ''tertiary stress''); some dictionaries have marked such syllables as having [[secondary stress]]. However linguists such as Ladefoged&lt;ref&gt;Peter Ladefoged (1975 ''etc.'') ''A course in phonetics''&lt;/ref&gt; and {{Harvcoltxt|Bolinger|1986}} regard this as a difference purely of vowel quality and not of stress,{{sfnp|Bolinger|1986|p=351}} and thus argue that vowel reduction itself is phonemic in English. Examples of words where vowel reduction seems to be distinctive for some speakers{{sfnp|Bolinger|1986|p=348}} include ''chickar'''ee''''' vs. ''chicor'''y''''' (the latter has the reduced vowel of {{sc2|HAPP'''Y'''}}, whereas the former has the {{sc2|FLEECE}} vowel without reduction), and ''Phar'''aoh''''' vs. ''farr'''ow''''' (both have the {{sc2|GOAT}} vowel, but in the latter word it may reduce to {{IPA|[ɵ]}}).

==Lexical stress==
{{main|Stress and vowel reduction in English}}
[[Stress (linguistics)|Lexical stress]] is phonemic in English. For example, the noun '''''in'''crease'' and the verb ''in'''crease''''' are distinguished by the positioning of the stress on the first syllable in the former, and on the second syllable in the latter. (See [[initial-stress-derived noun]].) Stressed syllables in English are louder than non-stressed syllables, as well as being longer and having a higher pitch.

In traditional approaches, in any English word consisting of more than one [[syllable]], each syllable is ascribed one of three degrees of stress: ''primary'', ''secondary'' or ''unstressed''. Ordinarily, in each such word there will be exactly one syllable with primary stress, possibly one syllable having secondary stress, and the remainder are unstressed. For example, the word ''am'''az'''ing'' has primary stress on the second syllable, while the first and third syllables are unstressed, whereas the word '''''or'''ganiz'''a'''tion'' has primary stress on the fourth syllable, secondary stress on the first, and the second, third and fifth unstressed. This is often shown in pronunciation keys using the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] symbols for primary and secondary stress (which are ˈ and ˌ respectively), placed before the syllables to which they apply. The two words just given may therefore be represented (in [[Received Pronunciation|RP]]) as {{IPA|/əˈmeɪzɪŋ/}} and {{IPA|/ˌɔːɡənaɪˈzeɪʃən/}}.

Some analysts identify an additional level of stress (''tertiary'' stress). This is generally ascribed to syllables that are pronounced with less force than those with secondary stress, but nonetheless contain a "full" or "unreduced" vowel (vowels that are considered to be reduced are listed under {{slink|English phonology|Unstressed syllables}} above). Hence the third syllable of ''organization'', if pronounced with {{IPA|/aɪ/}} as shown above (rather than being reduced to {{IPA|/ɪ/}} or {{IPA|/ə/}}), might be said to have tertiary stress. (The precise identification of secondary and tertiary stress differs between analyses; dictionaries do not generally show tertiary stress, although some have taken the approach of marking all syllables with unreduced vowels as having at least secondary stress.)

In some analyses, then, the concept of lexical stress may become conflated with that of vowel reduction. An approach which attempts to separate these two is provided by [[Peter Ladefoged]], who states that it is possible to describe English with only one degree of stress, as long as [[unstressed vowel|unstressed syllables]] are phonemically distinguished for [[vowel reduction]].&lt;ref name=Lad&gt;Ladefoged (1975 ''etc.'') ''[[A course in phonetics]]'' §5.4; (1980) ''Preliminaries to linguistic phonetics'' p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; In this approach, the distinction between primary and secondary stress is regarded as a phonetic or prosodic detail rather than a phonemic feature – primary stress is seen as an example of the predictable "tonic" stress that falls on the ''final'' stressed syllable of a [[prosodic unit]]. For more details of this analysis, see [[Stress and vowel reduction in English]].

For stress as a prosodic feature (emphasis of particular words within utterances), see {{slink||Prosodic stress}} below.

==Phonotactics==
[[Phonotactics]] is the study of the sequences of phonemes that occur in languages and the sound structures that they form. In this study it is usual to represent consonants in general with the letter C and vowels with the letter V, so that a syllable such as 'be' is described as having CV structure. The [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] symbol used to show a division between syllables is the dot {{IPA|[.]}}. Syllabification is the process of dividing continuous speech into discrete syllables, a process in which the position of a syllable division is not always easy to decide upon.

Most languages of the world syllabify {{IPA|CVCV}} and {{IPA|CVCCV}} sequences as {{IPA|/CV.CV/}} and {{IPA|/CVC.CV/}} or {{IPA|/CV.CCV/}}, with consonants preferentially acting as the onset of a syllable containing the following vowel. According to one view, English is unusual in this regard, in that stressed syllables attract following consonants, so that {{IPA|ˈCVCV}} and {{IPA|ˈCVCCV}} syllabify as {{IPA|/ˈCVC.V/}} and {{IPA|/ˈCVCC.V/}}, as long as the consonant cluster {{IPA|CC}} is a possible syllable coda; in addition, {{IPA|/r/}} preferentially syllabifies with the preceding vowel even when both syllables are unstressed, so that {{IPA|CVrV}} occurs as {{IPA|/CVr.V/}}. This is the analysis used in the ''[[Longman Pronunciation Dictionary]]''.{{sfnp|Wells|1990|pp=76–86}} However, this view is not widely accepted, as explained in the following section.

===Syllable structure===
The [[syllable]] structure in English is (C)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;V(C)&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, with a near maximal example being ''strengths'' ({{IPA|/strɛŋkθs/}}, although it can be pronounced {{IPA|/strɛŋθs/}}).&lt;ref&gt;Five-consonant codas are rare, but one occurs in ''angsts'' {{IPA|/æŋksts/}}. See [[list of the longest English words with one syllable]] for further long syllables in English.&lt;/ref&gt; From the phonetic point of view, the analysis of syllable structures is a complex task: because of widespread occurrences of articulatory overlap, English speakers rarely produce an audible release of individual consonants in consonant clusters.{{sfnp|Zsiga|2003|p=404}} This coarticulation can lead to articulatory gestures that seem very much like deletions or complete assimilations. For example, ''hundred pounds'' may sound like {{IPA|[hʌndɹɪ'''b''' paʊndz]}} and ''jumped back'' (in slow speech, {{IPA|[dʒʌmptbæk]}}) may sound like {{IPA|[dʒʌmpbæk]}}, but X-ray{{sfnp|Browman|Goldstein|1990}} and electropalatographic {{sfnp|Barry|1991}}{{sfnp|Barry|1992}}{{sfnp|Nolan|1992}} studies demonstrate that inaudible and possibly weakened contacts or lingual gestures may still be made. Thus the second {{IPA|/d/}} in ''hundred pounds'' does not entirely assimilate to a labial place of articulation, rather the labial gesture co-occurs with the alveolar one; the "missing" {{IPA|[t]}} in ''jumped back'' may still be articulated, though not heard.

Division into syllables is a difficult area, and different theories have been proposed. A widely accepted approach is the maximal onset principle:{{sfnp|Selkirk|1982}} this states that, subject to certain constraints, any consonants in between vowels should be assigned to the following syllable. Thus the word ''leaving'' should be divided {{IPA|/ˈliː.vɪŋ/}} rather than *{{IPA|/ˈliːv.ɪŋ/}}, and ''hasty'' is {{IPA|/ˈheɪ.sti/}} rather than *{{IPA|/ˈheɪs.ti/}} or *{{IPA|/ˈheɪst.i/}}. However, when such a division results in an onset cluster which is not allowed in English, the division must respect this. Thus if the word ''extra'' were divided *{{IPA|/ˈe.kstrə/}} the resulting onset of the second syllable would be {{IPA|/kstr/}}, a cluster which does not occur initially in English. The division {{IPA|/ˈek.strə/}} is therefore preferred. If assigning a consonant or consonants to the following syllable would result in the preceding syllable ending in an unreduced short vowel, this is avoided. Thus the word ''comma'' (in RP) should be divided {{IPA|/ˈkɒm.ə/}} and not *{{IPA|/ˈkɒ.mə/}}, even though the latter division gives the maximal onset to the following syllable.

In some cases, no solution is completely satisfactory: for example, in British English (RP) the word ''hurry'' could be divided {{IPA|/ˈhʌ.ri/}} or {{IPA|/ˈhʌr.i/}}, but the former would result in an analysis with a syllable-final {{IPA|/ʌ/}} (which is held to be non-occurring) while the latter would result in a syllable final {{IPA|/r/}} (which is said not to occur in this accent). Some phonologists have suggested a compromise analysis where the consonant in the middle belongs to both syllables, and is described as [[Ambisyllabicity|ambisyllabic]].{{sfnp|Giegerich|1992|p=172}}{{sfnp|Harris|1994|p=198}} In this way, it is possible to suggest an analysis of ''hurry'' which comprises the syllables {{IPA|/hʌr/}} and {{IPA|/ri/}}, the medial {{IPA|/r/}} being ambisyllabic. 
Where the division coincides with a word boundary, or the boundary between elements of a compound word, it is not usual in the case of dictionaries to insist on the maximal onset principle in a way that divides words in a counter-intuitive way; thus the word ''hardware'' would be divided {{IPA|/ˈhɑː.dweə/}} by the M.O.P., but dictionaries prefer the division {{IPA|/ˈhɑːd.weə/}}.{{sfnp|Gimson|2008|pp=258–9}}{{sfnp|Giegerich|1992|pp=167–70}}{{sfnp|Kreidler|2004|pp=76–8}}

In the approach used by the ''[[Longman Pronunciation Dictionary]]'', Wells{{sfnp|Wells|1990|pp=76–86}} claims that consonants syllabify with the preceding rather than following vowel when the preceding vowel is the nucleus of a more salient syllable, with stressed syllables being the most salient, reduced syllables the least, and full unstressed vowels ("secondary stress") intermediate. But there are lexical differences as well, frequently but not exclusively with compound words. For example, in ''dolphin'' and ''selfish,'' Wells argues that the stressed syllable ends in {{IPA|/lf/}}, but in ''shellfish,'' the {{IPA|/f/}} belongs with the following syllable: {{IPA|/ˈdɒlf.ɪn, ˈself.ɪʃ/}} → {{IPA|[ˈdɒlfɪ̈n, ˈselfɪ̈ʃ]}}, but {{IPA|/ˈʃel.fɪʃ/}} → {{IPA|[ˈʃelˑfɪʃ]}}, where the {{IPA|/l/}} is a little longer and the {{IPA|/ɪ/}} is not reduced. Similarly, in ''toe-strap'' Wells argues that the second {{IPA|/t/}} is a full plosive, as usual in syllable onset, whereas in ''toast-rack'' the second {{IPA|/t/}} is in many dialects reduced to the unreleased allophone it takes in syllable codas, or even elided: {{IPA|/ˈtoʊ.stræp/, /ˈtoʊst.ræk/}} → {{IPA|[ˈtoˑʊstɹæp, ˈtoʊs(t̚)ɹæk]}}; likewise ''nitrate'' {{IPA|/ˈnaɪ.treɪt/}} → {{IPA|[ˈnaɪtɹ̥eɪt]}} with a voiceless {{IPA|/r/}} (and for some people an affricated ''tr'' as in ''tree''), vs ''night-rate'' {{IPA|/ˈnaɪt.reɪt/}} → {{IPA|[ˈnaɪt̚ɹeɪt]}} with a voiced {{IPA|/r/}}. Cues of syllable boundaries include aspiration of syllable onsets and (in the US) flapping of coda {{IPA|/t, d/}} ''(a tease'' {{IPA|/ə.ˈtiːz/}} → {{IPA|[əˈtʰiːz]}} vs. ''at ease'' {{IPA|/æt.ˈiːz/}} → {{IPA|[æɾˈiːz]}}), epenthetic stops like {{IPA|[t]}} in syllable codas (''fence'' {{IPA|/ˈfens/}} → {{IPA|[ˈfents]}} but ''inside'' {{IPA|/ɪn.ˈsaɪd/}} → {{IPA|[ɪnˈsaɪd]}}), and r-colored vowels when the {{IPA|/r/}} is in the coda vs. labialization when it is in the onset ''(key-ring'' {{IPA|/ˈkiː.rɪŋ/}} → {{IPA|[ˈkiːɹʷɪŋ]}} but ''fearing'' {{IPA|/ˈfiːr.ɪŋ/}} → {{IPA|[ˈfɪəɹɪŋ]}}).

# Some northern and insular Scottish dialects, particularly in the [[Shetlands]], preserve onsets such as {{IPA|/ɡn/}} (as in ''gnaw''), {{IPA|/kn/}} (as in ''knock''), and {{IPA|/wr/}} or {{IPA|/vr/}} (as in ''write'').&lt;ref&gt;See Blake et al., ''The Cambridge History of the English Language'', 1992, p.67; R. McColl Millar, ''Northern and Insular Scots'', Edinburgh University Press, 2007, pp.63-64.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Words beginning in unusual consonant clusters that originated in Latinized Greek loanwords tend to drop the first phoneme, as in *{{IPA|/bd/}}, *{{IPA|/fθ/}}, *{{IPA|/ɡn/}}, *{{IPA|/hr/}}, *{{IPA|/kn/}}, *{{IPA|/ks/}}, *{{IPA|/kt/}}, *{{IPA|/kθ/}}, *{{IPA|/mn/}}, *{{IPA|/pn/}}, *{{IPA|/ps/}}, *{{IPA|/pt/}}, *{{IPA|/tm/}}, and *{{IPA|/θm/}}, which have become {{IPA|/d/}} (''bdellium''), {{IPA|/θ/}} (''phthisis''), {{IPA|/n/}} (''gnome''), {{IPA|/r/}} (''rhythm''), {{IPA|/n/}} (''cnidoblast''), {{IPA|/z/}} (''xylophone''), {{IPA|/t/}} (''ctenophore''), {{IPA|/θ/}} (''chthonic''), {{IPA|/n/}} (''mnemonic''), {{IPA|/n/}} (''pneumonia''), {{IPA|/s/}} (''psychology''), {{IPA|/t/}} (''pterodactyl''), {{IPA|/m/}} (''tmesis''), and {{IPA|/m/}} (''asthma''). However, the onsets {{IPA|/sf/}}, {{IPA|/sfr/}}, {{IPA|/skl/}}, {{IPA|/sθ/}}, and {{IPA|/θl/}} have remained intact.
# The onset {{IPA|/hw/}} is simplified to {{IPA|/w/}} in the majority of dialects ([[wine–whine merger|''wine''–''whine'' merger]]).
# Clusters ending {{IPA|/j/}} typically occur before {{IPA|/uː/}} and before the &lt;small&gt;CURE&lt;/small&gt; vowel (General American {{IPA|/ʊr/}}, RP {{IPA|/ʊə/}}); they may also come before the reduced form {{IPA|/ʊ/}} (as in ''ar'''gu'''ment'') or even {{IPA|/ər/}} (in the American pronunciation of ''fi'''gu'''re''). There is an ongoing sound change ([[yod-dropping]]) by which {{IPA|/j/}} as the final consonant in a [[Consonant cluster|cluster]] is being lost. In RP, words with {{IPA|/sj/}} and {{IPA|/lj/}} can usually be pronounced with or without this sound, e.g. {{IPA|[suːt]}} or {{IPA|[sjuːt]}}. For some speakers of English, including some British speakers, the sound change is more advanced and so, for example, General American does not contain the onsets {{IPA|/tj/}}, {{IPA|/dj/}}, {{IPA|/nj/}}, {{IPA|/θj/}}, {{IPA|/sj/}}, {{IPA|/stj/}}, {{IPA|/zj/}}, or {{IPA|/lj/}}. Words that would otherwise begin in these onsets drop the {{IPA|/j/}}: e.g. ''tube'' ({{IPA|/tub/}}), ''during'' ({{IPA|/ˈdʊrɪŋ/}}), ''new'' ({{IPA|/nu/}}), ''Thule'' ({{IPA|/ˈθuli/}}), ''suit'' ({{IPA|/sut/}}), ''student'' ({{IPA|/ˈstudənt/}}), ''Zeus'' ({{IPA|/zus/}}), ''lurid'' ({{IPA|/ˈlʊrɪd/}}). In some dialects, such [[Welsh English]], {{IPA|/j/}} may occur in more combinations; for example in {{IPA|/tʃj/}} (''chew''), {{IPA|/dʒj/}} (''Jew''), {{IPA|/ʃj/}} (''sure''), and {{IPA|/slj/}} (''slew'').
# Many clusters beginning with {{IPA|/ʃ/}} and paralleling native clusters beginning with {{IPA|/s/}} are found initially in German and Yiddish loanwords, such as {{IPA|/ʃl/}}, {{IPA|/ʃp/}}, {{IPA|/ʃt/}}, {{IPA|/ʃm/}}, {{IPA|/ʃn/}}, {{IPA|/ʃpr/}},  {{IPA|/ʃtr/}} (in words such as ''[[schlep]], spiel, shtick, schmuck, [[schnapps]], Shprintzen's, strudel''). {{IPA|/ʃw/}} is found initially in the Hebrew loanword [[schwa]]. Before {{IPA|/r/}} however, the native cluster is {{IPA|/ʃr/}}. The opposite cluster {{IPA|/sr/}} is found in loanwords such as ''Sri Lanka'', but this can be nativized by changing it to {{IPA|/ʃr/}}.

;Other onsets
Certain English onsets appear only in contractions: e.g. {{IPA|/zbl/}} (''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;sblood''), and {{IPA|/zw/}} or {{IPA|/dzw/}} (''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;swounds'' or ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;dswounds''). Some, such as {{IPA|/pʃ/}} (''pshaw''), {{IPA|/fw/}} (''fwoosh''), or {{IPA|/vr/}} (''vroom''), can occur in [[interjection]]s. An archaic voiceless fricative plus nasal exists, {{IPA|/fn/}} (''fnese''), as does an archaic {{IPA|/snj/}} (''snew'').

Several additional onsets occur in [[loan word]]s (with varying degrees of anglicization) such as {{IPA|/bw/}} (''bwana''), {{IPA|/mw/}} (''moiré''), {{IPA|/nw/}} (''noire''), {{IPA|/tsw/}} (''zwitterion''), {{IPA|/zw/}} (''zwieback''), {{IPA|/dv/}} (''Dvorak''), {{IPA|/kv/}} (''kvetch''),  {{IPA|/ʃv/}} (''schvartze''), {{IPA|/tv/}} (''Tver''), {{IPA|/tsv/}} (''Zwickau''), {{IPA|/kdʒ/}} (''Kjell''), {{IPA|/kʃ/}} (''Kshatriya''), {{IPA|/tl/}} (''Tlaloc''), {{IPA|/vl/}} (''Vladimir''), {{IPA|/zl/}} (''zloty''), {{IPA|/tsk/}} (''Tskhinvali''), {{IPA|/hm/}} (''Hmong''), and {{IPA|/km/}} (''Khmer'').

Some clusters of this type can be converted to regular English phonotactics by simplifying the cluster: e.g. {{IPA|/(d)z/}} (''dziggetai''), {{IPA|/(h)r/}} (''Hrolf''), {{IPA|/kr(w)/}} (''croissant''), {{IPA|/(ŋ)w/}} (''[[Nguyen#Pronunciation|Nguyen]]''), {{IPA|/(p)f/}} (''pfennig''), {{IPA|/(f)θ/}} (''phthalic''), {{IPA|/(t)s/}} (''tsunami''), {{IPA|/(ǃ)k/}} (''!kung''), and {{IPA|/k(ǁ)/}} (''Xhosa'').

Others can be replaced by native clusters differing only in [[Voice (phonetics)|voice]]: &lt;!--{{IPA|/sv ~ sf/}} (''svelte''), --&gt;{{IPA|/zb ~ sp/}} (''sbirro''), and {{IPA|/zɡr ~ skr/}} (''sgraffito'').

====Nucleus====
The following can occur as the [[Syllable nucleus|nucleus]]:
*All vowel sounds
*{{IPA|/m/}}, {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/l/}} in certain situations (see below under [[#Word-level patterns|word-level patterns]])
*{{IPA|/r/}} in [[Rhotic and non-rhotic accents|rhotic varieties]] of English (e.g. [[General American]]) in certain situations (see below under [[#Word-level patterns|word-level patterns]])

====Coda====
Most (in theory, all) of the following except those that end with {{IPA|/s/}}, {{IPA|/z/}}, {{IPA|/ʃ/}}, {{IPA|/ʒ/}}, {{IPA|/tʃ/}} or {{IPA|/dʒ/}} can be extended with {{IPA|/s/}} or {{IPA|/z/}} representing the [[morpheme]] -s/-z. Similarly, most (in theory, all) of the following except those that end with {{IPA|/t/}} or {{IPA|/d/}} can be extended with {{IPA|/t/}} or {{IPA|/d/}} representing the morpheme -t/-d.

{{Harvcoltxt|Wells|1990}} argues that a variety of syllable codas are possible in English, even {{IPA|/ntr, ndr/}} in words like ''entry'' {{IPA|/ˈɛntr.ɪ/}} and ''sundry'' {{IPA|/ˈsʌndr.ɪ/}}, with {{IPA|/tr, dr/}} being treated as affricates along the lines of {{IPA|/tʃ, dʒ/}}. He argues that the traditional assumption that pre-vocalic consonants form a syllable with the following vowel is due to the influence of languages like French and Latin, where syllable structure is CVC.CVC regardless of stress placement. Disregarding such contentious cases, which do not occur at the ends of words, the following sequences can occur as the [[Syllable coda|coda]]:

===Syllable-level patterns===
*Syllables may consist of a single vowel, meaning that onset and coda are not mandatory.
*The consonant {{IPA|/ŋ/}} does not occur in syllable-initial position.
*The consonant {{IPA|/h/}} does not occur in syllable-final position.
*Onset clusters ending in {{IPA|/j/}} are followed by {{IPA|/uː/}} or its variants (see note 5 above).
*Long vowels and diphthongs are not found before {{IPA|/ŋ/}}, except for the mimetic words ''boing'' and ''oink'', unassimilated foreign words such as Burmese ''aung'' and proper names such as ''[[Taung]]'', and American-type pronunciations of words like ''strong'' (which have {{IPA|/ɔŋ/}} or {{IPA|/ɑŋ/}}). The short vowels {{IPA|/ɛ, ʊ/}} occur before {{IPA|/ŋ/}} only in assimilated non-native words such as ''[[ginseng]]'' and ''[[Sung Dynasty|Sung]]'' (name of dynasty) or non-finally in some dialects in words like ''strength''.
*{{IPA|/ʊ/}} is rare in syllable-initial position&lt;ref&gt;The OED does not list any native words that begin with {{IPA|/ʊ/}}, apart from mimetic ''oof!, ugh! oops! ook(y)''&lt;/ref&gt; (although in the northern half of England, {{IPA|[ʊ]}} is used for {{IPA|/ʌ/}} and is common at the start of syllables).
* Stop + {{IPA|/w/}} before {{IPA|/uː, ʊ, ʌ, aʊ/}} (all presently or historically {{IPA|/u(ː)/}}) are excluded.{{sfnp|Clements|Keyser|1983|p=?}}
* Sequences of {{IPA|/s/}} + C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + V̆ + C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, where C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a consonant other than {{IPA|/t/}} and V̆ is a short vowel,&lt;!--there are lots of {{IPA|/stVt/}} words--&gt; are virtually nonexistent.{{sfnp|Clements|Keyser|1983|p=?}}

===Word-level patterns===
*{{IPA|/ə/}} does not occur in stressed syllables.
*{{IPA|/ʒ/}} does not occur in word-initial position in native English words, although it can occur syllable-initially as in ''luxurious'' {{IPA|/lʌɡˈʒʊəriəs/}}, and at the start of borrowed words such as ''genre''.
*{{IPA|/m/}}, {{IPA|/n/}}, {{IPA|/l/}} and, in [[Rhotic and non-rhotic accents|rhotic varieties]], {{IPA|/r/}} can be the syllable nucleus (i.e. a [[syllabic consonant]]) in an unstressed syllable following another consonant, especially {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, {{IPA|/s/}} or {{IPA|/z/}}. Such syllables are often analyzed phonemically as having an underlying {{IPA|/ə/}} as the nucleus. See above under [[#Consonants|Consonants]].
*The short vowels are [[checked and free vowels|checked vowels]], in that they cannot occur without a coda in a word-final stressed syllable. (This does not apply to {{IPA|/ə/}}, which does not occur in stressed syllables at all.)

==Prosody==
The [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] features of English – stress, rhythm, and intonation – can be described as follows.

===Prosodic stress===
'''Prosodic stress''' is extra stress given to words or syllables when they appear in certain positions in an utterance, or when they receive special emphasis.

According to Ladefoged's analysis (as referred to under {{slink|Lexical stress}} above), English normally has prosodic stress on the final stressed syllable in an [[intonation unit]]. This is said to be the origin of the distinction traditionally made at the lexical level between primary and secondary stress: when a word like ''admiration'' (traditionally transcribed as something like {{IPA|/ˌædmɪˈreɪʃən/}}) is spoken in isolation, or at the end of a sentence, the syllable ''ra'' (the final stressed syllable) is pronounced with greater force than the syllable ''ad'', although when the word is not pronounced with this final intonation there may be no difference between the levels of stress of these two syllables.

Prosodic stress can shift for various [[pragmatics|pragmatic]] functions, such as focus or contrast. For instance, in the dialogue ''Is it brunch tomorrow? No, it's '''dinner''' tomorrow'', the extra stress shifts from the last stressed syllable of the sentence, ''to'''mor'''row'', to the last stressed syllable of the emphasized word, '''''din'''ner.''

Grammatical [[function word]]s are usually prosodically unstressed, although they can acquire stress when emphasized (as in ''Did you find the cat? Well, I found '''a''' cat''). Many English function words have distinct strong and weak pronunciations; for example, the word ''a'' in the last example is pronounced {{IPA|/eɪ/}}, while the more common unstressed ''a'' is pronounced {{IPA|/ə/}}. See [[Weak and strong forms in English]].

===Rhythm===
English is claimed to be a ''[[Timing (linguistics)|stress-timed]]'' language. That is, stressed syllables tend to appear with a more or less regular rhythm, while non-stressed syllables are shortened to accommodate this. For example, in the sentence ''One make of car is better than another'', the syllables ''one'', ''make'', ''car'', ''bett-'' and ''{{notatypo|-noth-}}'' will be stressed and relatively long, while the other syllables will be considerably shorter. The theory of stress-timing predicts that each of the three unstressed syllables in between ''bett-'' and ''{{notatypo|-noth-}}'' will be shorter than the syllable ''of'' between ''make'' and ''car'', because three syllables must fit into the same amount of time as that available for ''of''. However, it should not be assumed that all varieties of English are stress-timed in this way. The English spoken in the West Indies,{{sfnp|Collins and Mees|2013|p=138}} in Africa{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=644}} and in India{{sfnp|Wells|1982|pp=630–1}} are probably better characterized as [[Isochrony|syllable-timed]], though the lack of an agreed scientific test for categorizing an accent or language as stress-timed or syllable-timed may lead one to doubt the value of such a characterization.{{sfnp|Roach|1982|pp=73–9}}

===Intonation===
{{hatnote|For more information see {{slink|Intonation (linguistics)|Intonation in English}}}}

Phonological contrasts in intonation can be said to be found in three different and independent domains. In the work of Halliday{{sfnp|Halliday|1967|pp=18–24}} the following names are proposed:

*''Tonality'' for the distribution of continuous speech into tone groups.
*''Tonicity'' for the placing of the principal accent on a particular syllable of a word, making it the ''tonic syllable''. This is the domain also referred to as [[stress (linguistics)#Prosodic stress|prosodic stress]] or [[sentence stress]].
*''Tone'' for the choice of pitch movement on the tonic syllable. (The use of the term ''tone'' in this sense should not be confused with the [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] of tone languages, such as Chinese.)

These terms ("the Three Ts") have been used in more recent work,{{sfnp|Tench|1996}}{{sfnp|Wells|2006}} though they have been criticized for being difficult to remember.{{sfnp|Roach|2009|p=144}} American systems such as [[ToBI]] also identify contrasts involving boundaries between intonation phrases (Halliday's ''tonality''), placement of pitch accent (''tonicity''), and choice of tone or tones associated with the pitch accent (''tone'').

Example of phonological contrast involving placement of intonation unit boundaries (boundary marked by |):
{{ordered list|type=lower-alpha
 |1=Those who ran quickly {{!}} escaped.  (the only people who escaped were those who ran quickly)
 |2=Those who ran {{!}} quickly escaped.  (the people who ran escaped quickly)
}}

Example of phonological contrast involving placement of tonic syllable (marked by capital letters):
{{ordered list|type=lower-alpha
 |1=I have plans to LEAVE.  (= I am planning to leave)
 |2=I have PLANS to leave.  (= I have some drawings to leave)
}}

Example of phonological contrast (British English) involving choice of tone (\ = falling tone, \/ = fall-rise tone)
{{ordered list|type=lower-alpha
 |1=She didn't break the record because of the  \ WIND. (= she did not break the record, because the wind held her up)
 |2=She didn't break the record because of the  \/ WIND. (= she did break the record, but not because of the wind)
}}

There is typically a contrast involving tone between [[wh-question]]s and [[yes/no question]]s, the former having a falling tone (e.g. "Where did you \PUT it?") and the latter a rising tone (e.g. "Are you going /OUT?"), though studies of spontaneous speech have shown frequent exceptions to this rule.{{sfnp|Brown|1990|pp=122–3}} [[Tag questions]] asking for information are said to carry rising tones (e.g. "They are coming on Tuesday, /AREN'T they?") while those asking for confirmation have falling tone (e.g. "Your name's John, \ISN'T it.").

==History of English pronunciation==
{{Main|Phonological history of English}}

The pronunciation system of English has undergone many changes throughout the history of the language, from the [[Old English phonology|phonological system of Old English]], to [[Middle English phonology|that of Middle English]], through to that of the present day. Variation between [[English dialects|dialects]] has always been significant. Former pronunciations of many words are reflected in their spellings, as [[English orthography]] has generally not kept pace with phonological changes since the Middle English period.

The English consonant system has been relatively stable over time, although [[Phonological history of English consonants|a number of significant changes]] have occurred. Examples include the loss (in most dialects) of the {{IPA|[ç]}} and {{IPA|[x]}} sounds still reflected by the {{angbr|gh}} in words like ''night'' and ''taught'', and the splitting of voiced and voiceless allophones of fricatives into separate phonemes (such as the two different [[Pronunciation of English ⟨th⟩|phonemes represented by {{angbr|th}}]]). There have also been many [[Phonological history of English consonant clusters|changes in consonant clusters]], mostly reductions, for instance those that produced the usual modern pronunciations of such letter combinations as {{angbr|wr-}}, {{angbr|kn-}} and [[English wh|{{angbr|wh-}}]].

The [[Phonological history of English vowels|development of vowels]] has been much more complex. One of the most notable series of changes is that known as the [[Great Vowel Shift]], which began around the late 14th century. Here the {{IPA|[iː]}} and {{IPA|[uː]}} in words like ''price'' and ''mouth'' became diphthongized, and other long vowels became higher: {{IPA|[eː]}} became {{IPA|[iː]}} (as in ''meet''), {{IPA|[aː]}} became {{IPA|[eː]}} and later {{IPA|[eɪ]}} (as in ''name''), {{IPA|[oː]}} became {{IPA|[uː]}} (as in ''goose''), and {{IPA|[ɔː]}} became {{IPA|[oː]}} and later {{IPA|[oʊ]}} (in RP now {{IPA|[əʊ]}}; as in ''bone''). These shifts are responsible for the modern pronunciations of many written vowel combinations, including those involving a [[silent e|silent final {{angbr|e}}]].

Many other changes in vowels have taken place over the centuries (see the separate articles on the [[Phonological history of English low back vowels|low back]], [[Phonological history of English high back vowels|high back]] and [[Phonological history of English high front vowels|high front]] vowels, [[Phonological history of English short A|short A]], and [[Phonological history of English diphthongs|diphthongs]]). These various changes mean that many words that formerly rhymed (and may be expected to rhyme based on their spelling) no longer do.{{sfnp|Cercignani|1975|pp=513–8}} For example, in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s time, following the Great Vowel Shift, ''food'', ''good'' and ''blood'' all had the vowel {{IPA|[uː]}}, but in modern pronunciation ''good'' has been shortened to {{IPA|[ʊ]}}, while ''blood'' has been shortened and lowered to {{IPA|[ʌ]}} in most accents. In other cases, words that were formerly distinct have come to be pronounced the same – examples of such mergers include [[Meet–meat merger|''meet–meat'']], [[Pane–pain merger|''pane–pain'']] and [[Toe–tow merger|''toe–tow'']].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2265">'''Hypertext''', in [[semiotics]], is a text which alludes, derives from, or relates to an earlier work or [[hypotext]].&lt;ref name="Martin2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Bronwen|title=Key Terms in Semiotics|year=2006|publisher=Continuum|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' could be regarded as one of the many hypertexts deriving from [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'';  [[Angela Carter]]'s "The Tiger's Bride" can be considered a hypertext which relates to an earlier work, or hypotext, the original fairy-story ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]''. Hypertexts may take a variety of forms including [[imitation]], [[parody]], and [[pastiche]].

The word was defined by the French theorist [[Gérard Genette]] as follows: "Hypertextuality refers to any relationship uniting a text B (which I shall call the ''hypertext'') to an earlier text A (I shall, of course, call it the [[hypotext]]), upon which it is grafted in a manner that is not that of commentary."&lt;ref name="Genette1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Genette|first=Gérard |title=Palimpsests: Literature in the Second Degree|year=1997|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; So, a hypertext derives from hypotext(s) through a process which Genette calls transformation, in which text B "evokes" text A without necessarily mentioning it directly ".&lt;ref name="Herman1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Herman|first=David|title=Palimpsests: Literature in the Second Degree (review)|year=1998|publisher=MFS Modern Fiction Studies|pages=1043–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that this technical use of the word in semiotics differs from its use to mean a link in the field of , although the two are related. Liestøl's study of Genette's narratological model and [[hyperfiction]] considers how they are related and suggests that hyperfiction narratives have four levels:&lt;ref name="Liestol1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Liestøl|first=Gunnar|chapter=Wittgenstein, Genette, and the Reader's Narrative in Hypertext|title=

{{inline|date=July 2017}}'''''Kai''''' ({{lang|el|και}} "and"; {{IPA-el|ce|mod}}; {{IPA-el|kai|anc}}; sometimes abbreviated ''k'') is a [[grammatical conjunction|conjunction]] in [[Greek language|Greek]], Coptic ({{Coptic|ⲕⲁⲓ}}) and [[Esperanto]] (''kaj''; {{IPA-eo|kai̯|IPA}}).

''Kai'' is the most frequent word in any Greek text and thus used by statisticians to assess authorship of ancient manuscripts based on the amount of times it is used.

==Ligature==

{{SpecialChars}}

Because of its frequent occurrence, ''kai'' is sometimes abbreviated in Greek manuscripts, by a ligature (comparable to Latin [[&amp;]]), written as '''ϗ''' (uppercase variant '''Ϗ'''; [[Coptic script|Coptic]] variant '''ⳤ'''), formed from [[kappa]] (κ) with an extra lower stroke.
It may occur with the [[grave accent|varia]] above it: '''ϗ̀'''.

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Greek Kai.png|Two possible renderings of the ''kai'' abbreviation.
Image:Greek ligature kai.svg|One form of ''kai'' in medieval minuscule handwriting.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Authorship of ancient texts==

The number of common words which express a general relation ("and", "in", "but", "I", "to be") is random with the same distribution at least among the same genre. By contrast, the occurrence of the [[definite article]] "the" cannot be modeled by simple probabilistic laws because the number of nouns with definite article depends on the subject matter.

Table 1 has data about the epistles of [[Saint]] [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]]. (Abbreviations: [[Epistle to the Romans|Rom]] Romans; [[1 Corinthians|Co1]] 1st Corinthians; [[2 Corinthians|Co2]] 2nd Corinthians; [[Epistle to the Galatians|Gal]] Galatians; [[Philippians|Phi]] Philippians; [[Colossians|Col]] Colossians; [[1 Thessalonians|Th1]] 1st Thessalonians; [[1 Timothy|Ti1]] 1st Timothy; [[2 Timothy|Ti2]] 2nd Timothy; [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Heb]] Hebrews). 2nd Thessalonians, Titus, and Philemon were excluded because they were too short to give reliable samples. From an analysis of these and other data [Mor65, p.&amp;nbsp;224] the first 4 epistles (Romans, [[1 Corinthians]], [[2 Corinthians]], and [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]]) form a consistent group, and all the other epistles lie more than 2 [[standard deviation]]s from the mean of this group (using [[Chi-squared distribution|&lt;math&gt;\chi^2&lt;/math&gt; statistics]]).

'''Kjartan Fløgstad''' (born 7 June 1944) is a Norwegian [[author]]. Fløgstad was born in the industrial city of [[Sauda]] in [[Ryfylke]], [[Rogaland]].  He studied literature and [[linguistics]] at the [[University of Bergen]]. Subsequently, he worked for a period as an industrial worker and as a sailor before he debuted as a poet with his collection of poems titled ''Valfart'' (Pilgrimage) in 1968. He received the [[Nordic Council's Literature Prize]] for his 1977 novel ''Dalen Portland'' (Dollar Road). Other major works include ''Fyr og flamme'' (Fire and Flame), ''Kron og mynt'', ''Grand Manila'' and ''Grense Jakobselv''.

== Literary work ==
[[File:Kjartan Fløgstad Oslo Jazzfestival (204223).jpg|thumb|Kjartan Fløgstad at Oslo Jazzfestival 2016]]
Fløgstad initial prose work, ''Den hemmelege jubel'' (The Secret Exultation), was published in 1970. In 1972 he published the short story collection ''Fangliner'' (Ropes), where he encourages seaman and shift workers in heavy industry to make themselves heard in their own language, and the author's [[Marxism|Marxist]] viewpoint became apparent. In the 1970s he also wrote two crime novels using the two [[pseudonym]]s K. Villun and K. Villum. His major breakthrough came in 1977 with the novel ''Dalen Portland'' (Dollar Road); which was awarded the [[The Nordic Council's Literature Prize|Nordic Council's Literature Prize]]. Following this, ''Fyr og flamme'' (Fire and Flame) in 1980 and ''Det 7. klima'' (The Seventh Climate) in 1986 were his next most recognized works. In the major novels he demonstrates a command of realistic precision combined with an understanding of sociology. Fløgstad's work depicts the economic and social transitions as Norway moves from an agricultural culture to an industrial society, and then to a [[post-industrial society]].

Fløgstad's style of writing, as demonstrated in both fiction and non-fiction, is very characteristic; lots of puns, [[allusions]] to other texts and to films and a mix of [[sociolects]]. He is one of the best-known authors associated with [[magic realism]] in Norway, and his overall realistic plots often feature many fantastic twists.

{{wiktionary|Latinx}}
'''''Latinx''''' ({{respell|la-teen-ex}}) ({{IPAc-en|l|ə|ˈ|t|iː|n|ɛ|k|s|,_|l|æ|-}}) is a [[Gender neutrality|gender-neutral]] term sometimes used in lieu of ''[[Latino]]'' or ''Latina'' (referencing [[Latin America]]n cultural or racial identity). The plural is ''Latinxs''. The {{nobr|''-x''}} replaces the standard {{nobr|''-o''}} and {{nobr|''-a''}} endings in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[West Iberian languages|related languages]], which form nouns of the masculine and feminine genders, respectively. The term is a politicized [[neologism]] that has gained traction among advocacy groups [[Intersectionality|intersectionally]] combining the [[identity politics]] of [[Race (human categorization)|race]] and [[gender]]. Other forms such as '''''Latin@''''' and '''''Latine''''' are also used.

== History ==
The term ''Latinx'' emerged from American Spanish in the early 21st century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/latinx|title=Home : Oxford English Dictionary|website=www.oed.com|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was reportedly first used online in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gamio|first=Arlene|title=Latinx: A Brief Guidebook|url=https://www.academia.edu/29657615/Latinx_A_Brief_Guidebook}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has gained popularity in social media, and is mostly used by community activists and in higher education settings by students, faculty, staff, and some administrators who seek to advocate for individuals living on [[Genderqueer|the borderlines of gender identity]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Salinas|first1=Cristobal|last2=Lozano|first2=Adele|title=Mapping and recontextualizing the evolution of the term Latinx: An environmental scanning in higher education|journal=Journal of Latinos and Education|page=1|date=2017|doi=10.1080/15348431.2017.1390464|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15348431.2017.1390464?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true#.WhQdpN411v4.twitter|accessdate=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Google Trends]], interest in the term spiked in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=latinx|title=Google Trends|website=Google Trends|access-date=2017-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term appears in print, also in 2016, in the context of [[LGBT studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wo_JDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=latinx+term#v=onepage&amp;q=latinx%20term&amp;f=false|title=An Examination of Latinx LGBT Populations Across the United States: Intersections of Race and Sexuality|last=Jr|first=Antonio (Jay) Pastrana|last2=Battle|first2=Juan|last3=Harris|first3=Angelique|date=2016-12-22|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781137560742}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 NBC News report noted that it was "difficult to pinpoint" the origins of the term, but found "anecdotal evidence" that the term was in use in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Reyes|first=Raul A.|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/are-you-latinx-usage-grows-word-draws-approval-criticism-n651396|title=Are you Latinx? As Usage Grows, Word Draws Approval, Criticism|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same report stated that usage of the term was "without question on the rise at U.S. colleges". [[Oberlin College]], [[New York University]], [[Central Washington University]], and [[Colorado State University]] are among the academic institutions that have advertised events using the word ''Latinx''.

At [[Princeton University]], a [[student group]] called the Princeton University Latinx Perspective Organization was founded in 2016 to "unify Princeton's diverse Latinx community".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://pulatinx.wixsite.com/pulpo|title=Home {{!}} Princeton University Latinx Perspectives Organization|work=Home {{!}} Princeton University Latinx Perspectives Organization|access-date=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, several student-run organizations at other institutions have utilized the word in their title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lsp.unc.edu/student-organizations/|title=Student Organizations {{!}} UNC Latina/o Studies Program|website=lsp.unc.edu|access-date=2017-04-23}}

Salinas and Lozano (2017) stated that the term is influenced by Mexican indigenous communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Salinas|first1=Cristobal|last2=Lozano|first2=Adele|date=2017|title=Mapping and recontextualizing the evolution of the term Latinx: An environmental scanning in higher education|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15348431.2017.1390464?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true#.WhQdpN411v4.twitter|journal=Journal of Latinos and Education|page=1|doi=10.1080/15348431.2017.1390464|accessdate=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scharrón-del Río and  Aja (2015) have traced the use of Latinx in authors Beatriz Llenin Figueroa, Jaime Géliga Quiñones,  Yuderkys Espinosa Miñoso and Adriana Gallegos Dextre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latinorebels.com/2015/12/05/the-case-for-latinx-why-intersectionality-is-not-a-choice/|title=The Case ''for'' 'Latinx': Why Intersectionality Is Not a Choice|last1=Scharrón-del Río|first1=María R.|last2=Aja|first2=Alan A.|date=2015-12-05|website=Latino Rebels|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has also been discussed in publications by Pastrana (2016), Battle (2016) and Valdes (2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7HVgDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=latinx+term#v=onepage&amp;q=latinx%20term&amp;f=false|title=Diasporic Blackness: The Life and Times of Arturo Alfonso Schomburg|last=Valdés|first=Vanessa K.|date=2017-03-15|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9781438465159}}

==Reception==
The term ''Latinx'' has been the subject of controversy.  In an article for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Daniel Hernandez wrote "Like many of its awkward predecessors, 'Latinx' does not work. Its experimental 'x' opens too many linguistic floodgates. And why is this kind of label necessary at all?"&lt;ref name=L&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|title=The case ''against'' 'Latinx'|last=Hernandez|first=Daniel|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-hernandez-the-case-against-latinx-20171217-story.html|date=December 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article on ''[[HuffPost]]'' stated, "Despite the growing popularity of the term, ''Latinx'' has been faced with criticism. Many opponents of the term have suggested that using an un-gendered [[noun]] like ''Latinx'' is disrespectful to the [[Spanish language]] and some have even called the term "a blatant form of linguistic [[imperialism]]." Some refuse to use the term as "''Latinx'' doesn't roll off the tongue in the Spanish language."&lt;ref name=HP&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-people-are-using-the-term-latinx_us_57753328e4b0cc0fa136a159|title=Why People Are Using The Term 'Latinx'|author1=Ramirez, Tanisha Love|author2=Blay, Zeba|date=2016-07-05|work=[[HuffPost]]|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in defense of the term, Brooklyn College professors María R. Scharrón-del Río and Alan A. Aja argue that the Spanish language itself is a form of linguistic imperialism for [[Latin Americans]].&lt;ref name=HP/&gt;

Hector Luis Alamo wrote in an article for ''Latino Rebels'', "If we dump ''Latino'' for ''Latinx'' because it offends some people, then we should go on dumping words forever since there will always be some people who find some words offensive. No word ever oppressed anybody (except maybe the word ''[[God]]'')."&lt;ref name=LR&gt;{{cite web|date=December 12, 2015|author=Luis Alamo, Hector|title=The X-ing of Language: The Case Against 'Latinx'|url=http://www.latinorebels.com/2015/12/12/the-x-ing-of-language-the-case-against-latinix/|work=Latino Rebels}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The gendering of language: A comparison of gender equality in countries with gendered, natural gender, and genderless languages."  Sex Roles 66 (3-4):268-281.&lt;/ref&gt; and asserts, "Less clear in the debate (as it has developed since then) is how the replacement silences and erases long-standing struggles to recognize the significance of gender difference and sexual violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Trujillo-Pagán |first=Nicole |url=http://www.latinorebels.com/2018/02/27/no-shock-or-awe-about-acting-latinx/ |title=No Shock or Awe About 'Acting' Latinx |publisher=Latino Rebels |date=2018-02-27 |accessdate=2018-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternatives ==
An alternative term is ''Latin@'' (pronounced ''Latínao'') where the postfixed {{nobr|''-[[@]]''}} is taken to represent a combination of {{nobr|''-a''}} and {{nobr|''-o''}} in a single character. This variant is somewhat older, in use since the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/heymigente/what-is-latinx-and-afrolatinx-c05a63b5a3d4|title=What is Latinx and AfroLatinx?|publisher=[[Medium (website)|Medium]]|date=2016-08-18|website=#HeyMiGente|access-date=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has received criticism for adhering to a binary view of gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latinorebels.com/2015/12/05/the-case-for-latinx-why-intersectionality-is-not-a-choice/|title=The Case '''for''' ''Latinx'': Why Intersectionality Is Not a Choice|last=Scharrón-del Río|first=María R. |last2=Aja|first2=Alan A.|date=2015-12-05|website=Latino Rebels|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another, more recent, variant is ''Latine'', where the vowel {{nobr|''-e''}} is taken as a "neutral" alternative to either {{nobr|''-a''}} or {{nobr|''-o''}}. Proponents of ''Latine'' say it sounds more natural and grammatical to native Spanish speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=latin|title=Google Trends|website=Google Trends|access-date=2017-04-23}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21529">An [[endangered language]] is a [[language]] that is at risk of falling out of use, generally because it has few surviving speakers. If it loses all of its native speakers, it becomes an [[extinct language]]. A language may be endangered in one area but show signs of revitalisation in another, as with the [[Irish language]].

The [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] defines [[Endangered language#UNESCO definitions|five levels of language endangerment]] between "safe" (not endangered) and "extinct":&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;
{{cite book |year=2010 |editor-last=Moseley |editor-first=Christopher |title=Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/endangered-languages/atlas-of-languages-in-danger/ |series=Memory of Peoples |edition=3rd |location=Paris |publisher=UNESCO Publishing |isbn=978-92-3-104096-2 |access-date=2015-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Vulnerable - "most children speak the language, but it may be restricted to certain domains (e.g. home)"
* Definitely endangered - "children no longer learn the language as mother tongue in the home"
* Severely endangered - "language is spoken by grandparents and older generations; while the parent generation may understand it, they do not speak it to children or among themselves"
* Critically endangered - "the youngest speakers are grandparents and older, and they speak the language partially and infrequently"
* Extinct - "there are no speakers left; included in the Atlas if presumably extinct since the 1950s"

The list below includes the findings from the third edition of ''[[Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger]]'' (2010; formerly the ''Red Book of Endangered Languages''), as well as the online edition of the aforementioned publication, both published by UNESCO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/languages-atlas/index.php?hl=en&amp;page=atlasmap# For the online atlas version see here]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1620">'''Military crest''' is a term in [[military science]] that refers to, "An area on the forward or [[Reverse slope defence|reverse slope]] of a [[hill]] or [[ridge]] just below the topographical crest from which maximum observation and [[direct fire]] covering the slope down to the base of the hill or ridge can be obtained."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/101-5-1/f545-m.htm U.S. Army Field Manual FM 101-5-1, ''Operational Terms and Graphics''&lt;/ref&gt;

The military crest is used in maneuvering along the side of a hill or ridge to provide the maneuvering force maximum visibility of the terrain below and minimize their own visibility by not being silhouetted against the sky, as it would be at the actual or topographical crest of the hill.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Army Field Manual, FM 3-97.61, 8-4.d(2)a&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Observation post]]s (OPs) can be located at the military crest if the main defensive position is located on the reverse slope of the hill or ridge, as is usually done if the main defensive position would be vulnerable to the enemy's [[artillery]] if located at the military crest, making coordinated withdrawal difficult.

The main defensive position can be located at the military crest if it is defensible to a strong attack, which gives the defensive force the maximum ability to not only see the approaching attacking forces but also bring maximum firepower to bear at the earliest opportunity.

[[File:1973 1st GB PHQ card-WGGrace.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|First PHQ card issued in 1975 featuring [[W.G. Grace]]]]
'''PHQ cards''' are [[postcard]]s issued by the [[British Post Office]] depicting the designs of their [[commemorative stamp]]s. They are generally available to buy in main post offices about two weeks prior to the release of each new set of stamps.

== Description ==

The 'PHQ' stands for Postal Headquarters. All items published by the Post Office are given a number which is prefixed by letters. The first card issued, on 16 May 1973, was numbered PHQ1, and the numbering sequence has continued to the present day.

There are however two gaps in the sequence, and two duplications. The number PHQ24 was originally set aside for the 9p [[Silver Jubilee]] card (issued after the rest of the set), but when it was issued the card was numbered PHQ22E. The next set (Wildlife cards, issued 5 October 1977) had already been allocated the number PHQ25, and so the number PHQ24 was never used.

The London 1980 Exhibition card, issued 9 April 1980 to commemorate the 1980 International Stamp Exhibition, and the set of five cards for London Landmarks, issued 7 May 1980, both had the reference number PHQ43.

The set of five cards for Gallantry, issued 11 September 1990, and the set of four cards for Astronomy, issued 16 October 1990, both had the reference number PHQ129. Consequently, the number PHQ130 was unused.

== History ==
The first card issued was the 3p [[W.G. Grace]] stamp from the set of stamps commemorating County [[Cricket]], issued on 16 May 1973, but not released until mid-July. Subsequent cards have been issued about two weeks prior to the release of the stamps. This enables collectors to obtain the cards before the issue of the stamps so that they can attach the relevant stamp and obtain First Day of Issue [[postmark]]s.

When they were first issued, the PHQ cards were intended to be just an occasional picture [[postcard]] for sale to the public at Post Offices and Philatelic Counters. However, right from the first card issued, some enterprising Stamp Dealers realised that there was a potential new [[Stamp collecting]] area, and stamps were fixed either to the face of the card, or the back, and postmarks for various [[cricket]] matches played between July and September 1973 were obtained.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

In August 1973 a second card was issued for one of the stamps in the set to mark the 400th anniversary of the birth of [[Inigo Jones]], [[architect]] and [[designer]]. Over the next three years several more single cards, and a few sets were issued, from July 1976 onwards there has been a set of cards issued for every new set of commemorative stamps that has been issued.

The first two cards issued, 1973 [[Cricket]] and 1973 [[Inigo Jones]], are larger than the current cards, measuring 120&amp;nbsp;mm x 172&amp;nbsp;mm in size, while all cards issued from PHQ3 onward are 104&amp;nbsp;mm x 148&amp;nbsp;mm in size. This can be confusing for new collectors coming across the first two issues for the first time, if they are not aware of the size difference, they tend to think they are worthless copies.

== Collecting PHQ cards ==
{{main|List of PHQ cards}}
There are three main areas of collecting interest. Many collectors like to collect only the unused cards, but some like to obtain them with [[first day of issue]] postmarks. Others like to obtain them with special handstamps that have some connection to the stamp subject matter.
Also, stamp collectors will usually put the stamp on the back of the card, but a very popular variation is for the stamp to be applied to the face of the card, so that the [[postcard]] picture, stamp and [[postmark]] are all visible on the same face.

== Postmarks and handstamps ==
The first card was not put on sale until two months after the issue date of the stamps, so would not have been eligible for a [[First day of issue]] postmark. However the card is known to exist with 16 May 1973, Birmingham FDI cancellation (back-dated by favour), but it is much more collectable with the July and September pictorial cricket postmarks.
The cricket [[postmark]]s to look out for are 21 July, Benson &amp; Hedges, and 1 September [[Friends Provident Trophy|Gillette Cup]].

== The early issues ==

Below are the issue dates of all the early cards, issued up until July 1976. Since this date a full set of cards has been issued for every commemorative set, and for some of the definitive issues.

'''Petras Cvirka''' (March 12, 1909, [[Jurbarkas District Municipality|Klangai]], [[Kovno Governorate]] – May 2, 1947, [[Vilnius]]) was a [[Lithuania]]n author of several novels, children's books, and short story collections. He wrote under a variety of ''[[nom de plume|noms de plume]]'': A. Cvingelis, Cezaris Petrėnas, J. K. Pavilionis, K. Cvirka, Kanapeikus, Kazys Gerutis, Klangis, Klangis Petras, Klangių Petras, L. P. Cvirka, Laumakys, P. Cvinglis, P. Cvirka-Rymantas, P. Gelmė, P. Veliuoniškis, Petras Serapinas, and S. Laumakys.&lt;ref name=anto/&gt; His works have been translated into Belarusian, Bulgarian, Chinese, Czech, English, Estonian, Hungarian, Latvian, Polish, Romanian, and Uzbek.&lt;ref name=mku/&gt;

==Biography==
Cvirka attended an art school in Kaunas between 1926 and 1930. However, after graduation he drifted away from visual arts to literature.&lt;ref name=xxi/&gt; He began publishing poetry in 1924 and studied literature in [[Paris]] during 1931 and 1932. He translated 9 books and 34 shorter works from French into Lithuanian.&lt;ref name=french/&gt; Later in the decade he travelled to [[Moscow]], [[Leningrad]], and western Europe. He joined the Communist Party in 1940 and supported Lithuania's incorporation into the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=mku/&gt;

In 1941, following the [[Operation Barbarossa|outbreak of war between Germany and the Soviet Union]], he moved to [[Alma-Ata]] and then [[Moscow]], joining the [[Union of Writers of the USSR]]. Returning to Lithuania in 1944, he went on to serve as chairman of the [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic]]'s Writer's Union and as editor of the journal ''[[Pergalė]]'' (Victory). After Cvirka's death in 1947, the Soviet authorities erected a monument to his memory in [[Vilnius]]. This monument became the object of controversy after the [[Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania|restoration of independence in 1990]] due to Cvirka's pro-communist activities. There were calls for its removal.&lt;ref name=monum/&gt;

==Works==
Cvirka's works combine biting commentary on social issues with keen feelings for the natural world.&lt;ref name=vaicu/&gt; His works are also known for their wit and strong dialogue.&lt;ref name=babra/&gt; The novel ''Meisteris ir sūnūs'' depicts the folk art of Lithuania in a new way. It incorporates plentiful [[folkloric]] and [[ethnographic]] details of Lithuanian village life and attempts to translate rich oral traditions into the written medium.&lt;ref name=meist/&gt; A prominent example of [[socialist realism]], the novel ''Žemė maitintoja'' depicts an ideal [[New Soviet man|new socialist man]].&lt;ref name=aidai/&gt; The protagonist is a young, non-religious, determined farmer, who received his land as a result of the land reform when estates of [[Lithuanian nobility|former nobility]] were divided among the poor. He has no emotional attachment to his land, rather perceiving the economic benefits of [[collective farming]]. This is an example of a person who needs to be created by communism.&lt;ref name=aidai/&gt; The two-volume ''Frank Kruk'' is a satirical novel about Pranas Krukelis, a Lithuanian immigrant to the United States who Americanizes his name to Frank Kruk. Krukelis engages in criminal activity and exploits other Lithuanian immigrants.&lt;ref name=kruk/&gt; A theatrical adaptation was staged in [[Klaipėda]] in 2003; [[Vytautas Paukštė]] received the [[Lithuanian National Prize]] for his portrayal of Kruk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Frank Kruk" Klaipėdoje|publisher=culture.lt|url=http://www.culture.lt/7md/?kas=straipsnis&amp;leid_id=545&amp;st_id=1761|accessdate=2009-12-20|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Tarp laureatų daugėja šiuolaikinio meno atstovų|url=http://archyvas.veidas.lt/lt/leidinys.nrfull/47600464aea3e| journal=Veidas| date=2007-12-12 |issue=50 |first=Renata |last=Baltrušaitytė|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cvirka was the first writer to address the [[Lithuanian partisans]] – anti-Soviet guerrilla fighters – in the short story ''Pabučiavimas'', one of his last works.&lt;ref name=pabu/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15122">In the theory of [[formal language]]s, the '''pumping lemma for regular languages''' is a [[Lemma (mathematics)|lemma]] that describes an essential property of all [[regular language]]s. Informally, it says that all sufficiently long words in a regular language may be ''pumped''—that is, have a middle section of the word repeated an arbitrary number of times—to produce a new word that also lies within the same language.

Specifically, the pumping lemma says that for any regular language &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; there exists a constant &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; such that any word &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; with length at least &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; can be split into three substrings, {{nowrap begin}}&lt;math&gt;w = xyz&lt;/math&gt;{{nowrap end}}, where the middle portion &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; must not be empty, such that the words &lt;math&gt;xz, xyz, xyyz, xyyyz, ...&lt;/math&gt; constructed by repeating &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; zero or more times are still in &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;. This process of repetition is known as "pumping". Moreover, the pumping lemma guarantees that the length of &lt;math&gt;xy&lt;/math&gt; will be at most &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, imposing a limit on the ways in which &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; may be split. Finite languages [[vacuous truth|vacuously]] satisfy the pumping lemma by having &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; equal to the maximum string length in &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; plus one.

The pumping lemma is useful for disproving the regularity of a specific language in question. It was first proven by [[Michael O. Rabin|Michael Rabin]] and [[Dana Scott]] in 1959,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rabin |first1=Michael |authorlink1=Michael O. Rabin|last2=Scott |first2=Dana |authorlink2=Dana Scott  |date=Apr 1959 |title=Finite Automata and Their Decision Problems |journal=IBM Journal of Research and Development |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=114–125 |url=http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~coquand/AUTOMATA/rs.pdf |doi=10.1147/rd.32.0114 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214122150/http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~coquand/AUTOMATA/rs.pdf |archivedate=December 14, 2010 }} Here: Lemma 8, p.119&lt;/ref&gt; and rediscovered shortly after by [[Yehoshua Bar-Hillel]], [[Micha A. Perles]], and [[Eli Shamir]] in 1961, as a simplification of their [[pumping lemma for context-free languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

== Formal statement ==
Let &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; be a regular language. Then there exists an integer &lt;math&gt;p \geq 1&lt;/math&gt; depending only on &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; such that every string &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; of length at least &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is called the "pumping length"&lt;ref name=BLRS86&gt;{{cite book | last1=Berstel | first1=Jean | last2=Lauve | first2=Aaron | last3=Reutenauer | first3=Christophe | last4=Saliola | first4=Franco V. | title=Combinatorics on words. Christoffel words and repetitions in words | series=CRM Monograph Series | volume=27 | location=Providence, RI | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | year=2009 | isbn=978-0-8218-4480-9 | zbl=1161.68043 | page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;) can be written as &lt;math&gt;w = xyz&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; can be divided into three substrings), satisfying the following conditions:

* &lt;math&gt; \mid y \mid \geq 1 &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; \mid xy \mid \leq p &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; (\forall n \geq 0) ( xy^nz \in L )&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is the substring that can be pumped (removed or repeated any number of times, and the resulting string is always in &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;). (1) means the loop &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; to be pumped must be of length at least one; (2) means the loop must occur within the first &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; characters. |''x''| must be smaller than &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; (conclusion of (1) and (2)), but apart from that, there is no restriction on &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;.

In simple words, for any regular language &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, any sufficiently long word &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; (in &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;) can be split into 3 parts.
i.e. &lt;math&gt;w = xyz&lt;/math&gt; , such that all the strings &lt;math&gt;xy^nz&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;n \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; are also in &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;.

Below is a formal expression of the Pumping Lemma.

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{l}                                                                                                                                       
(\forall  L\subseteq \Sigma^*)  \\                                                                                                                     
\quad      (\mbox{regular}(L) \Rightarrow \\                                                                                                           
\quad      ((\exists p\geq 1) ( (\forall w\in L) ((|w|\geq p) \Rightarrow \\                                                                           
\quad ((\exists x,y,z \in \Sigma^*) (w=xyz \land (|y|\geq 1 \land |xy|\leq p \land                                                                
(\forall n\geq 0)(xy^nz\in L))))))))                                                                                                                   
\end{array} 
&lt;/math&gt;

== Use of the lemma ==
The pumping lemma is often used to prove that a particular language is non-regular: a [[proof by contradiction]] (of the language's regularity) may consist of exhibiting a word (of the required length) in the language that lacks the property outlined in the pumping lemma.

For example, the language &lt;math&gt;L = \{a^n b^n : n \geq 0\}&lt;/math&gt; over the alphabet &lt;math&gt;\Sigma = \{a, b\}&lt;/math&gt; can be shown to be non-regular as follows:

Let &lt;math&gt;w, x, y, z, p&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; be as used in the [[Pumping lemma for regular languages#Formal statement|formal statement for the pumping lemma]] above.  We assume that there exists some constant &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; be given by &lt;math&gt;w = a^p b^p&lt;/math&gt;, which is a string longer than &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. By the pumping lemma, there must be some decomposition &lt;math&gt;w = xyz&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\mid xy \mid \leq p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mid y \mid \geq 1&lt;/math&gt; such that
&lt;math&gt;xy^iz&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;i \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;. Using &lt;math&gt;\mid xy \mid \leq p&lt;/math&gt;, we know &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; only consists of instances of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.  Moreover, because &lt;math&gt;\mid y \mid \geq 1&lt;/math&gt;, it contains at least one instance of the letter &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;. We now pump &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; up: &lt;math&gt;xy^2z&lt;/math&gt; has more instances of the letter &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; than the letter &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, since we have added some instances of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; without adding instances of &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;xy^2z&lt;/math&gt; is not in &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;.  We have reached a contradiction.  Therefore, the assumption that &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is regular (i.e. there exists such a &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;) must be incorrect. Hence &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is not regular.

The proof that the [[Dyck language|language of balanced (i.e., properly nested) parentheses]] is not regular follows the same idea.  Given &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, there is a string of balanced parentheses that begins with more than &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; left parentheses, so that &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; will consist entirely of left parentheses.  By repeating &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, we can produce a string that does not contain the same number of left and right parentheses, and so they cannot be balanced.

== Proof of the pumping lemma ==

[[File:Pumping-Lemma_xyz_svg.svg|thumb|400px|Proof idea: Whenever a sufficiently long [[string (formal languages)|string]] ''xyz'' is recognized by a [[finite automaton#Mathematical model|finite automaton]], it must have reached some state (&lt;math&gt;q_s = q_t&lt;/math&gt;) twice. Hence, after repeating ("pumping") the middle part &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; arbitrarily often (''xyyz'', ''xyyyz'', ...) the word will still be recognized.]]
For every regular language there is a [[finite state automaton]] (FSA) that accepts the language.  The number of states in such an FSA are counted and that count is used as the pumping length &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. For a string of length at least &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;q_0&lt;/math&gt; be the start state and let &lt;math&gt;q_1, ..., q_p&lt;/math&gt; be the sequence of the next &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; states visited as the string is emitted.  Because the FSA has only &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; states, within this sequence of &lt;math&gt;p+1&lt;/math&gt; visited states there must be at least one state that is repeated.  Write &lt;math&gt;q_s&lt;/math&gt; for such a state.  The transitions that take the machine from the first encounter of state &lt;math&gt;q_s&lt;/math&gt; to the second encounter of state &lt;math&gt;q_s&lt;/math&gt; match some string.  This string is called &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; in the lemma, and since the machine will match a string without the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; portion, or with the string &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; repeated any number of times, the conditions of the lemma are satisfied.

For example, the following image shows an FSA.

[[File:An automat accepting the language a(bc)*d.svg]]

The FSA accepts the  string:  '''abcd'''.  Since this string has a length at least as large as the number of states, which is four, the [[pigeonhole principle]] indicates that there must be at least one repeated state among the start state and the next four visited states.  In this example, only &lt;math&gt;q_1&lt;/math&gt; is a repeated state.  Since the substring '''bc''' takes the machine through transitions that start at state &lt;math&gt;q_1&lt;/math&gt; and end at state &lt;math&gt;q_1&lt;/math&gt;, that portion could be repeated and the FSA would still accept, giving the string '''abcbcd'''.  Alternatively, the '''bc''' portion could be removed and the FSA would still accept giving the string '''ad'''.  In terms of the pumping lemma, the string '''abcd''' is broken into an &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; portion '''a''', a &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; portion '''bc''' and a &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; portion '''d'''.

== General version of pumping lemma for regular languages ==
If a language &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is regular, then there exists a number &lt;math&gt;p \geq 1&lt;/math&gt; (the pumping length) such that every string &lt;math&gt;uwv&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; with |''w''| &amp;ge; ''p'' can be written in the form 
:&lt;math&gt;uwv = uxyzv&lt;/math&gt;
with strings ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'' such that |''xy''| &amp;le; ''p'', |''y''| &amp;ge; 1 and
:&lt;math&gt;uxy^izv&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; for every integer &lt;math&gt;i \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Savitch |first1=Walter |year=1982 |title=Abstract Machines and Grammars |isbn=0-316-77161-9 |page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;
From this, the [[#Formal statement|above]] standard version follows a special case, with both &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; being the empty string.

Since the general version imposes stricter requirements on the language, it can be used to prove the non-regularity of many more languages, such as &lt;math&gt;\{ a^m b^n c^n : m \geq 1 \text{ and } n \geq 1 \}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=John E. Hopcroft  |author2=Jeffrey D. Ullman  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation | location=Reading/MA | publisher=Addison-Wesley | isbn=0-201-02988-X | year=1979 }} Here: p. 72, Exercise 3.2 (which give a slightly less general version, requiring |''w''|=''p'') and 3.3&lt;/ref&gt;

== Converse of lemma not true ==
While the pumping lemma states that all regular languages satisfy the conditions described above, the converse of this statement is not true: a language that satisfies these conditions may still be non-regular. In other words, both the original and the general version of the pumping lemma give a [[Necessary and sufficient condition|''necessary'' but not ''sufficient'' condition]] for a language to be regular.

For example, consider the following language:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}L &amp; = &amp; \{uvwxy : u,y \in \{0,1,2,3\}^*; v,w,x \in \{0,1,2,3\} \land (v=w \lor v=x \lor x=w)\} \\ &amp; &amp; \cup \ \{w : w \in \{0,1,2,3\}^*\land \text {precisely } \tfrac 1 7 \text{ of the characters in }w \text{ are 3's}\}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;.
In other words, &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; contains all strings over the alphabet &lt;math&gt;\{0,1,2,3\}&lt;/math&gt; with a substring of length 3 including a duplicate character, as well as all strings over this alphabet where precisely 1/7 of the string's characters are 3's. This language is not regular but can still be "pumped" with &lt;math&gt;p = 5&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose some string ''s'' has length at least 5. Then, since the alphabet has only four characters, at least two of the first five characters in the string must be duplicates. They are separated by at most three characters.
* If the duplicate characters are separated by 0 characters, or 1, pump one of the other two characters in the string, which will not affect the substring containing the duplicates.
* If the duplicate characters are separated by 2 or 3 characters, pump 2 of the characters separating them. Pumping either down or up results in the creation of a substring of size 3 that contains 2 duplicate characters.
* The second condition of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; ensures that &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is not regular: Consider the string &lt;math&gt;(013)^{3m}(012)^i&lt;/math&gt;. This string is in &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; exactly when &lt;math&gt;i=4m&lt;/math&gt; and thus &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is not regular by the [[Myhill–Nerode theorem]].

The [[Myhill–Nerode theorem]] provides a test that exactly characterizes regular languages.  The typical method for proving that a language is regular is to construct either a [[finite state machine]] or a [[regular expression]] for the language.

The '''Punjabi Suba movement''' aimed at creation of a [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]-majority [[Subah (province)|subah]] ("province") in the erstwhile [[East Punjab]] state of India in the 1950s. Led by the [[Akali Dal]], it resulted in the formation of the Punjabi-majority [[Punjab (India)|Punjab state]], the Haryanvi-Hindi-majority [[Haryana]] state and the [[Union Territory]] of [[Chandigarh]]. Some [[Western Pahari languages|Pahari]] majority parts of the East Punjab were also merged with [[Himachal Pradesh]] as a result of the movement.

== Background ==

[[File:Punjabispeakers.png|thumb|right|A map of the distribution of native Punjabi speakers in India and Pakistan]]
In the 1950s, the linguistic groups across India sought statehood, which led to the establishment of the [[States Reorganisation Commission]] in dec 1953. At that time, the East Punjab state of India included present-day states of [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]], [[Haryana]] and [[Himachal Pradesh]] (some parts) along with [[Chandigarh]]. East Punjab had a majority of Hindu religion followed by the Sikhs. 

The [[Akali Dal]], a Sikh-dominated political party active mainly in Punjab, sought to create a Punjabi Suba ("Punjabi Province"). The Sikh leaders such [[Fateh Singh (Sikh leader)|Fateh Singh]] tactically stressed the linguistic basis of the demand, while downplaying its religious basis — a state where the distinct Sikh identity could be preserved.&lt;ref name="paul_brass_north_india"&gt;{{cite book | first = Paul R. | last = Brass | title = Language, Religion and Politics in North India | publisher = iUniverse | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-0-595-34394-2 | page = 326 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Government of India was wary of carving out a separate [[Punjabi language]] state, because it effectively meant dividing the state along religious lines: Sikhs would form a 60% majority in the resulting Punjabi state.&lt;ref name="Tribune_Relations_2003"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2003/20031103/edit.htm#5 |title=Hindu-Sikh relations — I |newspaper=The Tribune |location=Chandigarh, India |publisher=Tribuneindia.com |date=2003-11-03 |accessdate=2010-01-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605231120/http://www.tribuneindia.com/2003/20031103/edit.htm#5 |archive-date=5 June 2011 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The case for creating a Punjabi Suba was presented to the States Reorganisation Commission. The States Reorganisation Commission, not recognising Punjabi as a language that was grammatically very distinct from Hindi, rejected the demand for a Punjabi-majority state.{{Cn|date=August 2018}} Another reason that the Commission gave in its report was that the movement lacked general support of the people inhabiting the region.{{Cn|date=August 2018}}

[[History of Haryana#Hindi language movement of Punjab|Hindi language movement of Punjab]] in the Hindi-speaking areas of Punjab started on 30 April 1957 and lasted till 27 December 1957, which paved the way for the demand for the formation of Haryana as a separate state for the Hindi speaking people of the united Punjab province. At the same time Punjab also had Punjabi suba &amp; Punjabi language movement. [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] and [[gurmukhi]] were made official state language and script respectively, which was also made mandatory in schools of the whole of post-independence united Punjab. People of Hindi speaking areas of Punjab resisted this imposition in masses. Punjab government retaliated by mass arrests and imprisonments, some of arrested activists were tortured in the prison. Sumer Singh of Naya Bans in Rohtak district gave his life for this cause during this movement.&lt;ref name=hindimove1&gt;[http://haryanasamvad.gov.in/store/document/Haryana%20Samvad%20September%20%202018.pdf Har Samvand], Sept 2018, p12.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[States Reorganisation Act]], the [[Patiala and East Punjab States Union]] (PEPSU) was merged with Punjab. However, the state still did not have a clear Punjabi majority, as it contained a large Hindi-speaking area.{{Cn|date=August 2018}}

== Akali Dal's agitation ==

The Akali Dal leaders continued their agitation for the creation of a "Punjabi Suba" after the merger of PEPSU to Punjab. Akali leader Sant Fateh Singh spearheaded the Punjabi Suba Morcha in 1966.&lt;ref name="Tribune_Celebrate"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dhaliwal |first1=Sarbjit |title=Punjabi Suba: What’s there to celebrate? |url=https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/comment/punjabi-suba-what-s-there-to-celebrate/292265.html |accessdate=4 August 2018 |publisher=The Tribune |date=9 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171231111518/http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/comment/punjabi-suba-what-s-there-to-celebrate/292265.html |archive-date=31 December 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Result ==
In September 1966, the [[Indira Gandhi]]-led Union Government accepted the demand. On September 7, 1966 [[Punjab Reorganisation Act, 1966 |Punjab Reorganisation Act]] was passed in Parliament.  The Act was implemented with effect from November 1, 1966. Punjab was trifurcated creating Punjab, Haryana and transferring certain areas to Himachal Pradesh.&lt;ref name="india_gov_PRA_1966"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://india.gov.in/allimpfrms/allacts/474.pdf | title = The Punjab Reorganisation Act, 1966 | publisher = Government of India | date = 1966-09-18 | accessdate = 2011-12-26 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120119110225/http://india.gov.in/allimpfrms/allacts/474.pdf | archive-date = 19 January 2012 | dead-url = no | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Areas in the south of Punjab that spoke the [[Haryanvi language|Haryanvi]] dialect of Hindi formed the new state of [[Haryana]], while the areas that spoke the [[Western Pahari languages|Pahari dialects]] were merged to [[Himachal Pradesh]] (a [[Union Territory]] at the time). The remaining areas, except [[Chandigarh]], formed the new Punjabi-majority state, which retained the name of Punjab.&lt;ref name="WHM_Sikhs_1991"&gt;The Sikhs: History, Religion, and Society By W. H. McLeod,Published 1991, Columbia University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1966, Punjab was a Hindu majority state (63.7%). But during the linguistic partition, the Hindu-majority districts were removed from the state.&lt;ref&gt;The Sikhs as a "Minority" in a Sikh Majority State in India, by Paul Wallace, Asian Survey, 1986 University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt; Chandigarh, the planned city built to replace [[Lahore]], the capital of erstwhile Punjab, which became part of Pakistan during the partition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chandigarh.co.uk/history.html |title=Chandigarh History |work=Chandigarh Guide |accessdate=12 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221092038/http://www.chandigarh.co.uk/history.html |archive-date=21 February 2015 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Government Information"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chandigarh.gov.in/knowchd_general.htm |title=About Chandigarh |publisher=Government of Chandigarh |accessdate=12 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110602043256/http://chandigarh.gov.in/knowchd_general.htm |archive-date=2 June 2011 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chandigarh was claimed by both Haryana and Punjab. Pending resolution of the dispute, it was declared as a separate Union Territory which would serve as the capital of both the states.

==Further protest by Akali Dal==
The Akali Dal never accepted the Punjab in its existing form as of today. Akali Dal Opposed the implementation of the Punjab Reorganisation Act on 1 November 1966 and Akali leaders protested against it.&lt;ref name="Tribune_Celebrate"/&gt;

A week after the implementation of the Act, Akali leader Fateh Singh initiated preparations for another long-drawn agitation to have Chandigarh and the Punjabi-speaking areas left in Haryana transferred to Punjab. He also sought seeking the control of [[Bhakra Dam]] and other hydro power projects and headworks. On November 16, 1966, the morcha was re-launched. Fateh started sending Jathas of Akali leaders to the countryside to mobilise support. December 12 was observed as Black Day. In the third week of December, Fateh started [[fast unto death]] at the Akal Takht. He then announced that he would immolate himself on December 27, 1966. The Union government was concerned at this announcement and continued negotiations on the demands. An hour before the scheduled time of 4 pm on December 27 for immolation, Fateh called off his immolation bid.&lt;ref name="Tribune_Celebrate"/&gt;

== Leaders ==

The prominent leaders of the movement included:
* [[Master Tara Singh]]
* [[Fateh Singh (Sikh leader)|Fateh Singh]]

But while the Anglicans have no mechanism for recognizing new saints, the Lutherans from time to time do informally recommend new names (Da Hammarskjold, Dietrick Bonhoeffer, and Pope John XXIII are recent additions) for thanksgiving and remembrance by the faithful.

The English word "''saint''{{-"}} comes from the Latin "''[[sanctus]]''". The word translated in Greek is "ἅγιος" (''hagios''), which means "holy".&lt;ref name="bstsaints"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.biblestudytools.com/dictionaries/bakers-evangelical-dictionary/saints.html | title= Saints – Baker's Evangelical Dictionary of Biblical Theology | publisher= [[Salem Communications]] | work= Biblestudytools.com | accessdate= 19 December 2012}}{{unreliable source?|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{vn|date=July 2016}} The word ἅγιος appears 229 times in the Greek [[New Testament]], and its English translation 60 times in the corresponding text of the [[King James Version]] of the [[Bible]].&lt;ref name="biblepages"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.biblepages.net/gg03.htm | title= What does the word 'saint' mean in the Bible? | accessdate= 19 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729173225/http://www.biblepages.net/gg03.htm |archive-date=29 July 2013}}{{unreliable source?|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the New Testament, "saint" did not denote the deceased who had been recognized as especially holy or emulable, but rather the living faithful who had dedicated themselves to God.&lt;ref name="bstsaints" /&gt;{{vn|date=July 2016}}

The word ''sanctus'' was originally a technical one in [[ancient Roman religion]], but due to its "[[ecumene|globalized]]" use in Christianity the modern word "saint" in English and its equivalent in Romance languages is now also used as a translation of comparable terms for persons "worthy of veneration for their holiness or sanctity" in other religions.

Many religions also use similar concepts (but different terminology) to venerate persons worthy of some honor.&lt;ref name="EoR" /&gt; Author John A. Coleman ([[Society of Jesus]], [[Graduate Theological Union]], [[Berkeley, California]]) wrote that saints across various cultures and religions have the following [[family resemblance]]s:&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, John A.

The [[anthropologist]] Lawrence Babb in an article about [[Sathya Sai Baba]] asks the question "Who is a saint?", and responds by saying that in the symbolic infrastructure of some religions, there is the image of a certain extraordinary spiritual king's "miraculous powers", to whom frequently a certain moral presence is attributed. These saintly figures, he asserts, are "the focal points of spiritual force-fields". They exert "powerful attractive influence on followers but touch the inner lives of others in transforming ways as well".&lt;ref&gt;Babb, Lawrence A.

In his book ''Saint of the Day'', editor Leonard Foley, [[Order of Friars Minor|OFM]] says this: the "[Saints'] surrender to God's love was so generous an approach to the total surrender of [[Jesus]] that the Church recognizes them as heroes and heroines worthy to be held up for our inspiration.

On 3 January 993, [[Pope John XV]] became the first pope to proclaim a person a "saint" from outside the diocese of Rome: on the petition of the German ruler, he had canonized Bishop [[Ulrich of Augsburg]]. Before that time, the popular "cults", or venerations, of saints had been local and spontaneous and were confirmed by the local [[Catholic bishop|bishop]].&lt;ref name="lr12"&gt;Luscombe, David and Riley-Smith, Jonathan. 2004.

The [[veneration]] of saints, in [[Latin]] ''cultus'', or the "cult of the Saints", describes a particular popular devotion or entrustment of one's self to a particular saint or group of saints. Although the term "[[worship]]" is sometimes used, it is only used with the older English connotation of honoring or respecting (''[[dulia]]'') a person. According to the Church, Divine worship is in the strict sense reserved only to God (''[[latria]]'') and never to the Saints.&lt;ref&gt;Scully, Teresita '' [http://www.americancatholic.org/features/customs/rosary/mary_worship.asp Do Catholics Worship Mary?]'' on American Catholic.org&lt;/ref&gt; One is permitted to ask the Saints to intercede or pray to God for persons still on Earth,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic.com/library/Intercession_of_the_Saints.asp The Intercession of the Saints] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619002648/http://www.catholic.com/library/Intercession_of_the_Saints.asp |date=19 June 2009 }} on Catholic.com&lt;/ref&gt; just as one can ask someone on Earth to pray for him.

A saint may be designated as a [[patron saint]] of a particular cause, profession, or locale, or invoked as a protector against specific illnesses or disasters, sometimes by popular custom and sometimes by official declarations of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Patron Saints|Patron Saints]] from Catholic Encyclopedia (1913) on Wikisource.org&lt;/ref&gt; Saints are not believed to have power of their own, but only that granted by God. [[Relics]] of saints are respected, or "venerated", similar to the veneration of holy images and [[icons]]. The practice in past centuries of venerating relics of saints with the intention of obtaining healing from God through their intercession is taken from the early Church.&lt;ref&gt;''Acts of the Apostles'', 19: 11–2&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an American [[deacon]] claimed in 2000 that [[John Henry Newman|Bl. John Henry Cardinal Newman]] interceded with God to cure him of a physical illness. The deacon, Jack Sullivan, asserted that after addressing Newman he was cured of spinal stenosis in a matter of hours. In 2009, a panel of theologians concluded that Sullivan's recovery was the result of his prayer to Newman. According to the Church, to be deemed a miracle, "a medical recovery must be instantaneous, not attributable to treatment, disappear for good."&lt;ref&gt;Jenna Russell, "Marshfield man's prayer an answer in sainthood query", ''The Boston Globe'', 28 April 2009, B1, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a person has been canonized, the deceased body of the saint is considered holy as a [[relic]].&lt;ref name=newadv&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12734a.htm Relics] Catholic Encyclopedia on NewAdvent.org&lt;/ref&gt; The remains of saints are called holy relics and are usually used in churches. Saints' personal belongings may also be used as relics.&lt;ref name=newadv /&gt; Some of the saints have a special [[saint symbology|symbol]] by tradition, e.g., [[Saint Lawrence]], deacon and martyr, is identified by a gridiron because he is believed to have been burned to death on one. This symbol is found, for instance, in the Canadian heraldry of the office responsible for the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]].

====Stages of canonization====
{{Canonization}}
Formal canonization is a lengthy process, often of many years or even centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/saints/index_saints_en.html Table of the Canonizations during the Pontificate of His Holiness John Paul II] on Vatican.va&lt;/ref&gt; The first stage in this process is an investigation of the candidate's life by an expert. After this, the official report on the candidate is submitted to the bishop of the pertinent diocese and more study is undertaken. The information is then sent to the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] of the [[Holy See]] for evaluation at the universal level of the Church.&lt;ref name=how6191 /&gt; If the application is approved the candidate may be granted the title "Venerable".&lt;ref name=how6191&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.howstuffworks.com/question6191.htm|title=The Steps of Canonization|work=HowStuffWorks}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further investigation may lead to the candidate's [[beatification]] with the title "Blessed",&lt;ref name=how6191 /&gt; which is elevation to the class of the ''[[beatification|Beati]]''. Next, and at a minimum, proof of two important miracles obtained from God through the intercession of the candidate are required for formal canonization as a saint. These miracles must be posthumous.&lt;ref name=how6191 /&gt; Finally, after all of these procedures are complete, the [[Pope]] may canonize the candidate as a saint&lt;ref name=how6191 /&gt; for veneration by the universal Church.

=== Eastern Orthodoxy ===
{{further|Glorification}}

In the [[Eastern Orthodox]] Church a saint is defined as anyone who is in [[Heaven]], whether recognized here on earth, or not.&lt;ref name=bebis /&gt; By this definition, [[Adam and Eve]], [[Moses]], the various [[prophet]]s, except for the [[angel]]s and [[archangel]]s are all given the title of "Saint". Sainthood in the Orthodox Church does not necessarily reflect a moral model, but the communion with God: there are countless examples of people who lived in great sin and became saints by humility and repentance, such as [[Mary of Egypt]], [[Moses the Black|Moses the Ethiopian]], and of course [[Saint Dismas|Dysmas]], the repentant thief who was crucified. Therefore, a more complete definition of what a saint is, has to do with the way that saints, through their humility and their love of humankind, saved inside them the entire Church, and loved all people.

Orthodox belief considers that god himself reveals his saints through answered prayers and other miracles.&lt;ref name=bebis /&gt; Saints are usually recognized by a local community, often by people who directly knew them. As their popularity grows they are often then recognized by the entire church. The formal process of recognition involves deliberation by a synod of bishops.&lt;ref name=bebis /&gt; If successful, this is followed by a service of Glorification in which the Saint is given a day on the church calendar to be celebrated by the entire church.&lt;ref&gt;Frawley J ''[http://www.oca.org/FS.NA-Document.asp?ID=83 The Glorification of the Saints in the Orthodox Church]'' at Orthodox Church in America, Syosset, New York&lt;/ref&gt; This does not, however, make the person a saint; the person already was a saint and the Church ultimately recognized it.

It is believed that one of the ways the holiness (sanctity) of a person is revealed, is through the condition of their relics (remains).{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} In some Orthodox countries (such as Greece, but not in Russia) graves are often reused after 3 to 5 years because of limited space. Bones are washed and placed in an [[ossuary]], often with the person's name written on the skull. Occasionally when a body is exhumed something miraculous is reported as having occurred; exhumed bones are claimed to have given off a fragrance, like flowers, or a body is reported as having remained free of decay, despite not having been embalmed (traditionally the Orthodox do not [[embalm]] the dead) and having been buried for some years in the earth.

The reason relics are considered sacred is because, for the Orthodox, the separation of body and soul is unnatural.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Body and soul both comprise the person, and in the end, body and soul will be reunited; therefore, the body of a saint shares in the "Holiness" of the soul of the saint.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} As a general rule only [[clergy]] will touch relics in order to move them or carry them in procession, however, in [[veneration]] the faithful will kiss the relic to show love and respect toward the saint. The [[altar]] in an Orthodox church usually contains relics of saints,&lt;ref&gt;Hopko T "[http://oca.org/orthodoxy/the-orthodox-faith/worship/the-church-building/altar-table The Orthodox Faith]"&lt;/ref&gt; often of [[martyr]]s. Church interiors are covered with the [[Icon]]s of saints.

Because the Church shows no true distinction between the living and the dead (the saints are considered to be alive in Heaven), saints are referred to as if they were still alive. Saints are venerated but not worshipped. They are believed to be able to intercede for salvation and help mankind either through direct communion with God, or by personal intervention.

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the title [[wikt:ὅσιος|Ὅσιος]], ''Hosios'' (f. Ὁσία ''Hosia'') is also used. This is a title attributed to saints who had lived a [[monastery|monastic]] or [[Hermit|eremitic]] life, and it is equal to the more usual title of "Saint".{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

=== Oriental Orthodoxy ===
The [[Oriental Orthodox]] churches ‒ the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]], the [[Orthodox Tewahedo|Tewahedo Church]], the [[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church]], and the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] ‒ follow a canonization process unique to each church. The Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, for example, has the requirement that at least 50 years must pass following a prospective saint's death before the Coptic Orthodox Church's [[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|pope]] can canonize the saint.

=== Anglicanism ===
{{Main|Saints in Anglicanism}}

In the [[Anglican Communion]] and the [[Continuing Anglicanism|Continuing Anglican]] movement, the title of Saint refers to a person who has been elevated by popular opinion as a pious and holy person. The saints are seen as models of holiness to be imitated, and as a 'cloud of witnesses' that strengthen and encourage the believer during his or her spiritual journey ({{bibleverse||Hebrews|12:1|KJV}}). The saints are seen as elder brothers and sisters in Christ. Official Anglican creeds recognise the existence of the saints in heaven.

In [[high-church]] contexts, such as [[Anglo-Catholicism]], a saint is generally one to whom has been attributed (and who has generally demonstrated) a high level of holiness and [[sanctity]]. In this use, a saint is therefore not merely a [[belief|believer]], but one who has been transformed by virtue. In [[Catholicism]], a saint is a special sign of God's activity. The veneration of saints is sometimes misunderstood to be worship, in which case it is derisively termed "hagiolatry".

So far as invocation of the saints is concerned,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eskimo.com/~lhowell/bcp1662/articles/articles.html#22 |title=Article XXII |publisher=Eskimo.com |accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the [[Church of England]]'s [[Thirty-Nine Articles|Articles of Religion]] "Of [[Purgatory]]" condemns "the Romish Doctrine concerning...(the) Invocation of Saints" as "a fond thing vainly invented, and grounded upon no warranty of Scripture, but rather repugnant to the Word of God". Anglo-Catholics in Anglican provinces using the Articles often make a distinction between a "Romish" and a "Patristic" doctrine concerning the invocation of saints, permitting the latter in accordance with Article XXII. Indeed, the theologian E.J. Bicknell, stated that the Anglican view acknowledges that the term "invocation may mean either of two things: the simple request to a saint for his prayers (intercession), 'ora pro nobis,' or a request for some particular benefit. In medieval times the saints had come to be regarded as themselves the authors of blessings. Such a view was condemned but the former was affirmed."&lt;ref name="Sokol2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sokol|first=David F.|title=The Anglican Prayer Life: Ceum Na Corach', the True Way|year=2001|isbn=978-0-595-19171-0|page=14|quote=In 1556 Article XXII in part read... "The Romish doctrine concerning...invocation of saints, is a fond thing vainly invented, and grounded upon no warranty of Scripture, but rather repugnant to the word of God." The term "doctrina Romanensium" or Romish doctrine was substituted for the "doctrina scholasticorum" of the doctrine of the school authors in 1563 to bring the condemnation up to date subsequent to the Council of Trent. As E.J. Bicknell writes, invocation may mean either of two things: the simple request to a saint for his prayers (intercession), 'ora pro nobis,' or a request for some particular benefit. In medieval times the saints had come to be regarded as themselves the authors of blessings. Such a view was condemned but the former was affirmed.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Anglicans and Anglican churches, particularly Anglo-Catholics, personally ask prayers of the saints. However, such a practice is seldom found in any official Anglican liturgy. Unusual examples of it are found in The Korean Liturgy 1938, the liturgy of the Diocese of Guiana 1959 and The Melanesian English Prayer Book.

Anglicans believe that the only effective Mediator between the believer and God the Father, in terms of redemption and salvation, is God the Son, [[Jesus]] [[Christ]]. Historical Anglicanism has drawn a distinction between the intercession of the saints and the invocation of the saints. The former was generally accepted in Anglican doctrine, while the latter was generally rejected."&lt;ref name="Sokol2001" /&gt; There are some, however, in Anglicanism, who do beseech the saints' intercession. Those who beseech the saints to intercede on their behalf make a distinction between "mediator" and "intercessor", and claim that asking for the prayers of the saints is no different in kind than asking for the prayers of living Christians. [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglican Catholics]] understand sainthood in a more [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] or [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]] way, often praying for intercessions from the saints and celebrating their feast days.

According to the [[Church of England]], a saint is one who is sanctified, as it translates in the Authorised King James Version (1611) [[2 Chronicles]] 6:41 &lt;blockquote&gt;
Now therefore arise, O {{LORD}} God, into thy resting place, thou, and the ark of thy strength: let thy priests, O {{LORD}} God, be clothed with salvation, and let thy saints rejoice in goodness.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Lutheranism ===
{{further|Calendar of Saints (Lutheran)|Liturgical calendar (Lutheran)}}

In the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran Church]], all Christians, whether in heaven or on earth, are regarded as saints. However, the church still recognizes and honors specific saints, including some of those recognized by the Catholic Church, but in a qualified way: according to the [[Augsburg Confession]],&lt;ref&gt;A Confession of Faith Presented in Augsburg by certain Princes and Cities to His Imperial Majesty Charles V in the Year 1530&lt;/ref&gt; the term "saint" is used in the manner of the Catholic Church only insofar as to denote a person who received exceptional grace, was sustained by faith, and whose good works are to be an example to any Christian. Traditional Lutheran belief accounts that prayers ''to'' the saints are prohibited, as they are not mediators of redemption.&lt;ref&gt;[[Apology of the Augsburg Confession]] XXI 14–30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Smalcald Articles]]-II 25&lt;/ref&gt; But, Lutherans do believe that saints pray for the Christian Church in general.&lt;ref&gt;[[Apology of the Augsburg Confession]] XXI 9&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip Melanchthon]], the author of the Apology of the Augsburg Confession, approved honoring the saints by saying they are honored in three ways:
:1. By thanking God for examples of His mercy;
:2. By using the saints as examples for strengthening our faith; and
:3. By imitating their faith and other virtues.&lt;ref&gt;[[Apology of the Augsburg Confession]] XXI 4–7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyclopedia.lcms.org/display.asp?t1=s&amp;word=SAINTS.VENERATIONOF|title=Lutheran Church – Missouri Synod – Christian Cyclopedia|work=lcms.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Augsburg Confession]] XXI 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lutheran Churches also have [[Calendar of Saints (Lutheran)|liturgical calendars]] in which they honor individuals as saints.

=== Methodism ===
{{further|Saints in Methodism}}

While Methodists as a whole do not practice the [[patronage]] or [[veneration]] of saints, they do honor and admire them. Methodists believe that all Christians are ''saints'', but mainly use the term to refer to biblical people, Christian leaders, and martyrs of the faith. Many Methodist churches are named after saints, such as the [[Twelve Apostles]], [[John Wesley]], etc. Although, most are named after geographical locations associated with an early circuit or prominent location. Some Methodist congregations observe [[All Saints Day]] if they follow the liturgical calendar. Many encourage the study of saints, that is, the biography of holy people.

The 14th Article of Religion in the United Methodist Discipline states,
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Romish doctrine concerning purgatory, pardon, worshiping, and adoration, as well of images as of relics, and also invocation of saints, is a fond thing, vainly invented, and grounded upon no warrant of Scripture, but repugnant to the Word of God.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

John Wesley, the theological father of world Methodism, did not practice or permit Catholic practices associated with the veneration of the Virgin Mary or prayers to saints.

In many [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches, the word "saint" is used more generally to refer to anyone who is a [[Christian]]. This is similar in usage to [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]]'s numerous references in the New Testament of the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/manual/new-testament-gospel-doctrine-teachers-manual/lesson-36-beloved-of-god-called-to-be-saints "Beloved of God, Called to Be Saints"], ''New Testament Gospel Doctrine Teacher's Manual''. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Salt Lake City, Utah. p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, anyone who is within the [[Body of Christ]] (i.e., a professing Christian) is a 'saint' because of their relationship with Christ Jesus. Many Protestants consider [[Intercession of saints|intercessory prayers to the saints]] to be [[idolatry]] as an application of divine worship that should be given only to God himself is being given to other believers, dead or alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philvaz.com/apologetics/p38.htm |title=The Sin of Idolatry and the Catholic Concept of Iconic Participation |publisher=Philvaz.com |accessdate=25 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Protestant sects also consider the practice to be similar to [[necromancy]] as the dead are believed to be awaiting resurrection, unable to do anything for the living saint. {{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Within some Protestant traditions, "saint" is also used to refer to any [[born again Christianity|born-again Christian]]. Many emphasize the traditional [[New Testament]] meaning of the word, preferring to write "saint" to refer to any believer, in continuity with the doctrine of the [[priesthood of all believers]].

=== Latter-day Saints ===
The beliefs within [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) with regard to saints are similar but not quite the same as the Protestant tradition. In the New Testament, saints are all those who have entered into the Christian covenant of baptism. The qualification "latter-day" refers to the doctrine that members are living in the "latter days", before the [[Second Coming of Christ]], and is used to distinguish the members of the LDS Church, which considers itself the restoration of the ancient Christian church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Smith |first= Joseph Jr |authorlink= Joseph Smith Jr |title= Pearl of Great Price |url= http://lds.org/library/display/0,4945,106-1-2-1,FF.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members are therefore often referred to as "[[Latter-day Saints]]" or "LDS", and among themselves as "saints".&lt;ref&gt;M. Russell Ballard, [http://www.lds.org/general-conference/2007/10/faith-family-facts-and-fruits?lang=eng "Faith, Family, Facts, and Fruits"], ''Ensign'', Nov 2007, 25–27&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other religions ==
The use of the term "saint" is not exclusive to Christianity. In many religions, there are people who have been recognized within their tradition as having fulfilled the highest aspirations of religious teaching. In English, the term saint is often used to translate this idea from many [[world religions]]. The Jewish ''hasid'' or ''tsaddiq'', the Islamic ''Mu'min'', the Zoroastrian ''fravashi'', the Hindu ''rsi'' or ''guru,'' the Buddhist ''arahant'' or ''bodhisattva,'' the Daoist ''shengren,'' the Shinto ''kami'' and others have all been referred to as saints."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Thomson Gale Encyclopedia of Religion|editor=Lindsay Jones|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA|date=2005|edition=Second|volume=Sainthood|page=8033|language=TG}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== African diaspora ===
{{See also|Afro-American religion}}

Cuban [[Santería]], [[Haitian Vodou]], [[Trinidad Orisha|Trinidad Orisha-Shango]], Brazilian [[Umbanda]], [[Candomblé]], and other similar [[syncretism|syncretist]] religions adopted the Catholic saints, or at least the images of the saints, and applied their own spirits/deities to them. They are worshiped in churches (where they appear as saints) and in religious festivals, where they appear as the [[deity|deities]]. The name ''santería'' was originally a pejorative term for those whose worship of saints deviated from Catholic norms.

=== Buddhism ===
{{See also|Buddha|Bodhisattva}}

Buddhists in both the [[Theravada]] and [[Mahayana]] traditions hold the ''[[Arhat]]s'' in special esteem, as well as Bodhisattvas, other Buddhas, or eminent members of the ''[[Sangha]]''. [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhists]] hold the ''[[tulku]]s'' (reincarnates of deceased eminent practitioners) as living saints on earth.

=== Hinduism ===
{{Main|Hindu saints}}

Hindu saints are those recognized by [[Hindu]]s as showing a great degree of holiness and sanctity. Hinduism has a long tradition of stories and poetry about saints. There is no formal [[canonization]] process in Hinduism, but over time, many men and women have reached the status of saints among their followers and among Hindus in general (unlike in Christianity, Hinduism does not canonize people as saints after death, but they can be accepted as saints during their lifetime).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Essentials of Hinduism|last = Bhaskarananda|first = Swami|publisher = The Vedanta Society of Western Washington|year = 2002|isbn = 1-884852-04-1|location = Seattle|pages = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu saints have often renounced the world, and are variously called [[guru]]s, [[sadhu]]s, [[rishi]]s, [[devarishi]]s, [[rajarshi]]s, [[saptarishi]]s, [[brahmarshi]]s, [[swami]]s, [[Pandit|pundits]], [[purohit]]s, [[pujari]]s, [[Acharya|acharyas]], [[pravaras]], [[yogi]]s, [[yogini]]s, and other names.&lt;ref name="Rinehart2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robin Rinehart|title=Contemporary Hinduism: Ritual, Culture, and Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hMPYnfS_R90C&amp;pg=PA88|accessdate=3 June 2013|date=1 January 2004|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-905-8|pages=87–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Hindu saints are given god-like status, being seen as [[Avatar|incarnations]] of [[Vishnu]], [[Shiva]], [[Devi]] and other aspects of the Divine—this can happen during their lifetimes, or sometimes many years after their deaths. This explains another common name for Hindu saints: godmen.&lt;ref name="Woodward2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kenneth L. Woodward|title=The Book of Miracles: The Meaning of the Miracle Stories in Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism and Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e951hHwu3X0C&amp;pg=PA267|accessdate=3 June 2013|date=10 July 2001|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=978-0-7432-0029-5|page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islam ===
{{Main|Wali}}

[[Islam]] has had a rich history of veneration of saints (often called ''[[wali]]'', which literally means "Friend [of God]"),&lt;ref name="See John Renard 2008"&gt;See John Renard, ''Friends of God: Islamic Images of Piety, Commitment, and Servanthood'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2008); Idem., ''Tales of God Friends: Islamic Hagiography in Translation'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; which has declined in some parts of the Islamic world in the twentieth century due to the influence of the various streams of [[Salafism]]. In [[Sunni Islam]], the veneration of saints became a very common form of devotion early on,&lt;ref name="See John Renard 2008"/&gt; and saints came to be defined in the eighth-century as a group of "special people chosen by God and endowed with exceptional gifts, such as the ability to work miracles."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Radtke, B., "Saint", in: Encyclopaedia of the Qurʾān, General Editor: Jane Dammen McAuliffe, Georgetown University, Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt; The classical Sunni scholars came to recognize and honor these individuals as venerable people who were both "loved by God and developed a close relationship of love to Him."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; "Belief in the miracles of saints (''karāmāt al-awliyāʾ'') ... [became a] requirement in Sunni Islam [during the classical period],"&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan A.C. Brown, "Faithful Dissenters: Sunni Skepticism about the Miracles of Saints," ''Journal of Sufi Studies'' 1 (2012), p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; with even medieval critics of the ubiquitous practice of [[ziyara|grave visitation]] like [[Ibn Taymiyyah]] emphatically declaring: "The miracles of saints are absolutely true and correct, and acknowledged by all Muslim scholars. The [[Quran]] has pointed to it in different places, and the [[hadith|sayings of the Prophet]] have mentioned it, and whoever denies the miraculous power of saints are innovators or following innovators."&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Taymiyyah, ''Mukhtasar al-Fatawa al-Masriyya'' (al-Madani Publishing House, 1980), p. 603&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of saints venerated in the classical Sunni world were the [[Sufi]]s, who were all Sunni mystics who belonged to one of the [[maddhab|four orthodox legal schools of Sunni law]].&lt;ref&gt;John Renard, ''Friends of God: Islamic Images of Piety, Commitment, and Servanthood'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Veneration of saints eventually became one of the most widespread Sunni practices for more than a millennium, before it was opposed in the twentieth century by the [[Salafi movement]], whose various streams regard it as "being both un-Islamic and backwards ... rather than the integral part of Islam which they were for over a millennium."&lt;ref&gt;Juan Eduardo Campo, ''Encyclopedia of Islam'' (New York: Infobase Publishing, 2009), p. 600&lt;/ref&gt;  In a manner similar to the [[Protestant Reformation]],&lt;ref&gt;See Jonathan A.C. Brown, ''Misquoting Muhammad'' (London: Oneworld Publications, 2015), p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; the specific traditional practices which [[Salafism]] has tried to curtail in both [[Sunni]] and [[Shia]] contexts include those of [[wali|the veneration of saints]], [[ziyara|visiting their graves]], [[tawassul|seeking their intercession]], and [[relics|honoring their relics]]. As Christopher Taylor has remarked: "[Throughout Islamic history] a vital dimension of Islamic piety was the veneration of Muslim saints…. [due, however to] certain strains of thought within the Islamic tradition itself, particularly pronounced in the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries ... [some modern day] Muslims have either resisted acknowledging the existence of Muslim saints altogether or have viewed their presence and veneration as unacceptable deviations."&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Taylor, ''In the Vicinity of the Righteous'' (Leiden: Brill, 1999), pp. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Judaism ===
{{Main|Tzadik}}

The term ''Tzadik'' ("righteous"), and its associated meanings, developed in [[Rabbinic literature|rabbinic thought]] from its [[Talmud]]ic contrast with ''[[Hasid (term)|Hasid]]'' ("pious"), to its exploration in [[Musar literature|ethical literature]], and its esoteric spiritualisation in [[Kabbalah]]. In [[Hasidic Judaism]], the institution of the Tzadik assumed central importance, combining former elite mysticism with social movement for the first time.

=== Sikhism ===
{{See also|Sant (religion)}}
The concept of ''[[Sant Mat|sant]]'' or ''[[bhagat]]'' is found in North Indian religious thought including [[Sikhism]], most notably in the [[Sri Guru Granth Sahib]]. Figures such as [[Kabir]], [[Ravidas]], [[Namdev]], and others are known as "Sants" or "Bhagats". The term ''Sant'' is applied in the Sikh and related communities to beings that have attained enlightenment through God realization and spiritual union with God via repeatedly reciting the name of God ([[Naam Japo]]). Countless names of God exist, in Sikhism, ''Naam'' (spiritual internalization of God's name) is commonly attained through the name of [[Waheguru]], which translates to "Wondrous Guru". 

Sikhs are encouraged to follow the congregation of a Sant (Sadh Sangat) or "The Company of the Holy". ''Sants'' grace the Sadh Sangat with knowledge of the Divine God, and how to take greater steps towards obtaining spiritual enlightenment through ''Naam''. ''Sants'' are to be distinguished from "Guru" (such as [[Guru Nanak]]) who have compiled the path to God enlightenment in the Sri Guru Granth Sahib. Gurus are the physical incarnation of God upon Earth. Sikhism states however, that any beings that have become one with God are considered synonymous with God. As such, the fully realized Sant, Guru, and God are considered one. &lt;ref name=Khalsa&gt;{{cite book | title=Sri Guru Granth Sahib: English Translation of Sri Guru Granth Sahib | publisher=Hand Made Books (Mandeep Singh) | author=Khalsa, Sant Singh  | year=2007 | location=Arizona | page=12-263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Schwan-STABILO''' is a German maker of pens for writing, colouring and cosmetics as well as markers and highlighters for office use.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110711085631/http://www.intercharm.german-pavilion.com/content/english/exhibitors/exhibitors_result.php?exhibitor_id=14900 Schwan-Stabilo Cosmetics GmbH &amp; Co. KG]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the world's largest manufacturer of [[highlighter|highlighter pens]], Stabilo Boss.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eppi-magazine.com/modules/wfsection/article.php?articleid=56 Schwan STABILO: 150 Years]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The company was founded as Grossberger &amp; Kurz Bleistiftfabrik (pencil company) in [[Nuremberg]] in 1855 alongside other pencil manufacturers such as [[Staedtler]] and [[Faber-Castell]], because the area is surrounded by graphite and clay mines. It was acquired by the Schwanhäusser family in 1865. Taking the first part from the family name, the company was renamed Schwan Bleistift Fabrik and started using the swan logo as one of the earliest trademarks. In 1909 the Dermatograph cosmetic pen was created which was primarily used by surgeons for marking skin. During the [[Great Depression]], Schwan had three brands: Stabilo premium pencils for the most demanding users, Othello pencils for mass markets and Swano non-toxic pencils for children.

The company rebranded itself from Schwan Bleistift Fabrik to Schwan-Stabilo in 1976 in honour of the Schwanhäußer family. In 1992, Schwan-Stabilo split into two separate companies: Schwan-STABILO Cosmetics and Schwan-STABILO (writing instruments)
&lt;!-- It did NOT change its name, or any of the names of its divisions, for that matter. The previous version is very inaccurate per the company's own website information (see http://www.stabilo.com/pages-de/hr/unternehmen_struktur.php). A visibility problem as to this fact does exist on the international (English) version of same website though, where the facts seem to be represented with respect to public accessibility rather than legal accuracy. See http://www.schwan-stabilo.com/gb/unternehmen/struktur.php as opposed to http://www.schwan-stabilo.com/unternehmen/struktur.php . --&gt;

The company headquarters is in [[Heroldsberg]], Germany, and has three production subsidiaries: 
* [[Weißenburg in Bayern]], [[Germany]], where the highlighter is manufactured, incorporated in 1986
* [[Johor Bahru]], [[Malaysia]], where the ballpoint pen is manufactured, incorporated in 1976 as Swan Malaysia
* [[Český Krumlov]], [[Czech Republic]], where the wood based pencil is manufactured, incorporated in 1992

In [[martial arts]] and [[combat sport]]s, '''stand-up fighting''' is [[hand-to-hand combat]] between opponents in a standing position, as distinguished from [[ground fighting]]. [[Clinch fighting]] is stand-up [[grappling]]. Fighters employ [[Strike (attack)|striking]], including [[striking combination]]s, using either body parts or [[mêlée weapon]]s, to incapacitate or [[injure]] the opponent. Combatants use [[blocking technique]]s to block the opponent's attacks. 

Martial arts and combat sports that emphasize stand-up fighting include [[boxing]] (including [[bare-knuckle boxing]]), [[jōdō]], [[karate]], [[kendo]], [[kickboxing]], [[kung fu]] ([[Sanshou|sanda/sanshou]]), [[Muay Thai]], [[savate]],  [[silat]], and [[Taekwondo]].

The nature of the stand-up fighting depends on whether the combatants are unarmed or use [[mêlée weapon]]s.  Batons become less effective at short, especially [[clinching position|clinching]] range, where they cannot be swung properly. Knives on the other hand do not need as much thrusting space to generate damage. In stand-up fighting without [[mêlée weapon]]s, it is possible to separate the distances between the combatants according to which [[strike (attack)|strikes]] can reach the opponent.

[[File:Female MMA fighters.jpg|thumb|left|150px|'''Comfort Zone''': Fighters out of range of striking one another]]
'''Comfort zone''': The comfort zone is a non-combat distance from which it is not possible to [[kick]] the opponent without [[closing the distance]] considerably. From this zone the combatant might carefully close in on the opponent to engage with [[strike (attack)|strikes]].

[[File:USMC-04928.jpg|thumb|right|150px|'''Kicking Distance''': Fighters in kicking distance]]
'''Kicking distance''': The kicking distance is the most distant unarmed fighting position in which consistent contact can be made with the opponent. The combatants can use far-reaching quick kicks to the legs, body or head of the opponent. Martial arts such as [[Taekwondo]], emphasize the kicking distance in fighting.

[[File:Toner-Carillo fight 2.JPG|thumb|left|150px|'''Punching Distance''': Fighters in punching distance]]
'''Punching distance''': The punching distance refers to the zone where [[punch (strike)|punches]] can be thrown, and this is the distance from the furthest [[jab]] to the closest [[Hook (boxing)|hook]], as long as no [[grappling]] is taking place. In addition to punches, this distance often also allows for [[elbow (strike)|elbows]] and [[knee (strike)|knees]]. [[Boxing]] is a [[combat sport]] that concerns itself exclusively with the punching distance. However many martial arts, particularly those that employ extreme close range fighting (for example [[Wing Chun]] and [[Southern Praying Mantis]]) train ranges within punch range, but do not necessarily employ clinching techniques. This collection of ranges is often called the in-fighting range.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nononsenseselfdefense.com/distance.html Defensive Tactics: Distance&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Muay thai knee clinch 2.jpg|thumb|right|150px|'''Clinching Zone''': Fighters in a muay thai clinch]]
'''Clinching zone''': The clinching or trapping zone refers to the same distance as the punching distance, except that one or both combatants [[grappling|grapple]], and at the same time prevent the other from moving into a more distant contact zone or into the comfort zone by using a [[grappling hold#Clinch hold|clinch hold]]. This zone involves a multitude of both [[strike (attack)|striking]] and [[grappling]] techniques, and is discussed in its own article [[clinch fighting]].

[[File:0321 DNA Macrostructure.jpg|thumb|150px|Strings are applied e.g. in [[Bioinformatics]] to describe [[DNA]] strands composed of [[nitrogenous base]]s.]]
In [[computer programming]], a '''string''' is traditionally a [[sequence]] of [[Character (computing)|characters]], either as a [[literal (computer programming)|literal constant]] or as some kind of variable. The latter may allow its elements to be mutated and the length changed, or it may be fixed (after creation). A string is generally considered a [[data type]] and is often implemented as an [[array data structure]] of [[byte]]s (or [[word (computer architecture)|word]]s) that stores a sequence of elements, typically characters, using some [[character encoding]]. ''String'' may also denote more general [[Array data type|arrays]] or other sequence (or [[List (abstract data type)|list]]) data types and structures.

Depending on programming language and precise data type used, a [[variable (programming)|variable]] declared to be a string may either cause storage in memory to be statically allocated for a predetermined maximum length or employ [[dynamic allocation]] to allow it to hold a variable number of elements.

When a string appears literally in [[source code]], it is known as a [[string literal]] or an anonymous string.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~fineberg/mfc158/week10lecture.htm|title=Introduction To Java - MFC 158 G|quote=String literals (or constants) are called ‘anonymous strings’|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303233357/http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~fineberg/mfc158/week10lecture.htm|archivedate=2016-03-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[formal language]]s, which are used in [[mathematical logic]] and [[theoretical computer science]], a string is a finite sequence of [[symbol (formal)|symbol]]s that are chosen from a [[set (mathematics)|set]] called an [[alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]].

== Formal theory ==
{{See also|Tuple}}

Let Σ be a [[empty set|non-empty]] [[finite set]] of symbols (alternatively called characters), called the [[Alphabet (formal languages)|alphabet]]. No assumption is made about the nature of the symbols. A '''string''' (or '''word''') over Σ is any finite [[sequence]] of symbols from Σ.&lt;ref name="partee"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Barbara H. Partee |author2=Alice ter Meulen |author3=Robert E. Wall |title=Mathematical Methods in Linguistics |publisher=Kluwer |year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if Σ = {0,&amp;nbsp;1}, then ''01011'' is a string over Σ.

The ''[[length]]'' of a string ''s'' is the number of symbols in ''s'' (the length of the sequence) and can be any [[non-negative integer]]; it is often denoted as |''s''|.  The ''[[empty string]]'' is the unique string over Σ of length 0, and is denoted ''ε'' or ''λ''.&lt;ref name="partee"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=John E. Hopcroft, Jeffrey D. Ullman| title=Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation| year=1979| publisher=Addison-Wesley| isbn=0-201-02988-X}} Here: sect.1.1, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

The set of all strings over Σ of length ''n'' is denoted Σ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.  For example, if Σ = {0, 1}, then Σ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = {00, 01, 10, 11}.  Note that Σ&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = {ε} for any alphabet Σ.

The set of all strings over Σ of any length is the [[Kleene star|Kleene closure]] of Σ and is denoted Σ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;.  In terms of Σ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\Sigma^{*} = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{0\}} \Sigma^{n}&lt;/math&gt;
For example, if Σ = {0, 1}, then Σ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; = {ε, 0, 1, 00, 01, 10, 11, 000, 001, 010, 011, ...}.  Although the set Σ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; itself is [[countably infinite]], each element of Σ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; is a string of finite length.

A set of strings over Σ (i.e. any [[subset]] of Σ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;) is called a ''formal language'' over Σ.  For example, if Σ = {0, 1}, the set of strings with an even number of zeros, {ε, 1, 00, 11, 001, 010, 100, 111, 0000, 0011, 0101, 0110, 1001, 1010, 1100, 1111, ...}, is a formal language over Σ.

=== Concatenation and substrings ===
''[[Concatenation]]'' is an important [[binary operation]] on Σ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;.  For any two strings ''s'' and ''t'' in Σ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, their concatenation is defined as the sequence of symbols in ''s'' followed by the sequence of characters in ''t'', and is denoted ''st''.  For example, if Σ = {a, b, ..., z}, ''s'' = &lt;tt&gt;bear&lt;/tt&gt;, and ''t'' = &lt;tt&gt;hug&lt;/tt&gt;, then ''st'' = &lt;tt&gt;bearhug&lt;/tt&gt; and ''ts'' = &lt;tt&gt;hugbear&lt;/tt&gt;.

String concatenation is an [[associative]], but non-[[commutative]] operation. The empty string ε serves as the [[identity element]]; for any string ''s'', ε''s'' = ''s''ε = ''s''.  Therefore, the set Σ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; and the concatenation operation form a [[monoid]], the [[free monoid]] generated by Σ.  In addition, the length function defines a [[monoid homomorphism]] from Σ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; to the non-negative integers (that is, a function &lt;math&gt;L: \Sigma^{*} \mapsto \mathbb{N} \cup \{0\}&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;L(st)=L(s)+L(t)\quad \forall s,t\in\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt;).

A string ''s'' is said to be a ''[[substring]]'' or ''factor'' of ''t'' if there exist (possibly empty) strings ''u'' and ''v'' such that ''t'' = ''usv''.  The [[binary relation|relation]] "is a substring of" defines a [[partial order]] on Σ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, the [[least element]] of which is the empty string.

=== Prefixes and suffixes ===
A string ''s'' is said to be a [[Substring#Prefix|prefix]] of ''t'' if there exists a string ''u'' such that ''t'' = ''su''. If ''u'' is nonempty, ''s'' is said to be a ''proper'' prefix of ''t''. Symmetrically, a string ''s'' is said to be a [[Substring#Suffix|suffix]] of ''t'' if there exists a string ''u'' such that ''t'' = ''us''. If ''u'' is nonempty, ''s'' is said to be a ''proper'' suffix of ''t''. Suffixes and prefixes are substrings of ''t''. Both the relations "is a prefix of" and "is a suffix of" are [[prefix order]]s.

=== Rotations ===
A string ''s'' = ''uv'' is said to be a rotation of ''t'' if ''t'' = ''vu''. For example, if Σ = {0, 1} the string 0011001 is a rotation of 0100110, where u = 00110 and v = 01.

=== Reversal ===
The reverse of a string is a string with the same symbols but in reverse order. For example, if ''s'' = abc (where a, b, and c are symbols of the alphabet), then the reverse of ''s'' is cba. A string that is the reverse of itself (e.g., ''s'' = madam) is called a [[palindrome#Computation theory|palindrome]], which also includes the empty string and all strings of length 1.

=== Lexicographical ordering ===
It is often useful to define an [[order theory|ordering]] on a set of strings. If the alphabet Σ has a [[total order]] (cf. [[alphabetical order]]) one can define a total order on Σ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; called [[lexicographical order]]. For example, if Σ = {0, 1} and 0 &lt; 1, then the lexicographical order on Σ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; includes the relationships ε &lt; 0 &lt; 00 &lt; 000 &lt; ... &lt; 0001 &lt; 001 &lt; 01 &lt; 010 &lt; 011 &lt; 0110 &lt; 01111 &lt; 1 &lt; 10 &lt; 100 &lt; 101 &lt; 111 &lt; 1111 &lt; 11111 ... The lexicographical order is [[total order|total]] if the alphabetical order is, but isn't [[well-founded]] for any nontrivial alphabet, even if the alphabetical order is.

See [[Shortlex]] for an alternative string ordering that preserves well-foundedness.

=== String operations ===
A number of additional operations on strings commonly occur in the formal theory. These are given in the article on [[string operations]].

=== Topology ===
[[File:Hamming distance 3 bit binary.svg|thumb|150px|(Hyper)cube of binary strings of length 3]]
Strings admit the following interpretation as nodes on a graph:
* Fixed-length strings can be viewed as nodes on a [[hypercube]]
* Variable-length strings (of finite length) can be viewed as nodes on the [[k-ary tree|''k''-ary tree]], where ''k'' is the number of symbols in Σ
* [[Infinite string]]s (otherwise not considered here) can be viewed as infinite paths on the ''[[K-ary tree|k]]''[[K-ary tree|-ary tree]].

The natural topology on the set of fixed-length strings or variable-length strings is the discrete topology, but the natural topology on the set of infinite strings is the [[limit topology]], viewing the set of infinite strings as the [[inverse limit]] of the sets of finite strings. This is the construction used for the [[p-adic|''p''-adic numbers]] and some constructions of the [[Cantor set]], and yields the same topology.

[[Isomorphism]]s between string representations of topologies can be found by normalizing according to the [[lexicographically minimal string rotation]].

== String datatypes ==
{{See also|Comparison of programming languages (string functions)}}

A '''string datatype''' is a datatype modeled on the idea of a formal string. Strings are such an important and useful datatype that they are implemented in nearly every [[programming language]]. In some languages they are available as [[primitive type]]s and in others as [[composite type]]s. The [[syntax]] of most high-level programming languages allows for a string, usually quoted in some way, to represent an instance of a string datatype; such a meta-string is called a ''literal'' or ''string literal''.

=== String length ===
Although formal strings can have an arbitrary but finite length, the length of strings in real languages is often constrained to an artificial maximum. In general, there are two types of string datatypes: ''fixed-length strings'', which have a fixed maximum length to be determined at compile time and which use the same amount of memory whether this maximum is needed or not, and ''variable-length strings'', whose length is not arbitrarily fixed and which can use varying amounts of memory depending on the actual requirements at [[Memory management|run time]]. Most strings in modern [[programming languages]] are variable-length strings. Of course, even variable-length strings are limited in length – by the number of bits available to a pointer, and by the size of available [[computer memory]]. The string length can be stored as a separate integer (which may put an artificial limit on the length) or implicitly through a termination character, usually a character value with all bits zero such as in C programming language. See also "[[#Null-terminated|Null-terminated]]" below.

=== Character encoding ===
String datatypes have historically allocated one byte per character, and, although the exact character set varied by region, character encodings were similar enough that programmers could often get away with ignoring this, since characters a program treated specially (such as period and space and comma) were in the same place in all the encodings a program would encounter. These character sets were typically based on [[ASCII]] or [[EBCDIC]]. If text in one encoding was displayed on a system using a different encoding, text was often [[mojibake|mangled]], though often somewhat readable and some computer users learned to read the mangled text.

[[Logograph]]ic languages such as [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and [[Korean language|Korean]] (known collectively as [[CJK]]) need far more than 256 characters (the limit of a one 8-bit byte per-character encoding) for reasonable representation. The normal solutions involved keeping single-byte representations for ASCII and using two-byte representations for CJK [[ideographs]]. Use of these with existing code led to problems with matching and cutting of strings, the severity of which depended on how the character encoding was designed. Some encodings such as the [[Extended Unix Code|EUC]] family guarantee that a byte value in the ASCII range will represent only that ASCII character, making the encoding safe for systems that use those characters as field separators. Other encodings such as [[ISO-2022]] and [[Shift-JIS]] do not make such guarantees, making matching on byte codes unsafe. These encodings also were not "self-synchronizing", so that locating character boundaries required backing up to the start of a string, and pasting two strings together could result in corruption of the second string.

[[Unicode]] has simplified the picture somewhat. Most programming languages now have a datatype for Unicode strings. Unicode's preferred byte stream format [[UTF-8]] is designed not to have the problems described above for older multibyte encodings. UTF-8, UTF-16 and [[UTF-32]] require the programmer to know that the fixed-size code units are different than the "characters", the main difficulty currently is incorrectly designed APIs that attempt to hide this difference (UTF-32 does make ''code points'' fixed-sized, but these are not "characters" due to composing codes).

=== Implementations ===
Some languages like [[C++]] implement strings as [[generic programming|templates]] that can be used with any datatype, but this is the exception, not the rule.

Some languages, such as C++ and [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], normally allow the contents of a string to be changed after it has been created; these are termed ''mutable'' strings.  In other languages, such as [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]], the value is fixed and a new string must be created if any alteration is to be made; these are termed ''immutable'' strings.

Strings are typically implemented as [[Array data type|arrays]] of bytes, characters, or code units, in order to allow fast access to individual units or substrings—including characters when they have a fixed length.  A few languages such as [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] implement them as [[linked list]]s instead.

Some languages, such as [[Prolog]] and [[Erlang (programming language)|Erlang]], avoid implementing a dedicated string datatype at all, instead adopting the convention of representing strings as lists of character codes.

=== Representations ===
Representations of strings depend heavily on the choice of character repertoire and the method of character encoding. Older string implementations were designed to work with repertoire and encoding defined by ASCII, or more recent extensions like the [[ISO 8859]] series. Modern implementations often use the extensive repertoire defined by Unicode along with a variety of complex encodings such as UTF-8 and UTF-16.

The term ''byte string'' usually indicates a general-purpose string of bytes, rather than strings of only (readable) characters, strings of bits, or such. Byte strings often imply that bytes can take any value and any data can be stored as-is, meaning that there should be no value interpreted as a termination value.

Most string implementations are very similar to variable-length [[Array data type|array]]s with the entries storing the [[character code]]s of corresponding characters. The principal difference is that, with certain encodings, a single logical character may take up more than one entry in the array. This happens for example with UTF-8, where single codes ([[Universal Character Set|UCS]] code points) can take anywhere from one to four bytes, and single characters can take an arbitrary number of codes. In these cases, the logical length of the string (number of characters) differs from the physical length of the array (number of bytes in use). [[UTF-32]] avoids the first part of the problem.

==== Null-terminated ====
{{main|Null-terminated string}}

The length of a string can be stored implicitly by using a special terminating character; often this is the [[null character]] (NUL), which has all bits zero, a convention used and perpetuated by the popular [[C (programming language)|C programming language]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, this representation is commonly referred to as a '''C string'''. This representation of an ''n''-character string takes ''n'' + 1 space (1 for the terminator), and is thus an [[implicit data structure]].

In terminated strings, the terminating code is not an allowable character in any string. Strings with ''length'' field do not have this limitation and can also store arbitrary [[binary data]].

An example of a ''null-terminated string'' stored in a 10-byte [[Buffer (computer science)|buffer]], along with its [[ASCII]] (or more modern [[UTF-8]]) representation as 8-bit [[hexadecimal number]]s is:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto"
 |-
 | &lt;code&gt;F&lt;/code&gt;  || &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt;  || &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;  || &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt;  || &lt;code&gt;K&lt;/code&gt;
 | &lt;small&gt;[[Null character|NUL]]&lt;/small&gt;
 | style="background: #DDD" | &lt;code style="background: #DDD"&gt;k&lt;/code&gt;
 | style="background: #DDD" | &lt;code style="background: #DDD"&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;
 | style="background: #DDD" | &lt;code style="background: #DDD"&gt;f&lt;/code&gt;
 | style="background: #DDD" | &lt;code style="background: #DDD"&gt;w&lt;/code&gt;
 |-
 | 46&lt;sub&gt;[[Hexadecimal#Using 0–9 and A–F|16]]&lt;/sub&gt; || 52&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; || 41&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; || 4E&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; || 4B&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;
 | 00&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;
 | style="background: #DDD" | 6B&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;
 | style="background: #DDD" | 65&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;
 | style="background: #DDD" | 66&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;
 | style="background: #DDD" | 77&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;
 |}

The length of the string in the above example, "&lt;code&gt;FRANK&lt;/code&gt;", is 5 characters, but it occupies 6 bytes. Characters after the terminator do not form part of the representation; they may be either part of other data or just garbage. (Strings of this form are sometimes called ''ASCIZ strings'', after the original [[assembly language]] directive used to declare them.)

==== Byte- and bit-terminated ====
Using a special byte other than null for terminating strings has historically appeared in both hardware and software, though sometimes with a value that was also a printing character. &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; was used by many assembler systems, &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt; used by [[Control Data Corporation|CDC]] systems (this character had a value of zero), and the [[ZX80]] used &lt;code&gt;"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref name=asm&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wearmouth |first1=Geoff |title=An Assembly Listing of the ROM of the Sinclair ZX80 |url=http://www.wearmouth.demon.co.uk/zx80.htm |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150815035611/http://www.wearmouth.demon.co.uk/zx80.htm |archivedate=August 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; since this was the string delimiter in its BASIC language.

Somewhat similar, "data processing" machines like the [[IBM 1401]] used a special [[Word mark (computer hardware)|word mark]] bit to delimit strings at the left, where the operation would start at the right. This bit had to be clear in all other parts of the string. This meant that, while the IBM 1401 had a seven-bit word, almost no-one ever thought to use this as a feature, and override the assignment of the seventh bit to (for example) handle ASCII codes.

Early microcomputer software relied upon the fact that ASCII codes do not use the high-order bit, and set it to indicate the end of a string. It must be reset to 0 prior to output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Allison |first1=Dennis |title=Design Notes for Tiny BASIC |url=http://www.ittybittycomputers.com/IttyBitty/TinyBasic/DDJ1/Design.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410220759/http://www.ittybittycomputers.com/IttyBitty/TinyBasic/DDJ1/Design.html |archivedate=2017-04-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Length-prefixed ====
The length of a string can also be stored explicitly, for example by prefixing the string with the length as a byte value. This convention is used in many [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] dialects; as a consequence, some people call such a string a '''Pascal string''' or '''P-string'''. Storing the string length as byte limits the maximum string length to 255. To avoid such limitations, improved implementations of P-strings use 16-, 32-, or 64-bit [[Word (data type)|words]] to store the string length. When the ''length'' field covers the [[address space]], strings are limited only by the [[Dynamic memory allocation|available memory]].

If the length is bounded, then it can be encoded in constant space, typically a machine word, thus leading to an [[implicit data structure]], taking ''n'' + ''k'' space, where ''k'' is the number of characters in a word (8 for 8-bit ASCII on a 64-bit machine, 1 for 32-bit UTF-32/UCS-4 on a 32-bit machine, etc.).
If the length is not bounded, encoding a length ''n'' takes log(''n'') space (see [[fixed-length code]]), so length-prefixed strings are a [[succinct data structure]], encoding a string of length ''n'' in log(''n'') + ''n'' space.

In the latter case, the length-prefix field itself doesn't have fixed length, therefore the actual string data needs to be moved when the string grows such that the length field needs to be increased.&lt;!---commented out: "bad" is not an issue in a technical encyclopedic article---This in itself is not that bad since the number of bytes is just logarithmic on the length of string,---&gt;&lt;!---commented out: while NULL-terminated string allow for pointers to proper substrings, length-prefixed strings do not; a pointer to a length-prefixed string has to point to the length field, which remains at the same location after growing--- but the downside is that any direct pointers to the string data get invalidated (they should move by one).---&gt;

Here is a Pascal string stored in a 10-byte buffer, along with its ASCII / UTF-8 representation:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto"
 |-
 | &lt;small&gt;length&lt;/small&gt;
 | &lt;code&gt;F&lt;/code&gt;  || &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt;  || &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;  || &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt;  || &lt;code&gt;K&lt;/code&gt;
 | style="background: #DDD" | &lt;code style="background: #DDD"&gt;k&lt;/code&gt;
 | style="background: #DDD" | &lt;code style="background: #DDD"&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;
 | style="background: #DDD" | &lt;code style="background: #DDD"&gt;f&lt;/code&gt;
 | style="background: #DDD" | &lt;code style="background: #DDD"&gt;w&lt;/code&gt;

==== Strings as records ====
Many languages, including object-oriented ones, implement strings as [[record (computer science)|record]]s with an internal structure like:

&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
class string {
  size_t length;
  char *text;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

However, since the implementation is usually [[information hiding|hidden]], the string must be accessed and modified through member functions. &lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; is a pointer to a dynamically allocated memory area, which might be expanded as needed. See also [[string (C++)]].

==== Other representations ====
Both character termination and length codes limit strings: For example, C character arrays that contain null (NUL) characters cannot be handled directly by [[C string]] library functions: Strings using a length code are limited to the maximum value of the length code.

Both of these limitations can be overcome by clever programming.

It is possible to create data structures and functions that manipulate them that do not have the problems associated with character termination and can in principle overcome length code bounds. It is also possible to optimize the string represented using techniques from [[Run-length encoding|run length encoding]] (replacing repeated characters by the character value and a length) and [[Hamming coding|Hamming encoding]]{{ clarify | date = June 2015 | reason = did you mean Huffman compression? Or do we need a few more words about error correction coding here? I don't see how either one helps us find out how long the string is. }}.

While these representations are common, others are possible. Using [[Rope (data structure)|rope]]s makes certain string operations, such as insertions, deletions, and concatenations more efficient.

The core data structure in a [[text editor]] is the one that manages the string (sequence of characters) that represents the current state of the file being edited.
While that state could be stored in a single long consecutive array of characters, a typical text editor instead uses an alternative representation as its sequence data structure—a [[gap buffer]], a [[linked list]] of lines, a [[piece table]], or a [[Rope (data structure)|rope]]—which makes certain string operations, such as insertions, deletions, and undoing previous edits, more efficient.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Security concerns ===
The differing memory layout and storage requirements of strings can affect the security of the program accessing the string data. String representations requiring a terminating character are commonly susceptible to [[buffer overflow]] problems if the terminating character is not present, caused by a coding error or an [[hacker (computer security)|attacker]] deliberately altering the data. String representations adopting a separate length field are also susceptible if the length can be manipulated. In such cases, program code accessing the string data requires [[bounds checking]] to ensure that it does not inadvertently access or change data outside of the string memory limits.

String data is frequently obtained from user-input to a program. As such, it is the responsibility of the program to validate the string to ensure that it represents the expected format. Performing limited or no validation of user-input can cause a program to be vulnerable to [[code injection]] attacks.

== Literal strings ==
{{See also|String literal}}

Sometimes, strings need to be embedded inside a text file that is both human-readable and intended for consumption by a machine.  This is needed in, for example, source code of programming languages, or in configuration files. In this case, the NUL character doesn't work well as a terminator since it is normally invisible (non-printable) and is difficult to input via a keyboard.  Storing the string length would also be inconvenient as manual computation and tracking of the length is tedious and error-prone.

Two common representations are:
* Surrounded by [[quotation mark]]s (ASCII [[hexadecimal#Using 0–9 and A–F|0x22]] double quote or ASCII 0x27 single quote), used by most programming languages. To be able to include special characters such as the quotation mark itself, newline characters, or non-printable characters, [[Escape character|escape sequence]]s are often available, usually prefixed with the [[backslash]] character (ASCII 0x5C).
* Terminated by a [[newline]] sequence, for example in Windows [[INI file]]s.

== Non-text strings ==
While character strings are very common uses of strings, a string in computer science may refer generically to any sequence of homogeneously typed data. A [[bit string]] or [[byte string]], for example, may be used to represent non-textual [[binary data]] retrieved from a communications medium. This data may or may not be represented by a string-specific datatype, depending on the needs of the application, the desire of the programmer, and the capabilities of the programming language being used. If the programming language's string implementation is not [[8-bit clean]], data corruption may ensue.

C programmers draw a sharp distinction between a "string", aka a "string of characters", which by definition is always null terminated, vs. a "byte string" or "pseudo string" which may be stored in the same array but is often not null terminated.
Using [[C string handling]] functions on such a "byte string" often seems to work, but later leads to [[string (computer science)#Security concerns|security problems]].&lt;ref&gt;

== String processing algorithms ==
There are many [[algorithm]]s for processing strings, each with various trade-offs. Some categories of algorithms include:
* [[String searching algorithm]]s for finding a given substring or pattern
* [[String manipulation algorithm]]s
* [[Sorting algorithm]]s
* [[Regular expression]] algorithms
* [[Parser|Parsing]] a string
* [[Sequence mining]]

Advanced string algorithms often employ complex mechanisms and data structures, among them [[suffix tree]]s and [[finite state machine]]s.

The name ''stringology'' was coined in 1984 by computer scientist [[Zvi Galil]] for the issue of algorithms and data structures used for string processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stringology.org/|title=The Prague Stringology Club|work=stringology.org|accessdate=23 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601001757/http://www.stringology.org/|archivedate=1 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Character string-oriented languages and utilities ==
Character strings are such a useful datatype that several languages have been designed in order to make string processing applications easy to write. Examples include the following languages:
* [[AWK (programming language)|awk]]
* [[Icon (programming language)|Icon]]
* [[MUMPS]]
* [[Perl]]
* [[Rexx]]
* [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]]
* [[sed]]
* [[SNOBOL]]
* [[Tcl]]
* [[TTM (programming language)|TTM]]

Many [[Unix]] utilities perform simple string manipulations and can be used to easily program some powerful string processing algorithms. Files and finite streams may be viewed as strings.

Some [[application programming interface|API]]s like [[Multimedia Control Interface]], [[embedded SQL]] or [[printf]] use strings to hold commands that will be interpreted.

Recent [[scripting programming language]]s, including Perl, [[Python (programming language)|Python]], Ruby, and Tcl employ [[regular expression]]s to facilitate text operations. Perl is particularly noted for its regular expression use,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/108/EssentialPerl.html#re|title=Essential Perl|quote=Perl's most famous strength is in string manipulation with regular expressions.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421014328/http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/108/EssentialPerl.html#re|archivedate=2012-04-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many other languages and applications implement [[Perl Compatible Regular Expressions|Perl compatible regular expression]]s.

Some languages such as Perl and Ruby support [[string interpolation]], which permits arbitrary expressions to be evaluated and included in string literals.

== Character string functions ==
{{See also|Comparison of programming languages (string functions)}}

[[String function]]s are used to manipulate a string or change or edit the contents of a string. They also are used to query information about a string. They are usually used within the context of a [[programming language|computer programming language]].

The most basic example of a string function is the [[string length]] function – the function that returns the length of a string (not counting any terminator characters or any of the string's internal structural information) and does not modify the string. This function is often named &lt;code&gt;[[comparison of programming languages (string functions)#length |length]]&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;len&lt;/code&gt;. For example, &lt;code&gt;length("hello world")&lt;/code&gt; would return 11.

==String buffers==&lt;!-- Anchor for redirect [String buffers]; please don't change. --&gt;
In some [[programming language]]s, a '''string buffer''' is an alternative to a string.  It has the ability to be altered through adding or appending, whereas a String is normally fixed or [[Immutable object|immutable]].

=== In Java ===

==== Theory ====
[[Java (Sun)|Java]]'s standard way to handle text is to use its &lt;code&gt;{{Javadoc:SE|java/lang|String}}&lt;/code&gt; [[Class (computer science)|class]]. Any given &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; in Java is an [[immutable object]], which means its [[State (computer science)|state]] cannot be changed. A &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; has an [[Array data type|array]] of [[Character (computing)|characters]]. Whenever a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; must be manipulated, any changes require the creation of a new &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; (which, in turn, involves the creation of a new array of characters, and copying of the original array). This happens even if the original &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;'s value or intermediate &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;s used for the manipulation are not kept.

Java provides two alternate classes for string manipulation, called {{Javadoc:SE|java/lang|StringBuffer}} and {{Javadoc:SE|java/lang|StringBuilder}}. Both of these, like &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;, each has an array to hold characters. They, however, are mutable (its state can be altered). Their array of characters is not necessarily completely filled (as opposed to a String, whose array is always the exact required length for its contents). Thus, a &lt;code&gt;StringBuffer&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;StringBuilder&lt;/code&gt; has the capability to add, remove, or change its state without creating a new object (and without the creation of a new array, and array copying). The exception to this is when its array is no longer of suitable length to hold its content (a case which rarely happens because of the default Dynamic memory allocation provided by the JVM). In this case, it is required to create a new array, and copy the contents.

For these reasons, Java would handle an expression like
&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
String newString = aString + anInt + aChar + aDouble;
&lt;/source&gt;
like this:
&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
String newString = (new StringBuilder(aString)).append(anInt).append(aChar).append(aDouble).toString();
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Implications ====
Generally, a &lt;code&gt;StringBuffer&lt;/code&gt; is more [[analysis of algorithms|efficient]] than a String in string handling. However, this is not necessarily the case, since a StringBuffer will be required to recreate its character array when it runs out of space. Theoretically, this is possible to happen the same number of times as a new String would be required, although this is unlikely (and the programmer can provide length hints to prevent this). Either way, the effect is not noticeable in modern desktop computers.

As well, the shortcomings of arrays are inherent in a &lt;code&gt;StringBuffer&lt;/code&gt;. In order to insert or remove characters at arbitrary positions, whole sections of arrays must be moved.

The method by which a &lt;code&gt;StringBuffer&lt;/code&gt; is attractive in an environment with low processing power takes this ability by using too much memory, which is likely also at a premium in this environment. This point, however, is trivial, considering the space required for creating many instances of Strings in order to process them. As well, the StringBuffer can be optimized to "waste" as little memory as possible.

The '''{{Javadoc:SE|java/lang|StringBuilder}}''' class, introduced in [[Java Platform, Standard Edition|J2SE]] 5.0, differs from &lt;code&gt;StringBuffer&lt;/code&gt; in that it is [[Synchronization (computer science)|unsynchronized]].  When only a single [[Thread (computer science)|thread]] at a time will access the object, using a &lt;code&gt;StringBuilder&lt;/code&gt; processes more efficiently than using a &lt;code&gt;StringBuffer&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;code&gt;StringBuffer&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;StringBuilder&lt;/code&gt; are included in the {{Javadoc:SE|package=java.lang|java/lang}} package.

=== In .NET ===
Microsoft's [[.NET Framework]] has a &lt;code&gt;StringBuilder&lt;/code&gt; class in its [[Base Class Library]].

=== In other languages ===
* In [[C++]] and [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], the standard string class is already mutable, with the ability to change the contents and append strings, etc., so a separate mutable string class is unnecessary.
* In [[Objective-C]] ([[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]]/[[OpenStep]] frameworks), the &lt;code&gt;NSMutableString&lt;/code&gt; class is the mutable version of the &lt;code&gt;NSString&lt;/code&gt; class.

=== String instructions ===

Some [[microprocessor]]'s [[instruction set architecture]]s contain direct support for string operations, such as block copy (e.g. In [[intel x86]]m &lt;code&gt;REPNZ MOVSB&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19120-01/open.solaris/817-5477/eoizn/index.html|title=x86 string instructions|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150327220944/http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19120-01/open.solaris/817-5477/eoizn/index.html|archivedate=2015-03-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Hotel-suite-living-room.jpg|thumb|Living room in a hotel suite at the [[Doubletree Hotel]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]].]]
A '''suite''' in a '''[[hotel]]''' or other public accommodation such as a [[cruise ship]] denotes, according to most dictionary definitions, connected rooms under one room number.  Hotels may refer to suites as a class of accommodations with more space than a typical [[hotel]] room, but technically speaking there must be more than one room to constitute a true suite.

In luxury or upscale accommodations, such as [[Ritz Carlton]], [[InterContinental Hotels &amp; Resorts|InterContinental]], [[Marriott Hotels &amp; Resorts|Marriott]], [[Embassy Suites]], or [[Homewood Suites by Hilton]] key features may include multiple rooms. Many independent properties have one or more [[honeymoon]] suites. The most luxurious accommodation in a hotel is often called the [[presidential suite]] or royal suite.

Upper-midscale accommodations, such as [[Comfort Suites]], [[Hampton Inn &amp; Suites]], and [[Candlewood Suites]], may denote suites as one room with more space and furniture than a standard hotel room, and so technically these would not be considered suites of rooms per se. In addition to one or more beds and bedroom fixtures, such "suites" include a living or sitting area, often equipped with a [[sofa bed]]. Dining, office and kitchen facilities are also added in many of these "suites." Some chains, such as [[Staybridge Suites]], offer only suites, which often cater to [[business travel]]ers who appreciate additional space and may use it to host small meetings or entertain clients.  

==Bridal and honeymoon suites==
As a form of [[niche market]]ing, hôteliers occasionally offer premium rooms with specialised amenities aimed at couples or [[newlywed]]s. 

While [[Niagara Falls]] had branded itself "the honeymoon capital of the world" as early as the railway era of the late 1800s, its first tentative promotion of campground "honeymoon huts" dates to the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Karen Dubinsky|title=The Second Greatest Disappointment: Honeymooning and Tourism at Niagara Falls|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NxkE2wRfjAQC&amp;pg=PT183|year=1999|publisher=Between The Lines|isbn=978-1-896357-23-2|pages=183–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "honeymoon suite" pattern of multiple destinations offering bridal suites with heart-shaped tubs is a more modern one, which grew in the post-[[World War II]] era of aeroplanes and motorcar travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick McGreevy|title=Imagining Niagara: The Meaning and Making of Niagara Falls|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AYCtIYG-75QC&amp;pg=PA39|date=1 June 2009|publisher=Univ of Massachusetts Press|isbn=1-55849-771-4|pages=39–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of special "honeymoon suites" or "romance suites" marketed to couples, newlyweds or "second honeymooners" is widespread, appearing not only in hotel/motel or resort accommodation, but also aboard [[cruise ship]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kay Showker|title=The Unofficial Guide to Cruises|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s8ZCkCPezAUC&amp;pg=PA326|date=25 March 2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-63721-0|pages=326–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Suresh Bhat''' ({{lang-mr|सुरेश भट}}; 15 April 1932 – 14 March 2003) was a noted [[Marathi language|Marathi]] poet from the state of [[Maharashtra]], [[India]]. He was known as ''[[Ghazal]] [[Emperor|Samrat]]'' (Emperor of ''[[ghazals]]'') for his exposition of the ''ghazal'' form of poetry and its adaptation to the [[Marathi language]].

==Life==
Bhat was born in a [[Karhade Brahmin]] family in [[Amravati]], [[Maharashtra]] to Shridhar Bhat, a [[physician]]. His mother was fond of poetry and made young Bhat learn famous Marathi poems by heart. He later acknowledged this practice to be a key influence in the development of his poetic abilities.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

When he was two and a half years old, Bhat contracted [[Poliomyelitis|polio]]. The disease left his right leg incapacitated for the remainder of his life.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Bhat completed his education in [[Amravati]], and earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] degree in 1955 after failing twice in his final exams. He said later that due to his physical disability and lack of interest in academics, he often suffered humiliation at home. According to him, his poems were the only source of comfort for him during such times of bitterness and depression.{{Citation needed|date= June 2012}}

After graduation, Bhat continued writing poems whilst holding various teaching jobs in [[Rural]] areas around Amravati.{{Citation needed|date= June 2012}}

In his private life, Bhat made no bones about his hurt over the rejections and embarrassment that he suffered earlier in life, and said that he was not someone who forgives or forgets easily. His poems reflect his angst about human suffering, and due to their fiery nature, are generally popular amongst the youth.{{Citation needed|date= June 2012}}

.

He had two sons and a daughter. One of them predeceased him when he was killed in an accident.{{Citation needed|date= June 2012}}

Suresh Bhat died of [[cardiac arrest]] on 14 March 2003. He was 70.&lt;ref name="TOI"&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2003-03-15/news-interviews/27282240_1_suresh-bhat-poet-asha-bhosle Popular gazal writer Suresh Bhat expires - The Times of India]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Bhat published his first collection of poems, ''Roopgandha'' in 1961. In 1974, he published his second collection, ''Ranga maazhaa wegalaa'' and in 1983 he self-published a collection named ''Elgaar''. Other collections of his poems include ''Zanjhaavaat'' and ''Saptaranga''

''Roopgandha'' and ''Ranga maazhaa wegalaa'' were the recipients of the state literary awards sponsored by the [[Government of Maharashtra]]&lt;ref name="TOI"/&gt; in their respective years of publication. ''Ranga maazhaa wegalaa'' was later taught in three universities in Maharashtra for the [[Master of Arts|MA]] course in Marathi.{{Which|date=March 2010}}{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

Bhat's poems are generally classified as Marathi ''[[ghazals]]''. He is considered {{By whom| date= June 2012}} a pioneer in adapting the ''ghazal'' (which originated as a [[Persian literature|Persian]] form of poetry) to the Marathi language.

Bhat's best-known verses gained popularity after they were set to music by [[Hridaynath Mangeshkar]], and were sung by [[Lata Mangeshkar]] and [[Asha Bhosle]].&lt;ref name="TOI"/&gt;

Bhat's poem 'Maayboli' was composed by music director [[Kaushal Inamdar]] as the [[Marathi Abhimaangeet]] as a mega song featuring more than 450 singers.

The first version was published in [[English language|English]] online in September 1998 by the NHGRI Office of Science Education under the title of "''Talking Glossary of Genetics''".&lt;ref name='NHGRI1988'&gt;[[National Human Genome Research Institute#1988]] retrieved 2007-Apr-27&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish-language version was released 18 months later.&lt;ref name='NHGRI1988'/&gt;

==About the Talking Glossary of Genetics==

A new multimedia, and significantly updated, version of the English Talking Glossary of Genetics was released by the National Human Genome Research Institute in October, 2009. An identical update of the Spanish-language version was released in October, 2011. In September, 2011, an iPhone App of the English Talking Glossary was released by NHGRI and made available as a free download in the Apple App store. The App version contains all 3-D animations, high quality illustrations, the "Test Your Gene IQ" quiz, and similar user functions such as "Suggest a Term" and "Mail This Term to a Friend."

The original version had been based on simple HTML entries and was developed in the mid-1990s at a time when dial-up modems were commonly used to access the internet at speeds as low as 14.4 kps. That version of the Talking Glossary contained 178 terms and talking explanations of each term, as well as about 70 black-and-white illustrations. 

The new, and current, versions of the Talking Glossary featured a substantial visual, content, and functional upgrade to the popular online tool. The new Glossaries are built on a vibrant FLASH-based web design employing colorful pages, clear digital audio files, color illustrations, 3-D animations, a "Test Your Gene IQ" function, real-time applets to "cite a term in a paper", "suggest a term", and "share a term" via email.

The list of terms was expanded to 256 entries. Terms were chosen using a number of metrics including a review of the online usage of the glossary over the previous decade. Some terms were dropped as a result, and a large number of terms were added. Other metrics used to determine terms included a scan of the most commonly used science books in U.S. K-12 classrooms for terms and concepts, review of all terms suggested by users using the glossary term suggestion function, and a scan of public media and scientific publications for terms.

'''Developing the Talking Glossary:'''

The Talking Glossary of Genetics is a science learning tool developed by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NHGRI oversaw the NIH's role in the Human Genome Project, the international research effort aimed at mapping the genes in the human body and developing tools for gene discovery.

Many of the Talking Glossary terms are commonly used today in news reports, by researchers and medical professionals, in classrooms and, increasingly, as part of daily conversation.

In this light, the Glossary was designed to enable people without a formal scientific background to better understand the terms and concepts behind genetic research. Special attention has been paid to users who are learning or teaching genetics in the classroom. However, the Glossary is designed to be valuable for a much wider audience including patients, doctors, nurses, parents, and professionals dealing with genetic concepts and terminology, such as judges, lawyers, law enforcement officials, and others.

The process of developing the Talking Glossary began by examining some of the most popular American middle school and high school science textbooks. Genetics-related terms from these textbooks provided the foundation for the Talking Glossary. These terms are associated with biological concepts addressed by the National Science Education Standards and common in high school and college biology courses. Additional terms not found in textbooks were added to the glossary, reflecting the rapid pace of genetic research and its coverage in the media.

'''Written Definitions:'''

Each glossary entry has a written definition that has been reviewed for clarity and accuracy by teams of science educators and genetic researchers. All of the definitions were written by the same Ph.D.-level science writer for consistency and accuracy.

'''Illustrations:'''

Most terms have professionally drawn illustrations to further explain a meaning or concept, or place them in context of the cell or a similar biological setting as a means to better explain the term. All illustrations are provided by the medical illustrator/artist at the NHGRI to enable continuity and maximize re-use in learning tools such as slide shows. All illustrations are copyright free.

Each illustration can be viewed as a webpage within the glossary or downloaded as a high-quality PDF file or PowerPoint slide.

'''3–D Animations:'''

The Glossary contains many terms that are illustrated with 3-D movie animations. The animations have a non-descript musical background and are purposely not narrated to maximize use. These animations may be played alone or simultaneously with the spoken definition of the term. All cellular organelles have animation sequences, as do many key terms such as gene, cell, ACGT, and chromosome.

'''Spoken Explanations of Glossary Terms:'''

Each term features a friendly and informative spoken explanation that can be heard on any computer with sound capabilities by clicking on the "Listen" button on each term page. Spoken explanations can be paused at any point for user convenience.

Each speaker comments on, or defines, terms relevant to their personal field of study. For example, leading cancer researchers comment on cancer, genetic counselors explain genetic testing terms, and expert gene hunters tackle the many terms surrounding the search for or mapping of genes. All speakers are actively working in the field, and most work at NHGRI.

The written definition provides a reasonable definition for each term. The spoken definition is not the same as the written definition. Instead, each speaker was asked to provide information different than the written definition that would expand the listener’s understanding of the term. Speakers were also asked to explain the term to the average person, not another scientist. No speaker was allowed to read, all recorded explanations are spontaneous.

'''How to Pronounce a Term:'''

Much of the terminology of genetics and biology is unique in its pronunciation. Below each term name is a “Pronunciation” button. Click the button to hear the term spoken. Each term, regardless of its name, is pronounced.

'''Information On Each Speaker:'''

A brief biography and photograph of each speaker accompanies terms listed in the glossary. This enables the user to examine the speaker's credentials and learn more about their research interests.

'''Related Terms:'''

If either a written or spoken definition uses other Talking Glossary terms in its text or dialogue, these terms appear in the “Related Terms” listing at the bottom of each term page. The related terms list also includes Glossary terms that reviewers of the Glossary felt would be helpful to the user.

'''“Test Your Gene Knowledge” Quiz:'''

The Talking Glossary offers a 10-term quiz designed to be both fun and instructional. The quiz can be accessed from every term page in the Glossary. Users can choose to test their knowledge about terms commonly found in K-16 science classrooms or, more generally, in popular news reports or conversation. The quiz randomly chooses terms from the Talking Glossary and asks the user to select a term name to match the definition shown. Hints are available for each question, and at the end of the quiz all users are able to print a "Certificate of Completion" that includes the date the test was taken, number of correct answers, and the user's name.
'''
About PDF and PPT Files:'''

PDF (Portable Document Format) files are high-quality image files that appear and print like the original artwork. These finely detailed illustrations will download quickly and include required fonts. PDF files of Glossary illustrations can be downloaded and saved for later uses, such as overhead transparencies, school reports, or for handouts in class or at a talk or other event. Each PDF file is formatted to print on regular printer paper or standard overhead transparency.

Illustrations are also downloadable as PowerPoint slides. These files can be easily copied and pasted into any existing PowerPoint presentation or can serve as a starting point for a new presentation. These slides are designed to provide lecturers with an easy-to-use and convenient source of illustrations for genetic terms and concepts.

'''Tara Devi Tuladhar''' ([[Devanagari]]: तारा देवी तुलाधर) (21 August 1931 – 27 November 2012) was Nepal's first female blood donor and a social worker who dedicated her life to serving society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title= First female blood donor dies|url= http://www.ekantipur.com/the-kathmandu-post/2012/11/28/metro/newsdigest/242223.html |accessdate=29 November 2012|newspaper= The Kathmandu Post|publisher= |date=29 November 2012}} Page 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Nhapamha hidata manta ("First blood donor passes away")|newspaper= Sandhya Times|publisher= |date=28 November 2012}} Page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Tara Devi was born to an old merchant family at Tanlāchhi (तंलाछि), [[Kathmandu]]. Her father [[Triratna Man Tuladhar]] was a [[Lhasa Newar (trans-Himalayan traders)|Lhasa Newar]] trader. Her grandfather [[Dharma Man Tuladhar]] was a philanthropist best known for renovating the [[Swayambhui]] stupa in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tuladhar |first=Kamal Ratna |title= The sahu’s daughter |url= http://www.ekantipur.com/the-kathmandu-post/2013/02/01/on-saturday/the-first-word/244810.html |accessdate=6 February 2013 |newspaper= The Kathmandu Post |publisher= |date=2 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were only a few schools in the 1930s as the [[Rana dynasty|Rana]] regime did not want ordinary citizens to get an education. For girls, it was even more difficult to join school. So Tara Devi received informal tuition at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://countrystudies.us/nepal/34.htm |title= Education under Rana Rule |last= |first= |author= |year=1991 |editor-last= Savada |editor-first= Andrea Matles | website= Nepal: A Country Study |publisher= U.S. Library of Congress | accessdate=13 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, her family sent her to study at St. Josephs's Convent in [[Kalimpong]], [[India]]. Returning to Kathmandu, she joined Kanya High School and finished 10th grade. In 1953, she went to [[Allahabad]], India and enrolled at [[Kamla Nehru Memorial Hospital]] to pursue her long cherished goal to become a nurse. Two years later, she received her Diploma in Midwifery.

She had been inspired to become a nurse by the tales she had heard as a child about how nurse [[Vidyabati Kansakar]] had cared for the injured during the [[1934 Nepal–Bihar earthquake|great earthquake of 1934]] in Kathmandu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tuladhar |first=Kamal Ratna |title= The sahu’s daughter |url= http://www.ekantipur.com/the-kathmandu-post/2013/02/01/on-saturday/the-first-word/244810.html |accessdate=14 July 2013 |newspaper= The Kathmandu Post |publisher= |date=2 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

In 1960, Tara Devi began service at Prasuti Griha Maternity Hospital, Kathmandu. After doing her Post Graduate in Nursing from the College of Nursing, [[New Delhi]] in 1964, she became a senior tutor at Nursing School in Kathmandu.

In 1961, she became the first female blood donor in Nepal by donating blood to a patient who was due for surgery and required blood urgently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Adhikari|first=Sharada|title=Life giving blood|url= |accessdate=|newspaper= The Himalayan Times |publisher= |date=20 December 2009}} Page 7.&lt;/ref&gt; She was the supervisor at [[Tribhuvan University]] Teaching Hospital before she retired in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |title= First female blood donor no more|url= |accessdate=|newspaper= The Rising Nepal |publisher= |date=29 November 2012}} Page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social service==

After her retirement, Tara Devi worked as a volunteer at Dharmakirti Vihar, a [[Theravada Buddhist]] [[nunnery]] in Kathmandu, and used her skills as a trained nurse in the service of the resident nuns and the needy people who came there seeking help. As the coordinator of its health service, she organized free health care every week besides providing training on the care of patients and the elderly. She was also a life member of the Dharmakirti Vihar Conservation Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tuladhar|first=Prem Laxmi|title= Abalay yamha nurse |url= |accessdate=|newspaper= Sandhya Times|publisher= |date=8 November 2009}} Page 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tara Devi volunteered at Jana Chikitsalaya, a community clinic in Kathmandu. Besides serving as an executive board member of Paropakar Organisation, the first modern charitable organization in Nepal which was established in 1952,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Limbu |first= Ramyata |title= Bahadur Nepali |url= http://www.nepalitimes.com/issue/2001/02/09/Nation/8752 |accessdate=28 November 2012 |newspaper= Nepali Times|date=9 February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; she was an adviser to Udaaya Samaj, a social organization of the [[Uray (caste group)|Uray]] community. Tara Devi remained unmarried to be free to pursue her profession.

==Publications==

Tara Devi has authored two books, one in [[Nepali language|Nepali]] and the other in [[Nepal Bhasa]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12411">The '''TenTen Corpus Family''' (also called '''TenTen corpora''') is a set of comparable web [[text corpora]], i.e. collections of texts that have been [[Web crawler|crawled]] from the [[World Wide Web]] and processed to match the same standards. These corpora are made available through the [[Sketch Engine]] corpus manager. There are TenTen corpora for more than 35 languages. Their target size is 10 billion (10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;) words per language, which gave rise to the corpus family's name.&lt;ref name="tenten"&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Jakubíček|first1=Miloš|last2=Kilgarriff|first2=Adam|author-link2=Adam Kilgarriff|last3=Kovář|first3=Vojtěch|last4=Rychlý|first4=Pavel|last5=Suchomel|first5=Vít|date=July 2013|title=The Tenten Corpus Family|url=https://www.sketchengine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/The_TenTen_Corpus_2013.pdf|conference=7th International Corpus Linguistics Conference CL|location=Lancaster, UK|publisher=Lancaster University|pages=125–127|access-date=13 June 2017|book-title=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the creation of the TenTen corpora, data crawled from the World Wide Web are processed with [[natural language processing]] tools developed by the Natural Language Processing Centre at the Faculty of Informatics at [[Masaryk University]] ([[Brno]], [[Czech Republic]]) and by the Lexical Computing company (developer of the Sketch Engine).

== Corpus linguistics ==

In [[corpus linguistics]], a [[text corpus]] is a large and structured collection of texts that are electronically stored and processed. It is used to do hypothesis testing about languages, validating linguistic rules or the frequency distribution of words ([[n-grams]]) within languages. 

Electronically processed corpora provide fast search. Text processing procedures such as [[Lexical_analysis#Tokenization|tokenization]], [[part-of-speech tagging]] and [[word-sense disambiguation]] enrich corpus texts with detailed linguistic information. This enables to narrow the search to a particular [[Part of speech|parts of speech]], word sequences or a specific part of the corpus.

First text corpora were created in the 1960s, such as the 1-million-word [[Brown Corpus]] of [[American English]]. Over time, many further corpora were produced (such as the [[British National Corpus]] and the [[Lancaster-Oslo-Bergen Corpus|LOB Corpus]]) and work had begun also on corpora of larger sizes and covering other languages than English. This development was linked with the emergence of corpus creation tools that help achieve larger size, wider coverage, cleaner data etc.

== Production of TenTen corpora ==
The procedure by which TenTen corpora are produced is based on the creators' earlier research in preparing web corpora and the subsequent processing thereof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Baroni|first1=Marco|last2=Kilgarriff|first2=Adam|author-link2=Adam Kilgarriff|last3=Kovář|first3=Vojtěch|last4=Rychlý|first4=Pavel|last5=Suchomel|first5=Vít|date=July 2013|title=Large linguistically-processed web corpora for multiple languages|url=http://clic.cimec.unitn.it/marco/publications/eacl2006/dewac_eacl.pdf|conference=11th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Posters &amp; Demonstrations.

== TenTen corpora data structure ==
TenTen corpora follow a specific metadata structure that is common to all of them. Metadata is contained in structural attributes that relate to individual documents and paragraphs in the corpus. Some TenTen corpora can feature additional specific attributes.

=== Document attributes ===

*[[top-level domain]] – domain at the highest level of the hierarchical [[Domain Name System]] (e.g. "com")
*[[website]] – identification string defining a realm of administrative autonomy within the Internet (e.g. "wikipedia.org")
*[[Domain name|web domain]] – collection of related web pages  (e.g. "la.wikipedia.org")
*crawl date – date when the document was downloaded from the Web
*url – the [[Uniform Resource Locator]] referring to the document's source
*wordcount – number of words in the document
*length – classification of the document into a range by its length measured in thousands of words

=== Paragraph attributes ===

*[[Headline|heading]] – a numeric attribute distinguishing [[Page header|headers]] and similar titles from ordinary [[body text]] (1 if the paragraph is a heading, 0 otherwise)

A '''truce term''' is a [[word]] or short [[phrase]] accepted within a community of children as an effective way of calling for a temporary respite or [[truce]] during a game or activity, such as [[tag (game)|tag]] or its variants. Common examples in [[English speaking]] cultures are ''barley'', ''fainites'', ''crosses'', ''kings'' and ''exe(s)''in the United Kingdom, ''pegs'' and ''nibs'' in [[New Zealand]] and variants of ''barley'' in Australia. In the United States, terms based on ''[[Time-out (sport)|time-out]]'' have, from the 1950s onwards, largely supplanted earlier common terms based on ''kings'' and ''exe(s)''. Since the late 1980s ''time-out'' has been recorded in other [[English language|English]] speaking cultures besides the US. Examples of use of truce terms are if a child has a [[side stitch|stitch]] or wants to raise a point on the rules of the game.

Traditionally these terms are specific to certain geographical areas although some may be used by a particular [[social group]] such as ''pax'' in the UK, used primarily by children attending [[Private schools#United Kingdom|private school]]s. To be functional a truce term must be understood and honoured by most of the children playing together.&lt;ref name=knapp&gt;{{citation|title=Tradition and Change in American Playground Language|author=Knapp H and Knapp M|journal= The Journal of American Folklore|volume=86|number= 340|date=April–June 1973|pages= 131–141|publisher= University of Illinois Press on behalf of American Folklore Society|jstor= 539746|doi=10.2307/539746}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most extensive study of the use and incidence of these terms is that undertaken by [[folklorist]]s [[Peter and Iona Opie|Iona and Peter Opie]] in the UK in their 1959 book, ''The Lore and Language of Schoolchildren'', which mapped the use of truce terms across England, Wales and Scotland.&lt;ref name="opie"&gt;{{citation|author=Opie, Iona &amp; Peter |title=The Lore and Language of Schoolchildren |year=1959|location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=141–153 |isbn=0-940322-69-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Opies considered it the most important word in a schoolchild's [[vocabulary]] and one for which there was no adult equivalent. There has been little recent research in the UK but such research as there has been indicates that truce terms, including some of those prevalent in the late 1950s, are still in general use.&lt;ref name=beck&gt;{{citation|author=Beckwith I, Shirley R.|title=Truce Terms: a Lincolnshire Survey|journal= Local Historian|volume= 11|issue=8|year=1975|pages=441–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=roud&gt;{{citation|author=Roud. K. &amp; S.|title=Truce Terms in Croydon, Surrey, 1988|journal=Talking Folklore|volume=7|year=1989|pages=15–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies conducted since the 1970s in English speaking cultures show that truce terms are also prevalent in Australia, [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]] and the United States with a number of terms deriving from older terms used in the UK, but many not.

The use of a truce term is usually accompanied by a gesture, such as [[crossed fingers]] of one or both hands or the raising of thumbs. In the US a T-shape made with both hands (representing ''time-out'') has become prevalent and this gesture is also appearing in other countries.

==Use==
Truce terms are recorded as having been used in the following circumstances; being out of breath, having a [[Side stitch|stitch]], a shoelace being undone, fear of clothes being damaged, needing to go to the lavatory, checking the time, wanting to discuss or clarify rules during a fight or game, or one combatant wanting to remove their spectacles or jacket before continuing. It does not mean to surrender, although it may sometimes be used in preparation to surrendering.&lt;ref name="opie"/&gt; Truce terms are only used within a specific age group, have little currency outside that group and are by and large abandoned by the age of 10 or 11 years.&lt;ref name="lw"&gt;{{citation|title=A Companion to Medieval English Literature and Culture, C.1350-c.1500|author=Brown P|year=2006|publisher=WileyBlackwell|location=|isbn=978-0-631-21973-6 
|pages=145–146}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, research into early recorded use of these terms found examples of some of these terms being used as a sign of surrender in battle or adult fights or quarrels as late as the 18th century.&lt;ref name="doare"/&gt;

The vocabulary of [[children's games]], including truce terms, is described by [[Sociolinguistics|sociolinguist]] [[Peter Trudgill]] in ''Dialects of England'' as being particularly rich in regional variation insofar as they are not based on official or television culture.&lt;ref name="doe"&gt;{{citation|author=Trudgill P|title=Dialects of England|publisher=Blackwell|edition=2nd|year=1999|isbn=978-0-631-21815-9|location=Oxford|page=126 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are an example of the [[Children's street culture|subculture of young children]] which is transmitted by word of mouth.&lt;ref name=YW&gt;{{citation|author=Young M, Willmott P|title=The symmetrical family: a study of work and leisure in the London region|publisher=Routledge|year=1973|isbn=978-0-7100-7627-4|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opie study===
The Opies conducted a study of the use of truce terms throughout England, Scotland and Wales in the 1950s and published their results in a book called ''The Lore and Language of Schoolchildren''. They found truce terms varied according to geographical location, with the exception of ''pax''. In some places, more than one term was current and often four or five were known, although usually only one term predominated. Schools bordering two linguistic regions honoured both. The words used in [[Urban area|urban]] areas were often at odds with words used in the surrounding countryside. The Opies recorded around 45 truce terms plus variations. The most widely used were ''barley'', ''fainites'', ''kings'', ''crosses'', ''keys'', ''skinch'', ''cree'' and ''scribs''.&lt;ref name="opie"/&gt;

''Barley'' was recorded by the Opies as the prevailing term in east Scotland and the [[Scottish Borders|Borders]], the [[Lake District]], north-west England, west [[English Midlands|Midlands]] and in Wales, apart from the south east of Wales where ''cree'' prevailed. There were many variations such as ''barley-bay'', ''barley-bees'', ''barlow'' or ''barrels''. The use of ''barlay'' as a truce term appears in the 14th century poem ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight|Sir Gawayne and the Grene Knight]]'' and [[Tobias Smollett]]'s ''[[The Reprisal]]''. It is recorded in [[lexicographer]] [[John Jamieson]]'s 1808 ''Etymological Dictionary of the Scottish Language'' as a term specifically used by children to demand truce. A probable variation also appears in the 1568 manuscript ''Chrysts-Kirk of the Grene'', sometimes attributed to [[James I of Scotland]], as follows;

[[File:Gawain and the Green Knight.jpg|right|thumb|Mediaeval illumination of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]
::Thocht he was wicht, he was nocht wyss,
:::With sic Jangleurs to jummill;
::For frae his Thoume they dang a Sklyss,
:::Quhyle he cry'd ''Barlafummill''.&lt;ref name="opie"/&gt;

The "Thoume" (thumb) that is "sklyss" (sliced) in the quote above may refer to the thumb having been raised by the man calling ''barlafummill'', a common accompanying gesture to the use of a truce term in Scotland.&lt;ref name="opie"/&gt;

''Fainites'' and ''fains'' (or ''vainites'' and ''vains'') predominated in London and throughout southern England, apart from the ''scribs'' and ''screams'' of east [[Hampshire]], and extended north as far as [[Olney, Buckinghamshire|Olney]] in [[Buckinghamshire]]. Variations included ''fennits'', ''fannies'', ''fainsies'', ''faylines'', ''vainlights'' and ''vainyards''. ''[[Notes and Queries]]'' reported in 1870 that ''fains'' was in common use by London schoolboys. ''Faints'' appeared in an 1889 dictionary of slang and ''fainits'' in 1891. According to philologist [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], the term derives from the medieval term ''fein I'', descended in turn from the [[Old French]] ''se feindre'' meaning "to make excuses, hang back or back out of battle". He also proposes that this use of the term throws light on line 529 of the [[Canterbury Tales|Clerk's Tale]] by [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] that "lordes heestes mowe nat been ''yfeyned''" (the lords orders cannot be treated with a ''fain I''; in other words, declined).&lt;ref name="opie"/&gt; Another translation of the Anglo-Norman word ''feindre'' is "pretend, feign, turn a blind eye to", which is what the more powerful child does whilst granting respite.&lt;ref name="lw"/&gt;

Spoken English south of the [[Danelaw]] became, from at least the 11th century onwards, characterised by a pronunciation known as Southern Voicing, such as ''vrog'' for frog, or ''zummer'' for summer. ''Vainites'' or ''vains'', variants of ''fainites'' or ''fains'', are surviving examples of this on the borders of the Danelaw to the north of London. Other truce terms prevail within the Danelaw.&lt;ref name="lw"/&gt;

''Kings'' was recorded by the Opies as common in eastern England. ''[[Joseph Wright (linguist)|The English Dialect Dictionary]]'' recorded much the same in the nineteenth century. The earliest recorded instance the Opies found was in Sternberg's 1851 ''Dialect of Northamptonshire''. ''Queens'' is recorded as used in the ''kings'' area, sometimes as an alternative and sometimes as indicating readiness to restart the game.&lt;ref name="opie"/&gt; ''Kings truce'' is found in [[Thomas Dekker (writer)|Thomas Dekker]]'s ''[[The Honest Whore]], Part One (II,i)'', which appeared in 1604. The term is used in the play to halt a quarrel.&lt;ref name=woodward/&gt;

''Crosses'', ''cruces'', ''creases'' and ''cree'' were found in a broad band across England from ''crosses'' in [[Lincolnshire]], ''cruce'' or ''cruces'' from [[Oxford]] through to [[Gloucester]], ''creases'' in [[Berkshire]] and ''cree'' in [[South Wales]] and both sides of the [[Bristol Channel]]. There are some areas of ''scruces'', ''screwsies'' or ''screws'' in Essex and Suffolk. The Opies saw ''creases'' as a transitional word.&lt;ref name="opie"/&gt;

''Exes'', used around [[Ipswich]] and [[Norwich]], was thought to be a variant of ''crosses''.&lt;ref name="opie"/&gt;

''Bars'' and sometimes ''barsies'' were common in [[Devon]] in an otherwise predominantly ''fainites'' area. ''Bar'' was used the other side of the [[Bristol channel]] in [[Swansea]].

''Skinch'' or ''skinge'' predominated in [[Northumberland]] and [[Durham, England|Durham]], another term first recorded in a nineteenth-century [[dialect]] dictionary.&lt;ref name="opie"/&gt;

''Keys'' was found by the Opies to be the prevailing term in western Scotland and in a strip running through north-west England in an otherwise predominantly ''barley'' area.&lt;ref name="opie"/&gt;

''Scribs'' or ''squibs'' coverered an area from [[Hampshire]], to [[West Sussex]] and [[Surrey]]. Other Hampshire variants were ''scrims'', ''screens'', ''scrames'', ''screams'', ''creams'' and ''cribs''.&lt;ref name="opie"/&gt;

''Finns'' was used in [[Guernsey]].

''Pax'', ([[Latin]] for "peace"), was a group dialect word rather than a regional one as it was predominantly used in private schools and [[school story|school stories]].&lt;ref name="opie"/&gt;

Many individual cities, towns and rural districts had their own words, not used elsewhere such as ''bees'', ''blobs'', ''croggies'', ''denny'', ''keppies'', ''locks'', ''peas'', ''peril'', ''nix'', ''truce'', ''snakes''  and ''twigs''.&lt;ref name="opie"/&gt;

===Post-Opie studies===
A study undertaken in [[Lincolnshire]] in 1974 confirmed the Opies' findings.&lt;ref name=beck/&gt; However, a later study undertaken in [[Croydon]], Surrey in 1988 found the use of truce terms much less uniform. Croydon is firmly in the ''fainites'' area on the Opies' map, but in 1988 ''fainites'' was only the third most commonly used term. The most common terms were ''pax'' (30%), ''jecs'' (25%), ''fainites'' (20%) and ''cross keys'' (2%). ''Jecs'' is a term not recorded by the Opies at all and there was some evidence that it derived from the word ''injection''. ''Fainites'' was known more than it was used and was reported by one teacher to be "totally lacking in [[Credibility#Street credibility|street credibility]]". ''Pax'' was no longer a group word as reported by the Opies. Other terms reported included ''pips'', ''[[Force shield|force field]]'' and ''quits''. The authors concluded that either the Opies had grossly oversimplified the picture or things had radically changed in 30 years (some seven to eight generations of primary school children). They also noted that although some schools reported a marked preference for a particular term, all schools reported at least some children using different terms.&lt;ref name=roud/&gt;

The Concise [[Scots language|Scots]] Language Dictionary published in 1999, records the use of ''keys'' as a truce term in Fife, south west and west central Scotland.&lt;ref name=scots&gt;{{cite book|title=The Concise Scots Language Dictionary|date=August 1999|publisher=Polygon at Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-1-902930-01-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
According to researchers from the [[National Australian Dictionary Centre]] there is evidence that ''barley'' (Scotland and the west of England), ''barlies'' (Aberdeen and a few English towns), ''bar'' (Swansea) and ''bars'' (Devon), are used in Australia. In Australia the terms are used regionally with [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorians]] using ''barley'', [[New South Wales|New South Welshmen]] using ''bar'' or ''bars'' and the people of [[Western Australia]] using ''barlies.''&lt;ref name=andc&gt;{{citation|title=Ozwords|url=http://www.anu.edu.au/ANDC/pubs/ozwords/May_97/6._from_the_centre.htm|publisher=Australian National Dictionary Centre|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Zealand==
A study undertaken between 1999 and 2001 in [[New Zealand]] by [[Lexicography|lexicographers]] Laurie and Winifred Bauer on traditional forms of play included truce terms. The terms they described in their study were regional and the most common were ''pegs'' (widespread), ''twigs'' (Taranaki), ''gates'' (Auckland), ''tags'' (Nelson Marlborough), and ''nibs'' (Otago-Southland).&lt;ref name=bauer&gt;{{citation|author=Bauer L, Bauer W|title=Playing with Tradition|journal=[[Journal of Folklore Research]]|date= May 1, 2007 |url=http://www.victoria.ac.nz/lals/research/Playground/docs/lip14.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Wellington]] schools the dominant term was ''fans'', recorded in New Zealand before 1920, which the authors state derives from ''fains'' or ''fain it'' as described by the Opies, itself dating back to [[Chaucer]]ian times. The most widespread term was ''pegs'', derived from ''pax''. Apparently unrecorded before World War II this appears to have first changed to ''pags'', probably from being shouted out at length, and then further mutated by virtue of broad New Zealand accents to ''pegs''. The Bauers thought the most likely hypothesis for the use of this rather upper class term from the UK, was that it derived from books and stories about UK [[Public school (UK)|public schools]]. Similarly they thought ''nibs'' derived from ''nix'', possibly via ''nigs'', originally from South Africa though unknown to the Opies save for a very small area of ''nicks'' possibly from ''nicklas''. ''Nix'' is also UK public school slang though not as a truce term.&lt;ref name="bauer"/&gt; ''Nixs'' and ''flix'' were recorded as having been described by a South African boy as prevalent in [[South Africa]], and were thought by a South African linguist to have derived from an [[Afrikaans]] term.&lt;ref name="bauer"/&gt;

Many of the common truce terms recorded by the Bauers such as ''bags'', ''poison'', ''gates'', ''tags'', ''flicks'', are not listed by the Opies although they speculated that both ''bags'' and ''tags'' may derive from ''pax''.&lt;ref name="bauer"/&gt;

==United States==
In a study undertaken by historians Mary and Herbert Knapp in the 1970s, informants remembering terms from the 1930s reported ''kings X'' and ''kings''. The use of ''kings X'' before the 1930s is well-recorded.&lt;ref name=knapp/&gt; The 1985 edition of the ''[[Dictionary of American Regional English]]'' records the historical use of ''kings ex'', ''kings sax'', ''kings cruse'', ''kings excuse'' and ''kings'', chiefly west of the [[Mississippi River]], the Gulf States and [[Ohio Valley]]. The earliest recorded use cited in the dictionary is of ''kings cruse'' in 1778 during an adult fight.&lt;ref name="doare"&gt;{{citation|title=Dictionary of American Regional English|author= Gomes Cassidy F, Houston Hall J|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1985|isbn=978-0-674-20519-2|location=|pages=224–25|volume=III}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholarly speculation in the late nineteenth century postulated that ''kings X'' derived from ''kings truce'', rendered as ''kings cruse'' and then ''kings excuse'', becoming ''kings X'' as a shortened form.&lt;ref name=woodward&gt;{{citation|journal=Modern Language Notes|author=Woodward FC|title=Kings Cruse|volume=4|year=1889|pages=121–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Dictionary of American Regional English'' cites the Opies as a source for the derivation of the terms and states that ''exes'' probably refers to the use of crossed fingers, an important part of the demand for a truce, rather than deriving from "excuse" as originally thought.&lt;ref name="doare"/&gt; However, the Knapps state that although the Opies do not record ''kings X'' as such in the UK, they do record ''kings'', ''crosses'', ''exes'', ''cruse'' and ''truce''. They conclude that ''kings X'' derived from the users of ''kings'' and ''exes'' settling in the same areas of the US—the terms were then combined and shortened. ''Kings cruse'', once popular in the US, might be accounted for in a similar manner.&lt;ref name=knapp/&gt; ''Barley'' has been recorded as a truce term in [[Ohio]], [[Wisconsin]], and [[Virginia]].&lt;ref name="KatieWales"&gt;{{citation

The Knapps study in [[Monroe County, Indiana|Monroe County]], [[Indiana]], found ''time-out'' and ''times'' to be by far the most prevalent terms in the 1970s. Variations included ''I've got times'' and ''time''. Very few children reported the more traditional ''kings'', ''queens'' or ''I've got kings X''. The authors also reported that these terms were popular over many areas of the US and in American schools abroad. To be functional a truce term must be understood and honoured by most of the children playing together. ''Time-out'' clearly derives from the use of intermissions in [[Time-out (sport)|timed sport]]s and apparently came into the language with the popularization of organized or timed sports and with the advent of such sports in elementary schools and on television. Historically the earliest reports for the use of ''time-out'' or ''time'' as a truce term were 1935 and 1936. However, only a small number of respondents reported anything other than ''time-out'' and its derivatives in use during the 1960s. The few alternatives included ''pax'', ''safe'', ''base'' or ''home-base'' and ''freeze'' with one small area of ''fins'' ([[Mount Vernon, New York|Mount Vernon]]). The Knapps reported that ''time-out'' had, since the 1950s, supplanted ''kings ex'' as the most popular truce term.&lt;ref name=knapp/&gt;

The use of ''times'' rather than ''time-out'' and ''I've got times'' rather than ''I call time'' appears to have been influenced by older forms such as ''kings'' and ''I've got kings X''. There was also one report of ''times X''. Similarly derivatives of ''time-out'' are often accompanied by the traditional crossed fingers.&lt;ref name=knapp/&gt;

==France==
In [[France]] children use the word ''pouce'' as the equivalent of the English ''pax'' and the American ''time-out''. The literal translation of pouce is [[thumb]] or [[big toe]].&lt;ref name=larousse&gt;{{cite book|title=Larousse; Grand Dictionnaire, Francais-Anglais|year=1993|publisher=Larousse Bilingues|location=London, Edinburgh, Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"Lu !" is -- or was -- a common truce term in Châteauroux, central France, in the fifties and sixties.

==Gestures==
[[File:Thumb-up.jpg|right|thumb|In Scotland and France children hold up one or both thumbs]]
The Opies found that in England and Wales children usually held up [[crossed fingers]]. Sometimes crossing the fingers of both hands was required and occasionally the feet as well. The Opies found one area, [[Headington]], where sitting cross-legged was required. At [[Lydney]],  children could raise their right hand palm forward, whilst in [[Bradford-on-Avon]] the hand was held up with three fingers extended. In some parts of Scotland the custom was to put up one's thumbs, sometimes licking them first. This also occurred in a few places in [[Lancashire]].&lt;ref name="opie"/&gt; Anecdotally, the raising of a thumb may also accompany the use of ''pouce'' in France.

The 1988 Croydon study found a variety of gestures in common use. These were crossed fingers of one hand (44%), crossed fingers of both hands (26%), thumbs through fingers (6%) (boys only) and arms crossed across the chest (2%). Other gestures, reported in ones and twos, included miming an injection into the arm, licking the thumb, making a [[Time-out (sport)|T-shape]] with the hands, three fingers held up and the "Vulcan" sign from [[Star Trek]]. Virtually all schools reported the use of crossed fingers.&lt;ref name=roud/&gt;

The holding up of one hand with middle and index fingers crossed was the usual gesture found in New Zealand in 1999–2001. The T-shape was also used when saying ''time-out''.&lt;ref name="bauer"/&gt; The time-out gesture is made with two hands - one hand held horizontally, palm down, the other hand vertically with the fingertips touching the bottom of the horizontal hand. In the US, although the more modern ''time-out'' has largely supplanted traditional terms, often accompanied by the time-out gesture, the crossed fingers gesture remains common.&lt;ref name=knapp/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16822">'''True self''' (also known as '''real self''', '''authentic self''', '''original self''' and '''vulnerable self''') and '''false self''' (also known as '''fake self''', '''idealized self''', '''superficial self''' and '''pseudo self''') are psychological concepts often used in connection with [[narcissism]]. 

The concepts were introduced into [[psychoanalysis]] in 1960 by [[Donald Winnicott]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Ego distortion in terms of true and false self|last = Winnicott|first = D. W.|date = 1965|journal = The Maturational Process and the Facilitating Environment: Studies in the Theory of Emotional Development|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |pages = 140–57|publisher = International Universities Press, Inc|location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winnicott used true self to describe a sense of self based on spontaneous authentic experience, and a feeling of being alive, having a real self.&lt;ref&gt;[[Salman Akhtar]], ''Good Feelings'' (London 2009) p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; The false self, by contrast, Winnicott saw as a defensive façade&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; – one which in extreme cases could leave its holders lacking spontaneity and feeling dead and empty, behind a mere appearance of being real.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

To maintain their [[self-esteem]], and protect their vulnerable true selves, narcissists need to [[Abusive power and control|control]] others' behavior – particularly that of [[Narcissistic parent|their children]], seen as extensions of themselves.&lt;ref name=co&gt;Rappoport, Alan, Ph. D.[http://www.alanrappoport.com/pdf/Co-Narcissism%20Article.pdf Co-Narcissism: How We Adapt to Narcissism. The Therapist, 2005].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Winnicott saw the true self as rooted from early infancy in the experience of being alive, including blood pumping and lungs breathing – what Winnicott called simply being.&lt;ref name="Mary Jacobus 2005 p. 160"&gt;Mary Jacobus, ''The Poetics of Psychoanalysis'' (Oxford 2005) p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; Out of this, the baby creates the experience of a sense of [[reality]], a sense that life is worth living.  The baby's spontaneous, nonverbal gestures derive from that [[instinct]]ual sense,&lt;ref&gt;D. W. Winnicott, "Ego Distortion in Terms of True and false self ', in ''The Maturational Process and the Facilitating Environment'' (London 1965) p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; and if responded to by the mother, become the basis for the continuing development of the true self.

However, when what Winnicott was careful to describe as good enough parenting – i.e., not necessarily perfect!&lt;ref&gt;Simon Grolnick, ''The Work &amp; Play of Winnicott''  (New Jersey: Aronson 1990) p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; – was ''not'' in place, the infant's spontaneity was in danger of being encroached on by the need for compliance with the parents' wishes/expectations.&lt;ref&gt;Rosalind Minsky, ''Psychoanalysis and Gender'' (London 1996) p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; The result for Winnicott could be the creation of what he called the false self, where "Other people's expectations can become of overriding importance, overlaying or contradicting the original sense of self, the one connected to the very roots of one's being".&lt;ref&gt;Winnicott, quoted in Josephine Klein, ''Our Need for Others'' (London 1994) p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;  The danger he saw was that "through this false self, the infant builds up a false set of relationships, and by means of introjections even attains a show of being real",&lt;ref&gt;Winnicott, quoted in Josephine Klein, ''Our Need for Others'' (London 1994) p. 365&lt;/ref&gt; while, in fact, merely concealing a barren emptiness behind an independent-seeming façade.&lt;ref&gt;Rosalind Minsky, ''Psychoanalysis and Gender'' (London 1996) pp. 119–20&lt;/ref&gt;

The danger was particularly acute where the baby had to provide attunement for the mother/parents, rather than vice versa, building up a sort of dissociated recognition of the object on an impersonal, not personal and spontaneous basis.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips, ''On Kissing, Tickling and Being Bored'' (London 1994) pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt; But while such a pathological false self stifled the spontaneous gestures of the true self in favour of a lifeless imitation, Winnicott nevertheless considered it of vital importance in preventing something worse: the annihilating experience of the exploitation of the hidden true self itself.&lt;ref name="Mary Jacobus 2005 p. 160"/&gt;

==Precursors==
There was much in psychoanalytic theory on which Winnicott could draw for his concept of the false self. [[Helene Deutsch]] had described the "as if" personalities, with their pseudo relationships substituting for real ones.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 445&lt;/ref&gt; Winnicott's analyst, [[Joan Riviere]], had explored the concept of the narcissist's masquerade – superficial assent concealing a subtle hidden struggle for control.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Jacobus, ''The Poetics of Psychoanalysis: In the Wake of Klein'' (Oxford 2005) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; [[Freud]]'s own late theory of the ego as the product of identifications&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Ecrits: A Selection'' (London 1997) p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; came close to viewing it only as a false self;&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips, ''Winnicott'' (Harvard 1988) p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; while Winnicott's true/false distinction has also been compared to [[Michael Balint]]'s "basic fault" and to [[Ronald Fairbairn]]'s notion of the "compromised ego".&lt;ref&gt;J. H. Padel, "Freudianism: Later Developments", in Richard Gregory ed., ''The Oxford Companion to the Mind'' (Oxford 1987) p. 273&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Erich Fromm]], in his book ''[[The Fear of Freedom]]'' distinguished between original self and pseudo self – the inauthenticality of the latter being a way to escape the loneliness of freedom;&lt;ref&gt;Erich Fromm (1942), ''The Fear of Freedom'' (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul 2001) p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; while much earlier the existentialist like [[Kierkegaard]] had claimed that  "to will to be that self which one truly is, is indeed the opposite of despair" – the despair of choosing "to be another than himself".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[Carl Rogers]], ''On Becoming a Person'' (1961) p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karen Horney]], in her 1950 book, ''[[Neurosis and Human Growth]]'', based her idea of "true self" and "false self" through the view of self-improvement, interpreting it as real self and ideal self, with the real self being what one currently is and the ideal self being what one could become.&lt;ref name="horneyk"&gt;{{cite book | title=[[Neurosis and Human Growth]] | author=Horney, Karen | year=1950 | isbn=0-393-00135-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See also [[Karen Horney#Theory of the self|Karen Horney §&amp;nbsp;Theory of the self]]).

==Later developments==
The last half-century have seen Winnicott's ideas extended and applied in a variety of contexts, both in psychoanalysis and beyond.

===Kohut&lt;!--linked from 'Self psychology'--&gt;===
{{Main|Heinz Kohut}}
Kohut extended Winnicott's work in his investigation of narcissism,&lt;ref&gt;Eugene M. DeRobertis, ''Humanizing Child Development Theories'' (2008), p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; seeing narcissists as evolving a defensive armor around their damaged inner selves.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Malcolm, ''Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession'' (London 1988) p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; He considered it less pathological to identify with the damaged remnants of the self, than to achieve coherence through identification with an external personality at the cost of one's own autonomous creativity.&lt;ref&gt;Heinz Kohut, ''How Does Analysis Cure?'' (London 1984), pp. 142, 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lowen===
{{Main|Alexander Lowen}}
Alexander Lowen identified narcissists as having a true and a false, or superficial, self. The false self rests on the surface, as the self presented to the world. It stands in contrast to the true self, which resides behind the facade or image. This true self is the feeling self, but it is a self that must be hidden and denied. Since the superficial self represents submission and conformity, the inner or true self is rebellious and angry. This underlying rebellion and anger can never be fully suppressed since it is an expression of the life force in that person. But because of the [[denial]], it cannot be expressed directly. Instead it shows up in the narcissist's [[acting out]]. And it can become a perverse force.&lt;ref&gt;Lowen, Alexander. ''Narcissism: Denial of the true self''. Simon &amp; Schuster, 2004, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Masterson===
{{Main|James F. Masterson}}
James F. Masterson argued that all the [[personality disorders]] crucially involve the conflict between a person's two selves: the false self, which the very young child constructs to please the mother, and the true self. The psychotherapy of personality disorders is an attempt to put people back in touch with their real selves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/obituaries/articles/2010/04/20/dr_james_masterson_expert_on_personality_disorders_at_84/ Dr. James Masterson, expert on personality disorders; at 84]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symington===
{{Main|Neville Symington}}
Symington developed Winnicott's contrast between true and false self to cover the ''sources'' of personal action, contrasting an autonomous and a discordant source of action – the latter drawn from the internalisation of external influences and pressures.&lt;ref&gt;Neville Symington, ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (London 2003) pp. 36, 115&lt;/ref&gt; Thus for example parental dreams of self-glorification by way of their child's achievements can be internalised as an alien discordant source of action.&lt;ref&gt;Polly Young-Eisandrath, ''Women and Desire'' (London 2000) pp. 112, 198&lt;/ref&gt; Symington stressed however the ''intentional'' element in the individual's abandoning the autonomous self in favour of a false self or narcissistic mask – something he considered Winnicott to have overlooked.&lt;ref&gt;Neville Symington, ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (London 2003) p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vaknin===
As part of what has been described as a personal mission by self-confessed narcissist and author [[Sam Vaknin]] to raise the profile of the condition.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Crompton, ''All about Me: Loving a Narcissist'' (London 2007) p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Vaknin has highlighted the role of the false self in narcissism. The false self replaces the narcissist's true self and is intended to shield him from hurt and [[narcissistic injury]] by self-imputing omnipotence. The narcissist pretends that his false self is real and demands that others affirm this confabulation, meanwhile keeping his real imperfect true self under wraps.&lt;ref&gt;Vaknin S [http://samvak.tripod.com/faq48.html The Dual Role of the Narcissist's False Self]&lt;/ref&gt;

For Vaknin, the false self is by far more important to the narcissist than his dilapidated, dysfunctional true self; and in contrast to the psychoanalysts he does not believe in the ability to resuscitate it through therapy.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Vaknin/Lidija Rangelovska ''Malignant Self-Love'' (2003) pp. 187–88&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miller===
{{Main|Alice Miller (psychologist)}}
Alice Miller cautiously warns that a child/patient may not have ''any'' formed true self, waiting behind the false self facade;&lt;ref&gt;Alice Miller, ''The Drama of the Gifted Child'' (2004) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; and that as a result freeing the true self is not as simple as the Winnicottian image of the butterfly emerging from its cocoon.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Malcolm, ''Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession'' (London 1988) p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;  If a true self can be developed, however, she considered that the empty [[grandiosity]] of the false self could give way to a new sense of autonomous vitality.&lt;ref&gt;Alice Miller, ''The Drama of Being a Child'' (2004) p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orbach: false bodies===
{{Main|Susie Orbach}}

Susie Orbach saw the false self as an overdevelopment (under parental pressure) of certain aspects of the self at the expense of other aspects – of the full potential of the self – producing thereby an abiding distrust of what emerges spontaneously from the individual himself or herself.&lt;ref&gt;Susie Orbach, ''Bodies'' (London 2009) p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; Orbach went on to extend Winnicott's account of how environmental failure can lead to an inner splitting of mind and body,&lt;ref&gt;D. W. Winnicott, ''Winnicott on the Child'' (2002) p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; so as to cover the idea of the false body –  falsified sense of one's own body.&lt;ref&gt;Susie Orbach, ''The Impossibility of Sex'' (Penguin 1999) pp. 48, 216&lt;/ref&gt; Orbach saw the female false body in particular as built upon identifications with others, at the cost of an inner sense of authenticity and reliability.&lt;ref&gt;Susie Orbach, in Lawrence Spurling ed., ''Winnicott Studies'' (1995) p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Breaking up a monolithic but false body-sense in the process of therapy could allow for the emergence of a range of authentic (even if often painful) body feelings in the patient.&lt;ref&gt;Susie Orbach, ''Bodies'' (London 2009) pp. 67–72&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jungian persona===
{{Main|Carl Jung}}
Jungians have explored the overlap between Jung's concept of the [[Persona (psychology)|persona]] and Winnicott's false self;&lt;ref&gt;Mario Jacoby, ''Shame and the Origins of Self-Esteem'' (1996) pp. 59–60&lt;/ref&gt; but, while noting similarities, consider that only the most rigidly defensive persona approximates to the pathological status of the false self.&lt;ref&gt;Polly Young-Eisendrath/James Albert Hall, ''Jung's Self Psychology'' (1991) p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stern's tripartite self&lt;!--linked from 'Daniel Stern (psychologist)'--&gt;===
{{Main|Daniel Stern (psychologist)}}

Daniel Stern considered Winnicott's sense of "going on being" as constitutive of the core, pre-verbal self.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Stern, ''[[The Interpersonal World of the Infant]]'' (1985) pp. 7, 93&lt;/ref&gt; He also explored how language could be used to reinforce a false sense of self, leaving the true self linguistically opaque and disavowed.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Stern, ''[[The Interpersonal World of the Infant]]'' (1985) p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; He ended however by proposing a three-fold division of social, private, and of disavowed self.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Jacobs, ''D. W. Winnicott'' (1995) p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
[[Neville Symington]] criticised Winnicott for failing to integrate his false self insight with the theory of [[Id, ego, and super-ego|ego and id]].&lt;ref&gt;Neville Symington, ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (London 2003) p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, continental analysts like [[Jean-Bertrand Pontalis]] have made use of true/false self as a ''clinical'' distinction, while having reservations about its theoretical status.&lt;ref&gt;V. R. Sherwood/C. P. Cohen, ''Psychotherapy of the Quiet Borderline Patient'' (1994) p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] took issue more broadly with the concept of a true self on the [[anti-essentialism|anti-essentialist]] grounds that the self was a construct – something one had to evolve through a process of subjectification, an ''aesthetics'' of self-formation, not something simply waiting to be uncovered:&lt;ref&gt;Paul Rabinov ed., ''The Foucault Reader'' (1991) p. 362&lt;/ref&gt; "we have to create ourselves as a work of art".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Jon Simons ed. ''Contemporary Critical Theorists'' (2006) p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary examples==

* ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'' has been interpreted in terms of the true self's struggle to break through the conventional overlay.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara A Schapiro, ''Literature and the Relational Self'' (1995) p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Sylvia Plath]]'s poetry has been interpreted in terms of the conflict of the true and false selves.&lt;ref&gt;J. Kroll, ''Chapters in a Mythology'' (2007) pp. 182–84&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tugen''' is the language spoken by the about 200,000 [[Tugen people|Tugen]] people of the broader [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]] group in [[Kenya]]. As a part of the [[Kalenjin language|Kalenjin]] dialect cluster, it is most closely related to such varieties as [[Kipsigis language|Kipsigis]] and [[Naandi language|Nandi]].

The Tugen is made up of three main sub-groups, the Lembus to the south, the Arror in the north and the Samor in the central parts of Baringo district, Kenya.

'''Twitchers' vocabulary''' is the set of [[jargon]] words used by [[twitcher]]s.  Twitchers are committed bird-watchers who travel long distances to see a new species to add a species their "[[lifelist]]", "year list" or other lists. Some terms may be specific to regional birding communities, and not all are used due to dialectic and cultural differences.&lt;ref name=Aus&gt;Anon. 2008. "The A to Z of birding." Australian Geographic 90: 104-105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PS&gt;Saha, Purbita. "The Audubon Dictionary for Birders" http://www.audubon.org/news/the-audubon-dictionary-birders&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NS&gt;Swick, Nate. "The Birder Jargon Dictionary" https://thedrinkingbirdblog.com/the-birder-jargon-dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Terms ==

* ''Big Day'': a birding event in which a birder or team of birders tries to see as many species of birds as possible within a calendar day.&lt;ref name="NS"/&gt;
* ''Big Year'': a birding event in which a birder tries to see as many species of birds as possible within a defined area (county, state, ABA area, etc.) within a calendar year; originated with the American Birding Association, and the basis for the movie ''[[The Big Year]]''.&lt;ref name="NS"/&gt;
* To ''burn up'' or ''flog'': to beat around in the undergrowth hoping to flush a bird.  A desperate measure and not a kind way to treat an exhausted migrant.&lt;ref name="BO"&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Bill Oddie|Oddie]]|first=Bill|title=Bill Oddie's Little Black Bird Book|year=1980|publisher=[[Methuen Publishing]]|isbn=0-413-49480-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''BVD'' (UK): "Better View Desired", describing a lifer that was observed well enough to identify, but not enjoy.&lt;ref name="NS"/&gt;
* ''CBC'': [[Christmas Bird Count]].
* ''Chooks'' (Australia): already seen or common birds.&lt;ref name=Aus/&gt;
* ''Crippler'' (UK): a rare and spectacular bird that shows brilliantly, perhaps an allusion towards its preventing people from moving on.
*''Crush'' (verb, U.S.): to get very high-quality photos of a bird. See ''hammer''
* ''Dip'' (or ''dip out''): to miss seeing a bird which you were looking for.
* ''Dude'': "a  bird-watcher who doesn't really know all that much about birds."&lt;ref name="BO"/&gt; A novice birdwatcher; slightly pejorative term.  Also used to refer to someone who primarily seeks out birds for photography rather than study.&lt;ref name=Aus/&gt;
* ''Empid'' (US): any of the flycatchers of the genus ''Empidonax'', infamous among North American birders for being difficult to identify in the field without the aid of vocalizations.
* ''Fallout'': a natural occurrence where migratory birds are forced down by adverse weather in a way that makes them congregate in large numbers; generally associated with meteorological and geographical conditions (exclusively in spring, generally in the United States along the Texas and Florida coasts of the Gulf of Mexico).&lt;ref name="NS"/&gt; 
* ''First'': a first record of a species (in a defined area, such as a [[county]] first).&lt;ref name="BO"/&gt;
* ''Grip'' (or ''grip off'') (UK): to see a bird which another birder missed and to tell them you've seen it.&lt;ref name="BO"/&gt;
* ''Hammer'' (US): to get high-quality photos of a bird.
* [[Jizz (birding)|''Jizz'' or ''giss'']]: the overall impression given by the general shape, movement, behaviour, etc., of a species rather than any particular feature. Experienced birders can often identify species, even with only fleeting or distant views, on jizz alone.
* ''LBJ'' (or ''little brown job''): drab songbirds that are difficult to differentiate and identify.&lt;ref name="PS"/&gt;
*''LC'' (noun; local U.S., San Francisco Bay Area): the action of reporting vagrants suspiciously often, most of the time without photos or audio. As in: ''“Did you see that LC of an Eastern Yellow Wagtail? They couldn’t make it more obvious that they didn’t actually see a wagtail, but were instead just trying to increase their life list.”''
* ''Lifer'': a first-ever sighting of a bird species by an observer; an addition to one's ''life list''.&lt;ref name="BO"/&gt;
* ''List'':
** Noun: a list of all species seen by a particular observer (often qualified, e.g. ''life list'', ''county list'', ''year list'', etc.). Keen twitchers may keep several lists, and some listers compete to amass longer lists than their rivals.
**Verb: to keep or compile a bird list (''lister'' describes someone who is intensely focused on keeping and growing lists, and can be used negatively).
* ''m.ob.'' or ''mob'' or ''MOB'': an abbreviation that stands for "many observers," often used as a collective noun
* ''Mega'' or ''megatick'' often spelled ''meguh'': a very rare bird&lt;ref name="BO"/&gt; 
* ''Nemesis'' (or ''nemesis bird''): a bird that has eluded a birder despite multiple attempts to see it.&lt;ref name="NS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PS"/&gt; 
* ''Patagonia Picnic Table Effect'' (or ''Patagonia Roadside Rest Effect'') (US): the phenomenon that occurs when one bird draws many birders to a remote area, who then find more rarities and other interesting species in that same location.  Named after an actual roadside rest area just west of [[Patagonia, Arizona]].&lt;ref name="PS"/&gt; 
* ''Patch'' (or ''local patch''): a birding location or set of birding locations near one's home that a birder visits frequently.&lt;ref name="NS"/&gt;
* ''Pelagic'' (noun): a boat trip designed for birders to find open-ocean (pelagic) species, such as albatrosses.
* ''Pish'' (US): an emphatic shushing or hissing noise used by North American birders to elicit mobbing behavior; made in imitation of alarm calls of chickadees and titmice.&lt;ref name="NS"/&gt;
* ''Peep'' (US): a collective term for the five smallest North American ''[[Calidris]]'' sandpipers: [[least sandpiper]], [[semipalmated sandpiper]], [[Western sandpiper]], [[white-rumped sandpiper]], and [[Baird's sandpiper]]&lt;ref name="NS"/&gt;
* ''Plastic'' (UK): adjective used to indicate a bird which has escaped from captivity, rather than a genuinely wild bird.
* ''Sibe'' (US): a bird from [[Siberia]] (usually applied to rare migrants).&lt;ref name="BO"/&gt; 
* ''Siesta time'' (also ''the doldrums'') (US): the period in mid-afternoon when birds (and therefore birders) are least active. &lt;ref name="PS"/&gt; 
* ''Slash'': a term used to describe cryptic species pairs not identifiable to species (on a day list), ie. [[long-billed dowitcher]]/[[short-billed dowitcher]], [[willow flycatcher]]/[[alder flycatcher]]&lt;ref name="NS"/&gt; 
* ''SOB'': "Spouse of Birder", a non-birder spouse.&lt;ref name="PS"/&gt; 
* ''Spark bird'': a species that triggers a lifelong obsession with birding.&lt;ref name="PS" /&gt;
* ''Spuh'': a term used to describe birds only identifiable to genus level (on a day list) (from "sp.", abbreviated form of species).
* ''String'':
**Noun: a dubious, "ropy" record.
**Adjective: ''Stringy''&lt;ref name="BO"/&gt;
**Verb: to claim such a record.&lt;ref name="BO"/&gt; 
*** Note: the term ''stringer'' is usually used to denote people who intentionally mislead and falsify bird sightings, as opposed to well-intentioned mistakes made from lack of field experience.&lt;ref name="NS"/&gt;
* ''Tick'': an addition to a personal list (sometimes qualified as ''year tick'', ''county tick'', etc.). ''Life tick'' and ''lifer'' are synonymous. a ''tart's tick'' is a relatively common species added to one's list later than might be expected.&lt;ref name="BO"/&gt; 
* ''Twitch'': the act of traveling a long distance to see a rare bird.  Synonymous with ''chase''.
* ''Vagrant'': a stray far from normal ecological range.&lt;ref name="PS"/&gt; 
* ''Warbler Neck'' (US): a painful crick in the neck from looking at birds high in the treetops. Named after the [[New World warblers]], which are often found in the tops of trees.
* ''Yank'' (UK): a bird from [[North America]] (usually applied to vagrants seen in Europe).
* ''Zootie'' (US, uncommon): a locally rare or unusual bird.&lt;ref name="NS"/&gt; 

Some species have nicknames, for example: "''RB Flicker''" for [[Red-breasted Flycatcher]], "''Gropper''" for [[Grasshopper Warbler]], "''[[PG Tips]]''" for [[Pallas's Grasshopper Warbler]]; in the US, these are generally reserved for common species ("TV" for [[Turkey Vulture]] or "butterbutt" for [[Yellow-rumped Warbler]]). Every bird found in the US has a formal, four-letter banding code formed with the first letters of its name (for example, [[Carolina Chickadee]] is CACH), and these abbreviated species terms often find their way into American slang. Twitchers (and birders in general) will also use a mixture of scientific and slang terms for feather tracts and so on.

'''Yokohama Pidgin Japanese''', '''Yokohamese''' or '''Japanese Ports Lingo''' was a [[Japanese language|Japanese]]-based [[pidgin]] spoken in the [[Yokohama]] area during the late 19th century for communication between Japanese and foreigners. Most information on Yokohama Pidgin comes from ''Exercises in the Yokohama Dialect'', a humorous pamphlet published in 1879 by [[Hoffman Atkinson]].
