The '''400-Mile Yard Sale''', sometimes referred to as the '''Highway 68 Yard Sale''', is an outdoor [[second-hand]] sale held annually for four days, beginning in the first weekend of June. It takes place along [[U.S. Route 68 in Kentucky|U.S. Route 68]] (US&amp;nbsp;68) in the US state of [[Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.400mile.com/ |title=400-Mile Sale Across Kentucky Along Historic Hwy&amp;nbsp;68 |publisher=400-Mile Sale |date= |access-date= June 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is held in almost all areas along the US&amp;nbsp;68 corridor from the east side of [[Paducah, Kentucky|Paducah]] through central Kentucky, and ending at [[Maysville, Kentucky|Maysville]].&lt;ref name=400-milesale-locations&gt;{{cite web|url=http://400mile.com/locations.html |title= Yard Sale Locations |publisher= 400-Mile Sale |date= |access-date= June 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2011, the 400-Mile Yard Sale route added [[Kentucky Route 80]] (KY&amp;nbsp;80) from [[Aurora, Kentucky|Aurora]] to [[Murray, Kentucky|Murray]], in [[Calloway County, Kentucky|Calloway]] and [[Marshall County, Kentucky|Marshall]] counties in Kentucky.

Historically, the 400-mile sale boosts the economy of most localities along the route, most notably in [[Glasgow, Kentucky|Glasgow]], the county seat in [[Barren County, Kentucky|Barren County]], as that area has the highest economical impact annually, especially with the [[Glasgow Highland Games]] taking place during the same weekend as the sale.&lt;ref name=gdt16&gt;Perkins, Will (2016). [http://www.glasgowdailytimes.com/news/business-booms-in-glasgow-with-highland-games--mile-yard/article_e7dcae46-29df-11e6-b1fd-838e3226303f.html "Glasgow biz booms this weekend"]. Glasgow Daily Times, June 4, 2016, page A-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further information==

===Areas exempt from the event===
A {{convert|10|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} stretch of the [[Concurrency (road)|concurrently running]] US&amp;nbsp;68 and KY&amp;nbsp;80 in the [[Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area]] in western [[Trigg County, Kentucky|Trigg County]] is excluded from the yard sale route because the recreation area is the property of a government organization, the [[U.S. Forest Service]]. Another gap in the sale route, a {{convert|20|mi|km|adj=mid|long}} stretch of US&amp;nbsp;68 in [[Lexington, Kentucky|Metropolitan Lexington]] and [[Fayette County, Kentucky|Fayette County]] is also excluded on account of high traffic volume, especially in downtown Lexington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= 400-Mile Sale Brochure |year= 2013 |type= Pamphlet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Events in the area===
A town-wide yard sale in the eastern [[Warren County, Kentucky|Warren County]] town of [[Smiths Grove, Kentucky|Smiths Grove]] is often held during the US&amp;nbsp;68 Yard Sale just off the highway. [[Elkton, Kentucky|Elkton]], the [[Todd County, Kentucky|Todd County]] seat also has a lot of yard sales during the event, even if on other streets.&lt;ref name=400-milesale-locations/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date= April 15, 2015 |url=http://elktonky.com/events/400-mile-yard-sale/ |title=400-Mile Sale and Elkton Yard Sale Days |publisher= Elkton, Kentucky |access-date= June 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elktonky.com/category/events/ |title= 400-Mile Sale and Elkton Yard Sale Days 2015 |publisher=Elkton, Kentucky |date= |access-date= June 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Glasgow Highland Games]] at [[Barren River Lake State Resort Park]], well south of the US 68 corridor along [[US Route 31E]], is typically held during the same weekend as the 400 mile yard sale.&lt;ref name=gdt16/&gt;

'''''An Acquaintance with Darkness''''' is a historical fiction novel by [[Ann Rinaldi]]. It is part of the [[Great Episodes]] series. It is told in [[first-person narration]].

==Plot summary==
''An Acquaintance with Darkness'' is the story of 14-year-old Emily Pigbush  who lives with her mother in Washington, D.C., in 1865. Emily's father died during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] while fighting for the Union. Now the Pigbushes' final servant, Ella May, has left because she was freed, leaving Emily to care for her mother alone. However, Emily sometimes has the help of her close friend, sixteen-year-old Annie Surratt and Annie's brother Johnny a twenty-year-old, whose mother runs the boarding house across the street.

Emily's mother is near death, and Emily hopes to go live with Annie afterward her mother dies because her father has died in a battle of Charleston. Emily's mother's only wish is that Emily at all costs ''not'' live with her uncle, Dr. Valentine Bransby, after her death. Soon, Emily's mother dies after hearing that the Civil War was over. But then, on April 15, 1865, President [[Abraham Lincoln]] is assassinated by [[John Wilkes Booth]] in [[Ford Theatre]]. Mrs. [[Mary Surratt]], Annie's mother, comes under suspicion of the authorities, as she may have harbored Booth; [[John Surratt|Johnny Surrat]] is also wanted by the police for possibly being involved in the assassination. On Annie's advice, Emily reluctantly goes to live with her uncle, Dr. Valentine Bransby.

Living with Uncle Valentine, Emily learns that Valentine is actually quite a talented doctor who strives for more discoveries in the medical field with the changing times. Emily meets Valentine's assistant, Marietta, his housekeeper, Maude, and Maude's dwarf husband, Merry. She also meets Robert deGraaf, Valentine's medical student. As Emily later figures out, Valentine, Marietta, Robert, and Maude are involved in [[body snatching]] (cadaver theft) in Washington.

Emily is at first disgusted by Valentine's deeds. However, after helping obtain an illegal body for her uncle for medical purposes, Emily realizes that her uncle is stealing bodies with the purpose of helping advance the medical field and saving more lives. Meanwhile, [[Mary Surratt|Mrs. Surratt]], is publicly hanged along with several other accomplices, and Valentine, Robert, Annie, and Emily attend the execution. Annie sells her house and flees Washington, changing her name, and leaving Emily behind. In the end, Emily tells Robert that she would like to become a nurse one day and he replies that she can not only become a nurse, but a doctor instead.

'''Anatolian Tigers''' ({{lang-tr|Anadolu Kaplanları}}) is a term internationally used in the context of the [[Turkish economy]] to refer to and to explain the [[phenomenon]] of a number of cities in [[Turkey]] which have displayed impressive growth records since the 1980s, as well as to a defined new breed of entrepreneurs rising in prominence and who can often be traced back to the cities in question and who generally rose from the status of [[Small and medium enterprises|SMEs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Anatolian Tigers or Islamic Capital: Prospects and Challenges |first1=Ömer |last1=Demir |first2=Mustafa |last2=Acar |first3=Metin |last3=Toprak |journal=Middle Eastern Studies |volume=40 |date=2004 |issue=6 |pages = 166–188|doi=10.1080/0026320042000282937}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Where particular cities are concerned, the term is most often used for the capitals or depending centers of [[Denizli]], [[Gaziantep]], [[Kayseri]], [[Bursa]], [[Konya]], [[Kocaeli Province|Kocaeli]], [[Kahramanmaraş]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://mondediplo.com/1997/07/turkey | title = New Faces of Islam|author =Wendy Christianasen|publisher=[[Le Monde Diplomatique]]| accessdate=1997-07| date = July 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within Turkey, the accent is laid on cities that have received little state investments or subsidies over the years. [[Çorum]], [[Denizli]], [[Gaziantep]] and [[Kahramanmaraş]], in particular, are cited among the cities who "made it themselves". In time order, while Denizli in Turkey's [[Aegean Region, Turkey|Aegean Region]] was the early hour precursor for rapid growth in an Anatolian Tiger pattern,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://wz.uni.lodz.pl/ersa/abstr/ozgur_p.pdf |work=18th European Advanced Studies Institute in Regional Science |title=Integration of a Local Economy to the Global and European Markets through Export–Led Growth and Specialized Textile Products Export: Home Textile Production in Denizli – Turkey |author=Hüseyin Özgür |publisher=[[University of Lodz]] |access-date=2007-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gaziantep]], [[Malatya]], [[Konya]] and [[Kayseri]] are the most recently cited prominent Tigers on the basis of the number of companies they have among Turkey's 500 biggest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://search.ft.com/iab?queryText=Konya&amp;id=061120005054&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fsearch.ft.com%2FftArticle%3FqueryText%3DKonya%26id%3D061120005054&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com.tr%2Fsearch%3Fq%3D%22anatolian+tigers%22 | title= Anatolian Tigers: Regions prove plentiful | author= Pelin Turgut | publisher= [[Financial Times]] | accessdate= 2006-11-20 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090820000758/http://search.ft.com/iab?queryText=Konya&amp;id=061120005054&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fsearch.ft.com%2FftArticle%3FqueryText%3DKonya%26id%3D061120005054&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com.tr%2Fsearch%3Fq%3D%22anatolian+tigers%22 | archive-date= 2009-08-20 | dead-url= yes | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; These largest are the forerunners of further large companies and a multitude of smaller ones.

Aside from their production units, the definition generally excludes companies who have their headquarters in the largest cities of Turkey; namely [[İstanbul]], [[Ankara]], [[İzmir]], [[Bursa]] and [[Adana]], as well as companies constituted with public capital. 

The term is also echoed, in the form "Anatolian Lions" (Turkish: ''Anadolu Aslanları''), by the name of the private sector association [http://www.askon.org.tr Askon] that brings together businessmen from a number of other cities who have found common grounds between each other. This association has branches in [[Ankara]], [[Burdur]], [[Bursa]], [[Gebze]], [[İzmit]], [[Konya]], [[Malatya]] and [[Trabzon]]. These lions are less often cited among the tigers for several reasons.

Other variations of the term, such "Turkey's Tigers" or "Turkish Tigers", as used by the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] without excluding the most commonly used form of "Anatolian Tigers" have also been pronounced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/wideangle/shows/turkey/filmmaker.html |title = Wide Angle: Turkey's Tigers|author1=Jon Alpert |author2=Matthew O'Neill |work=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]| accessdate=2007-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2006/08/15/DI2006081500692.html?nav=rss_business/international |title=Wide Angle: Turkey's Tigers|author1=Jon Alpert |author2=Matthew O'Neill |newspaper=[[Washington Post]]| accessdate=2006-08-23 | date=2006-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond their shared characteristics in an economical perspective, references have also been made, especially in international media, to different political connotations within the term, including by associating this capital with [[Islam]]ic values or extending its whole under such definitions as "Islamic capital" or "green capital". The political choices and the voting trends of the cities and of particulars in question may differ widely between each other. A 2005 study by the [http://www.esiweb.org European Stability Initiative] that was focused on [[Kayseri]] uses the term "Islamic [[Calvinists]]" to define the entrepreneurs and their values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.esiweb.org/pdf/esi_document_id_69.pdf |title=Islamic Calvinists: Change and Conservatism in Central Anatolia |author =ESI |work=European Stability Initiative, Berlin |accessdate=2005-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Several business awards or conferences in Turkey draw reference from the term "Anatolian Tigers" or its variants. 

The term was copied after the ''[[Four Asian Tigers|Asian Tigers]]''.

==Geographical distribution==
According to the 2005 Istanbul Chamber of Industry's annual ranking of Turkey's top 1000 industrial enterprises,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.iso.org.tr/en/index.asp Istanbul Chamber of Industry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427134015/http://www2.iso.org.tr/en/index.asp |date=2007-04-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the adjacent table contains cities which best fit the definition of Anatolian Tigers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.iso.org.tr/en/500buyuk_Default.asp Istanbul Chamber of Industry: Turkey's Top 1000 Industrial Enterprises] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070423020204/http://www2.iso.org.tr/en/500buyuk_Default.asp |date=2007-04-23 }}. The table excludes the [[Thrace]]-[[İstanbul]]-[[Bursa]]-[[Eskişehir]]-[[Ankara]] axis, the highly integrated [[İzmir]]-[[Manisa]]-[[Aydın]] and [[Çukurova]] regions, as well as the Turkish coastline until the [[coal]] basin in the western [[Black Sea Region, Turkey|Black Sea Region]]. [[Southeastern Anatolia Project]] region, included in the count, currently displays only the first signs of its potential industrial might. Likewise, the recent opening of continuous highway along the [[Black Sea]] coast is expected to deeply influence the fortunes of the region along the shoreline. Aside those mentioned in the table, the urban centers who to date have one company that is represented among Turkey's top 1000 were: [[Bafra]], [[Bucak, Burdur|Bucak]], [[Bulancak]], [[Çarşamba]], [[Çorum]], [[Diyarbakır]], [[Elazığ]], [[Erzurum]], [[İnebolu]], [[Kars]], [[Kastamonu]], [[Kırşehir]], [[Mardin]], [[Rize]], [[Siirt]], [[Sivas]], [[Suluova]], [[Tokat]] and [[Yozgat]].&lt;/ref&gt; Among these cities [[Trabzon]] has one company in top 25.

The '''Battle of Lake Regillus''' was a legendary Roman victory over the [[Latin League]] shortly after the establishment of the [[Roman Republic]] and as part of a wider [[Latin War (498–493 BC)|Latin War]].  The Latins were led by an elderly [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]], the seventh and last [[King of Rome]], who had been expelled in 509 BC, and his son-in-law, [[Octavius Mamilius]], the dictator of [[Tusculum]].  The battle marked the final attempt of the Tarquins to reclaim their throne.  According to legend, [[Castor and Pollux]] fought on the side of the Romans.&lt;ref name=Grant37&gt;Grant,'' The History of Rome'', p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The threat of invasion by Rome's former allies in Latium led to the appointment of [[Aulus Postumius Albus Regillensis|Aulus Postumius Albus]] as [[Roman dictator|dictator]].

The year in which the battle occurred is unclear, and has been since ancient times.  Livy places the battle in 499 BC, but says some of his sources also suggest the battle occurred during Postumius' consulship in 496 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 2#19|2.19-21]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sinnigen 1977, p. 46"&gt;Sinnigen, William G and Boak, Arthur E R, A History of Rome to AD 565, 6th ed,1977, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;  The other major source for this historical period, [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] &lt;ref&gt;Dion. Hal. 1.66 Retrieved from http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus/1C*.html
&lt;/ref&gt; also places the battle in 496 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, ''The Beginnings of Rome'', p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern authors have also suggested 493 BC&lt;ref name=Grant37/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]'', [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]], Editor&lt;/ref&gt; or 489 BC.&lt;ref name="Sinnigen 1977, p. 46"/&gt;

Lake Regillus was located in the relic of a volcanic crater between Rome and Tusculum.  The lake was drained in the fourth century BC.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

According to Livy, the [[Volsci]] (a neighbouring tribe to the south of Latium) had raised troops to send to the aid of the Latins against Rome, however the haste of the Roman dictator in joining battle meant that the Volscian forces did not arrive in time.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 2#22|2.22]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battle==
The dictator Postumius led the Roman infantry, while [[Titus Aebutius Elva]] was [[Master of the Horse#Magister Equitum (Ancient Rome)|Master of the Horse]].  Tarquin was accompanied by his eldest and last remaining son, [[Titus Tarquinius|Titus]].  It was said that the presence of the Tarquinii caused the Romans to fight more passionately than in any previous battle.

Early in the battle, the king was injured attacking Postumius.  The magister equitum charged at Mamilius, and both were wounded: Aebutius in the arm, and the Latin dictator in the chest.  The magister equitum had to withdraw from the field, and direct his troops from a distance.  The king's soldiers, including many exiled Romans, began to overpower the republican forces, and the Romans suffered a setback when [[Marcus Valerius Volusus]] (consul in 505 BC) was killed by a spear while attacking Titus Tarquinius, but Postumius brought fresh troops from his own bodyguard, and halted the exiles' progress.

Meanwhile, [[Titus Herminius Aquilinus]], who had won fame fighting alongside [[Horatius Cocles|Horatius]] at the [[Pons Sublicius#Horatius Cocles at the bridge|Sublician bridge]], and served as consul in 506 BC, engaged Mamilius and slew him; but while attempting to strip his fallen enemy and claim the spoils, Herminius was killed by a javelin.  As the outcome of the battle seemed in doubt, Postumius ordered the cavalry to dismount and attack on foot, forcing the Latins to retreat and capturing the Latin camp.  Tarquin and the Latin army abandoned the field, resulting in a decisive Roman victory.  Postumius returned to Rome with his army, and celebrated a triumph.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ''[[Ab urbe condita libri (Livy)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'' [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 2#19|2.19-20]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Fasti Triumphales]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular legend reported that the [[Dioscuri]], Castor and Pollux, fought alongside the Romans, transfigured as two young horsemen.  Postumius ordered a [[Temple of Castor and Pollux|temple]] built in their honour in the [[Roman Forum]], in the place where they had watered their horses.

In the nineteenth century, the battle was celebrated in [[Thomas Macaulay|Thomas Macaulay's]] ''[[Lays of Ancient Rome]]''.

On 18 March 2015, the day of the opening of the [[Seat of the European Central Bank]], Blockupy organized a major protest in Frankfurt attended by between 17,000 and 20,000 people from Germany and other parts of Europe, including 10,000 people at the main rally.&lt;ref name="scmp-18032015"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/world/article/1741249/blockupy-protesters-clash-police-new-ecb-headquarters-frankfurt|title=‘Blockupy’ protesters clash with police at new ECB headquarters in Frankfurt|work=SCMP|date=18 March 2015|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reuters-15032015"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/03/15/uk-ecb-protest-idUKKBN0MB0HR20150315|title=Thousands to protest in Frankfurt against ECB 'austerity'|work=Reuters|date=15 March 2015|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hr-170000"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hr-online.de/website/rubriken/nachrichten/indexhessen34938.jsp?rubrik=91009&amp;key=standard_document_54812349|title=17.000 demonstrieren gegen EZB|work=Hessischer Rundfunk|date=19 March 2015|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Seat of the European Central Bank, the ECB's new headquarters, was selected as the venue for the demonstration so as to highlight the contradiction between the ECB's lavish spending on its own US$1.4-billion building while forcing cuts and market reforms on countries like [[Greece]] and [[Cyprus]].&lt;ref name="guardian-18032015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="scmp-18032015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="reuters-15032015"/&gt; Ulrich Wilken, an organiser, said: “Our protest is against the ECB, as a member of the troika, that, despite the fact that it is not democratically elected, hinders the work of the Greek government.

[[File:Queen Micaela.jpg|thumb|right|120px|A Carnival Queen from [[California]], United States, 2008.]]
'''Carnival Queen''', or sometimes '''Carnaval Queen''', is the name or title given to a woman or a girl who is chosen to perform official duties during the celebration of the [[Carnival]], a festive season which occurs immediately before [[Lent]] wherein the main events are usually held annually in February. The title is also given to a woman or a girl who has won the beauty and talent competition during the Carnival, or a woman who won a beauty and talent contest and thus become the representative during the celebration of the Carnival. 

One notable place in [[Spain]] that elects a new [[Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife|Carnival]] Queen every year is [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]]. On the other hand, the Carnival in [[Tarragona]] - also in Spain - starts with the building of a huge barrel and the later ends with the burning of that barrel together with the burning of the [[effigies]] of the Carnival Queen and the [[Carnival King]], a symbolic ritual that signifies bidding "farewell to the [[flesh]]" (literally "to remove meat") by men and women - such as from their diet - before the Lenten season, a form of human renewal, because meat or the "flesh" is prohibited during Lent.&lt;ref name="Online Etymology Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Carnival |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=12 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conflicts have resulted in injuries, property damage, and arrests, and both bicyclists and motorized vehicle drivers have been victims. Critics say that Critical Mass, held primarily in large [[Metropolitan area|metropolitan]] cities, is a deliberate attempt to obstruct automotive [[traffic]] and disrupt normal [[city]] functions, when individuals taking part refuse to obey [[Traffic code|traffic laws]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Winnipeg Sun|url=http://winnipegsun.com/News/Columnists/MacFarlane_Gord/2006/08/06/1722420.html|title=Critical Mass protesters too critical|author=Gord MacFarlane|date=August 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; while participants variously consider it a celebration of cycling, of cyclists' rights, and a practical re-imagining of urban space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Wiley|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kk_9vDOoU0QC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;lpg=PA137&amp;dq=%22critical+mass%22+cycling+proponents&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZKCg-xJ4rg&amp;sig=P-D5jGWsh5n5YoHJPporW88CWKw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAmoVChMIzMC0qOeWyAIVArwUCh3BBwQq#v=onepage&amp;q=%22critical%20mass%22%20cycling%20proponents&amp;f=false.|title=Critical Mass protesters too critical|author=Zack Furness|date=August 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 30, 2003, in [[Buffalo, New York]], during an incident known locally as "Critical Massacre," police stopped two cyclists for "failure to yield to an [[emergency vehicle]]." Several people were allegedly attacked by police.

[[Chicago Police Department]] officers are often seen riding with Critical Mass participants, and squad cars block intersections to provide safe passage to Critical Mass cyclists. However, on August 31, 2007, seven riders were arrested on charges of obstructing traffic and disobeying police, and were held overnight. According to some of those arrested, they were released late at night or early in the morning. On multiple occasions, Critical Mass participants attempted to ride on [[Lake Shore Drive]], a road off limits to cyclists. Police prevented participants riding on Lake Shore Drive, by blocking entrance ramps with squad cars when Critical Mass riders approach the road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Tips For Newcomers |url=http://chicagocriticalmass.org/about/newbies |accessdate=5 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the gradual increase of cyclists participating in Critical Mass, as well as complaints from motorists and concerns for safety, [[Houston Police Department]] officers helped direct the October 2013 Critical Mass ride in [[Houston, Texas]] by controlling intersections on the bike route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= 2000 Cyclists Participate in Critical Mass |url=http://www.khou.com/news/local/2000-cyclists-participate-in-Critical-Mass-229348351.html |accessdate = 5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2014, after two months of providing free security and safe passage through heavy intersections, the [[Houston Police Department]] began considering options to charge the group for providing security for the event, citing similarities to providing security for funeral processions through the [[city]] limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Critical Mass is free, but Houston police may begin charging riders for escort |url=http://www.chron.com/default/article/Critical-Mass-is-free-but-Houston-police-may-5108973.php|accessdate = 5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Critical Mass riders have spoken out in protest of paying a fee to utilize extra security and escorting through busy intersections, while many others support paying fees for extra security to keep the ride safe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Critical Mass says paying for Houston police escorts not an option |url=http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Critical-Mass-says-paying-for-Houston-police-5111821.php#src=fb |accessdate = 5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has led to increased discussions between the [[city]] and group for additional alternatives to the building conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Houston Police Department may stop providing security for monthly cycling event Critical Mass |url=http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/story?section=news/local&amp;id=9381009|accessdate = 5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==London, United Kingdom==
[[Image:Metropolitan Police officers at Critical Mass London, April 2006.jpg|right|thumb|[[Metropolitan Police]] officers with their cycles awaiting the start of Critical Mass London, April 2006.]]
In [[London]] on September 2005, a few weeks after the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|7 July 2005 bombings]], Metropolitan Police required the organisers to provide a route six days before the event and placed strict restrictions on riders under threat of arrest. The threat was retracted when politicians and cyclist groups objected. In October 2005, the ride had close to 1,200 participants, significantly more than usual. A long stop in [[Parliament Square]], part of the government's exclusion area in the [[Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005]], led to a slow and cumbersome ride.

One participant sought a declaration from the [[High Court of England and Wales]] that police need not be notified about the rides, in a "friendly action" in which neither side sought [[damages]]. The High Court&lt;ref name=kayvc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2006/1536.html|title=Kay v. the Commissioner of the Police of the Metropolis, EWHC 1536 (Admin)|date=June 27, 2006|publisher=Royal Courts of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt; agreed, exempting Critical Mass from notification under Section 11 of the [[Public Order Act 1986]]. The ruling was reversed on appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2007/477.html|title=Kay v. the Commissioner of the Police of the Metropolis (appeal)|date=May 21, 2007|publisher=Royal Courts of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, [[Friends of the Earth]], who supported the legal action, said the case would be appealed to England's highest legal authority, the [[House of Lords]], on the grounds that, after 11 years, Critical Mass is "commonly or customarily held."

During the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], cyclists were arrested on opening day after police claim they ignored regulations in place during the Olympics. [[Jenny Jones (Green politician)|Jenny Jones]] of the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]] and the [[London Assembly|Greater London Assembly]] has questioned the police actions, calling them "out of all proportion to common sense"&lt;ref&gt;http://greenparty.org.uk/news/2012/07/31/green-party-call-on-the-mayor-to-keep-civil-liberties-at-the-forefront-during-the-olympics/&lt;/ref&gt; and "tragically unnecessary."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/jenny-jones-am/london-olympics-what-is-the-cost_b_1755785.html&lt;/ref&gt; A Critical Mass website asked riders to be "peacefully assertive" during the monthly ride, while police claim they asked riders to keep to the south of the [[River Thames]].

==Minneapolis, Minnesota, US==
On the August 31, 2007, ride in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], a confrontation occurred between cyclists and the police. The police presence included [[Undercover operation|undercover]] officers, three marked [[Police car|squad cars]], a state [[patrol]] helicopter, and unmarked vehicles. The ride had been linked with weekend protests of the following year's [[2008 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]]. After the arrest of a cyclist for "riding in a snake-like manner," cyclists began chanting "Let him go!" and "What's the charge?" The police called for backup, and dozens of police officers responded, using [[Mace (spray)|mace]] and [[taser]]s. Minneapolis police arrested 19 participants, including three [[Minor (law)|minors]]. The adults were arrested on suspicion of rioting, a [[gross misdemeanor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.startribune.com/467/story/1396202.html September 1: 19 bicyclists arrested after rally turns into melee&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmsupport.wordpress.com Minneapolis Critical Mass Arrestee Support&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 27, 2011, in [[Minsk]], Belarus, police forces aided by special units transported 13 cyclists to the police station for violation of traffic rules and for not following orders to disband.

Police in [[New York City]] have claimed that Critical Mass bicyclists blocking intersections to allow bikes to pass may delay emergency vehicles in the [[gridlock]].&lt;ref name=usatoday&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2004-11-15-bikes-new-york_x.htm|date=November 15, 2004|publisher=USA Today|title=Big pack of bikes piques police|author=Martha T.

During the US [[2004 Republican National Convention]], police arrested 250 riders after the ride caused "massive disruptions" in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/08/28/rnc.bike.protest/|publisher=CNN|title=264 arrested in NYC bicycle protest|author=Jonathan Wald|date=August 29, 2004|accessdate=2008-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many court cases resulted regarding the legality of the ride, whether police have the right to arrest cyclists and seize bicycles, and whether the event needs a [[Protest permit|permit]]. In December 2004, a federal judge dismissed New York City's [[injunction]] against Critical Mass as a "political event."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/courtweb/pdf/D02NYSC/04-08621.PDF|format=PDF|title=Bray v.

The lawsuit also stated that Time's Up! and the public could not ride or gather at a Critical Mass bike ride, claiming a permit was required.

===2008 bicycle rally===
During a bicycle rally on July 25, 2008, [[NYPD]] patrolman Patrick Pogan pushed rider Christopher Long off his bicycle.&lt;ref name="nytimes080729a"&gt;{{cite news | first = James | last = Barron | title = Officer Investigated in Toppling of Cyclist | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/29/nyregion/29critical.html | work = The New York Times | location = New York City, New York | page = B1 | date = 2008-07-29 | accessdate = 2009-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a criminal complaint, Pogan wrote that he had ordered Long to stop because he was weaving in and out of traffic, forcing vehicles to swerve or stop, and generally disrupting the normal flow of traffic. In addition, Pogan wrote that he suffered [[lacerations]] on his arms because Long steered his bike into him and knocked him down, and when he tried to place Long under arrest, Long began flailing, kicking and screaming, "You are pawns in the game!"&lt;ref name="nytimes080729a" /&gt; Long spent the next day in [[Detention (imprisonment)|police custody]] on charges of attempted assault, resisting arrest and [[disorderly conduct]].&lt;ref name="nytimes090730"&gt;{{cite news | first = Jim | last = Dwyer | title = When Official Truth Collides With Cheap Digital Technology | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/30/nyregion/30about.html | work = The New York Times | location = New York City, New York | page = B1 | date = 2008-07-30 | accessdate = 2009-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within days, members of the rally's sponsoring organization [[Time's Up!]] posted a video of the incident on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Critical Mass Bicyclist Assaulted by NYPD|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUkiyBVytRQ|website=YouTube|publisher=downsouthvids|accessdate=June 28, 2016|date=July 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes080729b"&gt;{{cite news | first = Colin | last = Moynihan | title = The Officer, the Bicyclist and the Video | url =http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/07/29/the-officer-the-bicyclist-and-the-video/ | work = The New York Times | location = New York City, New York | date = 2008-07-29 | accessdate = 2009-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video went [[Viral phenomenon|viral]] and received over 400,000 [[Hit (Internet)|hits]] within five days.  Critical Mass activists claimed it supported their claims that the police department has demonstrated a pattern of arresting participants in the rally on false charges.&lt;ref name="nytimes080729b" /&gt; Witnesses also disputed Pogan's account, saying that Long was the one to receive injuries, traffic was stopped for the rally, and that Pogan had simply scanned the group of cyclists to find one he could take down.&lt;ref name="nytimes080729a" /&gt;

The [[Patrolmen's Benevolent Association|union]] that represents NYPD officers said Pogan was just doing his job to protect the public from a reckless bike rider,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Murray | last = Weiss | title = Cop union's spin on bike tackler | url =http://www.nypost.com/seven/07302008/news/regionalnews/cop_unions_spin_on_bike_tackler_122209.htm | work = The New York Post | location = New York City, New York | date = 2008-07-30 | accessdate = 2009-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Pogan's father — himself a retired NYPD [[detective]] — defended him, saying "You gotta do what you gotta do to make an arrest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Tamer | last = El-Ghobashy | title = Shock over cop's bike slam video | url = http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2008/07/28/2008-07-28_rookie_cop_in_hot_water_after_video_show.html | work = The New York Daily News | location = New York City, New York | page = 3 | date = 2008-07-29 | accessdate = 2009-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New York County District Attorney|prosecutor]]'s office dismissed the charges against Long. NYPD placed Pogan, who had spent only three weeks as a police officer, on a desk assignment while the city investigated the incident.&lt;ref name="tribune090307"&gt;{{cite news|first=Maull |last=Samuel |title=Charges dismissed against cyclist in YouTube shove |url=http://wcbstv.com/local/NYC.YouTube.Cyclist.2.810857.html |agency=The Associated Press |date=2009-09-05 |accessdate=2009-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100424044456/http://wcbstv.com/local/NYC.YouTube.Cyclist.2.810857.html |archivedate=April 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 16, 2008, Pogan appeared in court and pleaded not guilty to [[felony]] charges of falsifying business records and filing a false instrument, and [[misdemeanor]] charges of third-degree [[assault]], second-degree [[harassment]] and making a punishable false written statement.&lt;ref name="ap081216"&gt;{{cite news |title=NYC cop seen in YouTube shove pleads not guilty |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2008/12/15/national/a190557S13.DTL |agency=The Associated Press |date=2008-12-16 |accessdate=2009-03-07 |work=The San Francisco Chronicle |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505202507/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fn%2Fa%2F2008%2F12%2F15%2Fnational%2Fa190557S13.DTL |archivedate=May 5, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[indictment]], the police department suspended Pogan&lt;ref name="ap081216" /&gt; and, two months later, Pogan resigned as the department prepared to fire him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Clarification: YouTube cyclist story |url=http://a.abcnews.com/US/wireStory?id=6960284 |agency=The Associated Press |date=2009-02-25 |accessdate=2009-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707073738/http://a.abcnews.com/US/wireStory?id=6960284 |archivedate=July 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His attorney said that his defense would center on the department's training procedures and claims that events occurring off-camera needed to be taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Chris | last = Kokenes | title = Officer resigns after video shows him knocking down cyclist | url =http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/02/20/youtube.cyclist/ | agency = CNN | location = Atlanta, Georgia | date = 2009-02-20 | accessdate = 2009-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 8, 2009, it was reported that Long, then a [[Hoboken, NJ]], resident, was suing the New York Police Department for $1.5 million, alleging that Pogan falsified his arrest report in order to legitimize his assault on Long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nj.com/hobokennow/index.ssf/2009/07/bodychecked_new_york_city_cycl.html|title=Bodychecked cyclist suing NYPD for $1.5 million|date=July 8, 2009|publisher=Hoboken Now|accessdate=2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2009/07/07/2009-07-07_cyclist_seeks_15m_from_city_for_body_slam.html|title=Cyclist sues NYPD for $1.5M after YouTube vid captures cop body slam|date=July 7, 2009|publisher=''Daily News''|accessdate=2009-07-16 | location=New York | first=Simone | last=Weichselbaum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===July 1997===

On the night of July 25, 1997, in [[San Francisco]], the ride attracted 5,000 participants, which resulted in congested traffic, confrontations with motorists, and arrests. Interest and tension had been growing for several weeks due to increased [[rhetoric]] from then-Mayor [[Willie Brown (politician)|Willie Brown]] regarding cracking down on the event. The local newspapers published a city-approved route after the mayor withdrew his threat to have bicyclists arrested for not obtaining a [[parade]] permit. Because of the large turnout, it was difficult if not impossible for cyclists to follow the sanctioned route. Riders instead found themselves engaged in verbal and physical altercations with motorists and police, as well as among themselves. Two officers reported injuries in confrontations with bike riders. Local media reported that "about 250" bicyclists were arrested, most for disrupting traffic, and a few for being drunk in public, [[Battery (crime)|battery]], and outstanding [[Warrant (law)|warrants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===March 2007===
On the March 2007 ride in San Francisco, a rider was arrested on felony (later reduced to misdemeanor) charges in San Francisco's [[Tenderloin, San Francisco, California|Tenderloin neighborhood]] for denting a [[limousine]] using a [[bicycle lock]]. The driver told police he got out of his car to talk to two cyclists who allegedly blocked his path. After exchanging words with one of the cyclists, the driver said he grabbed one of the bicycles and tried to pull it out of the way. He then got back into his limo to go around the riders, but before he could move, he said, another cyclist ran into the side of his car, then punched the hood with a U-shaped lock. The cyclist told police he only hit the limousine after the driver gunned his engine. During the incident, one of the limousine's tires was slashed and the driver's keys were stolen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Towards the end of the ride, near the [[Japantown, San Francisco, California|Japan Center]] and [[Western Addition]] neighborhoods, a mother from [[Redwood City, California]], traveling with her two young daughters in the vehicle, tried to drive through the mass of riders. A witness claimed to have observed the driver strike a cyclist and flee before cyclists chased and surrounded her vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In April 2007, San Francisco Mayor [[Gavin Newsom]] requested that Critical Mass riders police themselves. "It does the bicycle-advocacy community no good to have people that are aggressive and dispirit the entire movement," Newsom said. "I would encourage the bicycle [[coalition]] to say, 'Look, we don't put up with this, enough is enough.' "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===November 2009===

In November 2009, Stanley Roberts of [[KRON]] 4 News recorded several Critical Mass confrontations between bicyclists and vehicles at [[Van Ness Avenue (San Francisco)|Van Ness]] and O'Farrell Streets. An old Critical Mass website advised riders not to be confrontational and block traffic, but in footage filmed by Roberts, bicyclists engaged in confrontational arguments with motorists and blocked roads to vehicular traffic.&lt;ref name="KRON4"&gt;{{cite web

In August 2015, [[KQED]] posted an article on a Critical Mass confrontation between a bicyclist and a female [[Zipcar]] driver in the San Francisco Marina District. 39 year old Ian Hespelt was arrested a few days later by the San Francisco Police Department's bicycle patrol at [[AT&amp;T Park]] during the [[Billy Joel]] concert. Hespelt was charged with four felonies including assault, vandalism, maliciously throwing a substance at a vehicle and false imprisonment. Hespelt was also wanted in Washington state on a felony drug charge warrant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Vilnius, Lithuania==
On July 27, 2007, in [[Vilnius, Lithuania]], police took five participants into custody, including two minors, for not following orders to disband.

==Walnut Creek, California, US==
In [[Walnut Creek, California]], on June 20, 2008, a car bumped into the rear wheel of a Critical Mass rider. An argument ensued among the driver and passenger of the car and the cyclist involved, after which the passenger and driver of the car assaulted the cyclist. The police arrived and arrested the passenger and driver of the automobile involved in the assault.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2008/06/20/18509674.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==Warsaw, Poland==
On June 21, 2002, in [[Warsaw, Poland]], the Critical Mass event was stopped by a cordon of fully armed [[riot police]] on [[Constitution Square (Warsaw)|Plac Konstytucji (Constitution Square)]], who demanded their dispersal and detained some of the participants. Other Critical Mass participants responded with a [[Sit-in|sit-in protest]], blocking an important traffic [[Junction (traffic)|junction]], and then tried to evade the [[blockade]] by taking different routes to [[Castle Square, Warsaw|Plac Zamkowy (Castle Square)]], the Critical Mass rally point.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.raster.art.pl/galeria/artysci/rowelucja/rowelucja.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20080603011249/http://www.masa.waw.pl/2002/0621.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/kraj/1,34309,890904.html {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120710195928/http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/kraj/1,34309,890904.html |date=2012-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This event was widely reported by the media and, as a result, the Warsaw [[municipality]] decided to legalize future events, rather than escalate the conflict. Beginning in September 2002, Critical Mass events in Warsaw are organized in full cooperation with the police force. Once a year in August, beginning in 2007, a special Critical Mass is organized in cooperation with the city officials to commemorate the [[Warsaw Uprising]].

'''Cornerstone Festival''' was a [[Christian music festival]] put on by [[Jesus People USA]] and held annually around July 4 near [[Bushnell, Illinois]], drawing some 20,000 attendees each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mark Moring |url=http://blog.christianitytoday.com/ctentertainment/2011/05/jesus-rally-planned-for-corner-1.html |title=Christianity Today Entertainment Blog: Jesus Rally Planned for Cornerstone |publisher=Blog.christianitytoday.com |date=May 25, 2011 |accessdate=September 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a given year, many artists that played at Cornerstone also played at other events such as [[Creation Festival]] and mainstream festivals and tours such as the [[Warped Tour]]. The final festival was held in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cornerstonefestival.com/information/specialAnnouncement.php |title=Cornerstone Festival 2012 :: Special Announcement |publisher=Cornerstonefestival.com |date=June 30, 2011 |accessdate=July 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cornerstone Festival was a member of the [[Christian Festival Association]].

==History==
From 1984 to 1990, Cornerstone was held at the Lake County Fairgrounds near [[Grayslake, Illinois]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} In 1991, Cornerstone moved near the town of Bushnell (outside [[Macomb, Illinois|Macomb]]) where the organizers of the festival purchased a large piece of land, which is now called "Cornerstone Farm".{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Tens of thousands of people attended Cornerstone Farm each year and saw over 300 bands play many styles of music, including [[rock and roll|rock]], [[heavy metal music|metal]], [[punk music|punk]], [[hardcore punk|hardcore]] and [[pop music]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} In addition to the many musicians, Cornerstone Festival also presented guest speakers, and featured independent/foreign film screenings, writers' seminars, and art workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bushnell, Il [Yya] |url=http://oca.org/news/oca-news/cornerstone-2011-sharing-the-fullness-of-christ-at-cornerstone-music-festiv |title=News - CORNERSTONE 2011: Sharing the Fullness of Christ at Cornerstone Music Festival |publisher=OCA |date=July 20, 2011 |accessdate=May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3jqjSKHKcwC&amp;pg=PA176&amp;lpg=PA176 |title=Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music: Pop, Rock, and Worship: Pop ... - Google Books |via=[[Google Books]]|accessdate=May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 2010 the festival's main stage moved to the "Midway", which is about 0.7 miles northeast of its previous location in the "bowl".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cornerstonefestival.com/content.php?p=144#moving | title = Cornerstone Festival 2010 :: 10 Things You Need To Know About Cornerstone | accessdate =July 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2011 festival featured a Jesus Rally showcasing many of the groundbreaking [[Jesus music]] artists including; [[Servant (band)|Servant]], [[Daniel Amos]], [[Randy Stonehill]], [[Barry McGuire]], [[Resurrection Band]], [[Phil Keaggy]], and [[Petra (band)|Classic Petra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Trott |first=Jon |url=http://www.wilsonstation.com/cornerstone-festival-jesus-rally-celebrates-40-years-of-the-jesus-movement/ |title=Cornerstone Festival "Jesus Rally" Celebrates 40 Years of the Jesus Movement |publisher=Wilsonstation.com |date=May 26, 2012 |accessdate=May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mark Moring |url=http://blog.christianitytoday.com/ctentertainment/2011/05/jesus-rally-planned-for-corner-1.html |title=Christianity Today Entertainment Blog: Jesus Rally Planned for Cornerstone |publisher=Blog.christianitytoday.com |date=May 25, 2011 |accessdate=May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Raúl Alfonsín]] was the [[president of Argentina]] from 1983 to 1989. He died on March 31, 2009, aged 82.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/01/world/americas/01alfonsin.html?ref=obituaries&amp;_r=0|title= Raúl Alfonsín, 82, Former Argentine Leader, Dies|author= Clifford Kraus|date= 31 March 2009|work= The New York Times|accessdate=July 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had lung cancer and died at his home; a massive candlelight vigil took place in the vicinity of it. Vice president [[Julio Cobos]], the acting president at the time, arranged three days of national mourning and a [[state funeral]] at the [[Palace of the Argentine National Congress]]. Alfonsín was seen by 40,000 people and the senior politicians of the country; people from other countries also voiced their respect for him. A military escort took his coffin to the [[La Recoleta Cemetery]], and left him at the pantheon for the veterans of the [[Revolution of the Park]].

==Health and death==
Alfonsín had [[lung cancer]] for almost a year before his death, which led to [[pneumonia]]. His medic Alejandro Sandler explained that his health had worsened at several points, which were followed by brief recoveries. In his last days he was visited by vice president [[Julio Cobos]] and monsignor Justo Laguna, who gave him the [[Anointing of the Sick]]. He received [[home care]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.perfil.com/contenidos/2009/03/31/noticia_0010.html|title= Se agrava el estado de salud de Raúl Alfonsín: recibió a monseñor Laguna|trans-title=The health of Raúl Alfonsín gets worse: he received monsignor Laguna|language= Spanish|date= March 31, 2009|publisher= Perfil|accessdate=July 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as Sandler preferred him to stay with his family.&lt;ref name="duelo3" /&gt; The president [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]] was out of the country and phoned several times; [[Ricardo Alfonsín]] called her at 17:00 and informed her of his father's health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1113785-se-agravo-la-salud-de-raul-alfonsin|title= Se agravó la salud de Raúl Alfonsín|trans-title=The health of Raúl Alfonsín worsened|language= Spanish|date= March 31, 2009|work= La Nación|accessdate=August 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died on March 31, 2009, at 20:30; Sandler announced it at 21:03. Alfonsín was sleeping at the moment, next to his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1113997-murio-quedandose-dormido-afirmo-su-medico|title= "Murió quedándose dormido", afirmó su médico|trans-title="He died falling asleep", said his medic|language= Spanish|date= March 31, 2009|work= La Nación|accessdate=July 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cobos was the first politician to arrive at his home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.perfil.com/politica/Murio-Raul-Alfonsin-20090331-0029.html|title= Murió Raúl Alfonsín|trans-title=Raúl Alfonsín died|language= Spanish|date= April 1, 2009|publisher= Perfil|accessdate=July 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funeral==
When the first news of the death of Alfonsín were released, the vicinity of his house at the [[Avenida Santa Fe|Santa Fe avenue]] was filled by hundreds of people, who started a [[Candlelight vigil]].&lt;ref name="velas"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1114002-cientos-de-personas-se-congregan-en-la-casa-de-alfonsin|title= Cientos de personas se congregan en la casa de Alfonsín|trans-title=Hundreds of people gather at the house of Alfonsín|language= Spanish|date= April 1, 2009|work= La Nación|accessdate=July 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The multitude included friends, neighbors and political supporters. The politicians [[Felipe Solá]] and [[Ricardo Gil Lavedra]] attended the meeting as well. The balconies of nearby houses were filled with flowers and banners.&lt;ref name="velas" /&gt; 
[[File:Granaderos despedida alfonsín.jpg|thumb|left|Procession in the [[Callao Avenue]]]]
The president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner was out of the country at the moment, and although she arranged an early return, she could not return to the country in time for the funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1114227-cristina-kirchner-adelanto-la-vuelta-de-londres|title= Cristina Kirchner adelantó la vuelta de Londres|trans-title=Cristina Kirchner speed up her return from London|language= Spanish|date= April 1, 2009|work= La Nación|accessdate=July 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the vice president Julio Cobos arranged the [[state funeral]] of Alfonsín, alongside [[Eduardo Fellner]] (president of the Chamber of deputies) and [[José Pampuro]] (acting president of the Senate). His widow, former [[First Lady of Argentina]] [[María Lorenza Barreneche]], was unable to attend her husband's public state funeral due to her own declining health.&lt;ref name=clarin&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Murió María Lorenza Barrenechea, la esposa de Raúl Alfonsín |url=http://www.clarin.com/politica/Murio-Maria-Lorenza-Barrenechea-Alfonsi_0_1499250292.html |work=[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)]] |date=2016-01-06 |accessdate=2016-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a former Argentine president, his body was displayed at the Blue Hall of the [[Palace of the Argentine National Congress]]. He also set three days of national mourning, from March 31 to April 2. [[Daniel Scioli]], governor of the [[Buenos Aires Province]] (birthplace of Alfonsín), also announced a provincial mourning.&lt;ref name="duelo3" /&gt; Almost a thousand people attended, and at some moments they sang the [[Argentine National Anthem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1114109-un-homenaje-multitudinario-en-la-calle|title= Un homenaje multitudinario en la calle|trans-title=A populated homage in the streets|language= Spanish|date= April 1, 2009|work= La Nación|accessdate=August 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The people were allowed to enter to the Congress on April 1, 10:00.&lt;ref name="duelo3"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1113999-cobos-decreto-tres-dias-de-duelo-nacional|title= Cobos decretó tres días de Duelo Nacional|trans-title=Cobos decreed three days of national mourning|language= Spanish|date= March 31, 2009|work= La Nación|accessdate=July 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1114076-sera-velado-en-el-congreso-a-partir-de-las-10|title= Será velado en el Congreso a partir de las 10|trans-title=He will be mourned in the Congress at 10:00|language= Spanish|date= April 1, 2009|work= La Nación|accessdate=August 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, it was intended to keep the Congress open until 20:00, but the number of people attending it forced to delay it for the morning of April 2.&lt;ref name="continua"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1114216-continua-la-despedida-multitudinaria-de-alfonsin-en-el-congreso|title= Continúa la despedida multitudinaria de Alfonsín en el Congreso|trans-title=The populated goodbye to Alfonsín at the Congress continues|language= Spanish|date= April 2, 2009|work= La Nación|accessdate=August 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was attended by the former presidents [[Carlos Menem]], [[Fernando de la Rúa]], [[Eduardo Duhalde]] and [[Néstor Kirchner]], all the members of the [[Supreme Court of Argentina]], mayor [[Mauricio Macri]], governor Daniel Scioli, the president of Uruguay [[Tabaré Vázquez]] and several other politicians.&lt;ref name="continua" /&gt; The Congress was visited by almost 40,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1114600-llantos-nostalgia-y-reclamos-en-el-emotivo-adios|title= Llantos, nostalgia y reclamos en el emotivo adiós|trans-title=Crying, nostalgia and petitions in the emotive last goodbye|language= Spanish|date= April 2, 2009|work= La Nación|accessdate=August 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the largest state funeral in Argentina since the death of [[Juan Perón]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1114599-multitudinaria-despedida-a-alfonsin|title= Multitudinaria despedida a Alfonsín|trans-title=Multitudinarie last goodbye to Alfonsín|language= Spanish|author= Gustavo Ybarra|date= April 2, 2009|work= La Nación|accessdate=August 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a ceremony afterwards with speeches from politicians from Alfonsín's tenure and from the Kirchner administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1114678-emotivos-discursos-de-despedida-en-el-congreso|title= Emotivos discursos de despedida en el Congreso|trans-title=Emotive last goodbye speeches at the Congress|language= Spanish|date= April 2, 2009|work= La Nación|accessdate=August 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremony was aired in ''[[cadena nacional]]''. It was followed by a mass given by [[José María Arancedo]], archbishop of Santa Fe. Finally, a procession in the [[Callao Avenue]] with a military escort took the corpse to the [[La Recoleta Cemetery]]. People threw flowers to the coffin, fly Argentine and radical flags, and sung the national anthem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1114651-tras-innumerables-expresiones-de-afecto-el-cuerpo-del-ex-presidente-descansa-en-recoleta|title= Tras innumerables expresiones de afecto, el cuerpo del ex presidente descansa en Recoleta|trans-title=After countless displays of affection, the corpse of the ex president lies in Recoleta|language= Spanish|date= April 3, 2009|work= La Nación|accessdate=August 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was left in the pantheon for the veterans of the [[Revolution of the Park]], until he got a special one for himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1114216-continua-la-despedida-multitudinaria-de-alfonsin-en-el-congreso|title= Continúa la despedida multitudinaria de Alfonsín en el Congreso|trans-title=The miltutudinarie goodbye to Alfonsín at the Congress continues|language= Spanish|date= April 2, 2009|work= La Nación|accessdate=July 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty-two Argentine bishops at the [[Holy See]] held a mass for Alfonsín as well. It was at the [[Archbasilica of St. John Lateran]], and was attended by the Argentine ambassador [[Juan Pablo Cafiero]], the Italian monsignor Giuseppe Laterza and the Argentine monsignor Guillermo Karcher. The bishops met [[Pope Benedict XVI]] the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1114346-italia-obispos-argentinos-celebraron-una-misa-por-el-lider-radical|title= Italia: obispos argentinos celebraron una misa por el líder radical|trans-title=Italy: Argentine bishops held a mass for the radical leader|language= Spanish|date= April 1, 2009|work= La Nación|accessdate=August 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
[[File:Condolenciasobama.jpg|thumb|Message of condolences sent by [[Barack Obama]], president of the United States]]
The living former presidents of Argentina sent their condolences for Alfonsín. [[Carlos Menem]] said that his death was a great loss for democracy.&lt;ref name="expresi"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1114067-ex-presidentes-manifestaron-su-pesar-por-el-adios-de-un-hombre-de-la-democracia|title= Ex presidentes manifestaron su pesar por el adiós de un hombre "de la democracia"|trans-title=Ex presidents manifested their sorrow for the goodbye to a man of democracy|language= Spanish|date= April 1, 2009|work= La Nación|accessdate=July 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote an editorial for the ''[[La Nación]]'' newspaper, titled "Un viejo adversario saluda a un amigo" ({{lang-es|link=no|An old adversary salutes a friend}}), mirroring the famous quotation of the radical leader [[Ricardo Balbín]] during the funeral of Perón.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1114525-un-viejo-adversario-saluda-a-un-amigo|title= Un viejo adversario saluda a un amigo|trans-title=An old adversary salutes a friend|language= Spanish|author= Carlos Menem|date= April 2, 2009|work= La Nación|accessdate=August 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fernando de la Rúa]] said that "he fought all his life for politics and democracy.

[[Ricardo López Murphy]], minister of economy of president Fernando de la Rúa, said that Alfonsín was "the man who fought for our democracy and the strengthening of institutions, during a time of conflicts and polarizations that our society was merged into".&lt;ref name="pesar"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1114003-profundo-pesar-en-el-ambito-politico-por-la-muerte-del-ex-presidente|title= Profundo pesar en el ámbito político por la muerte del ex presidente|trans-title=Deep pain in politics for the death of the ex-president|language= Spanish|date= April 1, 2009|work= La Nación|accessdate=July 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cristian Ritondo]], legislator of the [[Republican Proposal]], said that "Alfonsín was the main actor of the return of democracy to Argentina. He was a sinonym of work, responsibility and patriotism".&lt;ref name="pesar" /&gt; [[Gerardo Morales (politician)|Gerardo Morales]] said that "when we were young in 1983 and sang 'we are life, we are peace', it was more than a slogan, it was a synthesis of our hopes: do not suffer more persecutions, live in democracy, in freedom and peace.

'''Electrical injury''' is a physiological reaction caused by [[electric current]] passing through the (human) body.&lt;ref name="Boon"&gt;{{cite book| last1=Boon| first1=Elizabeth| last2=Parr| first2=Rebecca| last3=20,000Dayananda| first3=Samarawickrama| title=Oxford Handbook of Dental Nursing| publisher=Oxford University Press| date=2012| location=| pages=132| language=| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dx9FAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=%22electric+shock| doi=| id=| isbn=0191629863| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170306102959/https://books.google.com/books?id=dx9FAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=%22electric+shock| archivedate=2017-03-06| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Electric shock occurs upon contact of a (human) body part with any source of [[electricity]] that causes a sufficient magnitude of current to pass through the victim's [[flesh]], [[viscera]] or [[hair]].  Physical contact with energized [[electrical wiring|wiring]] or devices is the most common cause of an electric shock. In cases of exposure to high [[voltage]]s, such as on a [[power transmission tower]], physical contact with energized wiring or objects may not be necessary to cause electric shock, as the voltage may be sufficient to "jump" the air gap between the electrical device and the victim.

The injury related to electric shock depends on the magnitude of the current. &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reilly|1998|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Very small currents may be imperceptible or produce a light tingling sensation. A shock caused by low current that would normally be harmless could startle an individual and cause injury due to suddenly jerking away from the source of electricity, resulting in one striking a stationary object, dropping an object being held or falling. Stronger currents may cause some degree of discomfort or pain, while more intense currents may induce involuntary muscle contractions, preventing the victim from breaking free of the source of electricity.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Alexander Geddes, Rebecca A. Roeder ,''Handbook of Electrical Hazards and Accidents'' Lawyers &amp; Judges Publishing Company, 2006 {{ISBN|0913875449}},  page 29&lt;/ref&gt;  Still larger currents usually result in tissue damage and may trigger [[fibrillation#Cardiology|fibrillation]] of the heart or [[cardiac arrest]], any of which may ultimately be [[death|fatal]].  If death results from an electric shock the [[cause of death]] is generally referred to as [[electrocution]].

==Signs and symptoms==

===Burns===
[[File:Verbrennung Grad 2b.jpg|thumb|Second-degree burn after a [[high tension line]] accident]]
Heating due to [[electrical resistance|resistance]] can cause extensive and deep [[burn]]s. Voltage levels of 500 to 1000 volts tend to cause internal burns due to the large energy (which is proportional to the duration multiplied by the square of the voltage divided by resistance) available from the source. Damage due to current is through tissue heating. For most cases of high-energy electrical trauma, the Joule heating in the deeper tissues along the extremity will reach damaging temperatures in a few seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=8245107|year=1993|author1=Lee|first1=R.

A domestic power supply voltage (110 or 230&amp;nbsp;V), 50 or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz alternating current (AC) through the chest for a fraction of a second may induce [[ventricular fibrillation]] at currents as low as {{nowrap|30 mA}}.&lt;ref name=ucsb/&gt; With direct current (DC), 300 to 500&amp;nbsp;mA is required.&lt;ref name=whitaker/&gt; If the current has a direct pathway to the heart (e.g., via a [[Catheter|cardiac catheter]] or other kind of [[electrode]]), a much lower current of less than 1&amp;nbsp;mA (AC or DC) can cause fibrillation. If not immediately treated by [[defibrillation]], fibrillation is usually lethal because all of the heart muscle fibres move independently instead of in the coordinated pulses needed to pump blood and maintain circulation. Above 200&amp;nbsp;mA, muscle contractions are so strong that the heart muscles cannot move at all, but these conditions prevent fibrillation.

===Neurological effects===
Current can cause interference with nervous control, especially over the heart and lungs.  Repeated or severe electric shock which does not lead to death has been shown to cause [[neuropathy]]. Recent research has found that functional differences in [[neural]] activation during spatial working memory and implicit learning [[oculomotor]] tasks have been identified in electrical shock victims.&lt;ref&gt;Mechanism of Electrical Injury [http://www.cetri.org/mechanism Chicago Electrical Trauma Research Institute] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503033705/http://www.cetri.org/mechanism |date=May 3, 2015 }} Accessed April 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

When the current path is through the head, it appears that, with sufficient current applied, loss of consciousness almost always occurs swiftly. (This is borne out by some limited [[self-experimentation]] by early designers of the [[electric chair]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} and by research from the field of [[animal husbandry]], where [[electric stunning]] has been extensively studied).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grandin.com/humane/elec.stun.html Electric Stunning of Pigs and Sheep] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306103752/http://www.grandin.com/humane/elec.stun.html |date=2016-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arc-flash hazards===
{{main|Arc flash}}
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2008}}
[[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] found that up to 80&amp;nbsp;percent of its electrical injuries involve thermal burns due to arcing faults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ref=harv|url=http://standards.ieee.org/announcements/pr_FINArc.html|title=Industry Backs IEEE-NFPA Arc Flash Testing Program with Initial Donations of $1.25 Million|publisher=IEEE|date=14 July 2006|accessdate=2008-01-01|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302213538/http://standards.ieee.org/announcements/pr_FINArc.html|archivedate=2 March 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[arc flash]] in an electrical fault produces the same type of light [[radiation]] from which electric welders protect themselves using face shields with dark glass, heavy leather gloves, and full-coverage clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arcflash.com.au/arc_flash_protection.php|title=Arc_flash_protection.php - Arc Flash|author=|date=|website=www.arcflash.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heat produced may cause severe burns, especially on unprotected flesh.  The arc blast produced by vaporizing metallic components can break bones and damage internal organs.  The degree of hazard present at a particular location can be determined by a detailed analysis of the electrical system, and appropriate protection worn if the electrical work must be performed with the electricity on.

==Pathophysiology==

The minimum current a human can feel depends on the current type ([[alternating current|AC]] or [[direct current|DC]]) as well as [[frequency]] for AC. A person can feel at least 1 [[ampere|mA]] ([[Root mean square#Average electrical power|rms]]) of AC at 60&amp;nbsp;Hz, while at least 5 mA for DC. At around 10 milliamperes, AC current passing through the arm of a {{convert|68|kg|adj=on}} human can cause powerful muscle contractions; the victim is unable to voluntarily control muscles and cannot release an electrified object.&lt;ref&gt;John Cadick et. al (ed.) ''Electrical Safety Handbook Third Edition'', McGraw Hill,2005 {{ISBN|0-07-145772-0}}  page 1-4&lt;/ref&gt; This is known as the "let go threshold" and is a criterion for shock hazard in electrical regulations.

The current may, if it is high enough and is delivered at sufficient voltage, cause tissue damage or [[fibrillation]] which can cause cardiac arrest; {{nowrap|more than 30 mA}}&lt;ref name=ucsb&gt;[http://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~phys13CH/electrical_safety.pdf ucsb.edu - Electrical Safety Information - Physics Department, UCSB] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023060415/http://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~phys13CH/electrical_safety.pdf |date=2013-10-23 }}, 2012-01-09&lt;/ref&gt; of AC (rms, 60&amp;nbsp;Hz) or {{nowrap|300 – 500 mA}} of DC at high voltage can cause fibrillation.&lt;ref name=whitaker&gt;Clifford D. Ferris, ''Electric Shock'', chapter 22.1 in Jerry C. Whitaker (ed.)

However, the potential seriousness of the shock depends on paths through the body that the currents take.&lt;ref name=whitaker/&gt; If the [[voltage]] is less than 200&amp;nbsp;V, then the human skin, more precisely the [[stratum corneum]], is the main contributor to the impedance of the body in the case of a [[macroshock]]—the passing of current between two contact points on the skin. The characteristics of the skin are non-linear however. If the voltage is above 450–600&amp;nbsp;V, then [[dielectric breakdown]] of the skin occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reilly|1998|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protection offered by the skin is lowered by [[perspiration]], and this is accelerated if electricity causes muscles to contract 
above the let-go threshold for a sustained period of time.&lt;ref name=whitaker/&gt;

If an electrical circuit is established by electrodes introduced in the body, bypassing the skin, then the potential for lethality is much higher if a circuit through the heart is established. This is known as a [[microshock]]. Currents of only 10&amp;nbsp;[[micro-|µ]]A can be sufficient to cause fibrillation in this case with a probability of 0.2%.&lt;ref name="Leitgeb2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Norbert Leitgeb|title=Safety of Electromedical Devices: Law - Risks - Opportunities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FpSH-VM5TYkC&amp;pg=PA122|date=6 May 2010|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-211-99683-6|page=122|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170401235716/https://books.google.com/books?id=FpSH-VM5TYkC&amp;pg=PA122|archivedate=1 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Body resistance===
The voltage necessary for electrocution depends on the current through the body and the duration of the current. [[Ohm's law]] states that the current drawn depends on the resistance of the body. The resistance of human skin varies from person to person and fluctuates between different times of day. The [[NIOSH]] states "Under dry conditions, the resistance offered by the human body may be as high as 100,000 ohms. Wet or broken skin may drop the body's resistance to 1,000&amp;nbsp;ohms," adding that "high-voltage electrical energy quickly breaks down human skin, reducing the human body's resistance to 500&amp;nbsp;ohms".&lt;ref name=niosh&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/98-131/pdfs/98-131.pdf|accessdate=2008-08-16|title=Publication No. 98-131: Worker Deaths by Electrocution|publisher=[[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011191854/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/98-131/pdfs/98-131.pdf|archivedate=2008-10-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voltage-current characteristic of skin===

The voltage-current characteristic of human skin is non-linear and depends on many factors such as intensity, duration, history, and frequency of the electrical stimulus. Sweat gland activity, temperature, and individual variation also influence the voltage-current characteristic of skin. In addition to non-linearity, skin impedance exhibits asymmetric and time varying properties. These properties can be modeled with reasonable accuracy.&lt;ref name=Lochner&gt;{{cite web|url=http://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/28072/dissertation.pdf?sequence=1|title=The Voltage Current Characteristic of the Human Skin|publisher=[[University of Pretoria]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017084822/http://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/28072/dissertation.pdf?sequence=1|archivedate=2015-10-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resistance measurements made at low voltage using a standard [[ohmmeter]] do not accurately represent the impedance of human skin over a significant range of conditions.

For sinusoidal electrical stimulation less than 10 volts, the skin voltage-current characteristic is quasilinear. Over time, electrical characteristics can become non-linear. The time required varies from seconds to minutes, depending on stimulus, electrode placement, and individual characteristics.

Between 10 volts and about 30 volts, skin exhibits non-linear but symmetric electrical characteristics. Above 20 volts, electrical characteristics are both non-linear and symmetric. Skin conductance can increase by several orders of magnitude in milliseconds. This should not be confused with [[dielectric breakdown]], which occurs at hundreds of volts. For these reasons, current flow cannot be accurately calculated by simply applying [[Ohm's law]] using a fixed resistance model.

===Point of entry===
* [[Macroshock]]: Current across intact skin and through the body. Current from arm to arm, or between an arm and a foot, is likely to traverse the heart, therefore it is much more dangerous than current between a leg and the ground.  This type of shock by definition must pass into the body through the skin.
* [[Microshock]]: Very small current source with a pathway directly connected to the heart tissue. The shock is required to be administered from inside the skin, directly to the heart i.e. a pacemaker lead, or a guide wire, conductive catheter etc. connected to a source of current. This is a largely theoretical hazard as modern devices used in these situations include protections against such currents.

=== Lethality ===
{{original research|section|date=December 2010}}

==== Electrocution ====
The term "electrocution," coined about the time of the first use of the [[electric chair]] in 1890,{{cn|date=September 2017}} originally referred only to ''electr''ical exe''cution'' and not to accidental or suicidal electrical deaths.{{cn|date=September 2017}} However, since no English word was available for non-judicial deaths due to electric shock, the word "electrocution" eventually took over as a description of all circumstances of electrical [[death]] judicial punishment or not.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

==== Factors in lethality of electric shock ====

&lt;br /&gt;AC-1: imperceptible
&lt;br /&gt;AC-2: perceptible but no muscle reaction
&lt;br /&gt;AC-3: muscle contraction with reversible effects
&lt;br /&gt;AC-4: possible irreversible effects

&lt;br /&gt;AC-4.2: 5-50% probability of fibrillation
&lt;br /&gt;AC-4.3: over 50% probability of fibrillation]]

The lethality of an electric shock is dependent on several variables:

* Current. The higher the current, the more likely it is lethal. Since current is proportional to voltage when resistance is fixed ([[ohm's law]]), high voltage is an indirect risk for producing higher currents.
* Duration. The longer the duration, the more likely it is lethal&amp;mdash;safety switches may limit time of current flow
* Pathway. If current flows through the heart muscle, it is more likely to be lethal.
* [[High voltage]] (over about 600 volts). In addition to greater current flow, high voltage may cause dielectric breakdown at the skin, thus lowering skin resistance and allowing further increased current flow.
* [[Implant (medicine)|Medical implants]]. [[Artificial cardiac pacemaker]]s or [[implantable cardioverter-defibrillator]]s (ICD) are sensitive to very small currents.&lt;ref name="Blandford2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Claire M.

Other issues affecting lethality are [[frequency]], which is an issue in causing cardiac arrest or muscular spasms. Very high frequency electric current causes tissue burning, but does not penetrate the body far enough to cause cardiac arrest (see [[electrosurgery]]). Also important is the pathway: if the current passes through the chest or head, there is an increased chance of death. From a main circuit or power distribution panel the damage is more likely to be internal, leading to [[cardiac arrest]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}  Another factor is that cardiac tissue has a [[chronaxie]] (response time) of about 3 milliseconds, so electricity at frequencies of higher than about 333&amp;nbsp;Hz requires more current to cause fibrillation than is required at lower frequencies.

The comparison between the dangers of [[alternating current]] at typical power transmission frequences (i.e., 50 or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz), and [[direct current]] has been a subject of debate ever since the [[War of Currents]] in the 1880s. Animal experiments conducted during this time suggested that alternating current was about twice as dangerous as direct current per unit of current flow (or per unit of applied voltage).

It is sometimes suggested that human lethality is most common with [[alternating current]] at 100–250&amp;nbsp;volts; however, death has occurred below this range, with supplies as low as 42 volts.&lt;ref name="OSU Physics - The Fatal Current"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fatal Current|url=https://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~p616/safety/fatal_current.html|website=OSU Physics|publisher=Ohio State University|accessdate=4 March 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121721091400/http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~p616/safety/fatal_current.html|archivedate=2 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming a steady current flow (as opposed to a shock from a capacitor or from [[static electricity]]), shocks above 2,700&amp;nbsp;volts are often fatal, with those above 11,000&amp;nbsp;volts being usually fatal, though exceptional cases have been noted.  According to a [[Guinness Book of World Records]] comic, seventeen-year-old Brian Latasa survived a 230,000&amp;nbsp;volt shock on the tower of an ultra-high voltage line in [[Griffith Park]], Los Angeles on November 9, 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&amp;dat=19780428&amp;id=qAtPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=aAIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3583,2551486&amp;hl=en|publisher=Toledo Blade|date=1978-04-28|title=According to Guinness (comic)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A news report of the event stated that he was "jolted through the air, and landed across the line", and though rescued by firemen, he suffered burns over 40% of his body and was completely paralyzed except for his eyelids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&amp;dat=19671124&amp;id=JIdPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UAUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3519,5256084&amp;hl=en|publisher=Ocala Star-Banner|date=1967-11-24|title=Firemen risk death to save teenager}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shock with the highest voltage reported survived was that of Harry F.

== Deliberate uses ==

===Medical uses===
Electric shock is also used as a medical therapy, under carefully controlled conditions:
* [[Electroconvulsive therapy]] or ECT is a psychiatric therapy for [[mental illness]]. The objective of the therapy is to induce a seizure for therapeutic effect. There is no [[Consciousness|conscious]] sensation of the electric shock because of the anesthesia used beforehand.  Convulsive therapy was introduced in 1934 by Hungarian neuropsychiatrist [[Ladislas J. Meduna]] who, believing mistakenly that [[schizophrenia]] and [[epilepsy]] were antagonistic disorders, induced seizures first with [[camphor]] and then [[metrazol]] (cardiazol).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1177/0957154X9700802908 | last1 = Berrios | first1 = G E | year = 1997 | title = The scientific origins of electroconvulsive therapy | url = | journal = History of Psychiatry | volume = 8 | issue = 29 pt 1| pages = 105–119 | pmid = 11619203 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fink-history"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fink | first1 = M | year = 1984 | title = The origins of convulsive therapy | doi = 10.1176/ajp.141.9.1034 | journal = American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 141 | issue = 9| pages = 1034–41 | pmid = 6147103 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first patient was treated by Lucio Bini and Ugo Cerlettiin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hYdLS6qyTwUC&amp;lpg=PA129 |title=Coercion as Cure: A Critical History of Psychiatry |first=Thomas |last=Szasz |year=2007 |isbn=978-1412810500 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102234454/https://books.google.com/books?id=hYdLS6qyTwUC&amp;lpg=PA129 |archivedate=2018-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ECT is generally administered three times a week for about 8-12 treatments.

===Entertainment===

Mild electric shocks are also used for entertainment, especially as a [[practical joke]] for example in such devices as a shocking pen or a [[shocking gum]]. However devices such as a [[joy buzzer]] and most other machines in [[amusement park]]s today only use vibration that feels somewhat like an electric shock to someone not expecting it.

===Law enforcement and personal defense===
[[Electroshock weapon]]s are [[Less-lethal weapon|incapacitant]] [[weapon]]s used for subduing a person by administering electric shock to disrupt superficial [[muscle]] functions. One type is a conductive energy device (CED), an electroshock gun popularly known by the brand name "[[Taser]]", which fires projectiles that administer the shock through a thin, flexible wire. Although they are illegal for personal use in many jurisdictions, Tasers have been marketed to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;International Association of Chiefs of Police, ''[http://www.theiacp.org/research/CuttingEdge/EMDT9Steps.pdf Electro Muscular Disruption Technology: A Nine-Step Strategy for Effective Deployment] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210211811/http://www.theiacp.org/research/CuttingEdge/EMDT9Steps.pdf |date=December 10, 2013 }}'', 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  Other electroshock weapons such as stun guns, stun batons ("cattle prods"), and [[electroshock belt]]s administer an electric shock by direct contact.

[[Electric fence]]s are barriers that uses electric shocks to deter animals or people from crossing a boundary.  The voltage of the shock may have effects ranging from uncomfortable, to painful or even lethal.  Most electric fencing is used today for [[agricultural fencing]] and other forms of animal control purposes, though it is frequently used to enhance security of restricted areas, and there exist places where lethal voltages are used.

=== Torture ===&lt;!-- [[Electric shock torture]] redirects here --&gt;
Electric shocks are used as a method of [[torture]], since the received voltage and current can be controlled with precision and used to cause pain and fear without always visibly harming the victim's body.

Such torture uses electrodes attached to parts of the victim's body: most typically, while wires are wound around the fingers, toes, or tongue; attached to the genitals; or inserted in the vagina to provide a return circuit; the voltage source (typically some sort of prod) of precisely controllable pressure is applied to other sensitive parts of the body, such as the genitals, breasts, or head. The [[Parrilla (torture)|parrilla]] is an example of this technique. Other methods of electrical torture (such as the [[picana]]) do not use a fixed wire but the prod has two electrodes of different polarity a short distance apart so as to make a circuit through the flesh between them when it is placed on the body, thus making it easy for the operator to target the shocks accurately in the places that cause the victim most pain and distress. When the voltage and current is controlled (most typically, high voltage and low current) the victim feels the pain of electric shock but is not physically harmed. Repeated shocks to the genitals will result in the victim losing control of his or her bladder and unintentionally urinating, while extensive passage of the current through the buttocks will cause the victim to unintentionally defecate.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Advocates for the [[mental illness|mentally ill]] and some [[psychiatrist]]s such as [[Thomas Szasz]] have asserted that electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is torture when used without a ''bona fide'' medical benefit against recalcitrant or non-responsive patients.

===Capital punishment===
{{Main|Electric chair}}
[[File:Singchair.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Electric chair]] in [[Sing Sing]]]]
Electric shock delivered by an [[electric chair]] is sometimes used as an official means of [[capital punishment]] in the United States, although its use has become rare in recent times. Although some original proponents of the electric chair considered it to be a more humane execution method than hanging, shooting, poison gassing, etc., it has now generally been replaced by [[lethal injection]]s in states that practice capital punishment.  Modern reporting has claimed that it sometimes takes several shocks to be lethal, and that the condemned person may actually catch fire before the process is complete.

Other than in parts of the [[United States]], only [[the Philippines]] reportedly has used this method, from 1926 to 1976. It was intermittently replaced by the [[firing squad]], until the death penalty was abolished in that country. Electrocution remains legal in at least 5 states (Virginia, Florida, Alabama, North Carolina and Kentucky) of the United States.{{when|date=July 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/state/ Death Penalty Information Center] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150523143211/http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/state/ |date=May 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15432">'''Featherbedding''' is the practice of hiring more workers than are needed to perform a given job, or to adopt work procedures which appear pointless, complex and time-consuming merely to employ additional workers.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy,'' 3rd ed., edited by E.D. Hirsch, Jr., Joseph F. Kett, and James Trefil, Houghton Mifflin Company, 2002. {{ISBN|0-618-22647-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "[[make-work]]" is sometimes used as a synonym for featherbedding.

The term "featherbedding" is usually used by management to describe behaviors and rules sought by workers.&lt;ref name="Gomberg"&gt;William Gomberg, "Featherbedding: An Assertion of Property Rights," ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,'' 333:1 (1961).&lt;/ref&gt; The term may equally apply to mid- and upper-level management, particularly in regard to top-heavy and "bloated" levels of middle- and upper-level management.&lt;ref&gt;"Featherbedding Brass," ''Time,'' May 14, 1956; C.A. Myers, "Top Management Featherbedding?", ''Sloan Management Review,'' 24:4 (1983).&lt;/ref&gt; Featherbedding has also been occasionally used to describe [[rent-seeking]] behavior by corporations in response to economic regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Jarita Duasa and Paul Mosley, "Capital Controls Re-examined: The Case for 'Smart' Controls," ''The World Economy,'' 29:9 (September 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term "featherbedding" originally referred to any person who is pampered, coddled, or excessively rewarded. The term originated in the use of feathers to fill mattresses in beds, providing for more comfort.  The modern use of the term in the labor relations setting began in the [[United States]] railroad industry, which used feathered mattresses in sleeping cars. Railway [[trade union|labor unions]], confronted with changing technology which led to widespread unemployment, sought to preserve jobs by negotiating contracts which required employers to compensate workers to do little or no work or which required complex and time-consuming work rules so as to generate a full day's work for an employee who otherwise would not remain employed.&lt;ref&gt;''Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Law,'' 1st ed., Merriam-Webster, Inc., 1996. {{ISBN|0-87779-604-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1965 bulletin the United States Department of Labor referred to "featherbedding" as:
{{quote|a derogatory term applied to a practice, working rule, or agreement provision which limits output or requires employment of excess workers and thereby creates or preserves soft or unnecessary jobs; or to a charge or fee levied by a union upon a company for services which are not performed or not to be performed&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.du.edu/documents/transportation-law-journal/past-issues/v08/featherbedding.pdf Featherbedding on the Railroads: by Law and by Agreement]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Since the mid-19th century, "featherbedding" has been most commonly used in the [[Industrial relations|labor relations]] field. Increasingly, the term has come to refer only to work rules or [[collective bargaining]] agreements demanded by labor unions.&lt;ref name="Simler"&gt;Norman J. Simler, "The Economics of Featherbedding", in ''Featherbedding and Technological Change'', ed. by Paul Weinstein, D.C. Heath and Co., 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;

In nations where trade union activities are legally defined, legal definitions of featherbedding exist.  These definitions are few in number, and tend to be narrowly drawn. For example, the [[Taft-Hartley Act]] in the United States defines featherbedding in Section 8(b)(6) as any agreement or union demand for payment of wages for services which are not performed or not to be performed. However, in 1953, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled that the Act's definition only applies to payments for workers not to work. Therefore, work rules requiring minimum crew sizes, the assignment of duties to craft workers, and other "make-work" agreements do not constitute featherbedding.&lt;ref&gt;''[[American Newspaper Publishers Association v. National Labor Relations Board]],'' [https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/345/100 345 U.S. 100] (1953).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics==
Featherbedding is commonly seen by economists as a solution to "who should bear the burden of technological change?"&lt;ref name="Weinstein"&gt;Paul A. Weinstein, "The Featherbedding Problem," ''American Economic Review,'' 54:3 (May, 1964).&lt;/ref&gt;

Labor economists often argue that featherbedding is the most economically optimal position from both an employer's and employee's perspective. Featherbedding only emerges under certain circumstances. Chief among these is that the employer has an exploitable surplus (e.g., profit) to support the practice. Featherbedding also arises where market forces fail and organizations are permitted to be noncompetitive. Under this analysis, corporations (for example) are already inefficient and featherbedding does not make them more or less so. Featherbedding can, in some circumstances, take excess resources (profits) away from the employer and give them to workers in the form of more income per worker or higher numbers of employees at the same income level. Featherbedding is considered economically efficient because it occurs in the give-and-take of collective bargaining.  If employers were relatively strong vis-a-vis unions, unions would be unable to impose featherbedding on them. As the politico-socio-economic strength of each party changes over time, collective bargaining outcomes will as well, enlarging or reducing the number and impact of featherbedding rules on the employer.&lt;ref name="Simler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Weinstein" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd Ulman, ''The Rise of the National Trade Union,'' Harvard University Press, 1955; Clarence C. Morrison and Herbert J. Kiesling, "Featherbedding—An Easy Second Best Problem," ''Atlantic Economic Journal,'' 4:3 (September 1976).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henry S. Farber, "The analysis of union behavior," ''Handbook of labor economics'' 2 (1986): 1039–89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adam Seth Litwin, "Not featherbedding, but feathering the nest: Human resource management and investments in information technology." ''Industrial Relations: A Journal of Economy and Society'' 52.1 (2013): 23. "However, from a labor economist’s perspective, employment relations structures and processes were simply spreading the cost associated with technological change by constraining the degree to and the speed with which capital-labor ratios could be adjusted."&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent political analyses of featherbedding have concluded that featherbedding is not necessarily economically optimal, but is better than other forms of bargaining. Under this analysis, the best form of collective bargaining would be one in which the union and employer bargain not only over wages but the level of employment. Most unions in the United States, for example, bargain solely over wages. Bargaining over work rules (featherbedding) as well as wages achieves outcomes close to those reached by bargaining solely over wages, but is better than bargaining over wages alone.&lt;ref&gt;George E. Johnson, "Work Rules, Featherbedding, and Pareto-Optimal Union Management Bargaining," ''Journal of Labor Economics,'' 8:1 (Part 2, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-economic perspectives==
Legal scholars and certain social theorists argue that featherbedding may be an expression of the concept of a job as a [[property]] right. These analysts argue that while the owner or employer has the "right" to extract profit because of his or her investment of capital, so the worker has the "right" to extract profit because of his or her investment of labor. Featherbedding, it is argued, arises and becomes a significant problem in places where the job property right is not part of the legal regime and remains unprotected (such as the United States).&lt;ref name="Gomberg" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald L. Martin, "Job Property Rights and Job Defections," ''Journal of Law and Economics,'' 15:2 (October 1972); P.J. White, "Unfair Dismissal Legislation and Property Rights: Some Reflections," ''Industrial Relations Journal,'' 16:4 (December 1985); Ellen Dannin, "Why At-Will Employment Is Bad For Employers and Just Cause Is Good For Them," ''Labor Law Journal,'' 58:5 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

Seizing on economists' emphasis on power in the workplace, other social theorists conclude that featherbedding is a result of weak labor unions and unenforced and unprotected worker rights.  Under this analysis, featherbedding is a response by unions to their weakness, not strength.
{{quote|The literature is replete with "featherbedding" or "restrictive" rules that are hard to justify. Yet, before using these examples to condemn work rules as such, one has to be clear as to what the reasons are behind the restrictions. Why, for example, have unions resorted to job control devices, such as rules of demarcation and jurisdiction or seniority rules that sometimes conflict with flexibility? Frequently one finds that these rules originate in serious problems of employment insecurity or grave deficiencies in the security or recognition of trade unions.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Sengenberger, ''The Role of Labour Standards in Industrial Restructuring: Participation, Protection and Promotion,'' International Institute for Labour Studies, International Labour Organization, 1990. {{ISBN|92-9014-482-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Improved workplace employment rights, improved economic policies and less antagonistic labor-management relations, it is argued,{{Who|date=June 2010}} would reduce featherbedding.{{cite needed|date=June 2010}}

Others see certain kinds of featherbedding as a corrective for market failures.  For example, the delivery of social services is often not quantifiable except in the extreme. When the market is unable to quantify a good or service, the market will fail to accurately price it.{{cite needed|date=June 2010}} Market failure results.{{Or|date=June 2010}} In complex organizations, or in those whose inputs and outputs are difficult to quantify, it becomes increasingly difficult to determine what constitutes featherbedding.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Perrow, ''Complex Organizations: A Critical Essay,'' Scott, Foresman &amp; Co., 1979. {{ISBN|0-673-15205-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, defining "quality health care" is problematic,&lt;ref&gt;Evert Reerink, "Defining Quality of Care: Mission Impossible?", ''International Journal for Quality in Health Care,'' 2 (1990); Rick L. Nevers, "Defining Quality Is Difficult, But Necessary," ''Healthcare Financial Management,'' February 1993; Philip Caper, "Defining Quality in Medical Care," ''Health Affairs,'' Spring 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; as is defining a "quality education".&lt;ref&gt;Hans F. Crombag, "On Defining Quality of Education," ''Journal Higher Education,'' 7:4 (November 1978); Alisa Belzer, ed., ''Toward Defining and Improving Quality in Adult Basic Education: Issues and Challenges,'' 1st ed., Lawrence Erlbaum, 2007. {{ISBN|0-8058-5545-9}}; Eric A. Hanushek, John F. Kain, Daniel M. O'Brien, and Steven G. Rivkin, ''The Market for Teacher Quality,'' NBER Working Paper No. 11154, National Bureau of Economic Research, August 2005; Dan Goldhaber and Emily Anthony, ''Can Teacher Quality be Effectively Assessed?", The Urban Institute, April 2004; Jeannie Oakes, Megan Loef Franke, Karen Hunter Quartz, and John Rogers, "Research for High-Quality Urban Teaching: Defining It, Developing It, Assessing It," ''Journal of Teacher Education,'' 53:3 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; In such situations, frontline professional workers place heavy emphasis on work rules and minimums.  Many white-collar professionals (in particular those such as nurses and teachers) and highly skilled craft workers place heavy emphasis on staffing minimums, for example, as a means of ensuring a "high quality" outcome.&lt;ref&gt;"Nurses and hospitals are increasingly agreeing that various departments have a minimum number of nurses, and teachers' contracts are specifying maximum class sizes, in effect guaranteeing that school districts have a minimum number of teachers for the student population." Steven Greenhouse, "Big Audience Guaranteed For This Labor Dispute," ''New York Times,'' March 9, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; While some argue that this is an exercise in the professional judgment of such workers,&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Cleland, "The Professional Model," ''American Journal of Nursing,'' 75:2 (February 1975); David Lewin and Bruce Kaufman, eds., ''New Research on Labor Relations and the Performance of University HR/IR Programs,'' 1st ed., JAI Press, 2000. {{ISBN|0-7623-0750-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; others call this featherbedding and point to the low level of evidence that such rules improve outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Jess B. Weiss, "Perspectives: An Anesthesiologist," ''Health Affairs,'' Fall 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

==International perspectives==
===Brazil===
In [[Brazil]], featherbedding is considered endemic in government-owned and private-sector industries. Some analysts argue that featherbedding is a reaction to economic insecurity, and helps stabilize the national economy by spreading wealth.&lt;ref&gt;M. Delal Baer, "Profiles in Transition in Latin America and the Caribbean," ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,'' 526 (March 1993); William F. Maloney, "Informality Revisited," ''World Development,'' 32:7 (July 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
In [[France]], featherbedding was encouraged by the nationalized rail transportation system after World War Two with a view to keeping down the unemployment rate. This was in addition to railway express rates being kept very low. The railroad ran at a huge deficit as a result.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ted Morgan (writer)|De Gramont, Sanche]], ''The French, Portrait of a People'', G. P. Putman's Sons, New York, 1969, p. 440&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
In post-[[World War II|war]] [[Japan]], featherbedding is uncommon. A [[post-war consensus]] emerged among labor unions that featherbedding was not in the best interest of workers, and unions in Japan have tended to avoid the practice. A heavy government emphasis on [[full employment]] and a strong [[social safety net]] helped reinforce this consensus.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J. DiLorenzo, "Japanese Labor Relations: Are There Lessons for the U.S.?", ''Journal Journal of Labor Research,'' 11:3 (September, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
There are no national, regional, or local statutes or regulations governing labor unions in [[Sweden]]. Sweden has no national bureau or agency overseeing or regulating labor relations, and no agency monitors or regulates internal trade union matters. Nevertheless, despite relatively close relationships between employers and unions, featherbedding is almost unknown in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;Reinhold Fahlbeck, ''Trade Unionism in Sweden,'' International Institute for Labour Studies, International Labour Organization, 1999. {{ISBN|92-9014-617-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, featherbedding is also referred to as "overmanning".&lt;ref&gt;George E. Johnson, "Work Rules, Featherbedding, and Pareto-Optimal Union-Management Bargaining," ''Journal of Labor Economics,'' 8:1 (Part 2; January 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the U.S., the [[Taft-Hartley Act]] defines and outlaws featherbedding.&lt;ref&gt;"Featherbedding and Taft-Hartley," ''Columbia Law Review,'' 52:8 (December 1952).&lt;/ref&gt; However, as previously noted, the U.S. Supreme Court has narrowly defined featherbedding, leaving most practices undisturbed.

Formula LGB is a series of single seater, [[open wheel]] class race cars manufactured by [[Super Speeds]] (A division of L.G.Balakrishnan Brothers, the manufacturers of Rolon Chains and Sprockets) for LG Sports in [[Coimbatore]], [[India]]. These cars are similar to the wingless Formula Fords intended as a low cost starter series with power in the range of 90 to 100&amp;nbsp;bhp (70 to 75&amp;nbsp;kW).

The cars were launched in [[India]] in 2003 and up till 2005 only one model  was manufactured hence simply known as Formula LGB.In 2006 when another [[Hyundai]] engined model was launched the existing Formula LGB became [[Formula LGB Swift]] to avoid confusion of model name.

The '''Galva Opera House''' is a historic [[theater]] located at 334-348 Front Street in [[Galva, Illinois|Galva]], [[Illinois]]. Built in 1878, the theater opened as the ''Blue Ribbon Temperance Hall''; by 1886, it had lost its association with the [[temperance movement]] and was known by its present name. Galva's location on two major [[Glossary of rail transport terms#Railway line|railroad lines]] allowed traveling theatrical troupes to visit the theater; shows produced by local talent performed in the building as well. Local schools also used the building for their graduation ceremonies, sporting events, and school plays until [[Galva High School]] opened its own auditorium in 1932. The building was used as a [[roller skating]] rink in the 1920s and 1930s and hosted [[Lions Club]] events in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kenyon|first1=Leslie H.|last2=Davis|first2=Larry D.|last3=Ulrich|first3=Amy|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory - Nomination Form: Galva Opera House / Blue Ribbon Temperance Hall|url=http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/pdfs/200329.pdf|publisher=Illinois Historic Preservation Agency|accessdate=February 28, 2016|date=July 8, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''German ship ''Doggerbank'' (Schiff 53)''' was an auxiliary [[minelayer]] and [[blockade runner]] of [[Nazi Germany]] in [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Uboat" &gt;{{cite web 
|url        = http://uboat.net/allies/merchants/ships/2707.html 
|title      = Ships hit by U-boats: ''Doggerbank'' 
|work       = uboat.net 
|accessdate = 16 May 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laid down as the [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[merchant vessel]] '''''Speybank''''' in 1926, the vessel was captured in 1941 by the {{ship|German auxiliary cruiser|Atlantis}}, converted to an auxiliary minelayer for the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' and renamed ''Doggerbank''. After laying mines off the coast of [[South Africa]], it travelled to [[Japan]]. On the return trip, it was accidentally sunk by the {{ship|German submarine|U-43|1939|2|up=yes}}, with all but one of the 365 men on board (108 crew plus 257 prisoners-of-war) lost at sea.&lt;ref name="Uboat"/&gt;

==History==
''Speybank'' was built in 1926 at [[Harland &amp; Wolff]] at [[Govan]], [[Glasgow]] for [[Andrew Weir, 1st Baron Inverforth|Andrew Weir]] &amp; Co. The ship was captured on 31 January 1941 by German auxiliary cruiser ''Atlantis'' in the [[Indian Ocean]]. ''Speybank'' was sent back to [[France]] under the command of Paul Schneidewind and reached [[Bordeaux]] on 10 May 1941.&lt;ref name="Uboat"/&gt;

The ship was taken over by the German ''Kriegsmarine'' in 1941, renamed ''Doggerbank'' – ''Schiff 53'' (German: "Ship 53"), and converted to an auxiliary [[minelayer]]. It remained under the command of ''[[Captain Lieutenant|Kapitänleutnant]]'' Paul Schneidewind.&lt;ref name="Uboat"/&gt;

''Doggerbank'' left France in January 1942 to lay [[Naval mine|mines]] of the coast of South Africa and then to proceed to Japan. The mines were laid successfully in March/April 1942 and ''Doggerbank'' arrived in Japan later that year.

==Last voyage==
In Japan, ''Doggerbank'' took aboard many of the survivors of the auxiliary cruiser {{ship|German auxiliary cruiser|Thor||2}} and the German tanker ''[[German tanker Altmark|Uckermark]]'', the former ''Altmark'', which had been destroyed in an accident in [[Yokohama]] on 30 November 1942. In total, the ship carried 365 men on board when leaving the Far East. It also carried a cargo of 7,000 tons of raw materials and rubber, fats and fish oil.&lt;ref name="Uboat"/&gt;

The ship travelled ''via'' [[Kobe]], [[Saigon]], [[Singapore]] and [[Jakarta]], which it left on 10 January 1943, heading to France. In the mid-Atlantic on 3 March 1943, at 9.53 pm, it was torpedoed by {{GS|U-43|1939|6}}. ''U-43'' mistook it for a British ship "of the {{MV|Dunedin Star||2}} type" as ''Doggerbank'' was traveling ahead of its schedule. The ship was hit by all three torpedoes fired at it and sank within two minutes,&lt;ref name="Uboat"/&gt; with perhaps two hundred men killed instantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|url        = https://books.google.com/books?id=KvB6NPbSByAC

|page       = 257 
|accessdate = 16 May 2010
|ref        = harv
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
''U-43'' observed five life boats being launched by the ship and attempted to make contact with the survivors, but failed to get close enough because of the darkness.&lt;ref name="Uboat"/&gt; Unaware of the ship's sinking as it had been unable to send a [[distress signal]], the German admiralty took days to realise the ship had been lost.

The eventual sole survivor of the crew of 108 and the 257 prisoners-of-war on board, Fritz Kürt, was in ''Doggerbank'''s [[jolly boat]], together with the ship's captain, Schneidewind, a small number of other men and the ship's dog. The boat headed for the [[South America]]n coast, approximately three weeks away. Through suicide and accidents, the small crew was eventually reduced to two, Kürt and an old sailor by the name of Boywitt, the captain having shot himself and the ship's dog having drowned. Desperate for water and food, Boywitt drank sea water on the 19th day of their journey and died, while Kürt was too weak to even roll the dead body overboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kürt was eventually picked up by the [[Spain|Spanish]] motor tanker ''Campoamor'' on 29 March and taken to [[Aruba]].&lt;ref name="Uboat"/&gt;

The German submarine ''U-43'' was sunk on 30 July 1943 without survivors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate = 16 May 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kürt was exchanged in a prisoner-of-war swap in 1944, reported back to the German admiralty and then hid in [[Hamburg]] until the end of the war, having been about to be arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The '''Grand Opera House''', also known as '''The Grand''' or '''Masonic Hall and Grand Theater''', is a 1,208-seat theater for the performing arts in [[Wilmington, Delaware]], United States. The four-story building was built in 1871 by the Delaware Grand Lodge of Masons to serve as a Masonic Temple and [[auditorium]]. The construction cost was $100,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegrandwilmington.org/About/History History of the Grand], The Grand website, accessed July 31, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  It was designed in [[Second Empire (architecture)|Second Empire]] style by Baltimore architect [[Thomas Dixon (architect)|Thomas Dixon]] and incorporates symbolism from [[Freemasonry]] into the cast-iron facade.  Its central [[pediment]] contains an [[Eye of Providence]].

Historically, the Grand hosted a variety of operas, symphonies, [[Victorian literature|Victorian]] melodramas, [[minstrel show]]s, [[burlesque]], [[vaudeville]], and other exhibitions, including performers such as [[Ethel Barrymore]], [[Buffalo Bill|"Buffalo Bill" Cody]] and [[John Philip Sousa]]. For most of the twentieth century the Grand was operated exclusively as a movie theater, run by [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]] from 1930 and eventually closing in 1967.  It was reopened four years later and returned to programming emphasizing [[classical music]], partnering with the [[Delaware Symphony Orchestra]], [[OperaDelaware]], and the [[First State Ballet Theatre]].

It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1972 with assertions of both architectural and historical significance.  It was argued it is "one of the finest remaining examples of 19th century cast iron architecture in America" and that it has important association with events and persons in Delaware's history.&lt;ref name=nris/&gt;&lt;ref name="nrhpinv3"&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=72000294}} |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: The Masonic Hall and Grand Theater / The Masonic Temple and Grand Opera House |date=July 1972 |author=Robert Dick Stoddard, Jr. |publisher=National Park Service}} and {{NRHP url|id=72000294|title=''Accompanying two photos, exterior and interior, from 1971''|photos=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, management was turned over to a non-profit organization and the building underwent extensive restoration, which was completed in 1976.

'''Independence Day''' ({{lang-km|បុណ្យឯករាជ្យជាតិ}}) is a [[National Day|national holiday]] observed annually in [[Cambodia]] every 9 November. The date celebrates Cambodia's Declaration of Independence from [[France]] on 9 November 1953. The site to celebrate the ceremony is at [[Independence Monument (Cambodia)|Independence Monument]]. The vital celebrations are held in the capital city, [[Phnom Penh]] although there are some celebrations in many provinces.&lt;ref name="Officeholiday: Cambodian Independence Day"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cambodian Independence Day |url=http://www.officeholidays.com/countries/cambodia/independence_day.php|publisher=Officeholidays|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
France started controlling Cambodia in 1863. After being colonized around 80 years, King [[Norodom Sihanouk]] began claiming dependence from France in 1949. In 1953, he was successful to gain full independence, and France agreed to decolonize the whole country. Due to this accomplishment, Cambodian citizens viewed him as "the father of independence (ព្រះមហាវីរបុរសជាតិ – ព្រះបិតាឯករាជ្យជាតិ)",&lt;ref name=" សែម ឬទ្ធី: ប្រវត្តិទិវាបុណ្យឯករាជ្យជាតិ"&gt;{{cite web|title=Background of Cambodian Independence Day |url=http://www.interconrooster.com/project/0711171550/|publisher=Sem Rithy|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which depicts that he was the hero of the country. He made the country to develop rapidly.

== Celebration ==
Every year, Independence Day is a very special and happy day for the whole nation. It portrayed the Khmer success over colonization. It is celebrated in many places&lt;ref name="khemaradaily: រដ្ឋបាលខេត្តរតនគិរីប្រារព្ធខួបអនុស្សាវរីយ៍លើកទី ៦៤ ទិវាឯករាជ្យជាតិ ៩ វិច្ឆិកា ១៩៥៣- ៩ វិច្ឆិកា ២០១៧"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cambodian Independence Day in Ratanakiri |url=http://www.khemaradaily.com/p/119108|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; around the country, and the absolutely crucial one takes place at Independence Monument (វិមានឯករាជ្យ) in Phnom Penh.

On that day, all the leaders and representatives of state organizations and public departments must participate and celebrate the formal ceremony in the morning. Usually the roads around the Independence Monument are closed to provide the space for the ceremony. The whole ceremony is broadcast on national television and radio. Other channels also broadcast it from the National TV. Therefore, the people around the country can watch it.

Every state palace is decorated with some slogans related to the independence of Cambodia, and the lights. At night, there is firework in the Chatomuk River (ទន្លេចតុមុខ) located in front of the Royal Palace. Because it is the holiday, there are a lot of people going out to see that event in front of the Royal Palace and Chroy Changvar area, which is opposite to the Royal Palace.

The '''Kaga Rebellion''' or '''Chōkyō Uprising''' was a large-scale revolt in [[Kaga Province]] (present-day southern [[Ishikawa Prefecture]]), Japan, in late 1487 through 1488. [[Togashi Masachika]], who ruled Kaga Province as ''[[shugo]]'', had been restored to power in 1473 with aid from the [[Asakura clan]] as well as the [[Ikkō-ikki]], a loose collection of lesser nobility, monks, and farmers. By 1474, however, the Ikkō-ikki grew discontent with Masachika, and launched some initial revolts, which were easily quelled. In 1487, when Masachika left on a military campaign, between one hundred thousand and two hundred thousand Ikkō-ikki revolted. Masachika returned with his army, but the Ikkō-ikki, backed by several disaffected vassal families, overwhelmed his army and surrounded him in his palace, where he committed ''[[seppuku]]''. The former vassals of Masachika granted the position of ''shugo'' to Masachika's uncle Yasutaka, but over the next several decades, the Ikkō-ikki increased their political hold on the province, which they would [[Kaga ikki|effectively control for almost a century]].

==Background and initial revolts==
{{see also|Ikkō-ikki}}
During the 15th century in Japan, peasant revolts, known as ''ikki'', became much more commonplace. During the turmoil of the [[Ōnin War]] (1467–1477) and subsequent years, these rebellions increased in both frequency and success. Many of these rebels became known as [[Ikkō-ikki]], a collection of peasant farmers, Buddhist monks, Shinto priests, and [[jizamurai]] (lesser nobles) who all espoused belief in the [[Jōdo Shinshū]] sect of Buddhism. [[Rennyo]], the [[Hongan-ji]] abbot who led the Jōdo Shinshū movement, attracted a large following in Kaga and [[Echizen Province]], but distanced himself from the political goals of the ''ikki'', advocating violence only for self-defense or defense of one's religion.{{sfn|McMullin|2014|p = 38}}

During the mid-15th century, a civil war broke out among the Togashi clan over the position of ''[[shugo]]''. Togashi Masachika had been driven out of Kaga by his younger brother, Kochiyo. When the Ōnin War broke out in 1467, Masachika sided with [[Hosokawa clan|Hosokawa]] and Kochiyo with [[Yamana clan|Yamana]].{{Sfn|Turnbull|2005|p = 42}} In 1473, Masachika requested aid from [[Asakura Toshikaga]], the lord of Echizen and ally of Hosokawa, as well as from the priests of [[Yoshizaki-gobō|Yoshizaki]], who were associated with Rennyo.{{sfn|Davis|1988|p = 239}}{{sfn|Weinstein|1977|p = 355}} Masachika promised the ''ikki'' that if restored to power, he would lift his supporters out of their poverty. Further motivating the ''ikki'' to support Masachika were the religious policies of Kochiyo: Kochiyo patronized the Takada school of Jōdo Shinshū, a fierce rival to the Hongan-ji for control of the Shinshū sect, and persecuted followers of the Hongan-ji.{{sfn|Weinstein|1977|p = 355}}{{sfn|Solomon|1996|p = 414}} Toshikaga pledged his support, as did the Yoshizaki priests, the latter prior to any approval from Rennyo.{{sfn|Weinstein|1977|p = 356}} Rennyo eventually granted his approval to the actions of the Yoshizaki priests, and with Toshikaga providing military aid and the Ikkō-ikki rioting throughout Kaga, Masachika quickly overthrew his brother.{{Sfn|Davis|1988|p = 239}}{{sfn|Weinstein|1977|p = 355}}{{sfn|Solomon|1996|p = 414}} But Ikkō-ikki support of Masachika was short-lived. By 1474, the Ikkō-ikki were in dispute with Masachika as they claimed that he did not fulfill his promises of economic reward, and they attempted a rebellion.{{Sfn|Davis|1988|p = 239}} Rennyo refused to support their actions and the rebels were quickly defeated and forced to take refuge in [[Etchū Province]].{{Sfn|Davis|1988|p = 240}}{{Sfn|Solomon|1996|p = 416}} In 1475, Shimotsuma Rensu, a disciple of Rennyo, falsely claimed that Rennyo supported a renewed uprising in Kaga. The revolt failed, and Rennyo excommunicated Rensu.{{Sfn|Solomon|1996|p=416}}

Tiring of his efforts to restrain the unruly Ikkō-ikki, Rennyo left Yoshizaki for the capital region.{{Sfn|Solomon|1996|p = 416}}{{Sfn|Weinstein|1977|pp = 356–357}}

==1488 revolt==
Despite the previous revolts having been easily suppressed, unrest continued to simmer in Kaga under Masachika's governance. The Ikkō-ikki who remained in Kaga grew bolder, refusing to pay taxes and even seizing tax revenue and land, despite Rennyo's continued protestations.{{Sfn|Solomon|1996|p = 416}} In 1487, Masachika left with a large army for [[Ōmi Province]] in response to a call for aid from ''shōgun'' [[Ashikaga Yoshihisa]], who was attempting to suppress the robber baron Rokkaku Tokoyori.{{Sfn|Davis|1988|p = 241}} In Masachika's absence, the Ikkō-ikki, led by Rengo, Renkō, and Rensei, three sons of Rennyo, launched their revolt and between one hundred thousand and two hundred thousand members took up arms.{{Sfn|Davis|1988|p = 241}}{{Sfn|Blum|2008|p = 161}}{{sfn|McMullin|2014|p = 39}} Masachika quickly returned from his military expedition, and defeated the rebels in several battles. However, several vassal families, discontent with Masachika, joined with the rebels.{{Sfn|Davis|1988|p = 241}} The rebels cut off Masachika from reinforcements from his allies in the bordering Echizen, Etchū, and [[Noto Province]]s, and besieged his castle.{{Sfn|Solomon|1996|p = 416}}{{Sfn|Sugiyama|1994|p = 62}} Masachika, trapped in a burning castle and faced with certain defeat, committed ''seppuku.''{{Sfn|Davis|1988|p = 241}}{{Sfn|Sugiyama|1994|p = 62}} In his place, the vassal families who rebelled against Masachika put forward his uncle and ex-''shugo'', Yasutaka, as a candidate to be the new ''shugo''.

==Aftermath==
{{Main|Kaga ikki}}

Following the overthrow of Masachika, Kaga became known as "''hyakusho no motaru kuni''" ("the kingdom of peasants", or "province ruled by peasants").{{Sfn|Suehiro|2013|p = 92}}{{Sfn|Turnbull|2006|p = 79}} ''Shōgun'' Yoshihisa, a friend and ally of Masachika, demanded that Rennyo excommunicate the Kaga ''ikki''. However, [[Hosokawa Masamoto]], an influential political figure who was also a close friend and patron of Rennyo, negotiated a deal which permitted Rennyo to merely reprimand the ''ikki'' while Masamoto would join the Hongan-ji.{{Sfn|Blum|2008|pp = 161–162}}{{Sfn|Solomon|1996|p = 417}} In Kaga, Togashi Yasutaka took power as ''shugo'', ruling the province until his death in 1504. Afterward, under the rule of his son, Taneyasu, the ''ikki'' began to assert their influence over the vassal families that supported them in the uprising.{{Sfn|Davis|1988|pp = 241–242}} The ''ikki'' soon split into rival political factions and initiated a series of political struggles which culminated in a civil war in 1531. The heads of the three predominant Hongan-ji temples in Kaga, as well as Taneyasu, were defeated when Renjun, a son of Rennyo, brought in Ikkō-ikki troops from [[Mikawa Province]].{{Sfn|Davis|1988|p = 242}} Upon Renjun's victory, the office of ''shugo'' was abolished and the leaders of the opposition were exiled.{{Sfn|Davis|1988|pp = 242–243}} The Ikkō-ikki would control Kaga until 1580, when forces loyal to [[Oda Nobunaga]] defeated them.{{sfn|Davis|1988|p = 245}}

'''Langerado Music Festival''' was an annual music festival, taking place in early spring in South Florida, first organized in 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MH&amp;s_site=miami&amp;p_multi=MH&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0F9001E14C935E01&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|title=It's Jam and Moe: Jam at Fort Lauderdale Stadium|date=31 January 2003|publisher=[[Miami Herald]]|pages=35G|accessdate=17 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Ethan Schwartz&lt;ref name="goodbye"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pbpulse.com/music/concert-reviews/live-shows/2010/02/09/langerado-gone-without-so-much-as-a-goodbye/|title=Langerado: Gone without so much as a goodbye|last=Tully|first=Jonathan|date=9 February 2010|publisher=[[Palm Beach Post]]|accessdate=17 February 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724081723/http://www.pbpulse.com/music/concert-reviews/live-shows/2010/02/09/langerado-gone-without-so-much-as-a-goodbye/|archivedate=24 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 the festival was held at the [[Seminole]] [[Big Cypress Indian Reservation]] in the [[Everglades]].&lt;ref name="goodbye"/&gt; The festival featured primarily music of the [[jamband]] genre,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sun_sentinel/access/302554701.html?dids=302554701:302554701&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Mar+07%2C+2003&amp;author=SEAN+PICCOLI+++POP+MUSIC+WRITER&amp;pub=South+Florida+Sun+-+Sentinel&amp;desc=JAM+BANDS+TO+GATHER+IN+FORT+LAUDERDALE&amp;pqatl=google|title=Jam Bands to Gather in Fort Lauderdale|last=Piccoli|first=Sean|date=7 March 2003|publisher=[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]|pages=30|accessdate=17 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also offered a wide selection of other musical styles and traditionally offered a stage for local bands, as well.

In 2009 the festival was to be moved to [[Miami]], but on February 3, 2009, it was announced that Langerado 2009 would be canceled due to sluggish ticket sales.

On March 8, 2011 it was announced to members of the festival's mailing list that Langerado 2011 was to be relaunched by C3 Presents and Boros Entertainment and would take place at [[South Florida]]'s Markham Park on October 8 and 9, 2011.

On June 1, 2011 tickets went on sale for the 2011 festival.&lt;ref&gt;

== List of Floods By Year ==
{{See also|List of deadliest floods}}

==== 14th century ====
* [[St. Mary Magdalene's flood]] occurred on the feast day on and around the feast day of [[Mary Magdalene|St. Mary Magdalene]], July 25, 1342. Following the passage of a [[Genoa low]] the rivers [[Rhine]], [[Moselle (river)|Moselle]], [[Main (river)|Main]],      [[Danube]], [[Weser]], [[Werra]], [[Unstrut]], [[Elbe River|Elbe]], [[Vltava]] and their tributaries inundated large areas. Even the river [[Eider (river)|Eider]] north of [[Hamburg]] flooded the surrounding land. Many towns such as [[Cologne]], [[Mainz]], [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Würzburg]], [[Regensburg]], [[Passau]] and [[Vienna]] were seriously damaged.  The affected area extended to [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] and northern [[Italy]]. The overall number of casualties is not known, but it is believed that alone in the Danube area 6000 people were killed.

==== 15th century ====
{{Expand section|date=June 2010}}
* The [[All Saints Day Flood of 1436]] ({{lang-de|link=no|Allerheiligenflut}}) on [[All Saints' Day]] (1 November) 1436 was a [[storm tide]] that hit the entire [[North Sea]] coast of the [[German Bight]]. In the [[North Frisia]]n village of [[Tetenbüll]] alone 173 people died. [[Eidum]] on the island of [[Sylt]] was destroyed, its inhabitants left and founded the village of [[Westerland, Germany|Westerland]] as a result. [[List (Sylt)|List]] on Sylt was also abandoned after the floods and rebuilt further west. Dykes burst along the river [[Oste]] and in [[Kehdingen]]. The island of [[Pellworm]] was separated from neighbouring [[Nordstrand, Germany]] and only diked again in 1550.

==== 16th century ====
* [[1530 St. Felix's flood]]
* Mississippi River Flood of March 1543. The flooding reportedly lasted for 40 days. &lt;ref&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River_floods &lt;/ref&gt;
* [[All Saints' Flood (1570)]]

==== 17th century ====
* The [[California flood of 1605|California Flood of 1605]] was caused by heavy rains and covered many parts of California in water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aquaticcommons.org/14822/|title=Southern California's megaflood event of ca. 1605 AD linked to large-scale atmospheric forcing|last=Arndt|first=Schimmelmann,|last2=B.|first2=Lange, Carina|date=1997|website=aquaticcommons.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-15|last3=Meixun|first3=Zhao,|last4=Colin|first4=Harvey,}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Burchardi Flood]] was a storm tide that struck the North Sea coast of [[North Frisia]] and [[Dithmarschen]] on the night between 11 and 12 October 1634. Overrunning dikes, it shattered the coastline and caused thousands of deaths (8,000 to 15,000 people drowned).

====18th century floods====
*[[Christmas Flood of 1717]] - Flood in Netherlands, Germany, and Scandinavia. 14,000 drowned.
* Mississippi River Flood of December 1734 to June 1735. [[New Orleans]] was inundated by the flooding. &lt;ref&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River_floods&lt;/ref&gt;
* New Hampshire Flood of 1740. The [[Merrimack River]] flooded in December. It is the first recorded flood in [[New Hampshire]] history. &lt;ref&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floods_in_the_United_States_before_1901 &lt;/ref&gt;
* New Hampshire/Maine Flood of October 1785. In New Hampshire, a significant flood struck the [[Cocheco River|Cocheco]], [[Baker River (New Hampshire)|Baker]], [[Pemigewasset River|Pemigewasset]], [[Contoocook River|Contoocook]] and [[Merrimack River|Merrimack]] rivers on October 23 which established records at [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]] which held until 1902.&lt;ref name="NH"/&gt;  The [[Androscoggin River]] flooded significantly, which destroyed many homesteads in what would become [[Bethel, Maine]]. Those that survived the flood moved uphill into less valuable, {{convert|100|acre|km2|adj=on}} plots. Turner's first mill was destroyed during this inundation. &lt;ref&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floods_in_the_United_States_before_1901 &lt;/ref&gt;
* Great Pumpkin Flood of October 1786. Central Pennsylvania flood. Received its name due to the pumpkins that were washed away in the flood on October 5. It was a major flood in the [[Susquehanna River]] basin.  &lt;ref&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floods_in_the_United_States_before_1901 &lt;/ref&gt;
* Mississippi River Flood of July 1788. Severe flooding of the Mississippi River resulted from a hurricane landfall &lt;ref&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River_floods &lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Storofsen flood|Storofsen Norway Flood of July 1789]]

==== 19th century ====
* Red River of the South Flood of 1800. According to the Caddo tribe, a "great flood" moved down the river and reinforced the "Great Log Raft" on the river.  This raft was a natural dam that increased water levels on some of the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] tributaries.  This process formed [[Caddo Lake]] &lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floods_in_the_United_States_before_1901 &lt;/ref&gt;
* Mississippi River Flood of 1809. All of the lower Mississippi River was inundated by flooding. &lt;ref&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River_floods&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mississippi River Flood of 1825. The flood of 1825 is the last known inundation of [[New Orleans]] due to spring flooding &lt;ref&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River_floods&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Great Flood of 1844|Great Mississippi River Flood of 1844]]. The largest flood ever recorded on the [[Missouri River]] and Upper [[Mississippi River]] in terms of discharge. This flood was particularly devastating since the region had few if any levees at the time. Among the hardest hit were the [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]] who lost 100 people in the diseases that occurred after the flood. The flood also is the highest recorded for the Mississippi River at [[St. Louis]]. After the flood, Congress in 1849 passed the Swamp Act providing land grants to build stronger levees. &lt;ref&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River_floods&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Great Flood of 1851|Great Mississippi River Flood of 1851]]. The flood occurred after record-setting rainfalls across the U.S. [[Midwest]] and Plains from May to August, 1851. The State of [[Iowa]] experienced significant flooding extending to the Lower [[Mississippi River]] basin. Historical evidence suggest flooding occurred in the eastern Plains, from [[Nebraska]] to the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] basin, but these areas were sparsely settled in 1851. Heavy rainfall also occurred in the [[Ohio River]] basin. In June, major flooding on the Mississippi River was experienced. &lt;ref&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River_floods&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Great Flood of 1862]] struck the west coast of [[North America]] in December 1861 and January 1862. An [[atmospheric river]] from the tropics brought 43 days of rain to the U.S. states of [[California]], [[Utah]] and [[Oregon]] as well as the Mexican state of [[Sonora]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13474">The '''long-term complications of standing''' are the conditions that may arise after prolonged time in a standing or upright position including standing, walking or running. Many of the complications come from prolonged standing (more the 60% of a work day) that is repeated several times a week. There are many different jobs that require prolonged standing. These included: "retail staff, Baristas, bartenders, assembly line workers, security staff, engineers, catering staff, library assistants, hair stylists and laboratory technicians."&lt;ref name="safeworkers.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Watson|first1=Kevin|title=MSc|url=http://www.safeworkers.co.uk/standing-for-long-periods.html|website=Standing for Long Periods|accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cornell university has calculated that "Standing requires ~20% more energy than sitting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cornell University|title=Sitting and Standing at Work|url=http://ergo.human.cornell.edu/CUESitStand.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==
There are no exact measures of how prevalent the complications are. However, European studies report that between one third and one half of all workers spend at least four hours per [[Working time]] (for an average workday of eight hours) standing or walking.&lt;ref name=whsc&gt;[http://www.whsc.on.ca/Files/Resources/Hazard-Resource-Lines/Prolonged-Standing-WHSC-Resource-Line Prolonged Standing: taking the load off], Version 2.0. From: Workers Health and Safety Center.&lt;/ref&gt; One estimate from the United Kingdom stated that over 11 million people stand for long periods of time without rest.&lt;ref name="safeworkers.co.uk"/&gt;

==Complications==

===Slouching===
{{see also|Kyphosis}}
Proper posture is often referred to as a "[[neutral spine]]"; slouching is an improper posture or a "nonneutral spine"

Slouching is often times described as improper posture, movement or rigidity of the spine, especially the cervical and thoracic regions, in relation to other parts of the body.

===Varicose veins===
[[Varicose veins]] are veins that have become enlarged and twisted, especially within the legs, ankles and feet of an affected individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/varicose-veins/basics/definition/con-20043474 |title=Diseases and Conditions: Varicose veins |author=Mayo Clinic Staff |publisher=[[Mayo Clinic]] |accessdate=December 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When standing, gravity pulls the blood downwards to the lower part of the body. Body mechanisms, such as [[vasoconstriction]] and valves of the [[veins]], assist in pumping blood upwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sirweb.org/patients/varicose-veins/|title=Society of Interventional Radiology- Patient center|author=|date=|work=SIRweb.org|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As blood is pumped through the body, the valves within the veins prevent the blood from flowing backwards. After extensive, prolonged standing, these valves can become weak and eventually fail. When this happens, blood is no longer being prevented from flowing backward. Gravity will pull the blood back into an individuals legs, ankles and feet. This forces the veins to expand or "balloon" to accommodate this extra blood.

The valves of the [[veins]] work best in concert with accompanying muscle contractions that force the blood to continue moving up the leg. Standing with some muscles constantly strained weakens these muscles and therefore the strength of the contractions. Varicose veins have also been associated with chronic heart and circulatory disorders and hypertension as well as complications related to pregnancy.

Prolonged standing increases the risk for hospitalization from varicose veins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tuchsen|first1=F|title=Prolonged standing at work and hospitalization due to varicose veins: a 12 year prospective study of the Danish population.|journal=Occup Environ Med|date=2005|volume=62|pages=847–850}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the working age population one out of five hospitalizations from varicose veins are as a result of prolonged standing. Prolonged standing leads to impeded blood flow and stasis in the veins in the lower limbs, which can cause varicose veins.

===Cardiovascular disorders===
Standing for prolonged periods can lead to certain cardiovascular disorders. In a study by Krause et al. (2000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krause|first1=N|title=Standing at work and progression of carotid atherosclerosis|journal=Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment &amp; Health|date=2000|pages=227–236|doi=10.5271/sjweh.536|volume=26|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; the authors examined the relationship between standing at work and the progression of carotid [[atherosclerosis]] in men. Standing for long periods can change the distribution of blood in the extremities. This in turn causes the blood to pool and reduces the circulating blood plasma volume leading to hemodynamic changes that impact the body. The authors reported that long periods of standing at work were significantly associated with atherosclerotic progression. This study provides evidence that hemodynamic changes from standing can influence the progressions of carotid atherosclerosis. The authors also found that men with carotid stenosis or ischemic heart disease were at greater risk for the progression of atherosclerosis . Atherosclerosis can lead to coronary artery disease, carotid artery disease, peripheral artery disease, and aneurysms.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/arteriosclerosis-atherosclerosis/basics/complications/con-20026972&lt;/ref&gt;

===Joint compression===
Standing places significant pressure on the joint of the hips, knees, ankle and feet but without any significant movement of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hazards.org/standing/|title=Standing - Hazards Magazine|author=|date=|work=Hazards.org|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reduces the normal lubrication and cushioning of synovial joints, causing them to tear. The combined effect of pressure and tearing can cause extensive amounts of pain and make it difficult to move or walk.&lt;ref name=whsc/&gt;

===Muscle fatigue===
Muscles kept in a constant stress position quickly become exhausted and can result in pain and swelling in the lower back, legs, ankles and feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safeworkers.co.uk/standing-for-long-periods.html|title=Standing for Long Periods|author=|date=|work=SafeWorkers.co.uk|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rnj.166/abstract|title=Evidence of Health Risks Associated with Prolonged Standing at Work and Intervention Effectiveness|first1=Thomas R.|last1=Waters|first2=Robert B.|last2=Dick|date=1 May 2015|publisher=|journal=Rehabil Nurs|volume=40|issue=3|pages=148–165|accessdate=23 February 2017|via=Wiley Online Library|doi=10.1002/rnj.166|pmid=25041875| pmc=4591921}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has stated that muscle fatigue and musculoskeletal disorders account for "33% of all worker injury and illness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/ergonomics/|title=Safety and Health Topics - Ergonomics - Occupational Safety and Health Administration|author=|date=|work=OSHA.gov|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considerable research has been conducted as to the extent of muscle injuries and all have concluded that these are expected but can be reduced with breaks and the availability of chairs.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Research has shown that the body experiences muscle fatigue after standing for five hours; this fatigue persists for more than 30 minutes after the end of the work day according to electronic measurements of fatigue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garcia|first1=M|title=Longterm muscle fatigue after standing work|journal=Human Factors|date=2015|volume=57|issue=7|pages=1162–1173|doi=10.1177/0018720815590293}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perception of fatigue is subjective and does not necessarily correlate with the experimental indicators of fatigue.

==Pregnancy==
Walking or standing more than six hours per day has been linked with pre-term births, low birth weights as well as high blood pressure for the mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/247272.php|title=Prolonged Standing During Pregnancy May Result In Stunted Fetal Growth|author=|date=|work=MedicalNewsToday.com|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have found that working more than 25 hours a week has been "associated with slower rates of fetal growth". They also found that, on average, there are no "negative effects of working up to 36 weeks into pregnancy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/36507-pregnancy-working-baby-growth.html|title=Standing for Long Hours During Pregnancy May Slow Babies' Growth|author=|date=|work=LiveScience.com|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Productivity==
A systematic review from Karakolis and Callaghan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Karakolis|first1=T|title=The impact of sitstand office workstations on worker discomfort and productivity: a review|journal=Applied Ergonomics|volume=45|issue=3|pages=799–806|doi=10.1016/j.apergo.2013.10.001|pmid=24157240|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that sit-stand workstations did not reduce worker productivity. Three of the reviewed studies found increased productivity when workers used sit stand stations, four reported no impact on the productivity of workers, and one reported mixed results.

==Intervention==
There is no real prevention for standing, but there are ways to mitigate time spent standing in the workplace. Experts suggest to move around and change positions throughout the day. It is best not to sit in one position for more than 20 minutes, or to stand in one position for more than 8 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/health-wellness/2014/11/03/yes-sitting-work-bad-but-standing-actually-better/7ceei6fb0B7QjgAH3FlOrK/story.html|title=Yes sitting at work is bad, but is standing actually better? - The Boston Globe|author=|date=|work=BostonGlobe.com|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If prolonged sitting in the workplace is required or desired, individuals should gradually transition to significant periods of standing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buckley|first1=J.P.|title=The sedentary office: a growing case for change toward better health and productivity. Expert statement commissioned by Public Health England and the Active Working Community Interest Company|journal=Br J Sports Med|date=2015|volume=49|issue=21|pages=1357–62|doi=10.1136/bjsports-2015-094618|pmid=26034192}}&lt;/ref&gt; When transitioning from sitting to standing, individuals might experience musculoskeletal discomfort or fatigue while the body adapts.

Companies should design workstations that are conducive to good health. Workstations should allow workers to choose between several working positions and to move easily between them.&lt;ref name="ccohs.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/ergonomics/standing/standing_basic.html|title=Working in a Standing Position - Basic Information : OSH Answers|first=Government of Canada, Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and|last=Safety|date=|work=CCOHS.ca|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, workers should be able to adjust the height of their workstations to fit their body size. Other helpful aspects of workstations are footrests, elbow rests, and seats so workers can sit when they need to.

==Footwear==

The choice of footwear can change the impact of prolonged standing. Shoes should support the foot, have shock-absorbing cushions, fit the foot well, and be comfortable.&lt;ref name="ccohs.ca"/&gt; Shoes should not be flat, have heels higher than 5&amp;nbsp;cm, or change the shape of the foot. There are also special insoles for shoes that can be used when soft mats or chairs are not available. Additionally the floors in a work area should not be metal or concrete. It is best to have cork or rubber covered floors. Floors should not be slippery.

Training and education are important components of avoiding complications from standing. Employees trained in ergonomics experience less muscle discomfort and more productivity while using sit-stand work stations than workers not trained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robertson,|first1=M.M.|title=Office ergonomics training and a sitstand workstation: Effects on musculoskeletal and visual symptoms and performance of office workers|journal=Applied Ergonomics|volume=44|issue=1|pages=73–85|doi=10.1016/j.apergo.2012.05.001|pmid=22727324|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Floor mats==

Proper floor mats can also be used to reduce stress on feet and knees. Anti-fatigue matting is recommended and launderable matting is preferred.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} A study investigating the effects of 4 different standing conditions on assembly workers showed that using mats and shoes with in-soles was perceived as more comfortable for the workers than without while standing on hard floors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=12236657|title=A comparison of the effects of floor mats and shoe in-soles on standing fatigue|journal=Applied ergonomics|volume=33|issue=5|pages=477–84|last=|first=|date=|website=|year=2002|author1=King|first1=P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31592">'''Marc Garlasco''' (born September 4, 1970) is an American former Pentagon senior intelligence analyst, now senior civilian protection officer for the [[United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan]] (UNAMA) and senior military advisor for the [[Human Rights Council]] (HRC). Having served for seven years at the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]], becoming chief of high-value targeting,&lt;ref name=spiegel /&gt; Garlasco left in 2003 and joined [[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW) as a senior military expert, specializing in [[battle]] damage assessment, military operations, and interrogations for the Emergencies Division, where he investigated [[human rights]] issues in a number of different conflicts zones. The author of a [[World War II]] German anti-aircraft medals reference book, Garlasco was suspended by HRW with pay, "pending an investigation", on September 14, 2009 after it was alleged that he had collected [[Nazi]] memorabilia.&lt;ref name="israelis_see_NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;Flintoff, C.

==Career==

Garlasco has a B.A. in Government from [[Saint John's University (New York)|St. John's University]] 1988 — 1992 and an M.A. in International Relations from the [[Elliott School of International Affairs]] at the [[George Washington University]](1992–1995)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/en/bios/marc-garlasco|title=People|access-date=2016-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lives in Pleasantville, New York.&lt;ref name=spiegel&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; Garlasco was the senior military analyst in Human Rights Watch's (HRW) Emergencies Division. He specialized in battle damage assessment, military operations, and interrogations.&lt;ref name=guardian_profile/&gt;

===The Pentagon===
He worked with a defense contractor&lt;ref name="WP-2008-02-13"&gt;White, Josh (2008-02-13). [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/12/AR2008021202692.html The Man on Both Sides of Air War Debate]. ''The Washington Post''. Retrieved 2009-09-09.&lt;/ref&gt; before being hired as an intelligence professional at the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] working in the Pentagon; he survived the 9/11 attack on the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=90716538|title=The Pentagon on Sept. 11: One Survivor's Account|access-date=2016-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claims he was Chief of [[High-value target]]ing in [[The Pentagon]] during the [[Iraq War|Second Gulf War]]&lt;ref name=guardian_profile/&gt; where he claimed to lead the effort to track and target [[Saddam Hussein]]. The initial targets and attack, known as the "DECAP strike", was identified by the CIA and the actual attacks were planned by TLAM and F-117 (see:[[2003 invasion of Iraq#Opening salvo: the Dora Farms strike|Dora Farms]]). Garlasco was a member of the [[Operation Desert Fox]] (Iraq) [[Bomb damage assessment|Battle Damage Assessment]] team in 1998, led a Pentagon Battle Damage Assessment team to [[Kosovo]] in 1999 and recommended several thousand aimpoints on targets during military operations in Iraq and [[1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|Serbia]].&lt;ref name=guardian_profile/&gt;  Later that year Garlasco debriefed Iraqi nationals to gather intelligence about Saddam Hussein. He described it as "contingency planning for a war that was probably never going to be fought."&lt;ref name="WP-2008-02-13"/&gt; He also participated in over 50 interrogations as a subject matter expert.&lt;ref name=guardian_profile&gt;[http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/marc_garlasco/profile.html Marc Garlasco profile at guardian.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; In total, Garlasco served for seven years in [[the Pentagon]].&lt;ref name=guardian_profile /&gt;

In 2003, Garlasco was responsible for dropping two, laser-guided, 500-kilogram bombs on a house in the Tuwaisi, neighborhood of [[Basra]], Iraq, that he believed to contain Saddam Hussein's cousin [[Ali Hassan al-Majid]], also known as Chemical Ali, the man responsible for launching poison gas attacks on Kurds in Iraq beginning in 1988.&lt;ref name=spiegel /&gt; Watching the attack via satellite form a room in the Pentagon, Garlasco threw his arms in the air and shouted: "I just blew up Chemical Ali!" However, Chemical Ali was not in the house; 17 other people were killed instead.&lt;ref name=spiegel /&gt; Garlasco left his Pentagon job in 2003 two weeks after the failed attack&lt;ref name="WP-2008-02-13"/&gt; to take a position as senior military analyst at Human Rights Watch.&lt;ref name=cbs_60min /&gt;

Garlasco explained the calculus of civilian deaths in high-value targeting to the television news program [[60 Minutes]] this way, "Our number was 30. So, for example, Saddam Hussein. If you're gonna kill up to 29 people in a strike against Saddam Hussein, that's not a problem. But once you hit that number 30, we actually had to go to either President Bush, or Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld."  Garlasco told the interviewer that prior to the invasion of Iraq, he personally recommended 50 high-value targets for air strikes, but, according to Garlasco, none of the targets on his list was actually killed. Rather, "a couple of hundred civilians at least" were killed in strikes he recommended.&lt;ref name=cbs_60min /&gt; Garlasco defended the efforts made by the American military to minimize civilian casualties, "I don't think people really appreciate the gymnastics that the U.S. military goes through in order to make sure that they're not killing civilians".&lt;ref name=cbs_60min&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/10/25/60minutes/main3411230_page2.shtml Bombing Afghanistan, Afghan President Tells 60 Minutes That Too Many Civilians Are Being Killed], Aug. 31, 2008, CBS News, 60 Minutes&lt;/ref&gt;  He responded to the question "If so much care is being taken why are so many civilians getting killed?" by stating "Because the Taliban are violating international law, and because the U.S. just doesn't have enough troops on the ground. You have the Taliban shielding in people's homes. And you have this small number of troops on the ground. And sometimes the only thing they can do is drop bombs."&lt;ref name=cbs_60min /&gt;

===Human Rights Watch===
After leaving the Pentagon, Garlasco joined [[Human Rights Watch]] as a senior military analyst; his task was to document [[War crimes|laws-of-war violations]] and other atrocities committed during significant conflicts around the world. In an interview he gave for the [[Washington Post]] Garlasco described the transition from targeter to human rights advocate; "I had been a part of it, so it was a lot harder than I thought it would be. It really dawned on me that these aren't just nameless, faceless targets. This is a place where people are going to feel ramifications for a long time."&lt;ref name="WP-2008-02-13" /&gt;

In December 2003, Garlasco co-authored the report 'Off Target - The Conduct of the War and Civilian Casualties in Iraq' after carrying out field work with two other HRW staff to investigate the effect of the [[air war]], [[ground war]], and the immediate post-combat environment on civilians after the fall of Baghdad to U.S. led Coalition forces in the [[Iraq War]].&lt;ref name="HRW-OffTarget-ACK"&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2009-09-16}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Garlasco and colleagues focused on the main fighting areas in the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] river valleys where civilian deaths had been reported, visiting ten cities in total.&lt;ref name="HRW-OffTarget-SUM"/&gt; The report focused on the identification and investigation of potential violations of international humanitarian law by both Coalition and Iraqi forces together with the identification of patterns of conflict which may have resulted in avoidable civilian casualties.
&lt;ref name="HRW-OffTarget-SUM"/&gt; Garlasco and his co-author stated that Iraqi forces had committed various violations of international humanitarian law which may have resulted in significant civilian casualties and claimed that the widespread use of [[cluster munitions]] in populated areas by Coalition forces killed or wounded more than 1,000 civilians.&lt;ref name="HRW-OffTarget"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2004, Garlasco co-authored the report 'Razing Rafah: Mass Home Demolitions in the Gaza Strip' after carrying out research with two other HRW staff in the [[Gaza Strip]], [[Israel]], and [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name="HRW-RazingRafah-ACK"&gt;{{cite web

|title=Razing Rafah - I. SUMMARY
|date=2004-10-17
|publisher=Human Rights Watch
|accessdate=2009-09-28}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The report documented what it described as a "pattern of illegal demolitions" by the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] in [[Rafah]], a refugee camp and city at the southern end of the Gaza Strip on the border with Egypt where sixteen thousand people lost their homes after the Israeli government approved a plan to expand the de facto [[Philadelphi Route|"buffer zone"]] in May 2004.&lt;ref name="HRW-RazingRafah-SUM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW-RazingRafah"&gt;{{cite web

|date=2004-10-17
|publisher=Human Rights Watch
|accessdate=2009-09-29}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Garlasco and colleagues examined the background to and effects of the demolitions, the security situation in Rafah, the IDF's main stated rationales for the demolitions, responding to and preventing attacks on its forces and the suppression of weapons smuggling through tunnels from Egypt,&lt;ref name="HRW-RazingRafah-SEC"&gt;{{cite web

|date=2004-10-17
|publisher=Human Rights Watch
|accessdate=2009-09-28}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and concluded that in most cases the demolitions were "carried out in the absence of military necessity" in violation of international law.&lt;ref name="HRW-RazingRafah-SUM"/&gt;

Garlasco has made it a personal objective to prevent the use of cluster munitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/12/AR2008021202692.html | work=The Washington Post | title=The Man on Both Sides of Air War Debate | first=Josh | last=White | date=2008-02-13 | accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He co-authored the 2006 [[Human Rights Watch]] report condemning [[Israel]]'s use of such weapons in [[Lebanon]] and a report in 2008 documenting how civilians living in [[South Ossetia]] suffered the use of cluster munitions by both the [[Russia]]n and [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] armies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2008/02/16/flooding-south-lebanon-0 Flooding South Lebanon: Israel's Use of Cluster Munitions in Lebanon in July and August 2006]. Human Rights Watch, 2/16/08&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2009/04/14/dying-practice-0 A Dying Practice: Use of Cluster Munitions by Russian and Georgia in August 2008]. Human Rights Watch, 4/14/09&lt;/ref&gt; Colin Kahl, a professor of security studies at Georgetown University, said that Garlasco "knows more about airstrikes than anyone in the world who isn't in the military currently", adding that "when Marc says stuff is messed up, the military has to take it seriously. It's not some wing nut in a human rights group out to get the military".&lt;ref name="WP-2008-02-13" /&gt;

According to [[Haaretz]], Garlasco worked in the Pentagon for seven years and "was known over the last years of his career for his harsh condemnation of Israel".&lt;ref name= haaretz_1113&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1113728.html Former HRW analyst said to be avid collector of Nazi souvenirs], Haaretz, Sept. 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

John H. Richardson, a writer at ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', writes that Garlasco's work on torture scandals in Iraq resulted in testimony from American soldiers that led directly to [[John McCain]]'s anti-torture [[Detainee Treatment Act|amendment]].  Richardson also writes that Garlasco was one of the first foreigners to cross the border into Georgia during its war with Russia, and that during the [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Gaza War]] Garlasco lived in an apartment in the middle of the war zone and spent weeks visiting hospitals and bomb sites.&lt;ref name=Esquire&gt;Richardson, John."[http://www.esquire.com/the-side/richardson-report/marc-garlasco-nazi-controversy-101309 Why Is This Good Man Getting Hung Out to Dry?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015073334/http://www.esquire.com/the-side/richardson-report/marc-garlasco-nazi-controversy-101309 |date=2009-10-15 }}" ''Esquire'' (Oct 2009). Accessed October 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Garlasco has attracted some criticism for his reporting, with the ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', for example, suggesting in an editorial that he "has made a career of painting Israel as a criminal state".&lt;ref&gt;[https://ottawacitizen.com/opinion/secret+motives/1998271/story.html ''Not-so-secret motives'', Ottawa Citizen], September 16, 2009 (retrieved September 22, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Garlasco appeared as an expert in the documentary film ''[[No End in Sight]]'', which examined in detail some of the key decisions made by the US military and the Pentagon in the early days after the invasion of Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ferguson|first=Charles|title=No end in sight: Iraq's descent into chaos|publisher=PublicAffairs|year=2008|page=9|isbn=978-1-58648-608-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RReuw-_oCzoC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also featured in a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' story on US military targeting practices that aired October 28, 2007.&lt;ref name=cbs_60min /&gt;

Emma Daly confirmed in March 2010 that Garlasco resigned from Human Rights Watch in February 2010, and offered no elaboration.&lt;ref name=jpquit&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=170313 After ‘Post' query, HRW says top military analyst quit, Jerusalem Post], (retrieved March 5, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Nations===
Beginning in 2011, Garlasco served as senior civilian protection officer for [[United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan]] (UNAMA).&lt;ref name="unmissions1"/&gt; Heading the UN's Protection of Civilians office, Garlasco monitored civilian casualty rates, and admonished Taliban leader [[Mullah Mohammad Omar]] to refrain from using [[Land mine|mine]]s.&lt;ref name="unmissions1"/&gt; In early 2012, as the U.N. senior military advisor for the [[Human Rights Council]]'s (HRC) [[Independent Commission of Inquiry]] on [[Libya]], he investigated civilian casualties while leading a survey of [[NATO]]'s [[Operation Unified Protector|activities in Libya]].&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1"/&gt;

==Suspension from HRW over Nazi memorabilia==

On September 14, 2009 Garlasco was suspended with pay after a controversy arose regarding when it was publicized that he collects Nazi memorabilia.&lt;ref name="israelis_see_NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NPR /&gt; Criticism that had started to appear, posted by what the Guardian called Pro-Israeli bloggers, had questioned the appropriateness of Garlasco's hobby.&lt;ref name=guardian_allegations /&gt; Garlasco has stated his hobby of collecting German and American World War memorabilia from the Second World War is because of his family history and his interest in military history.

===Initial controversy===
On September 9, 2009 ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'' quoted blogger [[Omri Ceren]] saying that Garlasco is "obsessed with the color and pageantry of Nazism, has published a detailed 430-page book on Nazi war paraphernalia, and participates in forums for Nazi souvenir collectors".&lt;ref name="JP=2009-09-09"&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Israel/HRW-expert-collects-Nazi-memorabilia 'HRW expert collects Nazi memorabilia'], JPost, September 09 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Other newspapers such as ''[[The Guardian]]'' and ''[[Haaretz]]'' covered the controversy in the following days.&lt;ref name= haaretz_1113 /&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian_allegations /&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]'' reported on what it described as "mounting internet attacks on Garlasco". Pro-Israeli bloggers had questioned the appropriateness of Garlasco's hobby and discovered one blogpost in which Garlasco wrote, "The leather [[Uniforms and insignia of the Schutzstaffel|SS jacket]] makes my blood go cold it is so COOL!"&lt;ref name=guardian_allegations&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli Prime Minister [[Binyamin Netanyahu|Benyamin Netanyahu]]'s policy director commented that Human Rights Watch's employment of "a man who trades and collects Nazi memorabilia" as its senior military expert is a "new low".&lt;ref name="JP=2009-09-09"/&gt;

=== HRW response ===
Though Garlasco initially responded to the allegations under the pen name Flak88,&lt;ref name=maariv /&gt; writing "I would reply, but I don't want to encourage them...  Anyway, I doubt if they read my book. More than anything else, it is related to my work."
&lt;ref name="maariv"&gt;[http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/ART1/940/098.html?hp=1&amp;loc=31&amp;tmp=7486 Maariv], Sept. 9, 2009, English translation available here [http://www.imra.org.il/story.php3?id=45684]&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently apologized, writing on [[Huffington Post]], "I deeply regret causing pain and offense with a handful of juvenile and tasteless postings I made on two websites that study Second World War artifacts".  Garlasco added, "I've never hidden my hobby, because there's nothing shameful in it, however weird it might seem to those who aren't fascinated by military history".  He also wrote that the allegations of Nazi sympathies were "defamatory nonsense, spread maliciously by people with an interest in trying to undermine Human Rights Watch's reporting," and that "I work to expose war crimes and the Nazis were the worst war criminals of all time". He added, "[p]recisely because it's so obvious that the Nazis were evil, I never realized that other people, including friends and colleagues, might wonder why I care about these things". He went on to say that "I told my daughters, as I wrote in my book, that "the war was horrible and cruel, that Germany lost and for that we should be thankful".&lt;ref name="Huff-2009-09-11"&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

HRW Communications Director Emma Daly at first responded to the charge by saying, "Marc Garlasco is not pro-Nazi. These allegations are monstrous. He does not delve into Nazi memorabilia. Garlasco is a student of military history and he has an interest in military history". HRW later issued an official statement that the accusation against Garlasco "is demonstrably false and fits into a campaign to deflect attention from Human Rights Watch's rigorous and detailed reporting on violations of international human rights and humanitarian law by the Israeli government," adding that Garlasco "has never held or expressed Nazi or [[anti-Semitic]] views".&lt;ref name="HRW-2009-09-10"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;  HRW associate director Carroll Bogert accused ''The Guardian'' of "repeat[ing] defamatory nonsense unworthy of [the] newspaper," adding that "[t]he allegations of pro-Nazi sympathies are part of a larger campaign to smear non-governmental organisations which criticise the Israel Defense Forces' conduct of the Gaza offensive".&lt;ref name="G-2009-09-12"&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; Iain Levine, the watchdog's programme director responded by saying that "The Israeli government is trying to eliminate the space for legitimate criticism of the conduct of the IDF, and this is the latest salvo in that campaign".&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/15/human-rights-watch-nazi-israel ''The Guardian'' "Human Rights Watch investigator suspended over Nazi memorabilia," September 15, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

In what has been described by Ed Pilkington of ''The Guardian'' as an "abrupt change of tact" (''sic'') for Human Rights Watch,&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt; Garlasco was "suspended with pay" from HRW pending an investigation.&lt;ref name="israelis_see_NYT" /&gt; According to Bogert, "[W]e have questions as to whether we've learned everything we need to know".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8256284.stm BBC "Analyst suspended over Nazi hobby" September 15, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the suspension, HRW has indicated "This is not a disciplinary measure. Human Rights Watch stands behind Garlasco's research and analysis".&lt;ref name="google.com"/&gt;

===Other responses ===
Critics of Human Rights Watch have suggested that Garlasco's enthusiasm for Nazi-era badges and uniforms goes beyond historical interest and raises questions Nazi sympathy or anti-Semitism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbur.org/news/npr/112900014 WBUR]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[NGO Monitor]], an Israeli NGO that monitors human rights organisations for perceived political bias, described Garlasco's hobby as "problematic" and "insensitive".&lt;ref name="JP=2009-09-09"/&gt; John Richardson of ''Esquire'' magazine wrote that because Garlasco has criticized Israel for alleged human-rights violations, "NGO Monitor has decided to try to destroy Marc Garlasco — not to argue with him or dispute his statistics, but to destroy him personally."&lt;ref name=Esquire /&gt;

[[Antony Lerman]], former director of the [[Institute for Jewish Policy Research]], wrote that Human Rights Watch failed to see Garlasco's hobby "could be used to discredit his role as author of highly critical reports of Israel's military conduct in Gaza". Lerman further wrote that Garlasco working "on reports critical of Hamas and Hezbollah was ignored", concluding that "as another excuse to attack HRW, and deflect attention from its reports' findings, the Garlasco affair was a gift".&lt;ref name=LermanGuardian&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/sep/15/human-rights-gaza-israel ''The Guardian'': Judge Goldstone and the pollution of argument]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yaron Ezrahi]], a Professor of Political Science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said he did not believe that Mr. Garlasco's interest in memorabilia could support allegations of "premeditated bias," though he indicated it may hurt Human Rights Watch's credibility, and that the revelations had "armed the right-wing fanatics" who try to "demonize" anybody who questions the effects of Israeli military operations.&lt;ref name="israelis_see_NYT" /&gt; A group of ten Israeli rights groups also protested that the Israeli government has been attempting to "instill fear and silence or alarm vital organizations" that were engaging in free public discourse.&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=112900014&amp;ps=cprs ''NPR'':  Rights Analyst Suspended Over Nazi-Era Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Christian Science Monitor'', Robert Marquand claimed Garlasco's critics were using him "to distract from or obfuscate findings that war crimes and crimes against humanity may have taken place in Gaza" and that a U.N. report by [[Richard Goldstone]] showed illegal [[white phosphorus]] use consistent with Garlasco's first hand testimony.&lt;ref&gt;[http://features.csmonitor.com/globalnews/2009/09/17/gaza-war-analyst-does-his-nazi-era-collection-indicate-bias/ ''Christian Science Monitor'': Gaza war analyst: Does his Nazi-era collection indicate bias?]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Nazi scandal hits human rights group'', Katie Engelhart in ''[[Macleans]]'' magazine reported that "For HRW, the timing of the exposé could not be worse. The group has thrown its weight behind the UN-sponsored Goldstone report, which accuses both Israel and the Palestinians of committing war crimes in the Gaza strip earlier this year. Garlasco's actions will surely lead many to question the group's credibility".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.macleans.ca/2009/10/01/nazi-scandal-hits-human-rights-group/ Engelhart, K. ''Nazi scandal hits human rights group''], Macleans, October 1, 2009 (retrieved October 15, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[New York Times]], HRW Middle East advisory committee member [[Helena Cobban]] questioned on her blog whether Garlasco's military collecting activities were "something an employer like Human Rights Watch ought to be worried about? After consideration, I say Yes".&lt;ref name="israelis_see_NYT"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/15/world/middleeast/15nazi.html?hp ''Rights Group Assailed for Analyst’s Nazi Collection''], New York Times, John Schwartz, September 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; NGO Monitor head [[Gerald M. Steinberg]], a Professor of Political Science at [[Bar Ilan University]], argued that Human Rights Watch's response to the matter was "too little, too late".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/6194158/Human-Rights-Watch-suspends-researcher-who-collected-Nazi-memorabilia.html ''The Telegraph'' "Human Rights Watch suspends researcher who collected Nazi memorabilia," September 15, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Cobban says in suspending Garlasco Human Rights Watch is now "in a better position to take part in the public discussion in this country on what our government should be doing with regard to the Goldstone report".&lt;ref name=NPR /&gt;

===Aftermath ===
Emma Daly confirmed in March 2010 that Garlasco resigned from Human Rights Watch in February 2010, and offered no elaboration.&lt;ref name="jpquit"/&gt; A reporter from the ''Times Online'' attempted to contact Garlasco, who wouldn't comment. A friend of Garlasco's indicated he had "in effect" been fired, but had entered into a confidentiality agreement with HRW in which he would be paid for the remainder of his contract if he kept silent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article7076462.ece|title=Nazi scandal engulfs Human Rights Watch|last=Foreman|first=Jonathan|publisher=The Times Online|accessdate=29 March 2010 | location=London | date=2010-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerald M. Steinberg]], in an op-ed in the [[Ottawa Citizen]], wrote that while HRW had promised an investigation, it has not offered any information about it to the public, or addressed the issue of the credibility of Garlasco's reports on Israeli human rights violations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ottawacitizen.com/story_print.html?id=2679204&amp;sponsor= ''Ottawa Citizen'' ''The sad state of 'human rights' organizations,'']{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Gerald Steinberg, March 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mary Queen of Scots Got Her Head Chopped Off''''' is a 1987 play by [[Liz Lochhead]]. It explores the relationship between [[Elizabeth I of England]] and [[Mary Queen of Scots|Mary Stuart]]. It is primarily written to be from a female point of view, and is considered to be Lochhead's most successful and critically acclaimed play.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/arts/writingscotland/learning_journeys/women_writers/liz_lochhead/works.shtml |title= Writing Scotland - Liz Lochhead |publisher=BBC |work=BBC Two |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2012-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] website:

:''"[ Lochhead ] has the character of Elizabeth enact masculine types of behaviour (even appearing on stage in men’s clothes) as a means of representing the exclusion of feminine behaviour in the political realm. Mary, by contrast, wields a more conventionally feminine power, exploiting her sexuality and the emotional vulnerability associated with her sex in order to get her own way.''"&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

It was first performed by the Communicado Theatre Company at the 1987 [[Edinburgh Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=British Council |url=http://literature.britishcouncil.org/liz-lochhead |title=Liz Lochhead &amp;#124; British Council Literature |publisher=Literature.britishcouncil.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marilyn Imrie#Mary Queen of Scots Got Her Head Chopped Off|Mary Queen of Scots Got Her Head Chopped Off]] was broadcast as a [[radio play]] directed by [[Marilyn Imrie]] by [[BBC Radio 4]] on 11 February 2001.

'''''Mishpacha''''' ({{lang-he|משפחה}}, "Family") is the flagship [[magazine]] in a weekly magazine package produced by The Mishpacha Group in both English and [[Hebrew]]. 

==History==
The Mishpacha Publishing Group was founded in 1984 with the publication of the Hebrew Mishpacha magazine. Publisher and CEO Eli Paley teamed with Rabbi Moshe Grylak towards the goal of producing a magazine that would serve as a conduit for the exchange of ideas and values between the varying streams within [[Orthodox Judaism|Jewish orthodoxy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mishpacha Magazine 10th Anniversary Edition|url=http://www.mishpacha.com/Browse/Article/4122/Mega-Pesach-Issue-5774|publisher=Mishpacha|accessdate=April 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; among them the [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]], [[Haredi Judaism|Yeshivish]], [[Sephardic Haredim|Sephardic]], and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] communities. With no other weekly or monthly magazines geared towards Orthodox Jewish readership at that time, Mishpacha quickly gained popularity, in effect launching the Jewish Orthodox magazine industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=God, Jews and the Media: Religion and Israel's Media|url=https://books.google.co.il/books?id=y2o9OjOeys8C&amp;pg=PA74|publisher=Routledge|accessdate=April 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First beginning as a monthly, it became a weekly in the beginning of 1991.&lt;ref name=Ilan&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/1.4858736|title=In the Family Way|author=Shahar Ilan|date=Jul 25, 2006|website=[[Haaretz]]|access-date=Jan 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English Mishpacha launched in 2004 with a weekly package including the flagship Mishpacha Magazine and Mishpacha Junior. Mishpacha was the first full-color weekly magazine targeting the Anglo-Orthodox population worldwide, with the standalone children's magazine also serving as an innovation.  Family First, introduced to the package in 2005, was also the first of its kind, a full-color weekly magazine by and for Jewish women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Haredi Women's Lit Explodes|url=http://tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/books/108710/haredi-womens-lit-explodes|publisher=[[Tablet (magazine)|Tablet]]|accessdate=April 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mishpacha frequently addresses social problems. For example, it has addressed issues such as the ''shababniks'' ([[Haredi]] [[street youth]]) and [[Family violence|violence in the family]]; and has waged a battle against educational institutions’ discrimination against [[Mizrahim]] and the [[Baal teshuva|newly religious]]. But it brings up these issues without mentioning names, so no one will be hurt.&lt;ref name=Ilan/&gt;

Mishpacha's publications, as a rule, do not print photos of women. There have been rare exceptions to this. For example, when Hillary Clinton was running for president against Donald Trump, the magazine chose to print her face, although very obscured by a blue field. This policy is a break from Jewish tradition. Prior to 1990, most Orthodox publications , such as the Jewish Observer of the Agudas Yisroel of America&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://somehowfrum.blogspot.com/2016/11/writers-want-women-whitewashed.html|title=SoMeHoW Frum : Writers Want Women WhiteWashed|last=Frum|first=Somehow|date=2016-11-16|website=SoMeHoW Frum|access-date=2018-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;, would regularly include photos of women.

Some attribute the significant increase in Haredim joining [[Israel's army]] to Mishpacha as well as [[mental health]] awareness and mental health services access over the past decade amongst Orthodox Jewish populations to the public dialogue stimulated by Mishpacha magazines and other Jewish publications such as [[Ami (magazine)|Ami]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Technology Use in the Religious Communities in Israel:  Combining Traditional Society and Advanced Communications |url=http://jrmdc.com/papers/technology-use-israel/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20150422081621/http://jrmdc.com/papers/technology-use-israel/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 22, 2015 |publisher=Journal of Religion, Media and Digital Culture |accessdate=April 22, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Study: Orthodox Jews More Open To Mental Health Counseling, But Needs Remain|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/08/14/study-orthodox-jews-more_n_681898.html|publisher=[[Huffington Post]]|accessdate=April 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18869">'''Ms. Olympia''' is the title given to the winner of the [[female bodybuilding|women's bodybuilding]] portion of [[Joe Weider's Olympia Fitness &amp; Performance Weekend]]—an international [[professional bodybuilding]] competition that was held annually by the [[International Federation of BodyBuilders]] (IFBB). It was first held in 1980, and from 2000 to 2014 it has been held at the same time as the [[Mr. Olympia]] contest as part of the "Olympia Weekend". The 2000 contest also saw the introduction of weight classes. No overall winner was named in 2000, but starting in 2001, a posedown between the two class winners decided the overall title. In 2005, the contest returned to the one open class format. The top overall winners are [[Iris Kyle]] (ten overall and two heavyweight), [[Lenda Murray]] (eight), [[Corinna Everson]] (six), and [[Kim Chizevsky-Nicholls]] (four). In 2014, the final Ms. Olympia competition was held.&lt;ref name="2015Olympiacancelled"&gt;[http://www.hardbodynews.com/2015/01/qualified-2015-olympia/#sthash.jFbTx57L.dpbs Who is Qualified for the 2015 Olympia? ]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

===1980&amp;ndash;1989===

In 1980, the first Ms. Olympia (initially known as the "Miss" Olympia) was held with [[Rachel McLish]] winning and becoming the first Ms. Olympia. Rachel was dethroned by [[Ritva Elomaa]] in 1981, but regained the title in 1982. George Snyder lost the rights to the Ms. Olympia in 1982, and after this the contestants were no longer hand-picked, but instead qualified for the Ms. Olympia through placings in lesser contests. As female bodybuilding grew and progressed, the competitors' level of training gradually increased, with most of the competitors in the earliest shows having very little weight training experience, and the sport slowly evolving towards more muscular physiques. This trend started to emerge in 1983, with McLish not competing in the big shows, [[Carla Dunlap]] won the 1983 Ms. Olympia. Dunlap possessed a much more muscular physique than previous Ms. Olympia winners McLish or Elomaa.

In 1984, Corinna Everson won the Ms. Olympia title. Everson would go on to win six consecutive Ms. Olympia titles in a row before retiring in 1989 undefeated as a professional, the only woman ever to accomplish this.

===1990&amp;ndash;1999===
Normally, competitors must qualify for the Ms. Olympia by achieving certain placings in lesser pro contests. However, the cancellation of the Women's Pro World contest in 1990 left only the Ms. International as a Ms. Olympia qualifier. Consequently, the IFBB decided to open the 1990 Ms. Olympia to all women with pro cards, and a field of thirty competitors entered. This was also the first Ms. Olympia without the incumbent Ms. Olympia champion defending her title. Lenda Murray earned a decisive victory by winning the first Ms. Olympia competition she attended in 1990 and emerging as the successor to Corinna Everson. The 1991 Ms. Olympia was the first to be televised live. Lenda Murray barely edged out [[Bev Francis]], a former Australian powerlifter, by a single point that year. Lenda Murray faced a serious challenge from [[Denise Rutkowski]] in 1993, and some argue that Rutkowski, not Murray, should have won that year. Rutkowski shocked the Ms. Olympia contest entourage and fans by retiring in 1994, just as her career was gaining mainstream popularity and her potential for winning a Ms. Olympia title was high.

In the 1996 Ms. Olympia, six-time consecutive Ms. Olympia champion Lenda Murray was dethroned by [[Kim Chizevsky-Nicholls]] (then known as Kim Chizevsky). Chizevsky-Nicholls had previously placed 2nd in the 1995 Ms. Olympia, but her victory came as something of a surprise, since many had regarded Murray as virtually unbeatable. After being defeated by Chizevsky-Nicholls and placing second again in the 1997 Ms. Olympia, Murray retired from bodybuilding. Chizevsky-Nicholls went on to win the 1998 Ms. Olympia, held in [[Prague, Czech Republic]], the first and only time the competition had been held outside the United States.

====1992 Ms. Olympia changes====
In response to the increased size displayed by Murray and Francis at the previous Ms. Olympia, the IFBB made an attempt to "feminize" the sport.  The IFBB, led by [[Ben Weider]], had created a series of "femininity" rules—one line in the judging rules said that competitors should not be "too big".  The judges’ guide to the competitors stated that they were looking for a feminine, but not emaciated, physique. Advertising in [[Muscle &amp; Fitness]] for the 1992 Ms. Olympia featured Anja Schreiner of Germany prominently, relegating two-time defending champion Murray to a small "also competing" notice.  Nevertheless, Murray apparently met the "femininity" requirements, and managed to retain her title; Schreiner finished 6th, and promptly retired from competition. After 1992, the judging rules were rewritten, with the new rules retaining provisions for aesthetics but allowing the contests to be judged as physique contests. Murray went on to win six consecutive Ms. Olympia titles from 1990 to 1995, matching Corinna Everson's record.

==== 1999 Ms. Olympia controversy and retirement ====
The 1999 Ms. Olympia was originally scheduled to be held on October 9 in [[Santa Monica, California]]. However, one month before the scheduled date, the IFBB announced that the contest had been cancelled. The main cause was the withdrawal of promoter [[Jarka Kastnerova]] (who promoted the 1998 contest in Prague) for financial reasons, including a low number of advance ticket sales for the 1999 event. The backlash following the announcement led to a flurry of activity, with the contest being rescheduled as part of the Women's Extravaganza (promoted by Kenny Kassel and Bob Bonham) in [[Secaucus, New Jersey]] on 2 October. Last minute sponsorship came from several sources, most significantly in the form of $50,000 from Flex magazine. Amid all the turmoil, Kim Chizevsky-Nicholls won her fourth consecutive Ms. Olympia title. Also notable about the 1999 Ms. Olympia was that this was the first Ms. Olympia Iris Kyle competed in.  However, after the 1999 Ms. Olympia, Kim Chizevsky-Nicholls retired from bodybuilding and began competing in fitness and figure competitions in 2001.

=== 2000&amp;ndash;2005 ===
The 2001 Ms. Olympia featured a "surprise" win from [[Juliette Bergmann]] who returned to competition after not competing since 1989. Entering the Olympia as a lightweight, she defeated heavyweight winner [[Iris Kyle]] for the overall title. In the five years that the Ms. Olympia was contested in multiple weight classes, this was the only time that the lightweight winner took the overall title.

After five-year absence, six-time Olympia winner Lenda Murray returned to the 2002 Ms. Olympia, with Bergmann won lightweight and Murray winning heavyweight and overall.  Murray went on to win both the heavyweight and overall in the 2002 and 2003 Ms. Olympia. Murray was for the second time in her career was dethroned of her Ms. Olympia title by Iris Kyle in 2004, who won the heavyweight and overall. After her 2004 Ms. Olympia defeat, Murray, retired from bodybuilding.

==== 2000 Ms. Olympia changes ====
The IFBB introduced several changes to Ms. Olympia in 2000. The first change was that Ms. Olympia contest would no longer be held as a separate contest, instead became part of the "Olympia Weekend" in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] and held the day before the men’s show. The second change was when heavyweight and lightweight classes where added. The third change was the new judging guidelines for presentations were introduced. A letter to the competitors from Jim Manion (chairman of the Professional Judges Committee) stated that women would be judged on healthy appearance, face, makeup, and skin tone. The criteria given in Manion's letter included the statement "symmetry, presentation, separations, and muscularity BUT NOT TO THE EXTREME!" The 2000 Ms. Olympia is the only Ms. Olympia with no overall winner, with Andrulla Blanchette winning lightweight class and Valentina Chepiga winning heavyweight class.

==== 2005 Ms. Olympia changes ====
The IFBB introduced the so-called '20 percent rule', requesting "that female athletes in Bodybuilding, Fitness and Figure decrease the amount of muscularity by a factor of 20%". The memo stated that the request "applies to those female athletes whose physiques require the decrease". Another change added to the 2005 Ms. Olympia, was the abandonment of the weight class system adopted in 2000. In 2005 Ms. Olympia, Iris Kyle was dethroned by [[Yaxeni Oriquen-Garcia]].

=== 2006&amp;ndash;2014 ===

Iris Kyle reclaimed her Ms. Olympia title in 2006. Iris Kyle has gone on to win nine consecutive Ms. Olympia's in a row from 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014. With ten overall wins, Kyle has won more Olympia titles, male or female, than any other bodybuilder, and announced her retirement right after winning the title in 2014, which was when the final Ms. Olympia competition was held.&lt;ref name="2015Olympiacancelled" /&gt;

The '''parade of sovereignties''' ({{lang-ru|Парад суверенитетов}}, Parad suverenitetov) was a series of declarations of [[sovereignty]] of various degree by the [[Republics of the Soviet Union|constituents]] of the [[Soviet Union]] in late 1980s - early 1990s. These declarations stated the priority of the constituent republic power within its territory over the central power, which have led to the [[War of Laws]] between the center and the republics. The process followed the loosened power grip of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] as a result of ''[[demokratizatsiya  (Soviet Union)|demokratizatsiya ]]'' policy of the ''[[perestroika]]'' period of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].  Despite the efforts of Gorbachev to preserve the union under a new treaty in the form of the [[Union of Sovereign States]], soon afterwards many constituents declared their full independence, and  the process resulted in the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Revenge of the Past: Nationalism, Revolution, and the Collapse of the Soviet Union'', Ronald Grigor Suny, Stanford University Press, 1993, {{ISBN|0-8047-2247-1}} Retrieved on 2009-04-25
&lt;/ref&gt;

The first region to declare independence was the [[Nakhichevan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] (January 19, 1990; however [[Heydar Aliyev]], the leader of [[Azerbaijan SSR]], having roots in [[Nakhchivan (city)|Nakhchivan]], managed to keep Nakhchivan Republic within Azerbaijan).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.znak.com/2017-01-20/v_eti_dni_v_1990_godu_s_vosstaniya_v_azerbaydzhane_nachalsya_yuridicheskiy_razval_sovetskogo_soyuza "Крах большевистской империи: как гласность «довела» СССР"], ''Znak'', January 20, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The first top-level [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republic]] to declare independence was [[Estonian SSR]] (November 16, 1988: [[Estonian Sovereignty Declaration]], March 30, 1990: decree on the transition to the restoration of the Estonian statehood,&lt;ref&gt; {{wikisourcelang-inline|ru|Постановление ВС ЭССР от 30.03.1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; May 8, 1990: Law on the State Symbols, which declared the independence &lt;ref&gt;{{wikisourcelang-inline|ru|Закон ЭССР от 08.05.1990 О символике Эстонии}}&lt;/ref&gt;, August 20, 1991: Law of the [[Estonian restoration of Independence]]).

This massive [[secession]]ist event has served as a testbench for various theories of secession.&lt;ref&gt;Henry E. Hale, "The Parade of Sovereignties: Testing Theories of Secession in the Soviet Setting",  British Journal of Political ScienceVol. 30, No. 1, 2000, pp. 31-56&lt;/ref&gt;

{{for|a later Park Theatre in Manhattan (aka Herald Square Theatre)|New Park Theatre}}

The '''Park Theatre''', originally known as the '''New Theatre''', was a [[Theater (structure)|playhouse]] in New York City, located at 21, 23, and 25 [[Park Row (Manhattan)|Park Row]], about {{convert|200|ft|m}} east of Ann Street and backing [[Theatre Alley]]. The location, at the north end of the city, overlooked the park that would soon house [[New York City Hall|City Hall]]. French architect [[Marc Isambard Brunel]] collaborated with fellow émigré [[Joseph-François Mangin]] and his brother Charles on the design of the building in the 1790s. Construction costs mounted to precipitous levels, and changes were made in the design; the resulting theatre had a rather plain exterior. The doors opened in January 1798.

In its early years, the Park enjoyed little to no competition in New York City. Nevertheless, it rarely made a profit for its owners or managers, prompting them to sell it in 1805. Under the management of [[Stephen Price (theatre manager)|Stephen Price]] and [[Edmund Simpson]] in the 1810s and 1820s, the Park enjoyed its most successful period. Price and Simpson initiated a [[star system (film)|star system]] by importing English talent and providing the theatre a veneer of [[upper class|upper-class]] respectability. Rivals such as the [[Chatham Garden Theatre|Chatham Garden]] and [[Bowery Theatre|Bowery]] theatres appeared in the 1820s, and the Park had to adapt to survive. [[Blackface]] acts and [[melodrama]] squeezed [[Italian opera]] and English drama out of their preferential positions. Nevertheless, the theatre maintained its upscale image until it burned down in 1848.

==Construction==
[[Image:Park Theatre concept design.jpg|thumb|right|Architectural rendering of the Park Theatre. The design had to be abandoned during construction due to budget constraints.]]
In the late 18th century, New York's only playhouse was the decaying and increasingly low-brow [[John Street Theatre (Manhattan)|John Street Theatre]]. Tired of attending such an establishment, a group of wealthy New Yorkers began planning the construction of a new playhouse in 1795.&lt;ref&gt;Barnham:839&lt;/ref&gt; Investors bought 113 shares at $375 each to cover the estimated $42,375 cost. To plan the structure, the owners hired celebrated architect [[Marc Isambard Brunel]], a Frenchman who had fled to New York to avoid the [[Reign of Terror]] and was then the city's engineer. Part way through construction, however, the project ran out of money. The owners sold more shares for what would eventually mount to a construction cost of more than $130,000.&lt;ref&gt;Nagler:522-4&lt;/ref&gt; 
As a cost-saving measure, Brunel's exterior design for the building was not implemented. The resulting three-story structure measured {{convert|80|ft|m}} wide by {{convert|165|ft|m}} deep and was made of plain dressed stone. The overall effect was an air of austerity.&lt;ref&gt;Nagler:522-4&lt;/ref&gt; The interiors, on the other hand, were quite lavish. The building followed the traditional European style of placing a [[auditorium|gallery]] over three tiers of [[box (theatre)|boxes]], which overlooked the U-shaped pit.&lt;ref&gt;Barnham:839&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early management==
The section of Manhattan where the theatre stood was not stylish: the New Theatre, as it was called, was neighbor to [[Bridewell (New York City jail)|Bridewell Prison]], a [[tent city]]'s worth of squatters, and the local [[poorhouse]].&lt;ref&gt;Henderson:49-52&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lewis Hallam, Jr.]], and [[John Hodgkinson (actor, born 1766)|John Hodgkinson]], both members of the John Street Theatre company, obtained the building's lease. They hired remnants of the Colonial [[Old American Company]] to form the nucleus of the theatre's in-house troupe and thus give the establishment the sheen of tradition and American culture.&lt;ref&gt;Bank:115&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the men quarreled, and construction continued languorously. The theatre finally held its first performance on January 29, 1798, despite still being under construction. The gross was an impressive $1,232, and, according to theatre historian [[T. Allston Brown]], hundreds of potential patrons had to be turned away.&lt;ref&gt;Brown:12&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Park Theatre interior.jpg|thumb|right|Interior of the Park Theatre]]
New York newspapers generally praised the New Theatre:

&lt;blockquote&gt;On Monday evening last, the New Theatre was opened to the most overflowing house that was ever witnessed in this city. Though the Commissioners have been constrained to open it in an unfinished state, it still gave high satisfaction.
{{br|2}}
The essential requisites of hearing and seeing have been happily attained. We do not remember to have been in any Theatre where the view of the stage is so complete from all parts of the house, or where the actors are heard with such distinctness. The house is made to contain about 2,000 persons. The audience part, though wanting in those brilliant decorations which the artists have designed for it, yet exhibited a neatness and simplicity which were highly agreeable. The stage was everything that could be wished. The scenery was executed in a most masterly style. The extensiveness of the scale upon which the scenes are executed, the correctness of the designs, and the elegance of the painting, presented the  most beautiful views which the imagination can conceive. The scenery was of itself worth a visit to the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;''The Daily Advertiser and the Commercial Advertiser'', 31 Jan 1798, quoted in Nagler:423&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The theatre offered performances on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. [[William Dunlap]] eventually joined the management team. Hallam parted mid-season, and Hodgkinson waited for season's end before doing the same. Dunlap remained as sole proprietor; his expenses were so great that he had to make at least $1,200 per week to break even.&lt;ref&gt;Nagler:524&lt;/ref&gt; He left in 1805 after declaring bankruptcy. After a few more failed managers, the owners sold the theatre to [[John Jacob Astor]] and John Beekman in 1805. These men kept it until its demolition in 1848.&lt;ref&gt;Nagler:522&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Park as high culture==
Over three months in 1807, English-born architect John Joseph Holland remodeled the theatre's interior. He added [[gas lighting]], coffee rooms, roomier boxes, and a repainted ceiling.

After acquiring a controlling interest in the theatre, [[Stephen Price (theatre manager)|Stephen Price]] became manager in 1808. He instituted a [[star system (film)|star system]], whereby he paid English actors and actresses to play [[English drama]]s there. Price spent much time in England, including four years (1826–1830) as manager of the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], where he recruited successful actors for the Park and for a circuit of theatres in other American cities. During this period, Price left much of the operating management of the theatre to [[Edmund Simpson]]. The Park at this point was already known for high-class entertainments, but Price and Simpson's policies helped to reinforce this as they booked English drama, [[Italian opera]], and other [[upper class|upper-class]] bills, such as actress [[Clara Fisher]]. Price and Simpson also fostered the careers of many American performers, including [[Edwin Forrest]] and [[Charlotte Cushman]].

The Park burned down in May 1820, and was entirely destroyed except for its exterior walls. The owners rebuilt the following year, and reopened in September 1821.

[[Image:Park Theatre exterior.jpg|thumb|right|The Park Theatre c. late 1820s. The theatre had been rebuilt after burning down in 1820. Neighboring buildings include the City Coffee House, Sweeney's Porter House, the Theatre Hotel, and other commercial establishments.]]
In the early 1820s, the New Theatre was New York's only theatre, and the lack of competition allowed the theatre to enjoy its most profitable period.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson:51&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chatham Garden Theatre]] was built in 1823 and provided the first real challenge to the Park's primacy; the [[Bowery Theatre]] followed in 1826. The New Theatre, having lost its newness, became known as the Park Theatre around this time. At first, each of the rivals aimed for the same upper-class audience. However, by the late 1820s and early 1830s, the Bowery and Chatham Garden had begun to cater to a more [[working class|working-class]] clientele. In comparison, the Park became the theatre of choice for ''bon ton''.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson:49&lt;/ref&gt; This was helped by the evolution of its neighborhood. New York home owners had steadily moved northward from [[Bowling Green (New York City)|Bowling Green]] so that by this point, the Park stood in an upper-class residential area and fronted City Hall and a large park.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson:50&lt;/ref&gt; Coffeehouses and hotels soon followed.

Despite its upper-class luster, however, some commentators found due cause to criticize the Park. In her landmark book, ''[[Domestic Manners of the Americans]]'', the British writer [[Frances Trollope]] gave a mixed review:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The piece was extremely well got up, and on this occasion we saw the Park Theatre to advantage, for it was filled with well-dressed company; but still we saw many 'yet unrazored lips' polluted with the grim tinge of hateful tobacco, and heard, without ceasing, the spitting, which of course is its consequence. If their theaters had the orchestra of the Feydeau, and a choir of angels to boot, I could find but little pleasure, so long as they were followed by this running accompaniment of ''thorough base''.&lt;ref&gt;Trollope:263-4; emphasis in original&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Final years==
[[File:Park Row and Park Theatre (Manhattan) - desaturated version.jpg|thumb|right|Another view, ca. 1831.]]

By the late 1830s, [[blackface]] acts and Bowery-style [[melodrama]] had come to eclipse traditional drama in popularity for New York audiences. Simpson adapted, booking more novelty acts and entertainments that emphasized [[spectacle]] over high culture.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson:51&lt;/ref&gt; The patronage changed, as well, as the ''[[New York Herald]]'' noted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;On Friday night the Park Theatre contained 83 of the most profligate and abandoned women that ever disgraced humanity; they entered in the same door, and for a time mixed indiscriminately with 63 virtuous and respectable ladies.... Men of New York, take not your wives and daughters to the Park Theatre, until Mr. Simpson pays some respect to them by constructing a separate entrance for the abandoned of the sex.&lt;ref&gt;"Morning Herald: …"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nevertheless, the theatre's traditional patronage continued to support it, and the Park largely maintained its high-class reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson:52&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edgar Allan Poe]] wrote a more critical editorial in the ''[[Broadway Journal]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;The well-trained company of rats at the Park Theatre understand, it is said, their cue perfectly. It is worth the price of admission to see their performance. By long training they know precisely the time when the curtain rises, and the exact degree in which the audience is spellbound by what is going on. At the sound of the bell [signaling the start of the show] they sally out; scouring the pit for chance peanuts and orange-peel. When, by the rhyming couplets, they are made aware that the curtain is about to fall, they disappear—through the intensity of the performers. A profitable engagement might be made, we think, with "the celebrated Dog Bill [part of [[William Washington Cole|William Cole]]'s act in [[P. T. Barnum]]'s American Museum].&lt;ref&gt;Poe's ''Broadway Journal'', 1 November 1845, quoted in Poe:454&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Park Theatre was finally destroyed by fire on December 16, 1848. The [[Astor family]] opted not to rebuild it, the more fashionable clientele having moved north to [[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] and [[Fifth Avenue]]; instead they had stores constructed on the site.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10135">A '''photomarathon''' is a [[photography]] [[competition]] in which participants must take a series of photographs on predetermined subjects in a set period of time, typically 12 to 24 hours. On most competitions, part of the rules is that photos should be handed in "straight out of camera" -with no post-editing or production allowed. Photos are typically judged using criteria that combine photographic technique and creativity in interpreting the theme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://photomarathon2013.canon-hk.com/index.php/eng/home/judges Opening Category Judging Criteria], Canon Photomarathon Honk Kong, accessed 2014-07-28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fotomission.org/english/sleepless_night/index.html Sleepless Night Photomarathon], Fotomission, accessed 2014-07-28&lt;/ref&gt;

There are over 74 competitions worldwide which use some variations of the rules above.&lt;ref name=PhotomarathonList&gt;[https://fotomarathon.de/en/what-is-a-fotomarathon/fotomarathons-around-the-world/ Fotomarathons around the world], Fotomarathon.de, accessed 2017-05-04&lt;/ref&gt;

The photomarathon concept started in Madrid in 1986,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/mastababa/1808244609/in/photostream/ Madrid photomarathon 1986 poster]&lt;/ref&gt; before being taken up in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]], where a competition has been taking place annually since 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/assets/documents/events/GEES_NTT_June_2012/Day_1_Photomarathon_activity.pptx Photomarathons:  Using New Technologies to Support Student Learning and Assessment], Dr Simon Jones, Leeds Metropolitan University, accessed 2014-07-28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fotomarathon.dk/en/the-team-behind-the-photo-competition-photo-marathon/ About us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812222659/http://www.fotomarathon.dk/en/the-team-behind-the-photo-competition-photo-marathon/ |date=2014-08-12 }}, FotoMarathon.dk, accessed 2014-07-28&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the Danish competition took place in Copenhagen and [[Aalborg]], with separate competitions lasting 6, 12 and 24 hours, for both digital cameras and mobile phones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fotomarathon.dk/en/fotomarathon-2014/ FhotoMarathon 2014], FotoMarathon.dk, accessed 2014-07-28&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The photographic marathon is an idea generated by Eduardo Soto Perez,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sierra|first1=Rafael|title=1,200 participants in the photographic marathon|url=http://elpais.com/diario/1987/04/13/madrid/545311460_850215.html|website=EL PAIS|accessdate=13 July 2015|date=13 April 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antonio Bolivar Sanchez Cañete, who then were called Collective Cartela (along with Juan Antonio Manzano Aróstegui and Luis Alvarez Gallovich),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Caballero|first1=Fernando|title=Photo 24 Hours|url=http://www.memoriademadrid.es/fondos/OTROS/Imp_46025_hem_villademadrid19850315_.pdf|accessdate=13 July 2015|date=15 March 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; in late 1983. In 1984, presented to the Youth Department of the City of Madrid (Spain), where Chema de Mingo and Chus Medrano considered the interest of its sponsorship to the cultural dynamism of the city. They obtained the support of Kodak Spain and Albacolor laboratories.

In 1985 they managed to launch the first edition in Madrid with a surprising success participation (2500 photographers). This competition would be quickly imitated in cities across Spain and many others around the world. The Collective Cartela itself organized 4 successive editions in Madrid. Also held in Santiago de Compostela (Spain) and later, with his partner, Antonio de Juana, in Lisbon (Portugal).

For 24 hours the photographers had to make 24 photographs with themes that were provided to  them 4 by 4, at checkpoints that were performed every 4 hours. The first edition included 2512 participants, the film was in black and white. Participants should pass 6 dynamic controls plus the final film`s collection point. This structure was established as a functional dynamics for subsequent editions. Several version came later, half marathons of 12 hours or even less were made.

Given the impossibility that existed in Spain to properly register an idea, Eduardo Soto Perez and Antonio Bolívar, now as the company Mil Millones, SA, they proceeded to register Photographic marathon at the Legal Deposit (M-28891-1986) being subsequently also registered in the Registry of Intellectual Property of Madrid with the number 02482. The idea triumphed and soon spread in cities across Spain and other countries, photographic marathons were and are still held in many cities.&lt;ref name=PhotomarathonList/&gt; In 1987 a first Photo Marathon was held in New York, in Stockholm in 1988. In 1989 hold his first Copenhagen Photomarathon, following Berlin in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fotomarathon Berlin - 1998 - Zeitreise|url=https://fotomarathon.de/archiv/1998-2004/1998-zeitreise/|website=fotomarathon.de|accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both events continue to organize annually.&lt;ref&gt;As shown in the spanish wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Photomarathons and the European Month of Photography'''

In 2010 Photomarathons were first represented during the European Month of Photography, with a joint exhibition in Berlin, under the theme "Time travel". The exhibition was a retrospective of the 10 years of the Photomarathon in Berlin, and included the three winning series of Copenhagen and Cardiff photomarathons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdf-berlin.de/archives/www.mdf-berlin.de/en/exhibitions/exhibitions-in-chronological-order/ausstellung/zeitreise-10-mal-fotomarathon-berlin-mdfberlin%5Boffset%5D=20&amp;mdfberlin%5Bday%5D=0&amp;mdfberlin%5Bletter%5D=&amp;mdfberlin%5Bsearch%5D=&amp;cHash=443ab0173b.html 4. European Month of Photography Berlin 2010], accessed 2015-12-07&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the photomarathons in the cities of [[Copenhagen]], [[Cardiff]] and [[Berlin]] shared the same topic, with the winning photographs in each city being exhibited in the others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.photomarathon.co.uk/1-topic-3-cities-9-photos-curious/ 1 topic. 3 cities. 9 photos.], photomarahon.co.uk, published 2012-06-14, accessed 2014-07-28&lt;/ref&gt;

== Keys ==

One reason for the massive success of this contest was to combine photography and action: conducting urban photographic adventures.

The proposed themes stimulate the creativity of the participants (for example: "They come from abroad"), thousands of photographers concentrated in certain parts of the city in a precise moment (“Walking by Puerta del Sol at twelve o'clock  when I decided to take a picture of the clock"), or filled parks with excited reporters trying to capture the image suggested ("Elf, a costumed character who must be locate and photograph in the Buen Retiro Park”).

This opened a new dimension to photographic competitions introducing ingenuity, spontaneity, active participation and creativity, and perseverance and physical and mental strength to complete 24 hours of the contest.

The photographers competed but also made friends, had fun and acquired a better knowledge of their city, museums, places and services. In addition the organization prepared in each control artistic and cultural activities (small plays of theater, exhibition of short films, musical performances, art exhibitions, participatory structures, mazes, swimming in a public pool at dawn, etc.) all that were organized exclusively for the photographers during the contest.

Some of the topics that were proposed along 4 editions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1,700 participants in the fourth photographic marathon|url=http://elpais.com/diario/1988/04/18/madrid/577365858_850215.html|website=EL PAIS|accessdate=13 July 2015|date=18 April 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; held in Madrid:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1,600 young people participate in the photographic marathon to be held in Madrid|url=http://elpais.com/diario/1986/04/05/madrid/513084270_850215.html|website=EL PAIS|accessdate=13 July 2015|date=4 May 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Self Portrait," "Music, music, music", "News of the Day", "Sunrise in Madrid" "Morning Sport", "Nature, flora and fauna", "Madrid`s Cocidito", "Will jump to 12.00 from the top of the Torre de Madrid",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sierra|first1=Rafael|title=Hundreds of fans gathered in the square of Spain to photograph 'suicide'|url=http://elpais.com/diario/1986/04/06/madrid/513170658_850215.html|website=EL PAIS|accessdate=July 13, 2015|date=June 4, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Stumble", "Untitled", "Farewell" , etc.

The jury, choose among photographers and artists of renown (Ouka Lele, Miguel Trillo, Ciuco, Jorge Arranz, etc.) and, from the second edition on, incorporating the winners of the previous editions (Daniel Font, Amador Toril Jose Antonio Red, etc.). The awards were given at a mass party followed for an exhibition of photographs of the winners.

==Ancillary purposes==
The photomarathon has also been used by some educationalists as a study aid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://repository.alt.ac.uk/2179/7/RLT_A_007797_O.html School trip photomarathons: engaging primary school visitors using a topic focused photo competition], T.

==Photomarathon around the world==
There are over 80 photomarathons held around the world in over 30 countries.&lt;ref name="PhotomarathonList" /&gt; The vast majority are throughout [[Europe]], [[North America]] and [[South America]]. In [[Asia]] there is a competition in [[Yangon]], [[Myanmar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yangon Fotomarathon|url=http://fotomarathonyangon.com|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and since 2014 in [[Shenyang]], [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fotomarathon China|url=http://www.fotomarathon.cn/|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Africa a photomarathon is held in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]].&lt;ref name="PhotomarathonList" /&gt;

{{about|traditional play parties in the U.S.|BDSM play parties|play party (BDSM)}}
A '''play party''' is a social event in which people gather to [[singing|sing]] and [[dance]]. Play parties began in the 1830s in the [[United States]] as a route around strict [[religion|religious]] practices banning dancing and the playing of [[musical instrument]]s. The areas most influenced by the practice were the Southern and Midwestern parts of the United States. [[Folk song]]s, many of [[Europe]]an and [[England|English]] origin, were used as means to give the attendants choreographed movements for each phrase. No instruments were played at the events, as they were banned by the religious movements of the area. Singing and clapping were used to convey each song. Because dancing was banned, the movements took on the quality of [[children's games]]. Though the performance of play parties dwindled in the 1950s, music educators use them as ways to incorporate music and dance in their classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="90186">[[File:Arnoldo Wion 1595 Lignum Vitae p311.GIF|300px|thumb|Final part of the prophecies in ''Lignum Vitæ'' (1595), p. 311]]
The '''Prophecy of the Popes''' ({{lang-la|Prophetia Sancti Malachiae Archiepiscopi, de Summis Pontificibus}}) is a series of 112 short, cryptic phrases in [[Latin (language)|Latin]] which purport to predict the [[Roman Catholic]] [[pope]]s (along with a few [[antipope]]s), beginning with [[Pope Celestine II]]. The alleged prophecies were first published by [[Benedictine]] monk [[Arnold de Wyon|Arnold Wion]] in 1595. Wion attributes the prophecies to [[Saint Malachy]], a 12th-century [[Archbishop of Armagh (Roman Catholic)|Archbishop of Armagh, Ireland]].

Given the very accurate description of popes up to around 1590 and lack of accuracy for the popes that follow, historians generally conclude that the alleged prophecies are a fabrication written shortly before they were published. Certain theologians in the Roman [[Catholic Church]] have dismissed them as  [[forgery]].&lt;ref name="Sieczkowski" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyle" /&gt; The Catholic Church has no official stance on the prophecies, however. 

The prophecies conclude with a pope identified as "Peter the Roman", whose pontificate will allegedly precede the destruction of the city of [[Rome]].&lt;ref name=Walker/&gt;

==History==
[[File:St. Malachy.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Saint Malachy]] (1094–1148), to whom Wion attributes the authorship of the prophecies. Malachy died over four centuries before the prophecies first appeared.]]
The alleged prophecies were first published in 1595 by a Benedictine named Arnold Wion in his ''Lignum Vitæ'', a history of the Benedictine order. Wion attributed the prophecies to [[Saint Malachy]], the 12th‑century [[Archbishop of Armagh (Roman Catholic)|Archbishop of Armagh]]. He explained that the prophecies had not, to his knowledge, ever been printed before, but that many were eager to see them. Wion includes both the alleged original prophecies, consisting of short, cryptic Latin phrases, as well as an interpretation applying the statements to historical popes up to [[Urban VII]] (pope for thirteen days in 1590), which Wion attributes to [[Alphonsus Ciacconius]],&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien 1880, pp. 16 &amp; 25.&lt;/ref&gt; an attribution which was [[Alphonsus Ciacconius#Prophecy of the Popes controversy|refuted]] by [[Claude-François Menestrier]] in 1694.&lt;ref&gt;Menestrier 1694, pp. 343–344.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an account put forward in 1871 by Abbé Cucherat, Malachy was summoned to Rome in 1139 by [[Pope Innocent II]] to receive two wool [[pallium]]s for the metropolitan sees of [[Armagh]] and [[Cashel, County Tipperary|Cashel]]. While in Rome, Malachy purportedly experienced a vision of future popes, which he recorded as a sequence of cryptic phrases. This manuscript was then deposited in the [[Vatican Secret Archives]], and forgotten about until its rediscovery in 1590, supposedly just in time for a [[papal conclave]] ongoing at the time.&lt;ref name="CatholicEncyclopedia"&gt;Catholic Encyclopedia 1913, "Prophecy".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Saint Bernard of Clairvaux]], a contemporary biographer of Malachy who recorded the saint's alleged miracles, makes no mention of the prophecies.&lt;ref name="CatholicEncyclopedia" /&gt; The earliest known reference to them dates to 1587.&lt;ref&gt;Comensoli Antonini 2015, p. 738.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several historians have concluded that the prophecies are a late 16th‑century [[forgery]].&lt;ref name="CatholicEncyclopedia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brien"&gt;O'Brien 1880, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de Vallemont 1708, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish monk and scholar [[Benito Jerónimo Feijóo y Montenegro]] wrote in his ''Teatro Crítico Universal'' (1724–1739), in an entry called ''Purported prophecies'', that the high level of accuracy of the alleged prophecies up until the date they were published, compared with their high level of inaccuracy after that date, is evidence that they were created around the time of publication.&lt;ref&gt;Feijóo y Montenegro 1724–1739, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; The prophecies and explanations given in Wion correspond very closely to a 1557 history of the popes by [[Onofrio Panvinio]] (including replication of errors made by Panvinio), which may indicate that the prophecies were written based on that source.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien 1880, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

One theory to explain the creation of the prophecies, put forward by 17th-century French priest and encyclopaedist [[Louis Moréri]], among others,  is that they were spread by supporters of  Cardinal [[Girolamo Simoncelli]] in support of his bid to become pope during the 1590 conclave to replace Urban VII. In the prophecies, the pope following Urban VII is given the description "''Ex antiquitate Urbis''" ("from the old city"), and Simoncelli was from Orvieto, which in Latin is ''Urbevetanum'', old city. Moréri and others proposed the prophecies were created in an unsuccessful attempt to demonstrate that Simoncelli was destined to be pope.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien 1880, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the discovery of a reference to the prophecies in a 1587 letter has cast doubt on this theory. In this document the entourage of the Cardinal [[Gian Girolamo Albani|Giovanni Girolamo Albani]]  interprets the motto "''De rore coeli''" ("From the dew of the sky") as a reference to their master, on the base of the link between "''alba''" ("dawn") and Albani, and the dew, as a typical morning atmospheric phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Comensoli Antonini 2015, p. 737.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
[[File:Caelestinus II.jpg|thumb|[[Celestine II]] (d. 1144), the first pope mentioned in the prophecies.]]
The interpretation of the prophecies for pre-publication popes provided by Wion involves close correspondences between the mottos and the popes' birthplaces, family names, [[heraldry|personal arms]], and pre-papal titles. For example, the first motto, ''Ex castro Tiberis'' (from a castle on the Tiber), fits [[Pope Celestine II]]'s birthplace in [[Città di Castello]], on the [[Tiber]].

Efforts to connect the prophecies to historical popes who were elected after its publication have been more strained.&lt;ref name="CatholicEncyclopedia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brien" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feijóo y Montenegro 1724–1739, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Pope Clement XIII]] is referred to in a prophecy as ''Rosa Umbriae'' (the rose of Umbria), but was not from Umbria nor had any but the most marginal connection with the region, having been briefly pontifical governor of [[Rieti]], at the time part of Umbria.

One writer notes that among the post-publication (post-1595) predictions there remain "some surprisingly appropriate phrases", while adding that "it is of course easy to exaggerate the list's accuracy by simply citing its successes", and that "other tags do not fit so neatly".&lt;ref name="Allan"&gt;Allan 2009, pp. 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the reported "successes" are "Religion depopulated" for [[Pope Benedict XV|Benedict XV]] (1914–22) whose papacy included [[World War One]] and the [[atheistic]] [[communist]] [[Russian Revolution]]; "Light in the sky" for [[Pope Leo XIII|Leo XIII]] (1878–1903), with a comet in his coat of arms; and "Flower of flowers" for [[Pope Paul VI|Paul VI]] (1963–78), with fleur-de-lys in his coat of arms.&lt;ref name="Allan" /&gt;

[[Peter Bander van Duren|Peter Bander]], then Head of Religious Education at a [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] college, wrote in 1969:
{{Quote|If we were to place the works of those who have repudiated the Prophecies of Malachy on scales and balance them against those who have accepted them, we would probably reach a fair equilibrium; however, the most important factor, namely the popularity of the prophecies, particularly among the ordinary people (as distinct from scholars), makes them as relevant to the second half of the twentieth century as they have ever been.|Bander 1969, p. 10.}}

M. J. O'Brien, a Catholic priest who authored an 1880 monograph on the prophecies, provided a more scathing assessment:
{{Quote|These prophecies have served no purpose. They are absolutely meaningless. The Latin is bad. It is impossible to attribute such absurd triflings ... to any holy source. Those who have written in defence of the prophecy ... have brought forward scarcely an argument in their favour. Their attempts at explaining the prophecies after 1590 are, I say with all respect, the sorriest trifling.|O'Brien 1880, p. 110.}}

===''Petrus Romanus''===
In recent times some interpreters of prophetic literature have drawn attention to the prophecies due to their imminent conclusion; if the list of descriptions is matched on a one-to-one basis to the list of historic popes since the prophecies' publication, [[Pope Benedict XVI|Benedict XVI]] (2005–13) would correspond to the second to last of the papal descriptions, ''Gloria olivae'' (the glory of the olive).&lt;ref name="Allan" /&gt;
The longest and final prophecy predicts the [[Apocalypse]]:&lt;ref name=ibtimes/&gt;

{{quote|In persecutione extrema S.R.E. sedebit.

[[Petrus Romanus]], qui pascet oves in multis tribulationibus, quibus transactis civitas septicollis diruetur, &amp; judex tremendus judicabit populum suum. Finis.}}

This may be translated into English as:

{{quote|In the final persecution of the Holy Roman Church, there will sit [i.e., as bishop].

Peter the Roman, who will pasture his sheep in many tribulations, and when these things are finished, the city of seven hills [i.e. [[Rome#Location|Rome]]] will be destroyed, and the dreadful judge{{Efn|or ''a dreadful judge''; Latin does not distinguish definite and indefinite articles}} will judge his people. The End.&lt;ref name="See"&gt;See, e.g. Bander 1969, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Several historians and interpreters of the prophecies note that they leave open the possibility of unlisted popes between "the glory of the olive" and the final pope, "Peter the Roman".&lt;ref name="CatholicEncyclopedia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brien_s"&gt;O'Brien 1880, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Lignum Vitae'', the line ''In persecutione extrema S.R.E. sedebit.'' forms a separate sentence and paragraph of its own. While often read as part of the "Peter the Roman" prophecy, other interpreters view it as a separate, incomplete sentence explicitly referring to one or more popes between "the glory of the olive" and "Peter the Roman".&lt;ref name="Sieczkowski"&gt;Sieczkowski 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popes and corresponding mottos==

The list can be divided into two groups; one of the popes and antipopes who reigned prior to the appearance of the prophecies c. 1590, for whom the connection between the motto and the pope is consistently clear. The other is of mottos attributed to popes who have reigned since the appearance of the prophecies, for whom the connection between the motto and the pope is often strained or totally absent and could be viewed as [[shoehorning]] or [[postdiction]].

The list has most commonly been divided between mottos 74 and 75, based on the mottos that were explained by Wion and those that were not. Lorenzo Comensoli Antonini divides the list between mottos 73 and 74, based on the loose connection between [[Pope Urban VII]] and the motto "From the dew of the sky", and the reference to the prophecy in a 1587 letter, prior to Urban VII's papacy.&lt;ref&gt;Comensoli Antonini 2015, p. 737.&lt;/ref&gt;

René Thibaut divides the table at a different point, between the 71st and 72nd motto, asserting that there is a change in style at this point. He uses this distinction to put forward the view that the first 71 mottos are post-dated forgeries, while the remainder are genuine.&lt;ref name="Thibaut"&gt;René Thibaut S. J.: La mystérieuse prophétie des Papes. Namur-Paris, 1951, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hildebrand Troll echoes this view, noting that mottos 72–112 use a symbolic language related to the character of the pope and his papacy, in contrast to the more literal mottos for earlier popes.&lt;ref name="Troll"&gt;Hildebrand Troll: ''Die Papstweissagung des heiligen Malachias. Ein Beitrag zur Lösung ihres Geheimnisses.'' EOS-Verlag, St. Ottilien 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Popes and antipopes 1143–1590 (pre-publication) ===
The text on the silver lines below reproduces the original text (including punctuation and orthography) of the 1595 ''Lignum Vitae'', which consisted of three parallel columns for the popes before 1590. The first column contained the motto, the second the name of the pope or antipope to whom it was attached (with occasional errors), and the third an explanation of the motto. There are some indications that both the mottos and explanations were the work of a single 16th century individual.&lt;ref name="Brien_g"&gt;O'Brien 1880, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; The original list was unnumbered.

Proponents of the prophecies have attempted to explain it by noting that Gregory XIV's father was a senator of the ancient city of Milan, and the word "senator" is derived from the Latin ''senex'', meaning old man, or that Milan is the "old city" in question, having been founded c. 400 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien 1880, p. 63; Bander 1969, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; ||[[File:C o a Gregorio XIV.svg|100px]]

===Novels===
*George R. Araujo-Matiz's novel ''The Roman: Peter II... The Last Pope?''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=George R.|last= Araujo-Matiz|url=https://www.amazon.com/Roman-Peter-II-The-Last-Pope/dp/1419651404 |title=The Roman: Peter II...

The book begins with the Malachite prophecy concerning Peter the Roman, the last Pope in the Malachite list.
*[[Steve Berry (novelist)|Steve Berry]]'s novel, ''[[The Third Secret (novel)|The Third Secret]]'' (2005),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Steve|last=Berry |url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Third-Secret-A-Novel/dp/0345504402/|title=The Third Secret}}&lt;/ref&gt; features the fictional Pope Peter II (originally Cardinal Valendrea), who is elected Pope after the death of the fictional Pope Clement XV.
*Glenn Cooper's novel, '' The Devil Will Come'', uses the Malachy Prophecy as a part of a storyline which spans generations, leading to the "modern day" conclave to elect a new pope and the attempt to destroy the Catholic faith by an enemy of the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Devil Will Come|url=http://www.harpercollins.ca/books/Devil-Will-Come-Glenn-Cooper/?isbn=9781554688074 |author=Cooper, Glenn|publisher= Harpercollins.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Peter De Rosa's ''Pope Patrick'' (1997)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Peter|last=De Rosa |url=https://www.amazon.com/Pope-Patrick-Peter-De-Rosa/dp/0385485484 |title='&amp;#39;Pope Patrick'&amp;#39; |publisher=Doubleday |year= 1997|accessdate=2013-02-17|isbn=978-0385485487}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a novel about the then Pope John Paul II's supposed successor, the fictional [[List of fictional popes|Pope Patrick I]]. The novel assumes that ''Petrus Romanus'', the last Pope in St Malachy's list, is to be regarded as a supernatural being, and that consequently Pope Patrick will be the last real Pope.
*Susan Claire Potts' book, ''Glory of the Olive: A Novel of the Time of Tribulation'' (2002),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.amazon.com/Glory-Olive-Novel-Time-Tribulation/dp/0595223222 |title=Glory of the Olive: A Novel of the Time of Tribulation |publisher= iUniverse |year=2002|accessdate=2013-02-17|isbn=978-0595223220|first= Susan Claire|last=Potts}}&lt;/ref&gt;  features the fictional [[List of fictional popes|Pope Peter II]]. "Glory of the Olive" is the Malachite attribute of the successor to the then Pope John Paul II.
*In [[James Rollins]]' sixth [[Sigma Force]] novel, ''The Doomsday Key'' (2009), [[Saint Malachy]]'s "Doomsday Prophecy", and the conflicts between the Christians and pagans are important plot points, particularly in Chapter 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | website=Bookreporter|title=Review: ''The Doomsday Key''| author= James Rollins|url=http://www.bookreporter.com/reviews/the-doomsday-key|accessdate=September 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rainbow Serpent Festival''' is a 4-day annual open-air [[electronic music]], art, and lifestyle festival that takes place during the [[Australia Day]] long weekend, around 26 January, in [[Lexton, Victoria]], 160 kilometers west of [[Melbourne, Australia]]. The festival is mainly known for [[psychedelic trance]], [[minimal techno]], and [[chill-out music]] on its main stage, but it features other genres of electronic music and non-electronic music on the smaller stages. The festival also has many art installations, workshops, and other attractions. The festival has expanded from a solely music event to an event that places an emphasis on sustainability, well-being, performance and art. It includes market stalls, healing arts and multi-cultural foods. Approximately 12,000 people attend the festival each year.

Many people dress up in colourful costumes, often featuring glitter and beads. Some of the days have themes; in 2016, these themes included different colour parties and a Safari day.

The name Rainbow Serpent comes from the [[Indigenous Australians]] [[dreamtime]] [[creation myth]] of the [[Rainbow Serpent]]. The first edition of the festival was in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=World's artists getting into Rainbow Serpent Spirit | url=http://www.thecourier.com.au/story/61373/worlds-artists-getting-into-rainbow-serpent-spirit/ | first=Jennifer | last=Greive | work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] | date=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Festival organizers have been criticized for the amount of drugs and sexual assault at the event and, in 2016, the future of the festival was questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-01-28/police-question-future-of-victorian-festival-after-drug-driving/7120632 | title=Rainbow Serpent Festival's future questioned after 40 drug drivers caught | work=[[ABC Online]] | date=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/entertainment/music/police-want-to-cut-length-of-rainbow-serpent-festival-following-death-of-22yearold-20170208-gu7x8h.html | title=Police want to cut length of Rainbow Serpent Festival following death of 22-year-old | first=Hannah | last=Francis | work=[[Brisbane Times]] | date=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/police-slam-extremely-high-risk-behaviour-at-rainbow-serpent-music-festival-after-death-20170131-gu227s.html | title=Police slam extremely high risk behaviour at Rainbow Serpent music festival after death | first=Tom | last=Cowie | work=[[The Age]] | date=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, fans have defended the festival in response to critical reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.theherald.com.au/story/3692841/punters-leap-to-defence-of-serpent-festival/ | title=Rainbow Serpent Festival defended by punters | last=Wrigley | first=Brendan | work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] | date=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The festival has a social services space called "The Nest" to address instances of sexual assault and harassment. Victims are given access counselling and support services and medical resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Rainbow Serpent festival tackles sexual assault | url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/stage/rainbow-serpent-festival-tackles-sexual-assault-20161220-gtf5we.html | first=Hannah | last=Francis | work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] | date=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stages==
[[File:RainbowSerpentPerformer.jpg|thumb|right|120px| Performer at Rainbow Serpent Festival 2006]]

===Main Stage===
The Main Stage focuses on harder music such as [[Psytrance]]. Usually, the stage begins with an ambient act and progressively increases in energy throughout the night. The Main Stage runs for 20 hours, starting at 8:00 pm Saturday night, and finishes 4:00 pm Sunday afternoon.

===Market Stage===
The Market Stage plays a large variety of music ranging from [[ambient music]], [[glitch hop]], and [[tech house]] to [[psytrance]]. The Market Stage is the longest running stage at the festival, starting on the Friday night, and finishing early on Monday evening, it runs for about 72 hours continuously with no breaks except for one hour for the Main Stage opening ceremony. Many of the headliner acts actually play on the Market Stage, rather than on the Main Stage depending on their music style. The Monday afternoon on the Market Stage is widely regarded as one of the highlights of the festival, much like Saturday night on the Main Stage.

===Sunset Stage===
The Sunset Stage plays a variety of music throughout the festival, however, it closes for the 24-hour duration of the Main Stage opening. The Sunset Stage has more acts and genres than the Market Stage and the Main Stage provide.

===Chillout Stage===
The Chillout Stage runs throughout the festival.

===Playground Stage===
The Playground Stage, introduced to the festival in 2009, focuses on live performance music. The genres covered include dub, reggae, hip-hop, funk, folk, Balkan, electro-swing, cumbia and jazz. It also showcases non-musical performers ranging from magicians to comedians, mimes, and fire twirlers.

==Notable Acts==
2010 - [[Robert Babicz]], [[David Tipper]]

2011 - [[Shpongle]]. [[Alex Grey]] painted live on the Main Stage during Shpongle's performance.

2014 - [[The Orb]]

2015 - [[Pretty Lights]]

2017 - [[Hallucinogen (musician)|Hallucinogen]]

==Incidents of death and crime at the festival==
In 2012, Daniel Buccianti, a 34-year-old man, died due to a heroin overdose. According to [[Victoria Police]] the death was not suspicious.

The '''''Refah'' tragedy''' ({{lang-tr|Refah faciası}}) was a [[List of maritime disasters#During World War II|maritime disaster]] that took place during [[World War II]], in June 1941, when the cargo steamer ''Refah'' of neutral [[Turkey]], carrying Turkish military personnel from [[Mersin]] in Turkey to [[Port Said]], [[Egypt]], was sunk in eastern [[Mediterranean sea|Mediterranean]] waters by a torpedo fired from an unidentified [[Submarine|submarine.]] Of the 200 passengers and crew aboard, only 32 survived.

==Background==
Turkey remained [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral]] until the final year of [[World War II]], but due to its proximity to the fighting, it decided to mobilize a large army in case the country came under attack. In the early stages of the war, the Turkish government had already ordered four submarines, four destroyers,&lt;ref name="p"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.dho.edu.tr/pusula/yazilar/dnzsehit.html |journal=Pusula |title=Bahriyeli Şehitlerimiz |year=2006 |issue=56 |language=Turkish |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070111021117/http://www.dho.edu.tr/pusula/yazilar/dnzsehit.html |archivedate=11 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; twelve [[landing craft]] and aircraft for four [[flight (military unit)|flight]]s from the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="a"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arastiralim.com/savunma-tarihimizden-trajik-bir-olay.html |publisher=arastiralim.com |title=Savunma tarihimizden trajik bir olay |author=Solak, Cemil |date=4 December 2008 |language=Turkish |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101001032327/http://www.arastiralim.com/savunma-tarihimizden-trajik-bir-olay.html |archivedate=1 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dbm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dundenbugunemersin.blogspot.com/2007/09/tarih-3blm.html |publisher=Dünden Bugüne Mersin |title=Tarih (3. Bölüm)-Refah Faciası |language=Turkish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Delivery was delayed because of wartime difficulties. Nevertheless, the British decided to make the submarines and aircraft available, fearing a possible pro-German tendency among the Turkish statesmen.&lt;ref name="da"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://denizalticilarbirligi.com/db.refah.htm |publisher=Denizaltıccılar Birliği |title=Refah Faciası. 23-Haziran-1941 |language=Turkish }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was planned that both the delivery and the training of the military personnel would take place in England. The direct air route from Turkey to England would have meant travelling over [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]]-controlled Europe, so it was decided to go by sea to Egypt (under British control at the time), then to England by air. The British demanded that the Turkish mission should arrive by 25 June at the latest in [[Port Said]], to join a British convoy going home.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kg"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.kibrisgazetesi.com/print.php?news=41174 |newspaper=Kıbrıs Gazetesi |title=Kıbrıs açıklarında Refah Şilebi'ni torpilliyerek kimler batırdı? |date=12 May 2007 |language=Turkish |accessdate=14 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721144214/http://www.kibrisgazetesi.com/print.php?news=41174 |archivedate=21 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ship==
The Turkish government chartered the steamer ''Refah'', a cargo ship owned by the Berzilay &amp; Benjamen Company. She was built in 1901 at [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]], England, and sailed under the name ''Perseveranza'' until renamed ''Refah'' (literally: ''Prosperity'') in 1931 by the Turkish owner. The 3,805-ton vessel&lt;ref name="ch"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Jx9kAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=O3sNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5371,2891696&amp;dq=refah&amp;hl=en |newspaper=[[The Calgary Herald]] |title=Turkish Ship Torpedoed |date=26 June 1941 |accessdate=14 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oc2"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7vUuAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4dsFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6111,393929&amp;dq=refah&amp;hl=en |newspaper=[[Ottawa Citizen]] |title=Turkey Bars Her Ships From Using Black Sea |date=3 July 1941 |accessdate=14 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was {{convert|102.20|m|ft|abbr=on}} long with {{convert|14.80|m|ft|abbr=on}} beam and {{convert|7.00|m|ft|abbr=on}} draught, and {{convert|8.5|knot|0}} maximum speed. The ship departed from [[Istanbul]] on 16 June 1941 and arrived five days later in the southeastern Turkish port of [[Port of Mersin|Mersin]].&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;

[[Commander]] Zeki Işın, appointed leader of the mission, inspected the 40-year-old, coal cargo vessel and reported his findings to the authorities in [[Ankara]]: the ship had insufficient cabins, beds and toilets for the estimated 170 passengers she was expected to carry, and only two [[lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]]s were available, each for 24 people. He concluded that the cargo ship was not suitable for a journey of this kind across the Mediterranean Sea.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;

The ship underwent some minor modifications in great haste before the journey. She was fitted with additional toilets, cabins and beds brought from the naval school in Mersin. Turkish colours were painted on both sides of the steamer's [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] and also on the weather deck. In order to signal her identity as a neutral country's vessel even in the night, she was brightly lit.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dbm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="oc1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fQEvAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3dsFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3154,5270511&amp;dq=refah&amp;hl=en |newspaper=Ottawa Citizen |title=Neutral Turkish Vessel Was Sunk by Italian Sub |date=26 June 1941 |accessdate=14 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unexpected political developments==
On 18 June 1941, Nazi Germany and Turkey signed the [[German–Turkish Treaty of Friendship]] that followed an invitation by [[Adolf Hitler]] with his letter from 4 March 1941 to the Turkish president [[İsmet İnönü]]. Meanwhile, Nazi German troops had already invaded the entire [[Balkans]] and stood on Turkey's doorstep. While this pact angered the British government, Nazi Germany, its allies and [[Finland]] started an offensive ([[Operation Barbarossa]]) on 22 June against the [[Soviet Union]], relying on its secure southern front.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;

== Incident ==

The Turkish military mission came to 171 people, comprising 19 [[Turkish Navy]] officers, 72 [[petty officer]]s, 58 seamen, 20 [[Turkish Air Force Academy]] cadets and two civilians.&lt;ref name="dbm"/&gt; The ship had 28 crew members. A British [[liaison officer]] boarded the vessel immediately before her departure, who gave the ship's captain İzzet Dalgakıran the necessary route details.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Türkiye'nin 50 yılı'', Tempo yayınları, İstanbul, 1998. p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 June at 17:30 hours local time, the ''Refah'' weighed anchor, and sailed towards Port Said in eastern Mediterranean waters with a total of 200 people aboard.  Turkey was neutral so the voyage was considered safe and the steamer was not escorted by warships.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;

Around at 22:30 hours, while the passengers were eating their rations throughout the ship, an explosion occurred as the ship was about {{convert|10|nmi|km}} east off the coast of [[Cyprus]]. She was hit by a torpedo fired from an unidentified submarine. The vessel flooded and began to sink.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kg"/&gt;

According to the survivors, who later recounted the subsequent events, one of the lifeboats fell into the sea with people sleeping inside. The ship's electrical system went dead and her radio became disabled, so that no distress call could be transmitted. Some passengers fell and some jumped into the water. [[Lieutenant (naval)|Lt.]] Nevzat Erül came alongside the second lifeboat with a pistol in his hand and directed a rescue operation for 24 passengers. However, the lifeboat could not be launched because the [[davit]] did not operate. Meanwhile, some people already in the water climbed up the ship, as they did not expect her to sink immediately. People tried to dismount wooden toilet doors and hold covers for use as rafts. Muhittin Darga, one of the survivors, said in an interview given in 1983 that they waited aboard the sinking ship until 02:00 hours, and then jumped into the lifeboat; the ship was so low in the water at this point that the lifeboat was touching the surface. Around four hours after the explosion, the ship snapped in two pieces and went down.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="oc1"/&gt;

Darga added that the British officer wearing a lifejacket could not get into the lifeboat. He learned later that the British officer was missing. Most of the people who jumped into the sea drowned. The people in the lifeboat rescued three or four victims from the sea. They used a lifeboat's oar as a mast and a blanket as a sail. Although only {{convert|10|nmi|km}} away from Cyprus, a south wind drove them to the Turkish coast. Those clinging to the makeshift rafts were rescued by boats that came along, while others who left their rafts to swim away drowned. 28 people in the lifeboat landed after 20 hours on the Turkish coast near [[Karataş]] lighthouse.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;

Only then did the tragedy become known. Military aircraft and motorboats were immediately deployed to the scene. A search was conducted all day long. However, only four more survivors could be rescued. Of the 200 people aboard, the disaster claimed the lives of 168 people in total, while only 32 survived.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;

== Aftermath ==
Turkey had declared its neutrality in the war eleven times before, and no country claimed responsibility for the attack on the Turkish ship. Britain's ambassador to Turkey, Sir [[Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen]] stated that the attack was made by a Nazi German or [[Italian navy|Italian]] submarine&lt;ref name="oc1"/&gt; operating in the area. This allegation was denied by the Nazi German news agency, DNB. Another assertion that the ''Refah'' was sunk by a French warship, which mistook her for an Egyptian vessel, could not be verified because the passengers did not see any warship. Finally, the British were accused, either because they were not willing to deliver the military equipment ordered by Turkey, or to trigger Turkey's involvement in the war on the side of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dbm"/&gt;

According to Ret. [[Group Captain]] Haydar Gürsan, one of the survivors, the ship was torpedoed twice by a French submarine. French [[reconnaissance aircraft]] flew over the scene the next morning without reporting the incident to Turkish authorities. He added that a French officer told him in [[Beirut]] that the ship was sunk by the French, and this information was also recorded by military intelligence.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt; After reports about Mediterranean marine activities poured in, it became clear that the anonymous submarine belonged to [[Vichy France]]. In the summer of 1941, forces of [[Free France]] and Vichy France were fighting over [[Syria]]; one of Vichy France's submarines mistook ''Refah'' for a vessel of Free France.&lt;ref name="kg"/&gt; Later on, although not officially announced, it is believed that French government handed over two of her submarines to Turkey, as a compensation.&lt;ref name="da"/&gt;

However, recently disclosed documents from Italian and German archives support an alternative story. A report published by the Italian Navy gives coordinates where the [[Italia]]n submarine ''Ondina'' attacked vessels. The site of ''Refah''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s sinking matches this information.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;

==Political consequences and compensation==

After the disaster became generally known, discussions in the [[Turkish Grand National Assembly|Turkish parliament]] led to the opening of an investigation into the case. [[Ministry of Transport and Communication (Turkey)|Minister of Transport]] Cevdet Kerim İncedayı and [[Ministry of National Defence (Turkey)|Minister of National Defence]] [[List of Ministers of National Defence of Turkey|Saffet Arıkan]] resigned from the cabinet on 12 November 1941. The parliamentary investigation, concluded on 18 December found these ministers free of guilt. A further investigation found the responsible civil servants not guilty.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dbm"/&gt;

The Turkish government paid 4,000 [[Turkish lira]] (TL) in compensation to each legal inheritor of the people killed in the disaster, 800 TL to each naval officer, 400 TL to each petty officer and cadet, and 100 TL to each seaman who survived the incident.&lt;ref name="kg"/&gt;

==Commemoration==
In remembrance of the victims of the tragedy, a [[Mersin Martyrs' Memorial|monument]] was erected in the [[Atatürk Park]] of Mersin, which is situated next to the Port of Mersin.&lt;ref name="dbm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kg"/&gt;

The '''Santa María School massacre''' was a [[massacre]] of striking workers, mostly [[List of Saltpeter works in Tarapacá and Antofagasta|saltpeter works]] (nitrate) miners, along with wives and children, committed by the [[Chilean Army]] in [[Iquique]], [[Chile]] on December 21, 1907. The number of victims is undetermined but is reliably estimated at over 2,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.socialistparty.org.uk/articles/26626/13-12-2017/110-years-ago-massacre-at-santa-maria-school-in-chile-commemorate-21-december-1907|title=110 years ago: massacre at Santa Maria school in Chile - commemorate 21 December 1907|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It occurred during the peak of the nitrate mining era, which coincided with the [[History of Chile during the Parliamentary Era (1891-1925)|Parliamentary Period]] in Chilean political history (1891–1925). With the massacre and an ensuing reign of terror, not only was the strike broken, but the workers' movement was thrown into limbo for over a decade.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} For decades afterward there was official suppression of knowledge of the incident, but in 2007 the government conducted a highly publicized commemoration of its centenary, including an official national day of mourning and the reinterment of the victims' remains. 

The site of the massacre was the [[Domingo Santa María]] School,&lt;ref&gt;named after former Chilean president Santa María&lt;/ref&gt; where thousands of miners from different nitrate mines in Chile's far north had been camping for a week after converging on Iquique, the regional capital, to appeal for government intervention to improve their living and working conditions.  [[Rafael Sotomayor Gaete]], the minister of the interior, decided to crush the strike, by army assault if need be.&lt;ref&gt; The Alchemy of Air Thomas Hager, https://www.amazon.com/The-Alchemy-Air-Scientific-Discovery/dp/0307351793 &lt;/ref&gt; On December 21, 1907, the commander of the troops at the scene, General [[Roberto Silva Renard]], in accordance with this plan, informed the strikers' leaders that the strikers had one hour to disband or be fired upon. When the time was up and the leaders and the multitude stood firm, General Silva Renard gave his troops the order to fire. An initial volley that felled the negotiators was followed by a hail of rifle and machine gun fire aimed at the multitude of strikers and their accompanying wives and children.

==Historical background==
Chilean society faced a crisis from the late 19th century onwards: what was delicately referred to at the time as the "social question"&lt;ref&gt;"fenómenos que a partir de la década de 1880 fueron conocidos bajo el nombre de «cuestión social»" phenomena which from the 1880s on were known under the name of «social question»; Grez 1995, Presentación, opening sentence&lt;/ref&gt;—namely, "the problem of worsening living and working conditions in the country's mining centers and major cities"&lt;ref&gt;Barr-Melej 2001:3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collier and Sater 1996:164ff&lt;/ref&gt; The nitrate miners' strike of December 1907 was the last of a series of strikes and other forms of unrest that began in 1902, chief among them being the strike in Valparaíso in 1903 and the [[meat riots]] in Santiago in 1905.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Correa et al. 2001&lt;/ref&gt; In Chile, the workers' movement in general, and [[syndicalism]] in particular, got started among the nitrate miners.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} 

Geographically, the region Chileans today have come to refer to as the [[Norte Grande, Chile|Norte Grande]] (Big North) lies within the [[Atacama Desert]], the driest region on Earth. The Norte Grande and the Norte Chico immediately to the south belong to the Chilean ''pampa'', a vast plain located between the Pacific Ocean and the western foothills of the [[Andes]] mountains. The Norte Grande, which administratively consisted (before 1974) of the two Provinces of [[Tarapacá Region|Tarapacá]] and [[Antofagasta Region|Antofagasta]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Regions of Chile]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Under the administrative structure of Chile as of 2007, the Norte Grande includes what are now termed the Regions of Tarapacá, Antofagasta, and [[Arica and Parinacota]]. The latter region was created in 2007 by subdividing the Tarapacá Region.&lt;/ref&gt; had been seized by Chile from Bolivia and Peru in the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879–1884), giving Chile an area rich in minerals, principally copper and [[Sodium nitrate|saltpeter (sodium nitrate)]]. Tensions provoked by the control of the mines had been one of the leading causes of the [[1891 Chilean Civil War]], when pro-Congress forces triumphed.

The mining of nitrate had become the mainstay of the nation's economy at the end of the 19th century, Chile being the exclusive producer worldwide.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} According to the census of November 28, 1907, Tarapacá Province held 110,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;Zolezzi 1999&lt;/ref&gt; In the provinces of Tarapacá and Antofagasta about 40,000 workers were active in the nitrate industry, of whom about 13,000 came from Bolivia and Peru.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; 

Life in the mining camps—a nitrate works was known locally as an [[:es:Oficina salitrera|''oficina'', "office"]], a term whose use extended to the adjoining settlement—was grueling and physically dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;Collier and Sater 1996:163&lt;/ref&gt; The enterprises exercised a severe control over the life and working conditions inside the mines, which rendered the workers extremely vulnerable to arbitrary actions perpetrated by the owners. Each ''oficina'' was a [[company town]] in which the mine owner owned the workers' housing, owned the [[company store]] (known in Chile as a [[:es:Pulpería|''pulpería'']]), monopolized all commerce, and employed a private police force. Each mining camp ran its own money system, paying its workers in tokens, which could be spent only within the mining camp. Mine managers frequently put off paydays for up to three months.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

At the beginning of the 20th century, the above mentioned "social question" prompted unrest among the workers at the nitrate ''oficinas'' in the Tarapacá Province. They began to mobilize politically, repeatedly petitioning the national government in Santiago to get involved and bring about improvements in their dreadful living and working conditions. The [[History of Chile during the Parliamentary Era (1891-1925)|Parliamentary Period]] governments, however, were reluctant to intervene in negotiations between employers and workers, and they tended to see large scale workers' movements (especially if accompanied by massive demonstrations) as incipient rebellions.&lt;ref&gt;Collier and Sater 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

== The 18 Pence Strike and the massacre ==
On December 10, 1907, a [[general strike]] broke out in Tarapacá Province. This was the start of the 18 Pence Strike (''la huelga de los 18 peniques''), the name referring to the size of the wage the being demanded by workers in one particular mining occupation, workers known as ''jornaleros''. A large contingent of strikers traveled to the provincial capital, the port city of [[Iquique]], carrying the flags of [[Chile]], [[Peru]], [[Bolivia]], and [[Argentina]]. They camped at the horse racing track.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Zolezzi 1&lt;/ref&gt; As workers from other nitrate works swelled the ranks of this movement, nearly all commerce and industry in the north of the country was brought to a halt. The demands published by the strikers on December 16 in a memorial were as follows:

{{quote|*While the tokens are being abolished and pay is starting to be given in legal tender, each ''oficina'', its Manager representing it and pledging compliance, shall agree to accept tokens from every other ''oficina'' on a par with its own, paying a fine of 50,000 pesos for every refusal to do so.}}
{{quote|*A day's work to be paid at a fixed wage of 18 pence. Broad and absolute freedom of commerce at the nitrate works.}}
{{quote|*General covering with iron grates of all ore cooking vats (''cachuchos'') and settling vats (''chulladores'')&lt;ref&gt;For definitions of these mining terms, see the Web site, Pioneros del Salitre (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; in the nitrate works, on pain of an indemnity of from 5,000 to 10,000 pesos to each worker who is injured as a result of noncompliance with this provision.}}
{{quote|*At each nitrate works there shall be a balance and a bar placed outdoors alongside the company store to compare weights and measures.}}
{{quote|*Venues will be provided free of charge for holding night schools for workers, at their request.}}
{{quote|*The Supervisor may not load confiscated [sic] ore into the ore cooking vats.&lt;ref&gt;Miners hand-sorted crushed ore Collier and Sater 1996:162&lt;/ref&gt; (Editorial Note: the point of this demand was that mine managers were in the practice of cheating the workers by refining the discarded low quality pieces of crushed ore, and getting some little yield from them, without paying the workers corresponding piece rates.){{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} }}
{{quote|*Neither the Supervisor nor any works employee shall dismiss workers or their leaders who have taken part in the present movement without advance notice of between two and three months, or alternatively an indemnity between 300 and 500 pesos.}}
{{quote|*In the future, a 15-day advance notice will be obligatory for workers and bosses in the event of a contract termination.}}
{{quote|*Upon acceptance of these terms, they will be put into writing and signed by the managements and by the workers' designated representatives.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;}}

On December 16, thousands of striking workers from other industries arrived at Iquique in support of the nitrate miners' demands upon the provincial authorities, with the aim of prodding the authorities to act. Previous entreaties to the government, in particular petitions presented by delegations in 1901, 1903, and 1904, had been fruitless.

The national government in Santiago sent extra regiments by land and sea to reinforce the two regiments stationed in Iquique. President [[Pedro Montt]] appointed General [[Roberto Silva Renard]] to handle the situation. Silva Renard, under confidential orders from the minister of the interior, [[Rafael Sotomayor Gaete|Rafael Sotomayor]], was ordered to use all necessary means to force the miners to dissolve and return to work. 

More and more worker contingents joined the strike by the day. It has been estimated that by December 21 the strikers in Iquique numbered ten to twelve thousand. Soon after the journeys to Iquique began, this great conglomeration of workers met in Manuel Montt plaza and at the Santa María School, asking the government mediate between them and the bosses of the foreign (English) nitrate firms to resolve their demands. For their part, the bosses refused to negotiate until the workers went back to work. 

The acting [[intendant]] of Tarapacá Province, [[Julio Guzmán García]], mediated negotiations with representatives of the ''pampinos'' (plains dwellers) until the arrival at the port December 19 of the titular intendant, [[Carlos Eastman Quiroga]], and General [[Roberto Silva Renard]], chief of the First Military Zone of the Chilean Army, accompanied by Colonel [[Sinforoso Ledesma]]. Their arrival was cheered by the workers because a nitrate miners' petition to the government nearly two years earlier, under the previous president, had received an encouraging response, although the demands had not been satisfied.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Devés&lt;/ref&gt; But the interior ministry felt no solidarity with the demands of the strikers. The ministry relayed orders to the strikers to leave the plaza and the school and gather at the horse racing track, where they were to board trains and return to work. They refused, sensing that if they went back to work, their requests would be ignored. 

In the face of the growing tension between the groups, on December 20, 1907 the strikers' representatives held a meeting with Intendant Eastman. Simultaneously, a decree published in the press announced the declaration of a state of siege, which entailed the suspension of constitutional rights. While the meeting with Intendant Eastman was taking place in the Buenaventura nitrate works, a group of workers and their families tried to leave the spot, but troops opened fire on them by the railroad tracks and kept shooting. As a result, six workers died and the rest of the group was wounded.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

The funerals of the slain workers were held the next day, December 21, 1907. Immediately at their conclusion, all workers were ordered to leave the school premises and vicinity and relocate to the Club Hípico (Horse Club). The workers refused to go, fearing they might be bombarded by the guns of warships which were lined up alongside the road they would have to travel. 
[[File:SantaMaríadeIquique.JPG|thumb|right|220px|General Roberto Silva Renard's account of the massacre. ''Collection of the [[Archivo Nacional de Chile]]''.]]
At 2:30 in the afternoon, General Silva Renard told the leaders of the workers' committee that if the strikers did not start heading back to work within one hour, the troops would open fire on them. The workers' leaders refused to go, and only a small group of strikers left the plaza. 

At the hour indicated by Silva Renard, he ordered the soldiers to shoot the workers' leaders, who were on the school's roof, and they fell dead with the first volley. The multitude, desperate and trying to escape, surged toward the soldiers, and were fired upon with rifles and machine guns. After a period of firing from the Manuel Montt plaza, the troops stormed school grounds with machine guns, firing into the school's playgrounds and classrooms, killing in a frenzy without regard to the women and children screaming for mercy. The survivors of the massacre were brought at saber point to the Club Hípico, whence they were sent back to work and subjected to a reign of terror.

==Victims==
The government ordered that death certificates not be issued for the fallen and had them buried in a mass grave in the city cemetery. The remains were not exhumed until 1940. They were reinterred in the courtyard of the Legal Medical Service of that city. 

The number of victims claimed by the action is disputed.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; On one hand, the official report of General Silva Renard speaks at first of 140 dead, later to rise to 195. This is the number offered by a witness to the massacre, [[Nicolás Palacios]], a physician in the mines and a political dissident of national renown. However, this figure is considered unrealistic given the number of workers present. The highest estimate has been 3,600, although this is considered speculative. The most widely accepted figure is around 2,200.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deves&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
General Silva Renard reported to the government in Santiago as to what happened, minimizing his role and laying responsibility on the strikers. The National Congress's reaction was lukewarm. 

Improvements in the conditions of the workers came slowly. It would not be until 1920 that minimum labor standards started to be enacted, such as mandating payment in legal tender and setting the maximum length of the working day. General Silva Renard was seriously wounded in 1914 in an assassination attempt on the part of a Spanish anarchist, [[Antonio Ramón]], whose brother, Manuel Vaca, had been one of the victims of the massacre.

==100th anniversary observances==
On the occasion of the centenary of the massacre, the government of president Michelle Bachelet ordered the reexhumation of the remains and their interment in a special monument erected at the scene of the deed.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;tercera&lt;/ref&gt; Public exhibits were mounted. President Bachelet decreed a national day of mourning for December 21, 2007.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;terra&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;dibam&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural influence==
The facts of the massacre were suppressed by the government for many years. With the passage of time, its tragic details inspired singers and poets, while its social effects were investigated from the middle of the 20th century on. Chief among these artistic and academic works are:

[[Image:EdwardICrusadeMap.jpg|thumb|[[Baibars]]'s siege of Bohemond VI in Tripoli was lifted in May 1271 when [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] arrived in the Levant, starting the [[Ninth Crusade]].]]
The '''1271 Siege of Tripoli''' was initiated by the [[Mamluk]] ruler [[Baibars]] against the Frankish ruler of the [[Principality of Antioch]] and  the [[County of Tripoli]], [[Bohemond VI of Antioch|Bohemond VI]].  It followed the dramatic [[Siege of Antioch (1268)|Fall of Antioch]] in 1268, and was an attempt by the Mamluks to completely destroy the [[Crusader state]]s of Antioch and Tripoli.

{{Campaignbox Crusades Battles}}

==Background==
In the mid-13th century, the [[Crusades|Crusaders]] had been steadily losing ground, and were being squeezed between the advancing troops of the Egyptian Mamluks from the south, and the advancing [[Mongol Empire]] from the east, with insufficient assistance arriving from Europe in the West. Around 1260, Bohemond VI, under the influence of his father-in-law, King [[Hethum I of Armenia]], had submitted Antioch and Tripoli to the [[Mongol Empire]], making them vassal states which contributed troops to the Mongol forces, in their battles against the Muslims.  The Mongols made dramatic victories in Persia and Syria, effectively destroying the [[Abbasid]] and [[Ayyubid]] Caliphates, and causing a shift of Islamic power to the Egyptian Mamluks in [[Cairo]].  However, before the Mongols could continue their advance southwards through Palestine towards Egypt, a succession crisis resulted in the withdrawal of the majority of their troops, as the Mongol princes convened on [[Karakorum]] to decide on a new Great Khan. A smaller force was left to occupy Syria and engage in raids through Palestine, but the Crusaders and the Mamluks engaged in a truce, which allowed the Mamluks to advance northwards through Crusader territory, and engage the weakened Mongol force at the [[Battle of Ayn Jalut]] in 1260.  When the bulk of the Mongol forces returned in 1262, they were never able to avenge the loss.  Meanwhile, the Mamluks proceeded to reclaim the rest of the Levant from Crusader hands.  Jerusalem had been taken in 1244 by the [[Khwarezm Turks]], and the Egyptian Mamluks worked their way northward, capturing castle after castle.

In 1268, the Egyptian Mamluks [[Siege of Antioch (1268)|besieged and captured Antioch]], leaving Bohemond with only Tripoli.  Baibars next turned his sights on Tripoli, and sent a letter to Bohemond threatening him with total annihilation, and taunting him for his alliance with the [[Mongol]] ruler [[Abaqa]]:

{{quote|Our yellow flags have repelled your red flags, and the sound of the bells has been replaced by the call: "Allâh Akbar!" (...) Warn your walls and your churches that soon our siege machinery will deal with them, your knights that soon our swords will invite themselves in their homes (...) We will see then what use will be your alliance with [[Abaqa Khan|Abagha]]|Letter from Baibars to Bohemond VI, 1271&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Grousset, p.650&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bohemond begged for a truce, so as not to lose Tripoli as well. Baibar mocked him for lack of courage, and asked him to pay all the expenses of the Mamluk campaign. Bohemond had enough pride left to refuse the offer. By this time, the Mamluks had captured every inland castle of the Franks, but the Mamluks had heard reports about the arrival of the [[Ninth Crusade]], led by the prince who would later be [[Edward I of England]]. Edward had landed in [[Akko|Acre]] on May 9, 1271, where he was soon joined by Bohemond and his cousin King [[Hugh III of Cyprus|Hugh]] of Cyprus and Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;
''Mongols and Mamluks'', p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

Baibars therefore accepted Bohemond's offer of a truce in May, abandoned the siege of Tripoli, and instead concentrated his forces in [[Damascus|Damas]], in anticipation of future battles.  Edward made an attempt to coordinate his own actions with the Mongols, but was not successful since the Mongols were busy with internal conflicts, and Edward's own forces were very small and fairly ineffective.  He therefore opted to negotiate his own truce with the Mamluks, before returning to England.

==Aftermath==
The next major offensive against Tripoli was in 1289 by the Mamluk Sultan [[Qalawun]], who successfully orchestrated the [[Fall of Tripoli (1289)|Fall of Tripoli]] and destruction of the Crusader State.  He then made plans to capture the last major Crusader stronghold, [[Acre, Israel|Saint-Jean d'Acre]], but died in 1290.  The [[Fall of Acre]] was achieved in 1291 by Qalawun's son, [[Al-Ashraf Khalil]].

"'''So. Central Rain (I'm Sorry)'''" is a song by the American [[alternative rock]] band [[R.E.M.]] It was released in May 1984 as the first single from the group's second studio album ''[[Reckoning (R.E.M. album)|Reckoning]]''. "So. Central Rain (I'm Sorry)" became the second R.E.M. single to chart on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], peaking at number 85.

R.E.M. performed a rough version of the song on the NBC television show ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' on October 6, 1983—before the song even had a title—in what was the band's first U.S. network television appearance.

==Music video==
The video, directed by Howard Libov, was filmed at the Reflection Studio in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] during the recording of ''Reckoning'' there, and first aired in June 1984. It featured the members of the band playing their instruments behind white screens ([[Gobo (recording)|gobos]]) in an otherwise empty room, with [[Michael Stipe]] singing in the foreground. Stipe refused to [[lip sync]] to the song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mixonline.com/recording/classic-tracks-rems-so-central-rain-366064 |title=Classic Tracks: R.E.M.'s "So.

The history of '''Thracian warfare''' spans from the 10th century BC up to the 1st century AD in the region defined by Ancient [[Ancient Greeks|Greek]] and Latin historians as [[Thrace]]. It concerns the armed conflicts of the [[Thracian]] tribes and their kingdoms in the Balkans. Apart from conflicts between [[Thracians]] and neighboring nations and tribes, numerous wars were recorded among Thracian tribes.

==Mythological==
{{Expand section|date=September 2009}}
Instances of Thracian people engaging in armed conflict occur in the [[Iliad]] of [[Homer]] and in [[Greek mythology]]. The [[Ancient Greeks|Greek]] [[Temenids]] ousted the Thracians from [[Pieria (prefecture)|Pieria]] (later central [[Macedon]]ia).&lt;ref name="Angus McBride 2001, page 4"&gt;The Thracians 700 BC-AD 46 (Men-at-Arms) by Christopher Webber and Angus McBride, 2001, {{ISBN|1-84176-329-2}}, page 4&lt;/ref&gt; The Thracians, prominent warriors who became allies of [[Troy]], came from the Aegean coast.&lt;ref&gt;The Odrysian Kingdom of Thrace: Orpheus Unmasked (Oxford Monographs on Classical Archaeology) by Z. H. Archibald, 1998, {{ISBN|0-19-815047-4}}, page 94&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Odyssey]] there is only one instance of Thracians, that of [[Cicones]] again on the coast, but they are weak.&lt;ref&gt;The Odrysian Kingdom of Thrace: Orpheus Unmasked (Oxford Monographs on Classical Archaeology) by Z. H. Archibald, 1998, {{ISBN|0-19-815047-4}}, page 93&lt;/ref&gt;

The Thracians were a particularly fierce culture in terms of violence and conflict and so they appeared in [[Greek Mythology]] as mostly associated with its stories of strife. The god of war [[Ares]] was said to have been born in Thrace and was also heavily worshiped there; in contrast to the revulsion of his worship by many other Balkan city states. Homer recounts in the book of Odyssey that an embarrassed Ares retreated among his Thracian followers when his love affair with the goddess [[Aphrodite]] was caught and the two were promptly ensnared by [[Hephaestus]].

==Tribal wars==
Thracian tribes fought amongst each other and they allied themselves with the [[Ancient Greeks|Greek]]s against other Thracian tribes. Those allied with the Greeks were more civilized and they were usually established in settlements along the Thracian coast.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Manual of Ancient Geography|last=Schmitz|first=Leonhard|publisher=Blanchard and Lea|year=1857|isbn=|location=Edinburgh|pages=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interior tribes were known as savages, retaining their barbarous habits even until the Roman period.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Classical Dictionary of Biography, Mythology and Geography: Based on the Larger Dictionaries|last=Smith|first=William|publisher=John Murray|year=1891|isbn=|location=London|pages=771}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the constant conflict, these tribes have been easily conquered by the Egyptian Sesostris, the Teucrians, Mysians, and, finally the Persians under [[Darius I|Darius Hystaspis]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The tribal wars also kept Thrace from becoming a major regional power due to the lack of a central government.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Philip II of Macedonia: Greater Than Alexander|last=Gabriel|first=Richard|publisher=Potomac Books|year=2010|isbn=9781597975193|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the onset of the [[Peloponnesian War]], the Thracian tribes were united under the rule of Sitalces, king of the Odrysae.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It was allied with Athens during the conflict. However, the kingdom was again split into different parts after the death of king Seuthes. It was during this time when [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip of Macedon]] conquered a large swath of Thrace, absorbing the territory and its tribes into Macedon.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The ''Odrysian kingdom'' ([[Ancient Greek]], "Βασιλεία Όδρυσων") was a union of [[Thracians|Thracian]] tribes that endured between the 5th century BC and the 3rd century BC. The Odrysian state was the first Thracian kingdom that acquired power in the region, by the unification&lt;ref&gt;Readings in Greek History: Sources and Interpretations by D. Brendan Nagle and Stanley M. Burstein, {{ISBN|0-19-517825-4}}, 2006, page 230: "... , however, one of the Thracian tribes, the Odrysians, succeeded in unifying the Thracians and creating a powerful state ..."&lt;/ref&gt; of many [[List of Thracian tribes|Thracian tribes]] under a single ruler, King [[Teres I|Teres]]&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Classical Dictionary by Simon Hornblower and Antony Spawforth, {{ISBN|0-19-860641-9}}, page 1515, "Shortly afterwards the first King of the Odrysae, Teres attempted to carve an empire out of the territory occupied by the Thracian tribes (Thuc.2.29) and his sovereignty extended as far as the Euxine and the Hellespont)"&lt;/ref&gt; 5th century BC. It became involved in wars and military conflicts against the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Ancient Greeks|Greek]] colonies, the kingdom of [[Macedon]] and the [[Diadochi]], the [[Persian Empire]], [[Paeonians]], [[Dacians]], [[Celts]],&lt;ref name="Theodossiev"&gt;Nikola Theodossiev, [http://www.caorc.org/fellowships/mellon/pubs/Theodossiev.pdf "Celtic Settlement in North-Western Thrace during the Late Fourth and Third Centuries BC"].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scythians]] and [[Thracian]] tribes. Sometimes it was allied with various [[Ancient Greek tribes]] or Greek [[city states]]. During the [[Peloponnesian]] war, Thracians were the allies of [[Athens]].&lt;ref name="Angus McBride 2001, page 5"&gt;The Thracians 700 BC-AD 46 (Men-at-Arms) by Christopher Webber and Angus McBride, 2001, {{ISBN|1-84176-329-2}}, page 5&lt;/ref&gt; The Thracians fought alongside [[Athenians]] and [[Macedon]]ians against the forces of the [[Sparta]]ns. [[Ancient Greeks|Greek]] generals like [[Iphicrates]]&lt;ref name="Angus McBride 2001, page 9"&gt;The Thracians 700 BC-AD 46 (Men-at-Arms) by Christopher Webber and Angus McBride, 2001, {{ISBN|1-84176-329-2}},page 9&lt;/ref&gt; and Charidemos fought for the Odrysae as well. The Thracians served under [[Scythian]] kings in 310 BC.&lt;ref name="Angus McBride 2001, page 12"&gt;The Thracians 700 BC-AD 46 (Men-at-Arms) by Christopher Webber and Angus McBride, 2001, {{ISBN|1-84176-329-2}},page 12&lt;/ref&gt; Odrysian military strength was based on intra-tribal elite&lt;ref name="Thrace 1998, page 149"&gt;The Odrysian Kingdom of Thrace: Orpheus Unmasked (Oxford Monographs on Classical Archaeology) by Z. H. Archibald,1998, {{ISBN|0-19-815047-4}}, page 149&lt;/ref&gt; making the kingdom prone to fragmentation.  Although the kingdom was wealthy, a large proportion of its income was in kind and suitable portions had to be paid to the tribal chiefs. The army was mostly fed and paid by plunder. Sitalces was able to raise an army supposedly 150,000 strong for his invasion of Macedonia in 429 BC but these economic and political factors (plus the onset of winter) meant that this army only held together for about six weeks and any Thracian conquests were ephemeral.

The [[Sapaeans]] ruled Thrace after the Odrysians until its incorporation to the Roman Empire as a province. Thrace became a [[Client state]] of Rome at 11 BC and was annexed at 46 AD.

==Thracian troop types and organization==
{{Expand section|date=September 2009}}

===Infantry and Cavalry===
Thrace had the potential to muster a huge number of troops&lt;ref name="Angus McBride 2001, page 3"&gt;The Thracians 700 BC-AD 46 (Men-at-Arms) by Christopher Webber and Angus McBride, 2001, {{ISBN|1-84176-329-2}}, page 3&lt;/ref&gt; though this  rarely occurred. By tradition, Thracians honored warriors and, according to [[Herodotus]], despised all other occupations.&lt;ref name="Angus McBride 2001, page 3"/&gt;
The [[Thracians]] fought as [[peltast]]s using [[javelins]] and crescent&lt;ref&gt;The Odrysian Kingdom of Thrace: Orpheus Unmasked (Oxford Monographs on Classical Archaeology) by Z. H. Archibald, 1998, {{ISBN|0-19-815047-4}}, page 203&lt;/ref&gt; or round wicker shields called ''peltes''. Missile weapons were favored but close combat weaponry was carried by the Thracians as well. These close combat weapons varied from the dreaded [[rhomphaia]]&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Webber, Angus McBride (2001). The Thracians, 700 BC - AD 46. Osprey Publishing. {{ISBN|1-84176-329-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Club (weapon)|clubs]] (used to knock the heads off the spears in Xenophon's [[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]] by [[Thynians]]), one- and two-sided axes, bows, knives, [[spear]]s, [[akinakes]] and long swords. Thracians shunned armor and greaves and fought as light as possible, favoring mobility above all other traits and had excellent horsemen.&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume 3, Part 2: The Assyrian and Babylonian Empires and Other States of the Near East, from the Eighth to the Sixth Centuries BC (Hardcover)

H. Archibald, {{ISBN|0-19-815047-4}}, 1998, page 203,""&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Bithyni]]an Thracians had contributed a number of 6,000 men (60,000 according to Herodotus) in [[Xerxes I of Persia]] campaign of 480 BC but in general resisted Persian occupation and turned against [[Mardonius (general)|Mardonius]]'s army as he retreated.&lt;ref name="Angus McBride 2001, page 4"/&gt; The [[Triballi]] frequently used [[Scythian]] and [[Celt]]ic equipment.&lt;ref name="Angus McBride 2001, page 6"&gt;The Thracians 700 BC-AD 46 (Men-at-Arms) by Christopher Webber and Angus McBride, 2001, {{ISBN|1-84176-329-2}}, page 6&lt;/ref&gt; Thracians&lt;ref&gt;The Illyrians (The Peoples of Europe) by John Wilkes,1996,page 198,"their armor is Celtic but they are tattooed like the rest of the Illyrians and Thracians"&lt;/ref&gt; decorated their bodies with tattoos like the [[Illyrians]] and the [[Dacians]].&lt;ref&gt;The World of Tattoo: An Illustrated History by Maarten Hesselt van Dinter, 2007, page 25: "... in ancient times. The Danube area Dacians, Thracians and Illyrians all decorated themselves with status-enhancing tattoos, ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Archaic====
A Thracian javelinman would wield a crescent wicker shield and a couple of javelins.&lt;ref&gt;The Thracians 700 BC-AD 46 (Men-at-Arms) by Christopher Webber and Angus McBride, 2001, {{ISBN|1-84176-329-2}}, page 42&lt;/ref&gt; This troop type was to persist into the classic and Hellenistic era. Organized groups of spearmen or javelin throwers were not used.&lt;ref&gt;The Odrysian Kingdom of Thrace: Orpheus Unmasked (Oxford Monographs on Classical Archaeology) by Z. H. Archibald, 1998, {{ISBN|0-19-815047-4}}, page 202&lt;/ref&gt;

====Classical====
[[File:Sofia - Unique Tracian Helmet from Bronze and Silver.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Phrygian or Thracian type helmet. Unusual having a nasal in place of the usual peak.]]

In the 4th century BC, both infantry and cavalry troops started wearing helmets&lt;ref name="Angus McBride 2001, page 20"&gt;The Thracians 700 BC-AD 46 (Men-at-Arms) by Christopher Webber and Angus McBride, 2001, {{ISBN|1-84176-329-2}}, page 20&lt;/ref&gt; (some of leather)&lt;ref name="Thrace 1998, page 199"&gt;The Odrysian Kingdom of Thrace: Orpheus Unmasked (Oxford Monographs on Classical Archaeology) by Z.

Principal weapons in the 4th century BC (as well as earlier) were the spear and short knife.&lt;ref&gt;The Odrysian Kingdom of Thrace: Orpheus Unmasked (Oxford Monographs on Classical Archaeology) by Z. H. Archibald, 1998, {{ISBN|0-19-815047-4}}, page 257&lt;/ref&gt;

Armor, when it was available (for the nobility), was at first [[leather]] or [[bronze]] but [[iron]] armour started appearing in the 4th century BC.&lt;ref name="Angus McBride 2001, page 21"&gt;The Thracians 700 BC-AD 46 (Men-at-Arms) by Christopher Webber and Angus McBride, 2001, {{ISBN|1-84176-329-2}}, page 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Thracian cavalry would wear leather armor&lt;ref name="Angus McBride 2001, page 5"/&gt; or no armor and would be armed with javelins,&lt;ref&gt;The Thracians 700 BC-AD 46 (Men-at-Arms) by Christopher Webber and Angus McBride, 2001, {{ISBN|1-84176-329-2}}, page 35&lt;/ref&gt; a bow, or a spear.&lt;ref&gt;The Odrysian Kingdom of Thrace: Orpheus Unmasked (Oxford Monographs on Classical Archaeology) by Z. H. Archibald,1998, {{ISBN|0-19-815047-4}}, page 204&lt;/ref&gt; Only royal cavalry would wear armor.&lt;ref name="Angus McBride 2001, page 22"&gt;The Thracians 700 BC-AD 46 (Men-at-Arms) by Christopher Webber and Angus McBride, 2001, {{ISBN|1-84176-329-2}}, page 22&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oval]] shields and [[peltes]] (even by heavy cavalry) were later used. Thracian cavalry was numerous.&lt;ref&gt;The Odrysian Kingdom of Thrace: Orpheus Unmasked (Oxford Monographs on Classical Archaeology) by Z. H. Archibald, 1998, {{ISBN|0-19-815047-4}}, page 205&lt;/ref&gt; It was also legendary for its combat power so that Philip of Macedon adopted its wedge-shaped formation for the Macedonian cavalry maneuvers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The helmet type used mostly was the [[Chalcidian type helmet]]&lt;ref name="Thrace 1998, page 201"&gt;The Odrysian Kingdom of Thrace: Orpheus Unmasked (Oxford Monographs on Classical Archaeology) by Z. H. Archibald, 1998, {{ISBN|0-19-815047-4}}, page 201&lt;/ref&gt; (over 60 have been found) and, to a much lesser extent, the [[Corinthian type helmet]] (one has been found), [[Phrygian type helmet]],&lt;ref&gt;The Odrysian Kingdom of Thrace: Orpheus Unmasked (Oxford Monographs on Classical Archaeology) by Z. H. Archibald, 1998, {{ISBN|0-19-815047-4}}, page 254&lt;/ref&gt; [[Attic type helmet]] and [[Scythian type helmet]] (an open face helmet) with many hybrid types occurring.&lt;ref name="Angus McBride 2001, page 20"/&gt; No [[Illyrian type helmet]] has been found in the east Balkans.&lt;ref name="Thrace 1998, page 201"/&gt;

==== Hellenistic ====
A Thracian footman (3rd century BC - 1st century BC) could wield a knife or sword, [[Rhomphaia]], a helmet, two javelins and a light [[oval]] wooden shield (or a heavier iron-rimmed and spined thureos).&lt;ref&gt;The Thracians 700 BC-AD 46 (Men-at-Arms) by Christopher Webber and Angus McBride, 2001, {{ISBN|1-84176-329-2}}, page 16&lt;/ref&gt; No Thracian infantry wore greaves until the 4th century BC.&lt;ref name="Angus McBride 2001, page 22"/&gt; Later native and [[Ancient Greeks|Greek]] types started being used, the Greek type being rarer.&lt;ref name="Angus McBride 2001, page 22"/&gt; Thracians used mixed Thracian and [[Ancient Greeks|Greek]] equipment and armors from different time periods, to the point of wearing armors that ceased to be used elsewhere; this is something they did even in the classic era.&lt;ref name="Angus McBride 2001, page 20"/&gt; Later they adopted Roman armaments.&lt;ref name="Angus McBride 2001, page 20"/&gt;

===Thracian mercenaries===
Thracians were highly&lt;ref&gt;The Illyrians (The Peoples of Europe) by John Wilkes, 1996, {{ISBN|978-0-631-19807-9}}, page 168, "Like Thracians to the east the Illyrians were an important source of military manpower, and often served as separate contingents under their own leaders"&lt;/ref&gt; sought as mercenaries due to their ferocity in battle,&lt;ref name="Angus McBride 2001, page 3"/&gt; but they were infamous for their love of plunder.&lt;ref name="Angus McBride 2001, page 3"/&gt; Thracian mercenaries played an important&lt;ref name="Angus McBride 2001, page 6"/&gt; role in the affairs between [[Athenians]] and [[Sparta]]ns. The [[Odomantii]] were described as expensive mercenaries.&lt;ref name="Angus McBride 2001, page 7"/&gt; In one instance in 413 BC, [[Dii]] mercenaries were so expensive to pay that after they missed the boat to Sicily the [[Athenians]] sent them home.&lt;ref name="Angus McBride 2001, page 7"/&gt; They were hired occasionally by Persians.&lt;ref name="Angus McBride 2001, page 8"&gt;The Thracians 700 BC-AD 46 (Men-at-Arms) by Christopher Webber and Angus McBride, 2001, {{ISBN|1-84176-329-2}}, page 8&lt;/ref&gt; [[Croesus]] had hired many Thracian swordsmen for the [[Lydia]]n army.&lt;ref&gt;The Thracians 700 BC-AD 46 (Men-at-Arms) by Christopher Webber and Angus McBride, 2001, {{ISBN|1-84176-329-2}}, page 33&lt;/ref&gt;  They also served in the Republican Roman and Mithridatic armies, as well as the armies of the Diadocii.  They provided up to one third of the cavalry in Macedonian armies and up to a fifth of their infantry (usually as levies or allies rather than mercenaries).  They later formed one of the most important nationalities in the Roman army, contributing up to 20,000 troops at any one time to auxiliary units during the early empire.

===Nobility===
A Thracian chieftain could have access to armor and helmets. One could be equipped with a [[Chalcidian type helmet]],&lt;ref name="Angus McBride 2001, page 7"/&gt;  a breastplate (this sort of armor is rarely found outside [[Crete]]&lt;ref&gt;The Thracians 700 BC-AD 46 (Men-at-Arms) by Christopher Webber and Angus McBride, 2001, {{ISBN|1-84176-329-2}}, page 34&lt;/ref&gt; and only one has been found in Thrace, a bell-type&lt;ref&gt;The Odrysian Kingdom of Thrace: Orpheus Unmasked (Oxford Monographs on Classical Archaeology) by Z.

H. Archibald, 1998, {{ISBN|0-19-815047-4}}, page 198&lt;/ref&gt;) a [[wicker]] [[pelte]], two javelins and a sword. Body armor was restricted to nobles and army commanders.&lt;ref name="Angus McBride 2001, page 21"/&gt; [[Ancient Greeks|Greek]] armor was in use in Thrace before the [[classical age]].&lt;ref name="Angus McBride 2001, page 21"/&gt; Nobles would sometimes wear pectorals on their chests as a sign of rank.&lt;ref name="Thrace 1998, page 199"/&gt;
{{Expand section|date=September 2009}}

===Navy===
There was no Thracian navy but there were instances of Thracians turning to piracy.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} The Greek cities of the coast that paid tribute to the Thracian kings did sometimes provide the Thracian kings with ships.

==Fortifications==

Thracian villages had basic fortifications as [[Xenophon]] witnesses in [[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]. [[Tacitus]] in his Annals describes a Roman attack against a hill fort. There were many Thracian hill forts and some were inhabited.  Other fortified Thracian towns existed at places like Hellis and Kabyle.

Odrysian Thracian kings made treaties and royal marriages as equals with the Scythians.  The royal name Spartokos (Spartacus) is shared between some Thracian royalty and some Crimean Skythian kings.

===Celtic===
Thracian warfare was affected by [[Celts]]&lt;ref name="Angus McBride 2001, page 6"/&gt; in a variety of ways like the adoption of certain long swords though this must not have been universal among them. The [[Triballi]] had adopted Celtic equipment. Another weapon, the [[sica]] was called ''Thracian sword''&lt;ref&gt;The Odrysian Kingdom of Thrace: Orpheus Unmasked (Oxford Monographs on Classical Archaeology) by Z. H. Archibald, {{ISBN|0-19-815047-4}},1998,page 203,""&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Ancient Greek]],"Θρακικον ξίφος") though it did not originate from there, despite its popular usage&lt;ref&gt;Complete Encyclopedia Of Arms &amp; Weapons (Hardcover)by Rh Value Publishing, {{ISBN|0-517-48776-4}}, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; (it was considered their national weapon&lt;ref name="Cicero 2004, page 122"/&gt;). The sword's utmost origin was the [[Hallstatt culture]]&lt;ref&gt;HaA(1200-1000), HaB(1000-800)&lt;/ref&gt; and the Thracians may have adopted or inherited it.

===Hellenic and Hellenistic===

During the [[Hellenistic period]] more Greek armaments were adopted. [[Seuthes II|Seuthes]] had adopted a Greek tactic for a night march (though night marches and attacks were a favourite Thracian tactic).&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon and the Art of Command by Godfrey Hutchinson, {{ISBN|1-85367-417-6}}, 2000, page 66&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thracian kings]] were the first to be [[Hellenized]].&lt;ref&gt;The Peloponnesian War: A Military Study (Warfare and History) by J.

==Barbarians==
Thracians were regarded as warlike, ferocious, and savagely bloodthirsty.&lt;ref&gt;The Thracians 700 BC-AD 46 (Men-at-Arms) by Christopher Webber and Angus McBride, 2001, {{ISBN|1-84176-329-2}}, page 1,"... getting to the spoils explains Thucydides VII, 29: `For the Thracian race, like all the most bloodthirsty barbarians, are always particularly bloodthirsty when everything is going their ...&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Armies of the Macedonian and Punic Wars 359 BC to 146 BC: organisation, tactics, dress and weapons by Duncan Head, Ian Heath, 1982, page 51&lt;/ref&gt; Thracians were seen as "''Barbarians''" by other peoples, namely the [[Ancient Greeks|Greek]]s and the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. [[Plato]] in his ''Republic'' considers them, along with the [[Scythians]],&lt;ref&gt;Plato. The Republic, "Take the quality of passion or spirit;--it would be ridiculous to imagine that this quality, when found in States, is not derived from the individuals who are supposed to possess it, e.g. the Thracians, Scythians, and in general the northern nations;"&lt;/ref&gt; extravagant and high spirited; and in his ''Laws'' considers them a war-like nation, grouping them with Celts, Persians, Scythians, Iberians and Carthaginians.&lt;ref&gt;Plato. Laws, "Are we to follow the custom of the Scythians, and Persians, and Carthaginians, and Celts, and Iberians, and Thracians, who are all warlike nations, or that of your countrymen, for they, as you say, altogether abstain?"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polybius]] wrote of Cotys' sober and gentle character being unlike that of most Thracians.&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, Histories, 27.12,"Cotys was a man of distinguished appearance and of Character of Cotys, king of the Odrysae, an ally of Perseus. great ability in military affairs, and besides, quite unlike a Thracian in character. For he was of sober habits, and gave evidence of a gentleness of temper and a steadiness of disposition worthy of a man of gentle birth".&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tacitus]] in his ''Annals'' writes of them being wild, savage and impatient, disobedient even to their own kings.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus.The Annals,"In the Consulship of Lentulus Getulicus and Caius Calvisius, the triumphal ensigns were decreed to Poppeus Sabinus for having routed some clans of
Thracians, who living wildly on the high mountains, acted thence with the more outrage and contumacy. The ground of their late commotion, not to mention the savage genius of the people, was their scorn and impatience, to have recruits raised amongst them, and all their stoutest men enlisted in our armies; accustomed as they were not even to obey their native kings further than their own humour, nor to aid them with forces but under captains of their own choosing, nor to fight against any enemy but their own borderers. Their discontents too were inflamed by a rumour which then ran current amongst them; that they were to be dispersed into different regions; and exterminated from their own, to be mixed with other nations. But before they took arms and began hostilities, they sent ambassadors to Sabinus, to represent "their past friendship and submission, and that the same should continue, if they were provoked by no fresh impositions: but, if like a people subdued by war, they were doomed to bondage; they had able men and steel, and souls determined upon liberty or death." The ambassadors at the same time pointed to their strongholds founded upon precipices; and boasted that they had thither conveyed their wives and parents; and threatened a war intricate, hazardous and bloody."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polyaenus]] and [[Strabo]] write how the Thracians broke their pacts of [[truce]] with trickery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.attalus.org/translate/polyaenus7.html#43.1 Thracians] The Thracians."The Thracians fought against the Boeotians by lake Copais, and were defeated; then they retreated to Helicon, and made a truce with the Boeotians for a certain number of days, to give time for agreeing the terms of peace. The Boeotians, who were confident because of their recent victory and the truce that followed it, celebrated a sacrifice in honour of Athene Itonia. But at night while they still were intent on the ceremony, and engaged in festivities, the Thracians armed, and attacked them; they cut many of them to pieces, and took a great number prisoners. When the Boeotians afterwards charged them with a breach of the truce, the Thracians replied that the terms of the truce expressed a certain number of days, but said nothing concerning the nights. [see also: Strabo, 9.401 (9.2.4)]"&lt;/ref&gt; The Thracians struck their weapons against each other before battle&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.attalus.org/translate/polyaenus2.html Polyaenus,Clearchus],"who brandished and struck their weapons against each other in the Thracian manner."&lt;/ref&gt; and engaged in night attacks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.attalus.org/translate/polyaenus2.html Polyaenus,Clearchus],"In order to test their readiness to meet a sudden attack, he chose a very dark night and in the middle of it, he appeared before his own camp at the head of a small detachment, who brandished and struck their weapons against each other in the Thracian manner. His troops, assuming that they were the enemy, immediately formed up to resist them. Meanwhile the Thracians really did advance in the hope of surprising them while they were asleep; but the Greeks, being already dressed and armed, confronted the assailants. The Thracians were unprepared for such a ready and vigorous resistance, and were defeated with great slaughter."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diegylis]] was considered one of the most bloothirsty chieftains by [[Diodorus Siculus]].

==Track listing==
#Trippin' on a Hole in a Paper Heart
#Pop's Love Suicide
#Ride the Cliché

==Composition and meaning==
The core music was written by drummer [[Eric Kretz]], while the lyrics were written by [[Scott Weiland]]. Although many fans have different interpretations of the lyrics, Weiland directly stated in a radio interview that the very ambiguous and mysterious lyrics to the song actually alluded to a "very bad experience dropping [[lysergic acid diethylamide|acid]]." In his autobiography ''Not Dead and Not For Sale'', he adds that it "reflects my hunger for redemption"&lt;ref&gt;''Not Dead and Not For Sale'' ([[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner]], 2010), pp120&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10323">[[File:Tsushima island en.png|thumb|[[Tsushima Island]] is located between Japan and Korea]]
The '''Tsushima incident''' occurred in 1861 when the Russians attempted to establish a year-round anchorage on the coast of the [[Tsushima Island|island of Tsushima]], a Japanese territory located between [[Kyushu]] and [[Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bS3w6tGiraEC&amp;pg=PA77 ''Negotiating with Imperialism'', Michael R. Auslin, p. 77]&lt;/ref&gt;

==British version of events==

===Arrival of the ''Posadnik''===

On 13 March 1861, the Russian [[corvette]] ''Posadnik'' (Посадник, 1856), captained by [[Nicolai Birilev]], arrived in Tsushima island in the inlet of Ozaki, the captain demanding landing rights. This event triggered fear in the Japanese [[Bakufu|Shogunate]], as the Russians had already attempted to breach Japan's [[sakoku|isolation policy]] in the northern island of [[Hokkaido]] with the events involving [[Adam Laxman]] in 1792, the burning of villages there in 1806, and the events leading to the arrest of [[Vasilii Golovnin]] in 1811.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bS3w6tGiraEC&amp;pg=PA78 ''Negotiating with Imperialism'', Michael R. Auslin, p. 78]&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, only a few Japanese ports were open to foreign ships ([[Hakodate]], [[Nagasaki]], [[Yokohama]]), and Tsushima was clearly not one of them, thus suggesting unfriendly intentions on the part of the Russians. If taken over by the Russians, Tsushima could have become an effective base for further aggression. Japan received British help to support its policy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bS3w6tGiraEC&amp;pg=PA78 ''Negotiating with Imperialism'', Michael R. Auslin, pp. 78–9]&lt;/ref&gt; As tension rose, a second Russian ship arrived, and requests were made by the Russians to build a landing base and to receive supplies.&lt;ref name="Auslin79"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bS3w6tGiraEC&amp;pg=PA79 ''Negotiating with Imperialism'', Michael R. Auslin, p. 79]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clash===


[[File:Kankō Maru in yokohama japan side.jpg|thumb|A modern replica of ''[[Kankō Maru]]'']]
On 13 May 1861, the Russians sent a launch to explore the eastern coast of the island, despite the presence of two [[Saga Domain]] warships, ''[[Kankō Maru]]'' and ''[[Denryū Maru]]'', as well as one British warship.&lt;ref name="Auslin79"/&gt; On May 21, 1861, a clash took place between the Russian sailors of a launch and a group of samurai and farmers, in which one farmer was killed and one samurai, who soon committed suicide, was captured by the Russians.&lt;ref name="Auslin79"/&gt; In mid-July, [[Hakodate bugyō]] [[Muragaki Norimasa]] went directly to the Russian Consulate in Hakodate, demanding the departure of the ship to the Russian Consul [[Goshkevitch]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bS3w6tGiraEC&amp;pg=PA80 ''Negotiating with Imperialism'', Michael R.

===Russian retreat===

As this strategy did not work, the Japanese asked the British to intervene, as they also had an interest in preventing the Russians from extending their influence in Asia.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; [[James Hope (Royal Navy officer)|Admiral Hope]] arrived in Tsushima with two warships on 28 August, and on 19 September 1861 ''Posadnik'' finally had to leave Tsushima.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bS3w6tGiraEC&amp;pg=PA81 ''Negotiating with Imperialism'', Michael R. Auslin, p. 81]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Russian version of events==

===Background===

The late 1850s saw a period of Russian expansion into the [[Sea of Japan]], with the [[Nikolayevsk-on-Amur|setting up a post in the estuary of the Amur]] in 1850, the acquisition of the present [[Primorsky Krai]] by the [[Treaty of Aigun]] (1858) and the [[Convention of Peking]] (1860), and the [[History of Vladivostok|establishment of Vladivostok]] in 1860.

In 1858 the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] leased a strip of [[Nagasaki|Nagasaki Bay]] coastline across the village of [[Mount Inasa|Inasa]] as a winter [[anchorage]] for the Chinese Flotilla's emerging Pacific Fleet (all domestic anchorages froze up in winter).&lt;ref name=S175&gt;Shirokorad, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; Flotilla commander Admiral [[Ivan Likhachev]] realized the dangers of basing the fleet in a foreign port,&lt;ref&gt;His fears were not improved by the well-publicized murder of unarmed midshipman Roman Mofet in Nagasaki on August 13, 1859 - Shirokorad, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; and settled on establishing a permanent base in Tsushima.&lt;ref name=S175/&gt; He was aware that the British had attempted to set their flag there in 1859 and had conducted hydrographic surveys around the island in 1855.&lt;ref name=S176&gt;Shirokorad, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; In 1860 he requested a go-ahead from the government in [[Saint Petersburg]]; the cautious foreign minister, [[Alexander Gorchakov]], ruled out any incursions against British interests,&lt;ref name=S176/&gt; while [[General Admiral]] [[Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich of Russia|Konstantin Nikolayevich]] suggested making a private deal with the head of [[Tsushima-Fuchū Domain]], as long as it did not disturb "the West".&lt;ref name=S176/&gt; In case of failure the Russian authorities would deny all knowledge of the expedition.&lt;ref&gt;Memorandum of Likhachev to General Admiral Great Prince Konstantin of 21 May 1860, in The Central State Navy Archive (St Petersburg), fund 410, folder 2, No. 2386, and No. 2386; further O. Belomor in Morskoi Sbornik', 1914, No.6.'&lt;/ref&gt;

===Landing===

In line with Likhachev's will and Konstantin's advice ''Posadnik'' left [[Hakodate]] February 20, 1861 and on March 1 reached the village of Osaki on the western coast of [[Asō Bay]] (Tatamura Bay in historical reports).&lt;ref name=S177&gt;Shirokorad, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sō Yoshiyori]], head of [[Sō clan]], immediately informed the [[Bakumatsu|Bakufu government]], however, the cautious cabinet of [[Andō Nobumasa]] delayed their response and Yoshiyori had to act on his own.&lt;ref name=S177/&gt; Birilev, captain of ''Posadnik'', made personal contact with Sō, exchanged courtesy gifts, and secured Yoshiyori's consent to survey the Imosaki Bay; ''Posadnik'' arrived there on April 2.&lt;ref name=S177/&gt; The crew disembarked, raised the Russian flag, and began building temporary housing, a landing jetty and prepared to refit the ship which needed repairs to [[propeller]] and [[stern tube]].&lt;ref name=S177/&gt; Japanese officials tacitly agreed with [[de facto]] establishing a naval base and even assigned a team of fifteen local carpenters to help the Russians;&lt;ref name=S177/&gt; the latter rewarded Sō with a gift of small naval cannons.&lt;ref name=S178&gt;Shirokorad, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; Likhachev inspected the bay twice, March 27 on board ''Oprichnik'' and April 16 on board ''Svetlana'' and recorded friendly behaviour of the Japanese,&lt;ref name=S177/&gt; however, in April the situation irreversibly changed.&lt;ref name=S178/&gt;

===Clash===

On April 12, 1861 when the Russians disembarked from their [[Launch (boat)|launches]], a group of local peasants led by one Matsumura Yasugorō attempted to bar entrance and drive the Russians back.&lt;ref name=S178/&gt; In the ensuing clash Yasugorō was killed, two Japanese peasants taken hostage, the rest fled; no Russian fatalities were recorded.&lt;ref name=S178/&gt; Sō appeased the population, ordering them to wait for a [[Bakufu]] pronouncement, and did not take any action.&lt;ref name=S178/&gt; Russian sources say nothing about presence of Japanese or British warship in the area.&lt;ref name=S179/&gt;

===Aftermath===

[[File:Oguri Tadamasa.jpg|thumb|left|[[Oguri Tadamasa]] attempted to negotiate the departure of the Russians from Tsushima in 1861]]
[[File:JapaneseEmbassy1860.jpg|thumb|left|Oguri Tadamasa (on the right, during the [[Japanese Embassy to the United States (1860)|Japanese Embassy to the United States]] in 1860)]] 
Oguri Tadamasa, the messenger of Bakufu, arrived in Tsushima in May and politely told Birilev to leave; Birilev explained that he would not move unless his own Admiral ordered him to retreat.&lt;ref name=S178/&gt; After 13 days of waiting in vain Oguri left; he left a letter allowing contacts between Birilev and local administration without prejudices against further radical action by the Japanese.&lt;ref name=S178/&gt; Birilev used the permit to the full, and persuaded the council of Japanese officials to issue a charter agreeing with Russian naval presence in Tsushima. Tsushima elders granted the coastline between Hiroura and Imosaki exclusively to the Russians and agreed to bar entrance to any other foreign nation.&lt;ref name=S178/&gt; The charter, however, clearly said that all these concessions depended on good will of the central government.&lt;ref name=S178/&gt; The latter vehemently opposed the deal and called the British envoy [[Rutherford Alcock]] for help.&lt;ref name=S178/&gt; Alcock immediately dispatched two ships under command of Vice Admiral [[James Hope (Royal Navy officer)|James Hope]].&lt;ref name=S179&gt;Shirokorad, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retreat===

Likhachev, as instructed by Konstantin, ordered a general retreat and sent the message to Tsushima with the ''Oprichnik''.&lt;ref name=S179/&gt; Birilev and ''Posadnik'' left Tsushima on September 7, 1861, while ''Oprichnik'' and ''Abrek'' stayed in the harbor; both left at the end of September 1861.&lt;ref name=S179/&gt; Likhachev later said that the failure had its upside:  "We did not allow the British conquest of the islands",&lt;ref name=S179/&gt; an opinion indirectly supported by contemporary personal meetings between Gorchakov and ambassador [[Francis Napier, 10th Lord Napier|Francis Napier]]; the latter, however, never gave a definite answer about British plans in Tsushima.&lt;ref name=S179/&gt; Likhachev was demoted from his command and tendered a voluntary resignation, which was rejected; the admiral was given command of a [[Baltic Fleet]] squadron.&lt;ref name=S179/&gt; The Russian Navy stayed at [[Nagasaki]] until the completion of the [[Lüshunkou District|Port Arthur]] base in [[China]].&lt;ref name=S180&gt;Shirokorad, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Use mdy dates|date=January 2016}}
The '''United Nations Conference on the Human Environment''' was held in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]] from June 5–16 in 1972.

When the [[United Nations General Assembly]] decided to convene the 1972 Stockholm Conference, at the initiative of the Government of Sweden to host it, UN Secretary-General [[U Thant]] invited [[Maurice Strong]] to lead it as Secretary-General of the Conference, as the Canadian diplomat (under [[Pierre Trudeau]]) had initiated and already worked for over two years on the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legal.un.org/avl/images/ha/dunche/08-l.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017102420/http://legal.un.org/avl/images/ha/dunche/08-l.jpg |archivedate=October 17, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Strong&gt;{{cite book|last=Strong|first=Maurice|title=Where on Earth are We Going?|year=2001|publisher=Texere|location=New York, London|isbn=1-58799-092-X|edition=Reprint|author2=Introduction by Kofi Annan |pages=120–136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Sweden first suggested to the United Nations Economic and Social Council [[ECOSOC]] in 1968 the idea of having a UN conference to focus on human interactions with the environment. ECOSOC passed resolution 1346 supporting the idea. General Assembly Resolution 2398 in 1969 decided to convene a conference in 1972 and mandated a set of reports from the UN secretary-general suggesting that the conference focus on "stimulating and providing guidelines for action by national government and international organizations" facing environmental issues.&lt;ref name=DeSombre&gt;{{cite book|last=DeSombre|first=Elizabeth|title=Global Environmental Institutions|year=2006|publisher=Rutledge|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preparations for the conference were extensive, lasting 4 years, including 115 governments, and costing over $30,000,000.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Goals for Environment Talks Listed|last=Astrachan|first=Anthony|date=March 17, 1972|work=The Washington Post, Times Herald|access-date=|page=A20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issues at the Conference ==
The [[Soviet Union]] and other [[Warsaw Pact]] nations boycotted the conference due to the lack of inclusion of [[East Germany]], which was not allowed to participate as it was not a full member of the UN.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Chinese Rip U.S. At Parley|last=Sterling|first=Claire|date=June 10, 1972|work=The Washington Post, Times Herald|access-date=|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the conference itself, divisions between developed and developing countries began to emerge. The Chinese delegation proved hostile to the United States at the conference, issuing a 17 point memorandum condemning [[Vietnam War|United States policies in Indochina]], as well as around the world. This stance emboldened other developing countries, which made up 70 of the 122 countries attending. Multiple countries including [[Pakistan]], [[Peru]], and [[Chile]] issued statements that were anti-colonial in nature, further worrying the United States delegation. So harsh was the criticism that [[Rogers Morton]], at that time secretary of the interior, remarked  "I wish the Russians were here", to divert the attention of the Chinese criticisms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Stockholm Declaration==
The meeting agreed upon a [[Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment|Declaration containing 26 principles concerning the environment and development]]; an Action Plan with 109 recommendations, and a Resolution.&lt;ref name="Baylis3"&gt;John Baylis, Steve Smith. 2005. The Globalization of World Politics (3rd ed). Oxford. Oxford University Press. pp. 454–455&lt;/ref&gt;

Principles of the Stockholm Declaration:&lt;ref&gt;Source: Clarke and Timberlake 1982&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Human rights]] must be asserted, [[apartheid]] and [[colonialism]] condemned
# [[Natural resources]] must be safeguarded
# The Earth's capacity to [[ecosystem services|produce]] [[renewable resource]]s must be maintained
# [[Wildlife]] must be safeguarded
# [[Non-renewable resource]]s must be shared and not exhausted
# [[Pollution]] must not exceed the environment's capacity to clean itself
# Damaging [[oceanic pollution]] must be prevented
# Development is needed to improve the environment
# [[Developing countries]] therefore need assistance
# Developing countries need reasonable prices for exports to carry out [[environmental management]]
# [[Environmental policy|Environment policy]] must not hamper development
# Developing countries need money to develop environmental safeguards
# Integrated development planning is needed
# Rational planning should resolve conflicts between environment and development
# Human settlements must be planned to eliminate [[environmental problems]]
# Governments should plan their own appropriate [[Human population planning|population policies]]
# National institutions must plan development of states' natural resources
# Science and technology must be used to improve the environment
# [[Environmental education]] is essential
# Environmental research must be promoted, particularly in developing countries
# States may exploit their resources as they wish but must not endanger others
# Compensation is due to states thus endangered
# Each nation must establish its own standards
# There must be cooperation on international issues
# [[International organization]]s should help to improve the environment
# [[weapon of mass destruction|Weapons of mass destruction]] must be eliminated

One of the seminal issues that emerged from the conference is the recognition for poverty alleviation for protecting the environment. The Indian Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]] in her seminal speech in the conference brought forward the connection between ecological management and [[poverty reduction|poverty alleviation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/books/books-reviews/indira-gandhi-the-environmentalist/article18514883.ece|title=Indira Gandhi, the environmentalist|last=Venkat|first=Vidya|work=The Hindu|access-date=2017-05-21|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180507162647/http://www.thehindu.com/books/books-reviews/indira-gandhi-the-environmentalist/article18514883.ece|archivedate=May 7, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue&lt;ref&gt;Björn-Ola Linnér and Henrik Selin The Thirty Year Quest for Sustainability: The Legacy of the 1972 UN Conference on the Human Environment, Paper presented at Annual Convention of International Studies Association, Portland, Oregon, USA, February 25 – March 1, 2003, as part of the panel “Institutions and the Production of Knowledge for Environmental Governance” (co-author Henrik Selin).p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; that this conference, and more importantly the scientific conferences preceding it, had a real impact on the environmental policies of the [[European Community]] (that later became the [[European Union]]). For example, in 1973, the EU created the Environmental and Consumer Protection Directorate, and composed the first Environmental Action Program. Such increased interest and research collaboration arguably paved the way for further understanding of global warming, which has led to such agreements as the [[Kyoto Protocol]] and the [[Paris Agreement]], and has given a foundation of modern environmentalism.

There is also an annual VMworld conference held in Europe, usually in October following the US conference.

The conference normally lasts between 3 and 5 days, and consists of breakout sessions, panels, exhibit hall, and hands-on labs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4124">'''Vilanova International World Music Festival''' is a multicultural festival of music, workshops and conferences, that is taking place every year along the third weekend of July, in [[Vilanova i la Geltrú]], in [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]], since 1981. It is the oldest [[world music]] festival in Catalonia and also in Spain having been far ahead of its time. The festival lasts for three days and the programme covers from 11 o’clock in the morning until night. There are more than thirty activities thought up for children and adults. Most of performances in this event are free.

The festival is also characterized by the good atmosphere, the integration of all kind of audiences, locals from Vilanova i la Geltrú and also tourists.

The festival is organized by Vilanova i la Geltrú Council, with Catalan national government support.

This festival belongs to the most selected group of world music festivals in [[Spain]]: Etnosur ([[Alcalá la Real]], [[Jaén, Spain|Jaén]], [[Andalucía]]), [[Getxo]] ([[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]]), La Mar de Músicas ([[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]], [[Murcia]]), [[Ortigueira]] ([[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]), and Pirineos Sur ([[Aragón]]). In Catalonia another important event is [[Fira Mediterrania in Manresa]], the most important folk market in Mediterranean area.

A long list of artists -more than 300- from the Catalan Countries and all over the world -from more than sixty different countries- has paid a visit to the Festival throughout its history. Some of the names on the roll have become internationally well-known and famous artists.

In 2008 the Festival incorporates for the first time a section addressed to children, baptized like "Small Musicians", and another known as "Vermut Meetings", in which the artists explain to the public their projects.

In 2010 the Festival celebrated its 30th anniversary. Television of Catalonia has produced a special program devoted to the thirty years of the festival, through the program Rodasons.

Also in 2010 the festival creates the network [[Festivals with Charm]], together with the festival Altaveu in [[Sant Boi de Llobregat]], and Acústica in [[Figueres]].

In the summer of 2010 issue, Interfolk magazine has said about the Vilanova festival: "one of most important appointments of the musical summer in [[Spain]]. FiMPT was born in full effervescence of the process of recovery of traditional elements and festivities, and conceived like an open platform to every type of traditional music, coming from the country and internationally, to announce the possibilities of expression and of definition of this type of music. Three decades after its creation, it has consolidated fully and has accredited as one of the most important examples in [[Europe]] in its style and one of the most complete in its genre".
