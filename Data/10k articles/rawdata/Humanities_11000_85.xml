The '''1975 Brussels summit''' was the third [[NATO summit]] bringing the leaders of member nations together at the same time.  The formal sessions and informal meetings in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]] took place on 29–30 May 1975.&lt;ref name="nato1"&gt;[http://www.nato.int/issues/summits/index.html#agendas  NATO summit meetings] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5gWo4KcXm?url=http://www.nato.int/issues/summits/index.html |date=2009-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This event was only the third meeting of the NATO heads of state following the ceremonial signing of the [[North Atlantic Treaty]] on 4 April 1949.&lt;ref name="thomas101"&gt;Thomas, Ian Q.R. (1997).

==Background==
In this period, the organization faced a generational challenge; and the unresolved questions concerned whether  a new generation of leaders would be as committed to NATO as their predecessors had been.&lt;ref name="thomas101"/&gt;

==Agenda==
The general discussions focused on the need for affirming of the fundamental importance of the Alliance,  Other topics included, 
* Allied cohesion in the face of international economic pressures following the 1974 oil crisis; and
* Support for successful conclusion of negotiations in the framework of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE).&lt;ref name="nato1"/&gt;

The '''American Institute of Indian Studies''' ('''AIIS'''), founded in 1961, is a consortium of 87 universities and colleges in the United States that promotes the advancement of knowledge about India in the U.S. It carries out this purpose by: awarding fellowships to scholars and artists to carry out their research and artistic projects in India; by operating intensive programs in a variety of Indian languages in India; by sponsoring conferences, workshops and outreach activities; by supporting U.S. study abroad and service learning programs in India; by assisting and facilitating the research of all U.S. scholars in India; and by operating two research archives, the Archives and Research Center for Ethnomusicology and the Center for Art and Archaeology.&lt;ref name=AboutAIIS/&gt; The AIIS is a member of the [[Council of American Overseas Research Centers]].&lt;ref name=CAOC/&gt;
[[File:AIIS headquarters.jpg|alt=AIIS campus in Gurugram, Haryana, India|thumb|AIIS campus in Gurugram, Haryana, India]]

==Activities==

The U.S. headquarters of the AIIS are at the [[University of Chicago]]. The main center in India is at [[Gurgaon]] with an additional center in Defence Colony in New Delhi. The AIIS also has offices in Kolkata and Pune.&lt;ref name=AboutAIIS/&gt; AIIS awards junior fellowships to Ph.D. candidates at universities in the U.S. to carry out their doctoral dissertation research in India. Senior fellowships are for scholars holding the doctoral degree to conduct their research in India. AIIS fellows are scholars in a broad range of academic disciplines including Anthropology, Geography, History, Literature, Political Science, Public Health, Regional Planning, Religious Studies and many other fields. AIIS also offers performing and creative arts fellowships to musicians, dancers, visual and multi-media artists to carry out their artistic projects in India. AIIS operates intensive language programs in India for the summer and the academic year. The [http://www.aiislanguageprograms.org language programs] are located at sites where the language is spoken. The Hindi program is the largest, located in Jaipur. Other programs include Urdu and Mughal Persian (located in Lucknow), Bengali (located in Kolkata), Punjabi (located in Chandigarh), Marathi and Sanskrit (located in Pune), Tamil (located in Madurai), Malayalam (located in Thiruvananthapuram), Telugu (located in Hyderabad) and Gujarati (located in Ahmedabad). AIIS also offers programs in very rarely taught languages such as Oriya and Sindhi, upon request. The AIIS operates the Bengali, Hindi, Punjabi and Urdu summer language programs for the U.S. State Department's [[Critical Language Scholarship Program]] at its centers in Kolkata, Jaipur, Chandigarh, and Lucknow respectively. AIIS also operates the fall semester Hindi and Urdu programs for the South Asia Flagship Languages Initiative (SAFLI) for Boren Scholars [https://www.borenawards.org/scholarships/thinking-applying/special-initiatives/south-asian-flagship-languages-initiative-safli]. The AIIS awards annual [http://www.indiastudies.org/book-prize/ book prizes] to young scholars and also holds a dissertation-to-book workshop at the [https://southasiaconference.wisc.edu/ annual Madison South Asia conference in October]. AIIS offers an array of services to [http://www.indiastudies.org/international-learning/ U.S. study abroad programs], including assistance with obtaining student visas as well as logistical support. AIIS is also involved in a project to facilitate American students' [http://www.indiastudies.org/arranging-internships/ service learning internships with Indian NGOs]. AIIS also hosts conferences, symposia, and workshops sometimes with other members of the Council of American Overseas Research Centers, such as a [http://www.indiastudies.org/aiis-and-other-orcs-sufi-shrines-workshop-in-aurangabad/ workshop on Sufi Shrines] held in Aurangabad, India in August 2014. AIIS publishes [http://www.indiastudies.org/news/newsletters/ semiannual newsletters] reporting on its fellows' research, the activities of its research centers, and events such as conferences and workshops. The AIIS is actively engaged in publishing the ''Encyclopaedia of Indian Temple Architecture'', a multi-volume work.&lt;ref name=CAOC/&gt;

==Archives==

The AIIS runs the Archive and Research Center for [[Ethnomusicology]] and the [[Center for Art and Archaeology]] at Gurgaon, both major research centers with large libraries and archives.&lt;ref name=CAOC/&gt; A collection of photographs from the AIIS forms the main component of the South Asia Art Archive at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], established in 1979. The only other such collection is the AIIS collection at Gurgaon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |title=The South Asia Art Archive
 |publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]]
 |accessdate=2012-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AIIS has partnered with [[ARTstor]] to share over 50,000 images of [[Indian art]] and [[Indian architecture|architecture]] from the AIIS photo archive in a Digital Library. In all the archive contains about 140,000 photographs and slides of  sculpture, numismatics, painting, manuscripts and miniature paintings. It also contains images, architectural drawings, and site plans of [[Buddhist architecture|Buddhist]], Jain, [[Hindu architecture|Hindu]], and [[Islamic architecture]].&lt;ref name=ARTstor/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2573">The '''Anticato''' (sometimes '''Anti-Cato'''; [[Latin]]: '''''Anticatones''''') was a [[polemic]] written by [[Julius Caesar]] in hostile reply to [[Cicero]]'s pamphlet praising [[Cato the Younger]]. The text is lost and survives only in fragments.  [[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]], dissatisfied with Cicero's work, wrote a second pamphlet in praise of Cato and called, simply, "Cato," which provoked a reply from [[Octavian]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], Life of Augustus 85.1 http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/suetonius/suet.aug.html#85&lt;/ref&gt;  Octavian's work is not known to have been called Anticato but must have been modeled on Caesar's reply to Cicero.

== Background ==
{{main|Cato the Younger}}
Cato was a famously stubborn [[Stoicism|Stoic]], who came into conflict with Caesar at the [[Second Catilinarian conspiracy|Catiline conspiracy]] trial. Cato argued for capital punishment for [[Lucius Sergius Catilina]] and his conspirators, so as to set an example and discourage similar [[treason]]. Caesar argued for a private judgement and clemency. The Senate agreed with Cato, and the executions were carried out; the rebel army disbanded and fled. During the debate, however, Cato had called out Caesar for reading personal messages in the Senate; Caesar defended himself, saying he was only reading a [[love letter]]. Cato insisted on reading it, and to widespread dismay, it was what Caesar said—exposing his affair with [[Servilia (mother of Marcus Junius Brutus)|Servilia]], the half-sister of Cato. Servilia was forced to divorce.

Next, during the [[triumvirate]] of Caesar, [[Pompey]], and [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]], Cato interfered with Caesar's plans for a [[Roman triumph|triumph]] for himself, while supporting one for Pompey. Cato opposed Caesar's every political step afterward, in particular leading the opposition to Caesar's return to Rome in 49 BC without relinquishing his proconsulship. Caesar famously crossed the [[Rubicon]] and came to Rome regardless, sparking the Roman Civil War. When Caesar prevailed in the war and looked to seize power in Rome, Cato committed suicide.

Several leading Romans wrote works in posthumous praise or criticism of Cato. A famous [[panegyric]] by [[Cicero]] titled simply ''Cato'' led to Caesar writing his ''Anticato'' in response.

The '''Arab Cold War''' ({{lang-ar|الحرب العربية الباردة}} ''al-Harb al-`Arabbiyah al-bārdah'') was a series of conflicts in the [[Arab world]] between the new republics led by [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] of [[Egypt]] and espousing [[Arab nationalism]], [[Arab socialism]], and [[Pan-Arabism]] and the more [[Traditionalism (Islam)|traditionalist]] kingdoms, led by [[King of Saudi Arabia|King]] [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref name=gold-75-led&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gold|first1=Dore|title=Hatred's Kingdom|date=2003|publisher=Regnery|location=Washington, DC|page=75|quote=Even before he became king, Faisal turned to [[Islam]] as a counterweight to Nasser's [[Arab socialism]]. The struggle between the two leaders became an Arab cold war, pitting the new Arab [[republic]]s against the older Arab kingdoms.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The period of conflict began following the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952]] and the rise to power of Nasser, and lasted until 1970, when he died, although others think it lasted until the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|final end of the Cold War]] in 1991.{{fact|date=September 2014}}

Despite its beginnings during the global [[Cold War]] and era of European [[decolonization]], and its links and interactions to that wider Cold War, the Arab Cold War was not a clash between [[Capitalism|capitalist]] and [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] regimes. The two sides were [[Arab nationalism|Arab nationalist]] [[republic]]s, usually quasi-[[Arab socialism|socialist]] and [[Pan-Arabism|Pan-Arabist]] in orientation, and the traditional [[Monarchy|monarchies]], usually with quasi-[[Feudalism|feudal]] or [[Rentier state|rentierist]] economic structures. The leading Arab nationalist state during this period was [[Egypt]], closely followed by and in competition with [[Syria]] (with which Egypt briefly united to form the [[United Arab Republic]] from 1958 to 1961). The leading [[Conservatism|conservative]] monarchy was [[Saudi Arabia]], with [[Jordan]] (and initially [[Kingdom of Iraq|Iraq]]) reluctantly falling in the same but competing camp.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Although in theory, almost all of the [[Member states of the Arab League|Arab states]] were [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned]] during this period, in practice, the nationalist republics, with the notable exception of [[Lebanon]], were allied to the [[Soviet Union]] even as most of them ruthlessly suppressed the [[Communist party|communist parties]] within their countries while the conservative monarchies generally received military help from the [[United States]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

The expression "Arab Cold War" was coined by [[United States|American]] [[political science|political scientist]] and [[Middle East]] scholar [[Malcolm H. Kerr]], in his 1965 book of that title, and subsequent editions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20000609172134/http://www.aub.edu.lb/themes/1999/Kerr/writings.html Writings by Malcolm H. Kerr]

==Background==
Over the period, the history of the Arab states varies widely. In 1956, the year of the [[Suez Crisis]], only [[Egypt]], [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Tunisia]], and [[Sudan]], among the Arab states were republics; all, to some degree, subscribed to the Arab nationalist ideology, or at least paid lip-service to it. Jordan and Iraq were both [[Hashemites|Hashemite]] monarchies; [[Morocco]], [[Kingdom of Libya|Libya]], Saudi Arabia, and [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen|North Yemen]] all had independent dynasties; and [[French Algeria|Algeria]], [[Aden Protectorate|South Yemen]], [[Oman]], and the [[Trucial States]] remained under colonial rule. By 1960, [[Iraq]], [[Tunisia]], [[Algeria]], and [[Yemen Arab Republic|North Yemen]] had republican governments or Arab nationalist insurgencies while Lebanon had a [[1958 Lebanon crisis|near-civil war]] between US-aligned and Arab nationalist factions within the government.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Because conflicts in the period varied over time and with different locations and perspectives, it is dated differently, depending on sources. Jordanian sources, for example, date the commencement of the Arab Cold War to April 1957,&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=N8RsILO1t5EC&amp;dq=%22Water+Resources+in+Jordan%22+%22Munther+J.+Haddadin%22&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bn&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=CW31SvWnC4zu6gOFhrQS#v=onepage&amp;q=Arab%20Cold%20War&amp;f=false Water resources in Jordan: evolving policies for development, the environment, and conflict resolution]'', p.250&lt;/ref&gt; while Palestinian sources note the period of 1962 to 1967 as being most significant to them but within the larger Arab context.&lt;ref&gt;Bahgat Korany, [http://www.passia.org/seminars/96/arab_statesII.htm The Arab States in the Regional and International System: II. Rise of New Governing Elite and the Militarization of the Political System (Evolution)] at [[Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952 King [[Farouk of Egypt]] was [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|deposed]] by the [[Free Officers Movement (Egypt)|Free Officers Movement]] under a program to dismantle [[feudalism]] and end [[History of Egypt under the British|British influence in Egypt]]. In 1953 the officers, led by Nasser, abolished the monarchy and declared Egypt a Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Aburish, Said K. (2004), Nasser, the Last Arab, New York City: St. Martin's Press, {{ISBN|978-0-312-28683-5}}, p.35-39&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 July 1956, Nasser nationalized the [[Suez Canal]], following the withdrawal of an offer by Britain and the United States to fund the building of the [[Aswan Dam]], which was in response to Egypt's new ties with the Soviet Union. Britain, France, and Israel responded by occupying the Canal but were forced to back off in what is known as the [[Suez Crisis]]. Nasser "emerged" from the crisis with great prestige, as the "unchallenged leader of Arab nationalism".&lt;ref name=gold-75&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gold|first1=Dore|title=Hatred's Kingdom|date=2003|publisher=Regnery|location=Washington, DC|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nasser employed a number of political instruments in order to raise his profile across the Arab world – from radio programs such as the Voice of the Arabs to the organised dispatch of politically-active Egyptian professionals, usually teachers.

In July 1958, the Hashemite [[Kingdom of Iraq]] was [[14 July Revolution|overthrown]], with the king, crown prince and prime minister all killed by the nationalist revolutionaries. Iraq's monarchy was also replaced by a republic with an Arab nationalist orientation. Forces supporting Nasser and nationalism seemed ascendant, and older Arab monarchies seemed in peril.&lt;ref name=gold-75 /&gt; In 1969, yet another Arab kingdom fell, when the Free Officers Movement of Libya, a group of rebel military officers led by Colonel [[Muammar Gaddafi]], [[1969 Libyan coup d'état|overthrew]] the [[Kingdom of Libya]] led by [[Idris of Libya|King Idris]].

In Saudi Arabia, Nasser's popularity was such that some Saudi princes (led by [[Talal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud|Prince Tala bin Abdul Aziz]]) rallied to his cause of [[Arab socialism]].&lt;ref name=gold-75 /&gt; In 1962, a Saudi Air Force pilot defected to [[Cairo]].&lt;ref name=gold-75 /&gt; There were signs of "unrest and subversion" in 1965 and 1966, "especially" in Saudi's oil producing region.&lt;ref name=gold-75 /&gt; In 1969, a Nasserist plot was uncovered by the Saudi government "involving 28 army officer, 34 air force officers, nine other military personnel, and 27 civilians."&lt;ref&gt;Internal Security in Saudi Arabia, United Kingdom, Public Record Office, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, FC08/1483, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gold-75 /&gt;

In the early 1960s, Nasser sent an [[North Yemen Civil War#Egyptian offensives|expeditionary army]] to Yemen to support the anti-monarchist forces in the [[North Yemen Civil War]]. Yemen royalists were supported by Saudi Arabia and Jordan (both monarchies). Egyptian air power struck Saudi border towns like Najran in December 1962.&lt;ref name=gold-75 /&gt;

By the late 1960s, Nasser's prestige was diminished by the political failure of the [[United Arab Republic|political union of Egypt and Syria]], and the military failures in Yemen where the civil war [[North Yemen Civil War#Stalemate|stalemated]] despite his commitment of thousands of troops to overthrow the monarchists, and especially with Israel where Egypt lost the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and 10,000 to 15,000 troops killed during the [[Six-Day War]]. In late 1967, Nasser and Saudi foreign minister Prince Faisal signed a treaty under which Nasser would pull out his 20,000 troops from Yemen, Faisal would stop sending arms to Yemen royalists, and three neutral Arab states would send in observers.&lt;ref name=beginningto&gt;{{Cite news|issn=0040-781X|title=Beginning to Face Defeat|work=Time|accessdate=August 26, 2008|date=1967-09-08|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,899762-2,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islamic revival ===
{{Main|Islamic revival}}
Though far smaller in population than Egypt, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia had oil wealth and prestige as the land of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]], the two holy cities of Islam. To use Islam as a counterweight to Nasser's Arab socialism, Saudi Arabia sponsored an international Islamic conference in Mecca in 1962. It created the [[Muslim World League]], dedicated to spreading Islam and fostering Islamic solidarity. The League was "extremely effective" in promoting Islam, particularly conservative [[Wahhabi]] Islam, and also served to combat "radical alien ideologies" (such as Arab socialism) in the Muslim world.&lt;ref name=gold-76&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gold|first1=Dore|title=Hatred's Kingdom|date=2003|publisher=Regnery|location=Washington, DC|page=75-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Particularly after the Six Day War, Islamic revival strengthened throughout the Arab World. After Nasser's death in 1970, his successor, Anwar Sadat, emphasized religion and economic liberalization rather than Arab nationalism and socialism. In Egypt's "shattering" 1967 defeat,&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Caryle, ''Passion for Islam : Shaping the Modern Middle East: the Egyptian Experience'', (Simon and Schuster, 2002, p.31)&lt;/ref&gt; "Land, Sea and Air" had been the military slogan. In the perceived victory of the [[Yom Kippur War|1973 war]], it was replaced with the pious battle cry of ''[[Takbir|Allahu Akbar]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''Sacred Rage'', (p.64-7)&lt;/ref&gt; While some argue Israel's counterattack belied claims of Arab victory, the Saudi-led [[1973 oil crisis#Arab oil embargo|oil embargo]] was a major success.

In Egypt, the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], which had been suppressed by the Egyptian government and aided by Saudi Arabia, was allowed to publish a monthly magazine, and its political prisoners were gradually released.&lt;ref name=Kepel.p.103&gt;Kepel, Gilles. ''Muslim Extremism in Egypt; the Prophet and Pharoh'', Gilles Kepel, p.103-4&lt;/ref&gt; At universities, Islamists&lt;ref&gt;particularly [[al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya]]&lt;/ref&gt; took control and drove (anti-Sadat) student leftist and Pan-Arabist organizations underground.&lt;ref name=Kepel.p.129&gt;Kepel, Gilles. ''Muslim Extremism in Egypt; the Prophet and Pharoh'', Gilles Kepel, 1985,  p.129&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1970s, Sadat called himself 'The Believer President'. He banned most sales of alcohol and ordered Egypt's state-run television to interrupt programs with [[salat]] (call to prayer) on the screen five times a day and to increase religious programming.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Caryle, ''Passion for Islam : Shaping the Modern Middle East: the Egyptian Experience'', Simon and Schuster, 2002, p.36&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aris Konstantinidis''' ({{Lang-el|Άρης Κωνσταντινίδης}}; 1913 in Athens - 1993 in Athens) was a notable architect of [[modernism]] in [[Greece]].

Aris Konstantinidis was born in Athens and studied architecture at the [[Technical University of Munich]] from 1931 to 1936, where he came into contact with the [[Modern Movement]] in architecture. He returned to Greece in 1936 and worked for the Town Planning Department of the city of Athens and for the Ministry of Public Works. He was appointed head of the Workers Housing Organisation from 1955 to 1975 and from 1957 to 1967 of the Technical Service of the [[Greek National Tourism Organisation]], where he planned and oversaw the construction of a series of workers' houses and  [[Xenia (Hotel)|Xenia hotels]]. At the same time, Konstantinidis planned and realised several private projects like the emblematic Weekend House in Anavyssos.&lt;ref&gt;Giamarelos, S. (2014). The Art of Building Reception: Aris Konstantinidis behind the Global Published Life of his Weekend House in Anavyssos (1962–2014). Architectural Histories, 2(1), Art. 22. DOI: http://doi.org/10.5334/ah.bx&lt;/ref&gt;

He devoted extensive study to the anonymous architecture of Greece and between 1947 and 1953 published three books in which he examined particular examples of this type of architecture. In 1975 he published a comprehensive book concerning the anonymous architecture of Greece, entitled ''Elements of Self-knowledge: Towards a true architecture'', in which it is apparent how much he was influenced by the architectural tradition of his homeland and how he drew lessons from the past to develop an architecture for his time. In his last book, entitled ''Theoktista'' ("God-built"), the architect once again underlined his belief that anonymous architecture as well as the landscape of Greece itself constituted the foundations on which modern architectural practice could and should be grounded.

He taught at the [[Zurich Polytechnic]] as a visiting professor. In 1978 he received an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Thessaloniki]]. He was appointed a corresponding member of the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich]].

Through his work, Aris Konstantinidis created architectural solutions unique in Greece, which gave birth to a modern Greek architecture.

== Personal life ==
In 1951 Konstantinidis married the famous Greek sculptor [[Natalia Mela]]. They had two children: Dimitris Konstantinidis is also an architect and Alexandra Tsoukala is a light designer.

[[File:Mandal 002.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Bharat Itihas Sanshodhak Mandal, Pune]]

'''Bharat Itihas Sanshodhak Mandal''', popularly known as Itihas Sanshodhak Mandal or just ‘Mandal’, is an Indian institute providing resources and training for historical researchers. It is located at [[Pune]] in [[Maharashtra]] state. The institute was founded in 1910 by the veteran Indian historian [[Vishwanath Kashinath Rajwade]] and '''Sardar K. C. Mehendale'''.

==Objective==
The main objective behind setting up the ''Mandal'' was to provide ready resources to the historians and researchers, to save their time and to motivate them. Rajwade conceived this idea long back but could not fulfill it until Sardar Mehendale met him and on his own expressed his readiness to support him for anything that he wished to do for the betterment of history.

==History==
The ''Mandal'' was founded on 7 July 1910 by the veteran Indian historian Vishwanath Kashinath Rajwade and Sardar Khanderao Chintaman Mehendale at Sardar Mehendale’s palace at Appa Balwant Chowk in Pune. To commence the activity Rajwade read an essay in the presence of the only listener Sardar Mehendale. Later on, the ''Mandal'' moved to its present building located in Sadashiv Peth area in the heart of the city. In March 1926 the short tempered Rajwade left Pune due to differences with the then Administrators of the ''Mandal'' and shifted to [[Dhule]] to form another institute which   was named after him as ‘Rajwade Sanshodhan Mandir’. The ''Mandal'' at Pune, however, continued following on its mission to help researchers and contribute to the progress of historical study. It has since then been highly supported by the people and scholars by way of donations and bequests of books and papers. Rajwade’s disciples [[Datto Vaman Potdar]], [[Ganesh Hari Khare]] and [[Vasudeo Sitaram Bendrey]] are believed to have played major role in prospering the ''Mandal'' and its activities.

==Resources==
[[Image:Mandal 001.jpg|thumb|Founder of the Mandal : V.K.Rajwade]]

Presently, the ''Mandal'' maintains more than 1,500,000 historical papers and {{nowrap|30,000}} scripts mainly in [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Modi script|Modi]], [[Persian language|Persian]], Portuguese and English languages. Moreover, it has also preserved over {{nowrap|4,000 coins}}, {{nowrap|1,000 paintings}} and a few sculptures and inscriptions in its well equipped museum. The ''Mandal''’s library keeps a more than {{nowrap|27,000}} books written mainly in Marathi and English which can be available to the researchers for free reading or for a nominal fee on ‘Take Home’ basis. These resources hold sizeable volumes on the history of [[Maratha Empire]], Maratha culture and Marathi literature. They also contain a large collection of the material on [[British Rule]] as well as [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Rule over India. The ''Mandal'' issues a Quarterly Journal called ‘Trai-Masik’ wherein essays and articles on new discoveries are presented. It has also published books written and edited by veteran historians and reports of annual conferences and historians' meets. The ''Mandal'' periodically organises lectures, workshops, training, seminars and study tours for the young researchers and historians.

==Funding==
It was reported in 2004 that the ''Mandal'' was insufficiently funded to micro-film or digitise its collection.&lt;ref name="toi"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2004-01-23/pune/28333240_1_ancient-manuscripts-sanskrit-rare-books|title=Libraries struggle to preserve books|last=Damle|first=Manjiri|author2=Neil Pate|date=23 January 2004|work=The Times of India|publisher=Bennett, Coleman &amp; Co.

{{Anthropology of art|Related articles}}
'''Cantometrics''' ("song measurements") is a method developed by [[Alan Lomax]] and a team of researchers for relating elements of the world's [[tradition]]al vocal music (or [[folk music|folk songs]])  to features of [[sociology|social]] organization as defined via [[George Murdock]]'s  [[Human Relations Area Files]], resulting in a taxonomy of expressive human communications style. Lomax defined Cantometrics as the study of singing as normative expressive behavior and maintained that Cantometrics reveals folk performance style to be a "systems-maintaining framework" which models key patterns of co-action in everyday life. His work on Cantometrics gave rise to further comparative studies of aspects of human communication in relation to culture, including: Choreometrics, Parlametrics, Phonotactics (an analysis of vowel frequency in speech), and Minutage (a study of breath management). 

Instead of the traditional Western musicological descriptive criteria of pitch, rhythm, and harmony, Cantometrics employs 37 style factors developed by Lomax and his team in consultation with specialists in [[linguistics]], [[otolaryngology]] and [[Speech and Language Pathology|voice therapy]]. The vocal style factors were designed to be easily rated by observers on a five-point scale according to their presence or absence. They include, for example: group cohesion in singing; orchestral organization; tense or relaxed vocal quality; breathiness; short or long phrases; rasp (vocal grating, such as associated, for example with the singing of Louis Armstrong); presence and percentage of [[vocables]] versus meaningful words); and [[melisma]] ([[Ornament (music)|ornamentation]]), to name a few. 

In the early stages of his work on the Cantometrics coding system, Lomax wrote of the relationship of musical style to culture:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Its fundamental diagnostic traits appear to be vocal quality (color, timbre, normal pitch, attack, type of melodic ornamentation, etc.) and the degree in which song is normally monodic or polyphonic. The determinative socio-psychological factors seem to be . . . the type of social organization, the pattern of erotic life, and the treatment of children.... I myself believe that the voice quality is the root [diagnostic] element. From this socio-psychological complex there seem to arise a complex of habitual musical practices which we call musical style"&lt;ref&gt;[http://research.culturalequity.org/psr-history.jsp Cantometrics: Concept of Style]&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History of the theory==

Lomax first publicly proposed the Cantometrics project in 1959 and launched a group project in conjunction with the Anthropology Department at Columbia University to implement his vision. Early collaborators included musicologist Victor Grauer, who was the first co-creator with Lomax of the Cantometrics computer coding system. Subsequent project members included distinguished [[Columbia University]] anthropologist [[Conrad M. Arensberg]],&lt;ref&gt;Author of the pathbreaking ethnographic classic, ''The Irish Countryman: An Anthropological Study'', (1937), Arensberg helped shift the focus of anthropology from the study of exotic primitive peoples to the examination of complex modern societies. See his [https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/16/nyregion/conrad-arensberg-86-dies-hands-on-anthropologist.html  1997 ''New York Times'' obituary.]&lt;/ref&gt; a founder of [[applied anthropology]]; anthropologists Edwin Erickson and Barbara Ayres; and statistician Norman Berkowitz. [[Laban Movement Analysis|Laban shape notation]] specialist [[Irmgard Bartenieff]] &lt;ref&gt;Pioneer physical therapist and developer of [[Bartenieff Fundamentals]], [http://www.culturalequity.org/alanlomax/ce_alanlomax_profile_irmgard_bartenieff.php Irmgard Bartinieff] is profiled on Lomax website [http://www.culturalequity.org/ Culturalequity.org].&lt;/ref&gt; and dancer and movement therapist Forrestine Paulay co-created the Choreometrics movement coding system, for analyzing dance, mapping the movement of the torso, hands, feet, and use of performance space. In 1968 Lomax's research team published a book, ''Folk Song Style and Culture'', in which they stated that, "for the first time, predictable and universal relationships have been established between the expressive and communication processes, on the one hand, and social structure and culture pattern, on the other". 

Gideon D'Arcangelo, a member of the Cantometrics team, described their work this way:&lt;blockquote&gt;Using 37 criteria of observation, the Cantometrics team analyzed over 4,000 songs – around 10 representative songs from over 400 cultures. Each song profile they made was recorded on a computer punch-card and loaded onto the Columbia mainframe. A companion study of dance, Choreometrics, produced analyses of over 1,500 dance performances. Only a computer was capable of handling this enormous data set and looking for the patterns hidden within. The team, led by programmer Norman Berkowitz, developed a powerful set of statistically driven software tools to sort, separate, and group the performance data. Their analyses resulted in the first ever taxonomy of human performance style and in a series of maps showing the dis-semination of culture across the planet. These were presented to the American Association of Science (1966) and later published in the collaborative volume, ''Folk Song Style and Culture'' (1968).&lt;ref&gt;[http://aln2.albumlinernotes.com/Popular_Songbook.html Gideon D'Arcangelo, "Alan Lomax and the Big Story of Sound" in liner notes to ''The Alan Lomax Popular Song Book'' Rounder CD 82161-1863-1 (2003)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Results==

The Cantometric study of song revealed strong statistical relations between song style and social norms. Alan Lomax stated that the Cantometrics analysis amply justified his original hypothesis that sexually restrictive and highly punitive societies correlated with degree of vocal tension. The tendency to sing together in groups, tonal cohesiveness, and the likelihood of polyphonic singing were all associated with fewer restrictions on women. Multipart singing occurs in societies where the sexes have a complementary relationship.  

Other results included strong correlations between length of phrase and precision of articulation, and degree of ornamentation with social stratification. It was found that explicitness or the information load of song varies with the level of economic productivity of the subsistence system.

Murdock's taxonomy encoded the economic, social, and political features of more than 1,100 societies that ethnologists had studied up until that time. In many cases, these codes formed scales – for example, the one concerning the number of levels of political authority outside the local community, from 0 among hunters, to 4 for irrigation empires. Lomax and Arensberg arranged the codes into scales in order to measure the kinds of behaviors of features of culture, such as levels of  production or permanence of settlement.  When they added factors of expressive communication  to the Murdock  measures of social relations it produced a geographical taxonomy of human culture.

==Branching out into Choreometrics==

Three chapters of ''Folk Song Style and Culture'' are devoted to Choreometrics. In chapter ten, "Dance, Style, and Culture," Lomax, Bartenieff, and Paulay describe the origin and meaning of the term: "In order to distinguish the level of this comparative study of movement from the levels where previous investigators have worked, we have given the method a freshly-coined designation, Choreometrics, meaning the measure of dance, or dance as a measure of culture.".&lt;ref&gt;Lomax (1968), p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; They wrote that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Choreometrics tests the proposition that dance is the most repetitious, redundant, and formally organized system of body communication present in a culture...  The dance is composed of those gestures, postures, movements, and movement qualities most characteristic and most essential to the activity of everyday, and thus crucial to cultural continuity. By treating these elements redundantly and formally, dance becomes an effective organizer of joint motor activity. Dance supplies the metronome to meter and regulates, or orders the energy and attention of groups of people, and thereby acquires the weight of general community approval. Thus dance functions to establish and renew consensus at moments when a society, without further discussion or explanation, is ready to act in concert.&lt;ref&gt;Lomax et al. (1968) p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bartenieff believed that dance (particularly traditional dance) was uniquely suited to Lomax's type of analysis, since movement is "not only a medium of expression but also the essence of communication. Although all dancers feel intuitively that movement communicates across culture barriers, she wrote, there have hitherto been no means for describing dance patterns so that they could be consistently compared cross-culturally: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The task on which we collaborated with Mr. Lomax was to adapt the Laban system to the problem of comparison of movement styles cross-culturally so that the main style families would emerge from the study of this visually perceived behavior on film, as in Cantometrics they had been found by study of aurally perceived behavior." &lt;ref&gt;Irmgard Bartenieff, "Research in Anthropology: A Study of Dance Styles in Primitive Cultures", Cord Dance Research Annual I (1967).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Films==

A series of short documentary films demonstrated some of  the results of the team's statistical analysis in dramatic visual terms.&lt;ref&gt;A book that Lomax and Paulay wrote about their findings remains in manuscript.&lt;/ref&gt; These were: ''Dance &amp; Human History'' (1974) (40 min.), which examined two important parameters in the Choreometric study, the dominant trace form of the movement and single/multiple articulation of the torso and relates them to geography and type of society; ''Palm Play'' (1977) (27 min.), which examines the use of the palm in dance cross culturally; ''Step Style'' (1977) (30 min.), which examines the use of the foot in dance cross culturally;&lt;ref&gt;An excerpt from Lomax's film ''Step Style'' appeared in the online edition of the [http://video.nytimes.com/video/2012/01/30/arts/music/100000001322535/the-lomax-archives.html New York Times of January 31, 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Longest Trail'' (1984) (59 min.), which uses Choreometric data as evidence that the Americas were populated by Siberian hunters. In 2009 all four films were included on the DVD ''Rhythms of Earth: The Choreometrics Films of Alan Lomax and Forrestine Paulay'' produced by John Melville Bishop (Media-Generation, 1974–2008), which included old and new interviews with the original participants of the study.&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Welsch, in his 2009 review of the DVD in [http://www.media-generation.com/Articles/RhythmsVA.pdf, ''Visual Anthropology'', 22:241-242, 2009.]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, cautioned that the films, some of them over 35 years old, now appear dated and warned that the late [[Robert Gardner (anthropologist)|Robert Gardner]], in one of the DVD's special features, was shown chain smoking, nevertheless he judged that students in introductory courses would find the material "dazzling" and pronounced the DVD "must-see for more advanced courses in expressive culture, visual anthropology, and any course involving ethnographic film."&lt;/ref&gt; Improvisational jazz musician and composer [[Roswell Rudd]] later collaborated with Lomax and Paulay on an unpublished study called the Urban Strain that used Cantometric and Choreometric analysis to study commercially produced twentieth-century American popular music and dance.

==Criticisms and responses==
The reaction of musicologists to Cantometrics was complex, as some critics questioned whether one could ever have enough statistics to prove anything about music and culture. One, Richard Middleton, called it an example of sociological [[homology (sociology)|homology]].

The musical examples for Cantometrics had not been chosen randomly, however, but for their representativeness, following the scholarly guidance of specialists who had studied the regions and /or supplied the audio or film clip samples. This was done because it was found that style tends to be very repetitive, and in most instances relatively few examples captured the stable performance norms, so that in most cases, coding many examples per culture yielded little new information. Lomax and Grauer settled on about ten examples per culture for Cantometrics, which had the largest dataset. Ten examples per culture usually sufficed, although for some cultures one or more sub-styles needed to be sampled as well. 

Alan Lomax himself stressed repeatedly that completeness of sampling was not the point:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The adequacy of any of these samples is . . . subject to this test: Will another sample of a similar kind taken in the same culture produce a similar performance profile? From this point of view, I believe that the majority of our samples will hold up. Even "secret" songs generally tend to be stylistically close to the more familiar music of a culture. The truth is that, with any one culture or subculture, singing is a rather standardized kind of behavior. It must be so since a main function of song is to . . . permit groups of performers to vocalize together and their listeners to share in a common experience. Cantometrics is a study of these standardized models, which describe singing rather than songs. Therefore, it is not primarily concerned with "complete" collections and descriptions, as are most scholarly endeavors, but with locating verifiable regularities and patterns. (Lomax [1968] 2000).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Victor Grauer noted that: “Cantometrics is a statistical method.  Its patterns and correlations are based on multiple instances, not just one.  There will always be exceptions, which is why statistical methods are generally preferable for comparative studies than the close examination of individual examples.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mustrad.org.uk/articles/cantome2.htm Victor Grauer, "Song and Social Culture, A Response",  ''Musical Traditions'' web magazine, July 27, 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cantometrics as an educational tool==
The Cantometrics team also created a set of teaching tapes that make it easy to develop an understanding of world music and to create new song profiles. “Cantometrics helps you to break music down into its parts,” Roswell Rudd told Gideon D’Arcangelo. “You want to know how it’s put together and then you want to know where the parts came from. The Cantometrics teaching tapes are the best thing anybody can use who wants to understand world music, classical music, pop music, whatever. That teaching kit teaches you about the qualities of music – any kind of music from any culture.”&lt;ref&gt;Roswell Rudd, quoted in Gideon D’Arcangelo (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; 
Alan Lomax foresaw that computers would be an ideal way to make Cantometrics analysis available not just to scholars but to people of all ages and educational backgrounds, particularly school children. With that end in view, during the 1990s he developed The Global Jukebox, an interactive multi-media computer program designed for classrooms, museums, and libraries to visually and aurally map the world's song and dance cultures, incidentally helping people understand their own roots and those of others, while teaching geography, anthropology, and tolerance through song and dance.&lt;ref&gt;Some have likened The Global Jukebox to [[Pandora (radio)|Pandora]], see for example the / interview of Don Fleming by reporter [[John Hockenberry]] on the [[Public Radio International]] [http://www.thetakeaway.org/2012/jan/31/the-global-jukeboxs-premiere  program] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202124514/http://www.thetakeaway.org/2012/jan/31/the-global-jukeboxs-premiere |date=February 2, 2012 }}, [[The Takeaway (radio)|The Takeaway.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Since Alan Lomax's death in 2002, The Association for Cultural Equity, which Lomax founded, has been working to update the program, and make it widely available. In fulfillment of this project, as of March 2012 all the recordings of his Archive will be streamed online.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/31/arts/music/the-alan-lomax-collection-from-the-american-folklife-center.html?pagewanted=all  Larry Rohter, "Folklorist’s Global Jukebox Goes Digital", ''New York Times'' (January 31, 2019)]&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Cartmanland'''" is the sixth episode of the [[South Park (season 5)|fifth season]] of the animated television series ''[[South Park]]'', and the 71st episode of the series overall. "Cartmanland" originally aired in the [[United States]] on July 25, 2001 on [[Comedy Central]].

In the episode, Cartman inherits one million dollars from his grandmother. He uses it to purchase his own amusement park, named "Cartmanland". The resulting success causes Kyle to have a hemorrhoid and lose his faith in God. However, Kyle later regains his faith in God when Cartman loses his theme park and owes $13,000 back in taxes. 

==Plot==

[[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]'s grandmother, Mabel Louise Cartman passes away and leaves Cartman one million dollars in inheritance. Rather than invest the money or donate it to good will, Cartman instead uses the money to purchase North Park Funland, an [[amusement park]] owned by Frank Fun. Signing off the deeds, Frank however clears his conscience with Cartman, revealing that Funland has been a financial failure. Cartman reassures him that he only intends to open the park for himself, expressing his disdain for park lines. Frank agrees to sell, and the park is renamed Cartmanland.

Meanwhile, [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] upon learning of Cartman's success starts to question his faith in God, and how someone as horrid as Cartman could be so fortunate and happy. To make matters worse, Kyle develops a [[hemorrhoid]] due to the stress of knowing Cartman's glee. He and Stan attempt to sneak into Cartmanland, defying Cartman's expulsion of any guests; especially them. Kyle's hemorrhoid pops whilst climbing over the fence into the park and are then found by Cartman who angrily sends them away. The hemorrhoid becomes infected, worsening Kyle's state and being the final straw to fully lose faith in God. Desperate to rekindle hope in Kyle, his parents attempt to cheer him up by telling the story of [[Book of Job|Job]], but they truncate the story with Job getting boils and never mentioning the end where Job regains his good fortune for believing in God despite everything going wrong in his life. The plan backfires however, as Kyle is horrified that God would allow such a devout believer in him to suffer so greatly just to win a bet with [[Satan]].

Cartman hires a single [[security guard]] to stop further trespassing into his park. But with his inheritance dried up, the guard refuses to work unless he is afforded a viable salary; pointing out that if Cartman lets in two people to the park per day, he could easily pay for his employment. Eventually, one of the rides malfunctions thus forcing Cartman to let more guests in to pay for maintenance. Inevitably, expenses for maintenance, refreshments, utilities and security mount up causing more and more guests to be admitted into the park, which turns out to revive the park as a success at Cartman's disdain for queues. Business experts mistake Cartman's "you can't come" technique as a marketing ploy - which proves to be fatal for Kyle, who flat lines. With Cartmanland a thriving success and with record park guests, Cartman becomes infuriated and demands his money back from Mr. Fun. With the park back in Frank's ownership, the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] collects $500,000 in penalty fees from Cartman as he did not keep tax records of the park. The last $500,000 is taken in a lawsuit by [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny's]] parents after Kenny died on one of the rollercoasters. Now $13,000 in debt and completely broken, Cartman pleads to get the park back from Mr. Fun who ultimately refuses.

Upon hearing about the events, Stan hurries to the hospital as Kyle is now on the verge of dying. He pleads with the doctor to take Kyle out of the hospital to show him what is happening to Cartman. They arrive at the park to find Cartman throwing rocks at the walls in anger over having lost his fortune before being maced by the security guard he originally hired. Seeing Cartman's misery causes Kyle's hemorrhoid to miraculously shrink away and he makes a full recovery as he watches Cartman cry after having been pepper sprayed by his former security guard, and his faith in God is now restored.

==Production==
In the DVD commentary to this episode, Parker and Stone highlight it as another example (after "[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]") of the show's change in style towards simpler ideas which consisted only of an [[A-Plot]], with no [[subplot]], and "not try[ing] to do too many things at once". Parker mentions that they almost did not make the episode as they did not believe that there was enough going on in the episode, that it was too "basic and easy". Parker also said they were concerned that the story of Cartman inheriting a million dollars and buying a theme park was [[cliché]]. However, as it was the middle of the run and they had no other stories ready for production, they decided to run with the idea. Parker said he realised while they were making the episode that "as long as you have the basic easy cliché thing as the overall thing, then you can get into the scenes and have a lot of fun with scenes and get original in there."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video | people=[[Trey Parker|Parker, Trey]]|date = November 2002|title=South Park: The Complete Fifth Season: "Cartmanland " |format=Audio commentary |medium= DVD|publisher=[[Paramount Pictures#Paramount Home Entertainment|Paramount Home Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both this episode and "[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]" appear on ''The Cult of Cartman'' DVD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Cult of Cartman DVD Review |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=October 2, 2008 |last=Monfette |first=Christopher |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/10/02/the-cult-of-cartman-dvd-review |accessdate=January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The security guard whom Cartman hires and who uses pepper spray was previously the lead mall cop in the season four episode "[[Something You Can Do with Your Finger]]". He is also featured in the 2014 ''South Park'' video game ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth|The Stick of Truth]]'' as the first boss the player must face, guarding [[Token Black|Token Black’s]] mansion and using his pepper spray on the player character unless they wear a gas mask.

==Home release==
"Cartmanland", along with the fourteen other episodes from ''South Park: the Complete Fifth Season'', was released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on February 22, 2005. The sets included brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=South Park: The Complete Fifth Season DVD Review |publisher=Bullz-Eye |date=February 26, 2009 |last=Codding |first=Jamey  |url=http://www.bullz-eye.com/television_reviews/2001/south_park_5.htm |accessdate=April 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charlottenhof Palace''' or '''Charlottenhof Manor''' ({{lang-de|Schloss Charlottenhof}}) is a former royal palace located southwest of [[Sanssouci Palace]] in [[Sanssouci Park]] at [[Potsdam]], [[Germany]]. It is best known as the summer residence of Crown Prince Frederick William (later King [[Frederick William IV of Prussia]]). Today it is maintained by the [[Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation Berlin-Brandenburg]].

==Overview==
The park area with its various buildings can be traced back to the 18th century.  After it had changed hands several times, King [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] bought the land that borders the south of [[Sanssouci Park]] and gave it to his son Frederick William and his wife [[Elisabeth Ludovika of Bavaria|Elisabeth Ludovika]] for [[Christmas]] in 1825.

The Crown Prince charged the architect [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]] with the remodeling of an already existing farm house and the project was completed at low cost from 1826 through 1829. In the end, Schinkel, with the help of his student [[Ludwig Persius]], built a small [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] palace on the foundations of the old farm house in the image of a [[Roman villa]].

With designs he created himself the artistically inclined Crown Prince participated in the planning process for the palace and surrounding park.  He referred to this summer residence as "Siam", which at the time was considered "the Land of the Free", and to himself jokingly as the "Siam House architect".

Officially the palace and park were named "Charlottenhof" in honor of Maria Charlotte von Gentzkow who had owned the property from 1790 to 1794.

The interior design of the ten rooms is still largely intact. The furniture, for the most part designed by Schinkel himself, is remarkable for its simple and cultivated style.

The palace's most distinctive room is the tent room fashioned after a Roman Caesar's tent.  In the tent room both ceiling and walls are decorated with blue and white striped wallpaper and the window treatments and bed tent and coverings continue that design.  The room was used as a bedroom for companions and guests.

The blue and white theme is continued throughout on the palace's window shutters, it seems, in deference to the [[Bavaria]]n heritage of then crown princess Elisabeth.

Between 1835 and 1840 the explorer and world traveler [[Alexander von Humboldt]] was invited and stayed in the tent room during the summer months.

== Charlottenhof Park ==
The landscape architect [[Peter Joseph Lenné]] was charged with the design of the Charlottenhof gardens.

He completely recreated the originally flat and partly marshy area into an English garden with trees, lawn and water features. He also linked the new park at Charlottenhof to the older one at [[Sanssouci]] from the time of [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]].

==World Heritage Site==

Since 1990, Charlottenhof Palace has been part of the UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]] "[[Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin]]". The palace is administered by the ''[[Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation Berlin-Brandenburg|Stiftung Preußische Schlösser und Gärten Berlin-Brandenburg]]''.

'''''Child of Light''''' is a [[platform game|platforming]] [[role-playing video game]] developed by [[Ubisoft Montreal]] and published by [[Ubisoft]] for [[Microsoft Windows]], the [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Wii U]], [[Xbox 360]] and [[Xbox One]] in April 2014, and was released on [[PlayStation Vita]] in July 2014. The game was later released on [[Nintendo Switch]] on 11 October 2018; the announcement of this release also teased a sequel.&lt;ref name="Switch/sequel"&gt;{{cite web |last=Bankhurst |first=Adam |url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2018/08/08/child-of-light-on-switch-announcement-teases-child-of-light-2 |title=Child of Light on Switch Announcement Teases Child of Light 2 |publisher=[[IGN]]|date=August 8, 2018 |accessdate=August 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is powered by [[UbiArt Framework]].

The game's story takes place in the fictional land of [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]]. Aurora, a child who wakes up in Lemuria after dying from a mysterious illness, must bring back the sun, the moon, and the stars held captive by the Queen of the Night in order to return home.

==Gameplay==
''Child of Light''{{'}}s gameplay is described as having attributes of a [[side-scroller]] with [[Role-playing video game|role-playing]] elements such as leveling up to increase stats over time.&lt;ref name=gamespot/&gt; Battles with enemies use a system similar to the active-time battle system found in games like the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series and the ''[[Grandia (series)|Grandia]]'' series.&lt;ref name=ign&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sliva|first1=Marty|last2=Goldfarb|first2=Andrew|lastauthoramp=yes|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/09/10/why-we-love-ubisofts-child-of-light|title=Why We Love Ubisoft's Child of Light |publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2013-09-10|accessdate=2013-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The player can control up to two characters during battle, and swap these two with waiting characters. Up to three enemies can appear during battle. If the player approaches an enemy from behind, the battle becomes a "Surprise Strike", giving the player an advantage. If the enemy approaches the player from behind, it becomes an "Ambush", giving the enemy an advantage. The character Igniculus is used as an in-game mechanic outside of and during battle. The player can freely move Igniculus to open chests that Aurora cannot reach, as well as shine his light on an enemy to slow it down or on an ally to heal them.&lt;ref name=ign/&gt;

==Plot==
{{Long plot|date=August 2018}}
In 1895 [[Austria]],{{efn|The game's writer, [[Jeffrey Yohalem]], has stated that the specific Austrian location is the duchy [[Carniola]]—see [[#Development]] for more information.}} a princess named Aurora is born to a [[Duke]], who rules over a kingdom of five hills, and his beautiful, yet mysterious wife. After Aurora's mother apparently died, her father eventually remarried. On Easter Eve, Aurora falls mysteriously ill, her body freezes, and she seemingly dies in her sleep. As a result the Duke becomes bedridden, overcome with despair.

The player first takes control of Aurora after she awakens on an altar in the land of [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]]. She meets and befriends a [[firefly]] named Igniculus, who leads her to a sword that she uses to arm herself, and eventually a chamber where the Lady of the Forest is imprisoned. Upon freeing the Lady, Aurora is told of the history of Lemuria. Lemuria was once ruled by the Queen of Light until one night when she mysteriously vanished. From the darkness rose Umbra, Queen of the Night, who sent her daughters to steal Lemuria's light — the sun, the stars, and the moon. The Lady further reveals to Aurora that the two worlds are connected by a mirror that was stolen by Umbra. To be able to use the mirror to go home, Aurora must recover Lemuria's light. The Lady then gives Aurora advice, a flute, and the stars which she had, granting Aurora the ability to fly.

Along Aurora's quest, she is joined by Rubella, an Aerostati jester with a slight word pronunciation problem, who is searching for her brother Tristis; Finn, a young, rather timid Capilli whose village is beset by a curse cast by Umbra; Norah, Aurora's stepsister, who was pulled through the mirror to Lemuria; Robert, a Populi trader; and Rubella's brother Tristis. She further learns through a series of visions that her father's health is declining and a nearby dam has burst, flooding the area. The people of his kingdom seek his leadership to resolve the crisis, but his combined despair and failing health render him unable to guide them.

The party eventually locates the mirror back to Aurora's world at the Temple of the Moon. Upon crossing, Aurora is immediately confronted by her stepmother and other stepsister Cordelia. Norah reveals that she led Aurora into a trap; her mother and Aurora's stepmother is in fact Umbra herself, and Norah and Cordelia are Nox and Crepusculum, the daughters Umbra sent to steal Lemuria's sun and moon. Aurora further learns that Umbra's arch-enemy, the Queen of Light, is in fact Aurora's mother. Umbra attempts to kill Aurora, but Aurora's false crown&amp;mdash;a gift from her father&amp;mdash;shields her from harm. Aurora is thrown into prison and left to die.

While imprisoned, Aurora has a vision of her mother, who is revealed to have transported her to Lemuria in order to protect her from Umbra. Upon awakening she is joined by Óengus, a Kategida who was exiled when he pledged himself to Umbra in exchange for his clan's lives. The two free the party, but upon leaving the tower they are confronted by Crepusculum; Aurora defeats her and retrieves the moon, causing her to change from a child into a grown woman. She and her friends head to the Cynbel Sea seeking the sun. They are joined by Genovefa, a young sorceress of the Piscean Village, and one of the last of her kind.

After making her way through the Palace of the Sun, Aurora confronts and defeats Nox, regaining the sun. Umbra promptly arrives, enraged at the death of her daughters, but offers Aurora the chance to reunite with her father in exchange for the moon and the stars. Unable to abandon the Lemurians to their fate, Aurora reluctantly tells her father through the portal she cannot return to him, leading to his death. With the Duke dead, the fake crown protecting Aurora disappears, leaving her vulnerable to Umbra's magic. Severely injured from the attacks, Aurora crawls her way to escape with the sun.

Igniculus, with the help of his firefly friends, carries Aurora to the altar where she first woke in Lemuria. Beside the altar is the Lady of the Forest, who reveals herself to be the Queen of Light. She revives Aurora with the aid of all the Lemurians Aurora helped throughout her journey. With Aurora's renewed powers, she quickly flies the party up into the sky to Umbra's castle, and together, they defeat Umbra.

Through one last vision, Aurora learns that the flood is worsening. With the help of all her Lemurian friends, she goes through the mirror to her world, arriving on Easter Sunday, and rescues the people of the Duke's kingdom from the flood by leading them back through the mirror to Lemuria.

==Development==
Initially revealed at [[Game Developers Conference|GDC Europe 2013]] by creative director Patrick Plourde, ''Child of Light'' is said to be inspired by [[Studio Ghibli]] and [[Yoshitaka Amano]] in its art style, and in presentation similar to games like ''Vagrant Story'', ''Final Fantasy VIII'' and ''[[Limbo (video game)|Limbo]]''.&lt;ref name=gamespot&gt;{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Peter|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-unveils-final-fantasy-and-limbo-inspired-child-of-light/1100-6413150/|title=Ubisoft unveils Final Fantasy and Limbo inspired Child of Light |publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=2013-08-19|accessdate=2013-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; During development, the writer was [[Jeffrey Yohalem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Being gay in the world of gaming|url=http://www.gaytimes.co.uk/culture/20682/jeffrey-yohalem-child-of-light/|accessdate=June 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lead programmer was Brie Code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lead Programmer Brie Code|url=http://childoflight.ubi.com/col/en-US/news/news_details.aspx?c=tcm:152-142150-16&amp;ct=tcm:148-76770-32|website=Child of Light|publisher=Ubisoft|accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game is narrated by Canadian actress [[Caroline Dhavernas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Rollus |first=Thomas |url= https://www.behance.net/gallery/16530309/Child-of-Light-Cutscene |title= UChild of Light {{!}} Cutscene |publisher=[[Behance]]|date=2014-05-01|accessdate=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Narrative===
During development, the character of Aurora was going to grow physically throughout the game, ageing from 5 to 10, to 15, and to finish around 20 years old; this plot device was likened to an evolution of the character in how her relationships with others and her perspective on life changed, and would mirror the gameplay's [[JRPG|RPG mechanics]], starting off weak and leveling up. The game would also have had multiple endings, where "the player [would] decide what ending they want". Ultimately, Aurora only ages physically once in the game and there is just one ending. Plourde and Yohalem also discussed the concept of a [[Prince Charming]] in the narrative, and how they wanted Aurora to be a strong female character who did not rely on a man or fall in love at the end of the story. Yohalem particularly expressed how love is an "easy way out" for a writer. The narrative instead focuses on growing up in the modern world, sacrificing time to help others, becoming an adult, and how one does that by themselves.&lt;ref name="RPS 1"&gt;{{cite web |last=Grayson |first=Nathan |title=Child Of Light Devs On Poetry, Female Characters |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/09/13/child-of-light-devs-on-poetry-female-characters/ |publisher=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |date=September 13, 2013 |accessdate=August 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A final level based in the sky and set after defeating Nox but before fighting Umbra was originally planned but did not make it into the final version of the game; the level revolved entirely around gameplay and no story was removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Disamistade comments on I am Jeffrey Yohalem, the writer of Child of Light. Ready to AMA! |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24t9ht/i_am_jeffrey_yohalem_the_writer_of_child_of_light/chagmc4/ |publisher=[[Reddit]] |date=May 5, 2014 |accessdate=August 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though fictional, several aspects of the game are based on reality. Though not explicitly stated in-game, Aurora's [[duchy]] in Austria is located in [[Carniola]]. An [[1895 Ljubljana earthquake|earthquake that hit the capital of Carniola on Easter Sunday in 1895]] is adapted into the game's story, where it causes a nearby dam to burst and the capital to be flooded. Similarly, the land of Lemuria that the player explores throughout the game is based on a [[Lemuria (continent)|supposedly lost continent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Farokhmanesh |first=Megan |title=Child of Light's fantasy is based on some historic realities |url=https://www.polygon.com/2014/5/2/5676014/child-of-light-real-world-influences |publisher=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |date=May 2, 2014 |accessdate=August 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presentation===
The game was designed using the [[UbiArt Framework]] engine, which had previously been used to design ''[[Rayman Origins]]'' and ''[[Rayman Legends]]''. The engine allowed the design team to input concept art directly into the game, giving the game the look of an animated painting and the feel of progressing in an illustration. The team focused on creating a watercolor effect to give the impression of "being awake in an underwater dream".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Making of Child of Light - Part 1 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PCSB9XPWVE |website=YouTube |publisher=Ubisoft |date=March 18, 2014 |accessdate=August 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After some of the staff had their children successfully draw Aurora based on the brief description of her being a princess with long red hair and an oversized crown, they knew they had created an iconic character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Making of Child of Light - Part 3 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1aT-fsytVg |website=YouTube |publisher=Ubisoft |date=April 24, 2014 |accessdate=August 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Child of Light'' takes inspiration from many poems, with Plourde describing it as "a playable poem";&lt;ref name="USGamer" /&gt; the majority of the game's dialogue is portrayed through [[rhyme]] delivered in [[ballad form]], in which each four-line stanza sees the second and fourth lines end with rhyming words. Variable iambic syllable counts were used for flexibility, with Yohalem explaining its use to justify varying line lengths and word pairings that don't always perfectly match up. Collectibles in the game called Confessions—secret letters that the player can find floating in the wind and pick up—are delivered in the form of [[sonnet]]s. Yohalem believes the most difficult challenge he faced while writing for the game was keeping each character's voice distinct from one another despite them sharing the same cadence while rhyming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Steinman |first=Gary |title=Child of Light – Poetry in Motion |url=http://blog.ubi.com/en-GB/child-light-poetry-motion/ |website=blog.ubi.com |publisher=Ubisoft |date=May 6, 2014 |accessdate=August 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yohalem attributes the fairy tale culture of the game to ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]'' and also looked to using ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'' as a thematic element.&lt;ref name="RPS 1" /&gt;

Plourde states that the art was inspired by illustrators such as [[Arthur Rackham]], [[John Bauer (illustrator)|John Bauer]], and [[Edmund Dulac]],&lt;ref name="RPS 1" /&gt; as well as the art of Yoshitaka Amano, with whom they partnered in designing some of the characters and in the production of a ''Child of Light'' painting. The painting was distributed as a European-exclusive poster that came with the deluxe editions of the game on PC, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hansen |first=Steven |title=Final Fantasy artist Yoshitaka Amano paints Child of Light art |url=https://www.destructoid.com/final-fantasy-artist-yoshitaka-amano-paints-child-of-light-art-272999.phtml |publisher=[[Destructoid]] |date=April 7, 2014 |accessdate=August 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ubisoft also partnered with [[Cirque du Soleil]] during the development of the game, who helped provide the game's theatrical feel and costume design.&lt;ref name="USGamer"&gt;{{cite web |last=Williams |first=Mike |title=Ubisoft Partners With Cirque du Soleil For Child of Light |url=https://www.usgamer.net/articles/ubisoft-partners-with-cirque-du-soleil-for-child-of-light |publisher=[[USGamer]] |date=April 9, 2014 |accessdate=August 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
The original soundtrack has 18 tracks and was composed by Béatrice Martin, also known as [[Cœur de pirate]], a Canadian singer and songwriter from the province of Québec. Martin worked with the Montreal-based Bratislava Symphony Orchestra in recording some of the songs. Plourde described her music as "fresh, romantic and optimistic", elements he wanted to express with ''Child of Light''.&lt;ref name="USGamer" /&gt;

Announced in October 2018, screenwriter Tasha Huo is writing a [[Television pilot|pilot]] for a television adaptation of ''Child of Light''; in an interview with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Huo stated that she was "a longtime fan of the game" and wanted to capture the theme of a strong female heroine in a fairy tale world in a live-action show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Crecente |first1=Brian |title=Ubisoft Working on ‘Child of Light,’ ‘Werewolves Within’ TV, Movie Adaptations |url=https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/child-of-light-werewolves-within-adaptations-1203015197/ |website=Variety |accessdate=October 31, 2018 |date=October 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2851">A '''comeback''', in terms of [[publicity]], is a return by a well-known person to the activity in which they initially obtained their fame. Comebacks can occur in all walks of life, and have been noted to occur in entertainment, sports, and politics.

A comeback may occur after a public figure has been forced to withdraw from the public eye due to a real or perceived scandal.

==Entertainment==
An entertainer may make a comeback after having been absent from their area of entertainment for a time.

In South Korea, [[Comeback (K-pop)]], talent agencies stage-manage the debut of new acts in order to create anticipation for the new act, which will often officially debut live on one of the main television music programs with a "debut stage". For the debut [[Single (music)|single]], acts will have an overall "[[gimmick|concept]]", a marketing hook, which influences the name of the act, clothes, choreography, catch phrases and how they are presented; within bands individual members will have a personal concept, this being a role that they will play within the band, e.g. leader, visual, maknae, rapper e.t.c. Once a rookie act's debut cycle has ended they enter their second promotional cycle with a "comeback", called as such even when the musician or group in question did not go on hiatus.&lt;ref name="ramstadwsj"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ramstad|first=Evan|title=Korea Counts Down Not Just To New Year, But to New Girls' Album|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2012/12/31/korea-counts-down-not-just-to-new-year-but-to-new-girls-album/|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=5 January 2013|quote=One of the unique things about album releases by K-pop artists is that they are routinely called 'comebacks' even when there's been no evidence that the musician or group went away or, in the conventional sports usage of the term, experienced a setback or loss.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each promotional cycle will be presented with its own concept.

==Sports==
{{distinguish|Comeback (sports)}}
In sports, a comeback occurs where an athlete or a team returns to success after a period of poor performance or inactivity. "The comeback may be the most compelling phenomenon in sports. ... Comebacks in individual sports like tennis, boxing, or golf occur more commonly than in team sports, as athletes in these games have more control over their destiny".&lt;ref&gt;Rick Swaine, ''Baseball's Comeback Players: Forty Major Leaguers Who Fell and Rose Again'' (2014), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
A politician may make a comeback after having left public life, either voluntarily or through loss of an election.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Shlomit Barnea, "Chronicles of the Comeback that Was and the One that Almost Was", in Asher Arian, Michal Shamir, ''The Elections in Israel 2009'' (2011), p. 146-147.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Voting}}
'''Electronic voting''' (also known as '''e-voting''') refers to [[voting]] using [[Electronics|electronic]] means to either aid or take care of the chores of casting and counting votes.

Depending on the particular implementation, e-voting may use standalone electronic [[voting machines]] (also called EVM) or computers connected to the Internet.  It may encompass a range of [[Internet]] services, from basic transmission of tabulated results to full-function online voting through common connectable household devices. The degree of [[automation]] may be limited to marking a paper ballot, or may be a comprehensive system of vote input, vote recording, data encryption and transmission to servers, and consolidation and tabulation of election results.

A worthy e-voting system must perform most of these tasks while complying with a set of standards established by regulatory bodies, and must also be capable to deal successfully with strong requirements associated with [[Computer security|security]], [[accuracy]], integrity, swiftness, [[privacy]], [[Electronic discovery|auditability]], [[accessibility]], [[Cost-effectiveness analysis|cost-effectiveness]], [[scalability]] and [[Ecology|ecological]] sustainability.

Electronic voting technology can include [[punched card]]s, [[optical scan voting system]]s and specialized voting kiosks (including self-contained [[#Direct-recording electronic (DRE) voting system|direct-recording electronic voting systems]], or DRE). It can also involve transmission of [[ballot]]s and votes via telephones, private [[computer network]]s, or the [[Internet]].

In general, two main types of e-voting can be identified:
* e-voting which is physically supervised by representatives of governmental or independent electoral authorities (e.g. electronic voting machines located at polling stations);
* remote e-voting via the Internet (also called i-voting) where the voter submits their votes electronically to the election authorities, from any location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://e-estonia.com/component/i-voting/|title=i-Voting|work=e-Estonia|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211005750/https://e-estonia.com/component/i-voting/|archivedate=2017-02-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nea.gov.ph/issuances/memorandum-to-ecs/category/41-2013?download=750%3Amemo-2013-006-comelec-resolution-no.-9597-promulgated-on-december-21_2012|title=Res. 9597 Philippines concerning grid power requirements for various needs including i-voting|author=|date=|website=nea.gov.ph|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702042632/http://www.nea.gov.ph/issuances/memorandum-to-ecs/category/41-2013?download=750%3Amemo-2013-006-comelec-resolution-no.-9597-promulgated-on-december-21_2012|archivedate=2013-07-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electoralpractice.ch/2014/02/switzerlands-new-legislation-on-internet-voting/#sthash.FoF0XF9m.i6VEjuJm.dpbs|title=Switzerland’s new legislation on internet voting|work=electoralpractice.ch|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402091803/http://www.electoralpractice.ch/2014/02/switzerlands-new-legislation-on-internet-voting/#sthash.FoF0XF9m.i6VEjuJm.dpbs|archivedate=2015-04-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buchsbaum|first=T.|title=E-voting: International developments and lessons learnt|journal=Proceedings of Electronic Voting in Europe Technology, Law, Politics and Society.

== Benefits ==
Electronic voting technology intends to speed the counting of ballots, reduce the cost of paying staff to count votes manually and can provide improved accessibility for disabled voters.

== Concerns ==
It has been demonstrated that as voting systems become more complex and include software, [[Election fraud#Tampering with electronic voting machines|different methods of election fraud]] become possible. Others also challenge the use of electronic voting from a theoretical point of view, arguing that humans are not equipped for verifying operations occurring within an electronic machine and that because people cannot verify these operations, the operations cannot be trusted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.hbarel.com/analysis/cyber/secure-e-voting-is-hard-to-get | title=Why secure e-voting is so hard to get | author=Hagai Bar-El | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912070825/https://www.hbarel.com/analysis/cyber/secure-e-voting-is-hard-to-get | archivedate=2015-09-12 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, some computing experts have argued for the broader notion that people cannot trust any programming they did not author.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Ken (August 1984) [https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=358210 Reflections on Trusting Trust]&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of electronic voting, including security analyst [[Bruce Schneier]], note that "computer security experts are unanimous on what to do (some voting experts disagree, but it is the computer security experts who need to be listened to; the problems here are with the computer, not with the fact that the computer is being used in a voting application)... DRE machines must have a voter-verifiable paper audit trails... Software used on DRE machines must be open to public scrutiny"&lt;ref&gt;Schneier, Bruce (September 2004), [http://www.opendemocracy.net/ openDemocracy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609085245/http://opendemocracy.net/ |date=2007-06-09 }} [http://www.opendemocracy.net/media-voting/article_2213.jsp What’s wrong with electronic voting machines?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522033511/http://www.opendemocracy.net/media-voting/article_2213.jsp |date=2008-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to ensure the accuracy of the voting system.  Verifiable ballots are necessary because computers can and do malfunction, and because voting machines can be compromised.

Many insecurities have been found in commercial voting machines, such as using a default administration password.&lt;ref name="An Incredibly Insecure Voting Machine"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schneier|first1=Bruce|title=An Incredibly Insecure Voting Machine|url=https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2015/04/an_incredibly_i.html|website=Schneier on Security|accessdate=3 December 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208112521/https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2015/04/an_incredibly_i.html|archivedate=8 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feldman, Halterman &amp; Felten"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Feldman, Halterman &amp; Felten|title=Security Analysis of the Diebold AccuVote-TS Voting Machine|url=http://usenix.org/legacy/event/evt07/tech/full_papers/feldman/feldman_html/index.html|website=[[Usenix]]|accessdate=3 December 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208094204/http://usenix.org/legacy/event/evt07/tech/full_papers/feldman/feldman_html/index.html|archivedate=8 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cases have also been reported of machines making unpredictable, inconsistent errors. Key issues with electronic voting are therefore the openness of a system to public examination from outside experts, the creation of an authenticatable [[Voter-verified paper audit trail|paper record]] of votes cast and a chain of custody for records.&lt;ref name="What's Wrong With Electronic Voting Machines?"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schneier|first1=Bruce|title=What's Wrong With Electronic Voting Machines?|url=https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2004/11/whats_wrong_with_ele.html|website=Schneier on Security|accessdate=3 December 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208155348/https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2004/11/whats_wrong_with_ele.html|archivedate=8 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wichita State mathematician says Kansas voting machines need to be audited to check accuracy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wichita State mathematician says Kansas voting machines need to be audited to check accuracy|url=http://cjonline.com/news/2015-07-20/wichita-state-mathematician-says-kansas-voting-machines-need-be-audited-check|website=Topeka Capital-Journal|accessdate=3 December 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20151203222538/http://cjonline.com/news/2015-07-20/wichita-state-mathematician-says-kansas-voting-machines-need-be-audited-check|archivedate=3 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been contention, especially in the United States, that electronic voting, especially DRE voting, could facilitate [[electoral fraud]] and may not be fully auditable. In addition, electronic voting has been criticised as unnecessary and expensive to introduce. While countries like [[India]] continue to use electronic voting, several countries have cancelled e-voting systems or decided against a large-scale rollout, notably the [[Netherlands]], [[Ireland]], [[Germany]] and the [[United Kingdom]] due to issues in reliability of EVMs.&lt;ref name="Why electronic voting isn't secure"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kobie|first1=Nicole|title=Why electronic voting isn't secure|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/30/why-electronic-voting-is-not-secure|website=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=3 December 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208073412/http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/30/why-electronic-voting-is-not-secure|archivedate=8 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Should Britain introduce electronic voting?"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hern|first1=Alex|title=Should Britain introduce electronic voting?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/26/should-britain-introduce-electronic-voting|website=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=3 December 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208080136/http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/26/should-britain-introduce-electronic-voting|archivedate=8 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of system==
Electronic voting systems for electorates have been in use since the 1960s&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; when [[#Punch card voting|punched card]] systems debuted. Their first widespread use was in the USA where 7 counties switched to this method for the 1964 presidential election.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Saltman, Roy.[http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/NBS_SP_500-30.pdf EFFECTIVE USE OF COMPUTING TECHNOLOGY IN VOTE-TALLYING] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20160211104652/http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/NBS_SP_500-30.pdf |date=2016-02-11 }}. ''NIST''.&lt;/ref&gt; The newer [[optical scan voting system]]s allow a computer to count a voter's mark on a ballot. [[DRE voting machine]]s which collect and tabulate votes in a single machine, are used by all voters in all elections in [[Brazil]] and [[Indian voting machines|India]], and also on a large scale in [[Venezuela]] and the United States. They have been used on a large scale in the [[Netherlands]] but have been decommissioned after public concerns.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Internet voting systems have gained popularity and have been used for government elections and referendums in [[Estonia]], and Switzerland&lt;ref name="Serdült"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Serdült|first=U.|title=Fifteen Years of Internet Voting in Switzerland: History, Governance and Use|journal=IEEE Xplore CFP1527Y-PRT|date=April 2015|pages=126–132|doi=10.1109/ICEDEG.2015.7114487|isbn=978-3-9075-8910-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as municipal elections in Canada and party primary elections in the United States and France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vote.caltech.edu/events/2007/VendorWkshp/Backert-Handout.pdf |title=Event List |work=caltech.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304050731/http://www.vote.caltech.edu/events/2007/VendorWkshp/Backert-Handout.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also hybrid systems that include an electronic ballot marking device (usually a touch screen system similar to a DRE) or other [[assistive technology]] to print a [[voter verified paper audit trail]], then use a separate machine for electronic tabulation.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

===Paper-based electronic voting system===
[[File:ES&amp;S M100 Automark cart.jpg|thumb|A cart holding an [[ES&amp;S]] M100 [[optical scan voting system|ballot scanner]] and an AutoMARK [[assistive device]], as used in [[Johnson County, Iowa]], [[United States]] in 2010.]]
Sometimes called a "[[Voting machine#Document ballot voting system|document ballot voting system]]", paper-based voting systems originated as a system where votes are cast and [[Vote counting system#Manual counting|counted by hand]], using paper ballots. With the advent of [[Vote counting system#Electromechanical and Optical scan counting|electronic tabulation]] came systems where paper cards or sheets could be marked by hand, but counted electronically. These systems included [[Voting machine#Punch card|punched card voting]], [[optical scan voting system#Marksense systems|marksense]] and later [[optical scan voting system#Digital pen voting systems|digital pen voting systems]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

These systems can include a [[ballot marking device]] or electronic ballot marker that allows voters to make their selections using an [[Voting machine#With electronic input device|electronic input device]], usually a [[touch screen]] system similar to a DRE. Systems including a ballot marking device can incorporate different forms of [[assistive technology]]. In 2004, Open Voting Consortium demonstrated the 'Dechert Design', a [[General Public License]] [[open source]] paper ballot printing system with open source [[bar codes]] on each ballot.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

===Direct-recording electronic (DRE) voting system===
{{main|DRE voting machine}}
[[Image:Urna eletrônica.jpeg|thumb|left|Electronic voting machine by [[Premier Election Solutions]] (formerly Diebold Election Systems) used in all [[Brazil]]ian elections and plebiscites. Photo by Agência Brasil]]

A direct-recording electronic (DRE) [[voting machine]] records votes by means of a [[ballot]] display provided with mechanical or electro-optical components that can be activated by the voter (typically buttons or a [[touchscreen]]); that processes data with computer software; and that records voting data and ballot images in [[computer memory|memory components]]. After the election it produces a tabulation of the voting data stored in a removable memory component and as a printed copy. The system may also provide a means for transmitting individual ballots or vote totals to a central location for consolidating and reporting results from precincts at the central location. These systems use a precinct count method that tabulates ballots at the polling place. They typically tabulate ballots as they are cast and print the results after the close of polling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=U.S. Election Assistance Commission |authorlink=Election Assistance Commission |url=http://www.eac.gov/voting%20systems/docs/vvsgvolumei.pdf/attachment_download/file |title=2005 Voluntary Voting System Guidelines |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207185930/http://www.eac.gov/voting%20systems/docs/vvsgvolumei.pdf/attachment_download/file |archivedate=February 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, in the United States, the [[Help America Vote Act]] mandated that one handicapped accessible voting system be provided per polling place, which most jurisdictions have chosen to satisfy with the use of DRE voting machines, some switching entirely over to DRE. In 2004, 28.9% of the registered voters in the United States used some type of direct recording electronic voting system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kidsvotingoh.org/insidefiles/activities/Voting%20Systems%20Handout-3copy.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223230616/http://www.kidsvotingoh.org/insidefiles/activities/Voting%20Systems%20Handout-3copy.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-12-23 |title=A Short History of Voting in the United States |author=Kids Voting Central Ohio }}&lt;/ref&gt; up from 7.7% in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = U.S. Federal Election Commission | authorlink = Federal Election Commission | url = http://www.fec.gov/pages/dre.htm | title = Direct Recording Electronic information page | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071114022451/http://www.fec.gov/pages/dre.htm | archivedate = 2007-11-14 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Electronicvotingmachinewithbucu.jpg|right|thumb|Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) used in India]]
In 2004, India adopted [[Indian voting machines|Electronic Voting Machines]] (EVM) for its elections to its parliament with 380 million voters casting their ballots using more than one million voting machines.&lt;ref name="pib.nic.in"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pib.nic.in/elections2009/volume1/Chap-39.pdf |title=Know Your Electronic Voting Machine |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-09-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605194131/http://pib.nic.in/elections2009/volume1/Chap-39.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian EVMs are designed and developed by two government-owned defence equipment manufacturing units, [[Bharat Electronics Limited]] (BEL) and [[Electronics Corporation of India|Electronics Corporation of India Limited]] (ECIL). Both systems are identical, and are developed to the specifications of [[Election Commission of India]]. The system is a set of two devices running on 7.5 volt batteries. One device, the voting Unit is used by the voter, and another device called the control unit is operated by the electoral officer. Both units are connected by a five-metre cable. The voting unit has a blue button for each candidate. The unit can hold 16 candidates, but up to four units can be chained, to accommodate 64 candidates. The control unit has three buttons on the surface – one button to release a single vote, one button to see the total number of votes cast till now, and one button to close the election process. The result button is hidden and sealed. It cannot be pressed unless the close button has already been pressed. A controversy was raised when the voting machine malfunctioned which was shown in parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.manoramaonline.com/news/just-in/2017/05/09/aam-aadmi-party-live-applause-in-delhi-assembly-as-aap-mla-proves-evm-tampering.html|title=Aam Aadmi Party "proved" in voting machines in the assembly|work=ManoramaOnline|access-date=2017-12-19|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222052215/http://www.manoramaonline.com/news/just-in/2017/05/09/aam-aadmi-party-live-applause-in-delhi-assembly-as-aap-mla-proves-evm-tampering.html|archivedate=2017-12-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public network DRE voting system===
A public network DRE voting system is an election system that uses electronic ballots and transmits vote data from the polling place to another location over a public network. Vote data may be transmitted as individual ballots as they are cast, periodically as batches of ballots throughout the election day, or as one batch at the close of voting. This includes Internet voting as well as telephone voting.

Public network DRE voting system can utilize either precinct count or central count method. The central count method tabulates ballots from multiple precincts at a central location.

Internet voting can use remote locations (voting from any Internet capable computer) or can use traditional polling locations with voting booths consisting of Internet connected voting systems.

Corporations and organizations routinely use Internet voting to elect officers and board members and for other proxy elections. Internet voting systems have been used privately in many modern nations and publicly in the United States, the [[United Kingdom|UK]], Switzerland and Estonia. In Switzerland, where it is already an established part of local referendums, voters get their passwords to access the ballot through the postal service. Most voters in Estonia can cast their vote in local and parliamentary elections, if they want to, via the Internet, as most of those on the electoral roll have access to an e-voting system, the largest run by any [[European Union]] country. It has been made possible because most Estonians carry a national identity card equipped with a computer-readable microchip and it is these cards which they use to get access to the online ballot. All a voter needs is a computer, an electronic card reader, their ID card and its PIN, and they can vote from anywhere in the world. [[Electronic voting in Estonia|Estonian e-votes]] can only be cast during the days of [[Advance poll|advance voting]]. On election day itself people have to go to polling stations and fill in a paper ballot.

==Online voting==
{{distinguish|Open access poll}}
In March 2000 the [[Electronic voting by country#2000 Arizona Democratic presidential primary Internet election|Arizona Democratic Party ran its Presidential Primary over the internet]] using the private company votation.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Arizona+Democratic+Party+Selects+Votation.com+to+Hold+World's+First...-a058272337|title=Arizona Democratic Party Selects Votation.com to Hold World's First Legally-Binding Public Election Over the Internet. - Free Online Library|website=www.thefreelibrary.com|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each registered member of the party received a [[personal identification number]] in the mail. These citizens had the option to either cast ballots at a designated location or over the internet from the comfort of their own home. Voters voting over the internet were required to insert their PIN and answer two personal questions. Once all the information is verified, they have the voting options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/opinion/e1346.htm|title=How online voting works|work=usatoday.com|date=10 March 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2009, [[Electronic voting in Estonia|Estonia]] had advanced the farthest in utilizing Internet voting technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alvarez|first=R. Michael|last2=Hall|first2=Thad E.|last3=Trechsel|first3=Alexander H.|date=2009-07-01|title=Internet Voting in Comparative Perspective: The Case of Estonia|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ps-political-science-and-politics/article/internet-voting-in-comparative-perspective-the-case-of-estonia/8A8BCDACE0F361D1623D6F013025E624|journal=PS: Political Science &amp; Politics|volume=42|issue=3|pages=497–505|doi=10.1017/S1049096509090787|issn=1537-5935|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222112019/https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ps-political-science-and-politics/article/internet-voting-in-comparative-perspective-the-case-of-estonia/8A8BCDACE0F361D1623D6F013025E624|archivedate=2017-12-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Estonia, each voter has a national ID card that they use to identify each citizen. The ID card is the security Estonia put in to ensure reliability in votes. Security officials said that they have not detected any unusual activity or tampering of the votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/11/08/tech/web/online-voting/index.html|title=Why can't Americans vote online?|author=Doug Gross|date=8 November 2011|work=CNN|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304070919/http://www.cnn.com/2011/11/08/tech/web/online-voting/index.html|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impact on turnout ===
A 2017 study of online voting in two Swiss cantons found that it had no effect on turnout.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Germann|first=Micha|last2=Serdült|first2=Uwe|date=2017-06-01|title=Internet voting and turnout: Evidence from Switzerland|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026137941630453X|journal=Electoral Studies|volume=47|pages=1–12|doi=10.1016/j.electstud.2017.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A paper on “remote electronic voting and turnout in the Estonian 2007 parliamentary elections” showed that rather than eliminating inequalities, e-voting might have enhanced the [[digital divide]] between higher and lower socioeconomic classes. People who lived greater distances from polling areas voted at higher levels with this service now available. The 2007 Estonian elections yielded a higher voter turnout from those who lived in higher income regions and who received formal education.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bochsler|first=Daniel|date=May 26, 2010|title=Can Internet voting increase political participation?|url=http://www.eui.eu/Projects/EUDO-PublicOpinion/Documents/bochslere-voteeui2010.pdf|journal=Centre for the Study of Imperfection in Democracies|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918221247/http://www.eui.eu/Projects/EUDO-PublicOpinion/Documents/bochslere-voteeui2010.pdf|archivedate=September 18, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impact on election outcomes ===
The use of electronic voting in elections remains a contentious issue. Some countries such as Netherlands and Germany have stopped using it after it was shown to be unreliable, while the Indian Election commission recommends it. The involvement of numerous stakeholders including companies that manufacture these machines as well as political parties that stand to gain from rigging complicates this further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Constitutionality of Electronic Voting in Germany|url=https://www.ndi.org/e-voting-guide/examples/constitutionality-of-electronic-voting-germany|accessdate=31 May 2017|publisher=NDI - National Democratic Institute USA|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325021213/https://www.ndi.org/e-voting-guide/examples/constitutionality-of-electronic-voting-germany|archivedate=25 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 study of Brazil found no systematic difference in vote choices between online and offline electorates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mellon|first=Jonathan|last2=Peixoto|first2=Tiago|last3=Sjoberg|first3=Fredrik M|date=2017-06-01|title=Does online voting change the outcome? Evidence from a multi-mode public policy referendum|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261379417301014|journal=Electoral Studies|volume=47|pages=13–24|doi=10.1016/j.electstud.2017.02.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it has been also argued that the rigging of EVMs influenced the results of elections in India in 2017 to a large extent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mukunth|first1=Vasudevan|title=Ten Questions Worth Asking About EVM Tampering|url=https://thewire.in/133932/evm-aap-election-commission-tampering-evms/|accessdate=31 May 2017|publisher=The Wire|date=10 May 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170511182911/https://thewire.in/133932/evm-aap-election-commission-tampering-evms/|archivedate=11 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has further been argued political parties that have more support from the less fortunate—who are unfamiliar with the Internet—may suffer in the elections due to e-voting, which tends to increase voting in the upper/middle class. It is unsure as to whether narrowing the digital divide would promote equal voting opportunities for people across various social, economic and ethnic backgrounds. In the long run, this is contingent not only on internet accessibility, which is already widely available in Estonia, but also depends on people’s level of familiarity with the Internet.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The security of these in person electronic voting machines is almost entirely dependent on the implementation of security protocols at each locality. A group of researchers studying the recent Estonian elections describe massive operational lapses in security from transferring election results on personal thumb drives to posting network credentials on the wall in view of the public. The researchers concluded that these systems are insecure in their current implementation, and due to the rise of nation state interest in influencing elections, should be "discontinue[d]." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite study|last1=Springall|first1=Drew|last2=Finkenauer|first2=Travis|last3=Durumeric|first3=Zakir|last4=Kitcat|first4=Jason|last5=Hursti|first5=Harri|last6=MacAlpine|first6=Margaret|last7=Halderman|first7=Alex|title=Security Analysis of the Estonian Internet Voting System|access-date=3 December 2017|url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2660315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
[[Image:topvoter2.jpg|thumb|ISG TopVoter, a machine designed specifically to be used by voters with disabilities.]]
Electronic voting systems may offer advantages compared to other voting techniques. An electronic voting system can be involved in any one of a number of steps in the setup, distributing, voting, collecting, and counting of ballots, and thus may or may not introduce advantages into any of these steps. Potential disadvantages exist as well including the potential for flaws or weakness in any electronic component.

Charles Stewart of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] estimates that 1 million more ballots were counted in the 2004 USA presidential election than in 2000 because electronic voting machines detected votes that paper-based machines would have missed.&lt;ref&gt;Friel, Brian (November 2006)[http://nationaljournal.com/njcover.htm Let The Recounts Begin], [[National Journal]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050619003932/http://nationaljournal.com/njcover.htm |date=June 19, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2004 the U.S. [[Government Accountability Office]] released a report titled "Electronic Voting Offers Opportunities and Presents Challenges",&lt;ref&gt;Government Accountability Office (May 2004) "[http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d04766t.pdf Electronic Voting Offers Opportunities and Presents Challenges] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303172057/http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d04766t.pdf |date=2016-03-03 }}"&lt;/ref&gt; analyzing both the benefits and concerns created by electronic voting. A second report was released in September 2005 detailing some of the concerns with electronic voting, and ongoing improvements, titled "Federal Efforts to Improve Security and Reliability of Electronic Voting Systems Are Under Way, but Key Activities Need to Be Completed".&lt;ref&gt;Government Accountability Office (September 2005) "[http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d05956.pdf Federal Efforts to Improve Security and Reliability of Electronic Voting Systems Are Under Way, but Key Activities Need to Be Completed] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160209072826/http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d05956.pdf |date=2016-02-09 }}"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electronic ballots===
Electronic voting systems may use ''electronic ballot'' to store votes in [[computer memory]]. Systems which use them exclusively are called DRE voting systems. When electronic ballots are used there is no risk of exhausting the supply of ballots.  Additionally, these electronic ballots remove the need for printing of paper ballots, a significant cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electronicsewa.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 2, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120222242/http://electronicsewa.com/ |archivedate=November 20, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When administering elections in which ballots are offered in multiple languages (in some areas of the United States, public elections are required by the [[Voting Rights Act|National Voting Rights Act of 1965]]), electronic ballots can be programmed to provide ballots in multiple languages for a single machine.  The advantage with respect to ballots in different languages appears to be unique to electronic voting. For example, [[King County, Washington]]'s demographics require them under U.S. federal election law to provide ballot access in [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. With any type of paper ballot, the county has to decide how many Chinese-language ballots to print, how many to make available at each polling place, etc.  Any strategy that can assure that Chinese-language ballots will be available at all polling places is certain, at the very least, to result in a significant number of wasted ballots.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} (The situation with lever machines would be even worse than with paper: the only apparent way to reliably meet the need would be to set up a Chinese-language lever machine at each polling place, few of which would be used at all.)

Critics argue{{who|date=July 2016}} the need for extra ballots in any language can be mitigated by providing a process to print ballots at voting locations.  They argue further, the cost of software validation, compiler trust validation, installation validation, delivery validation and validation of other steps related to electronic voting is complex and expensive, thus electronic ballots are not guaranteed to be less costly than printed ballots.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

===Accessibility===
[[Image:Jellybuttons.jpg|thumb|A Hart eSlate DRE voting machine with jelly buttons for people with manual dexterity disabilities.]] Electronic voting machines can be made fully accessible for persons with disabilities. Punched card and optical scan machines are not fully accessible for the blind or visually impaired, and lever machines can be difficult for voters with limited mobility and strength.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.pfaw.org/pfaw/general/default.aspx?oid=14581 Protecting the Integrity and Accessibility of Voting in 2004 and Beyond]". ''[[People for the American Way]]'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041212172330/http://www.pfaw.org/pfaw/general/default.aspx?oid=14581 |date=December 12, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Electronic machines can use headphones, [[Sip-and-puff|sip and puff]], foot pedals, joy sticks and other [[adaptive technology]] to provide the necessary [[accessibility]].

Organizations such as the [[Verified Voting Foundation]] have criticized the accessibility of electronic voting machines&lt;ref&gt;[http://verifiedvotingfoundation.org/article.php?id=1875 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810071352/http://verifiedvotingfoundation.org/article.php?id=1875 |date=August 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and advocate alternatives. Some disabled voters (including the visually impaired) could use a [[tactile ballot]], a ballot system using physical markers to indicate where a mark should be made, to vote a secret paper ballot. These ballots can be designed identically to those used by other voters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electionaccess.org/Bp/Ballot_Templates.htm "Ballot Templates."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829073345/http://www.electionaccess.org/Bp/Ballot_Templates.htm |date=2012-08-29 }} (tactile ballots) ''[[International Foundation for Election Systems]]''&lt;/ref&gt; However, other disabled voters (including voters with dexterity disabilities) could be unable to use these ballots.

===Cryptographic verification===
The concept of election verifiability through cryptographic solutions has emerged in the academic literature to introduce transparency and trust in electronic voting systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Juels|first=Ari|author2=Dario Catalano|author3=Markus Jakobsson|title=Coercion-Resistant Electronic Elections|journal=Cryptology ePrint Archive|date=November 2002|issue=165|url=http://eprint.iacr.org/2002/165|accessdate=2 May 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407075829/http://eprint.iacr.org/2002/165|archivedate=7 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chaum|first=David |author2=Peter Y. A. Ryan |author3=Steve Schneider|title=A Practical Voter-Verifiable Election Scheme|journal=ESORICS'05: 10th European Symposium on Research in Computer Security|year=2005|volume=3679|series=LNCS|pages=118–139}}&lt;/ref&gt; It allows voters and election observers to verify that votes have been recorded, tallied and declared correctly, in a manner independent from the hardware and software running the election. Three aspects of verifiability are considered:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kremer|first=Steve |author2=Mark Ryan |author3=Ben Smyth|title=Election verifiability in electronic voting protocols|journal=ESORICS'10: 15th European Symposium on Research in Computer Security|year=2010|volume=6345|pages=389–404}}&lt;/ref&gt; individual, universal, and eligibility. Individual verifiability allows a voter to check that her own vote is included in the election outcome, universal verifiability allows voters or election observers to check that the election outcome corresponds to the votes cast, and eligibility verifiability allows voters and observers to check that each vote in the election outcome was cast by a uniquely registered voter.

===Voter intent===
Electronic voting machines are able to provide immediate feedback to the voter detecting such possible problems as [[undervote|undervoting]] and [[overvote|overvoting]] which may result in a [[spoiled ballot]]. This immediate feedback can be helpful in successfully determining [[voter intent]].

===Transparency===
It has been alleged by groups such as the UK-based [[Open Rights Group]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.openrightsgroup.org/2007/06/20/org-election-report-highlights-problems-with-voting-technology-used/ |title=ORG Election Report highlights problems with voting technology used |publisher=Openrightsgroup.org |accessdate=2010-05-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224024126/http://www.openrightsgroup.org/2007/06/20/org-election-report-highlights-problems-with-voting-technology-used/ |archivedate=2009-02-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openrightsgroup.org/2008/07/02/org-verdict-on-london-elections-insufficient-evidence-to-declare-confidence-in-results/|title=Open Rights Group - ORG verdict on London Elections: "Insufficient evidence" to declare confidence in results|work=Open Rights Group|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422003623/http://www.openrightsgroup.org/2008/07/02/org-verdict-on-london-elections-insufficient-evidence-to-declare-confidence-in-results/|archivedate=2009-04-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that a lack of testing, inadequate audit procedures, and insufficient attention given to system or process design with electronic voting leaves "elections open to error and [[electoral fraud|fraud]]".

In 2009, the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]] found that when using voting machines the "verification of the result must be possible by the citizen reliably and without any specialist knowledge of the subject." The [[DRE voting machine|DRE]] Nedap-computers used till then did not fulfill that requirement. The decision did not ban electronic voting as such, but requires all essential steps in elections to be subject to public examinability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/entscheidungen/rs20090303_2bvc000307en.html |title=Ruling of the Second Senate of the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany, 3 March 2009 |publisher=Bundesverfassungsgericht.de |accessdate=2010-05-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711062054/http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/entscheidungen/rs20090303_2bvc000307en.html |archivedate=11 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/pressemitteilungen/bvg09-019en.html |title=German Federal Constitutional Court, Press release no. 19/2009 of 3 March 2009 |publisher=Bundesverfassungsgericht.de |accessdate=2010-05-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404111620/http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/pressemitteilungen/bvg09-019en.html |archivedate=4 April 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, The [[California Association of Voting Officials]] was formed to maintain efforts toward publicly owned General Public License open source voting systems

===Coercion evidence===
In 2013, researchers from Europe proposed that the electronic voting systems should be coercion evident.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Gurchetan S Grewal, Mark D Ryan, Sergiu Bursuc, Peter Y A Ryan. Caveat Coercitor: coercion-evidence in electronic voting. 34th IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; There should be a public evidence of the amount of coercion that took place in a particular elections. An internet voting system called "[[Caveat Coercitor]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2013/papers/4977a367.pdf Caveat Coercitor: coercion-evidence in electronic voting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303233122/http://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2013/papers/4977a367.pdf |date=2016-03-03 }}, 2013 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy&lt;/ref&gt; shows how coercion evidence in voting systems can be achieved.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Audit trails===
{{further|Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail|End-to-end auditable voting systems}}

A fundamental challenge with any [[voting machine]] is produce evidence that the votes were recorded as cast and tabulated as recorded. Election results produced by voting systems that rely on voter-marked paper ballots can be verified with manual hand counts (either valid sampling or full recounts). [[Voting machine#Non-document ballot voting system|Non-document ballot voting systems]] must support auditability in different ways. An independently auditable system, sometimes called an Independent Verification, can be used in recounts or audits. These systems can include the ability for voters to verify how their votes were cast or enable officials to verify that votes were tabulated correctly.

A discussion draft argued by researchers at the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) states, "Simply put, the DRE architecture’s inability to provide for independent audits of its electronic records makes it a poor choice for an environment in which detecting errors and fraud is important."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vote.nist.gov/DraftWhitePaperOnSIinVVSG2007-20061120.pdf |title=Draft white paper on VVPR |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-05-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128025506/http://vote.nist.gov/DraftWhitePaperOnSIinVVSG2007-20061120.pdf |archivedate=November 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report does not represent the official position of NIST, and misinterpretations of the report has led NIST to explain that "Some statements in the report have been misinterpreted. The draft report includes statements from election officials, voting system vendors, computer scientists and other experts in the field about what is potentially possible in terms of attacks on DREs. However, these statements are not report conclusions."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/factsheet/draftvotingreport.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202222414/https://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/factsheet/draftvotingreport.htm |date=February 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Desi accuvote-tsx vvpat.jpg|thumb|A Diebold Election Systems, Inc. model AccuVote-TSx DRE voting machine with VVPAT attachment.]]

Various technologies can be used to assure DRE voters that their votes were cast correctly, and allow officials to detect possible fraud or malfunction, and to provide a means to audit the tabulated results. Some systems include technologies such as cryptography (visual or mathematical), paper (kept by the voter or verified and left with election officials), audio verification, and dual recording or witness systems (other than with paper).

Dr. [[Rebecca Mercuri]], the creator of the [[Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail]] (VVPAT) concept (as described in her Ph.D. dissertation in October 2000 on the basic voter verifiable ballot system), proposes to answer the auditability question by having the voting machine print a paper ballot or other paper facsimile that can be visually verified by the voter before being entered into a secure location. Subsequently, this is sometimes referred to as the "[[Mercuri method]]." To be truly ''voter''-verified, the record itself must be verified by the voter and able to be done without assistance, such as visually or audibly.  If the voter must use a bar-code scanner or other electronic device to verify, then the record is not truly voter-verifiable, since it is actually the electronic device that is verifying the record for the voter. VVPAT is the form of Independent Verification most commonly found in [[elections in the United States]] and other countries such as Venezuela.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ndi.org/e-voting-guide/examples/e-voting-audits-venezuela|title=E-voting Audits in Venezuela|last=apleasant|date=2013-11-25|website=www.ndi.org|language=en|access-date=2017-02-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214003900/https://www.ndi.org/e-voting-guide/examples/e-voting-audits-venezuela|archivedate=2017-02-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[End-to-end auditable voting systems]] can provide the voter with a receipt that can be taken home. This receipt does not allow voters to prove to others how they voted, but it does allow them to verify that the system detected their vote correctly. End-to-end (E2E) systems include [[Punchscan]], [[ThreeBallot]] and [[Prêt à Voter]]. [[Scantegrity]] is an add-on that extends current optical scan voting systems with an E2E layer. The city of [[Takoma Park, Maryland]] used [[Scantegrity II]] for its November, 2009 election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pilot Study of the Scantegrity II Voting System Planned for the 2009 Takoma Park City Election |url=http://www.takomaparkmd.gov/committees/boe/documents/flyer_workshop_I_(02-19-09).pdf |postscript= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719064407/http://www.takomaparkmd.gov/committees/boe/documents/flyer_workshop_I_%2802-19-09%29.pdf |archivedate=July 19, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Systems that allow the voter to prove how they voted are never used in U.S. public elections, and are outlawed by most state constitutions. The primary concerns with this solution are [[voter intimidation]] and [[vote selling]].

An audit system can be used in measured random recounts to detect possible malfunction or fraud. With the VVPAT method, the paper ballot is often treated as the official ballot of record. In this scenario, the ballot is primary and the electronic records are used only for an initial count. In any subsequent recounts or challenges, the paper, not the electronic ballot, would be used for tabulation. Whenever a paper record serves as the legal ballot, that system will be subject to the same benefits and concerns as any paper ballot system.

To successfully audit any voting machine, a strict [[chain of custody]] is required.

The solution was first demonstrated (New York City, March 2001) and used (Sacramento, California 2002) by AVANTE International Technology, Inc.. In 2004 Nevada was the first state to successfully implement a DRE voting system that printed an electronic record. The $9.3 million voting system provided by [[Sequoia Voting Systems]] included more than 2,600 [[AVC EDGE]] touchscreen DREs equipped with the [[VeriVote VVPAT]] component.

===Hardware===
Inadequately secured hardware can be subject to [[Election fraud#Physical tampering with voting machines|physical tampering]]. Some critics, such as the group "Wij vertrouwen stemcomputers niet" ("We do not trust voting machines"), charge that, for instance, foreign hardware could be inserted into the machine, or between the user and the central mechanism of the machine itself, using a [[man in the middle attack]] technique, and thus even sealing DRE machines may not be sufficient protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wijvertrouwenstemcomputersniet.nl/images/9/91/Es3b-en.pdf |title=Nedap/Groenendaal ES3B voting computer a security analysis (chapter 7.1) |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-05-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107134107/http://wijvertrouwenstemcomputersniet.nl/images/9/91/Es3b-en.pdf |archivedate=2010-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This claim is countered by the position that review and testing procedures can detect fraudulent code or hardware, if such things are present, and that a thorough, verifiable [[chain of custody]] would prevent the insertion of such hardware or software.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}  [[Security seal]]s are commonly employed in an attempt to detect tampering, but testing by [[Argonne National Laboratory]] and others demonstrates that existing seals can usually be quickly defeated by a trained person using low-tech methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Defeating Existing Tamper-Indicating Seals |publisher=[[Argonne National Laboratory]] |url=http://www.ne.anl.gov/capabilities/vat/defeat.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007232536/http://www.ne.anl.gov/capabilities/vat/defeat.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Software===
Security experts, such as [[Bruce Schneier]], have demanded that voting machine [[source code]] should be publicly available for inspection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2004/11/the_problem_wit.html |title=The Problem with Electronic Voting Machines |publisher=Schneier.com |accessdate=2010-05-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208093414/http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2004/11/the_problem_wit.html |archivedate=2010-02-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have also suggested publishing voting machine software under a [[free software license]] as is done in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.act.gov.au/elections/electronicvoting.html |title=The electronic voting and counting system |publisher=Elections.act.gov.au |accessdate=2010-05-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218212750/http://www.elections.act.gov.au/elections/electronicvoting.html |archivedate=February 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Software such as Sammaty come under [[GNU GPL]], which means their source code is publicly available and hence transparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://launchpad.net/sammaty/|title=Sammaty Election Engine under GNU GPL v3|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304061808/https://launchpad.net/sammaty/|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Testing and certification===
{{See also|Certification of voting machines}}

One method to any error with voting machines is [[parallel testing]], which are conducted on the Election Day with randomly picked machines. The [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] published a study showing that, to change the outcome of the 2000 U.S. Presidential election, only 2 votes in each precinct would have needed to be changed.&lt;ref&gt;Di Franco, A., Petro, A., Shear, E., and Vladimirov, V. 2004. Small vote manipulations can swing elections. Commun. ACM 47, 10 (Oct. 2004), 43–45. DOI= http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1022594.1022621&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
Criticisms can be mitigated by review and testing procedures to detect fraudulent code or hardware, if such things are present, and through a verifiable [[chain of custody]] to prevent the insertion of such hardware or software.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Critics also mention the increasing number of attack programs that online voting systems are greatly susceptible to. Malicious payloads- software data intended to do damage- have become so advanced that they can easily change a voter’s vote without any knowledge to other parties, regardless of voter identification or encryption software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rubin|first=Avi|title=Communications Policy and Information Technology: Promises, Problems, Prospects|chapter=Security Considerations for Remote Electronic Voting over the Internet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qPpdyIycDfMC&amp;pg=PA105|year=2002|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-03300-8|page=105|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180510162237/https://books.google.com/books?id=qPpdyIycDfMC&amp;pg=PA105|archivedate=2018-05-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benefits can include reduced tabulation times and an increase of participation ([[voter turnout]]), particularly through the use of Internet voting.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Those in opposition suggest alternate [[vote counting system]]s, citing [[Voting in Switzerland|Switzerland]] (as well as many other countries), which uses paper ballots exclusively, suggesting that electronic voting is not the only means to get a rapid count of votes. A country of a little over 7 million people, Switzerland publishes a definitive ballot count in about six hours. In villages, the ballots are even counted manually.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Critics also note that it becomes difficult or impossible to verify the identity of a voter remotely, and that the introduction of public networks become more vulnerable and complex.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Whether the [[total cost of ownership]] with electronic voting is lower than other systems is not yet{{when|date=July 2016}} clear.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

=== Brazil ===
In 1996, after tests conducted on more than 50 municipalities, the Brazilian Electoral Justice has launched their "voting machine". Since 2000, all Brazilian voters are able to use the electronic ballot boxes to choose their candidates. In [[Brazilian presidential election, 2010|2010 presidential election]] which had more than 135 million voters, the result was defined 75 minutes after the end of voting. The electronic ballot box is made up of two micro-terminals (one located in the voting cabin and the other with the voting board representative) which are connected by a 5-meter cable. Externally, the micro-terminals have only a numerical keyboard, which does not accept any command executed by the simultaneous pressure of more than one key. In case of power failure, the internal battery provides the energy or it can be connected to an automotive battery. The Brazilian electronic ballot box serves today as a model for other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Brazilian Superior Electoral Court  |url=http://www.tse.gov.br/internet/ingles/voto_eletronico/voto_eletronico.htm  |title=Electronic voting  |deadurl=yes  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721080133/http://www.tse.gov.br/internet/ingles/voto_eletronico/voto_eletronico.htm  |archivedate=2012-07-21  |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Estonia ===
Each Estonian citizen possesses an electronic chip-enabled ID card, which allows him/her to vote over the internet. The ID card is inserted into a card reader, which is connected to a computer. Once his/her identity is verified (using the electronic ID card as a sort of digital signature), he/she can then cast his/her vote via the internet. Votes are not considered final until the end of election day, so Estonian citizens can go back and re-cast their votes until election day is officially over. Popularity of [[Electronic voting in Estonia|online voting in Estonia]] has increased widely throughout the nation, as in the elections of 2014 and 2015, nearly one third of Estonian votes were cast online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vvk.ee/voting-methods-in-estonia/engindex/statistics|title=Statistics - Internet Voting - Voting methods in Estonia - Estonian National Electoral Committee|publisher=|accessdate=1 April 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170409013732/http://www.vvk.ee/voting-methods-in-estonia/engindex/statistics|archivedate=9 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Verifiable Internet Voting in Estonia" [http://research.cyber.ee/~jan/publ/mobileverification-ieee.pdf http://research.cyber.ee/~jan/publ/mobileverification-ie] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209115010/http://research.cyber.ee/~jan/publ/mobileverification-ieee.pdf |date=2014-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===
Electronic Voting Machines ("EVM") are being used in Indian General and State Elections to implement electronic voting in part from 1999 elections and recently in 2017 state elections held in five states across India. EVMs have replaced paper ballots in local, state and general (parliamentary) elections in India. There were earlier claims regarding EVMs' tamparability and security which have not been proved.After rulings of Delhi High Court, Supreme Court and demands from various political parties,Election Commission decided to introduce EVMs with voter-verified paper audit trail (VVPAT) system. The VVPAT system was introduced in 8 of 543 parliamentary constituencies as a pilot project in Indian general election, 2014.

====Timeline of development====
'''1964'''

The Norden-Coleman [[optical scan voting system]], the first such system to see actual use, was adopted for use in [[Orange County, California]].&lt;ref&gt;E. G. Arnold, [https://josephhall.org/arnold_ca_vs_hist.pdf History of Voting Systems in California] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306210826/https://josephhall.org/arnold_ca_vs_hist.pdf |date=2016-03-06 }}, California Secretary of State Bill Jones, June 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1974'''

The Video Voter, the first [[DRE voting machine]] used in a government election,  developed by the Frank Thornber Company in [[Chicago, Illinois]], saw its first trial use in 1974 near Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas W. Jones and Barbara Simons, Broken Ballots, CSLI Publications, 2012; see Section 5.2, page 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

''' Mar. 1975'''

The U.S. Government is given a report by Roy Saltman, a consultant in developing election technology and policies, in which the [[certification of voting machines]] is analyzed for the first time.

'''Aug 28, 1986'''

The Uniformed and Overseas Citizen Absentee Voting Act of 1986 (UOCAVA) requires that US states allow certain groups of citizens to register and vote absentee in elections for federal offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.howstuffworks.com/e-voting.htm|title=How E-voting Works|work=HowStuffWorks|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703014127/http://people.howstuffworks.com/e-voting.htm|archivedate=2015-07-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1990'''

The FEC ([[Federal Election Commission]]) released a universalized standard for computerized voting.

'''1996'''

[[Reform Party of the United States of America|The Reform Party]] uses I-Voting (Internet Voting) to select their presidential candidate. This election is the first governmental election to use this method in the U.S.

'''May 2002'''

The FEC revised the standards established for electronic voting from 1990.

'''Nov 2004'''

4,438 of votes in the general election is lost by North Carolina’s electronic voting machines. The machines continued to count electronic votes past the device's memory capacity and the votes were irretrievably lost.

'''Dec 2005'''

[[Black Box Voting]] showed how easy it is to hack an electronic voting system. Computer experts in Leon County, Fl lead a simulation where they changed the outcome of a mock election by tampering with the tabulator without leaving evidence of their actions.

'''Sep 13, 2006'''

It was demonstrated that [[Diebold]] Electronic Voting Machine can be hacked in less than a minute. Princeton's Professor of Computer Science, [[Edward Felten]] who installed a malware which could steal votes and replace them with fraudulent numbers without physically coming in contact with the voting machine or its memory card. The malware can also program a virus that can spread from machine to machine.

'''Sep 21, 2006'''

The governor of Maryland, [[Bob Ehrlich]] (R), advised against casting electronic votes as an alternative method for casting paper absentee ballots. This was a complete turn around since Maryland became one of the first states to accept electronic voting systems statewide during his term.

'''Sep 3, 2009'''

[[Diebold]], responsible for much of the technology in the election-systems business, sells their hold to [[Election Systems &amp; Software]], Inc for $5 Million, less than 1/5 of its price seven years earlier.

====Astronauts in orbit====
Texas law has allowed American astronauts who cannot vote in person and are unable to vote via absentee ballot, such as those aboard the [[International Space Station]] and [[Mir]] space station, to cast their ballots in [[Election Day|federal elections]] electronically from orbit since 1997. Ballots are sent via secure email to the [[Johnson Spaceflight Center]] and then passed on to the astronauts' home counties in Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Astronauts beam votes home|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2010/11/02/astronauts-beam-votes-home/|newspaper=CNN|date=2 November 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303184642/http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2010/11/02/astronauts-beam-votes-home/|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=James |first=Kate |title=Astronauts Cast Vote From Space Thanks to 1997 Texas Law |url=http://news.gather.com/viewArticle.action?articleId=281474978657286 |accessdate=2 November 2010 |newspaper=Gather.com |date=2 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511035033/http://news.gather.com/viewArticle.action?articleId=281474978657286 |archivedate=11 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Recommendations for improvement====
In December 2005 the US [[Election Assistance Commission]] unanimously adopted the 2005 [[Voluntary Voting System Guidelines]], which significantly increase security requirements for voting systems and expand access, including opportunities to vote privately and independently, for individuals with disabilities. The guidelines took effect in December 2007 replacing the 2002 Voting System Standards (VSS) developed by the [[Federal Election Commission]].

Some groups such as the [[Open Voting Consortium]] believe that to restore voter confidence and to reduce the potential for fraud, all electronic voting systems must be completely available to public scrutiny.

Also proposed is the requirement for use of open public standards and specifications such as the [[Election Markup Language]] (EML) standard developed by [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]] and now under consideration by ISO (see documents and schemas).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://docs.oasis-open.org/election/eml/v5.0/ |title=Index of /election/eml/v5.0/ |publisher=Docs.oasis-open.org |accessdate=2014-02-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221203421/http://docs.oasis-open.org/election/eml/v5.0/ |archivedate=2014-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These can provide consistent processes and mechanisms for managing and performing elections using computer systems.

====Legislation====
In the summer of 2004, the Legislative Affairs Committee of the [[Association of Information Technology Professionals]] issued a nine-point proposal for national standards for electronic voting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aitp.org/newsletter/2004julaug/index.jsp?article=evoteside.htm "Legislative Committee Resolution Awaiting BOD Approval"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724231220/http://www.aitp.org/newsletter/2004julaug/index.jsp?article=evoteside.htm |date=2011-07-24 }}.

Legislation has been introduced in the United States Congress regarding electronic voting, including the Nelson-Whitehouse bill. This bill would appropriate as much as 1 billion dollars to fund states' replacement of touch screen systems with optical scan voting system. The legislation also addresses requiring audits of 3% of precincts in all federal elections. It also mandates some form of paper trail audits for all electronic voting machines by the year 2012 on any type of voting technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Padgett |first=Tim |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1680451,00.html |title=Voting Out E-Voting Machines |publisher=TIME |date=2007-11-03 |accessdate=2014-02-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824205815/http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1680451,00.html |archivedate=2013-08-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another bill, HR.811 ([[Voter Confidence and Increased Accessibility Act of 2003|The Voter Confidence and Increased Accessibility Act of 2003]]), proposed by Representative [[Rush D. Holt, Jr.]], a Democrat from New Jersey, would act as an amendment to the Help America Vote Act of 2002 and require electronic voting machines to produce a paper audit trail for every vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=AlterNet / By Steven Rosenfeld |url=http://www.alternet.org/story/59077/?page=entire |title=The Fallout From California's Ban on Electronic Voting Machines |publisher=Alternet |date=2007-08-07 |accessdate=2014-02-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629170733/http://www.alternet.org/story/59077/?page=entire |archivedate=2011-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Senate companion bill version introduced by Senator Bill Nelson from Florida on November 1, 2007, necessitates the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology to continue researching and to provide methods of paper ballot voting for those with disabilities, those who do not primarily speak English, and those who do not have a high literacy rating. Also, it requires states to provide the federal office with audit reports from the hand counting of the voter verified paper ballots. Currently, this bill has been turned over to the [[United States Senate Committee on Rules and Administration]] and a vote date has not been set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:SN02295:@@@D&amp;summ2=m&amp; |title=Bill Summary &amp; Status - 110th Congress (2007–2008) - S.2295 - CRS Summary - THOMAS (Library of Congress) |publisher=Thomas.loc.gov |date=2007-11-01 |accessdate=2014-02-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018162217/http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:SN02295:@@@D&amp;summ2=m&amp; |archivedate=2015-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2008, Congressman Holt, because of an increasing concern regarding the insecurities surrounding the use of electronic voting technology, submitted additional bills to Congress regarding the future of electronic voting. One, called the "Emergency Assistance for Secure Elections Act of 2008" (HR5036), states that the [[General Services Administration]] will reimburse states for the extra costs of providing paper ballots to citizens, and the costs needed to hire people to count them.&lt;ref name="2008-PDF-election"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electionarchive.org/ucvInfo/US/legislation/SummaryFlyer5036.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305191355/http://electionarchive.org/ucvInfo/US/legislation/SummaryFlyer5036.pdf |archivedate=2008-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This bill was introduced to the House on January 17, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-h5036/show |title=H.R.5036: Emergency Assistance for Secure Elections Act of 2008 - U.S. Congress |publisher=OpenCongress |date=2008-04-15 |accessdate=2014-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313141636/http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-h5036/show |archivedate=2012-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This bill estimates that $500 million will be given to cover costs of the reconversion to paper ballots; $100 million given to pay the voting auditors; and $30 million given to pay the hand counters. This bill provides the public with the choice to vote manually if they do not trust the electronic voting machines.&lt;ref name = "2008-PDF-election"/&gt; A voting date has not yet been determined.

The [https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1562 '''Secure America's Future Elections Act''' or the SAFE Act (HR 1562)] was among the relevant legislation introduced in the [[115th Congress]]. The bill's provisions include designation of the infrastructure used to administer elections as [[critical infrastructure]]; funding for states to upgrade the security of the information technology and cybersecurity elements of election-related IT systems; and requirements for durable, readable paper ballots and manual audits of results of elections.

Thanks to the Internet, voters can cast their ballots over the electronic voting systems conveniently and efficiently without going to the polling stations. E-voting is a new technology has been implemented by developed countries; most of the research has embraced this technology within this context. Therefore, there is a necessity to explore the implementation and adoption of this technology in developing countries such as South Africa. Although the e-voting system has not yet been implemented in South Africa, researchers such as myself are attempted to study e-voting deployment opportunities in South Africa.

&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elections.org.za/content/Documents/Notices-and-Tenders/Notices/Government-Deposit-Gazette-Vol-639/|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;In the Report on [[Electronic voting|e-voting]], in the seminar that was held in Cape Town South Africa, date 12 and 12th March 2013 South Africa’s former President [[Kgalema Motlanthe]], challenged the country’s IEC ([http://www.elections.org.za/content/ Independent Electoral Commission]) to explore the possibility of e-voting due to the aftermath of the 2009 national and provincial elections, where the country saw an increase in the number of voting stations from [[Statistics South Africa|14 650 in 1999 to 19 726]], hence South Africa is now looking to move into electronic voting systems since there is also evidence that e-voting reduces the costs of elections – paper printing and workforce costs – as these have been developed and are developing for decades with the aim of allowing an easier participation of the citizens in the decision-making process, but without the physical and human resources needed in a traditional voting.

Countries like [[Mexico]], [[Turkey]] and [[Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission|Nigeria]] who did surveys on the voters’ perception of security and other trust factors got an overall result that automated elections mean that people can trust the results because it allows for a process that is auditable, transparent and secure, since it helps reduce human error. Where for other largely populated countries like Brazil, India and the Philippines, electronic voting and electronic counting means that people can get official election results within hours, instead of weeks.

[http://0-ieeexplore.ieee.org.tkplib01.tut.ac.za/document/6679812/ Alomari and Figueroa] In a nut shell, the main feature of democracy is the right or chance to vote, express an opinion, and/or participate in a decision – voting which gives [[Freedom of religion|freedom]] to choose the best leader for the country, said &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=OSHO|first=YISA|date=|title=E-voting in Nigeria: A survey of voters' perception of security and other trust factors.|url=http://0-ieeexplore.ieee.org.tkplib01.tut.ac.za/document/7360511/|journal=2015 International Conference on Cyberspace (CYBER-Abuja)|volume=|pages=202-211|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;(Osho et al., 2015). This alone gives opportunity to the people to choose a leader and express their point of view. This proposal is to ensure that this expectation is met with the deployment of [[Evocation|e-voting]] system.

Not only is e-voting great with the turn-around-time on producing results but it also provides a greater auditable auditing process of the election results where necessary. As stated by Sedky &amp; Hamed that sometimes electronic have and will produce errors in the election's result due to problems with hardware and/or software, or procedures. Auditing has such benefits in revealing when recounts are necessary to verify election outcomes, finding errors whether accidental or intentional, [[Fraud deterrence|deterring fraud]] and promoting public confidence in elections.

==== Main objectives to be considered when thinking e-voting in South Africa ====

* To determine factors needed for the deployment of e-voting in South Africa
* To identify the measures taken when deploying e-voting in South Africa
* To analyze the influence of the identified factors needed to deploy e-voting in South Africa

Professor Osho did a research which intended to address the concerns about data security, verifiability and certification and cost; the basic factors to be considered when deploying e-Voting. He created a conceptual framework which combined 3 theories to build 1 conceptual framework through the 5 constructs – in assisting to arrive to the aiming of this research. Thus, the research papers identified that there is a need to understand the security and cost concerns.

The 3 theoretical frameworks being used in this research paper to create 1 conceptual framework will help complete this study. Namely they are:

# '''Process Visualization Theory''',     for processes that have relied on physical interaction between people, and     between people and objects are being migrated to virtual environments in     which physical interaction is not available. And the constructs needed for     it are Representation and Monitoring Capacity to produce a Synchronism Requirements in the Process.
# [[Modern portfolio theory|P'''ortfolio  Theory''']]: The IT projects portfolios are formed according to the     organization’s strategic objectives, the risks, project costs, the impact     on the company’s success factors and resource use. And the construct     needed for it the Cost construct.
# '''[[Contingency theory|Contingency Theory]]''': uses IT, publication of information     can be controlled and relevant information can be shared with relevant     access controlled parties. This technique uses “role based security” system     which allows all the benefits of IT while still maintaining     confidentiality. And the constructs needed for it are Data management     and Security.

==Documented problems with electronic voting==

* iVote is a remote electronic voting system in New South Wales that allows eligible voters a chance to vote over the Internet. However, during the New South Wales state election in 2015, there were several reports that over 66,000 electronic votes could have been compromised.

;California top-to-bottom review
In May 2007, [[California]] Secretary of State [[Debra Bowen]] commissioned a "top-to-bottom review" of all electronic voting systems in the state.  She engaged computer security experts led by the [[University of California]] to perform security evaluations of voting system source code as well as "red teams" running "worst case" Election Day scenarios attempting to identify vulnerabilities to tampering or error. The Top to Bottom review also included a comprehensive review of manufacturer documentation as well as a review of accessibility features and alternative language requirements.

The end results of the tests were released in the four detailed Secretary of State August 3, 2007, resolutions (for Diebold Election Systems, Hart InterCivic, Sequoia Voting Systems and Elections Systems and Software, Inc.) and updated October 25, 2007 revised resolutions for Diebold and Sequoia voting systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sos.ca.gov/voting-systems/oversight/top-to-bottom-review.htm CA SoS Top to Bottom Review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141203021026/http://www.sos.ca.gov/voting-systems/oversight/top-to-bottom-review.htm |date=2014-12-03 }} Retrieved March 2, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  The security experts found significant security flaws in all of the manufacturers' voting systems, flaws that could allow a single non-expert to compromise an entire election.

On August 3, 2007, Bowen decertified machines that were tested in her top-to-bottom view including the ES&amp;S [[InkaVote]] machine, which was not included in the review because the company submitted it past the deadline for testing. The report issued July 27, 2007, was conducted by the expert "red team" attempting to detect the levels of technological vulnerability. Another report on August 2, 2007 was conducted by a source code review team to detect flaws in voting system source code. Both reports found that three of the tested systems fell far short of the minimum requirements specified in the 2005 Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (VVSG). Some of the systems tested were conditionally recertified with new stringent security requirements imposed.&lt;ref&gt;Simons, Barbara. August 13, 2007.

;2000 presidential election in Florida
Punched cards received considerable notoriety in 2000 when their uneven use in [[Voting machine#Punched card|Votomatic]] style systems in [[Florida]] was alleged to have affected the outcome of the [[United States presidential election, 2000|U.S. presidential election]]. Invented by Joseph P. Harris, Votomatic was manufactured for a time under license by IBM. William Rouverol, who built the prototype and wrote patents, stated that after the patents expired in 1982, lower quality machines had appeared on the market. The machines used in Florida had five times as many errors as a true Votomatic, he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=IGS Votomatic Prototype Goes to the Smithsonian |journal=Institute of Governmental Studies, Public Affairs Report |volume=42 |issue=4 |date=Winter 2001 |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |url=http://www.igs.berkeley.edu/publications/par/winter2001/votomatic.htm |format=– &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=intitle%3AIGS+Votomatic+Prototype+Goes+to+the+Smithsonian&amp;as_publication=Institute+of+Governmental+Studies%2C+Public+Affairs+Report&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713201451/http://www.igs.berkeley.edu/publications/par/winter2001/votomatic.htm |archivedate=July 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Punched-card-based voting systems, the Votomatic system in particular, use special cards where each possible hole is pre-scored, allowing perforations to be made by the voter pressing a stylus through a guide in the [[voting machine]].  A problem with this system is the incomplete punch; this can lead to a smaller hole than expected, or to a mere slit in the card, or to a mere dimple in the card, or to a ''[[hanging chad]]''. This technical problem was claimed by the Democratic Party to have influenced the [[2000 U.S. presidential election]] in the state of Florida; critics claimed that punched card voting machines were primarily used in Democratic areas and that hundreds of ballots were not read properly or were disqualified due to incomplete punches, which allegedly tipped the vote in favor of [[George W. Bush]] over [[Al Gore]].

==Popular culture==
In the 2006 film [[Man of the Year (2006 film)|''Man of the Year'']] starring [[Robin Williams]], the character played by Williams—a comedic host of political talk show—wins the election for President of the United States when a software error in the electronic voting machines produced by the fictional manufacturer Delacroy causes votes to be tallied inaccurately.

In ''Runoff'', a 2007 novel by [[Mark Coggins]], a surprising showing by the [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]] candidate in a [[San Francisco Mayor|San Francisco Mayoral election]] forces a [[Two-round system|runoff]] between him and the highly favored establishment candidate—a plot line that closely parallels the actual results of the 2003 election. When the private-eye protagonist of the book investigates at the behest of a powerful Chinatown businesswoman, he determines that the outcome was rigged by someone who defeated the security on the city's newly installed e-voting system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.januarymagazine.com/crfiction/runoff.html |title=January Magazine, "The Fix Is In" |publisher=Januarymagazine.com |accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Hacking Democracy]]" is a 2006 [[documentary film]] shown on [[HBO]]. Filmed over three years, it documents American citizens investigating anomalies and irregularities with electronic voting systems that occurred during America's 2000 and 2004 elections, especially in [[Volusia County, Florida]]. The film investigates the flawed integrity of electronic voting machines, particularly those made by [[Diebold Election Systems]] and culminates in the hacking of a [[Diebold]] election system in [[Leon County, Florida]].

The central conflict in the [[Massively multiplayer online game|MMO]] video game [[Infantry (video game)|Infantry]] resulted from the global institution of [[direct democracy]] through the use of personal voting devices sometime in the 22nd century AD. The practice gave rise to a 'voting class' of citizens composed mostly of homemakers and retirees who tended to be at home all day. Because they had the most free time to participate in voting, their opinions ultimately came to dominate politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freeinfantry.com/history1/infantry/ |title=Infantry Archive, 'The Collective Era' |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no-byline.--&gt; |website=freeinfantry.com |accessdate=2016-09-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103154939/http://www.freeinfantry.com/history1/infantry/ |archivedate=2017-01-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1481">'''Empirical legal studies''' ('''ELS''') is an approach to the study of [[law]], [[legal procedure]], and [[legal theory]] through the use of [[empirical]] research. Empirical legal researchers use research techniques that are typical of [[economics]], [[psychology]], and [[sociology]]; however, ELS research tends to be more focused on purely legal questions than the related fields of [[law and economics]], [[legal psychology]], and [[sociology of law]].  ELS also tends to be more narrowly quantitative than fields such as [[Law and Society Association|law-and-society]] or [[new legal realism]] (NLR), which embrace [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] and [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] [[Social science|social science methods]], as well as [[Multimethodology|mixed method]] approaches.

In 2004, the ''[[Journal of Empirical Legal Studies]]'' was launched by the [[Society for Empirical Legal Studies]] and [[Cornell Law School]], and within three years rose to be ranked 28th of the over 800 US law journals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawlib.wlu.edu/LJ/index.aspx Law Journals: Submission and Ranking] Ranking of US Law journals by impact factor, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Estate satire''' is a genre of writing from 14th Century, [[Medieval literature|Medieval literary]] works. The three Medieval estates were the Clergy (those who prayed), the [[Nobility]] (those who fought) and lastly the [[Peasantry]] (those who labored). These estates were the major [[social classes]] of the time and were typically gender specific to men, although the clergy also included nuns. Nevertheless, women were considered as a separate class in themselves,&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Jill. ''Chaucer and Medieval Estates Satire''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1973, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; the best-known example being [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s [[The Wife of Bath's Tale|Wife of Bath]]. Estates satire praised the glories and purity of each class in its ideal form, but was also used as a window to show how society had gotten out of hand. The ''Norton Anthology of [[English Literature]]'' describes the duty of estates satire: "They set forth the functions and duties of each estate and castigate the failure of the estates in the present world to live up to their divinely assigned social roles".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Estates Satire|work=The Norton Anthology of English Literature|url=http://www.wwnorton.com/college/english/nael/middleages/topic_1/satire.htm|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|accessdate = 25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The First Estate, the Church, consisted of those who ran the Catholic church and part of the country. They were the recipients of the ''[[tithe]]'' or the 10% tax given to the Church.

The Second Estate, the Nobility, were royalty, not including the King. They were never taxed but could collect taxes from the Third Estate, and had other special privileges.

The Third Estate, the Commons, is the largest, consisting of around 96% of the population (UCL). The commons included everyone who did not belong to the first two estates, primarily rural [[peasants]] and the urban [[bourgeois]] or middle class. They had none of the privileges or luxuries that the first two estates enjoyed, although the [[History of capitalism|rise of capitalism]] in the late 14th Century resulted in the bourgeois having relatively more power.

Among 14th-century English authors, [[John Gower]], [[William Langland]], and Chaucer were three of the most prominent writers of the time to include estates satire in their works. Although Gower was more aggressive in his approach, Chaucer was more subtle and more successful, making himself to be the fool of the joke and subverting may of the conventions of the genre.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, ''Chaucer and Medieval Estates Satire''.&lt;/ref&gt; Several Medieval authors used estates satire to express their disgust towards the hypocrisy of the three estates and their supposed virtuous ways.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2575">'''Gender empowerment''' is the [[empowerment]] of people of any [[gender]]. While conventionally being reduced to its aspect of [[Women empowerment|empowerment of women]], the concept stresses [[Sex and gender distinction|the distinction]] between biological [[sex]] and [[Gender role|gender as a role]], also referring to other marginalized [[genders]] in a particular political or social context.

Gender empowerment has become a significant topic of discussion in regard to development and economics. Entire nations, businesses, communities, and groups can benefit from the implementation of programs and policies that adopt the notion of women empowerment.&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009"&gt;Deneulin, Séverine, with Lila Shahani.  2009.  An Introduction to the Human Development and Capability Approach: Freedom and Agency.  Sterling, VA: Earthscan.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Empowerment]] is one of the main procedural concerns when addressing [[human rights and development]]. [[Capability Approach|The Human Development and Capabilities Approach]], [[The Millennium Development Goals]], and other credible approaches/goals point to empowerment and participation as a necessary step if a country is to overcome the obstacles associated with poverty and development.&lt;ref&gt;U.N. General Assembly, 55th Session. “United Nations Millennium Declaration.” (A/55/L.2).  8 September 2000. (Online) Available: www.un.org/millennium/declaration/ares552e.pdf (accessed January 2, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measuring ==
Gender empowerment can be measured through the [[Gender Empowerment Measure]], or the GEM. The GEM shows women's participation in a given nation, both politically and economically. Gem is calculated by tracking "the share of seats in [[parliament]] held by women; of female legislators, senior officials and managers; and of female profession and technical workers; and the [[gender disparity]] in earned income, reflecting economic independence."&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009"/&gt; It then ranks countries given this information. Other measures that take into account the importance of female participation and equality include: the [[Gender Parity Index]] and the [[Gender Development Index]] (GDI).&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009"/&gt;

'''General American''' (abbreviated as '''GA''' or '''GenAm''') is the [[umbrella term|umbrella]] [[language variety|variety]] of [[American English]]—the continuum of accents{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=470}}—spoken by a majority of Americans and popularly perceived, among Americans, as lacking any distinctly regional, ethnic, or socioeconomic characteristics.{{sfnp|Van Riper|2014|pp=123}}&lt;ref name="Kovecses" /&gt;{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=34}} Americans with high education,{{sfnp|Kortmann|2004|p=257}} or from the [[Midland American English|North Midland]], [[Western New England English|Western New England]], and [[Western American English|Western]] regions of the country, are the most likely to be perceived as having "General American" accents.{{sfnp|Van Riper|2014|pp=128–9}}&lt;ref&gt;Labov, William; Ash, Sharon; Boberg, Charles (1997). "[http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/NationalMap/NationalMap.html#Heading11 A National Map of the Regional Dialects of American English]" and "[http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/NationalMap/NatMap1.html Map 1]". Department of Linguistics, University of Pennsylvania. "The North Midland: Approximates the initial position|Absence of any marked features"; "On Map 1, there is no single defining feature of the North Midland given. In fact, the most characteristic sign of North Midland membership on this map is the small black dot that indicates a speaker with none of the defining features given"; "Map 1 shows Western New England as a residual area, surrounded by the marked patterns of Eastern New England, New York City, and the Inland North. [...] No clear pattern of sound change emerges from western New England in the Kurath and McDavid materials or in our present limited data."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clopper, Cynthia G., Susannah V. Levi, and David B. Pisoni (2006). "[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3319012/ Perceptual Similarity of Regional Dialects of American English]".

See also: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3319012/figure/F1/ map].&lt;/ref&gt; The precise definition and usefulness of the term continues to be debated,{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=118}}{{sfnp|Van Riper|2014|pp=124, 126}}{{sfnp|Kortmann|2004|p=262}} and the scholars who use it today admittedly do so as a convenient basis for comparison rather than for exactness.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=118}}{{sfnp|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=263}} Some scholars, despite controversy,{{sfnp|Van Riper|2014|pp=125–6}} prefer the term '''Standard American English'''.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=34}}{{sfnp|Kortmann|2004|p=257}}&lt;ref name="Boberg" /&gt;

[[Canadian English#Standard Canadian English|Standard Canadian English]] is sometimes considered to fall under the [[phonology|phonological]] spectrum of General American,&lt;ref name="Boberg" /&gt; especially rather than the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Received Pronunciation]]; in fact, spoken Canadian English aligns with General American in nearly every situation where British and American English differ.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=491}}

== Definition==
=== History and modern definition ===
The term "General American" was first disseminated by American [[English studies|English scholar]] George Philip Krapp, who, in 1925, described it as an American type of speech that was "[[American West|Western]]" but "not local in character".{{sfnp|Van Riper|2014|p=124}} In 1930, American [[linguist]] [[John Samuel Kenyon]], who largely popularized the term, considered it equivalent to the speech of "the North" or "Northern American",{{sfnp|Van Riper|2014|p=124}} but, in 1934, "Western and Midwestern".{{sfnp|Van Riper|2014|p=125}} Now typically regarded as falling under the General American umbrella are the regional accents of the [[Western American English|West]],{{sfnp|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=146}}{{sfnp|Van Riper|2014|p=130}} [[Western New England English|Western New England]],{{sfnp|Van Riper|2014|pp=128, 130}} and the [[Midland American English|North Midland]] (a band spanning central Ohio, central Indiana, central Illinois, northern Missouri, southern Iowa, and southeastern Nebraska),{{sfnp|Van Riper|2014|pp=129–130}}{{sfnp|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=268}} plus the accents of highly educated Americans nationwide.{{sfnp|Kortmann|2004|p=257}} Arguably, all [[Canadian English]] accents west of [[Quebec]] are also General American,&lt;ref name="Boberg" /&gt; though developing Canadian features, including [[Canadian raising|vowel raising]], may serve to increasingly distinguish such accents from American ones.&lt;ref&gt;Harbeck, James (2015). "[http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20150820-why-is-canadian-english-unique Why is Canadian English unique?]" ''BBC''. BBC.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[William Labov]] et al.'s 2006 ''[[Atlas of North American English]]'' identified these three accent regions—the Western U.S., Midland U.S., and Canada—as sharing those pronunciation features whose convergence would form a hypothetical "General American" accent.

Regarded as having General American accents in the earlier 20th century, but not by the middle of the 20th century, are the [[Mid-Atlantic United States]],{{sfnp|Van Riper|2014|pp=128–9}} the [[Inland North|Inland Northern United States]],{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=470}} and [[Western Pennsylvania English|Western Pennsylvania]].{{sfnp|Van Riper|2014|pp=128–9}} Accents that have never been included, even since the term's popularization in the 1930s, are the regional accents (especially the [[rhoticity in English|"r"-dropping]] ones) of [[Eastern New England English|Eastern New England]], [[New York City English|New York City]], and the [[Southern American English|American South]].{{sfnp|Van Riper|2014|pp=123, 129}} In 1982, British phonetician [[John C. Wells]] wrote that two-thirds of the American population spoke with a General American accent.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=34}}

=== Disputed usage ===

[[English studies|English-language scholar]] William A. Kretzchmar, Jr. explains in a 2004 article that the term "General American" came to refer to "a presumed most common or 'default' form of American English, especially to be distinguished from marked regional speech of New England or the South" and especially to speech associated with the vaguely-defined "[[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]", despite any historical or present evidence supporting this notion. In fact, he argues, a General American accent is merely any in which American speakers have suppressed regional and social features that have become widely noticed and stigmatized.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kortmann|2004|p=262}}: 'The term "General American" arose as a name for a presumed most common or "default" form of American English, especially to be distinguished from marked regional speech of New England or the South. "General American" has often been considered to be the relatively unmarked speech of "the Midwest", a vague designation for anywhere in the vast midsection of the country from Ohio west to Nebraska, and from the Canadian border as far south as Missouri or Kansas. No historical justification for this term exists, and neither do present circumstances support its use... [I]t implies that there is some exemplary state of American English from which other varieties deviate. On the contrary, [it] can best be characterized as what is left over after speakers suppress the regional and social features that have risen to salience and become noticeable.'&lt;/ref&gt;

Since calling one variety of American speech the "general" variety can imply [[Linguistic prescription|privileging and prejudice]], Kretzchmar instead promotes the term ''Standard American English'', which he defines as a level of American English pronunciation "employed by educated speakers in formal settings", while still being variable within the U.S. from place to place, and even from speaker to speaker.{{sfnp|Kortmann|2004|p=257}} However, the term "standard" may also be interpreted as problematically implying a superior or "best" form of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{sfnp|Kortmann|2004|p=257}}: "''Standard English'' may be taken to reflect conformance to a set of rules, but its meaning commonly gets bound up with social ideas about how one's character and education are displayed in one's speech".&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''Standard North American English'', in an effort to incorporate [[Canadian English|Canadian speakers]] under the accent continuum, was also first suggested by [[Charles Boberg]] in 2004.&lt;ref name="Boberg"&gt;Boberg, Charles (2004). "[https://books.google.com/books?id=gZV7AAAAQBAJ&amp;dq= Standard Canadian English]". In Raymond Hickey. ''Standards of English: Codified Varieties Around the World''. Cambridge University Press. p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern language scholars discredit the original notion of General American as a single unified accent, or a [[standard English|standardized form of English]]{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=118}}{{sfnp|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=263}}—except perhaps as used by  [[television network]]s and other [[mass media]].{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=470}}&lt;ref&gt;Labov, William (2012). ''Dialect diversity in America: The politics of language change''. University of Virginia Press. pp. 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the term is understood to refer to a continuum of American speech, with some slight internal variation,{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=118}} but otherwise characterized by the absence of "[[markedness|marked]]" pronunciation features: those perceived by Americans as strongly indicative of a fellow American speaker's regional origin, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. Despite confusion arising from the evolving definition and vagueness of the term "General American" and its consequent rejection by some linguists,{{sfnp|Van Riper|2014|p=129}} the term persists mainly as a reference point to compare a baseline "typical" American English accent with other [[World Englishes|Englishes around the world]] (for instance, see: [[Comparison of General American and Received Pronunciation]]).{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=118}}

== Origins ==
===Regional origins===
Though General American accents are not commonly perceived as associated with any region, their [[phonology|sound system]] does have traceable regional origins: specifically, the English of the non-coastal Northeastern United States in the very early twentieth century.{{sfnp|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=190}} This includes western [[New England]] and the area to its immediate west, settled by members of the same dialect community:{{sfnp|Bonfiglio|2002|p=43}} interior [[Pennsylvania]], [[upstate New York]], and the adjacent [[Midwestern United States|"Midwest"]] or [[Great Lakes region]]. However, since the early to middle twentieth century,{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=470}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/11/14/051114ta_talk_seabrook|work=[[The New Yorker]]|title=Talking the Tawk|year=2005|publisher=Condé Nast}}&lt;/ref&gt; deviance away from General American sounds started occurring, and may be ongoing, in the eastern Great Lakes region due to its [[Northern Cities Vowel Shift]] (NCVS) towards a unique [[Inland North|Inland Northern accent]] (often now associated with the region's urban centers, like Chicago and Detroit) and in the western Great Lakes region towards a unique [[North Central American English|North Central accent]] (often associated with Minnesota, Wisconsin, and North Dakota).

===Popularity===
Linguists have proposed multiple factors contributing to the popularity of a [[rhoticity in English|rhotic]] "General American" class of accents throughout the United States. Most factors focus on the first half of the twentieth century, though a basic General American pronunciation system may have existed even before the twentieth century, since most American English dialects have diverged very little from each other anyway, when compared to dialects of single languages in other countries where there has been more time for [[language change]] (such as the [[English language in England|English dialects of England]] or [[German dialects|German dialects of Germany]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=McWhorter|first=John H.|authorlink=John McWhorter|year=2001|title=Word on the Street: Debunking the Myth of a "Pure" Standard English|publisher=Basic Books|postscript=[link to page: [https://books.google.com/books?id=TfcovMPyLjEC&amp;q=%22american+english+dialect+that+diverges%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22american%20english%20dialect%20that%20diverges%22&amp;f=false]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One factor fueling General American's popularity was the major demographic change of twentieth-century American society: increased [[suburbanization]], leading to less mingling of different social classes and less density and diversity of linguistic interactions. As a result, wealthier and higher-educated Americans' communications became more restricted to their own demographic. This, alongside their new marketplace that transcended regional boundaries (arising from the century's faster transportation methods), reinforced a widespread belief that highly-educated Americans should not possess a regional accent.{{sfnp|Kortmann|2004|pp=260-262}} A General American sound, then, originated from both suburbanization and suppression of regional accent by highly-educated Americans in formal settings. A second factor was a rise in immigration to the Great Lakes area (one native region of supposed "General American" speech) following the region's rapid industrialization period after the [[American Civil War]], when this region's speakers went on to form a successful and highly mobile business elite, who travelled around the country in the mid-twentieth century, spreading the high status of their accents.{{sfnp|Bonfiglio|2002|pp=69-70}} A third factor is that various sociological (often race- and class-based) forces repelled socially-conscious Americans away from accents negatively associated with certain minority groups, such as [[African Americans]] and poor white communities in the South and with Southern and Eastern European immigrant groups (for example, Jewish communities) in the coastal Northeast.{{sfnp|Bonfiglio|2002|pp=4, 97-98}} Instead, socially-conscious Americans settled upon accents more prestigiously associated with [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant]] communities in the remainder of the country: namely, the West, the Midwest, and the non-coastal Northeast.{{sfnp|Van Riper|2014|pp=123, 128-130}}

Influential to codifying General American pronunciation standards in writing was [[John Samuel Kenyon]], author of ''American Pronunciation'' (1924) and pronunciation editor for the second edition of ''[[Webster's Dictionary|Webster's New International Dictionary]]'' (1934), who used as a basis his native Midwestern (specifically, northern Ohio) pronunciation.{{sfnp|Seabrook|2005}} Kenyon's home state of Ohio, far from being an area of "non-regional" accents, has emerged now as a crossroads for at least four distinct regional accents, according to late twentieth-century research.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, Spencer (2012). [http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/science/2012/11/18/dissecting-ohios-dialects.html "Dissecting Ohio's Dialects"]. ''The Columbus Dispatch''. GateHouse Media, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Kenyon himself was vocally opposed to the notion of any supreme standard of American speech.&lt;ref name="Hampton"&gt;Hampton, Marian E. &amp; Barbara Acker (eds.) (1997). ''The Vocal Vision: Views on Voice.'' [[Hal Leonard Corporation]]. p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the media ==
General American, like the British [[Received Pronunciation]] (RP) and [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige accents]] of many other societies, has never been the accent of the entire nation, and, unlike RP, does not constitute a homogeneous national standard. Starting in the 1930s, nationwide radio networks adopted non-coastal [[Northern American English|Northern U.S.]] rhotic pronunciations for their "General American" standard.&lt;ref&gt;Fought, John G. (2005). "[http://www.pbs.org/speak/seatosea/americanvarieties/southern/ Rful Southern]". ''Do You Speak American?'' MacNeil/Lehrer Productions.&lt;/ref&gt; The entertainment industry similarly shifted from a [[rhoticity in English|non-rhotic]] standard to a rhotic one in the late 1940s, after the triumph of the [[Second World War]], with the patriotic incentive for a more wide-ranging and unpretentious "heartland variety" in television and radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=McWhorter|first=John H.|authorlink=John McWhorter|year=2001|title=Word on the Street: Debunking the Myth of a "Pure" Standard English|publisher=Basic Books|postscript=[link to page: [https://books.google.com/books?id=TfcovMPyLjEC&amp;q=%22this%20accent%20passed%20out%20of%20fashion%22]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

General American is thus often associated with the speech of North American radio and television announcers, promoted as prestigious in their industry,&lt;ref name="freshair1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="60minutes" /&gt; where it is sometimes called a "newscaster accent", "television English", or "Network Standard".&lt;ref name="Kovecses"&gt;Kövecses, Zoltán (2000).

Peterborough, Canada: Broadview Press. pp. 81-2.&lt;/ref&gt; Instructional classes in the United States that promise "[[accent reduction]]", "accent modification", or "accent neutralization" usually attempt to teach General American patterns. A common experience among many American celebrities is having worked hard to lose their native regional accents in favor of a more mainstream General American sound, including television [[journalist]] [[Linda Ellerbee]], who stated that "in television you are not supposed to sound like you're ''from'' anywhere",&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url = http://www.thenewsburner.com/2011/10/20/you-know-what-the-midwest-is/|title=You Know What The Midwest Is?}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as political comedian [[Stephen Colbert]], both of whom reduced their [[Southern American English|Southern accent]]s (Colbert completely so), because of the common portrayal of Southerners as stupid and uneducated on American television.&lt;ref name="freshair1"&gt;{{Citation|url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4464017|title = A Fake Newsman's Fake Newsman: Stephen Colbert|first = Terry|last = Gross|authorlink= Terry Gross|work= [[Fresh Air]]|publisher = [[National Public Radio]]|date = January 24, 2005|accessdate = 2007-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="60minutes"&gt;{{Citation|url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/04/27/60minutes/main1553506.shtml|title = The Colbert Report: Morley Safer Profiles Comedy Central's 'Fake' Newsman|first = Morley|last = Safer|authorlink= Morley Safer|publisher = [[60 Minutes]]|date = August 13, 2006|accessdate =2006-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Rhoticity (or ''r''-fulness): General American accents are firmly [[rhotic accent|rhotic]], pronouncing the ''r'' sound in all environments, including after vowels, such as in ''pearl'', ''car'', and ''court''.&lt;ref name="Plag"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Plag|first1=Ingo|last2=Braun|first2=Maria|last3=Lappe|first3=Sabine|last4=Schramm |first4=Mareile |title=Introduction to English Linguistics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bLvZHmGA8q4C|accessdate=4 July 2013|year=2009|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|page=53|isbn=978-3-11-021550-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Phonetics of Dutch and English|edition=5|location=[[Leiden]]/[[Boston]]|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=2002|author1-first=Beverley|author1-last=Collins|author2-first=Inger M.|author2-last=Mees|pages=178|url=http://npu.edu.ua/!e-book/book/djvu/A/iif_kgpm_Collins_Phonetics_of_English_and_Dutch_pdf.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Americans often realize the phoneme {{IPA|/r/}} as postalveolar {{IPAblink|ɹ̠|audio=y}}, as in most varieties of English, but sometimes as [[retroflex consonant|retroflex]] {{IPAblink|ɻ|audio=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Hallé|Best|Levitt|1999|p=283}} citing {{Harvcoltxt|Delattre|Freeman|1968}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Zawadzki|Kuehn|1980}}, and {{Harvcoltxt|Boyce|Espy-Wilson|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-rhotic American accents, those that do not pronounce ''r'' in some positions in a word, such as some [[Eastern New England English|Eastern New England]], [[New York City English|New York]], or [[African American Vernacular English|African American vernacular accents]], are often quickly noticed by General American listeners and perceived to sound especially ethnic, regional, or "old-fashioned".&lt;ref name="Plag" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Phonetics of Dutch and English|edition=5|location=[[Leiden]]/[[Boston]]|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=2002|author1-first=Beverley|author1-last=Collins|author2-first=Inger M.|author2-last=Mees|pages=181, 306|url=http://npu.edu.ua/!e-book/book/djvu/A/iif_kgpm_Collins_Phonetics_of_English_and_Dutch_pdf.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolchover, Natalie (2012).

* [[T-glottalization|''T''-glottalization]]: {{IPA|/t/}} is normally pronounced as [[No audible release|unreleased]] or as a [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|[ʔ]}} when before another consonant (notably including before [[syllabic consonant|syllabic]] {{IPA|[n̩]}}, as in ''button'' {{IPA-all|ˈbʌʔn̩||en-us-button.ogg}}) or when following a vowel at the end of a sentence.
* [[Flapping]]: {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} become an [[alveolar flap]], written {{IPAblink|ɾ|audio=y}}, between vowels or liquids (''l'' and ''r''), as in ''water'' {{IPA-all|ˈwɔɾɚ||En-us-water.ogg}}, ''party'' {{IPA|[ˈpɑɹɾi]}}, ''model'' {{IPA|[ˈmɑɾɫ̩]}}, and ''what is it?'' {{IPA|[wʌɾˈɪzɪt]}}.
* [[Yod-dropping]]: After consonants formed with the tongue touching the ridge on the roof of the mouth ([[alveolar consonant]]s), a formerly present {{IPA|/j/}} is normally "dropped" or "deleted" in syllables bearing full or partial stress, so that, for example, ''suit'' {{IPA|/sjut/}} has become {{IPA|/sut/}}, ''new'' {{IPA|/nju/}} has become {{IPA|/nu/}}, ''endure'' {{IPA|/ˌɛnˈdjʊr/}} has become {{IPA|/ˌɛnˈdʊr/}}, and ''attitude'' {{IPA|/ˈætɪˌtjud/}} has become {{IPA|/ˈætɪˌtud/}}.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=247}}

* [[Wine–whine merger|''Wine''–''whine'' merger]]: The consonants spelled ''w'' and ''wh'' are usually pronounced the same, as in most modern English dialects worldwide.

* Vowel length is not [[phoneme|phonemic]] in General American, and therefore vowels such as {{IPA|/i/}} are usually transcribed without the length mark. Phonetically, the vowels of GA are short {{IPA|[ɪ, i, ʊ, u, eɪ, oʊ, ɛ, ʌ, ɔ, æ, ɑ, aɪ, ɔɪ, aʊ]}} when they precede the fortis consonants {{IPA|/p, t, k, tʃ, f, θ, s, ʃ/}} within the same syllable and long {{IPA|[ɪˑ, iˑ, ʊˑ, uˑ, eˑɪ, oˑʊ, ɛˑ, ʌˑ, ɔˑ, æˑ, ɑˑ, aˑɪ, ɔˑɪ, aˑʊ]}} elsewhere. This applies to all vowels but the schwa {{IPA|/ə/}} (which is typically very short {{IPA|[ə̆]}}), so when e.g. {{IPA|/i/}} is realized as a diphthong {{IPA|[ɪ̝i]}} it has the same allophones as the other diphthongs, whereas the sequence {{IPA|/ɜr/}} (which corresponds to the {{sc2|NURSE}} vowel {{IPA|/ɜː/}} in RP) has the same allophones as phonemic monophthongs: short {{IPA|[ɚ]}} before fortis consonants and long {{IPA|[ɚˑ]}} elsewhere. The short {{IPA|[ɚ]}} is also used for the sequence {{IPA|/ər/}} (the {{sc2|LETTER}} vowel). All unstressed vowels are also shorter than the stressed ones, and the more unstressed syllables follow a stressed one, the shorter it is, so that {{IPA|/i/}} in ''l&lt;u&gt;ea&lt;/u&gt;d'' is noticeably longer than in ''l&lt;u&gt;ea&lt;/u&gt;dership''.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|pp=120, 480–481}}{{sfnp|Wells|2008}}
* {{IPA|/i, u, eɪ, oʊ, ɑ/}} are considered to compose a [[natural class]] of [[Tenseness|tense]] monophthongs in General American, especially for speakers with the [[cot–caught merger|''cot–caught'' merger]]. The class manifests in how GA speakers treat loanwords, as in the majority of cases stressed syllables of foreign words are assigned one of these five vowels, regardless of whether the original pronunciation has a tense or a lax vowel. An example of that is the surname of [[Thomas Mann]], which is pronounced with the tense {{IPA|/ɑ/}} rather than lax {{IPA|/æ/}} (as in RP, which mirrors the German pronunciation {{IPA|/man/}}, which also has a lax vowel).{{sfnp|Lindsey|1990}} All of the tense vowels except {{IPA|/ɑ/}} can have either monophthongal or diphthongal pronunciations (i.e. {{IPA|[{{IPA link|i}}, {{IPA link|u}} ~ {{IPA link|ʉ}}, {{IPA link|e}}, {{IPA link|o}}]}} vs {{IPA|[ɪ̝i, ʊ̝u ~ ʊ̝̈ʉ, eɪ, oʊ]}}). The diphthongs are the most usual realizations of {{IPA|/eɪ/}} and {{IPA|/oʊ/}}, which is reflected in the way they are transcribed. In the case of {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}}, the monophthongal pronunciations are in [[free variation]] with diphthongs. Even the diphthongal pronunciations themselves vary between the very narrow (i.e. {{IPA|[ɪ̝i, ʊ̝u ~ ʊ̝̈ʉ]}}) and somewhat wider (i.e. {{IPA|[ɪi ~ ɪ̈i, ʊu ~ ʊ̈ʉ]}}), with the former being more common. As indicated in above phonetic transcriptions, the backness of {{IPA|/u/}} varies from fairly back to central; the same applies to {{IPA|/ɑ/}}, which is realized as {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɑ}} ~ {{IPA link|ä}}]}}.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|pp=476, 487}}
* Before the dark {{serif|''l''}}, {{IPA|/i, u/}} and sometimes also {{IPA|/eɪ, oʊ/}} are realized as centering diphthongs {{IPA|[iə, uə, eə, oə]}} or even as disyllabic sequences {{IPA|[i.jə, u.wə, e.jə, o.wə]}}. Therefore, words such as ''peel'' and ''fool'' and sometimes also ''rail'' and ''role'' are pronounced {{IPA|[ˈpiəɫ ~ ˈpi.jəɫ]}}, {{IPA|[ˈfuəɫ ~ ˈfu.wəɫ]}}, {{IPA|[ˈɹeəɫ ~ ˈɹe.jəɫ]}}, {{IPA|[ˈɹoəɫ ~ ˈɹo.wəɫ]}}. This can even happen word-internally before another morpheme, as in ''peeling'' {{IPA|[ˈpiəɫɪŋ ~ ˈpi.jəɫɪŋ]}} and ''fooling'' {{IPA|[ˈfuəɫɪŋ ~ ˈfu.wəɫɪŋ]}}.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=487}}
* When prosodically salient, the lax vowels {{IPA|/ɪ, ʊ, ɛ, ʌ, æ/}} tend to be realized as centering diphthongs {{IPA|[ɪə, ʊə, ɛə, ʌə, æə]}} instead of the more usual long monophthongs {{IPA|[ɪˑ, ʊˑ, ɛˑ, ʌˑ, æˑ]}} when they precede a word-final voiced consonant, so that the word ''good'' in the sentence ''that's very good!'' tends to be pronounced {{IPA|[ɡʊəd]}} instead of {{IPA|[ɡʊˑd]}}.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=485}}
* General American does not have the opposition between {{IPA|/ɜr/}} and {{IPA|/ər/}}, which are both rendered {{IPAblink|ɚ|audio=y}}; therefore, the vowels in ''further'' {{IPA|/ˈfɜrðər/}} are typically realized with the same segmental quality as {{IPA|[ˈfɚðɚ]}} {{Pronunciation|En-us-further.ogg|listen|(|help=no}}.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=121}} This also makes [[homophone|homophonous]] the words ''forward'' {{IPA|/ˈfɔrwərd/}} and ''foreword'' {{IPA|/ˈfɔrwɜrd/}} as {{IPA|[ˈfɔɹwɚd]}}, which are distinguished in Received Pronunciation as {{IPA|[ˈfɔːwəd]}} and {{IPA|[ˈfɔːwɜːd]}}, respectively.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=121}} Therefore, {{IPA|/ɜ/}} is not a true phoneme in General American but merely a different notation of {{IPA|/ə/}} preserved for when this phoneme precedes {{IPA|/r/}} and is stressed—a convention adopted in literature to facilitate comparisons with other accents.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|pp=480–1}} What is historically {{IPA|/ʌr/}}, as in ''hurry'', is also pronounced {{IPA|[ɚ]}} {{Pronunciation|En-us-er.ogg|listen|(|help=no}}, so {{IPA|/ʌ/}}, {{IPA|/ɜ/}} and {{IPA|/ə/}} are all [[Phonemic merger|neutralized]] before {{IPA|/r/}}.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|pp=480–1}} Furthermore, some analyze {{IPA|/ʌ/}} as an allophone of {{IPA|/ə/}} that surfaces when stressed, so {{IPA|/ʌ/}}, {{IPA|/ɜ/}} and {{IPA|/ə/}} may be considered to be in [[complementary distribution]] and thus comprising one phoneme.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=132}}
* The phonetic quality of {{IPA|/ʌ/}} is typically somewhat advanced {{IPAblink|ʌ|ʌ̟}}, which is still somewhat more back than the corresponding RP realization {{IPAblink|ɐ}}.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=485}}{{sfnp|Roca|Johnson|1999|p=190}}

The 2006 ''[[Atlas of North American English]]'' surmises that "if one were to recognize a type of [[North American English]] to be
called 'General American'" according to data measurements of vowel pronunciations, "it would be the configuration formed by these three" dialect regions: [[Canadian English#Standard Canadian English|Canada]], the [[Western American English|American West]], and the [[Midland American English|American Midland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvp|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following charts (as well as the one above) present the vowels that these three dialects encompass as a perceived General American sound system.

* [[æ tensing|Raising of short ''a'' before ''m'' and ''n'' sounds]]: For most speakers, the [[Traditional English short vowel|short ''a'']] sound, transcribed as {{IPAblink|æ|audio=En-us-Near-open front unrounded vowel2.ogg}}, is pronounced with the [[raising (phonetics)|tongue raised in the mouth]], followed by a backward [[diphthong|glide]], whenever occurring before a [[nasal stop|nasal consonant]] (that is, before {{IPA|/m/}}, {{IPA|/n/}} and, for some speakers, {{IPA|/ŋ/}}).&lt;ref&gt;Boberg, Charles (Spring 2001). "Phonological Status of Western New England". ''American Speech'', Volume 76, Number 1. pp. 3-29 (Article). Duke University Press. p. 11: "The vowel {{IPA|/æ/}} is generally tensed and raised [...] only before nasals, a raising environment for most speakers of North American English".&lt;/ref&gt; This sound may be narrowly transcribed as {{IPA|[ɛə]}} (as in {{Audio|En-us-Anne2.ogg|''Anne''|help=no}} and {{Audio|En-us-am.ogg|''am''|help=no}}), or, based on a specific dialect, variously as {{IPA|[eə]}} or {{IPA|[ɪə]}}. This phenomenon is called {{IPA|/æ/}}-tensing in phonological discourse.

{{/æ/ tensing in North American English|hidden=yes}}

* [[father–bother merger|''Father–bother'' merger]] ({{IPA|/ɒ/}} → {{IPA|[ɑ]}}): Nearly all American accents merge the [[Traditional English short vowel|short ''o'']] of words like ''spot'' and ''odd'' to the sound of the broad ''a'' in words like ''spa'' and ''ah''; therefore, ''sob'' and ''Saab'' are [[homophone]]s in General American.
* [[cot–caught merger|''Cot–caught'' merger]] in transition: There is no single General American way to pronounce the vowels in words like ''cot'' {{IPA|/ɑ/}} (the ''ah'' or broad ''a'' vowel) versus ''caught'' {{IPA|/ɔ/}} (the ''aw'' vowel), largely due to a merger occurring between the two sounds in some parts of North America, but not others. American speakers with a completed merger pronounce the two historically separate vowels with the [[Homophone|exact same sound]] (especially in the [[American West|West]], northern [[New England]], [[West Virginia]], [[western Pennsylvania]], and the [[Upper Midwest]]), but other speakers have no trace of a merger at all (especially in the [[American South|South]], the [[Great Lakes region]], southern [[New England]], and the [[Mid-Atlantic United States|Mid-Atlantic]] and [[New York metropolitan area]]s) and so pronounce each vowel with distinct sounds {{Pronunciation|Cot-caught distinction.ogg|listen|(|help=no}}.{{sfnp|Labov|2006|p=61}} Among speakers who distinguish between the two, the vowel of ''cot'' (usually transcribed in American English as {{IPAblink|ɑ|audio=y}}), may be [[central vowel|central]] {{IPAblink|ä|audio=y}} or advanced [[back vowel|back]] {{IPA|[ɑ̟]}}, while {{IPA|/ɔ/}} is pronounced with more rounded lips and/or phonetically higher in the mouth, close to {{IPAblink|ɒ|audio=y}} or {{IPAblink|ɔ|audio=y}}, but with only slight rounding.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=476}} Among speakers who do not distinguish between the two and are thus said to have undergone the [[cot–caught merger|''cot–caught'' merger]], {{IPA|/ɑ/}} usually remains a back vowel, {{IPA|[ɑ]}}, sometimes showing lip rounding as {{IPA|[ɒ]}}. Therefore, General American speakers vary greatly with this speech feature, with possibilities ranging from a full merger to no merger at all. In the middle of this range, a transitional stage of the merger is also common in random scatterings throughout the U.S., though especially among younger speakers and most consistently in the [[Midland American English|Midland]] region lying between the historical North and South. According to a 2003 dialect survey carried out across the United States, about 61% of participants perceive themselves as keeping the two vowels distinct and 39% do not.&lt;ref&gt;Vaux, Bert and Scott Golder (2003). "[http://www4.uwm.edu/FLL/linguistics/dialect/staticmaps/q_28.html Do you pronounce 'cot' and 'çaught' the same?]" The Harvard Dialect Survey. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Linguistics Department.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[English-language vowel changes before historic /r/|Vowel mergers before ''r'' (before a vowel)]]: General American participates in some mergers of vowel sounds only when such a vowel occurs before an {{IPA|/r/}} sound that is itself followed by another vowel ([[intervocalic]] ''r'').
** [[English-language vowel changes before historic r#Mary–marry–merry merger|''Mary–marry–merry'' merger]] in transition: According to a 2003 dialect survey of the United States, nearly 57% of participants from around the country merged the sounds {{IPA|/ær/}} (as in the first syllable of ''parish''), {{IPA|/ɛr/}} (as in the first syllable of ''perish''), and {{IPA|/ɛər/}} (as in ''pear'' or ''pair'').&lt;ref&gt;Vaux, Bert and Scott Golder (2003). "[http://www4.uwm.edu/FLL/linguistics/dialect/staticmaps/q_15.html How do you pronounce Mary / merry / marry?]" The Harvard Dialect Survey. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Linguistics Department.&lt;/ref&gt; The merger is in transition, already complete everywhere except along some areas of the Atlantic Coast.{{sfnp|Kortmann|2004|p=295}}
** [[English-language vowel changes before historic r#Hurry–furry merger|''Hurry–furry'' merger]]: The pre-''r'' vowels in words like ''hurry'' {{IPA|/ʌ/}} and ''furry'' {{IPA|/ɜ/}} are merged in most General American accents to {{IPA|[ə~ɚ]}}. Only 10% of English speakers across the U.S. acknowledge the distinct ''hurry'' vowel before {{IPA|/r/}}, according to a 2003 dialect survey.&lt;ref&gt;Vaux, Bert and Scott Golder (2003). "[http://dialect.redlog.net/staticmaps/q_12.html fl''ou''rish] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711123931/http://dialect.redlog.net/staticmaps/q_12.html |date=2015-07-11 }}". The Harvard Dialect Survey. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Linguistics Department.&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Mirror–nearer merger|''Mirror–nearer'' merger]] in transition: The pre-''r'' vowels in words like ''mirror'' {{IPA|/ɪ/}} and ''nearer'' {{IPA|/i/}} are merged or at least close in General American accents. The quality of the historic ''mirror'' vowel in the word ''miracle'' is quite variable.&lt;ref&gt;Vaux, Bert and Scott Golder (2003). "[http://www4.uwm.edu/FLL/linguistics/dialect/staticmaps/q_17.html the first vowel in "m''i''racle"]". The Harvard Dialect Survey. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Linguistics Department.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Unstressed pure vowels:
** [[Weak-vowel merger]]: {{IPA-all|ə|}} and {{IPAblink|ɪ̈|audio=En-us-Near-close central unrounded vowel2.ogg}} (also transcribed as {{IPA|[ɨ̞]}} and {{IPA|[ᵻ]}}, the latter being an unofficial IPA extension symbol) are indeterminate vowel sounds that occur only in unstressed syllables of certain types. {{IPA|[ə]}} is heard, for example, as the ''a'' at the beginning of ''about'' and at the end of ''China'', as the ''o'' in ''omit'', and as the ''u'' in ''syrup''. {{IPA|[ɪ̈]}} is heard as the ''a'' in ''private'' or ''cottage'', the ''e'' in ''evading'' or ''sorted'', the ''i'' in ''sordid'', the ''u'' in ''minute'', or the ''y'' in ''mythologist''. However, {{IPA|[ə]}} and {{IPA|[ɪ̈]}} frequently overlap and often [[weak-vowel merger|merge]] in American accents, especially towards the [[schwa]] {{IPA|[ə]}}.
** Phonetically, the schwa {{IPA|/ə/}} (as in {{sc2|COMM{{underline|A}}}}) ranges from close-mid {{IPAblink|ɘ}} to open-mid {{IPAblink|ɜ}}.{{sfnp|Wells|2008|p=XXV}}
** In environments in which the tense–lax contrast between the close vowels is neutralized, the phonetic realization of these vowels varies in [[Vowel height|height]] between close and close-mid:
*** {{IPA|/i~ɪ/}} (as in {{sc2|HAPP{{underline|Y}}}}; usually transcribed {{IPA|/i/}} even though it is not a phoneme) ranges from close front {{IPAblink|i}} to close-mid retracted front {{IPAblink|e|e̠}};{{sfnp|Wells|2008|p=XXV}}
*** {{IPA|/u~ʊ/}} (as in {{sc2|INFL{{underline|U}}ENCE}}; usually transcribed {{IPA|/u/}} even though it is not a phoneme) ranges from close advanced back {{IPAblink|u|u̟}} to close-mid retracted central {{IPAblink|ɵ|ɵ̠}}.{{sfnp|Wells|2008|p=XXV}}
* Fronting of [[Traditional English long vowel|long ''oo'']] ({{IPA|/u/}} → {{IPA|[u̟]}}): The vowel {{IPA|/u/}} (as in ''lose'', ''loose'', or ''loot'') has a unique quality in the United States {{Pronunciation|En-us-ooh.ogg|listen|(|help=no}}; it tends to be less rounded {{IPA|[u̜]}} and more [[front vowel|fronted]] {{IPA|[u̟]}}, and perhaps even [[diphthong]]ized with a somewhat fronter and [[low vowel|lower]] onset; this can be transcribed in a variety of ways.

* [[Canadian raising|Raising of the start of the long ''i'' sound before voiceless consonants]]: The [[Traditional English long vowel|long ''i'']] vowel ({{IPA|/aɪ/}}), as in ''pine'' or ''pie''—pronounced {{IPA|[aɪ]}} {{Pronunciation|en-us-eye.ogg|listen|(|help=no}} in North America—has a starting sound (an "on-glide") in which the tongue is [[raising (phonetics)|raised]] towards {{IPA|[ɐɪ]}} or {{IPA|[ʌ̈ɪ]}} whenever it appears before a [[voiceless consonant]] (such as {{IPA|/t, k, θ, s/}}, for instance, in ''pike'' or ''python''). Because of this sound change, the words ''rider'' and ''writer'' {{Pronunciation|En-us-rider-writer.ogg|listen|(|help=no}}, for instance, remain distinct from one another by virtue of their difference in height (and length) of the diphthong's starting point, even though the letters ''d'' and ''t'' represent as alveolar flaps {{IPA|[ɾ]}}. The sound-change also applies across word boundaries, though the position of a word or phrase's stress may prevent the raising from taking place. For instance, a ''high school'' in the sense of "secondary school" is generally pronounced {{IPA|[ˈhɐɪskuɫ]}}; however, a ''high school'' in the literal sense of "a tall school" would be pronounced {{IPA|[ˌhaɪˈskuɫ]}}.
:  This [[sound change]] began in the [[Northern American English|Northern]], [[New England English|New England]], and [[mid-Atlantic American English|Mid-Atlantic]] regions of the country,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Labov||Ash|Boberg|2006|p=114}}: "where Canadian raising has traditionally been reported: Canada, Eastern New England, Philadelphia, and the North"&lt;/ref&gt; and is becoming more common. This is one of the two types of so-called [[Canadian raising]], even though it occurs in the U.S. as well as in Canada.

* [[horse–hoarse merger|''Horse–hoarse'' merger]] ({{IPA|/ɔr/}} + {{IPA|/oʊr/}} → {{IPA|[ɔɹ]}}): As in most modern varieties of English around the world, words like ''war'' and ''wore'' are pronounced the same in General American English. Words with these r-colored vowels, such as ''north'' and ''horse'', are usually transcribed {{IPA|/nɔrθ/}} and {{IPA|/hɔrs/}}, but may be closer in General American English to {{IPA|[no̞ɹθ]}} and {{IPA|[ho̞ɹs]}}.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=479}} Thus, in these cases, the {{IPA|[ɔ]}} before {{IPA|/r/}} can be analyzed as an [[allophone]] of {{IPA|/oʊ/}}.
*The vowel sounds of both {{IPA|/ɜr/}} and {{IPA|/ər/}} are neutralized, resulting in both pronounced as {{IPA|[ɚ]}} {{Pronunciation|En-us-er.ogg|listen|(|help=no}}; so the vowels in ''further'' {{IPA|/ˈfɜrðər/}} are typically realized with the same segmental quality as {{IPA|[ˈfɚðɚ]}} {{Pronunciation|En-us-further.ogg|listen|(|help=no}}.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=121}}
* [[Mergers of /ɒr-/ and /ɔːr-/|"Short ''o''" before ''r'' before a vowel]]: In typical North American accents (U.S. and Canada alike), the historical sequence {{IPA|/ɒr/}} (a short ''o'' sound followed by ''r'' and then another vowel, as in ''orange'', ''forest'', ''moral'', and ''warrant'') is realized as {{IPA|[oɹ~ɔɹ]}}, thus further merging with the already-merged {{IPA|/ɔr/–/oʊr/}} ([[horse–hoarse merger|''horse''–''hoarse'']]) set. In the U.S., four words (''tom'''orr'''ow, s'''orr'''y, s'''orr'''ow, b'''orr'''ow'' and, for some speakers, ''m'''orr'''ow'') usually contain the sound {{IPA|[ɑɹ]}} instead, and merge with the {{IPA|/ɑr/}} set (thus, ''sorry'' and ''[[sari]]'' become [[homophone]]s, both rhyming with ''starry'').{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=476}}

'''Gödény-halom''' ({{lang-en|Pelican mound}}) is a [[tumulus|prehistoric mound]] situated near the village of [[Békésszentandrás]] in [[Békés County]], in the [[Southern Great Plain]] region of south-east [[Hungary]].

==Description==
Gödény-halom is situated 7 kilometres away from the inner area of Békésszentandrás, close to the old road to [[Szentes]].&lt;ref name="natty"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nemzetijelkepek.hu/onkormanyzat-bekesszentandras_en.shtml|title=Békésszentandrás (The County of Békés)|publisher=National and historical symbols of Hungary|access-date=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is in the one-time flood area of the River [[Körös|Hármas-Körös]].&lt;ref name="natty"/&gt; The name gödény ({{lang-en|pelican}}) refers to the fact that it was once a roosting spot for pelicans in the swampy area.&lt;ref name="natty"/&gt; Today, it marks the county boundaries of Békés, [[Csongrád County|Csongrád]] and [[Jász-Nagykun-Szolnok County|Szolnok]].&lt;ref name="tajjy"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tajgazda.hu/index.php/en/our-articles/112-landscapes/319-cumanian|title=The mysterious Cumanian mounds|publisher=Tajgazda|date=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the northern side has been destroyed for the building of roads and a nearby dam.&lt;ref name="natty"/&gt;

Gödény-halom is the largest of the so-called [[Cumanian mounds]] of central Europe, and the highest prehistoric mound in Hungary with a height 12.2 metres.&lt;ref name="locky"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Loczy|first=Dénes|year=2015|title=Landscapes and Landforms of Hungary|page=256|isbn=3319089978}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cumanian mounds are structures of uncertain age and origin and made by humans.&lt;ref name="tajjy"/&gt; It is generally thought that they were used as burial places in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages.&lt;ref name="locky"/&gt;

'''La Soledad de Maciel''' is a [[Mesoamerica]]n archeological site located on the [[Costa Grande of Guerrero|Costa Grande]] of the [[Mexico|Mexican]] state of [[Guerrero]], near [[Zihuatanejo]]. While pieces had been found at the site earlier, including the King of La Chole stele and [[Mesoamerican ball court]] rings, formal excavations were only recently begun. The site had been occupied for over 3,000 years and by three cultures, with contact with other Mesoamerican cultures such as the [[Teotihuacan]] and [[Olmec]]. Explored areas include what may be the largest Mesoamerican ball court, a one-hectare pyramidal base and a hill with [[petroglyph]]s and a probably sacrifice stone.

According to residents, pieces had been found in the area since the 1930s, including some of the most important but formal excavations were begun only in the very late 2000s, when authorities began to acquire lands.&lt;ref name="importantes"&gt;{{cite news |title= Ruinas de La Soledad de Maciel, tan importantes como Teotihuacán |author=Noe Dominguez Mariano |url= http://www.lajornadaguerrero.com.mx/2007/12/03/index.php?section=cultura&amp;article=010n1cul |newspaper=La Jornada de Guerrero |location=Chilpancingo |date=December 3, 2007 |accessdate=January 9, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Ruins of La Soledad de Maciel, as important as Teotihuacan }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these pieces is a stele discovered in 1944 called the King of La Chole, who was a figure that venerated. Today, this piece is at the local church. The feet of the stele was in a private home but were returned to the site for its new museum.&lt;ref name="extenso"&gt;{{cite news |title= Descubren en Petatlán el centro de juego de pelota más extenso |author=Francisco Meza |url= http://www.lajornadaguerrero.com.mx/2008/11/28/index.php?section=cultura&amp;article=020n1cul |newspaper=La Jornada de Guerrero |location=Chilpancingo |date=November 28, 2008 |accessdate=January 9, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Discovered in Petatlán the largest Mesoamerican ball court }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mexdes"&gt;{{cite journal |date=January 2006 |title=La Soledad de Maciel |journal=Mexico Desconocido  Rutas Turisticas:Guerrero  |page=57 |location=Mexico City |publisher= Grupo Editorial Impresiones Aereas SA de CV |editor1-first= Beatriz |editor1-last= Quintanar Hinojosa |language=Spanish |issn=0188-5146  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rings of the ball court were taken to the city of [[Petatlán]], along  with a circular stone representing the goddess of the Earth, [[Tlaltecutli]].&lt;ref name="importantes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mexdes"/&gt; But have now been returned to the museum at the site. But the stele will remain at the church.&lt;ref name="importantes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="extenso"/&gt;

The site is located in the municipality of Petatlán, in the small village of La Soledad de Maciel. This village is located four km south of Highway 200 at the end of a dirt road.&lt;ref name="mexdes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abierto"&gt;{{cite news |title= Sitio arqueológico La Soledad de Maciel será abierto en noviembre |author=Francisco Meza |url= http://www.lajornadaguerrero.com.mx/2010/08/01/index.php?section=cultura&amp;article=011n1cul |newspaper=La Jornada de Guerrero |location=Chilpancingo |date=August 1, 2010 |accessdate=January 9, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Archeological site of La Soledad de Maciel will be open in November. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The village has a population of about 400 inhabitants with just under eighty houses. The residents subsist on agriculture, growing corn, beans, vegetables and coconuts, supplemented by some cattle and fishing along the local shore.&lt;ref name="importantes"/&gt; The area is also known for the cultivation of tobacco and the making of handcrafted cigars.&lt;ref name="mexdes"/&gt;  The excavation of the site and construction of a museum was built from 2007 to 2010 at a cost of 12 million pesos, not only to study and preserve the site but also to provide tourist attraction to an area with limited economic possibilities.&lt;ref name="abierto"/&gt; According to the [[Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia]] the ruins could be as important as Teotihuacan or [[Chichén Itza]] as they span from the pre Classic to post Classic periods in [[Mesoamerican chronology]]. It is the largest ceremonial center and largest archeological site in the state.&lt;ref name="importantes"/&gt; The site coincides with the ancient city of Cihuatlán, which flourished  between 200 and 800 C.E. It was the largest population center between [[Acapulco]] and [[La Unión de Isidoro Montes de Oca|Zacatula]] at its height. Pieces of ornamental work in made with shells and copper indicate that this was begun here earlier than in [[Michoacán]] .&lt;ref name="extenso"/&gt;

The excavated site is likely a ceremonial center which was used by various cultures including the [[Tomile]]s, the [[Cuitateco]]s and the [[Tepozteca]]s during its history. There are surrounding settlements, so the site could extend as much as ten km2, from the Huamilule Hill to the community of Cabritero and the Chiquito River. According to the finds, the site had been occupied for more than 3,000 years and had contact with a number of other Mesoamerican cultures.&lt;ref name="importantes"/&gt; Find of ceramics and other objects at this site and other nearby sites indicate that the cultures had economic and cultural contact with Teotihuacan.&lt;ref name="piezas"&gt;{{cite news |title= Hallan en Guerrero piezas milenarias estilo teotihuacano |agency=Agencia el Universal. |newspaper=El Universal |location=Mexico City |date=August 19, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Thousand year old Teotihuacan style pieces found in Guerrero }}&lt;/ref&gt; The site contains one idol which measures 1.5 meters tall and appears to be from the Olmec period.&lt;ref name="importantes"/&gt;

'''''Million Student March''''' is a [[student protest]] movement in the [[United States of America]] involving students from campuses across the country marching in protest against high tuition fees and student debt.&lt;ref name="WhatisMSM"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is #MillionStudentMarch?

==Origin==
[[File:Bernie_Sanders,_June_2015_(18093652543).jpg|thumb|right|[[Bernie Sanders]] in June 2015. His remark in a TV interview with [[Katie Couric]] initiated the idea of mass student demonstrations for tuition-free colleges and cancellation of student debt.]]
The reasons for massive student unrest in the United States is the high rate of tuition and massive debt burden on students. The following facts on student debt are pertinent:&lt;ref name="WhatisMSM"/&gt;
*average college debt for a student from the Class of 2015 is $35,000.
*the total amount in student academic debt in the United States is $1.2 trillion which is owed by 40 million Americans. 
*58 percent of the student debt is owed by the most economically challenged quartile of American students.

The concept for the ''Million Student March'' is attributed to Senator [[Bernie Sanders]] who said :&lt;ref name="WashPost12Nov15"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2015/11/12/million-student-march-fights-for-debt-free-college/|title=Million Student March fights for debt-free college |website=The Washington Post |date=12 November 2015 |author=Danielle Douglas-Gabriel |accessdate=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38471">A '''month''' is a unit of [[time]], used with [[calendar]]s, which is approximately as long as a natural [[Orbital period|period]] related to the motion of the [[Moon]]; ''month'' and ''Moon'' are [[cognate]]s. The traditional concept arose with the cycle of [[Moon phase]]s; such months ([[lunation]]s) are [[Lunar month#Synodic month|synodic months]] and last approximately 29.53 [[day]]s.  From excavated [[tally stick]]s, researchers have deduced that people counted days in relation to the Moon's phases as early as the [[Paleolithic]] age. Synodic months, based on the Moon's [[orbital period]] with respect to the Earth-Sun line, are still the basis of many calendars&lt;!--unnecessarily generic?--&gt; today, and are used to divide the [[year]].

== Types of months in astronomy==
{{main|Lunar month}}
The following types of months are mainly of significance in astronomy, most of them (but not the distinction between sidereal and tropical months) first recognized in [[Lunar theory#Babylon|Babylonian lunar astronomy]].

# The '''sidereal month''' is defined as the Moon's [[orbital period]] in a non-rotating frame of reference (which on average is equal to its [[rotation period]] in the same frame). It is about 27.32166 days (27 days, 7 hours, 43 minutes, 11.6 seconds).  It is closely equal to the time it takes the Moon to pass twice a "fixed" [[star]] (different stars give different results because all have a very small [[proper motion]] and are not really fixed in position).
# A '''synodic month''' is the most familiar lunar cycle, defined as the time interval between two consecutive occurrences of a particular phase (such as new moon or full moon) as seen by an observer on Earth.  The mean length of the synodic month is 29.53059 days (29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes, 2.8 seconds).  Due to the eccentricity of the lunar orbit around Earth (and to a lesser degree, the Earth's elliptical orbit around the Sun), the length of a synodic month can vary by up to seven hours. 
# The '''tropical month''' is the average time for the Moon to pass twice through the same [[equinox]] point of the sky. It is '''27.32158''' days, very slightly shorter than the sidereal month (27.32166) days, because of [[precession of the equinoxes]].
# An '''anomalistic month''' is the average time the Moon takes to go from [[perigee]] to perigee - the point in the Moon's orbit when it is closest to Earth.  An anomalistic month is about 27.55455 days on average.
# The '''draconic month''', draconitic month, or nodal month is the period in which the Moon returns to the same [[lunar node|node]] of its orbit; the nodes are the two points where the Moon's orbit crosses the plane of the Earth's orbit.  Its duration is about 27.21222 days on average.

A synodic month is longer than a sidereal month because the Earth-Moon system is orbiting the Sun in the same direction as the Moon is orbiting the Earth.   The Sun moves eastward with respect to the stars (as does the Moon) and it takes about 2.2 days longer for the Moon to return to the same apparent position with respect to the Sun.

An anomalistic month is longer than a sidereal month because the perigee moves in the same direction as the Moon is orbiting the Earth, one revolution in nine years. Therefore, the Moon takes a little longer to return to perigee than to return to the same star.

A draconic month is shorter than a sidereal month because the nodes move in the opposite direction as the Moon is orbiting the Earth, one revolution in 18.6 years. Therefore, the Moon returns to the same node slightly earlier than it returns to the same star.

== Calendrical consequences ==
{{Details|lunar calendar|lunisolar calendar}}

At the simplest level, most well-known lunar calendars are based on the initial approximation that 2 lunations last 59 days: a 30-day '''full month''' followed by a 29-day '''hollow month''' — but this is only roughly accurate, and eventually needs correction by using larger cycles, or the equivalent of [[leap day]]s. Additionally, the synodic month does not fit easily into the year, which makes accurate, rule-based lunisolar calendars complicated. The most common solution to this problem is the [[Metonic cycle]], which takes advantage of the fact that 235 lunations are approximately 19 [[tropical year]]s (which add up to not quite 6940 days). However, a Metonic calendar will drift against the seasons by about 1 day every 200 years. Metonic calendars include the calendar used in the [[Antikythera Mechanism]] about 2000 years ago, and the [[Hebrew calendar]].

The complexity required in an accurate lunisolar calendar may explain why [[solar calendar]]s (which have months which no longer relate to the phase of the Moon, but are based only on the motion of the Sun relative to the equinoxes and solstices) have generally replaced lunar calendars for civil use in most societies.

== Months in various calendars ==

=== Beginning of the lunar month ===
The [[Hellenic calendars]], the [[Hebrew calendar|Hebrew Lunisolar calendar]] and the [[Islamic calendar|Islamic Lunar calendar]] started the month with the first appearance of the thin crescent of the [[new moon]].

However, the motion of the Moon in its [[orbit]] is very complicated and its period is not constant. The date and time of this actual observation depends on the exact geographical longitude as well as latitude, atmospheric conditions, the visual acuity of the observers, etc. Therefore, the beginning and lengths of months defined by observation cannot be accurately predicted.

While some like the Jewish [[Karaite (Jewish sect)|Karaites]] still rely on actual moon observations, most people use the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian solar calendar]].

[[Pingelapese language|Pingelapese]], a language from [[Micronesia]], also uses a lunar calendar. There are 12 months associated with their calendar. The moon first appears in March, they name this month ''Kahlek''. This system has been used for hundreds of years and throughout many generations. This calendar is cyclical and relies on the position and shape of the moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pingelap Non-Sacred Knowledge|last=Solomon|first=Stenson|publisher=Historic Preservation Fund Grant Department of Land and Natural Resources|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Julian and Gregorian calendars ===
The [[Gregorian calendar]], like the [[Julian calendar]] before it, has twelve months:

[[File:Month - Knuckles (en).svg|thumb|300px|On top of the knuckles (yellow): 31 days&lt;br /&gt;Between the knuckles (blue): 30 days&lt;br /&gt;February (red) has 28 or 29 days.]]
[[File:Klaviatur-3-en.svg|thumb|300px|The white keys of the musical keyboard correlate to months with 31 days. ('F' correlates to January.)]]
The mean month length of the Gregorian calendar is 30.436875 days.

Months existing in the [[Roman calendar]] in the past include:
* [[Intercalaris|the ''mensis intercalaris'']], an occasional month after February to realign the calendar.
* [[Quintilis]], renamed to July in honour of [[Julius Caesar]].
* [[Sextilis]], renamed to August in honour of [[Augustus]].

The famous [[mnemonic]] ''[[Thirty days hath September]]'' is a common way of teaching the lengths of the months in the English-speaking world.

Also, note that any five consecutive months (not including February) contain 153 days.

The knuckles of the four fingers of one's hand and the spaces between them can be used to remember the lengths of the months. By making a fist, each month will be listed as one proceeds across the hand. All months landing on a knuckle are 31 days long and those landing between them are not. When the knuckle of the index finger is reached (July), go back to the first knuckle (or over to the first knuckle on the other fist, held next to the first) and continue with August. This physical mnemonic has been taught to primary school students for many decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eudesign.com/mnems/dayspcm.htm |title=Days in each Month |work=Mnemonics to Improve Memory |year=1997 |access-date=8 August 2018 |publisher=EUdesign}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.fullbooks.com/The-Boy-Mechanic-Volume-17.html |title=The Boy Mechanic: A Handy Calendar |year=1913 |work=[[Project Gutenberg]] |volume=1 |via=Full Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This cyclical pattern of month lengths matches the [[musical keyboard]] alternation of white and black keys (with the note 'F' correlating to the month of January).

==== Calends, nones, and ides ====
The '''[[ides (calendar)|ides]]''' occur on the thirteenth day in eight of the months, but in March, May, July, and October, they occur on the fifteenth. The '''[[Roman calendar#Months|nones]]''' always occur 8 days (one Roman week) before the ides, i.e., on the fifth or the seventh. The '''[[calends]]''' are always the first day of the month, and before Julius Caesar's reform fell sixteen days (two Roman weeks) after the ides (except the ides of February and the intercalary month).

=== Hebrew calendar ===
The [[Hebrew calendar]] has 12 or 13 months.
# [[Nisan]], 30 days ניסן
# [[Iyar]], 30 days אייר
# [[Sivan]], 30 days סיון
# [[Tammuz (Hebrew month)|Tammuz]], 29 days תמוז
# [[Av]], 30 days אב
# [[Elul]], 29 days אלול
# [[Tishri]], 30 days תשרי
# [[Marcheshvan]], 29/30 days מַרְחֶשְׁוָן
# [[Kislev]], 30/29 days כסלו
# [[Tevet]], 29 days טבת
# [[Shevat]], 30 days שבט
# [[Adar 1]], 30 days, [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalary]] month אדר א
# [[Adar 2]], 29 days אדר ב

Adar 1 is only added 7 times in 19 years. In ordinary years, Adar 2 is simply called Adar.

=== Islamic calendar ===
There are also twelve months in the Islamic calendar. They are named as follows:
# [[Muharram]] (Restricted/sacred)  محرّم
# [[Safar]] (Empty/Yellow)  صفر
# [[Rabi' al-awwal|Rabī' al-Awwal]]/Rabi' I (First Spring)  ربيع الأول
# [[Rabī’ al-Thānī|Rabī’ ath-Thānī]]/Rabi` al-Aakhir/Rabi' II (Second spring or Last spring)  ربيع الآخر أو ربيع الثاني
# [[Jumada al-Awwal]]/Jumaada I (First Freeze)  جمادى الأول
# [[Jumada al-Thani|Jumada ath-Thānī]] or Jumādā al-Thānī/Jumādā II (Second Freeze or Last Freeze)  جمادى الآخر أو جمادى الثاني
# [[Rajab]] (To Respect)  رجب
# [[Sha'ban|Sha'bān]] (To Spread and Distribute)  شعبان
# [[Ramadan|Ramadān]] (Parched Thirst)  رمضان
# [[Shawwal|Shawwāl]] (To Be Light and Vigorous)  شوّال
# [[Dhu al-Qi'dah]] (The Master of Truce)  ذو القعدة
# [[Dhu al-Hijjah]] (The Possessor of Hajj)  ذو الحجة

These are also the names used in the [[Indian national calendar]] for the newly redefined months. Purushottam Maas or Adhik Maas ([[Romanisation of Hindi|translit.]] ''{{lang|hi-Latn|adhika}}'' = 'extra', ''{{lang|hi-Latn|māsa}}'' = 'month') is an extra month in the [[Hindu calendar]] that is inserted to keep the [[Lunar calendar|lunar]] and [[solar calendar]]s aligned.  "Purushottam" is an epithet of [[Vishnu]], to whom the month is dedicated.

The names in the solar calendar are just the names of the [[zodiac]] sign in which the sun travels. They are

=== Germanic calendar ===
{{main|Germanic calendar}}
The old Icelandic calendar is not in official use anymore, but some Icelandic holidays and annual feasts are still calculated from it. It has 12 months, broken down into two groups of six often termed "winter months" and "summer months". The calendar is peculiar in that the months always start on the same [[weekday]] rather than on the same [[calendar date|date]]. Hence Þorri always starts on a Friday sometime between January 22 and January 28 ''&lt;small&gt;([[Julian calendar|Old style]]: January 9 to January 15)&lt;/small&gt;'', Góa always starts on a Sunday between February 21 and February 27 ''&lt;small&gt;([[Julian calendar|Old style]]: February 8 to February 14)&lt;/small&gt;''.
* Skammdegi ("Short days")
# Gormánuður (mid October - mid November, "slaughter month" or "[[Gór]]'s month")
# Ýlir (mid November - mid December, "[[Yule]] month")
# Mörsugur (mid December - mid January, "fat sucking month")
# Þorri (mid January - mid February, "frozen snow month")
# Góa (mid February - mid March, "Góa's month, see [[Nór]]")
# Einmánuður (mid March - mid April, "lone" or "single month")

* Náttleysi ("Nightless days")
# [[Harpa]] (mid April - mid May, Harpa is a female name, probably a forgotten goddess, first day of Harpa is celebrated as [[Sumardagurinn fyrsti]] - first day of summer)
# Skerpla (mid May - mid June, another forgotten goddess)
# Sólmánuður (mid June - mid July, "[[sun]] month")
# Heyannir (mid July - mid August, "[[hay]] business month")
# Tvímánuður (mid August - mid September, "two" or "second month")
# Haustmánuður (mid September - mid October, "autumn month")

Like the Old Norse calendar, the [[Anglo-Saxons]] had their own calendar before they were [[Christianized]] which reflected native traditions and deities. These months were attested by [[Bede]] in his works ''On Chronology'' and ''[[The Reckoning of Time]]'' written in the 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wuffings.co.uk/OECalendar.htm |title=The Old English Calendar |year=2000 |access-date=8 August 2018 |first=Dr Sam |last=Newton |work=Wuffings}}&lt;/ref&gt; His months are probably those as written in the [[Northumbrian dialect]] of [[Old English]] which he was familiar with. The months were so named after the moon; the new moon marking the end of an old month and start of a new month; the [[full moon]] occurring in the middle of the month, after which the month was named.

The ancient civil Egyptian calendar had a year that was 365 days long and was divided into 12 months of 30 days each, plus 5 extra days (epagomenes) at the end of the year. The months were divided into 3 "weeks" of ten days each. Because the ancient Egyptian year was almost a quarter of a day shorter than the solar year and stellar events "wandered" through the calendar, it is referred to as Annus Vagus or "Wandering Year".

=== French Republican calendar ===
{{main|French Republican calendar}}
This calendar was proposed during the French Revolution, and used by the French government for about twelve years from late 1793. There were twelve months of 30 days each, grouped into three ten-day weeks called ''décades''. The five or six extra days needed to approximate the tropical year were placed after the months at the end of each year. A period of four years ending on a leap day was to be called a ''Franciade''. It began at the autumn equinox:
* Autumn:
#[[Vendémiaire]]
#[[Brumaire]]
#[[Frimaire]]
* Winter:
#[[Nivôse]]
#[[Pluviôse]]
#[[Ventôse]]
* Spring:
#[[Germinal (French Republican Calendar)|Germinal]]
#[[Floréal]]
#[[Prairial]]
* Summer:
#[[Messidor]]
#[[Thermidor]]
#[[Fructidor]]

==Adhik Maas==
Purushottam Maas or [[Adhik Maas]] is an extra month in the [[Hindu calendar]] that is inserted to keep the [[Lunar calendar|lunar]] and [[solar calendar]]s aligned.

A '''narrative thread''', or '''plot thread''' (or, more ambiguously, a '''storyline'''), refers to particular elements and techniques of writing to center the story in the action or experience of characters rather than to relate a matter in a dry "all-knowing" sort of narration. Thus the narrative threads experienced by different but specific characters or sets of characters are those seen in the eyes of those characters that together form a [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] element or [[subplot]] in the [[Fiction|work of fiction]]. In this sense, each narrative thread is the [[narrative]] portion of a work that pertains to the world view of the participating characters cognizant of their piece of the whole, and they may be the villains, the protagonists, a supporting character, or a relatively disinterested official utilized by the author, each thread of which is woven together by the writer to create a work.

By utilizing different threads, the writer enables the reader to get pieces of the overall plot while positioning them to identify with the characters  or experience the situation as if the reader were part of or eavesdropping upon the action the writer is divulging. This aids in the [[suspension of disbelief]] and engages the reader into the story as it develops.

A classic structure of narrative thread often used in both fiction and non-fiction writing is the [[monomyth]], or [[hero's journey]], with a beginning, a middle, and an end. First, typically the harmony of daily life is broken by a particularly dramatic event that leads into the main story. Then, second, the plot builds to a point of no return, from where the protagonist – who need not be a person but may be an organization or a community – has no choice but to deal with matters, and thus is tested. At this point, characteristically, there is conflict and the conflict intensifies. Third, and finally, harmony is reestablished by the conflict being solved, or at least explained in the case of non-fiction.

{{Culture of Romania}}
The '''National Register of Historic Monuments''' ({{lang-ro|'''Lista Monumentelor Istorice (LMI)'''}}) is the official English name of the [[Romania]] government's list of [[National Heritage Site]]s known as [[Monument istoric|Monumente istorice]]. In Romania, these include sites, buildings, structures, and objects considered worthy of preservation due to the importance of their Romanian [[cultural heritage]]. The list,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cultura.ro/page/43 The official list of Historical Monuments] at the Romanian Institute for National Cultural Heritage&lt;/ref&gt; created in 2004, contains places that have been designated by the [[Ministry of Culture and National Patrimony (Romania)|Ministry of Culture and National Patrimony]] of Romania and are maintained by the [[Romanian National Institute of Historical Monuments]], as being of national historic significance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inmi.ro/index.html The National Institute of Historical Monuments]&lt;/ref&gt; 
==Historical monuments in Romania per county==
{{Main|List of historical monuments in Romania}}

As of 2010, there are 29,540 entries listed individually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arhiva.cultura.ro/Files/GenericFiles/LMI-2010.pdf 2010 List of Historical Monuments] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322203044/http://arhiva.cultura.ro/Files/GenericFiles/LMI-2010.pdf |date=22 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, 2,621 are in [[Bucharest]]; 1,630 in [[Iaşi County|Iaşi]]; 1,381 in [[Cluj County|Cluj]]; 1,239 in [[Dâmboviţa County|Dâmboviţa]]; 1,069 in [[Prahova County|Prahova]]; 1,023 in [[Argeş County|Argeş]]; 1,017 in [[Mureş County|Mureş]]; 1,014 in [[Sibiu County|Sibiu]]; 983 in [[Braşov County|Braşov]]; 865 in [[Buzău County|Buzău]]; 833 in [[Caraş-Severin County|Caraş-Severin]]; 790 in [[Vâlcea County|Vâlcea]]; 765 in [[Bistriţa-Năsăud County|Bistriţa-Năsăud]]; 758 in [[Olt County|Olt]]; 740 in [[Harghita County|Harghita]]; 724 in [[Ilfov County|Ilfov]]; 699 in [[Dolj County|Dolj]]; 684 in [[Constanţa County|Constanţa]]; 679 in [[Alba County|Alba]]; 588 in [[Covasna County|Covasna]]; 582 in [[Maramureş County|Maramureş]]; 569 in [[Mehedinţi County|Mehedinţi]]; 567 in [[Tulcea County|Tulcea]]; 544 in [[Sălaj County|Sălaj]]; 542 in [[Giurgiu County|Giurgiu]]; 537 in [[Neamţ County|Neamţ]]; 520 in [[Hunedoara County|Hunedoara]]; 517 in [[Suceava County|Suceava]]; 509 in [[Botoşani County|Botoşani]]; 501 in [[Gorj County|Gorj]]; 435 in [[Bihor County|Bihor]]; 434 in [[Vaslui County|Vaslui]]; 427 in [[Vrancea County|Vrancea]]; 413 in [[Arad County|Arad]]; 393 in [[Teleorman County|Teleorman]]; 364 in [[Bacău County|Bacău]]; 338 in [[Timiş County|Timiş]]; 310 in [[Satu Mare County|Satu Mare]]; 284 in [[Călăraşi County|Călăraşi]]; 263 in [[Galați County|Galaţi]]; 218 in [[Ialomiţa County|Ialomiţa]]; 171 in [[Brăila County|Brăila]].

==LMI Code==
The ''LMI code'' (List of the Historical Monuments code) identifies uniquely an historical monument or archaeological site, and includes, in this order:
* [[Counties of Romania|Romanian county]] code, using [[ISO 3166-2:RO]]
* A Roman numeral indicating the type of monument:
** I: archaeological
** II: architectural
** III: public monuments (e. g. statues)
** IV: memorials and gravestones
* A lowercase letter: ''m'' for an individual monument, ''a'' for an ensemble and ''s'' for an archaeological site
* A capital letter: A for monuments of national interest, B for local interest
* A five-digit serial number. If the site is part of an ensemble, this is indicated by a decimal point followed by 01, 02, and so forth.

For example, IS-II-a-A-03806 is the LMI code for [[Cetățuia Monastery]]. IS indicates the site is in [[Iași County]]. II indicates it is an architectural monument, a that it is an ensemble, A that it is of national interest, and 03806 is its unique code. The ensemble has six individual sites, so for instance the monastery's bell tower, the fifth site listed, has code IS-II-m-A-03806.05.

Sites may also have a RAN Code, indicating they are part of the National Archaeological Record (''Repertoriul Arheologic Național''), a register including sites with archaeological potential, sites where archaeological excavations have taken place or ruined archaeological sites.

'''Nicolae Iorga''' ({{IPA-ro|nikoˈla.e ˈjorɡa}}; sometimes '''Neculai Iorga''', '''Nicolas Jorga''', '''Nicolai Jorga''' or '''Nicola Jorga''', born '''Nicu N. Iorga''';&lt;ref name="ivxxvii"&gt;Iova, p. xxvii.&lt;/ref&gt; January 17, 1871 – November 27, 1940) was a [[Romania]]n historian, politician, literary critic, memoirist, poet and playwright. Co-founder (in 1910) of the [[Democratic Nationalist Party (Romania)|Democratic Nationalist Party]] (PND), he served as a member of [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]], President of the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Deputies' Assembly]] and [[Senate of Romania|Senate]], cabinet minister and briefly (1931–32) as [[Prime Minister of Romania|Prime Minister]]. A [[child prodigy]], [[polymath]] and [[polyglot (person)|polyglot]], Iorga produced an unusually large body of scholarly works, consecrating his international reputation as a [[Medievalism|medievalist]], [[Byzantine studies|Byzantinist]], [[Romance studies|Latinist]], [[Slavic studies|Slavist]], [[Art history|art historian]] and [[Philosophy of history|philosopher of history]]. Holding teaching positions at the [[University of Bucharest]], the [[University of Paris]] and several other academic institutions, Iorga was founder of the [[International Congress of Byzantine Studies]] and the [[Institute of South-East European Studies]] (ISSEE). His activity also included the transformation of [[Vălenii de Munte]] town into a cultural and academic center.

In parallel with his scientific contributions, Nicolae Iorga was a prominent [[Right-wing politics|right-of-center]] activist, whose political theory bridged [[conservatism]], [[Romanian nationalism]], and [[agrarianism]]. From [[Marxism|Marxist]] beginnings, he switched sides and became a maverick disciple of the ''[[Junimea]]'' movement. Iorga later became a leadership figure at ''[[Sămănătorul]]'', the influential literary magazine with [[Populism|populist]] leanings, and militated within the [[Cultural League for the Unity of All Romanians]], founding vocally conservative publications such as ''[[Neamul Românesc]]'', ''[[Drum Drept]]'', ''[[Cuget Clar]]'' and ''[[Floarea Darurilor]]''. His support for the cause of [[Romanians|ethnic Romanians]] in [[Austria-Hungary]] made him a prominent figure in the pro-[[Allies of World War I|Entente]] camp by the time of [[World War I]], and ensured him a special political role during the [[interwar]] existence of [[Greater Romania]]. Initiator of large-scale campaigns to defend [[Culture of Romania|Romanian culture]] in front of perceived threats, Iorga sparked most controversy with his [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] rhetoric, and was for long an associate of the [[far right]] ideologue [[A. C. Cuza]]. He was an adversary of the dominant [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberals]], later involved with the opposition [[Romanian National Party]].

Late in his life, Iorga opposed the radically [[Fascism|fascist]] [[Iron Guard]], and, after much oscillation, came to endorse its rival [[King of Romania|King]] [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]]. Involved in a personal dispute with the Guard's leader [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]], and indirectly contributing to his killing, Iorga was also a prominent figure in Carol's [[Corporatism|corporatist]] and [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] party, the [[National Renaissance Front]]. He remained an independent voice of opposition after the Guard inaugurated its own [[National Legionary State|National Legionary]] dictatorship, but was ultimately assassinated by a Guardist [[commando]].

==Biography==

===Child prodigy and Marxist militant===
[[File:Casa memorială Nicolae Iorga, Botoșani.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Memorial house in [[Botoșani]]]]

Nicolae Iorga was a native of [[Botoșani]], and is generally believed to have been born on January 17, 1871 (although his birth certificate has June 6).&lt;ref&gt;Iova, p. xxvii. See also Nastasă (2003), p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; His father Nicu Iorga (a practicing lawyer) and mother Zulnia (née Arghiropol) belonged to the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref name="ivxxvii"/&gt; Details on the family's more distant origins remain uncertain: Iorga was widely reputed to be of partial [[Greeks of Romania|Greek-Romanian]] descent; the rumor, still credited by some commentators,&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Z. Ornea]], [http://www.romlit.ro/receptarea_dramaturgiei_lui_caragiale "Receptarea dramaturgiei lui Caragiale"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 31/2001&lt;/ref&gt; was rejected by the historian. In his own account: "My father was from a family of [[Romanians|Romanian]] traders from Botoșani, who were later received into the [[boyar]] class, while my mother is the daughter of Romanian writer Elena Drăghici, the niece of chronicler [[Manolache Drăghici]]&amp;nbsp;... The [Greek] name Arghiropol notwithstanding, my maternal grandfather [was] from a family that moved in&amp;nbsp;... from [[Bessarabia]]".&lt;ref name="dhscrisori"&gt;{{ro icon}} Dumitru Hîncu, [http://www.romlit.ro/scrisori_de_la_n._iorga_e._lovinescu_g._m._zamfirescu_b._fundoianu_camil_baltazar_petru_comarnescu "Scrisori de la N. Iorga, E. Lovinescu, G. M. Zamfirescu, B. Fundoianu, Camil Baltazar, Petru Comarnescu"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 42/2009&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, however, he acknowledged that the Arghiropols were possibly [[Byzantine Greeks]].&lt;ref&gt;Rădulescu, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt; Iorga credited the five-generation-boyar status, received from his father's side, and the "old boyar" roots of his mother (the Miclescu family), with having turned him into a political man.&lt;ref&gt;Rădulescu, pp. 344, 351&lt;/ref&gt; His parallel claim of being related to noble families such as the [[Cantacuzino family|Cantacuzinos]] and the [[Craiovești]] is questioned by other researchers.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2003), p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1876, aged thirty-seven or thirty-eight, Nicu Sr. was incapacitated by an unknown illness and died, leaving Nicolae and his younger brother George orphans—a loss which, the historian would recall in writing, dominated the image he had of his own childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Iova, p. xxvii–xxviii. See also Nastasă (2003), pp. 61–62, 66, 74–75&lt;/ref&gt; In 1878, he was enlisted at the Marchian Folescu School, where, as he took pride in noting, he excelled in most areas, discovering a love for intellectual pursuits and, by age nine, even being allowed by his teachers to lecture his schoolmates in Romanian history.&lt;ref&gt;Iova, p. xxviii–xxix&lt;/ref&gt; His history teacher, a [[Great Emigration|refugee Pole]], sparked his interest in research and his lifelong [[Polonophilia]].&lt;ref name="nmpolonia"&gt;{{ro icon}} Nicolae Mareș, [http://www.romlit.ro/nicolae_iorga_despre_polonia "Nicolae Iorga despre Polonia"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 35/2009&lt;/ref&gt; Iorga also credited this earliest formative period with having shaped his lifelong views on [[Romanian language]] and [[Culture of Romania|local culture]]: "I learned Romanian&amp;nbsp;... as it was spoken back in the day: plainly, beautifully and above all resolutely and colorfully, without the intrusions of newspapers and best-selling books".&lt;ref name="ivxxviii"&gt;Iova, p. xxviii&lt;/ref&gt; He credited the 19th century polymath [[Mihail Kogălniceanu]], whose works he had first been reading as a child, with having shaped this literary preference.&lt;ref name="ivxxviii"/&gt;

A student at Botoșani's [[A. T. Laurian National College|A. T. Laurian]] [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] and high school after 1881, the young Iorga received top honors, and, beginning 1883, began tutoring some of his colleagues to increase his family's main revenue (according to Iorga, a "miserable pension of pittance").&lt;ref&gt;Iova, pp. xxix–xxx&lt;/ref&gt; Aged thirteen, while on extended visit to his maternal uncle Emanuel "Manole" Arghiropol, he also made his press debut with paid contributions to Arghiropol's ''Romanul''&lt;!-- sic --&gt; newspaper, including [[anecdote]]s and editorial pieces on European politics.&lt;ref&gt;Iova, p. xxix&lt;/ref&gt; The year 1886 was described by Iorga as "the catastrophe of my school life in Botoșani": on temporary suspension for not having greeted a teacher, Iorga opted to leave the city and apply for the [[Iași National College|National High School]] ([[:ro:Colegiul Național din Iași|ro]]) of [[Iași]], being received into the [[scholarship]] program and praised by his new principal, the philologist [[Vasile Burlă]].&lt;ref&gt;Iova, pp. xxix–xxxi&lt;/ref&gt; The adolescent was already fluent in [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]], later referring to [[Hellenic studies|Greek studies]] as "the most refined form of human reasoning".&lt;ref name="ivxxx"&gt;Iova, p. xxx&lt;/ref&gt;

By age seventeen, Iorga was becoming more rebellious. This was the time when he first grew interested in political activities, but displaying convictions which he later strongly disavowed: a self-confessed [[Marxism|Marxist]], Iorga promoted the [[left-wing]] magazine ''[[Viața Socială]]'', and lectured on ''[[Das Kapital]]''.&lt;ref name="ivxxx"/&gt; Seeing himself confined in the National College's "ugly and disgusting" [[boarding school]], he defied its rules and was suspended a second time, losing scholarship privileges.&lt;ref name="ivxxxi"&gt;Iova, p. xxxi&lt;/ref&gt; Before readmission, he decided not to fall back on his family's financial support, and instead returned to tutoring others.&lt;ref name="ivxxxi"/&gt; Again expelled for reading during a teacher's lesson, Iorga still graduated in the top "first prize" category (with a 9.24 average) and subsequently took his [[Romanian Baccalaureate|Baccalaureate]] with honors.&lt;ref&gt;Iova, p .xxxi.

In 1888, Nicolae Iorga passed his entry examination for the [[University of Iași]] Faculty of Letters, becoming eligible for a scholarship soon after.&lt;ref&gt;Iova, p. xxxi; Nastasă (2003), p. 61–62&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the completion of his second term, he also received a special dispensation from the [[Kingdom of Romania]]'s [[Ministry of Education, Research and Innovation (Romania)|Education Ministry]], and, as a result, applied for and passed his third term examinations, effectively graduating one year ahead of his class.&lt;ref&gt;Iova, p. xxxi; Nastasă (2003), pp. 62–64; (2007), pp. 244, 399&lt;/ref&gt; Before the end of the year, he also passed his license examination ''[[magna cum laude]]'', with a thesis on [[Greek literature]], an achievement which consecrated his reputation inside both academia and the public sphere.&lt;ref name="ivxxxii"&gt;Iova, p. xxxii&lt;/ref&gt; Hailed as a "morning star" by the local press and deemed a "wonder of a man" by his teacher [[A. D. Xenopol]], Iorga was honored by the faculty with a special banquet. Three academics (Xenopol, [[Nicolae Culianu]], [[Ioan Caragiani]]) formally brought Iorga to the attention of the Education Ministry, proposing him for the state-sponsored program which allowed academic achievers to study abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Iova, p. xxxii. See also Nastasă (2003), pp. 62–63, 174–175; (2007), pp. 238–239&lt;/ref&gt;

The interval witnessed Iorga's brief affiliation with ''[[Junimea]]'', a literary club with [[Conservatism|conservative]] leanings, whose informal leader was literary and political theorist [[Titu Maiorescu]]. In 1890, literary critic [[Ștefan Vârgolici]] and cultural promoter [[Iacob Negruzzi]] published Iorga's essay on poet [[Veronica Micle]] in the ''Junimist'' tribune ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Iova, p. xxxii. See also Nastasă (2007), pp. 521, 528; Ornea (1998), p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Having earlier attended the funeral of writer [[Ion Creangă]], a dissident ''Junimist'' and [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]] classic, he took a public stand against the defamation of another such figure, the dramatist [[Ion Luca Caragiale]], groundlessly accused of [[plagiarism]] by journalist [[Constantin Al. Ionescu-Caion]].&lt;ref&gt;Iova, p. xxxii. See also Nastasă (2003), p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; He expanded his contribution as an opinion journalist, publishing with some regularity in various local or national periodicals of various leanings, from the socialist ''[[Contemporanul]]'' and ''[[Era Nouă]]'' to [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]]'s ''Revista Nouă''.&lt;ref&gt;Iova, p. xxxii. See also Călinescu, p. 988&lt;/ref&gt; This period saw his debut as a [[Socialism|socialist]] poet (in ''Contemporanul'') and critic (in both ''[[Lupta]]'' and ''[[Literatură și Știință]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Constantin Kirițescu]], "''O viață, o lume, o epocă'': Ani de ucenicie în mișcarea socialistă", in ''[[Magazin Istoric]]'', September 1977, pp. 14, 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1890, Iorga married Maria Tasu, whom he was to divorce in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Iova, pp. xxxii, xxxvii; Nastasă (2003), pp. 61, 64–71, 74, 105, 175&lt;/ref&gt; He had previously been in love with an Ecaterina C. Botez, but, after some hesitation, decided to marry into the family of ''Junimea'' man Vasile Tasu, much better situated in the social circles.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2003), pp. 64–66, 69–70, 74, 175&lt;/ref&gt; Xenopol, who was Iorga's matchmaker,&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2003), p. 175; (2007), pp. 239, 489&lt;/ref&gt; also tried to obtain for Iorga a teaching position at Iași University. The attempt was opposed by other professors, on grounds of Iorga's youth and politics.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 239. See also Vianu, Vol. I, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Iorga was briefly a high school professor of Latin in the southern city of [[Ploiești]], following a public competition overseen by writer [[Alexandru Odobescu]].&lt;ref name="ivxxxii"/&gt; The time he spent there allowed him to expand his circle of acquaintances and personal friends, meeting writers Caragiale and [[Alexandru Vlahuță]], historians Hasdeu and [[Grigore Tocilescu]], and Marxist theorist [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]].&lt;ref name="ivxxxii"/&gt;

===Studies abroad===

Having received the scholarship early in the year, he made his first study trips to [[Italy]] (April and June 1890), and subsequently left for a longer stay in [[France]], enlisting at the ''[[École pratique des hautes études]]''.&lt;ref name="ivxxxii"/&gt; He was a contributor for the ''[[Encyclopédie française]]'', personally recommended there by [[Slavic studies|Slavist]] [[Louis Léger]].&lt;ref name="ivxxxii"/&gt; Reflecting back on this time, he stated: "I never had as much time at my disposal, as much freedom of spirit, as much joy of learning from those great figures of mankind&amp;nbsp;... than back then, in that summer of 1890".&lt;ref&gt;Iova, pp. xxxii–xxxiii&lt;/ref&gt; While preparing for his second diploma, Iorga also pursued his interest in philology, learning English, [[German language|German]], and rudiments of other [[Germanic languages]].&lt;ref name="ivxxxiii"&gt;Iova, p. xxxiii&lt;/ref&gt; In 1892, he was in [[England]] and in Italy, researching historical sources for his French-language thesis on [[Philippe de Mézières]], a Frenchman in the [[Alexandrian Crusade|Crusade of 1365]].&lt;ref name="ivxxxiii"/&gt; In tandem, he became a contributor to ''[[Revue Historique]]'', a leading French academic journal.&lt;ref name="ivxxxiii"/&gt;

Somewhat dissatisfied with [[Education in France|French education]],&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2003), pp. 154, 233–234; (2007), pp. 179–180, 201–202&lt;/ref&gt; Iorga presented his dissertation and, in 1893, left for the [[German Empire]], attempting to enlist in the [[University of Berlin]]'s [[Ph.D.]] program. His working paper, on [[Thomas III of Saluzzo]], was not received, because Iorga had not spent three years in training, as required. As an alternative, he gave formal pledge that the paper in question was entirely his own work, but his statement was invalidated by technicality: Iorga's work had been redacted by a more proficient speaker of German, whose intervention did not touch the substance of Iorga's research.&lt;ref name="ivxxxiii"/&gt; The ensuing controversy led him to apply for a [[University of Leipzig]] Ph.D.: his text, once reviewed by a commission grouping three prominent German scholars ([[Adolf Birch-Hirschfeld]], [[Karl Gotthard Lamprecht]], [[Charles Wachsmuth]]), earned him the needed diploma in August.&lt;ref&gt;Iova, pp. xxxiii–xxxiv&lt;/ref&gt; On July 25, Iorga had also received his ''École pratique'' diploma for the earlier work on de Mézières, following its review by [[Gaston Paris]] and [[Charles Bémont]].&lt;ref name="ivxxxiii"/&gt; He spent his time further investigating the historical sources, at archives in [[Berlin]], [[Leipzig]] and [[Dresden]].&lt;ref name="ivxxxiv"&gt;Iova, p. xxxiv&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1890 and the end of 1893, he had published three works: his debut in poetry (''Poezii'', "Poems"), the first volume of ''Schițe din literatura română'' ("Sketches on Romanian Literature", 1893; second volume 1894), and his Leipzig thesis, printed in [[Paris]] as ''Thomas III, marquis de Saluces. Étude historique et littéraire'' ("Thomas, Margrave of Saluzzo. Historical and Literary Study").&lt;ref&gt;Iova, pp. xxxiv–xxxv. See also Călinescu, p. 1010&lt;/ref&gt;

Living in poor conditions (as reported by visiting scholar [[Teohari Antonescu]]),&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2003), pp. 66–68&lt;/ref&gt; the four-year engagement of his scholarship still applicable, Nicolae Iorga decided to spend his remaining time abroad, researching more city archives in Germany ([[Munich]]), [[Austria]] ([[Innsbruck]]) and Italy ([[Florence]], [[Milan]], [[Naples]], [[Rome]], [[Venice]] etc.).&lt;ref name="ivxxxiv"/&gt; In this instance, his primordial focus was on historical figures from his Romanian homeland, the defunct [[Danubian Principalities]] of [[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]]: the [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Moldavian Prince]] [[Peter the Lame]], his son Ștefăniță, and Romania's national hero, the [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Wallachian Prince]] [[Michael the Brave]].&lt;ref name="ivxxxiv"/&gt; He also met, befriended and often collaborated with fellow historians from European countries other than Romania: the editors of ''[[Revue de l'Orient Latin]]'', who first published studies Iorga later grouped in the six volumes of ''Notes et extraits'' ("Notices and Excerpts") and [[Frantz Funck-Brentano]], who enlisted his parallel contribution for ''Revue Critique''.&lt;ref&gt;Iova, p. xxxiv. See also Setton, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; Iorga's articles were also featured in two magazines for [[Romanians|ethnic Romanian]] communities in [[Austria-Hungary]]: ''[[Familia (literary magazine)|Familia]]'' and ''[[Vatra (Romanian magazine)|Vatra]]''.&lt;ref name="ivxxxiv"/&gt;

===Return to Romania===
Making his comeback to Romania in October 1894, Iorga settled in the capital city of [[Bucharest]]. He changed residence several times, until eventually settling in [[Grădina Icoanei]] area.&lt;ref name="apbucurestii"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Andrei Pippidi]], [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/sectiune/bordeie-obiceie/articol/bucurestii-lui-n-iorga "Bucureștii lui N. Iorga"], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Nr. 341, August–September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He agreed to compete in a sort of debating society, with lectures which only saw print in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. III, p. 62–68&lt;/ref&gt; He applied for the Medieval History Chair at the [[University of Bucharest]], submitting a dissertation in front of an examination commission comprising historians and philosophers (Caragiani, Odobescu, Xenopol, alongside [[Aron Densușianu]], [[Constantin Leonardescu]] and [[Petre Râșcanu]]), but totaled a 7 average which only entitled him to a substitute professor's position.&lt;ref&gt;Iova, pp. xxxiv–xxxv. See also Boia (2000), p. 83; Nastasă (2007), pp. 239, 244–245, 430&lt;/ref&gt; The achievement, at age 23, was still remarkable in its context.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), p. 188; Nastasă (2007), pp. 239, 245&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of his lectures came later that year as personal insight on the [[historical method]], ''Despre concepția actuală a istoriei și geneza ei'' ("On the Present-day Concept of History and Its Genesis").&lt;ref name="ivxxxv"&gt;Iova, p. xxxv&lt;/ref&gt; He was again out of the country in 1895, visiting the [[Netherlands]] and, again, Italy, in search of documents, publishing the first section of his extended historical records' collection ''Acte și fragmente cu privire la istoria românilor'' ("Acts and Excerpts Regarding the History of Romanians"), his [[Romanian Atheneum]] conference on Michael the Brave's rivalry with ''[[condottiero]]'' [[Giorgio Basta]], and his debut in [[travel literature]] (''Amintiri din Italia'', "Recollections from Italy").&lt;ref&gt;Iova, p .xxxv. See also Nastasă (2007), p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; The next year came Iorga's official appointment as curator and publisher of the [[Hurmuzachi brothers]] collection of historical documents, the position being granted to him by the [[Romanian Academy]]. The appointment, first proposed to the institution by Xenopol, overlapped with disputes over the Hurmuzachi inheritance, and came only after Iorga's formal pledge that he would renounce all potential [[copyright]]s resulting from his contribution.&lt;ref name="ivxxxv"/&gt; He also published the second part of ''Acte și fragmente'' and the printed rendition of the de Mézières study (''Philippe de Mézières, 1337–1405'').&lt;ref name="ivxxxv"/&gt; Following an October 1895 reexamination, he was granted full professorship with a 9.19 average.&lt;ref name="ivxxxv"/&gt;

1895 was also the year when Iorga began his collaboration with the Iași-based academic and political agitator A. C. Cuza, making his earliest steps in [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] politics, founding with him a group known as the Universal ()and Romanian Antisemitic Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 84; Volovici, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wt618"&gt;[[William Totok]], "Romania (1878–1920)", in [[Richard S. Levy]], ''Antisemitism: a Historical Encyclopedia of Prejudice and Persecution'', Vol. I, [[ABC-CLIO]], Santa Barbara, 2005, p. 618. {{ISBN|1-85109-439-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1897, the year when he was elected a corresponding member of the Academy, Iorga traveled back to Italy and spent time researching more documents in the Austro-Hungarian [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]], at [[Dubrovnik]].&lt;ref name="ivxxxv"/&gt; He also oversaw the publication of the 10th Hurmuzachi volume, grouping diplomatic reports authored by [[Kingdom of Prussia]] diplomats in the two Danubian Principalities (covering the interval between 1703 and 1844).&lt;ref name="ivxxxv"/&gt; After spending most of 1898 on researching various subjects and presenting the results as reports for the Academy, Iorga was in [[Transylvania]], the largely Romanian-inhabited subregion of Austria-Hungary. Concentrating his efforts on the city archives of [[Bistrița]], [[Brașov]] and [[Sibiu]], he made a major breakthrough by establishing that [[Constantin Cantacuzino (stolnic)|''Stolnic'' Cantacuzino]], a 17th-century man of letters and political intriguer, was the real author of an unsigned Wallachian chronicle that had for long been used as a historical source.&lt;ref&gt;Iova, p. xxxvi&lt;/ref&gt; He published several new books in 1899: ''Manuscrise din biblioteci străine'' ("Manuscripts from Foreign Libraries", 2 vols.), ''Documente românești din arhivele Bistriței'' ("Romanian Documents from the Bistrița Archives") and a French-language book on the [[Crusades]], titled ''Notes et extraits pour servir à l'histoire des croisades'' ("Notes and Excerpts Covering the History of the Crusades", 2 vols.).&lt;ref name="ivxxxvi-xxxvii"&gt;Iova, pp. xxxvi–xxxvii&lt;/ref&gt; Xenopol proposed his pupil for a Romanian Academy membership, to replace the suicidal Odobescu, but his proposition could not gather support.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1899, Nicolae Iorga inaugurated his contribution to the Bucharest-based French-language newspaper ''[[L'Indépendance Roumaine]]'', publishing polemical articles on the activity of his various colleagues and, as a consequence, provoking a lengthy scandal. The pieces often targeted senior scholars who, as favorites or activists of the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]], opposed both ''Junimea'' and the Maiorescu-endorsed [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880–1918)|Conservative Party]]: his estranged friends Hasdeu and Tocilescu, as well as [[V. A. Urechia]] and [[Dimitrie Sturdza]].&lt;ref&gt;Iova, pp. xxxvi-–xxxvii; Nastasă (2003), pp. 68, 167, 169–170, 176, 177–178; (2007), pp. 309, 496–502, 508–509, 515–517&lt;/ref&gt; The episode, described by Iorga himself as a stormy but [[Patriotism|patriotic]] debut in public affairs, prompted his adversaries at the Academy to demand the termination of his membership for undignified behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Iova, pp. xxxi, xxxvi&lt;/ref&gt; Tocilescu felt insulted by the allegations, challenged Iorga to a [[duel]], but his friends intervened to mediate.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 309&lt;/ref&gt; Another scientist who encountered Iorga's wrath was [[George Ionescu-Gion]], against whom Iorga enlisted negative arguments that, as he later admitted, were exaggerated.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 508–509&lt;/ref&gt; Among Iorga's main defenders were academics [[Dimitrie Onciul]], [[N. Petrașcu]], and, outside Romania, [[Gustav Weigand]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 515–517&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Opinions sincères'' and Transylvanian echoes===
The young polemicist persevered in supporting this anti-establishment cause, moving on from ''L'Indépendance Roumaine'' to the newly established publication ''România Jună'', interrupting himself for trips to Italy, the Netherlands and [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia-Lodomeria]].&lt;ref name="ivxxxvi-xxxvii"/&gt; In 1900, he collected the scattered polemical articles into the French-language books ''Opinions sincères. La vie intellectuelle des roumains en 1899'' ("Honest Opinions. The Romanians' Intellectual Life in 1899") and ''Opinions pérnicieuses d'un mauvais patriote'' ("The Pernicious Opinions of a Bad Patriot").&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 1010; Iova, p. xxxvii; Nastasă (2003), pp. 68, 167, 169–170, 178; (2007), pp. 169, 464, 496–502, 508–509, 516&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="opapologia"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ovidiu Pecican]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/AVALON.-Apologia-istoriei-recente*articleID_21149-articles_details.html "Avalon. Apologia istoriei recente"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 459, January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; His scholarly activities resulted in a second trip into Transylvania, a second portion of his Bistrița archives collection, the 11th Hurmuzachi volume, and two works on [[Early Modern Romania|early modern Romanian history]]: ''Acte din secolul al XVI-lea relative la Petru Șchiopul'' ("16th Century Acts Relating to Peter the Lame") and ''Scurtă istorie a lui Mihai Viteazul'' ("A Short History of Michael the Brave").&lt;ref name="ivxxxvii"&gt;Iova, p. xxxvii&lt;/ref&gt; His controversial public attitude had nevertheless attracted an official ban on his Academy reports, and also meant that he was ruled out from the national Academy prize (for which distinction he had submitted ''Documente românești din arhivele Bistriței'').&lt;ref name="ivxxxvii"/&gt; The period also witnessed a chill in the Iorga's relationship with Xenopol.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2003), pp. 176–183&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901, shortly after his divorce from Maria, Iorga married Ecaterina (Catinca), the sister of his friend and colleague [[Ioan Bogdan]].&lt;ref&gt;Iova, p. xxxvii; Nastasă (2003), pp. 39, 52, 69–72, 73–74, 118. See also Boia, 2010, p. 188; Butaru, p. 92; Nastasă (2007), pp. 294, 322–323&lt;/ref&gt; Her other brother was cultural historian [[Gheorghe Bogdan-Duică]], whose son, painter [[Catul Bogdan]], Iorga would help achieve recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 114, 150, 294, 379&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after their wedding, the couple were in Venice, where Iorga received Karl Gotthard Lamprecht's offer to write a history of the Romanians to be featured as a section in a collective treatise of world history.&lt;ref&gt;Iova, p. xxxvii. See also Nastasă (2003), pp. 179–180&lt;/ref&gt; Iorga, who had convinced Lamprecht not to assign this task to Xenopol,&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2003), pp. 179–180&lt;/ref&gt; also completed ''Istoria literaturii române în secolul al XVIII-lea'' ("The History of Romanian Literature in the 18th Century"). It was presented to the Academy's consideration, but rejected, prompting the scholar to resign in protest.&lt;ref name="ivxxxvii"/&gt; In order to receive his imprimatur later in the year, Iorga appealed to fellow intellectuals, earning pledges and a sizable grant from the aristocratic [[Callimachi family]].&lt;ref name="ivxxxvii"/&gt;

Before the end of that year, the Iorgas were in the Austro-Hungarian city of [[Budapest]]. While there, the historian set up tight contacts with Romanian intellectuals who originated from Transylvania and who, in the wake of the ''[[Transylvanian Memorandum]]'' affair, supported [[ethnic nationalism]] while objecting to the intermediary [[Cisleithania]]n ([[Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen|Hungarian Crown]]) rule and the threat of [[Magyarization]].&lt;ref name="ivxxxvii"/&gt; Interested in recovering the Romanian contributions to [[History of Transylvania|Transylvanian history]], in particular Michael the Brave's precursory role in Romanian unionism, Iorga spent his time reviewing, copying and translating [[Hungarian language|Hungarian-language]] historical texts with much assistance from his wife.&lt;ref name="ivxxxvii"/&gt; During the 300th commemoration of Prince Michael's death, which ethnic Romanian students transformed into a rally against Austro-Hungarian educational restrictions, Iorga addressed the crowds and was openly greeted by the protest's leaders, poet [[Octavian Goga]] and Orthodox priest [[Ioan Lupaș]].&lt;ref name="ivxxxvii"/&gt; In 1902, he published new tracts on Transylvanian or Wallachian topics: ''Legăturile Principatelor române cu Ardealul'' ("The Romanian Principalities' Links with Transylvania"), ''Sate și preoți din Ardeal'' ("Priests and Villages of Transylvania"), ''Despre Cantacuzini'' ("On the [[Cantacuzino family|Cantacuzinos]]"), ''Istoriile domnilor Țării Românești'' ("The Histories of Wallachian Princes").&lt;ref name="ivxxxviii"&gt;Iova, p. xxxviii&lt;/ref&gt;

Iorga was by then making known his newly found interest in [[cultural nationalism]] and national [[didacticism]], as expressed by him in an [[open letter]] to Goga's Budapest-based ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name="ivxxxviii"/&gt; After further interventions from Goga and linguist [[Sextil Pușcariu]], ''Luceafărul'' became Iorga's main mouthpiece outside Romania.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 514–515&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to Bucharest in 1903, Iorga followed Lamprecht's suggestion and focused on writing his first overview of Romanian national history, known in Romanian as ''Istoria românilor'' ("The History of the Romanians").&lt;ref name="ivxxxviii"/&gt; He was also involved in a new project of researching the content of archives throughout Moldavia and Wallachia,&lt;ref name="ivxxxviii"/&gt; and, having reassessed the nationalist politics of ''Junimist'' poet [[Mihai Eminescu]], helped collect and publish a companion to Eminescu's work.&lt;ref&gt;Both, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Sămănătorul'' and 1906 riot===
[[File:Samanatorul - Prima pagina - 13 martie 1905.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''[[Sămănătorul]]'', March 1905. The table of contents credits Iorga as an editorialist and political columnist]]

Also in 1903, Nicolae Iorga became one of the managers of ''[[Sămănătorul]]'' review. The moment brought Iorga's emancipation from Maiorescu's influence, his break with mainstream ''Junimism'', and his affiliation to the traditionalist, [[Ethnic nationalism|ethno-nationalist]] and [[Neo-romanticism|neoromantic]] current encouraged by the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 407, 508, 601–602; Livezeanu, p. 116-117; Ornea (1998), pp. 131, 136; Nastasă (2007), pp. 179–180; Veiga, pp. 164–167&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Sămănătorist'' school was by then also grouping other former or active ''Junimists'', and Maiorescu's progressive withdrawal from literary life also created a bridge with ''Convorbiri Literare'': its new editor, [[Simion Mehedinți]], was himself a theorist of traditionalism.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1998), p. 73, 75–79, 131, 136, 376. See also Călinescu, p. 643&lt;/ref&gt; A circle of ''Junimists'' more sympathetic to Maiorescu's version of conservatism reacted against this realignment by founding its own venue, ''[[Convorbiri Critice]]'', edited by [[Mihail Dragomirescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 643–644; Ornea (1998), pp. 73, 78–79, 88, 91–104, 134–139&lt;/ref&gt;

In tandem with his full return to cultural and political journalism, which included prolonged debates with both the "old" historians and the ''Junimists'',&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2003), pp. 170, 181–183&lt;/ref&gt; Iorga was still active at the forefront of historical research. In 1904, he published the [[historical geography]] work ''Drumuri și orașe din România'' ("Roads and Towns of Romania") and, upon the special request of National Liberal Education Minister [[Spiru Haret]], a work dedicated to the celebrated Moldavian Prince [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great]], published upon the 400th anniversary of the monarch's death as ''Istoria lui Ștefan cel Mare'' ("The History of Stephen the Great").&lt;ref&gt;Iova, pp. xxxviii–xxxix&lt;/ref&gt; Iorga later confessed that the book was an integral part of his and Haret's didacticist agenda, supposed to be "spread to the very bottom of the country in thousands of copies".&lt;ref name="ivxxxix"&gt;Iova, p. xxxix&lt;/ref&gt; During those months, Iorga also helped discover novelist [[Mihail Sadoveanu]], who was for a while the leading figure of ''Sămănătorist'' literature.&lt;ref name="iscenten"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ion Simuț]], [http://www.romlit.ro/centenarul_debutului_sadovenian "Centenarul debutului sadovenian"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313200957/http://romlit.ro/centenarul_debutului_sadovenian |date=2016-03-13 }}, in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 41/2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, the year when historian [[Onisifor Ghibu]] became his close friend and disciple,&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 272–273&lt;/ref&gt; he followed up with over 23 individual titles, among them the two German-language volumes of ''Geschichte des Rümanischen Volkes im Rahmen seiner Staatsbildungen'' ("A History of the Romanian People within the Context of Its National Formation"), ''Istoria românilor în chipuri și icoane'' ("The History of the Romanians in Faces and Icons"), ''Sate și mănăstiri din România'' ("Villages and Monasteries of Romania") and the essay ''Gânduri și sfaturi ale unui om ca oricare altul'' ("Thoughts and Advices from a Man Just like Any Other").&lt;ref name="ivxxxix"/&gt; He also paid a visits to the Romanians of [[Bukovina]] region, in Austrian territory, as well as to those of Bessarabia, who were subjects of the [[Russian Empire]], and wrote about their cultural struggles in his 1905 accounts ''Neamul romănesc&lt;!-- sic --&gt; în Bucovina'' ("The Romanian People of Bukovina"), ''Neamul romănesc în Basarabia'' ("...of Bessarabia").&lt;ref name="omintelect"&gt;{{ro icon}} Ovidiu Morar, [http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/articol.php?cod=7466 "Intelectualii români și 'chestia evreiască' "] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924123630/http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/articol.php?cod=7466 |date=2015-09-24 }}, in ''[[Contemporanul]]'', Nr. 6/2005 (republished by [http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/ ''România Culturală'']  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902021335/http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/ |date=2011-09-02 }})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ispitor"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ion Simuț]], [http://www.romlit.ro/pitorescul_prozei_de_cltorie "Pitorescul prozei de călătorie"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 27/2006&lt;/ref&gt; These referred to [[Tsarist autocracy]] as a source of "darkness and slavery", whereas the more liberal regime of Bukovina offered its subjects "golden chains".&lt;ref name="ispitor"/&gt;

Although from the same cultural family as ''Sămănătorul'', the Poporanist theorist [[Constantin Stere]] was dismissed by Iorga's articles, despite Sadoveanu's attempts to settle the matter.&lt;ref name="ihstere1"/&gt;

A peak in Nicolae Iorga's own nationalist campaigning occurred that year: profiting from a wave of [[Francophobia]] among young urbanites, Iorga [[boycott]]ed the [[National Theatre Bucharest|National Theater]], punishing its staff for staging a play entirely in French, and disturbing public order.&lt;ref name="cpfsigu1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boia (2000), pp. 92–93, 247; (2010), p. 353; Nastasă (2007), pp. 95, 428, 479; Stanomir, ''Spiritul'', pp. 114–118; Veiga, p. 165, 180&lt;/ref&gt; According to one of Iorga's young disciples, the future journalist [[Pamfil Șeicaru]], the mood was such that Iorga could have led a successful ''[[coup d'état]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Veiga, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; These events had several political consequences. The ''[[Siguranța Statului]]'' intelligence agency soon opened a file on the historian, informing [[Prime Minister of Romania|Romanian Premier]] Sturdza about nationalist agitation.&lt;ref name="cpfsigu1"/&gt; The perception that Iorga was a [[Xenophobia|xenophobe]] also drew condemnation from more moderate traditionalist circles, in particular the ''[[Viața Literară]]'' weekly. Its panelists, [[Ilarie Chendi]] and young [[Eugen Lovinescu]], ridiculed Iorga's claim of superiority; Chendi in particular criticized the rejection of writers based on their ethnic origin and not their ultimate merit (while alleging, to Iorga's annoyance, that Iorga himself was a Greek).&lt;ref name="dhscrisori"/&gt;

Iorga eventually parted with ''Sămănătorul'' in late 1906, moving on to set up his own tribune, ''[[Neamul Românesc]]''. The schism was allegedly a direct result of his conflicts with other literary venues,&lt;ref name="ivxxxix"/&gt; and inaugurated a brief collaboration between Iorga and ''[[Făt Frumos (magazine)|Făt Frumos]]'' journalist [[Emil Gârleanu]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 634&lt;/ref&gt; The newer magazine, illustrated with idealized portraits of the Romanian peasant,&lt;ref&gt;Oldson, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; was widely popular with Romania's rural [[intelligentsia]] (among which it was freely distributed), promoting antisemitic theories and raising opprobrium from the authorities and the urban-oriented press.&lt;ref name="omintelect"/&gt;

Also in 1906, Iorga traveled into the [[Ottoman Empire]], visiting [[Istanbul]], and published another set of volumes—''Contribuții la istoria literară'' ("Contributions to Literary History"), ''Neamul românesc în Ardeal și Țara Ungurească'' ("The Romanian Nation in Transylvania and the Hungarian Land"), ''Negoțul și meșteșugurile în trecutul românesc'' ("Trade and Crafts of the Romanian Past") etc.&lt;ref name="ivxxxix"/&gt; In 1907, he began issuing a second periodical, the cultural magazine ''[[Floarea Darurilor]]'',&lt;ref name="ivxxxix"/&gt; and published with [[Editura Minerva]] an early installment of his companion to Romanian literature (second volume 1908, third volume 1909).&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 977; Iova, pp. xxxix–xl&lt;/ref&gt; His published scientific contributions for that year include, among others, an English-language study on the [[Byzantine Empire]].&lt;ref name="ivxxxix"/&gt; At home, he and pupil [[Vasile Pârvan]] were involved in a conflict with fellow historian [[Orest Tafrali]], officially over archeological theory, but also because of a regional conflict in academia: Bucharest and Transylvania against Tafrali's Iași.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 306–308, 517–521&lt;/ref&gt;

A seminal moment in Iorga's political career took place during the [[1907 Romanian Peasants' Revolt]], erupting under a Conservative cabinet and repressed with much violence by a National Liberal one. The bloody outcome prompted the historian to author and make public a piece of social critique, the ''Neamul Românesc'' pamphlet ''Dumnezeu să-i ierte'' ("God Forgive Them").&lt;ref name="ivxxxix"/&gt; The text, together with his program of agrarian conferences and his subscription lists for the benefit of victims' relatives again made him an adversary of the National Liberals, who referred to Iorga as an instigator.&lt;ref name="ivxxxix"/&gt; The historian did however struck a chord with Stere, who had been made prefect of [[Iași County]], and who, going against his party's wishes, inaugurated an informal collaboration between Iorga and the Poporanists.&lt;ref name="ihstere1"/&gt; The political class as a whole was particularly apprehensive of Iorga's contacts with the [[Cultural League for the Unity of All Romanians]] and their common [[Irredentism|irredentist]] agenda, which risked undermining relations with the Austrians over Transylvania and Bukovina.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Cătălin Petruț Fudulu, [http://www.zf.ro/ziarul-de-duminica/dosare-declasificate-nicolae-iorga-sub-lupa-sigurantei-ii-4904721/ "Dosare declasificate.

Iorga and his new family had relocated several times, renting a home in Bucharest's [[Gara de Nord]] (Buzești) quarter.&lt;ref name="apbucurestii"/&gt; After renewed but failed attempts to become an Iași University professor,&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 338–339, 492&lt;/ref&gt; he decided, in 1908, to set his base away from the urban centers, at a villa in [[Vălenii de Munte]] town (nestled in the remote hilly area of [[Prahova County]]). Although branded an agitator by Sturdza, he received support in this venture from Education Minister Haret.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Cătălin Petruț Fudulu, [http://www.zf.ro/ziarul-de-duminica/dosare-declasificate-nicolae-iorga-sub-lupa-sigurantei-iii-4948034/ "Dosare declasificate.

See also Setton, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; and an anthology on Romanian [[Romanticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 996&lt;/ref&gt; He followed up in 1909 with a volume of parliamentary speeches, ''În era reformelor'' ("In the Age of Reforms"), a book on the [[United Principalities|1859 Moldo–Wallachian Union]] (''Unirea principatelor'', "The Principalities' Union"),&lt;ref name="ivxl"&gt;Iova, p. xl&lt;/ref&gt; and a critical edition of poems by Eminescu.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. II, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; Visiting Iași for the Union Jubilee, Iorga issued a public and emotional apology to Xenopol for having criticized him in the previous decade.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2003), p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;

===1909 setbacks and PND creation===
At that stage in his life, Iorga became an honorary member of the [[Romanian Writers' Society]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 526&lt;/ref&gt; He had militated for its creation in both ''Sămănătorul'' and ''Neamul Românesc'', but also wrote against its system of fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Cassian Maria Spiridon]], [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/TATAapr8.html "Secolul breslei scriitoricești"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719230125/http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/TATAapr8.html |date=2011-07-19 }}, in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Once liberated from government restriction in 1909, his Vălenii school grew into a hub of student activity, self-financed through the sale of postcards.&lt;ref name="cpfsigu4"&gt;{{ro icon}} Cătălin Petruț Fudulu, [http://www.zf.ro/ziarul-de-duminica/dosare-declasificate-nicolae-iorga-sub-lupa-sigurantei-iv-expulzat-din-reichstad-4972506/ "Dosare declasificate. Nicolae Iorga sub lupa Siguranței (IV)"], in ''[[Ziarul Financiar]]'', October 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Its success caused alarm in Austria-Hungary: ''[[Budapesti Hírlap]]'' newspaper described Iorga's school as an instrument for radicalizing Romanian Transylvanians.&lt;ref name="cpfsigu4"/&gt; Iorga also alienated the main Romanian organizations in Transylvania: the [[Romanian National Party]] (PNR) dreaded his proposal to boycott the [[Diet of Hungary]], particularly since PNR leaders were contemplating a loyalist [[United States of Greater Austria|"Greater Austria" devolution project]].&lt;ref&gt;H. Seton-Watson &amp; C. Seton-Watson, pp. 51–52&lt;/ref&gt;

The consequences hit Iorga in May 1909, when he was stopped from visiting Bukovina, officially branded a ''[[persona non grata]]'', and expelled from Austrian soil (in June, it was made illegal for Bukovinan schoolteachers to attend Iorga's lectures).&lt;ref name="cpfsigu4"/&gt; A month later, Iorga greeted in Bucharest the English scholar [[Robert William Seton-Watson|R.W.

In 1910, the year when he toured the [[Romanian Old Kingdom|Old Kingdom]]'s conference circuit, Nicolae Iorga again rallied with Cuza to establish the explicitly antisemitic [[Democratic Nationalist Party (Romania)|Democratic Nationalist Party]].

See also Butaru, pp. 95–97; Crampton, p. 109; Oldson, pp. 133–135&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1910, Iorga published some thirty new works, covering [[gender history]] (''Viața femeilor în trecutul românesc'', "The Early Life of Romanian Women"), [[Military history of Romania|Romanian military history]] (''Istoria armatei românești'', "The History of the Romanian Military") and Stephen the Great's Orthodox profile (''Ștefan cel Mare și mănăstirea Neamțului'', "Stephen the Great and [[Neamț Monastery]]").&lt;ref name="ivxl"/&gt; His academic activity also resulted in a lengthy conflict with art historian [[Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș]], his godfather and former friend, sparked when Iorga, defending his own academic postings, objected to making Art History a separate subject at University.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 36–38, 321–323. See also Nastasă (2003), pp. 39, 71&lt;/ref&gt;

Reinstated into the Academy and made a full member, he gave his May 1911 reception speech with a [[philosophy of history]] subject (''Două concepții istorice'', "Two Historical Outlooks") and was introduced on the occasion by Xenopol.&lt;ref name="ivxl-xli"&gt;Iova, pp. xl–xli&lt;/ref&gt; In August of that year, he was again in Transylvania, at [[Blaj]], where he paid homage to the Romanian-run [[Asociația Transilvană pentru Literatura Română și Cultura Poporului Român|ASTRA Cultural Society]].&lt;ref name="ivxli"&gt;Iova, p. xli&lt;/ref&gt; He made his first contribution to [[Theatre of Romania|Romanian drama]] with the play centered on, and named after, Michael the Brave (''Mihai Viteazul''), one of around twenty new titles for that year—alongside his collected [[aphorism]]s (''Cugetări'', "Musings") and a memoir of his life in culture (''Oameni cari au fost'', "People Who Are Gone").&lt;ref&gt;Iova, p. xli. See also Vianu, Vol. III, pp. 53–61&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912, he published, among other works, ''Trei drame'' ("Three Dramatic Plays"), grouping ''Mihai Viteazul'', ''Învierea lui Ștefan cel Mare'' ("Stephen the Great's Resurrection") and ''Un domn pribeag'' ("An Outcast Prince").&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 1010; Iova, p. xli&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Iorga produced the first of several studies dealing with [[Balkans|Balkan]] [[geopolitics]] in the charged context leading up to the [[Balkan Wars]] (''România, vecinii săi și chestia Orientală'', "Romania, Her Neighbors and the [[Eastern Question]]").&lt;ref name="ivxli"/&gt; He also made a noted contribution to [[ethnography]], with ''Portul popular românesc'' ("[[Romanian dress|Romanian Folk Dress]]").&lt;ref name="ivxli"/&gt;&lt;ref name="goarta860"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Gheorghe Oprescu]], [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/transilvania/1920/BCUCLUJ_FP_279996_1920_051_011.pdf "Arta țărănească la Români"], in ''Transilvania'', Nr. 11/1920, p. 860 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iorga and the Balkan crisis===

In 1913, Iorga was in [[London]] for an International Congress of History, presenting a proposal for a new approach to [[medievalism]] and a paper discussing the sociocultural effects of the [[fall of Constantinople]] on Moldavia and Wallachia.&lt;ref name="ivxli"/&gt; He was later in the [[Kingdom of Serbia]], invited by the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts|Belgrade Academy]] and presenting dissertations on [[Romania–Serbia relations]] and the [[Decline of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman decline]].&lt;ref name="ivxli"/&gt; Iorga was even called under arms in the [[Second Balkan War]], during which Romania fought alongside Serbia and against the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]].&lt;ref name="apbucurestii"/&gt;&lt;ref name="prstoicad"&gt;Paul Rezeanu, "Stoica D. – pictorul istoriei românilor", in ''[[Magazin Istoric]]'', December 2009, pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent taking of [[Southern Dobruja]], supported by Maiorescu and the Conservatives, was seen by Iorga as callous and [[Imperialism|imperialistic]].&lt;ref name="zomemor"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Z. Ornea]], [http://www.romlit.ro/din_memorialistica_lui_n._iorga "Din memorialistica lui N. Iorga"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 23/1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Iorga's interest in the Balkan crisis was illustrated by two of the forty books he put out that year: ''Istoria statelor balcanice'' ("The History of Balkan States") and ''Notele unui istoric cu privire la evenimentele din Balcani'' ("A Historian's Notes on the Balkan Events").&lt;ref name="ivxli"/&gt; Noted among the others is the study focusing on the early 18th century reign of Wallachian Prince [[Constantin Brâncoveanu]] (''Viața și domnia lui Constantin vodă Brâncoveanu'', "The Life and Rule of Prince Constantin Brâncoveanu").&lt;ref name="ivxli"/&gt; That same year, Iorga issued the first series of his ''[[Drum Drept]]'' monthly, later merged with the ''Sămănătorist'' magazine ''[[Ramuri]]''.&lt;ref name="ivxli"/&gt; Iorga managed to publish roughly as many new titles in 1914, the year when he received a Romanian ''Bene Merenti'' distinction,&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 133–134&lt;/ref&gt; and inaugurated the international [[Institute of South-East European Studies]] or ISSEE (founded through his efforts), with a lecture on [[History of Albania|Albanian history]].&lt;ref&gt;Iova, p. xli. See also Guida, p. 238; Nastasă (2007), pp. 49, 50; Olaru &amp; Herbstritt, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

Again invited to Italy, he spoke at the ''[[Ateneo Veneto]]'' on the relations between the [[Republic of Venice]] and the Balkans,&lt;ref name="ivxli"/&gt; and again about ''[[Settecento]]'' culture.&lt;ref name="sbegoldoni"&gt;{{ro icon}} Smaranda Bratu-Elian, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Goldoni-si-noi*articleID_18668-articles_details.html "Goldoni și noi"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 397, November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; His attention was focused on the [[Albanians]] and [[Arbëreshë people|Arbëreshë]]—Iorga soon discovered the oldest record of [[Albanian language|written Albanian]], the 1462 ''[[Formula e pagëzimit]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin E.

===Ententist profile===
Nicolae Iorga's involvement in political disputes and the cause of Romanian irredentism became a leading characteristic of his biography during [[World War I]]. In 1915, while Romania was still keeping neutral, he sided with the dominant nationalist, [[Francophile]] and pro-[[Allies of World War I|Entente]] camp, urging for Romania to wage war on the [[Central Powers]] as a means of obtaining Transylvania, Bukovina and other regions held by Austria-Hungary; to this goal, he became an active member of the [[Cultural League for the Unity of All Romanians]], and personally organized the large pro-Entente rallies in Bucharest.&lt;ref name="ivxlii"&gt;Iova, p. xlii&lt;/ref&gt; A prudent anti-Austrian, Iorga adopted the [[interventionism (politics)|interventionist]] agenda with noted delay. His hesitation was ridiculed by  hawkish [[Eugen Lovinescu]] as pro-Transylvanian but [[anti-war]],&lt;ref&gt;Boia (2010), pp. 106–107, 112–113&lt;/ref&gt; costing Iorga his office in the Cultural League.&lt;ref name="zomemor"/&gt; The historian later confessed that, like Premier [[Ion I. C. Brătianu]] and the National Liberal cabinet, he had been waiting for a better moment to strike.&lt;ref name="zomemor"/&gt; In the end, his "Ententist" efforts were closely supported by public figures such as [[Alexandru I. Lapedatu]] and [[Ion Petrovici]], as well as by [[Take Ionescu]]'s National Action advocacy group.&lt;ref&gt;Boia (2010), pp. 76, 115–116, 122, 276&lt;/ref&gt; Iorga was also introduced to the private circle of Romania's young [[King of Romania|King]], [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand I]],&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 88–89&lt;/ref&gt; whom he found well-intentioned but weak-willed.&lt;ref name="zomemor"/&gt; Iorga is sometimes credited as a tutor to [[Carol II of Romania|Crown Prince Carol]] (future King Carol II),&lt;ref name="agrevenind4"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Alexandru George]], [http://www.revistaluceafarul.ro/index.html?id=1486&amp;editie=69 "Revenind la discuții (4)"], in ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]'', Nr. 31/2009&lt;/ref&gt; who reportedly attended the Vălenii school.&lt;ref&gt;Butaru, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

In his October 1915 polemic with [[Vasile Sion]], a [[Germanophile]] physician, Iorga at once justified suspicion of the [[Germans of Romania|German Romanians]] and praised those Romanians who were deserting the [[Austro-Hungarian Army|Austrian Army]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia (2010), pp. 304–305&lt;/ref&gt; The Ententists' focus on Transylvania pitted them against the Poporanists, who deplored the Romanians of Bessarabia. That region, the Poporanist lobby argued, was being actively oppressed by the [[Russian Empire]] with the acquiescence of other Entente powers. Poporanist theorist [[Garabet Ibrăileanu]], editor of ''[[Viața Românească]]'' review, later accused Iorga of not ever speaking in support of the Bessarabians.&lt;ref&gt;Boia (2010), pp. 239, 325&lt;/ref&gt;

Political themes were again reflected in Nicolae Iorga's 1915 report to the Academy (''Dreptul la viață al statelor mici'', "The Small States' Right to Exist") and in various of the 37 books he published that year: ''Istoria românilor din Ardeal și Ungaria'' ("The History of the Romanians in Transylvania and Hungary"), ''Politica austriacă față de Serbia'' ("The Austrian Policy on Serbia") etc.&lt;ref name="ivxlii"/&gt; Also in 1915, Iorga completed his [[economic history]] treatise, ''Istoria comerțului la români'' ("The History of Commerce among the Romanians"), as well as a volume on literary history and [[Romanian philosophy]], ''Faze sufletești și cărți reprezentative la români'' ("Spiritual Phases and Relevant Books of the Romanians").&lt;ref name="ivxlii"/&gt; Before spring 1916, he was commuting between Bucharest and Iași, substituting the ailing Xenopol at Iași University.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2003), pp. 183–184; (2007), pp. 376, 492&lt;/ref&gt; He also gave a final touch to the collection ''Studii și documente'' ("Studies and Documents"), comprising his commentary on 30,000 individual documents and spread over 31 tomes.&lt;ref name="ivxlii"/&gt;

===Iași refuge===
[[File:Nicolae Iorga - Histoire des Relations Russo-Roumaines - Prima pagina.png|thumb|Iorga's essay on [[Romania–Russia relations]], published in Iași, 1917]]

In late summer 1916, as Brătianu's government sealed an [[Treaty of Bucharest (1916)|alliance with the Entente]], Iorga expressed his joy in a piece named ''Ceasul'' ("The Hour"): "the hour we have been expecting for over two centuries, for which we have been living our entire national life, for which we have been working and writing, fighting and thinking, has at long last arrived."&lt;ref name="ivxlii"/&gt; Nevertheless, the [[Romania during World War I|Romanian campaign]] ended in massive defeat, forcing the [[Romanian Army]] and the entire administration to evacuate the southern areas, Bucharest included, in front of a German-led occupation. Iorga's home in Vălenii de Munte was among the property items left behind and seized by the occupiers, and, according to Iorga's own claim, was vandalized by the ''[[German Army (German Empire)|Deutsches Heer]]''.&lt;ref name="ivxliv"&gt;Iova, p. xliv&lt;/ref&gt;

Still a member of Parliament, Iorga joined the authorities in the provisional capital of Iași, but opposed the plans of relocating government out of besieged Moldavia and into the [[Russian Provisional Government|Russian Republic]]. The argument was made in one of his parliamentary speeches, printed as a pamphlet and circulated among the military: "May the dogs of this world feast on us sooner than to find our happiness, tranquility and prosperity granted by the hostile foreigner."&lt;ref&gt;Iova, p. xlii. See also Boia (2010), p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; He did however allow some of his notebooks to be stored in [[Moscow]], along with the [[Romanian Treasure]],&lt;ref name="gifcoresp2"&gt;{{ro icon}} Gheorghe I. Florescu, [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/FLORESCUiun3.html "Corespondența personală a lui N.

Iorga, who reissued ''Neamul Românesc'' in Iași, resumed his activity at Iași University and began working on the war propaganda daily ''România'',&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. III, pp. 92–93&lt;/ref&gt; while contributing to R.W. Seton-Watson's international sheet ''The New Europe''.&lt;ref&gt;H. Seton-Watson &amp; C. Seton-Watson, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; His contribution for that year included a number of brochures dedicated to maintaining morale among soldiers and civilians: ''Războiul actual și urmările lui în viața morală a omenirii'' ("The Current War and Its Effects on the Moral Life of Mankind"), ''Rolul inițiativei private în viața publică'' ("The Role of Private Initiative in Public Life"), ''Sfaturi și învățături pentru ostașii României'' ("Advices and Teachings for Romania's Soldiers") etc.&lt;ref name="ivxlii"/&gt; He also translated from English and printed ''My Country'', a patriotic essay by Ferdinand's wife [[Marie of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name="rcinvest"&gt;{{fr icon}} Romanița Constantinescu, [http://www.phantasma.ro/caiete/caiete/caiete18/06.html "Investissements imaginaires roumains en Quadrilatère: La ville de Balchik"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727134547/http://www.phantasma.ro/caiete/caiete/caiete18/06.html |date=2011-07-27 }}, in ''[http://phantasma.ro/caiete.html Caietele Echinox] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625073339/http://phantasma.ro/caiete.html |date=2008-06-25 }}'', Vol. 18, [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://phantasma.ro/ Center for Imagination Studies] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429090728/http://www.phantasma.ro/ |date=2009-04-29 }}, Cluj-Napoca, 2010, pp. 68–82. {{oclc|166882762}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The heightened sense of crisis prompted Iorga to issue appeals against [[defeatism]] and reissue ''Neamul Românesc'' from Iași, explaining: "I realized at once what moral use could come out of this for the thousands of discouraged and disillusioned people and against the traitors who were creeping up all over the place."&lt;ref name="ivxliii"&gt;Iova, p. xliii&lt;/ref&gt; The goal was again reflected in his complementary lectures (where he discussed the "national principle") and a new set of works; these featured musings on the Allied commitment (''Relations des Roumains avec les Alliès'', "The Romanians' Relations with the Allies"; ''Histoire des relations entre la France et les roumains'', "The History of Relations between France and the Romanians"), the national character (''Sufletul românesc'', "The Romanian Soul") or columns against the loss of morale (''Armistițiul'', "The Armistice").&lt;ref name="ivxliii"/&gt; His ideal of moral regeneration through the war effort came with an endorsement of [[Land reform in Romania|land reform projects]]. Brătianu did not object to the idea, being however concerned that landowners would rebel. Iorga purportedly gave him a sarcastic reply: "just like you've been shooting the peasants to benefit the landowners, you'll then be shooting the landowners to benefit the peasants."&lt;ref&gt;Iova, pp. xliii–xliv&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1918, Romania yielded to German demands and negotiated the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|Bucharest Treaty]], an effective armistice. The conditions were judged humiliating by Iorga ("Our ancestors would have preferred death");&lt;ref name="ivxliv"/&gt; he refused to regain his University of Bucharest chair.&lt;ref&gt;Boia (2010), p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; The German authorities in Bucharest reacted by [[blacklist]]ing the historian.&lt;ref name="ivxliv"/&gt;

===Greater Romania's creation===
Iorga only returned to Bucharest as Romania resumed its contacts with the Allies and the ''Deutsches Heer'' left the country. The political uncertainty ended by late autumn, when the Allied victory on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] sealed Germany's defeat. Celebrating the [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|Compiègne Armistice]], Iorga wrote: "There can be no greater day for the entire world".&lt;ref name="ivxliv"/&gt; Iorga however found that Bucharest had become "a filthy hell under lead skies."&lt;ref name="apbucurestii"/&gt; His celebrated return also included the premiere of ''Învierea lui Ștefan cel Mare'' at the [[National Theatre Bucharest|National Theater]], which continued to host productions of his dramatic texts on a regular basis, until ca. 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 1010. See also Ciprian, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;

He was reelected to the lower chamber in the [[Romanian general election, 1918|June 1918 election]], becoming President of the body and, due to the rapid political developments, the first person to hold this office in the history of [[Greater Romania]].&lt;ref name="ivxliv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gifcoresp1"&gt;{{ro icon}} Gheorghe I.

Florescu, [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/FLORESCUnov8.html "Regina Maria și Conferința de pace din 1919" (III)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317061953/http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/FLORESCUnov8.html |date=2012-03-17 }}, in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the creation of Greater Romania, Iorga was focusing his public activity on exposing [[Collaborationism|collaborators]] of the wartime occupiers. The subject was central to a 1919 speech he held in front of the Academy, where he obtained the public condemnation of actively Germanophile academicians, having earlier [[veto]]ed the membership of Poporanist [[Constantin Stere]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia (2010), pp. 111, 346–347. See also Iova, p. xliv&lt;/ref&gt; He failed at enlisting support for the purge of Germanophile professors from University, but the attempt rekindled the feud between him and [[Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș]], who had served in the German-appointed administration.&lt;ref&gt;Boia (2010), pp. 111, 353–354, 356&lt;/ref&gt; The two scholars later took their battle to court&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Dumitru Hîncu, [http://www.romlit.ro/al._tzigara-samurca_-_din_amintirile_primului_vorbitor_la_radio_romnesc "Al.

Following [[Romanian general election, 1919|November 1919 elections]], Iorga became a member of the [[Senate of Romania|Senate]], representing the Democratic Nationalists. Although he resented the [[universal male suffrage]] and viewed the adoption of electoral symbols as promoting political illiteracy, his PND came to use a logo representing two hands grasping (later replaced with a black-flag-and-sickle).&lt;ref&gt;Radu, pp. 580, 585&lt;/ref&gt; The elections seemed to do away with the old political system: Iorga's party was third, trailing behind two newcomers, the Transylvanian PNR and the Poporanist [[Peasants' Party (Romania)|Peasants' Party]] (PȚ), with whom it formed a parliamentary bloc supporting an [[Alexandru Vaida-Voevod]] cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;Veiga, pp. 35–36, 130&lt;/ref&gt; This union of former rivals also showed Iorga's growing suspicion of Brătianu, whom he feared intended to absorb the PND into the National Liberal Party, and accused of creating a [[political machine]].&lt;ref name="zomemor"/&gt; He and his disciples were circulating the term ''politicianism'' ("politicking"), expressing their disappointment for the new political context.&lt;ref name="zomemor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gifcoresp2"/&gt;

Also in 1919, Iorga was elected chairman of the Cultural League, where he gave a speech on "the Romanians' rights to their national territory", was appointed head of the Historical Monuments' Commission, and met the French academic mission to Romania ([[Henri Mathias Berthelot]], [[Charles Diehl]], [[Emmanuel de Martonne]] and [[Raymond Poincaré]], whom he greeted with a speech about the Romanians and the [[Italic peoples|Romance peoples]]).&lt;ref&gt;Iova, pp. xliv–xlv&lt;/ref&gt; Together with French war hero Septime Gorceix, he also compiled ''Anthologie de la littérature roumaine'' ("An Anthology of Romanian Literature").&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Mircea Iorgulescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/acum_85_de_ani_-_antologie_de_literatur_romn_n_frana "Acum 85 de ani - Antologie de literatură română în Franța"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 51–52/2005&lt;/ref&gt; That year, the French state granted Iorga its [[Legion of Honor]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 276&lt;/ref&gt;

See also Tanașoca, pp. 99–100, 163&lt;/ref&gt; Iorga was awarded the title of doctor ''[[honoris causa]]'' by the [[University of Strasbourg]],&lt;ref name="ivxlv"&gt;Iova, p. xlv&lt;/ref&gt; while his lectures on Albania, collected by poet [[Lasgush Poradeci]], became ''Brève histoire de l'Albanie'' ("Concise History of Albania").&lt;ref name="kkzodie"/&gt; In Bucharest, Iorga received as a gift from his admirers a new Bucharest home on Bonaparte Highway (Iancu de Hunedoara Boulevard).&lt;ref name="apbucurestii"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ivxlv"/&gt;

===Early 1920s politics===
Iorga's parliamentary bloc crumbled in late March 1920, when Ferdinand dissolved Parliament.&lt;ref name="gifcoresp3"&gt;{{ro icon}} Gheorghe I. Florescu, [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/FLORESCUiul4.html "Corespondența personală a lui N.

The latter had since been forgiven for his wartime stance, decorated for negotiating the [[Union of Bessarabia with Romania|Bessarabian union]], and elected on PȚ lists in [[Soroca County (Romania)|Soroca County]].&lt;ref name="ihstere2"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ion Hadârcă]], [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/HADIRCAiul6.html "Constantin Stere și Nicolae Iorga: antinomiile idealului convergent (II)"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317062009/http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/HADIRCAiul6.html |date=2012-03-17 }}, in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Iorga's speech, "Stere's Betrayal", turned attention back to Stere's Germanophilia (with quotes that were supposedly taken out of context) and demanded his invalidation—the subsequent debate was tense and emotional, but a new vote in Chamber confirmed Stere as Soroca deputy.&lt;ref name="ihstere2"/&gt;

The overall election victory belonged to the radical, eclectic and anti-PNR [[People's Party (interwar Romania)|People's Party]], led by war hero [[Alexandru Averescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Veiga, pp. 45–47&lt;/ref&gt; Iorga, whose PND had formed the Federation of National Democracy with the PȚ and other parties,&lt;ref name="gifcoresp3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gifaverescu"&gt;{{ro icon}} Gheorghe I.

According to Crampton (p. 109), the two parties still shared views on antisemitism, even though the PND was officially "dedicated to recompensating those who had suffered during the war".&lt;/ref&gt; Iorga's suggestions that new arrivals from Transylvania and Bessarabia were becoming a clique also resulted in collisions with former friend [[Octavian Goga]], who had joined up with Averescu's party.&lt;ref name="ihstere2"/&gt;

His publishing activity continued at a steady pace during that year, when he first presided over the Romanian School of [[Fontenay-aux-Roses]];&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 120, 195–196&lt;/ref&gt; he issued the two volumes of ''Histoire des roumains et de leur civilisation'' ("The History of the Romanians and Their Civilization") and the three tomes of ''Istoria românilor prin călătorii'' ("The History of the Romanians in Travels"), alongside ''Ideea Daciei românești'' ("The Idea of a Romanian [[Dacia]]"), ''Istoria Evului Mediu'' ("The History of the Middle Ages") and some other scholarly works.&lt;ref name="ivxlv"/&gt; His biographical studies were mainly focused on his nationalist predecessor [[Mihail Kogălniceanu]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 988. See also Vianu, Vol. II, p. 274&lt;/ref&gt; Iorga also resumed his writing for the stage, with two new drama plays: one centered on the Moldavian ruler [[Constantin Cantemir]] (''Cantemir bătrânul'', "Cantemir the Elder"), the other dedicated to, and named after, Brâncoveanu.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 1010; Iova, p. xlv-xlvi&lt;/ref&gt; Centering his activity as a public speaker in Transylvanian cities, Iorga was also involved in projects to organize folk theaters throughout the country, through which he intended to spread a unified cultural message.&lt;ref name="ivxlvi"&gt;Iova, p. xlvi&lt;/ref&gt; The year also brought his presence at the funeral of A. D. Xenopol.&lt;ref name="ivxlvi"/&gt;

In 1921 and 1922, the Romanian scholar began lecturing abroad, most notably at the [[University of Paris]], while setting up a Romanian School in the French capital&lt;ref name="ivxlvi"/&gt; and the ''[[Accademia di Romania]]'' of [[Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Santoro, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921, when his 50th birthday was celebrated at a national level, Iorga published a large number of volumes, including a bibliographic study on the [[Wallachian uprising of 1821]] and its leader [[Tudor Vladimirescu]], an essay on [[political history]] (''Dezvoltarea așezămintelor politice'', "The Development of Political Institutions"), ''Secretul culturii franceze'' ("The Secret of [[French culture|French Culture]]"), ''Războiul nostru în note zilnice'' ("Our War as Depicted in Daily Records") and the French-language ''Les Latins de l'Orient'' ("The Oriental [[Italic peoples|Latins]]").&lt;ref name="ivxlvi"/&gt; His interest in Vladimirescu and his historical role was also apparent in an eponymous play, published with a volume of Iorga's selected [[lyric poetry]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 1010. See also Iova, p. xlvi&lt;/ref&gt;

In politics, Iorga began objecting to the National Liberals' hold on power, denouncing the [[Romanian general election, 1922|1922 election]] as a [[Electoral fraud|fraud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Marin Pop, [http://www.caietesilvane.ro/indexcs.php?cmd=articol&amp;idart=714 "Alegerile parlamentare din anul 1922 în județul Sălaj"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002145806/http://www.caietesilvane.ro/indexcs.php?cmd=articol&amp;idart=714 |date=2015-10-02 }}, in ''Caiete Silvane'', June 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He resumed his close cooperation with the PNR, briefly joining the party ranks in an attempt to counter this monopoly.&lt;ref name="zomemor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gifcoresp3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="icstructura"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neubauer, p. 164; Veiga, pp. 99–100&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923, he donated his Bonaparte Highway residence and its collection to the Ministry of Education, to be used by a cultural foundation and benefit university students.&lt;ref name="ivxlvii"&gt;Iova, p. xlvii&lt;/ref&gt; Receiving another ''honoris causa'' doctorate, from the [[University of Lyon]], Iorga went through an episode of reconciliation with [[Tudor Arghezi]], who addressed him public praise.&lt;ref&gt;Iova, pp. xlvi–xlvii&lt;/ref&gt; The two worked together on ''[[Cuget Românesc]]'' newspaper, but were again at odds when Iorga began criticizing [[modernist literature]] and "the world's spiritual crisis".&lt;ref name="gscursa"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Geo Șerban]], [http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/articol.php?cod=8640 "Cursă de urmărire, cu suspans, prin intersecțiile avangărzii la români"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317053743/http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/articol.php?cod=8640 |date=2012-03-17 }}, in ''[[Lettre Internationale]]'' Romanian edition, Nr. 58, Summer 2006 (republished by [http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/ ''România Culturală'']  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902021335/http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/ |date=2011-09-02 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

Among his published works for that year were ''Formes byzantines et réalités balcaniques'' ("Byzantine Forms and Balkan Realities"), ''Istoria presei românești'' ("The History of the Romanian Press"), ''L'Art populaire en Roumanie'' ("Folk Art in Romania"), ''Istoria artei medievale'' ("The History of [[Medieval art|Medieval Art]]") and ''Neamul românesc din Ardeal'' ("The Romanian Nation in Transylvania").&lt;ref&gt;Iova, p. xlvi. See also Tanașoca, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; Iorga had by then finished several new theatrical plays: ''Moartea lui Dante'' ("The Death of [[Dante Aligheri|Dante]]"), ''Molière se răzbună'' ("[[Molière]] Gets His Revenge"), ''Omul care ni trebuie'' ("The Man We Need") and ''Sărmală, amicul poporului'' ("Sărmală, Friend of the People").&lt;ref&gt;Iova, p. xlvi.

===International initiatives and American journey===

[[File:Professeur Jorga, Exposition d'Aviculture 1928, Meurisse.jpg|thumb|Iorga in [[Versailles (commune)|Versailles]], 1928 photograph]]

A major moment in Iorga's European career took place in 1924, when he convened in Bucharest the first-ever [[International Congress of Byzantine Studies]], attended by some of the leading experts in the field.&lt;ref name="ivxlvii"/&gt; He also began lecturing at [[Ramiro Ortiz (academic)|Ramiro Ortiz]]'s Italian Institute in Bucharest.&lt;ref&gt;Santoro, pp. 114–115&lt;/ref&gt; Also then, Iorga was appointed Aggregate Professor by the University of Paris, received the honor of having foreign scholars lecturing at the Vălenii de Munte school, and published a number of scientific works and essays, such as: ''Brève histoire des croissades'' ("A Short History of the Crusades"), ''Cărți reprezentative din viața omenirii'' ("Books Significant for Mankind's Existence"), ''România pitorească'' ("Picturesque Romania") and a volume of addresses to the [[Romanian American]] community.&lt;ref name="ivxlvii"/&gt; In 1925, when he was elected a member of the [[Polish Academy of Learning|Kraków Academy of Learning]] in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], Iorga gave conferences in various European countries, including [[Switzerland]] (where he spoke at a [[League of Nations]] assembly on the state of [[Minorities of Romania|Romania's minorities]]).&lt;ref name="ivxlvii"/&gt; His bibliography for 1925 includes some 50 titles.&lt;ref name="ivxlvii"/&gt; Iorga also increased his personal fortune, constructing villas in two resort towns: in [[Sinaia]] (designer: [[Toma T. Socolescu]]) and, later, [[Mangalia]].&lt;ref name="ln(07)126"&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; More controversial still was his decision to use excess funds from the International Congress to improve his Vălenii printing press.&lt;ref name="ln(07)126"/&gt;

Iorga was again abroad in 1926 and 1927, lecturing on various subjects at reunions in France, Italy, Switzerland, [[Denmark]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]] and the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], many of his works being by then translated into French, English, German and Italian.&lt;ref name="ivxlvii-xlviii"&gt;Iova, pp. xlvii–xlviii&lt;/ref&gt; His work for 1926 centered on the first of four volumes in his series ''Essai de synthèse de l'histoire de l'humanité'' ("Essay on the Synthesis of World History"), followed in 1927 by ''Istoria industriei la români'' ("The History of Industry among the Romanians"), ''Originea și sensul democrației'' ("The Origin and Sense of Democracy"), a study of Romanian contributions to the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|1877–1878 Russo-Turkish War]] (''Războiul de independență'', "The War of Independence") etc.&lt;ref name="ivxlvii-xlviii"/&gt; At home, the PND's merge into the PNR, accepted by Iorga, was stopped once the historian asked to become the resulting union's chief.&lt;ref name="icstructura"/&gt; Acting PNR leader [[Iuliu Maniu]] successfully resisted this move, and the two parties split over the issue.&lt;ref name="icstructura"/&gt;

For a while in 1927, Iorga was also local leader of the [[Paneuropean Union|Pan-European movement]], created internationally by [[Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi|Graf Coudenhove-Kalergi]].&lt;ref&gt;Guida, p. 238; Nicolae M. Nicolae, "Europa lui Coudenhove-Kalergi", in ''[[Magazin Istoric]]'', July 2002, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; A ''honoris causa'' doctor of [[University of Genoa|Genoa University]], he opened his course at the University of Paris with lectures on France's [[Levant]]ine policy (1927) and, during 1928, was again invited to lecture in Spain, Sweden and [[Norway]].&lt;ref name="ivxlviii"&gt;Iova, p. xlviii&lt;/ref&gt; His published works for that time grouped the political essay ''Evoluția ideii de libertate'' ("The Evolution of Liberty as an Idea"), new historical studies and printed versions of his conferences: ''Istoria învățământului'' ("The History of Education"), ''Patru conferințe despre istoria Angliei'' ("Four Conferences on the [[History of England]]"), ''Țara latină cea mai îndepărtată din Europa: Portugalia'' ("The Remotest Latin Country in Europe: [[Portugal]]").&lt;ref&gt;Iova, pp. xlviii–xlix&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his Bucharest Faculty of History chair, Iorga also took over the History of Literature course hosted by the same institution (1928).&lt;ref name="ivxlviii"/&gt;

Appointed the university's [[Rector (academia)|Rector]] in 1929, he followed up with new sets of conferences in France, Italy or Spain, and published some 40 new books on topics such as [[Folklore of Romania|Romanian folklore]] and [[History of Scandinavia|Scandinavian history]].&lt;ref name="ivxlix"&gt;Iova, p. xlix&lt;/ref&gt; For a while, he also held the University's concise literature course, replacing Professor [[Ioan Bianu]].&lt;ref name="zoistlit"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Z. Ornea]], [http://www.romlit.ro/n._iorga-_istoric_literar "N. Iorga - istoric literar"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 43/1999&lt;/ref&gt; Iorga's circle was joined by researcher [[Constantin C. Giurescu]], son of historian [[Constantin Giurescu]], who had been Iorga's rival a generation before.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 324–325, 386–387, 479–480&lt;/ref&gt;

Iorga embarked on a longer journey during 1930: again lecturing in Paris during January, he left for Genoa and, from there, traveled to the [[United States]], visiting some 20 cities, being greeted by the Romanian-American community and meeting with [[President of the United States|President]] [[Herbert Hoover]].&lt;ref&gt;Iova, p. xlix. See also Ornea (1995), p. 396&lt;/ref&gt; He was also an honored guest of [[Case Western Reserve University]], where he delivered a lecture in English.&lt;ref name="kkzodie"/&gt; Returning to attend the London International Congress of History, Iorga was also made a ''honoris causa'' doctor by the [[University of Oxford]] (with a reception speech likening him to both [[Livy]] and [[Pliny the Elder]]).&lt;ref name="ivxlix"/&gt; That year, he also set up the ''[[Casa Romena]]'' institute in Venice.&lt;ref&gt;Santoro, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; His new works included ''America și românii din America'' ("Romania and the Romanians of America") and ''Priveliști elvețiene'' ("Swiss Landscapes"), alongside the plays ''Sfântul Francisc'' ("[[Francis of Assisi|Saint Francis]]") and ''Fiul cel pierdut'' ("The Lost Son").&lt;ref&gt;Iova, p. xlix. See also Călinescu, p. 1010&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931–1932, he was made a ''honoris causa'' doctor by four other universities (the University of Paris, [[University of Rome La Sapienza|La Sapienza]], [[Vilnius University|Stefan Batory]], [[Comenius University in Bratislava|Comenius]]), was admitted into both ''[[Accademia dei Lincei]]'' and the ''[[Academy of Arcadia|Accademia degli Arcadi]]'', and published over 40 new titles per year.&lt;ref name="ivl"&gt;Iova, p. l&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prime Minister===
[[File:Professeur Jorga, reçu docteur Honoris Causa 1931, Meurisse.jpg|thumb|Iorga at the [[University of Paris]], receiving his ''[[Honoris Causa]]'' Doctorate]]

Iorga became [[Prime Minister of Romania|Romanian Premier]] in April 1931, upon the request of Carol II, who had returned from exile to replace his own son, [[Michael I of Romania|Michael I]]. The [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] monarch had cemented this relationship by visiting the Vălenii de Munte establishment in July 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Brătescu, pp. 33–34&lt;/ref&gt; A contemporary historian, [[Hugh Seton-Watson]] (son of R.W. Seton-Watson), documented Carol's confiscation of agrarian politics for his own benefit, noting: "Professor Iorga's immense vanity delivered him into the king's hands."&lt;ref&gt;Seton-Watson, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; Iorga's imprudent ambition is mentioned by cultural historian [[Z. Ornea]], who also counts Iorga among those who had already opposed Carol's invalidation.&lt;ref name="zomemor"/&gt; In short while, Iorga's support for the controversial monarch resulted in his inevitable break with the PNR and PȚ. Their agrarian union, the [[National Peasants' Party]] (PNȚ), took distance from Carol's policies, whereas Iorga prioritized his "Carlist" [[monarchism]].&lt;ref name="zomemor"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Butaru, p. 306&lt;/ref&gt; For a while, Iorga was a member of the PNȚ,&lt;ref&gt;Veiga, pp. 99–100, 130&lt;/ref&gt; but rejected its policies. There was a running personal rivalry between him and PNȚ leader Iuliu Maniu,&lt;ref name="zomemor"/&gt; even though Iorga had on his side Maniu's own brother, lawyer Cassiu Maniu.&lt;ref name="iscoresp"/&gt;

Once confirmed on the throne, Carol experimented with [[technocracy]], borrowing professionals from various political groups, and closely linking Iorga with [[Ministry of Administration and Interior (Romania)|Internal Affairs Minister]] [[Constantin Argetoianu]].&lt;ref name="zomemor"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), pp. 226, 265, 296; Veiga, pp. 126–131, 200–201&lt;/ref&gt; Iorga survived the [[Romanian general election, 1931|election of June]], in which he led a National Union coalition, with support from his rivals, the National Liberals.&lt;ref&gt;Guida, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; During his short term, he traveled throughout the country, visiting around 40 cities and towns,&lt;ref name="ivl"/&gt; and was notably on a state visit to France, being received by [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] [[Aristide Briand]] and by Briand's ally [[André Tardieu]].&lt;ref name="fg238"&gt;Guida, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition of his merits as an [[Albanology|Albanologist]], the [[Kingdom of Albania (1928–39)|Albanian Kingdom]] granted Iorga property in [[Sarandë]] town, on which the scholar created a Romanian Archeological Institute.&lt;ref name="kkzodie"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tănase Bujduveanu, "Institutul român din Albania", in ''[[Magazin Istoric]]'', March 2011, pp. 28–32&lt;/ref&gt;

The backdrop to Iorga's mandate was Carol's conflict with the [[Iron Guard]], an increasingly popular [[Fascism|fascist]] organization. In March 1932, Iorga signed a decree outlawing the movement, the beginning of his clash with the Guard's founder [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]].&lt;ref&gt;Butaru, p. 161, 169; Iova, p. l; Ornea (1995), pp. 173, 235, 243, 296; Volovici, p. 154. See also Veiga, pp. 137–138&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, his new [[Education in Romania|education law]] enhancing university autonomy, for which Iorga had been campaigning since the 1920s, was openly challenged as unrealistic by fellow scholar [[Florian Ștefănescu-Goangă]], who noted that it only encouraged political agitators to place themselves outside the state.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 58, 81&lt;/ref&gt; Also holding the office of Education Minister, he allowed auditing students to attend university lectures without holding a [[Romanian Baccalaureate]] degree.&lt;ref&gt;In doing so, Iorga answered a call by world-famous physicist [[Albert Einstein]] to grant Einstein's Romanian pupil Melania Șerbu an educational opportunity.

The major issue facing Iorga was the economic crisis, part of the [[Great Depression]], and he was largely unsuccessful in tackling it.&lt;ref name="zomemor"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 82; Ornea (1995), p. 296; Veiga, pp. 130–131&lt;/ref&gt; To the detriment of financial markets, the cabinet tried to implement [[debt relief]] for bankrupt land cultivators,&lt;ref&gt;Veiga, pp. 140–141&lt;/ref&gt; and signed an agreement with [[Argentina]], another exporter of agricultural produce, to try to limit [[deflation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Dumitru Șandru, [http://www.sferapoliticii.ro/sfera/133/art09-sandru.html "Criza din 1929 - 1933 și criza actuală"], in ''[[Sfera Politicii]]'', Nr. 133&lt;/ref&gt; The mishandling of economic affairs made the historian a target of derision and indignation among the general public.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 82; Veiga, pp. 156–157&lt;/ref&gt; The reduction of [[Government budget deficit|deficit]] with pay cuts for all state employees ("sacrificial curves") or selective [[layoff]]s was particularly dramatic, leading to widespread disillusionment among the middle class, which only increased grassroots support for the Iron Guard.&lt;ref name="zomemor"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Veiga, pp. 156–158&lt;/ref&gt; Other controversial aspects were his alleged favoritism and [[nepotism]]: perceived as the central figure of an academic clique, Iorga helped [[Gheorghe Bogdan-Duică]]'s family and Pârvan, promoted young historian [[Andrei Oțetea]], and made his son in law Colonel Chirescu (m. Florica Iorga in 1918) a Prefect of [[Storojineț County]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 114, 120, 131, 150, 250, 275–278, 287, 306–307, 324–332, 506–507&lt;/ref&gt; His premiership also evidenced the growing tensions between the PND in Bucharest and its former allies in Transylvania: Iorga arrived to power after rumors of a PNȚ "Transylvanian conspiracy", and his cabinet included no Romanian Transylvanian politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Guida, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; It was however open to members of the [[Transylvanian Saxons|Saxon community]], and Iorga himself created a new government position for [[Minorities of Romania|ethnic minority]] affairs.&lt;ref name="jn165"&gt;Neubauer, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicolae Iorga presented his cabinet's resignation in May 1932, returning to academic life. This came after an understanding between Carol II and a rightist PNȚ faction, who took over with [[Alexandru Vaida-Voevod]] as Premier.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), pp. 226, 296–297; Seton-Watson, p. 205; Veiga, pp. 130–131, 138&lt;/ref&gt; The PND, running in elections under a square-in-square logo (回),&lt;ref&gt;Radu, pp. 577–578&lt;/ref&gt; was rapidly becoming a minor force in Romanian politics. It survived through alliances with the National Liberals or with Averescu, while Argetoianu left it to establish an equally small agrarian group.&lt;ref&gt;Veiga, pp. 215, 235, 247–248. See also Radu, p. 579&lt;/ref&gt; Iorga concentrated on redacting memoirs, published as ''Supt trei regi'' ("Under Three Kings"), whereby he intended to counter political hostility.&lt;ref name="zomemor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gc614-615"&gt;Călinescu, pp. 614–615&lt;/ref&gt; He also created the Museum of Sacred Art, housed by the [[Crețulescu Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Andrei Pippidi]], [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/sectiune/ieri-cu-vedere-spre-azi/articol/o-expozitie-formidabila "O expoziție formidabilă "], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Nr. 292, September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mid 1930s conflicts===
[[Image:Cuget Clar - Coperta - 2 martie 1939.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''[[Cuget Clar]]'', issue no. 34, dated March 2, 1939]]

The political conflicts were by then reflected in Iorga's academic life: Iorga was becoming strongly opposed to a new generation of professional historians, which included Giurescu the younger, [[P. P. Panaitescu]] and [[Gheorghe Brătianu]]. At the core, it was a scientific dispute: all three historians, grouped around the new ''[[Revista Istorică Română]]'', found Iorga's studies to be speculative, politicized or needlessly [[Didacticism|didactic]] in their conclusions.&lt;ref name="lb(00)101-106"&gt;Boia (2000), pp. 101–106&lt;/ref&gt; The political discrepancy was highlighted by the more radical support these academics were directing toward King Carol II.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 325–326&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, Iorga also feuded with his Transylvanian disciple [[Lucian Blaga]], trying in vain to block Blaga's reception to the Academy over differences in philosophy and literary preference.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2003), pp. 189, 192, 204–205, 207–209; (2007), pp. 506–507&lt;/ref&gt; On Blaga's side, the quarrel involved philologist and civil servant [[Bazil Munteanu]]; his correspondence with Blaga features hostile remarks about Iorga's "vulgarity" and cultural politics.&lt;ref name="pccarti"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Pavel Chihaia]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/index.html/articles|details?articleID=16182 "Printre cărți și manuscrise"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 339, September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

On his way to a pan-European congress, Iorga stirred further controversy by attending, in Rome, the tenth anniversary of the [[March on Rome|1922 March]], celebrating [[Italian Fascism]].&lt;ref&gt;Veiga, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; He resumed his participation in conference cycles during 1933, revisiting France, as well as taking back his position at the University of Bucharest; he published another 37 books and, in August 1933, attended the History Congress in [[Warsaw]].&lt;ref name="ivl"/&gt; His new project was a cultural version of the [[Polish–Romanian Alliance]], working together with poet-diplomat [[Aron Cotruș]] to increase awareness of his country, and publishing his own work in the Polish press.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Nicolae Mareș, [http://www.revistaluceafarul.ro/index.html?id=2911&amp;editie=125 "Aron Cotruș – scriitor și diplomat - 120 de ani de la naștere"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007023922/http://www.revistaluceafarul.ro/index.html?id=2911&amp;editie=125 |date=2011-10-07 }}, in ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]'', Nr. 1/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in 1934, Iorga issued a condemnation of the Iron Guard, following the assassination of National Liberal Premier [[Ion G. Duca]] by a [[Iron Guard death squads|Legionary death squad]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the subsequent police round-ups of Guardist activists, Iorga intervened for the release of fascist philosopher [[Nae Ionescu]],&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; and still invited Guardist poet [[Radu Gyr]] to lecture at Vălenii.&lt;ref&gt;Brătescu, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, he was again focusing his attention on the condemnation of modernists and the poetry of Arghezi, first with the overview ''Istoria literaturii românești contemporane'' ("History of Contemporary Romanian Literature"), then with his press polemics.&lt;ref name="agrevenind4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Livezeanu, p. 117; Ornea (1995), pp. 444–449, 452. See also Călinescu, p. 977&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1934, Iorga also published a book which coined his image of Romania's [[Early Modern Romania|early modern culture]]—''Byzance après Byzance'' ("Byzantium after Byzantium"), alongside the three-volume ''Histoire de la vie byzantine'' ("A History of Byzantine Life").&lt;ref&gt;Iova, p. l. See also Neubauer, p. 164; Setton, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; He followed up with a volume of memoirs ''Orizonturile mele. O viață de om așa cum a fost'' ("My Horizons.

Iorga again toured Europe in 1935, and, upon his return to Romania, gave a new set of conferences under the auspices of the Cultural League,&lt;ref name="ivli"&gt;Iova, p. li&lt;/ref&gt; inviting scholar [[Franz Babinger]] to lecture at the ISSEE.&lt;ref&gt;Eugen Ciurtin, "Eastern Europe", in Gregory D.

Early in 1936, Nicolae Iorga was again lecturing at the University of Paris, and gave an additional conference at the ''[[Société des études historiques]]'', before hosting the Bucharest session of the International Committee of Historians.&lt;ref name="ivli"/&gt; He was also in the [[Netherlands]], with a lecture on Byzantine [[social history]]: ''L'Homme byzantin'' ("Byzantine Man").&lt;ref name="mmhomob"&gt;{{ro icon}} Mircea Muthu, [http://www.phantasma.ro/caiete/caiete/caiete3/04.html "Homo balcanicus"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727134615/http://www.phantasma.ro/caiete/caiete/caiete3/04.html |date=2011-07-27 }}, in ''[http://phantasma.ro/caiete.html Caietele Echinox] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625073339/http://phantasma.ro/caiete.html |date=2008-06-25 }}'', Vol. 3, [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://phantasma.ro/ Center for Imagination Studies] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429090728/http://www.phantasma.ro/ |date=2009-04-29 }}, Cluj-Napoca, 2002, pp. 43–51. {{ISBN|973-35-1355-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his return, wishing to renew his campaign against the modernists, Iorga founded ''[[Cuget Clar]]'', the neo-''Sămănătorist'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), p. 445&lt;/ref&gt;

By that moment in time, he was publicly voicing his concern that Transylvania was a target of expansion for [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Regency-period Hungary]], while cautioning the public against [[Nazi Germany]] and its [[revanchism]].&lt;ref&gt;Brătescu, pp. 69, 77; Iova, pp. li–lii; Volovici, pp. 151–152, 154, 157&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, he was concerned about the Soviet threat and the fate of Romanians in the Soviet Union, working closely with the [[Transnistria]]n [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] refugee [[Nichita Smochină]].&lt;ref&gt;Brătescu, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Such worries were notably expressed by Iorga in a series of [[Romanian Radio Broadcasting Company|Bucharest Radio]] broadcasts, ''Sfaturi pe întuneric'' ("Advice at Dark", soon after published in brochure format).&lt;ref&gt;Iova, p. lii. See also Călinescu, p. 1010; Nastasă (2007), p. 523&lt;/ref&gt; He completed several new volumes, among which were ''Dovezi despre conștiința originii românilor'' ("Evidence on the Conscious [[Origin of the Romanians]]"), the polemical essay ''Lupta mea contra prostiei'' ("My Fight against Stupidity"), and the first two volumes of the long planned ''Istoria românilor''.&lt;ref name="ivlii"&gt;Iova, p. lii&lt;/ref&gt;

===1937 retirement and Codreanu trials===

Nicolae Iorga was officially honored in 1937, when Carol II inaugurated a Bucharest Museum of World History, placed under the ISSEE director's presidency.&lt;ref name="so&amp;gh64"&gt;Olaru &amp; Herbstritt, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; However, the publicized death threats he received from the Iron Guard eventually prompted Iorga to retire from his university position.&lt;ref name="ivliii"&gt;Iova, p. liii&lt;/ref&gt; He withdrew to Vălenii de Munte, but was still active on the academic scene, lecturing on "the development of the human spirit" at the World History Institute, and being received as a corresponding member into [[Chile]]'s [[Chilean Academy of History|Academy of History]].&lt;ref name="ivliii"/&gt; He also mentored German biographer [[Eugen Wolbe]], who collected data on the Romanian kings.&lt;ref name="afferdbio"/&gt; This contribution was doubled by a steady participation in the country's political life. Iorga attended the Cultural League congress in Iași, where he openly demanded for the Iron Guard to be outlawed on the grounds that it served Nazi interests, and discussed the threat of war in his speeches at Vălenii de Munte and his Radio conferences.&lt;ref&gt;Iova, p. liii. See also Ornea (1995), p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; With his ''Neamul Românesc'' disciple N. Georgescu-Cocoș, he was also continuing his fight against modernism, inspiring a special Romanian Academy report on the modernists' "[[pornography]]".&lt;ref name="ascboxa"&gt;{{ro icon}} Adina-Ștefania Ciurea, [http://www.romlit.ro/scriitori_n_boxa_acuzailor "Scriitori în boxa acuzaților"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120811190656/http://www.romlit.ro/scriitori_n_boxa_acuzailor |date=2012-08-11 }}, in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 33/2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The early months of 1938 saw Nicolae Iorga joining the [[national unity government]] of [[Miron Cristea]], formed by Carol II's right-wing power base.&lt;ref&gt;Crampton, pp. 115–116; Santoro, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Crown Council of Romania|Crown Councillor]], he then threw his reluctant support behind the [[National Renaissance Front]], created by Carol II as the driving force of a pro-fascist but anti-Guard [[one-party state]] (''see [[1938 Constitution of Romania]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Țurlea, ''passim''; Veiga, pp. 245–248, 250, 262–265. See also Butaru, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; Iorga was upset by the imposition of uniforms on all public officials, calling it "tyrannical", and privately ridiculed the new constitutional regime's architects, but he eventually complied to the changes.&lt;ref&gt;Țurlea, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; In April, Iorga was also at the center of a scandal which resulted in Codreanu's arrest and eventual [[extrajudicial killing]]. By then, the historian had attacked the Guard's policy of setting up small commercial enterprises and charity ventures. This prompted Codreanu to address him an [[open letter]], which accused Iorga of being dishonest.&lt;ref&gt;Deletant, pp. 34, 43–44; Ornea (1995), pp. 314–316, 336–337; Veiga, pp. 250, 271&lt;/ref&gt; Premier [[Armand Călinescu]], who had already ordered a clampdown on Guardist activities, seized Iorga's demand for satisfaction as an opportunity, ordering Carol's rival to be tried for [[libel]]—the preamble to an extended trial on grounds of [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Deletant, pp. 34–35, 43–44; Ornea (1995), p. 316; Veiga, pp. 250–251, 271–272&lt;/ref&gt; An unexpected consequence of this move was the protest resignation of General [[Ion Antonescu]] from the office of [[Ministry of National Defense (Romania)|Defense Minister]].&lt;ref&gt;Deletant, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

Iorga himself refused to attend the trial; in letters he addressed to the judges, he asked the count of libel to be withdrawn, and advised that Codreanu should follow the [[insanity defense]] on the other accusations.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), pp. 316–317&lt;/ref&gt; Iorga's attention then moved to other activities: he was Romanian Commissioner for the 1938 [[Venice Biennale]],&lt;ref name="sedint"&gt;[http://www.seductiveness-of-interval.ro/pages/istoric_en.swf "History"]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, at the [https://web.archive.org/web/20090422164129/http://www.seductiveness-of-interval.ro/ Venice Biennale Romanian Pavilion: ''Seductiveness of Interval'']; retrieved February 23, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and supportive of the effort to establish a Romanian school of genealogists.&lt;ref&gt;Rădulescu, p. 342&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, as the Guard's campaign of retribution had degenerated into [[terrorism]], Iorga used the Senate tribune to address the issue and demand measures to curb the violence.&lt;ref name="ivliii-liv"&gt;Iova, pp. liii–liv&lt;/ref&gt; He was absent for part of the year, again lecturing in Paris.&lt;ref name="sț47"&gt;Țurlea, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; Steadily publishing new volumes of ''Istoria românilor'', he also completed work on several other books: in 1938, ''Întru apărarea graniței de Apus'' ("For the Defense of the Western Frontier"), ''Cugetare și faptă germană'' ("German Thought and Action"), ''Hotare și spații naționale'' ("National Borders and Spaces"); in 1939 ''Istoria Bucureștilor'' ("[[History of Bucharest]]"), ''Discursuri parlamentare'' ("Parliamentary Addresses"), ''Istoria universală văzută prin literatură'' ("World History as Seen through Literature"), ''Naționaliști și frontiere'' ("Nationalists and Frontiers"), ''Stări sufletești și războaie'' ("Spiritual States and Wars"), ''Toate poeziile lui N. Iorga'' ("N. Iorga's Complete Poetry") and two new volumes of ''Memorii''.&lt;ref name="ivliii-liv"/&gt; Also in 1938, Iorga inaugurated the open-air theater of Vălenii de Munte with one of his own dramatic texts, ''Răzbunarea pământului'' ("The Earth's Revenge").&lt;ref name="ivliii"/&gt; The total number of titles he presented for publishing in 1939 is 45, including a play about [[Christina of Sweden]] (''Regele Cristina'', "King C[h]ristina")&lt;ref name="ivliv"&gt;Iova, p. liv&lt;/ref&gt; and an anti-war cycle of poems.&lt;ref name="nmpolonia"/&gt; Some of his [[Anglophile]] essays were printed by [[Mihail Fărcășanu]] in ''Rumanian Quarterly'', which sought to preserve [[Romania – United Kingdom relations|Anglo–Romanian cooperation]].&lt;ref name="azsistemul"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Alexandru Zub]], [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/ZUBfeb5.html "Sistemul de la Versailles.

Iorga was again Romanian Commissioner of the Venice Biennale in 1940.&lt;ref name="sedint"/&gt; The accelerated political developments led him to focus on his activities as a militant and journalist. His output for 1940 included a large number of conferences and articles dedicated to the preservation of Greater Romania's borders and the anti-Guardist cause: ''Semnul lui Cain'' ("The [[Mark of Cain]]"), ''Ignoranța stăpâna lumii'' ("Ignorance, Mistress of the World"), ''Drumeț în calea lupilor'' ("A Wayfarer Facing Wolves") etc.&lt;ref name="ivliv"/&gt; Iorga was troubled by the outbreak of [[World War II]] and saddened by the [[fall of France]], events which formed the basis of his essay ''Amintiri din locurile tragediilor actuale'' ("Recollections from the Current Scenes of a Tragedy").&lt;ref name="ivliv"/&gt; He was also working on a version of ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'', a tragedy which probably reflected his concern about Romania, her allies, and the uncertain political future.&lt;ref name="nmpolonia"/&gt;

===Iorga's murder===
The year 1940 saw the collapse of Carol II's regime. The unexpected [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|cession of Bessarabia to the Soviets]] shocked Romanian society and greatly angered Iorga.&lt;ref name="ihstere2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brătescu, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; At the two sessions of the Crown Council held on June 27, he was one of six (out of 21) members to reject the Soviet ultimatum demanding Bessarabia's handover, instead calling vehemently for armed resistance.&lt;ref name="ihstere2"/&gt; Later, the Nazi-mediated [[Second Vienna Award]] made [[Northern Transylvania]] a part of Hungary. This loss sparked a political and moral crisis, eventually leading to the establishment of a [[National Legionary State]] with Ion Antonescu as ''[[Conducător]]'' and the Iron Guard as a governing political force. In the wake of this reshuffling, Iorga decided to close down his ''Neamul Românesc'', explaining: "When a defeat is registered, the flag is not surrendered, but its fabric is wrapped around the heart. The heart of our struggle was the national cultural idea."&lt;ref name="ivliv"/&gt; Perceived as Codreanu's murderer, he received renewed threats from the Iron Guard, including [[hate mail]], attacks in the movement's press (''[[Buna Vestire]]'' and ''[[Porunca Vremii]]'')&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), p. 335. See also Iova, p. liii&lt;/ref&gt; and tirades from the Guardist section in Vălenii.&lt;ref&gt;Brătescu, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; He further antagonized the new government by stating his attachment to the abdicated royal.&lt;ref name="jn164"&gt;Neubauer, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicolae Iorga was forced out of Bucharest (where he owned a new home in [[Dorobanți]] quarter)&lt;ref name="apbucurestii"/&gt; and Vălenii de Munte by the [[1940 Vrancea earthquake|massive earthquake of November]]. He then moved to Sinaia, where he gave the finishing touches to his book ''Istoriologia umană'' ("Human [[Historiography|Historiology]]").&lt;ref&gt;Iova, p. lv. See also Brătescu, pp. 81, 84; Nastasă (2007), p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; He was kidnapped by a Guardist squad, the best-known member of which was agricultural engineer Traian Boeru,&lt;ref&gt;Veiga, p. 310&lt;/ref&gt; on the afternoon of November 27, and killed in the vicinity of [[Târgșoru Vechi|Strejnic]] (some distance from the city of [[Ploiești]]). He was shot at some nine times in all, with 7.65&amp;nbsp;mm and 6.35&amp;nbsp;mm handguns.&lt;ref name="ivlv"&gt;Iova, p. lv&lt;/ref&gt; Iorga's killing is often mentioned in tandem with that of agrarian politician [[Virgil Madgearu]], kidnapped and murdered by the Guardists on the same night, and with the [[Jilava Massacre]] (during which Carol II's administrative apparatus was decimated).&lt;ref&gt;Brătescu, p. 82; Crampton, p. 118; Deletant, pp. 60–61; Ornea (1995), pp. 19, 196, 209–210, 339–341, 347, 357; Veiga, pp. 292–295, 309–310; Seton-Watson, pp. 214–215&lt;/ref&gt; These acts of retribution, placed in connection with the discovery and reburial of Codreanu's remains, were carried out independently by the Guard, and enhanced tensions between it and Antonescu.&lt;ref&gt;Deletant, pp. 60–61; Ornea (1995), pp. 339–343&lt;/ref&gt;

Iorga's death caused much consternation among the general public, and was received with particular concern by the academic community. Forty-seven universities worldwide flew their flags at [[half-staff]].&lt;ref name="ivlv"/&gt; A funeral speech was delivered by the exiled French historian [[Henri Focillon]], from [[New York City]], calling Iorga "one of those legendary personalities planted, for eternity, in the soil of a country and the history of human intelligence."&lt;ref name="ivlv"/&gt; At home, the Iron Guard banned all public [[mourning]], excepting an [[obituary]] in ''[[Universul]]'' daily and a ceremony hosted by the Romanian Academy.&lt;ref&gt;Iova, pp. lv–lvi. See also Ornea (1995), pp. 340–341&lt;/ref&gt; The final oration was delivered by philosopher [[Constantin Rădulescu-Motru]], who noted, in terms akin to those used by Focillon, that the murdered scientist had stood for "our nation's intellectual prowess", "the full cleverness and originality of the Romanian genius".&lt;ref&gt;Iova, pp. lv–lvi&lt;/ref&gt;

Iorga's remains were buried at [[Bellu Cemetery|Bellu]], in Bucharest, on the same day as Madgearu's funeral—the attendants, who included some of the surviving interwar politicians and foreign diplomats, defied the Guard's ban with their presence.&lt;ref&gt;Brătescu, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; Iorga's last texts, recovered by his young disciple [[G. Brătescu]], were kept by literary critic [[Șerban Cioculescu]] and published at a later date.&lt;ref&gt;Brătescu, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gheorghe Brătianu]] later took over Iorga's position at the South-East Europe Institute&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; and the Institute of World History (known as [[Nicolae Iorga Institute of History|Nicolae Iorga Institute]] from 1941).&lt;ref name="so&amp;gh64"/&gt;

==Political outlook==

===Conservatism and nationalism===
Nicolae Iorga's views on society and politics stood at the meeting point of [[traditional conservatism]], [[ethnic nationalism]] and [[national conservatism]]. This fusion is identified by political scientist [[Ioan Stanomir]] as a mutation of ''[[Junimea]]''{{'}}s ideology, running contrary to [[Titu Maiorescu]]'s [[liberal conservatism]], but resonating with the ideology of Romania's [[national poet]], [[Mihai Eminescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Stanomir, ''Spiritul'', pp. 8–9, 102, 104-105, 112-119&lt;/ref&gt; A maverick ''Junimist'', Eminescu added to the conservative vision of his contemporaries an intense nationalism with [[reactionary]], [[Racism|racist]] and [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]] tinges, for which he received posthumous attention in Iorga's lifetime.&lt;ref name="omintelect"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Both, ''passim''; Butaru, pp. 13, 64–87, 89, 95–96, 108, 112, 123, 158, 252–254, 316–317; Stanomir, ''Spiritul'', pp. 8–9, 104–105, 108-110, 113, 114, 147–155, 198–206&lt;/ref&gt; Identified by researcher Ioana Both as a source for the "Eminescu myth", Iorga saw in him the poet of "healthy race" ideas and the "integral expression of the Romanian soul", rather than a melancholy artist.&lt;ref&gt;Both, pp. 31–32&lt;/ref&gt; This ideological source shaped the attitudes of many ''[[Sămănătorul|Sămănătorists]]'', eroding ''Junimea''{{'}}s influence and redefining Romanian conservatism for the space of one generation.&lt;ref&gt;Both, pp. 31–32; Butaru, pp. 95–96; Stanomir, ''Spiritul'', pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; A definition provided by political scientist [[John Hutchinson (academic)|John Hutchinson]] lists Iorga among those who embraced "[[cultural nationalism]]", which rejected [[modernization]], as opposed to "political nationalism", which sought to modernize the nation-state.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandrescu, pp. 142, 158&lt;/ref&gt;

Borrowing Maiorescu's theory about how [[Westernization]] had come to Romania as "forms without concept" (meaning that some modern customs had been forced on top of local traditions), Iorga likewise aimed it against the [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|liberal establishment]], but gave it a more radical expression.&lt;ref&gt;Stanomir, ''Spiritul'', pp. 102, 112–121; Nastasă (2007), pp. 42, 169, 496–502, 508–509, 515–517, 528. See also Călinescu, p. 977&lt;/ref&gt; A significant point of continuity between ''Junimism'' and Iorga was the notion of two "positive" [[social class]]es, both opposed to the [[bourgeoisie]]: the lower class, represented by the peasantry, and the aristocratic class of [[boyar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1998), p. 272; Stanomir, ''Spiritul'', pp. 113–121, 228–230; Veiga, pp. 164–166, 175–176&lt;/ref&gt; Like Maiorescu, Iorga attacked the [[Centralized government|centralizing]] [[1866 Constitution of Romania|1866 Constitution]], to which he opposed a statehood based on "organic" growth, with self-aware local communities as a source of legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;Stanomir, ''Spiritul'', pp. 114–121, 127, 138, 176–189, 224–234. See also Czobor-Lupp, pp. 122–123, 125–126, 129–131&lt;/ref&gt; Also resonating with the ''Junimist'' club was Iorga's vision of the [[French Revolution]]—according to French author [[René Girault]], the Romanian was an "excellent connaisseur" of this particular era.&lt;ref name="rg415-416"&gt;[[René Girault]], ''Être historien des relations internationales'', [[University of Paris 1 Pantheon-Sorbonne]], 1998, pp. 415–416. {{ISBN|2-85944-346-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revolutionary experience was, in Iorga's view, traumatic, while its liberal or [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] inheritors were [[Apostasy|apostates]] disturbing the traditional equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;Czobor-Lupp, pp. 130–131; Stanomir, ''Spiritul'', pp. 47, 113–114, 116–121, 127, 177, 180–184, 186, 232; Veiga, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; His response to the Jacobin model was an [[Anglophile]] and [[Alexis de Tocqueville|Tocquevillian]] position, favoring the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British constitutional system]] and praising the [[American Revolution]] as the positive example of [[nation-building]].&lt;ref&gt;Stanomir, ''Spiritul'', pp. 120, 178–179, 181–183, 188–189, 231&lt;/ref&gt;

Like ''Junimism'', Iorga's conservatism did not generally rely on religion. A [[Secularism|secularist]] among the traditionalists, he did not attach a special meaning to [[Christian ethics]], and, praising the creative force of man, saw [[asceticism]] as a negative phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. III, pp. 56–61. See also Livezeanu, pp. 120, 122&lt;/ref&gt; However, he strongly identified the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]] and its [[hesychasm]] with the Romanian psyche, marginalizing the [[Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic|Latin Rite Church]] and the [[Transylvanian School]].&lt;ref name="ideol&amp;cult"/&gt; In rejecting pure [[individualism]], Iorga also reacted against the modern reverence toward [[Athenian democracy]] or the [[Protestant Reformation]], giving more positive appraisals to other community models: [[Sparta]], [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]], the [[Italian city-states]].&lt;ref&gt;Czobor-Lupp, pp. 122–130&lt;/ref&gt; As argued by political scientist Mihaela Czobor-Lupp, his was an "alternative" to the [[Rationalism|rationalist]] perspective, and a counterweight to [[Max Weber]]'s study on ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism|The Protestant Ethic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Czobor-Lupp, pp. 123, 126–131&lt;/ref&gt; His theories identified the people as a "natural entity [with] its own organic life", and sometimes justified the [[right of conquest]] when new civilizations toppled [[Societal collapse|decadent ones]]—the conflict, he argued, was between [[Heracles]] and [[Trimalchio]].&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. III, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; In his private and public life, Iorga's conservatism also came with [[Sexism|sexist]] remarks: like Maiorescu, Iorga believed that women only had a talent for nurturing and assisting male protagonists in public affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Alin Ciupală, ''Femeia în societatea românească a secolului al XIX-lea'', [[Editura Meridiane]], Bucharest, 2003, pp. 95, 109–110, 113. {{ISBN|973-33-0481-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the various similarities, Iorga and the ''Junimist'' loyalists became political enemies. Early on, Maiorescu would respond to his letters with disdain, while novelist [[Ioan Slavici]] called his irredentist projects "nonsense".&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 407, 508&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1920, ''[[Convorbiri Critice]]'' editor [[Mihail Dragomirescu]] accused those ''Junimists'' who followed Iorga's "[[Chauvinism|chauvinist]] nationalism" of having forgotten that Maiorescu's [[art for art's sake]] principles "substituted the political criterion of [[patriotism]] for the criterion of truth."&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1998), p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict between Iorga and Dragomirescu was also personal, and, as reported by Iorga's disciple [[Alexandru Lapedatu]], even caused the two to physically assault each other.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 309–310, 313–314&lt;/ref&gt;

Iorga's brand of national conservatism was more successful than its more conventional predecessor: while the [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880–1918)|Conservative Party]] disappeared from the public eye after 1918, Iorga's more nationalistic interpretation was still considered relevant in the 1930s. One of the last Conservative leaders, [[Nicolae Filipescu]], even pondered forging an alliance with the historian, in an attempt to save the group for dissolution.&lt;ref&gt;Stanomir, ''Spiritul'', p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ioan Stanomir, Iorga and fellow historian [[Ioan C. Filitti]] were together responsible for "the most memorable pages" in Romanian conservative theory for "the 1928–1938 decade".&lt;ref&gt;Stanomir, ''Spiritul'', p.7&lt;/ref&gt; In Stanomir's assessment, this last period of Iorga's activity also implied a move toward the main sources of traditional conservatism, bringing Iorga closer to the line of thought represented by [[Edmund Burke]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] or [[Mihail Kogălniceanu]], and away from that of Eminescu.&lt;ref&gt;Stanomir, ''Spiritul'', pp. 7, 116–119, 176–189, 224–234&lt;/ref&gt;

The final years brought Iorga's stark condemnation of all [[etatism]], from the [[absolute monarchy]] to modern [[state capitalism]], accompanied by a [[dystopia]]n perspective on [[industrialization]] as the end of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Stanomir, ''Spiritul'', pp. 178–178, 185–186, 226–228, 233–234&lt;/ref&gt; Like Eminescu, Iorga was essentially a conservative [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] and economic [[Corporatism|corporatist]], who confessed his admiration for pre-modern [[guild]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Stanomir, ''Spiritul'', pp. 184–185, 233–234&lt;/ref&gt; In Stanomir's account, these ideals, alongside the dreams of a "ghostly" organic identity, anti-ideological [[monarchism]] and national regeneration, brought Iorga into Carol II's camp.&lt;ref&gt;Stanomir, ''Spiritul'', pp. 177–178&lt;/ref&gt; Another factor was the rise of Nazi Germany, which, Iorga thought, could only be met by national unity under a powerful ruler.&lt;ref name="sț47"/&gt; The realignment came with contradictory statements on Iorga's part, such as when, in 1939, he publicly described Carol's [[Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen]] house as having usurped the throne of ''[[Domnitor]]'' [[Alexander John Cuza|Alexander John I]], statements which enraged monarchist writer [[Gala Galaction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ioana Pârvulescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/statuia_lui_carol_i "Statuia lui Carol I"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 49/2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Iorga found himself in Kogălniceanu's conservative statement, "civilization stops when revolutions begin",&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerzy W. Borejsza]], "The French Revolution in Relation to Poland and East-Central Europe", in Joseph Klaits, Michael H. Haltzel (eds.), ''Global Ramifications of the French Revolution'', [[Cambridge University Press]], Cambridge etc., 2002, p. 65. {{ISBN|0-521-52447-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; being especially critical of [[communist revolution]]. He described the [[October Revolution|Soviet experiment]] as a "caricature" of the Jacobin age&lt;ref name="rg415-416"/&gt; and communist leader [[Joseph Stalin]] as a dangerous usurper.&lt;ref&gt;Stanomir, ''Spiritul'', p. 234. See also Țurlea, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Iorga found the small [[Romanian Communist Party]] an amusement and, even though he expressed alarm for its terrorist tendencies and its "foreign" nature, disliked the state's use of brutal methods against its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Radu Filipescu, [http://istorie.uab.ro/publicatii/colectia_auash/annales_10/studii/5%20radu_filipescu.pdf "Partidele parlamentare și problema comunismului (1919-1924)"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818172913/http://istorie.uab.ro/publicatii/colectia_auash/annales_10/studii/5%20radu_filipescu.pdf |date=2011-08-18 }}, in the [[1 Decembrie 1918 University, Alba Iulia|1 December University of Alba Iulia]] ''Annales Universitatis Apulensis, Series Historica'', 10/I, 2006, pp. 69, 71, 75–77, 81.

===Antisemitism===
[[File:Ion Theodorescu-Sion - Păcăleală de 1 Aprilie, Furnica, 1 apr 1910.JPG|thumb|300px|''April's Fool. On April 1, the Israelite community of [[Buhuși]] has entrusted Mr. Iorga with the office of [[Hakham]] in that locality.'' (1910 cartoon by [[Ion Theodorescu-Sion]])]]

A major and controversial component of Iorga's political vision, present throughout most of his career, was his [[antisemitism]]. Cultural historian [[William O. Oldson]] notes that Iorga's "amazing list of accomplishments" in other fields helped give antisemitism "an irresistible panache" in Romania, particularly since Iorga shared in the belief that all good nationalists were antisemites.&lt;ref&gt;Oldson, pp. 132–134. See also Volovici, pp. 34, 186, 190&lt;/ref&gt; His ideas on the "[[Jewish Question]]" were frequently supported by violent language, which left traces on his journalist activity (even though, Oldson notes, he did not resort to racial slurs).&lt;ref name="wo134"&gt;Oldson, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; In 1901, when he blocked Jewish linguist [[Lazăr Șăineanu]] from obtaining an academic position, Iorga wrote that Jews had a "passion for high praise and multiple earnings";&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Laszlo Alexandru]], "Un savant călcat în picioare (II)", in ''[[Tribuna (Romania)|Tribuna]]'', Nr. 152, January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; three years later, in ''[[Sămănătorul]]'', he argued that Iași was polluted by the "dirty business" of a "heathen and hostile" community.&lt;ref name="omintelect"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Volovici, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Similar accusations were stated, in his travel accounts, where he even justified [[pogrom]]s against [[Bukovina Jews|Bukovinan]] and [[Bessarabian Jews]].&lt;ref name="omintelect"/&gt;

The PND, coming from the same ideological family as [[Second Republic of Poland|Poland]]'s [[Roman Dmowski]] and the [[National Democracy]] movement,&lt;ref name="fv69"&gt;Veiga, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; proclaimed that local Jews were suffocating the Romanian [[middle class]] and needed to be expelled, using slogans such as ''Evreii la Palestina'' ("The Jews to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]").&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), p. 395–396&lt;/ref&gt; The program was criticized from early on by [[Constantin Rădulescu-Motru]], Iorga's fellow nationalist and post-''Junimist'', who noted that the economic rationale behind it was unsound.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Marta Petreu]], [http://www.phantasma.ro/caiete/caiete/caiete13/21.html "De la lupta de rasă la lupta de clasă.

Iorga's personal conservative outlook, passed into the party doctrines, also implied a claim that the Jews were agents of rebellion against political and cultural authority.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p. 32; Oldson, p. 135; Sandqvist, pp. 63, 77, 281&lt;/ref&gt; He had nevertheless opted for [[Religious antisemitism|religious-cultural]] over [[racial antisemitism]], believing that, at the core of civilization, there was a conflict between [[Christian values]] and [[Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; He also suggested that Romanian antisemitism was conjectural and defensive, [[Racial segregation|segregationist]] rather than destructive, and repeatedly argued that xenophobia was not in the national character—ideas paraphrased by Oldson as a "humane antisemitism".&lt;ref&gt;Oldson, pp. 135–137&lt;/ref&gt; Oldson also refers to a paradox in the attitude of Iorga (and [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]] before him): "A self-consciously proclaimed esteem for a minuscule [Jewish] elite, then, went hand in hand with the utmost contempt and condescension for the bulk of Romanian Jewry."&lt;ref&gt;Oldson, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing the impact of such ideas, literary critic [[William Totok]] referred to ''[[Neamul Românesc]]'' as "the most important platform of antisemitic agitation prior to World War I."&lt;ref name="wt618"/&gt; Habitually, the magazine attacked the Jewish-owned papers ''[[Adevărul]]'' and ''[[Dimineața]]'', while claiming to document the "[[Judaization]]" of Romania's intellectual environments.&lt;ref&gt;Voicu, pp. 146–147, 148&lt;/ref&gt; It also specifically targeted Romanians who were friendly with Jews, one such case being that of writer [[Ion Luca Caragiale]] (attacked for his contacts with Șăineanu, dramatist [[Ronetti Roman]] and other Jews).&lt;ref&gt;Voicu, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bcexil"&gt;[[Barbu Cioculescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/n_exil "În exil"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 4/2002&lt;/ref&gt; Caragiale replied with noted irony, calling Iorga "tall but crooked".&lt;ref name="pccarti"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bcexil"/&gt;

Nicolae Iorga and A. C. Cuza's modern revival of antisemitism, together with the core themes of ''Sămănătorul'' propaganda, were paradoxical sources of inspiration for the [[Iron Guard]] in its early years.&lt;ref name="omintelect"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boia (2000), p. 100; Butaru, pp. 97, 126–127; Oldson, pp. 134–135, 161; Ornea (1995), pp. 315, 351, 410, 441, 444; Stanomir, ''Spiritul'', pp. 225; Veiga, pp. 55, 120, 165–167, 175–177, 181, 293; Volovici, pp. 59, 60, 63, 65, 129, 133, 154, 174. See also Călinescu, pp. 948–949&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the [[interwar period]] came a relaxation of Iorga's own antisemitic discourse, when he described Jews as potentially loyal to "the legitimate masters of the land".&lt;ref&gt;Volovici, pp. 34–35&lt;/ref&gt; He recorded being touched by his warm reception among the [[Romanian American]] Jewish community in 1930,&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), p. 396; Volovici, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; and, after 1934, published his work with the ''Adevărul'' group.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 977&lt;/ref&gt; As Cuza himself began censuring this more tolerant discourse, Iorga even voiced his admiration for the Jewish mecena [[Aristide Blank]].&lt;ref&gt;Butaru, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by researcher [[George Voicu]], the anti-"Judaization" discourse of the far right was by then turning against Iorga.&lt;ref&gt;Voicu, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; Later in life, Iorga made the occasional return to antisemitic rhetoric: in 1937–1938, he alleged that Jews were pressuring Romanians into leaving the country, and described the necessity of "delousing" Romania by colonizing Romanian Jews elsewhere.&lt;ref name="omintelect"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Volovici, pp. 54–55, 152–155&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geopolitics===
[[File:PequeñaEntente.svg|thumb|280px|[[Greater Romania]] and the [[Little Entente]] (in light green), with their nominal enemy, [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Regency Hungary]]]]

Iorga's changing sentiment flowed between the extremes of [[Francophilia]] and [[Francophobia]]. The Romanian scholar explained in detail his dislike for the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]]'s social and political landscape. He recalled that, in the 1890s, he had been shocked by the irreverence and [[cosmopolitanism]] of French student society.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 179–180, 195–196, 201–202; Stanomir, ''Spiritul'', pp. 115–118&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1906 speech, Iorga also noted that [[Francophone]] elites and urban [[diglossia]] were slowly destroying the country's social fiber, by creating a language gap between classes.&lt;ref&gt;Boia (2000), pp. 93, 247; Stanomir, ''Spiritul'', pp. 114–118&lt;/ref&gt; Also, ''Neamul Românesc'' showed a preference for ''[[Action Française]]'' and the [[History of far-right movements in France|French reactionary right]] in their conflict with the Third Republic.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugen Weber]], ''Action Française: Royalism and Reaction in Twentieth Century France'', [[Stanford University Press]], Stanford, 1962, pp. 483–484.  {{OCLC|401078}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the beginning of World War I, during the [[Battle of the Frontiers]], Iorga publicized his renewed love for France, claiming that she was the only belligerent engaged in a purely [[defensive war]]; in the name of [[Pan-Latinism]], he later chided Spain for [[Spain in World War I|keeping neutral]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia (2000), p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;

Iorga's coverage of European culture and continental affairs also opened bridges with other cultural areas, particularly so during the interwar. By that time, historian [[Lucian Boia]] notes, he was seeing Europe as a community of nations, and, "in his own way", was rejecting isolationism or "primitive" xenophobia.&lt;ref&gt;Boia (2000), p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; According to academic Francesco Guida, Iorga's political and scholarly activities displayed a "great openness towards the outside world", even as, in 1930s France, public opinion was turning against him.&lt;ref&gt;Guida, pp. 237–238&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Iorga affirmed himself as a promoter of [[English culture]], making noted efforts at promoting awareness of its defining traits among the Romanian public.&lt;ref name="albuyeats"&gt;Rodica Albu, "The Reception of W. B. Yeats in Romania", in K. P. S. Jochum (ed.), ''The Reception of W.B. Yeats in Europe'', [[Continuum International Publishing Group]], London &amp; New York, 2006, pp. 177–178, 186, 306, 307. {{ISBN|0-8264-5963-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tccpoe"&gt;Thomas C. Carlson, "Poe in Romania", in Lois Vines (ed.), ''Poe Abroad. Influence, Reputation, Affinities'', [[University of Iowa Press]], Iowa City, 1999, p. 80. {{ISBN|0-87745-697-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, although flirting with [[Pan-European nationalism]], he stood in contrast with the Transylvanian-born [[Iuliu Maniu]] for displaying no sympathy toward [[Danubian Confederation]] projects, believing them to conceal [[Hungary]]'s [[revanchism]].&lt;ref name="fg238"/&gt;

Disenchanted with [[German culture]] after the shock of World War I,&lt;ref&gt;Boia (2000), pp. 247–248; Grigorescu, pp. 376–377; Nastasă (2007), pp. 215–216; Oldson, pp. 134–135&lt;/ref&gt; Iorga also had strong views on [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Nazism]] in general, taking in view their contempt for the [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles system]], but also their repressive politics. He summarized this in ''Sfaturi pe întuneric'': "Beware my people for great dangers are stalking you&amp;nbsp;... Borders are attacked, gutted, destroyed, gulped up.&amp;nbsp;... There reemerges, in its cruelest form, the old theory that small states have no right to independence, that they fall within [[Lebensraum|living spaces]]&amp;nbsp;... I cannot forget the past and I cannot reach an agreement with Hitler's dictatorship, being a man who cherishes freedom of thought".&lt;ref name="ivlii"/&gt; He later called Germany's [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|Bohemia Protectorate]] a "[[Behemoth]]", referring to its annexation as a "prehistoric" act.&lt;ref name="azsistemul"/&gt;

His anti-war texts of 1939 replied to claims that a new armed conflict would usher in national "vitality", and, during the [[Invasion of Poland|September Campaign]], expressed solidarity with Poland—Iorga's Polonophila was even noted by the Nazis, causing more frictions between Berlin and Bucharest.&lt;ref name="nmpolonia"/&gt; The conservative Iorga was however inclined to sympathize with other forms of [[totalitarianism]] or [[corporatism]], and, since the 1920s, viewed [[Italian Fascism]] with some respect.&lt;ref&gt;Boia (2000), p. 116; Santoro, pp. 115–116, 226–228, 231, 233, 333, 359-364; Stanomir, ''Spiritul'', pp. 228, 233; Veiga, pp. 89, 97, 130–131, 134, 149, 253&lt;/ref&gt; Italian agents of influence hesitated between Iorga and the Iron Guard, but the [[Fascist International]] sought to include Iorga among its Romanian patrons;&lt;ref&gt;Santoro, pp. 231, 333; Veiga, p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; Iorga himself expressed regret that the Italian regime was primarily an ally of revanchist Hungary, but applauded the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|1935 invasion of Ethiopia]], and, to the alarm of France, repeatedly argued that an Italian alliance was more secure than the [[Little Entente]].&lt;ref&gt;Santoro, pp. 115, 226–227, 233, 359–360, 363–364&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicolae Iorga's bitterness about Romanian geopolitical disadvantages was encoded in his oft-quoted remark about the country only having two peaceful borders: one with [[Serbia]], the other with the [[Black Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Adam Puslojić]], Ștefania Coșovei, [http://www.revistaluceafarul.ro/index.html?id=1363&amp;editie=64 "Prietenia este un vis comun"], in ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]'', Nr. 24-25/2009&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these views, he endorsed the idea of [[minority rights]] in Greater Romania, attempting to find common ground with the [[Hungarians in Romania|Hungarian-Romanian community]].&lt;ref&gt;Neubauer, p. 165; Neubauer ''et al.'', pp. 272–273. See also Nastasă (2007), p. 454; Stanomir, ''Spiritul'', p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to promoting inclusive action in government, Iorga declared himself against turning Hungarians and [[Transylvanian Saxons]] into "pharisaic" Romanians by coercing them to adopt the Romanian tradition.&lt;ref name="jn165"/&gt; In 1936, he even spoke in favor of [[Armenians in Hungary|Armenian Hungarian]] archeologist [[Márton Roska]], prosecuted in Romania for challenging official theses about Transylvania, arguing that Transylvania "cannot be defended with prison sentences".&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2003), p. 315; (2007), p. 457&lt;/ref&gt; Iorga was also noted for fostering the academic career of [[Eufrosina Dvoichenko-Markov]], one of the few [[Russians of Romania|Russian-Romanian]] researchers of the interwar period.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 459–460. On Dvoichenko's work, see Călinescu, pp. 983, 991, 997; Vianu, Vol. I, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; He was however skeptical about the [[History of Ukrainian nationality|Ukrainian identity]] and rejected the idea of an independent [[Ukraine]] on Romania's border, debating the issues with ethnographer [[Zamfir Arbore]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, 2010, pp. 144–145&lt;/ref&gt;

Various of Iorga's tracts speak in favor of a common background uniting the diverse nations of the [[Balkans]]. [[Bulgaria]]n historian [[Maria Todorova]] suggests that, unlike many of his predecessors, Iorga was not alarmed Romania being perceived as a Balkan country, and did not attach a negative connotation to this affiliation (even though, she notes, Iorga explicitly placed the northern limit of the Balkans on the [[Danube]], just south of Wallachia).&lt;ref name="mt46"&gt;Todorova, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s, the Romanian scholar spoke with respect about all the Balkan peoples, but claimed that Balkan statehood was "Oriental" and underdeveloped.&lt;ref name="kkzodie"/&gt;

==Scientific work==

===Iorga's reputation for genius===
[[File:Stenografia lui N. Iorga.jpg|thumb|280px|Iorga's [[shorthand]] method: a fragment from his private notes]]

Iorga the European scholar has drawn comparisons with figures such as [[Voltaire]],&lt;ref name="agrevenind4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gc612"&gt;Călinescu, p. 612&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jules Michelet]],&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. III, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leopold von Ranke]]&lt;ref name="hsw&amp;csw9"&gt;H. Seton-Watson &amp; C. Seton-Watson, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Claudio Sánchez-Albornoz]].&lt;ref name="fv69"/&gt; Having achieved fluency in some 12 foreign languages,&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; he was an exceptionally prolific author: according to his biographer Barbu Theodorescu, the total of his published contributions, both volumes and brochures, was 1,359.&lt;ref&gt;Iova, p. xxxiv. According to Veiga (p. 69): "1,300 volumes and 25,000 articles"&lt;/ref&gt; His work in documenting Romania's historical past could reach an unprecedented intensity, one such exceptional moment being a 1903 study trip to [[Târgu Jiu]], a three-day interval during which he copied and summarized 320 individual documents, covering the period 1501–1833.&lt;ref name="ivxxxviii"/&gt; His mentor and rival Xenopol was among the first voices to discuss his genius, his 1911 Academy speech in honor of Nicolae Iorga making special note of his "absolutely extraordinary memory" and his creative energy, and concluding: "one asks himself in wonder how a brain was able to conceive of so many things and a hand was able to record them".&lt;ref name="ivxl-xli"/&gt; In 1940, Rădulescu-Motru likewise argued that Iorga had been "a creator&amp;nbsp;... of unparalleled fecundity",&lt;ref&gt;Iova, p. lvi&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[Enciclopedia Cugetarea]]'' deemed him the greatest-ever mind in Romania.&lt;ref name="agrevenind4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oldson, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; According to literary historian [[George Călinescu]], Iorga's "huge" and "monstrously" comprehensive research, leaving no other historian "the joy of adding something", was matched by the everyday persona, a "hero of the ages".&lt;ref name="gc612"/&gt;

The level of Iorga's productivity and the quality of his historical writing were also highlighted by more modern researchers. Literary historian [[Ovid Crohmălniceanu]] opined that Iorga's scientific work was one of the "illustrious accomplishments" of the interwar years, on par with [[Constantin Brâncuși]]'s sculptures and [[George Enescu]]'s music.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Romanian historian of culture [[Alexandru Zub]] finds that Iorga's is "surely the richest opus coming from the 20th century",&lt;ref&gt;Zub (2000), p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; while Maria Todorova calls Iorga "Romania's greatest historian", adding "at least in terms of the size of his opus and his influence both at home and abroad".&lt;ref name="mt46"/&gt; According to philosopher Liviu Bordaș, Iorga's main topic of interest, the relation between Romania and the [[Eastern world]], was exhaustively covered: "nothing escaped this sacred monster's attention: Iorga had read everything."&lt;ref name="lbintoarcer"&gt;{{ro icon}} Liviu Bordaș, [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/sectiune/polul-plus/articol/intoarcerea-radacinilor "Întoarcerea rădăcinilor"], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Nr. 360, January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Method and biases===
The definition of history followed by Iorga was specified in his 1894 ''Despre concepția actuală a istoriei și geneza ei'': "History is the systematic exposition, free from all unrelated purpose, of facts irrespective of their nature, methodically acquired, through which human activity manifested itself, irrespective of place and time."&lt;ref name="ivxxxiv"/&gt; With [[Ioan Bogdan]] and [[Dimitrie Onciul]], young Iorga was considered an exponent of the "new" or "[[Critical historiography|critical]]" school, with which ''Junimism'' tackled [[Romantic nationalism]] in the name of objectivity.&lt;ref&gt;Boia (2000), pp. 82–83, 101; Nastasă (2003), pp. 63, 72–73, 167–184; (2007), p. 44, 306–307, 436, 502, 515–521&lt;/ref&gt; However, even at that stage, Iorga's ideas accommodated a belief that history needed to be written with a "poetic talent" that would make one "relive" the past.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. III, pp. 67–68&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1902, he had changed his approach in [[historiography]] to include and illustrate his belief in emotional attachment as a positive value of cultural nationalism. He would speak of historians as "elders of [their] nation",&lt;ref&gt;Boia (2010), p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; and dismissed [[academic specialization]] as a "blindfold".&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. III, p. 53. See also Zub (2000), pp. 33–34&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting back on the transition, Iorga himself stated: "The love for the past, for great figures of energy and sincerity,&amp;nbsp;... the exact contrary of tendencies I had found existed among my contemporaries, had gripped me and, added to my political preoccupations, such awakenings served me, when it came to criticizing things present, more than any argument that is abstract, logical in nature."&lt;ref name="ivxxxviii"/&gt; The point of his research, Iorga explained in 1922, was to show "the nation itself as a living being".&lt;ref&gt;Boia (2000), p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; According to literary historian Victor Iova: "[Iorga's] overall activity&amp;nbsp;... did not just seek the communication of knowledge, but also expressly sought to define the social finality of his time, its ethical sense and his own [[Patriotism|patriotic]] ideal."&lt;ref name="ivli"/&gt; The 1911 speech ''Două concepții istorice'' nevertheless provided a more nuanced outline, cautioning against a potential cult of heroes and suggesting that national histories were inextricably linked to each other: "The life of a people is at all times mingled with the lives of others, existing in relation with these and at all times feeding into the others' lives."&lt;ref name="ivxl"/&gt;

According to George Călinescu, Nicolae Iorga was overdependent on his memory, which could result in "utterly fictitious" [[critical apparatus]]es for his scientific works.&lt;ref name="gc612"/&gt; Călinescu suggests that Iorga was an "anachronistic" type in his context: "approved only by failures", aged before his time, modeling himself on ancient chroniclers and out of place in modern historiography.&lt;ref name="gc612"/&gt; In the 1930s, Iorga's status in regulating the official historical narrative was challenged by [[Constantin C. Giurescu]], [[P. P. Panaitescu]] and [[Gheorghe Brătianu]], who wanted to return academic discourse back to the basic ''Junimist'' caveats, and were seen by Iorga as "denialists".&lt;ref name="lb(00)101-106"/&gt; For all the controversy, Lucian Boia suggests, neither of the ''[[Revista Istorică Română]]'' publishers was completely beyond Iorga's subjectivity, pathos or political bias, even though Panaitescu was for long "closer" to the ''Junimist'' model.&lt;ref&gt;Boia (2000), p. 103–107&lt;/ref&gt; A particular challenge to Iorga's historical narrative also came from rival Hungarian historiography: in 1929, [[Benedek Jancsó]] called Iorga's science a branch of "Romanian [[Imperialism|imperialist]] nationalism", his argument rejected as "false logic" by the Romanian.&lt;ref&gt;Santoro, p. 358&lt;/ref&gt; Iorga had a friendly attitude toward other Hungarian scholars, including [[Árpád Bitay]] and [[Imre Kádár]], who were his guests at Vălenii.&lt;ref name="jn165"/&gt;

Several other historians have expressed criticism of Iorga's bias and agenda. [[Robert William Seton-Watson|R.&amp;nbsp;W. Seton-Watson]] regarded him as "prolific" and "''[[Wiktionary:bahnbrechend|bahnbrechend]]''", but mentioned his "slovenly style".&lt;ref name="hsw&amp;csw9"/&gt; In 1945, [[Hugh Seton-Watson]] spoke of the "great Roumanian Professor" having contributed "erudite chronology, written in a highly romantic and bombastic spirit."&lt;ref&gt;Seton-Watson, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; In his own ''Mehmed the Conqueror and His Time'', Iorga's German colleague [[Franz Babinger]] also noted that Iorga could get "carried away by national pride".&lt;ref&gt;In reference to Iorga's challenged claim that [[Orban]], the [[supergun]] technician, was Romanian. See [[Franz Babinger]], ''Mehmed the Conqueror and His Time. Bollingen Series XCVI'', [[Princeton University Press]], Princeton, 1978, p. 82. {{ISBN|0-691-09900-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medievalist [[Kenneth Setton]] also described Iorga as "the great Rumanian historian&amp;nbsp;... who was sometimes intoxicated by the grandeur of his own historical concepts, but whose work is always illuminating."&lt;ref&gt;Setton, p. 49. Setton also notes (p. 36) "some hasty summaries" in Iorga's commentary on the margin of documents, "but on the whole one can admire both his industry and his accuracy."&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Japan]]ese sociologist Kosaku Yoshino sees Iorga as a main contributor to didactic and dramatized cultural nationalism in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;Kosaku Yoshino, ''Cultural Nationalism in Contemporary Japan: A Sociological Enquiry'', [[Routledge]], London, 2000, pp. 45–46. {{ISBN|0-415-12084-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Trento]] academic Paul Blokker suggests that, although "politicized, [[Essentialism|essentialist]] and sometimes anachronistic", Iorga's writings can be critically recovered.&lt;ref name="pb164"&gt;Blokker, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; Ioana Both notes: "A creator with titan-like forces, Iorga is more a visionary of history than a historian".&lt;ref&gt;Both, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Bordaș criticizes Iorga's habit of recording "everything" into his studies, and without arranging the facts described into an "[[Epistemology|epistemological]] relationship".&lt;ref name="lbintoarcer"/&gt;

Despite Iorga's ambition of fusing research and [[pedagogy]], his students, both rivals and friends, often noted that he was inferior to other colleagues when it came to teaching, in particular in directing advanced classes—reportedly, his popularity dropped with time, the aging Iorga having displayed aggression toward inquisitive students.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 479–482, 532&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923, even an old friend like [[Sextil Pușcariu]] could accuse Iorga of behaving like a "dictator".&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2003), p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; In compensation, the historian fulfilled this function with his activity in the media and in the field of [[popular history]], at which he was, according to historian Lucian Nastasă, masterful but vulgarizing.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 513–516, 526&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iorga and Romanian ethnogenesis===
[[File:004 - Basarab I.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Radu I of Wallachia]]'s remains, as uncovered in 1920 (thought by Iorga to belong to [[Basarab I]])]]

Iorga's ideas on the [[origin of the Romanians]], and his explanation for the more mysterious parts of that lengthy [[ethnogenesis]] process, were shaped by his both his scientific and ideological preoccupations. Some of Iorga's studies focused specifically on the original events in the process: ancient [[Dacia]]'s conquest by the [[Roman Empire]] ([[Trajan's Dacian Wars]]), and the subsequent foundation of [[Roman Dacia]]. His account is decidedly in support of Romania's [[Italic peoples|Roman (Latin)]] roots, and even suggests that [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanization]] preceded the actual conquest.&lt;ref&gt;Boia (2000), pp. 143, 181. See also Santoro, pp. 115–116&lt;/ref&gt; However, he viewed the autochthonous element in this [[acculturation]], the [[Dacians]] (collocated by him with the [[Getae]]),&lt;ref&gt;Boia (2000), p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; as historically significant, and he even considered them the source for Romania's later links with the Balkan "[[Thracians|Thracian]]" space.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 949; Neubauer, p. 165; Neubauer ''et al.'', p. 250&lt;/ref&gt; Through the Thracians and the [[Illyrians]], Iorga believed to have found a common root for all Balkan peoples, and an ethnic layer which he believed was still observable after later conquests.&lt;ref&gt;Neubauer, p. 165; Todorova, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; He was nevertheless explicit in distancing himself from the speculative texts of Dacianist [[Nicolae Densușianu]], where Dacia was described as the source of all [[Western culture|European civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Zoe Petre]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/index.html/articles|details?articleID=1496 "Burebista, contemporanul nostru"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 79, August 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Iorga had a complex personal perspective on the little-documented [[Romania in the Early Middle Ages|Dark Age history]], between the Roman departure (271 AD) and the 14th century emergence of two [[Danubian Principalities]]: [[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]]. Despite the separate histories and conflicting allegiances these regions had during the [[Romania in the Middle Ages|High Middle Ages]], he tended to group the two Principalities and [[History of Transylvania|medieval Transylvania]] together, into a vague non-stately entity he named "the Romanian Land".&lt;ref&gt;Boia (2000), pp. 180–181&lt;/ref&gt; Iorga cautioned about the emergence of states from a [[stateless society]] such as the proto-Romanian one: "The state is a late, very elevated, very delicate form that, under certain conditions, may be reached by a people.&amp;nbsp;... There was therefore no state, but a Romanian mass living in the midst of forests, in those villages harbored by protective forests, where it is just as true that a certain way of life could emerge, sometimes on a rather elevated level."&lt;ref&gt;Pecican, pp. 110–111&lt;/ref&gt;

Echoing his political conservatism, Iorga's theory proposed that the Romanized Dacians, or all their [[Vlach|Vlach-Romanian]] successors, had created peasant republics to defend themselves against the [[Age of Migrations|invading nomads]]. It spoke of the rapid ruralization of Latin urban dwellers—suggested to him by [[Etymology|etymologies]] such as the derivation of ''pământ'' ("soil") from ''[[pavimentum]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Pecican, pp. 84–85&lt;/ref&gt; and the creation of "genealogical villages" around common ancestors (''moși'')&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; or the ancient communal sharing of village lands, in the manner imagined by writer [[Nicolae Bălcescu]].&lt;ref name="ideol&amp;cult"/&gt; Iorga also supposed that, during the 12th century, there was an additional symbiosis between settled Vlachs and their conquerors, the nomadic [[Cumans]].&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Ș. Năsturel, "À propos du Tenou Orman (Teleorman) de Kinnamos", in [[Hélène Ahrweiler]] (ed.), ''Byzantina Sorbonensia 3. Geographica Byzantina'', [[University of Paris 1 Pantheon-Sorbonne]], Paris, 1981, pp. 87–88. {{ISBN|2-85944-041-0}}; Tanașoca, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

Iorga's peasant polities, sometimes described by him as ''Romanii populare'' ("people's Romanias", "people's Roman-like polities"),&lt;ref name="mmhomob"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gan214"&gt;Gheorghe-Alexandru Niculescu, "Nationalism and the Representation of Society in Romanian Archaeology", in ''Nation and National Ideology'', p. 214&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boia (2000), pp. 99, 188; Neubauer, pp. 164–165; Tanașoca, pp. 100, 102. See also {{ro icon}} Alexandru Niculescu, [http://www.romlit.ro/multiculturalism_alteritate_istoricitate "Multiculturalism, alteritate, istoricitate"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 32/2002&lt;/ref&gt; were seen by him as the sources of a supposed [[uncodified constitution]] in both Moldavia and Wallachia. That constitutional system, he argued, created solidarity: the countries' ''[[hospodar]]'' rulers were themselves peasants, elected to high military office by their peers, and protecting the entire community.&lt;ref&gt;Boia (2000), pp. 93, 99; Neubauer, p. 165; Sandqvist, p. 252; Stanomir, ''Spiritul'', pp. 112–114, 115, 119–121, 224–225, 228–231; Veiga, pp. 165–166. See also Călinescu, p. 949&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[Ioan Bogdan]] and others, Iorga strongly rejected any notion that the [[South Slavs]] had been an additional contributor to ethnogenesis, and argued that [[South Slavic languages|Slavic idioms]] were a sustained but nonessential influence in [[History of the Romanian language|historical Romanian]].&lt;ref name="zoistlit"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boia (2000), pp. 164–166, 181&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1919, he was cautious about counting the Romanians and [[Aromanians]] as one large ethnic group, but later came to share the inclusivist views of his Romanian colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Tanașoca, pp. 99–100&lt;/ref&gt; Iorga also stood out among his generation for flatly rejecting any notion that the 12th-century [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] was a "Vlach-Bulgarian" or "Romanian-Bulgarian" project, noting that the Vlach achievements there benefited "''another nation''" (Iorga's italics).&lt;ref&gt;Boia (2000), p. 181. See also Tanașoca, pp. 130, 132&lt;/ref&gt;

The stately [[foundation of Moldavia]] and [[Foundation of Wallachia|of Wallachia]], Iorga thought, were linked to the emergence of major [[trade route]]s in the 14th century, and not to the political initiative of military elites.&lt;ref&gt;Pecican, pp. 38, 49, 277–279&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Iorga looked into the genesis of [[boyar]]dom, describing the selective progression of free peasants into a local aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 135–136&lt;/ref&gt; He described the later violent clash between ''hospodars'' and boyars as one between [[national interest]] and disruptive centrifugal tendencies, suggesting that prosperous boyardom had undermined the balance of the peasant state.&lt;ref&gt;Boia (2000), pp. 292–293&lt;/ref&gt; His theory about the peasant nature of Romanian statehood was hotly debated in his lifetime, particularly after a 1920 discovery showed that [[Radu I of Wallachia]] had been buried in the full regalia of medieval lords.&lt;ref&gt;Boia (2000), p. 99-100&lt;/ref&gt; Another one of his influential (but disputed) claims attributed the appearance of [[Slavery in Romania|pre-modern slavery]], mainly affecting the [[Roma minority in Romania|Romani (Gypsy) minority]], exclusively on alien customs borrowed from the [[Mongol Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Viorel Achim]], ''The Roma in Romanian History'', [[Central European University Press]], Budapest, 2004, pp. 15, 27–28. {{ISBN|963-9241-84-9}}; Elena Marushiakova, Vesselin Popov, "Gypsy Slavery in Wallachia and Moldavia", in [[Tomasz Kamusella]], Krzysztof Jaskułowski (eds.), ''Nationalisms across the Globe. Vol. 1: Nationalisms Today'', [[Peter Lang (publishing company)|Peter Lang AG]], Bern, 2009, p. 90. {{ISBN|978-3-03911-883-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iorga's verdicts as a medievalist also produced a long-standing controversy about the real location of the 1330 [[Battle of Posada]]—so-named by him after an obscure reference in the ''[[Chronicon Pictum]]''—whereby the [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Wallachian Princes]] secured their throne.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.phantasma.ro/dezbateri/masa/masa3.html ''Locurile memoriei''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727134725/http://www.phantasma.ro/dezbateri/masa/masa3.html |date=2011-07-27 }}, round table of the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]]'s [http://phantasma.ro/ Center for Imagination Studies] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429090728/http://www.phantasma.ro/ |date=2009-04-29 }}; retrieved April 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

A major point of contention between Panaitescu and Iorga referred to [[Michael the Brave]]'s historical achievements: sacrilegious in the eyes of Iorga, Panaitescu placed in doubt Michael's claim to princely descent, and described him as mainly the political agent of boyar interests.&lt;ref&gt;Boia (2000), pp. 102–103&lt;/ref&gt; Contradicting the Romantic nationalist tradition, Iorga also agreed with younger historians that, for most of their history, Romanians in Moldavia, Wallachia and Transylvania were more justifiably attached to their polities than to [[National awakening of Romania|national awakening]] ideals.&lt;ref name="lb(00)202-203"&gt;Boia (2000), pp. 202–203&lt;/ref&gt; Panaitescu was however more categorical than Iorga in affirming that Michael the Brave's expeditions were motivated by political opportunism rather than by a pan-Romanian national awareness.&lt;ref name="lb(00)202-203"/&gt;

===Byzantine and Ottoman studies===
Two of Iorga's major fields of expertise were [[Byzantine studies]] and [[Turkology]]. A significant portion of his contributions in the field detailed the impact of Byzantine influences on the Danubian Principalities and the Balkans at large. He described the "Byzantine man" as embodying the blend of several cultural universes: [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]], [[Levant]]ine and [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]].&lt;ref name="mmhomob"/&gt; In this context, Iorga was also exploring Romania's own identity issues as a confluence of Byzantine [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] and a [[Western Roman Empire|Western Roman]] linguistic imprint.&lt;ref&gt;Blokker, ''passim''; Santoro, pp. 115–116; Spiridon, pp. 94–95, 104&lt;/ref&gt;

Iorga's writings insisted on the importance of [[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantine Greek]] and Levantine influences in the two countries after the [[fall of Constantinople]]: his notion of "Byzantium after Byzantium" postulated that the cultural forms produced by the Byzantine Empire had been preserved by the Principalities under Ottoman [[suzerainty]] (roughly, between the 16th and 18th centuries).&lt;ref&gt;Blokker, pp. 166–170; Boia (2000), pp. 100, 181, 267; Djuvara, p. 339; Neubauer, p. 164; Spiridon, p. 104. Also cited in specific reference to [[Byzantine art]]: Clemena Antonova, ''Space, Time, and Presence in the Icon: Seeing the World with the Eyes of God'', [[Ashgate Publishing]], Farnham &amp; Burlington, 2010, p. 167. {{ISBN|978-0-7546-6798-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Romanian scholar described the Ottoman Empire itself as the inheritor of Byzantine government, [[Byzantine law|legal culture]] and civilization, up to the [[Age of Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Todorova, p. 165; Setton, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ''Geschichte des Osmanischen Reiches'' postulated that the [[Decline of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman decline]] was irreversible, citing uncompromising [[Islam]] as one of the causes,&lt;ref&gt;Suraiya Faroqhi, Fikret Adanır, "Introduction", in ''The Ottomans and the Balkans: A Discussion of Historiography'', [[Brill Publishers]], Leiden etc., 2002, p. 43. {{ISBN|90-04-11902-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and playing down the cohesive action of [[Ottomanism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Șerif Mardin]], ''The Genesis of Young Ottoman Thought: A Study in the Modernization of Turkish Political Ideas'', [[Syracuse University Press]], Syracuse, 2000, p. 11. {{ISBN|0-8156-2861-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The post-Byzantine thesis was taken by various commentators as further proof that the Romanian historian, unlike many of his contemporaries, accepted a level of [[multiculturalism]] or acculturation in defining modern Romanian identity. [[Semiotics|Semiotician]] [[Monica Spiridon]] writes: "Iorga highly valued the idea of cultural confluence and hybridity."&lt;ref&gt;Spiridon, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Maria Todorova]] notes that, although it minimized the Ottoman contribution and displayed "emotional or evaluative overtones", such a perspective ran against the divisive interpretations of the Balkans, offering a working paradigm for a global history of the region: "Although Iorga's theory may be today [ca. 2009] no more than an exotic episode in the development of Balkan historiography, his formulation ''Byzance après Byzance'' is alive not only because it was a fortunate phrase but because it reflects more than its creator would intimate. It is a good descriptive term, particularly for representing the commonalities of the Orthodox peoples in the Ottoman Empire&amp;nbsp;... but also in emphasizing the continuity of two imperial traditions".&lt;ref&gt;Todorova, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; With his research, Iorga also rehabilitated the [[Phanariotes]], [[Greeks of Romania|Greek]] or [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] aristocrats who controlled Wallachia and Moldavia in Ottoman times, and whom Romanian historiography before him presented as wreckers of the country.&lt;ref&gt;Boia (2000), pp. 100, 238; Djuvara, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural critic==

===Beginnings===
Iorga's tolerance for the national bias in historiography and his own political profile were complemented in the field of literature and the arts by his strong belief in didacticism. Art's mission was, in his view, to educate and empower the Romanian peasant.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 601–602, 949, 968; Crohmălniceanu, pp. 32–33; Livezeanu, p. 116-117; Sandqvist, pp. 60–61, 251–252; Veiga, pp. 166–167&lt;/ref&gt; The rejection of [[art for art's sake]], whose indifference in front of nationality issues enraged the historian, was notably illustrated by his 1902 letter to the like-minded ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]'' editors, which stated: "You gentlemen should not allow aesthetic preoccupations to play the decisive part, and you are not granted such circumstances as to dedicate yourselves to pure art.&amp;nbsp;... Do not imitate&amp;nbsp;..., do not allow yourselves to be tempted by things you have read elsewhere. Write about things from your country and about the Romanian soul therein."&lt;ref name="ivxxxviii"/&gt; His ambition was to contribute an alternative to ''Junimist'' literary history,&lt;ref name="zomemor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zoistlit"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. I, pp. 43–44; Vol. II, pp. 53, 56–57&lt;/ref&gt; and, according to [[Comparative literature|comparatist]] John Neubauer, for the first time integrate "the various Romanian texts and writers into a grand narrative of an organic and spontaneous growth of native creativity, based on [[Folklore of Romania|local tradition and folklore]]."&lt;ref name="jn164"/&gt; Iorga described painter [[Nicolae Grigorescu]] as the purveyor of national pride,&lt;ref&gt;Drăguț ''et al.'', p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; and was enthusiastic about [[Stoica D.]], the [[war artist]].&lt;ref name="prstoicad"/&gt; He recommended artists to study [[handicraft]]s, even though, an adversary of the [[pastiche]], he strongly objected to [[Neo-Brâncovenesc style|Brâncovenesc revival style]] taken up by his generation.&lt;ref name="apcumlevedea"/&gt; His own monographs on [[Art of Romania|Romanian art]] and folklore, admired in their time by art historian [[Gheorghe Oprescu]],&lt;ref name="goarta860"/&gt; were later rated by ethologist [[Romulus Vulcănescu]] a sample of [[microhistory]], rather than a groundbreaking new research.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Iordan Datcu, [http://www.romlit.ro/profesorul_alexandru_dima "Profesorul Alexandru Dima"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 39/2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, with ''Opinions sincères'', Iorga offered a historian's manifesto against the whole cultural establishment, likened by historian [[Ovidiu Pecican]] with [[Allan Bloom]]'s 1980s critique of [[American culture]].&lt;ref name="opapologia"/&gt; Before 1914, Iorga focused his critical attention on [[Symbolist movement in Romania|Romanian Symbolists]], whom he denounced for their [[Erotic literature|erotic style]] (called "''[[Lupanar (Pompeii)|lupanarium]]'' literature" by Iorga)&lt;ref name="ascboxa"/&gt; and [[aestheticism]]—in one instance, he even scolded ''[[Sămănătorul]]'' contributor [[Dimitrie Anghel]] for his floral-themed Symbolist poems.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1998), p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; His own theses were ridiculed early in the 20th century by Symbolists such as [[Emil Isac]], [[Ovid Densusianu]] or [[Ion Minulescu]],&lt;ref&gt;Sandqvist, pp. 77, 202&lt;/ref&gt; and toned down by ''Sămănătorul'' poet [[Ștefan Octavian Iosif]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 604&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nadia Bulighin - Ragazze in abito popolare (Iorga, Conferenze italiene sulla nazione romena, 1927).png|thumb|220px|Girls in [[Romanian dress]]. [[Nadia Bulighin]]'s illustration to Iorga's conferences "on the Romanian nation" (1927)]]
After his own Marxist beginnings, Iorga was also a critic of [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]]'s socialist and [[Poporanism|Poporanist]] school, and treated its literature with noted disdain.&lt;ref name="ihstere1"/&gt; In reply, Russian Marxist journalist [[Leon Trotsky]] accused him of wishing to bury all left-wing contributions to culture,&lt;ref name="ihstere2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Leon Trotsky]], ''The War Correspondence of Leon Trotsky: The Balkan Wars 1912-13'', Monad Press, New York City, 1980, pp. 408-409. {{ISBN|0-909196-08-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and local socialist [[Henric Sanielevici]] wrote that Iorga's literary doctrine did not live up to its moral goals.&lt;ref name="iscenten"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Henric Sanielevici]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20120320231243/http://www.plural-magazine.com/article_new-critical-studies-1920.html "New Critical Studies, 1920" (excerpts)], in ''Plural Magazine'', Nr. 29/2007&lt;/ref&gt; Iorga wrote with noted warmth about ''[[Contemporanul]]'' and its cultural agenda,&lt;ref name="zomemor"/&gt; but concluded that Poporanists represented merely "the left-wing current of the National Liberal Party".&lt;ref name="zoistlit"/&gt;

===Campaigns against modernism===
Iorga's direct influence as a critic had largely faded by the 1920s, owing in part to his decision of concentrating his energy elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he was still often involved at the forefront of cultural campaigns against the various manifestations of [[modernism]], initiating polemics with all the circles representing Romania's new literary and artistic trends: the moderate ''[[Sburătorul]]'' review of literary theorist [[Eugen Lovinescu]]; the eclectic ''[[Contimporanul]]'' magazine; the [[Expressionism|Expressionist]] cell affiliated with the traditionalist magazine ''[[Gândirea]]''; and ultimately the various local branches of [[Dada]] or [[Surrealism]]. In some of his essays, Iorga identified Expressionism with the danger of [[Germanization]], a phenomenon he described as "intolerable" (although, unwittingly, he was also among the first Romanians to tackle Expressionism).&lt;ref&gt;Grigorescu, pp. 376–377&lt;/ref&gt; In an analogy present in a 1922 article for ''[[Gazeta Transilvaniei]]'', Iorga suggested that the same "German" threat was agitating the avant-garde voices of [[Romance-speaking Europe|Latin Europe]], [[Futurism|Futurists]] and Dadaist "[[energumen]]s" alike.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1930s, as the cultural and political climate changed, Iorga's main accusation against [[Tudor Arghezi]], [[Lucian Blaga]], [[Mircea Eliade]], [[Liviu Rebreanu]], [[George Mihail Zamfirescu]] and other Romanian modernists was their supposed practice of literary "[[pornography]]".&lt;ref name="ascboxa"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), pp. 445–446. See also Călinescu, p. 613; Sandqvist, p. 377&lt;/ref&gt;

The ensuing polemics were often bitter, and Iorga's vehemence was met with ridicule by his modernist adversaries. ''Sburătorul'' literary chronicler [[Felix Aderca]] saw in Iorga the driver of "the boorish carts of ''Sămănătorism''",&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; and Blaga called him "the collective name for a multitude of monsters".&lt;ref name="pccarti"/&gt; Iorga's stance on "pornography" only attracted provocation from the younger avant-garde writers. In the early 1930s, the avant-garde youth put out the licentious art magazine ''Alge'' sent him a copy for review; prosecuted on Iorga's orders, they all later became noted as left-wing authors and artists: [[Aurel Baranga]], [[Gherasim Luca]], [[Paul Păun]], [[Jules Perahim]].&lt;ref name="ascboxa"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Michaël Finkenthal]], [http://www.revista-apostrof.ro/articole.php?id=103 "Ce s-a întîmplat cu 'algiștii' în 1933?"], in ''[[Apostrof]]'', Nr. 1/2007; Sandqvist, pp. 376–377&lt;/ref&gt;

A lengthy polemic consumed Iorga's relationship with Lovinescu, having at its core the irreconcilable differences between their visions of cultural history. Initially an Iorga aficionado and an admirer of his attack on foreign influences,&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 427–429&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Sburătorul'' leader left sarcastic comments on Iorga's rejection of Symbolism, and, according to Crohmălniceanu, "entire pages of ironies targeting Iorga's advice to writers that they should focus of the sufferings of their 'brother' in the village".&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 32–33&lt;/ref&gt; Lovinescu also ridiculed Iorga's traditionalist mentoring, calling him a "pontiff of indecency and insult",&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 429&lt;/ref&gt; an enemy of "democratic freedom",&lt;ref name="omintelect"/&gt; and the patron of forgettable "literature about [[hajduk]]s".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ioan Holban]], [http://www.revistaluceafarul.ro/index.html?id=3113&amp;editie=133 "Oamenii, ca pietrele din Bistrița"], in ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]'', Nr. 10/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Other authors back Lovinescu's verdict about the historian's lack of critical intuition and prowess.&lt;ref name="iscenten"/&gt;&lt;ref name="agrevenind4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gscursa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zoistlit"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 601–602, 612–613&lt;/ref&gt; According to Călinescu, Iorga was visibly embarrassed by even 19th century [[Romanticism]], out of his territory with virtually everything after "[[Filippo Villani|Villani]] and [[Philippe de Commines|Commynes]]", and endorsing the "obscure manqués" in modern Romanian letters.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 612–613&lt;/ref&gt; Alexandru George only supports in part this verdict, noting that Iorga's literary histories degenerated from "masterpiece" to "gravest mistake".&lt;ref name="agrevenind4"/&gt; An entire category of minor, largely forgotten, writers was endorsed by Iorga, among them [[Vasile Pop (writer)|Vasile Pop]],&lt;ref name="iscenten"/&gt; [[Ecaterina Pitiș]], [[Constantin T. Stoika]] and [[Sandu Teleajen]].&lt;ref name="gc613"&gt;Călinescu, p. 613&lt;/ref&gt;

Iorga's views were in part responsible for a split taking place at ''Gândirea'', occurring when his traditionalist disciple, [[Nichifor Crainic]], became the group's new leader and marginalized the Expressionists. Crainic, who was also a poet with ''Sămănătorist'' tastes, was held in esteem by Iorga, whose publications described him and his disciples as the better half of ''Gândirea''.&lt;ref name="pccarti"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grigorescu, p. 377; Livezeanu, pp. 115, 117–122; Ornea (1995), pp. 106–107, 441, 456&lt;/ref&gt; Iorga was also the subject of a ''Gândirea'' special issue, being recognized as a forerunner (a title he shared with [[Octavian Goga]] and [[Vasile Pârvan]]).&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; There was however a major incompatibility between the two traditionalist tendencies: to Iorga's [[secularism]], Crainic opposed a quasi-[[Theocracy|theocratic]] vision, based on the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]] as a guarantee of Romanian identity.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 77–79; Livezeanu, pp. 118–123; Ornea (1995), pp. 106–107; Volovici, pp. 76, 85&lt;/ref&gt; Crainic saw his own theory as an afterthought of ''Sămănătorism'', arguing that his ''Gândirism'' had erected an "azure tarpaulin", symbolizing the Church, over Iorga's nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, his ideas on the Byzantine connections and organic development of Romanian civilization were welcomed by both the ''Gândirists'' and some representatives of more conventional modernism.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, pp. 208–210, 402; Grigorescu, pp. 434, 443&lt;/ref&gt; One such figure, affiliated with ''Contimporanul'', was essayist [[Benjamin Fondane]]. His views on the bridging of tradition with modernism quoted profusely from Iorga's arguments against cultural imitation, but parted with Iorga's various other beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, pp. 208–209&lt;/ref&gt; According to Călinescu, the "philosopher-myths" (Iorga and Pârvan) also shaped the anti-''Junimist'' outlook of the 1930s ''[[Trăirism|Trăirists]]'', who returned to ethnic nationalism and looked favorably on the Dacian layer of Romanian identity.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 948–951&lt;/ref&gt; Iorga's formative influence on ''Trăirists'' such as Eliade and [[Emil Cioran]] was also highlighted by some other researchers.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandrescu, pp. 159–160; [[Erwin Kessler]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20120320231233/http://www.plural-magazine.com/article_ideas-and-ideology-in-interwar-romania.html "Ideas And Ideology in Interwar Romania"], in ''Plural Magazine'', Nr. 29/2007; {{ro icon}} [[Ovidiu Pecican]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/AVALON.-Patru-lei-tineri-interbelici*articleID_22482-articles_details.html "Avalon.

==Literary work==

===Narrative style, drama, verse and fiction===
According to some of his contemporaries, Nicolae Iorga was an outstandingly talented public speaker. One voice in support of this view is that of [[Ion Petrovici]], a ''Junimist'' academic, who recounted that hearing Iorga lecture had made him overcome a prejudice which rated Maiorescu above all Romanian orators.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 392&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931, critic [[Tudor Vianu]] found that Iorga's "great oratorical skill" and "volcanic nature" complimented a passion for the major historical phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. III, pp. 53–54&lt;/ref&gt; A decade later, George Călinescu described in detail the historian's public speaking routine: the "''[[zmeu]]''"-like introductory outbursts, the episodes of "idle grace", the apparent worries, the occasional anger and the intimate, calm, addresses to his bewildered audience.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 615&lt;/ref&gt;

The oratorical technique flowed into Iorga's contribution to ''[[belles-lettres]]''. The antiquated polished style, Călinescu notes, even surfaced in his works of research, which revived the picturesque tone of medieval chronicles.&lt;ref name="gc612"/&gt; Tudor Vianu believed it "amazing" that, even in 1894, Iorga had made "so rich a synthesis of the scholarly, literary and oratorical formulas".&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. III, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Critic [[Ion Simuț]] suggests that Iorga is at his best in [[travel writing]], combining historical fresco and picturesque detail.&lt;ref name="ispitor"/&gt; The travel writer in young Iorga blended with the essayist and, occasionally, the philosopher, although, as Vianu suggests, the ''Cugetări'' [[aphorism]]s were literary exercises rather than "philosophical system."&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. III, pp. 54–55&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Iorga's various reflections attack the core tenets of philosophy, and describe the philosopher prototype as detached from reality, intolerant of others, and speculative.&lt;ref&gt;Czobor-Lupp, pp. 123, 127, 130–131; Stanomir, ''Spiritul'', pp. 180–181; Vianu, Vol. III, pp. 55, 65–66&lt;/ref&gt;

Iorga was a highly productive dramatist, inspired by the works of [[Carlo Goldoni]],&lt;ref name="sbegoldoni"/&gt; [[William Shakespeare]], [[Pierre Corneille]] and the Romanian [[Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea]].&lt;ref name="ccpiese7"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Cosmin Ciotloș]], [http://www.romlit.ro/cteva_piese_de_rezisten_vii "Câteva piese de rezistență (VII)"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 17/2009&lt;/ref&gt; According to critic [[Ion Negoițescu]], he was at home in the genre, which complimented his vision of "history as theater".&lt;ref name="ispitor"/&gt; Other authors are more reserved about Iorga's value for this field: noting that Negoițescu's verdict is an isolated opinion, Simuț considers the plays' rhetorical monologues "hardly bearable".&lt;ref name="ispitor"/&gt; Literary historian [[Nicolae Manolescu]] found some of the texts in question illegible, but argued: "It is inconceivable that Iorga's theater is entirely obsolete".&lt;ref name="ccpiese7"/&gt; Of the twenty-some plays, including many [[Verse drama|verse works]], most are in the [[historical drama]] genre.&lt;ref name="ccpiese7"/&gt; Manolescu, who argues that "the best" of them have a medieval setting, writes that ''Constantin Brâncoveanu'', ''Un domn pribeag'' and ''Cantemir bătrânul'' are "without any interest".&lt;ref name="ccpiese7"/&gt; Iorga's other work for the stage also includes the "five-act [[fairy tale]]" ''Frumoasa fără trup'' ("Bodyless Beauty"), which repeats a motif found in [[Folklore of Romania|Romanian folklore]],&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol. I, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; and a play about [[Jesus Christ]] (where Jesus is not shown, but heard).&lt;ref&gt;Ciprian, pp. 220–221&lt;/ref&gt;

Iorga's poems include [[ode]]s to Poland, written shortly after the [[Invasion of Poland|1939 German invasion]], described by author Nicolae Mareș as "unparalleled in any other literature".&lt;ref name="nmpolonia"/&gt; Overall, however, Iorga as poet has enlisted negative characterizations, rated by Simuț as "uninteresting and obsolete".&lt;ref name="ispitor"/&gt; Among Iorga's other contributions are translations from foreign writers: [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Adriana Gagea, Ileana Șerbănescu, Bogdan Damian, ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20110910124052/http://www.bibliotecametropolitana.ro/Uploads//3_2011/154840.pdf Johann Wolfgang Goethe în cultura română (bibliografie)]'', Mihail Sadoveanu City Library, Bucharest, 1999, pp. 33, 46. {{ISBN|973-98918-9-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kostis Palamas]],&lt;ref name="nmpolonia"/&gt; Goldoni&lt;ref name="sbegoldoni"/&gt; etc. A special target for his interest was [[English literature]], whom he believed had a "fundamental bond" with Romanian lore, as traditions equally "steeped in mystery."&lt;ref name="tccpoe"/&gt; In addition to translating from [[Marie of Edinburgh]], Iorga authored versions of poems by [[William Butler Yeats]] ("[[Aedh Wishes for the Cloths of Heaven]]", "[[When You Are Old]]").&lt;ref name="albuyeats"/&gt;

===Memoirs===
In old age, Iorga had also established his reputation as a memoirist: ''Orizonturile mele'' was described by Victor Iova as "a masterpiece of Romanian literature".&lt;ref name="ivl"/&gt; George Călinescu referred to this series as Iorga's "interesting" and "eminently subjective" literature; "dignified" and dominated by "explosions of sentiment", it echoes, according to Călinescu, the [[Renaissance literature|Renaissance]] model of [[Ion Neculce]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 613–614&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the volumes were quickly written as Iorga's attempt to rehabilitate himself after a failed premiership;&lt;ref name="zomemor"/&gt; ''Orizonturile'' comprises messages on the power and justness of his cause: "And so I stand at age sixty-two, confident and strong, proud, upright in front of my conscience and the judgment of time."&lt;ref name="ivli"/&gt; The works offer retrospective arguments against Iorga's adversaries and sketch portraits of people who crossed Iorga's path—attributes which, Iova suggests, fully exploit Iorga's talents as a "polemicist" and "portraitist";&lt;ref&gt;Iova, p. l–li&lt;/ref&gt; according to Alexandru Zub, they also fall into place within the Romanian ego-history vogue, between Xenopol's and Pârvan's.&lt;ref&gt;Zub (2000), pp. 34–38, 42, 47–48&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the diaries and the memoirs are noted for their caustic and succinct portraits of Iorga's main rivals: Maiorescu as inflexible and unemotional, [[Dimitrie Sturdza]] as avaricious, [[Nae Ionescu]] as "an awful temper", Hungarian politician [[István Tisza]] as a "[[Turanid race|Turanian]]" tyrant; Iorga contributed particularly emotional, and critically acclaimed, tributes for his political friends, from [[Vasile Bogrea]] to Yugoslavia's [[Nikola Pašić]].&lt;ref name="gc614-615"/&gt; ''Supt trei regi'' abunds in positive and negative portrayals, but, Călinescu notes, it fails to show Iorga as politically astute: "he gives the impression that he knows no more [of the events] than the man of the street."&lt;ref name="gc614"&gt;Călinescu, p. 614&lt;/ref&gt;

At times, Iorga sheds a nostalgic light on his one-time opponents (similar, in Călinescu's view, to "inscriptions on their graves").&lt;ref name="gc613"/&gt; Notably in this context, Iorga reserved praise for some who had supported the [[Central Powers]] ([[Carol I of Romania|Carol I]],&lt;ref name="zomemor"/&gt; [[Virgil Arion]], [[George Coșbuc]], [[Dimitrie Onciul]]),&lt;ref&gt;Boia, 2010, p. 154, 213–214, 263–264&lt;/ref&gt; but also stated that actual collaboration with the enemy was unforgivable.&lt;ref name="gc614"/&gt; His obituary piece of socialist activist [[I. C. Frimu]], part of ''Oameni cari au fost'', was so sympathetic that the authorities had to censor it.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.curierulnational.ro/Specializat/2003-06-14/Social-democratia+romaneasca+fata+in+fata+cu+traditiile+ei "Social-democrația românească față în față cu tradițiile ei"], in ''[[Curierul Național]]'', June 14, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from being himself a writer, Iorga's public image was also preserved in the literary work of both his colleagues and adversaries. One early example is a biting [[epigram]] by [[Ion Luca Caragiale]], where Iorga is described as the dazed savant.&lt;ref&gt;Voicu, pp. 148–149&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the many autobiographies which discuss him, he is a hero in various works of fiction. As geographer Cristophor Arghir, he is the subject of a thinly disguised portrayal in the ''[[Bildungsroman]]'' ''În preajma revoluței'' ("Around the Time of the Revolution"), written by his rival [[Constantin Stere]] in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 761–762; Crohmălniceanu, p. 379&lt;/ref&gt; Celebrated Romanian satirist and ''[[Viața Românească]]'' affiliate [[Păstorel Teodoreanu]] was engaged in a lengthy polemic with Iorga, enshrining Iorga in [[Romanian humor]] as a person with little literary skill and an oversized ego,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rri.ro/arh-art.shtml?lang=1&amp;sec=170&amp;art=18161 "RRI Encyclopaedia.

Iorga's murder, like other acts of violence ordered by the Iron Guard, alarmed [[Ion Antonescu]], who found that it contradicted his resolutions on public order—the first clash in a dispute which, early in 1941, erupted as the [[Legionary Rebellion]] and saw the Guard's ouster from power.&lt;ref&gt;Deletant, p. 61sqq; Veiga, p. 292sqq&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, Iorga's murder instantly repelled some known supporters of the Guard, such as [[Radu Gyr]]&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Ioana Diaconescu, [http://www.romlit.ro/deinut_politic_sub_trei_dictaturi_radu_gyr "Deținut politic sub trei dictaturi: Radu Gyr"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 50/2006&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mircea Eliade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Matei Călinescu]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Recitind-Jurnalul-portughez*articleID_16139-articles_details.html "Recitind ''Jurnalul portughez''"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 338, September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to condemnation of his actions from his place of exile in [[Francoist Spain]], the Guard leader [[Horia Sima]] claimed to have played no part in the killing. Sima stated that he did not regret the act, noting that Iorga the scholar had had a long enough career,&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), pp. 339–341&lt;/ref&gt; and arguing, counterfactually, that the revenge was saluted by most Romanians.&lt;ref&gt;Veiga, pp. 294, 309–310&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Communist Romania|Romania's communist regime]], set up in the late 1940s, originally revised Iorga's role in the historical narrative: a record 214 works of his were banned by [[Censorship in Communist Romania|communist censors]], and remained banned until 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Ion Zubașcu, [http://www.viataromaneasca.eu/arhiva/55_viata-romaneasca-11-2008/33_atitudini/174_un-manual-de-istorie-a-comunismului-fara-scriitori.html "Un manual de istorie a comunismului fără scriitori?"], in ''[[Viața Românească]]'', Nr. 11/2008&lt;/ref&gt; From 1948, the [[Nicolae Iorga Institute of History]] was merged into a communist institution headed by [[Petre Constantinescu-Iași]], while Papacostea was assigned as head of the reorganized ISSEE.&lt;ref&gt;Olaru &amp; Herbstritt, pp. 64, 65&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1960s, the [[National communism|national communist]] authorities capitalized on Nicolae Iorga's image, suggesting that he was a forerunner of [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]]'s official ideology. Iorga was promoted to the national communist pantheon as an "[[anti-fascist]]" and "[[Progressivism|progressive]]" intellectual, and references to his lifelong [[anti-communism]] were omitted.&lt;ref&gt;Boia (2000), p. 29, 116–117.

Iorga's theories on the [[Dacians]] and the [[Thracians]] were among the many elements synthesized into the nationalist current known as [[Protochronism]], which claimed that the sources of Romanian identity were to be found in pre-Roman history, and was offered support by Ceaușescu's regime.&lt;ref&gt;Neubauer ''et al.'', p. 250&lt;/ref&gt; His work was selectively reinterpreted by Protochronists such as [[Dan Zamfirescu]],&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Mircea Martin]], [http://www.revista22.ro/cultura-romana-intre-comunism-si-nationalism-ii-241.html "Cultura română între comunism și naționalism (II)"], in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 660, October–November 2002&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mihai Ungheanu]]&lt;ref&gt;Florin Mihăilescu, ''De la proletcultism la postmodernism'', [[Editura Pontica]], Constanța, 2002, pp. 205–206. {{ISBN|973-9224-63-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Corneliu Vadim Tudor]].&lt;ref&gt;Stanomir, ''Un pămînt'', pp. 319, 323, 324; {{ro icon}} [[Traian Ungureanu]], [http://www.revista22.ro/ca-orice-paria-1317.html "Ca orice paria"], in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 768, November 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Contrasting perspectives on Iorga's legacy were held by the various voices within the [[Romanian diaspora]]. On the 40th anniversary of his death, the [[Munich]]-based Romanian section of the anti-communist [[Radio Free Europe]] (RFE) broadcast an homage piece with renewed condemnation of Iorga's killers.

'''Normal gravity formulas''' are [[Expression (mathematics)|mathematical expressions]], with which the [[Free fall|free-fall acceleration]] at a point in vicinity to the surface of the earth can be estimated. Along with the mass (known or predicted) of a body, the weight is calculated.

==Normal gravity==
The [[Free fall|acceleration due to gravity]] depends on the [[gravity]] of the mass, which rests inside of the object. The gravity decreases at longer distance between centers of mass. The acceleration due to gravity furthermore is influenced by the rotation of the earth. As centifugal force increases at longer earth's axis distance, thus centrifugal force is highest at the equator and lowest the poles.

The formulas for calculating the normal gravity is based on the assumption of an imagined rotationally symmetrical ellipsoid model of the earth, the surface of which is identical to an [[equipotential surface]]. Consequently this formula depends only on the [[Latitude|geographical latitude]] and the [[Elevation|elevation of geographical location]].

==Somigliana Formula==
For the normal gravity &lt;math&gt;\gamma_0&lt;/math&gt; of the sea level ellipsoid, i.e. elevation &amp;nbsp;h&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, this formula by Somigliana (1929) applies (after [[Carlo Somigliana]] (1860–1955)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.torinoscienza.it/accademia/personaggi/carlo_somigliana_20033 Biografie Somiglianas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207145309/http://www.torinoscienza.it/accademia/personaggi/carlo_somigliana_20033 |date=2010-12-07 }} (ital.)&lt;/ref&gt;):

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_0(\varphi) = \frac{a \cdot \gamma_a \cdot \cos^2 \varphi + b \cdot \gamma_b \cdot \sin^2 \varphi}{\sqrt{a^2 \cdot \cos^2 \varphi + b^2 \cdot \sin^2 \varphi}}&lt;/math&gt;

with
* &lt;math&gt;\gamma_a&lt;/math&gt; = Normal gravity at Equator
* &lt;math&gt;\gamma_b&lt;/math&gt; = Normal gravity at Poles
* ''a'' = [[Semi-major and semi-minor axes|semi-major axis]] (Equator radius)
* ''b'' = [[Semi-major and semi-minor axes|semi-minor axis]] (Pole radius)
* &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; = [[latitude]]

Due to [[Numerical analysis|numerical]] issues, the formula is simplified into this:

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_0 (\varphi) = \gamma_a \cdot \frac{1+p\cdot \sin^2\varphi}{\sqrt{1 - e^2 \cdot \sin^2 \varphi}}&lt;/math&gt;

with
* &lt;math&gt;p = \frac{b \cdot \gamma_b}{a \cdot \gamma_a} - 1&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;e^2 = 1 - \frac{b^2}{a^2}; \quad e&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]]

For the [[GRS 80|Geodetic Reference System 1980 (GRS&amp;nbsp;80)]] the parameters are set to these values:
:&lt;math&gt;a = 6\,378\,137 \, \mathrm{m} \quad \quad \quad            \quad b = 6\,356\,752{.}314\,1 \, \mathrm{m}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \gamma_a = 9{.}780\,326\,771\,5 \, \mathrm{\frac{m}{s^2}} \quad \gamma_b = 9{.}832\,186\,368\,5 \, \mathrm{\frac{m}{s^2}}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow p = 1{.}931\,851\,353 \cdot 10^{-3}             \quad e^2 = 6{.}694\,380\,022\,90 \cdot 10^{-3}&lt;/math&gt;

== Approximation formula from series expansions ==
The Somigliana formula was approximated through different [[series expansion]]s, following this scheme:

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_0(\varphi) = \gamma_a \cdot (1 + \beta \cdot \sin^2 \varphi + \beta_1 \cdot \sin^2 2\varphi + \dots)&lt;/math&gt;

=== International gravity formula 1930 ===
The normal gravity formula by [[Gino Cassinis]] was determined in 1930 by [[International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics]] as international gravity formula along with [[Hayford ellipsoid]]. The parameters are:

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_a = 9{.}78049 \frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{s}^2} \quad \beta = 5{.}2884 \cdot 10^{-3} \quad \beta_1 = -5{.}9 \cdot 10^{-6}&lt;/math&gt;

In the course of time the values were improved again with newer knowledge and more exact measurement methods.

[[Harold Jeffreys]] improved the values in 1948 at:

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_a = 9{.}780373 \frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{s}^2} \quad \beta = 5{.}2891 \cdot 10^{-3} \quad \beta_1 = -5{.}9 \cdot 10^{-6}&lt;/math&gt;

=== International gravity formula 1967 ===
The normal gravity formula of Geodetic Reference System 1967 is defined with the values:

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_a = 9{.}780318 \frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{s}^2} \quad \beta = 5{.}3024 \cdot 10^{-3} \quad \beta_1 = -5{.}9 \cdot 10^{-6}&lt;/math&gt;

=== International gravity formula 1980 ===
From the parameters of GRS 80 comes the classic series expansion:

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_a = 9{.}780327 \frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{s}^2} \quad \beta = 5{.}3024 \cdot 10^{-3} \quad \beta_1 = -5{.}8 \cdot 10^{-6}&lt;/math&gt;

The accuracy is about ±10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

With GRS 80 the following series expansion is also introduced:

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_0(\varphi) = \gamma_a \cdot (1 + c_1 \cdot \sin^2 \varphi + c_2 \cdot \sin^4 \varphi + c_3 \cdot \sin^6 \varphi + c_4 \cdot \sin^8\varphi + \dots)&lt;/math&gt;

As such the parameters are:
* ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 5.279&amp;nbsp;0414·10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;
* ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 2.327&amp;nbsp;18·10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;
* ''c''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 1.262·10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt;
* ''c''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 7·10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;

The accuracy is at about ±10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; exact. When the exactness is not required, the terms at further back can be omitted. But it is recommended to use this finalized formula.

== Height dependence ==
Cassinis determined the height dependence, as:

: &lt;math&gt;g(\varphi, h) = g_0(\varphi) - \left( 3{.}08 \cdot 10^{-6} \, \frac{1}{\mathrm{s}^2} - 4{.}19 \cdot 10^{-7} \, \frac{\mathrm{cm}^3}{\mathrm{g}\cdot \mathrm{s}^2} \cdot \rho \right) \cdot h&lt;/math&gt;

The average rock [[density]]&amp;nbsp;ρ is no longer considered.

Since GRS 1967 the dependence on the [[Elevation|ellipsoidal elevation]]&amp;nbsp;''h'' is:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
g(\varphi, h) &amp; = g_0(\varphi) - \left( 1 - 1{.}39 \cdot 10^{-3} \cdot \sin^2(\varphi) \right) \cdot 3{.}0877 \cdot 10^{-6} \, \frac{1}{\mathrm{s}^2} \cdot h + 7{.}2 \cdot 10^{-13} \, \frac{1}{\mathrm{m} \cdot \mathrm{s}^2} \cdot h^2\\
              &amp; = g_0(\varphi) - \left( 3{.}0877 \cdot 10^{-6} - 4{.}3 \cdot 10^{-9} \cdot \sin^2(\varphi) \right) \, \frac{1}{\mathrm{s}^2} \cdot h + 7{.}2 \cdot 10^{-13} \, \frac{1}{\mathrm{m} \cdot \mathrm{s}^2} \cdot h^2
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Another expression is:

:&lt;math&gt;g(\varphi,h) = g_0(\varphi) \cdot (1 - (k_1 - k_2 \cdot \sin^2 \varphi) \cdot h + k_3 \cdot h^2)&lt;/math&gt;

with the parameters derived from GSR80:
* &lt;math&gt;k_1 = 2 \cdot (1 + f + m) /  a    = 3{.}157\,04\cdot10^{-7}  \, \mathrm{m^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;k_2 = 4 \cdot      f      /  a    = 2{.}102\,69\cdot10^{-9}  \, \mathrm{m^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;k_3 = 3                   / (a^2) = 7{.}374\,52\cdot10^{-14} \, \mathrm{m^{-2}}&lt;/math&gt;

This adjustment is about right for common heights in [[Aviation]]; But for heights up to [[outer space]] (over ca. 100&amp;nbsp;kilometers) it is [[Limit of a function|out of range]].

== WELMEC formula ==
In all German [[Standards organization|standards offices]] the free-fall acceleration&amp;nbsp;''g'' is calculated in respect to the average latitude&amp;nbsp;φ and the average [[Sea level|height above sea level]]&amp;nbsp;''h'' with the [[WELMEC]]–Formel:

:&lt;math&gt;g(\varphi, h) = \left( 1 + 0{.}0053024 \cdot \sin^2(\varphi) - 0{.}0000058 \cdot \sin^2(2 \varphi) \right) \cdot 9{.}780318 \frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{s}^2} - 0{.}000003085 \, \frac{1}{\mathrm{s}^2} \cdot h&lt;/math&gt;

The formula is based on the International gravity formula from&amp;nbsp;1967.

The scale of free-fall acceleration at a certain place must be determined with precision measurement of several mechanical magnitudes. [[Weighing scale]]s, the mass of which does measurement because of the weight, relies on the free-fall acceleration, thus for use they must be prepared with different constants in different places of use. Through the concept of so-called gravity zones, which are divided with the use of normal gravity, a weighing scale can be calibrated by the manufacturer before use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Das europäische Gravitationszonenkonzept nach WELMEC|trans-title=|periodical=|publisher=|url=http://www.ptb.de/de/org/1/11/115/doc/gravzonen.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=26 February 2011|last=Roman Schwartz, Andreas Lindau|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&amp;#32;700kB&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Paul Gavrilovitch Vinogradoff''', [[British Academy|FBA]] ({{lang-ru|Па́вел Гаври́лович Виногра́дов}}, transliterated: ''Pavel Gavrilovich Vinogradov''; 18 November 1854 [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|(O.S.)]]{{snd}}19 December 1925) was a Russian and British [[historian]] and [[medievalist]].

== Early life ==
Vinogradoff was born in [[Kostroma]] and was educated at the local [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] and [[Moscow University]], where he studied history under [[Vasily Klyuchevsky]]. After graduating in 1875, he obtained a scholarship to continue his studies in [[Berlin]], where he studied under [[Theodor Mommsen]] and [[Heinrich Brunner]].

==Career==
Vinogradoff became professor of history at the [[University of Moscow]], but his zeal for the spread of education brought him into conflict with the authorities, and consequently he was obliged to leave Russia. Having settled in England, Vinogradoff brought a powerful and original mind to bear upon the social and economic conditions of early England, a subject which he had already begun to study in Moscow.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Vinogradoff visited Britain for the first time in 1883, working on records in the [[Public Record Office|Public Records Office]] and meeting leading English scholars such as [[Henry James Sumner Maine|Sir Henry Maine]] and [[Sir Frederick Pollock, 3rd Baronet|Sir Frederick Pollock]]. He also met [[Frederic William Maitland]], who was heavily influenced by their meeting.

Vinogradoff was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlistv American Antiquarian Society Members Directory]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903 he was elected to the position of [[Corpus Professor of Jurisprudence]] at the [[University of Oxford]], and held this position until he died in 1925. He was elected a Fellow of the [[British Academy]] in 1905. He received honorary degrees from the principal universities (including [[D.C.L.]] from the [[University of Oxford]] in October 1902, in connection with the tercentenary of the [[Bodleian Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=University intelligence |day_of_week=Wednesday |date=8 October 1902 |page_number=4 |issue=36893| }}&lt;/ref&gt;), was made a member of several foreign academies and was appointed honorary professor of [[history]] at Moscow.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Upon the death of Maitland, Vinogradoff became the literary director of the [[Selden Society]] with [[Sir Frederick Pollock, 3rd Baronet|Sir Frederick Pollock]], a position he held until 1920. During [[World War I]] he gave valuable assistance to the British Foreign Office in connection with Russian affairs.&lt;ref name&gt;{{EB1922|inline=y|wstitle=Vinogradoff, Paul|volume=32|page=927}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vinogradoff was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1917,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=30138|date=19 June 1917 |page=6047}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he and his children were [[Naturalization|naturalized]] as [[British subject]]s in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=30505|date=1 February 1918 |page=1547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925, Vinogradoff traveled to [[Paris]] to receive an honorary degree; while in Paris, he developed [[pneumonia]] and died there on 19 December.

==Books==
According to the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Eleventh Edition]], published in 1911, Vinogradoff's  ''Villainage in England'' (1892) was "perhaps the most important book written on the peasantry of the [[feudal]] age and the village community in England; it can only be compared for value with [[Frederic William Maitland|FW Maitland]]'s ''[[Domesday Book]] and Beyond''. In masterly fashion Vinogradoff here shows that the [[villein]] of [[Norman dynasty|Norman]] times was the direct descendant of the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] freeman, and that the typical Anglo-Saxon settlement was a free community, not a manor, the position of the freeman having steadily deteriorated in the centuries just around the [[Norman Conquest]]. The status of the villein and the conditions of the manor in the 12th and 13th centuries are set forth with a legal precision and a wealth of detail which shows its author, not only as a very capable historian, but also as a brilliant and learned jurist."{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

The article considered that almost equally valuable was Vinogradoff's essay on “Folkland” in vol.&amp;nbsp;viii. of the ''English Historical Review'' (1893), which proved for the first time the real nature of this kind of land. Vinogradoff followed up his ''Villainage in England'' with ''The Growth of the Manor'' (1905) and ''English Society in the Eleventh Century'' (1908), works on the lines of his earlier book.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In ''"Outlines in Historical Jurisprudence"'' (1920–22), Vinogradoff traces the development of basic themes of jurisprudence, including marriage, property, and succession, in six different types of society: the totemistic, the tribal, the ancient city state, the medieval system of feudalism and canon law, and modern industrial society.

During his time in the [[State Department]], he was responsible for formulating and implementing much of the nation's policy in Central and South America.
== Early life and education ==
Born in [[Moroleon, Guanajuato]] in 1924, Rafael Cortez Guzmán [[immigrated]] to the U.S. as a child during [[the Depression]], and worked for several years with his family in the fields of the Southwest before settling in [[East Los Angeles, California|East Los Angeles]]. He served in the [[United States Merchant Marine|Merchant Marines]] and [[Navy]] during [[World War II]], participating in [[Battle of Okinawa|the final assault on Okinawa]], and returned to complete an [[Associate degree|A.A.]] at [[East Los Angeles Junior College]] under the [[G.I. Bill]] in 1949.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

After the war, he enrolled at [[California State University, Los Angeles]], where he earned bachelor's (1958) and master's (1960) degrees in [[political science]]. In 1955 he was named director of the [[Mutualista|Alianza Hispano-Americana]]'s (a Mexican American fraternal insurance society) newly founded civil rights department, where he cultivated his skill in developing community support organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.azarchivesonline.org/xtf/view?docId=ead/asu/alianza.xml;query=|title=Alianza Hispano Americana Records                 1894-1994|website=www.azarchivesonline.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Fred Ross|Fred Ross Sr.]] and [[Edward R. Roybal|Congressman Edward R. Roybal]], Guzmán assisted in the founding of the [[Community Service Organization]] in the Los Angeles area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m_mXXvWYO-sC&amp;q=guzman#v=snippet&amp;q=guzman&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of the Mexican American Civil Rights Movement|last=Meier|first=Matt S.|last2=Gutiérrez|first2=Margo|date=2000|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780313304255|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/hispanic/congress/roybal.html|title=Hispanic Americans in Congress -- Roybal|website=www.loc.gov|access-date=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following three years spent serving as Associate Director of the [[Peace Corps]] contingents in Venezuela and Peru, Guzmán returned to Los Angeles and became one of the few Chicano graduate students (and first to receive a Ph.D. in political science) at [[UCLA]]. There, while completing his studies, he was appointed a director of the Mexican-American Study Project, and helped develop ''The Mexican Americans: Our Second Minority'' (NY, 1970).

== Research and Legacy ==
Dr. Guzmán's research, put forth in ''The Mexican Americans:'' ''Our Second Minority,'' was essential to the Chicano Anti-Vietnam Movement. His researched showed that disproportionate numbers of Latino Americans were dying in the war.

Guzman drew his conclusions from US military records and the surnames of the casualties, identifying Spanish surnames as Latinos. Recently, Pomona College historian Tomas Summer Sandoval  revisited Guzman's work using more thoroughly tested surnames lists and confirmed Guzmán's conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://prezi.com/qzxzaqqmcnhk/ralph-guzman-and-latino-casualties/|title=Ralph Guzman and Latino Casualties|website=prezi.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2015 PBS documentary ''On Two Fronts: Latinos &amp; Vietnam,'' which examines the Latino experience during the Vietnam War, Sandoval says in an interview, "The Chicano Anti Vietnam War Movement does not exist without the research of Ralph Guzman. He is the verifiable proof of their common sense understanding that this war was disproportionately affecting our community."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/on-two-fronts-latinos-vietnam/id1038143511|title=On Two Fronts: Latinos &amp; Vietnam on iTunes|website=iTunes|language=en|access-date=2017-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''On Two Fronts: Latinos &amp; Vietnam''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2049">A '''riddle joke''', '''joke riddle''', '''pseudo-joke''' or '''conundrum''' is a [[riddle]] that does not expect the asked person to know the answer, but rather constitutes  a set-up to the humorous [[punch line]] of the joke.&lt;ref name=kfq&gt;Mac E. Barrick, "Racial Riddles &amp; the Pollack Joke", ''Keystone Folklore Quarterly'', Volume 15, Issue 1, 1970, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YJDYAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA9 p. 3-15]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is one of the four major types of riddles, according to [[Nigel F. Barley]].&lt;ref&gt;Nigel F. Barley, "Structural Aspects of the [[Anglo-Saxon riddles|Anglo-Saxon Riddle]]", ''Semiotica'' 10 (2) (1974)&lt;/ref&gt; There are many cycles of jokes in the form of a conundrum, such as [[Elephant joke]]s,&lt;ref name=kfq/&gt; "[[Why did the chicken cross the road?]]" and [[lightbulb joke]]s.

Joke cycles implying inferiority or other [[stereotype]]s of certain categories of people, such as [[blonde joke]]s, or [[ethnic joke]]s (such as [[Pollack joke]]) have a considerable amount of joke riddles.&lt;ref name=kfq/&gt;

==Abstract riddles==
In areas which have historical ties with [[Asia Minor]], such as Greece, Turkey, Armenia, of popularity are "abstract riddles" that follow templates: "What is this: A inside and B outside?" or "What is this: A is around and B in the middle?". For example: 
{{block indent|&lt;poem&gt;Q: What is [[wool]] outside and [[cotton]] inside?
A: A [[poodle]] in front of a drugstore with [[cotton swab]]s on sale.&lt;ref&gt;[[Salcia Landmann]], ''Der Jüdische Witz, Soziologie und Sammlung'' ("The Jewish Humor, Its Sociology and a Collection", citing from the Russian translation: ''Еврейское остроумие'', 2002, {{ISBN|978-5-9953-0202-5}}, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}
{{block indent|&lt;poem&gt;Q:What is water around and the law in the middle?
A: Judge [[Karapetyan]] in his pool.&lt;/poem&gt;}}
{{block indent|&lt;poem&gt;Q:What is meat outside and iron inside?
A:Tailor [[Hovhannes (disambiguation)|Hovhannes]] swallowed a needle.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

[[Image:Appalachian region of United States.png|thumb|right|350px|Areas included within the [[Appalachian Regional Commission|Appalachian Regional Commission's]] charter.]]

The Appalachian region of the [[Eastern United States]] is home to over 25 million people and covers parts of mostly mountainous areas of 13 states, including [[Mississippi]], [[Alabama]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[South Carolina]], [[North Carolina]], [[Tennessee]], [[Virginia]], [[Kentucky]], [[Ohio]], [[Maryland]], and the entire state of [[West Virginia]].&lt;ref name="hurst"&gt;Hurst, Charles. (1992). Inequality in Appalachia. Social Inequality: Forms, Causes, and Consequences, 6th Edition. Pearson Education. pp 62-68.&lt;/ref&gt; The near-isolation of the area's rugged [[topography]] is home to communities with a distinct culture, who in many cases are put at a disadvantage because of the transportation and [[infrastructure]] problems that have developed.&lt;ref name="hurst"/&gt;

[[Appalachia]] is often divided into three regions—southern (portions of Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, North and South Carolina, and Tennessee), central (portions of Kentucky, West Virginia, Ohio, Virginia, and Tennessee), and northern (parts of New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Ohio) Appalachia.&lt;ref name="hurst"/&gt; Though all areas of Appalachia share problems of [[rural poverty]], inadequate jobs, services, transportation, education, and infrastructure, some elements (particularly those relating to [[industry]] and [[natural resource extraction]]) are unique to each sub-region. For example, Appalachians in the central sub-region experience the deepest [[poverty]], partially due to the area's isolation from [[urban growth]] centers.&lt;ref name="tick"&gt;Tickamyer, Ann; Cynthia, Duncan. (1990). Poverty and Opportunity Structure in Rural America. ''Annual Review of Sociology''. 16:67-86. Retrieved November 28 from Academic Search Premier.&lt;/ref&gt;

Appalachia is particularly interesting in the context of social and economic divisions within and between the region's socioeconomic communities. In addition, outsiders' often incorrect and over-generalized external perspectives, and their relationship to culture and folklore of this near-isolated area, are important to the region's future development.&lt;ref name="hurst"/&gt;

==Poverty, politics, and uneven economic development==
Though industry and business existed in Appalachia before the 20th century, the major modern industries of agriculture, large-scale [[coal mining]], [[timber]], and other outside corporate entries did not truly take root until this time. Many Appalachianites sold their rights to land and minerals to such corporations, to the extent that 99 percent of the residents control less than half of the land. Thus, though the area has a wealth of natural resources, natives are often poor.&lt;ref name="hurst"/&gt; Since at least the 1960s, Appalachia has a higher poverty rate and a higher percentage of working poor than the rest of the nation. Wages, [[Unemployment|employment rates]], and [[education]] also lag. The [[Appalachian Regional Commission]] (ARC) was created in 1965 to address some of the region's problems, and though there have been improvements, serious issues still exist. Communities that are not considered "growth centers" are bypassed for investment and fall further behind. In 1999, roughly a quarter of the counties in the region qualified as "distressed," the ARC's worst status ranking. Fifty-seven percent of adults in central Appalachia did not graduate [[high school]] (as opposed to less than 20 percent in the general U.S.&lt;ref name="denham"&gt;Denham, Sharon; Mande, Man; Meyer, Michael; Toborg, Mary. (2004). Providing Health Education to Appalachia Populations.  Holistic Nursing Practices 2{X)4:I8(6):293-3O1. Retrieved November 30 from Academic Search Premier.&lt;/ref&gt;), roughly 20 percent of homes have no [[telephone]], and the population is declining.&lt;ref name="thorne"&gt;
THORNE, DEBORAH; TICKAMYER, ANN; THORNE, MARK. (2005). Poverty and Income in Appalachia. ''Journal of Appalachian Studies''. Volume 10 Number 3. Retrieved November 29 from Academic Search Premier.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the statistics conducted by ARC, out of every three Appalachians, one suffered from poverty; their average income was 23 percent lower than the average level of American per capita income; and due to the poor [[infrastructure]], [[health care]], high [[unemployment|unemployment rate]] and other tough living conditions, there were two million or more Appalachians who has left their homes for living during the 1950s.&lt;ref name="ARC History"&gt;{{cite web|title=ARC History|url=http://www.arc.gov/about/archistory.asp|website=Arc.gov|publisher=Appalachian Regional Commission|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poverty in Appalachian has not been paid attention until the 1960s. In the year 1960, the Region's government was trying to solve the poverty problem with a will. After one year, the newly elected President [[John F. Kennedy]] was touched by the poverty he saw there and decided to improve the living standard of Appalachians. In 1963, President Kennedy set up [[Appalachian Regional Commission|President's Appalachian Regional Committee]], aimed to formulate a program to improve the Appalachian economy. The program was outlined in 1964. And one year later, his successor, [[Lyndon B. Johnson|President Lyndon B. Johnson]] submitted PARC's reports to the Congress and was passed in 1965.&lt;ref name="ARC History"/&gt;

===Infrastructure as an agent of poverty===
One of the factors at the root of Appalachian economic struggles is the poor infrastructure. Though the region is crisscrossed by many [[U.S. highway|U.S.]] and [[Interstate Highway System|interstate]] highways, those routes primarily serve cross-country traffic rather than local traffic. Towns closer to the major highways and nearer to the many larger cities fringing the region ([[Pittsburgh]], [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling]], [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Cincinnati]], [[Atlanta]], [[Washington, D.C.]], etc.) are disproportionately better-off than rural regions in the mountainous interior.

[[Transportation in Appalachia|Transportation]] may be the reason which most restricts the development of the economy. So after the Appalachian Regional Commission was established, road construction has become the first concern of regional development. In the following years, the Commission has spent plenty of capital on road construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burton|first1=M|last2=Hatcher|first2=R|title=Introduction to Transportation section, Encyclopedia of Appalachia|date=2006|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|location=Knoxville, Tenn.|pages=685–690|accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of being tied to the land, jobs in the towns tend to emphasize industry and [[tertiary sector of the economy|services]]—important signs of a more diversified economy. However, aside from the major urban centers along its perimeter, the entire Appalachian region still suffers from population decline and the loss of younger residents to the cities.

Another factor affecting development has been sheer inequality in power between the classes. Historically, elites interested in satisfying personal goals have controlled Appalachian politics to the expense of the region's poorer residents.&lt;ref name="hurst"/&gt; Seeing no personal benefit to establishing infrastructure, they generally eschewed developments that would have been difficult and expensive to establish in the mountainous areas.&lt;ref name="hurst"/&gt; Instead, they allowed the region to rely on industry—using barges to send natural resources to market, requiring that workers have only minimal education, etc.--and created no infrastructure for business.&lt;ref name="narciso"&gt;Narciso, Dean. (1998). Appalachia spring: Will it ever come? Christian Science Monitor, 08827729, Vol. 90, Issue 215. Retrieved November 28 from Academic Search Premier.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a lot of evidence to show that economic status generally has a positive effect on education. This positive link suggests that people in Appalachia are less educated than in rest areas of the nation. "Labor economists estimated that the inflation-adjusted rate of return to an additional year of schooling is about 10 percent on average".&lt;ref name="Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ziliak|first1=James P.|title=Human capital and the challenge of persistent poverty in Appalachia|url=http://www.clevelandfed.org/research/commentary/2007/020107.cfm?wt.oss=fourth%252520district%252520employment%252520conditions&amp;wt.oss_r=1970|website=Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland|publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland|accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland) This means, each additional school year will contribute a 10 percent average gain in earnings. "At the same time, this 10 percent average return masks important variation in returns across individuals with different levels of schooling".&lt;ref name="Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland"/&gt; (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland) High school graduates often earn more than those with [[General Educational Development|GED]] recipients. During past decades, the Appalachian population are better educated than many years ago, but it still lags behind the United States' average level.&lt;ref name="Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland"/&gt;

From Burris's research, the central lands of Appalachia have been dominated by landowners who only show interest in the profits of [[mountaintop removal mining|mountaintop coal mining]], undermining the importance of those who live in the areas and the effect their business has on their lives. It is the cyclical way of life where [[Moral hazard|those who profit from the detrimental effects are the ones who do not have to endure those effects]]. This economy has caused a region-wide [[Depression (economics)|depression]] on the people as well as other afflictions such as illness and addiction. The goal is to eliminate the depression and need people feel to abuse pain medications. As systems work together to aim attention of younger generations at education instead of drugs.
"For well over a century now, central Appalachia has been ruled by absentee landowners only interested in making the highest profit available from natural resource extraction, primarily coal. From the beginning of its presence in the mountains, the coal industry intentionally created single-industry economies to exert absolute control over the people, the politicians, the land and the wealth that still flows out of the mountains".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burris|first1=Theresa L.|title=Appalachian cultural consequences from the War on Poverty|url=http://www.apa.org/pi/ses/resources/indicator/2014/01/consequences.aspx|website=apa.org|publisher=American Psychological Association|accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (American Psychological Association)

Now, with roughly 100,000 jobs left for miners, Appalachianites are unable to access jobs or the resources and opportunities necessary to lift themselves out of poverty.&lt;ref name="foer"&gt;Foer, Franklin, Allen, Jodie T. (1999). Is Poverty Fixable? U.S. News &amp; World Report, 00415537, Vol. 127, Issue 3 Retrieved November 28 From Academic Search Premier.&lt;/ref&gt; Some academics contend that the situation of Appalachianites amounts to one similar to that in [[third world]] countries: Residents live on land that cannot be traded outside of trusted circles or used as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] because, due to the history of unincorporated businesses with unidentified liabilities, there are not adequate records of [[ownership rights]].&lt;ref name="deaton"&gt;Deaton, James. LAND "IN HEIRS":  BUILDING A HYPOTHESIS CONCERNING TENANCY IN COMMON AND THE PERSISTENCE OF POVERTY IN CENTRAL APPALACHIA. Journal of Appalachian Studies. VOLUME 11 NUMBERS 1 &amp; 2. Retrieved November 29, 2007, from Academic Search Premier.&lt;/ref&gt; This "dead" [[Capital (economics)|capital]] is a factor that contributes to the historical poverty of the region, limiting Appalachianites' abilities to use their investments in home and other land-related capital.&lt;ref name="deaton"/&gt;

The [[United States Congress]] finds that the reason why Appalachian abundance in natural resources lags behind in economic development is that people in this area are not share equally of nation's economic wealth.&lt;ref name="ARC History"/&gt; (ARC)

===Political inequalities===
The [[elite class]] instilled strong systems of [[Economic inequality|inequality]] into Appalachian politics and economy. For instance, the powerful have a history of encouraging [[racial divisions]] in order to divide workers and pit them against each other, spurring competition and serving to lower workers' wages.&lt;ref name="duncan"&gt;Duncan, Cynthia Mildred. (1999). Civic Life in Gray Mountain. Connection: New England's Journal of Higher Education &amp; Economic Development, Vol. 14, Issue 2, Retrieved November 29 From Academic Search Premier.&lt;/ref&gt; Family history and [[economic status]] are also bases of discrimination: One resident notes of employers, "If you have a rich name, they'll take you--otherwise you can't get no work."&lt;ref name="duncan"/&gt;

Since the 19th century, coal operators and plantation bosses have discouraged education and [[civic action]], allowing workers to become indebted to plantation stores, live in company housing, and generally make themselves vulnerable to the interests of their powerful employers.&lt;ref name="duncan"/&gt; Community members who experienced a justifiable fear of punishment for speaking out against the corruption of the [[status quo]] developed a habit of [[Compliance (regulation)|compliance]] rather than democratic institutions for [[social change]]. Fearful of punishment, middle class residents allied themselves with the elites rather than challenging the system that colored their everyday lives. Burdened by the choice between exile and exploitation, the actual and potential middle class left the region, widening the gap between the poor and those in power.&lt;ref name="duncan"/&gt; Observers often perceive a fatalistic attitude on the part of the Appalachian people;&lt;ref name="billings"&gt;Billings, Dwight. (1974). Culture and Poverty in Appalachia: a Theoretical Discussion and Empirical Analysis. Social Forces vol. 53:2. Retrieved November 29, 2007, from Academic Search Premier.&lt;/ref&gt; many suggest that this is due to the history of political corruption and [[disenfranchisement]], which led to weak [[civic cultures]] and a sense of powerlessness. Says a volunteer in the area, "the people usually regard politicians as crooks who won't do anything."&lt;ref name="vidulich"&gt;Vidulich, Dorothy. (1995).  Church at home in Appalachian hills. National Catholic Reporter, 00278939, Vol. 31, Issue 39. Retrieved November 29 from Academic Search Premier.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the remote mountain districts, violent feuds usually happen. Appalachians use assassination and guns as weapons, against each other for several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Otterbein|first1=F. K|title=Five Feuds: An Analysis of Homicides in Eastern Kentucky in the Late Nineteenth Century|journal=American Anthropologist|date=2000|volume=102|issue=2|pages=231–243|doi=10.1525/aa.2000.102.2.231}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major participants are always elite class and people who are fighting for their [[civil and political right|political rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Billings|first1=D. B|last2=Blee|first2=K.M|title=Where the Sun Set Crimson and the Moon Rose Red": Writing Appalachia and the Kentucky Mountain Feuds|journal=Southern Cultures|date=1996|volume=2|issue=3/4|pages=329–352|doi=10.1353/scu.1996.0005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational disadvantages==
In 2000, 80.49 percent of all adults in the United States were high school graduates, as opposed to 76.89 in Appalachia.&lt;ref name="shaw"&gt;Shaw, THOMAS; DeYoun, Allan; Redemacher, Eric. (2005). EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT IN APPALACHIA: GROWING WITH THE NATION, BUT CHALLENGES REMAIN. ''Journal of Appalachian Studies''. Volume 10 Number 3. Retrieved November 29, 2007, from Academic Search Premier.&lt;/ref&gt; Almost 30 percent of Appalachian adults are considered [[functionally illiterate]].&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt; Education differences between men and women are greater in Appalachia than the rest of the nation, tying into a greater trend of [[gender inequalities]].&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt;

Education in Appalachia has historically lagged behind average literacy levels of United States.&lt;ref name="University of Tennessee Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeYang|first1=A|title=Introduction to Education section, Encyclopedia of Appalachia|date=2006|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|location=Knoxville, Tenn.|pages=1517–1521|accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, education in this region was largely nurtured through religious institutions. Children who found time away from family work were often taught to read about the Bible and Christian morality. Then, after the civil war, some districts established primary schools and high schools. People began to access standard education during this period, and higher education in large communities was expanded at that time.&lt;ref name="University of Tennessee Press"/&gt; Lately, in the late 19th century and early 20th century, education in rural areas has been advanced; some settlement schools and sponsored schools were established by organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alvic|first1=P|title=Settlement, Mission, and Sponsored Schools|journal=Encyclopedia of Appalachia|date=2006|page=1551}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, the national policy has begun affecting education in Appalachia. Those schools were trying to meet the demands which federal and state settled. Some public schools were facing the problem of gathering funds because of government's No Child Left Behind policy.&lt;ref name="University of Tennessee Press"/&gt; (DeYoung 1517–1521)

Since Appalachia is a place with abundant resources such as coal, mineral, land and forest, the main jobs here are lumbering, mining and farming. None of these jobs need a high education, and employers don't decide the jobs based on their education level. A diploma has not been a priority in job finding. Many children of school age dropped school to help their family work.&lt;ref name="ncda.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=New Opportunity School for Women: A unique career and education program in Appalachia|url=http://www.ncda.org/aws/NCDA/pt/sd/news_article/69382/_PARENT/layout_details_cc/false|website=ncda.org|publisher=National Career Development Association|accessdate=14 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women in Appalachia have less opportunity in access of jobs. Many kinds of jobs in this area require a strong body, so that men are preferred than women by employers when they are seeking jobs.&lt;ref name="ncda.org"/&gt;

The National Career Development Association has organized a program hoping to increase the education in the Appalachia region, which has been deprived of what other parts of the nation take for granted. The region is primarily utilized for mining, coal, and its other natural resources and farmland. Families that live in these parts have become accustomed to a certain way of life whether it involve school or working. Many kids are not given the opportunity to be successful, only to remain in the family business surrounding one of the many natural resources from their land. The New Opportunity School for Women, NOSW, has begun offering 14 women a 3-week course in Berea, Kentucky, on employment opportunities, skills, basic knowledge that they may not have received. The NOSW also offers a residential housing opportunity to those with low-income after their participation in the course and thereafter. This brings hope to Appalachian women, although it only allows 14 participants, it is a start and that number can only grow with growth within the Appalachian region.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Francis|first1=Caroline|title=New opportunity school for women: A unique career and education program in Appalachia|url=http://www.ncda.org/aws/ncda/pt/sd/news_article/69382/_parent/layout_details_cc/false|website=ncda.org|publisher=National Career Development Association|accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Women from the Appalachian region of Kentucky and surrounding south central Appalachian states share common challenges resulting from low educational attainment, limited employment skills, few strong role models and low self-esteem. The presence of these challenges are directly linked to high incidences of early marriage, teen pregnancies, divorce, domestic violence, substance abuse and high school dropout rates".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; (National Career Development Association.)

This program provides interview, job search, computer and other basic skills that are useful in careers for those less skilled. Women can participate freely, no extra money is required.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Participants are provided with classes from Monday to Friday, 8 am to 12 pm and afternoon is internship time. These classes are mainly about: job search, interview skill, math, women's health, computer skills, leadership development, and self-protection.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; (National Career Development Association) Internships not only include working in a real work site, but also include a training of choosing interview clothes and make-ups. The organizer will also hold some events during the weekends except for additional classes. For instance, the American Association of University Women and the Berea Younger Women's Club are available for participants to choose. They can also go for a field trip to some places. All these efforts are conducted to help women build confidence in job finding. As a vulnerable group of people, these rich experiences can help them become an active part in their living communities. After graduated from NOSW, professional agencies will provides each of them counseling services about education. This program has achieved active outcomes. According to a recent survey, after attending this program, 80 percent of those women participants have incomes for less than 10,000 dollars per year with their half high school degree.

Women have traditionally been reedited to the domestic sphere, often lack access to resources and employment opportunities, are disproportionately represented in [[peripheral labor markets]], and have lower wages and higher vulnerability to job loss.&lt;ref name="denham"/&gt; Throughout the region, women typically earn 64 percent of men's wages. However, when adjusted for the fact that women take less risky jobs, that require less qualifications, they make roughly the same amount.&lt;ref name="oberhauser"&gt;Oberhauser, Ann; Latimer, Melissa. (2005). EXPLORING GENDER AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN APPALACHIA. ''Journal of Appalachian Studies''. Volume 10 Number 3. Retrieved November 28 from Academic Search Premier.&lt;/ref&gt; Women are also often the hardest-hit by poverty—for example, 70 percent of [[female-headed households]] with children under the age of six are in distressed counties, a figure substantially higher than the national average.&lt;ref name="thorne"/&gt;

Where there is oppression, there is opposition. There are a lot of fearless and outstanding women in Appalachia who stood out to fight for their rights. Women in the Appalachia have long earned their reputation for being strong as well as struggling. Among the many men within the region, women have participated in the fields, mines, and labor movements. Many women have given their all and then some for their families and to stand up for what they believe in. Women have also made waves through literature, art, and keeping their stories and family history alive within their culture.

"Women have played a major role in the labor and activist movements in the coal-bearing regions of Appalachia.", "Other crucial roles for women have involved education, literature, healthcare and art, and the promotion of minorities in our region".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Women of Appalachia|url=http://appvoices.org/appalachianwomen/|website=appvoices.org|publisher=Appalachian Voices|accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Appalachian Voices).

There are many achievements conducted by outstanding women leadership. Those women devoted their lifelong efforts in improving their social status and in fighting against poverty in their communities and their living regions. A woman named Kathy Selvage was a citizen lobbyist for years and worked in the fight against a proposal for a Wise County coal-fired plant. She says that Appalachian women are people of action. Lorelei Scarbro helped establish a community center in Whitesville, W.V. to encourage outside activity besides the home and workplace. This reunites them with togetherness and a place to convene about ideas and local build-up. Vivian Stockman is the face of the stand against mountaintop removal and has worked endlessly to spread the word through photos of the detrimental effects it has on the land that people call home. These women, among countless others have done everything they can to end the poverty and depression that has plagued their region for so long.

"A coal miner's daughter from Wise County, Va., Selvage has always had a great respect for miners, but when a coal company began blasting off mountaintops in her community, Selvage began working to bring national exposure to mountaintop removal coal mining".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Heart of The Mountaintop Removal Movement|url=http://appvoices.org/2011/02/04/mountaintop-removal/|website=appvoices.org|publisher=Appalachian Voices|accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Appalachian Voices).
Rural Appalachian has found projects to help women save for their life especially life after retirement.  It is kind of program to help females who have problems in raising their children and retirement save money. Some women have saved surprisingly a little for their retirement and they are facing the risk of running out of their money. Appalachian Savings Project was established to alleviate this risk by recreating saving plans for those self-employed women workers who do not have those plans provided by companies. This program is aiming to help the female workers who have children to care about. Anita Wallace is a mother who operates a family day care in Athens County, Ohio. She is 40 years old while her husband is 47 years old and they have three of their own children to raise. As Wallace is self-employed, she has not provided with company retirement plans, for example, company 401(k). She often complaints about that it is expensive to raise children. Since she is not employed by an other company, to have retirement funds is a difficult thing for her. Appalachian Saving Project made her an offer that "if she saved 600 dollars in United States saving bonds in a year, it would match half of that".&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ludden|first1=Jennifer|title=Rural Appalachia Helps Some Women Save For Retirement|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/03/20/291912681/rural-appalachia-helps-some-women-save-for-retirement|website=npr.org|publisher=npr|accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;(Npr) Wallace thought it was a great idea, because even if she has not enough money to put in one month, she doesn't need to worry about that. Now she has an account and save 50 dollars per month in it. This program is designed to help women with low or relatively low incomes save for their retired life and to alleviate the retirement crisis for them. Due to the lagged economic status in Appalachian regions and discriminations, there are an increasing number of women who are getting jobs without comprehensive benefits, such as retirement plans. Instead of consumption, it is an investment to have this saving account. Many mothers put their children at first place and will not start to save money for their retirement until their children are independent and do not need their help any more. However, this program is encouraging them to save money for their own need instead of their kids'. There are also some complaints. Most of them complain that they don't have enough time to attend the financial classes and money is always not enough to spare. In a word, the road ahead of Appalachian Saving Project will not be flat. All it wants is that women can realize they can save for themselves and then save more.&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt;

==Outside perspectives and stereotypes==
Though mainstream Americans assume that [[Appalachian culture]] is [[wikt:homogeneous|homogeneous]] in the region, many distinct locales and sub-regions exist.&lt;ref name="billings"/&gt;&lt;ref name="oberhausery"&gt;Oberhauser, Ann M. (1995). Towards a gendered regional geography: Women and work in rural Appalachia. ''Growth &amp; Change'', 00174815, Spring 95, Vol. 26, Issue 2. Retrieved November 29 from Academic Search Premier Database.&lt;/ref&gt; Over-generalizations of Appalachianites as impulsive, personalistic, and individualistic "hillbillies" abound. Many scholars speculate that these stereotypes have been created by powerful economic and political forces to justify exploitation of Appalachian peoples.&lt;ref name="billings"/&gt; For example, the same forces that put up barriers to prevent the development of civic culture promulgate the image of Appalachian peoples as politically apathetic, without a [[social consciousness]], and deserving of their disenfranchised state. In spite of the region's desperate need for aid, weariness of being represented as "helpless, dumb and poor" often creates an attitude of hostility among Appalachianites.&lt;ref name="mellon"&gt;Mellon, Steve.

===Appalachians as a separate status group===
It has been suggested that Appalachia constitutes a separate [[status group]] under the sociologist [[Max Weber]]'s definition.&lt;ref name="hursty"&gt;
Hurst, Charles. (1992). The Theory of Social Status. Social Inequality: Forms, Causes, and Consequences, 6th Edition. Pearson Education. pp 46.
&lt;/ref&gt; The criteria are tradition, [[endogamy]], an emphasis on intimate interaction and isolation from outsiders, monopolization of economic opportunities, and ownership of certain commodities rather than others.&lt;ref name="hursty"/&gt; Appalachia fulfills at least the first four, if not all five.&lt;ref name="billings"/&gt; Furthermore, mainstream Americans tend to see Appalachia as a separate subculture of [[low status]]. Based on these facts, it is reasonable to say that Appalachia constitutes a separate status group.&lt;ref name="hurst"/&gt;&lt;ref name="billings"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26562">[[Vedic Sanskrit|Vedic]] has a number of linguistic features which are alien to most other Indo-European languages. Prominent examples include: [[phonologically]], the introduction of [[retroflex]]es, which alternate with [[Dental consonant|dentals]]; [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]], the formation of [[gerund]]s; and [[syntactically]], the use of a [[quotative]] [[Marker (linguistics)|marker]] (''iti'').&lt;ref name=Bryant&gt;{{cite book|first=Edwin |last=Bryant |title=The Quest for the Origins of Vedic Culture: The Indo-Aryan Migration Debate |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|79}}  Philologists attribute such features, as well as the presence of non-Indo-European vocabulary, to a local [[substratum]] of languages encountered by [[Indo-Aryan peoples]] in Central Asia and within the Indian subcontinent, including the [[Dravidian languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Ferenc|last=Rusza|date=2009|title=The influence of Dravidian on Indo-Aryan phonetics|journal=Jared S.

Scholars  have identified a substantial body of loanwords in the earliest Indian texts, including clear evidence of Non-Indo-Aryan elements (such as -s- following -u- in Rigvedic  ''busa''). While some loanwords are from [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]], and other forms are traceable to [[Munda languages|Munda]]&lt;ref name=Bryant/&gt;{{rp|78}} or Proto-[[Burushaski]], the bulk have no sensible basis{{According to whom|date=April 2013}} in any of these families, suggesting a source in one or more lost languages. The discovery that some loan words from one of these lost sources had also been preserved in the earliest [[Iran]]ian texts, and also in [[Tocharian languages|Tocharian]], convinced [[Michael Witzel]] and Alexander Lubotsky that the source lay in Central Asia and could be associated with the [[Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex]] (BMAC).&lt;ref name=Witzel05&gt;{{cite book|first=Michael |last=Witzel |chapter=Central Asian Roots and Acculturation in South Asia.

==Phonology==
Retroflex phonemes  are now found throughout the [[Burushaski]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=H.|last= Berger |title=Die Burushaski-Sprache von Hunza und Nagar |volume =1–3 |location=Wiesbaden|publisher= Harrassowitz |date=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nuristani languages|Nuristani]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=G. |last=Morgenstierne |title=Irano-Dardica |location=Wiesbaden |date=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] and [[Munda languages|Munda]] families.  They are reconstructed for Proto-Burushaski, Proto-Dravidian and (to a minimal extent) for Proto-Munda,&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Gregory D. S. |editor-last=Anderson |title=The Munda Languages |location=London and New York |publisher=Routledge |series=Routledge Language Family Series |date=2008 |isbn=978-0-415-32890-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K_lTPgAACAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; and are thus clearly an [[areal feature]] of the Indian subcontinent. They are not reconstructible for either [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] or [[Proto-Indo-Iranian language|Proto-Indo-Iranian]], and they are also not found in [[Mitanni]]–Indo-Aryan loanwords.

The acquisition of the phonological trait by early Indo-Aryan is thus unsurprising, but it does not immediately permit identification of the donor language. Since the adoption of a retroflex series does not affect [[Vedic meter|poetic meter]], it is impossible to say if it predates the early portions of the Rigveda or was a part of Indo-Aryan when the Rigvedic verses were being composed; however, it is certain that at the time of the redaction of the Rigveda (ca. 500 BC), the retroflex series had become part of Sanskrit phonology. There is a clear predominance of retroflexion in the Northwest ([[Nuristani languages|Nuristani]], [[Dardic languages|Dardic]], [[Khotanese language|Khotanese]] Saka, [[Burushaski]]), involving affricates, sibilants and even vowels (in [[Kalasha-mun|Kalasha]]), compared to other parts of the subcontinent. It has been suggested that this points to the regional, northwestern origin of the phenomenon in Rigvedic.&lt;ref name=Witzel99&gt;{{cite journal |first=Michael |last=Witzel |title=Substrate Languages in Old Indo-Aryan (Rigvedic, Middle and Late Vedic) |url=http://www.ejvs.laurasianacademy.com/ejvs0501/ejvs0501article.pdf |journal=Electronic Journal of Vedic Studies |volume=5 |issue=1 |date=1999 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206073939/http://www.ejvs.laurasianacademy.com/ejvs0501/ejvs0501article.pdf |archivedate=6 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bertil Tikkanen is open to the idea that various [[syntactical]] developments in Indo-Aryan could have been the result of [[adstratum]] rather than the result of [[Substratum|substrate]] influences.&lt;ref name=Bryant/&gt;{{rp|80–82}} However Tikkanen states that "in view of the strictly areal implications of retroflexion and the occurrence of retroflexes in many early loanwords, it is hardly likely that Indo-Aryan retroflexion arose in a region that did not have a substratum with retroflexes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Bertil|last= Tikkanen|chapter= Archaeological-linguistic correlations in the formation of retroflex typologies and correlating areal features in South Asia |editor-first=Roger |editor1-last=Blench |editor2-first=Matthew |editor2-last=Spriggs |title=Archaeology and Language |volume=4 |location=London |publisher=Routledge |date=1999 |pages= 138–148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only the typological development of Old to Middle Indo-Aryan, but already the phonological development from Pre-Vedic to Vedic (including even the oldest attested form in the Rig-Veda) is suggestive of Dravidian influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ruzsa|first1=Ferenc|editor1-last=Klein|editor1-first=Jared S.|editor2-last=Yoshida|editor2-first=Kazuhiko|title=Indic across the Millennia: From the Rigveda to Modern Indo-Aryan: 14th World Sanskrit Conference, Kyoto, Japan, September 1st–5th, 2009, Proceedings of the Linguistic Section|date=2013|publisher=Ute Hempen Verlag|location=Bremen|isbn=978-393-41060-5-5|pages=145–152|chapter-url=https://www.academia.edu/472464|accessdate=27 June 2014|chapter-format=PDF|chapter=The Influence of Dravidian on Indo-Aryan Phonetics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vocabulary==
In 1955 [[Thomas Burrow|Burrow]] listed some 500 words in Sanskrit that he considered to be loans from non-Indo-European languages. He noted that in the earliest form of the language such words are comparatively few, but they progressively become more numerous. Though mentioning the likelihood that one source was lost Indian languages extinguished by the advance of Indo-Aryan, he concentrated on finding loans from [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Thomas |last=Burrow |title=The Sanskrit Language |edition=3rd |date=1955 |pages=397–8 &amp; ch. 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[F B J Kuiper|Kuiper]] identified 383 specifically Rigvedic words as non-Indo-Aryan — roughly 4% of its vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=F. B. J. |last=Kuiper |chapter=Rigvedic loanwords|title=Studia Indologica |editor=Spies |location=Bonn |date=1955 |pages= 137–185}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kuiper91&gt;{{cite book|first=F. B. J. |last=Kuiper|title=Aryans in the Rigveda |publisher=Rodopi |date=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oberlies prefers to consider 344–358 "secure" non-Indo-European words in the Rigveda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=T. |last=Oberlies |title=Review Article: F. B. J. Kuiper: ''Aryans in the Rigveda''|journal=Indo-Iranian Journal |volume= 37 |issue=4 |date=1994 |pages= 333–349 |doi=10.1163/000000094790084162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if all local non-Indo-Aryan names of persons and places are subtracted from Kuiper's list, that still leaves some 211–250 "foreign" words, around 2% of the total vocabulary of the Rigveda.&lt;ref name=Witzel00&gt;{{cite web|first=Michael E. J. |last=Witzel |url=http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/IndusLang.pdf |title=The Languages of Harappa|date= 17 February 2000 |type=Preliminary version prepared for Kenoyer, J. (ed.): ''Proceedings of the conference on the Indus civilization, Madison 1998''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These loanwords cover local flora and fauna, agriculture and artisanship, terms of toilette, clothing and household. Dancing and music are particularly prominent, and there are some items of religion and beliefs.&lt;ref name=Kuiper91/&gt; They only reflect village life, and not the intricate civilization of the Indus cities, befitting a post-Harappan time frame.&lt;ref name=Witzel00/&gt; In particular, Indo-Aryan words for plants stem in large part from other language families,  especially from the now-lost substrate languages.&lt;ref name=Witzel09/&gt;

Mayrhofer identified a "prefixing" language as the source of many non-Indo-European words in the Rigveda, based on recurring prefixes like ''ka-'' or ''ki-'', that have been compared by Michael Witzel to the [[Munda languages|Munda]] prefix ''k-'' for designation of persons, and the plural prefix ''ki'' seen in Khasi, though he notes that in Vedic, ''k-'' also applies to items merely connected with humans and animals.&lt;ref name=Witzel99/&gt;{{rp|12}} Examples include:
* {{lang|sa|काकम्बीर}} ''kākambīra'' a certain tree
* {{lang|sa|ककर्दु}} ''kakardu'' "wooden stick"
* {{lang|sa|कपर्दिन्}} ''kapardin'' "with a hair-knot"
* {{lang|sa|कर्पास}} ''karpāsa'' "cotton"
* {{lang|sa|कवन्ध}} ''kavandha'' "barrel"
* {{lang|sa|कवष}} ''kavaṣa'' "straddle-legged"
* {{lang|sa|किलास}} ''kilāsa'' "spotted, leprous"
* {{lang|sa|किमीद}} ''kimīda'' "a demon", cf. {{lang|sa|शिमिदा}} ''śimidā'' "a demoness"
* {{lang|sa|कीनाश}} ''kīnāśa'' "ploughman"
* {{lang|sa|कियम्बु}} ''kiyāmbu'' a water plant
* {{lang|sa|कुलाय}} ''kulāya'' "nest"
* {{lang|sa|कुलिश}} ''kuliśa'' "axe"
* {{lang|sa|कुमार}} ''kumāra'' "boy"
* {{lang|sa|कुलुङ्ग}} ''kuluṅga'' "antelope"
* {{lang|sa|कुरुङ्ग}} ''Kuruṅga'' name of a chieftain of the Turvaśa.

Witzel remarks that these words span all of local village life. He considers that they were drawn from the lost language of the northern Indus Civilization and its Neolithic predecessors. As they abound in Austroasiatic-like prefixes, he initially chose to call it Para-Munda, but later the Kubhā-Vipāś substrate.&lt;ref name=Witzel09/&gt;

The Indo-Europeanist and Indologist [[Paul Thieme|Thieme]] has questioned Dravidian etymologies proposed for Vedic words, for most of which he gives Indo-Aryan or Sanskrit etymologies, and has condemned what he characterizes as a misplaced "zeal for hunting up Dravidian loans in Sanskrit". [[Rahul Peter Das|Das]] even contended that there is "not a single case" in which a ''communis opinio'' has been found confirming the foreign origin of a Rigvedic word".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Rahul Peter |last=Das |title=The Hunt for Foreign Words in the {{IAST|Ṛgveda}}|journal=Indo-Iranian Journal |volume=38 |issue=3 |date=1995 |pages=207–238 |doi=10.1163/000000095790084530}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kuiper answered that charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=F. |last=Kuiper |title=On a hunt for "possible" objections |journal=Indo-Iranian Journal |volume=38 |issue=3 |date=1995 |pages=239–247 |doi=10.1163/000000095790084558}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burrow in turn has criticized the "resort to tortuous reconstructions in order to find, by hook or by crook, Indo-European explanations for Sanskrit words". Kuiper reasons that given the abundance of Indo-European comparative material — and the scarcity of Dravidian or Munda — the inability to clearly confirm whether the etymology of a Vedic word is Indo-European implies that it is not.&lt;ref name=Bryant/&gt;{{rp|86–88}}

==Lost donor languages==
[[Colin Masica]] could not find etymologies from Indo-European or Dravidian or Munda or as loans from Persian for 31 percent of agricultural and flora terms of Hindi. He proposed an origin in an unknown language "X".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Colin |last=Masica |chapter=Aryan and non-Aryan elements in North Indian agriculture|editor1-first=M. |editor1-last=Deshpande |editor2-first=P.

Southworth found only five terms which are shared with Munda, leading to his suggestion that "the presence of other ethnic groups, speaking other languages, must be assumed for the period in question".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Franklyn |last=Southworth|chapter= Lexical evidence for early contacts between Indo-Aryan and Dravidian|editor1-first=M. |editor1-last=Deshpande |editor2-first=P.

===Language of the Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC)===
Terms borrowed from an otherwise unknown language include those relating to [[cereal]]-growing and [[breadmaking]] ([[bread]], [[ploughshare]], [[seed]], [[sheaf (agriculture)|sheaf]], [[yeast]]), [[waterworks]] ([[canal]], [[water well|well]]), [[architecture]] (brick, house, pillar, wooden peg), tools or weapons  ([[axe]], club), [[textile]]s and [[garment]]s (cloak, cloth, coarse garment, [[hem]], [[Sewing needle|needle]]) and plants ([[hemp]], [[mustard plant|mustard]], [[soma (drink)|soma]] plant).&lt;ref name=Witzel05/&gt; Lubotsky pointed out that the phonological and morphological similarity of 55 loanwords in Iranian and in Sanskrit indicate that both share a common substratum, or perhaps two dialects of the same substratum. He concludes that the BMAC language of the population of the towns of Central Asia (where Indo-Iranians must have arrived in the 2nd millennium BC) and the language spoken in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] (see [[#Harappan|Harappan]] below) were intimately related.&lt;ref name=Lubotsky/&gt; However, the prevailing interpretation is that Harappan is not related, and the 55 loanwords entered Proto-Indo-Iranian during its development in the [[Sintashta culture]] in distant contact with the [[Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex]], and then many more words with the same origin enriched Old Indic as it developed among pastoralists who integrated with and perhaps ruled over the declining BMAC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=D.

===Harappan===
Witzel initially used the term "Para-Munda" to denote a hypothetical language related but not ancestral to modern [[Munda languages]], which he identified as "[[Harappan language|Harappan]]", the language of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]].&lt;ref name=Witzel99/&gt; To avoid confusion with Munda, he later opted for the term  "Kubhā-Vipāś substrate".&lt;ref name=Witzel09/&gt; He argues that the Rigveda shows signs of this hypothetical Harappan influence in the earliest level and [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] only in later levels, suggesting that speakers of Harappan were the original inhabitants of [[Punjab region|Punjab]] and that the Indo-Aryans encountered [[Dravidian people|speakers of Dravidian]] not before middle Rigvedic times.&lt;ref name=Witzel00/&gt; [[Bhadriraju Krishnamurti|Krishnamurti]] deems the evidence too meagre for this proposal. Regarding Witzel's methodology in claiming Para-Munda origins, [[Bhadriraju Krishnamurti|Krishnamurti]]  states: "The main flaw in Witzel's argument is his inability to show a large number of complete, unanalyzed words from Munda borrowed into the first phase of the ''Ṛgveda''... It would have been better if [Witzel] said we did not know the true source of 300 or so early borrowings into the ''Ṛgveda''."&lt;ref name=Krishnamurti&gt;{{cite book|first=Bhadriraju |last=Krishnamurti |title=Dravidian Languages|publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2003 |page=38 }}{{rp=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statement, however, confuses Proto-Munda and Para-Munda and neglects the several  hundred "complete, unanalyzed words" from a prefixing language, adduced by Kuiper&lt;ref name=Kuiper91/&gt; and Witzel.&lt;ref name=Witzel99/&gt;

==Living donor languages==
A concern raised in the identification of the substrate is that there is a large time gap between the comparative materials, which can be seen as a serious methodological drawback. One issue is the early geographical distribution of the South Asian languages.  It should not be assumed that the present-day northern location of [[Brahui language|Brahui]], [[Kurukh language|Kurukh]], and [[Malto language|Malto]] reflects the position of their ancestor languages at the time of Indo-Aryan development. Another problem is that modern literary languages may present a misleading picture of their prehistoric ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Hans Henrich |last=Hock |url=http://www.ciil.org/Main/Announcement/MBE_Programme/images/paper%20-%20hans.pdf |title=The Problem of Time in South Asian Convergence |series=Prof. M. B. Emeneau Centenary International Conference on South Asian Linguistics |publisher=Central Institute of Indian Languages |location=Mysore |accessdate=2007-08-02 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217033240/http://www.ciil.org/Main/Announcement/MBE_Programme/images/paper%20-%20hans.pdf |archivedate=17 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first completely intelligible, datable, and sufficiently long and complete epigraphs that might be of some use in linguistic comparison are the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] inscriptions of the [[Pallava dynasty]] of about 550, and the early Tamil Brahmi inscriptions starting in the 2nd century BC.&lt;ref name=Zvelebil&gt;{{cite book|first=Kamil |last=Zvelebil |title=Dravidian Linguistics: An Introduction|publisher=Pondicherry Institute of Linguistics and Culture|date= 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mahadevan |first=I |title=Early Tamil epigraphy from the earliest times to the sixth century A.D |location=Chennai|publisher= Cre-A|series=[[Harvard Oriental Series]] |date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly there is much less material available for comparative [[Munda languages|Munda]] and the interval in their case is at least three millennia.  However  reconstructions of Proto-Dravidian&lt;ref name=Krishnamurti/&gt; and Proto-Munda&lt;ref name=Anderson/&gt; now help in distinguishing the traits of these languages from those of Indo-European in the evaluation of substrate and loan words.

===Dravidian===
There are an estimated thirty to forty Dravidian loanwords in Vedic.&lt;ref name=MalloryAdams&gt;{{cite book|first=J. P. |last=Mallory |first2=D. Q. |last2=Adams |title= Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture |date=1997|page=308}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those for which Dravidian etymologies are certain include {{lang|sa|कुलाय}} ''kulāya'' "nest", {{lang|sa|कुल्फ}} ''kulpha'' "ankle", {{lang|sa|दण्ड}} ''{{IAST|daṇḍa}}'' "stick", {{lang|sa|कूल}} ''kūla'' "slope", {{lang|sa|बिल}} ''bila'' "hollow", {{lang|sa|खल}} ''khala'' "threshing floor".&lt;ref name=Zvelebil/&gt;{{rp|81}} However Witzel finds Dravidian loans only from the middle Rigvedic period, suggesting that linguistic contact between Indo-Aryan and Dravidian speakers only occurred as the Indo-Aryans expanded well into and beyond the [[Punjab]].&lt;ref name=Witzel99/&gt;

While [[Dravidian languages]] are primarily confined to the South of India today, there is a striking exception: [[Brahui language|Brahui]] (which is spoken in parts of [[Balochistan (region)|Baluchistan]]). It has been taken by some as the linguistic equivalent of a [[relict]] [[population]], perhaps indicating that [[Dravidian languages]] were formerly much more widespread and were supplanted by the incoming Indo-Aryan languages. Certainly some Dravidian place-names are found in now Indo-Aryan regions of central India,&lt;ref name=MalloryAdams/&gt; and possibly even as far northwest as [[Sindh]].&lt;ref name=Witzel99/&gt; However, it is now argued by Elfenbein that the Brahui could only have migrated to Balochistan from [[central India]] after 1000, because of the lack of any older Iranian (Avestan) loanwords in Brahui. The main Iranian contributor to Brahui vocabulary, Balochi, is a western [[Iranian language]] like [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]], and moved to the area from the west only around 1000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=J. H. |last=Elfenbein|title= A periplous of the 'Brahui problem'|journal=Studia Iranica |volume=16 |issue=2|date=1987 |pages=215–233 |doi=10.2143/si.16.2.2014604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted above, retroflex phonemes in early Indo-Aryan cannot identify the donor language as specifically Dravidian. Krishnamurti argues the Dravidian case for other features: "Besides, the {{IAST|Ṛg}} Veda has used the [[gerund]], not found in Avestan, with the same grammatical function as in Dravidian, as a [[nonfinite verb]] for 'incomplete' action. {{IAST|Ṛg}} Vedic language also attests the use of ''iti'' as a [[quotative]] [[clause]] complementizer." However, such features are also found in the indigenous [[Burushaski language]] of the [[Pamirs]] and cannot be attributed only to Dravidian influence on the early Rigveda.&lt;ref name=Witzel00/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Bertil |last=Tikkanen |title=The Sanskrit gerund: A synchronic, diachronic and typological analysis |journal=Studia Orientalia |volume=62 |date=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Munda===
Kuiper identified one of the donor languages to Indo-Aryan as Proto-Munda.&lt;ref name=Kuiper91/&gt; Munda linguist Gregory D. Anderson states: "It is surprising that nothing in the way of quotations from a Munda language turned up in (the hundreds and hundreds of) Sanskrit and middle-Indic texts. There is also a surprising lack of borrowings of names of plants/animal/bird, etc. into Sanskrit (Zide and Zide 1976). Much of what has been proposed for Munda words in older Indic (e.g. Kuiper 1948) has been rejected by careful analysis. Some possible Munda names have been proposed, for example, ''Savara'' (Sora) or ''Khara'', but ethnonymy is notoriously messy for the identification of language groups, and a single ethnonym may be adopted and used for linguistically rather different or entirely unrelated groups".&lt;ref name=Anderson/&gt;

'''''The Final Days''''' is a humorous [[short film]] produced by the [[White House]] to screen at the [[White House Correspondents' Association]] annual dinner in April 2000. It stars then-[[President of the United States]] [[Bill Clinton]] as himself. The film was designed by officials of the outgoing [[Clinton administration]] to neutralize media portrayals of Bill Clinton as a [[Lame duck (politics)|"lame duck"]] president by exaggerating that narrative to the point of absurdity.

==Plot==
''The Final Days'' is a comedic look at Clinton's last days in the White House as he approached lame duck status. In it, he is shown "roaming the halls of an empty White House like a lost 222-pound [100 kg] puppy in search of a purpose".&lt;ref name="ozy"/&gt;

==Production==
===Development===
The idea for the film came from Clinton's joke writer Mark Katz who had observed that a dominant media narrative in the late days of the [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000 election]] was that the incumbent president, whose [[Hillary Clinton|wife]] was campaigning for [[U.S. Senate]] while national attention was focused on the presidential contest between [[Al Gore]] and [[George W. Bush]], was "increasingly being depicted as the lonely guy minding the store".&lt;ref name="ozy"/&gt; The film was intended to subvert that narrative by establishing ownership of it.&lt;ref name="ozy"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Braswell|first1=Sean|title=Bill Clinton Bows Out in Style|url=http://www.ozy.com/flashback/bill-clinton-bows-out-in-style/31335|accessdate=February 3, 2017|work=[[OZY Media]]|date=May 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2007 analysis of rhetorical humor in American political communication, Michael Andrew Phillips-Anderson argued that the film satirized, not Clinton, but rather the media who had suggested the president had advanced to lame duck status. By showing Clinton involved in mundane tasks that would be extraordinary for a U.S. president to undertake, such as answering the White House switchboard and practicing [[origami]], the film served to erode such assertions by highlighting their absurdity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Phillips-Anderson|first1=Michael|title=A Theory of Rhetorical Humor in American Political Discourse|date=2007|publisher=[[University of Maryland]]|pages=96–101|url=http://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/7739}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The Final Days (Clinton film).webm|thumb|left|The full film.]]

===Filming===
''The Final Days'' was filmed in and around the White House. Ultimately, several sequences shot by director [[Philip Rosenthal]] were  not incorporated into the film, including one showing a [[crossword puzzle]]-playing Clinton phoning [[Vladimir Putin]] on the [[Moscow–Washington hotline]] (also known as the "red phone") to ask "what's a five-letter word for 'tasty Russian pancake'?"&lt;ref name="ew"/&gt;

The film's production was financed by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].&lt;ref name="clinton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ew"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fretts|first1=Bruce|title=Bill Clinton Goes Viral|url=http://ew.com/article/2000/05/12/bill-clinton-goes-viral/|accessdate=February 3, 2017|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=May 12, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cast==

''The Final Days'' starred [[Bill Clinton]] as himself, with cameo appearances by a number of journalists and [[U.S. government]] officials, including: [[Helen Thomas]], [[Madeleine Albright]], [[Sam Donaldson]], and Al Gore. [[Kevin Spacey]] also makes a brief appearance, as himself, retrieving the [[Academy Award]] he won at that year's Oscars for Best Actor (in the film ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]'') from Clinton. Commercial actor [[Mike Maronna]] plays the character "Stuart", a fictional White House staff member.&lt;ref name="ew"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Clinton's 'Oscar' win slammed by Academy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/aug/16/news.clinton|accessdate=February 3, 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=August 16, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
The film's debuted at the White House Correspondents' Dinner held at the [[Washington Hilton]] on April 29, 2000.&lt;ref name="clinton"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Final Days White House Correspondents' Dinner Skit|url=https://clinton.presidentiallibraries.us/items/show/16131|website=Clinton Digital Library|publisher=[[Clinton Presidential Center]]|accessdate=February 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2000 White House Correspondents' Dinner|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?156839-1/2000-white-house-correspondents-dinner|website=C-SPAN|publisher=[[C-SPAN]]|accessdate=February 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''The Final Days'' was well received by those attending the dinner. It was downloaded more than 200,000 times in the week following its debut, described by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' as having gone "[[viral video|viral]]".&lt;ref name="ew"/&gt;&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peterson|first1=Russell|title=Strange Bedfellows: How Late-Night Comedy Turns Democracy into a Joke|date=2008|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=0813544769|page=182|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SG87pjG9E44C&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|[[Streaming video]] services had not been widely adopted by 2000, meaning most viewers had to download the film in its entirety in order to watch it.}}

Some criticized the film, however. Susan Silver, a staff writer for ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' and ''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]'', predicted that, as a result of the film's success, future presidents would be judged by voters on their ability to deliver a "laugh riot" rather than on substantive policy positions.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;

'''Theology Digest''' (1953–2010) summarized selected recent articles from over 400 [[List of theological journals|theological journals]]. Some were in the form of formal summaries, approved by the authors of the articles, while some were briefer abstracts for whose accuracy the editors assumed responsibility. 
 
The digest was published quarterly.  In each year, three issues contained the abstracts and summaries, and the fourth contained selected lectures from the series of [[Bellarmine Lectures]] and elsewhere. All issues contained a book survey as well, covering over 200 books per issue. 

The  Digest was founded by Cyril A. Vollert, S.J., and Gerald F. Van Ackeren, S.J.,  at the Jesuit divinity school, [[St. Mary's College, Kansas|St. Mary's College]] in Kansas in 1953, but those of other denominations became involved as well.  

Theology Digest was based at Saint Louis University from 1967 until 2010.

'''Traditional medicine''' (also known as '''indigenous''' or '''folk medicine''') comprises medical aspects of [[traditional knowledge]] that developed over generations within various societies before the era of modern [[medicine]]. The [[World Health Organization|World Health Organization (WHO)]] defines traditional medicine as "the sum total of the knowledge, skills, and practices based on the theories, beliefs, and experiences indigenous to different cultures, whether explicable or not, used in the maintenance of health as well as in the prevention, diagnosis, improvement or treatment of physical and mental illness".&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/traditional/definitions/en/|title=Traditional Medicine: Definitions|date=2008-12-01|accessdate=2014-04-20|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some [[Asia]]n and [[Africa]]n countries, up to 80% of the population relies on traditional medicine for their [[primary health care]] needs.  When adopted outside its traditional culture, traditional medicine is often considered a form of [[alternative medicine]].&lt;ref name = WHO/&gt;  Practices known as traditional medicines include traditional European medicine, [[traditional Chinese medicine]], [[traditional Korean medicine]], [[traditional African medicine]], [[Ayurveda]], [[Siddha medicine]], [[Unani]], [[ancient Iranian Medicine]], [[Irani Traditional medicine|Iranian (Persian)]], [[Medicine in medieval Islam|Islamic medicine]], [[Muti]], and [[Ifá]]. Scientific disciplines which study traditional medicine include [[herbalism]], [[ethnomedicine]], [[ethnobotany]], and [[medical anthropology]].

The WHO notes, however, that "inappropriate use of traditional medicines or practices can have negative or dangerous effects" and that "further research is needed to ascertain the efficacy and safety" of several of the practices and medicinal plants used by traditional medicine systems.&lt;ref name = WHO/&gt; Ultimately, the World Health Organization has implemented a nine year strategy to "support Member States in developing proactive policies and implementing action plans that will strengthen the role traditional medicine plays in keeping populations healthy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/traditional/trm_strategy14_23/en/|title=WHO traditional medicine strategy: 2014-2023|last=|first=|date=December 2013|website=The World Health Organization|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage and history==

=== Classical history ===
{{further|Medicine in ancient Greece|Medicine in ancient Rome}}
In the written record, the study of herbs dates back 5,000 years to the ancient [[Sumer]]ians, who described well-established medicinal uses for plants. In [[Ancient Egyptian medicine]], the [[Ebers papyrus]] from c. 1552 BC records a list of folk remedies and magical medical practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ebers' Papyrus|url=http://www.whonamedit.com/synd.cfm/443.html|accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Old Testament]] also mentions herb use and cultivation in regards to [[Kashrut]].

Many herbs and minerals used in Ayurveda were described by ancient Indian herbalists such as [[Charaka]] and [[Sushruta]] during the 1st millennium BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Girish Dwivedi|first=Shridhar Dwivedi|year=2007|title=History of Medicine: Sushruta – the Clinician – Teacher par Excellence|publisher=[[National Informatics Centre]]|url=http://medind.nic.in/iae/t07/i4/iaet07i4p243.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[Chinese herbology|Chinese herbal]] book was the ''[[Shennong|Shennong Bencao Jing]]'', compiled during the [[Han Dynasty]] but dating back to a much earlier date, which was later augmented as the ''[[Yaoxing Lun]]'' (''Treatise on the Nature of Medicinal Herbs'') during the [[Tang Dynasty]]. Early recognised Greek compilers of existing and current herbal knowledge include [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoras and his followers]], [[Hippocrates]], [[Aristotle]], [[Theophrastus]], [[Dioscorides]] and [[Galen]].

Roman sources included [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' and [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus|Celsus]]'s ''[[De Medicina]]''.&lt;ref name="Kay1996"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kay|first=MA|year=1996|title=Healing with plants in the American and Mexican West|isbn=0-8165-1646-4|publisher=[[University of Arizona Press]]|pages=19&amp;ndash;20|location=Tucson}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pedanius Dioscorides]] drew on and corrected earlier authors for his ''[[De Materia Medica]]'', adding much new material; the work was translated into several languages, and [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] names were added to it over the centuries.&lt;ref name="Blunt1994"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Raphael, Sandra |author2=Blunt, Wilfrid |title=The Illustrated herbal|publisher=Frances Lincoln|location=London|year=1994|pages=|isbn=0-7112-0914-6|oclc=|doi=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Latin manuscripts of ''De Materia Medica'' were combined with a Latin herbal by [[Pseudo-Apuleius|Apuleius Platonicus]] (''Herbarium Apuleii Platonici'') and were incorporated into the Anglo-Saxon [[codex]] ''Cotton Vitellius C.III''. These early Greek and Roman compilations became the backbone of European medical theory and were translated by the Persian [[Avicenna]] (Ibn Sīnā, 980&amp;ndash;1037), the Persian [[Rhazes]] (Rāzi, 865&amp;ndash;925) and the Jewish [[Maimonides]].&lt;ref name = Kay1996/&gt;

The [[Unani]] system of traditional medicine is also based on the ''Canon''.

Translations of the early Roman-Greek compilations were made into German by [[Hieronymus Bock]] whose herbal, published in 1546, was called ''Kreuter Buch''. The book was translated into [[Dutch language|Dutch]] as ''Pemptades'' by [[Rembert Dodoens]] (1517&amp;ndash;1585), and from Dutch into [[English language|English]] by [[Carolus Clusius]], (1526&amp;ndash;1609), published by [[Henry Lyte (botanist)|Henry Lyte]] in 1578 as ''A Nievve Herball''. &lt;!--many other similar herbals, all based on Dioscorides, should be discussed here--&gt; This became [[John Gerard]]'s (1545&amp;ndash;1612) ''Herball or General Hiftorie of Plantes''.&lt;ref name = Kay1996/&gt;&lt;ref name = Blunt1994/&gt;  Each new work was a compilation of existing texts with new additions.

[[Francisco Hernández de Toledo|Francisco Hernández]], physician to [[Philip II of Spain]] spent the years 1571–1577 gathering information in [[Mexico]] and then wrote ''Rerum Medicarum Novae Hispaniae Thesaurus'', many versions of which have been published including one by [[Francisco Ximénez]].

Martín de la Cruz wrote an herbal in [[Nahuatl]] which was translated into [[Latin]] by [[Juan Badiano]] as ''[[Libellus de Medicinalibus Indorum Herbis]]'' or ''Codex Barberini, Latin 241'' and given to King [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Carlos V]] of Spain in 1552.&lt;ref name="Heinrich2005"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Heinrich|first1=M|last2=Pieroni|first2=A|last3=Bremner|first3=P|year=2005|chapter=Plants as medicines|editors=Prance G &amp; Nesbitt M|isbn=0-415-92746-3|title=The Cultural history of plants|publisher=[[Routledge]]|pages=205–238}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was apparently written in haste&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://arqueologiamexicana.mx/mexico-antiguo/libellus-de-medicinalibus-indorum-herbis-librito-de-las-yerbas-medicinales-de-los|title=Libellus de Medicinalibus Indorum Herbis (Librito de las yerbas medicinales de los indios) o Códice Badiano|last=Lozoya|first=Xavier|date=2016|website=Arqueología Mexicana|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and influenced by the European occupation of the previous 30 years.

== Knowledge transmission and creation ==
Indigenous medicine is generally transmitted [[Oral tradition|orally]] through a community, family and individuals until "collected". Within a given culture, elements of indigenous medicine knowledge may be diffusely known by many, or may be gathered and applied by those in a specific role of healer such as a [[Shamanism|shaman]] or [[Midwifery|midwife]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Acharya|first=D|author2=Anshu S|year=2008|title=Indigenous Herbal Medicines: Tribal Formulations and Traditional Herbal Practices|publisher=Aavishkar Publishers|location=[[Jaipur]]|isbn=978-81-7910-252-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Three factors legitimize the role of the healer &amp;ndash; their own beliefs, the success of their actions and the beliefs of the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(00)91989-5.pdf|title=ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE: NIGERIA The role of traditional medicine|last=Maurice Mwu, Eric Gbodossou|first=|date=December 2000|website=The Lancet|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the claims of indigenous medicine become rejected by a culture, generally three types of adherents still use it &amp;ndash; those born and socialized in it who become permanent believers, temporary believers who turn to it in crisis times, and those who only believe in specific aspects, not in all of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Laguerre, Michel S.|title=Afro-Caribbean folk medicine|publisher=Bergin &amp; Garvey|location=New York|year=1987|pages=|isbn=0-89789-113-9|oclc=|doi=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=August 2008}}

== Definition and terminology ==
Traditional medicine may sometimes be considered as distinct from folk medicine, and the considered to include formalized aspects of folk medicine. Under this definition folk medicine are longstanding remedies passed on and practised by lay people. Folk medicine consists of the [[healing]] practices and ideas of body [[physiology]] and [[health]] preservation known to some in a culture, transmitted informally as general knowledge, and practiced or applied by anyone in the culture having prior experience.&lt;ref&gt;Acharya, Deepak and Shrivastava Anshu (2008): Indigenous Herbal Medicines: Tribal Formulations and Traditional Herbal Practices, Aavishkar Publishers Distributor, Jaipur- India. {{ISBN|978-81-7910-252-7}}. pp 440.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Folk medicine ===

===Home remedies===
{{More citations needed|section|date=May 2018}}
A '''home remedy''' (sometimes also referred to as a '''granny cure''') is a treatment to cure a [[disease]] or ailment that employs certain spices, vegetables, or other common items. Home remedies may or may not have [[medicinal properties]] that treat or cure the disease or ailment in question, as they are typically passed along by laypersons (which has been facilitated in recent years by the [[Internet]]). Many are merely used as a result of [[tradition]] or [[Habituation|habit]] or because they are effective in inducing the [[placebo effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/placebo-effect-a-cure-in-the-mind/|title=Placebo Effect: A Cure in the Mind|work=Scientific American|date=February–March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the more popular examples of a home remedy is the use of [[chicken soup]] to treat [[Respiratory system|respiratory]] [[infection]]s such as a cold or mild [[flu]]. Other examples of home remedies include [[duct tape]] to help with setting broken bones; and duct tape or superglue to treat [[plantar wart]]s; and [[Kogel mogel]] to treat sore throat. In earlier times, mothers were entrusted with all but serious remedies. Historic [[cookbook]]s are frequently full of remedies for [[dyspepsia]], fevers, and female complaints.&lt;ref&gt;[[Catherine Beecher|Catherine Esther Beecher]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=FEQFN3bN7xEC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=Recipes+date:0-1920&amp;num=30#PPA13,M1 Mrs. Beecher's Housekeeper and Healthkeeper] 1874.

In Chinese folk medicine, medicinal [[congee]]s (long-cooked rice soups with herbs), foods, and soups are part of treatment practices.&lt;ref&gt;''Prince Wen Hui's Cook'' Bob Flaws and Honora Wolf 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

===Safety concerns===
Although 130 countries have regulations on folk medicines, there are risks associated with the use of them. It is often assumed that because supposed medicines are herbal or natural that they are safe, but numerous precautions are associated with using herbal remedies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Js7916e/2.html|title=National Policy on Traditional Medicine and Regulation of Herbal Medicines - Report of a WHO Global Survey|publisher=World Health Organization|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of endangered species===
[[File:Slow_loris_-_dried_01.JPG|right|thumb|Sometimes traditional medicines include parts of endangered species, such as the [[slow loris]] in Southeast Asia.]]
Endangered animals, such as the [[slow loris]], are sometimes killed to make traditional medicines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Starr | first1 = C. | last2 = Nekaris | first2 = K. A.

'''Uxmal''' ([[Yucatec Maya]]: ''Óoxmáal'' {{IPA-myn|óˑʃmáˑl|}}) is an ancient Maya city of the classical period in present-day Mexico. It is considered one of the most important archaeological sites of Maya culture, along with [[Palenque]], [[Chichen Itza|Chichén]], and [[Calakmul]] in Mexico, [[Caracol]] and [[Xunantunich]] in [[Belize]], and [[Tikal]] in [[Guatemala]]. It is located in the [[Puuc|Puuc region]] and is considered one of the Maya cities most representative of the region's dominant architectural style. It has been designated a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]] in recognition of its significance.

It is located 62&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Mérida, Yucatán|Mérida]], capital of [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]] state in [[Mexico]]. Its buildings are noted for their size and decoration. Ancient roads called ''[[sacbe]]s'' connect the buildings, and also were built to other cities in the area such as Chichén Itzá in modern-day Mexico, Caracol and Xunantunich in modern-day Belize, and Tikal in modern-day Guatemala.

Its buildings are typical of the Puuc style, with smooth low walls that open on ornate friezes based on representations of typical Maya huts. These are represented by columns (representing the reeds used for the walls of the huts) and trapezoidal shapes (representing the thatched roofs). Entwined snakes and, in many cases two-headed snakes are used for masks of the rain god, ''[[Chaac]];'' its big noses represent the rays of the storms. Feathered serpents with open fangs are shown leaving from the same human beings. Also seen in some cities are the influences of the [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]], who followed the cult of ''[[Quetzalcoatl]]'' and ''[[Tlaloc]].'' These were integrated with the original elements of the Puuc tradition.

The buildings take advantage of the terrain to gain height and acquire important volumes, including the [[Pyramid of the Magician]], with five levels, and the Governor's Palace, which covers an area of more than {{convert|1200|m²|0|abbr=on}}.

== Toponymy ==
The present name seems to derive from ''Oxmal,'' meaning "three times built". This seems to refer to the site's antiquity and the times it had to rebuild. The etymology is disputed; another possibility is ''Uchmal'' which means "what is to come, the future." By tradition, this was supposed to be an "invisible city," built in one night by the magic of the dwarf king.

== Ancient history ==
[[File:Uxmal Plan.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Map of a central portion of Uxmal]]

While much work has been done at the popular tourist destination of Uxmal to consolidate and restore buildings, little in the way of serious [[archeological]] excavation and research has been done.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} The city's dates of occupation are unknown and the estimated population (about 15,000 people) is a rough guess. {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Most of the city's major construction took place while Uxmal was the capital of a Late Classic Maya state around 850-925 AD. After about 1000 AD, Toltec invaders took over, and most building ceased by 1100 AD.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

Maya chronicles say that Uxmal was founded about 500 A.D. by [[Hun Uitzil Chac Tutul Xiu]]. For generations Uxmal was ruled over by the Xiu family. It was the most powerful site in western Yucatán, and for a while, in alliance with [[Chichen Itza]], dominated all of the northern Maya area. Sometime after about 1200, no new major construction seems to have been made at Uxmal, possibly related to the fall of Uxmal's ally Chichen Itza and the shift of power in Yucatán to [[Mayapan]]. The Xiu moved their capital to [[Maní, Yucatán|Maní]], and the population of Uxmal declined.

Uxmal was dominant from 875 to 900 CE. The site appears to have been the capital of a regional state in the Puuc region from 850-950 CE. The Maya dynasty expanded their dominion over their neighbors. This prominence did not last long, as the population dispersed around 1000 CE.

After the [[Spanish conquest of Yucatán]] (in which the Xiu allied with the Spanish), early colonial documents suggest that Uxmal was still an inhabited place of some importance into the 1550s. As the Spanish did not build a town here, Uxmal was soon after largely abandoned.

The Mayan story ''The Dwarf-Wizard of Uxmal'' is set in Uxmal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=390|edition=annotated|pages=|year=1996|accessdate=May 17, 2014|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|author=Rebecca L.

== Description of the site ==
[[File:Governor's Palace, Uxmal.jpg|thumb|Governor's Palace]]
Even before the restoration work, Uxmal was in better condition than many other Maya sites.  Much was built with well-cut stones set into a core of concrete not relying on plaster to hold the building together.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} The Maya architecture here is considered{{by whom|date=September 2014}} matched only by that of [[Palenque]] in elegance and beauty. The [[Puuc]] style of Maya architecture predominates. Thanks to its good state of preservation, it is one of the few Maya cities where the casual visitor can get a good idea of how the entire ceremonial center looked in ancient times.

Some of the more noteworthy buildings include:
* '''The Governor's Palace''', a long low building atop a huge platform, with the longest façades in Pre-Columbian [[Mesoamerica]].
:With an approximate azimuth of 118°, the building is oriented to the main pyramid of Cehtzuc, a small site located nearly 5 km to the southeast. Observing from there, Venus as evening star, when reaching its maximum northerly extremes, would have set behind the northern edge of the Governor's Palace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=uaC3jrIptfMC&amp;pg=PT120&amp;lpg=PT120&amp;dq=uxmal+Cehtzuc&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=k0i7xMob3l&amp;sig=J5Pqfym81FNSVoJwxmtRaQxbmek&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjF_dWw84jVAhVIPiYKHYOJD_AQ6AEIQDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=uxmal+Cehtzuc&amp;f=false|title=Arqueoastronomía Ámerica Antigua|first=Galindo|last=Jesús|date=27 November 2009|publisher=Equipo Sirius|accessdate=5 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since these events occur every eight years, always in late April or early May, heralding the onset of the rainy season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Šprajc |first1=Ivan |title=The Venus-Rain-Maize Complex in the Mesoamerican World View: Part I |journal=Journal for the History of Astronomy |date=1993 |volume=24 |issue=1-2 |pages=17–70 |url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1993JHA....24...17S}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is significant that the decoration of the building's facade contains almost 400 Venus glyphs placed in the masks of the rain god Chac, and that there are eight bicephalic serpents above the main entrance; additionally, numerals 8 in bar-and-dot notation appear on two Chac masks at the northern corners of the palace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Šprajc |first1=Ivan |authorlink1=Governor’s Palace at Uxmal |editor1-last=Ruggles |editor1-first=Clive L.

* The '''Adivino''' (a.k.a. the [[Pyramid of the Magician]] or the Pyramid of the Dwarf), is a [[Mesoamerican pyramid|stepped pyramid]] structure, unusual among Maya structures in that its layers' outlines are oval or elliptical in shape, instead of the more common rectilinear plan.  It was a common practice in Mesoamerica to build new temple pyramids atop older ones, but here a newer pyramid was built centered slightly to the east of the older pyramid, so that on the west side the temple atop the old pyramid is preserved, with the newer temple above it. In addition, the western staircase of the pyramid is situated so that it faces the setting sun on the summer solstice.

The structure is featured in one of the best-known tales of Yucatec Maya folklore, "el enano del Uxmal" (''the dwarf of Uxmal''), which is also the basis for the structure's common name. Multiple versions of this tale are recorded. It was popularised after one of these was recounted by [[John Lloyd Stephens]] in his influential 1841 book, ''Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas, and Yucatan''. According to Stephens' version, the pyramid was magically built overnight during a series of challenges issued to a dwarf by the ''gobernador'' (ruler or king) of Uxmal. The dwarf's mother (a ''[[bruja]], or witch) arranged the trial of strength and magic to compete against the king.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens (1841, vol. II pp.423–425)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''Nunnery Quadrangle''' (a nickname given to it by the Spanish; it was a government palace) is the finest of Uxmal's several fine quadrangles of long buildings. It has elaborately carved façades on both the inside and outside faces.
* A large '''Ballcourt''' for playing the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]]. Its inscription says that it was dedicated in 901 by the ruler ''[[Chan Chak K'ak'nal Ajaw]],'' also known as Lord Chac (before the decipherment of his corresponding name [[glyphs]]).

[[File:Detail of the House of the Turtles - Uxmal by archer10 (Dennis) SLOW - 001.jpg|thumb|Detail of the "House of the Turtles"]]
A number of other temple-pyramids, quadrangles, and other monuments, some of significant size, and in varying states of preservation, are also at Uxmal. These include North Long Building, House of the Birds, House of the Turtles, Grand Pyramid, House of the Doves, and South Temple.

The majority of hieroglyphic inscriptions were on a series of stone [[stelae]] unusually grouped together on a single platform. The stelae depict the ancient rulers of the city. They show signs that they were deliberately broken and toppled in antiquity; some were re-erected and repaired.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} A further suggestion of possible war or battle is found in the remains of a wall which encircled most of the central ceremonial center.

A large raised stone pedestrian causeway links Uxmal with the site of [[Kabah, Yucatán|Kabah]], some 18&amp;nbsp;km to the south-east.  Archaeological research at the small island site of [[Uaymil]], located to the west on the [[Gulf Coast of Mexico|Gulf coast]], suggests that it may have served as a [[port]] for Uxmal and provided the site access to the circum-peninsular trade network.

== Modern history of the ruins ==
[[File:Uxmal - Luz y sonido.JPG|thumb|left|''Lights and Sound'' nightly show on Nunnery Quadrangle.]]

The site, located not far from Mérida beside a road to Campeche, has attracted many visitors since the time of Mexico's independence.  The first detailed account of the ruins was published by [[Jean Frederic Waldeck]] in 1838.  [[John Lloyd Stephens]] and [[Frederick Catherwood]] made two extended visits to Uxmal in the early 1840s, with architect/draftsman Catherwood reportedly making so many plans and drawings that they could be used to construct a duplicate of the ancient city (unfortunately most of the drawings are lost).){{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} [[Désiré Charnay]] took a series of photographs of Uxmal in 1860. Some three years later Empress [[Carlota of Mexico]] visited Uxmal; in preparation for her visit local authorities had some statues and architectural elements depicting  [[penis|phallic]] themes removed from the ancient [[façade]]s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

[[Sylvanus G. Morley]] made a map of the site in 1909 which included some previously overlooked buildings. The Mexican government's first project to protect some of the structures from risk of collapse or further decay came in 1927.  In 1930 [[Frans Blom]] led a [[Tulane University]] expedition to the site. They made plaster casts of the façades of the "Nunnery Quadrangle"; using these casts, a replica of the Quadrangle was constructed and displayed at the [[1933 World's Fair]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. The plaster replicas of the architecture were destroyed following the fair, but some of the plaster casts of Uxmal's monuments are still kept at Tulane's Middle American Research Institute.  In 1936 a Mexican government repair and consolidation program was begun under José Erosa Peniche.

Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom]] visited on 27 February 1975 for the inauguration of the site's sound &amp; light show. When the presentation reached the point where the sound system played the Maya prayer to [[Chaac]] (the Maya rain deity), a sudden torrential downpour occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.excelsior.com.mx/expresiones/2014/09/01/979278|title=Pelean por los derechos de Uxmal|author=|date=1 September 2014|website=excelsior.com.mx|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gathered dignitaries included Gaspar Antonio Xiu, a descendant of the Xiu noble Maya lineage.

Three hotels and a small museum have been built within walking distance of the ancient city.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Microbial degradation ==

Microbial biofilms have been found degrading stone buildings at Uxmal and Kabah. [[Phototrophs]] such as ''[[Xenococcus]]'' are found more often on interior walls. However stone degrading ''[[Gloeocapsa]]'' and ''[[Synechocystis]]'' were also present in large numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Phototrophic biofilms on ancient Mayan buildings in Yucatan, Mexico|journal=Current Microbiology|volume=40|year=2000|author1= Ortega-Morales O| author2= Guezennec J|author3=Hernández-Duque G|author4=Gaylarde CC|author5=Gaylarde PM|pmid=10594218|issue=2|pages=81–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Aureobasidium]]'' and ''[[Fusarium]]'' fungi species are present at Chichen Itza and Uxmal. Cyanobacteria were prevalent in the interiors of rooms with low light levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gómez-Pompa|first=Arturo|title=The Lowland Maya area: three millennia at the human-wildland interface|year=2003|publisher=Food Products Press|location=Binghamton, NY|pages=175–192|chapter=Chapter 9 / Interaction of Microorganisms with Maya Archaeological}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A {{Nihongo|'''water-dropper'''|水滴|suiteki|lead=yes|extra={{zh|t=水滴|p=shuǐdī}}}} is a small device used in East Asian calligraphy as a container designed to hold a small amount of water. In order to make ink a few drops of water are dropped onto the surface of an [[inkstone]]. By grinding an [[inkstick|inkstick into this water on the inkstone]], particles come off and mix with the water, forming ink.

Water-droppers may be made of copper, jade or other stone, or ceramic. A water-dropper has two small holes for water and air, and is designed so that only a few drops of water can fall at one time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/s/suiteki.htm suiteki　水滴] {{en icon}}; aisf.or.jp, consulted on: 2012-12-31&lt;/ref&gt;
