      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7176">{{Zoroastrianism}}
The '''airyaman ishya''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛər|i|ˌ|æ|m|ə|n|_|ˈ|ɪ|ʃ|i|ə}}; ''airyaman išya'', ''airyə̄mā išyō'') is [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrianism's]] fourth of the four [[Avestan language|Gathic Avestan]] invocations.

==Name==
The prayer is named after its opening words, ''ā airyə̄mā išyō''. In present-day Zoroastrian usage, the ''airyama'' of these opening words are considered to be an invocation of the divinity ''[[Airyaman]]'', the ''[[yazata]]'' of healing. The opening words may however have originally been an appeal to "the community" (or "tribe"),&lt;ref name="Brunner_1984_695"&gt;{{harvnb|Brunner|1984|p=695}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which would reflect the etymologically derived meaning of ''airyaman.''&lt;ref name="Boyce_1984_694_695"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1984|pp=694–695}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In relation to the other formulas==
Like the other three formulas (''[[Ahuna Vairya]]'', ''[[Ashem Vohu|Ashem vohu]]'', ''[[Yenghe hatam]]''), the ''airyaman ishya'' is in [[Avestan language|Gathic Avestan]]. While the first three formulas are located at ''Yasna'' 27.13-27.15, immediately preceding the [[Gathas]], the ''airyaman ishya'' - at ''Yasna'' 54.1 - provides the closure. Also unlike the first three, the theological exegesis of the ''airyaman ishya'' is not embedded in the ''Yasna'' liturgy itself. Like the ''yenghe hatam'', the third of the four formulas, the ''airyaman ishya'' is a prayer.&lt;ref name="Windfuhr_2001_563"&gt;{{harvnb|Windfuhr|2001|p=563}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Both it and the ''yenghe hatam'' are without the enigmatic "pronounced magical character"&lt;ref name="Humbach_1991_1"&gt;{{harvnb|Humbach|1991|p=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; of the first two formulas.

==In other scripture==
In ''[[Yasht]]'' 3.8, 11 and 15, the ''airyaman ishya'' is described as the weapon with which to put the demon (''[[daeva]]'') Taromaiti "heresy" to flight.&lt;ref name="Dhalla_1938_270"&gt;{{harvnb|Dhalla|1938|p=270}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''airyaman ishya'' is the greatest, best, fairest, most fearful, most firm most victorious, and the most healing" of all formulas (''Yasht'' 3.5&lt;ref name="Dhalla_1938_200"&gt;{{harvnb|Dhalla|1938|p=200}}.&lt;/ref&gt;)

Since its incantation was considered the most effective form of healing (''Yasht'' 3.6), the ''airyaman ishya'' was accorded special status in the religion.&lt;ref name="Brunner_1984_695"/&gt; ''Vendidad'' 20.12 notes its efficacy against "all sickness and death, all sorcerers and witches, all whores belonging to the Lie." The ''Yasna'' verse immediately following the prayer considers the ''airyaman ishya'' "the greatest uttering of ''[[asha]]''." (''Yasna'' 54.2)

Like the [[Ahuna Vairya|''ahuna vairya'']] invocation (the first of the four great formulas), the ''airyaman ishya'' is "the most excellent, the most mighty, the most efficacious, the most smiting, the most victorious, the most healing, the greatest" of the formulas. (''Yasht'' 1.1-1.3, 3.5-3.6 and 11.3&lt;ref name="Dhalla_1938_200"/&gt;) Also like the ''ahuna vairya'', the ''airyaman ishya'' has the power to elicit good thoughts, words and deeds, and so further ''asha'' and weaken the ''druj''. (''Visperad'' 24.0-2).

==In Zoroastrian tradition==
In the medieval texts of the 9th-12th century, the ''airyaman ishya'' is described to be the prayer that will be recited by the ''[[Saoshyant|saoshyans]]'' to bring about the final renovation of the world. This eschatological role is already alluded to in Avestan texts, and the concepts of ''[[asha]]'' "Truth", ''[[ashi]]'' "Recompense" and ''[[airyaman]]'' (see translation below, the three words are also etymologically related) all have an eschatological aspect.

Besides being recited (four times) during the ''[[Yasna]]'' ceremony, the prayer is also part of the ''Ashirvad'', the blessings invoked during a Zoroastrian marriage ceremony.

==Structure and content==
Helmut Humbach's transliteration reads:
{| cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"
|- 
| valign="top" |
:''ā airyə̄mā išyō (or "išiyō") rafəδrāi jaṇtū''
:''nərəbyascā nāiribyascā zaraϑuštrahē''
:''vaŋhə̄uš rafəδrāi manaŋhō''

:''yā daēnā vairīm hanāt̰ mīždəm''
:''aṣ̌ahyā yāsā aṣ̌īm''
:''yąm išyąm (or "išiyąm") ahurō masatā mazdǡ''
|}

Transliteration based on the edition of Karl F. Geldner, Avesta, the Sacred Books of the Parsis, Stuttgart, 1896:

{| cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"
|- 
| valign="top" |
:''ā airyə̄mā iš́yō rafəδrāi jaṇtū''
:''nərəbyascā nāiribyascā zaraϑuštrahē''
:''vaŋhə̄uš rafəδrāi manaŋhō''

:''yā daēnā vairīm hanāt̰ mīždəm''
:''aṣ̌ahyā yāsā aṣ̌īm''
:''yąm iš́yąm ahurō masatā mazdå''
|}

Like all Gathic Avestan verses, the prayer is altogether ambiguous and translations vary significantly.

The '''American Association of Christian Schools''' ('''AACS''') is a [[United States]] organization, based in [[East Ridge, Tennessee]], that unifies individual conservative Protestant [[Christian school]]s and statewide Christian school associations across the country for the purpose of [[educational accreditation|accreditation]], competition, and group benefits.

Members subscribe to a ''Statement of Faith'' based on [[biblical literalism]], [[creationism]], and rejection of [[ecumenism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aacs.org/statement-of-faith/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''AACS Website &gt; About Us &gt; AACS Facts &gt; History''&lt;br&gt;
"The American Association of Christian Schools began in August 1972 in Miami, Florida. Instrumental in the founding of AACS, Al Janney, president and founder of the Florida Association of Christian Schools, was president of AACS from 1972 to 1992. The first recorded AACS board meeting was held in Dallas, Texas, on November 30, 1972... During this time, the Christian school movement in the United States [grew] rapidly and [experienced] opposition. AACS provided its membership leadership, legislative protection, and high-quality educational programs.

AACS expanded services as its membership increased throughout the 1970s. In 1978 Arno (Bud) Weniger, Jr., became executive vice president and assumed responsibility for day-to-day operations, and the office was moved from Hialeah, Florida, to Normal, Illinois. The nonprofit, tax-exempt organizational status of AACS was clarified in 1980. When Gerry Carlson was promoted to executive director in 1985, AACS opened a DC-area office in Fairfax, Virginia. Under Dr. Weniger’s leadership (1978–1988), AACS continued to grow, with the number of member schools passing the 1,000 mark in 1982.

Upon Dr. Janney’s retirement in 1992, the AACS national office moved to Independence, Missouri, and Carl Herbster became president. Under his leadership (1992–2003), AACS services and schools expanded. Directed by Charles Walker, the AACS education office opened in Chattanooga, Tennessee, in 1993. The AACS legal office was established in Atlanta, Georgia, in May 1996. In 1998, AACS purchased a four-level building in the Capitol Hill Historic District within one block of the U.S. House of Representatives office buildings to house the AACS office in Washington, D.C.

In 2003, Keith Wiebe became the third president of AACS, and Charles Walker was appointed to serve as executive director. The national office was moved from Kansas City to Chattanooga, Tennessee, in September 2003. In 2009, Dr. Walker resigned as executive director and education director, and Jeff Walton became the executive director of AACS."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aacs.org/about-us/aacs-facts/history/&lt;/ref&gt;

==State associations==
The AACS includes 37 associations, each representing the AACS schools in its [[U.S. state|state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aacs.org/state-associations/ |title=AACS State Associations |access-date=2010-07-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917050532/http://aacs.org/state-associations/ |archive-date=2010-09-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public policy advocacy==
The AACS has an active [[lobbying]] program in Washington and sends periodic communications to its members providing news and recommended positions on current [[U.S. Congress|federal]] and [[State legislature (United States)|state legislative]] proposals in the areas it describes as "[[Education in the United States|education]], [[religious liberty]], [[pro-family]] issues, and [[pro-life]] issues."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aacs.org/pages.php?page_id=163 AACS Legislative Services] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013194429/http://aacs.org/pages.php?page_id=163 |date=2007-10-13 }} (accessed November 11, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Land letter===
In 2002 AACS president Carl D. Herbster was one of five [[evangelicalism|evangelical Protestant]] leaders who signed the "[[Land letter]]" to President [[George W. Bush]], outlining their [[theological]] support for a  pre-emptive [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]] as a [[just war]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://erlc.com/article/the-so-called-land-letter The so-called “Land Letter”] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127003833/http://erlc.com/article/the-so-called-land-letter |date=2007-11-27 }}, Oct 3, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aranath''' was the eighteenth [[Jain]] [[Tirthankar]] of the present half cycle of time ([[Avasarpini]]).{{sfn|Tukol|1980|p=31}} He was also the seventh [[Chakravartin]]{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1999|p=308}} and thirteenth [[Kamadeva]]. According to Jain beliefs, he was born around 16,585,000 BCE. He became a [[siddha]] i.e. a liberated soul which has destroyed all of its [[Karma in Jainism|karma]]s. Aranath was born to King Sudarshan and Queen Devi (Mitra) at [[Hastinapur]] in the [[Ikshvaku dynasty]].{{sfn|Tukol|1980|p=31}} His birth date was the tenth day of the Migsar Krishna month of the Indian calendar.

==Life==
Like all other [[Chakravartin]], he also conquered all the lands{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1999|p=308}} and went to write his name on the foothills of mountains. Seeing the names of other Chakravartin already there, he saw his ambitions dwarfed. He then renounced his throne and became an ascetic for penance.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1999|p=308}} At an age over 84,000 years he and attained [[Moksha (Jainism)|Moksha]] (liberation) on Mount [[Shikharji]].{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1999|p=308}}

== Worship ==
''Svayambhūstotra'' by ''[[Acarya Samantabhadra]]'' is the adoration of twenty-four tirthankaras. Twenty slokas ([[aphorism]]s) of ''Svayambhūstotra'' are dedicated to ''Tirthankar Aranath''.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2015|p=118-129}} One such ''sloka'' is: {{quote|O Passionless Lord Aranatha! Your physical form which is free from all vestiges of ornaments, clothes and weapons, and the embodiment of unalloyed knowledge, control of the senses, and benevolence, is a clear indication that you have vanquished all blemishes.|Svayambhustotra (18-2-12){{sfn|Vijay K.

[[File:Bwcongressbadge.jpg|right|Emblem of the Second Bahá'í World Congress]]
The '''Bahá'í World Congress''' is a large gathering of [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]] from across the world that is called irregularly by the [[Universal House of Justice]], the governing body of the Bahá'ís. There have only been two conferences of this nature; in 1963 and 1992.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Bwcongress92.jpg|thumb|260px|Second Bahá'í World Congress at the Jacob Javits Center in New York City]] --&gt;

The Second Bahá'í World Congress from November 23–26, 1992 took place in order to pay homage to the 100th anniversary of the passing of the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, [[Bahá'u'lláh]]. 30,000 Bahá'ís attended the event in the [[Jacob K. Javits Convention Center|Jacob Javits Center]] in [[New York City]], United States, for four days of commemoration in the form of music, speeches, artistic performances and social gathering.

The Congress participants represented the diversity of the Bahá'ís from over 180 different nations. The purpose of this World Congress was to "celebrate the Centenary of the inauguration of the Covenant of Bahá'u'lláh and to proclaim its aims and unifying power."

=== Program ===
The main sessions of the World Congress took place two hours each day at the Jacob Javits Center.

*Day one concentrated on the recognition of Baha'u'llah as the Promise of All Ages.
*Day two celebrated [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] as the Center of the Covenant. The program highlighted the nature of the [[Covenant of Bahá'u'lláh|Covenant]], and New York as the City of the Covenant.
*Day three covered some achievements of the Bahá'í community.
*Day four explored humanity's encounter with Bahá'u'lláh as a prelude to the culmination of the congress, a message from the Universal House of Justice.

{{Zoroastrianism}}

A '''barsom'''{{Pronunciation-needed}}&lt;!-- as IPA --&gt; is a ritual implement used by [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] priests to solemnize certain sacred ceremonies.

The word ''barsom'' derives from the [[Avestan language]] '''''baresman''''' (trisyllabic, ''{{lang|ae|bar'əs'man}}''), which is in turn a substantive of ''barez'' "to grow high."&lt;ref name="Kanga_1989_825"&gt;{{harvnb|Kanga|1989|p=825}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The later form &amp;ndash; ''barsom'' &amp;ndash; first appears in the 9th&amp;ndash;12th-century texts of Zoroastrian tradition, and remains in use to the present day.

The ''baresman'' is not related to the ''baresnum'', which is a purification ceremony. The ''baresman'' should also not be confused with the "mace", the ''varza'' (Avestan, [[Middle Persian|MP]] ''gurz''). The ''varza'' is a metal rod, about one centimer in thickness, often crowned with a bull's head.

It has been suggested that the ''baresman'' may have a [[Zagros]]ian origin.&lt;ref name="Boyce_1982_38_39"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1982|pp=38&amp;ndash;39}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{ref_label|Zagrosian|a|none}}

==Physical characteristics==

===Material===
In present-day use, the ''barsom'' is a bundle of short metal wires or rods, each about 20&amp;nbsp;cm in length&lt;ref name="Boyce_1982_38"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1982|p=38}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and made of brass or silver.

The use of metal wires or rods is a relatively recent development: Until at least the 16th century, the ''barsom'' was made of twigs or stems, and there was an elaborate ritual surrounding their collection. There is no indication in scripture or older tradition as to which plant was to be used, and ''Yasna'' 25.3 eulogizes the plant without being specific.

One indication of which plant was used comes from the 16th century, where the authors of the ''[[Rivayat]]'' epistles reprimand their Indian co-religionists for not using twigs of the [[tamarix|tamarisk]] (''R.'' 329&lt;ref name="Dhabhar_1932_327"&gt;{{harvnb|Dhabhar|1932|p=327}}.&lt;/ref&gt;). The twigs of the [[pomegranate]] tree also figure in other late sources. [[Strabo]] (XV.3.14) speaks of "a bundle of slender [[Myrtus|myrtle]] rods."

===Dimensions===
Both scripture and tradition are precise with respect to the dimensions of the twigs required. ''[[Yasna]]'' 57.5 mandates that each twig shall not exceed "the height of the knee," and ''[[Vendidad]]'' 19.19 (supported by the ''Nirangistan'') requires each rod to be at most the length of an ''aesha'' and the thickness of the width of a ''yava''. Darmesteter translates ''aesha'' as "ploughshare" and ''yava'' as barley-corn. A twig/rod was thus at most about 7&amp;nbsp;mm thick. The ''Nirangstan'' further adds that the thickness may not be less than that of a human hair.

The ''barsom'' that appears in Achaemenid and Sassanid art "was of impressive size, about {{convert|45|cm|ft|frac=2|abbr=on}} long, made up apparently of stiff straight rods."&lt;ref name="Boyce_1982_38" /&gt;

===Number===
The number of twigs/rods depends on the ritual being performed, and the ''Shayast-na Shayast'' (14.2) unambiguously states that this number must be adhered to. A recitation of the ''[[Yasna]]'' liturgy is accompanied by a bundle of 21 twigs, with two others being placed by the side of another ritual implement. The ''[[Vendidad]]'' requires 33 twigs in the bundle with two other placed as for the ''Yasna''. A recitation of the ''[[Visperad]]'' requires 35 twigs, with none left over. The number similarly varies for other rituals, all of these however only requiring between 3 and 15 twigs.

===Binding===
In present-day use, and with only one exception, the rods remain unbound. The one exception is the ''baj'' ceremony for the dead, towards the end of which the baresman bundle is bound with a strip of a leaf of a [[Date Palm]].

==Use in ritual==
In ritual, the ''barsom'' bundle is either held in the left hand, or placed across a pair of metallic stands about 20&amp;nbsp;cm in height, with one stand at each end of the bundle. These stands have a crescent-shaped brace at the top, so (also) preventing the rods from rolling off. The crescent shape gives them their name, ''mah-rui'', literally "moon-faced." ''Dadestan-i Denig'' 48.17&lt;ref name="West_1882_165"&gt;{{harvnb|West|1882|p=165}}.&lt;/ref&gt; states the stands must be of metal.

A ''barsom'' has no immediate practical purpose. At Zoroastrian ritual it represents plant creation, accompanying the other symbolic tokens that represent other facets of creation, and each of which then also represent the presence of an [[Amesha Spenta]] at the ritual. In the case of the ''barsom'', it is [[Ameretat]] "immortality." The crescent-shaped brace of the ''barsom'' stand is likewise identified with vegetation: ''[[mah]]'', the moon, is in Zoroastrian scripture and tradition the cosmogonical protector of plants and encourages their growth. "The object of holding the barsom and repeating prayers is to praise the Creator for the support accorded by nature and for the gift of the produce of the earth, which supplies the means of existence to the human and the animal world. The object of selecting the ''barsom'' from the twigs of a tree is to take it as a representative of the whole vegetable kingdom, for which benedictions and thanks to the Creator are offered, and there is further proof to show that the performance of the ''barsom'' ritual is intended to express gratitude to the Creator for His boundless gifts."&lt;ref name="Kanga_1989_826"&gt;{{harvnb|Kanga|1989|p=826}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''barsom'' is also held by a priest during the abbreviated ''Yasna'' recitation before meals. An episode of the [[Shahnameh]] recalls that when [[Yazdegerd III]] (the last Sassanid emperor, but like his forefathers, also a priest) was in hiding, his request for a ''barsom'' gave him away to the enemy.&lt;ref name="Modi_1922_280"&gt;{{harvnb|Modi|1922|p=280}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Zoroastrian tradition, the second chapter of the ''Yasna'' liturgy is named the ''Barsom Yasht''.&lt;ref name="Skaervjoe_1978_827"&gt;{{harvnb|Skjærvø|1989|p=827}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a part of the liturgy, it is not however part of the ''[[Yasht]]'' collection. In the Avesta categorization of Kellens,&lt;ref name="Kellens_1989_37"&gt;{{harvnb|Kellens|1989|p=37}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Yasna'' 2 &amp;ndash; the ''Barsom Yasht'' &amp;ndash; complements the other 7 of the first 8 ''Yasna'' chapters, the purpose of the 8-chapter set being an invitation of the divinities to the ceremony. After ''Yasna'' 1's initial invitation of [[Ahura Mazda]], the [[Amesha Spenta]]s and the remaining [[yazata|''yazata''s]], the ''baresman'' and libation are presented to them in ''Yasna'' 2.

Boris de Zirkoff was born in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]] on March 7, 1902.{{refn|group=note|In the old Russian calendar it was February 22.{{sfn|Aveline}}}} His father was Mihail Vassilyevich de Zirkoff, a Russian general.{{sfn|Theowiki}} His mother was Lydia Dmitriyevna von Hahn, who was a second cousin to [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky]].{{refn|group=note|Blavatsky's father and Zirkoff's grandfather (his mother's father) were first cousins.{{sfn|Theowiki}}}}

The [[Russian Revolution]] forced his family to flee in 1917 to Stockholm across Finland.{{sfn|Eklund}} Boris studied in some European universities, where he specialized in languages and classics.{{sfn|Rozman}}{{refn|group=note|He had a gift for languages, eventually mastering English, French, German, and Swedish, as well as the classics.{{sfn|Theowiki}}}} "At Baden-Baden in Germany, he met a Russian American, Nikolai Romanoff, and learned from him about the existence, at [[Point Loma, San Diego|Point Loma]], close San Diego in California, of the organization, named [[Theosophical Society Point Loma - Blavatskyhouse|Universal Brotherhood and Theosophical Society]]. He wrote a letter to Mrs. [[Katherine Tingley]], then head of the Society, and when she visited Europe, they met in Finland. Mrs. Tingley, who had learned that Boris was Blavatsky's relative, invited him to come to the headquarters at Point Loma and promised him all the necessary help in regard to his travel to America."{{sfn|Rozman}} He performed this journey towards the end of 1923.{{sfn|Theowiki}}

=== Blavatsky's ''Collected Writings'' ===
In 1924, while residing at the Headquarters of the Point Loma Theosophical Society, Boris resolved to compile Blavatsky's writings. This plan led to a worldwide correspondence and over 50 years of research.{{sfn|Eklund}} The first four volumes were published between 1933 and 1936 by "Rider &amp; Co." as ''The Complete Works of H. P. Blavatsky,'' however, this edition forms were destroyed during [[World War II]].{{sfn|Rozman}} These volumes were recovered only in 1966–69. Between 1950 and 1981, Boris managed to publish the first 12 volumes of Blavatsky's ''Collected Writings''.{{sfn|Writings}} "From his manuscripts for Volumes XIII and XIV the remaining numbered series were completed in 1982 and 1985. And a Cumulative Index Volume XV was then published in 1991."{{sfn|Rozman}}

From 1944 to 1981, De Zirkoff edited in [[Los Angeles]] a magazine ''Theosophia.''{{sfn|Index}} According to [[WorldCat]], Boris had written 49 works.{{refn|group=note|"Works: 49 works in 87 publications in 2 languages and 476 library holdings."{{sfn|WorldCat Identities}}}} In 1980, he was awarded the [[Tallapragada Subba Row|Subba Row]] Medal.{{sfn|Theosophy Forward}}{{sfn|Ramanujachary|1993}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4076">'''Chala''' ({{lang-uz|чала}} {{IPA-fa|tʃala|}}) is an [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]] term meaning "neither this nor that,"&lt;ref&gt;Mirovalev, Mansur "Uzbekistan's long-persecuted Bukhara Jews" Al Jazeera May 5, 2015 http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2015/04/uzbekistan-long-persecuted-bukhara-jews-150428083657675.html&lt;/ref&gt; referring to [[Bukharan Jews]] who were allegedly forcibly converted to [[Islam]] beginning in the late eighteenth century. In response, these Chala Jews outwardly practiced Islam, but secretly retained their Jewish traditions. These [[crypto-Jews]] married among themselves and lived in their own neighborhoods that bordered on existing Jewish neighborhoods. The Chala Jews carry a very similar story to the [[Marranos]] of Spain.

Chala Jews were unable to return to their true Jewish faith due to the fatal consequences associated with leaving the Islamic faith. The Islamic rulership during this period imposed a death penalty against those renouncing their Islamic faith. Therefore, it was not until the emergence of Imperial Russia, and Soviet rule that Chala Jews were able to revert to their original faith.

By the 19th century, there were Chala communities that emerged in the cities of:  [[Samarkand]], [[Khiva]], [[Kokand]], [[Margilan]], and [[Shahrisabz]]. Often, it was not until two to three generations that Chala Jews would begin to intermarry with the local Muslim population and shed any remaining Jewish traditions.

The return of the Chala to Judaism began with the [[Russian history, 1855–1892|Russian conquest of Central Asia]] in 1867. While the [[Khanate of Khiva|Khiva]] and [[Khanate of Kokand|Kokand]] khanates were incorporated into the [[Russian Turkestan|Turkestan governorate]], the [[Bukhara Khanate]] remained autonomous and continued to [[Apostasy in Islam|enforce the death penalty against those who abandoned Islam]]. As a result, many Chala Jews illegally immigrated into Russian-controlled areas, to escape the certain threat of death. Although Russian law required that these newcomers be deported back to Bukhara and face an imminent death, the deportation orders were continuously delayed, and thus many had remained as permanent non-citizens of the Russian Turkestan region. Some Chala Jews also joined merchant guilds in order to prove their economic use to the empire. Because Muslim law was retained in Bukhara for a longer period than in surrounding cities, by the time communist Soviet rule arrived in Bukhara, many members of the local Chala no longer identified themselves as Jewish, and were fully assimilated into the Muslim population.&lt;ref&gt;Kaganovich, Albert "The Muslim Jews - Chala in Central Asia" https://www.academia.edu/4749714/The_Muslim_Jews_Chala_in_Central_Asia &lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Bukharan People's Soviet Republic|installation of Soviet rule]] in 1920, the religious distinction among the population was no longer officially recognized. Nevertheless, ethnic distinctions on passports enabled many Chala Jews to continue being counted as ethnic [[Uzbeks]] and [[Tājik people|Tajiks]], rather than Jews. 

In 2000, author Mansur Surosh published a novel ''Chala ("The Outcasts")'', which describes the experiences of the chala.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tajikistan.tajnet.com/cult.html Review of Mansur Surosh's novel ''Chala'' on tajnet.com] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.kulanu.org/links/bukharan.php# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-06-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727230950/http://www.kulanu.org/links/bukharan.php# |archive-date=2011-07-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''chatra''' (from {{lang-sa|छत्र}}, meaning "umbrella"){{efn|Also '''chatraratna''' ({{lang-sa|छत्ररत्न}} "jewelled/precious parasol"}} is an auspicious symbol in [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]].

==The chatra in various traditions==
According to [[Hindu mythology]], it is the emblem of [[Varuna]], also considered an embodiment of [[kingship]]. Chatra is also a deity, [[yidam]] and [[ishta-devata]].{{Fact|date=December 2007}}  In various Dharmic traditions it is an accoutrement of [[chakravartin]]. A number of deities are depicted with chatra, and they include [[Revanta]], [[Surya]], and [[Vishnu]] (in his [[Vamana]] avatar). The chatra is cordoned amongst the symbols that approach [[universality (philosophy)|universality]] within the numerous [[:wikt:octavalent|octavalent]] suites or sets of Ashtamangala, e.g., in the [[Digambar]] [[Jain]] tradition, and the [[Vajrayana]] tradition.

In Dharmic tradition [[iconography]], [[traditional Tibetan medicine]] [[thangka]]s and [[Ayurvedic]] diagrams, the chatra is uniformly represented as the [[Sahasrara]].

In Vajrayana Buddhism, the umbrella or parasol is included in the 'Eight Auspicious Signs' or [[Ashtamangala]].

The chhatra shares a similar symbolic value to the [[baldachin]], refer image of [[Vishvakarman]].

'''''Chesed''''' ({{lang-he-n|חֶסֶד}}, also [[Romanization of Hebrew|Romanized]] ''ḥesed'') is a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word.

In its positive sense, the word is used of kindness or love between people, of piety of people towards God as well as of love or mercy of God towards humanity. It is frequently used in [[Psalms]] in the latter sense, where it is traditionally translated "lovingkindness" in [[English Bible translations|English translations]].

In [[Jewish theology]] it is likewise used of God's love for the [[Children of Israel]], and in [[Jewish ethics]] it is used for love or charity between people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Berlin |first=Adele |first2=Marc Zvi |last2=Brettler |chapter=Introduction and Annotations (Psalms) |title=The Jewish Study Bible |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |pages=1280-1446 |isbn=9780195297515 |url=https://books.google.com/books/?id=aDuy3p5QvEYC |access-date=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chesed in this latter sense of "charity" is considered a virtue on its own, and also for its contribution to ''[[tikkun olam]]'' (repairing the world). It is also considered the foundation of many religious commandments practiced by traditional Jews, especially interpersonal commandments.  

''Chesed'' is also one of the ten [[Sephirot]] on the [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] [[Tree of life (Kabbalah)|Tree of Life]]. It is given the association of [[kindness]] and [[love]], and is the first of the emotive attributes of the ''sephirot''.

==Etymology and translations==
{{wiktionary|חסד}}
{{see|Eleos}}
The root ''chasad'' has a primary meaning of "eager and ardent desire", used both in the sense "good, kind" and "shame, contempt".&lt;ref name="H2616"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?strongs=H2616&amp;t=KJV |title=Strong's H2616 - &lt;i&gt;chacad&lt;/i&gt; |work=Blue Letter Bible |access-date=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The noun ''chesed'' inherits both senses, on one hand "zeal, love, kindness towards someone" and on the other "zeal, ardour against someone; envy, reproach". In its positive is used of mutual  benevolence, mercy or pity between people, of piety of people towards God, as well as grace, favour or mercy of God towards people.&lt;ref name="H2617"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?strongs=H2617&amp;t=KJV |title=Strong's H2617 - &lt;i&gt;checed&lt;/i&gt; |work=Blue Letter Bible |access-date=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It occurs 248 times in the Hebrew Bible. In the majority of cases (149 times), the [[King James Bible]] translation is "[[mercy]]", following [[LXX]] ''[[eleos]]''. Less frequent translations are: "[[kindness]]" (40 times), "lovingkindness" (30 times), "[[wikt:goodness|goodness]]" (12 times), "kindly" (5 times), "merciful" (4 times), "favour" (3 times) and "good", "goodliness", "pity" (once each).
Only two instances of the noun in its negative sense are in the text, translated "reproach" in [[Psalm 57]]:3, and "wicked thing" in [[Holiness code|Leviticus 20]]:17.&lt;ref name="H2617" /&gt;

The translation of ''louing kindnesse'' in KJV is derived from  the [[Coverdale Bible]] of 1535. This particular translation is used exclusively of ''chesed'' used of the benign attitude of [[YHWH]] ("the {{LORD}}") or [[Elohim]] ("God") towards his chosen, primarily invoked in [[Psalms]] (23 times), but also in the prophets, four times in [[Jeremiah]], twice in [[Isaiah]] 63:7 and once in [[Hosea]] 2:19. While "lovingkindness" is now considered somewhat archaic, it is part of the traditional rendition of Psalms in [[English Bible translations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=R. Laird |last1=Harris |first2=Gleason L. |last2=Archer, Jr. |first3=Bruce K. |last3=Waltke |title=Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament |volume=1 |page=307 |chapter=hesed |quote=[Although] The word ‘lovingkindness’…is archaic, [it is] not far from the fullness of meaning of the word [chesed or hesed].}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Yudit Kornberg |last=Greenberg |title=Encyclopedia of Love in World Religions |volume=1 |page=268 |quote=The Hebrew hesed (plural hasadim) is usually translated as "grace" or "loving-kindness", but sometimes also as "mercy" or "love".}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some more recent translations use "steadfast love" where KJV has "lovingkindness".

The [[Septuagint]] has  ''mega [[eleos]]'' "great mercy", rendered as Latin ''[[wikt:misericordia#Latin|misericordia]]''.
As an example of the use of ''chesed'' in Psalms, consider its notable occurrence at the beginning of [[Psalm 51]] ({{lang|he| חָנֵּנִי אֱלֹהִים כְּחַסְדֶּךָ}}, lit. "be [[:wikt:חנן|favourable]] to me, [[Elohim]], [[:wikt:כ־|as]]  [[:wikt:Appendix:Hebrew_pronouns|your]] ''&lt;u&gt;chesed&lt;/u&gt;''"):
:{{lang|grc| [[Kyrie eleison|ἐλέησόν με]] ὁ θεός κατὰ τὸ &lt;u&gt;μέγα ἔλεός&lt;/u&gt; σου}} ([[LXX]])
:{{lang|la| Miserere mei, Deus, secundum &lt;u&gt;misericordiam&lt;/u&gt; tuam}} ([[Vulgate]])
:"God, haue thou merci on me; bi thi &lt;u&gt;greet merci&lt;/u&gt;." ([[Wycliffe's Bible|Wycliffe]] 1388)
:"Haue mercy vpon me (o God) after thy &lt;u&gt;goodnes&lt;/u&gt;" ([[Coverdale Bible]] 1535)
:"Haue mercie vpon mee, O God, according to thy &lt;u&gt;louing kindnesse&lt;/u&gt;" ([[KJV]] 1611)
:"Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy &lt;u&gt;lovingkindness&lt;/u&gt;" ([[KJV]] 1769, [[Revised Version|RV]] 1885, [[American Standard Version|ASV]] 1901)
:"Favour me, O God, according to Thy &lt;u&gt;kindness&lt;/u&gt;" ([[Young's Literal Translation|YLT]] 1862)
:"Have mercy on me, O God, according to thy &lt;u&gt;steadfast love&lt;/u&gt;" ([[Revised Standard Version|RSV]] 1952)
:"Have mercy on me, O God, according to your &lt;u&gt;steadfast love&lt;/u&gt;" ([[New Revised Standard Version|NRSV]] 1989)

In [[Judaism]], "[[love]]" is often used as a shorter English translation.&lt;ref&gt;Adin Steinsaltz, ''In the beginning: discourses on Chasidic thought'' p. 140.

Political theorist [[Daniel Elazar]] has suggested that "chesed" cannot easily be translated into English, but that it means something like "loving covenant obligation."&lt;ref&gt;Chesed "is the antidote to the narrow legalism that can be a problem for covenantal systems and would render them contractual rather than covenantal"
Daniel Elazar, [http://www.jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/ShowPage.asp?DBID=1&amp;LNGID=1&amp;TMID=111&amp;FID=386&amp;PID=850&amp;IID=1352 HaBrit V'HaHesed: Foundations of the Jewish System].

Co., 1963&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[compassion]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Rabbi Sidney |last=Schwarz |title=Judaism and Justice: The Jewish Passion to Repair the World |page=64 |url=https://books.google.com/books/?id=dnUTcPa3YwQC |access-date=25 October 2018 |isbn=9781580233538 |publisher=Jewish Lights Publishing |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewish ethics==
{{see|Jewish ethics}}
In traditional [[musar literature]] (ethical literature), chesed is one of the primary virtues.  The [[tannaic]] rabbi [[Simon the Just]] taught: "The world rests upon three things: Torah, service to God, and bestowing kindness" (Pirkei Avot 1:2). Chesed is here the core ethical virtue.

A statement by Rabbi Simlai in the [[Talmud]] claims that "The Torah begins with chesed and ends with chesed." This may be understood to mean that "the entire Torah is characterized by chesed, i.e. it sets forth a vision of the ideal life whose goals are behavior characterized by mercy and compassion." Alternatively, it may allude to the idea that the giving of the Torah itself is the quintessential act of chesed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Eugene |last=Korn |title=Legal Floors and Moral Ceilings: A Jewish Understanding Of Law and Ethics |year=2002 |journal=Edah Journal |url=http://www.edah.org/backend/JournalArticle/korn2_2.pdf |format=PDF |access-date=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Moses Cordovero]]'s kabbalistic treatise ''[[Tomer Devorah]]'', the following are actions undertaken in imitation of the qualities of Chesed:&lt;ref name="TomerDevorah"&gt;{{cite book |title=תומר דבורה |trans-title=The Palm Tree of Devorah |first=Rabbi Moshe |last=Cordovero |isbn=9781568710273 |publisher=Targum |year=1993 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=deB7Ov_saFIC |access-date=25 October 2018 |page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* love God so completely that one will never forsake His service for any reason
* provide a child with all the necessities of their sustenance and love the child
* [[Brit milah|circumcise]] a child
* visiting and healing the sick
* giving charity to the poor
* offering hospitality to strangers
* attending to the dead
* bringing a bride to the [[chuppah]] marriage ceremony
* making peace between a person and another human being.

A person who embodies "chesed" (חסד) is known as a "chasid" (hasid, חסיד), one who is faithful to the covenant and who goes "above and beyond that which is normally required"&lt;ref name="jcpa.org"&gt;{{cite web |first=Daniel J. |last=Elazar |url=https://www.jcpa.org/dje/books/kincon-ch1.htm |title=Covenant as the Basis of the Jewish Political Tradition |access-date=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of groups throughout Jewish history which focus on going "above and beyond" have called themselves ''[[chasidim]]''. These groups include the [[Hasideans]] of the [[Second Temple period]], the Maimonidean Hasidim of medieval Egypt and Palestine, the [[Chassidei Ashkenaz]] in medieval Europe, and the [[Hasidic movement]] which emerged in eighteenth century Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name="jcpa.org"/&gt;

===Charitable organizations===
In [[Modern Hebrew]], חסד can take the generic meaning of "charity", and a "chesed institution" in modern Judaism 
may refer to any [[charitable organization]] run by religious Jewish groups or individuals.
Charitable organizations described as "chesed institutions" include:
* ''[[Bikur cholim]]'' organizations, dedicated to visiting and caring for the sick and their relatives
* ''[[Gemach]]'' – an institution dedicated to ''gemilut chasadim'' (providing kindness), often with free loan funds or by lending or giving away particular types of items (toys, clothes, medical equipment, etc.). Such organizations are often named with an acronym of ''Gemilas chasadim'' such as [[Gemach]] or GM"CH. A community may have dozens of unique (and sometimes overlapping) Gemach organizations
* ''[[Kiruv]]'' organizations – organizations designed to increase Jewish awareness among unaffiliated Jews, which is considered a form of kindness
* ''[[Hatzolah]]'' – organizations by this name typically provide free services for emergency medical dispatch and [[ambulance]] transport ([[Emergency medical technician|EMT]]s and [[Paramedics]])
* ''[[Chevra kadisha]]'' – organizations that perform religious care for the deceased, and often provide logistical help to their families relating to autopsies, transport of the body, emergency family travel, burial, running a ''[[Shiva (Judaism)|Shiva]]'' home, and caring for mourners
* ''[[Chaverim (volunteers)|Chaverim]]'' (literally "friends") – organizations going by this name typically provide free roadside assistance and emergency help with mechanical or structural problems in private homes
* ''[[Shomrim (volunteers)|Shomrim]]'' (guardians) groups – community watch groups

==Kabbalah==
{{sefirot}}
{{Main|Sephirot}}
The first three of the ten ''sephirot'', are the attributes of the [[intellect]], while Chesed is the first ''sephira'' of the attribute of action. In the kabbalistic [[Tree of life (Kabbalah)|Tree of life]], its position is below [[Chokhmah (Kabbalah)|Chokhmah]], across from [[Gevurah (Kabbalah)|Gevurah]] and above [[Netzach (Kabbalah)|Netzach]]. It is usually given four paths. To Chokhmah, Gevurah, [[Tiphereth (Kabbalah)|Tiphereth]], and [[Netzach (Kabbalah)|Netzach]] (some Kabbalists place a path from Chesed to [[Binah (Kabbalah)|Binah]] as well.)

The ''[[Bahir]]''&lt;ref name="Bahir"&gt;{{cite book |translator-first=Aryeh |translator-last=Kaplan |translator-link=Aryeh Kaplan |year=2001 |publisher=Weiser Books |title=The Bahir: Illumination |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T2RJg8UJW_kC |access-date=25 October 2018 |isbn=9781609254933}}&lt;/ref&gt; states, "What is the fourth (utterance): The fourth is the righteousness of God, His mercies and kindness with the entire world.

The [[angel|angelic]] order of this sphere is the [[Hashmallim]], ruled by the [[Archangel]] [[Zadkiel]]. The opposing [[Qliphoth|Qliphah]] is represented by the [[demon]]ic order [[Gamchicoth]], ruled by the [[Archdemon]] [[Astaroth]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3346">The '''Devil Worship Commission'''  was a [[Kenya]] Government Commission established on 20 October 1994 by President [[Daniel arap Moi]]. The commission was tasked to look into the matter of [[Theistic Satanism|devil worship]] in Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africog.org/reports/Commissionsofinquirypaper.pdf|format=PDF|title=A study of Commissions of Inquiries in Kenya |website=Africog.org|accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Report==
The commission presented its report to the President towards the end of 1995. President Moi said it would not be made public because it contained sensitive information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nation.co.ke/News/Devil-worship-rampant-in-schools/-/1056/937562/-/100i4rw/-/index.html|title=Devil worship rampant in schools|website=Nation.co.ke|accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was however released to the Kenyan Parliament in 1999 by the then Minister of Internal Security [[Julius Sunkuli]].

The report concluded that devil worship was commonplace in Kenya and recommended establishing a special police force to investigate crimes of the occult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/412011.stm|title=BBC News - Africa - Devil worship 'widespread' in Kenya|website=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Commission's report also included numerous reports of ritual murder, human sacrifice, cannibalism, and feats of magic
allegedly done by using powers acquired through such acts. It also reported that "Satanists" had infiltrated non-indigenous religious groups and other organizations, making them "doorways" to Satanism. The Commission is no longer functioning, and the Government took no action to follow up on the report &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/pdfid/49c8be2ad.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-12-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170930222443/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/pdfid/49c8be2ad.pdf# |archive-date=2017-09-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To suffice, "The Prophet used to treat some of his wives by passing his right hand over the place of ailment and used to say, "O Allah, the lord of the people! Remove the trouble and heal the patient, for you are the healer. No healing is of any avail but yours; healing that will leave behind no ailment".32 Furthermore, medication is part of the destiny one will come across as Abu Khuzamah narrated: "I said, O Messenger of Allah, the ruqyah (divine remedies - Islamic supplication formula) that we use, the medicine we take and the prevention we seek, does all this change Allah‟s appointed destiny?

== Islamic religious context ==
{{See|Shaitan |Jinn}}
Belief in Jinns, and other supernatural beings, is widespread in the Islamic world. Jinn is an Arabic collective noun deriving from the Semitic root jnn (Arabic: جَنّ / جُنّ, ''jann''), whose primary meaning is "to hide".&lt;ref&gt;{{Quran-usc|51|56|end=56|style=nosup}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tuhfat&gt;
{{cite book
  |first=Muḥammad ibn Ayyūb|last=al-Ṭabarī
  |title=Tuḥfat al-gharā’ib
  |volume=I
}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|68}}&lt;ref name=Razi&gt;
{{cite book
  |first=Abū al-Futūḥ|last=Rāzī
  |title=Tafsīr-e rawḥ al-jenān va rūḥ al-janān
}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|193}}{{rp|341}}  Some authors interpret the word to mean, literally, "beings that are concealed from the senses". Such creatures are believed to inhabit desolate, dingy, dark places where they are feared. Jinn exist invisibly amongst humans, only detectable with the sixth sense. The jinn are subtile creatures created from ''smokeless fire'' (fire and air) thought to be able to possess animate and inanimate objects. Unlike demons, they are not necessarily evil, but own a capacity of free-will.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Joseph P. Laycock ''Spirit Possession around the World: Possession, Communion, and Demon Expulsion across Cultures'' ABC-CLIO 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-610-69590-9}} page 166&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reasons for possession===
Possession is not caused by [[Satan]],&lt;ref&gt;N. Ahmadi ''Iranian Islam: The Concept of the Individual'' Springer 1998 {{ISBN|978-0-230-37349-5}} page 79&lt;/ref&gt; who is said to be just a tempter, whispering evil suggestions into humans [[qalb|heart]], but, even though not mentioned in canonical scriptures, according to folklore by jinn, who can enter a human body physically or haunting them mentally. A possession by a jinn can happen for various reasons. [[Ibn Taymiyyah]] explained a Jinn could sometimes haunt an individual, because the person could (even unintentionally) harm the jinn; urinating or throwing hot water on it, or even killing a related jinn without even realizing it.&lt;ref&gt;ʻUmar Sulaymān Ashqar ''The World of the Jinn and Devils'' Islamic Books 1998 page 204&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source needed|date=September 2018}} In this case the jinn will try to take revenge on the person. Another cause for jinn possession is when a jinn falls in love with a human and thereupon the jinn possesses the human.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Moiz Ansari ''Islam And the Paranormal: What Does Islam Says About the Supernatural in the Light of Qur'an, Sunnah And Hadith'' iUniverse 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-595-37885-2}} page 55&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source needed|date=September 2018}} Some women have told of their experiences with jinn possession; where the jinn tried to have sexual interaction from inside their bodies.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Kelly Bulkeley, Kate Adams, Patricia M. Davis ''Dreaming in Christianity and Islam: Culture, Conflict, and Creativity''Rutgers University Press 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-813-54610-0}}  page 148&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source needed|date=September 2018}} Thirdly, it occurs when a jinn is evil and simply wants to harm a human for no specific reason, it will possess that person, if it gets the opportunity, while the human is in a very emotional state or unconsciousness.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{Better source needed|date=September 2018}} Jinn may also haunt someone in service of a sorcerer.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

===Signs of possession===
In Islamic belief, there are different signs of possession for example:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{Better source needed|date=September 2018}}

*Procrastination in doing good acts or praying
*Constant laziness
*Recurring aggression
*Loss of senses while awake
*Constant headaches
*Recurring nightmares
*Laughing while asleep
*Sleepwalking

In case of a "complete control" by the Jinn, the possessed surrender to the Jinn and the persons consciousness is subverted by it. Such a jinn is indeed absolutely evil and thereupon the acts of the person are going to be evil as well. The person will obey the commands of the jinn at anytime. In a "constant possession" the person will not act without a command by the jinn.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

According to reports of individuals who have claimed to be possessed, they've asserted that during the jinn possession their spiritual abilities, like the [[Extrasensory perception|sixth sense]], had increased.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Possession can also cause physical damage, such as inexplicable bruising or marks appearing spontaneously.&lt;ref&gt;G. Hussein Rassool ''Islamic Counselling: An Introduction to Theory and Practice'' Routledge 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-317-44125-0}} page 58&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedure ==
Recited formulas, referred to as ''Ruqyah'' are used to expel the Jinn from the body. Majority of Ruqyah are either charms or spells that are uttered or written. ''Nushrah'' refers to charms or amulets that are used.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In a typical Islamic exorcism the treated person lies down while a white-gloved therapist places a hand on their head while reciting verses from the Quran.&lt;ref name=TheBlaze/&gt;&lt;ref name=AlArabiya&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific verses from the [[Quran]] are recited, which glorify God (e.g. [[Al-Baqara 255|The Throne Verse]] (Arabic: آية الكرسي ''Ayatul Kursi'') and invoke his help. In some cases the ''[[adhan]]'' (call for daily prayers) is also read, believed to have the effect of repelling non-angelic unseen beings or the ''jinn''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The Islamic prophet Muhammad taught his followers to read the last three ''[[sura]]s'' from the Quran, [[Surat al-Ikhlas]] (The Fidelity), [[Surat al-Falaq]] (The Dawn) and [[Surat an-Nas]] (Mankind).{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

A common healing practice in classical Islam used [[music therapy|music]] to cure mental illnesses, related to jinn-possession.&lt;ref&gt;Josef W. Meri ''Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia'' Routledge 2005 {{ISBN|978-1-135-45596-5}} page 496&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=September 2018}}

=== Islamic Exorcists ===
Those who are permitted to perform exorcisms typically have other careers but possess the ability to exorcise.{{Request quotation|date=September 2018}}

===Exorcism and Islamic Law===
Prohibited techniques&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; often utilize ''[[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]]'', which is found in practices that prepare amulets or talismans. This is prohibited because ''shirk'' is the sin of practicing idolatry or polytheism i.e. the deification or worship of anyone or anything besides the singular God. Many times Qur'anic verses are added throughout the recitation when using these objects in order to 'mask' their ''shirk''. However, God believes he has provided sufficient cures in executing an exorcism, therefore exorcists should not have to rely on methods involving ''shirk''.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/08/09/the-worlds-muslims-unity-and-diversity-4-other-beliefs-and-practices/|title=Chapter 4: Other Beliefs and Practices|last=|first=|date=2012-08-09|work=Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project|access-date=2018-08-08|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20180808234348/http://www.pewforum.org/2012/08/09/the-worlds-muslims-unity-and-diversity-4-other-beliefs-and-practices/|archive-date=2018-08-08|dead-url=no|language=en-US|quote=Islamic tradition also holds that Muslims should rely on God alone to keep them safe from sorcery and malicious spirits rather than resorting to talismans, which are charms or amulets bearing symbols or precious stones believed to have magical powers, or other means of protection.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, individuals seeking exorcism should avoid magicians or soothsayers because these magical practices go against Islamic Law.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

== ''Hadith'' of the 70,000 who do not ask for ''ruqya'' and will not be brought to account ==
A ''[[hadith]]'' recorded in {{hadith-usc|bukhari|8|76|479}} states: "Seventy thousand people of my followers will enter Paradise without accounts, and they are those who do not practice Ar-Ruqya and do not see an evil omen in things, and put their trust in their Lord." [[Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya]], a [[Islamic scholar|scholar]], commented on this ''hadith'', stating: “That is because these people will enter Paradise without being called to account because of the perfection of their Tawheed, therefore he described them as people who did not ask others to perform ruqyah for them. Hence he said "and they put their trust in their Lord." Because of their complete trust in their Lord, their contentment with Him, their faith in Him, their being pleased with Him and their seeking their needs from Him, they do not ask people for anything, be it ruqyah or anything else, and they are not influenced by omens and superstitions that could prevent them from doing what they want to do, because superstition detracts from and weakens Tawheed".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Zad al-Ma'ad|last=al-Jawziyya|first=Ibn Qayyim|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=1/475|trans-title=Provisions of the Hereafter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A '''fetial''' (Latin plural '''fetiales''') was a type of priest in [[Ancient Rome]]. They formed a ''[[Collegium (ancient Rome)|collegium]]'' devoted to [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] as the patron of good faith.

The duties of the fetials included advising the [[Roman senate|senate]] on foreign affairs and international treaties, making formal proclamations of peace and of war, and confirming treaties. They also carried out the functions of traveling heralds or ambassadors (''Pater Patratus'')&lt;ref&gt; According to one source the original meaning is unclear. The term could be read "father of the fathers", referring to the fetiales, or it could be read as a father whose own father is still living.  ''Patratus'' can also be read as from the latin verb meaning to accomplish, or bring about, which could simply mean that the title meant that he was the "spokesman", the appointed father, or chosen father.  In another sense of the same verb, it could mean a father who is of great accomplishment or esteemed. ''An Etymological Dictionary of the Latin Language'', 1828, Francis Edward Jackson VALPY, pg. 324)&lt;/ref&gt;.

The first mention of the fetials by [[Livy]] occurs in the context of the [[Alba Longa#war with Rome|war between Alba Longa and Rome]], during which the Roman king [[Tullus Hostilius]] appointed M. Valerius as a fetial and Sp. Fusius as ''pater patratus'', for the purpose of binding Rome and Alba Longa by a treaty.&lt;ref&gt;Livy ''Ab Urbe Condita''  [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 1#32|I.32]].&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Livy, the ritual by which the fetials were to declare war, the ritual of ''rerum repetitio'', was introduced to Rome by [[Ancus Marcius]], borrowing on the traditions of the [[Aequi]]colae. However, he had already described the ritual actions of the fetials when recording the wars of [[Tullus Hostilius]].&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ''AUC'' [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 1#24|I.24]].&lt;/ref&gt; Thus some scholars think the mentions of the Aequi may be a misinterpretation due to a folk etymology connecting Aequi to ''aequus'', the Latin adjective for fair.  On the other hand ancient sources support the tradition that the priesthood was created under the influence of Aequian king Ferter Resus.&lt;ref&gt;Inc. Auc. ''de Praenominibus'' I apud Valerius Maximus X: "Fertorem Resium qui ius fetiale constituit"; Inc. Auc. ''de Viribus Illustribus'' V 4 apud Aurelius Victor p. 29: "(Ancus Martius) ius fetiale...ab  Aequicolis transtulit quod primus Ferter Rhesus excogitavisse"; CIL  VI 1302 from the Palatine (II-I century BC); Festus s. v. Ferctius p. 81 L; Propertius IV 105-146; Plutarch Marcellus 8. 4, Romulus 16. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Rerum repetitio''==
The ritual of ''rerum repetitio'', a request of restitution or reparations, involved the ''pater patratus''. Wearing a woolen hair-band, he was to announce Roman demands using a series of prescribed phrases, first at the enemy's frontier, then when he passes over the borders, again to the first man he meets, again on entering the enemy's gate, and again on entering the forum at the presence of local magistrates. If the demands are not met, the ''pater patratus'' declares war within 33&amp;nbsp;days and returns to Rome to await the resolution of the Roman king and senate. Once they have resolved to go to war, a fetial returns to the enemy frontier carrying a javelin with a steel or burnt tip, and dipped in blood. He declares war on the enemy, and throws the javelin into their territory.

The fetial is connected to matters of law and not directly to war, hence in his formulae he never invokes Mars, but Jupiter, Juno (or perhaps Janus) and Quirinius.

The religious relevance of the collegium or ''sodalitas'' lay in ensuring that Rome enjoyed the protection of gods in its relationships with foreign states.

This ''collegium'' was probably common to other Latin cities as Livy makes reference to the ''fetials'' of Alba.

==Etymology==
According to some scholars,&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumezil, ''La religion romaine archaïque'', 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Morani "Lat. sacer...nel lessico religioso latino" ''Aevum'' LV, 1981, pp.30-46.&lt;/ref&gt; the name derives from the noun root *''feti-'', which means 'foundation' and not 'stipulation'. It is allied to the basic religious concept of ''fas'', both being rooted in IE *''dh(e)s'', originally meaning 'to set, setting'. This root has given the verb ''facere'', 'to do, make' by a semantic shift. Both ''fetial'' and ''fas'' preserve the original sense of 'foundation' here, as in Vedic ''dhaman'', ''dhatu'' in its religious sense.

==Religious implications==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2011}}
The implications of this etymology would hint to the fact that outside their own ''ager'' Romans  felt the need for a religious, founding justification of their actions as a people toward other ones. A need was felt to go beyond the sphere of human law or right. While juridical justification was acknowledged as necessary Romans wanted to ensure the approval of what founds right and makes it possible, the [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#fas|fas]].
This attitude is testified by the ceremonies held by the ''fetials'' that confer religious value to political decisions and specifications in their dealing with foreign nations, aimed at placing the gods on the side of Rome and hence effectively entrusting to them the fate of Rome.

==Details of the operative duties of the fetials==
The ''sodalitas'' dispatched two of its members, of whom only one, called the ''pater patratus'',&lt;ref&gt;The meaning of this title is unclear; according to Plutarch it denotes "a man whose father is still alive and who has children" (Mor. IV, 62), but he confuses it with ''pater patrimus''. The word ''patratus'' may be connected to either the noun ''pater'' ("father") or the verb ''patrare'' ("to execute, bring about"). Possible translations include "one who is made father" and "the father accomplisher". See A. Strobach, ''Plutarch und die Sprachen'' (1997), 78; R.E. Mitchell, "The definition of ''patres'' and ''plebs'': an end to the struggle of the orders", in K.A. Raaflaub, ''Social struggles in archaic Rome: new perspectives on the conflict of the orders'' (2005), 128-167, esp. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; was active, while the other called ''verbenarius'' was limited in function to accompanying the ''pater patratus'' with sacred herbs (''sagmina'' of vervain) gathered on the [[Capitolium]].

We know the ceremonies and formulae of two circumstances:
(1) conclusion of a treaty and (2) request of reparations and declaration of war.

In the first circumstance the ''pater patratus'' called standersby and the gods to witness, staked the word of Rome, and vowed Rome to divine wrath if it should not abide by its word, asking for ''execratio''. Oaths were made by Jupiter Lapis (''per Iovem Lapidem''). The flintstone was believed to be a seat of Jupiter's because if struck it emitted sparks, thus being analogous to lightning.

The ceremony has two known variants. In the first one the ''pater patratus'' hits a pig with flintstone taken from the temple of [[Jupiter Feretrius]] pronouncing the ''formula'' referred by Livy;&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ''AUC'' [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 1#24|I.24.8]]: "Si prior defexit publico consilio dolo malo tum tu illo die, Jupiter, populum Romanum sic ferito ut ego hunc porcum hic hodie feriam, tantoque magis ferito quanto magis potes pollesque."&lt;/ref&gt; in the second he throws the flintstone and vows Rome to fall as the stone itself if it should fail to abide by the oath.&lt;ref&gt;Pol. 3, 25, 6-9&lt;/ref&gt;

When Rome asked for reparations for an offense or damage, the fetials were sent as ambassadors to the foreign country concerned.
If the requests borne by the ''pater patratus'' were not met, he went back to Rome after invoking Jupiter, Juno (or Janus), and Quirinus, along with the heavenly gods, the terrestrial gods, and the gods of the netherworld as witnesses of the violation of the ''ius'' and after declaring war within 30 or 33&amp;nbsp;days. When this period of time had expired he went back to the border and opened the hostilities with a magic gesture: while affirming once again the good right of Rome he threw a spear with steel point or a javelin of ''corniolum'' hardened with fire into the enemy's territory.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ''AUC'' I, 32, 5-14; Dion. Hal. 2,72, 6-8&lt;/ref&gt;

The fetials were a common institution of the Latins and of other Italic people.&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius  of Halicarnassus ''Ant. Rom.'' I 21, 1; II 72; Livy, ''AUC'' [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 1#32|I.32.4]].&lt;/ref&gt;

According to G. Dumézil, the initial contract concluded with the gods and extended through the  ''sacra'' and the ''signa'' is sufficient to justify the acts of official religious authorities (such as pontiffs and augurs) within the Roman [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#ager|''ager'']]. Actions beyond this boundary require an additional religious foundation, based not only on ''[[ius]]'' but also, on a deeper level, the ''fas'' on which ''ius'' is based. This is the task of the fetials who achieve their aim through the *''feti-'', word that as Vedic  ''dhātu'' means  ''founding''. They rely on a set of  ceremonies that bestow a religious value on the political or military decisions of the magistrates, ensuring that under any circumstance Rome has the gods on her side. Besides offering their advice on international issues to the senate or the consuls, the ''sodalitas'' dispatches two envoys (the ''pater patratus'' and the  ''verbenarius'', the last one having only the task of carrying the ''sagmina'' taken from the Capitol Hill)  to ask for the reparations, to declare war in a form that is pious and just, and lastly to conclude the peace. The god under whose protection they act and whom the ''pater patratus'' invokes is ''Iupiter Lapis'' in the rite of the conclusion of a treaty&lt;ref&gt;Livy [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 1#24|I.24.8]].&lt;/ref&gt; and in general when there an agreement is reached. If a declaration of war ensues the fetial calls as witnesses Jupiter, Juno (or Janus, correction accepted by most editors), Quirinus, the heavenly, earthly and nether gods of the violation of the ''ius'' and  declares war within thirty-three days.&lt;ref&gt;Livy [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 1#32|I.32.10]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political implications of the ''ius fetiale''==
The author of Cicero's apocryphal speech of Furius Filus and the Christian apologists blamed the Romans for craftily using the ''ius fetiale'' in order to ensure divine support for Rome in international disputes. They allege that Romans were not moved by a desire for justice in their use of the ''ius fetiale'', but rather bent its rules and made a disproportionately excessive use of its technicalities to acquire an undue advantage over other peoples with the ultimate goal of stealing their lands and riches.

[[File:Tang Wuzong.jpg|thumb|[[Emperor Wuzong of Tang]], reigned 840–846.]]
The '''Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution''' initiated by [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang China|Emperor Wuzong]] reached its height in the year 845 AD.  Among its purposes were to appropriate war funds and to cleanse China of foreign influences. As such, the persecution was directed not only towards [[Buddhism]] but also towards other religions, such as [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Nestorianism|Nestorian Christianity]], and [[Manichaeism]].

==Reasons for the Persecution==
[[Emperor Wuzong of Tang|Emperor Wuzong]]'s reasons for persecuting the Buddhist organisations and temples throughout China were economic, social, and religious.
* ''Economic reasons'': In 843 the emperor's armies won a decisive battle against the [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] tribes at the cost of almost [[National bankruptcy|bankrupting]] the country. Wuzong's solution to the financial crisis was to go after the wealth that had been accumulated in the Buddhist monasteries. Buddhism had flourished greatly during the Tang period, and its monasteries enjoyed tax-exempt status. In 845, Wuzong closed many Buddhist shrines, confiscated their property, and sent the monks and nuns home to [[Laity|lay]] life.
* ''Social reasons'': Confucian intellectuals such as [[Han Yu]] railed against Buddhism for undermining the social structure of China.  It eroded the loyalty of son to father, and subject to ruler, by encouraging people to leave their families and to become monks and nuns.  Once they had been ordained, they stopped engaging in useful economic activity such as agriculture and weaving, and became a burden that had to be supported by the work of others.  The persecution sought to return monks and nuns to the ranks of tax-paying commoners engaged in useful economic activity.&lt;ref&gt;Reischauer, p.221 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Religious reasons'':  While Wuzong saw Buddhism as a foreign religion that was harmful to Chinese society, he became a zealous follower of [[Taoism]], a faith which he regarded as native to China.  Buddhism preached the attainment of non-birth or [[Nirvana (concept)|nirvana]], which its critics equated with death, while Taoism promised immortality, a notion that increasingly captured the attention of the emperor as he grew older and less rational.&lt;ref&gt;Reischauer, p.243 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

An imperial edict of 845 stated the case against Buddhism as follows:

{{quote|Buddhist monasteries daily grew higher. Men’s strength was used up in work with plaster and wood. Men’s gain was taken up in ornaments of gold and precious stones. Imperial and family relationships were forsaken for obedience to the fees of the priests. The marital relationship was opposed by the ascetic restraints. Destructive of law, injurious to mankind, nothing is worse than this way. Moreover, if one man does not plough, others feel hunger, if one woman does not tend the silk worms, others go cold. Now in the Empire there are monks and nuns innumerable. All depend on others to plough that they may eat, on others to raise silk that they may be clad. Monasteries and Refuges (Homes of ascetics,  in Sanskrit) are beyond compute.

Beautifully ornamented; they take for themselves palaces as a dwelling.... We will repress this long-standing pestilence to its roots ... In all the Empire more than four thousand six hundred monasteries are destroyed, two hundred and sixty thousand five hundred monks and nuns are returning to the world, both (men and women) to be received as tax paying householders. Refuges and hermitages which are destroyed number more than forty thousand. We are resuming fertile land of the first grade, several tens of millions of Ch’ing (1 ching is 15.13 acres). We are receiving back as tax paying householders, male and female, one hundred and fifty thousand serfs. The aliens who hold jurisdiction over the monks and nuns show clearly that this is a foreign religion.

[[Ta Ch’in]] (Syrian) and [[Muh-hu|Muh-hu-fo]] (Zoroastrian) monks to the number of more than three thousand are compelled to return to the world, lest they confuse the customs of China. With simplified and regulated government we will achieve a unification of our manners, that in future all our youth may together return to the royal culture. We are now beginning this reformation; how long it will take we do not know.&lt;ref&gt;Philip, p.125.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Events of the Persecution==

The first phase of the persecution was one aimed at purifying or reforming the Buddhist church rather than exterminating it. Thus, the persecution began in 842 with an imperial edict providing that undesirables such as sorcerers or convicts were to be weeded out from the ranks of the Buddhist monks and nuns and were to be returned to lay life.  In addition, monks and nuns were to turn their wealth over to the government; those who wished to keep their wealth would be returned to lay life and forced to pay taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Reischauer, p.237 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  During this first phase, Confucian arguments for the reform of Buddhist institutions and the protection of society from Buddhist influence and practices were predominant.&lt;ref&gt;Reischauer, pp. 242–243.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gradually, however, the Emperor [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang|Wuzong]] became more and more impressed with the claims of Taoist fanatics, and came to develop a severe dislike for Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Reischauer, p.245.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Japanese monk [[Ennin]], who lived in China during the persecution, even suggested that the emperor had been influenced by his illicit love of a beautiful Taoist priestess.&lt;ref&gt;Reischauer, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, as time went by the emperor became more irascible and less sane in his judgments.  One of his edicts banned the use of single-wheeled wheelbarrows, since they break up "the middle of the road," an important concept of Taoism.&lt;ref&gt;Reischauer, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, in 844 the persecution moved into a second phase the objective of which was the extermination rather than the reformation of Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Reischauer, pp. 244, 253.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the report prepared by the Board of Worship, there were 4,600 monasteries, 40,000 hermitages (places of retreat), 260,500 monks and nuns. The emperor issued edicts that Buddhist temples and shrines be destroyed, that all monks (desirables as well as undesirables) be defrocked, that the property of the monasteries be confiscated, and that Buddhist paraphernalia be destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Reischauer, p.253 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  An edict providing that foreign monks be defrocked and returned to their homelands resulted in [[Ennin]]'s expulsion from China.&lt;ref&gt;Reischauer, p. 256 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; By the edict of AD 845 all the monasteries were abolished with very few exceptions. When the monasteries were broken up the images of bronze, silver or gold were to be handed over to the government.

In 846, the Emperor [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang|Wuzong]] died, perhaps on account of the elixirs of life he had been consuming. It is also possible that he was intentionally poisoned.  Shortly thereafter, his successor proclaimed a general amnesty.  The persecution was over.&lt;ref&gt;Reischauer, p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on Buddhism==

The suppression of monasteries and persecution of foreign religions were part of a reformation undertaken. The persecution lasted for twenty months—not long, but long enough to have permanent effects. Buddhism, for all its strength, never completely recovered. For centuries afterwards, it was merely a tolerated religion. The days of its greatest building, sculpture, and painting, and its most vital creative thought, were past.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

In some aspects while much of traditional Buddhist teachings were later arduously restored following Emperor Wuzong's reign, some traditional schools of thought were wiped out. This included the ancient [[Vajrayana|Esoteric school]], which barely survived through the Japanese monk [[Kūkai]], later the founder of the [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon sect]].

==Effects on other religions==

In addition to Buddhism, Wuzong persecuted other foreign religions as well. He all but destroyed [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Manichaeanism]] in China, and his persecution of the growing [[Church of the East in China|Nestorian Christian]] churches sent Nestorian Christianity into a decline, from which it did not recover until the establishment of the [[Yuan dynasty]]. The arrival of Catholic and Protestant missionaries gave new life to [[Christianity in China]]. 

It most likely led to the disappearance of Zoroastrianism.&lt;ref name="Dien2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Albert E. Dien|title=Six Dynasties Civilization|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0zp6iMZoqt0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Yan+Zhitui+Yanshi+jiaxun+jijie+Family+instructions+for+the+Yan+clan#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2007|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0-300-07404-2|page=426}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Chinese records state [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Christianity]] were regarded as [[heresy|heretical]] forms of Buddhism, and were included within the scope of the edicts. Below is from an edict concerning the two religions:

{{quote|As for the Tai-Ch’in (Syrian) and Muh-hu (Zoroastrian) forms of worship, since Buddhism has already been cast out, these heresies alone must not be allowed to survive. People belonging to these also are to be compelled to return to the world, belong again to their own districts, and become taxpayers. As for foreigners, let them be returned to their own countries, there to suffer restraint.&lt;ref&gt;Philip, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Islam was brought to China during the [[Tang dynasty]] by Arab traders, who were primarily concerned with trading and commerce. It is thought that this low profile was the reason that the 845 anti-Buddhist edict ignored Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=drPQaUGOJQIC&amp;pg=PA138&amp;dq=abu+giafar+chinese#v=onepage&amp;q=harun%20raschid%20less%20obtrusive&amp;f=false|title=Confucianism and its rivals|author=Herbert Allen Giles|accessdate=2011-12-14 |edition=|series= |volume= |date= |year=1926 |month= |publisher=Forgotten Books |location= |language= |isbn=1-60680-248-8|page=139 |quote=In7= 789 the Khalifa Harun al Raschid dispatched a mission to China, and there had been one or two less important missions in the seventh and eighth centuries; but from 879, the date of the Canton massacre, for more than three centuries to follow, we hear nothing of the Mahometans and their religion. They were not mentioned in the edict of 845, which proved such a blow to Buddhism and Nestorian Christianity – perhaps because they were less obtrusive in the propagation of their religion, a policy aided by the absence of anything like a commercial spirit in religious matters.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Herma Demosthenes Glyptothek Munich 292.jpg|thumb|200px|Herma of [[Demosthenes]] from the [[Athenian Agora]], work by Polyeuktos, c. 280 BC, [[Glyptothek]]]]
A '''herma''' ({{lang-grc|ἑρμῆς}}, pl. {{lang|grc|ἑρμαῖ}} ''hermai''),&lt;ref&gt;Anatole Bailly, ''Abrégé du dictionnaire Grec-Français'', Hachette, Paris, 1901, [https://fr.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Page:Bailly_-_Dictionnaire_Grec-Fran%C3%A7ais.djvu/367&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1 p. 361].&lt;/ref&gt; commonly in English '''herm''', is a sculpture with a head, and perhaps a torso, above a plain, usually squared lower section, on which [[Human male genitalia|male genitals]] may also be carved at the appropriate height.  The form originated in [[Ancient Greece]], and was adopted by the Romans, and revived at the Renaissance in the form of [[Term (architecture)|term figures]] and [[Atlas (architecture)|Atlantes]].

==Origin==
In the earliest times [[List of Greek mythological figures|Greek divinities]] were worshiped in the form of a heap of stones or a shapeless column of stone or wood. In many parts of Greece there were piles of stones by the sides of roads, especially at their crossings, and on the [[Boundary marker|boundaries of lands]]. The religious respect paid to such heaps of stones, especially at the meeting of roads, is shown by the custom of each passer-by throwing a stone on to the heap or anointing it with oil.&lt;ref&gt;Nicand. Ther. 150; Theophrast. Char. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Later there was the addition of a head and [[phallus]] to the column, which became quadrangular (the number 4 was sacred to [[Hermes]]).&lt;ref&gt;Paus. vii. 22. § 2; Aristoph. Plut. 1121, 1144; Hom. Od. xiv. 435, xix. 397; Athen. i. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
[[File:HermHerakles 2.jpg|alt= Herma with the head of Herakles (Hermherakles). Museum of Ancient Messene, Greece.|thumb|Herma with the head of Herakles ('''Hermherakles'''). Museum of Ancient Messene, Greece]]
In ancient Greece the statues were thought to ward off harm or evil, an [[apotropaic]] function, and were placed at crossings, country borders and boundaries as protection, in front of temples, near to tombs, outside houses, in the gymnasia, [[palaestra]]e, libraries, [[portico]]es, and public places, at the corners of streets, on high roads as sign-posts, with distances inscribed upon them.&lt;ref&gt;Brunck, Anal. 3.197, no. 234&lt;/ref&gt; Before his role as protector of merchants and travelers, [[Hermes]] was a [[Phallic saints|phallic god]], associated with fertility, luck, roads and borders. His name perhaps comes from the word '''herma''' referring to a square or rectangular pillar of stone, [[terracotta]], or bronze; a bust of Hermes' head, usually with a [[beard]],&lt;ref&gt;The image of a youthful, beardless Hermes was a development of the 5th century BCE.&lt;/ref&gt; sat on the top of the pillar, and male [[genitals]] adorned the base. The surmounting heads were not, however, confined to those of Hermes; those of other gods and heroes, and even of distinguished mortals, were of frequent occurrence. In this case a compound was formed: ''[[Hermathena]]'' (a herm of Athena), ''Hermares'' (of Ares), ''Hermherakles'' (of Herakles), ''Hermaphroditus'' (of Aphrodite—not to be confused with the son of Hermes and Aphrodite with the same name, ''[[Hermaphroditus]]'', who had the genitals of both sexes), ''[[Hermanubis]]'', ''Hermalcibiades'', and so on. In [[Athens]], where the ''hermai'' were most numerous and most venerated, they were placed outside houses as apotropes for [[good luck]].&lt;ref&gt;Thuc. 6.27; Aelian, Ael. VH 2.41; Suid. s.v. Pollux, 8.72; Athen. 10.437b&lt;/ref&gt; They would be rubbed or anointed with olive oil and adorned with garlands or [[Wreath (attire)|wreaths]].&lt;ref&gt;Theophrast. Char. 16; comp. Genesis 28.18, 22, 31.45-48&lt;/ref&gt; This superstition persists, for example the [[Porcellino]] bronze boar of Florence (and numerous others like it around the world), where the nose is shiny from being continually touched for good luck or fertility.
[[Image:AGMA Tête d'Hermès.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Archaic bearded head of [[Hermes]] from a herm, early 5th century BC]]
In Roman and [[Renaissance]] versions (''[[Terminus (god)|termini]]''), the body was often shown from the waist up.  The form was also used for portrait busts of famous public figures, especially writers like [[Socrates]] and [[Plato]]. [[Sappho]] appears on Ancient Greek herms, and anonymous female figures were often used from the Renaissance on, when herms were often attached to walls as decoration.

==Trial of Alcibiades==
In 415 BC, on a night shortly before the Athenian fleet was about to set sail for Syracuse during the [[Peloponnesian War]] (see [[Sicilian Expedition]]), all of the Athenian ''hermai'' were vandalized. This was a horribly impious act and many people believed it threatened the success of the expedition.&lt;ref&gt;Thuc. 6.27, with Grote's remarks, ch. 58, 5.146ff.; Andoc. de Myst.; Aristoph. Lys. 1094&lt;/ref&gt; Though it was never proven, the Athenians at the time believed it was the work of saboteurs, either from [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] or [[Sparta]]n sympathizers from [[Athens]] itself; one suspect was the writer [[Xenophon]].&lt;ref&gt;Introduction "A History of My Times" (Penguin Classics) Paperback – May 31, 1979 by the editor George Cawkwell. Translated from Xenophons' "Hellenica" by Rex Warner&lt;/ref&gt; Enemies of [[Alcibiades]], using the anger of the Athenians as a pretext to investigate further desecrations, accused him of other acts of impiety, including mutilations of other sacred objects and mocking performances of religious mystery ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides (2008). ''The Landmark Thucydides''. New York: [[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]], sections 6.27–28.&lt;/ref&gt; He denied the accusations and offered to stand trial, but the Athenians did not want to disrupt the expedition any further, and his opponents wanted to use his absence to incite the people against him at a time when he would not be able to defend himself.  Once he had left on the expedition, his political enemies had him charged and sentenced to death [[trial in absentia|''in absentia'']], both for the mutilation of the hermai, and the supposedly related crime of profaning the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]].

==Art and popular culture==
The [[J. Paul Getty Museum]] in Los Angeles has a large collection of Roman Herma boundary marker stones in its stored collection.

An [[Aesop's fable]] makes fun of [[The Statue of Hermes#2 Hermes and the dog|statue of Hermes]]. When a pious dog offers to 'anoint' it, the god hastily assures his worshipper that this is not necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/perry/308.htm|title=Hermes and the Dog|work=mythfolklore.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hinduism in Zimbabwe''' came with indentured servants brought by the colonial British administrators in late 19th and early 20th-century to what was then called [[British South Africa Company]] and later [[Rhodesia]].&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p10"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Constance Jones|author2=James D.

These laborers came for a fixed period irrevocable contract of exclusive servitude, with an option to either go back to India with plantation paid return fare, or stay in a local settlement after the contract ended.&lt;ref name=forceduk/&gt; Most chose to stay and continue working for a salary.&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p10"/&gt;

;Ancient and medieval history
Archaeological studies in Zimbabwe and the Swahili coast have revealed evidence that suggests that Indian traders had a small presence and sporadic interaction with the African people during the Roman Empire period (early 1st millennium CE) and thereafter, long pre-dating the European colonial era.&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p10"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alexis Catsambis|author2=Ben Ford|author3=Donny L.

;Colonial era migration
Hinduism came with indentured laborers brought to Zimbabwe, and they were a part of a global movement of workers during the colonial era, to help with plantation and mining related projects when local skilled labor was unavailable, to build infrastructure projects, establish services, retail markets and for administrative support.&lt;ref name="MittalThursby2009p87"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sushil Mittal|author2=Gene Thursby|title=Studying Hinduism: Key Concepts and Methods|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QdBFq2Ia79AC&amp;pg=PA87 |year=2009| publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-41829-9|pages=87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Knott2016p91"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kim Knott|title=Hinduism: A Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Ts6CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA91 |year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-874554-9|pages=91–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=DAVID LEVINSON|author2=KAREN CHRISTENSEN|title=Encyclopedia of Community: From the Village to the Virtual World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t1geOjQ6R0MC&amp;pg=PA592|year=2003|publisher=Sage Publications|isbn=978-0-7619-2598-9|page=592}}&lt;/ref&gt; The immigrants, some educated and skilled but mostly poor and struggling in famine prone areas of India, came to escape starvation and work in plantations owned by the Europeans.&lt;ref name="Knott2016p91"/&gt;

According to Ezra Chitando, the 19th- and early 20th-century encounters between European Christians with both Hinduism and African Traditional Religions in Zimbabwe were complex, generally demonizing and dehumanizing both Hinduism and African religions, but the Christian missionaries never totally condemn Hinduism or African religions.&lt;ref name="Koschorke2005p185"/&gt; The Christian officials identified some positive elements in both, but states Chitando, then called upon the Hindu Indian workers and local Africans to "abandon their traditions and embrace their [Christian] version of reality".&lt;ref name="Koschorke2005p185"/&gt; In contrast to Christian missionary approach, neither Hinduism nor African Traditional Religions were missionary in their approach or goals.&lt;ref name="Koschorke2005p185"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Klaus Koschorke|author2=Jens Holger Schjørring|title=African Identities and World Christianity in the Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_7Tg6LPxELEC  |year=2005|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=978-3-447-05331-0|pages=185–187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[New Testament]] (NT) there are at least three passages that refer to homosexual activity: Romans 1:26–27, 1 Corinthians 6:9–10, and 1 Timothy 1:9–10. A fourth passage, Jude 1:7, is often interpreted as referring to homosexuality. Jesus only discusses marriage in a heterosexual context when he cites the [[Book of Genesis]] during a discussion of marriage (Matthew 19:4-6 and Mark 10:6-9).

The references to 'homosexuality' itself in the New Testament hinge on the interpretation of three specific Greek words: ''arsenokoitēs'' (ἀρσενοκοίτης), ''malakos'' (μαλακός), and ''porneia'' (πορνεία) and its cognates.&lt;ref name="Berlinerblau"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The secular Bible: why nonbelievers must take religion seriously |first=Jacques |last=Berlinerblau |page=108 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sGkp3Y4PUlsC&amp;pg=PA108 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |publisher=Fortress Press |first=L.

==Homosexuality in the Pauline epistles==

===Romans 1:26-27===
[[File:PaulT.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Saint Paul writing his Epistles]]
[[Epistle to the Romans]] 1:26–27 (English Majority Text Version, EMTV):
{{cquote|For this reason [viz. idolatry], God gave them up to passions of dishonor; for even their females exchanged the natural use for that which is contrary to nature, and likewise also the males, having left the natural use of the female, were inflamed by their lust for one another, males with males, committing what is shameful, and receiving in themselves the recompense which was fitting for their error.}}

The context is Paul's mission to the gentiles, the gospel being "to the Jew first, and also to the Greek" (1:16), followed by a description of pagan idolatry in verses 1:21–25. The phrase "passions of dishonor" (KJV: "vile affections") translates {{lang|grc| πάθη ἀτιμίας}},
{{lang|grc|ἀτιμία}} ''atimia'' meaning "dishonour, ignominy, disgrace").
In the expressions "natural use" and "contrary to nature", "nature" translates φύσις, i.e. ''[[Physis]]''. The term "error" translates {{lang|grc|πλάνη}} ''planē'' (lit. "straying, wandering")

The authenticity of the passage is in doubt; several scholars since the mid-20th century have proposed their being part of a larger non-Pauline [[Interpolation (manuscripts)|interpolation]].&lt;ref&gt;Percy Neale Harrison, ''Paulines and Pastorals'' (London: Villiers Publications, 1964), 80-85; Robert Martyr Hawkins, ''The Recovery of the Historical Paul'' (Nashville, TN: Vanderbilt University Press, 1943), 79-86; Alfred Firmin Loisy, ''The Origins of the New Testament'' (New Hyde Park, NY: University Books, 1962), 250; ibid., ''The Birth of the Christian Religion'' (New Hyde Park, NY: University Books, 1962), 363 n.21; Winsome Munro, ''Authority in Paul and Peter: The Identification of a Pastoral Stratum in the Pauline Corpus and 1 Peter'', SNTSMS 45 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1983), 113; John C. O'Neill, ''Paul's Letter to the Romans'' (Harmondsworth: Penguin Books, 1975), 40-56; William O. Walker, Jr., "Romans 1.18-2.29: A Non-Pauline Interpolation?" ''New Testament Studies'' 45, no. 4 (1999): 533-52.&lt;/ref&gt;

The passage has been described by Hilborn (2002) as "the most important biblical reference for the homosexuality debate".&lt;ref name="hilborn"&gt;Hilborn, D. (2002) ''Homosexuality and Scripture''. Evangelical Alliance.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the only known specific reference in the Bible to female homosexuality. Hilborn (2002) argues that in the wider passage (Romans 1:18-32) Paul writes that the "global scope of salvation history has been made manifest not only in 'the gospel of God's Son' (cf. v.9), but also in the very 'creation of the world' (v.20)." In common with many traditional commentators, Hilborn (''op cit'') goes on to argue that condemnation of homosexual activity is derived from the "broad contours" of Paul's argument, in addition to the selective reading of individual words or phrases.

Modern English translations imply that Rom 1:26b condemns lesbian sex, while 1:27 condemns sex between men.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}  However, several early church writers clearly state that Rom 1:26b is a condemnation of men having unnatural sex with women.  Brooten cites both Anastasios and Augustine as explicitly rejecting the 'lesbian hypothesis' (p.&amp;nbsp;337).&lt;ref&gt;Brooten (1996). Love Between Women.  Univ Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt;  Hanks asserts that "not until John Chrysostom (ca 400 CE) does anyone (mis)interpret Romans 1:26 as referring to relations between two women" (p.&amp;nbsp;90).&lt;ref&gt;Hanks (2000) The Subversive Gospel.  Pilgrim Press&lt;/ref&gt; Townsley notes that other early writers, possibly including Chrysostom, reject the 'lesbian' hypothesis, specifically, Ambrosiaster, Didymus the Blind and Clement of Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;Townsley (2011) "Paul, the Goddess Religions, and Queer Sects." Journal of Biblical Literature 130:707-727.&lt;/ref&gt; Townsley goes on to specify the context of Rom 1:26-27 as the continuation of Paul's condemnation of the worship of pagan gods from earlier in the chapter, linking the 'homosexuality' implied in Rom 1:27 to the practice of temple prostitution with castrated priests of [[Cybele]], practices condemned more explicitly in the Old Testament (1 Kings 15:12, 2 Kings 23:7), the same religious group that violently attacked Paul in Ephesus, driving him from the city (Acts 19).  The implication is that the goddess religions, the castrated priests and temple prostitution had a wide impact in ancient Mediterranean culture (similar to the devadasi system in India today) so would immediately evoke an image for the 1st-century audience of non-Yahwistic religious idolatry, practices not familiar to the modern reader, which makes it easy to misinterpret these verses. On the other hand, Brooten notes that Clement of Alexandria likely interpreted Rom 1:27 as a condemnation of lesbians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brooten|first=Bernadette J.|date=1985|title=Patristic Interpretations of Romans 1:26|url=http://people.brandeis.edu/~brooten/Articles/Patrisitc_Interpretations_of_Romans_1_26.pdf|journal=Studia Patristica|volume=18.1|pages=287–288|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Boswell|Boswell]] (1980) speculated that the text does not condemn "homosexual acts by homosexuals", but rather "homosexual acts committed by heterosexual persons".&lt;ref name="boswell"&gt;Boswell, J. (1980) [https://books.google.com/books?id=v-MR5_AdG68C Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality: Gay People in Western Europe from the Beginning of the Christian Era to the Fourteenth Century]. The University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Boswell argues that the conceptual modality ([[natural laws]]) which would provide the basis for the blanket condemnation of homosexuality did not exist prior to the [[Enlightenment era]].{{Clarify|date=June 2011}}
Similarly, McNeill (1993) invokes "heterosexuals" who "abandoned heterosexuality" or "exchanged heterosexuality for homosexuality".&lt;ref name="McNeill_93"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Church and the homosexual |first=John J. |last=McNeill |pages=63–65 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UD-5Gnn87W8C&amp;pg=PA63 |year=1993 |publisher=Beacon Press |edition=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Joe Dallas|Dallas]] ({{year needed|date=December 2017}}), opposing what he sees as the "[[gay agenda]]" behind such interpretations, contends that the apostle Paul is condemning changing "the natural use into that which is against nature" (Romans 1:26-27), and to suggest that Paul is referring to "heterosexuals indulging in homosexual behavior requires unreasonable mental gymnastics".&lt;ref&gt;Dallas, J. [http://www.exodusglobalalliance.org/respondingtoprogaytheologypartiiip346.php Responding to Pro-Gay Theology, Part III: Scriptural Arguments]&lt;/ref&gt;
West ({{year needed|date=December 2017}}) argues that Paul is condemning specific types of homosexual activity (such as [[temple prostitution]] or [[pederasty]]) rather than a broader interpretation. West argues that Paul is speaking to a Gentile audience in terms that they would understand to show that "all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God" (Romans 3:23).&lt;ref&gt;Mona West [http://mccchurch.org/download/theology/homosexuality/BibleandHomosexuality.pdf The Bible and Homosexuality] Metropolitan Community Churches (MCC).&lt;/ref&gt;

A more conservative biblical interpretation contends "the most authentic reading of Rom 1:26-7 is that which sees it prohibiting homosexual activity in the most general of terms, rather than in respect of more culturally and historically specific forms of such activity".&lt;ref name="hilborn" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howard, K.

===1 Corinthians 6:9-10===
King James Version (1611): "Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind"

The phrase "abusers of themselves with mankind" translates ''arsenokoitai'' also rendered "sodomites" (YLT), or "men who have sex with men" (NIV). Paul's use of the word in 1 Corinthians is the earliest example of the term; its only other usage is in a similar list of wrongdoers given (possibly by the same author) in 1 Timothy 1:8–11.

The term rendered as "effeminate" is ''[[malakoi]]'', with a literal meaning of "soft".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=MALAKO%2FS |title=Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', entry μαλακός |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowhere else in [[Malakia#Bible|scripture]] is malakoi used to describe a person.

Amplified Version (1987): "Do you not know that the unrighteous and the wrongdoers will not inherit or have any share in the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived (misled): neither the impure and immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor those who participate in homosexuality"
Wycliffe Bible (1382): "Whether ye know not, that wicked men shall not wield the kingdom of God? Do not ye err; neither lechers, neither men that serve maumets [neither men serving to idols], neither adulterers, neither lechers against kind, neither they that do lechery with men"
--&gt;

===1 Timothy 1:9-10===

King James Version (1611): "Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine"

The term relevant to homosexuality, "that defile themselves with mankind", translates ἀρσενοκοίτης ''arsenokoitēs'', the same term for homosexuals used in 1 Corinthians.
Other translations of the term include: "them that do lechery with men" (Wycliffe 1382), "those practicing homosexuality" (NIV), "those who abuse themselves with men" (Amplified Version, 1987).

Since the nineteenth century many scholars have suggested that [[First Epistle to Timothy|First Timothy]], along with [[Second Timothy]] and [[Epistle to Titus|Titus]], are not original to Paul, but rather an unknown Christian writing some time in the late-first-to-mid-2nd century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bart Ehrman|Ehrman, Bart]]. ''The New Testament: A Historical Introduction to the Early Christian Writings''. Oxford University Press. 2003. p. 393 {{ISBN|0-19-515462-2}}&lt;br&gt;"when we come to the Pastoral epistles, there is greater scholarly unanimity. These three letters are widely regarded by scholars as non-Pauline."&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars now affirm this view.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Raymond F. ''1 &amp; 2 Timothy and Titus: A Commentary''. Westminster John Knox Press. 2004. p. 4 {{ISBN|0-664-22247-1}}&lt;br&gt;"By the end of the twentieth century New Testament scholarship was virtually unanimous in affirming that the Pastoral Epistles were written some time after Paul's death. ... As always some scholars dissent from the consensus view."&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
Other  translations of the passage include:

New International Version (NIV): "9 We also know that the law is made not for the righteous but for lawbreakers and rebels, the ungodly and sinful, the unholy and irreligious, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers, 10 for the sexually immoral, for those practicing homosexuality, for slave traders and liars and perjurers—and for whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine."

Wycliffe Bible (1382): "and witting this thing, that the law is not set to a just man, but to unjust men and not subject, to wicked men and to sinners, to cursed men and defouled, to slayers of father, and slayers of mother, to manslayers [witting this thing, that the law is not put to a just man, but to an unjust and not subject, to unpious men and sinners, to cursed men and defouled, to slayers of fathers, and slayers of mothers, to menslayers] and lechers, to them that do lechery with men, lying-mongers and forsworn, and if any other thing is contrary to the wholesome teaching."

Amplified Version (1987): "Knowing and understanding this: that the Law is not enacted for the righteous (the upright and just, who are in right standing with God), but for the lawless and unruly, for the ungodly and sinful, for the irreverent and profane, for those who strike and beat and [even] murder fathers and strike and beat and [even] murder mothers, for manslayers, [For] impure and immoral persons, those who abuse themselves with men, kidnappers, liars, perjurers--and whatever else is opposed to wholesome teaching and sound doctrine"

==Jude 1:7==

"Even as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire." ([[KJV]])

The expression of "giving themselves over to fornication" translates {{lang|grc|ἐκπορνεύσασαι}} ''ekporneusasai'', rendered as "sexual immorality" in both NIV and ESV; the phrase "going after strange flesh" is a literal translation of {{lang|grc|ἀπελθοῦσαι ὀπίσω σαρκὸς ἑτέρας}}, rendered as "perversion" in NIV and as "pursued unnatural desire" in ESV.
&lt;!--
New International Version: "In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion. They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire."
English Standard Version: "Just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities, which likewise indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desire, serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire."
--&gt;

[[Simon J. Kistemaker]] notes that the Greek phrase σαρκὸς ἑτέρας (''sarkos heteras'', "strange flesh") is often interpreted as the specific desire on the part of the Sodomites to have sexual relations with angels.
Kistemaker, however, argues that it means they were "interested in sexual relations with men."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kistemaker|first=Simon J.|author-link=Simon J. Kistemaker|title=Peter and Jude|year=1987|publisher=[[Evangelical Press]]|page=381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jesus' discussion of marriage==

In Matthew 19:3, Jesus is asked "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause?" His answer is as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;He answered, "Have you not read that the one who made them at the beginning 'made them male and female' [Genesis 1:27], and said, 'For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh' [Genesis 2:24]? So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate." (Matthew 19:4-6, NRSV translation; Mark 10:6-9 is a parallel text)&lt;/blockquote&gt;Rob Gagnon, an associate professor of New Testament studies, argues it is "obvious" that Jesus' back-to-back references to Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 show that he "presupposed a two-sex requirement for marriage" even though the question he was being asked was about a contemporary dispute about whether married couples could divorce.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. J. Gagnon, "Why the Disagreement over the Biblical Witness on Homosexual Practice?: A Response to David G. Myers and Letha Dawson Scanzoni, What God Has Joined Together?" Reformed Review 59.1 (Autumn 2005): 19-130, 56. Available online at http://www.robgagnon.net/articles/ReformedReviewArticleWhyTheDisagreement.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Leroy Huizenga, a Catholic theology professor, acknowledges the question's origin in a dispute between rabbis as to whether divorce was permissible for adultery, for "many" reasons, or for "any reason, including 'even if he find one fairer than she'", and claims Jesus' reply as meaning that Genesis trumps Moses allowing divorce in Deuteronomy. Huizenga argues that Jesus' reference to Genesis is "likely" to include the command in Genesis 1:28 to "Be fruitful and multiply." Thus for him, Jesus is affirming that marriage is a union meant to be fruitful, ideally to result in children. Huizenga says Jesus' teaching about marriage here does modify the position held by his Jewish contemporaries, but in drawing on the creation accounts it is "more radical and less permissive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dr. Leroy Huizenga |url=http://www.catholicworldreport.com/Item/2381/jesus_marriage_and_homosexuality.aspx#.UssPNvRDt8E |title=Jesus, Marriage, and Homosexuality – Catholic World Report |publisher=Catholicworldreport.com |date= |accessdate=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Words with disputed or ambiguous meanings==

===Arsenokoitēs===
The Greek word arsenokoitēs appears in 1 Corinthians 6:9 and 1 Timothy 1:10. In [[1 Corinthians]] 6:9-10 (TNIV), Paul says:
{{cquote|Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor practicing homosexuals nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.}}

The word translated as "practicing homosexuals" has been alternately rendered as "abusers of themselves with mankind" ([[King James Version]], [[21st Century King James Version]]), "sodomites" ([[Young's Literal Translation]]), or "homosexuals" ([[New American Standard Bible]]), or "men who practice homosexuality" ([[English Standard Version]]) or "those who abuse themselves with men" ([[Amplified Bible]]) or "for those who have a twisted view of sex" ([[New International Readers Version]]) or "for sexual perverts" ([[Good News Bible|Good News Translation]]) or "for abusers of themselves with men"  ([[American Standard Version]]). The original term is unknown before Paul. {{lang|grc|ἀρσενοκοίτης}} (''arsenokoitēs''), thought to mean "one who has sexual intercourse with a male" (Greek {{lang|grc|ἄῤῥην / ἄρσην}} [''arrhēn'' / ''arsēn''] "male"; {{lang|grc|κοίτης}} [''koitēs''] "bed"), rather than the normal terms from the Greek culture. Within the Bible, it only occurs in this passage and in a similar list in [[1 Timothy]] 1:9-10.

The term is thought to be either a Jewish coinage from the Greek ([[Septuagint]]) translation of Leviticus 20:13,&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|grc|καὶ ὃς ἂν κοιμηθῇ μετὰ '''ἄρσενος κοίτην''' γυναικός βδέλυγμα ἐποίησαν ἀμφότεροι θανατούσθωσαν ἔνοχοί εἰσιν}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even Paul's own coinage:&lt;ref&gt;David F. Greenberg, ''The Construction of Homosexuality'', 1990. Page 213:
:"The details of Boswell's argument have been challenged by several scholars — to this nonspecialist, persuasively.&lt;sup&gt;166&lt;/sup&gt; These challengers suggest that arsenokoites was coined in an attempt to render the awkward&lt;sup&gt;&amp;#x5b;Page 214&amp;#x5d;&lt;/sup&gt; phrasing of the Hebrew in Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 into Greek,&lt;sup&gt;167&lt;/sup&gt; or that it derives from an almost identical construction in the Septuagint translation of the Leviticus prohibitions.&lt;sup&gt;168&lt;/sup&gt; A neologism was needed precisely because the Greeks did not have a word for homosexuality, only for specific homosexual relations (pederasty) and roles&amp;nbsp;..."

:&lt;sup&gt;166&lt;/sup&gt; G. R. Edwards (1984:82), D. F. Wright (1984), Johansson (1985). The arguments are technical and cannot be summarized here.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|"If a man lies with a man (''arsenos koiten'') as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads." Leviticus 20:13}}

====Arguments against a reference to homosexual behaviour====
In contrast, [[John Boswell|Boswell]] (1980) argues that this is a term specifically created by Paul, and that given its unusual nature, the fact that Paul did not use one of the more common pagan Greek terms, and given its direct reference to the Levitical laws, it is a matter of debate whether Paul was referring generally to any person having homosexual sex, or whether (as discussed below) it referred only to anal sex of any form (cf. Elliott 2004). Other translations of the word, based on examinations of the context of its subsequent uses, include [[Dale B. Martin|Martin]]'s (1996), who argued it meant "homosexual slave trader" and Boswell's (1980) who argued it referred to "homosexual rape" or homosexual prostitutes.  Scroggs perceives it as referring to exploitative pederasty.&lt;ref name="Scroggs"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The New Testament and homosexuality: contextual background for contemporary debate |first=Robin |last=Scroggs |publisher=Fortress Press |year=1983 |pages=62–65; 106–109 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4pdeZ_MWcWIC&amp;pg=PA62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''arsenokoitai'' was rarely used in Church writings (Elliott 1994), with Townsley (2003) counting a total of 73 references. Most are ambiguous in nature,{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} although St. [[John Chrysostom]], in the 4th century, seems to use the term ''arsenokoitai'' to refer to [[pederasty]] common in the Greco-Roman culture of the time and [[Patriarch John IV of Constantinople]] in the 6th century used it to refer to anal sex: "some men even commit the sin of ''arsenokoitai'' with their wives" (Townsley 2003). Moreover, [[Hippolytus of Rome]] in his ''[[Refutation of all Heresies]]'' describes a Gnostic teaching, according to which an evil angel Naas committed adultery with [[Eve]] and ''arsenokoitēs'' with [[Adam]].&lt;ref&gt;Hippolytus. Refutation of all Heresies. [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050105.htm Book V, Ch 21]&lt;/ref&gt; The context suggests the translation of ''arsenokoitēs'' as pederasty,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Pearson, B. A. ''Ancient Gnosticism'' (Fortress Press, 2007), Ch. 6, p. 44. {{ISBN|0-8006-3258-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it might have a different meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, D. B. [http://www.clgs.org/arsenokoit%C3%A9s-and-malakos-meanings-and-consequences Arsenokoités and Malakos: Meanings and Consequences]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arguments for a reference to homosexual behaviour====
Some scholars argue against the restriction of the word to pederasty. For example, Scobie states that "there is no evidence that the term was restricted to pederasty; beyond doubt, the NT here repeats the Leviticus condemnation of all same-sex relations".&lt;ref name="scobie"&gt;Scobie, C.H.H. (2003) ''The Ways of Our God: An approach to Biblical Theology''. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co. ([https://books.google.com/books?id=rNZ_9huzTvIC Google eBook])&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Campbell writes, "it must be pointed out, first, that ''arsenokoitēs'' is a broad term that cannot be confined to specific instances of homosexual activity such as male prostitution or pederasty. This is in keeping with the term's Old Testament background where lying with a 'male' (a very general term) is proscribed, relating to every kind of male-male intercourse." Campbell (quoting from Wenham) goes on to say that, "in fact, the Old Testament bans every type of homosexual intercourse, not just male prostitution or intercourse with youths."&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, K.M. (2003) ''Marriage and Family in the Biblical World''. InterVarsity Press. ([https://books.google.com/books?id=WcyqvWfJnyYC Google eBook])&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have pointed out that the meaning of ''arsenokoitēs'' is identified by its derivation from the [[Septuagint|Greek translation of the Old Testament]], where the component words "with a man (''arsenos'') do not copulate coitus (''koites'') as with a woman" refer to homosexual conduct. For example, according to Hays, although the word ''arsenokoitēs'' appears nowhere in Greek literature prior to Paul's use of it, it is evidently a rendering into Greek of the standard rabbinic term for "one who lies with a male [as with a woman]" (Lev. 18:22; 20:13). Moreover, despite recent challenges to this interpretation, the meaning is confirmed by the evidence of ''[[Sibylline oracles|Sybilline Oracles]]'' 2.73. Paul here repeats the standard Jewish condemnation of homosexual conduct.&lt;ref&gt;Hays, R.B. (2011)  Interpretation. A Bible Commentary for Teaching &amp; Preaching. First Corinthians. Westminster John Knox Press. ([https://books.google.com/books?id=zUI53yPd-kMC Google eBook])&lt;/ref&gt; Malick (''op cit'') writes, "it is significant that of all the terms available in the Greek language, Paul chose a compound from the Septuagint that in the broadest sense described men lying with men as they would lie with women."&lt;ref name="malick" /&gt; According to Scobie, "it clearly echoes the Greek of Lev 18:22 and 20:13 in the LXX (arsen = "male," and koite = "bed"), so that arsenokoitēs literally means "one who goes to bed with a male".&lt;ref name="scobie" /&gt;

David Wright argues that the compound word refers to those who sleep with males, and denotes “‘male homosexual activity’ without qualification.”&lt;ref&gt;Wright, D.F. (1984) ''Homosexuals or Prostitutes: The Meaning of arsenokoitai (I Cor. 6:9; I Tim. 1:10)''. Vigiliae Christianae 38 (June): 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wright, D.F. (1987) ''Translating arsenokoitai I Cor. 6:9; I Tim. 1:10''. "Vigiliae Christianae 41 (December): 398.&lt;/ref&gt; Haas, reviewing the various arguments on both sides, concluded that "an examination of the biblical passages from linguistic, historical and ethical-theological perspectives fails to support the revisionist ethic and reinforces the traditional Christian teaching that homosexual practice is morally wrong."&lt;ref&gt;Haas, G. (1999) ''Hermeneutical Issues In The Use Of The Bible To Justify The Acceptance Of Homosexual Practice''. Global Journal of Classical Theology 01:2 (Feb).&lt;/ref&gt; Via also agrees ''arsenokoitēs'' refers to homosexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;'True the meaning of a compound word does not necessarily add up to the sum of its parts (Martin 119). But in this case I believe the evidence suggests that it does.', Via, 'Homosexuality and the Bible: Two Views', p. 13 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; James B. De Young presents similar arguments.&lt;ref name="deyoung" /&gt;

===Malakos===
{{main|Malakia}}
This word is translated as "male prostitutes" (TNIV), "effeminate" (NASB), or "[[catamite]]s" (TJB; in the footnotes of the NKJV), in 1 Corinthians 6:9.

====Arguments against a reference to homosexual behaviour====
The Greek word {{lang|grc|μαλακός}}; ''malakos'' carries a root meaning of soft, luxurious or dainty, but here, G. Fee argues, it is used in a much darker way, possibly referring to the more passive partner in a homosexual relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Fee, G. (1987). The First Epistle to the Corinthians.  Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; According to Scroggs (''op cit''), the word ''malakos'' in Paul’s list refers specifically to this category of person, the effeminate call-boy.&lt;ref name="Scroggs" /&gt; Others, for example Olson,&lt;ref&gt;Olson, M. (1984) Untangling the Web: A Look at What Scripture Does and Does Not Say about Homosexual Behavior. ''The Other Side'', April, pp.24-29.&lt;/ref&gt; based on previous and subsequent uses of the term, interprets ''malakos'' to mean an effeminate but not necessarily homosexual man. Olson argues that the μαλακοί in Paul’s time, "almost always referred in a negative, pejorative way to a widely despised group of people who functioned as effeminate 'call boys'."

====Arguments for a reference to homosexual behaviour====
Lexical evidence from Greek texts indicates the word was used to refer to the passive partner in a male homosexual act. For example, Malick (''op cit'') writes that a significant expression of this usage is found in a letter&lt;ref group="note"&gt;“Demophon to Ptolemaeus, greeting. Make every effort to send me the flute-player Petoüs with both the Phrygian flutes and the rest; and if any expense is necessary, pay it, and you shall recover it from me. Send me also Zenobius the effeminate [μαλακόν] with a drum and cymbals and castanets, for he is wanted by the women for the sacrifice; and let him wear as fine clothes as possible” (“Letter of Demophon to Ptolemaeus” [from mummy wrappings found in the necropolis of El-Hibeh about 245 B.C.], The Hibeh Papyri: Part I, no. 54, 200–201).&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Demophon of Athens|Demophon]], a wealthy Egyptian, to Ptolemaeus, a police official, concerning needed provisions for a coming festival.&lt;ref name="malick" /&gt; According to Ukleja, "a strong possible translation of both ''malakos'' (and ''arsenokoitēs'') is the morally loose (effeminate) who allow themselves to be used homosexually and the person who is a practicing homosexual."&lt;ref&gt;Ukleja, M. (1983) ''The Bible and Homosexuality, Part 2: Homosexuality in the New Testament''. Bibliotheca Sacra 140 (October–December 1983): 351.&lt;/ref&gt; Ukleja cites a number of classical Greek sources in support his assertion.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In classical Greek, μαλακός was also used to refer to boys and men who allowed themselves to be used homosexually. It was also applied to a man taking the female or passive role in homosexuality. Dionysius of Halicarnassus, who wrote Roman Antiquities around 7 B.C., described Aristodemus of Cumae as μαλακός because he had been “effeminate” (θηλυδρίας) as a child and had undergone the things associated with women. In classical literature the word μαλακός is sometimes applied to obviously gay persons. Lucian describes the blood of some priests he condemns for passive homosexual behavior as μαλακός. This cannot be dismissed as not indicating anything about the sexuality of the individuals in question. These were priests who spent their time seeking group sexual encounters. While there is some ambiguity with regard to μαλακός, it is not beyond reason to see the word representing the passive parties in homosexual intercourse. This is even more reasonable when it is in juxtaposition with ἀρσενοκοιτής which does imply an active homosexual role. It is interesting that in Aristotle’s Problems, a lengthy discussion of the origins of homosexual passivity, he employs the word μαλακός. In its general sense the word does mean “unrestrained,” but not without any particularly homosexual context (Ukleja, ''op cit'').&lt;/ref&gt;

The meaning of the word is not confined to male prostitutes. According to Malick (''op cit''), when ''malakos'' is employed in reference to sexual relationships of men with men, it is not a technical term for male call-boys in a pederastic setting. The term may mean effeminate with respect to boys or men who take the role of a woman in homosexual relationships.&lt;ref name="malick" /&gt; Nor is the meaning of the word confined to sexually exploited males.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;‘The terms malakoi and molles could be used broadly to refer to effeminate or unmanly men. But in specific contexts it could be used in ways similar to the more specific terms [[cinaedus|cinaedi]]  (lit., “butt-shakers”) and pathici (“those who undergo [penetration]”) to denote effeminate adult males who are biologically and/or psychologically disposed to desire penetration by men. For example, in Soranus’s work On Chronic Diseases (early 2nd century A.D.) the section on men who desire to be penetrated (4.9.131-37) is entitled “On the molles or subacti (subjugated or penetrated partners, pathics) whom the Greeks call malthakoi.” An Aristotelian text similarly refers to those who are anatomically inclined toward the receptive role as malakoi (Pseudo-Aristotle, Problems 4.26). Astrological texts that speak of males desirous of playing the penetrated female role also use the term malakoi (Ptolemy, Four Books 3.14 §172; Vettius Valens, Anthologies 2.37.54; 2.38.82; cf. Brooten, 126 n. 41, 260 n. 132). The complaint about such figures in the ancient world generally, and certainly by Philo, centers around their attempted erasure of the masculine stamp given them by God/nature, not their exploitation of others, age difference, or acts of prostitution.’, Gagnon, ‘Dale Martin and the Myth of Total Textual Indeterminacy’ (2007); http://www.robgagnon.net/DaleMartinResponse.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some theologians have argued that, when read in historical context, the Jewish [[Middle Platonism|Platonist]] philosopher [[Philo|Philo of Alexandria]] used the term in reference to [[sacred prostitution|temple prostitution]].{{refn|group=note|In the New American Bible, there is a footnote&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usccb.org/bible/1cor/6:9#54006009-c |title=1 Corinthians, Chapter 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; which reads, "''The Greek word translated as boy prostitutes may refer to catamites, i.e., boys or young men kept for purposes of prostitution, a practice not uncommon in the Greco-Roman world.'' In Greek mythology, this was the function of Ganymeade, the "cupbearer of the gods," whose Latin name was Cataminus. The term translated sodomites refers to adult males who indulged in homosexual practices with such boys.",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F0XCGyJ2YUcC&amp;lpg=PA64&amp;dq=Philo%20of%20Alexandria%20arsenokoites&amp;pg=PA68#v=snippet&amp;q=philo%20prostitution&amp;f=false |title=God Is Not a Homophobe: An Unbiased Look at Homosexuality in the Bible |author=Philo Thelos |pages=68–69 |publisher=[[Trafford Publishing]] |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; esp. "...when Philo reads the Biblical laws against homosexuality, he interprets them as a reference to the expression of that act prevailing in his day - ''pederastry'' - in both secular form and in prostitution, especially as performed by the womanized ''malakos'' [...] Young boys were commonly forced to serve as homosexual prostitutes in the gates of idol temples."}}

According to Roy Ward, ''malakos'' was used to describe an item soft to the touch, such as a soft pillow or cloth. When used negatively, the term meant faint-hearted, lacking in self-control, weak or morally weak with no link to same-gender sexual behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;"Restoring the First-century Church in the Twenty-first Century: Essays on the Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement in Honor of Don Haymes" (W. Lewis and H. Rollman, p. 98)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Porneia===
{{main article|Porneia}}
In Matthew 15: 19-20 (KJV) Jesus says:
{{cquote|For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies: These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.}}

In [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 7: 20-23 (KJV) it says:
{{cquote|And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man. For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, sexual impurities, murders, thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness: All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.}}

Whether these lists include homosexuality depends on the translation of ''porneia'' (sexual impurity). Translations of these passages generally translate ''porneia'' as fornication rather than sexual impurity (see [[Leviticus]]). Some{{Who|date=September 2011}} interpret the translation of ''porneia'' more broadly, to encompass sexual immorality in general, though there is disagreement over whether such an interpretation is supported by the writings of the [[Church Fathers]].

[[Yale University]] professor [[John Boswell]] argues that ''arsenokoitēs'' in 1 Corinthians 6:9 and 1 Timothy 1:10 refers specifically to male prostitution;&lt;ref name="boswell" /&gt; various conservative scholars have presented countering arguments.&lt;ref name="deyoung" /&gt;&lt;ref name="malick" /&gt;&lt;ref name="calvin" /&gt;

The term ''porneia'' ([[:el:Πορνεία|πορνεία]]) still means prostitution in modern Greek.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-04-30|title=Πορνεία|url=https://el.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%CE%A0%CE%BF%CF%81%CE%BD%CE%B5%CE%AF%CE%B1&amp;oldid=6378124|journal=Βικιπαίδεια|language=el}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pais===
{{further information|Healing the centurion's servant}}
[[File:JesusHealingCenturionServant.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Healing the Centurion's servant by [[Paolo Veronese]], 16th century.]]
This event is referred to in both Matthew 8:5-13 and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 7:1-10 and tells of Jesus healing a [[centurion]]'s servant. Luke 7:2 (TNIV) says: "There a centurion's servant, whom his master valued highly, was sick and about to die." The term translated from the Greek as "servant" in this verse is ''doulos''. Elsewhere in the two accounts, the term used for the ill person is ''pais'', a term that can be translated in a number of different ways including "child" (e.g., Matthew 2:16; Lk 2:43, 8:51-54 where it refers to a girl), "son" (John 4:51) or "servant" (Lk 15:26, Acts 4:25); elsewhere it is unclear whether "son" or "servant" is meant (Acts 3:13, 3:26, 4:27, 4:30).

Horner&lt;ref&gt;Horner, T. (1978) ''The Centurion's Servant''. Insight: A Quarterly of Gay Catholic Opinion, Vol. 2, No. 3 (Summer).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Daniel A. Helminiak]]&lt;ref&gt;Helminiak, D.A. (2000) ''What the Bible Really Says about Homosexuality''. Alamo Square Press.&lt;/ref&gt; both suggest a homosexual theme to this text. Helminiak argues that this is implied by the broader context of the narrative suggesting an unusual level of concern about the servant, whereas Horner suggests that use of the term "valued highly" implies a sexual relationship. Horner goes on to argue that, as Jesus commended the centurion for his faith (Matthew 8:10; Luke 7:9), it shows that Jesus approved of their relationship, otherwise he would have condemned him. However, a contrasting viewpoint is that the term “highly valued” (Greek ἔντιμος, ''entimos'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=e%29%2Fntimos&amp;la=greek&amp;can=e%29%2Fntimos0#lexicon |title=Liddell and Scott ἔντιμος |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |date= |accessdate=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; simply suggests a genuine care for the person or, more archaically, that the centurion was fond of this slave,&lt;ref&gt;[http://bible.org/netbible/luk7_notes.htm#77 Luke 7] NET Bible.&lt;/ref&gt; and that the term ''entimos'' has no hint of sexual content in any of its various appearances in the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reformed.org/social/index.html?mainframe=http://www.reformed.org/social/hodges_response_helminiak.html |title=Derrick K. Olliff and Dewey H. Hodges, "A Reformed Response to Daniel Helminiak's Gay Theology |publisher=Reformed.org |date= |accessdate=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jay Michaelson]] argues that the term ''pais'' is actually mistranslated as ''servant'' when its true meaning is ''lover''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Michaelson |first=Jay |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jay-michaelson/when-jesus-healed-a-same-sex-partner_b_1743947.html |title=When Jesus Healed a Same-Sex Partner |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=2016-02-02 |accessdate=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other biblical scholars dismiss any suggestions of a homosexual theme as deliberately distorted interpretations of the text.&lt;ref&gt;Marston, P. (1995) [https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/dear-peter-tatchell-1612117.html Dear Peter Tatchell] The Independent, Tuesday 21 March 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marston, P. (2003) ''Christians, Gays and Gay Christians''. Free Methodists.&lt;/ref&gt; Marston argues that Jesus would not have condoned any homosexual relationship, in line with the weight of other scriptural evidence, while Chapman suggests that even if the relationship had been homosexual, his lack of condemnation does not necessarily equate to his approval of them.{{sfn|Chapman|2005}}{{incomplete short citation|date=December 2016}}

==Other issues of sexuality==

===Eunuchs===
In Matthew 19:12, Jesus discusses [[eunuch]]s who were born as such, eunuchs who were made so by others, and eunuchs who choose to live as such for the kingdom of heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+19:12&amp;version=NIV |title=Matthew 19:12 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clement of Alexandria]] wrote in his commentary on it that "some men, from their birth, have a natural sense of repulsion from a woman; and those who are naturally so constituted do well not to marry".&lt;ref&gt;Clement of Alexandria: The Stromata, or Miscellanies. Book III, Chapter I. [http://www.gnosis.org/library/strom3.htm The Gnostic Society Library].&lt;/ref&gt;

The First Council of Nicaea in 323 AD established 20 new laws called canons.  The first of these was the prohibition of self castration.

{{main article|Ethiopian eunuch}}
The Ethiopian eunuch, an early gentile convert encountered in Acts 8, has been described as an early gay Christian, based on the fact that the word "eunuch" in the Bible was not always used literally, as in Matthew 19:12.&lt;ref name="McNeill_93" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McNeill|first=John J.|title=Freedom, Glorious Freedom: The Spiritual Journey to the Fullness of Life for Gays, Lesbians, and Everybody Else|year=2010|publisher=Lethe|page=211 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C0oWZsYv2RIC&amp;pg=PA211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Female homosexuality===
In the [[Epistle to the Romans]] 1:26-27 (ESV), [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] writes, "For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature". Most interpreters assume that, due to the analogy with same-sex lust between males, Paul is referring to female same-sex behavior. This assumption is not conclusive, and it remains difficult to discern exactly what Paul meant by women exchanging natural intercourse for unnatural.&lt;ref&gt;Nissinen, M. (1998) ''Homoeroticism in the Biblical World: A Historical Perspective''. Augsburg Fortress Publishers. {{ISBN|0-8006-2985-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical and cultural issues==
Many commentators have argued that the references to homosexuality in the NT, or the Bible in general, have to be understood in their proper historical context. Indeed, most interpreters come to the text with a preconceived notion of what the Bible has to say about normative sexual behaviors, influencing subsequent interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Myles, ''Dandy Discipleship: A Queering of Mark’s Male Disciples'' JMMS 4:2 (2010), p. 66-81. {{cite web |url=http://www.jmmsweb.org/issues/volume4/number2/pp66-81 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130701040943/http://www.jmmsweb.org/issues/volume4/number2/pp66-81 |archivedate=2013-07-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, William Walker says that the very notion of "homosexuality" (or even "heterosexuality", "bisexuality" and "sexual orientation") is essentially a modern concept that would simply have been unintelligible to the New Testament writers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westarinstitute.org/resources/the-fourth-r/what-the-new-testament-says-about-homosexuality/ What the New Testament Says about Homosexuality] Westar Institute, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The word "homosexuality" and the concept of sexual orientation as being separate from one's perceived masculinity or femininity (i.e. gender identity) did not take shape until the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Halperin, D. M. (1990) ''One Hundred Years of Homosexuality''. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, although some ancient Romans (i.e. doctors, astrologers, etc.) discussed congenital inclinations to unconventional sexual activities such as homosexuality, this classification fails to correspond to a modern psychological, biological and genetic distinction between homosexual, heterosexual and bisexual orientations.&lt;ref&gt;Brooten, B. (1998) ''Love Between Women: Early Christian Responses to Female Homoeroticism'' (Chicago Series on Sexuality, History &amp; Society). University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Gagnon, the concept of homosexual orientation was not wholly unknown in the Greco-Roman milieu. Moreover, he asserts that there is absolutely no evidence that modern orientation theory would have had any impact on Paul changing his strong negative valuation of homosexual practice.&lt;ref&gt;Gagnon, R.B. (2008) [http://www.fulcrum-anglican.org.uk/page.cfm?ID=325 The Faulty Orientation Argument of Anglican Archbishop Harper of Ireland.] Fulcrum.&lt;/ref&gt;

A statement by the Bishops of the Church of England (Issues in Human Sexuality) in 1991 illustrates a categorization and understanding of homosexuality, claiming that in ancient times "society recognized the existence of those, predominantly male, who appeared to be attracted entirely to members of their own sex." (Issues in Human Sexuality para 2.16, lines 8-9) which almost parallels that of modern ideation. The same study is careful to point out that "the modern concept of orientation has been developed against a background of genetic and psychological theory which was not available to the ancient world."

Sarah Ruden, in her ''Paul Among the People'' (2010) argues that the only form of homosexual sex that was apparent to the public in Paul's time was exploitative pederasty, in which slave boys were raped by adult males, often very violently. Paul's condemnation of homosexuality, Ruden argues, can be interpreted most plausibly as a criticism of this kind of brutally exploitative behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Ruden, ''Paul Among the People'' (2010), p. 54-55, .&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Indraastra''' was the mythical weapon of Indian deity [[Indra]] which was invoked by the main character [[Arjuna]] many times in the [[Mahabharata]] war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=mopbmlQrc3gC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Mahabharatha: A Child's View|last=Arni|first=Samhita|date=2004-09-15|publisher=Tara Publishing|year=|isbn=9788186211700|location=|pages=51|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the divine weapon was shot it transformed into many arrows capable of killing many men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=CJe9BAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Pure Gems of Ramayanam|last=aravamudan|first=krishnan|date=2014-09-22|publisher=PartridgeIndia|year=|isbn=9781482837209|location=|pages=569|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use in Mahabharata war== 
On the fourteenth day of the war, when [[Arjuna]] wanted to kill King [[Jayadratha]], [[Drona]] and [[Duryodhana]] sent their men to stop [[Arjuna]]. One of these was King [[Sudakshina]], who threw his spear at [[Arjuna]], striking  him and causing blood to flow. [[Kaurava]]'s army thought that [[Arjuna]] had died but he got up and shot Indraastra, killing King [[Sudakshina]] and a large part of his army.

On the seventeenth day of the war [[Arjuna]] shot his Indraastra on the Samsaptakas killing many of them.

The '''Khapra Kodiya Caves''' are part of the [[Junagadh Buddhist Cave Groups|Junagadh Buddhist Cave Group]]. They are the oldest of the caves in the group. The caves, on the basis of scribbles and short cursive letters on the wall, are dated to 3rd-4th century BCE during the Emperor [[Ashoka]]’s rule and are the plainest of all the caves in the groups.&lt;ref name="ASI Buddhist Cave Groups"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ticketed Monuments - Gujarat Buddhist Cave Groups, Uperkot, Junagadh|url=http://asi.nic.in/asi_monu_tktd_gujarat_buddhistcaves.asp|publisher=Archaeological Survey of India, Government of India|accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These caves are also known as Khangar Mahal.&lt;ref name=Sagar&gt;{{cite book|last=Sagar|first=Krishna Chandra|title=Foreign influence on ancient India|year=1992|publisher=Northern Book Centre|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-8172110284|page=150|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0UA4rkm9MgkC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;lpg=PA150|accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were carved in  rock during the reign of Emperor [[Ashoka]] and are considered the earliest monastic settlement in the area. These caves are along the edge of the ancient Sudarshan Lake (which no longer exists) and a little outside Uparkot fort, to the north. 

[[File:Plan of Khapra Kodiya Caves.png|left|thumb|Plan of the caves.]]
The caves are carved out in an east-west longitudinal ridge. They are small in area. But the architecture of the water tanks is unique, and the caves form an ‘L’ shaped residence. Caves were used by [[bhikku]]s during [[vassa]] period. After many years of use, they were abandoned because cracks within the caves let water seep into living quarters, rendering them unusable. Many accounts say that after this, the monks left for [[Maharashtra]], where they went on to carve many similar and more elaborate structures. Khapara Kodia was damaged by later quarrying, and now only the highest story remains.&lt;ref name="Gujarat Limited"&gt;{{cite web|title=Buddhist Caves |url=http://www.gujarattourism.com/showpage.aspx?contentid=191&amp;webpartid=547 |publisher=Gujarat Tourism - Tourism Corporation of Gujarat Limited |accessdate=25 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212072711/http://gujarattourism.com/showpage.aspx?contentid=191&amp;webpartid=547 |archivedate=12 December 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born on November 15, 1906 to farmers, Nikkyō had a humble life in a small town. Later in his youth he moved to Tokyo to work, where he began to study several different religions. During his studies he attended a sermon on the [[Lotus Sutra]] and became a Buddhist.

==Risshō Kōsei Kai==
Mr. Niwano had been actively involved with the Buddhist group [[Reiyūkai]], and it was then that he encountered Ms. [[Myoko Naganuma]] and led her to convert to Reiyūkai. In 1938 they both attended a leaders meeting where the leadership of Reiyūkai made several comments stating that the [[Lotus Sutra]] was outdated. After discussing this matter with each other, they decided that they could not belong to an organization which held this type of view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rkhawaii.org/rkhistory.htm|title=Rissho Kosei-kai Buddhist Church of Hawaii|work=rkhawaii.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120915104157/http://www.rkhawaii.org/rkhistory.htm|archivedate=2012-09-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 5, 1938 they founded Risshō Kōsei Kai, holding the first meeting in Mr. Niwano's house.

Niwano was to be the President and Naganuma to be the vice-president. As the organization grew he gave up his job as a milk man and devoted himself full-time to the ministry. He became involved in interfaith activities and helped to found the [[World Conference of Religions for Peace]] in 1970. During this time he became involved in numerous religious and cultural conferences and gatherings, some of which include the Asian Conference on Religion and Peace and the 6th WCRP in Italy, where he presided over the WCRP alongside Pope John Paul II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rk-world.org/founder.aspx|title=About Rissho Kosei-kai, a  Buddhist organization.|work=rk-world.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also spoke on several occasions as the [[United Nations]] calling for world peace and the abolition of nuclear arms.

In 1991 he stepped down as president and was succeeded by his eldest son, [[Nichiko Niwano]]. Although retired, he continued to participate in interfaith and peace activities.

==Awards==
In 1979 he was awarded the [[Templeton Foundation Prize for Progress in Religion]].
In 1992 he was made a Knight Commander with the Silver Star of the Order of St. Gregory the Great by the Vatican.
In 1993 Mr. Niwano was awarded the [[Interfaith Medallion]] from the International Council of Christians and Jews.
Daniel Montgomery quotes that "no Buddhist leader in the World has become more widely known or showered with honours than him." &lt;ref name="fire"&gt;Montgomery, Daniel (1991). ''Fire in the Lotus, The Dynamic Religion of Nichiren''. London : Mandala, {{ISBN|1852740914}}, page 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Nikkyo Niwano died on October 4, 1999. He was cremated and some of his ashes were placed in the Precious Stupa of the One Vehicle, a small stupa located on the grounds of the groups headquarters. He is remembered for his interfaith work and his calls for global peace and disarmament. While many people around the world regard him with the highest respect, some criticism occurred shortly after his death regarding the large fortune that he left behind, many claiming that this was un-Buddhist.&lt;ref&gt;http://search.japantimes.co.jp/member/member.html?nn20000907b8.htm{{dead link|date=April 2015|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''New Royalist Action''' ({{lang-fr|Nouvelle Action Royaliste}}, NAR) is a [[Monarchism|monarchist]] ([[Orléanist]]) political movement marked by a will to found a [[constitutional monarchy]] in [[France]].

==History==
The movement has its roots in [[Action Française]], the major French monarchist movement before [[World War II]], which was re-formed by [[Maurice Pujo]] in 1947 around the movement ''Restoration Nationale''. In 1971 a breakaway movement, the ''Nouvelle Action Française'' was established by [[Bertrand Renouvin]]. Soon, the name of this movement was changed to ''Nouvelle Action Royaliste''; Renouvin, arguably “France's most prominent [...] and reasonable monarchist″&lt;ref&gt;[[Mother Jones Magazine]], July 1989. Available at https://books.google.com/books?id=MecDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=%22nouvelle+action+royaliste%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES, accessed 11 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; is the group's president. The NAR publish in particular a historical review entitled ''Le Lys rouge'' and a political semi-monthly ''Royaliste''.

==Character==
The members of the NAR are sometimes described as "royalists of the left", due to close relations to certain ideas defended by the parties of the [[Left-wing politics|left]].&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Farewell, Revolution: Disputed Legacies : France, 1789/1989|author=Kaplan, S.L.|date=1995|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=9780801427183|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=99RnAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its leader, [[Bertrand Renouvin]], appealed to his supporters to vote for [[French Socialist Party|Socialist]] [[François Mitterrand]] in both the [[French presidential election, 1981|1981]] and [[French presidential election, 1988|1988 presidential elections]]. In November 1989, the NAR joined the ''89 pour l'égalité'' movement, which campaigned to get [[Right of foreigners to vote|voting rights for immigrants]]&lt;ref name="quid"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.quid.fr/2007/Institutions_Francaises/Partis_Clubs_Et_Mouvements/9 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061228084245/http://www.quid.fr/2007/Institutions_Francaises/Partis_Clubs_Et_Mouvements/9 |archive-date=28 December 2006 |dead-url=yes |title=QUID - INSTITUTIONS FRANÇAISES - PARTIS, CLUBS ET MOUVEMENTS - PARTIS, CLUBS ET MOUVEMENTS - 9 - Quid.fr |accessdate=31 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; alongside [[SOS Racisme]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sos-racisme.org/1989.html&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the 2002 presidential elections, Renouvin chose to support the candidature of [[Jean-Pierre Chevènement]],&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=The French Presidential and Legislative Elections of 2002|author=Gaffney, J.|date=2004|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=9780754634362|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2QmzRqOAfAoC|page=314|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the only [[souverainism|souverainist]] able in Renouvin's view to gather the good will of both left and right for the purpose of regaining France her position in the world.

The ideas of NAR are characterized by souverainism, anti-[[Economic liberalism|liberalism]] and [[anti-Americanism]]. They are economically [[Keynesian]]. The NAR appealed to vote against the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Constitution]] in the [[French referendum on the European Constitution|referendum]] of 29 May 2005.

The organization is member of the [[International Monarchist Conference]].

The '''Parvatha Ucchi Malai''' is a mythycal mountain believed to be near [[Ayotha Amirtha Gangai]] as per [[Akilattirattu Ammanai]] the source of [[Ayyavazhi mythology]]. 

As per the tradition after the [[Krishna]] [[Avatar]] the '''Avatara Chatam''' ''(body taken for the avatar)'' of [[Vishnu]] was placed in this mountain. Then for the [[Vaikunda Avatharm]] again this body cleaned up and was taken into the sea by two sages, '''Kalai Muni''' and '''Gnana Muni'''. Then [[Ayya Vaikundar]] incarnates in that body. There was also claims that it was [[Marunthuvazh Malai]] so stated in [[Akilam]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2181">'''Pisgah Grande''' (1914-1920) was a [[Pentecostal]] Christian community in [[Las Llajas Canyon]] north of [[Simi Valley]] founded by Dr. [[Finis E. Yoakum]].
&lt;ref name="Kagan"&gt;Kagan, Paul, ''New World Utopias''.  Penguin Books.  1975. Library of Congress Catalog Card Number 74-78929.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=California's Utopian Colonies |last=Hine |first=Robert V. |year=1953 |publisher=Huntington Library |location=San Marino, Calif. |pages=153–154 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1920 his successor, James Cheek, moved the colony to [[Pikesville, Tennessee]].&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, Robert P., [https://books.google.com/books?id=pA01_CvpCsIC&amp;pg=PA133&amp;lpg=PA133&amp;dq=%22pisgah+grande%22+pentecostal&amp;source=web&amp;ots=AUx8IpgEVo&amp;sig=KQ57iDsFWuawG1Q49j43-tvpKlE#PPP1,M1 Modern American Communes, A Dictionary], Greenwood Press, 2005, {{ISBN|0-313-32181-7}}, p. 133-134&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Yoakum had experienced a [[spiritual awakening]] and decided to devote his life to religious pursuits after a miraculous recovery from a carriage accident in 1895 in [[Denver]].  He relocated to [[Los Angeles]] where he founded several charitable enterprises named Pisgah, after the peak in the Sinai from which Moses saw the promised land.  Beside Pisgah Grande there was Pisgah Home in the [[Highland Park, Los Angeles, California|Highland Park]] section of Los Angeles, Pisgah Store, Pisgah Ark, a recovery house for women, and Pisgah Gardens, a rehabilitative center, orphanage, and farm in [[North Hollywood]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pisgah.com/history.html History of Pisgah&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Associated with the Christ Faith Mission of Highland Park, Pisgah Grande served as a mission and a rehabilitation center for the poor and destitute of [[Los Angeles]] and other nearby areas.&lt;ref name="Kagan" /&gt;

At one point the community had 300 members and its own [[post office]].&lt;ref name="Kagan" /&gt;

'''Mary Louisa "Polly" Toynbee''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɔɪ|n|b|i}}; born 27 December 1946)&lt;ref&gt;[[National Portrait Gallery (London)|National Portrait Gallery]], [http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person.php?LinkID=mp06350 Polly Toynbee]&lt;/ref&gt; is a British journalist and writer. She has been a [[columnist]] for ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper since 1998.

She is a [[social democrat]] and was a candidate for the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] in the 1983 general election. She now broadly supports the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], although she has been critical of its current [[left-wing]] leader, [[Jeremy Corbyn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Toynbee|first1=Polly|title=Why can’t I get behind Corbyn, when we want the same things?

Toynbee previously worked as social affairs editor for the [[BBC]] and also for ''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper. She is vice-president of [[Humanists UK]], having previously served as its president between 2007 and 2012.&lt;ref name="BHAPres"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://humanism.org.uk/about/our-people/distinguished-supporters/polly-toynbee/ |title= Polly Toynbee|accessdate= 11 March 2014|publisher= British Humanist Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also named Columnist of the Year at the 2007 [[British Press Awards]].

==Background==
Polly Toynbee was born at Yafford on the [[Isle of Wight]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Toynbee|first1=Polly|title=Back on the Isle of Wight, Tory Britain rehearses its collapse|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/apr/07/isle-wight-tory-rehearses-collapse|website=The Guardian|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=7 April 2015|ref=gu}}&lt;/ref&gt; the second daughter of the literary critic [[Philip Toynbee]] (by his first wife Anne), granddaughter of the historian [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], and great-great niece of philanthropist and economic historian [[Arnold Toynbee]], after whom [[Toynbee Hall]] in the [[East End]] of London is named. Her parents divorced when Toynbee was aged four and she moved to London with her mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3634626/Profile-Polly-Toynbee.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=William | last=Langley | title=Profile: Polly Toynbee | date=26 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After attending [[Badminton School]], a girls' independent school in Bristol, followed by [[Holland Park School]], a state [[comprehensive school]] in London, as she had failed the [[11-plus]] examination. She passed one A-level,&lt;ref name=indie261106&gt;{{cite news | first = Andy | last = McSmith | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/polly-toynbee-reborn-as-a-lady-of-the-right-425833.html | title = Polly Toynbee: Reborn, as a lady of the right | newspaper =  The Independent | location = London | date =  26 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; obtained a scholarship to read history at [[St Anne's College, Oxford]], but dropped out of university after eighteen months. During her [[gap year]], in 1966, she worked for [[Amnesty International]] in [[Rhodesia]] (which had just [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|unilaterally declared independence]]) until she was expelled by the government.&lt;ref name=indie261106/&gt; She published her first novel, ''Leftovers'', in 1966.&lt;ref name=indie261106/&gt; Following her expulsion from Rhodesia, Toynbee revealed the existence of the [["Harry" letters affair|"Harry" letters]], which detailed the alleged funding of Amnesty International by the British government.&lt;ref name="Forsythe2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Professor David P Forsythe|title=Encyclopedia of Human Rights|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1QbX90fmCVUC&amp;pg=PA164|accessdate=12 November 2012|date=11 August 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-533402-9|pages=164–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Oxford, she found work in a factory and a burger bar and hoping to write in her spare time. She later said "I had a loopy idea that I could work with my hands during the day and in the evening come home and write novels and poetry, and be [[Tolstoy]]... But I very quickly discovered why people who work in factories don't usually have the energy to write when they get home."&lt;ref name=indie261106/&gt; She went into journalism, working on the diary at ''[[The Observer]]'', and turned her eight months of experience in manual work (along with "undercover" stints as a nurse and an Army recruit) into the book ''A Working Life'' (1970).&lt;ref name=indie261106/&gt;

==Career==
Toynbee worked for many years at ''[[The Guardian]]'' before joining the [[BBC]] where she was social affairs editor (1988–1995). At ''[[The Independent]]'', which she joined after leaving the BBC, she was a columnist and associate editor, working with then editor [[Andrew Marr]]. She later rejoined ''The Guardian''. She has also written for ''[[The Observer]]'' and the ''[[Radio Times]]''; at one time she edited the ''Washington Monthly USA''.

[[File:PollyToynbee.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Polly Toynbee speaks at the October 2005 [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] conference]]

Following in the footsteps of [[Barbara Ehrenreich]]'s ''[[Nickel and Dimed]]'' (2001), she published in 2003 ''[[Hard Work: Life in Low-pay Britain]]'' about an experimental period voluntarily living on the [[minimum wage]], which was £4.10 per hour at the time. She worked as a hospital [[porter (carrier)|porter]] in a [[National Health Service]] hospital, a [[catering|dinnerlady]] in a primary school, a nursery assistant, a [[call centre|call-centre]] employee, a cake factory worker and a [[care home]] assistant, during which time she contracted salmonella. The book is critical of conditions in low pay jobs in Britain.  She also contributed an introduction to the UK edition of Ehrenreich's ''[[Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America]]''.

Currently Toynbee serves as President of the [[Social Policy Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.social-policy.com/contacts.aspx |title= SPA Executive Committee 2007–08 |accessdate=21 April 2008 |publisher= Social Policy Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is chair of the [[Brighton Festival]] and deputy treasurer of the [[Fabian Society]].

==Political history and opinions==
Polly Toynbee is a member of the Labour Party. Toynbee and her first husband [[Peter Jenkins (journalist)|Peter Jenkins]] (from 1970)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = William | last = Langley | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3634626/Profile-Polly-Toynbee.html | title = Profile: Polly Toynbee | newspaper = The Daily Telegraph | location = London | date =  26 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; were supporters of the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] breakaway from Labour in 1981, both signing the [[Limehouse Declaration]]. Toynbee stood for the party at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 General Election]] in [[Lewisham East (UK Parliament constituency)|Lewisham East]], garnering 9351 votes (22%), and finishing third.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/the_daily_politics/8576557.stm Polly Toynbee and Andrew Pierce on air and rail strikes], The Daily Politics, BBC, 19 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; She was one of the very few SDP members who believed in [[unilateral nuclear disarmament]], founding an unsuccessful group "Unilateralists for Social Democracy".&lt;ref&gt;Roy Jenkins, ''A Life at the Centre'' (London: Macmillan, 1981), p. 588.&lt;/ref&gt; She later refused to support the subsequent merger of the SDP with the Liberals (to form the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]), reacting instead by rejoining Labour when the rump SDP collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/01/labour-unions-social-democracy-unions | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Polly | last=Toynbee | title=Some SDP thinking might strengthen Labour's nerve | date=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Toynbee criticised Metropolitan Police Commissioner [[Paul Condon]]'s comments that 80% of [[Robbery|mugging]] cases were committed by black people, stating that it was "an over-simplification that is seriously misleading".&lt;ref name=Vhscb&gt;{{cite news|last1=Toynbee|first1=Polly|title=Mugging: is it a black and white issue?|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/mugging-is-it-a-black-and-white-issue-1590337.html|accessdate=15 January 2016|work=The Independent|date=7 July 1995|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; She approvingly quoted academic researcher Michael Keith, who said: "If you were to standardise for everything else – education, unemployment, housing estates, life chances – race on its own would have virtually no significance."&lt;ref name=Vhscb/&gt;

In a 2002 debate hosted by the [[Royal Society of Arts]] and ''Prospect'', Toynbee argued that the West should pursue liberal internationalism by intervening through the [[United Nations]] to promote democracy around the world: "Spreading people's right to self-determination, and their right to think and vote for themselves, is a moral obligation… We should be intervening now in the Congo and Sudan".&lt;ref&gt;Polly Toynbee, John Gray and Hazem Saghiyeh, '(Re-)ordering the world: dilemmas of liberal imperialism', ''RSA Journal'' Vol. 149, No. 5501 (2002), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Toynbee strongly supports [[state education]], though she had two of her three children partly educated in the private sector, leading to accusations of [[hypocrisy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/polly-toynbee-reborn-as-a-lady-of-the-right-425833.html |title= Polly Toynbee: Reborn, as a lady of the right |work= The Independent |author=McSmith, Andy |date=26 November 2006 |location =London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/45076,news-comment,news-politics,polly-toynbee-the-great-comic-figure-of-the-age,2 |title=Toynbee: the great comic figure of the age |author=Jones, Lewis |work= The First Post |date=August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although consistently critical of many of [[Tony Blair]]'s [[New Labour]] reforms, she wrote in 2005 that his government "remains the best government of my political lifetime".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Polly |last= Toynbee |url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/sep/23/labour.politicalcolumnists |title= The fight for the centre ground is throttling British politics |newspaper =The Guardian |date= 23 September 2005 |location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 General Election]], with dissatisfaction high among traditional Labour voters, Toynbee wrote several times about the dangers of [[protest vote|protest voting]], "Giving Blair a bloody nose". She urged ''Guardian'' readers to vote with a [[clothes peg]] over their nose if they had to, to make sure [[Michael Howard]] would not win from a [[Spoiler effect|split vote]]. "Voters think they can take a free hit at Blair while assuming Labour will win anyway. But Labour won't win if people won't vote for it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/election2005/archives/2005/04/13/hold_your_nose_and_vote_labour.html |title= Hold your nose and vote Labour |accessdate=21 April 2008 |last= Toynbee |first= Polly|date=13 April 2005|work= [[guardian.co.uk|Guardian Unlimited]] Election blog |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Polly Toynbee.jpg|thumb|left|Toynbee speaking to [[Policy Exchange]] in 2013]]
In December 2006, [[Greg Clark]] (a former SDP member, later to be a Conservative Minister) claimed Toynbee should be an influence on the modern [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], causing a press furore. Reacting to this, Conservative leader David Cameron said he was impressed by one metaphor in her writings – of society being a caravan crossing a desert, where the people at the back can fall so far behind they are no longer part of the tribe. He added, "I will not be introducing Polly Toynbee's policies". Toynbee expressed some discomfort with this embrace, adding, "I don't suppose the icebergs had much choice about being hugged by Cameron either."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3634521/Polly-Toynbee-the-Tory-guru-thats-barking.-Or-maybe-not.html |title= Polly Toynbee the Tory guru: that's barking. Or maybe not |accessdate=21 April 2008 |last= Johnson |first= Boris |authorlink= Boris Johnson |date=23 November 2006 |newspaper =The Daily Telegraph |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the episode, [[Boris Johnson]], at the time a Conservative MP and journalist who had been severely criticised by Toynbee, rejected any association with Toynbee's views, writing that she "incarnates all the nannying, high-taxing, high-spending schoolmarminess of Blair's Britain. Polly is the high priestess of our paranoid, mollycoddled, risk-averse, airbagged, booster-seated culture of political correctness and [[Occupational safety and health|'elf 'n' safety]] fascism".&lt;ref name="BBCFaces"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6180236.stm |title= Faces of the week |accessdate= 21 April 2008 |last= Chaundy |first= Bob |date=24 November 2006 |work= BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having advocated [[Gordon Brown|Brown]] to succeed Blair as Prime Minister, she continued to endorse him in the early part of his premiership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jun/29/comment.politics |title= It's a truly decent, clever team, but that is not enough.

But vote with your head"], ''The Guarian'', 24 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010 Toynbee was criticised for an article in ''The Guardian''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Polly | last = Toynbee | url = https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/oct/25/benefits-cut-rents-up-housing-time-bomb | title = Benefits cut, rents up: this is Britain's housing time bomb | newspaper =  The Guardian | location = London | date = 25 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which she said the government's benefits changes would drive many poor people out of London and could be seen as a "[[final solution]]" for their situation. Some people interpreted this as a reference to the [[Nazism|Nazis]], which Toynbee said was not her intention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-1325049/DAILY-MAIL-COMMENT-In-reason-cut-caterwauling.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=In the name of reason, cut the caterwauling | date=30 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/8097816/Hysterics-over-housing.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Hysterics over housing | date=29 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-1324412/Labours-gleeful-hopes-double-dip-recession-juvenile.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | first=Stephen | last=Glover | title= Labour's gleeful hopes for a double-dip recession are juvenile.

Toynbee has been described as "the queen of leftist journalists",&lt;ref name=indie261106/&gt; and in 2008 topped a poll of 100 "opinion makers", carried out by Editorial Intelligence. She was also named the most influential columnist in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url = http://www.editorialintelligence.com/ei-news/article.php?d=080413 | title = Polly Toynbee Voted UK's 'Most Influential' Commentator | publisher =  Editorial Intelligence | date = 13 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; With her current partner, former Social Affairs editor of ''The Guardian'' David Walker (Peter Jenkins died in 1992), Toynbee co-authored two books reviewing the successes and failures of New Labour in power. In ''Unjust Rewards'' (2008) they argued that "excess at the top hurts others".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Review: Unjust Rewards by Polly Toynbee and David Walker |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/non_fictionreviews/3559014/Review-Unjust-Rewards-by-Polly-Toynbee-and-David-Walker.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location =London |date = 23 August 2008 |author= Reeves, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/sep/14/1?INTCMP=SRCH |author=Sutherland, Ruth |work=The Observer |location =London |title= Asbos for the millionaires: A strong and hopeful analysis of the growing gap between Britain's rich and poor |date =14 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polly Toynbee hopes [[Theresa May]] will work to reduce [[Poverty in the UK]], and that [[Working Tax Credit]] will be increased to reduce child poverty.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/21/child-poverty-theresa-may If Theresa May really cares about the poor, she must change course – now] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Toynbee does not believe the public sector needs steadily less money every year.  Toynbee argues that the government has plenty of money to finance tax cuts for better off people.  Toynbee wrote in March 2017, "They plan to cut the size of the state permanently to 36% of GDP, from 45% in 2010. New faces in No 10 and 11 Downing Street are only casting changes for the same old script, ideologically identical."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/07/philip-hammond-budget  Don’t fall for Philip Hammond’s budget trickery. There is an alternative] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  In late June 2017, after the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017 general election]] Toynbee wrote, "There are a million fewer public servants than in 2010, a loss keenly felt in every field. (...) From depleted Whitehall’s frantic scramble to hire thousands more experts to cope with Brexit, to the critical shortage of nurses and carers, cuts in environmental health officers and 90% fewer health and safety at work inspections, voters now see a threadbare public sector.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/29/public-sector-pay-tory-cheers-labour-vote Applauding a public sector pay cap? Tories are cheering their own demise] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

A week after the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017 General Election]] Toynbee responded to the [[Grenfell Tower fire]], she wrote, "Political blame spreads right through the Conservative party, with no escape on offer. This goes far beyond the precise shockers – the Tory MPs who mockingly rejected housing regulation; the cuts to funding to councils responsible for retro-fitting fire suppressants; the disregard of coroner’s instructions after the 2009 [[Lakanal House fire|Lakanal House tragedy]]; and even the plan to opt out of EU safety regulations. Conservative Kensington and Chelsea council allegedly blocking its ears to tenants’ well-founded anxiety is just the immediate scandal. But this event reaches far deeper, to the very sinews of its party’s policy."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/16/theresa-may-scared-grenfell-survivors-finished-austerity-cameron-osborne Theresa May was too scared to meet the Grenfell survivors.

Toynbee believes the [[National Health Service]] is badly underfunded.  In January 2017 she wrote, "When the Royal College of Surgeons protests at cancer operations cancelled, is that a tipping point? When nearly half of all hospitals declare major alerts for lack of beds, that’s an emergency. There’s no winter flu, no Arctic weather, just pressure from underfunding, like an aneurysm about to burst. But the prime minister is not for turning, not yet."  Toynbee also wrote, "But May can’t defy the NHS laws of gravity that force every prime minister to U-turn on underfunding. Margaret Thatcher, John Major and Tony Blair all buckled. This crisis looks set to outdo all those, says Chris Ham, NHS historian and head of the King’s Fund. History shows – and this was proved in the Blair years – that when the NHS reaches roughly EU funding levels, its results soar. When funding falls too far, trolleys pile up in corridors."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/17/nhs-crisis-act-self-sacrifice-rescue-health-service NHS crisis: the one act of self-sacrifice that could rescue our health service] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on religion==
An [[atheism|atheist]], Toynbee is an Honorary Associate of the [[National Secular Society]] and a distinguished supporter of the [[Humanist Society Scotland]], and was appointed President of the [[British Humanist Association]] in July 2007. Since 2012 she has been the BHA's Vice President.&lt;ref name="BHAPres"/&gt;  She claimed that she is simply a consistent atheist, and is just as critical of [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and [[Judaism]]. She wrote: "The pens sharpen – [[Islamophobia]]! No such thing. Primitive Middle Eastern religions (and most others) are much the same – Islam, Christianity and Judaism all define themselves through disgust for women's bodies."&lt;ref name=whr&gt;[http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/index/T650070664762L7X.pdf Behind the Burka]. ''Womens History Review'', Volume 10, Number 4, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 she declared "I am an Islamophobe and proud of it".&lt;ref&gt;''The Independent'' (23 October 1997), quoted in Naser Meer, ''Citizenship, Identity and the Politics of Multiculturalism: The Rise of Muslim Consciousness'' (London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2010), p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 she opposed the [[Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006|Bill]] to outlaw incitement to religious hatred: "Race is something people cannot choose and it defines nothing about them. But beliefs are what people choose to identify with...The two cannot be blurred into one – which is why the word Islamophobia is a nonsense".&lt;ref&gt;''The Guardian'' (10 June 2005), quoted in Meer, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 upon the 25th anniversary of [[Pope John Paul II]]'s papacy, she wrote that he "is a hate-figure and with good reason… No one can compute how many people have died of Aids as a result of Wojtyla's power, how many woman have died in childbirth needlessly, how many children starved in families too large and poor to feed them. But it is reasonable to suppose these silent, unseen, uncounted deaths at his hand would match that of any self-respecting tyrant or dictator".&lt;ref&gt;Polly Toynbee, '[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/oct/17/catholicism.religion False paeans to the Pope]', ''The Guardian'' (17 October 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

Toynbee had agreed to debate with the philosopher [[William Lane Craig]] during his UK October visit,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bethinking.org/what-is-apologetics/introductory/polly-toynbee-steps-in-where-grayling-dawkins-fear-to-tread.htm|website=Bethinking.org|title=What is Apologetics? – Polly Toynbee steps in where Grayling &amp; Dawkins fear to tread}}&lt;/ref&gt; but subsequently pulled out, saying "I hadn't realised the nature of Mr Lane Craig's debating style, and having now looked at his previous performances, this is not my kind of forum."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/UnbelievableJB/status/101712221247258624|title=Sad to announce that @pollytoynbee has pulled out of debating William Lane Craig.

Toynbee has mixed feelings about the [[Church of England]]; she opposed both religious and secular [[dogma]]tic beliefs. In April 2014 she wrote:
{{cquote|The C of E is a confusing creature. Even while it tussles internally between conservative and liberal wings on gay marriage or female bishops, polls of its members show it's no longer the Conservative party at prayer: more vote Lib Dem and Labour. Look at the 40 bishops' raspberry of an Easter message to Cameron, with their strong rebuke against the "national crisis" of hunger so much worsened by his welfare policies. They know because their churches house the food banks used by almost a million people. (...) Like all humanity, the religious are both good and bad. The C of E is good on food banks, bad on sex and death. Faith makes people no more virtuous, but nor do rationalists claim any moral superiority. Pogroms, inquisitions, jihadist terror and religious massacres can be matched death for death with the secular horrors of Pol Pot, Hitler or Stalin. The danger is where absolute belief in universal truths, religious or secular, permits no doubt.&lt;ref&gt;Polly Toynbee [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/18/david-cameron-votes-britain-christian-country "David Cameron won't win votes by calling Britain a Christian country"], ''The Guardian'', 18 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Honours==
Toynbee was awarded an Honorary Degree by the [[University of Essex]] in 1999 and by [[London South Bank University]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lsbu.ac.uk/about/honoraryDegrees.shtml|title= Honorary Degrees |accessdate=21 April 2008 |publisher= [[London South Bank University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, she was made an Honorary Doctor of [[The Open University]] for "her notable contribution to the educational and cultural well-being of society". The [[University of Kent]] awarded Toynbee the honorary title of Doctor of Civil Law in November 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kent.ac.uk/congregations/honorary-grads/archive/2007/pollytoynbee.html|title=Polly Toynbee - Congregations - University of Kent|website=www.kent.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; in recognition of her concern with poverty and welfare. This was followed in 2008 when [[University of Leeds]] awarded her fourth Honorary Doctorate.

She won the [[Orwell Prize]] for journalism in 1998 (for journalism published by ''[[The Independent]]''),&lt;ref&gt;The Orwell Prize, [http://theorwellprize.co.uk/shortlists/polly-toynbee/ Polly Toynbee]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2007 was named 'Columnist of the Year' at the [[British Press Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jul/09/mediatop1002007.mondaymediasection76 The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="54369">[[Polygamy]] is "the practice or custom of having more than one wife or husband at the same time."&lt;ref name="OxfordDict" /&gt; Polygamy has been practiced by many cultures throughout history.&lt;ref name="Zeitzen2008" /&gt;{{rp|3}} There are numerous examples of polygamy among close followers, devotees, and the faithful to God in the [[Old Testament]], but it is generally not accepted by contemporary [[Christian]]s. Some Christians actively debate whether the [[New Testament]] or [[Christian ethics]] allows or forbids polygamy and there are several [[Christian views on the Old Covenant]]. This debate focuses almost exclusively on [[polygyny]] (one man having more than one wife) and not [[polyandry]] (one woman having more than one husband).

==Jewish background==
{{See also|Polygamy#Judaism|Pilegesh}}

===Old Testament===
Polygyny is explicitly not forbidden in the [[Old Testament]]. The [[Torah]] includes a few specific regulations on the practice of polygyny,&lt;ref name="Coogan2010" /&gt;{{rp|79}} such as {{Bibleverse|Exodus |21:10|RSV}} "If he takes another wife to himself, he shall not diminish her food, her clothing, or her marital rights". {{bibleverse|Deut|21:15–17|NIV}} states that a man must award the inheritance due to a first-born son to the son who was actually born first, even if he hates that son's mother and likes another wife more; and {{bibleverse|Deut|17:17|NIV}} states that the king shall not have many wives.&lt;ref name="chabad.org1" /&gt; The king's behavior is condemned by the prophet [[Samuel]] in {{bibleverse|1 Samuel|1:8|KJV}}. Over 40 important figures had more than one wife, such as Esau{{bibleref2c|Genesis|26:34|RSV}}{{bibleref2c-nb|Genesis|28:6–9|RSV}}, Elkanah{{bibleref2c|1 Samuel| 1:1–8|RSV}}, and Solomon{{bibleref2c|1 Kings |11:1–3|RSV}}. Moses had three wives; Zipporah{{bibleref2c|Exodus| 2: 21|RSV}}, the daughter of Hobab{{bibleref2c|Numbers| 10: 291|RSV}} and the "Cushite" woman,{{bibleref2c|Numbers| 12: 1|RSV}} {{efn|Translated as the Ethiopian woman in the [[Authorised Version]].{{bibleref2c|Numbers| 12: 1|KJV}} }}

Multiple marriage was considered a realistic alternative in the case of famine, widowhood, or female infertility.&lt;ref name="chabad.org2" /&gt; The practice of [[levirate marriage]] obligated a man whose brother has left a widow without heir to marry her.{{bibleref2c|Deut|25:5–10|ESV}}

Polyandry was explicitly forbidden. If a man slept with a woman married to another man, both were to be put to death for adultery.{{bibleref2c|Deuteronomy|22:22|RSV}} Under this law, if two men were married to one woman, all three would be subject to the death penalty. It is for this reason that all examples of polygamy in scripture involve polygyny, not polyandry, and in most Christian discussion the words "polygamy" and "polygyny" can be considered synonymous.

===Intertestamental period===
Polygamy was a rare exception in [[Babylonian captivity|post-exilic]] Israel.&lt;ref name="Greenstone1906" /&gt; The practice began to be criticized and declined during the [[intertestamental period]]&lt;ref name="Instone-Brewer2002" /&gt;{{rp|59–62}} but there is some extant evidence of polygamy being practiced in the New Testament period.&lt;ref name="Instone-Brewer2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McClintockStrong1889" /&gt;{{rp|365}} The [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] show that several smaller [[Second Temple Judaism#Jewish sects|Jewish sects]] forbade polygamy before and during the time of [[Jesus]].&lt;ref name="Vermès1975" /&gt;{{rp|76}}&lt;ref name="Brooke2005" /&gt;{{rp|4, 100–101}}&lt;ref name="Murphy2002" /&gt; The [[Temple Scroll]] (11QT LVII 17–18) seems to prohibit polygamy.&lt;ref name="Brooke2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Loader2009" /&gt;

===Rabbinical=== 
According to Rabbi Naftali Silberberg, in Jewish thought polygamy is not and never was the ideal state and that the [[Talmud]] or [[Midrash]] never mentions a polygamous family is completely clear that polygamy was never the norm. He also states that almost all polygamous relationships in the Bible are for specific reasons such as the wife was barren ([[Sarah]], [[Leah]], etc), monarchs marrying to cement relationships between tribes, and [[Laban (Bible)|Laban]] tricking [[Jacob]] into marrying [[Leah]].&lt;ref name="chabad.org3" /&gt;

==New Testament==
Three passages in the [[pastoral epistles]] ({{bibleref2|1Timothy|3:2}}, {{bibleref2|1Timothy|3:12}} and {{bibleref2|Titus|1:6}}) state that church leaders should be the "husband of one wife." This has been read by some Christian sects as a prohibition of polygamy. Others argue that polygamy is allowed, but not for church leaders. Still others argue that the passage refers only to church leaders not divorcing their first wives. [[Walter Lock]] in his 1990 book argues it may simply refer to marital unfaithfulness&lt;ref name="Lock1999" /&gt; since "no Christian, whether an overseer or not, would have been allowed to practice polygamy."&lt;ref name="Guthrie1990" /&gt; In {{bibleref|1 Corinthians| 7|RSV}} [[Paul the Apostle]] states that a man is to have one wife and a woman is to have one husband. "Now concerning the matters about which you wrote: “It is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman.” 2 But because of the temptation to sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband. 3 The husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights, and likewise the wife to her husband. 4 For the wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does. Likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does. 5 Do not deprive one another, except perhaps by agreement for a limited time, that you may devote yourselves to prayer; but then come together again, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control."{{bibleref2c |1Corinthians|7|ESV}}

{{harvnb|Henry|2006|loc=[https://www.biblestudytools.com/commentaries/matthew-henry-complete/1-corinthians/7.html Ch7]}} comments on {{bibleref|1 Corinthians| 7|RSV}}: He ([[Paul the Apostle]]) informs them that marriage, and the comforts and satisfactions of that state, are by divine wisdom prescribed for preventing fornication (v. 2), Porneias —Fornications, all sorts of lawless lust. To avoid these, Let every man, says he, have his own wife, and every woman her  own husband; that is, marry, and confine themselves to their own mates. And, when they are married, let each render the other due benevolence (v. 3), consider the disposition and exigency of each other, and render conjugal duty, which is owing to each other. For, as the apostle argues (v. 4), in the married state neither person has power over his own body, but has delivered it into the power of the other, the wife hers into the power of the husband, the husband his into the power of the wife. Note, Polygamy, or the marriage of more persons than one, as well as adultery, must be a breach of marriage-covenants, and a violation of the partner’s rights.

===One flesh===
Although the [[New Testament]] is largely silent on the issue, some point to Jesus' repetition of the earlier scriptures, noting that a man and a wife "shall become one flesh."{{bibleref2c||Genesis|2:24|ESV}}{{bibleref2c||Matthew|19:3–6|ESV}} However, some look to [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]]'s writings to the [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|Corinthians]]:  "Do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute becomes one body with her? For, as it is written, 'The two will become one flesh.{{'"}} Supporters of polygamy claim this indicates that the term refers to a physical, rather than spiritual, union.{{bibleref2c||1 Corinthians|6:16|ESV}}

===Cleave to wife===
Most Christian theologians argue that in {{bibleref2|Matthew|19:3–9}} and referring to  {{bibleref2|Genesis|2:24}} [[Jesus]] explicitly states a man should have only one wife:

{{quote|Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female, And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?}}

Polygamists do not dispute that in marriage "two shall be one flesh", they only disagree with the idea that a married man can only be "one flesh" with one woman. Assuming the man is married, the fact that a man can even be "one flesh" with a [[harlot]] apparently does not negate his being "one flesh" with his wife.&lt;ref name="CarolBrooks" /&gt; Further, if a man is married, he and his wife are "one flesh." To add another wife would mean that the new wife becomes "one flesh" with the man ''and'' his current wife.

===Husband of one wife===
Many critics of polygamy also point to the [[Pauline epistles]] that state that church officials should be respectable, above reproach, and the husband of a single wife.{{bibleref2c||1Timothy|3|ESV}}{{bibleref2c||Titus|1|ESV}} Hermeneutically, the Greek phrase ''mias gunaikos andra'' is an unusual Greek construction, capable of being translated in multiple ways, including (but not limited to): 1) "one wife man," (prohibiting plural marriage) or 2) "a wife man" (requiring elders to be married) or 3) "first wife man" (prohibiting divorcés from ordination).&lt;ref name="Shipley2010" /&gt; Other interpretations include: Being faithful in relationships or restrained from chasing many women, so as to be characterized as a one-woman man; having been married only once (even if morally and legally released from the marriage bond by the death of the spouse). Some argue that definition 1 above implies acceptance of polygamy in the larger [[Christian culture]], explaining Paul's explicit rejection of polygamy for elders. However, the qualifications for elders almost exclusively mirror the expectations for all Christians, including restrictions on drunkenness and instructions to manage one's household well.

In the time around Jesus' birth, polygamy (also called [[bigamy]] or digamy in texts) was understood to have had several spouses consecutively, as evidenced for example by Tertullian's work ''De Exhortatione Castitatis''{{sfn|Tertullian|1885|loc=[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Ante-Nicene_Fathers/Volume_IV/Tertullian:_Part_Fourth/On_Exhortation_to_Chastity/Chapter_7 Vol IV, Ch. 7]}} Saint Paul answered this problem by allowing widows to remarry (1 Cor. vii. 39. and 1 Tim 5:11–16). Paul says that only ''one man women'' older than 60 years can make the list of Christian widows, but that younger widows should remarry to hinder sin. Some conclude that by requiring leaders of the Church be ''one woman men,'' Saint Paul excluded remarried widowers from having influence. This would have been a more strict understanding of [[monogamy]] than [[Roman law]] codified, and would have been a new and unusual demand on men.

On this subject William Luck writes:
{{quote|Thus it is most probable that the qualifications list sees the "husband of one wife" as a condemnation of porneia—unlawful sex, though doubtless the clause also prohibited adultery—sex with someone else’s wife, polygyny was out of sight and mind. The issue is not the number of covenant relations the man had—he would only have had one at a time, since the empire was monogamous—but his womanizing. This of course does not eliminate the grievous sin of marrying and divorcing in order to have sexual relations with a number of women. But that too is not the issue in polygyny.&lt;ref name="Luck2009" /&gt;}}

==Early Church period==
{{see also|Marriage in ancient Rome}}
Jewish polygamy clashed with Roman monogamy at the time of the [[early church]]:
{{quote|"When the Christian Church came into being, polygamy was still practiced by the Jews. It is true that we find no references to it in the New Testament; and from this some have inferred that it must have fallen into disuse, and that at the time of our Lord the Jewish people had become monogamous. But the conclusion appears to be unwarranted. [[Josephus]] in two places speaks of polygamy as a recognized institution: and [[Justin Martyr]] makes it a matter of reproach to [[Dialogue with Trypho|Trypho]] that the Jewish teachers permitted a man to have several wives. Indeed when in 212 A.D. the [[Constitutio Antoniniana|lex Antoniana de civitate]] gave the rights of Roman Citizenship to great numbers of Jews, it was found necessary to tolerate polygamy among them, even though it was against Roman law for a citizen to have more than one wife. In 285 A.D. a constitution of [[Diocletian]] and [[Maximian]] interdicted polygamy to all subjects of the empire without exception. But with the Jews, at least, the enactment failed of its effect; and in 393 A.D. a special law was issued by [[Theodosius I|Theodosius]] to compel the Jews to relinquish this national custom. Even so they were not induced to conform."&lt;ref name="Joyce2007" /&gt;{{rp|560}} }}

[[Tertullian]], who lived at the turn of the 2nd and 3rd centuries, wrote that marriage is lawful, but [[polygamy]] is not: 
{{quote|"We do not indeed forbid the union of man and woman, blest by God as the seminary of the human race, and devised for the replenishment of the earth and the furnishing of the world and therefore permitted, yet singly. For Adam was the one husband of Eve, and Eve his one wife, one woman, one rib."   {{sfn|Tertullian|1885|loc=[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Ante-Nicene_Fathers/Volume_IV/Tertullian:_Part_Fourth/To_His_Wife/I/Chapter_2 Vol. 4, Ch. 2]}} }}

The 3rd century [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] wrote the [[lost work]] "On the Numerous Progeny of the Ancients". Eusebius references this twice, in the ''Præparatio Evangelica'',&lt;ref name="Eusebius1903" /&gt; and in the ''Demonstratio Evangelica''.&lt;ref name="Eusebius1920" /&gt; Although his work has been given as an example of plural marriage being reconciled with the ascetic life, the problem dealt with was the contrast presented by the desire of the Patriarchs for numerous offspring and the honour in which continence was held by Christians.&lt;ref name="CE1913a" /&gt;

[[St. Basil|Basil of Caesarea]] wrote in the 4th century of plural marriage that "such a state is no longer called marriage but polygamy or, indeed, a moderate fornication."&lt;ref name= "Shea1996" /&gt; He ordered that those who are engaged in it should be excommunicated for up to five years, and "only after they have shown some fruitful repentance"&lt;ref name= "Shea1996" /&gt; were they to be allowed back into the church. Moreover, he stated that the teachings against plural marriage are "accepted as our usual practice, not from the canons but in conformity with our predecessors."&lt;ref name= "Shea1996" /&gt;
[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] wrote in the second half of the 4th century that
{{quote|"That the good purpose of marriage, however, is better promoted by one husband with one wife, than by a husband with several wives, is shown plainly enough by the very first union of a married pair, which was made by the Divine Being Himself."{{sfn|Augustine of Hippo|1885|p=}} }} and "The Sacrament of marriage of our time has been so reduced to one man and one wife, as that it is not lawful to ordain any as a steward of the Church, save the husband of one wife."&lt;ref name="CE1913b" /&gt;

[[Socrates of Constantinople]] wrote in the 5th century that the Roman Emperor [[Valentinian I]] took two wives and authorized his subjects to take two wives, supporting that Christians were then practicing plural marriage.&lt;ref name="Gage1893" /&gt;{{rp|[https://archive.org/stream/womanchurchstate00gagerich#page/398/mode/2up/search/polygamy 398]}} There is no trace of such an edict in any of the extant Roman Laws. Valentinian I divorced his first wife according to [[John Malalas]], the [[Chronicon Paschale]] and [[John of Nikiu]], before marrying his mistress, which was viewed as bigamy by Socrates, since the Church did not accept [[Christian views on divorce|divorce]].

[[Justin Martyr]], [[Irenaeus]] and [[Tertullian]] all spoke against polygamy, condemning it. Tertullian explicitly tackled the objection that polygamy was allowed for the patriarchs. He wrote, "each pronouncement and arrangement is (the act) of one and the same God; who did then indeed, in the beginning, send forth a sowing of the race by an indulgent laxity granted to the reins of connubial alliances, until the world should be replenished, until the material of the new discipline should attain to forwardness: now, however, at the extreme boundaries of the times, has checked (the command) which He had sent out, and recalled the indulgence which He had granted". (''De Monogamia'' chapt. VI.) According to chapter XVI of ''De Monogamia'', Hermogenes thought it was allowed for a man to take several wives.{{sfn|Tertullian|1885|loc=[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Ante-Nicene_Fathers/Volume_IV/Tertullian:_Part_Fourth/On_Exhortation_to_Chastity/Chapter_7 Vol IV, Ch. 7]}} Tertullian also made a direct attack on the polygamous practice of some cults in his work ''Adversus Hermogenem''. This is the same Hermogenes mentioned above. Tertullian writes that he was a sect leader, who mixed Stoic, Gnostic and Christian views to create a new religion.

==Middle Ages==
The Church held a [[Council of Hertford|synod in Hertford]], England, in 673 that was supervised by [[Theodore of Tarsus|Archbishop Theodore]]. Chapter 10 issued by the synod declared that marriage is allowed between one man and one woman, and [[Legal separation|separation]] (but not divorce) is only granted in the case of adultery, but even then remarriage is not allowed.&lt;ref name="Bede1903" /&gt;

In the medieval period, multiple wives were often obtained through kidnapping. It is with this in view that we must interpret the following laws: The Frankish Laws of 818–9 strictly forbade [[Bride kidnapping|kidnapping of women]].&lt;ref name="Závodszky1904" /&gt; The XXVII. law issued by King [[Stephen I of Hungary]] (1000–1030) declares that the kidnapper must return the woman to her parents even if he has had sexual intercourse with her, and must pay a penalty to the parents. According to the Hungarian law, the kidnapped girl was then free to marry whomever.&lt;ref name="Závodszky1904" /&gt;

The Roman councils of 1052 and 1063 suspended from communion those laymen who had a wife and a concubine at the same time.&lt;ref name="EB1911" /&gt; Divorce was also forbidden, and remarriage after a divorce counted as polygamy. [[Nicholas the Great]] (858–67) forbade [[Lothair II of Lotharingia]] to divorce his barren wife [[Teutberga]] and marry his concubine Waldrada, with whom he had several children. After a council of the Lotharingian bishops, as well as the [[archbishop]] of Köln and Trier had annulled his marriage to Theutberga, the pope voided this decision, and made him take his wife back.&lt;ref name="Szántó1988" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sdralek1881" /&gt;

In Scandinavia, the word for an official concubine was "frille". Norwegian Bishop [[Øystein Erlendsson]] (ca. 1120–1188) declared that concubines were not allowed to accept the sacraments unless they married, and men were forced to promise marriage to women they had lain with outside of wedlock. In 1280, the Norwegian king [[Eirik Magnusson]] (1280–99) declared that men were exempted from having to promise marriage to the frille if they went to confession and did penance. The Church answered by making several declarations in the 14th century, urging men to marry their concubines. In 1305, King [[Håkon V]] (1299–1319) issued a law that declared marriage to be the only lawful way of cohabitation, and declared that only women in wedlock were allowed to dress as they pleased, while the dress of concubines was restricted.&lt;ref name="Bagge1998" /&gt;

==Reformation period==
When asked for an opinion on polygamy in 1526,  Luther wrote, "It is my earnest warning and counsel that Christians especially shall have no more than one wife, not only because it is a scandal, which a Christian should avoid most diligently, but also because there is no word of God here to show that God approves it in Christians.... I must oppose it, especially in Christians, unless there be need, as for instance if the wife be a leper, or be taken away from the husband in some other way."

Monogamy was the norm among Christians,&lt;ref name="Doernberg1961" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Swan2009" /&gt; However, in the context of the sickness of a wife preventing matrimonial intercourse,&lt;ref name="Grisar1916" /&gt; the founder of the [[Protestant Reformation]], [[Martin Luther]] wrote: "I confess that I cannot forbid a person to marry several wives, for it does not contradict the Scripture. If a man wishes to marry more than one wife he should be asked whether he is satisfied in his conscience that he may do so in accordance with the word of God. In such a case the civil authority has nothing to do in the matter."&lt;ref&gt;Luter, Martin. De Wette II, 459, ibid., pp. 329–330.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arthur Cushman McGiffert]] also states,
{{Quote|"Some of the radical Anabaptists undertook to introduce polygamy, appealing to the patriarchal order of society in justification of their position. Even among Luther's followers and associates there was no little uncertainty about the matter, as was not altogether surprising when the old order of things was undergoing revision at so many points, including the marriage of monks, priests, and near relatives. But Luther himself was unalterably opposed to any such revolution. Monogamy he considered, under ordinary circumstances, alone tolerable in a Christian community, and held that no Christian ruler has any moral right to legalize polygamy. At the same time, finding no explicit prohibition in the Bible, he believed exceptions might be allowed in certain extreme cases such as are now generally recognized in Protestant countries as justifying divorce."&lt;ref name="McGiffert1911" /&gt;}}

Lutheran theologians approved of [[Philip of Hesse]]'s polygamous marriages to [[Christine of Saxony]] and [[Margarethe von der Saale]] for this purpose, as well as initial disapproval of divorce and adultery. As well as Phillip, there was much experimentation with marital duration within early German Lutheranism amongst clergy and their erstwhile wives.&lt;ref name="Plummer2009" /&gt;
The theologian [[Philipp Melanchthon]] likewise counseled that [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] need not risk [[schism (religion)|schism]] by dissolving his union with the established churches to grant himself divorces in order to replace his barren wives, but reluctantly, and with remorse afterward, consented that polygamy was an allowable alternative.&lt;ref name="Durant1980" /&gt;

[[Anabaptist]] leader [[Bernhard Rothmann]] initially opposed the idea of plural marriage. However, he later wrote a theological defense of plural marriage, and took nine wives himself, saying "God has restored the true practice of holy matrimony amongst us."&lt;ref name="Lindberg2000" /&gt;{{rp|141}} [[Franz von Waldeck]] and the other enemies of Anabaptist leader [[John of Leiden]] accused him of keeping 16 wives, and publicly beheading one when she disobeyed him. This was used as the basis for their conquest of [[Münster]] in 1535.&lt;ref name="Kautsky1897" /&gt;

The 16th-century Italian [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin monk]], [[Bernardino Ochino]], 77 years old and never married, wrote the "Thirty Dialogues", wherein Dialog XXI was considered a defense of plural marriage. Evidently, he borrowed some of his strongest arguments from a [[Lutheran]] dialogue written in 1541 in favor of plural marriage which was written under the fictitious name ''Huldericus Necobulus'' in the interest of justifying [[Philip of Hesse]].&lt;ref name="Ochini1563" /&gt;

A different position was taken by the [[Council of Trent]] in 1563, which was opposed to polygyny&lt;ref name=" Waterworth1848" /&gt;{{rp|[http://history.hanover.edu/texts/trent/ct24.html p194]}} and [[concubinage]], If anyone says that it is lawful for Christians to have several wives at the same time, and that it is not forbidden by any divine law (Matt. 19:4f): let him be [[anathema]]".&lt;ref name=" Waterworth1848" /&gt;{{rp|[http://history.hanover.edu/texts/trent/ct24.html 202–203]}} The polemicist [[John Milton]] expressed support for polygamy in his ''[[De Doctrina Christiana (Milton)|De doctrina christiana]]''.&lt;ref name="Milton2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller1974" /&gt;

The Lutheran pastor Johann Lyser strongly defended plural marriage in a work entitled "Polygamia Triumphatrix".&lt;ref name="Gage1893" /&gt;{{rp|[https://archive.org/stream/womanchurchstate00gagerich#page/398/mode/2up/search/polygamy 398]}} As a result, he was imprisoned, beaten and exiled from Italy to the Netherlands. His book was burned by the public executioner.&lt;ref name= "Ditchfield1895" /&gt; He never married nor desired wedlock.&lt;ref name= "Ditchfield1895" /&gt; Samuel Friedrich Willenberg, a doctor of law at the University of Cracow wrote the pro-plural marriage book ''De finibus polygamiae licitae''. In 1715, his book was ordered to be burned. Friedrich escaped with his life, but was fined one hundred thousand gold pieces.&lt;ref name= "Ditchfield1895" /&gt;

One of the more notable published works regarding the modern concept of Christian Plural Marriage dates from the 18th century. The book ''Thelyphthora''&lt;ref name="Madan1780" /&gt; was written by [[Martin Madan]], a significant writer of hymns and a contemporary of [[John Wesley]] and [[Charles Wesley]]. Although Madan was an adherent only of polygyny in a Christian context, this particular volume set the foundation of what is considered the modern Christian Plural Marriage movement.

==Modern period==
===Catechism of the Catholic Church===

2387 The predicament of a man who, desiring to convert to the Gospel, is obliged to repudiate one or more wives with whom he has shared years of conjugal life, is understandable. However polygamy is not in accord with the moral law." [Conjugal] communion is radically contradicted by polygamy; this, in fact, directly negates the plan of God which was revealed from the beginning, because it is contrary to the equal personal dignity of men and women who in matrimony give themselves with a love that is total and therefore unique and exclusive." The Christian who has previously lived in polygamy has a grave duty in justice to honor the obligations contracted in regard to his former wives and his children.{{sfn|Catholic Church|2000|p=[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a6.htm 560]}}

2400 Adultery, divorce, polygamy, and free union are grave offenses against the dignity of marriage.{{sfn|Catholic Church|2000|p=[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a6.htm 560]}}

===Lutheran Church===
The [[Lutheran World Federation]] hosted a regional conference in Africa, in which the acceptance of polygamists into full membership by the Lutheran Church in Liberia was defended as being permissible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Deressa|first=Yonas |title=The Ministry of the Whole Person|year=1973|publisher=Gudina Tumsa Foundation|language=English|page=350}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lutheran Church in Liberia, however, does not permit polygamists who have become Christians to marry more wives after they have received the sacrament of [[Baptism|Holy Baptism]].&lt;ref name="KilbridePage2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kilbride|first1=Philip Leroy|last2=Page|first2=Douglas R.|title=Plural Marriage for Our Times: A Reinvented Option?|accessdate=14 October 2018|year=2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|language=English|isbn=9780313384783|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evangelical Lutheran missionaries in Maasai also tolerate the practice of polygamy and in Southern Sudan, some polygamists are becoming Lutheran Christians.&lt;ref name="Moses2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mlenga|first=Moses|title=Polygamy in Northern Malawi: A Christian Reassessment|accessdate=14 October 2018|date=13 January 2016|publisher=Mzuni Press|language=English|isbn=9789996045097|pages=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anglican Communion=== 
Polygamy was first discussed during the [[Lambeth Conference]] of 1888:
:"That it is the opinion of this Conference that persons living in polygamy be not admitted to baptism, but they may be accepted as candidates and kept under Christian instruction until such time as they shall be in a position to accept the law of Christ. That the wives of polygamists may, in the opinion of this Conference, be admitted in some cases to baptism, but that it must be left to the local authorities of the Church to decide under what circumstances they may be baptized." (Resolution 5).

A resolution dated 1958 and numbered 120 states that:
:"(a) The Conference bears witness to the truth that monogamy is the divine will, testified by the teaching of Christ himself, and therefore true for every race of men,"
but adds:
:"(d) The Conference, recognising that the problem of polygamy is bound up with the limitations of opportunities for women in society, urges that the Church should make every effort to advance the status of women in every possible way, especially in the sphere of education."&lt;ref name="Lambeth1958/120" /&gt;

The Twelfth [[Lambeth Conference]] held in 1988, in '''Resolution 26 - Church and Polygamy''' stated:

This Conference upholds monogamy as God's plan, and as the ideal relationship of love between husband and wife; nevertheless recommends that a polygamist who responds to the Gospel and wishes to join the [[Anglican Church]] may be baptized and confirmed with his believing wives and children on the following conditions:

# that the polygamist shall promise not to marry again as long as any of his wives at the time of his conversion are alive;
# that the receiving of such a polygamist has the consent of the local Anglican community;
# that such a polygamist shall not be compelled to put away any of his wives, on account of the social deprivation they would suffer;&lt;ref name="Lambeth1988" /&gt;

In 2008 the Lambeth Conference noted:
:"In the case of polygamy, there is a universal standard – it is understood to be a sin, therefore polygamists are not admitted to positions of leadership including Holy Orders, nor after acceptance of the Gospel can a convert take another wife, nor, in some areas, are they admitted to Holy Communion."&lt;ref name="Lambeth2008" /&gt;

===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===
{{Main|Mormonism and polygamy|1890 Manifesto}}
Polygamy (called "plural marriage" by [[Mormons]] in the 19th century or "the Principle" by modern [[Mormon fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] practitioners)  was taught by leaders of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church)&lt;ref name="LDS1" /&gt; and practiced publicly from 1852 to 1890.  On September 24, 1890, [[Wilford Woodruff]], the [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|president]] of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints at that time, issued the 1890 Manifesto, which advised church members against entering into any marriage prohibited by the law of the land, and made it possible for [[Utah]] to become a [[U.S. state]]. Nevertheless, even after the Manifesto, the church quietly continued to perform a small number of plural marriages in the United States, Mexico, and Canada,{{efn|The ledger of 'marriages and sealings performed outside the temple,' which is not comprehensive, lists 315 marriages performed between October 17, 1890, and September 8, 1903.36 Of the 315 marriages recorded in the ledger, research indicates that 25 (7.9%) were plural marriages and 290 were monogamous marriages (92.1%). Almost all the monogamous marriages recorded were performed in Arizona or Mexico. Of the 25 plural marriages, 18 took place in Mexico, 3 in Arizona, 2 in Utah, and 1 each in Colorado and on a boat on the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref name="LDS2" /&gt;}}&gt;&lt;ref name="Quinn1985" /&gt; thus necessitating a [[Second Manifesto]] during [[Reed Smoot hearings|U.S. congressional hearings]] in 1904. Although neither Manifesto dissolved existing plural marriages, plural marriage in the LDS Church gradually died by attrition during the early 1900s. The Manifesto was canonized in the LDS Church [[standard works]]  as Official  Declaration 1&lt;ref name="Flake2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Embry1994" /&gt; and is considered by mainstream [[Mormonism|Mormons]] to have been prompted by divine revelation, in which Woodruff was shown that the church would be thrown into turmoil if they did not comply with it.&lt;ref name="LDS1" /&gt; [[Mormon fundamentalism|Mormon fundamentalists]] dispute that Woodruff received any such revelation.

Interviewed by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine about his book, [[Michael Coogan]] said that, from a strict [[Biblical literalism|literalist]] view, [[Mormon fundamentalism|fundamentalist Mormons]] are right about polygamy.{{efn|So the fundamentalist Mormons who insist that polygamy is biblical are right, in a sense. If you're going to be a strict literalist, there's nothing wrong with polygamy.&lt;ref name="Silver2010" /&gt;}}

===Other views===
William Luck states that polygyny is not prohibited by the Bible and that it would have been required of a married man who seduced (Ex. 22) or raped (Deut. 22) a virgin, where her father did not veto a marriage.&lt;ref name="Luck2009" /&gt;

However, in a book-length consideration of the problem, William Blum argues that monogamy was always God's ideal.&lt;ref name="Blum1989" /&gt; He points out that in every Old Testament example where polygynous families were described in any detail, family strife involving the plural wives is also described. He argues that the concept of two becoming one flesh makes polygamy a violation of God's plan for marriage.

On August 29, 2017, the [[Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood]] released a manifesto on human sexuality known as the "Nashville Statement". The statement was signed by 150 evangelical leaders, and includes 14 points of belief.&lt;ref name="Meyer2017a" /&gt; Among other things, it states, "We deny that God has designed marriage to be a homosexual, polygamous, or polyamorous relationship."&lt;ref name="Meyer2017b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mikelionis2017" /&gt;

===Exceptions in Africa===
* [[John Colenso]], the [[Anglican]] [[Anglican Diocese of Natal|bishop of Natal]], South Africa in 1853, was the first to write down the [[Zulu language]]. He championed the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] way of life, including plural marriage.&lt;ref name="Colenso1855" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Colenso, John William |volume=6 |page=666}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Nigerian [[Celestial Church of Christ]] allows clergy and laymen to keep multiple wives.
* In Liberia, the Lutheran Church began allowing plural marriage in the 1970s.&lt;ref name ="Brown1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ritchie2001" /&gt;
* The [[African initiated church|African instituted]] Harrist Church, started in 1913,&lt;ref name ="Brown1998" /&gt;  permit those already in polygamous marriages to convert and join their church without having to renounce their multiple marriages.
* [[Mswati III]], the Christian [[List of monarchs of Swaziland|king of Swaziland]], has 15 wives.

[[File:0 Académie des Sciences - Casina Pio IV.JPG|right|thumb|[[Casina Pio IV]], home of the academy]]
The '''Pontifical Academy of Sciences''' ({{lang-it|Pontificia accademia delle scienze}}, {{lang-la|Pontificia Academia Scientiarum}}) is a [[Academy of sciences|scientific academy]] of the [[Vatican City]], established in 1936 by [[Pope Pius XI]], and thriving with the blessing of the [[Pope|Papacy]] ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casinapioiv.va/content/accademia/en/magisterium.html|title=Magisterium|website=www.casinapioiv.va}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its aim is to promote the progress of the mathematical, physical, and natural sciences and the study of related [[epistemology|epistemological]] problems. The Academy has its origins in the Accademia Pontificia dei Nuovi Lincei ("Pontifical Academy of the New Lynxes"), founded in 1847 as a more closely supervised successor to the [[Accademia dei Lincei]] ("Academy of Lynxes") established in Rome in 1603 by the learned Roman Prince, [[Federico Cesi]] (1585–1630), who was a young botanist and naturalist, and which claimed [[Galileo Galilei]] as its president. The Accademia dei Lincei survives as a wholly separate institution.&lt;ref name=sola&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=it&amp;u=https://w2.vatican.va/content/pius-xi/it/motu_proprio/documents/hf_p-xi_motu-proprio_19361028_multis-solaciis.html&amp;prev=search|title=Google Translate|website=translate.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy of Sciences, one of the [[Pontifical academy|Pontifical academies]] at the Vatican in Rome, is headquartered in the [[Casina Pio IV]] in the heart of the [[Vatican Gardens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casinapioiv.va/content/accademia/en/about/casina.html|title=Casina Pio IV|website=www.casinapioiv.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The academy holds a membership roster of the most respected names in 20th century science, including such [[Nobel laureates]] as [[Ernest Rutherford]], [[Max Planck]], [[Otto Hahn]], [[Niels Bohr]], [[Erwin Schrödinger]], and [[Charles Hard Townes]].

==History==
[[File:Courtyard of the Casina Pio IV.jpg|thumb|Academy courtyard]]

Cesi wanted his academicians to adhere to a research methodology based upon observation, experimentation, and the inductive method. He thus called his academy "dei lincei" because its members had "eyes as sharp as [[lynx]]es," scrutinizing nature at both microscopic and macroscopic levels. The leader of the first academy was the famous scientist [[Galileo Galilei]].

Academy of Lynxes was dissolved after the death of its founder, but was re-created by [[Pope Pius IX]] in 1847 and given the name Accademia Pontificia dei Nuovi Lincei ("Pontifical Academy of the New Lynxes"). It was later re-founded in 1936 by [[Pope Pius XI]] and given its current name. [[Pope Paul VI]] in 1976 and [[Pope John Paul II]] in 1986 subsequently updated its statutes.

Since 1936, the Pontifical Academy of Sciences has been concerned both with investigating specific scientific subjects belonging to individual disciplines and with the promotion of interdisciplinary co-operation. It has progressively increased the number of its academicians and the international character of its membership. The Academy is an independent body within the Holy See and enjoys freedom of research. The statutes of 1976 express its goal: "The Pontifical Academy of Sciences has as its goal the promotion of the progress of the mathematical, physical, and natural sciences, and the study of related epistemological questions and issues."&lt;ref name=sola/&gt;

==Activities==
[[Image:Pontifical Academy of Sciences, Vatican - entrance.jpg|thumb|Academy entrance]]
Since the Academy and its membership is not influenced by factors of a national, political, or religious character it represents a valuable source of objective scientific information which is made available to the Holy See and to the international scientific community. Today the work of the Academy covers six main areas:

*fundamental science
*the science and technology of global questions and issues
*science in favor of the problems of the Third World
*the ethics and politics of science
*bioethics
*epistemology

The disciplines involved are sub-divided into eight fields: the disciplines of physics and related disciplines; astronomy; chemistry; the earth and environmental sciences; the life sciences (botany, agronomy, zoology, genetics, molecular biology, biochemistry, the neurosciences, surgery); mathematics; the applied sciences; and the philosophy and history of sciences.

Principal among the many publications produced by the Academy are:
* '''Acta''' – proceedings of the Plenary Sessions
* '''Scripta Varia''' – major works such as full reports on Study Weeks &amp; Working Groups held at the Academy; some, due to their special importance, have been taken up by foreign publishers
* '''Documenta &amp; Extra Series''' – for quick publication of summaries and conclusions of Study Weeks and Working Groups; also for rapid diffusion of Papal addresses to the Academy, and of significant documents such as the "Declaration on the Prevention of Nuclear War"
* '''Commentarii''' – notes and memoirs as well as special studies on scientific subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casinapioiv.va/content/accademia/en/publications.html|title=Publications|website=www.casinapioiv.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the goal of promoting scientific research, the Pius XI Medal is awarded by the Academy every two years to a young scientist who is under the age of 45 and shows exceptional promise. A few of the winners have also become members of the Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casinapioiv.va/content/accademia/en/about/medal.html|title=Pius XI Medal|website=www.casinapioiv.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals and hopes of the Academy==
The goals and hopes of the Academy were expressed by [[Pope Pius XI]] in the ''[[motu proprio]] "In multis solaciis"'' which brought about its re-foundation in 1936:

:"Amongst the many consolations with which divine Goodness has wished to make happy the years of our Pontificate, I am happy to place that of our having being able to see not a few of those who dedicate themselves to the studies of the sciences mature their attitude and their intellectual approach towards religion. Science, when it is real cognition, is never in contrast with the truth of the Christian faith. Indeed, as is well known to those who study the history of science, it must be recognized on the one hand that the Roman Pontiffs and the Catholic Church have always fostered the research of the learned in the experimental field as well, and on the other hand that such research has opened up the way to the defense of the deposit of supernatural truths entrusted to the Church.... We promise again that it is our strongly-held intention, that the 'Pontifical Academicians', through their work and our Institution, work ever more and ever more effectively for the progress of the sciences. Of them we do not ask anything else, since this praiseworthy intent and this noble work in the service of the truth is what we expect of them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casinapioiv.va/content/accademia/en/magisterium/piusxi.html|title=Pius XI|website=www.casinapioiv.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forty years later (10 November 1979), [[John Paul II]] once again emphasized the role and goals of the Academy, on the 100th anniversary (centenary) of the birth of [[Albert Einstein]]:

:"The existence of this Pontifical Academy of Sciences, of which in its ancient ancestry Galileo was a member and of which today eminent scientists are members, without any form of ethnic or religious discrimination, is a visible sign, raised amongst the peoples of the world, of the profound harmony that can exist between the truths of science and the truths of faith.... The Church of Rome together with all the Churches spread throughout the world attributes a great importance to the function of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences. The title of 'Pontifical' given to the Academy means, as you know, the interest and the commitment of the Church, in different forms from the ancient patronage, but no less profound and effective in character.... How could the Church have lacked interest in the most noble of the occupations which are most strictly human – the search for truth?"&lt;ref name=jpii&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/JP2ALEIN.HTM|title=On the Centenary of the Birth of Albert Einstein|website=www.ewtn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Both believing scientists and non-believing scientists are involved in deciphering the palimpsest of nature which has been built in a rather complex way, where the traces of the different stages of the long evolution of the world have been covered over and mixed up. The believer, perhaps, has the advantage of knowing that the puzzle has a solution, that the underlying writing is in the final analysis the work of an intelligent being, and that thus the problem posed by nature has been posed to be solved and that its difficulty is without doubt proportionate to the present or future capacity of humanity. This, perhaps, will not give him new resources for the investigation engaged in. But it will contribute to maintaining him in that healthy optimism without which a sustained effort cannot be engaged in for long."&lt;ref name=jpii/&gt;

On 8 November 2012 [[Pope Benedict XVI]] told members of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences:
:"Dialogue and cooperation between faith and science are urgently needed for building a culture that respects people and the planet.... Without faith and science informing each other, the great questions of humanity leave the domain of reason and truth, and are abandoned to the irrational, to myth, or to indifference, with great damage to humanity itself, to world peace and to our ultimate destiny.... (As people strive to) unlock the mysteries of man and the universe, I am convinced of the urgent need for continued dialogue and cooperation between the worlds of science and of faith in building a culture of respect for man, for human dignity and freedom, for the future of our human family, and for the long-term sustainable development of our planet."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic-sf.org/news_select.php&amp;newsid=27&amp;id=58007/printer_friendly.php?id=60725 Benedict XVI] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170207162813/http://www.catholic-sf.org/news_select.php%26newsid%3D27%26id%3D58007/printer_friendly.php?id=60725 |date=7 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==
The new members of the Academy are elected by the body of Academicians and chosen from men and women of every race and religion based on the high scientific value of their activities and their high moral profile. They are then officially appointed by the Roman Pontiff. The Academy is governed by a President, appointed from its members by the Pope, who is helped by a scientific Council and by the Chancellor. Initially made up of 80 Academicians, 70 who were appointed for life. In 1986 [[John Paul II]] raised the number of members for life to 80, side by side with a limited number of Honorary Academicians chosen because they are highly qualified figures, and others who are Academicians because of the posts they hold, including: the Chancellor of the Academy, the Director of the [[Vatican Observatory]], the Prefect of the [[Vatican Apostolic Library]], and the Prefect of the [[Vatican Secret Archives]].

===President===
The president of the Academy is appointed from its members by the Pope. The current president is [[Joachim Von Braun]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/it/bollettino/pubblico/2017/06/21/0435/00975.html|title=Rinunce e nomine|website=press.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt; as of June 21, 2017. who takes over from Nobel laureate [[Werner Arber]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/world/view/20110116-314700/Vatican-appoints-Protestant-as-scientific-bodys-head|title=Vatican appoints Protestant|website=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006194546/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/world/view/20110116-314700/Vatican-appoints-Protestant-as-scientific-bodys-head|archivedate=6 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; who is a Nobel Prize Laureate and was the first Protestant to hold the position.

The '''Principality of Khuttal''', (also spelled ''Khatlan'' and ''Khotlan''), was a local [[Iranian people|Iranian]] dynasty, which ruled the [[Khuttal]] region from the early 7th century to 750. The rulers of the region were known by their titles of “Khuttalan Shah” (king of Khuttal), “Khuttalan Khudah” (lord of Khuttal), and “Shir-i Khutallan” (lion of Khuttal).{{sfn|Bosworth|2009}} The capital and residence of the rulers was in Hulbuk, close to the city of [[Kulob]].{{sfn|Bosworth|2009}}

== History ==
Khuttal, along with other regions, was originally under [[Hephthalite]] rule, but as the Hephthalite kingdom began to weaken, local dynasties in Khuttal, [[Chaghaniyan]], and other regions, began to assert their rule over them. In ca. 676, [[Sa'id ibn 'Uthman]], the [[Umayyad]] [[Arabs|Arab]] governor of [[Khurasan]], managed to make the principality of Khuttal acknowledge Muslim authority.{{sfn|Gibb|1923|p=20}} However, this did not effect actual Arab rule over Khuttal and the principality remained independent. In ca. 699, a Khuttalan pretender who was the paternal cousin of the Khuttalan king, known in [[Arabic]] sources as [[al-Sabal]], fled to the Arab general [[al-Muhallab ibn Abi Suffrah]], and urged him to invade the principality. The latter agreed, provided the pretender with an army to invade the region, and sent another army under his son [[Yazid ibn al-Muhallab]]. However, al-Sabal managed to make a surprise attack on the Khuttalan pretender, and had him executed at his fortress. Yazid shortly after besieged the fortress, but made peace with al-Sabal in return for a ransom of money. In 727, another Arab general, [[Asad ibn Abdallah al-Qasri]], invaded Khuttal, but al-Sabal called upon the [[Turkic people|Turkic]] [[Turgesh]] for aid, who, under their ''[[khagan]]'' [[Suluk (Turgesh khagan)|Suluk]], won a decisive victory over Asad in the so-called "[[Day of Thirst]]".

Al-Sabal, shortly before his death, appointed a Khuttalan nobleman known in Arabic sources as [[Ibn al-Sa'iji]] as the regent of his principality until his son, known in Arabic sources as al-Hanash, and in [[Tang dynasty|Chinese]] sources as Lo-kin-tsie, who had fled to China, returned to Khuttal.{{sfn|Gibb|1923|pp=81–82}} Ibn al-Sa'iji is mentioned in supporting and having made an alliance with the Arab military leader [[al-Harith ibn Surayj]] during his rebellion in Khurasan, but the two soon quarrelled and Harith withdrew with his followers into [[Tokharistan]].{{sfn|Gibb|1923|p=77}} Because of this, in 737 Asad, once more governor of Khurasan, carried out another invasion of Khuttal, which made Ibn al-Sa'iji, like his predecessor, call upon the Turgesh for aid. The ''khagan'' Suluk, at the head of an army numbering 50,000 men, attacked Asad, and [[Battle of the Baggage|inflicted a heavy defeat on him]] (30 September 737).{{sfn|Gibb|1923|pp=81–82}}{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|pp=180–181}} However, later in the same year, Asad managed to inflict a [[Battle of Kharistan|heavy defeat]] on Suluk, who barely escaped capture and was forced to retire north to his lands. There he was soon after murdered by his rivals, leading to the collapse of Turgesh power amid civil war.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|pp=181–182}}{{sfn|Gibb|1923|pp=83–85}} In the aftermath of the battle, a certain prince named Badr Tarkhan, who may have been the ruler of [[Bamiyan]], conquered Khuttal. Thereupon Asad invaded Khuttal and forced the principality to acknowledge Umayyad authority.

In 750, the Umayyad Caliphate fell, and was replaced by the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], who, under their general [[Abu Muslim Khorasani]], sent Abu Dawud Khalid ibn Ibrahim, the governor of [[Balkh]], to invade the region and bring it under direct Abbasid rule. When Abu Dawud invaded Khuttal, its ruler, known in Arabic sources as Hanash ibn al-Subul (also called Hubaysh ibn al-Shibl) did not resist the invasion, but the ''[[dehqan]]s'' of Khuttal forcibly detained him and carried him to a fortress in order to fight Abu Dawud. Nevertheless, Abu Dawud managed to make Hanash and his ''dehqans'' leave the fortress. Hanash shortly fled to the court of the Turks, and then to the Chinese court, while Abu Dawud consolidated Abbasid rule in Khuttal, marking the end of the principality.{{sfn|Bosworth|2009}}{{sfn|Gibb|1923|p=95}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1986|pp=75-76}}

'''Raphael Judah (R.J.) Zwi Werblowsky''' ({{lang-he|רפאל יהודה צבי ורבלובסקי}}; 1924, Frankfurt — July 9, 2015, Jerusalem) was an Israeli scholar of religion specializing in [[comparative religion]] and [[interfaith dialogue]]. Werblowsky served as Dean of the Faculty of Humanities at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] between 1965—1969, Secretary-General and later Vice-President of the International Association for the History of Religions, Vice-President of the International Council for Philosophy and the Humanities of UNESCO and the chief editor of the journal [[Numen (journal)|''Numen'']]. He also co-edited The Encyclopedia of the Jewish Religion. In 2005 R.J. Zvi Werblowsky became a recipient of [[The EMET Prize for Art, Science and Culture]], and in 2009 he was awarded [[Order of the Rising Sun|Order of the Rising Sun, Gold Rays with Neck Ribbon]] by the government of Japan.

== Biography ==
Raphael Judah Zwi Werblowsky was born in 1924 in Frankfurt. Toward the end of the 1930s he immigrated to [[Mandatory Palestine]] and studied at several [[Yeshiva]]s there (including world-famous [[Ponevezh Yeshiva]]&lt;ref name="Stroumsa"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/15685276-12341404 |first=Guy G. |last=Stroumsa |authorlink=Guy Stroumsa |title=R.

|doi=10.1163/15685276-12341404 |pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;). He proceeded with his studies at the [[University of London]] and completed his bachelor's degree there in 1945. Following the end of World War II Werblowsky worked at an orphanage in the Netherlands which prepared Jewish children who survived the Holocaust for immigration to Palestine and later [[State of Israel]]. In 1951, he received his PhD from the [[University of Geneva]].&lt;ref name="Sarna"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://networks.h-net.org/node/28655/discussions/74702/obituary-prof-rj-zwi-werblowsky |title=Obituary: Prof. R.J.

After receiving his doctoral degree Werblowsky for five years was teaching in England (Manchester and Leeds&lt;ref name="Stroumsa" /&gt;) before returning to Israel in 1956. There he was among the founders of the Department of Comparative Religion at the [[Hebrew University in Jerusalem]]. He stayed with this institution till his retirement in 1980. Between 1965—1969 Werblowsky served as the Dean of the Faculty of Humanities at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He was also teaching as a Visiting Professor in many universities around the world.&lt;ref name="Sarna" /&gt;

In 1958 R.J. Zwi Werblowsky founded the Israel Inter-Faith Committee in Jerusalem and later founded the Jerusalem Rainbow Club which served as the place for contacts and discussions between Jewish, Muslim and Christian intellectuals. Between 1975—1985 Werblowski served as Secretary-General of the International Association for the History of Religions (IAHR), where he later assumed the position of Vice-President. Between 1984—1988 he was serving as Vice-President of the International Council for Philosophy and the Humanities of [[UNESCO]]. Werblowsky was also for many years editing [[Numen (journal)|''Numen'']], one of the leading journals in the field of [[comparative religion]]&lt;ref name="Stroumsa" /&gt; and was a coeditor of The Encyclopedia of the Jewish Religion.&lt;ref name="Sarna" /&gt;

In 2005 Zvi Werblowsky was awarded [[The EMET Prize for Art, Science and Culture]] for his contribution to the study of the religion in various cultures in Israel and for his role in promoting [[interfaith dialogue]] and the encouragement of religious tolerance in Israel and abroad.&lt;ref name="Sarna" /&gt; In 2009 he was awarded [[Order of the Rising Sun|Order of the Rising Sun, Gold Rays with Neck Ribbon]] for his contributions to the development of Japan studies in Israel and promotion of academic contacts between Japan and Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/2009/05/07/news-opinion/israel-middle-east/japan-to-honor-israeli-professor |title=Japan to honor Israeli professor |author=Marcy Oster. |publisher=Jewish Telegraph Agency |date=May 7, 2009 |accessdate=May 17, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304013927/http://www.jta.org/2009/05/07/news-opinion/israel-middle-east/japan-to-honor-israeli-professor |archivedate=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in July 2015.

The '''Ravenna [[Kibbutz]]''' is a nondenominational [[Jewish]] [[intentional community]] located in the [[Ravenna, Seattle|Ravenna]] neighborhood of [[Seattle]]. Its three rented houses and one apartment are home to 15 resident-organizers, who plan public programs such as [[Shabbat]] dinners and Jewish movie nights. In-house events are always free, though occasionally a donation jar is made available for those who wish to contribute. The Kibbutz's ideology isn't [[communistic]]; it's not a true [[Commune (intentional community)|commune]] but simply an example of [[cohousing]]. The [[Pacific Northwest]] contains many cohousing communities and a wide variety of Jewish organizations, but thus far the region has no other Jewish cohousing community.
[[File:KibbutzBonfireLagBomer.jpg|thumb|Bonfires are a popular Kibbutz event.|right]]
House [[Aleph]], the original Kibbutz house, is supported in part by the [[Moishe House]] program,&lt;ref name="jew-ish.com"&gt;[http://jew-ish.com/index.php?/stories/item/the_little_kibbutz_that_could/ "The little kibbutz that could," Jew-ish.com; retrieved 9 May 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; which offers financial and other resources to young Jews interested in hosting a certain number of public events per month. Houses [[Bet (letter)|Bet]] and [[Gimel]] are unaffiliated with Moishe House and play host to events like a monthly [[open-mic]] nights, film screenings, [[yoga]] classes, storytelling events, [[meditation]] sessions, and more.

Resident-organizers range from [[secular]] to [[Modern Orthodox]] in their [[religious]] views and vary also in their Jewish practices. Several keep [[kosher]], while others do not, and only some are [[shomer Shabbat]]. Nonetheless, all Kibbutz households maintain kosher (dairy) dishes, silverware, and other kitchen implements in addition to ''treyf'' plates and utensils that may be used to prepare non-kosher food.

== History ==
[[File:KibbutzPicnicMeal.jpg|thumb|During the warmer months, Kibbutz meals are held outside.]]
The Kibbutz was founded in the fall of 2007 by Joel Rothschild, Masha Shtern, and Tamar Libicki; Azura Newman and Lincoln Rose were also original members.&lt;ref name="jew-ish.com"/&gt; The community's first official event was a potluck dinner in October of that year. In founding the Kibbutz, Rothschild hoped to recreate aspects of his positive experience as a member of Kosher Co-op, part of the [[Oberlin Student Cooperative Association]] (OSCA) at [[Oberlin College]]. Current resident-organizer Neal Schindler also attended Oberlin and was in OSCA.

The Kibbutz acquired its second house, nicknamed Bet, in January 2009; a third house, [[Gimel]], was added in June 2009, expanding the number of resident-organizers to 16. These include Sergey Feldman, Shaul Goldberg, Dane Kuttler, Carrie Turner, Asya Vaisman, Sebastian Schulman, Zara Friedman, Rachel Stampfer, Jim Thorson, Steven Blum, Deborah Siegel, and Ilana Mantell, an employee of [[Kavana Cooperative]]. In September 2009, the Kibbutz annexed the basement of Bet to add two residents (Turner and Vaisman); two more resident-organizers (Stampfer and her partner) moved into an apartment across the street.

The '''Sanctuary of the Three Gauls ''(Tres Galliae)''''' was the focal structure within an administrative and religious complex established by Rome in the very late 1st century BC at  [[Lugdunum]] (the site of modern [[Lyon]] in France). Its institution served to federalise and Romanise [[Gallia Comata]] as an Imperial province under [[Augustus]], following the Gallic Wars of his predecessor [[Julius Caesar]].  The distinctively Gallo-Roman development of the Imperial sanctuary and its surrounding complex are well attested by literary, epigraphic, [[numismatics|numismatic]] and archaeological evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan Fishwick, "The Imperial Cult in the Latin West: Studies in the Ruler Cult of the Western Provinces of the Roman Empire", vol 3, (2002), 1, 4-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation and function==
The [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]] sanctuary at Lugdunum was the earliest and most important institution of its kind in the Western Roman empire. Its establishment at the junction of three new Imperial provinces, later collectively known as Tres Galliae (the Three Gauls), embodied a policy of integrated military, civil and religious settlement among the unstable Western provinces of the newly established [[Principate]].&lt;ref&gt;Fishwick, Vol 3, 1, 9: the term ''Tres Gallia'' dates from the reign of Vespasian.&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded by [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus]] in rapid response to a rebellion provoked by the census of [[Gallia Comata]] ("long-haired" Gaul) in 12 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Fishwick, Vol. 3, 1, 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lugdunum provided a centralised, permanent base for the Imperial governorships of [[Gallia Aquitania]], [[Gallia Belgica]] and [[Gallia Lugdunensis]], and an annual, Roman-style ''[[wikt:concilium|concilium]]'' (council) for their provincial elites, based on existing Gallic political and religious practices.&lt;ref&gt;Annual "tribal" or "civil" meetings were a long-standing feature of Gallic polity: see Caesar, ''Gallic Wars'', 4.6.5; 5.2.4; 5.24.1 ''et al''. The meetings may have been sanctified under the tutelage of Lugh: see also Maria Jaczynowska, "Une religion de la loyauté au début de l'Empire romain", in ''Dialogues d'histoire ancienne'', 15, 2, (1989), 164–5: [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/dha_0755-7256_1989_num_15_2_1850] (French).&lt;/ref&gt; The monumentally lavish and comprehensively Roman development of the Sanctuary and its associated buildings provided a context for the acculturation of a new Romano-Gallic polity under the ''[[pax Romana]]'', in which the Roman military maintained a relatively discreet local presence.&lt;ref&gt;A single urban cohort, according to Keppie, L. J. F., ''Legions and veterans: Roman army papers 1971-2000'', Franz Steiner Verlag, 2000, 84:[https://books.google.com/books?id=TLDvWqjSfP8C&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=Lugdunum+cohort&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BGl-4LdbS4&amp;sig=Z5qbT3FQAXl92kpwQ5JA2PJYmms&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=JsglStL0FdSw-Aat9vTXBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CIL XIII 1706.jpg|thumb|Inscription of Gaius Servilius Martianus, of the [[Arverni]], who served as a priest ''(sacerdos)'' at the Temple of Roma and the Augusti&lt;ref&gt;''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' XIII 001706.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

As stepson to Augustus, Drusus represented the Imperial family and as provincial governor, he was also augur.  The inaugural day of the sanctuary – August 1 of either 10 BC or 12 BC – was important to both Romans and Gauls. August – formerly ''[[Sextilis]]'' in the Roman calendar – had been renamed in honour of Augustus, and its [[kalends]] (the first day of the month) was particularly auspicious as the anniversary of his victory at Alexandria. In the Gallo-celtic calendar, the same day was sacred to the sun-god Lugh, who may have been venerated on the [[Fourvière]] hill at Lugdunum, though no temple has been found.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan Fishwick, "The Imperial cult in Roman Britain", ''Phoenix'', 15, 1961, 3, p.159: in this early work in his Imperial cult series, Fishwick finds Lugdunum's Roman establishments are grafted onto an existing ''[[eisteddfod]]'' [sic] of Lug; and to a probable traditional annual Gallic ''concilium'' as evidenced in Caesar, ''Gallic Wars'', 4.6.5; 5.2.4; 5.24.1 ''et al'': [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1086674]. In his later work on the Western Imperial cult, Fishwick is less certain of its connections with Lug.&lt;/ref&gt; As a sun-god, Lugh could be identified with Roman Sol, Apollo and the Augustan-Stoic concept of the Imperial "saviour" as the "second sun".{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}&lt;ref&gt;Caesar refers to Gallic "Mercury" as the major deity in Gallic cult. In Roman cult, Mercury sanctified oaths, contracts and treaties, but was not a major deity. The name and full attributes of his supposed Gallic counterpart are unknown: Caesar, Gallic Wars, 6.7: [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Caes.+Gal.+6.17]&lt;/ref&gt; A foundation (or an inauguration) in 12 BC would have coincided with Augustus' assumption of office as ''[[pontifex maximus]]''. The ''ara'' (altar) was dedicated to ''[[Roma (mythology)|Dea Roma]]'' and Augustus and its first high priest ''(sacerdos)'' was [[Caius Julius Vercondaridubnus]], a Gaul of the [[Aeduan]] elite. His name indicates his Roman citizenship and Gallic origins - his election to Imperial priesthood may confirm a preference based on his personal standing and that of his ''[[civitas]]'' as ''fratres'' ("brothers", or allies) of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Despite this, the Aeduian citizen-aristocrat [[Julius Sacrovir]] would be involved in a later rebellion, "seditiously" claiming - in Tacitus' account - high rates of tribute, indebtedness, and brutal governorship as causes: Tacitus, Annals, 3.40: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Tacitus/Annals/3C*.html#ref1].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duncan Fishwick, "The Imperial Cult in the Latin West: Studies in the Ruler Cult of the Western Provinces of the Roman Empire", volume 1, (1991), p. 101.,  &amp; vol 3, (2002), 1, pp 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Mellor, "The Goddess Roma," ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' 2.17.2, p. 986 [https://books.google.com/books?id=QK1M2VD1tsAC&amp;pg=RA3-PA986&amp;dq=Vercondaridubnus&amp;lr=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES  online.]: Dio Cassius, 54.32.1, and Livy, ''Periochae'', 139, give a date of 12 BC, against numismatic (and Suetonian) evidence for 10 BC. Mellor offers a scenario in which the first ''concilium'' convenes in 12 BC. The ''ara'' takes two years to complete, and is inaugurated in 10 BC – possibly in the presence of Augustus, who is known to have been in Lugdunum at that time. Fishwick favours 12 BC, partly because this is Livy's date for what was to him a contemporaneous event.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drusus invited 60 aristocratic delegates to the opening ceremony as representatives of the "Three Gauls". These are presumed to be the first members of the official ''concilium Galliarum''.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Mellor, "The Goddess Roma," ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' 2.17.2, p. 986 [https://books.google.com/books?id=QK1M2VD1tsAC&amp;pg=RA3-PA986&amp;dq=Vercondaridubnus&amp;lr=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES  online.]&lt;/ref&gt; The office of ''sacerdos'' required Roman citizenship but the early ''concilium'' combined citizen and non-citizens. The ''sacredos'' would have been a person of great consequence within the ''concilium Galliarum'' and his own provincial ''[[wikt:ordo|ordo]]''. His influence would have extended well beyond his term of office, which was - unlike the lifetime priesthoods of Rome itself - limited to a single year. In effect, the priesthood provided an important step in the provincial ''[[cursus honorum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan Fishwick, "The Imperial Cult in the Latin West: Studies in the Ruler Cult of the Western Provinces of the Roman Empire", vol 3, (2002), 1, 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Autel des Gaules pl. I – Discours sur les médailles d'Auguste et de Tibère (1820).jpg|alt= Altar of Gauls|thumb|Altar of Gauls, reconstructed from the image on Roman coins]]
The ''concilia'' at Lugdunum  were also displays of loyalty and Romanisation, which involved the renewal of vows through priestly sacrifice at the ''ara'', feasting, games (''[[ludi]]''), contests of eloquence and [[poetry]].&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, Caligula, 20; Juvenal, 1.42–44; ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]]'' II 6278.&lt;/ref&gt; This calendrical gathering was accommodated by the building of a small [[Amphitheatre of the Three Gauls|amphitheatre]], which was later much expanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Audin|first = Amable|date = 1979|title = L'amphithéâtre des Trois Gaules à Lyon – Nouvelles campagnes de fouilles (1971-1972, 1976-1978)|url = http://www.persee.fr/doc/galia_0016-4119_1979_num_37_1_1596|journal = Gallia|language = fr|volume = 37|issue = 1|pages = 85–100|access-date = 2016-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lugdunum was also the site of a major Imperial mint, whose coinage provides a principal source of evidence for the form and development of the altar. The security requirement of the mint has been presumed to account for the presence of Lugdunum's single military cohort.&lt;ref&gt;Lugdunum remained the major Western Imperial mint until some time between 37 AD and 41 AD:[https://books.google.com/books?id=HsrGEFpW80UC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;lpg=PA98&amp;dq=Lugdunum+cohort&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lXdsy2gKsx&amp;sig=_HF9ht6b1m-Qu8l61W4u8zL4P_k&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=JsglStL0FdSw-Aat9vTXBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Presence of cohort presumed as guard for mint: Keppie, L. J. F., ''Legions and veterans: Roman army papers 1971-2000'', Franz Steiner Verlag, 2000, 84:[https://books.google.com/books?id=TLDvWqjSfP8C&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=Lugdunum+cohort&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BGl-4LdbS4&amp;sig=Z5qbT3FQAXl92kpwQ5JA2PJYmms&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=JsglStL0FdSw-Aat9vTXBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later Imperial development===
Following his defeat of [[Clodius Albinus]] and his allies at Lugdunum, [[Septimius Severus]] re-founded and reformed its Imperial cult centre as an instrument of suppression and autocracy. The image of dea Roma was removed from the ara and confined to the temple, along with the images of the living and deceased Augusti –  a combination unique in the Western Empire. Fishwick interprets the reformed rites of Septimius as those offered a Roman paterfamilias by his slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Fishwick,Vol. 3, 1, 199.&lt;/ref&gt; This development took place shortly after 198/9 AD. Its duration and subsequent developments are unknown.

==Sanctuary==
The sanctuary was located on the hillside of [[la Croix-Rousse]]. The first and main altar can be reconstructed from texts and currency depictions. The geographer [[Strabo]] described it in context: "[Lugdunum] is the most populous of all the cities of Celtica except Narbo; for not only do people use it as an emporium, but the Roman governors coin their money there, both the silver and the gold. Again, the temple that was dedicated to Caesar Augustus by all the Galatae in common is situated in front of this city at the junction of the rivers. And in it is a noteworthy altar, bearing an inscription of the names of the tribes, sixty in number; and also images from these tribes, one from each tribe, and also another large altar."&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, ''[[Geography (Strabo)|Geography]]'', Thayer, Loeb edn. [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/4C*.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The temple was dedicated to the cult of deceased Imperial ''divi'', and major Roman and local deities.

This sanctuary was also the find-spot for the [[Lyon Tablet]], a bronze plaque of 2.5 by 1.93 m on which is engraved [[Claudius]]'s 48 AD speech making Gallic chieftains eligible for Roman magistracies and membership of the [[Roman Senate]] – a version of the speech also survives in [[Tacitus]]. It was found by a draper in 1528, in his vineyard on the site of the sanctuary, and is now held in the [[Gallo-Roman Museum of Lyon]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5617">[[File:Beirut protest.jpg|thumb|"The [[Laïque Pride]]" rally in [[Beirut Central District]], [[Lebanon]]]]

The secularization process in [[Lebanon]] began under a 1920s [[French Mandate of Lebanon|French mandate]], continuing under different governments since independence. Lebanon is a [[parliamentary democracy]] within an overall [[Confessionalism (politics)|confessionalist]] framework; as a form of [[consociationalism]], the highest offices are proportionately reserved for representatives from certain religious communities.

However, increasing numbers of Lebanese  organize against this confessionalist system and for an installation of [[laïcité]] in the national government.

In April 2010, Laïque Pride, a secular group co-founded by feminist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laicite-moderne.blogspot.com/2012/10/creation-dun-espace-laique-yalda-younes.html|title=Laïcité: Création d'un espace laïque - Yalda Younès|first=|last=Crab|date=31 October 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yalda Younes, called for “an end to the country's deep-rooted sectarian system” and for a “secular Lebanon.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Karen Smith |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/04/25/lebanon.rally/ |title=Thousands in Lebanon march for secularism |website=CNN.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laïque Pride supports the enacting of a unified Civil Code for the Personal Status Law.&lt;ref name="wordpress1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Local-News/2012/May-07/172558-laique-pride-marches-for-secularism-womens-rights.ashx|title=Laique Pride marches for secularism, women's rights|date=7 May 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a march in May 2012 in which 600 participated, Laïque Pride issued demands, four concerning women’s rights and two concerning media freedom.&lt;ref name="wordpress1"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://adonis49.wordpress.com/tag/lebanese-laique-pride-activist-group/ |title=Lebanese Laïque Pride activist group &amp;#124; Adonis Diaries |website=Adonis49.wordpress.com |date=2012-04-23 |accessdate=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dailystar1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Article.aspx?id=155258 |title=Lebanon begins landmark reforestation campaign |work=The Daily Star |date=26 November 2011 |accessdate=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secular student clubs from [[Saint Joseph University]] (USJ), the [[Lebanese Academy of Fine Arts]] (ALBA), as the [[American University of Beirut]] (AUB) also participated in the march.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saidaonline.com/en/news.php?go=fullnews&amp;newsid=36970|title=Laique Pride marches for secularism, women's rights|website=www.saidaonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 26, 2010, in response to [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]]'s growing appeal in Beirut and demands to re-establish an  Islamic caliphate, a  [[Laïque Pride]] march was held in [[Beirut]]. Three days later, 70,000 gathered [[Martyrs' Square, Beirut|Martyrs’ Square]] in [[Beirut]] in a march organized by Laïque Pride.

In 2011, hundreds of protesters rallied in [[Beirut]] on 27 February in a march referred to as "The [[Laicite|Laique]] pride", calling for reform of the country's [[Confessionalism (politics)|confessional]] [[Politics of Lebanon|political system]]. At the same time, a peaceful sit-in took place in [[Sidon|Saida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/egyptNews/idAFLDE71Q08L20110227 |title=Lebanese protest against sectarian political system |work=Reuters Africa|agency=Reuters|date=27 February 2011 |accessdate=6 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student organizations==
 
Student organizations have paid a key role in secular movements in Lebanon, particularly those at the [[American University of Beirut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.middleeasteye.net/columns/lebanese-establishment-and-academic-spaces-191257857|title=Fairuz, Hezbollah and the suppression of democracy on Lebanese campuses|publisher=www.middleeasteye.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One such secular origination is the Secular Club, a [[Progressivism|progressive]] student organization established after the [[2008 conflict in Lebanon|2008 conflict]]. According to former club president Joumana Talhouk, the goal of the club is “to create a political space where people from different social and sectarian backgrounds can unite under common principles.”&lt;ref name="beirutsyndrome.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beirutsyndrome.com/articles/the-struggle-of-lebanons-student-movements/|title=Account Suspended|website=www.beirutsyndrome.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another organization is the [[Far-left politics|far-left]] Red Oak Club. According to former president Theresa Sahyoun, the Red Oak Club and the  Secular Club managed to find “common ground” and endorse the August 2016  [[Martyrs' Square, Beirut|Martyrs’ Square]] protest organized by [[Laïque Pride]] (“Secular Pride”).&lt;ref name="beirutsyndrome.com"/&gt;

The '''Shakti Peeth''' ({{lang-sa|शक्ति पीठ}}, {{IAST|Śakti Pīṭha}}, ''seat of Shakti''&lt;ref name="Fuller2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fuller, Christopher John|title=The Camphor Flame: Popular Hinduism and Society in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=To6XSeBUW3oC&amp;pg=PA44|year=2004|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=978-0-691-12048-5|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;) are significant [[shrines]] and pilgrimage destinations in [[Shaktism]], the goddess-focused Hindu tradition. There are 51 or 108 Shakti peethas by various accounts,&lt;ref name="Vanamali2008p143"/&gt;&lt;ref name= Chakrabarti430&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kunal Chakrabarti|author2=Shubhra Chakrabarti|title=Historical Dictionary of the Bengalis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QVOFAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA430 |year=2013|publisher=Scarecrow|isbn=978-0-8108-8024-5|page=430}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which between 4 and 18 are named as ''Maha'' (major) in medieval Hindu texts.&lt;ref name="Vanamali2008p143"&gt;{{cite book|author=Vanamali|title=Shakti: Realm of the Divine Mother|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N5Ju3nWR52UC |year=2008|publisher=Inner Traditions |isbn=978-1-59477-785-1|pages=83–84, 143–144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these historic places of goddess worship are in India, but some are in Nepal, Bangladesh, and one each in Tibet (Mansarovar), Sri Lanka and Pakistan.&lt;ref name= Chakrabarti430/&gt;

Various legends explain how the Shakti Peetha came into existence. The most popular is based on the story of the death of the goddess [[Sati (goddess)|Sati]]. Out of grief and sorrow, [[Shiva]] carried Sati's body, reminiscing about their moments as a couple, and roamed around the universe with it. Vishnu had cut her body into 52 body parts, using his Sudarshana Chakra, which fell on Earth to become sacred sites where all the people can pay homage to the Goddess. To complete this massively long task, Lord Shiva took the form of [[Bhairava]].

== Legend ==
[[File:Dakshayani.jpg|right|240px|thumb|[[Shiva]] carrying the corpse of [[Dakshayani]] ]]
Lord [[Brahma]] performed a ''[[yajna]]'' ([[Vedas|Vedic]] ritual of fire sacrifice) to please [[Shakti]] and [[Shiva]]. Goddess [[Shakti]] emerged, separating from [[Shiva]] and helped Brahma in the creation of the universe. Brahma decided to give Shakti back to Shiva. Therefore, his son [[Daksha]] performed several yagnas to obtain Shakti as his daughter in the form of Sati. It was then decided that Sati was brought into this world with the motive of getting married to Shiva.

However, due to Lord Shiva's curse to Brahma that his fifth head was cut off due to his lie in front of Shiva, Daksha started hating Lord Shiva and decided not to let Lord Shiva and Sati get married. 

However, Sati got attracted to Shiva and finally one day Shiva and Sati got married. This marriage only increased Daksha's hatred towards Lord [[Shiva]].

[[Daksha]] performed a ''yagna'' with a desire to take revenge on Lord [[Shiva]]. Daksha invited all the deities to the ''yajna'' except Lord Shiva and Sati. The fact that she was not invited did not deter Sati from attending the ''yagna''. She expressed her desire to attend the ''yagna'' to Shiva, who tried his best to dissuade her from going. Shiva eventually relented and Sati went to the ''yagna''. [[Dakshayani|Sati]], being an uninvited guest, was not given any respect at the ''yagna''. Furthermore, [[Daksha]] insulted Shiva. Sati was unable to bear her father's insults toward her husband, so she immolated herself.

Enraged at the insult and the injury, Shiva in his [[Virabhadra]] [[avatar]] destroyed Daksha's ''yagna'', cut off [[Daksha]]'s head, and later replaced it with that of a male goat as he restored him to life.[[Virabhadra]] didn't stop fighting; he kept raging with anger. Gods prayed to lord Vishnu. He came there and started fighting him. Still immersed in grief, Shiva picked up the remains of Sati's body, and performed the [[Tandava]], the celestial dance of destruction, across all creation. The other Gods requested [[Vishnu]] to intervene to stop this destruction, towards which Vishnu used the [[Sudarshana Chakra]], which cut through Sati's corpse. The various parts of the body fell at several spots all through the Indian subcontinent and formed sites which are known as ''Shakti Peethas'' today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/tantra/maha/maha00.htm|title=Introduction and Preface|website=www.sacred-texts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At all the ''Shakti Peethas'', the Goddess Shakti is accompanied by her consort, Lord [[Bhairava]] (a manifestation of Lord Shiva).
Shakti is an aspect of the Supreme Being [[Adi parashakti]], the mother of the [[trimurti]], the holy trinity in [[Hindu religion &amp; scriptures]].

==Sati's self-immolation==
{{main|Daksha Yaga}}

The history of [[Daksha yajna]] and Sati's self-immolation had immense significance in shaping the ancient Sanskrit literature and even influenced the culture of India.  It led to the development of the concept of Shakti Peethas and thereby strengthened [[Shaktism]]. Enormous numbers of stories in the Puranas and other Hindu religious books took the [[Daksha]] yagna as the reason for their origin. It is an important incident in [[Shaivism]], resulting in the emergence of [[Parvati]] in the place of [[Sati (goddess)|Sati]] Devi and making Shiva a grihastashrami (house holder), leading to the origin of [[Ganesha]] and [[Kartikeya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kottiyoor Devaswam Temple Administration Portal|url=http://kottiyoordevaswom.com/|work=kottiyoordevaswom.com/|publisher=Kottiyoor Devaswam|accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakti Peethas are shrines or divine places of the Mother Goddess. These are places that are believed to have been blessed with the presence of [[Shakti]] due to the falling of body parts of the corpse of [[Sati (goddess)|Sati]] Devi, when Lord [[Shiva]] carried it and wandered throughout Aryavartha in sorrow. There are 51 Shakti Peeth linking to the 51 alphabets in Sanskrit.&lt;ref name="ANAND2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=RAGHUBIR LAL ANAND|title=IS God DEAD?????|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nQniAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1|date=February 2014|publisher=Partridge Publishing|isbn=978-1-4828-1823-9|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each temple has shrines for Shakti and [[Kalabhairava]], and most Shakti and Kalabhairava in different Shakti Peeth have different names.

==Four Adi Shakti Pithas==

Some of the great religious texts like the [[Shiva Purana]], the [[Devi-Bhagavata Purana|Devi Bhagavata]], the [[Kalika Purana]] and the AstaShakti recognize four major Shakti Peethas (centers), like [[Vimala Temple|Bimala]] (Pada Khanda) (inside the Jagannath Temple of [[Puri]], [[Odisha]]), Tara Tarini (Sthana Khanda, Purnagiri, Breasts) (Near [[Brahmapur|Berhampur]], [[Odisha]]), [[Kamakhya Temple]] (Yoni Khanda) (Near Guwahati, Assam) and Dakshina Kalika (Mukha Khanda) (Kolkata, [[West Bengal]]) originated from the parts of the corpse of Mata Sati in the Satya Yuga.

The Ashtashakti and Kalika Purana says (in Sanskrit):

:"Bimala Pada khandancha,
:Stana khandancha Tarini (Tara Tarini),
:Kamakhya Yoni khandancha,
:Mukha khandancha Kalika (Dakshina Kalika)
:Anga pratyanga sanghena
:Vishnu Chakra Kshyta nacha"

Further explaining the importance of these four Pithas, the "Brihat Samhita" also gives the location of these Pithas as (in Sanskrit)
:"Rushikulya* Tatae Devi,
:Tarakashya Mahagiri,
:Tashya Srunga Stitha Tara
:Vasishta Rajitapara" ([[Rushikulya]] is a holy river flowing on the foothill of the Tara Tarini Hill Shrine).

In the listings below:
*"Shakthi" refers to the Goddess worshiped at each location, all being manifestations of Dakshayani (Sati), Parvati or Durga;
*"Body Part or Ornament" refers to the body part or piece of jewelry that fell to earth, at the location on which the respective temple is built.

Apart from these 4 there are 51 other famous Peethas recognized by religious texts. According to the ''Pithanirnaya Tantra'' the 51 peethas are scattered all over present day countries of [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Nepal]], [[Tibet]], [[Bhutan]] and [[Pakistan]]. The ''Shivacharita'' besides listing 51 maha-peethas, speaks about 26 more upa-peethas. The Bengali [[almanac]], [[Vishuddha Siddhanta Panjika]] too describes the 51 peethas including the present modified addresses. A few of the several accepted listings are given below.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindunet.org/saraswati/resources/pithas.htm 51 Pithas of Parvati] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927033603/http://www.hindunet.org/saraswati/resources/pithas.htm |date=2006-09-27 }} - From Hindunet&lt;/ref&gt; One of the few in [[South India]], [[Srisailam]] in [[Andhra Pradesh]] became the site for a 2nd-century temple.&lt;ref name="srisalam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacredsites.com/asia/india/srisailam_shakti_pitha.html|title=Srisailam|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical notes==
First relating to [[Brahmanda Purana]], one of the major eighteen [[Puranas]], it mentions 64 Shakthi Peetha of Goddess [[Parvati]] in the [[Bharata (term)|Bharat]] or [[Greater India]] including present day India, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, some parts of Southern Tibet and parts of southern Pakistan. Another text which gives a listing of these shrines, is the ''Shakthi Peetha Stotram'', written by [[Adi Shankara]], the 9th-century Hindu philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.celextel.org/adisankara/shaktipeethastotram.html Shakthi Peetha Stotram] Vedanta Spiritual Library&lt;/ref&gt;

'''According to the manuscript''' ''Mahapithapurana'' (c. 1690 – 1720 CE), there are 52 such places. Among them, 23 are located in the [[Bengal]] region, 14 of these are located in what is now [[West Bengal]], [[India]], 1 in Baster (Chhattisgarh), while 7 are in what is now [[Bangladesh]].

Rishi Markandeya composed the 'Devi Saptashati' or the seven hundred hymns extolling the virtues of the Divine Goddess at the shaktipeetha in Nashik. The idol is also leaning a little to the left to listen to the sages composition. The Saptashati or the "Durga Stuti" forms an integral part in the vedic form of Shakti worship.

The third eye of Mata Sati fell below a tree in a mortuary in the Ishan corner of Vakreshwar. This is on the bank of the north flowing Dwarka river in the east of Baidyanath. Here Mata Sati is called Chandi Bhagwai Ugra Tara and Bhairav is called Chandrachur. This [[Shaktipeeth]] is called [[Tarapith]] in [[Birbhum district]] [[West bengal]], India.

== 18 Maha Shakti Pithas ==
The modern cities or towns that correspond to these 64 locations can be a matter of dispute, but there are a few that are totally unambiguous, these are mentioned in the ''Ashta Dasa Shakthi Peetha Stotram'' by [[Adi Shankara]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindupedia.com/en/Ashta_Dasa_Shakthi_Peetha_Stotram Ashta Dasa Shakthi Peetha Stotram] From Hindupedia&lt;/ref&gt; This list contains 18 such locations which are often referred to as ''Maha Shakthi Peeths''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://srisailam.co.in/shaktipeethas. html ASTADASA MAHA SAKTHI-PEETHAS]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} From srisailam.co.in&lt;/ref&gt;

Its ruins are near the [[Line of Control]] (LOC)&lt;ref name=hindu1/&gt; between the Indian and Pakistani-controlled portions of the former [[princely state]] of [[Kashmir and Jammu (princely state)|Kashmir and Jammu]]. Instead, [[Sringeri Sharada Peetham]], [[Sringeri]] in [[Karnataka]] even though not a Shakthi Peetha, is this aspect of the goddess. Requests have been made by the Hindu community in Pakistan to the Pakistani government to renovate the temple, the issue being raised by former Indian Home minister [[L. K. Advani]] to the Pakistan authorities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pak should renovate Sharada Temple in PoK: Advani |url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/states/pak-should-renovate-sharada-temple-in-pok-advani_369152.html |publisher=zeenews.india |date=2 May 2007 |accessdate=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a confidence-building measure, by increasing the people to people cross-border interaction.&lt;ref name=hindu1&gt;{{cite news | title =Pandits denied entry into temple in PoK | url =http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/002200710030341.htm | newspaper =The Hindu | date =3 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among these, the Shakthi Peethas at [[Kamakhya]], [[Gaya, India|Gaya]] and [[Ujjain]] are regarded as the most sacred as they symbolise the three most important aspects of the Mother Goddess viz. Creation (Kamarupa Devi), Nourishment (Sarvamangala Devi/Mangalagauri) and Annihilation (Mahakali Devi).

When observed carefully one can see that they lie in a perfect straight line from Kamakhya to Ujjain via Gaya, symbolizing that every creation in this universe will annihilate one day without fail. With concepts like [[Hinduism and Ecology]] gaining importance, the geographical features of these temples are gaining importance.

{{Islam}}
In [[Islam]], '''''shirk''''' ({{lang-ar|شرك}} ''širk'') is the sin of practicing [[idolatry]] or [[polytheism]], i.e. the deification or worship of anyone or anything besides the [[God in Islam|singular God]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.secularismandnonreligion.org/articles/10.5334/snr.111/ Nonbelief: An Islamic Perspective]&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. [[Allah]]. Literally, it means ascribing or the establishment of "partners" placed beside God. It is the vice that is opposed to the virtue of ''[[Tawhid]]'' ([[monotheism]]).&lt;ref name="Kamoonpuri"&gt;Kamoonpuri, S: "Basic Beliefs of Islam" pages 42–58. Tanzania Printers Limited, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who practice shirk are termed ''mushrikun''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=focLrox-frUC&amp;pg=PA429&amp;dq=shirk+Islam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=shirk%2520Islam&amp;f=false|title=The New Encyclopedia of Islam|last=Glassé|first=Cyril|last2=Smith|first2=Huston|date=2003-01-01|publisher=Rowman Altamira|isbn=9780759101906|page=429|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mushrikun'' (pl. of ''mushrik'') are those who practice ''shirk'', which literally means "association" and refers to accepting other gods and divinities alongside the god of the Muslims - Allah (as God's "associates").&lt;ref name=EI2-shirk&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Gimaret, D. | year= 2012 | title=S̲h̲irk |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam| edition=2nd|publisher=Brill |editors=P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1573-3912_islam_SIM_6965|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Sharia|Islamic law]] shirk as a crime, can just be attributed to Muslims, since only a Muslim is legally responsible not to associate any partner to Allah.&lt;ref&gt;Cenap Çakmak ''Islam: A Worldwide Encyclopedia [4 volumes]'' ABC-CLIO 2017 {{ISBN|978-1-610-69217-5}} page 1450&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Islam, ''shirk'' is an [[damnation|unforgivable]] crime if it remains unpardoned before death: Allah may forgive any sin if one dies in that state except for committing ''shirk''.&lt;ref name="Kamoonpuri"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Qur'an 4:48|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/isl/yaq/yaq004.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''širk'' comes from the [[triliteral|Arabic root]] [[shin (letter)|Š]]-[[resh|R]]-[[kaph|K]] ({{lang|ar|ش ر ك}}), with the general meaning of "to share".&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. [[A. A. Nadwi]], "Vocabulary of the [[Qur'an]]"&lt;/ref&gt;
In the context of the [[Quran]], the particular sense of "sharing as an equal partner" is usually understood, so that [[polytheism]] means "attributing a partner to Allah". In the Qur'an, ''shirk'' and the related word ''mušrikūn'' (مشركون)—those who commit shirk and plot against Islam—often refer to the enemies of Islam (as in verse 9.1–15).

==Quran==
Islamic commentators on the Quran have emphasized that pre-Islamic [[Arabian mythology|Arabic idolatry]] made a number of godlings (most memorably the three goddesses [[Manāt|al-Manāt]], [[Allat|al-lāt]] and [[Uzza|ʻUzzā]]) equal associates of Allah (as the Qur'an discusses in the [[An-Najm|53rd surat]]) and the word ''mushrikūn'' (singular: ''mushrik'') is often translated into English as "polytheists".

The [[Quran]] and what the people of [[Noah in Islam|Nuh's]] community would say in an effort by the idolaters to ignore and mock Nuh. "They (idolaters) have said: "You shall not leave your gods nor shall you leave [[Wadd]], nor [[Suwa']], nor [[Yaghuth]], nor [[Ya'uq]] nor [[Nasr (idol)|Nasr]]." (Qur'an 71:23)

Other forms of ''shirk'' include the worship of wealth and other material objects. This is pointed out in the [[Qur'an]] in one of the stories of the [[Children of Israel]], when they took [[Golden calf|a calf made of gold]] for worship,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Qur'an 7:148–150|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/isl/yaq/yaq007.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for which Moses ordered them to repent.

Another form of shirk mentioned in the Qur'an is to take scholars of religion, monks, divines, or religious lawyers as Lord(s) in practice by following their doctrines, and/or by following their rulings on what is lawful when it is at variance to the law or doctrines prescribed by Allah's revelation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Qur'an 9:31|url=http://www.internetmosque.net/read/english_translation_of_the_quran_meaning/9/31/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yusuf Ali translation of 9:31, footnote 1266|url=http://al-quran.info/default.aspx?x=y#&amp;&amp;sura=9&amp;aya=31&amp;trans=en-yusuf_ali&amp;show=both,quran-uthmani&amp;ver=2.00}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theological interpretation==
Medieval Muslim (as well as Jewish) philosophers identified belief in the [[Trinity]] with the heresy of ''shirk'', in Arabic, (or ''[[shituf]]'' in Hebrew), meaning "associationism", in limiting the infinity of God by associating his divinity with physical existence.&lt;ref&gt;Learning from other faiths Hermann Häring, Janet Martin Soskice, Felix Wilfred - 2003 - 141 "Medieval Jewish (as well as Muslim) philosophers identified belief in the Trinity with the heresy of shituf (Hebrew) or shirk (Arabic): 'associationism', or limiting the infinity of Allah by associating his divinity with creaturely being"&lt;/ref&gt;

In a theological context one commits ''shirk'' by associating some lesser being with [[Allah]]. This sin is committed if one imagines that there is a partner with ''Allah'' whom it is suitable to [[worship]]. It is stated in the Quran: "Allah forgives not that partners should be set up with Him, but He forgives anything else, to whom He pleases, to set up partners with Allah is to devise a sin most heinous indeed" (Qur'an 4:48). Many Islamic theologians{{who|date=October 2012}} extend the sense of worship to include praying to some other being to intercede with Allah on one's behalf, rather than taking one's case to God Himself. The limits of the concept of worship are quite elastic and theologians often describe excessive veneration of some [[artifact (archaeology)|artifact]] here on earth as ''shirk''.

[[Atheism]] is described as ''shirk'' because it denies the position of ''Allah'' as the unique creator and sustainer of the universe (''tawhid ar-rububiyya'', the Unity of Lordship) and muslims who declare that they are atheists are being punished in Muslim countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21567059-ex-muslim-atheists-are-becoming-more-outspoken-tolerance-still-rare-no-god-not|title=Atheists and Islam: No God, not even Allah | newspaper=The Economist |date=24 November 2012|accessdate=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same way, the act of ''shirk'' is extended to include such things as the notion that God possesses human-like [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] qualities as well as acts of worship or [[piety]] whose inward goal is [[pride]], caprice, or a desire for public admiration, although public prayer is a core Islamic aspect of faith, encouraged and supported in the Quran.

The status of the [[People of the Book]] (''ahl al-kitab''), particularly Jews and Christians, with respect to the Islamic notions of unbelief is not clearcut. Charles Adams writes that the Quran reproaches the People of the Book with ''kufr'' for rejecting Muhammad's message when they should have been the first to accept it as possessors of earlier revelations, and singles out Christians for disregarding the evidence of God's unity.&lt;ref name=adams&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Charles Adams (rev. by A. Kevin Reinhart)|title=Kufr|encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World|editor=John L.

Modern scholars have also interpreted it as a reference to Jesus, who was often called "the third of three" in Syriac literature and as an intentional over-simplification of Christian doctrine intended to highlight its weakness from a strictly monotheistic perspective.&lt;ref name=EoQ-Trinity/&gt;}} Other Quranic verses strongly deny the [[Hypostatic union|deity of Jesus Christ]], son of Mary and reproach the people who treat Jesus as equal with God as disbelievers who will be doomed to eternal punishment in [[Hell]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, Jojo, ''[http://theolibrary.shc.edu/resources/Quran-Gospel.pdf Qur’an-Gospel Convergence: The Qur’an’s Message To Christians]'', ''Journal of Dharma'', 1 (January-March 2010), pp. 55-76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mazuz, Haggai (2012) [https://journal.fi/store/article/download/9525/6759 ''Christians in the Qurʾān: Some Insights Derived from the Classical Exegetic Approach''], Journal of Dharma 35, 1 (January-March 2010), 55-76&lt;/ref&gt; Quran also does not recognize the attribute of Jesus as the Son of God or God himself, it respects Jesus as a prophet and messenger of God sent to children of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Schirrmacher, Christine, ''The Islamic view of Christians: Qur’an and Hadith'', http://www.worldevangelicals.org&lt;/ref&gt; Some Muslim thinkers such as [[Mohamed Talbi]] have viewed the most extreme Quranic presentations of the dogmas of the Trinity and divinity of Jesus (5:19, 5:75-76, 5:119) as non-Christian formulas that were rejected by the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Carré, Olivier|year=2003|title=Mysticism and Politics: A Critical Reading of Fī Ẓilāl Al-Qurʼān by Sayyid Quṭb|location=Boston|publisher=Brill|pages=63-64|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N85UaTV-0VoC&amp;pg=PA63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyril Glasse criticizes the use of ''kafirun'' [pl. of ''kafir''] to describe Christians as "loose usage".&lt;ref name=Glasse-2001-247&gt;{{cite book|last1=Glasse|first1=Cyril|title=The New Encyclopedia of Islam|date=1989|publisher=Altamira Press|location=NY|isbn=0759101892|page=247|edition=Revised 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Encyclopedia of Islam]], in traditional [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]], ''ahl al-kitab'' are "usually regarded more leniently than other ''kuffar'' [pl. of ''kafir'']..." and "in theory" a Muslim commits a punishable offense if he says to a Jew or a Christian: "Thou unbeliever".&lt;ref name=EI2&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Björkman, W. | year= 2012 | title=Kāfir |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam| edition=2nd|publisher=Brill |editors=P.

Historically, People of the Book permanently residing under Islamic rule were entitled to a special status known as ''[[dhimmi]]'', while those visiting Muslim lands received a different status known as ''[[musta'min]]''.&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt;

==Greater and lesser shirk==
''Shirk'' is defined in various ways. Some argue that there is only one type of ''shirk''.
[[Muhammad]] has classified ''shirk'' into two categories:&lt;ref name="Kamoonpuri"/&gt;
; Greater ''shirk'' (''Shirk-al-Akbar''): Open and apparent
; Lesser ''shirk'' (''Shirk-al-Asghar''): Concealed or hidden

===Greater shirk===
Greater ''shirk'' or ''Shirke-al-Akbar'' means open polytheism. Muhammad describes major ''shirk'' in two forms:&lt;ref name="Kamoonpuri"/&gt;
*To associate anyone with ''Allah Taala'' as His partner (to believe in more than one god).
*To associate Allah's attributes with someone else. (Attributing, considering, or portraying Allah's knowledge or might to being those of anyone else)

Other interpretations also derived from the [[Qur'an]] and the prophetic tradition ([[Sunnah]]) divide ''shirk'' into three main categories. ''Shirk'' can be committed by acting against the three different categories.

====Rubūbīyah (Lordship)====
This category of ''shirk'' refers to either the belief that others share Allah's Lordship over creation as His equal or near equal, or to the belief that there exists no Lord over creation at all.
; ''Shirk'' by association: This is the ''shirk'' concerned with associating "others" with Allah.
; ''Shirk'' by negation: This is ''shirk'' in Rubūbīyah (Lordship).

====al-Asma was-Sifat (names and attributes)====
''Shirk'' in this category includes both the non-believer practices of giving Allah the attributes of his creation as well as the act of giving created beings Allah's names and attributes.
; ''Shirk'' by humanization: In this aspect of ''shirk'', Allah is given the form and qualities of human beings and animals. Due to man's superiority over animals, the human form is more commonly used by idolaters to represent Allah in creation. Consequently, the image of the Creator is often painted, moulded or carved in the shape of human beings possessing the physical features of those who worship them.
; ''Shirk'' by deification: This form of ''shirk'' relates to cases where created beings or things are given or claim Allah's names or his attributes. For example, it was the practice of the ancient Arabs to worship idols whose names were derived from the names of Allah. Their main three idols were; [[Al-lāt]] (taken from Allah's name al-Elah), [[al-'Uzza]] (taken from al-'Aziz), and [[Manāt|al-Manat]] (taken from al-Mannan). During the era of Muhammad there was also a man in a region of Arabia called Yamamah, who claimed to be a prophet and took the name [[Ar-Rahman (Islamic term)|Rahman]] which, in Islam, belongs only to Allah.

====al-'Ibadah (worship)====
In this category of ''shirk'', acts of worship are directed to others besides Allah and the reward for worship is sought from the creation instead of the Creator. As in the case of the previous categories, ''shirk'' in ''al-'Ibadah'' has two main aspects.

This form of ''shirk'' occurs when any act of worship is directed to someone else besides Allah. It represents the most obvious form of [[idolatry]], against which the prophets were specifically sent by Allah, calling the masses of mankind to give it up. Examples of this ''shirk'' are asking for forgiveness, admittance to paradise, etc. that only Allah can provide, from others besides Allah.

===Lesser shirk===
Lesser ''shirk'' or ''Shirke-e-Asghar'' means hidden polytheism. A person commits hidden polytheism when he professes ''tawhid'' (there is no god except Allah) but his thoughts and actions do not reflect his belief.&lt;ref name="Kamoonpuri"/&gt;

{{quote|"One who offers the ritual prayers in an ostentatious way is a polytheist. One who keeps the fast, or gives alms, or performs the ''Hajj'' to show the public his righteousness or to earn good name is a polytheist."|Muhammad&lt;ref name="Kamoonpuri"/&gt;}}

Mahmud ibn Lubayd reported, "Allah's messenger said: 'The thing I fear for you the most is ash-Shirk al-Asghar.'"
:The companions asked, "O messenger of Allah, what is that?"
:He replied, "Ar-Riya (showing off), for verily Allah will say on the Day of Resurrection when people are receiving their rewards, 'Go to those for whom you were showing off in the material world and see if you can find any reward from them.'"

Mahmud ibn Lubayd also said, "The Prophet came out and announced, 'O people, beware of secret Shirk!'"
:The people asked, "O messenger of Allah, what is secret Shirk?"
:He replied, "When a man gets up to pray and strives to beautify his prayer because people are looking at him; that is secret Shirk."

[[Umar ibn al-Khattab|Umar Ibn Al-Khattab]] narrated that the Messenger of Allah said: "Whoever swears by other than Allah has committed an act of kufr or shirk." (graded [[Saheeh#.E1.B8.A4asan|''hasan'']] by [[Al-Tirmidhi]] and [[Saheeh#Ṣaḥīḥ|''saheeh'']] by [[Hakim al-Nishaburi|Al-Hakim]])

[[Abdullah, son of Masud|Ibn Mas’ood]], one of Muhammad’s [[Sahabah|companions]], said: "That I should swear by Allah upon a lie is more preferable to me than that I should swear by another upon the truth."&lt;ref&gt;"Kitab At-Tawheed" by Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, chapter 40&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

In [[Etruscan mythology]], '''Thesan''' was the Etruscan Goddess of the [[dawn]], [[divination]] and [[childbirth]] (as well as a love-goddess) and was associated with the generation of [[life]]. She was identified with the [[Roman mythology|Roman]] [[Aurora (mythology)|Aurora]] and [[Greek mythology|Greek]] [[Eos]].&lt;ref name="Religion"&gt;{{cite book|last=de Grummond|first=Nancy Thomson|title=The Religion of the Etruscans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hQtbJyFCd40C&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=Thesan+etruscan+goddess+bonfante&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ffyqU6LGLKip0AWmooCQCw&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Thesan%20etruscan%20goddess%20bonfante&amp;f=false|year=2009|page=60|publisher=University of Texas Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Thesan was depicted on several Etruscan mirror backs, bearing a great pair of wings on her back like many other Etruscan goddesses, especially appropriate to a sky-goddess. One meaning of Her name is simply “Dawn”, and related words are ''thesi'', meaning “illumination”, and ''thesviti'', “clear or famous”. The other meaning of her name connects her with the ability to see the future, for ''thesan'' also means "divination", as seen in the related Etruscan word ''thesanthei'', “divining”, “illuminating”, or “brilliant”. This relates to Her function as a [[dawn goddess]] &amp;ndash; since divination throws light on the dark future and enables one to see what may happen, like the dawn, which illuminates what was previously dark. She was called by some as a [[childbirth goddess]], as she was present at the beginning of the day, which finds its parallel in the beginning of a new baby's life. Similar to the Roman goddess [[Lucina (goddess)|Lucina]], goddess of Light and Childbirth, who brought the infant into the light of day.&lt;ref name="Thesan"&gt;{{cite web|last=Crane|first=Mary|title=Thesan|url=http://www.thaliatook.com/OGOD/thesan.html|date=|accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Curse of Aphrodite==
The Etruscans identified their Thesan with the Greek dawn goddess [[Eos]]. In the Greek legend, [[Aphrodite]] had found Eos in bed with her lover [[Ares]]; to punish Eos She “cursed” her with an insatiable taste for mortal youths, and Eos became infamous for her many young lovers. The Etruscans seemed to quite like these stories and easily transferred them to their dawn goddess Thesan; the stories depicted on the mirrors are generally straight out of Greek myth.&lt;ref name="Thesan" /&gt;

==Depictions of Thesan/Eos==
===with Cephalus===
On one relief mirror back (kind of a rarity in Etruscan mirrors since the decoration on the back is almost always engraved rather than cast), Thesan is shown in the act of abducting [[Cephalus]], a young man of [[Athens]] who was married to the [[Erechtheus|King Erechtheus’]] daughter, [[Procris]]. Thesan is winged here, wearing a [[chiton]] and diagonal [[himation]] that flows in the breeze; about her head is a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]], to emphasize her function as Light-Goddess. She runs off to the left carrying Cephalus in her arms, who is shown as nude and much smaller than she is. He does not look at all distressed at the situation and he rests in her arms with his right hand on her shoulder. Like many depictions of Etruscan women and their lovers, she is shown as larger and therefore more important or powerful than the man: This has been taken as an indication of the high status of Etruscan women.

The same scene is depicted on a mirror handle in high relief openwork; Cephalus is again quite a lot smaller (and younger) than Thesan, who is not winged this time, but whose cloak billows behind her in the breeze. She smiles down at young Kephalos as She lifts him up, and he is nude save for a short cloak and hunting boots.

===with Memrun (Memnon)===
Another favorite scene of Thesan/Eos depicts a far more somber affair. When her son [[Memnon (mythology)|Memnon]] (by [[Tithonus]], another young man she abducted to be her lover, called ''Thinthun'' by the Etruscans) was killed in the [[Trojan War]], Eos grieved so terribly that she threatened never to bring forth the dawn again. She was finally persuaded to return, but in Her grief she weeps tears of dew every morning for Her beloved son. One mirror-back shows Her before [[Tinia]] ([[Zeus]]) with ''Thethis'' ([[Thetis]]), the mother of [[Achilles]]. Both Goddesses plead with Tinia to spare their sons’ lives; but both were already doomed to die. The relief mirror mentioned above has been interpreted by some as showing Thesan carrying off the body of her dead son Memnon (who the Etruscans called ''Memrun''). (Different interpretations possible for this mirror, since the figures are not labelled, whereas most Etruscan mirrors with figures do have names engraved beside them.)&lt;ref name="World"&gt;{{cite book|last=Macintosh Turfa|first=Jean|title=The Etruscan World|page=506|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Ofa_0Y5Iu8C&amp;pg=PA506&amp;dq=Thesan+etruscan+goddess&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dv6qU6zFGOiy0QXW_ICYDQ&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Thesan%20etruscan%20goddess&amp;f=false|year=2013|isbn=1134055234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===with Usil and Nethuns===
The Liber Lintaeus connects this goddess Thesan with the Etruscan sun-deity [[Usil]], equivalent of the Greek [[Helios]], while a fourth century [[mirror]] now shows her in conversation with both Usil and [[Nethuns]] (the latter, the Etruscan [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] / [[Poseidon]]).&lt;ref name="Discs"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carpino|first=Alexandra Ann|title=Discs of Splendor: The Relief Mirrors of the Etruscans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MpH_9AWieHYC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=Thesan+etruscan+goddess+bonfante&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PfiqU_zEAsGX1AW1wYCICg&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Thesan%20etruscan%20goddess%20bonfante&amp;f=false|page=109|publisher=The University of Wisconsin Press|year=2003|isbn=0299189902}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Persistence==
Like more than a few Etruscan Goddesses, she seems to have survived into [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] folklore at least until the 19th&amp;nbsp;century as a spirit called “Tesana”. She was said to visit mortals as they dreamt, in the time when the sun is rising but before the sleeper had yet awakened. She was believed to bring words of encouragement and comfort, and Her presence in a dream gave good fortune and blessings for the day.&lt;ref name="Thesan" /&gt;

{{Globalize|article|Abrahamic faiths|date=December 2012}}

[[File:Sow and five piglets.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[pig]] is considered an unclean animal as food in [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]].]]

In some [[religions]], an '''unclean animal''' is an animal whose consumption or handling is [[taboo]]. According to these religions, persons who handle such animals may need to [[Ritual purification|ritually purify]] themselves to get rid of their uncleanliness.

==Judaism==
[[File:YanovTorah.JPG|thumb|right|A Torah scroll and silver pointer (''[[yad]]'') used in reading.]]
In [[Judaism]], the concept of "impure animals", plays a prominent role in the [[Kashrut]], the part of [[Halakha|Jewish law]] that specifies which foods are allowed (''[[kosher foods|kosher]]'') or forbidden to Jews. These laws are based upon the Books of [[Leviticus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Leviticus|11|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Deuteronomy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Deuteronomy|14|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Torah]] and in the extensive body of [[rabbi]]nical commentaries (the [[Talmud]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource |title=Shulchan Aruch: Yoreh Deah 79 |wslink=Shulchan Aruch/Yoreh Deah |last=Karo |first=Yosef}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Glover"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Glover  | first = Alfred Kingsley   | title = Jewish Laws and Customs: Some of the Laws and Usages of the Children of the Ghetto  | publisher = W.A. Hammond  | year = 1900 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=N25Whg_QfeUC&amp;pg=PA157  |page=157  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eisenberg"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Eisenberg  | first = Ronald L.   | title = The 613 Mitzvot: A Contemporary Guide to the Commandments of Judaism  | publisher = Schreiber | year = 2005 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=maeV2EG_eZMC&amp;pg=PA251 | isbn = 0-88400-303-5| page = 251 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of unclean animals is also mentioned in the [[Book of Genesis]], when [[Noah]] is instructed to bring into the [[Noah's Ark|Ark]] all sorts "of pure beasts, and of beasts that are impure, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth".&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Genesis|7:8|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Torah, some animals are explicitly named as pure or impure, while others are classified by anatomical characteristics or other criteria. In some cases, there is some doubt as to the precise meaning of the [[Biblical Hebrew]] animal name.

According to Jewish dietary laws, to be "pure" an animal must also be free from certain defects, and must be slaughtered and cleaned according to specific regulations (''[[Shechita]]''). Any product of an impure or improperly slaughtered animal is also non-kosher. Animal [[gelatin]], for example, has been avoided, although recently kosher gelatin (from cows or from fish prepared according to kosher regulations) has become available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ohr.edu/ask_db/ask_main.php/127/Q1/|work=Ask the Rabbi|publisher=Ohr Somayach International|title=Dry Bones and Jell-O|accessdate=31 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The status of [[shellac]] is controversial.) The prohibitions also extend to certain parts of pure animals, such as [[blood]], certain [[fat tissue]]s, and the [[sciatic nerve]]s. Finally, it is forbidden to cook the meat of an animal in the milk or dairy product of that same animal, which has in turn led to the traditional practice of using separate complete sets of [[kitchen utensil]]s for meat and dairy so as to totally ensure this rule is not broken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Medications on Passover| last = Eisenberg|first=Daniel| url = http://www.aish.com/h/pes/l/48969711.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification of animals===
The Torah does not classify animals under modern scientific categories of [[mammals]], [[fish]], [[reptiles]] and [[birds]]. Rather, the religious categories are land-dwelling animals (land mammals, flightless birds, and land reptiles, etc), flying animals (birds, insects, flying mammals such as bats), and water-bound animals (fish, mammals such as whales, reptiles such as sea snakes, crustaceans, mollouscs, etc).

Given that each of these religious categories of animals includes species of at least two or more of each scientific categories of animals, there is no general kashrut rules relating per se to mammals, birds, reptiles, or fish. However, rules for each of these class of animals can be extrapolated from the biblical requirements.

===Mammals===
[[File:54986main mouse med.jpg|thumb|100px|right|Mouse]]
[[File:Big-eared-townsend-fledermaus.jpg|thumb|100px|right|[[Townsend's big-eared bat]]]]
According to the Torah, land-dwelling animals that ''both'' chew the [[cud]] ([[ruminant|ruminate]]) and have [[cloven hoof|cloven hooves]], are kosher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+14&amp;version=NIV|title=Deuteronomy 14:1-8|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By these requirements, any land-dwelling animal that is kosher can only possibly be a mammal, but even then, permitted are only those mammals that are placentals and strictly herbivorous (not omnivores nor carnivores) that both ruminate and also have cloven hooves, such as bovines (cattle/cows, bison, buffalos, yak, etc), sheep, goats, deer, antelope, and technically, also giraffes.

Although the giraffe falls under the kosher category by its characteristics, it does not have a [[wikt:Masorah|masorah]] (tradition) for its consumption by any Jewish community. Though it is commonly believed that it is not known where on a giraffes neck [[shechita]] (ritual slaughter) can be performed, this is incorrect as the shechita can be performed anywhere on the neck. 

All other mammals, land-dwelling or otherwise, are forbidden by the Torah, including "crawling creatures" such as mammalian [[mouse|mice]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Leviticus|11:29|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and flying mammals such as the various species of [[bat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Leviticus|11:19|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water-bound mammals, such as whales, dolphins, dugongs, etc, are also not kosher as they do not have the characteristics required of kosher water-bound creatures which must have both fins and scales. 

Those land-dwelling mammals that have only one of the two characteristics of kosher land-dwellers (only ruminant or only cloven hooved) are impure and cannot be consumed. By default, therefore, not only are most land-dwelling mammals not kosher, but all land-dwelling non-mammals are also not kosher, including reptiles, amphibians, molluscs (including snails), etc.

Among mammals that Leviticus cites explicitly as an example of unclean is the [[camel]], because it ruminates but does not have a cloven hoof;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Leviticus|11:3–8|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[hyrax]] and the [[hare]] are also explicitly given as an example of being excluded as kosher on the same grounds. Quintessentially, the Torah explicitly declares the [[pig]] unclean, because it has cloven hooves but does not [[Ruminant|ruminate]]. 

It is of interest to note that [[Australia]] is the only continent that has no kosher native mammals, nor kosher native birds. Thus, prior to European settlement, there were no kosher land-dwelling or flying animals in Australia. Though the [[kangaroo]] chews its cud, for instance, it does not have hooves, and is therefore not kosher. No mammals that are marsupial or monotreme are kosher.

===Fish===
[[File:Blue crab on market in Piraeus - Callinectes sapidus Rathbun 20020819-317.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[Callinectes sapidus|Blue crab]] for sale in [[Piraeus]].]]
According to {{Bibleverse||Leviticus|11:9–10|KJV}}, anything that comes from the water ("in the seas, and in the rivers") that has both fins and scales may be eaten. By those requirements, kosher water creatures can only possibly be [[fish]], but even then, permitted are only those fish that have both fins and scales.

All other non-fish water creatures are, by default, also not kosher, including crustaceans, molluscs, water-bound mammals, water-bound reptiles, etc.

While there is nothing specifically mentioned in Jewish halakha requiring kosher fish having an [[endoskeleton]] ("inner skeleton") and [[gills]] (as opposed to lungs), every true fish that has both scales and fins by default also possesses an endoskeleton and gills. Any sea creature that lacks gills and can only breathe oxygen from air through lungs, or has an exoskeleton instead of and endoskeleton&lt;ref name=Margolese&gt;{{cite book|last=Margolese|first=Faranak|authorlink=Faranak Margolese|title=Off the Derech: Why Observant Jews Leave Judaism : How to Respond to the Challenge|publisher=Createspace|year=2005|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|343}}, is by default not kosher because it cannot be a fish.

It is important to note that the definition of scales does not include the shells of prawns and shrimp, which are in fact the [[exoskeleton]] ("outer skeleton") of these animals, in the same manner as the shells of lobsters or crabs. Even if these shells were to be misidentified as scales, these creatures would still not be kosher as they lack fins.

While not every fish that has fins will have scales, every true fish that has true fish scales by default also has fins.&lt;ref&gt;([www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1182104/jewish/All-About-Kosher-Fish.htm Source])&lt;/ref&gt;

===Birds===
The Torah names only a few birds that may not be eaten; those not in the list are presumed to be kosher. However, the precise identity of the unclean birds is a matter of contention in traditional Jewish texts. It is therefore common to eat only birds with a clear masorah (tradition) of being kosher in at least one Jewish community, such as domestic fowl. 

In Leviticus 11 it states the eagle, vulture, black vulture, red kite, black kite, raven, horned owl, screech owl, gull, or any kind of hawk. The little owl, cormorant, the great owl, white owl, desert owl, osprey, stork, heron, hoopoe and bats. &lt;ref&gt;http://biblehub.com/nasb/leviticus/11.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insects===
[[File:SGR laying.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Desert locust]]
The Torah allows eating certain kinds of "winged swarming things" (i.e. insects) while prohibiting others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Leviticus|11:20–23|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to uncertainty about the Hebrew insect names, rabbis today recommend that all insects be considered unclean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kashrut: Jewish Dietary Laws|work=Judaism 101|last=Rich|first=Tracey R.|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/kashrut.htm#Details|accessdate=25 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; An exception is made for certain locusts (''[[Schistocerca gregaria]]''), which are traditionally considered kosher by some [[Yemenite Jewish]] communities. {{Bibleverse||Leviticus|11:20–23|KJV}} details which insects are not to be eaten, and due to the wording all insects are considered impure to avoid mistaken consumption.

Bees' [[honey]] is considered kosher&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Ohr Somayach International|title=Why is honey Kosher?|url=http://ohr.edu/ask_db/ask_main.php/18/Q1/|work=Ask the Rabbi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Ohr Somayach International|title=Soul Food|last=Becher|first=Moredechai|url=http://ohr.edu/yhiy/article.php/993#Kosher|date=22 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; because the honey is not a product made of bees.

===Reasons===
Some scholars have conjectured that the Jewish concept of "unclean animals" arose out of [[public health]] concerns by community leaders, since, in the conditions of the times, some of those animals are indeed more likely to cause [[food poisoning]] or transmit [[diseases]] to people who consume them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nanji AA, French SW |title=Relationship between pork consumption and cirrhosis |journal=Lancet |volume=1 |issue=8430 |pages=681–3 |date=March 1985 |pmid=2858627 |doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(85)91338-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

[[British people|British]] [[anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Mary Douglas]] proposed that the "unclean" label had [[philosophy|philosophical]] grounds, namely it was cast on foods that did not seem to fall neatly into any symbolic category. The [[pig]], for example, was seen as an "ambiguous" creature, because it had cloven hoof like cattle, but did not chew cud.&lt;ref name=douglas&gt;{{cite book|last=Douglas|first=Mary|title=Purity and Danger: An Analysis of Concepts of Pollution and Taboo|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780415289955|origyear=1966}}{{page needed|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==
{{see also|Christian dietary laws|Christian views on the Old Covenant}}
In the [[Apostolic Age|very early days of Christianity]] it was debated if converts ought to follow Jewish customs (including [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcision]] and [[dietary laws]]) or not. According to the account of the [[Council of Jerusalem]] in {{Bibleverse||Acts|15}}, a compromise was reached between those who wanted full compliance and those who favored a more liberal view.  It was agreed that the converted Gentiles would have to bear "no greater burden than these necessary things: that ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication".&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Matthew|15:29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesus is quoted in {{Bibleverse||Mark|7:14–23}} as saying "There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him ... whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him; because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly"; and in {{Bibleverse||Matthew|15:10–11}}. "Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man."  These statements are often cited for support of the view that practicing Christianity does not include dietary restrictions.

[[File:Peter's vision of the sheet with animals.jpg|thumb|right|240px|[[Peter's vision of a sheet with animals]]. Illustration from ''Treasures of the Bible'', 1894.]]
Supporters of the liberal view also point to [[Saint Peter|Peter]]'s vision reported in {{bibleverse||Acts|10:10-16|KJV}} and {{Bibleverse||Acts|11:5-10|KJV}} in which God invited him to "kill and eat" from the animals in the "great sheet" containing "all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air". They also draw support from the writings of apostles [[Saint Timothy|Timothy]] ({{Bibleverse|1|Timothy|4:3–5|KJV}}, "For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving; for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer") and  [[Saint Paul|Paul]] ({{Bibleverse||Colossians|2:8–16|KJV}}, "Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days").

While the majority of Christians agree that the dietary restrictions of the Old Testament were lifted with Christ's [[New Covenant]], a view known as [[Supersessionism]], there are [[Christian Torah-submission|Torah-submissive Christians]]&lt;ref name=MK&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kaiser|first1=Menachem|title=FOR SOME BELIEVERS TRYING TO CONNECT WITH JESUS, THE ANSWER IS TO LIVE LIKE A JEW|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-life-and-religion/161086/observing-torah-like-jesus|accessdate=29 May 2017|work=Tablet|date=February 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; who believe that they should still be observed. Supporters of this view may argue, for example, that in the Old Testament, [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] spoke of unclean food and drink as "defiling one's body" {{Bibleverse||Daniel|1:8|NKJV}}, and that in the New Testament one's body is said to be the "temple of God", and "If anyone defiles the temple of God, God will destroy him".&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1|Corinthians|3:16–17|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some read Jesus's reply to questioning by the Pharisees in {{bibleverse||Matthew|15:1-2|NKJV}} and {{bibleverse||Matthew|15:19-20|NKJV}} as implying that his statements about "which goeth into the mouth" ({{Bibleverse||Mark|7:14–23}} and {{Bibleverse||Matthew|15:10–11}}) referred to the question of hand washing, rather than clean and unclean foods.&lt;ref&gt;
  {{cite web|url=http://www.amazingfacts.org/FreeStuff/BibleStudies/StudyGuides/tabid/105/ctl/ViewMedia/mid/453/IID/2-13/LNG/en/SC/R/Default.aspx?7=God%27s-Free-Health-Plan|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417185031/http://www.amazingfacts.org/FreeStuff/BibleStudies/StudyGuides/tabid/105/ctl/ViewMedia/mid/453/IID/2-13/LNG/en/SC/R/Default.aspx?7=God%27s-Free-Health-Plan|archivedate=17 April 2008|title= God's Free Health Plan|work=Amazing Facts}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Others also argue that the dietary restrictions predate Leviticus, and that Paul in {{Bibleverse||Colossians|2|KJV}} was referring to the ceremonial feast days such as the [[Feast of Unleavened Bread]] and not clean and unclean foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amazingfacts.org/FreeStuff/OnlineLibrary/tabid/106/ctl/ViewMedia/mid/447/IID/65/LNG/en/7/Feast-Days-and-Sabbaths/SC/R/Default.aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219144420/http://www.amazingfacts.org/FreeStuff/OnlineLibrary/tabid/106/ctl/ViewMedia/mid/447/IID/65/LNG/en/7/Feast-Days-and-Sabbaths/SC/R/Default.aspx|archivedate=19 December 2008|title=Feast Days and Sabbaths|last=Crews|first=Joe|year=2003|work=Amazing Facts}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others argue that the liberal view would imply the acceptance even of alcohol, tobacco, rats and roaches as "clean food";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amazingfacts.org/FreeStuff/OnlineLibrary/tabid/106/ctl/ViewMedia/mid/447/IID/61/LNG/en/7/Death-in-the-Kitchen/SC/R/Default.aspx|archiveurl=http://www.amazingfacts.org/FreeStuff/OnlineLibrary/tabid/106/ctl/ViewMedia/mid/447/IID/61/LNG/en/7/Death-in-the-Kitchen/SC/R/Default.aspx|archivedate=19 December 2008|title=Death In The Kitchen|last=Crews|first=Joe|year=2003|work=Amazing Facts}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that God never declares something an abomination and then changes His mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biblicalresearch.gc.adventist.org/documents/CleanandUnclean%20Meats.htm|archiveurl=http://biblicalresearch.gc.adventist.org/documents/CleanandUnclean%20Meats.htm|archivedate=25 July 2011|first=William|last=Shea|date=December 1988|title=Clean and Unclean Meats|work=Biblical Research Institute|publisher=Biblical Research Institute General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of the stricter view have also disputed the interpretation of Peter's vision {{Bibleverse||Acts|10:5-10|KJV}}, claiming that God was merely instructing him not to refer to gentiles as "unclean" since salvation had been extended to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amazingfacts.org/Radio/BibleAnswersLiveQuestionArchive/tabid/212/ctl/PlayMedia/mid/731/MDID/2337/PID/1176/SID/13/SQT/1000/7/Was-the-law-about-clean-and-unclean-meat-ended-with-the-Old-Covenant/Default.aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214083247/http://www.amazingfacts.org/Radio/BibleAnswersLiveQuestionArchive/tabid/212/ctl/PlayMedia/mid/731/MDID/2337/PID/1176/SID/13/SQT/1000/7/Was-the-law-about-clean-and-unclean-meat-ended-with-the-Old-Covenant/Default.aspx|archivedate=14 February 2009|title= Was the law about clean and unclean meat ended with the Old Covenant?|work=Amazing Facts}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is expressly stated by Peter later in the chapter at Acts 10:28 ("but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.") In Acts 10:14 Peter makes a distinction between "common" (Greek κοινόν) and "unclean" (Greek ακάθαρτον) to which God replies in the next verse "What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common [κοίνου]".

One modern example of a Torah-submissive group is the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] whose co-founder [[Ellen G. White]] was a proponent of [[vegetarianism]]. Many Seventh-day Adventists avoid meat for health reasons, though vegetarianism is not a requirement. Members of the [[United Church of God]] as well as other Sabbath-keeping Christian Churches also believe in abstaining from unclean meats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucg.org/booklet/what-does-bible-teach-about-clean-and-unclean-meats/|title=What Does the Bible Teach About Clean and Unclean Meats?|publisher=United Church of God}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Catholic traditions===
{{See also|Fasting and abstinence in the Roman Catholic Church}}
In the [[Roman Catholic Church]], it was forbidden to eat meat (defined as the flesh of any [[warm-blooded]] animal) on Friday, but as a [[penance]] to commemorate Christ's death rather than for meats being regarded as "unclean". In the [[1983 Code of Canon Law]], the current code of canon law for the Roman Catholic Church, the Friday [[abstinence]] from meat is prescribed for "those who have completed their fourteenth year of age". Once a person has begun his or her sixtieth year, the abstinence is no longer obligatory. Canon 1253 allows each particular conference of bishops to "determine more precisely the observance of fast and abstinence as well as substitute other forms of penance, especially works of charity and exercises of piety, in whole or in part, for abstinence and fast".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_P4O.HTM |title=Code of Canon Law |date=1983 |publisher=Vatican |access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current disciplinary norms from a document produced by the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]], titled "Pastoral Statement On Penance And Abstinence", remove the penalty of sin for Roman Catholics in the [[United States]] who choose not to abstain from meat, while the document "give[s] first place to abstinence from flesh meat". Roman Catholics in the United States are, therefore, free to substitute some form of penance on Fridays of the whole year, while the Lenten abstinence remain obligatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usccb.org/prayer-and-worship/liturgical-year/lent/us-bishops-pastoral-statement-on-penance-and-abstinence.cfm |title=PASTORAL STATEMENT ON PENANCE AND ABSTINENCE |date=1983 |publisher=United States Conference of Catholic Bishops |access-date=2017-01-16}} See especially sections entitled "Lent" and "Christ Died for Our Salvation on Friday".&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Seventh-day Adventist===
{{Main|Seventh-day Adventist Church#Health and diet}}
Since the 1860s when the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] began, wholeness and health have been an emphasis of the Adventist church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Obedience to these laws means abstinence from pork, shellfish, and other foods proscribed as "unclean".

==Islam==
{{Main|Islamic dietary laws}}
In [[Muslim dietary laws|Islam]] several animals are considered unclean and their consumption is sinful (''[[haram|harām]]''), except in case of necessity; while others are permitted (''[[halal|halāl]]''), as long as they are slaughtered in the proper manner and with blessings given to [[God]].

The [[Qur'an]] expressly forbids consumption of "the flesh of swine"&lt;ref name="qur5:3"&gt;{{Cite quran|5|3|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are no other "impure animals" explicitly named in the Qur'an. If someone converts to Islam, Allah "allows them as lawful what is good and prohibits them from what is bad; he releases them from their heavy burdens and from the yokes that were upon them".&lt;ref name="qur7.157"&gt;{{Cite quran|7|157|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For other animals, great importance is given to the manner of its death: forbidden are blood and carrion ("dead meat"), and any animal that has been "killed by strangling, or by a violent blow, or by a headlong fall, or by being gored to death".&lt;ref name="qur5:3"/&gt; Also forbidden is any animal that has been eaten by a wild animal, unless the person is able to slaughter it before it dies.&lt;ref name="qur5:3"/&gt;

Finally, the Qur'an forbids food on which has been [[invoke]]d a name other than Allah, which has been sacrificed on stone altars, or has subjected to the pagan practice of raffling with arrows.&lt;ref name="qur5:3"/&gt; Food slaughtered by an [[shirk (idolatry)|idolater]] is forbidden, but food that is acceptable to Jews and Christians is allowed to Muslims as well.&lt;ref name="qur5:4"&gt;{{Cite quran|5|4|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dogs===
{{main|Islam and animals#Dogs}}
[[File:Saluki dog breed.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Saluki dog]]
According to the majority of Sunni scholars, dogs can be owned by farmers, hunters, and shepherds for the purpose of hunting and guarding and the Qur'an states that it is permissible to eat what trained dogs catch.&lt;ref name="qur5:4"/&gt; Among the [[Bedouin]], the [[saluki]] dogs are cherished as companions and allowed in the tents.

Nevertheless, many Islamic teachers state dogs should be considered unclean and that Muslims licked by them must perform [[ritual purification]]. According to a Sunni Islam [[Hadith]], a plate that a dog has used for feeding must be washed seven times, including once with clean sand mixed with the water, before a person may eat from it.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

==Other instances==
{{Unsourced section|date=March 2018}}
Many [[Rastafari movement|Rastafarians]] believe that pigs are unclean and hold to a diet known as [[Ital]].

Historically, [[Scottish pork taboo|eating pork was taboo]] in much of Scotland, however, this is no longer the case.

The '''Wǔfāng Shàngdì''' (五方上帝 "Five Forms of the Highest Deity"{{refn|group=note|name=fang|The grapheme 方 ''fāng'' has a multiplicity of meanings, including "forms", "directions", "sides", "squarings", "phases", "ways", "evolutions", "manifestations", "powers" and, in Japanese, "persons". In its [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] versions, the grapheme was alternately represented as a [[cross potent]] ☩, in homography with 巫 ''[[wu (shaman)|wū]]'' ("shaman").{{sfnb|Pankenier|2013|pp=112–113}}}}), or simply '''Wǔdì''' (五帝 "Five Deities") or '''Wǔshén''' (五神 "Five Gods"){{sfnb|Medhurst|1847|p=260}} are, in [[Chinese classics|Chinese canonical texts]] and common [[Chinese folk religion|Chinese religion]], the fivefold manifestation of the [[Chinese theology|supreme God of Heaven]] (天 ''[[Tian|Tiān]]''). This theology harkens back at least to the [[Shang dynasty]].{{sfnb|Didier|2009|pp=143–144, Vol. II}} Described as the "five changeable faces of Heaven",{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|p=72}} they represent Heaven's cosmic activity which shapes worlds as ''tán'' 壇, "altars", imitating its order which is visible in the starry vault, the north [[celestial pole]] and its spinning constellations.{{refn|group=note|The Chinese concept equivalent of the Indian ''[[mandala]]''.}} The Five Deities themselves represent these constellations.{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|p=70}} In accordance with the Three Powers (三才 Sāncái) they have a celestial, a terrestrial and a [[chthonic]] form. The [[Han Chinese]] identify themselves as the [[Yan Huang Zisun|descendants of the Red and Yellow Deities]].

They are associated to the [[Chinese colors|five colours]], the [[Wu Xing|five phases of the continuous creation]], the five key planets of the [[Solar System]] and the [[Four Symbols (China)|five constellations rotating around the celestial pole]], the [[Sacred Mountains of China|five sacred mountains]] and five directions of space (their terrestrial form), and the five [[Longshen|Dragon Gods]] (龙神 ''Lóngshén'') who represent their mounts, that is to say the material forces they preside over (their chthonic form).{{sfnb|Little|Eichman|2000|p=250|ps=. It describes a [[Ming dynasty]] painting representing (among other figures) the Wudi: "In the foreground are the gods of the Five Directions, dressed as emperors of high antiquity, holding tablets of rank in front of them. [...] These gods are significant because they reflect the cosmic structure of the world, in which ''yin'', ''yang'' and the Five Phases (Elements) are in balance. They predate religious Taoism, and may have originated as chthonic gods of the Neolithic period. Governing all directions (east, south, west, north and center), they correspond not only to the Five Elements, but to the seasons, the Five Sacred Peaks, the Five Planets, and zodiac symbols as well. [...]".}}{{sfnb|Sun|Kistemaker|1997|pp=120–123}} They have also been defined simply as five special forms of the worship of the God of Heaven, different "accesses" or perspectives, suitable for different situations, to serve Heaven.{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|p=75}}

According to [[Zheng Xuan]], the influence of their activity begets different categories of beings on earth. Explaining the ancient theology about the origins of kings from Heaven's impregnation of earthly women, he commented:{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|p=81}}
{{Quote|王者之先祖, 皆感大微五帝之精以生 — Every ancestor of him who is the king was given birth to as the result of an influential movement [''gǎn'' 感] made by the spirits of the Five Deities.}}

==Names and meanings==
Other names by which the Five Deities are collectively known are:
* ''Wǔfāng Tiānshén'' (五方天神 "Five Forms of the God of Heaven");
* ''Wǔfāngdì'' (五方帝 "Five Forms Deity");{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|p=69}}{{refn|group=note|name=fang}}
* ''Wǔtiāndì'' (五天帝 "Five Heavenly Deities");
* ''Wǔlǎojūn'' (五老君 "Five Olden Lords");
* ''Wǔdàoshén'' (五道神 "Five Ways God(s)");
* ''Xiāntiān Wǔdì'' (先天五帝 "Five Deities of the Former Heaven");
* ''Wǔsèdì'' (五色帝 "Five Colors' Deities").{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|p=69}}

In some works they are conceptualised as a single deity, the "Great Deity the Heavenly King" (天皇大帝 ''Tiānhuáng Dàdì'') or "Highest Deity of the Vast Heaven" (昊天上帝 ''Hàotiān Shàngdì''), which are therefore other epithets for the supreme [[Chinese theology|God of Heaven]].{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|p=70}}

He represents the essence of earth and the Yellow Dragon (黄龙 ''Huánglóng'').{{sfnb|Fowler|2005|pp=200–201}} The character 黄 ''huáng'', for "yellow", also means, by [[homophony]] and shared [[etymology]] with 皇 ''huáng'', "august", "creator" and "radiant", attributes of the supreme God.{{sfnb|Pregadio|2013|pp=504–505}}

He is the deity who shapes the material world (地 ''[[Di (Chinese concept)|Dì]]''), the creator of the ''[[Huaxia]]'' civility, of marriage and morality, language and lineage, and primal ancestor of all the Chinese.{{sfnb|Chamberlain|2009|p=222}} In the cosmology of the Wufang Shangdi his astral body is [[Saturn]], but he is also identified as the Sun God, and with the star [[Regulus]] (α Leonis) and [[star (Chinese constellation)|constellations Leo and Lynx]], of which the latter is said to represent the body of the Yellow Dragon.{{sfnb|Sun|Kistemaker|1997|pp=120–123}}

He corresponds to the ''Huángshén Běidǒu'' (黄神北斗 "Yellow God of the [[Big Dipper|Northern Dipper]]"),{{sfnb|Lagerwey|Kalinowski|2008|p=1080}}{{refn|group=note|A 斗 ''dǒu'' in Chinese is an entire semantic field meaning the shape of a "dipper", as the [[Big Dipper]] (北斗 ''Běidǒu''), or a "cup", signifying a "whirl", and also has martial connotations meaning "fight", "struggle", "battle".}} of whom in certain historical sources he is described as the human form making an ontological distinction between the two. For instance, according to a definition given by apocryphal texts related to the ''[[Yellow River Map|Hétú]]'' 河圖, the Yellow Emperor "proceeds from the essence of the Yellow God of the Northern Dipper", is born to "a daughter of a chthonic deity", and as such he is "a cosmic product of the conflation of Heaven and Earth".{{sfnb|Espesset|2008|pp=22–28}} The Yellow God is in turn described as the "spirit father and astral double" of the Yellow Emperor.&lt;ref name=Wells2014/&gt;{{rp|42, note 25}}

As a human being, the Yellow Emperor is said to have been the fruit of a virginal birth, as his mother Fubao was impregnated by a radiance (''yuanqi'', "primordial pneuma"), a lightning, which she saw encircling the Northern Dipper (Great Chariot, or Ursa Major), or the celestial pole, while she was walking in the countryside. She delivered her son after twenty-four months on the mount of Shou (Longevity) or mount Xuanyuan, after which he was named.{{sfnb|Bonnefoy|1993|pp=241, 246}} Through his human side, he was a descendant of 有熊氏 ''Yǒuxióng'', the lineage of the Bear—another reference to the Ursa Major. Scholar John C. Didier has studied the parallels that the Yellow Emperor's mythology has in other cultures, deducing a plausible ancient origin of the myth in [[Siberia]] or in north Asia.{{sfnb|Didier|2009|pp=153–156, Vol. I}}

In older accounts, the Yellow Emperor is identified as a deity of light (and his name is explained in the ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'' to derive from ''guāng'' 光, "light") and thunder, and as one and the same with the "Thunder God" (雷神 ''Léishén''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Song|first=Yaoliang|title=The Deified Human Face Petroglyphs of Prehistoric China|year=2015|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=1938368339}} p. 239: in the ''Hetudijitong'' and the ''Chunqiuhechengtu'' the Yellow Emperor is identified as the Thunder God.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yang|first1=Lihui|last2=An|first2=Deming|title=Handbook of Chinese Mythology|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2005|isbn=157607806X}} p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; who in turn, as a later mythological character, is distinguished as the Yellow Emperor's foremost pupil, such as in the ''[[Huangdi Neijing]]''.

Huangdi represents the hub of creation, the ''[[axis mundi]]'' (Kunlun) that is the manifestation of the divine order in physical reality, opening the way to immortality.{{sfnb|Fowler|2005|pp=200–201}} As the deity of the centre of the four directions, in the ''[[Shizi (book)|Shizi]]'' he is described as "Yellow Emperor with Four Faces" (黄帝四面 ''Huángdì Sìmiàn'').{{sfnb|Sun|Kistemaker|1997|p=120}} The "Four-Faced God" or "Ubiquitous God" (四面神 ''Sìmiànshén'') is also the Chinese name of [[Brahma]]. Huangdi is the model of those who merge their self with the self of the universal God, of the [[asceticism|ascetics]] who reach enlightenment or immortality.{{sfnb|Lagerwey|Kalinowski|2008|p=674}}

In [[Sima Qian]]'s description of the Five Deities it is important to note that the Yellow Emperor was portrayed as the grandfather of the Black Emperor of the north who personifies as well the pole stars, and as the tamer of the Red Emperor, his half-brother, who is the spirit of the southern populations known collectively as [[Chu (state)|Chu]] in the Zhou dynasty.{{sfnb|Didier|2009|p=156, Vol. I}}

===Cangdi—Bluegreen Deity===

''Cāngdì'' (蒼帝 "Green Deity" or "Green Emperor") or ''Cāngshén'' (蒼神 "Green God"), also known as ''Qīngdì'' (青帝 "Blue Deity" or "Bluegreen Deity") or ''Qīngshén'' (青神 "Bluegreen God"), and cosmologically as the ''Dōngdì'' (东帝 "East Deity") or ''Dōngyuèdàdì'' (东岳大帝 "Great Deity of the Eastern Peak", which is [[Mount Tai]]), is the manifestation of the supreme God associated with the essence of wood and spring, for which he is worshipped as the god of fertility. The Bluegreen Dragon (青龙 ''Qīnglóng'') is both his animal form and constellation, and as a human he was ''Tàihào'' 太昊.{{sfnb|Fowler|2005|pp=200–201}} His female consort is the goddess of fertility [[Bixia#Bixia mother goddess worship|Bixia]]. His astral body is [[Jupiter]].{{sfnb|Sun|Kistemaker|1997|p=121}}

===Heidi—Black Deity===

{{Main article|Heidi (god)}}
''Hēidì'' (黑帝 "Black Deity" or "Black Emperor") or ''Hēishén'' (黑神 "Black God"), also known as the cosmological ''Běidì'' (北帝 "North Deity") or ''Běiyuèdàdì'' (北岳大帝 "Great Deity of the Northern Peak"), and identified as ''[[Zhuanxu|Zhuānxū]]'' (颛顼), today frequently worshipped as ''[[Xuanwu (god)|Xuánwǔ]]'' (玄武 "Dark Warrior") or ''Zhēnwǔ'' (真武), is the manifestation of the supreme God associated with the essence of water and winter. His animal form is the Black Dragon (玄龙 ''Xuánlóng'', literally "Dark Dragon" or "Mysterious Dragon") and his stellar animal is the tortoise-snake.{{sfnb|Fowler|2005|pp=200–201}} His astral body is [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]].{{sfnb|Sun|Kistemaker|1997|p=121}}

===Chidi—Red Deity===
[[File:炎帝故里.jpg|thumb|Temple of Yandi in his reputed birthplace in [[Suizhou]], [[Hubei]].]]
''Chìdì'' (赤帝 "Red Deity" or "Red Emperor") or ''Chìshén'' (赤神 "Red God"), also known as the ''Nándì'' (南帝 "South Deity") or ''Nányuèdàdì'' (南岳大帝 "Great Deity of the Southern Peak"), as a human was ''[[Shennong|Shénnóng]]'' (神农 "Farmer God" or "Plowing God"), who is also the same as ''[[Yan Emperor|Yándì]]'' (炎帝 "[[fire of knowledge|Flame Deity]]" or "Fiery Deity"), a function occupied by different gods and god-kings in mytho-history. Shennong is also one of the Three Patrons, specifically the patron of humanity (人皇 ''Rénhuáng''), and the point of intersection of the Three Patrons and Huangdi.

He is also associated with ''[[Chiyou|Chīyóu]]'' (蚩尤), the god of some southern peoples, in both iconography and myth, as both Shennong Yandi and Chiyou fought against the Yellow Emperor, although Chiyou is traditionally considered more violent and has the horns of a fighting bull, while Shennong Yandi is more peaceful and has the horns of a plowing buffalo.{{sfnb|Bonnefoy|1993|p=246}}

He is the manifestation of the supreme God associated with the essence of fire; his animal form is the Red Dragon (朱龙 ''Zhūlóng'') and his stellar animal is the phoenix. He is the god of agriculture, animal husbandry, medicinal plants and market.{{sfnb|Fowler|2005|pp=200–201}} In broader conceptualisation, he is the god of science and craft, and the patron of doctors and apothecaries.{{sfnb|Bonnefoy|1993|p=246}} His astral body is [[Mars]].{{sfnb|Sun|Kistemaker|1997|p=121}}

===Baidi—White Deity===

''Báidì'' (白帝 "White Emperor" or "White Deity") or ''Báishén'' (白神 "White God"), also known as the ''Xīdì'' (西帝 "West Deity") or ''Xīyuèdàdì'' (西岳大帝 "Great Deity of the Western Peak"), as a human was [[Shaohao|Shǎohào]] (少昊), and he is the manifestation of the supreme God associated with the essence of metal and autumn. His animal form is the White Dragon (白龙 ''Báilóng'') and his stellar animal is the tiger. His astral body is [[Venus]].{{sfnb|Sun|Kistemaker|1997|p=121}}

==Contrast between the Red and the Yellow Deities==
[[File:炎黄二帝巨型塑像正面视角.JPG|thumb|Statue and ceremonial complex of the Yellow and Red Deities in [[Zhengzhou]], [[Henan]].]]
In mythology, Huangdi and Yandi fought a [[Battle of Banquan|battle]] against each other; and Huang finally defeated Yan with the help of the Dragon (the controller of water, who is Huangdi himself).&lt;ref name="Keekok Lee"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Keekok|title=Warp and Weft, Chinese Language and Culture|publisher=Strategic Book Publishing|year=2008|isbn=1606932470}} pp. 156–157.&lt;/ref&gt;

This myth symbolises the equipoise of yin and yang, here the [[fire of knowledge]] (reason and craft) and earthly stability.&lt;ref name="Keekok Lee"/&gt; ''Yan'' 炎 is flame, scorching fire, or an excess of it (it is important to notice that graphically it is a double 火 ''huo'', "fire").&lt;ref name="Keekok Lee"/&gt;

As an excess of fire brings destruction to the earth, it has to be controlled by a ruling principle. Nothing is good in itself, without limits; good outcomes depend on the proportion in the composition of things and their interactions, never on extremes in absolute terms.&lt;ref name="Keekok Lee"/&gt; Huangdi and Yandi are complementary opposites, necessary for the existence of one another, and they are powers that exist together within the human being.

==History of the cult of the Five Deities==
{{Further information|Chinese theology}}
The worship of the Five Deities by both commoners and rulers of China is a very ancient practice, harkening back at least to the [[Neolithic]].{{sfnb|Little|Eichman|2000|p=250|ps=. It describes a [[Ming dynasty]] painting representing (among other figures) the Wudi: "In the foreground are the gods of the Five Directions, dressed as emperors of high antiquity, holding tablets of rank in front of them. [...] These gods are significant because they reflect the cosmic structure of the world, in which ''yin'', ''yang'' and the Five Phases (Elements) are in balance. They predate religious Taoism, and may have originated as chthonic gods of the Neolithic period. Governing all directions (east, south, west, north and center), they correspond not only to the Five Elements, but to the seasons, the Five Sacred Peaks, the Five Planets, and zodiac symbols as well. [...]".}} Already in the theology of the [[Shang dynasty]], the supreme God of Heaven (''Shangdi'' or ''Di'') was conceived as manifesting in a fourfold form and will, the four 方 ''fāng'' ("directions" or "sides") and their 風 ''fēng'' ("winds").{{sfnb|Didier|2009|pp=143–144, Vol. II}}

===Qin dynasty===
[[File:Tai'an Dai Miao 2015.08.13 10-17-53.jpg|thumb|Main hall of the Dai Temple (岱庙 ''Dàimiào'') at [[Mount Tai]]. As the major one of the [[Dongyue Temple|Eastern Peak Temples]], dedicated to the Bluegreen Deity, the spring aspect of the Highest Deity identified with [[Jupiter]],{{sfnb|Zhou|2005|loc=''passim''}} it is a site of fire sacrifice to Di since prehistoric times.{{sfnb|Zhou|2005|p=1}} Mount Tai is the holiest of the [[Sacred Mountains of China|China's sacred mountains]]; according to mythology it formed from [[Pangu]]'s head after his body's dissection.]]
The official religion and ritual of the state of [[Qin (state)|Qin]] (9th century BCE–221 BCE) was largely based on that of the [[Zhou dynasty]] (c. 1046 BCE–256 BCE). The emperors worshipped the supreme God at a location in the suburbs of their capital [[Xianyang]].{{sfnb|Lagerwey|Kalinowski|2008|p=783}} The cults of the White, Green, Yellow and Red Deities had been celebrated separately in different parts of the state. In 677 BCE, Yong, an ancient sacred site where the Yellow Emperor himself was said to have sacrificed and the Zhou dynasty carried out ''jiào'' 醮 rituals, or "suburban sacrifices", became the capital of Qin.{{sfnb|Lagerwey|Kalinowski|2008|p=784}}

It is attested that in 671 BCE, Duke Xuan (675–664) carried out the sacrifices for the Green Deity in Mi, south of the [[Wei River]]. Then, Duke Ling (?–384) instituted the sacred sites of Shàng (上 "Above") and Xià (下 "Below"), for the Yellow and Red Deities, in [[Wuyang County|Wuyang]], near Yong. Originally, the sacrifice for the White Deity had been carried out in 769 BCE by Duke Xiang (778–766) in Xi, near [[Lanzhou]] in [[Gansu]]. In 753 they were carried out by Duke Wen (765–716) in Fu, northeast [[Shaanxi]].{{sfnb|Lagerwey|Kalinowski|2008|p=784}}

In 253 BCE the great grandfather of [[Qin Shihuang]] unified the imperial cult of the four forms of God in Yong, constructing there altars for the White, Green, Yellow and Red Deities.{{sfnb|Lagerwey|Kalinowski|2008|p=784}} In 219, Qin Shihuang, founder of the [[Qin dynasty|Qin empire]] (221 BCE–206 BCE), personally sacrificed at [[Mount Tai]], the sacred mountain at the centre of [[Shandong]], a site for the worship of the supreme godhead in the erstwhile states of [[Qi (state)|Qi]] and [[Lu (state)|Lu]]. He modelled the sacrifice on that performed at Yong, in alignment with the Qin tradition, consisting of three types of victims—horses, rams and oxen.{{sfnb|Lagerwey|Kalinowski|2008|p=783}}

===Han dynasty===
[[File:VM Mu-Huo-Tu-Jin-Shui zhi Shen 4594.jpg|thumb|Tablet in the [[Temple of Heaven]] of [[Beijing]], written in [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Manchu language|Manchu]], dedicated to the Five Deities. The Manchu word ''usiha'', meaning "star", explains that this tablet is dedicated to the five planets: Jupiter, Mars, Saturn, Venus and Mercury and the movements which they govern.]]
The ritual system of the early emperors of the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BCE–220 AD) was not different from that of the Qin, with the only change consisting in the integration of the Black Deity by Gaozu or Liu Bang (206–195), the first emperor of the dynasty.{{sfnb|Lagerwey|Kalinowski|2008|p=785}} However, Han state religion soon found itself divided between two factions. On one hand there were the [[Confucianism|Confucians]] who pushed for a new ritual system and a religio-political centralisation around the worship of the God of Heaven by the emperor, the God of Heaven's son, and the worship of lesser deities who had to be approved by the Confucians themselves, who considered themselves the only ones capable of interpreting the signs of Heaven in accordance with the [[Chinese classics|classics]]. On the other hand there were the ''[[fangshi]]'' (方士 "masters of directions"), ritual masters who formulated what would have been called the "[[Huang–Lao]]" proto-Taoist religious movement, who presented themselves as the continuators of the traditions of the erstwhile kingdoms, and who emphasised the worship of local deities integrated into a theology in which the supreme God of Heaven was named ''[[Chinese theology#Taiyi|Taiyi]]'' ("Great One"), and its human manifestation was the ancestral [[Yellow Emperor]] whom the emperors had to imitate.{{sfnb|Lagerwey|Kalinowski|2008|pp=777–779}}

The imperial temple at Yong which was established by the great grandfather of Qin Shihuang was rearranged placing the altars of the gods each in its respective direction, and that of the Yellow Deity at the centre. Outside Yong, two other temples dedicated to the Five Deities were built during the reign of [[Emperor Wen of Han|Emperor Wen]] (180–157), one in Weiyang, northeast of [[Chang'an]], and one in Chengji near the modern county of [[Tongwei County|Tongwei]] in [[Gansu]]. The sacrifices at Yong held a central positions and were carried out every three years by the emperor. If the emperor was absent, the rituals were performed by masters of rites, at various times throughout the year based on the ritual calendar of the Qin.{{sfnb|Lagerwey|Kalinowski|2008|p=785}}

In 113 BCE, [[Emperor Wu of Han]] innovated the Confucian state religion integrating the Huang–Lao conception of Taiyi with the Five Deities and the cult of ''[[Houtu]]'' ("Queen of the Earth"). In 135 BCE, the ''fangshi'' Miu Ji, from Bo in modern Shandong, insisted that Taiyi was the same supreme God, master of the Five Deities, worshipped since remote antiquity by the emperors through the three-victims sacrifice.{{sfnb|Lagerwey|Kalinowski|2008|p=785}} The rite lasted seven days and took place at a temple with "eight entrances for the [[numen|numina]]" in the southeastern suburb of the capital. In conformity with the instructions of Miu Ji, the emperor built a temple in the outskirts of Chang'an and appointed a great invocator (''taizhu'') to conduct the sacrifices.{{sfnb|Lagerwey|Kalinowski|2008|p=786}} Twenty years later—under the influence of another prominent court ''fangshi'', Gongsun Qing—the sacrifice was held by the emperor in person.{{sfnb|Lagerwey|Kalinowski|2008|p=786}} A temple of Taiyi and the Five Deities was built in Ganquan, 70km northeast of Chang'an.{{sfnb|Lagerwey|Kalinowski|2008|p=786}} Regarding the liturgy, sacrificial protocol and architectural layout, the sites of Ganquan and Mount Tai followed the model of Yong.{{sfnb|Lagerwey|Kalinowski|2008|p=785}} Besides the highest gods of the pantheon, the emperor or the central administration celebrated the cults of other gods, including those devoted to mountains and rivers, the sun and moon, stars and constellations, and heroes.{{sfnb|Lagerwey|Kalinowski|2008|p=788}}

In later times the expansion of the empire to different provinces and peoples was accompanied by a policy of identification or association of native gods and their cults to the imperial Han pantheon, so that the cults officially celebrated by the administration proliferated to the hundreds. In 31 BCE, Confucians at the court, especially Kuang Heng and Zhang Tan, disposed a reform of the state sacrifices, suppressing hundreds of local sacrifices and restricting those performed by the emperor in person only to the worship of Taiyi and Houtu, or Heaven and Earth.{{sfnb|Lagerwey|Kalinowski|2008|pp=790–793}}

'''''Ziziphus spina-christi''''', known as the '''Christ's thorn jujube''', is an evergreen tree or plant native to northern and tropical [[Africa]], [[Southern Asia|Southern]] and [[Western Asia]]. It is native to the regions [[Levant]], [[East Africa]] and some tropical countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldagroforestry.org/treedb/AFTPDFS/Zizyphus_spina-christi.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
In the Levant, it grows in valleys up to an elevation of 500&amp;nbsp;m.&lt;ref&gt;Zohary M. Flora Palaestina. II.

==Cultural and religious references==
In the Levant, a hundred years ago, it was called ''[[Sidrat al-Muntaha|sidr]]'' (associated with the [[Sidrat al-Muntaha|Lote-trees]] of the [[Quran]]) and was common in the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]] and around [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Illustrated Bible Dictionary and Treasury of Biblical History, Biography, Geography, Doctrine, and Literature: With Numerous Illustrations and Important Chronological Tables and Maps. |author=[[Matthew George Easton|Easton, M.G., M.A., D.D.]] |year=1893 |location=London, Edinburgh and New York |publisher=T. Nelson and Sons |page=688 |url= |quote=«It overruns a great part of the Jordan valley.» p.174. Easton argues that the spina-christi is too brittle to be bent into a crown. He suggests another local plant which he says is called «nabk». |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There were some folklore traditions that said the trees were protected by benevolent spirits or dead saints ([[Wali|''weli'']]). By some traditions, it was the tree from which Jesus' [[crown of thorns]] was made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flowersinisrael.com/Ziziphusspina-christi_page.htm |title=Ziziphus spina-christi |publisher=Flowersinisrael.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Matthew George Easton|Easton]] argues that the spina-christi is too brittle to be bent into a crown, and suggests another local plant which he says is called "[[Ziziphus lotus|nabk]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Matthew George Easton|Easton, M.G., M.A., D.D.]] (1893) 'Illustrated Bible Dictionary and Treasury of Biblical History, Biography, Geography, Doctrine, and Literature With Numerous Illustrations and Important Chronological Tables and Maps.'' T. Nelson and Sons, London, Edinburgh and New York. p.174&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest known Ziziphus is located south of Jerusalem, in Ayn Husb, Palestine.
It estimated to be about 2000 years old. It is believed locally to be the very tree from which Jesus' crown of thorns was made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oldest trees in Israel|url=https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A2%D7%A6%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A2%D7%AA%D7%99%D7%A7%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%91%D7%90%D7%A8%D7%A5_%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%9C}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=February 2018}}
