'''Al-Qalamoun''' ([[Arabic]]: القلمون) is a [[Mediterranean]] seaside town of the [[North Governorate]] of [[Lebanon]] in the [[Tripoli District]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.qalamoun.org  Qalamoun Official Homepage]&lt;/ref&gt; The town is 5&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://tripoli-city.org/neighbour.html#qalamoun Towns and Villages Neighbouring Tripoli Lebanon]&lt;/ref&gt; and is also the first town south of Tripoli.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lebanon-tourism.gov.lb/SiteDetails.aspx?Sites=324 Al Qalamoun]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
During Greco-Roman times Al-Qalamoun was known as Kalamos or Kalomo, while during the Crusades the town was known as Calmont or Calamón.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lebanonatlas.com/lebanonmajorcities/North/Qalamoun/index.htm |title=Major Cities – Qalamoun |access-date=2010-01-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724175130/http://www.lebanonatlas.com/lebanonmajorcities/North/Qalamoun/index.htm |archive-date=2008-07-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://translate.google.com.au/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=pt&amp;u=http://www.kfs10.com.br/loubnan/qalamoun.html&amp;ei=DDVES_2ZFpaXkQXFk9iDCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CBIQ7gEwBDhk&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Dal-Qalamoun,%2Blebanon%26hl%3Den%26rlz%3D1T4ADBR_enAU318AU320%26sa%3DN%26start%3D100 Al Qalamoun]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other modern day names for Al-Qalamoun include: El-Qalmoun, Al-Qalamun, El-Qalmoûn, Al-Qalamūn and El-Qalamoûn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fallingrain.com/world/LE/3/Al_Qalamun.html Al Qalamun, Lebanon Page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031033649/http://www.fallingrain.com/world/LE/3/Al_Qalamun.html |date=October 31, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Al-Qalamoun has a history spanning 5000  years and during its history was an agricultural village.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tripoli-city.org/neighbour.html#qalamoun Towns and Villages Neighbouring Tripoli Lebanon]&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times it has become a center for metal smiths working in copper, brass and bronze. This occurred after metal workers and  artisans from Tripoli's Souk an-Nahhassine (the traditional market of Tripoli) moved to Al-Qalamoun several decades ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lebanonatlas.com/lebanonmajorcities/North/Qalamoun/index.htm |title=Major Cities – Qalamoun |access-date=2010-01-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724175130/http://www.lebanonatlas.com/lebanonmajorcities/North/Qalamoun/index.htm |archive-date=2008-07-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://translate.google.com.au/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=pt&amp;u=http://www.kfs10.com.br/loubnan/qalamoun.html&amp;ei=DDVES_2ZFpaXkQXFk9iDCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CBIQ7gEwBDhk&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Dal-Qalamoun,%2Blebanon%26hl%3Den%26rlz%3D1T4ADBR_enAU318AU320%26sa%3DN%26start%3D100 Al Qalamoun]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lebanon-hotels.com/tourism/QALAMOUN/ Al Qalamoun]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lebanon-tourism.gov.lb/SiteDetails.aspx?Sites=324 Al Qalamoun]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tripoli-city.org/neighbour.html#qalamoun Towns and Villages Neighbouring Tripoli Lebanon]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buildings==
In Al-Qalamoun there exists an old mosque known as the Bahr Mosque (mosque of the sea). As circulated among the citizens of the town, the mosque dates back to about 800 years ago. This is ascertained by a three-line tablet pasted on the wall besides the pulpit (527 A.H./1132 C.E.). This date coincides with the time during which [[County of Tripoli|Tripoli was under the Crusaders' rule]]. The mosque was restored by Sheikh Ali al-Baghdadi (d. 1192 A.H./1778 C.E.). The mosque is composed of two large halls. It was constructed using sandstone, as in the case of the mosques in Tripoli. The upper side of the wall has adorned cornices and above the mosque is a new minaret.

South from the Bahr Mosque is the Ayn el-Jami'i prayer house. As circulated among the citizens of the city, the mosque dates back to the Crusaders. Muslims constructed this place near a water source, then it developed into a prayer house, then became the Ayn Mosque. A charitable association transformed the mosque into a theological school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tripoli-city.org/neighbour.html#qalamoun Towns and Villages Neighbouring Tripoli Lebanon]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
The main street (avenue) in the town is lined with small workshops and showrooms where brass bowls, candlesticks and other objects are produced (hammered out) in the old traditional way. A good look around these shops can reveal interesting antique pieces as well.  Roadside stands also sell olive oil products and fruit juices and syrups made from cranberry, mulberry, lemon, orange and other juices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://translate.google.com.au/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=pt&amp;u=http://www.kfs10.com.br/loubnan/qalamoun.html&amp;ei=DDVES_2ZFpaXkQXFk9iDCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CBIQ7gEwBDhk&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Dal-Qalamoun,%2Blebanon%26hl%3Den%26rlz%3D1T4ADBR_enAU318AU320%26sa%3DN%26start%3D100 Al Qalamoun]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lebanon-hotels.com/tourism/QALAMOUN/ Al Qalamoun]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kalamoun.com/  Kalamoun Homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lebanon-tourism.gov.lb/SiteDetails.aspx?Sites=324 Al Qalamoun]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lebanonatlas.com/lebanonmajorcities/North/Qalamoun/index.htm |title=Major Cities – Qalamoun |access-date=2010-01-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724175130/http://www.lebanonatlas.com/lebanonmajorcities/North/Qalamoun/index.htm |archive-date=2008-07-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Qalamoun is also famous for distilled flower and rose essences, that are used to add a nice flavor and smell to sweets.

Antiochus was the first Seleucid king to use divine epithets on coins, perhaps inspired by the [[Graeco-Bactrian|Bactrian]] Hellenistic kings who had earlier done so, or else building on the ruler cult that his father Antiochus the Great had codified within the Seleucid Empire. These epithets included {{lang|grc|Θεὸς Ἐπιφανής}} "manifest god", and, after his defeat of Egypt, {{lang|grc|Νικηφόρος}} "bringer of victory".&lt;ref&gt;C.

Astin, ''et al.'', ''Rome and the Mediterranean to 133 B.C.'', ''The Cambridge Ancient History'', volume 8, p. 341&lt;/ref&gt; However, Antiochus also tried to interact with common people by appearing in the public bath houses and applying for municipal offices, and his often eccentric behavior and capricious actions led some of his contemporaries to call him ''Epimanes'' ("The Mad One"), a word play on his title ''Epiphanes''.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9007863/Antiochus-IV-Epiphanes Encyclopædia Britannica Online: Antiochus IV Epiphanes]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/26*.html Polybius 26.10]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Rise to power===

Antiochus was a member of the Greek-speaking [[List of Seleucid rulers|Seleucid dynasty]] and was the son and potential successor of [[Antiochus III the Great]],&lt;ref name="Nelson 2014"&gt;{{cite book |title= NIV, The Chronological Study Bible, eBook |last= Nelson |first= Thomas |year= 2014 |publisher= Thomas Nelson Inc |isbn= 9781401680138 |quote= Antiochus iV—Epiphanes or Epimanes?

His older brother [[Seleucus IV Philopator]] followed his father onto the throne in 187 BC, and Antiochus was exchanged for his nephew [[Demetrius I Soter]], the son and heir of Seleucus.

Seleucus was assassinated by the [[usurper]] [[Heliodorus (minister)|Heliodorus]] in 175 BC, but Antiochus in turn ousted him. Seleucus' legitimate heir Demetrius I Soter was still a hostage in Rome, so Antiochus [[coup d'état|seized the throne]] for himself with the help of King [[Eumenes II]] of [[Pergamon]], proclaiming himself co-regent with another son of Seleucus, an infant named Antiochus (whom he then murdered a few years later).&lt;ref&gt;M. Zambelli, "L'ascesa al trono di Antioco IV Epifane di Siria," ''[[Rivista di Filologia e di Istruzione Classica]]'' 38 (1960) 363–389&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wars against Egypt===
{{Main|Sixth_Syrian_War#Sixth_Syrian_War_.28170-168_BC.29|l1=Sixth Syrian War}}
The guardians of King [[Ptolemy VI Philometor]] demanded the return of [[Coele-Syria]] in 170 BC, but Antiochus launched a preemptive strike against Egypt, conquering all but [[Alexandria]] and capturing King Ptolemy. To avoid alarming [[Rome]], Antiochus allowed Ptolemy VI to continue ruling as a [[Puppet state|puppet king]]. Upon Antiochus' withdrawal, the city of Alexandria chose a new king, one of Ptolemy's brothers, also named [[Ptolemy VIII Physcon|Ptolemy (VIII Euergetes)]]. The Ptolemy brothers agreed to rule Egypt jointly instead of fighting a civil war.{{citation needed|reason=Livy points out that the two brothers willingly ruled together through the winter.|date=November 2015}}

In 168 BC, Antiochus led a second attack on Egypt and also sent a fleet to capture [[Cyprus]]. Before he reached Alexandria, his path was blocked by a single elderly Roman ambassador named [[Gaius Popillius Laenas]] who delivered a message from the [[Roman Senate]] directing Antiochus to withdraw his armies from Egypt and Cyprus or consider himself in a state of war with the Roman Republic.  Antiochus said he would discuss it with his council, whereupon the Roman envoy drew a line in the sand around Antiochus and said: "Before you leave this circle, give me a reply that I can take back to the Roman Senate." This implied Rome would declare war if the King stepped out of the circle without committing to leave Egypt immediately. Weighing his options, Antiochus decided to withdraw. Only then did Popillius agree to shake hands with him.&lt;ref name="Polybius 29.27.4"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/29*.html Polybius 29.27.4], Livy 45.12.4ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persecution of Jews===
[[File:Antiokhos IV.jpg|thumb|right|Bust of Antiochus IV at the [[Altes Museum]] in [[Berlin]].]]
The Seleucids, like the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemies]] before them, held a mild [[suzerainty]] over [[Judea]]: they respected Jewish culture and protected Jewish institutions. This policy was drastically reversed by Antiochus IV, resulting in harsh persecutions and a revolt against his rule, the [[Maccabean Revolt]].{{r|gruen}}{{rp|238}}

==Books of Maccabees==
According to the authors of the ''[[Books of the Maccabees]]'', while Antiochus was busy in Egypt, a rumor spread that he had been killed. In [[Judea]], the [[deposition (politics)|deposed]] High Priest [[Jason (high priest)|Jason]] gathered a force of 1000 soldiers and made a surprise attack on the city of [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/apo/ma2005.htm 2 Maccabees 5:5]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Menelaus (High Priest)|Menelaus]], the High Priest appointed by Antiochus, was forced to flee Jerusalem during a riot. King Antiochus returned from Egypt in 168 BC, enraged by his defeat; he attacked Jerusalem and restored Menelaus, then executed many Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]], ''[[The Jewish War]]'' 1:1:1–2&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|When these happenings were reported to the king, he thought that Judea was in revolt. Raging like a wild animal, he set out from Egypt and took Jerusalem by storm. He ordered his soldiers to cut down without mercy those whom they met and to slay those who took refuge in their houses. There was a massacre of young and old, a killing of women and children, a slaughter of virgins and infants. In the space of three days, eighty thousand were lost, forty thousand meeting a violent death, and the same number being sold into slavery.|[[2 Maccabees]] 5:11–14}}
Antiochus decided to side with the [[Hellenistic Judaism|Hellenized Jews]] in order to consolidate his empire and to strengthen his hold over the region. He outlawed [[Judaism|Jewish religious rites and traditions]] kept by observant Jews and ordered the worship of [[Zeus]] as the supreme god (2 Maccabees 6:1–12). This was anathema to the Jews and they refused, so Antiochus sent an army to enforce his decree. The city of Jerusalem was destroyed because of the resistance, many were slaughtered, and Antiochus established a military Greek [[citadel]] called the [[Acra (fortress)|Acra]].

The date of Antiochus's persecution of the Jews in Jerusalem is variously given as 168 or 167 BC. In their commentary on the ''[[Book of Daniel]]'', Newsom and Breed argue for 167, although they state that good arguments can be made for either chronology.&lt;ref&gt;Newsom, Carol Ann; Breed, Brennan (2014). ''Daniel: A Commentary''. Presbyterian Publish Corp. [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=XZK7BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=%22Did+antiochus+IV+begin+his+persecution+of+Judaism+in+168+or+167?%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwicoeH5g6vXAhUMerwKHehFCfIQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Did%20antiochus%20IV%20begin%20his%20persecution%20of%20Judaism%20in%20168%20or%20167%3F%22&amp;f=false p. 26]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Mina Antiochus IV.PNG|thumb|[[Mina (unit)|Mina]] of Antiochus IV Epiphanes.]]
Traditionally, as expressed in the [[1 Maccabees|First]] and [[2 Maccabees|Second Books of the Maccabees]], the Maccabean Revolt was painted as a national resistance to a foreign political and cultural oppression. In modern times, however, scholars have argued that the king was instead intervening in a [[civil war]] between the traditionalist Jews in the country and the Hellenized Jews in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Jewish Literacy: The Most Important Things to Know about the Jewish Religion, Its People, and Its History|last=Telushkin |first=Joseph  |year= 1991|publisher= W. Morrow|isbn= 0-688-08506-7|page=114 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Religions of the Ancient World: A Guide|last=Johnston |first=Sarah Iles  |year=2004 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0-674-01517-7 |page= 186}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Jewish Way: Living the Holidays|last= Greenberg|first=Irving  |year=1993 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn= 0-671-87303-2|page= 29}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Joseph P. Schultz: &lt;blockquote&gt;Modern scholarship on the other hand considers the Maccabean revolt less as an uprising against foreign oppression than as a civil war between the orthodox and reformist parties in the Jewish camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Judaism and the Gentile Faiths: Comparative Studies in Religion |last=Schultz |first=Joseph P.|year= 1981|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press |isbn= 0-8386-1707-7|page= 155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It seems that the traditionalists, with Hebrew/Aramaic names such as [[Onias III|Onias]], contested with the Hellenizers, with Greek names such as [[Jason (high priest)|Jason]] and [[Menelaus (High Priest)|Menelaus]], over who would be the [[High Priest of Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= A Survey of the New Testament|last=Gundry|first=Robert H.|year=2003|publisher=Zondervan|isbn= 0-310-23825-0|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors have pointed to the possibility of socioeconomic motives, as well as religious ones, as having been primary drivers of the civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible|last=Freedman|first= David Noel|author2=Allen C. Myers |author3=Astrid B. Beck |year=2000 |publisher= Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=0-8028-2400-5|page=837}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What began in many respects as a [[civil war]] escalated when the Hellenistic kingdom of [[Coele-Syria]] sided with Hellenizing Jews in their conflict with the traditionalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Survey of Israel's History|last=Wood|first=Leon James|year= 1986|publisher= Zondervan|isbn= 0-310-34770-X|page=357 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the conflict escalated, Antiochus took the side of the Hellenizers by prohibiting the religious practices around which the traditionalists had rallied. This could explain why the king banned the traditional religion of a whole people, in a total departure from typical Seleucid practice in other settings.&lt;ref&gt;Tchrikover, Victor. ''Hellenistic Civilization and the Jews''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final years===
[[File:151.The Punishment of Antiochus.jpg|thumb|Punishment of Antiochus, engraving by [[Gustave Doré]]]]
King [[Mithridates I of Parthia]] took advantage of Antiochus' western problems and attacked from the east, seizing the city of [[Herat]] in 167 BC and disrupting the direct trade route to India, effectively splitting the Greek world in two.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Antiochus recognized the potential danger in the east but was unwilling to give up control of [[Judea]]. He sent a commander named [[Lysias (Syrian chancellor)|Lysias]] to deal with the Maccabees, while the King himself led the main Seleucid army against the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]]. Antiochus had initial success in his eastern campaign, including the reoccupation of Armenia, but he died suddenly of disease in 164 BC.&lt;ref&gt; Merrins, Edward M. "The Deaths Of Antiochus IV., Herod The Great, And Herod Agrippa I" Bibiothica Sacra BSAC 061:243 (Jul 1904) &lt;/ref&gt;

According to the scroll of Antiochus, when Antiochus heard that his army had been defeated in Judea, he boarded a ship and fled to the coastal cities. Wherever he came the people rebelled and called him "The Fugitive," so he drowned himself in the sea.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/2830773/jewish/Megilat-Antiochus-The-Scroll-of-the-Hasmoneans.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[2 Maccabees|Second Book of Maccabees]], he was horrifically injured in the following manner, which eventually led to his death:
{{Quote|5 But the all-seeing Lord, the God of Israel, struck him with an incurable and invisible blow. As soon as he stopped speaking he was seized with a pain in his bowels, for which there was no relief, and with sharp internal tortures— 6 and that very justly, for he had tortured the bowels of others with many and strange inflictions. 7 Yet he did not in any way stop his insolence, but was even more filled with arrogance, breathing fire in his rage against the Jews, and giving orders to drive even faster. And so it came about that he fell out of his chariot as it was rushing along, and the fall was so hard as to torture every limb of his body. 8 Thus he who only a little while before had thought in his superhuman arrogance that he could command the waves of the sea, and had imagined that he could weigh the high mountains in a balance, was brought down to earth and carried in a litter, making the power of God manifest to all.|2 Maccabees 9:5-9|NRSV&lt;ref&gt;2 Macc. 9:5-9|NRSV&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Legacy==
===Jewish tradition===
Antiochus IV ruled the Jews from 175 to 164 BC. He is remembered as a major villain and persecutor in the Jewish traditions associated with [[Hanukkah]], including the [[Books of the Maccabees|books]] of [[Maccabees]] and the "[[Megillat Antiochus|Scroll of Antiochus]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sichosinenglish.org/books/vedibarta-bam/155.htm Vedibarta Bam — And You Shall Speak of Them: Megilat Antiochus The Scroll of the Hasmoneans&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201162529/http://www.sichosinenglish.org/books/vedibarta-bam/155.htm |date=February 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbinical sources refer to him as הרשע ''harasha'' ("the wicked"); the ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' concluded that "[s]ince Jewish and heathen sources agree in their characterization of him, their portrayal is evidently correct", summarizing this portrayal as one of a cruel and vainglorious ruler who tried to force on all the peoples of his realm a Hellenic culture, "the true essence of which he can scarcely be said to have appreciated".&lt;ref name="je"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Antiochus IV., Epiphanes |encyclopedia=[[Jewish Encyclopedia]] |publisher=Funk and Wagnalls |volume=Volume I: Aach–Apocalyptic literature |year=1925 |pages=634–635 |url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.49015002282318;view=1up;seq=690}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether Antiochus's policy was directed at extermination of [[Judaism]] as a culture and a religion, though, is debatable on the grounds that his persecution was limited to Judea and Samaria (Jews in the [[Jewish Diaspora|diaspora]] were exempt), and that Antiochus was hardly an ideologically motivated Hellenizer. [[Erich S. Gruen]] suggests that, instead, he was driven more by pragmatics such as the need to gather income from Judea.&lt;ref name="gruen"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |authorlink=Erich S.

[[File:Apelt Grabmal.jpg|thumb|Tomb of [[Peter of Aspelt|Peter von Aspelt]], Prince-Archbishop of Mainz and Archchancellor of Germany (1306-1320), [[Mainz Cathedral]]]]

An '''archchancellor''' ({{lang-la|archicancellarius}}, {{lang-de|Erzkanzler}}) or chief chancellor was a title given to the highest dignitary of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and also used occasionally during the [[Middle Ages]] to denote an official who supervised the work of chancellors or notaries.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Archchancellor|volume=2|page=358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] successors of [[Pepin the Short]] appointed chancellors over the whole Frankish realm in the ninth century. [[Hincmar]] refers to this official as a ''summus cancellarius'' in ''De ordine palatii et regni'' and an 864 charter of King [[Lothair I]] refers to [[Agilmar, Archbishop of Vienne]], as archchancellor, a word which also begins appearing in chronicles about that time.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; The last Carolingian archchancellor in [[West Francia]] was [[Adalberon (Archbishop of Reims)|Archbishop Adalberon of Reims]] (969-988), with the accession of [[Hugh Capet]] the office was replaced by a ''Chancelier de France''.

At the court of [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]], then [[List of German monarchs|King of Germany]], the title seems to have been an appanage of the [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Archbishop of Mainz]]. After Otto had finally deposed King [[Berengar II of Italy]] and was crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]] in 962, a similar office was created for the Imperial [[Kingdom of Italy (medieval)|Kingdom of Italy]]. By the early eleventh century, this office was perennially held by the [[Electorate of Cologne|Archbishop of Cologne]]. Theoretically, the archbishop of Mainz took care of Imperial affairs for Germany and the Archbishop of Cologne for Italy, though the latter often used deputies, his see being outside of his kingdom. A third office was created about 1042 by Emperor [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]] the recently acquired [[Kingdom of Arles|Kingdom of Burgundy]]. He initially bestowed it on Archbishop [[Hugh I of Besançon]].&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Weinfurter, ''The Salian Century: Main Currents in an Age of Transition'' (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1999), p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; It only appears in the hands of the [[Archbishopric of Trier|Archbishop of Trier]] in the twelfth century as the chancellory of Arles, as Burgundy was then known.

By the [[Golden Bull of 1356]], Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] confirmed the threefold division of the archchancellory among the three ecclesiastical [[Prince-elector]]s of the Empire. Actual governmental functions like calling the [[Imperial election]]s, however, were carried out by the Mainz archbishops alone. The office in this form was part of the constitution of the Empire until the [[German Mediatisation]] in 1803, when Mainz was secularised. The last elector, [[Karl Theodor Anton Maria von Dalberg]], however, retained the title of archchancellor until the dissolution of the Empire in 1806. There was a marked resemblance between the medieval archchancellor and the later [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|chancellors]] of the [[German Empire]], the [[Weimar Republic]],
&lt;ref&gt;Reincke.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Austrian Empire.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; The title is continued by the present-day [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellors of Germany]] and [[Chancellor of Austria|Austria]].

'''''Argonautica Orphica''''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ὀρφέως Ἀργοναυτικά}}) is a [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[epic poem]] dating from the 5th–6th centuries CE. It is narrated in the first person in the name of [[Orpheus]] and tells the story of [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]]. It is not known who the real author is. The poem is found in manuscripts either on its own or together with the [[Orpheus#Orphic poems and rites|Orphic Hymns]] and other hymns such as the [[Homeric Hymns]] and those of [[Proclus]] and [[Callimachus]]. The poem was lost, but in the fifteenth century it was found and copied in a manuscript (Codex Matritensis gr. 4562) by the Neoplatonic Greek scholar [[Constantine Lascaris]], who considered a Pythagorean Orpheus.&lt;ref&gt;Russo (2004), 53-54.&lt;/ref&gt; Another related work is the ''Lithica'' (describing the properties and symbolism of different stones).

The narrative is basically similar to that in other versions of the story, such as the ''[[Argonautica]]'' of [[Apollonius Rhodius]], on which it is probably based. The main differences are the emphasis on the role of Orpheus and a more mythological, less realistic technique of narration. In the ''Argonautica Orphica'', unlike in Apollonius Rhodius, it is claimed that the ''[[Argo]]'' was the first ship ever built.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, [[Shoghi Effendi]], the head of the religion, planned an international teaching plan termed the [[Ten Year Crusade]]. During the teaching plan, Mr. and Mrs. [[Ali Nakhjavani]] drove by car with two African [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneers]] from [[Bahá'í Faith in Uganda|Uganda]] to open new countries to the religion. The first pioneer settled in what was then [[French Equatorial Africa]], and later [[Enoch Olinga]] went on to [[British Cameroon]].&lt;ref name="uk" /&gt; By 1954, growth in the [[Bahá'í Faith in Cameroon]] resulted in five young Bahá'ís who pioneered surrounding areas, each becoming a [[Knight of Bahá'u'lláh]] including [[Ghana]], and [[Togo]].

The church was disconnected from the Bahá'í community, but it applied the [[Bahá'í teachings]] with virtually all of the Cameroonian men on one large palm plantation. The church was established, flourished, and then collapsed utterly unrecognized and unknown to the Bahá'í pioneers and to the international Baha'i community until one of the founders tried to return the book. Both leaders of the church later officially joined the religion, and they helped form the first Local Spiritual Assembly of Calabar in 1957 and served in other positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Lee | first = Anthony A. | title = The Baha'i Church of Calabar, West Africa: The Problem of Levels in Religious History | journal = Occasional Papers in Shaykhi, Babi and Baha'i Studies | volume = 1 | issue = 6 |date=November 1997 | url = http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/bhpapers/vol1/africa1.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development of the community ==

By 1964, while associated with the regional National Spiritual Assembly of North West Africa, Nigeria had a Local Spiritual Assembly in [[Aba, Nigeria|Aba]] (Nigeria), [[Afikpo]], [[Akpabuyo]], Aningeje, Asata [[Enugu]](?), Calabar, [[Ibadan]], [[Lagos]], Nyaje, Owom, and [[Sapele, Nigeria|Sapele]], and smaller groups of Bahá'ís in [[Ebute Metta]], Ikot Okriba, Ojok, Old Ndebeji, Onitcha, and [[Oron, Nigeria|Oron]], and isolated Bahá'ís in [[Abakaliki]], [[Abeokuta]], Kontagura, Kwa Falls, Mbeban Village, and [[Umuahia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/handscause_statistics_1953-63&amp;chapter=1#22 "The Bahá'í Faith: 1844-1963: Information Statistical and Comparative, Including the Achievements of the Ten Year International Bahá'í Teaching &amp; Consolidation Plan 1953-1963"], compiled by [[Hands of the Cause]] residing in the Holy Land, pages 22 and 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the death of Shoghi Effendi, the elected [[Universal House of Justice]] was head of the religion and began to re-organize the Bahá'í communities of Africa by splitting off national communities to form their own National Assemblies, from 1967 though the 1990s.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web

'''Bhavani''' is a major river in [[Kongu Nadu]] region of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]]. It is the second longest river in [[Tamil Nadu]] and a major tributary of the [[Kaveri River]].

==Hydrography==
Bhavani river originates from [[Nilgiris|Nilgiri hills]] of the [[Western Ghats]], enters the [[Silent Valley National Park]] in [[Kerala]] and flows back towards Tamil Nadu.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} The Bhavani is a {{convert|217|km|mi|adj=on}} long perennial river fed mostly by the [[southwest monsoon]] and supplemented by the [[northeast monsoon]]. Its watershed drains an area of {{convert|0.62|e6ha|mi2}} spread over Tamil Nadu (87%), [[Kerala]] (9%) and [[Karnataka]] (4%). The main river courses majorly through [[Coimbatore district]] and [[Erode district]] in Tamil Nadu. About 90 per cent of the river's water is used for agriculture [[irrigation]].

==Tributaries==
[[File:Bhavani-Kaveri-Sangamam.JPG|thumb|left|The confluence of the Bhavani and Kaveri rivers at Bhavani]]
Twelve major [[rivulet]]s including West and East Varagar rivers join Bhavani draining the southern [[Nilgiri hills|Nilgiri slopes]]. At Mukkali, Bhavani takes an abrupt 120-degree turn towards the northeast and flows for another {{convert|25|km|mi}} through Attappady plateau. It gets reinforced by the Kunda river coming from the north. [[Siruvani River|Siruvani river]], a perennial stream and the Kodungarapallam river, flowing from the south and southeast respectively join the Bhavani at [[Kerala]]-[[Tamil Nadu]] border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/south/human-chain-formed-against-kerala-s-plan-to-build-dam-on-river-siruvani-236005 |title=Human chain formed against Kerala's plan to build dam on River Siruvani|work=[[NDTV]]|date=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The river then flows east along the base of [[Nilgiris]] and enters the plains near Bathra Kaliamman temple at [[Mettupalayam, Coimbatore|Mettupalayam]] after joining with [[Coonoor|Coonoor river]] coming from northwest.

About {{convert|30|km|mi}} downstream, Moyar River, a major tributary originating in [[Mudumalai National Park]], flows in from the northwest, where it drains the valley between the northern slopes of the Nilgiris and the southern slopes of the Bilgiri Hills. After the Moyar it is blocked by the [[Bhavanisagar Dam|Lower Bhavani Dam]], feeding [[Lower Bhavani Project Canal]] near [[Sathyamangalam]] in [[Erode District]]. The river continues east for over {{convert|160|km|mi}} through Erode District, traversing [[Kodiveri Dam]], near [[Gobichettipalayam]] which feeds the Arakkankottai and Thadappalli canals constructed for agricultural purposes.&lt;ref name="Indian Archaeology, a Review"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=QQluAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=kongalvan&amp;dq=kongalvan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAWoVChMImLiUkuLsxwIVUhqOCh3aUAF2 |title=Indian Archaeology, a Review|publisher=Archaeological Survey of India|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small barrage across the river was built by Kalingarayan in 1283 AD to feed the {{convert|56|mi|km|adj=on|order=flip}} [[Kalingarayan irrigation canal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/01/17/stories/2007011700470300.htm|title=Kalingarayan Canal is 725 years old|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|access-date=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The river joins [[Kaveri river|Kaveri]] at [[Kooduthurai]] near [[Sangameswarar Temple]], [[Bhavani, Tamil Nadu|Bhavani]] where it is believed that the mystic [[Sarasvati River]] also joins the confluence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/performing-rituals-at-kooduthurai-becomes-risky/article4024478.ece|title=Performing rituals at Kooduthurai becomes risky|date=23 October 2012|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhavanisangameswarartemple.tnhrce.in/|title=Arulmigu Bhavani Sangameshwarar Temple|publisher=TNHRCE|access-date=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Black Elk Speaks''''' is a 1932 book by [[John G. Neihardt]], an American poet and writer, who relates the story of [[Black Elk]], an [[Oglala Lakota]] [[medicine man]]. Black Elk spoke in [[Lakota language|Lakota]] and Black Elk's son, Ben Black Elk, who was present during the talks, translated his father's words into English.&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/studies_in_american_indian_literatures/v017/17.1kaye.html Kaye, Frances W. "Interpreting the Legacy: John Neihardt and Black Elk Speaks  (review)"], ''[[Studies in American Indian Literatures]]'' – Volume 17, Number 1, Spring 2005, pp. 98–101&lt;/ref&gt; Neihardt made notes during these talks which he later used as the basis for his book.&lt;ref name=linden&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NUwUv67oRQcC&amp;dq=Black+Elk+Reader&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s George Linden, "John Neihardt and ''Black Elk Speaks''"], in ''The Black Elk Reader'', ed. Clyde Holler, Syracuse University Press, 2000, accessed 20 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The prominent psychologist [[Carl Jung]] read the book in the 1930s and urged its translation into German; in 1955, it was published as '''''Ich rufe mein Volk''''' ('''''I Call My People''''').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Neihardt|first=John G|title=Ich rufe mein Volk: Leben, Traum und Untergang der Ogalalla-Sioux von Schwarzer Hirsch [Übers. von Siegfried Lang]|date=1955|publisher=[[Walter Verlag]]|location=Olten|edition=1st German}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Reprinted in the US in 1961, with a 1988 edition named  '''''Black Elk Speaks: Being the Life Story of a Holy Man of the Oglala Sioux, as told through John G. Neihardt (Flaming Rainbow)''''' and a [[State University of New York Press]] 2008 Premier Edition annotated by [[Lakota language|Lakota]] scholar [[Raymond DeMallie]], the book has found an international audience. However, the book has come under fire for what critics describe as inaccurate representations of Lakota culture and beliefs. 

== Background ==
In the summer of 1930, as part of his research into the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] perspective on the [[Ghost Dance]] movement, the poet and writer [[John G. Neihardt]], already the Nebraska poet laureate, received the necessary permission from the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] to go to the [[Pine Ridge Reservation]]. Accompanied by his two daughters, he went to meet an [[Lakota people#Social divisions|Oglala]] holy man named [[Black Elk]]. His intention was to talk to someone who had participated in the Ghost Dance. For the most part, the reservations were not then open to visitors.&lt;ref name=hilda&gt;Neihardt, Hilda and Todd R. Wise (2000) "[https://books.google.com/books?id=NUwUv67oRQcC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=Black+Elk+Reader&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Black Elk and John G. Neihardt]," in ''The Black Elk Reader''&lt;/ref&gt;  At age 13, Black Elk had also been part of the [[Battle of the Little Big Horn]], and he survived the 1890 [[Wounded Knee Massacre]].

Neihardt recounts that Black Elk invited him back for interviews. Flying Hawk served as their translator.&lt;ref name=hilda/&gt; Neihardt writes that Black Elk told him of his [[Vision (spirituality)|visions]], including one in which he saw himself as a "sixth grandfather" - the spiritual representative of the earth and of mankind. Neihardt also states that Black Elk shared some of the Oglala rituals which he had performed as a healer, and that two men developed a close friendship. Neihardt's daughter, [[Hilda Neihardt]], says Black Elk adopted her, her sister, and their father as relatives, giving each of them Lakota names.&lt;ref name=hilda/&gt;

== Controversy ==
Though [[Black Elk]] was Oglala [[Lakota people|Lakota]], the book was written by Neihardt, a non-Native. While the book is lauded by non-Native audiences, and has been inspirational to many [[New Age]] groups, traditional Lakota people and Native American scholars do not consider the book to be representative of Lakota beliefs.&lt;ref name="DeMallie"&gt;DeMallie, Raymond (Nebraska University Press, 1985). ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Sixth_Grandfather.html?id=bXElCJTANaoC The Sixth Grandfather: Black Elk's Teachings Given to John G. Neihardt]'', {{ISBN|0803265646}}. Introduction and notes throughout the book.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Silvio"&gt;[http://www.ipl.org.ar/cgi-bin/ref/litcrit/litcrit.out.pl?ti=bla-680 Carl Silvio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007023844/http://www.ipl.org.ar/cgi-bin/ref/litcrit/litcrit.out.pl?ti=bla-680 |date=2007-10-07 }}, Internet Public Library, academic arguments on authorship, translation, and interpretation for prospective audiences have been written by Carl Silvio, among others.  Note: This site has been superseded since 2010 by www.ipl2.org, a consortium of universities, accessed 19 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; They have debated the accuracy of the account, which has elements of a collaborative autobiography, spiritual text, and other genres. The Indiana University professor [[Raymond J. DeMallie|Raymond DeMallie]], who has studied the Lakota by cultural and linguistic resources, published "The Sixth Grandfather" in 1985 including the original transcripts of the conversations with Black Elk, plus his own introduction, analysis and notes. He has questioned whether Neihardt's account is accurate and fully represents the views or words of Black Elk.&lt;ref name="DeMallie"/&gt;

The primary criticism made by DeMallie and similar scholars is that Neihardt, as the author and editor, may have exaggerated or altered some parts of the story to make it more accessible and marketable to the intended white audience of the 1930s, or because he did not fully understand the Lakota context.&lt;ref name="Silvio"/&gt; Late twentieth-century editions of the book by Nebraska University Press have addressed this issue by entitling the book as ''Black Elk Speaks, as told through John G. Neihardt (aka "Flaming Rainbow")''.&lt;ref name=hilda/&gt;

After serving as translator for his father in 1931, and increasingly after his father's death in 1950, Ben Black Elk visited local schools on the Pine Ridge Reservation to tell the traditional stories of the Lakota history and culture.

'''Ekaterina Fyodorovna Kolyschkine de Hueck Doherty''' {{post-nominals|country=CAN|CM}}, better known as '''Baroness Catherine Doherty''' (August 15, 1896 – December 14, 1985), was a Catholic social worker and founder of the [[Madonna House Apostolate]]. A pioneer of [[social justice]] and a renowned national speaker,
Doherty was also a prolific writer of hundreds of articles, best-selling author of dozens of books, and a dedicated wife and mother. Her cause for [[canonization]] as a [[saint#Roman Catholicism|saint]] is under consideration by the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name="Her Life"&gt;[http://www.catherinedoherty.org/life/ Catherine Doherty: Her Life], catherinedoherty.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Doherty was born Ekaterina Fyodorovna Kolyschkine (Екатерина Фёдоровна Колышкина) in [[Nizhny Novgorod]], [[Russian Empire]]. Her parents, Fyodor and Emma Thomson Kolyschkine, belonged to the minor [[nobility]] and were devout members of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] who had their child baptized in [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]] on September 15, 1896. She was not baptized on the same day that she was born because her mother was worried she might get a disease as she had been born on a train. Schooled abroad due to her father's job, she had an exposure to the Catholic Church in the form of her schooling in Alexandria (Egypt) where her father, an aristocrat, had been posted by the government.&lt;ref name=murray&gt;[http://www.catholicireland.net/servant-of-god-catherine-de-hueck-doherty/ Murray PP, John, "Servant of God: Catherine de Hueck Doherty", ''The Messenger'', July 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Her family returned to St. Petersburg in 1910, where she was enrolled in the prestigious Princess Obolensky Academy. In 1912, aged 15, she married her first cousin, Baron Boris de Hueck (1889–1947).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.madonnahouse.org/doherty/marriage_and_war.html "Catherine de Heuck Doherty", Madonna House]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the outbreak of [[World War I]], Baroness de Hueck became a [[Red Cross]] nurse at the front, experiencing the horrors of battle firsthand. On her return to St. Petersburg, she and Boris barely escaped the turmoil of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] with their lives, nearly starving to death as refugees in [[Finland]]. Together they made their way to England, where de Hueck was received into the Catholic Church on November 27, 1919.&lt;ref name=murray/&gt;

Emigrating to Canada with Boris, de Hueck gave birth to their only child, George, in Toronto in 1921. To make ends meet, she took various jobs, eventually travelling across the United States, giving talks on the [[Chautauqua]] lecture circuit.&lt;ref name=Fay&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4OszB8KwdjgC&amp;pg=PA213&amp;dq=Friendship+House&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=oEgPVbTSHcmvggTV2oKAAw&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Friendship%20House&amp;f=false Fay, Terence J., ''History of Canadian Catholics'', McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP, 2002] {{ISBN|9780773523135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Friendship House===
{{Main|Friendship House}}
Prosperous now, but deeply dissatisfied with a life of material comfort, her marriage in ruins, de Hueck began to feel the promptings of a deeper call through a passage that leaped to her eyes every time she opened the Bible: "Arise — go... sell all you possess... take up your cross and follow Me." Consulting with various priests and the bishop of the [[diocese]], she began her lay apostolate among the poor.

In 1932, she gave up all her possessions, lived among the multitude of poor people in downtown Toronto and established Friendship House with its soup kitchen. She gave food to them when she had none for herself – and offered Catholic education and fellowship, too. She was tagged as a communist sympathizer and, beleaguered by her own organization,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=bac926b6-c530-4f1e-90c8-b11e68a1d212 Jacobs, Donna,"The Unlikely Story of Catherine de Hueck", ''The Ottawa Citizen''; July 9, 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140617212724/http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=bac926b6-c530-4f1e-90c8-b11e68a1d212 |date=June 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Friendship House was forced to close in 1936. Catherine then went to Europe and spent a year investigating [[Catholic Action]]. On her return, she established the Friendship House at 34 West 135th Street in Harlem in 1937. The interracial charity center, in addition to distributing goods to the poor, conducted lectures and discussions to promote racial understanding.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/16/nyregion/catherine-de-hueck-doherty-charity-worker-is-dead-at-89.html New York Times obituary, December 16, 1985]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943, having received an [[annulment]] of her first marriage, as she had married her cousin, which is forbidden in the Roman Catholic Church, she married [[Eddie Doherty]], an American journalist, whom she had met when he was writing a story about her.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.catholicireland.net/servant-of-god-catherine-de-hueck-doherty/ Murray, John. "Servant of God: Catherine de Hueck Doherty", Catholic Ireland, November 30, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Madonna House===
{{Main|Madonna House Apostolate}}
Serious disagreements arose between the staff of Friendship House and its foundress, particularly surrounding her marriage. When these could not be resolved, Doherty and Eddie moved to [[Combermere, Ontario]], on May 17, 1947 to retire.&lt;ref name="Her Life" /&gt;  As she recovered, she started to serve the needs of the community.  What eventually blossomed was a new rural apostolate called [[Madonna House Apostolate|Madonna House]] that now numbers approximately 200 staff workers with 18 missionary field-houses throughout the world. {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

==Death==
Baroness Catherine de Hueck Doherty died on December 14, 1985, in Combermere at the age of 89. Since then, the cause for her [[canonization]] as a saint has been officially opened in the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;Pelton, Fr. Robert. "About the Author" in ''[http://www.madonnahouse.org/publications/doherty/poustinia.htm Poustinia: Encountering God in Silence, Solitude and Prayer]'' by Catherine Doherty. 3rd ed. Combermere: Madonna House Publications, 2000. ({{ISBN|0-921440-54-5}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duquin, Lorene Hanley. ''[http://www.madonnahouse.org/publications/other/tchtb.htm They Called Her the Baroness: The Life of Catherine de Hueck Doherty]''. New York: Alba House, 1995. ({{ISBN|0-8189-0827-0}})&lt;/ref&gt;

==Her spirituality==
"I considered Nazareth to be the center of my vocation. Only by being hidden would I be a light to my neighbor’s feet in the
slums," Doherty wrote. She believed that activism should be rooted in prayer and that faith should be brought to every aspect of daily life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conncoll.edu/images/content/Catherine-Doherty.pdf LaPointe, Fr. Larry, "Catherine de Hueck Doherty", Connecticut College] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901090455/http://www.conncoll.edu/images/content/Catherine-Doherty.pdf |date=September 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="The Little Mandate"===
The core of Doherty's spirituality is summarized in a "distillation" of the Gospel which she called "The Little Mandate" — words which she believed she received from [[Jesus Christ]] and which guided her life.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, Catherine. "The Little Mandate", Chap. 13 in ''[http://www.madonnahouse.org/publications/doherty/sobornost.htm Sobornost: Experiencing Unity of Mind, Heart and Soul]'', 2nd ed. Combermere: Madonna House Publications, 2000. ({{ISBN|0-921440-25-1}})&lt;/ref&gt; It reads:

{{quote|Arise — go! Sell all you possess. Give it directly, personally to the poor. Take up My cross (their cross) and follow Me, going to the poor, being poor, being one with them, one with Me.

Little — be always little! Be simple, poor, childlike.

Preach the Gospel with your life — ''without compromise!'' Listen to the Spirit. He will lead you..

Do little things exceedingly well for love of Me.

Love... love... love, never counting the cost

Go into the marketplace and stay with Me. Pray, fast. Pray always, fast.

Be hidden. Be a light to your neighbour's feet. Go without fear into the depth of men's hearts. I shall be with you. Pray always.

''I will be your rest.''}}

The spirituality expressed in The Little Mandate is also known as "the [[Madonna House Apostolate|Madonna House]] way of life".

===Duty of the moment===
A central theme in Doherty's spirituality is "the duty of the moment". As she herself put it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The duty of the moment is what you should be doing at any given time, in whatever place God has put you. You may not have Christ in a homeless person at your door, but you may have a little child. If you have a child, your duty of the moment may be to change a dirty diaper. So you do it. But you don't just change that diaper, you change it to the best of your ability, with great love for both God and that child.... There are all kinds of good Catholic things you can do, but whatever they are, you have to realize that there is always the duty of the moment to be done. And it must be done, because the duty of the moment is the duty of God.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, Catherine. "The Duty of the Moment." Chap. 12 in ''[http://www.madonnahouse.org/publications/doherty/dearparents.htm Dear Parents: A Gift of Love for Families]''. Combermere: Madonna House Publications, 1997; {{ISBN|0-921440-44-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Poustinia===
{{Main|Poustinia}}
Doherty is perhaps best known for having introduced the concept of [[poustinia]] to Roman Catholicism through her best-selling book ''Poustinia'', first published in 1975. A poustinia is a small sparsely furnished cabin or room where a person goes to [[Prayer in Christianity|pray]] and [[Fasting#Roman Catholicism|fast]] alone in the presence of [[God#Biblical definition of God|God]] for 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, Catherine. [http://www.madonnahouse.org/publications/doherty/poustinia.htm ''Poustinia: Encountering God in Silence, Solitude and Prayer'']. 3rd ed. Combermere: Madonna House Publications, 2000; {{ISBN|0-921440-54-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable awards==
* [[Cross of St. George]], for bravery on the Russian Front
* [[Order of St. Anna]], for continuing in the line of duty under attack
* ''[[Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice]]'', [[Papal Orders of Chivalry|Papal decoration]] medal, awarded by [[Pope John XXIII]] for "exceptional and outstanding work for the Church and for the Pope", 1960
* Member of the [[Order of Canada]], "for a lifetime of devoted services to the underprivileged of many nationalities, both in Canada and abroad", 1976. In July 2008, the [[Madonna House Apostolate]] returned Doherty's Order of Canada insignia to [[Rideau Hall]] as a symbolic gesture of protest over the induction of [[Henry Morgentaler]] into the order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.madonnahouse.org/restoration/2008/07/order_of_canada_medal_returned.html|title=Order of Canada medal returned by Madonna House|date=July 8, 2008|publisher=[[Restoration (newspaper)|Restoration]] web site|accessdate=July 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dame of the [[Venerable Order of Saint John|Order of Saint John of Jerusalem]]
* [[Jules Favre]] Foundation Award, [[Académie française]]
* Woman of the Year, World Union of Catholic Women's Organizations, Rome
* International [[Mark Twain]] Society
* Poverello Medal, [[Franciscan University of Steubenville]]

==Cause for canonization==
Doherty's cause for [[canonization]] as a saint was opened by [[Pope John Paul II]] in 2000, and she has been given the official title [[Servant of God]] — the first step on the way to being declared [[Venerable]], then [[beatification|Blessed]], and finally [[saint#Roman Catholicism|Saint]]. At the current stage in the process, a diocesan tribunal, as well as a historical commission, are examining Doherty's life and writings under the supervision of the bishop of the Diocese of [[Pembroke, Ontario|Pembroke]]. Her file in the [[Holy See|Vatican]] is titled (in English) ''"Pembroke: Cause of the Beatification and Canonization of Servant of God Catherine de Hueck Doherty, lay faithful and foundress of the Apostolate called 'Madonna House'"''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

'''''Catholic Family News''''' ({{ISSN|1084-5682}}) is a [[Catholic traditionalism|Traditionalist]] [[Catholic]] monthly publication, and was edited by traditionalist [[Catholic]] journalist [[John Vennari]], printed and published in the Western New York/Southern Ontario region. Catholic Family Ministries, which publishes the monthly Catholic Family News (CFN), was run by John Vennari.

''Catholic Family News'' has no official affiliation with the various traditionalist groups,{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} but is sympathetic regarding the [[Society of Saint Pius X]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} The SSPX publishing house, [[Angelus Press]], advertises in the newspaper. Frequently critical of the post-[[Vatican II]] liturgical changes in the Church, ''CFN'' recognizes the validity of properly-celebrated New Rite [[sacraments]], rejects the [[sedevacantist]] position, and promotes the proper collegial consecration of Russia, as requested by [[Our Lady of Fatima]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The paper also includes devotional materials, and articles on historic Roman Catholic teachings and persons. Inspirational articles have appeared on Sister [[Annella Zervas]], [[O.S.B.]],&lt;ref&gt;Brendan D.

{{History of the Bahamas}}
The '''Eleutheran Adventurers''' were a group of English [[Puritan]]s and religious [[Independent (religion)|Independents]] who left [[Bermuda]] to settle on the island of [[Eleuthera]] in the [[Bahamas]] in the late 1640s.  The small group of Puritan settlers, led by a man named [[William Sayle]], had been expelled from Bermuda for their failure to swear allegiance to the Crown, and were searching for a place in which they could freely practice their faith. This group represented the first concerted European effort to colonize [[the Bahamas]].

==Background==
The mid-17th century was a  period of constant religious &amp; political turmoil in [[England]] and in [[Europe]] which culminated in the [[English Civil War]], a series of conflicts, the first of which was fought between King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and Parliament, and led ultimately to the [[The Protectorate|Protectorship]] of the Puritan general, [[Oliver Cromwell]]. This conflict spread to Bermuda where a period of civil strife resulted in a victory for the supporters of the [[Cavalier|Loyalist]] party in the [[English Civil War]]. The struggle eventually led to the expulsion of  the colony's Puritans and independents to the Bahamas, which the English had laid claim to in 1629, but had not permanently settled. Earlier in 1644, the [[Bermuda|Bermudian]] Independent Puritans had sent an expedition to explore these new islands, but one vessel was lost and the other failed to find a suitable island.

==Establishment of the colony== 
Nevertheless, sometime between spring 1646 and autumn 1648, Sayle took some seventy people to settle in the Bahamas. They made landfall on the island called Cigateo, which they named [[Eleutheria]], from the Greek word for "freedom", although the name later became Eleuthera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eleuthera-map.com/eleuthera-island.htm|title=Eleuthera Island :: History Notes|author=|date=|work=eleuthera-map.com|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The island's original inhabitants, the [[Lucayan people|Lucayans]], had been decimated through the slaving activities of the Spanish and the numerous European diseases, especially [[smallpox]], that followed.

William Sayle and his assistant Captain Butler were the persons who began a voyage to The Bahamas in two different vessels. William Sayle's vessel was called the ''William''. During the voyage Captain Butler and William Sayle had an argument with each other about what religious freedom means. As a solution to this problem, Sayle left Captain Butler and went forward to reach the Bahamian Islands. The settlers ran into trouble before they even landed, when they encountered a storm and their ship ran aground onto rocks, later called the Devil's Backbone, north of [[Spanish Wells]]. The adventurers found their way ashore and took refuge in what was later called Preacher's Cave, where a religious service was held every year for the next 100 years on the anniversary in thankfulness for their survival. However, although the settlers had shelter, they had lost their provisions so they had no food. Sayle took eight men in a small boat and went to Virginia to help, where he got a ship and supplies and went to relieve the others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jabezcorner.com/Grand_Bahama/1647_articles.htm|title=Articles and Orders, Bahamas 1647|author=|date=|work=jabezcorner.com|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; More colonists expelled from Bermuda arrived in 1649 and also faced the predicament of inadequate supplies. This time it was the sympathetic [[Puritans of New England]] who rallied to their cause and collected £800 for all the supplies they needed, allowing the colony to survive. The Eleutheran people later showed their thankfulness by sending shiploads of the extremely valuable [[:wikt:Braziletto|Braziletto]] wood to Boston, with instructions to sell it and donate the proceeds to [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cast Your Bread|url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2010/05/cast-your-bread|accessdate=24 May 2016|work=[[Harvard Magazine]]|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another source of trouble for the colony was dissent within its ranks from the beginning. Before they had even landed, a Captain Butler made so many problems, by refusing to accept any authority, that Sayle and others were obliged to find another island. They named the new island they moved to 'Sayle Island', which was later renamed '[[New Providence]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = BHC Staff | date = January 6, 2017 | title = The Commonwealth of Bahamas History | location = London | publisher = The Bahamas High Commission (BHC) | page =  | url = http://www.bahamashclondon.net/uploads/Fact_Sheet_on_History.pdf | access-date = January 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colony was not an immediate success in economic terms. Its soil yielded little production and the settlers barely got by during their first years, being obliged to live by salvaging what they could from shipwrecks. Sayle, however, was a very resourceful man, and secured a number of supplies from the mainland colonies. Despite this the colony did not do much better in the following years and in the end only a few hardcore settlers from the original Eleutherans were left. Sayle himself went on to become [[List of colonial governors of South Carolina|Governor]] of [[South Carolina]], but continued to have a vested personal interest in Eleuthera. He used this influence to secure some trade for the island and so helped the community through its infancy. This episode is thought to be the historical source of [[Andrew Marvell]]'s poem "Bermudas," written in praise of the Puritan settlers of the New World, and one of the earliest statements of the so-called "[[American Dream]]". According to the ''[[Norton Anthology of English Literature]]'' (7th ed., p.&amp;nbsp;1686), "The poem was probably written after 1653, when Marvell took up residence in the house of [[John Oxenbridge]], who had twice visited the Bermudas."

==Articles of 1647==
The new colony was to be governed by the Articles and Orders of 1647, drawn up by William Sayle. The articles reflect the ambiguities of the [[English Civil War]] taking place at that time between Royalists and Parliamentarians. Therefore, while the preamble refers to the ''Raign of our Soveraign Lord Charles, by the Grace of God, King of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland; Defender of the Faith, &amp;c'', the articles themselves make clear that the new settlement was to be effectively independent, making no further mention of the Crown. On the contrary, the articles speak of the rules governing  the ''Members of the Republick'' and the ''Magistracie or officers of the Republicke''. The articles established freedom of religion and opinion, three hundred acres of land per settler, governance under a governor and twelve councillors chosen from a senate composed of the first 100 settlers, and humane treatment of any indigenous people still on the island. It has been noted that if Sayle's settlement had been successful, then he would have created in the Bahamas "the first democratic state in the New World", some 130 years before the American Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authors = Riley, Sandra  (foreword by Thelma B.

{{Gospel Jesus}}
The three '''evangelical counsels''' or '''counsels of perfection''' in [[Christianity]] are [[Sexual abstinence#Christianity|chastity]], [[Poverty#Voluntary poverty|poverty]] (or perfect [[Charity (practice)|charity]]), and [[Vow of obedience|obedience]].&lt;ref&gt;See  [[Canon Law|The Code of Canon Law]], canons 599–601&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]] stated in the [[Canonical gospels]],&lt;ref&gt;cf. {{bibleref|Matthew|19:10–12}}; {{bibleref|Matthew|19:16–22}} = {{bibleref|Mark|10:17–22}} = {{bibleref|Luke|18:18–23}}, see also [[Mark 10]] and [[Jesus and the rich young man]]&lt;/ref&gt; they are counsels for those who desire to become "perfect" (τελειος, cf. {{bibleref|Matthew|19:21}}, see also [http://cf.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G5046 Strong's G5046] and [[Imitatio dei]]). The Catholic Church interprets this to mean that they are not binding upon all and hence not necessary conditions to attain  [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]] ([[Heaven#In Christianity|heaven]]). Rather they are [[Supererogation|"acts of supererogation"]] that exceed the minimum stipulated in the [[Biblical law in Christianity|Commandments in the Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Gospels'', Robert J. Miller ed., notes for Mark 10:17–22, page 36: "To the [[613 mitzvot|traditional biblical commandments]] Jesus adds the mandates of personal sacrifice and becoming his follower."&lt;/ref&gt; Catholics that have made a ''public'' profession to order their life by the evangelical counsels, and confirmed this by a ''public'' [[Religious vows|religious vow]] before their competent church authority (the act of religious commitment called [[Profession (religious)|"profession"]]), are recognised as members of the [[consecrated life]].

== Consecrated life ==
{{Main|Consecrated life}}
There are early forms of [[religious vows]] in the [[Christian monasticism|Christian monastic]] traditions. The [[Rule of Saint Benedict]] (ch. 58.17) stipulates for its adherents what has come to be known as the "Benedictine vow", which to this day is made by the candidates joining Benedictine communities, promising "stability, conversion of manners and obedience". Religious vows in the form of the three evangelical counsels of chastity, poverty, and obedience were first made in the twelfth century by [[Francis of Assisi]] and his followers,  the first of the [[mendicant orders]]. These vows are made now by the members of all Roman Catholic [[religious institute]]s founded subsequently (cf. [[Code of Canon Law]], can. 573) and constitute the basis of their other regulations of their life and conduct.{{Reference needed|date=March 2018}}

Members of [[religious institute]]s confirm their intention to observe the evangelical counsels by making a "public" vow,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P1Z.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 607 §2] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104123324/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P1Z.HTM |date=November 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that is, a vow that the superior of the religious institute accepts in the name of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P4E.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1192 §1] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104124158/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P4E.HTM |date=November 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the consecrated life Christians are free to make a ''private vow'' to observe one or more of the evangelical counsels; but a "private" vow does not have the same binding and other effects in church law as a "public" vow and does not bestow the spiritual benefits that spiritual teachers such as [[Columba Marmion#Bl Columba Marmion|Dom Columba Marmion]] (cf. ''Christ the Ideal of the Monk'', ch. VI) attribute to the religious [[Profession (religious)#Religious profession|"profession"]].

[[Image:Henriette Browne Nuns.jpg|left|thumb|[[Henriette Browne]] "Nonnen im klösterlichen Arbeitsraum"]]

A young man in the Gospel asked what he should do to obtain eternal life, and Jesus told him to "keep the commandments", but when the young man pressed further, Christ told him: "If thou wilt be perfect, go sell what thou hast, and give to the poor".  (It is from this passage that the term "counsel of perfection" comes.)  Again in the Gospels, Jesus speaks of "[[eunuchs]] who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven", and added "He that can receive it, let him receive it".  [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] presses home the duty incumbent on all Christians of keeping free from all sins of the flesh, and of fulfilling the obligations of the married state, if they have taken those obligations upon themselves, but also gives his "counsel" in favor of the unmarried state and of perfect chastity ([[Celibacy]]), on the ground that it is thus more possible to serve God with an undivided allegiance.{{Reference needed|date=March 2018}}

Indeed, [[Legalism (theology)|the danger]] in the [[Early Church]], even in Apostolic times, was not that the "counsels" would be neglected or denied, but that they should be exalted into commands of universal obligation, "forbidding to marry" ({{bibleverse|1|Timothy|4:3|KJV}}), and imposing poverty as a duty on all.

[[Image:Ferdinand Georg Waldmüller 003.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ferdinand Georg Waldmüller]], ''Am Klostertor'']]
These counsels have been analyzed as a way to keep the world from distracting the soul, on the grounds that the principal good things of this world easily divide themselves into three classes.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} There are the riches which make life easy and pleasant, there are the pleasures of the flesh which appeal to the appetites, and, lastly, there are honors and positions of authority which delight the self-love of the individual. These three matters, in themselves often innocent and not forbidden to the devout Christian, may yet, even when no kind of sin is involved, hold back the soul from its true aim and vocation, and delay it from becoming entirely conformed to the will of God. It is, therefore, the object of the three counsels of perfection to free the soul from these hindrances.  The love of riches is opposed by the counsel of poverty, the pleasures of the flesh (even the lawful pleasures of holy matrimony) are excluded by the counsel of chastity, while the desire for worldly power and honor is met by the counsel of holy obedience. Abstinence from unlawful indulgence in any of these directions is expected of all Christians as a matter of precept. The further voluntary abstinence from what is in itself lawful is the subject of the counsels, and such abstinence is not in itself meritorious, but only becomes so when it is done for the sake of Christ, and in order to be more free to serve him.{{Reference needed|date=March 2018}}

The [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] article ends with the following summary:
{{cquote|To sum up: it is possible to be rich, and married, and held in honour by all men, and yet keep the Commandments and to enter heaven. Christ's advice is, if we would make sure of everlasting life and desire to conform ourselves perfectly to the Divine will, that we should sell our possessions and give the proceeds to others who are in need, that we should live a life of chastity for the Gospel's sake, and, finally, should not seek honours or commands, but place ourselves under obedience. These are the Evangelical Counsels, and the things which are counselled are not set forward so much as good in themselves, as in the light of means to an end and as the surest and quickest way of obtaining everlasting life.}}

==Criticisms of supererogatory interpretation of evangelical counsels ==
In a 1523 essay, [[Martin Luther]] criticized the Church for its doctrine that the evangelical counsels were [[supererogatory]], arguing that the two-tiered system was a [[Sophistry|sophistic]] corruption of the teaching of Christ, intended to accommodate the vices of the aristocracy:
&lt;blockquote&gt;You are perturbed over Christ's injunction in Matthew 5, "Do not resist evil, but make friends with your accuser; and if any one should take your coat, let him have your cloak as well." ... The sophists in the universities have also been perplexed by these texts. ... In order not to make heathen of the princes, they taught that Christ did not demand these things but merely offered them as advice or counsel to those who would be perfect. So Christ had to become a liar and be in error in order that the princes might come off with honor, for they could not exalt the princes without degrading Christ&amp;mdash;wretched blind sophists that they are. And their poisonous error has spread thus to the whole world until everyone regards these teachings of Christ not as precepts binding on all Christians alike but as mere counsels for the perfect.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Luther]], "Temporal Authority: To What Extent it Should Be Obeyed" (1523)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] argues that the interpretation of the evangelical counsels as supererogatory acquiesces in what he calls "cheap grace," lowering the standard of Christian teaching:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The difference between ourselves and the [[Jesus and the rich young man|rich young man]] is that he was not allowed to solace his regrets by saying: "Never mind what Jesus says, I can still hold on to my riches, but in a spirit of inner detachment. Despite my inadequacy I can take comfort in the thought that God has forgiven me my sins and can have fellowship with Christ in faith." But no, he went away sorrowful. Because he would not obey, he could not believe. In this the young man was quite honest. He went away from Jesus and indeed this honesty had more promise than any apparent communion with Jesus based on disobedience.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]], ''[[The Cost of Discipleship]]'' (1937), p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*All phenomena are without inherent existence
*[[Nirvana (Buddhism)|Nirvana]] is beyond description&lt;ref name="nutshell"/&gt;

*All contaminated things are suffering.
*All phenomena are empty and devoid of self.
*Nirvana is true peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dalai Lama |first1=Tenzin Gyatso |title=Mind in Comfort and Ease |date=2012 |publisher=Wisdom Publications |location=New York |isbn=9780861717101 |page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As suffering is not an inherent aspect of existence&lt;ref name="heart"/&gt; sometimes the second seal is omitted to make Three Dharma Seals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yun|first=Hsing|authorlink=Hsing Yun|title=The Core Teachings|publisher=Buddha's Light Publishing|year=2008|page=49|ISBN=9781932293326}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the second seal is taken to refer to existence contaminated by or influenced by the mental afflictions of ignorance, attachment, and anger and their conditioning actions (karma), this omission is not necessary.

'''Guru ka Tal''' is a historical Sikh pilgrimage place dedicated to the memory of ninth Guru [[Sri Guru Tegh Bahudar Ji]]. Guru ka Taal is near [[Sikandra, Agra|Sikandra]] in [[Agra]]. The [[Gurudwara]] was built over the place where the Guru Tegh Bahadur offered voluntary arrest to [[Aurangazeb]], the Mughal Emperor. Several devotees gather every year to pay homage to the great Sikh guru ( who was marytyred along with his followers for sake of freedom to practice one's faith) in this Gurudwara.

==History==
This historic structure dates back to the 17th century. Earlier it was a Taal (reservoir) in the area near [[Sikandra, Agra|Sikandra]]. It was built in 1610 AD to collect and conserve rainwater in [[Agra]] during [[Jehangir]] reign. The water of the reservoir was used for irrigation purposes during the dry season. The reservoir was ornamented with stone carvings. This is said to be the place where the Guru Tegh Bahadur laid down his arms to offer arrest to [[Aurangazeb]]. The Gurudwara called Guru Ka Taal was built in the 1970s due to the contributions and arduous efforts of Sant Baba Sadhu Singhji  "Mauni".

==Architecture==
There were twelve towers in the Tal, but only eight towers have survived the test of time and have now been retrieved. This red stone structure bears similarity to many other magnificent structures of the Mughals like the [[Agra Fort]], [[Fatehpur Sikri]] etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7366">'''Gurung Shamanism''' is one of the oldest religions in Nepal. It describes the traditional [[shamanism|shamanistic]] religion of the [[Gurung people]] of [[Nepal]].&lt;ref name=Mumford&gt;{{cite book|title=Himalayan Dialogue: Bonpo Lama and Gurung Shamans in Nepal |author=Mumford, Stanley Royal |pages=6–10, 30–32, 182–194 |year=1989 |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |location=Madison, Wisconsin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deprecated terms==
Gurung shamanism has been often cited in scholarly texts as well as Hindu world of thought as ''Gurung dharma'', but the latter term is considered inaccurate as it is not considered a form of [[dharma]] by its adherents, but rather an ancient shamanistic belief system.

==Description==
Gurung villages have their own local deities.&lt;ref name=Mumford/&gt; Gurung shamanism ascribes fundamental symbolic significance to [[death]]. The rites, called ''pae'' (also ''pai'' and ''pe''), are often shamanistic analogs or compliments to Tibetan Buddhist rituals.&lt;ref name=Fisher&gt;{{cite book|title=Himalayan anthropology: the Indo-Tibetan interface |pages=171–172 |series=World anthropology |first=James F. |last=Fisher |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |year=1978 |isbn=90-279-7700-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The funerary rite is the central ceremony, entailing three days and two nights of rituals to send souls to the Land of the Ancestors. These rituals may be officiated by either Klehpri, Pachyu, or Bonpo Lamas (pre-Buddhist lamas). Among the Gurung, death involves the dissolution of bodily elements – earth, air, fire, and water. These elements are released in a series of rituals, nine for men and seven for women. One ritual in the freeing of souls involves a "Klehpri" injecting the spirit of the deceased through a string into a bird, which then appears to recognize family members and otherwise act unnaturally. The bird is symbolically sacrificed with the plucking of a few feathers, received by family members, after which the bird is released.&lt;ref name=Mumford/&gt; Once in the Land of the Ancestors, life continues much as in this world, however the spirit is able to take other [[reincarnation|incarnations]].&lt;ref name=Fuehrer/&gt; From the Land of the Ancestors, spirits continue to take an interest in their surviving kinsmen, able to work good and evil in the realm of the living.&lt;ref name=Fuehrer/&gt;

According to Gurung shamanism, the dead are either [[cremation|cremated]] or [[burial|buried]]. After the cremation or burial, the family of the deceased constructs a small [[shrine]] on a hill to offer food to the spirit, which remains and may cause misfortune. Sons of the deceased observe mourning for six to twelve months, during which they [[fasting|fast]] from meat and alcohol. A final funerary ceremony takes places a year or more after death, for which an expensive funeral rite is performed. This rite includes an [[effigy]] (called a ''pla'') of the deceased, draped in white cloth and decorated with ornaments. The death rituals close as ''klehpri'' addresses the spirit and sends it to its resting place, after which the hilltop shrine is dismantled.&lt;ref name=Fuehrer/&gt; Further rites ensue, during which the priest recites supplications to the "spirits of the four directions" for kind treatment as the deceased makes his way to the spirit realm, advises the departing soul on its choice between reincarnation and remaining in the Land of Ancestors, and admonishes it to stay away from its worldly cares and not to return prematurely.&lt;ref name=Mumford/&gt;

===Priesthood===
Gurungs employ three categories of priesthood – Ghyapri, Pachyu and Bon Lama – each following different practices&lt;ref name=Fuehrer&gt;{{cite book|title=Tribal populations and cultures of the Indian subcontinent |volume=2 |issue=7 |author=Christoph von Fürer-Haimendorf |pages=137–8 |publisher=[[Brill Publishers]] |year=1985 |isbn=90-04-07120-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aRSOnRfPAq0C&amp;pg=PA137 |accessdate=2011-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''ghyabri'' are involved with funerary rituals and play drums and large brass cymbals. The ''ghyabri'' have no sacred literature, learning all prayers and rituals by heart over several years. These sacred oral scriptures are called ''Pye tan Lu tan''. The sacred language, Gurung-kura, is no longer understood by laity nor practitioners, and may be derived from an ancient religion.&lt;ref name=Fuehrer/&gt;&lt;ref name=SOAS/&gt;&lt;ref name=AO&gt;{{cite book|title=Archiv orientální |volume=36 |publisher=Orientální ústav (Československá akademie věd) |year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shamans called ''pachyu'' operate in Gurung communities and in tribal and Hindu communities of Nepal, being most numerous in the Modi Valley. Their practice is largely in the realm of interpreting the supernatural.&lt;ref name=AO/&gt; While their ritual language is also archaic, it is more readily understood by practitioners and laity. Practices of ''pachyu'' have been influenced by Buddhist teaching, and they are often associated in various rites with lamas. They are also believed to communicate with spirits and local deities and are often employed by persons suffering illnesses or misfortunes to draw up horoscopes.&lt;ref name=Fuehrer/&gt;&lt;ref name=SOAS&gt;{{cite journal|title=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies |volume=30 |publisher=[[University of London]], School of Oriental and African Studies |page=720 |year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AO/&gt;

Both ''pachyu'' and ''ghyabri/klehpri'' are called upon to [[exorcism|exorcise]] possessed people, perform mortuary rites, and officiate ancestor worship.&lt;ref name=Fuehrer/&gt;

===Influence of Buddhism===
Centuries of cultural influence from Tibet resulted in many Gurungs gradually embracing [[Tibetan Buddhism]] over the centuries, especially the [[Nyingma]] school, and particularly among Gurungs in the [[Manang]] region.&lt;ref name=McHugh&gt;{{cite book|title=Love and Honor in the Himalayas: coming to know another culture |author=McHugh, Ernestine |page=32 |year=2001 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |location=[[Philadelphia]] |isbn=0-8122-1759-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gurungs generally believe in Buddha and bodhisattvas.  Mainstream Tibetan Buddhist lamas harbor ambivalent opinions about Gurung Dharma (Pye Ta Lu Ta) practices, and [[syncretism|syncretic]] Gurung Dharma may be reluctant to disclose their practices to outsiders.&lt;ref name=Mumford/&gt;

According to the 2001 Nepal Census, 69.03% of the ethnic Gurung identified as [[Buddhists]], 28.75% as [[Hindus]], and 0.66% as [[Christians]].&lt;ref name=CBS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbs.gov.np/Population/Monograph/Chapter%2003%20%20Social%20Composition%20of%20the%20Population.pdf |title=Chapter 3.

'''Hemant Mehta''' (born February 25, 1983) is an American [[author]], [[blog]]ger, and [[atheist]] activist who gained fame for "[[Faust|selling his soul"]] on [[eBay]].&lt;ref name="Beliefnet Sep 2007" /&gt; Mehta is a regular speaker at atheist events and has sat on the boards of charitable organizations such as the [[Secular Student Alliance]] and the Foundation Beyond Belief. He also runs a blog on [[Patheos]], Friendly Atheist, in which he and his associates publish articles several times a day.

==Biography==
Hemant Mehta was born in [[Chicago, Illinois]] in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freethought of the Day|url=https://ffrf.org/news/day/25/02/freethought/#hemant-mehta|publisher=Freedom From Religion Foundation|accessdate=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He graduated from the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] in 2004 with a double degree in math and biology and began teaching in 2007. He acquired a [[master's degree]] in math education from [[DePaul University]] in 2010 and a national board certification in teaching in 2012. He taught high school math at [[Neuqua Valley High School]]&lt;ref name="Freethought Today"&gt;{{cite news|title=Making Math and Atheism Friendly|newspaper=Freethought Today, Vol. 30 No. 1|date=January–February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IL teachers"&gt;{{cite web|title=Find the Data|url=http://illinois-teachers.findthedata.org/l/74349/Hemant-Mehta|work=Find the Data|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; until 2014 when he announced on Facebook and his blog that he had submitted his resignation to the school, citing that "As much as I love being in the classroom, the opportunities online are just a lot greater right now, and I don’t want to have any regrets down the road about not taking this chance while I have it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2014/07/26/i-made-a-big-life-decision-the-other-day/|title = I Made a Big Life Decision the Other Day|date = July 26, 2014|accessdate = 2014-07-27|website = The Friendly Atheist|publisher = Patheos|last = Mehta|first = Hemant}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his resignation, he stayed on as the head coach of the school's speech team.&lt;ref name="gerbic_interview"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.centerforinquiry.net/blogs/entry/interview_with_hemant_mehta_the_friendly_atheist/|title=Interview with Hemant Mehta, the Friendly Atheist: Guest Post by Susan Gerbic|last=Gerbic|first=Susan|authorlink=Susan Gerbic|date=March 24, 2017|website=Center for Inquiry|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mehta was raised in the [[Jainism|Jain]] faith, which purportedly led to his current [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]] diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.patreon.com/Hemant|title = Hemant|accessdate = 2014-08-19|website = Patreon|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://goodmenproject.com/ethics-values/hemant-mehta-jrmk/|title=Good Man and Friendly Atheist Hemant Mehta Opens Up the Conversation More of Us are Having|first=Jeremy|last=McKeen|publisher=Good Men Project|date=2016-01-24|accessdate=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became an atheist as a teenager. Seeking to learn more about what motivated many Americans to be religious, he decided to attend and take notes at a number of churches across the United States. He based his choice of churches to attend on the results of an eBay auction in which he offered his bidders, ”I am an atheist. You can bid on where I go to church or a temple or a mosque, etc." Mehta's experiences at the churches became the basis for his book, ''[[I Sold My Soul on eBay]]''.&lt;ref name="Beliefnet Sep 2007"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sheahen|first=Laura|title=I Sold My Soul on Ebay&amp;nbsp;— Interview with Atheist Hemant Mehta|url=http://www.beliefnet.com/Faiths/2007/09/I-Sold-My-Soul-On-Ebay-Interview-With-Atheist-Hemant-Mehta.aspx|accessdate=14 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the father of two children.

==Activism==
Hemant Mehta established a [[secular]] student group, Students WithOut Religious Dogma (SWORD),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Author Profile: Hemant Mehta|url=https://www.amazon.com/Hemant-Mehta/e/B001JRXMSU|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[University of Illinois]] at [[Chicago]] while earning dual degrees there. Later, still in college, he served as [[chairman|board chair]] for the [[Secular Student Alliance]].&lt;ref name="Secular Student Alliance bio"&gt;{{citation | title=Hemant Mehta | url=http://www.secularstudents.org/speakers/HemantMehta | publisher=Secular Student Alliance | work=Speakers list | format= Bio | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He interned at the [[Center for Inquiry]] where he became familiar with a lot of the national organizations and leaders in the activist world at that time.&lt;ref name="gerbic_interview" /&gt; Now, he serves on the [[board of directors]] for the Foundation Beyond Belief, a [[non-profit]] charitable organization.&lt;ref name="FBB bio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet the Board|url=http://foundationbeyondbelief.org/board|work=Foundation Beyond Belief|accessdate=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Hemant Mehta at Skepticon 7.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Hemant Mehta at [[Skepticon]] in 2014]]
Mehta is a regular speaker at [[freethought]] and [[scientific skepticism|skeptical]] events around the U.S.&lt;ref name="Secular Student Alliance Speakers"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.secularstudents.org/speakers/HemantMehta | title=Secular Student Alliance Speakers | publisher=Secular Student Alliance | accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attempts to build bridges of understanding between believers and non-believers through his blog, ''The Friendly Atheist''.&lt;ref name="Friendly Atheist"&gt;{{citation | title=About Hemant Mehta | url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/author/hemant-mehta/ | publisher=Patheos | accessdate=2014-01-20 | work=Friendly Atheist Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due in part to his positive message, he is also invited to speak at atheist events such as the one he presented at The [[Reason Rally]] or  at the [[American Atheists]] Annual Convention in March 2012.&lt;ref name="Reason Rally Video"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44EDzGjIQwc | title=Reason Rally Hemant Mehta | publisher=YouTube | date=29 March 2012 | accessdate=7 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official Schedule|url=http://reasonrally.org/official-schedule/|publisher=ReasonRally.org|accessdate=12 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617121719/http://reasonrally.org/official-schedule/|archivedate=17 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 National Convention of the American Atheists in Washington, DC.|url=http://atheists.org/convention2013/speakers|publisher=American Atheists|accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A vocal advocate of building an atheist community, Mehta's activism includes fundraising for charitable causes. He helped establish and serves on the board of the [[Foundation Beyond Belief]], which has raised more than $2,400,000 since it launched in 2010.&lt;ref name="FBB website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet the Board|url=http://foundationbeyondbelief.org/board|publisher=Foundation Beyond Belief|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also established a church cleanup fund in response to reports of church vandalism in [[Bend, Oregon]], in 2012. The vandals tagged the church with allusions to the [[Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster]], and Mehta's readers contributed nearly $3,000 in one day to help clean up the damage.&lt;ref name=KTVZ&gt;{{cite web|title=Atheists Raise Funds For Vandalized Bend Churches|url=http://www.ktvz.com/news/Atheists-Raise-Funds-For-Vandalized-Bend-Churches/-/413192/619858/-/bw7vgaz/-/index.html|publisher=KTVZ.com|accessdate=5 February 2014|author=Alicia Inns|date=June 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mehta writes for the "On Faith" column in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' and has been featured in a ''[[New York Times]]'' debate on prayer.&lt;ref name="On Faith"&gt;{{cite web|last=Quinn|first=Sally|title=On Faith|url=http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/panelists/Hemant_Mehta/|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;{{cite web|title=A Useless Habit, With a Dark Side|url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2013/06/27/should-atheists-pray/prayer-is-useless-and-has-a-downside|work=New York Times|accessdate=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked about his beliefs his response is clear: "Simply put, I have never seen any evidence of 'God's work' in action. I've seen what people think is God's work, but which actually has perfectly natural explanations. I believe that most people are good, even when nobody's looking. I believe our best path to discovering the truth lies in science, not religion."&lt;ref name="DFW COR"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hemant Mehta|url=http://diversity.dfwcor.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=15:hemant-mehta&amp;catid=1:profiles&amp;Itemid=12|work=DFWCOR Diversity Council|publisher=Coalition of Reason|accessdate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hemant Mehta continues to challenge religious believers with straight talk in a non-confrontational fashion. In June 2013 he wrote for the "Room for Debate" series in the ''New York Times'', where he argued that "There’s a very real downside to praying. It lulls believers into a false sense of accomplishment."&lt;ref name=NYTimes /&gt; In July 2013 he held an open discussion at the [[Max Lucado|Oak Hills Church]] in [[San Antonio, Texas]], where he explained his frustration at being confronted time and again with the same arguments for believing in God. He also commented that "Many Christians had [[negative stereotype]]s about atheists that prevented fruitful conversation."&lt;ref name=Rawstory.com&gt;{{cite web|last=Dolan|first=Eric W.|title=‘Friendly Atheist’ informs megachurch: We’ve heard all of it before|url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/07/08/friendly-atheist-informs-megachurch-weve-heard-all-of-it-before/|work=Rawstory.com|publisher=The Raw Story|accessdate=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mehta was a guest on [[CNN]] on August 20, 2013 to discuss the rise of atheism among the [[millennial generation]].&lt;ref name="Raw Story"&gt;{{cite web|last=Chidi|first=George|title=Hemant Mehta on rising atheism among millennials: ‘It’s not that Christianity is unpopular, it’s that it’s untrue.’|url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/08/18/hemant-mehta-on-rising-atheism-among-millenials-its-not-that-christianity-is-unpopular-its-that-its-untrue/|publisher=Raw Story|accessdate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2013 he began publishing "The Atheist Voice" series of video discussions on [[YouTube]], which had over 190,000 subscribers in October 2017.&lt;ref name="The Atheist Voice"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mehta|first=Hemant|title=The Atheist Voice|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/TheAtheistVoice|work=The Atheist Voice|publisher=Youtube.com|accessdate=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2006, Hemant Mehta posted an auction on [[eBay]] where he explained his background in atheism and offered to go to the worship services of the winning bidder's choosing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Mehta's original eBay auction (via Internet Archive Wayback Machine | url=http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=5660982226 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20060818010042/http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=5660982226 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2006-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The auction ended on February 3, 2006 with a final bid of $504 from Jim Henderson, a minister from [[Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]].  Mehta later donated that money to the Secular Student Alliance, a non-profit organization for which he served as chair of the [[board of directors]].&lt;ref name="wsj"&gt;{{cite web | title=Wall Street Journal article, reprinted on Off-the-map.org | url=http://www.off-the-map.org/idealab/articles/wsj_ebay_atheist.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly a month after the auction, an article about Mehta's experiences appeared on the front page of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'',&lt;ref name="wsj"/&gt; leading to a flurry of media coverage.  He was featured in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', the ''[[Seattle Times]]'', and the ''[[Village Voice]]'', and on [[National Public Radio]].&lt;ref name="waterbrook"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://waterbrookmultnomah.com/author-spotlight.php?authorid=73956 | title=Author Spotlight: Hemant Mehta | publisher=WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group | accessdate=23 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henderson asked Mehta to visit a variety of churches and write about the experiences on Henderson's website, offthemap.com.  Mehta eventually wrote about his visits at nine different churches as well as two additional pieces dealing with atheist conventions and Christian media. ''[[I Sold My Soul on eBay]]'' contains Mehta's observations and critiques of the churches along with background on how he became an atheist.&lt;ref name="[[I Sold My Soul on eBay]]"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mehta|first=Hemant|title=I Sold My Soul on eBay|year=2007|publisher=WaterBrook Publishing|isbn=1400073472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other published works include ''The Young Atheist's Survival Guide'' published in 2012 and ''The Friendly Atheist: Thoughts on the Role of Religion in Politics and Media'' published in 2013. The former is aimed at students, teachers, and parents who may face ostracism due to their lack of religious belief. The latter is intended as a study guide for the many things written by Mehta.&lt;ref name="Friendy Atheist Books"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mehta|first=Hemant|title=The Friendly Atheist: Books|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/publications/|publisher=Pantheos Press|accessdate=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, Mehta announced his latest project, ''He is an Abusive Boyfriend (and you should break up)'', based on his YouTube series, The Atheist Voice. However, Mehta cancelled the project after receiving negative feedback from his readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2014/08/07/canceling-the-kickstarter-project/|title = Cancelling the Kickstarter Project|date = August 7, 2014|accessdate = 2014-08-08|website = The Friendly Atheist|publisher = Patheos|last = Mehta|first = Hemant}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hinduism in South India''' refers to the [[Hindu culture]] of the people of [[South India]]. The Hinduism in South India is characterized by [[Dravidian peoples|Dravidian]] customs and traditions. The Dravidians made great contributions to development of Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eliot|first=Charles|title=Hinduism and Buddhism, Vol I. (of 3)|year=2007|publisher=Echo Library|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; South India was the birthplace of many Hindu saints and reformers. The [[Brahmin]]s (Hindu priests class) of ancient South India ([[Tamilakam]], [[Telengana]], [[Karnataka]]) were classified as [[Pancha-Dravida]] (The Five Dravidians).&lt;ref&gt;Nārada Maha Thera, ''The Buddha-Dhamma Or the Life and Teachings of the Buddha'', p.8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James G. Lochtefeld, ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M'', p.205&lt;/ref&gt; The Hindus in South India are followers of various Hindu branches such as [[Shaivism]], [[Vaishnavism]], [[Shaktism]], [[Brahmanism]] and others. Hinduism was the state religion of most of the South Indian kingdoms. During the Ancient and Middle Ages were built in South India one of the greatest Hindu temples. South Indian kings such as the [[Cholas]] spread Hinduism overseas to parts of [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;Dorling Kindersley, ''India: People, Place, Culture, History'', p.85&lt;/ref&gt; The activities of South India across the [[Palk Strait]] led to survival of [[Hinduism]] in [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundaytimes.lk/events/611-lecture-on-hindu-sculpture-and-architecture-of-sri-lanka Lecture on Hindu sculpture and architecture of Sri Lanka] Sunday Times - September 29, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sri Lankan Tamil people|Tamil]] Hindus in Sri Lanka are followers of [[Shaiva Siddhanta|Tamil Shaiva Siddhanta]], which is mainly practiced in parts of South India. Some Hindu festivals are celebrated mostly or exclusively in South India and Sri Lanka. In South India are also numerous Hindu pilgrimage site that is visited annually by thousands of devotees. The [[Tirumala Venkateswara Temple]] in [[Andhra Pradesh]] is considered to be the most-visited holy place in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2003/09/30/stories/2003093003080300.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Ghazal programme at Tirumala temple | date=30 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cauvery river]] that flows through [[Karnataka]] and [[Tamil Nadu]] is also known as the "[[Ganges]] of South" and is one of the most sacred river of the Hindus.&lt;ref&gt;Sunita Pant Bansal, ''Hindu Pilgrimage'', p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hinduism in Ancient South India==

The '''Vedic culture in South India''' has been in some respects the best preserved of ancient [[Vedic period|Vedic culture]] and traditions. In North India during late ancient and medieval periods, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam flourished alongside the Hindu majority. Every intermixing influenced North Indian culture, in particular Islam. The influence of Islam, specifically Sufism, and Sikhism are widespread in the modern-day North Indian society, clearly palpable in linguistics, music, attire, etc. Much of this influence can be attributed to close to a millennium of Muslim rule across North India. Unlike in the North, South India had less outside influence until the advent of European imperialists. As such the original Hindu traditions are relatively better preserved in South India than in North India.

Tamil literature and Tamil epics and classics have many references to Vedic gods and culture. The [[Tolkaappiyam]], 1st century BCE grammar book, mentions non-Vedic, early-Vedic ([[Indra]], [[Varuna]]) and Puranic ([[Vishnu]]) gods. The Paripadal (8; 3; 9 etc.), one of the "Eight Anthologies" of poetry (or ettuttokai), has homages to [[Vishnu]], [[Lakshmi]], [[Brahma]], the twelve [[Aditya]]s, the [[Ashvins]], the [[Rudra]]s, the [[Saptarishi]]s, [[Indra]], the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Deva]]s etc. The [[Kural]], written by [[Tiruvalluvar]], mentions gods like [[Indra]] (25) and [[Lakshmi]] (e.g. 167).

The Sangam Tamil epic [[Silappathikaram]], begins with invocations to [[Chandra]], [[Surya]], and [[Indra]], and has homages to [[Agni]], [[Varuna]], [[Shiva]], Subrahmanya, Vishnu-Krishna, Uma, etc. The epic states that “Vedic sacrifices [are] being faultlessly performed” and has many references to Vedic culture and Vedic texts. In the Buddhist work [[Manimekhalai]], the submersion of the city Puhar in [[Kumari Kandam]] is attributed to the neglect of the worship to [[Indra]].

==Vedic legends==

According to the [[Purana]]s, the Dravidians are descendants of the Vedic [[Turvasha]] people. According to the [[Matsya Purana]], [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]] is considered as a [[south Indian]] king.&lt;ref&gt;also e.g. Bhagavata Purana (VIII.24.13)&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Hindu]] tradition the creation of the [[Tamil language]] is credited to the [[Rig Veda|Rig Vedic]] sage Rishi [[Agastya]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://micheldanino.voiceofdharma.com/tamilculture.html Michel Danino - Vedic Roots of Early Tamil Culture&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130817135028/http://micheldanino.voiceofdharma.com/tamilculture.html |date=2013-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Jew]]ish presence in [[Taiwan]]''' began in the mid-20th century and was never numerous. The first sizable presence began in the 1950s, when religious services were held in the [[Military of the United States|United States military]] [[chapel]], to which civilians also had access.

In 1975, [[Rabbi]] [[Ephraim Einhorn|Ephraim Ferdinand Einhorn]] ({{lang-he|אפרים פרדיננד איינהורן}}; {{zh|c=艾恩宏|p=Ài Ēnhóng}}) arrived to serve as the island's sole rabbi.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the Taiwanese Jewish community has been largely made up of foreign business executives and their families, with services also frequently attended by visitors to the island. For many years Rabbi Einhorn officiated at Sabbath and holiday services at the Landis Hotel and later the Sheraton Taipei. In 2015 the venue for the services moved to space in an office building provided by one of the community members. Attendance peaks around the [[High Holidays|High Holy Days]], numbering between 60 and 100.&lt;ref&gt;

Because the state of [[Israel]] has full diplomatic relations with mainland China, it cannot fully recognize the government of Taiwan, which China considers separatist. Nevertheless, Israel maintains the Israel Economic and Cultural Office in Taipei ([https://web.archive.org/web/20081011231709/http://www.iseco.org.tw/default_eng.htm ISECO]). In 2006, there was $1.3 billion worth of bilateral trade between Israel and Taiwan.

In 2002 a Holocaust Museum was opened in Bao'an, [[Rende District|Rende Township]], [[Tainan County]] (now part of [[Tainan City]]).&lt;ref&gt;

It was founded by Chou Chou An ({{zh|c=卓枝安}}; Pinyin: Zhuó Zhī'ān), a Taiwanese [[priest]] who follows [[Messianic Judaism]], considered by most Christians and Jews to be a form of Christianity. Chou Chou An received his religious education in [[Japan]]. The Kyoto Holocaust Museum has donated several [[artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]] to the Holocaust Museum in Tainan.

In the summer of 2011, upon the coming of the new [[Chabad]] emissaries, Rabbi Shlomi and Racheli Tabib, the Chabad Taiwan, also known as the Taipei Jewish Center, was founded.&lt;ref&gt;

== History ==
Prior to the 20th century, Korean society was [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucian]], and most Koreans were [[Nontheism|nontheists]], who were not concerned with the question of whether or not God existed. Following the [[division of Korea]] in the mid-20th century, approximately 88% of South Koreans said they had no religious affiliation in 1964. While religiousness in South Korea experienced a sharp rise in the 20th century, the majority of South Koreans (56%) had no religious affiliation as of 2015 national census.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Making Sense of the Secular: Critical Perspectives from Europe to Asia|last=Baker|first=Don|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=1136277218|editor-last=Ghosh|editor-first=Ranjan|location=|pages=182-193|chapter=Korea's Path of Secularisation|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0v7ipRmW6M0C&amp;pg=PA184&amp;dq=page182}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; According to a 2012 [[WIN/GIA|Gallup International]] poll, 15% of South Koreans said they were "convinced atheists," an increase from 11% in 2005.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to some experts, contemporary irreligion in South Korea can be partially attributed to South Koreans' distrust of [[Hierarchical organization|hierarchical organizations]] like religious groups. Experts also point to South Korea's demanding education and work systems as reasons why few young South Koreans participate in organized religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/05/south-korea-christians-election/525606/|title=The Rise of Café Churches in South Korea|last=Strother|first=Jason|date=2017-05-08|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-03-20|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/05/young-south-koreans-turning-religion-170524144746222.html|title=Why young South Koreans are turning away from religion|last=Borowiec|first=Steven|date=2017-05-28|website=Al Jazeera|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Josef Imbach''' (born 3 December 1945 in [[Zofingen]], [[Aargau]]) is a controversial [[Switzerland|Swiss]] Catholic theologian and [[Franciscan]] [[friar]].

He studied theology and philosophy at the Pontifical Theological Faculty of St. Bonaventure in Rome 1967-1973 and from 1975 to 2002 was a professor of [[fundamental theology]] there.

In 2002, he was suspended for a year by the Franciscan authorities for (according to him) denying the possibility of miracles. He denied holding this view &lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1141/is_17_38/ai_84092217/ findarticles.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923162305/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1141/is_17_38/ai_84092217/ |date=2009-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and publicly protested against the "non-transparent practices" and "unqualified opinion".

Imbach was later banned from teaching in all Catholic theological faculties worldwide by the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]]. He has been living near [[Basel]] since 2005 where he teaches Catholic theology at the Evangelical Theological Faculty.

[[Image:Kagamimochi gorgeous version.jpg|thumb|right|A traditionally ornamented Kagami mochi]]
{{nihongo|'''''Kagami mochi'''''|鏡餅|extra="mirror rice cake"}}, is a traditional [[Japanese New Year]] decoration. It usually consists of two&lt;ref name="mannerbijin"&gt;{{cite web|title=鏡餅|url=http://www.tamagoya.ne.jp/manner/057.htm|accessdate=3 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020613231203/http://www.tamagoya.ne.jp/manner/057.htm|dead-url=yes|archivedate=13 June 2002|language=Japanese|date=December 12, 2000}} {{ja}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gishi"&gt;[http://www.gishi.co.jp/home/faq_03.htm Kagami mochi FAQ] {{jp icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tokyogas"&gt;[https://archive.is/20070927133221/http://home.tokyo-gas.co.jp/shoku110/unchiku/240.htm  Question and answer on three layered kagami mochi] from Tokyo Gas {{jp icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kojien"&gt;[[Kōjien]] dictionary. Various Japanese dictionaries, including the [[Kōjien]], testify that the kagami mochi has two layers of mochi. Three or more layers is not mentioned.&lt;/ref&gt; round [[Mochi (food)|mochi]] (rice cakes), the smaller placed atop the larger, and a [[daidai]] (a Japanese [[citrus aurantium|bitter orange]]) with an attached leaf on top. In addition, it may have a sheet of [[konbu]] and a skewer of dried [[persimmon]]s under the mochi. It sits on a stand called a {{nihongo|''sanpō''|三宝|}} over a sheet called a {{nihongo|''shihōbeni''|四方紅|}}, which is supposed to ward off fires from the house for the following years.  Sheets of paper called {{nihongo|''gohei''|御幣|}} folded into lightning shapes similar to those seen on [[sumo]] wrestler's belts are also attached.

The ''kagami mochi'' first appeared in the [[Muromachi period]] (14th–16th century). The name ''kagami'' ("mirror") is said to have originated from its resemblance to an old-fashioned kind of round copper mirror, which also had a religious significance. The reason for it is not clear. Explanations include ''mochi'' being a food for special days,&lt;ref name="gishi"/&gt; the spirit of the rice plant being found in the mochi,&lt;ref name="mannerbijin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gishi"/&gt; and the mochi being a food which gives strength.&lt;ref name="gishi"/&gt;

The two mochi discs are variously said to symbolize the going and coming years,&lt;ref name="gishi"/&gt; the human heart,&lt;ref name="gishi"/&gt; "yin" and "yang", or the moon and the sun.&lt;ref name="tokyogas"/&gt; The "daidai", whose name means "generations",&lt;ref name="kojien"/&gt; is said to symbolize the continuation of a family from generation to generation.&lt;ref name="mannerbijin"/&gt;

Traditionally the kagami mochi was placed in various locations throughout the house.&lt;ref name="tokyogas"/&gt; Nowadays it is usually placed in a household Shinto altar, or [[kamidana]].  It has also been placed in the [[tokonoma]], a small decorated alcove in the main room of the home.  

Contemporary kagami mochi are often pre-moulded into the shape of stacked discs and sold in plastic packages in the supermarket. A [[mikan]] or a plastic imitation daidai is often substituted for the original ''daidai''.

Variations in the shape of kagami mochi are also seen.&lt;ref name="tokyogas"/&gt; In some regions, three layered kagami mochi are also used. The three layered kagami mochi are placed on the [[butsudan]] or on the kamidana. There is also a variant decoration called an ''okudokazari'' placed in the centre of the kitchen or by the window which has three layers of mochi.&lt;ref name="tokyogas"/&gt;

It is traditionally broken and eaten in a [[Shinto]] ritual called ''[[kagami biraki]]'' (mirror opening) on the second Saturday or Sunday of January. This is an important ritual in Japanese [[martial arts]] [[dojo]]s. It was first adopted into Japanese martial arts when [[Kanō Jigorō]], the founder of [[judo]], adopted it in 1884, and since then the practice has spread to [[aikido]], [[karate]] and [[jujutsu]] studios.

"'''Lamborghini Angels'''" is a song performed by [[rapper]] [[Lupe Fiasco]]. It was released on August 14, 2012 as the third single from his forthcoming album ''[[Food &amp; Liquor II: The Great American Rap Album Pt. 1]]''. The song contains lyrics that may offend people because of its religious content.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rap-up.com/2012/08/07/lupe-fiasco-warns-listeners-about-new-single-lamborghini-angels/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music video==
On June 11, 2013, Lupe Fiasco tweeted "Lamborghini Angels, ITAL, &amp; Audubon Ballroom. 3 Videos. 1 Day. Coming Soon. #FL2". The video was released on July 4, 2013, entitled "#1234". In the video, Lupe tackles social, political, and racial issues. Children are seen watching television as images of guns, drugs, and fast food flash across the screen. The video is almost 13 minutes in length.

In one scene, a conservative, executive, grandmother, priest, and KKK member sit down at a conference table to meet, but it quickly turns ugly. And in the shocking conclusion, Lupe pulls up a white hood to reveal himself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rap-up.com/2013/07/04/video-lupe-fiasco-lamborghini-angels-ital-roses-audubon-ballroom-1234/ RapUp.Com]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7183">The '''Levitical cities''' were 48 cities in ancient [[Ancient Israel|Israel]] set aside for the [[tribe of Levi]], who were not allocated their own territorial land when the [[Israelites]] entered the [[Promised Land]].

[[File:Cities of refuge.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Cities of Refuge (illustration from a Bible card published 1901 by the Providence Lithograph Company)]][[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 35:1-8 relates God's command to [[Moses]] to establish 48 cities for the Levites, of which six would also function as [[Cities of Refuge|cities of refuge]] to which a [[manslayer]] could flee. Each settlement was to comprise a walled city and the common land around it for pasture, measured radially as one thousand [[cubit]]s in each direction,&lt;ref&gt;Numbers 35:4&lt;/ref&gt; or as a square measuring two thousand cubits along each side.&lt;ref&gt;Numbers 35:5&lt;/ref&gt; The land for the cities was to be 'donated' by the host tribe &lt;ref&gt;Numbers 35:2&lt;/ref&gt; and was allocated to the Levites according to their tribal sub-divisions.

[[13 Kohanic cities|13 cities]] were for the [[Kohen|Aaronite]] priestly division.&lt;br /&gt;
13 cities were for the [[Gershonite]] division.&lt;br /&gt;
10 cities were for the [[Kohathite]] division.&lt;br /&gt;
12 cities were for the [[Merarite]] division.

The six cities which were to be Cities of Refuge were [[Golan]], [[Ramoth-Gilead|Ramoth]], and [[Bezer]], on the [[Transjordan (Bible)|east]] of the [[Jordan River]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] 4:43 and [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] 20:8&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kedesh]], [[Shechem]], and [[Hebron]] on the western side.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua 20:7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locations of Cities==
[[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] 21 recounts the fulfilment of God's command at the request of the Levite leaders. A further list is provided in [[1 Chronicles]] 6:54-81. The following table reflects the list in Joshua 21:

==Interpretation==
[[John Calvin]] suggested that the Levites had initially been 'overlooked' in the allocation of land on entry to the Promised Land, until the Levites brought forward a reminder of the divine commandment, making this an example of how:
:... it is apt to happen, every one being so attentive in looking after his own affairs that even brethren are forgotten. It was certainly disgraceful to the people that they required to be pulled by the ear, and put in mind of what the Lord had clearly ordered respecting the Levites.&lt;ref&gt;Calvin's Commentary on the Bible, Joshua 21:1 http://www.studylight.org/commentaries/cal/view.cgi?bk=5&amp;ch=21 accessed 29 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the writer of the [[Pulpit Commentary]] disagreed:

:'We are not to suppose, with Calvin, that the Levites had been overlooked. Such a supposition is little in keeping with the devout spirit of him who now directed the affairs of the Israelites, who had been minister to Moses the Levite, and had but lately been concerned with [[Eleazar]], the high priest, in making a public recognition of that God to whose service the Levites had been specially set apart. The delay in appointing to the Levites their cities arose from the nature of the arrangement which had to be made for the Levitical cities.'&lt;ref&gt;Pulpit Commentary on Joshua 21 http://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/21.htm, accessed 3 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

This 'arrangement' was the fulfilment of [[Jacob]]'s prophecy in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 49:5-7 - ''I will scatter them ([[Simeon (Hebrew Bible)]] and [[Levi]]) in Israel'' - which was a punishment for Simeon and Levi's massacre of the men of [[Shechem]].&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 34:25&lt;/ref&gt; The Levites could not be scattered amongst the cities of the other tribes until the other tribes had all been appointed to their territories after the entry into the Promised Land (Joshua 18-19).

[[Matthew Henry]] commented that Jacob's condemnation of Levi became a blessing for Israel:

:'The sentence as it respects Levi was turned into a blessing. This tribe performed an acceptable service in their zeal against the worshippers of the [[golden calf]] ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 32:26). Being set apart to God as priests, they were in that character scattered through the nation of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;http://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/genesis/49.htm accessed 4 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Brigham Young]]''' was perhaps the most famous [[Polygamy#Mormon Polygamy|polygamist]] of the early [[Latter Day Saint movement]], marrying a total of 55 wives, 54 of them after becoming a Latter Day Saint.&lt;ref name = joj&gt;Jeffrey Odgen Johnson, [http://content.lib.utah.edu/u?/dialogue,17879 “Determining and Defining ‘Wife’ — The Brigham Young Households”], ''[[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought]]'', vol. 20, no. 3 (Fall 1987) pp. 57-70.&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that upon being taught about [[plural marriage]], "It was the first time in my life that I desired the grave."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/mormons/peopleevents/e_polygamy.html|title=Polygamy and the Church: A History|accessdate=2007-05-29|date=2007-04-30|work=The Mormons: People &amp; Events|publisher=WGBH Educational Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of his death, Young had 59 children by 16 of his wives; 46 of his children reached adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unicomm.byu.edu/about/brigham.aspx?content=brigham7|title=Brigham Young Biography|accessdate=2007-07-01|publisher=Brigham Young University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Number of wives==
Sources have varied on the number of Young's wives due to differences in what observers have considered to be a "wife".&lt;ref name = joj/&gt; There were 55 women that Young was [[Sealing (Latter Day Saints)|sealed]] to during his lifetime. While the majority of the sealings were [[Celestial marriage|"for eternity"]] (i.e., in the afterlife), some were "for time only" (until death). However, it is suspected that not all of the 55 marriages were [[Marriage#Rights and obligations|conjugal]],&lt;ref name = joj/&gt; and Young did not live with a number of his wives or publicly hold them out as wives, which has led to confusion on numbering.&lt;ref name = joj/&gt;  A book published in 1887 gives brief biographical sketches and photos of a total of 26 wives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Pictures and biographies of Brigham Young and his wives.Being a true and correct statement of the birth, life and death of President Brigham Young, second president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, and brief biographies of his twenty-six wives, and names and number of children born to them.|url = http://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.31175035163131|publisher = Salt Lake City,Utah,|first = James H.|last = Crockwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of his 55 wives, 21 had never been married before; 16 were widows; six were divorced; six had living husbands; and the marital status of six others are unknown.&lt;ref name = joj/&gt;

At the time of Young's death, 19 of his wives had predeceased him, he was divorced from ten, and 23 survived him, with the status of four unknown.&lt;ref name = joj/&gt; In his [[will (law)|will]], Young shared his estate with the 16 surviving wives who had lived with him; the six surviving non-conjugal wives were not mentioned in the will.&lt;ref name = joj/&gt;

==Lion House==
In 1856, Young built the [[Lion House (Salt Lake City, Utah)|Lion House]] to accommodate his sizable family. This building remains a Salt Lake City landmark, together with the [[Beehive House]], another Brigham Young family home. A contemporary of Young wrote: "It was amusing to walk by Brigham Young's big house, a long rambling building with innumerable doors. Each wife has an establishment of her own, consisting of parlor, bedroom, and a front door, the key of which she keeps in her pocket".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= DeHegermann-Lindencrone |first= Lillie |title=The Sunny Side of Diplomatic Life, 1875-1912 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/13955/13955-h/13955-h.htm |publisher=Project Gutenberg |accessdate=2006-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Sahl ibn Abī Ḥathma (d. in [[Mu'awiya]]'s reign, i.e., 41-60 [[Hijri year|AH]]), was a young [[Sahaba|companion]] of Muhammad. Parts of his writings on Maghazi are preserved in the ''Ansāb'' of [[al-Baladhuri]], the ''Ṭabaqāt'' of [[Ibn Sa'd]], and the works of [[Ibn Jarir al-Tabari]] and [[al-Waqidi]].&lt;ref name="Ahmad"&gt;{{Cite book| edition = 1st| publisher = King Saud University| author = M. R. Ahmad| title = Al-sīra al-nabawiyya fī ḍawʾ al-maṣādir al-aṣliyya: dirāsa taḥlīliyya| location = Riyadh| year = 1992 | pages=20–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Abdullah ibn Abbas]] (d. 78 AH), a [[companion of Muhammad]], his traditions are found in various works of [[Hadith]] and Sīra.&lt;ref name="Ahmad" /&gt;
* Saʿīd ibn Saʿd ibn ʿUbāda al-Khazrajī, another young companion, his writings have survived in the ''Musnad'' of [[Ibn Hanbal]] and Abī ʿIwāna, and al-Tabari's ''Tārīkh''.&lt;ref name="Ahmad" /&gt;
* [[ʿUrwa ibn al-Zubayr]] (d. 713). He wrote letters replying to inquiries of the [[Umayyad]] caliphs, [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] and [[al-Walid I]], involving questions about certain events that happened in the time of Muhammad. Since Abd al-Malik did not appreciate the maghāzī literature, these letters were not written in story form. He is not known to have written any books on the subject.&lt;ref name="EQ" /&gt;  He was a grandson of [[Abu Bakr]] and the younger brother of [[Abdullah ibn al-Zubayr]].
* Saʿīd ibn al-Masīb al-Makhzūmī (d. 94 AH), a famous [[Tābiʿī]] and one of the teachers of [[Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri]]. His traditions are quoted in the [[Six major hadith collections]], and in the Sīra works of [[Ibn Ishaq]], [[Fatḥ al-Din Ibn Sayyid al-Nās|Ibn Sayyid al-Nās]], and others.&lt;ref name="Ahmad" /&gt;
* Abū Fiḍāla ʿAbd Allāh ibn Kaʿb ibn Mālik al-Anṣārī (d. 97 AH), his traditions are mentioned by Ibn Ishaq and al-Tabari.&lt;ref name="Ahmad" /&gt;
* Abbān ibn Uthmān ibn Affān (d. 101-105 AH), the son of [[Uthman]]. His traditions are transmitted through [[Malik ibn Anas]] in his ''[[Muwatta Imam Malik|Muwaṭṭaʾ]]'', the ''Ṭabaqāt'' of Ibn Sa'd, and in the histories of al-Tabari and [[al-Yaʿqūbī]].&lt;ref name="Ahmad" /&gt;
* ʿĀmir ibn Sharāḥīl al-Shaʿbī (d. 103 AH), his traditions were transmitted through Abu Isḥāq al-Subaiʿī, Saʿīd ibn Masrūq al-Thawrī, al-Aʿmash, Qatāda, Mujālid ibn Saʿīd, and others.&lt;ref name="Ahmad" /&gt;

=== 8th and early 9th century (2nd century of Hijra) ===

* Al-Qāsim ibn Muḥammad ibn Abī Bakr (d. 107 AH), another grandson of [[Abu Bakr]]. His traditions are mainly found in the works of al-Tabari, al-Balathuri, and al-Waqidi.&lt;ref name="Ahmad" /&gt;
* [[Wahb ibn Munabbih]] (d. during 725 to 737, or 114 AH). Several books were ascribed to him but none of them are now extant. Some of his works survive as quotations found in works by [[Ibn Ishaq]], [[Ibn Hisham]], [[Ibn Jarir al-Tabari]], [[Abū Nuʿaym al-Iṣfahānī]], and others.&lt;ref name="Ahmad" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EQ" /&gt;
* [[Ibn Shihāb al-Zuhrī]] (d. c. 737), a central figure in sīra literature, who collected both ahadith and akhbār. His akhbār also contain chains of transmissions, or [[isnad]]. He was sponsored by the [[Umayyad]] court and asked to write two books, one on [[genealogy]] and another on maghāzī. The first was canceled and the one about maghāzī is either not extant or has never been written.&lt;ref name="EQ" /&gt;
* [[Musa ibn ʿUqba]], a student of [[Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri|al-Zuhrī]], wrote ''Kitāb al-Maghāzī'', a notebook used to teach his students; now lost. Some of his traditions have been preserved, although their attribution to him is disputed.&lt;ref name="EQ"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | publisher = Brill Academic Publishers|  pages = 29–49| last = Raven| first = Wim| title = Sīra and the Qurʾān | encyclopedia = [[Encyclopaedia of the Qurʾān]] | year = 2006 | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Muhammad ibn Ishaq]] (d. 767 or 761), another student of [[Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri|al-Zuhrī]], who collected oral traditions that formed the basis of an important biography of Muhammad. His work survived through that of his editors, most notably [[Ibn Hisham]] and [[Ibn Jarir al-Tabari]].&lt;ref name="EQ" /&gt;
* Abū Ishāq al-Fazarī (d. 186 AH) wrote Kitāb al-Siyar.&lt;ref&gt;Published from Lebanon, Beirut: Mu'assasa al-Risāla, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Madhvacharya''' ({{IAST|Madhvācārya}}; {{lang-kn|ಮಧ್ವಾಚಾರ್ಯ}}; {{IPA-sa|məd̪ʱʋɑːˈtʃɑːrjə}}; CE 1238–1317 {{sfn|Sharma|2000|p=103}}), sometimes [[Anglicisation|anglicised]] as '''Madhva Acharya''', and also known as '''Pūrna Prajña Tīrtha''' and '''Ānanda Tīrtha''', was a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] philosopher and the chief proponent of the ''[[Dvaita]]'' (dualism) school of [[Vedanta]].{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|p=xv}}{{Sfn|Stoker|2011}} Madhva called his philosophy ''[[Dvaita Vedanta|Tatvavāda]]'' meaning "arguments from a realist viewpoint".{{Sfn|Stoker|2011}}

Madhvacharya was born on the west coast of [[Karnataka]] state in 13th-century [[India]].{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|pp=xv-xvii}} As a teenager, he became a [[Sannyasa|Sanyasi]] (monk) joining Brahma-sampradaya [[guru]] Achyutapreksha, of the Ekadandi order.{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|p=xv}}{{Sfn|Sheridan|1991|p= 117}} Madhva studied the classics of [[Hindu philosophy]], particularly the [[Principal Upanishads]], the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' and the [[Brahma Sutras]] (''Prasthanatrayi'').{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|p=xv}} He commented on these, and is credited with thirty seven works in [[Sanskrit]].{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|p=xv-xvi}} His writing style was of extreme brevity and condensed expression. His greatest work is considered to be the ''Anuvyakhyana'', a philosophical supplement to his [[bhasya]] on the [[Brahma Sutras]] composed with a poetic structure.{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|pp=xv-xvii}} In some of his works, he proclaimed himself to be an avatar of [[Vayu]], the son of god [[Vishnu]].{{Sfn|Sarma|2000|p=20 with footnotes 3 and 4}}&lt;ref name=skhk177&gt;Sabapathy Kulandran and Hendrik Kraemer (2004), Grace in Christianity and Hinduism, James Clarke, {{ISBN|978-0227172360}}, pages 177-179&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a critic of [[Adi Shankara]]'s [[Advaita Vedanta]] and [[Ramanuja]]'s [[Vishishtadvaita Vedanta]] teachings.{{Sfn|Stoker|2011}}{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|pp=xv-xvii}} He toured India several times, visiting places such as Bengal, Varanasi, Dwarka, Goa and Kanyakumari, engaging in philosophical debates and visiting Hindu centres of learning.{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|p=xv-xvi}} Madhva established the [[Udupi Krishna Mutt|Krishna Mutt at Udupi]] with a [[murti]] secured from [[Dwarka]] Gujarat in CE 1285.{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|pp=xv-xvii}}

Madhvācārya's teachings are built on the premise that there is a fundamental difference between [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (individual soul, self) and the [[Brahman]] (ultimate reality, God Vishnu), these are two different unchanging realities, with individual soul dependent on Brahman, never identical.{{Sfn|Stoker|2011}} His school's theistic dualism teachings disagreed with the [[monism|monist]]{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|p=36-37}} teachings of the other two most influential schools of Vedanta based on Advaita's nondualism and Vishishtadvaita's qualified nondualism.{{Sfn|Stoker|2011}}{{Sfn|Bryant|2007|pp=315, 358-361}} Liberation, asserted Madhva, is achievable only through the grace of God.{{Sfn|Stoker|2011}}&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeld396/&gt; The Dvaita school founded by Madhva influenced [[Vaishnavism]], the [[Bhakti movement]] in medieval India, and has been one of the three influential [[Vedanta|Vedānta]] philosophies, along with Advaita Vedanta and Vishishtadvaita Vedanta.{{Sfn|Bryant|2007|pp=12-13, 359-361}}{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|pp=xv-xvii}}&lt;ref name=staffordbetty215&gt;Stafford Betty (2010), Dvaita, Advaita, and Viśiṣṭādvaita: Contrasting Views of Mokṣa, Asian Philosophy: An International Journal of the Philosophical Traditions of the East, Volume 20, Issue 2, pages 215-224&lt;/ref&gt; Madhva's historical influence in Hinduism, state Kulandran and Kraemer, has been salutary, but not extensive.&lt;ref name=skhk177/&gt;

==Biography==
[[File:Udupi - Scenes of Sri Krishna Temple12.jpg|thumb|Udupi, Sri Krishna Temple established by Madhvacharya]]
The biography of Madhvacharya is unclear.{{Sfn|Dehsen|1999|p=118}} Many sources date him to 1238–1317 period,{{Sfn|Bryant|2007|pp=12-13, 359-361}}{{Sfn|Sharma|2000|pp=77-78}} but some place him about the 1199-1278 period.{{Sfn|Dehsen|1999|p=118}}{{Sfn|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=266}}

Madhvācārya was born in [[Pajaka]] near [[Udupi]], a coastal district in the present day Indian state of [[Karnataka]].{{Sfn|Sharma|2000|pp=79-80}} Traditionally it is believed that Naddantillaya (Sanskrit: Madhyageha, Madhyamandira) was the name of his father and Vedavati was Madhvācārya's mother.{{Sfn|Sharma|2000|pp=79-80}} Born in a [[Tulu language|Tulu]] speaking Vaishnavite Brahmin household, he was named Vāsudeva.{{Sfn|Sharma|2000|pp=79-80}} Later he became famous by the names Purnaprajna, Anandatirtha and Madhvacarya (or just Madhva).{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|pp=xv-xvii}} Pūrnaprajña was the name given to him at the time of his initiation into ''[[sannyasa]]'' (renunciation), as a teenager.{{Sfn|Sharma|2000|pp=79-80}} The name conferred on him when he became the head of his monastery was "Ānanda Tīrtha".{{Sfn|Sharma|2000|pp=79-80}} All three of his later names are found in his works.{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|p=xv}} Madhvācārya or Madhva are names most commonly found in modern literature on him, or Dvaita Vedanta related literature.{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|pp=xv-xvii}}{{Sfn|Stoker|2011}}

Madhva began his school after his [[Upanayana]] at age seven, became a [[monk]] or ''Sannyasi'' in his teenage.{{Sfn|Sharma|2000|pp=79-80}} He joined an [[Advaita Vedanta]] monastery in Dwarka (Gujarat),{{Sfn|Sheridan|1991|p= 117}} accepted his [[guru]] to be Achyutrapreksha,{{Sfn|Dehsen|1999|p=118}} who is also referred to as Achyutraprajna in some sources.{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|p=xv}} Madhva studied the Upanishads and the Advaita literature, but was unconvinced by its nondualism philosophy of oneness of human soul and god, had frequent disagreements with his guru,{{Sfn|Sharma|2000|pp=79-80}} left the monastery, and began his own Dvaita movement based on dualism premises of ''Dvi'' – asserting that human soul and god (as Vishnu) are two different things.{{Sfn|Dehsen|1999|p=118}} Madhva never acknowledged Achyutrapreksha as his guru or his monastic lineage in his writings.{{Sfn|Sheridan|1991|p= 117}}

According to Dehsen, perhaps there were two individuals named Madhvacharya in 13th century India, with Anandatirtha – the younger Madhva being the most important early disciple of the elder Madhvacharya, and their works and life overlapped in Udupi, ''Tattvavada'' being the name adopted for Dvaita Vedanta by Anandatirtha.{{Sfn|Dehsen|1999|p=118}} Madhvacharya established a ''matha'' (monastery) dedicated to Dvaita philosophy, and this became the sanctuary for a series of Dvaita scholars such as [[Jayatirtha]], [[Vyasatirtha]], [[Vadiraja Tirtha]] and [[Raghavendra Tirtha]] who followed in footsteps of Madhva.{{Sfn|Dehsen|1999|p=118}}{{Sfn|Stoker|2011|p=see Canonical Sources section}}

A number of hagiographies have been written by Madhva's disciples and followers. Of these, the most referred to is the sixteen cantos Sanskrit biography ''Madhvavijaya'' by [[Narayana Panditacharya|Nārāyana Panditācārya]] – son of Trivikrama Pandita, who himself was a disciple of Madhva.{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|pp=xv-xvii}}

===Self proclamation as being avatar of Wind god===
In several of his texts, state Sarma and other scholars, "Madhvacharya proclaims himself to be the third [[avatar]] or incarnation of [[Vayu]], wind god, the son of [[Vishnu]]".{{Sfn|Sarma|2000|p=20 with footnotes 3 and 4}}{{Sfn|Sheridan|1991|pp= 117-118; '''Quote''': "Madhva refers frequently to the fact that Vyasa was his guru, and that Madhva himself was the third avatara of Vayu after Hanuman and Bhima.}} He, thus, asserted himself to be like [[Hanuman]] – the first avatar of Vayu, and [[Bhima]] – a Pandava in the [[Mahabharata]] and the second avatar of Vayu.{{Sfn|Sarma|2000|p=20 with footnotes 3 and 4}} In one of his [[bhasya]] on the Brahma Sutras, he asserts that the authority of the text is from his personal encounter with Vishnu.{{Sfn|Sheridan|1991|p= 118}} Madhva, states Sarma, believed himself to be an intermediary between Vishnu and Dvaita devotees, guiding the latter in their journey towards Vishnu.{{Sfn|Sarma|2000|p=20 with footnotes 3 and 4}}&lt;ref name=skhk177/&gt;

==Works of Madhvacharya==
{{main|List of works by Madhvacharya}}
Thirty seven [[Works of Madhvacharya|Dvaita texts]] are attributed to Madhvacharya.{{Sfn|Sharma|1994|p=372}} Of these, thirteen are [[bhasya]] (review and commentary) on earliest Principal Upanishads,{{Sfn|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=266}} a ''Madhva-bhasya'' on the foundational text of Vedanta school of Hinduism – [[Brahma Sutras]],{{Sfn|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=266}} another ''Gita-bhasya'' on [[Bhagavad Gita]],{{Sfn|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=266}}{{Sfn|Sharma|1994|p=372}} a commentary on forty hymns of the [[Rigveda]], a review of the [[Mahabharata]] in poetic style, a commentary called ''Bhagavata-tatparya-nirnaya'' on [[Bhagavata Purana]],{{Sfn|Sharma|1994|p=372}} plus [[stotra]]s, poems and texts on [[bhakti]] of Vishnu and his [[avatar]]s.{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|p=xvi}}{{Sfn|Bryant|2007|pp=358-361}}{{Sfn|Stoker|2011}} The ''Anu-Vyakhyana'', a supplement to Madhvacharya's commentary on Brahma Sutras, is his masterpiece, states Sharma.{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|p=xvi}}

While being a profusely productive writer, Madhvacharya restricted the access to and distribution of his works to outsiders who were not part of Dvaita school, according to Sarma.{{refn|group=note|Quote from Bartley: Madhvacharya, the founder, prohibited outsiders from reading certain texts and from learning from teachers. These restrictions on eligibility, it is claimed, ‘‘insulated his position from criticism and evaluation.’’&lt;ref name=cbartleyr126&gt;Christopher Bartley (2007), Review: Epistemologies and the Limitations of Philosophical Enquiry: Doctrine in Madhva Vedanta by Deepak Sarma, Philosophy East &amp; West Volume 57, Number 1, pages 126–128&lt;/ref&gt;}} However, Bartley disagrees and states that this is inconsistent with the known history of extensive medieval Vedantic debates on religious ideas in India which included Dvaita school's ideas.&lt;ref name=cbartleyr126/&gt;

==Madhva's philosophy==
{{Hindu philosophy}}
The premises and foundations of [[Dvaita Vedanta]], also known as ''Dvaitavada'' and ''Tattvavada'', are credited to Madhvacharya. His philosophy championed unqualified dualism.{{Sfn|Sharma|1994|p=372}} Madhva's work is classically placed in contrast with monist{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|p=36-37}} ideas of [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]]'s [[Advaita Vedanta]] and [[Ramanuja]]'s [[Vishishtadvaita|Vishishtadvaita Vedanta]].{{Sfn|Sharma|1994|p=372}}

===Epistemology===
Madhva calls [[epistemology]] as ''Anu pramana''.&lt;ref name=eliottjag/&gt; It accepts three ''[[pramāna]]'', that is three correct means of knowledge, in contrast to one of [[Charvaka]] and six of Advaita schools of Hindu philosophies:&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter and Sibajiban Bhattacharya (1994), Epistemology, in The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 6, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691073842}}, pages 53-68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howard Coward et al, Epistemology, in Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 5, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0426-0}}, pages 51-62&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Pratyaksha]]'' (प्रत्यक्ष) means perception. It is of two types in Dvaita and other Hindu schools: external and internal. External perception is described as that arising from the interaction of five senses and worldly objects, while internal perception is described as that of inner sense, the mind.&lt;ref&gt;B Matilal (1992), Perception: An Essay in Indian Theories of Knowledge, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0198239765}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kpmat&gt;Karl Potter (1977), Meaning and Truth, in Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 2, Princeton University Press, Reprinted in 1995 by Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0309-4}}, pages 160-168&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Anumāna'' (अनुमान) means inference. It is described as reaching a new conclusion and truth from one or more observations and previous truths by applying reason.&lt;ref&gt;W Halbfass (1991), Tradition and Reflection, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|0-7914-0362-9}}, page 26-27&lt;/ref&gt; Observing smoke and inferring fire is an example of ''Anumana''. This method of inference consists of three parts: ''pratijna'' (hypothesis), ''hetu'' (a reason), and ''drshtanta'' (examples).&lt;ref name=jl4647&gt;James Lochtefeld, "Anumana" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A-M, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, page 46-47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John A. Grimes, A Concise Dictionary of Indian Philosophy: Sanskrit Terms Defined in English, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791430675}}, pages 41-42&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Śábda|Śabda]]'' (शब्द) means relying on word, testimony of past or present reliable experts.&lt;ref name=dpsb&gt;DPS Bhawuk (2011), Spirituality and Indian Psychology (Editor: Anthony Marsella), Springer, {{ISBN|978-1-4419-8109-7}}, page 172&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eliottjag&gt;

*John A. Grimes, A Concise Dictionary of Indian Philosophy: Sanskrit Terms Defined in English, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791430675}}, page 238&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known as [[Agama (Hinduism)|Agama]] in Madhva's Dvaita tradition, and incorporates all the [[Vedas]]. Hiriyanna explains ''Sabda-pramana'' as a concept which means reliable expert testimony. The schools of Hinduism which consider it epistemically valid suggest that a human being needs to know numerous facts, and with the limited time and energy available, he can learn only a fraction of those facts and truths directly.&lt;ref name=mhir&gt;M. Hiriyanna (2000), The Essentials of Indian Philosophy, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120813304}}, page 43&lt;/ref&gt;

Madhva and his followers introduced ''kevala-pramana'' as the "knowledge of an object as it is", separate from ''anu-pramana'' described above.&lt;ref&gt;John A. Grimes, A Concise Dictionary of Indian Philosophy: Sanskrit Terms Defined in English, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791430675}}, page 238&lt;/ref&gt;

Madhva's Dvaita school holds that Vishnu as God, who is also [[Hari]], [[Krishna]], [[Vasudeva]] and [[Narayana]], can only be known through the proper ''samanvaya'' (connection) and ''pramana'' of the Vedic scriptural teachings.{{Sfn |Sharma|1994|pp=372–373}}{{Sfn|Bryant|2007|p=358}} Vishnu, according to Madhvacharya, is not the creator of the Vedas, but the teacher of the Vedas.{{Sfn|Sharma|1994|pp=372–373}} Knowledge is intrinsically valid, states Madhva's school, and the knower and the known are independently real.{{Sfn |Sharma|1994|pp=372–373}} Both the ritual part (''karma-kanda'', Mimamsa) and the knowledge part (''jnana-kanda'', Upanishadic Vedanta) in the Vedas, asserted Madhvacharya, are equally valid and interconnected whole.{{Sfn |Sharma|1994|pp=372–373}} As asserted by the [[Mimamsa]] school of Hindu philosophy, Madhvacharya held that the [[Vedas]] are author-less, and that their truth is in all of its parts (i.e. the [[samhita|{{IAST|saṃhitas}}]], [[brahmana|{{IAST|brāhmaņas}}]], [[aranyaka|{{IAST|āraņyakās}}]] and [[upanishad|{{IAST|upanișads}}]]).{{Sfn |Sharma|1994|pp=372–373}}..

===Metaphysics===
The [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] reality is plural, stated Madhvacharya.{{Sfn|Stoker|2011}} There are primarily two ''[[tattva|tattvas]]'' or categories of reality — ''{{IAST|svatantra tattva}}'' (independent reality) and ''{{IAST|asvatantra tattva}}'' (dependent reality).{{Sfn|Bryant|2007|p=358}} [[Ishvara]] (as God Vishnu or Krishna) is the cause of the universe and the only independent reality, in Madhvacharya's view.{{Sfn|Bryant|2007|p=358}} The created universe is the dependent reality, consisting of ''{{IAST|Jīva}}'' (individual souls) and ''Jada'' (matter, material things).{{Sfn|Stoker|2011}} Individual souls are plural, different and distinct realities. ''{{IAST|Jīva}}''s are sentient and matter is non-sentient, according to Madhvacharya.{{Sfn|Stoker|2011}}{{Sfn|Bryant|2007|pp=361-363}}

Madhva further enumerates the difference between dependent and independent reality as a fivefold division (''pancha-bheda'') between God, souls and material things.{{Sfn|Sharma|1994|p=372}}  These differences are:{{Sfn|Stoker|2011}}&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeld396&gt;James Lochtefeld (2002), ''Madhva'', The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A–M, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|978-0823931798}}, page 396&lt;/ref&gt;
(1) Between material things;
(2) Between material thing and soul;
(3) Between material thing and God;
(4) Between souls; and
(5) Between soul and God.

This difference is neither temporary nor merely practical; it is an invariable and natural property of everything. Madhva calls it ''Taratamya'' (gradation in pluralism).{{Sfn|Bryant|2007|p=358}} There is no object like another, according to Madhvacharya. There is no soul like another. All souls are unique, reflected in individual personalities. The sea is full; the tank is full; a pot is full; everything is full, yet each fullness is different, asserted Madhvacharya.{{Sfn|Bryant|2007|p=358}}{{Sfn|Sharma|1994|pp=372-375}}

Even in liberation ([[moksha]]), states Madhvacharya, the bliss is different for each person, based on each's degree of knowledge and spiritual perfection.{{Sfn|Sharma|1994|pp=372-375}}{{Sfn|Bryant|2007|pp=361-363}} This liberation, according to him, is only achievable with grace of God Krishna.{{Sfn|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=266}}

====Nature of the Brahman====
Madhva conceptualised [[Brahman]] as a being who enjoys His own bliss, while the entire universe evolves through a nebulous chaos.{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|p=353}} He manifests, every now and then, to help the evolution process. The four primary manifestation of Him as the Brahman are, according to Madhva, [[Vasudeva]], [[Pradyumna]], [[Aniruddha]] and Sankarasana, which are respectively responsible for the redemptive, creative, sustaining and destructive aspects in the universe.{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|p=353}} His secondary manifestations are many, and all manifestations are at par with each other, it is the same infinite no matter how He manifests.{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|pp=353-354}} Brahman is the creator of the universe, perfect in knowledge, perfect in knowing, perfect in its power, and distinct from souls, distinct from matter.{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|pp=353-354}} For liberation, mere intellectual conceptualization of Brahman as creator is not enough, the individual soul must feel attraction, love, attachment and devotional surrender to Him, and only His grace leads to redemption and liberation, according to Madhva.{{Sfn|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=266}}{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|pp=417-424}}{{Sfn|Sharma|1994|p=373}}

The Vishnu as Brahman concept of Madhvacharya is a concept similar to God in major world religions.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Myers (2000), Brahman: A Comparative Theology, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0700712571}}, pages 124-127&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|p=7}} His writings led some early colonial-era [[Indologist]]s such as [[George Abraham Grierson]] to suggest the 13th-century Madhva was influenced by [[Christianity]],&lt;ref name=skhk177/&gt; but later scholarship has rejected this theory.{{Sfn|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=266}}{{Sfn|Sarma|2000|pp=19-21}}

====Atat tvam asi====
One of the [[Mahāvākyas|Mahavakyas]] (great sayings) in Hinduism is ''Tat tvam asi'', or "Thou art That", found in verse 6.8.7 of the ~700 BCE text [[Chandogya Upanishad]].&lt;ref&gt;Sanskrit: [https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/छान्दोग्योपनिषद्_३ छान्दोग्योपनिषद् १.२ ॥षष्ठोऽध्यायः॥] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307015055/https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/%E0%A4%9B%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%97%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AF%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%B7%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%8D_%E0%A5%A9 |date=7 March 2016 }} Wikisource&lt;br&gt;English Translation:Robert Hume, [https://archive.org/stream/thirteenprincipa028442mbp#page/n267/mode/2up Chandogya Upanishad] 6.8, The Thirteen Principal Upanishads, Oxford University Press, pages 246-250&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=asgupta125&gt;AS Gupta, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1397392 The Meanings of "That Thou Art"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413074549/http://www.jstor.org/stable/1397392 |date=13 April 2016 }}, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 12, No. 2, pages 125-134&lt;/ref&gt; This section of [[Chandogya Upanishad]] is credited to sage Uddalaka and the text considered central in Vedanta and the Brahma Sutras, interpreted to mean that there is no difference between the soul within (Thou) and the Brahman (That).&lt;ref name=asgupta125/&gt; The Dvaita school led by Madhva reinterpreted this section, by parsing the Sanskrit text as ''Atat tvam asi'' or "Thou are not That", asserting that there is no Sanskrit rule which does not allow such parsing.{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|pp=368-374}} He accepted that the tradition and prior scholars had all interpreted the text to be "Tat tvam asi", but then asserted that there is no metaphysical or logical requirement that he should too.{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|pp=373-374}}

===Soteriology===
Madhvacharya considered [[Jnana Yoga]] and [[Karma Yoga]] to be insufficient to the path of liberation without [[Bhakti]].&lt;ref name=skhk178/&gt;{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|p=12, 135-136, 183}} Narayana or Vishnu was the supreme God to Madhva, who can only be reached through Vayu – the son of God; further, states Madhva, faith leads to the grace of God, and grace leads to the liberation of soul.&lt;ref name=skhk178&gt;Sabapathy Kulandran and Hendrik Kraemer (2004), Grace in Christianity and Hinduism, James Clarke, {{ISBN|978-0227172360}}, pages 178-179&lt;/ref&gt;

The knowledge of God, for Madhvacharya, is not a matter of intellectual acceptance of the concept, but an attraction, affection, constant attachment, loving devotion and complete surrender to the grace of God.{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|p=417}} He rejects monist theories that knowledge liberates, asserting instead that it is Divine grace through Bhakti that liberates.{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|pp=418-419}} To Madhva, God obscures reality by creating [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]] and [[Prakriti]], which causes bondage and suffering; and only God can be the source of soul's release.{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|pp=422-423}} Liberation occurs when, with the grace of God, one knows the true nature of self and the true nature of God.{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|pp=423-424}}

===Ethics===
Evil and suffering in the world, according to Madhvacharya, originates in man, and not God.{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|p=359}} Every ''[[Jiva]]'' (individual soul) is the agent of actions, not ''Jada'' (matter), and not ''Ishvara'' (God).{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|p=360}} While Madhva asserts each individual self is the ''Kartritva'' (real agency), the self is not an absolutely independent agent to him.{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|p=361}} This is because, states Madhva, the soul is influenced by sensory organs, one's physical body and such material things which he calls as gifts of God.{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|p=361}} Man has free will, but is influenced by his innate nature, inclinations and past [[karma]].{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|p=361}}

Madhvacharya asserts, ''Yathecchasi tatha kuru'', which Sharma translates and explains as "one has the right to choose between right and wrong, a choice each individual makes out of his own responsibility and his own risk".{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|p=361}} Madhva does not address the [[problem of evil]], that is how can evil exist with that of a God who is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent.&lt;ref name=dastibryantfw&gt;{{cite book|author=David Buchta |editor=Matthew R. Dasti and Edwin F. Bryant| title=Free Will, Agency, and Selfhood in Indian Philosophy|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=iWLSAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA270|year = 2014| publisher=Oxford University Press| isbn=978-0199922758| pages=270–276}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|p=270, 370-371}} According to Sharma, "Madhva's tripartite classification of souls makes it unnecessary to answer the problem of evil".{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|p=270, 370-371, '''Quote:''' The problem of evil and suffering in the world is the most difficult one in Theism. We have explained Madhva's attitude to the allied problem of freedom and freewill, on the basis of the doctrine of natural selection of good or bad and of the tripartite classification of souls. It is not therefore necessary for Madhva to answer the question of the consistency of evil with Divine goodness.}} According to David Buchta, this does not address the problem of evil, because the omnipotent God "could change the system, but chooses not to" and thus sustains the evil in the world.&lt;ref name=dastibryantfw/&gt; This view of self's agency of Madhvacharya was, states Buchta, an outlier in Vedanta school and Indian philosophies in general.&lt;ref name=dastibryantfw/&gt;

Moral laws and ethics exist, according to Madhva, and are necessary for the grace of God and for liberation.{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|p=363, 368, 370-373}}

==Views on other schools==

Madhvacharya was a fierce critic of competing Vedanta schools,{{Sfn|Sharma|1994|p=11-17, 372}} and other schools of Indian philosophies such as [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]].{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|pp=128-129, 180-181}}{{Sfn|Sharma|1994|p=150-151, 372, 433-434}}{{Sfn|Sharma|2000|pp=80-81}} He wrote up arguments against twenty one ancient and medieval era Indian scholars to help establish the foundations of his own school of thought.{{Sfn|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=266}}

Madhvacharya was fiercest critic of [[Advaita]] Vedanta, accusing Shankara and Advaitins for example, as "deceitful demons" teaching Buddhism under the cover of Vedanta.{{Sfn|Sharma|1994|p=372}} Advaita's nondualism asserts that Atman (soul) and Brahman are blissful and identical, unchanging transcendent Reality, there is interconnected oneness of all souls and Brahman, and there are no pluralities.{{Sfn|Stoker|2011}}&lt;ref name=staffordbetty215/&gt; Madhva in contrast asserts that Atman (soul) and Brahman are different, only [[Vishnu]] is the Lord (Brahman), individual souls are also different and depend on Vishnu, and there are pluralities.{{Sfn|Stoker|2011}}&lt;ref name=staffordbetty215/&gt; Madhva criticized [[Advaita]] as being a version of [[Mahayana Buddhism]], which he regarded as [[nihilism|nihilistic]].&lt;ref name=smschari6/&gt; Of all schools, Madhva focussed his criticism on Advaita most, and he wrote four major texts, including ''Upadhikhandana'' and ''Tattvadyota'', primarily dedicated to criticizing Advaita.&lt;ref name=smschari6&gt;SMS Chari (1999), Advaita and Visistadvaita, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120815353}}, pages 5-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Madhvacharya disagreed with aspects of [[Ramanuja]]'s Vishishtadvaita.{{Sfn|Sharma|1994|p=11-17, 372}} Vishishtadvaita school, a realist system of thought like Madhvacharya's Dvaita school, also asserts that Jiva (human souls) and Brahman (as Vishnu) are different, a difference that is never transcended.&lt;ref name=staffordbetty215/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edward Craig (2000), Concise Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415223645}}, pages 517-518&lt;/ref&gt; God Vishnu alone is independent, all other gods and beings are dependent on Him, according to both Madhvacharya and Ramanuja.{{Sfn|Sharma|1994|p=373}} However, in contrast to Madhvacharya's views, Vishishtadvaita school asserts "qualified non-dualism",{{Sfn|Stoker|2011}} that souls share the same essential nature of Brahman,{{Sfn|Stoker|2011}} and that there is a universal sameness in the quality and degree of bliss possible for human souls, and every soul can reach the bliss state of God Himself.&lt;ref name=staffordbetty215/&gt;{{Sfn|Sharma|1994|pp=373-374}} While the older school of Vishishtadvaita asserted "qualitative monism and quantitative pluralism of souls", states Sharma, Madhvacharya asserted both "qualitative and quantitative pluralism of souls".{{Sfn|Sharma|1994|p=374}}

Shankara's Advaita school and Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita school are premised on the assumption that all souls can hope for and achieve the state of blissful liberation; in contrast, Madhvacharya believed that some souls are eternally doomed and damned.{{Sfn|Sharma|1994|pp=374-375}}{{Sfn|Bryant|2007|pp=361-362}}

Madhvacharya's style of criticism of other schools of Indian philosophy was part of the ancient and medieval Indian tradition. He was part of the [[Vedanta]] school, which emerged in post-Vedic period as the most influential of the six schools of [[Hindu philosophy]], and his targeting of Advaita tradition, states Bryant, reflects it being the most influential of Vedanta schools.{{Sfn|Bryant|2007|pp=13, 16 with note 2}}

==Influence==
{{main|Haridasa}}
Madhvacharya views represent a subschool of [[Vaishnavism]], just like Ramanuja's.{{Sfn|Sharma|1994|pp=372-375}} Both championed Vishnu, often in the ''saguna'' form of Vishnu's [[avatar]] [[Krishna]].{{Sfn|Bryant|2007|pp=359-360}} However, 11th-century Ramanuja's ideas have been most influential in Vaishnavism.&lt;ref&gt;Roshen Dalal (2011), The Religions of India: A Concise Guide to Nine Major Faiths, Penguin Books, {{ISBN|978-0143415176}}, page 380&lt;/ref&gt;

Madhvacharya's ideas led to the founding of Haridasa sect of Vaishnavism in Karnataka, also referred to as ''Vyasakuta'', ''[[Dasakuta]]'' or ''Dasa Dasapantha'',{{Sfn|Sharma|2000|pp=xxxii-xxxiii, 514-516}} known for their devotional songs and music during the [[Bhakti movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Nettl (1992), The Garland Encyclopedia of World Music, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0824049461}}, page 262&lt;/ref&gt;

Other influential subschools of Vaishnavism competed with the ideas of Madhvacharya, such as the [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Chaitanya]] subschool, whose [[Jiva Gosvami]] asserts only Krishna is "Svayam Bhagavan" (original form of God), in contrast to Madhva who asserts that all Vishnu avatars are equal and identical, with both sharing the belief that emotional devotion to God is the means to spiritual liberation.{{Sfn|Bryant|2007|pp=381-387}} According to Sharma, the influence of Madhva's Dvaita ideas have been most prominent on the Chaitanya school of [[Bengal]] Vaishnavism,{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|pp=22-23}} and in [[Assam]].{{Sfn|Sharma|2000|pp=xxxii-xxxiii, 514-516}}

A subsect of [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism|Gaudiya Vaishnavas]] from Orissa and West Bengal claim to be followers of Madhvacharya. Madhva established in [[Udupi Sri Krishna Matha|Udupi Krishna Matha]] attached to a god Krishna temple. Gaudiya Vaishnavas also worship Krishna, who is in the mode of Vrindavana.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===Hindu-Christian controversies===
Madhvacharya was misperceived and misrepresented by both Christian missionaries and Hindu writers during the colonial era scholarship.{{Sfn|Sarma|2000|pp=19-25}}{{Sfn|Sharma|2000|pp=609-611}} The similarities in the primacy of one God, dualism and distinction between man and God, devotion to God, the son of God as the intermediary, predestination, the role of grace in salvation, as well as the similarities in the legends of miracles in Christianity and Madhvacharya's Dvaita tradition fed these stories.{{Sfn|Sarma|2000|pp=19-25}}{{Sfn|Sharma|2000|pp=609-611}} Among Christian writers, GA Grierson creatively asserted that Madhva's ideas evidently were "borrowed from Christianity, quite possibly promulgated as a rival to the central doctrine of that faith".{{Sfn|Sarma|2000|p=20}} Among Hindu writers, according to Sarma, SC Vasu creatively translated Madhvacharya's works to identify Madhvacharya with Christ, rather than compare their ideas.{{Sfn|Sarma|2000|pp=22-24}}

Modern scholarship rules out the influence of Christianity on Madhvacharya,&lt;ref name=skhk177/&gt;{{Sfn|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=266}} as there is no evidence that there ever was a Christian settlement where Madhvacharya grew up and lived, or that there was a sharing or discussion of ideas between someone with knowledge of the Bible and Christian legends, and him.{{Sfn|Sharma|2000|pp=609-611}}&lt;ref&gt;A History of Indian Philosophy Vol 4, pg 93&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monasteries===
{{See also|Ashta Mathas of Udupi}}
[[File:Udupi Sri Krishna Matha Temple.jpg|thumb|The Entrance to [[Udupi Sri Krishna Matha|Sri Krishna Matha]] at Udupi]]

Madhvacharya established eight ''mathas'' (monasteries) in Udupi. These are referred to as ''Madhva mathas'', or ''Udupi ashta matha'', and include [[Palimaru]] matha, [[Adamaru]] matha, [[Krishnapura, India|Krishnapura]] matha, [[Puttige matha]], [[Shiroor|Shirur]] matha, [[Sodhe]] matha, [[Kaniyooru]] matha and [[Pejavara]] matha.&lt;ref name=vraoltcc27&gt;V Rao (2002), Living Traditions in Contemporary Contexts: The Madhva Matha of Udupi, Orient Blackswan, {{ISBN|978-8125022978}}, pages 27-32&lt;/ref&gt; These eight surround the ''Anantheswara'' Krishna [[Hindu temple]].&lt;ref name=vraoltcc27/&gt; The matha are laid out in a rectangle, the temples on a square grid pattern.&lt;ref name=vraoltcc27/&gt; The monks in the matha are [[sannyasa|sannyasi]]s, and the tradition of their studies and succession ([[Paryaya|Paryaya system]]) were established by Madhvacharya.&lt;ref name=vraoltcc27/&gt;

There are Madhva mathas set up all over India. Including those in Udupi, there are twenty four Madhva mathas in India.&lt;ref name=vraoltcc3&gt;V Rao (2002), Living Traditions in Contemporary Contexts: The Madhva Matha of Udupi, Orient Blackswan, {{ISBN|978-8125022978}}, pages 33-37&lt;/ref&gt; The main center of Madhva's tradition is in [[Karnataka]].&lt;ref name=vraoltcc3/&gt; The monastery has a pontiff system, that rotates after a fixed period of time. The pontiff is called ''Swamiji'', and he leads daily Krishna prayers according to Madhva tradition,&lt;ref name=vraoltcc3/&gt; as well as annual festivals.&lt;ref name=vraotcc4/&gt; The process and Vedic mantra rituals for Krishna worship in Dvaita monasteries follow the procedure written by Madhvacharya in ''Tantrasara''.&lt;ref name=vraotcc4&gt;V Rao (2002), Living Traditions in Contemporary Contexts: The Madhva Matha of Udupi, Orient Blackswan, {{ISBN|978-8125022978}}, page 43-49&lt;/ref&gt; The Krishna worship neither involves ''bali'' (sacrifice) nor any fire rituals.&lt;ref name=vraotcc4/&gt;

The succession ceremony in Dvaita school involves the outgoing Swamiji welcoming the incoming one, then walking together to the icon of Madhvacharya at the entrance of Krishna temple in Udupi, offering water to him, expressing reverence then handing over the same vessel with water that Madhvacharya used when he handed over the leadership of the monastery he founded.&lt;ref name=vraoltcc3/&gt;

The monastery include kitchens, ''bhojan-shala'', run by monks and volunteers.&lt;ref name=raysrinivas97/&gt; These serve food daily to nearly 3,000 to 4,000 monks, students and visiting pilgrims without social discrimination.&lt;ref name=raysrinivas97/&gt; During succession ceremonies, over 10,000 people are served a vegetarian meal by Udupi ''bhojan-shalas''.&lt;ref name=raysrinivas97&gt;K Ray and T Srinivas (2012), Curried Cultures: Globalization, Food, and South Asia, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520270121}}, pages 97-98&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film==
In 1986 a film directed by [[G. V. Iyer]] named ''[[Madhvacharya (film)|Madhvacharya]]'' was premiered, it was one of the films made entirely in [[Sanskrit]] language in which all of Jagadguru Madhvacharya's works were compiled.&lt;ref name="Madhavacharya (film) VD"&gt;{{cite web|title=Madhavacharya (film)|url=http://www.vedanta.com/store/madhavacharya_dvd.htm|publisher=http://www.vedanta.com/|accessdate=16 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121224185240/http://www.vedanta.com/store/madhavacharya_dvd.htm|archive-date=24 December 2012|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Madhvacharya (film) NY"&gt;{{cite web|title=Madhvacharya (film)|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/176308/Madhvacharya/details|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Newa Hinduism''' is a form of [[Hinduism]] followed by the [[Newar people]].

==Dance==
[[Image:Nyetamaru Ajima masked dance.jpg|thumb|200px|The Nyetamaru Ajima masked dance is performed at Nyeta in Kathmandu in April.]]

Newar dance consists of sacred masked dance, religious dance without the use of masks known as Dyah Pyakhan, a dance performed as part of a ritual and meditation practice known as Chachaa Pyakhan ({{Lang-new| चचा प्याखं}}) (Charya Nritya in Sanskrit) and folk dance. There are also masked dance dramas known as Daboo Pyakhan which enact religious stories to the accompaniment of music.Masked dances are performed on stone dance platforms that exist at all major city squares. They are the highlight of religious festivals. Most dances are held annually while certain dances are performed once every 12 years. The performances are organized by dance societies in which membership is hereditary. The history of these traditional dances goes back centuries.

==Festivals and events ==

Newa Hinduism and [[Newa Buddhism]] share the festivals of each other.&lt;ref&gt;http://swaniga.com/festival-%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%96-%E0%A4%9A%E0%A4%96/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''night of wishes''' (sometimes '''night of rewards''') (''Laylat-ur Raghaeb'') is a [[Muslim]] tradition.  Followers of this tradition believe that if, on the first Thursday of [[Rajab]], they recite a special set of prayers, they will be rewarded by the fulfillment of their wishes.&lt;ref name=II/&gt;&lt;ref name=MC/&gt;

The tradition is based on the oft-quoted passage attributed to [[Mohammed]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt; ''It is most important, however, that none of you should neglect the first Thursday night in Rajab, for it is the night that the angels call the Night of Wishes. This is because, by the time the first third of the night has elapsed, there will not be a single angel still at large in the heavens, nor in any region of the earth bar one. They will all be gathered together in the Ka'ba and the area immediately surrounding it. Allah will condescend to notice that they have assembled there, and He will say: 'My angels, ask Me for whatever you wish!' Their response to this will be: 'Our Lord, the request we wish to make is that You grant forgiveness to those who faithfully keep the fast in Rajab,' whereupon Allah will tell them: 'That I have already done!'''&lt;ref name=II/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Among some factions of Islam, the tradition is repudiated as a false tradition with no basis in the true writings of Mohammamed.&lt;ref name=IT/&gt;

{{The Salvation Army}}
In 1917, five years after the death of the founder of the [[Salvation Army]] [[William Booth]], his son, General [[Bramwell Booth]], inaugurated the '''Order of the Founder''' to recognise [[Salvationists]] who had rendered distinguished service, such as would have specially commended itself to the Founder.&lt;ref&gt;The Salvation Army Yearbook, 2010 pp. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

The first awards were made in 1920 to 15 officers and one soldier. Three years later, seven officers and one local officer were honored, but since then the awards have been made much more sparingly and, to date, 104 officers and 106 lay Salvationists have been recognised with the Army's highest honor, a mere 210 in total over 83 years.

The first presentation was to a soldier, Private Herbert Bourne, for outstanding Christian witness and service during military service in the [[First World War]]. A few senior leaders like Commissioner [[T. Henry Howard]], General [[Evangeline Booth]] and Commissioner [[Catherine Bramwell-Booth]] have been picked out but. much more commonly, faithful and devoted service by less well known personalities has been acknowledged.

Some of the early awards went to people in the United Kingdom, Australia, [[Indonesia]], Russia, France and the United States, but very quickly recipients from Japan, [[Guyana]], Switzerland, Denmark, The [[Netherlands]], China and Norway were picked out. New Zealand has probably had a higher than average recognition for the size of its population, but other territories such as [[Korea]], South America West and [[Zimbabwe]] have also been featured.

The honor is rarely given because every nomination is carefully and painstakingly scrutinised by a panel of senior leaders at IHQ. Salvationists have every reason to be proud of those who have been awarded this outstanding recognition for meritorious Christian example, witness and service.

The recipients of the order are:

Rev.'''Otto Faller SJ''' (18 February 1889 – 16 May 1971) was Provincial Superior of the Jesuit order in Germany, [[educator]], [[teacher]] and [[Dean (education)|Dean]] at [[Stella Matutina]] in Feldkirch, Austria and [[Kolleg St. Blasien]] in Germany, professor of [[patristic]] studies at the [[Gregorian University]].  He was lifelong editor of the works of [[St. Ambrose]]. At the request of [[Pope Pius XII]], he contributed to the preparation of the [[dogma]] of the [[assumption of Mary]] and organized new [[Papal]] [[Charity (practice)|charity]] and [[Papal]] [[refugee]] offices during World War II.

==Life==

===Early years===
[[Image:AmbroseOfMilan.jpg|200px|thumb|left|The Latin edition of the works of Saint Ambrose of Milan was the main preoccupation of Father Otto Faller]]
Otto Faller was born on 18 February 1889 in [[Lenzkirch|Saig]], a small village in the [[Black Forest]]. He entered the Jesuit Order in 1910. As Jesuits had been outlawed in Germany since the time of the [[Kulturkampf]],  he studied [[theology]] in Tisis, [[Austria-Hungary|Austria]], and [[Valkenburg (South Holland)|Valkenburg]], [[The Netherlands|Holland]]. After his philosophical and theological studies, he studied [[classical languages]] in [[Vienna]] and [[Münster]],  Germany. Otto Faller obtained two [[doctorate]]s, in [[theology]] and [[philosophy]]. In 1918 he was ordained [[priest]] and in 1924 he began teaching at the prestigious Kolleg [[Stella Matutina]] in [[Feldkirch, Vorarlberg|Feldkirch]], Austria.&lt;ref&gt;Stella Matutina (Hrsg.) 75 Jahre Stella Matutina, Bnd 1-3; Selbstverlag, Feldkirch, Austria, 1931; Band I: Abhandlungen von Mitgliedern des Lehrkörpers; Band II: Abhandlungen von ehemaligen Zöglingen; Band III: Stellazeiten und Stellaleben, geschildert von Zöglingen mit 103 Bildtafeln, index of names&lt;/ref&gt;

===Educator===
At first educator, then teacher, he was named director (dean) of the [[Stella Matutina]] Kolleg in Feldkirch, Austria.  After the [[Nazis]] passed the "1000 Mark law" in 1933, which de facto prohibited any German entering Austria without prior payment of the tax and thus excluded German students from attending Austrian schools, he helped in the foundation of  [[Kolleg St. Blasien]] in the Black Forest and became its dean.&lt;ref&gt;P. Josef Knünz SJ, 100 Jahre Stella Matutina 1856-1956, J.N.Teutsch, Bregenz 1956&lt;/ref&gt;  Five years later, the [[National Socialist]] forced the closing of the school, which was to become an [[Adolf Hitler]] [[school]]. Like several other Jesuits, he was asked to leave Germany, despite an ardent protest by the local bishop.&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Kolleg St. Blasien#Widerstand gegen den Nationalsozialismus durch St. Blasier Patres]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assistant to Pope Pius XII===
Otto Faller went to Rome, where the General of the [[Jesuit]] Order [[Wlodimir Ledochowski]] named him Professor at the [[Gregorian University]] and Father [[General superior|Superior]] at the Scriptorium,  then the residence of Jesuit scholars in Rome. Together with Monsignor [[Ferdinando Baldelli]], he was asked in 1943 by [[Pope Pius XII]] to develop a Papal charity [[Pontificia Commissione di Assistenza]]  from scratch. This was developed quickly in cooperation with the charity efforts of Sister [[Pascalina Lehnert]] and Monsignore [[Pope Paul VI|Giovanni Battista Montini]]. In 1944 the Pope asked him to form a new Papal refugee office to assist the tens of thousands of displaced persons in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;25 Jahre Kolleg St.Blasien, in: "Kollegbrief 1959" Kolleg St. Blasien (Hrsg), St. Blasien 1959, Seiten 20-25; die Geschichte des Kollegs 1934-1959,  p.23&lt;/ref&gt;

In this capacity he was involved in the organisation of charities, especially food items, clothing and shelter for Italians and displaced persons,  the negotiation of the transfer of all portable religious art from [[Monte Cassino]], prior to its destruction. Much effort was devoted behind the scenes to a plan by the Pope, to create a Papal fleet in order to allow refugees to leave Europe for the Americas and to bring in badly needed food shipments from there;  safe conduct could not be obtained by the war parties.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Blet, Pius XII. and the Second World War, Paulist Press, 1997, p.227ff&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career After 1946===

After the war in 1946 he returned to the Black Forest and reopened Kolleg St. Blasien against the initial advice of his superiors, but with significant material assistance of Pope Pius XII via Madre [[Pascalina Lehnert]]. In 1949, he initiated the formation of a nationwide Jesuit [[alumni association]].&lt;ref&gt;Stellaner Vereinigung e.V.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a leading educator and Dean,  Faller had experienced the State, to determine content and orientation of education on a local and national level at the expense of private educational institutions. In 1949,  he formed an alliance of Catholic, Protestant and secular non-governmental schools to assure some freedom for private educational institutions especially in the State of Baden-Württemberg.&lt;ref&gt;25 Jahre Kolleg St.Blasien, in: "Kollegbrief 1959" Kolleg St. Blasien (Hrsg), St. Blasien 1959, Seiten 20-25; die Geschichte des Kollegs 1934-1959, p.22&lt;/ref&gt; They succeeded in influencing relevant legislation in several State parliaments and on the national level. On 24 September 1967, the President of the Federal Republic of Germany awarded him the pour le merite first class for his effort.&lt;ref&gt;Stellaner Nachrichten, 13. Jahrgang, September 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, the Jesuit general [[Jean-Baptiste Janssens]] named Father Otto Faller the head the German Jesuit Province,&lt;ref&gt;Provincia Germania Superior&lt;/ref&gt;  which included in those days the province of [[Kerala]] in  [[India]] and parts of [[Indonesia]]. As Provincial, he continued pushing for the interests of [[private schools]] in Germany. In 1951, he forwarded all necessary documentation for the [[beatification]] of [[Rupert Mayer]] to Rome,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Anton Körbling, Pater Rupert Mayer, Regensburg, 1997, p.204&lt;/ref&gt;  and successfully supported it:  Only five years later, in 1956,  [[Pope Pius XII]]  declared [[Rupert Mayer]] a [[Servant of God]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  Otto Faller was considered to be intelligent, compassionate, caring but also strict as superior.  In 1970, he referred apologetically to this:  ''Do not remind me of the time of my youthful transgressions.'' After a  [[heart attack]] in 1956, he stepped down and continued his publications of Ambrose for the Commission for Editing the Corpus of the Latin Church Fathers ([[Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum|CSEL]]) in Vienna, Austria. He died at [[Kolleg St. Blasien]] on 16 May 1971.

==Writings==
Many of the writings of Faller are in various Journals. In ''[[Stimmen der Zeit]]'', Otto Faller published a number of articles on patristic topics. Aside from his book on the assumption, his main focus was St. Ambrose.

===Dogma of the Assumption of Mary===
While in [[Rome]], preparations for the [[dogma]] of the [[Assumption of Mary]] were underway. Because the early centuries of [[Christianity]] were silent on this, the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] had a problem of explanation. Pope Pius XII asked Otto Faller, then a patristic scholar at [[Gregorian University]],  to research this issue. Faller published his book in 1946, ''On the Silence of the Early Centuries'' in Latin.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Faller, De Priorum Saeculorum Silentio circa Assumptionem BMV, Rome, 1946&lt;/ref&gt; The publication, while getting the praises of Pope Pius XII and [[Pope Paul VI]],  did not put all questions to rest and he did not continue this line of thought after 1946.

===Saint Ambrose of Milan===

Earlier, Otto Faller began research on the writings of [[Ambrose of Milan]], one of only four [[Church Fathers]] and a [[Doctor of the Church]]. His publications focused on the authenticity of several writings attributed to Ambrose. At the expressed wish of [[Pope Pius XI]], a devoted Ambrose [[scholar]] and former head of the [[Ambrosian Library]], he began research with a text critical edition of the works of Ambrose underway for the Academy of Science in Vienna since 1860.  He published Ambrose works on the sacraments, explanation of symbols, the mysteries, confession, fath, Holy Spirit, and the death of emperors Theodosius and Valentinian. The letters of Ambrose he completed shortly before his death, but without, the all important prolegomina, which would have explained his apparatus and methods. Therefore, his last Ambrose publication Epistulae et acta raised some methodological questions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2518">'''Our Lady of Nourieh''', ''Saydet el Nourieh'' in Arabic, is a Marian shrine in [[Hamat]], [[Lebanon]]. ''Nourieh'' is a derivative of the Arabic word, ''nour'', meaning light.  Thus, in English, the Marian shrine can be called, '''Our Lady of Light'''.

The story of Our Lady of Light shrine and monastery is celebrated throughout Lebanon, a country where Christianity has existed since Jesus first evangelized in [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Sidon]], and therefore, Lebanon is often considered part of the “[[Holy Land]].” &lt;ref name="infohub.com"&gt;[http://www.infohub.com/TRAVEL/SIT/sit_pages/11448.html Lebanon - A Holy Land with a message | religious tour to Lebanon | Cathedral of Saint George | Pigeon’s Rock | Sarafand | Crusaders’ castle | monastery of Deir Nourieh | Syriac Maronite Monastery in Kaftoun | Deir El Balamand&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the first Christian communities were set up in Lebanon during the time of the apostles.&lt;ref name="infohub.com"/&gt;

It is believed that two sailors built the shrine in the 4th century.  One winter night, on a very stormy sea, the two sailors found themselves in peril.  They began praying, and the Virgin appeared to them as a light and guided them gently to the shore of [[Theoprosopon]] near modern-day [[Chekka]] in [[North Governorate|North Lebanon]]. The grateful sailors carved a cave in the cliff and dedicated it to the Virgin Mary, and called the shrine, Our Lady of Light. A Greek Orthodox monastery was built in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lebanon-hotels.com/tourism/NOURIEH/ Saydet el Nourieh Lebanon&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The miraculous icon of the [[Theotokos]] has been venerated for centuries for having glowed with light to attract wayward ships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antiochian.org/damascus The Road From Damascus: A Report from the Delegation to Damascus to Consecrate Three New Bishops for North America | Antiochian.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The shrine is a popular Christian pilgrimage site in Lebanon, and tourists and pilgrims alike enjoy the beautiful view of the bay from atop historic Cape [[Theoprosopon]].

The Religious Society of Friends, commonly known as [[Quakers]], encouraged some values which may have been conducive to encouraging scientific talents.  A theory suggested by [[David Hackett Fischer]] in his book ''Albion's Seed'' indicated early Quakers in the US preferred "practical study" to the more traditional studies of [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] or [[Latin]] popular with the elite. Another theory suggests their avoidance of dogma or clergy gave them a greater flexibility in response to [[science]].

Despite those arguments a major factor is agreed to be that the Quakers were initially discouraged or forbidden to go to the major law or humanities schools in Britain due to the [[Test Act]]. They also at times faced similar discriminations in the United States, as many of the colonial universities had a [[Puritan]] or [[Anglican]] orientation. This led them to attend "Godless" institutions or forced them to rely on hands-on scientific experimentation rather than academia.

Because of these issues it has been stated that Quakers are better represented in science than most religions. Some sources, including Pendlehill {{harv|Thomas|2000}} and [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], indicate that for over two centuries they were overrepresented in the [[Royal Society]]. Mention is made of this possibility in studies referenced in [[religiosity and intelligence]] and in a book by [[Arthur Raistrick]]. Regardless of whether this is still accurate, there have been several noteworthy members of this denomination in science. The following names a few.

'''Qutb ad-Dīn Haydar''' was a Persian [[Sufism|Sufi]] saint and [[Malamatiyya|Malāmatī]]-[[Qalandariyya|Qalāndārī]] [[Sheikh]], of possible Turkic origin,&lt;ref&gt;Woods, John E. and Ernest Tucker, ''History and historiography of post-Mongol Central Asia and the Middle East'', (GmBh &amp; Co., 2006), 31.&lt;/ref&gt; and is buried in Zava, [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]]. Qazvini, author of the ''[[Tarikh-i guzida]]'', states Haydar was alive at the time of the [[Mongol invasion of Central Asia|Mongol invasion]] in 1220 and died in 1221 CE/618 AH.&lt;ref&gt;Woods, 31.&lt;/ref&gt; The date of his life helpfully indicates the time when the use of cannabis took hold in Islamic society.&lt;ref&gt;Franz Rosenthal ''The Herb Hashish Versus Medieval Muslim Society'' (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;He apparently followed an ascetic discipline until he ate some marijuana that he found growing. He then took to eating it constantly. It was deemed compatible with a spiritual life, a positive aid even. "God almighty has granted you as a special favour an awareness of the virtues of this leaf, so that your use of it will dissipate the cares that obscure your souls and free your spirits from everything that might hamper them, keep carefully, then the deposit he has confided in you."&lt;ref&gt;Haydar quoted in Mohammad Hassan Chirazi ''How Hashish Was Discovered'', quoted in G Weit ''Le Grandeur d'Islam'', quoted in Robert Connell Clarke ''Hashish'' p.25 (1998, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Use of cannabis migrated into Iraq, Syria and Egypt where it was known as 'Haydar's Lady' or 'the Wine of Haydar'.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Green ''Cannabis'' p.56 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Haydar – the Persian form of his name is Heydar – founded an order of mendicant [[dervish]]es called as the ''[[Haydariyya]]'' known for their celibacy and self-mortification through piercing their own bodies with iron rings. His followers also wore felt and walked barefoot.&lt;ref&gt;Woods, 31.&lt;/ref&gt; According to al-Jawbari in his book ''Kashf al-Asrar'' (Unveiling the Secrets)"members of the Haydariyya dervish order took Hashish before staging their performances of self-mutilation, in order to numb the pain."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Irwin ''The Arabian Nights A Companion'' p.56 (1994, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Jawbari's ''Kashf al-Asrar'' was written in 13th century Iraq. The author was a conjuror whose writing was an exposé of not only magic tricks but also the 'dodges' of beggars and other 'low-life'.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Irwin ''The Arabian Nights A Companion'' p.131&lt;/ref&gt; In fact the term ''hashishiyya'' is synonymous with 'low-life' and has been used as such for centuries in the Islamic world.

He is also known by [[Heyder]].

The '''Samadhi of Ranjit Singh''' ({{lang-pa|{{Nastaliq|رنجیت سنگھ دی سمادھی}}}}; {{Lang-ur|{{nq|رنجیت سنگھ کی سمادھی}}}}) is a 19th-century building in [[Lahore]], [[Pakistan]] that houses the [[Urn|funerary urns]] of the [[Sikh|Jat Sikh]] ruler [[Maharaja Ranjit Singh (Punjab)|Ranjit Singh]] (1780 - 1839). It is located adjacent the [[Lahore Fort]] and [[Badshahi Mosque]], as well the [[Gurdwara Dera Sahib]] which marks the spot where the 5th guru of [[Sikhism]], [[Guru Arjan Dev]], died.

==History==
Construction of the building was started by his son, [[Kharak Singh]]  on the spot where he was [[cremation|cremated]], and was completed by his youngest son, [[Duleep Singh]] in 1848.

===Modern era===
The funerary urns were removed from the marble pavilion and were replaced by a simple slab around 1999.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} This was done as part of the preparations for the [[Khalsa]] Tricentenary and the visit of Sikh dignitaries from India. It has been kept well by [[Government of Pakistan|Pakistani government]]. The Samadhi was damaged by an [[2005 Kashmir earthquake|earthquake]] in 2005 but was repaired soon.

==Architecture==
[[Image:SORS1.jpg|right|thumb|The [[samadhi]] combines Hindu, Islamic, and Sikh motifs.]]

===Building===
The building combines elements of [[Sikh architecture|Sikh]], [[Hindu architecture|Hindu]], and [[Islamic architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2016/01/16/features/samadhi-of-ranjit-singh-a-sight-of-religious-harmony/  Samadhi of Ranjit Singh – a sight of religious harmony, Pakistan Today. JANUARY 16, 2016, NADEEM DAR]&lt;/ref&gt; Portions of the building are believed to have been plundered from the adjacent Lahore Fort.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2016/01/16/features/samadhi-of-ranjit-singh-a-sight-of-religious-harmony/  Samadhi of Ranjit Singh – a sight of religious harmony, Pakistan Today. JANUARY 16, 2016, NADEEM DAR]&lt;/ref&gt;

The building has gilded fluted domes and [[cupola]]s, and an ornate [[balustrade]] around the upper portion of the building. The front of the doorway has images of [[Ganesh]], [[Devi]] and [[Brahma]] that are cut from red sand stone. The dome is decorated with Naga (serpent) hood designs - the product of Hindu craftsmen that worked on the project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2016/01/16/features/samadhi-of-ranjit-singh-a-sight-of-religious-harmony/  Samadhi of Ranjit Singh – a sight of religious harmony, Pakistan Today. JANUARY 16, 2016, NADEEM DAR]&lt;/ref&gt; The wooden panels on the ceiling are decorated with stained glass work, while the walls are richly decorated with floral designs. The ceilings are decorated with glass mosaic work.

===Funerary urns===
[[Ranjit Singh]]'s ashes are contained in a marble [[urn]] in the shape of a [[Indian lotus|lotus]], sheltered under a marble pavilion inlaid with [[pietra dura]], in the centre of the tomb.  Surrounding him, in smaller urns, are the ashes of four [[sati (practice)|sati]] queens and seven concubines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/sunday-special/kaleidoscope/-sati-choice-before-maharaja-ranjit-s-ranis/99411.html ‘Sati’ choice before Maharaja Ranjit’s Ranis, Kanwarjit Singh Kang,  Jun 28, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Associated monuments==
[[File:Gurdwara Dehra Sahib and Samadhi of Ranjit Singh.jpg|thumb|The [[Gurdwara Dera Sahib]] is adjacent to the samadhi, and commemorates the spot where Guru Arjan Dev Ji died.]] 
Two small monuments to the west of the main building commemorate Maharaja Ranjit Singh's son Maharaja Kharak Singh and grandson [[Nau Nihal Singh]], along with their wives. The building is located adjacent to [[Gurdwara Dera Sahib]], the place where martyrdom of [[Guru Arjun]] took place.

'''Sects of Sikhism''' are sub-traditions within [[Sikhism]] that believe in an alternate lineage of Gurus, or have a different interpretation of the Sikh scriptures, or believe in following a living guru, or other concepts that differ from the orthodox.&lt;ref name="Syan2014p170"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hardip Singh Syan|editor=Pashaura Singh and Louis E.

The early Sikh sects were [[Udasi]]s  founded by [[Sri Chand]] – the elder son of [[Guru Nanak]], and the Minas [[Mina (Sikhism)|Prithi Chand]] – the elder son of [[Guru Ram Das]] respectively, in parallel to the official succession of the Sikh Gurus. Later on [[Ram Rai]] – son of [[Guru Har Rai]] formed his own sect at [[Dehradun]] and his followers are called [[Ramraiya|Ram Raiyas]]s.&lt;ref name="FenechMcLeod2014p260"/&gt; Many splintered Sikh communities formed during the period between the death of [[Guru Har Krishan]] and the coronation of [[Guru Tegh Bahadur]]. These sects have had considerable differences. Various other Sikh sects emerged over the Sikh history. Some of these sects were financially and administratively supported by the [[Mughal Empire]] in the hopes of gaining a more favorable and compliant citizenry.&lt;ref name="Takhar2014p350"&gt;{{cite book|author=Opinderjit Kaur Takhar|editor=Pashaura Singh and Louis E.

In the 19th century, [[Sanatan Sikh]]s, [[Namdhari]]s and [[Nirankari]]s sects were formed in Sikhism, seeking to reform and return to what each believed was the pure form of Sikhism.&lt;ref name="fenech273"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Louis E.

==Early Sikh sects==
===Ravidassia===
{{main|Ravidassia religion}}
Ravidassia is considered a Sikh sect around the world.Their gurdwara services and beliefs are somewhat similar to mainstream Sikhism, although its followers do not necessarily need to keep uncut hair or [[Kesh (Sikhism)|Kesh]].  They also believe that [[Ravidas]] is a guru.
Until 2009, Ravidassias considered themselves a part of mainstream Sikhism. They decided to split themselves into a separate sect when there religious leader [[Ramanand Dass]] was shot dead by extremists in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]].

===Udasi===
{{main|Udasi}}
'''Udasi''' has been an early sect based on the teachings of [[Sri Chand]] (1494–1643), the son of [[Guru Nanak]], the founder and the first [[Guru#Guru in Sikhism|Guru]] of [[Sikhism]]. The Udasis do not reject the Sikh Gurus, but attach greater importance to the line of succession from Guru Nanak through Sri Chand to the Udasi [[mahant]]s. They interpret the message of [[Guru Granth Sahib]] in [[Vedanta|Vedantic]] terms. They do not abide by the Khalsa's [[Rehat Maryada]].&lt;ref name="Oberoi1994p78"/&gt;

[[File:Temple inside Udasi Akhada -KTM -11-Tripureswar by ST (6).JPG|thumb|right|Udasis protected many Sikh Gurdwaras in the 18th century, managed them in the 19th century. They built simple shrines far from Punjab. Above: an Udasi shrine in [[Nepal]].]]
Udasis are known for their ''Akharas'' along with the Nirmala sect of Sikhism. They accept asceticism and monastic traveler lifestyle. ''Udasi'' is derived from the Sanskrit word "Udasin",&lt;ref name="Oberoi1994p78"&gt;{{cite book|author=Harjot Oberoi|title=The Construction of Religious Boundaries: Culture, Identity, and Diversity in the Sikh Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1NKC9g2ayJEC&amp;pg=PA78 |year=1994|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-61592-9|pages=78–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; it literally means "detached, journey", and that reflects their approach to spiritual and temporal life.&lt;ref name="Fenech2014p375"/&gt; They were key in preserving Sikhism from extinction in the 18th century, after the death of Guru Gobind Singh and during the Mughal persecution, particularly in the decades between the martyrdom of [[Banda Singh Bahadur]] in 1716 and the rise of [[Ranjit Singh]] and the Sikh Empire. The Udasi ascetic ''akharas'' managed Gurdwaras, rebuilt them and preserved the Sikh scriptures. They were respected and patronized by Ranjit Singh through land grants and responsibility of temples.&lt;ref name="Fenech2014p375"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pashaura Singh|author2=Louis E.

The Udasis were key interpreters of the Sikh philosophy and the custodians of important Sikh shrines until the [[Singh Sabha movement]]. They brought a large number of people in the Sikh fold during the 18th and the early 19th centuries.&lt;ref name="PSLEF_2014"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Pashaura Singh |author2=Louis E.

They accept images and statues of Sikh Gurus inside temples, as well as Hindu iconography. They greet each other with "Om namo [[Brahman]]e",&lt;ref name="Fenech2014p375"/&gt; and they practice [[Hatha yoga]] like the Hindus.&lt;ref name="Oberoi1994p78"/&gt; When the [[Singh Sabha movement]], dominated by [[Khalsa]] Sikhs, redefined the Sikh identity in the early 20th century, the Udasi [[mahant]]s were expelled from the Sikh shrines.&lt;ref name="Fazal2014"&gt;{{cite book |author=Tanweer Fazal |title="Nation-state" and Minority Rights in India: Comparative Perspectives on Muslim and Sikh Identities |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1WwtBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA113 |date=1 August 2014 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-75179-3 |pages=113 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the Udasis have increasingly regarded themselves as Hindus rather than Sikhs.&lt;ref name="JSH_1993"&gt;{{cite book |author1=John Stratton Hawley |author2=Gurinder Singh Mann |title=Studying the Sikhs: Issues for North America |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fWJGAECpClsC&amp;pg=PA182 |year=1993 |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=978-0-7914-1426-2 |page=182 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miharvans===
The Miharvan sect followed Baba Prithi Chand (1558–1618), the eldest son of [[Guru Ram Das]] after the younger brother [[Guru Arjan]] was officially made the next Guru.&lt;ref name="Singha2000p165"&gt;{{cite book|author=H.

This sect was shunned by orthodox Sikhs, declared by [[Guru Gobind Singh]] as one of the five ''Panj Mel'' that a Sikh must avoid.&lt;ref name="CallewaertSnell1994p23"/&gt;

They emerged in a period of religious persecution and inner dispute within the Sikh tradition during the 17th-century on the appropriateness of violence and non-violence in the pursuit of religious freedoms and spiritual matters. According to Hardip Syan and Pritam Singh, Miharvans emphasized more of the non-militant approach of Guru Nanak and earlier Gurus in theological pursuits, while the Guru Hargobind followers pursued the "miri-piri" approach and began militarizing the Sikh tradition to resist the Mughal persecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Singh | first=Pritam | title=Review: Sikh militancy in the seventeenth century: religious violence in the Moghul and early modern India, by Hardip Singh Syan | journal=South Asian History and Culture | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | volume=6 | issue=2 | date=2015-01-14 | doi=10.1080/19472498.2014.999446 | pages=307–310}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Syan | first=Hardip Singh | title=Early Sikh Historiography | journal=Sikh Formations | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | volume=7 | issue=2 | year=2011 | doi=10.1080/17448727.2011.593297 | pages=145–160}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Miharvan-Minas controlled Amritsar and Harmandir Sahib built under Guru Arjan for much of the 17th-century.&lt;ref name=mcleod130&gt;{{cite book|author=W.

===Ramraiyas===
{{main|Ramraiya}}
'''Ram Raiyas''' are a sect of Sikhism who followed Ram Rai, the eldest son of [[Guru Har Rai]]. He was sent by his father as an emissary to the Mughal emperor [[Aurangzeb]] in Delhi. Aurangzeb objected to a verse in the Sikh scripture (''Asa ki Var'') that stated, "the clay from a Musalman's grave is kneaded into potter's lump", considering it an insult to Islam. Ram Rai explained that the text was miscopied and modified it, substituting "Musalman" with "Beiman" (faithless, evil) which Aurangzeb approved.&lt;ref name=eosramrai/&gt;&lt;ref name="McLeod2014p260"/&gt; The willingness to change a word led Guru Har Rai to bar his son from his presence. Aurangzeb responded by granting Ram Rai a [[jagir]] (land grant) in Garhwal region ([[Uttarakhand]]). The town later came to be known as Dehradun, after ''Dehra'' referring to Ram Rai's shrine.&lt;ref name="McLeod2014p260"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Louis E. Fenech|author2=W. H.

===Nanakpanthi===
{{main|Nanakpanthi}}
A '''Nanakpanthi''' is a follower of the teachings of [[Guru Nanak]], the first guru of [[Sikhism]]. The community transcends the boundaries of [[Sikhism]] and [[Hinduism]], and was also a reference to the early Sikh community.&lt;ref name="globalsikhstudies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsikhstudies.net/pdf/2013riv/balwant1.pdf |title= The Doctrine of Guru-Panth, Origin and its Characteristic Features|author=Dr. Balwant Singh Dhillon, Guru Nanak Dev University |publisher=globalsikhstudies.net|accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most [[Sindhi Hindu]] people are Nanakpanthi, and during the 1881 and 1891 censuses, the community could not decide whether to self-identify as Hindu or Sikh.&lt;ref&gt;Empires of the Indus: The Story of a River - ''Alice Albinia'' {{ISBN|978-1-84854-786-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911, [[Shahpur District]] ([[Punjab]]) reported 12,539 Hindus (20% of the total Hindu population) identifying themselves as Nanakpanthi, in addition to 9,016 Sikhs (22% of the total Sikh population).&lt;ref&gt;[[A Glossary of the Tribes and Castes of the Punjab and North-West Frontier Province]], Vol. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The institutional focus of Nanakpanthi social life was around a ''dharamsala'', playing the same role before the 20th century as the Gurdwara has played thereafter under Khalsa dominated period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Hawley|editor=Pashaura Singh and Louis E.

==Contemporary groups==
===Namdharis===
{{main|Namdhari}}
[[File:Ustad Baljit Singh Luxmi Namdhari and Fateh Singh.jpg|thumb|Namdhari Sikh singer and musicians.]]
'''Namdharis''' are a sect of [[Sikhism]], also known as ''Kuka Sikhs''. They believe that the line of [[Sikh Gurus]] did not end with [[Guru Gobind Singh]] because he did not die in Nanded, he escaped and lived in secret. &lt;ref name=britsikhssects&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sikhism/Sects-and-other-groups Sects and other groups: Sikhism], Encyclopaedia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; This sect claims  he nominated Balak Singh to be the 11th Guru, a tradition that was continued through the Namdhari leaders.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Textual Sources for the Study of Sikhism|author=McLeod, W.H.|date=1984|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn= 9780719010637| url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Mj28AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA126|page=126|accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Socio-Religious Reform Movements in British India|author=Jones, K.W.|date=1989|volume=3|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521249867|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PoBJJej_IiwC&amp;pg=PA90|page=90|accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their 12th guru was Ram Singh, who moved the sects center to Bhaini Sahib (Ludhiana). They have been strictly vegetarian and a strong opponent of cattle slaughter, and retaliated against Muslims for killing cows in 1872.&lt;ref name="FenechMcLeod2014p219"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HaarKalsi2009p10"/&gt; Their leader Ram Singh was arrested by the British and he was exiled to Rangoon Myanmar. Dozens of Namdharis were arrested by the British and executed without trial in Ludhiana and Ambala.&lt;ref name="FenechMcLeod2014p219"/&gt; They consider ''Guru Granth Sahib'' and ''[[Dasam Granth]]'' as equally important, and compositions from the ''[[Chandi di Var]]'' are a part of their daily [[Nitnem]]. Like Hindus, they circumambulate the fire (havan) during their weddings, but they differ in that the hymns are those from the ''Adi Granth''.&lt;ref name="FenechMcLeod2014p219"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HaarKalsi2009p10"&gt;{{cite book|author1= Kristen Haar|author2= Sewa Singh Kalsi|title=Sikhism|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=YOI1nB_zTyAC | year=2009|publisher =Infobase Publishing| isbn=978-1-4381-0647-2|pages= 10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Namdharis wear homespun white turbans, which they wrap around their heads (''sidhi pagri'').&lt;ref name=britsikhssects/&gt;&lt;ref name="HaarKalsi2009p10"/&gt; They are called ''Kuka'', which means "crier, shouter", for their ecstatic religious practices during devotional singing. They also meditate, using ''mala'' (rosary).&lt;ref name="HaarKalsi2009p10"/&gt; Some texts refer to them as ''Jagiasi'' or ''Abhiasi''.&lt;ref name="FenechMcLeod2014p219"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Louis E.

===Nirankari===
{{main|Nirankari}}
The [[Nirankari]] movement was founded by Baba Dyal Das, as a Sikh reform movement around the middle of 19th century, in the later part of [[Ranjit Singh]]'s reign. Nirankari means "without form", and reflects their belief that God cannot be represent in any form and true Sikh faith is based on ''nam simaran''.&lt;ref name="HaarKalsi2009p11"&gt;{{cite book|author1= Kristen Haar|author2= Sewa Singh Kalsi|title=Sikhism|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=YOI1nB_zTyAC | year=2009|publisher =Infobase Publishing| isbn=978-1-4381-0647-2|pages= 11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nirankari have opposed any form of ritualism in Sikhism, emphasizing the need to return to the teachings of their founder Guru Nanak. They were the first sect to demand major changes in how Sikh temples are operated, the Sikh ceremonies. They also disagreed with the orthodox Sikhs on only 10 Gurus and the scripture as the living Guru. Nirankaris believe that human guru to interpret the scripture and guide Sikhs is a necessity.&lt;ref name=britsikhssects/&gt;&lt;ref name="HaarKalsi2009p11"/&gt;

The Nirankari sect diverged into two in 1940s, when ''Sant Nirankaris'' emerged as a separate group. They believe that scripture is open and therefore added works of their leaders into the Guru Granth Sahib. This led to increasingly conflicts with the orthodox Sikhs. In late 1970s, Jarnail Singh Bhindranvale repeatedly denounced their practices. In 1978, the orthodox Sikhs and Sant Nirankaris had an armed confrontation in Amritsar which resulted in many deaths. In 1980, the leader of Sant Nirankari tradition, Gurbachan Singh, was assassinated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1= Louis E. Fenech|author2= W. H.

===Akhand Kirtani Jatha===
The Akhand Kirtani Jatha emerged in the early 20th century. They interpret Guru Gobind Singh's 5Ks differently than the orthodox Sikhs. They believe the requirement is "keski", not "kes". This means that male and female Sikhs must wear a small turban. The males also wear a full turban on top of it. They also give much importance to devotional singing of kirtans, often organizing all night group singing sessions.&lt;ref name=britsikhsects/&gt;&lt;ref name=verne560/&gt;

===Radhasoamis===
The [[Radhasoami]] Satsang (lit. "True association of the Lord of the Soul") or Radha Soami movement derives its name from the gopi Radha and Soami which means Lord Krishna's soul, ideas also found in the [[Vaishnavism]] tradition. This movement was started by Baba Shiv Dayal in the 19th century, who is also known as Soamiji.&lt;ref name="HaarKalsi2009p12"/&gt; The sect has been headquartered in Beas, with branches elsewhere such as Agra. It also believes that living gurus are necessary for a guided spiritual life.&lt;ref name="HaarKalsi2009p12"/&gt; They do not install the ''Guru Granth Sahib'' or any other scriptures in their sanctum, as they consider it ritualistic. Instead, the guru sits in the sanctum with the satsang (group of Sikh faithfuls) and they listen to preachings from the Adi Granth as well as sing hymns together.&lt;ref name="HaarKalsi2009p12"/&gt; They believe in social equality, forbid caste distinctions and have attracted [[Dalit]]s to their tradition. They are active outside India, and attracted converts to their movement.&lt;ref name="HaarKalsi2009p12"&gt;{{cite book|author1= Kristen Haar|author2= Sewa Singh Kalsi|title=Sikhism|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=YOI1nB_zTyAC | year=2009|publisher =Infobase Publishing| isbn=978-1-4381-0647-2|pages= 12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Radhasoamis, states Mark Juergensmeyer, are considered as an offshoot of Sikhism in Punjab.&lt;ref name="Juergensmeyer1995p7"/&gt; In the context of [[Dharma]], states Juergensmeyer, they can be considered also as a part of Hinduism because they share their cultural outlook, some practices and theological concepts such as [[Karma]], [[Yoga]] (Shabd) and [[Guru]]. However, they are also different from Hindus and Sikhs because they reject the concept of a sacred scripture, rituals such as ''karha prasad'' and pilgrimage gatherings and ceremonies. The Radhasoamis accept saints and living gurus from anywhere, and their history is traceable since about early 1860s.&lt;ref name="Juergensmeyer1995p7"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Juergensmeyer|title= Radhasoami Reality: The Logic of a Modern Faith|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=slX3eRycszMC|year= 1995|publisher =Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-01092-7|pages=7–8, 14–18, 55-57}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the Radhsoamis, six elements form the framework of their faith: a living ''guru'' (someone as locus of trust and truth), ''bhajan'' (remembering ''Sat Nam'', other practices believed to be transformative), ''satsang'' (fellowship, community), ''seva'' (serve others without expecting anything in return), ''dera'' (community organization, shrine) and ''bhandara'' (large community gathering).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Juergensmeyer|title=Radhasoami Reality: The Logic of a Modern Faith|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=slX3eRycszMC|year= 1995|publisher =Princeton University Press|isbn= 0-691-01092-7|pages=11–12, 40–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Radhasoami are strict vegetarians. They are active in charitable work such as providing free medical services and help to the needy. They do not believe in orthodox Sikh ritual practices such as covering one's head inside the temple or removing shoes, nor do they serve ''karah prasad'' (offering) at the end of prayers.&lt;ref name="HaarKalsi2009p12"/&gt; According to Pierluigi Zoccatelli, there were an estimated 3 million Radhasoami followers worldwide in 2004, with many subsects based on the Guru. Of these, the Beas headquartered group had 2 million followers.&lt;ref name="ClarkeClarke2004"/&gt; Other subsects and movements influenced by Radhasoami include Divine Life Mission, Eckankar, Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness, Science of Spirituality and others.&lt;ref name="ClarkeClarke2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pierluigi Zoccatelli|editor=Peter Clarke|title=Encyclopedia of New Religious Movements|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DouBAgAAQBAJ |year=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-49970-0|pages=508–509}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sanatan Sikhs===
[[Sanatan Sikh]]s emerged as a significant group of conservative Sikhs who opposed the orthodox Sikhs in their interpretation of Sikhism, particularly during the [[Singh Sabha Movement]].&lt;ref name="fenech273"/&gt; They campaigned for an inclusive interpretation that accepted wide range of beliefs drawn from [[Hinduism]] and [[Islam]].&lt;ref name="fenech273"/&gt; Sanatan Sikhs affirmed that they are a tradition within Hinduism, that Sikhs and Hindus are indivisible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Louis E.

Sanatan Sikhs accept beliefs and practices such as the belief in the teachings of the [[Veda]]s and [[Purana]]s, Hindu epics and [[Sufi]] Pirs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair|title=Sikhism: A Guide for the Perplexed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vdhLAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA85|year=2013|publisher=Bloomsburg Academic|isbn=978-1-4411-0231-7|pages=85–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SinghFenech2014p28"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pashaura Singh|author2=Louis E.

===3HO===
The [[3HO]] sect is a western group that emerged in 1971, founded by Harbhajan Singh also known as Yogi Bhajan. It requires both men and women to wear turbans, and adopt the surname Khalsa. They also known call themselves the "Sikh Dharma movement" and "Khalsa Dharma movement" and are called "Gora Sikhs" by the mainstream adherents of Sikhism. Their name 3HO, stands for Healthy Happy Holy Organization. This Sikh sect emphasizes meditation and Yoga. The sect started and grew a number of international business brands such as Yogi tea. The orthodox Khalsa does not consider them as Sikhs. The 3HO sect has a strict rahit, the code of conduct expectation.&lt;ref name=britsikhsects/&gt;&lt;ref name="HaarKalsi2009p9"/&gt;

===Subtraditions within orthodox Sikhism===
Sikh identities within orthodox Khalsa varies significantly in terms of their practices and beliefs. They are generally classified as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=WH McLeod|title=Sikhs and Sikhism: Comprising Guru Nanak and the Sikh Religion, Early Sikh Tradition, The Evolution of the Sikh Community, Who is a Sikh?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QhV5AAAAMAAJ|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-566892-6|pages=112–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Amritdhari: those Sikhs who have been initiated with ''amrit'' ceremony. It is mandatory for them to wear the Five-Ks: Kes (uncut hair), Kangha (comb), Kirpan (sword), Kachha (knee-length pants) and Kara (steel bracelet on the right wrist). They also follow the Khalsa code of discipline such as strict dietary rules such as vegetarianism, saying daily prayers.&lt;ref name="Kalsi2009p5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cole2004"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sylvie Langlaude|title=The Right of the Child to Religious Freedom in International Law|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PeSvEHvjoNoC |year=2007|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=90-04-16266-6|pages=27 with footnote 149}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Kesdhari: those Sikhs who have not been initiated, may or may not ever get initiated. They keep their hair uncut, wear turban, and generally observe some or all elements of the Khalsa code of discipline. However, they do not follow one of more practices of the Amritdhari, and may observe some codes or practices occasionally.&lt;ref name="Kalsi2009p5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cole2004"/&gt;
*Sahajdhari (or Sahijdhari&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eleanor Nesbitt|title=Sikhism: A Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XebnCwAAQBAJ |year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-874557-0|pages=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;): literally, "slow adopter", they identify themselves as Khalsa Sikhs but they are neither initiated nor follow some or all of the Five-Ks or the Sikh code of conduct. This term is a misnomer because these Sikhs may never intend to slowly become Amritdhari. The Sahajdhari include all non-Kesdhari Sikhs and as well as those born in a Sikh family who may observe some elements of the Sikh dress code or other practices.&lt;ref name="Kalsi2009p5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cole2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Owen Cole|title=Understanding Sikhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OJnXAAAAMAAJ|year=2004|publisher=Dunedin Academic|isbn=978-1-903765-15-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sikh Channel''' is a [[United Kingdom]]-based, [[free-to-air]], [[Sikhism|Sikhi]]-focused satellite television channel. It broadcasts across [[Europe]] on [[satellite television]], in Canada and is also streamed live on the [[internet]].

{{Taoism}}
A '''Taoist priest''', '''Taoist monk''', '''Taoist master''' or '''Professional Taoist''' (道士 "master of the [[Tao]]") is a [[priest]] in [[Taoism]]. Some orders are [[monasticism|monastic]] (Quanzhen orders), while the majority are not (Zhengyi orders).

Some of the monastic orders are hermitic, and their members practice seclusion and [[asceticism|ascetic]] lifestyles in the mountains, with the aim of becoming ''[[xian (Taoism)|xian]]'', or immortal beings. Non-monastic priests live among the populace and manage and serve their own temples or popular temples.

The activities of the Taoists tend to be informed by materials which may be found in the ''[[Daozang]]'', or Daoist Canon; however, Taoists generally choose, or inherit, specific texts which have been passed down for generations from teacher to student, rather than consulting published versions of these works.

==Orders==
Taoist orders are conventionally categorised into two main branches: Quanzhen and Zhengyi.

===Quanzhen Taoism===
[[Quanzhen Taoism]], which is present almost exclusively in the north of [[China]], includes all Taoist orders which have a monastic institution. Their lifestyle is comparable to that of the [[bhikkhu|Buddhist monk]]s in that they are celibate, vegetarian, and live in monasteries. The [[White Cloud Temple]] in [[Beijing]] is the main monastery of the Longmen school of Quanzhen, and is also the main headquarters of mainland China's [[Chinese Taoist Association|official Taoist Church]].

===Zhengyi Taoism===
The other main priesthood is [[Zhengyi Taoism]], in which the priests can marry, eat meat, live in their own homes, and found and manage their own temples or serve in folk religious temples. They are mostly priests part-time and can hold other jobs. Their lineages are transmitted through training and ordination by another priest, although historically they received a formal confirmation in their role by the [[Celestial Master]], the highest priest. Fragmentation of the lineage of the Celestial Masters has made Zhengyi priests more independent. In mainland China the Taoist Church has in theory taken over the power to regulate them (although only a minority of them are registered with the Church). Zhengyi orders are present all over China, although with different names according to the local lineages. For example, in northern China there are the ''yinyang'' masters of the [[Lingbao Taoism|Lingbao]] sub-tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 2007. p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Beighton was born in [[Ednaston]], [[Derbyshire]], [[England]]. In 1821 Beighton and fellow missionary, [[John Ince (missionary)|John Ince]] toured the coast of [[Queda]] on the [[Malay Peninsula]], first visiting [[Queda Muda]], so that they could distribute copies of the Bible in Chinese as well as Gospel tracts while engaging in personal [[evangelism]]. At [[Pulu Tega]], they had an interview with the [[Raja|Rajah]], who gave them permission to visit Queda.

Beighton died in [[Penang]], [[Malaysia]] after 25 years of missionary work &lt;ref name="natbio"/&gt; and was buried in the Protestant Cemetery in Penang.

'''Thomas L. Brodie''', [[Order of Preachers|OP]] (born 1943) is a Dominican priest and writer. He has worked in academia and published scholarly books on Christianity. He supports the [[Christ myth theory]], the theory that Jesus did not exist as a historical figure.

== Early life ==
He was born in [[Crusheen]], County Clare.

==Career==

Brodie earned his [[Doctor of Sacred Theology|STD]] at the [[Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas]] in Rome in 1988, at the age of 48. He has taught [[Hebrew Scriptures]] and New Testament in various institutions across the United States and in South Africa, including the [[Aquinas Institute of Theology]] in St. Louis, Missouri.

Brodie has written a number of books about the Bible, with emphases on the [[Gospel of John]], [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] and the narratives of [[Elijah]] and [[Elisha]]. He has most frequently been published by [[Oxford University Press]] and [[Sheffield Phoenix Press]].

== Christ mythicism and sanctions ==
His 2012 book ''Beyond the Quest for the Historical Jesus: Memoir of a Discovery'' caused controversy when Brodie endorsed the [[Christ myth theory]] and expressed that Jesus of Nazareth was not a historical figure, a belief he reports he has held since the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas L. Brodie.  ''Beyond the Quest for the Historical Jesus: Memoir of a Discovery.'' [[Sheffield Phoenix Press]] (2012) {{ISBN|190753458X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the publication of the book and revelations of his belief that Jesus did not exist, ''[[The Irish Sun]]'' reported in January 2013 that Brodie had been forced to quit his teaching job and banned from lecturing while his writings were being investigated. 
The final judgement of the Dominican Order on the matter was published in their periodical [[Doctrine and Life]] in May–June 2014.

The '''Vendidad''' [[Help:IPA/English|/ˈvendi'dæd/]] or '''Videvdat''' Avestan: ''𐬬𐬍𐬛𐬀𐬉𐬬𐬋𐬛𐬁𐬙𐬀''  is a collection of texts within the greater compendium of the [[Avesta]]. However, unlike the other texts of the Avesta, the ''Vendidad'' is an ecclesiastical code, not a liturgical manual.

==Name==

The name of the texts is a contraction of the [[Avestan language]] ''Vî-Daêvô-Dāta'', "Given Against the [[Daeva|''Daeva''s]] (Demons)", and as the name suggests, the ''Vendidad'' is an enumeration of various manifestations of evil spirits, and ways to confound them. According to the divisions of the Avesta as described in the [[Denkard]]&lt;!--  (book 8) --&gt;, a 9th-century text, the ''Vendidad'' includes all of the 19th ''nask'', which is then the only ''nask'' that has survived in its entirety.

==Contents==

The ''Vendidad''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s different parts vary widely in character and in age. Although some portions are relatively recent in origin, the subject matter of the greater part is very old. In 1877, [[Karl Friedrich Geldner]] identified&lt;!-- "Metrik des jüngeren Avesta", Stuttgart, 1877 --&gt; the texts as being linguistically distinct from both the Old Avestan language texts as well as from the Yashts of the younger Avesta. 
Today, there is controversy over historical development of the Vendidad. The Vendidad is classified by some as an artificial, young Avestan text. Its language resembles Old Avestan. The Vendidad is thought to be a Magi (Magi-influenced) composition.&lt;ref name="Zaehner_1961"&gt;{{cite book|last=Zaehner|first=Richard Charles|title=The Dawn and Twilight of Zoroastrianism|year=1961|location=New York|publisher=Putnam}} p. 160ff.&lt;br /&gt;Portions of the book are available [http://www.farvardyn.com/magi1.php online].&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that the Vendidad belongs to a particular school, but "no linguistic or textual argument allows us to attain any degree of certainty in these matters."&lt;ref name="EI_Avesta"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Kellens|first=Jean|title=Avesta|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Iranica|volume=3|year=1989|location=New York|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|pages=35–44}} p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vendidad consists of 22 fargards containing fragments of discussions between [[Ahura Mazda]] and [[Zoroaster]]. The arrangement does not suggest it was composed by the prophet's contemporaries.

However, some consider the Vendidad a link to ancient early oral traditions, later written as a book of laws for the Zoroastrian community.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frashogard.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/the-vendidad-part1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The writing of the Vendidad began - perhaps substantially - before the formation of the Median and Persian Empires, before the 8th century B.C.E..

In addition, as with the Yashts, the date of composition of the final version does not exclude the possibility that some parts of the Vendidad may consist of very old material. Even in this modern age, Zoroastrians are continually rewriting old spiritual material.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/languages/index.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first chapter is dualistic [[creation myth]], followed by the description of a destructive winter comparable with the [[deluge (mythology)|great floods]] of various other mythologies. The second chapter recounts the legend of ''Yima'' ([[Jamshid]]). Chapter 19 relates the temptation of [[Zoroaster]], who, when urged by [[Angra Mainyu]] to turn from the good religion, turns instead towards [[Ahura Mazda]]. The remaining chapters cover diverse rules and regulations, through the adherence of which evil spirits may be confounded. Broken down by subject, these fargards deal with the following topics (chapters where a topic is covered are in brackets):

* hygiene (in particular care of the dead) [3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 16, 17, 19] and cleansing [9,10];
* disease, its origin, and spells against it [7, 10, 11, 13, 20, 21, 22];
* mourning for the dead [12], the [[Tower of Silence|Towers of Silence]] [6], and the remuneration of deeds after death [19];
* the sanctity of, and invocations to, [[Atar]] (fire) [8], [[Zam]] (earth) [3,6], [[Aban|Apas]] (water) [6, 8, 21] and the light of the stars [21];
* the dignity of wealth and charity [4], of marriage [4, 15] and of physical effort [4]
* statutes on unacceptable social behaviour [15] such as breach of contract [4] and assault [4];
* on the worthiness of priests [18];
* praise and care of the bull [21], the dog [13, 15], the otter [14], the ''Sraosha'' bird [18], and the ''[[Haoma]]'' tree [6].

There is a degree of [[moral relativism]] apparent in the Vendidad, and the diverse rules and regulations are not always expressed as being mystical, absolute, universal or mandatory. The Vendidad is mainly about social laws, mores, customs and culture. In some instances, the description of prescribed behaviour is accompanied by a description of the penances that have to be made to atone for violations thereof. Such penances include:
* payment in cash or kind to the aggrieved;
* [[corporal punishment]] such as whipping;
* repeated recitations of certain parts of the liturgy such as the [[Ahuna Vairya]] invocation.

== Value of the Vendidad among Zoroastrians ==

Most of the Zoroastrians continue to use the Vendidad as a valued and fundamental cultural and ethical moral guide, viewing their teachings as essential to Zoroastrian tradition  and see it as part of Zoroastrianism original perspectives about the truth of spiritual existence. They argue that it has origins on early oral tradition, being only later written.&lt;ref&gt;http://tenets.zoroastrianism.com/vndimp33.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.frashogard.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/the-vendidad-part-3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/ranghaya/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergent reformist Zoroastrian movement reject the later writings in the Avesta as being corruptions of Zarathustra's original teachings and thus do not consider the Vendidad as an original Zoroastrian scripture. They argue that it was written nearly 700 years after the death of Zarathustra and interpret the writing as different from the other parts of the Avesta.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vohuman.org/Article/Is%20The%20Vandidad%20a%20%20Zarathushtrian%20Scripture.htm] http://accessnewage.com/articles/mystic/avest.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

An article by Hannah M. G. Shapero sums up the refomist perspective:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pyracantha.com/Z/vendnet.html&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"How do Zoroastrians view the Vendidad today? And how many of the laws of the Vendidad are still followed? This depends, as so many other Zoroastrian beliefs and practices do, on whether you are a "reformist" or a "traditionalist." The reformists, following the Gathas as their prime guide, judge the Vendidad harshly as being a deviation from the non-prescriptive, abstract teachings of the Gathas. For them, few if any of the laws or practices in the Vendidad are either in the spirit or the letter of the Gathas, and so they are not to be followed. The reformists prefer to regard the Vendidad as a document which has no religious value but is only of historic or anthropological interest. Many Zoroastrians, in Iran, India, and the world diaspora, inspired by reformists, have chosen to dispense with the Vendidad prescriptions entirely or only to follow those which they believe are not against the original spirit of the Gathas."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Liturgical use==
Although the ''Vendidad'' is not a liturgical manual, a section of it may be recited as part of a greater ''[[Yasna]]'' service. Although such extended ''Yasna''s appears to have been frequently performed in the mid-18th century (as noted in [[Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron|Anquetil-Duperron's]] observations), it is very rarely performed at the present day.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} In such an extended service, ''Visparad'' 12 and ''Vendidad'' 1-4 are inserted between ''Yasna'' 27 and 28. The ''Vendidad'' ceremony is always performed between nightfall and dawn, though a normal ''Yasna'' is performed between dawn and noon.

Because of its length and complexity, the ''Vendidad'' is read, rather than recalled from memory as is otherwise necessary for the ''Yasna'' texts. The recitation of the ''Vendidad'' requires a priest of higher rank (one with a ''moti khub'') than is normally necessary for the recitation of the ''Yasna''.

The ''Vendidad'' should not be confused with the ''Vendidad Sadé''. The latter is the name for a set of manuscripts of the ''[[Yasna]]'' texts into which the ''Vendidad'' and ''Visperad'' have been interleaved. These manuscripts were used for liturgical purposes outside the yasna ceremony proper, not accompanied by any ritual activity. The expression ''sadé'', "clean", was used to indicate that these texts were not accompanied by commentaries in Middle Persian.

== Life ==
Wang Jueyi was born '''Wang Ximeng''' (王希孟) in 1821 in [[Qingzhou]] under the [[Qing Dynasty]]. On account of his orphanhood in very young age, Wang was brought up in his uncle’s family. He had studied Daoism, [[Confucianism]] and [[Buddhism]]. Subsequently, he entered the [[Xiantiandao]] sect under the training of Yao Hetian ({{lang|zh|姚鶴天}}).&lt;ref name="Unity Sect (Yiguan Dao)"/&gt;

After training, Wang returned to Qingzhou and founded his own temple, named '''Dongzhen Hall''' ({{lang|zh|東震堂}}).&lt;ref name="一贯道"&gt;{{cite web|title=一贯道|url=http://www.nciku.com/search/zh/detail/%E4%B8%80%E8%B4%AF%E9%81%93/127731|publisher=nciku Chinese English Dictionary|accessdate=November 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1877, he claimed that [[Wusheng Laomu|God the Mother]] ({{lang|zh|無生老母}} "The Unborn Mother") passed him the [[Mandate of Heaven]], appointing him 15th patriarch of Daoism (with [[Zen]] Patriarch [[Bodhidharma]] as the first such patriarch).

The Xiantian Dao sect under Wang's leadership was significantly [[Confucianism|confucianized]]; practitioners needed to mainly follow the scripture of the [[Great Learning]] whereas Daoist practice such as asceticism and alchemy were cancelled.&lt;ref name="Unity Sect (Yiguan Dao)"/&gt; The sect had been rapidly spread throughout the country until the Qing governmental crackdown against it in 1883. Many followers of Wang, including his son, were killed during this situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Impact of the State on the Evolution of a Sect|url=http://www.baylor.edu/content/services/document.php/37386.pdf|publisher=Baylor University|year=2006|accessdate=November 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zinovia Vasilievna Dushkova''' [[Russian language|Russian]]: Зино́вья Васи́льевна Ду́шкова (born 19 July 1953) is a Russian [[author]], [[poet]], [[philosopher]], and [[historian]]. Dushkova has written approximately 60 books which have been published in both [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]] and translated into seven languages. Dushkova's philosophy is influenced by [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Blavatsky's Theosophy]].

==Life==

Zinovia Dushkova was born on July 19, 1953 in the village of [[Congaz]] in the [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (currently the [[Moldova|Republic of Moldova]]).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who is Who v Rossii: Biograficheskaya entsyklopediya uspeshnykh lyudey Rossii|last=|first=|publisher=Verlag fur Personenenzyklopadien AG|year=2011|isbn=978-3-7290-0101-5|editor-last=Hubner|editor-first=Ralph|location=Zürich|pages=726–727|language=Russian|script-title=Who is Who в России: Биографическая энциклопедия успешных людей России|trans-title=Who is Who in Russia: Biographical Encyclopedia of Successful People in Russia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, Vasily Ivanovich Dushkov (1925–1957), was the chairman of the [[Collective farming|collective farm]] "Russia" in Moldova.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Her mother, Antonina Ivanovna Dushkova (1927–1980), was a [[Surveying|land surveyor]] who participated in geological expeditions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Dushkova's father held a senior position, and for this reason, during Soviet times, he was not permitted to baptize his children.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Velikie Vladyki i Ikh Poslanniki |last=Strel'tsova |first=Lyudmila |publisher=Zadruga|year=2002 |isbn=966-7944-11-5|location=Kiev |pages=672–678 |language=Russian|script-title=Великие Владыки и Их Посланники|trans-title=The Great Lords and Their Messengers}}&lt;/ref&gt; But her grandmother secretly brought the newborn child into a church and had her baptized.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Since during the rite of [[baptism]] there was no one present except a priest and the grandmother, she became Dushkova's godmother and the child was named after her.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; As Dushkova's parents were absorbed in their work, she spent her entire early childhood with her grandmother.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; After her father's death in 1957 from fulminant [[tuberculosis]], her grandmother became fully responsible for Dushkova's upbringing.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; After her grandmother's death in 1964, Dushkova's mother Antonina along with her 11-year old daughter, moved to the village of [[Staroye Sheptakhovo]] in the [[Chuvashia|Chuvash Republic]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kirillova|first=R.|date=March 1, 2007|title=Skazochnitsa v rezidentsii koroley|script-title=Сказочница в резиденции королей|trans-title=The Author of Fairy Tales at the Residence of Kings|url=|journal=Sovetskaya Chuvashiya|language=Russian|volume=|issue=|pages=6|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, Dushkova returned to Moldova, but then moved to work in [[Odessa]], [[Ukraine]], in 1971; from there, in 1972, she moved to the [[Russian Far East]], where she spent the following 27 years.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Uroki Serdtsa|last=Paroshina|first=Raisa|publisher=Astafyev Krasnoyarsk State Pedagogical University|year=2005|isbn=5-85981-131-4|location=Krasnoyarsk|pages=5–6, 59, 234|language=Russian|script-title=Уроки Сердца|trans-title=Lessons of the Heart}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dushkova moved to [[Moscow]] in 1999.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://moldovanews.md/28052017/kultura/152609.htm|title=Kniga urozhenki Gagauzii poluchila serebryanuyu medal' v SShA|last=|first=|date=May 28, 2017|work=Moldova News|access-date=2018-08-08|language=ru-RU|script-title=Книга уроженки Гагаузии получила серебряную медаль в США|trans-title=The Book of a Native of Gagauzia Received a Silver Medal in the USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dushkova had studied the history of [[Christianity]] and the lives of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[Saint|saints]] since early childhood.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Later, while living in Vladivostok, she started to be interested in other world religions such as [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Islam]],&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; and she studied the work of [[Helena Blavatsky]] and [[Helena Roerich]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; As a historian, she also studied the [[Religious text|sacred texts]] in terms of their moral and ethical teachings.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 

This whole experience inspired her to write her first work of fiction, ''Probuzhdenie Istoka'' ("Awakening of the Source"), in 1992.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; There followed [[poetry]] collections and more fiction: ''Melodii Dushi'' ("Melodies of the Soul"), ''Latyn' nevospetaya'' ("Unsung Latin"), ''Grani Sveta'' ("Facets of Light"), ''Preodolenie'' ("Overcoming"), and ''Epopeya'' ("Epopee").&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In 1995 Dushkova took her first trip to India,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; during which she wrote the book ''Bratstvo: Nadzemnaya Obitel''' ("Brotherhood: The Ethereal Abode").&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Work on it began in the study at Helena Roerich's estate in [[Naggar]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; According to the author, it is a continuation of the teaching of ''[[Agni Yoga]]'' and its logical conclusion.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; It is said that, during that trip, Dushkova also met with [[Morya (Theosophy)|Master Morya]] in the Buddhist [[Ghum Monastery|Ghoom Monastery]], where his meetings with Helena Blavatsky and Helena Roerich had presumably taken place before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161106082641/http://spirituality.today/books/leaves-of-maitreyas-garden-the-call-of-the-heart-teaching-of-the-heart-by-zinovia-dushkova|title=Leaves of Maitreya's Garden: The Call of the Heart (Teaching of the Heart) by Zinovia Dushkova - Spirituality Today|last=Morris|first=Peter|date=August 24, 2016|website=Spirituality Today|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally she states that she gained access to the ''[[Book of Dzyan]]'', from which she translated a new fragment from the [[Senzar language]] and published it in ''The Book of Secret Wisdom''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newagejournal.com/2007/do-ancient-tibetan-texts-reveal-earths-future|title=Do Ancient Tibetan Texts Reveal Earth's Future?|last=|first=|date=|website=New Age Journal|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Teaching of the Heart'' and other works===
The most significant work by Dushkova is ''The Teaching of the Heart'', consisting of a series of books which were written while she traveled across India, Russia, [[Egypt]], [[Israel]], and [[Japan]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The series was begun at Helena Roerich's estate in [[Kalimpong]] in October 1997 and its books were later written in places such as the [[Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Bethlehem]], [[Nazareth]], [[Magdala]], [[Mount Carmel]], the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] in Moscow, and Vladivostok.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Other books by Dushkova include ''Ognennaya Bibliya'' ("The Fiery Bible"), ''Evangelie ot Sofii – Sily i Premudrosti Bozhiey'' ("The Gospel of Sophia – the Power and Wisdom of God"), and ''Taynaya Doktrina Lyubvi'' ("The Secret Doctrine of Love").&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; She also wrote books intended for children and youth: ''Skazki dlya Messii'' ("Fairy Tales for the Messiah"), ''Skazki kotorye rastut vmeste s nami'' ("Fairy Tales which Grow Together with Us"), ''77'' ''Zhemchuzhin siyayushchikh na chetkakh Vremeni'' ("77 Pearls Shining on the Beads of Time"), and ''Kniga Pritchey'' ("The Book of Parables").&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paroshina|first=Raisa|date=July–September 2007|title=Vospitanie cheloveka – eto prezhde vsego vospitanie serdtsa...|script-title=«Воспитание человека – это прежде всего воспитание сердца...»|trans-title="The Education of Human Beings is First of All the Education of the Heart..."|url=|journal=Mir nauki, kul'tury i obrazovaniya [The World of Science, Culture, and Education]|language=Russian|volume=|issue=3|pages=79|issn=1991-5497|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2004, Dushkova has ceased to meet with her readers in Russia and Ukraine, having bidden them farewell at the last meeting held in Moscow on March 24,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ya vsegda s vami...|last=Dushkova|first=Zinovia|publisher=Zadruga|year=2006|isbn=966-406-011-9|volume=2|location=Kiev|pages=338|language=Russian|script-title=Я всегда с вами...|trans-title=I am Always with You...}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has focused on trips abroad.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; 

From 2004 to 2016, Dushkova worked on the ''Dialogi'' ("Dialogues") trilogy in which she discusses the inner organization of [[Shambhala]].&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite book|title=30 let s Ucheniem Zhizni|last=Strel'tsova|first=Lyudmila|publisher=K.I.S.|year=2017|isbn=978-617-684-180-7|location=Kiev|pages=82|language=Russian|script-title=30 лет с Учением Жизни|trans-title=30 Years with the Teaching of Life}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first two volumes were published in Russian in 2012, and the third in 2017.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;
== Teachings and ideas==
According to the 12-year&lt;ref name=":122"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sotsiologiya religii v obshchestve Pozdnego Moderna: materialy Tret'yey Mezhdunarodnoy nauchnoy konferentsii|last=|first=|publisher=The National Research University "Belgorod State University"|year=2013|isbn=978-5-9571-0782-8|editor-last=Lebedev|editor-first=S.D.|location=Belgorod|pages=91|language=Russian|script-title=Социология религии в обществе Позднего Модерна: материалы Третьей Международной научной конференции|trans-title=The Sociology of Religion in the Society of Late Modern: Materials of the Third International Scientific Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[research]] by Lyudmila Grigoryeva, the Head of the Department of Religious Studies of Astafyev Krasnoyarsk State Pedagogical University, and Tatyana Simanzhenkova, the teaching of Zinovia Dushkova, being the continuation of the Theosophical tradition and [[occult]]-[[Mysticism|mystical]] in its nature, develops this religious orientation and devises new worldviews of the social and cosmic evolution of humanity in the transitional period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dvizheniye posledovateley ucheniya Rerikhov v sovremennoy Rossii: filosofskiye istoki i tendentsii evolyutsii|last=Simanzhenkova|first=Tat'yana|work=Abstract of PhD dissertation|publisher=Siberian State Technological University|year=2006|isbn=|location=Omsk|pages=15|language=Russian|script-title=Движение последователей учения Рерихов в современной России: философские истоки и тенденции эволюции|trans-title=The Movement of the Followers of the Roerichs' Teaching in Modern Russia: Philosophical Origins and Trends in Evolution}}&lt;/ref&gt; This teaching develops one of the fundamental ideas of the Roerichs' doctrine, outlined in the book ''Heart'' of the ''Agni Yoga'' series, considering it the most important in the modern social and cultural situation.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;Simanzhenkova, Tat'yana (2006). ''Dvizheniye posledovateley ucheniya Rerikhov v sovremennoy Rossii: filosofskiye istoki i tendentsii evolyutsii'' Движение последователей учения Рерихов в современной России: философские истоки и тенденции эволюции [''The Movement of the Followers of the Roerichs' Teaching in Modern Russia: Philosophical Origins and Trends in Evolution'']. PhD dissertation (in Russian). Krasnoyarsk: Siberian State Technological University. pp. 81–86, 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

The study showed that, among a wide variety of teachings in modern Russia and Ukraine, ''The Teaching of the Heart'' is distinguished by its ethical and humanistic orientation, an unusual way of thinking, and a vivid form of exposition.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Primary role of the heart ===
Dushkova identifies the primary role of the heart in the [[spiritual development]] of individuals.&lt;ref name=":92"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paroshina|first=Raisa|date=July–September 2007|title=Vospitanie cheloveka – eto prezhde vsego vospitanie serdtsa...|script-title=«Воспитание человека – это прежде всего воспитание сердца...»|trans-title="The Education of Human Beings is First of All the Education of the Heart..."|url=|journal=Mir nauki, kul'tury i obrazovaniya [The World of Science, Culture, and Education]|language=Russian|volume=|issue=3|pages=79|issn=1991-5497|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of her books have in common the idea of cultivating the qualities of the heart, such as [[love]], [[compassion]], [[mercy]], [[forgiveness]], and [[gratitude]], which, according to the author, contribute to the spiritual and moral formation of the individual.&lt;ref name=":92" /&gt; Her first published book ''Bratstvo: Nadzemnaya Obitel''' formulates this basic idea of the teaching by saying: "Go by the way of the Heart."&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; She believes that "one religion" for modern humanity must be love, and therefore Dushkova's main appeal throughout her books is to "open the heart".&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Unity of all religions ===
The central postulate of the teaching is the idea that there is one divine source of all religions. This idea is presented by Dushkova as a combination of two world religions in three images of the one [[deity]]:&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; "The time of [[Maitreya]], [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], and [[Jesus|Christ]] has come; at their essence, they are One. Three times are merging, erasing the borders between them. The Past has intersected with the Future at point of the Present. The Great Buddha of the North appeared in the Image of Maitreya, bearing the features of the Resurrected Christ."&lt;ref&gt;Dushkova, Zinovia (2000). ''Svyateyshaya Katriosofiya'' &lt;bdi&gt;Святейшая Катриософия [''Sacred Katriosophia''] (&lt;/bdi&gt;in Russian). Moscow: Belyy Ashram. p. 72. {{ISBN|5-8073-0030-0}}. Cited in Simanzhenkova (2006), p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Syncretism|syncretic]] idea is developed in all other Dushkova's writings, as well.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Hierarchy of the heart ===
Continuing the Theosophical tradition, Christ, according to the teaching, is one of the "cosmic hierarchs", who incarnate themselves on the Earth in order to help humanity.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Dushkova develops ''Agni Yoga''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s fundamental idea of "cosmic hierarchy" by introducing the concept of the "hierarchy of the heart" that includes the "heart of infinity", the "heart of the planet", and the "heart of the human being".&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The latter is presented as a "small cell of the heart of infinity", serving as a connecting link between worlds and as the container of the "fire of love".&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Just as in ''Agni Yoga'', [[Great White Brotherhood]] in ''The Teaching of the Heart'' directs the evolution of humanity, preserving society from regression and decay.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Essentially the brotherhood in Dushkova's teaching is the organizing and uniting principle which gives an impulse of high evolutionary frequency that maintains the stability of the social system and establishes the conditions for further improvement.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Fiery baptism ===
As in the [[Eastern philosophy|Eastern tradition]], Dushkova's teaching speaks of the one energy of the Cosmos, Nature, and human beings and relies on the Theosophical version of [[Cosmogenesis]], in which the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]] is seen as the primary fiery energy that during evolution turns into spirit and matter.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; According to the teaching, there are certain historical periods during which this energy, or "spatial fire", is intensified in order to influence the evolution of humanity, bringing matter into a more subtle state; Dushkova calls such periods "fiery baptism".&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

''The Teaching of the Heart'' says it is through the human heart that the evolutionary wave of these transformative fiery energies will pass at the end of the "great cycle", which coincides with present times.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Therefore, according to Dushkova, the primary focus of attention should be shifted to the heart, because it is the "main transmuter" of these energies.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Optimistic future ===
''The Teaching of the Heart'' explains that modern civilization has come to a dividing line in its development when all the quality parameters of life are to change.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Since the human being is involved not only in processes occurring on the Earth, but also in the Cosmos as a whole, Dushkova calls upon people to coordinate their actions with global world processes and to recognize responsibility for every step in life, saying that humanity can proceed further only through love.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Being social and optimistic in nature, the teaching rejects the dramatic concepts of [[End time|the end of the world]] and promotes a more peaceful path to [[salvation]], which occurs through a gradual familiarization with the "divine reality".&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Although [[Natural disaster|natural disasters]] cannot be avoided, they are described as "natural ways of purification", providing the opportunity to establish "a new heaven and a new earth" to be inhabited by a transfigured humanity.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Messianism ===
According to ''The Teaching of the Heart'', the periods of the greatest manifestation of the "spatial fire" are also connected with the beginning of a new "[[Messianic Age|Messianic]]" cycle when Maitreya, the Lord of [[Shambhala]], should arrive in order to unite humanity and to build together a new society after the purification of the Earth.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Mother of the World's era ===
Following the Theosophical tradition, the teaching shows that the coming era will be the era of the "Mother of the World".&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Dushkova presents woman and man as the two cosmic principles that are destined to acquire their equal rights and stand side by side as colleagues.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Reception ==
After its publication in 1998, ''The Teaching of the Heart'' rapidly gained readers in Russia and Ukraine, as well as in Kazakhstan and Moldova,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; marking the beginning of a movement which organized festivals of spiritual culture, exhibitions, musical evenings, and round tables for different types of activity: pedagogical, educational, and artistic.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The first large-scale forum took place in [[Kiev]] in 1999 and was held every year afterward in cities such as [[Cheboksary]], [[Krasnoyarsk]], [[Kemerovo]], and [[Vladivostok]].&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Voronezhskaya|first=Ol'ga|date=September 7, 2002|title=Zakon predpisyvaet lyubit'...|script-title=Закон предписывает любить...|trans-title=The Law Prescribes to Love...|url=|journal=Segodnyashnyaya gazeta|language=Russian|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gusel'nikov|first=Yuriy|date=September 26, 2003|title=Prostranstvo lyubvi|script-title=Пространство любви|trans-title=The Space of Love|url=|journal=Vecherniy Novosibirsk|language=Russian|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2001, in Kemerovo, participants of this movement created ''Zvezda Vostoka'' ("Star of the East"), an interregional public organization for supporting science, culture, and art.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Press Service of the Main Directorate of the Ministry of Justice of Russia for the Kemerovo Region|first=|date=January 31, 2004|title=Vot i vzoshla «Zvezda»: Dukhovnost' pod sen'yu pravovogo kontrolya|script-title=Вот и взошла «Звезда»: Духовность под сенью правового контроля|trans-title=A "Star" has Risen: Spirituality under the Canopy of Legal Control|url=|journal=Kuznetskiy kray|language=Russian|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aimed "to unite all who advocate moral values, who contribute to the evolutionary development of society through cooperation in the domains of science, economics, education, and culture."&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Later, branches of ''Zvezda Vostoka'' were opened in many cities of Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gusel'nikov|first=Yuriy|date=March 4, 2005|title=«Zvezda Vostoka» – prezentatsiya lyubvi|script-title=«Звезда Востока» – презентация любви|trans-title=Zvezda Vostoka – the Presentation of Love|url=|journal=Vecherniy Novosibirsk|language=Russian|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious scholars regarded this organization as one of the three largest centers of [[Rerikhism|Roerichism]] in Russia and Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dvizheniye New Age v Rossii|last=Department of Religious Studies|first=|publisher=Astafyev Krasnoyarsk State Pedagogical University|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=9, 21|language=Russian|script-title=Движение New Age в России|trans-title=New Age Movement in Russia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120520091754/http://religio.rags.ru/religios/6.php|title=Novyye religioznyye dvizheniya|last=Russian Presidential Academy of Public Administration|first=Department of State-Confessional Relations|date=|website=|language=Russian|script-title=Новые религиозные движения|trans-title=New Religious Movements|archive-url=|archive-date=2012-05-20|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sotsiologiya religii v obshchestve Pozdnego Moderna: materialy Tret'yey Mezhdunarodnoy nauchnoy konferentsii|last=|first=|publisher=The National Research University "Belgorod State University"|year=2013|isbn=978-5-9571-0782-8|editor-last=Lebedev|editor-first=S.D.|location=Belgorod|pages=91|language=Russian|script-title=Социология религии в обществе Позднего Модерна: материалы Третьей Международной научной конференции|trans-title=The Sociology of Religion in the Society of Late Modern: Materials of the Third International Scientific Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The followers of ''The Teaching of the Heart'' believe that it, Helena Roerich's ''[[Agni Yoga]]'', and Helena Blavatsky's ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' represent the three parts of the "one [[revelation]]" handed down to humankind by the "[[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom|Masters of Wisdom]]".&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; 

In 2005, [[Viktor Astafyev|Astafyev]] Krasnoyarsk State Pedagogical University published a book intended for teachers, parents, high school students, and professionals in the field of pedagogy and psychology, which recommended ''77 Zhemchuzhin siyayushchikh na chetkakh Vremeni'' for use in education and used excerpts from ''The Teaching of the Heart'' and other Dushkova's books from the standpoint of a person's moral upbringing.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In the same year, [[Mukhtar Auezov|Auezov]] Semipalatinsk University in Kazakhstan published methodological recommendations on using the book and audiobook ''Skazki dlya Messii'' in secondary schools, orphanages, and other children's educational establishments.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Metodicheskiye rekomendatsii k izucheniyu literaturnoy skazki v shkole (na materiale «Skazok dlya Messii» Z.V.

In various cities of Russia and Ukraine, teachers and parents who used ''Skazki dlya Messii'' for reading in orphanages, boarding schools, detention centers, and classrooms noted the positive impact of the tales on the psycho-emotional state of children, especially those who were considered "difficult".&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paroshina|first=Raisa|date=2007|title=Ozbroyity sertsya lybov'yu|script-title=Озброїти серця любов'ю|trans-title=Arming Hearts with Love|url=|journal=Sotsial'na psikhologiya [Social Psychology]|language=Ukrainian|volume=|issue=4|pages=149–156|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paroshina|first=Raisa|date=2007|title=Skazka kak sredstvo vospitaniya serdechnosti|script-title=Cказка как средство воспитания сердечности|trans-title=Fairy Tale as a Tool for Nurturing Cordiality|url=|journal=Aktual'nyye problemy vospitaniya v praktike doshkol'nogo obrazovaniya.

After a competitive selection process in 2006 by the children's and educational publisher Nathan in [[Paris]], ''Le Beau Soleil et autres contes'' ("The Red Sun and Other Fairy Tales"), the French edition of ''Skazki dlya Messii'', was reviewed by the professional magazine for teachers ''Journal des Instituteurs et Professeurs des écoles'' (JDI) with recommendations as to how to use the book in the educational process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=November 2006|title=Le Beau Soleil et autres contes|url=|journal=Journal des instituteurs et des professeurs des écoles|language=French|location=Paris|publisher=Nathan|volume=|pages=38|issn=0246-8298|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; By the decision of the competitive board, packages with 30 copies of the book each were sent to many schools of France.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; During the 2006–2007 academic year the teachers at these schools studied the psychological and pedagogical impact of the fairy tales on their students.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;
== Criticism ==
The [[Russian Orthodox Church]] categorically rejects the teachings of Blavatsky and the Roerichs. In 1994, the Council of Bishops declared that they were "incompatible with Christianity" and people who shared and promoted these teachings had "[[Excommunication|excommunicated]] themselves from the Orthodox Church".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Osvyashchonnyy Arkhiyereyskiy Sobor 29 noyabrya – 2 dekabrya 1994 goda|last=|first=|publisher=Publishing House of the Moscow Patriarchate|year=1995|isbn=|location=Moscow|pages=178|language=Russian|script-title=Освящённый Архиерейский Собор 29 ноября – 2 декабря 1994 года|trans-title=Consecrated Bishops' Council, November 29 – December 2, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patriarchate representatives at a 2004 [[Novosibirsk]] conference once again testified to the "antichristian and destructive nature" of various [[New Age]] teachings, including those of Helena Blavatsky, Helena Roerich, and Zinovia Dushkova.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mezhdunarodnaya konferentsiya "Totalitarnyye sekty i demokraticheskoye gosudarstvo"|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2004|isbn=|location=Novosibirsk|pages=13|language=Russian|script-title=Международная конференция "Тоталитарные секты и демократическое государство"|trans-title=International Conference "Totalitarian Sects and a Democratic State"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, among the followers of the Roerichs' teachings, the publication of ''Bratstvo: Nadzemnaya Obitel''' in 1997&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; also caused [[controversy]] as to whether it came from the same source as ''Agni Yoga''. Thus, Lyudmila Shaposhnikova, the director of the International Center of the Roerichs (ICR) in Moscow, made disparaging remarks on the book and its author,&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; stating that ''Bratstvo'' was given by the "dark forces" because no new teachings would be given "in the next 200 years, as well as in the future".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shaposhnikova|first=Lyudmila|date=1998|title=Pyshnye Olimpy nizshikh sfer|script-title=Пышные Олимпы низших сфер|trans-title=Magnificent Olympuses of the Lowest Spheres|url=|journal=Mir Ognennyy|language=Russian|volume=17|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then the Council of the Siberian Roerich Society, which itself was the former branch of ICR,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rerikhovskoye dvizheniye: aktual'nyye problemy sokhraneniya i zashchity naslediya rerikhov v istoricheskom kontekste|last=Shaposhnikova|first=Lyudmila|work=|publisher=|year=2002|isbn=|location=Moscow|pages=16–17|language=Russian|script-title=Рериховское движение: актуальные проблемы сохранения и защиты наследия рерихов в историческом контексте|trans-title=Roerichism: Actual Problems of Preservation and Protection of the Roerich Heeritage in Historical Context|chapter=Nekotoryye osobennosti sovremennogo rerikhovskogo dvizheniya|script-chapter=Некоторые особенности современного рериховского движения|trans-chapter=Some Specifics of Modern Roerichism}}&lt;/ref&gt; denounced Dushkova as a "false teacher".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Council of the Siberian Roerich Society|first=|date=August 2005|title=Umeyte raspoznat'!|script-title=Умейте распознать!|trans-title=Know How to Recognize!|url=|journal=Voskhod|language=Russian|volume=136|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to these accusations, Dushkova's supporters quoted Helena Roerich's letters in which Roerich herself predicted the appearance of "Agni Yoga in new conditions"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pis'ma|last=Rerikh|first=Elena|publisher=International Center of the Roerichs|year=2009|isbn=978-5-86988-203-5|volume=9|location=Moscow|pages=468|language=Russian|script-title=Письма|trans-title=Letters}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the very end of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ardk.narod.ru/news/lett_ovchin.htm|title=Otkrytoe pis'mo|last=Ovchin|first=Nina|date=September 9, 2004|website=Assotsiatsiya Rerikhovskogo dvizheniya Kemerovo|language=Russian|script-title=Открытое письмо|trans-title=Open Letter|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
