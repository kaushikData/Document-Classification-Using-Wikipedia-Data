The theme of [[adultery]] has been used in a wide range of [[literature]] through the ages, and has served as a theme for some notable works such as ''[[Anna Karenina]]'' and ''[[Madame Bovary]]''. As a theme it brings intense emotions into the foreground, and has consequences for all concerned. It also automatically brings its own conflict, between the people concerned and between sexual desires and a sense of loyalty.

As marriage and family are often regarded as basis of society a story of adultery often shows the conflict between social pressure and individual struggle for happiness. 

According to the American author Tom Perrotta, the novel of adultery is one of the leading 19th century literary tradition in Europe and in the United States. He states that these novels often feature women whose unhappy marriages push them into seeking romance and illicit sex. The main topic of these novels is the rebel-woman who seeks salvation for her unhappy public love-life.

In the [[Bible]], incidents of adultery are present almost from the start. The story of [[Abraham]] contains several incidents and serve as warnings or stories of sin and forgiveness. Abraham attempts to continue his blood line through his wife's maidservant, with consequences that continue through history. [[Jacob]]'s family life is complicated with similar incidents.

The following works of literature have adultery and its consequences as one of their major themes. (M) and (F) stand for ''adulterer'' and ''adulteress'' respectively.

The '''Alta Club''' is a private club in downtown [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]], named for a local mining district. It was founded in 1883, 13 years before Utah's accession as a state. The Alta Club serves as a forum for business development and social interaction, and offers facilities for dining, social events, business meetings, and health and wellness.

The Clubhouse is located at 100 East South Temple.

==History==
By the late 1800s the territory known as Utah had a burgeoning economy. As a result, several affluent groups formed out of the mining and smelting industry. One such group took it upon themselves to create a gentlemen’s social club modeled after the prestigious Union Club of San Francisco. A proposal outlining the club's formation was mailed to prospective members. 

Following recruitment the Alta Club was founded in 1883 by eighty-one charter members, thirteen years before Utah became a state. The club was organized as a social club "to present the comforts and luxuries of a home together with the attraction to its members of meeting each other in a pleasant and social way."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.altaclub.org/Default.aspx?p=DynamicModule&amp;pageid=386318&amp;ssid=305746&amp;vnf=1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foundation===
Although it is widely believed that the founding members only allowed “Gentiles” or those who were not of the Mormon faith to join, that soon changed. Not long after the clubs formation, their resistance to those of the Mormon faith shifted. The first Mormon member was William Jennings, a former mayor of Salt Lake City, joining in 1885. 

The years of [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] brought new challenges to the club. Simon Bamberger, who joined the club in 1904, was one of the Eighteenth Amendment's strongest proponents. However, not everyone in the club shared his vision for a dry state. In the years since its repeal, rumors and stories surfaced telling of the various ways members got their hands on “hooch” and brought it into the club. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.altaclub.org/Default.aspx?p=DynamicModule&amp;pageid=386318&amp;ssid=305746&amp;vnf=1&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 3, 1883, 81 charter members formally signed the Alta Club Articles of Incorporation. An opening ceremony was held in [[Liberty Park (Salt Lake City)|Liberty Park]]. In addition to the 81 charter members, in attendance was [[Wilford Woodruff]], a later president of the [[LDS Church]], and Utah territorial Governor [[Eli H. Murray]]. The club took up its first residence in the Alta Block, located at 21 West 200 South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Alta Club: 1883-1974 |first=O. N. |last=Malmquist |location=Salt Lake City |publisher=Privately published |origyear=1974 |edition=2nd |date=1998 |page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1892, the Alta Club moved to the top floor of the newly constructed [[Dooly Building|Dooly Block]] at 109 West 200 South, which was designed by architect [[Louis Sullivan]] of Chicago (Adler and Sullivan).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jonathan |last=Kland |url=http://saltlakearchitecture.blogspot.com/2009/03/dooly-building.html |title=Dooly Building |date=23 April 2009 |website=Salt Lake Architecture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New clubhouse===
[[Image:AltaClubExterior.jpg|The Alta Club clubhouse in 1900|thumb|right|200px]]
Founded in 1883, the club was originally located in the old Alta Block, midway between Main Street and West Temple on Second South. In 1892, the Club moved to occupy the two top floors of the newly built Dooley Building. The Club remained at this location until June 1898.

Construction of a new clubhouse began in 1897 and was completed in less than a year by builder George Cushing. On June 1, 1898 the new building formally opened. The site selected for the current clubhouse was purchased for $15,000 from Harriet Hooper Young, wife of Willard Young, who was the son of LDS President Brigham Young. The Alta Club building was designed by Frederick Albert Hale in Italian Renaissance style.

In 1910 the East wing was added, almost doubling the size of the original clubhouse. For reasons unknown the original stone could not be matched; old and new stone from a different quarry were mixed in the addition. At that time a new entrance was built on South Temple Street. A stairway was added to the older State Street entrance to provide direct access to the second floor. This became known as the ladies entrance, as women were restricted to the upper floors. 

In 1958 the Club acquired land located on the north side of South Temple Street for a parking lot. In 1993 the addition of a fitness center was completed with the goal of attracting new members. 

In 2001 a $4 million renovation project was completed. A major area of renovation was the third floor, which had not been used since the 1950s due to a fire. The Alta Club’s third floor now boasts twenty elegant guest rooms. The construction of a new parking lot on the south side of South Temple will be completed in 2014.

Ongoing renovations, along with caring membership and staff, maintain what has become one of Salt Lake’s most beautiful and long-lasting buildings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.altaclub.org/Default.aspx?p=DynamicModule&amp;pageid=386320&amp;ssid=305748&amp;vnf=1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Great Depression===
The Great Depression was a difficult time for everyone, including the “rich man’s club.” At one point in 1933, our financial situation became so desperate that the Board decided to entirely waive initiation fees for 90 days, in hopes of encouraging people to join and pay monthly dues. In 1936 the Directors authorized the purchase of two slot machines. This controversial idea helped restore the Club to fiscal health.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.altaclub.org/Default.aspx?p=DynamicModule&amp;pageid=386318&amp;ssid=305746&amp;vnf=1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Present day===
In 1987 the Alta Club welcomed its first non-widow women members. [[Deedee Corradini]], then a Chamber of Commerce executive and later mayor of Salt Lake City; Genevieve Atwood, Utah State Geologist; and Annette P. Cumming, a prominent local philanthropist, became the first female members. In 2008, the Alta Club elected Ceri Jones as their first female president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Alta's New Look |first=Paul |last=Beebe |newspaper=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]] |location=Salt Lake City |date=22 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The Alta Club offers a formal dining room, meeting and social rooms, a bar, a grill, card room, billiards, a member library, 20 guest rooms, a salon, and fitness center. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.altaclub.org/Default.aspx?p=DynamicModule&amp;pageid=386322&amp;ssid=305750&amp;vnf=1&lt;/ref&gt;

Special annual events include: New Year's Reception, Sweethearts Dinner, St. Patricks Day Celebration, Mother's, Father's, and Easter Celebrations, Thanksgiving and Christmas Eve Dinner, and much more.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.altaclub.org/Default.aspx?p=DynamicModule&amp;pageid=386327&amp;ssid=305755&amp;vnf=1&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2879">'''An-Nasir Ahmad''' (died 5 June, 934) was the third [[imam]] of the [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] state in [[Yemen]]. Through his active leadership he confirmed and expanded the polity founded by his two predecessors.

==Early years and succession==

Ahmad bin Yahya was born in [[Medina]] (present-day [[Saudi Arabia]]) as the son of the later imam [[al-Hadi ila'l-Haqq Yahya]] and Fatimah bint Al-Hasan. In 897 he followed his father and his brother Muhammad to Yemen, where al-Hadi was acknowledged as the first imam of the [[Zaydiyya]] branch of [[Shi'a]] [[Islam]] in [[Yemen]]. By 907 he was assisting his father as military commander. After a sojourn in Medina he returned to the Zaidi capital in Yemen, [[Sa'dah]], where he was chosen to succeed his brother [[al-Murtada Muhammad]] in September 913. Al-Murtada had abdicated in 912 under somewhat unclear circumstances, and seemingly supported the appointment of Ahmad. The new imam took the honorific title an-Nasir Ahmad.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia of Islam'', Vol. VII, Leiden 1993, p. 995.&lt;/ref&gt; He was considered an efficacious ruler; one of his adherents composed a panegyric text which described the imam as the one who strengthened Islam after it had become weak.&lt;ref&gt;Ella Landau-Tasseron, 'Zaydi Imams as Restorers of Religion; Ihya and Tajdid in Zaydi Literature', ''Journal of Near Eastern Studies'' 49:3 1990, 256.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fighting the Fatimids==

The long reign of an-Nasir Ahmad was filled with struggles against the adherents of the [[Fatimids]], who also had a strong following in parts of Yemen. The imam gathered troops among the tribesmen of [[Hamdan]], [[Najran]] and [[Khwlan District|Khawlan]] to fight the Fatimid [[da'i]]. In January 920 he met the [[Ismailite]] leader Abd al-Hamid of Jabal Maswar in a three-days battle at Nughash outside [[San'a]]. Abd al-Hamid suffered a disastrous defeat which shattered the Ismailite influence in Yemen irrevocably. After a fairly successful rule, an-Nasir Ahmad died in 934 (or, according to other sources, in 927 or 937).&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia of Islam'', Vol VII, Leiden 1993, p. 996.&lt;/ref&gt; He left six sons, called [[al-Mukhtar al-Qasim]], Isma'il, [[al-Muntakhab al-Hasan]], Ja'far. [[al-Mansur Yahya]], and Ali. Three of these claimed the [[imamate]] after him, and the Zaidi state entered a fairly obscure period.&lt;ref&gt;H.C. Kay, ''Yaman; Its Early Medieval History''. London 1892, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aranmula International Airport''' was an airport project planned to be built at [[Aranmula]], [[Kerala]] in [[India]], at a cost of {{INRConvert|20|b}}. The airport never received the necessary clearances and the project was abandoned. The airport was proposed to be built on about {{convert|700|acres|sqkm}} of land. The controversial project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/kerala/popular-agitation-against-aranmula-airport-enters-400th-day/article4328392.ece | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Popular agitation against Aranmula airport enters 400th day | date=21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; faced strong protest from environmentalists and opposition parties of Kerala. After the Supreme Court of India ratified an order of [[National Green Tribunal]] verdict declaring Aranmula Airport Project in violation of environmental requirements, the Govt of India withdrew its sanction for the Airport. This led to the termination of the project.
The project is now totally discarded. Now this is a dropped project.

==History==
The Kerala government had provided an in principle approval for the airport during the [[Left Democratic Front (Kerala)|Left Democratic Front]] regime in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kerala to go ahead with Aranmula airport|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/kerala-to-go-ahead-with-aranmula-airport-113050800901_1.html|website=Business Standard|accessdate=11 February 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180211081412/http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/kerala-to-go-ahead-with-aranmula-airport-113050800901_1.html|archivedate=11 February 2018|location=Wayback Machine}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the condition that the promoters procure sufficient land on their own. The Central Government gave the green signal for the proposed airport in October 2012 and the project was estimated to be completed within 18 months.&lt;ref name=BL1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/malaysia-airports-to-buy-stake-in-kgs-aranmula-intl-airport/491049/ |title=Green signal for Aranmula airport |publisher=[[The Hindu Business Line]] |date=26 October 2012 |accessdate=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An executive summary of the project including the anticipated environmental impact was prepared by Chennai-based Enviro Care India Pvt. Ltd. and was submitted to the Government of India. However, the Environmental clearance for the project was not granted.&lt;ref name="thehindu_no_nod_for_airport"&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Hindu]]|title=‘No nod for airport plan from MoEF’|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/no-nod-for-airport-plan-from-moef/article4421339.ece|accessdate=27 February 2013|date=16 February 2013|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Legislative Assembly Committee on Environmental Affairs chaired by C P Mohammed MLA found the Airport Project "highly detrimental to the environment"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-in-school/aranmula-airport-centres-decision-criticised/article4444532.ece | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Aranmula airport: Centre's decision criticised | date=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Project met with opposition right from its initial stages from leaders of various streams of society including Social Worker [[Kummanam Rajasekharan]], Poetess-cum-Environmentalist [[Sugathakumari]] and Politician [[V. M. Sudheeran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/sugathakumari-to-lead-stir-against-airport/article4447626.ece | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Sugathakumari to lead stir against airport | date=24 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allegations of discrepancies in awarding clearances through easy processes have been raised, adding to the project's controversies.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; .

[[The Kerala State Biodiversity Board]] submitted a report to the government in March 2013, expressing its reservations over "the land use changes and ecological imbalance that the project will entail"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/aranmula-project-will-affect-ecology-ksbb/article4518577.ece | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | first=T. | last=Nandakumar | title=Aranmula project will affect ecology: KSBB | date=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 April 2013, National Green Tribunal Act granted an interim stay on the project banning any construction at the site. It also stayed the Kerala Government's order to convert the 500 acres of land for industrial purpose until further orders.&lt;ref name="BS9"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/tribunal-grants-interim-stay-on-aranmula-airport-project-113040300006_1.html |title=Tribunal grants interim stay on Aranmula airport project |publisher=[[Business Standard]] |date=3 April 2013 |accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The airport project was given environmental clearance by the Ministry of Environment and Forests, New Delhi on 19 November 2013.

==Status==
The project is now totally discarded. Now this is a dropped project since 2014

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1441">The consumption of '''Cannabis in Costa Rica''' is nominally illegal; however, personal consumption does not carry any criminal penalties. The sale of marijuana, however, can be punished criminally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://extract.suntimes.com/news/10/153/13022/costa-rica-court-says-growing-marijuana-home-not-criminal-offense|title=Landmark ruling upholds de facto marijuana decriminalization in Costa Rica|last=Brosious|first=Emily|date=20 January 2016|accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
Laws in Costa Rica are vague on the topic of the legality of marijuana. According to The Costa Rica News, "The Narcotics Law No. 8204 says that it's illegal to sell and produce marijuana on a big scale. It's also illegal to carry marijuana of more than a small dose. That said, the law doesn’t specify how much marijuana qualifies as a 'small dose' or if it's legal to grow the plant for personal use."&lt;ref&gt;[http://thecostaricanews.com/crime-courts/weed-in-costa-rica/ Marijuana in Costa Rica: Laws, History and Potential]. ''The Costa Rica News''. 18 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Many have interpreted this vagueness in the law to mean personal consumption in small dosages are legal in private areas.

'''Cape Verdeans in the Netherlands''' consist of migrants from [[Cape Verde]] to the [[Netherlands]] and their descendants. {{asof|2010}}, figures from [[Statistics Netherlands]] showed 20,961 people of Cape Verdean origin in the Netherlands (people from Cape Verde, or those with a parent from there).&lt;ref name="Cbs" /&gt;

==Migration history==
Early migration from Cape Verde to the Netherlands began in the 1960s and 1970s. The migrants consisted primarily of young men who had signed on as sailors on Dutch ships, and as such they concentrated primarily in the port city of [[Rotterdam]], especially the Heemraadsplein area. Another wave of migration began in 1975, following [[History of Cape Verde#Post-Independence|the independence of Cape Verde from Portugal]]; this new wave of migrants comprised primarily teachers, soldiers, and other lower officials of the former government. There was an immigration amnesty for Cape Verdean migrants in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Choenni|2004|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1996 to 2010, the number of Cape Verdeans in the Netherlands recorded by Statistics Netherlands grew by roughly 25% from a base of 16,662 people; about three-quarters of the growth in that period was in the 2nd-generation category (people born in the Netherlands to one or two migrant parents from Cape Verde).&lt;ref name="Cbs" /&gt;

==Distribution==
Approximately 90% live in the [[Rotterdam]] metropolitan area.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marc-Montclos|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Rotterdam, the largest concentration live in [[Delfshaven]], where they make up about 8.8% of the borough's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barajas|2003|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city has more than 60 Cape Verdean civil organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Choenni|2004|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller groups can be found in other cities such as [[Schiedam]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Zaanstad]], and [[Delfzijl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Choenni|2004|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Employment and business==
Cape Verdeans generally have better labour market outcomes than other migrant groups like [[Turks in the Netherlands|Turks]] or [[Moroccan-Dutch|Moroccans]], similar to those of [[Surinamese people in the Netherlands|Surinamese]], but worse than those of natives.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Choenni|2004|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The various Cape Verdean-run hair salons of Rotterdam often serve as gathering points for the women of the community.&lt;ref name="Barajas"&gt;{{harvnb|Barajas|2003|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other common ethnic business niches include transport businesses and travel agencies.&lt;ref name="Barajas" /&gt;

In [[Aztec mythology]], '''Centeōtl''' {{IPA-nah|senˈteoːt͡ɬ|}} (also known as '''Centeocihuatl''' or '''Cinteotl''') is the maize deity. ''Cintli'' {{IPA-nah|ˈsint͡ɬi|}} means "dried maize still on the cob" and ''teōtl'' {{IPA-nah|ˈteoːt͡ɬ|}} means "deity".&lt;ref name="dic"&gt;''Nahuatl Dictionary.'' (1997). Wired Humanities Project. University of Oregon. Retrieved September 1, 2012, from [http://whp.uoregon.edu/dictionaries/nahuatl/index.lasso link]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Florentine Codex]],&lt;ref name="Miller" &gt;. Miller, ''The Gods and Symbols of Ancient Mexico and the Maya'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 1993) p62&lt;/ref&gt; Centeotl is the son of the earth goddess, [[Tlazolteotl]] and solar deity [[Piltzintecuhtli]], the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]. Born on the day-sign 1 Xochitl.&lt;ref&gt;Hombres de Maíz. Miguel Angel Asturias p 398&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Codex Vaticanus No. 3773 (Codex Vaticanus B) Eduard Seler p 101&lt;/ref&gt; Another myth claims him as the son of the goddess [[Xochiquetzal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Markman|first=Roberta H., Peter T.|title=The Flayed God: The Mesoamerican Mythological Tradition|year=1994|publisher=Harpercollins|isbn=0-06-250749-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The majority of evidence gathered on Centeotl suggests that he is usually portrayed as a young man (although a debate is still ongoing), with yellow body colouration.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt; Some specialists believe that Centeotl used to be the maize goddess [[Chicomecoatl|Chicomecōātl]]. Centeotl was considered one of the most important deities of the Aztec era. There are many common features that are shown in depictions of Centeotl. For example, there often seems to be maize in his headdress. Another striking trait is the black line passing down his eyebrow, through his cheek and finishing at the bottom of his jaw line. These face markings are similarly and frequently used in the late post-classic depictions of the 'foliated' [[Maya maize god]].

== Controversy ==
According to sources Cinteotl is the god of maize and subsistence&lt;ref name="Cinteotl"&gt;{{cite book|title=Diccionario de Mitología Nahua|editor=Biblioteca Porrúa.

== Worship ==
In the [[Tonalpohualli]] (a 260-day sacred calendar used by many ancient [[Mesoamerican cultures]]), Centeotl is the Lord of the Day for days with number seven and he is the fourth Lord of the Night. In Aztec mythology, maize (which was called Cintli in Nahuatl, the Aztec spoken language) was brought to this world by [[Quetzalcoatl]] and it is associated with the group of stars known commonly today as the [[Pleiades]].&lt;ref name="Centeotl2"&gt;[http://www.azteccalendar.com/god/Centeotl.html Centeotl, the Lord of Maize]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the year (most likely around February time), Aztec workers would plant the young maize. These young maize plants potentially were used as symbolism for a pretty goddess, most likely ''Chicomecōātl'', Princess of the Unripe Maize. ''Chicomecōātl'' is usually depicted carrying fresh maize in her hands, bare-breasted and sitting down in a modest manner. An interesting conflict exists in that some historians believe ''Chicomecōātl'', otherwise known as 'the hairy one' and Centeotl are the same deity. When the seeds were planted, a ritual dance occurred in order to thank Mother Earth and more specifically Centeotl. These dances became increasingly more prominent as the warmth of the sun brought about great prosperity for the Aztecs in the form of sprouting maize canes. This festival has been compared to the more Western maypole festival due to the similarity of their celebrations (dancing for spring, feasting, etc.)&lt;sup&gt;over generalized&lt;/sup&gt;. These festivals were probably very pleasant for the Aztecs, judging by similar festivals in other civilizations&lt;sup&gt;(not an academic comparison)&lt;/sup&gt;. A major custom in Mexico during this festival period was for female Aztecs, regardless of marital status to loosen their ponchos and let down their hair. They would proceed to dance bare-breasted in the maize fields in order to thank Centeotl for his work. Then each female would pick five ears of corn from the field and bring it back in a grand procession while singing and dancing. Women in these processions were the promises of food and life in the Aztec world. Traditionally massive fights would break out as people tried to soak one another in flower pollen or scented maize flour. Also flower petals were thrown in ceremonial fashion over people who were carrying the ears of corn.&lt;ref name="Burland"&gt;C.Burland, ''The Aztecs: Gods and Fate in Ancient Mexico'' (London: Orbis, 1980) p39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Corn was rather essential to Aztec life and thus the importance of Centeotl cannot be overlooked. It can be seen from countless historical sources that a lot of the maize that was cultivated by the Aztecs was used in sacrifices to Gods. Usually at least five newly ripened maize cobs were picked by the older Aztec women. These were then carried on the female’s backs after being carefully wrapped up, somewhat like a mother would wrap up a newborn child. Once the cobs reached their destination, usually outside a house, they were placed in a special corn basket and would stay there until the following year. This was meant to represent the resting of the maize spirits until the next harvesting period came around.&lt;ref name="Burland"/&gt;

These five cobs were also symbols for a seemingly separate goddess.&lt;ref name="Centeotl"/&gt; This highly worshipped goddess was known as Lady Chicomecoatl, Seven Serpents.&lt;ref name="Centeotl"/&gt; She was the earth spirit and the lady of fertility and life, seen as a kind of mother figure in the Aztec world and was the partner of Centeotl.&lt;ref name="Burland"/&gt;

'''Common ownership''' refers to holding the assets of an organization, [[Business|enterprise]] or community indivisibly rather than in the names of the individual members or groups of members as common property.

Forms of common ownership exist in every [[economic system]]. Common ownership of the [[means of production]] is a central goal of [[Communism|communist]] [[Political movement|political movements]] as it is seen as a necessary [[Democracy|democratic]] mechanism for the creation and continued function of a [[communist society]]. Advocates make a distinction between [[collective ownership]] and common property as the former refers to property owned jointly by agreement of a set of colleagues, such as producer [[cooperative]]s, whereas the latter refers to assets that are completely open for access, such as a public park [[commons|freely available to everyone]].&lt;ref&gt;Public Ownership and Common Ownership, Anton Pannekoek, Western Socialist, 1947. Transcribed by Adam Buick.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="commonproperty"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Common Property in Anarcho-Capitalism |last=Holcombe |first=Randall G. |authorlink=Randall G. Holcombe |volume=19 |issue=2 |year=2005 |pages=10 |journal=[[Journal of Libertarian Studies]] |url=https://www.mises.org/journals/jls/19_2/19_2_1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{see also|Communalism}}
While virtually all societies have elements of common ownership, societies have existed where common ownership extended to essentially all possessions. Another term for this arrangement is a "[[gift economy]]" or [[communalism]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} Many [[Nomad|nomadic]] societies effectively practiced common ownership of land. {{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

=== Examples ===
{{expand section|date=March 2018}}

==== Prehistoric ====
[[Marxism|Marxist]] theory (specifically [[Friedrich Engels]]) holds that hunter-gatherer societies practiced a form of [[primitive communism]] as based on common ownership on a subsistence level.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==== By Christian Societies ====
The first church in Jerusalem shared all their money and possessions (Acts of the Apostles 2 and 4).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://biblia.com/bible/nrsv/Acts%202|title=Acts 2:1–47|website=Biblia|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://biblia.com/bible/nrsv/Acts%204|title=Acts 4:1–37|website=Biblia|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by the [[Early Christians]], many Christians have since tried to follow their example of community of goods and common ownership. Common ownership is practiced by some Christian groups such as the [[Hutterite|Hutterites]] (for about 500 years), the [[Bruderhof Communities|Bruderhof]] (for some 100 years) and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ic.org/directory/bruderhof/|title=Bruderhof - Fellowship for Intentional Community|work=Fellowship for Intentional Community|access-date=2017-11-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In those cases, property is generally owned by a charity set up for the purpose of maintaining the members of the religious groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hutterites.org/history/community-of-goods/|title=Community Of Goods|date=2012-02-24|work=Hutterites|access-date=2017-12-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eberhardarnold.com/|title=Eberhard Arnold: Founder of the Bruderhof|website=www.eberhardarnold.com|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Common ownership in capitalist economies ==
{{expand section|date=March 2018}}Common ownership is practised by large numbers of voluntary associations and non-profit organizations as well as implicitly by all public bodies. Most [[co-operatives]] have some element of common ownership, but some part of their capital may be individually owned.

== Marxist theory ==
Many socialist movements advocate the common ownership of the means of production by all of society as an eventual goal to be achieved through the development of the [[productive forces]], although many socialists classify socialism as [[public-ownership]] of the means of production, reserving common ownership for what Karl Marx termed "[[Pure communism|upper-stage communism]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marx|first=Karl|date=|title=Critique of the Gotha Program|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/ch01.htm|journal=Die Neue Zeit|volume=Bd. 1 No. 18|pages=|quote=|via=Marxist internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a Marxist analysis, a society based on a superabundance of goods and common ownership of the means of production would be devoid of classes based on ownership of productive property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Engels|first=Friedrich|date=Spring 1880|title=Socialism: Utopian and Scientific|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch03.htm|journal=Revue Socialiste|volume=|pages=|via=Marxist Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, public or state ownership of industry is seen as a temporary measure to be adopted during the transition from capitalism to socialism, which will eventually be displaced by common ownership as state authority becomes obsolete as class distinctions evaporate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.internationalsocialist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Where-We-Stand-Nov2017.pdf|title=Where We Stand|last=|first=|date=November 2017|website=International Socialist|publisher=International Socialist Organization|pages=20-21|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kcmlm.wordpress.com/2016/07/19/the-midwest-is-red-may-day-announcement-of-the-formation-of-kcrc/|title=The Midwest Is Red: May Day Announcement of the Formation of KCRC|last=|first=|date=1 May 2016|website=Red Guards Kansas City|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2 April 2018|quote=ii)...Because of the transitional nature of socialism and the existence of the state as a marker of irreconcilable differences between classes Maoism also recognized the existence of class struggle under socialism which could be of a low-level of intensity or of a higher one (cultural revolution) but which would exist until the dissolution of classes and the state with it.  iii) In the realm of scientific socialism Maoism is marked by the theory of class struggle and its existence during the dictatorship of the proletariat as well as it’s centrality in the construction of socialism. It is also characterized by the strategy and tactics of the revolution through People’s War led by the revolutionary Communist party of the proletariat, proletarian feminism, the national question, the mass line as well as the classline.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common ownership in a hypothetical [[communist society]] is distinguished from primitive forms of common property that have existed throughout history, such as [[Communalism]] and [[primitive communism]], in that communist common ownership is the outcome of social and technological developments leading to the [[Post-scarcity|elimination of material scarcity]] in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Engels|first=Friedrich|date=|title=The Principles of Communism|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/11/prin-com.htm|journal=Vorwärts|volume=|pages=|via=Marxist Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1918 until 1995 the ''common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange'' was cited in [[Clause IV]] of its constitution as a goal of the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]] and was quoted on the back of its membership cards. The clause read:
:''To secure for the workers by hand or by brain the full fruits of their industry and the most equitable distribution thereof that may be possible upon the basis of the common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange, and the best obtainable system of popular administration and control of each industry or service.''&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Ian (1998). ''Ideology and Politics in Britain Today'' (illustrated, reprint ed.). Manchester University Press. pp. 144–145. {{ISBN|9780719050565}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
[[Neoclassical economics|Neoclassical economic theory]] analyzes common ownership using [[contract theory]]. According to the [[Incomplete contracts|incomplete contracting]] approach pioneered by [[Oliver Hart (economist)|Oliver Hart]] and his co-authors, ownership matters because the owner of an asset has residual control rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grossman|first=Sanford J.|last2=Hart|first2=Oliver D.|date=1986|title=The Costs and Benefits of Ownership: A Theory of Vertical and Lateral Integration|journal=Journal of Political Economy|volume=94|issue=4|pages=691–719|doi=10.1086/261404|jstor=1833199}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hart|first=Oliver|last2=Moore|first2=John|date=1990|title=Property Rights and the Nature of the Firm|journal=Journal of Political Economy|volume=98|issue=6|pages=1119–1158|doi=10.1086/261729|jstor=2937753|citeseerx=10.1.1.472.9089}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the owner can decide what to do with the asset in every contingency not covered by a contract. In particular, an owner has stronger incentives to make relationship-specific investments than a non-owner, so ownership can ameliorate the so-called [[hold-up problem]]. As a result, ownership is a scarce resource that should not be wasted. In particular, a central result of the property rights approach says that joint ownership is suboptimal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Firms, contracts, and financial structure|last=Hart|first=Oliver|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If we start in a situation with joint ownership (where each party has veto power over the use of the asset) and move to a situation in which there is a single owner, the investment incentives of the new owner are improved while the investment incentives of the other parties remain the same. However, in the basic incomplete contracting framework the sub-optimality of joint ownership holds only if the investments are in human capital while joint ownership can be optimal if the investments are in physical capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmitz|first=Patrick W.|date=2013|title=Investments in physical capital, relationship-specificity, and the property rights approach|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165176513001262|journal=Economics Letters|volume=119|issue=3|pages=336–339|doi=10.1016/j.econlet.2013.03.017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, several authors have shown that joint ownership can actually be optimal even if investments are in human capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gattai|first=Valeria|last2=Natale|first2=Piergiovanna|date=2015|title=A New Cinderella Story: Joint Ventures and the Property Rights Theory of the Firm|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/joes.12135/abstract|journal=Journal of Economic Surveys|language=en|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.1111/joes.12135|issn=1467-6419}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, joint ownership can be optimal if the parties are asymmetrically informed,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmitz|first=Patrick W.|date=2008|title=Joint ownership and the hold-up problem under asymmetric information|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165176507003825|journal=Economics Letters|volume=99|issue=3|pages=577–580|doi=10.1016/j.econlet.2007.10.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; if there is a long-term relationship between the parties,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halonen|first=Maija|date=2002|title=Reputation and the Allocation of Ownership|journal=The Economic Journal|volume=112|issue=481|pages=539–558|doi=10.1111/1468-0297.00729|jstor=798519}}&lt;/ref&gt; or if the parties have know-how that they may disclose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosenkranz|first=Stephanie|last2=Schmitz|first2=Patrick W.|date=2003|title=Optimal allocation of ownership rights in dynamic R&amp;D alliances|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899825602005535|journal=Games and Economic Behavior|volume=43|issue=1|pages=153–173|doi=10.1016/S0899-8256(02)00553-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Danau''' (Danaw) is a Mon–Khmer language of Myanmar (Burma). It is the most divergent member of the [[Palaungic languages|Palaungic]] branch (Sidwell 2010). Danau is spoken by about 1,000 people near [[Aungban]], [[Kalaw Township]], [[Shan State]].&lt;ref name=e18/&gt; Danau /dənɔ/ is the Burmese pronunciation of the ethnonym; the Danau themselves pronounce the name of their ethnic group and language as /tʰənɔʔ/. An acceptable variant is /kənɔʔ/. Danau is a tonal language with four tones.&lt;ref&gt;Si, Aung (2014) Danau. In: ''The Handbook of Austroasiatic Languages.'' M. Jenny &amp; P. Sidwell (eds.). pp. 1104-1141. Brill, Leiden.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Danau are a little known ethnic group in Myanmar, and even in the nearby town of Aungban, it is common for people to confuse this group with the local Danu majority. According to historical accounts, the Danu had served as archers for King [[Alaungpaya]], who founded the [[Konbaung Dynasty]] in the 18th century. The Danu settled in the [[Pindaya]] region after returning from wars in Thailand,&lt;ref&gt;http://asiaharvest.org/wp-content/themes/asia/docs/people-groups/Myanmar/Danau.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and speak a variant of Burmese that is characterised by minor differences in pronunciation. The Danau, on the other hand speak a completely different Austroasiatic language, which nevertheless has numerous words borrowed from Burmese (and also ultimately from [[Pali]] via Burmese).

The Danau live primarily in the villages of Taungbohla, Thaethit, Htinyugon, Chaunggya and Naung In, within a short distance of the towns of Aungban and Heho. As these villages are surrounded by [[Pa'O people|Pa'O]] villages, Danau people tend to speak [[Pa'O language|Pa'O]] as well as Burmese. In spite of the small size of the Danau-speaking population, the language is vigorous and being taught to children. The current situation is in contrast to the prediction made by the linguist Gordon H. Luce in 1965, when he called Danau a 'dying' language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Danaw, a dying Austroasiatic language|last = Luce|first = Gordon|date = 1965|journal = Lingua|doi = 10.1016/0024-3841(65)90038-0|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 14|pages = 98–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Danau people are primarily farmers, growing sesame, ginger, chilli, groundnut and potato for local consumption and for sale at nearby markets.

A '''dowry''' is a transfer of parental property, gifts or money at the marriage of a daughter.&lt;ref name=jgoody1976/&gt; Dowry contrasts with the related concepts of [[bride price]] and [[dower]]. While bride price or [[bride service]] is a payment by the [[Bridegroom|groom]] or his family to the bride's parents, dowry is the wealth transferred from the bride's family to the groom or his family, ostensibly for the bride. Similarly, [[dower]] is the property settled on the bride herself, by the groom at the time of marriage, and which remains under her ownership and control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goody |first=Jack |title=Production and Reproduction: A Comparative Study of the Domestic Domain |year=1976 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dowry is an ancient custom, and its existence may well predate records of it. Dowries continue to be expected and demanded as a condition to accept a marriage proposal in some parts of the world, mainly in parts of [[Asia]], [[Northern Africa]] and the [[Balkans]]. In some parts of the world, disputes related to dowry sometimes result in acts of [[violence against women]], including killings and [[acid attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/crossing_continents/3071963.stm|title=BBC NEWS – Programmes – Crossing Continents – India's dowry deaths|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407213904/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/crossing_continents/3071963.stm|archivedate=7 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
A dowry is the transfer of parental property to a daughter at her marriage (i.e. 'inter vivos') rather than at the owner's death (''mortis causa'').&lt;ref name=jgoody1976/&gt; A dowry establishes a type of conjugal fund, the nature of which may vary widely. This fund may provide an element of financial security in widowhood or against a negligent husband, and may eventually go to provide for her children.&lt;ref name=jgoody1976&gt;{{cite book|last=Goody|first=Jack|title=Production and Reproduction: A Comparative Study of the Domestic Domain|year=1976|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dowries may also go toward establishing a marital household, and therefore might include furnishings such as linens and furniture.

Locally, dowry is called ''dahej'' in Hindi, ''varadhachanai'' in Tamil, ''jehaz'' in Urdu and Arabic, ''joutuk '' in Bengali, ''jiazhuang'' in Mandarin, ''çeyiz'' in Turkish, ''dot'' in French,"daijo" in Nepali,&lt;ref&gt;Stevan Harrell and Sara A.

==Origins==
[[File:Aussteuerschrank fcm.jpg|thumb|''Aussteuerschrank'' – a dowry cabinet, currently in a German museum.]]

Anthropologist [[Jack Goody]]'s comparative study of dowry systems around the world utilizing the [[Human Relations Area Files|Ethnographic Atlas]] demonstrated that dowry is a form of inheritance found in the broad swath of [[Eurasia]]n societies from [[Japan]] to [[Ireland]] that practice "diverging devolution", i.e., that transmit property to children of both sexes. This practice differs from the majority of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]n societies that practice "homogenous inheritance" in which property is transmitted only to children of the same sex as the property holder. These latter African societies are characterized by the transmission of the "[[bride price]]," the money, goods or property given by the groom or his family to the parents of the bride (not the bride herself).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goody|first=Jack|title=Production and Reproduction: A Comparative Study of the Domestic Domain|year=1976|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goody has demonstrated a historical correlation between the practices of "diverging devolution" (dowry) and the development of intensive plough agriculture on the one hand, and homogeneous inheritance (brideprice) and extensive hoe agriculture on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goody|first=Jack|title=Production and Reproduction: A Comparative Study of the Domestic Domain|year=1976|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|pages=27–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on the work of [[Ester Boserup]], Goody notes that the sexual division of labour varies in intensive plough agriculture and extensive shifting horticulture. In sparsely populated regions where shifting cultivation takes place, most of the work is done by women. These are the societies that give brideprice. Boserup further associates shifting horticulture with the practice of [[polygamy]], and hence bridewealth is paid as a compensation to her family for the loss of her labour.  In plough agriculture farming is largely men's work; this is where dowry is given.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goody|first=Jack|title=Production and Reproduction: A Comparative Study of the Domestic Domain|year=1976|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, plough agriculture is associated with private property and marriage tends to be monogamous, to keep the property within the nuclear family. Close family are the preferred marriage partners so as to keep property within the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goody|first=Jack|title=Production and Reproduction: A Comparative Study of the Domestic Domain|year=1976|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|pages=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a scholarly debate on Goody's theory. Sylvia Yanagisko argues, for example, that there are a number of societies including parts of Japan, Southern Italy, and China, that do not support Goody's claim that dowry is a form of female inheritance of male property. She notes that Goody's is an evolutionary model in which these historical variables may not be the decisive factors today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yanagisako|first=Sylvia|title=Family and Household: The analysis of domestic groups|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|year=1979|volume=8|pages=171–72|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.08.100179.001113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Mann argues, in contrast, with examples where even in late Imperial China, dowry was a form of female inheritance.&lt;ref name=mann&gt;Mann, S. (2008). Dowry Wealth and Wifely Virtue in Mid-Qing Gentry Households. Late Imperial China, 29(1S), 64–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stanley Tambiah|Stanley J. Tambiah]] (Goody's co-author on the earlier "Bridewealth and Dowry"&lt;ref&gt;(Cambridge University Press, 1973)&lt;/ref&gt;) later argued that Goody's overall thesis remained pertinent in North India, although it required modification to meet local circumstances. He points out that dowry in North India is only partially used as a bride's conjugal fund, and that a large part goes directly to the groom's joint family. This would initially seem to discount Goody's model, except that in North India, the joint family is composed of the groom's parents, his married brothers and unmarried sisters, and their third generation children. This joint family controlled this part of the dowry, which they used to help fund their own daughter/sister's dowries. But when the parents die, and the joint family partitions, this jointly held wealth was then divided among the married sons, such that ultimately, the bride's dowry given to the joint family returned to her and her husband as their "conjugal fund."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tambiah|first=Stanley J.|title=Bridewealth and Dowry Revisited: The posit of women in Sub-Saharan Africa and North India|journal=Current Anthropology|year=1989|volume=30|issue=4|page=426|doi=10.1086/203761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schlegel and Eloul expanded on Goody's model through further statistical analysis of the Ethnographic atlas. They argue that a major factor in determining the type of marriage transaction is the type of property controlled by the household. Bridewealth circulates property and women, and is typical of societies where property is limited. Dowry concentrates property and is found in property owning classes or commercial or landed pastoral peoples. When families give dowry, they not only ensure their daughter's economic security, they also "buy" the best possible husband for her, and son-in-law for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schlegel|first=Alice|author2=Eloul, Rohn|title=Marriage Transactions: Labor, Property, Status|journal=American Anthropologist|year=1988|volume=90|issue=2|pages=291–309|doi=10.1525/aa.1988.90.2.02a00030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical practices==
===Babylon===
Even in the oldest available records, such as the [[Code of Hammurabi]] in ancient [[Babylon]], the dowry is described as an already-existing custom. Daughters did not normally inherit anything from their father's estate. Instead, with marriage, they got a dowry from her parents, which was intended to offer as much lifetime security to the bride as her family could afford.&lt;ref name=jct09&gt;Thompson, James C., [http://www.womenintheancientworld.com/hammurabilawcode.htm Women in Babylonia Under the Hammurabi Law Code] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161125071026/http://www.womenintheancientworld.com/hammurabilawcode.htm |date=2016-11-25 }} Women in the Ancient World (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:The Code of Hammurabi (Harper translation)|The Code of Hammurabi]] Robert Harper Translation (1923)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Babylonia, both bride price and dowry were practiced. However, bride price almost always became part of the dowry.&lt;ref name=jct09/&gt; In case of divorce without reason, a man was required to give his wife the dowry she brought as well as the bride price the husband gave.  The return of dowry could be disputed, if the divorce was for a reason allowed under Babylonian law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/ancient/hamframe.asp The Code of Hammurabi] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20101020002415/http://avalon.law.yale.edu/ancient/hamframe.asp |date=2010-10-20 }}, Translated by L.

King (1915), See Laws 137 through 164, and Laws 178 through 184&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://iws.collin.edu/mbailey/hammurabi's%20code%20overview.htm Hammurabi's Code and Babylonian Law] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515232810/http://iws.collin.edu/mbailey/hammurabi's%20code%20overview.htm |date=2013-05-15 }} Mindi Bailey (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

A wife's dowry was administered by her husband as part of the family assets.  He had no say, however, in its ultimate disposal; and legally, the dowry had to be kept separate for it was expected to support the wife and her children. The wife was entitled to her dowry at her husband's death. If she died childless, her dowry reverted to her family, that is her father if he was alive, otherwise her brothers.  If she had sons, they would share it equally. Her dowry being inheritable only by her own children, not by her husband's children by other women.&lt;ref name=jct09/&gt;

===Ancient Greece===
In archaic [[classical Greece|Greece]], the usual practice was to give a [[bride price]] (''hédnon'' (''ἕδνον'')). Dowries (''pherné'' (''φερνή'')) were exchanged by the later classical period (5th century {{smallcaps|b.c.}}). A husband had certain property rights in his wife's dowry. In addition, the wife might bring to the marriage property of her own, which was not included in the dowry and which was, as a result, hers alone.  This property was "beyond the dowry" (Greek ''parapherna'', the root of [[paraphernalia]]) and is referred to as paraphernal property or [[extra-dotal property]].

A dowry may also have served as a form of protection for the wife against the possibility of ill treatment by her husband and his family,&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Guy Wilson. "Dowry". Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; providing an incentive for the husband not to harm his wife. This would apply in cultures where a dowry was expected to be returned to the bride's family if she died soon after marrying.

In contemporary Greece, dowry was removed from [[family law]] through legal reforms in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/26/world/around-the-world-greece-approves-family-law-changes.html#|title=AROUND THE WORLD; Greece Approves Family Law Changes|last=|first=|date=1983-01-26|work=|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616093929/http://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/26/world/around-the-world-greece-approves-family-law-changes.html|archive-date=16 June 2012|access-date=2016-10-03|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Demos, Vasilikie.

===Roman Empire===
The Romans practiced dowry (''dos'').&lt;ref name=smith1875&gt;William Smith (1875), [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Dos.html Dos], A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, John Murray, London; pp. 436–438&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fm/&gt; The dowry was property transferred by the bride, or on her behalf by anyone else, to the groom or groom's father, at their marriage.

All the property of the wife which was not dowry, or was not a donatio propter nuptias, continued to be her own property, and was called ''Parapherna''.&lt;ref name=smith1875/&gt; The dowry could include any form of property, given or promised at the time of marriage, but only what remained after deducting the debts. Not only the bride's family, any person could donate his property as dowry for the woman.

Two types of dowry were known—''dos profectitia'' and ''dos adventitia''.&lt;ref name=fm&gt;Ferdinand Mackeldey (1883), [https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GeY2AAAAIAAJ Handbook of the Roman law: Volumes 1–2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005011622/https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GeY2AAAAIAAJ |date=2013-10-05 }}, Book III; pp. 419–430&lt;/ref&gt; That dos is profectitia which was given by the father or father's father of the bride. All other dos is adventitia. Roman law also allowed for a species of dowry, called ''dos receptitia'', which was given by some other person than the father or father's father of the bride, in consideration of marriage, but on the condition that it should be restored back to the dowry giver, on the death of the wife. The bride's family were expected to give a dowry when a girl married, and in proportion to their means.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/caecina.shtml#73 M. TVLLI CICERONIS PRO A.

===India===
The practice of dowry in South Asia is a controversial subject. Some scholars believe dowry was practiced in antiquity, but some do not. Historical eyewitness reports (discussed below) suggest dowry in ancient India was insignificant, and daughters had inheritance rights, which by custom were exercised at the time of her marriage. Documentary evidence suggests that at the beginning of 20th century, [[bride price]], rather than dowry was the common custom, which often resulted in poor boys remaining unmarried.&lt;ref&gt;Muni Buddhmal, Terapanth ke Drudhdharmi Shravak Arjunlalji Porwal, Kesrimal ji Surana Abhinanda Granth, 1982, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parwar Directory, Pub.  Singhai Pannalal Raes ed. Pandit Tulsiram, 1924, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Stanley J. Tambiah claims the ancient [[Code of Manu]] sanctioned dowry and bridewealth in ancient India (typically in Rohtak) and especially in [[Kadia (term)|Kadia]] families, but dowry was the more prestigious form and associated with the Brahmanic (priestly) caste. Bridewealth was restricted to the lower castes, who were not allowed to give dowry. He cites two studies from the early 20th century with data to suggest that this pattern of dowry in upper castes and bridewealth in lower castes persisted through the first half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tambiah|first=Stanley|title=Bridewealth and Dowry|year=1973|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge UK|pages=68–69|author2=Goody, Jack}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is more likely that marriages involved both reciprocal gifts between the two families, claims Tambiah, so that insofar as the groom's family gave the bridewealth, it tended to be given back as dowry to the bride as part of her conjugal estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tambiah|first=Stanley|title=Bridewealth and Dowry|year=1973|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge UK|page=71|author2=Goody, Jack}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Witzel]], in contrast, claims the ancient Indian literature suggests dowry practices were not significant during the Vedic period.&lt;ref&gt;Witzel, Michael. "Little Dowry, No Sati: The Lot of Women in the Vedic Period." Journal of South Asia Women Studies 2, no. 4 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; Witzel also notes that women in ancient India had property inheritance rights either by appointment or when they had no brothers.

The findings of MacDonell and Keith are similar to Witzel, and differ from Tambiah; they cite ancient Indian literature suggesting bridewealth was paid even in brahma- and daiva-types of marriage associated with the Brahmanic (priestly) upper caste. Dowry was not infrequent, when the girl suffered from some bodily defect. Property rights for women increased in ancient India, suggest MacDonell and Keith, over the Epics era (200 BC – 700 AD).&lt;ref&gt;MacDonell, Arthur and Keith, Arthur. ''Vedic Index: Names and Subjects'', Indian Text Series (John Murray, London, 1912), Volume 1:482–485 ページ出版&lt;/ref&gt; Kane claims ancient literature suggests bridewealth was paid only in the asura-type of marriage that was considered reprehensible and forbidden by Manu and other ancient Indian scribes. Lochtefeld suggests that religious duties listed by Manu and others, such as 'the bride be richly adorned to celebrate marriage' were ceremonial dress and jewelry along with gifts that were her property, not property demanded by or meant for the groom; Lochtefeld further notes that bridal adornment is not currently considered as dowry in most people's mind.&lt;ref&gt;James G. Lochtefeld, The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|9780823931798}}; 203 ページ出版&lt;/ref&gt;

The above analysis by various scholars is based on interpreting verses of ancient Sanskrit fiction and inconsistent ''[[smriti]]s'' from India, not eyewitness accounts. Available eyewitness observations from ancient India give a different picture. One of these are the eyewitness records from [[Alexander the Great]]'s conquest (''ca''. 300 BC), as recorded by Arrian and Megasthenes. Arrian's first book mentions a lack of dowry,

Arrian's second book similarly notes,

{{Quote box

The two sources suggest dowry was absent, or infrequent enough to be noticed by Arrian.&lt;ref&gt;CV Vaidya, Epic India, Or, India as Described in the Mahabharata and the Ramayana, {{ISBN|978-8120615649}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 1200 years after Arrian's visit, another eyewitness scholar visited India named [[Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī]], also known as Al-Biruni, or Alberonius in Latin. Al-Biruni was an Islamic era Persian scholar who went and lived in India for 16 years from 1017 CE. He translated many Indian texts into Arabic, as well as wrote a memoir on Indian culture and life he observed. Al-Biruni claimed,

{{Quote box
 |quote = The implements of the wedding rejoicings are brought forward. No gift (dower or dowry) is settled between them. The man gives only a present to the wife, as he thinks fit, and a marriage gift in advance, which he has no right to claim back, but the (proposed) wife may give it back to him of her own will (if she does not want to marry).
 |source = [[Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī|Al-Biruni]], ''Chapter on Matrimony in India'', about 1035 AD&lt;ref&gt;Edward Sachau (Translator), Bīrūnī, Muḥammad ibn Aḥmad, Alberuni's India (Vol. 2), Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner &amp; Co. (London, 1910.) Chapter LXIX: 154 ページ出版; see Al-Hind too.&lt;/ref&gt; |width  = 90% |align = center |fontsize=95%}}

Al-Biruni further claims that a daughter, in 11th century India, had legal right to inherit from her father, but only a fourth part of her brother. The daughter took this inheritance amount with her when she married, claimed Al-Biruni, and she had no rights to income from her parents after her marriage or to any additional inheritance after her father's death. If her father died before her marriage, her guardian would first pay off her father's debt, then allocate a fourth of the remaining wealth to her upkeep till she is ready to marry, and then give the rest to her to take with her into her married life.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Sachau (Translator), Bīrūnī, Muḥammad ibn Aḥmad, Alberuni's India (Vol. 2), Trübner &amp; Co. (London, 1910.) Chapter LXXII: 164 ページ出版&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unclear what happened to these daughter's inheritance laws in India after Al-Biruni's visit to India in the 11th century. It is also unclear when, why and how quickly the practice of dowry demand by grooms began, and whether this happened after the arrival of colonialism in the 16th century.

Dowry was common in different historic periods of China and continued through the modern history. Locally called ''Jiàzhuāng'' (嫁妝), the dowry ranged from land, jewelry, money to a collection of clothing, sewing equipment and collection of household items.

Journal of Human Resources, 44(1), 25–46&lt;/ref&gt; find that dowry was a form of inheritance to daughters. In traditional China, the property owned by a family, if any, was earmarked for equal division or inheritance by sons only. Dowry was the only way assets were transferred to a daughter. It included immovable property such as land, and movable property like jewelry and fine clothing. The dowry she brought with her was typically sequestered from the property of her husband and other male members in a joint family. She would often sell this property for cash to overcome hard economic times or needs of her children and husband. In a few cases, she may transfer the property she brought as dowry to her daughter or daughter-in-law. Dowry assets once transferred in turn constituted separate wealth of the woman who received it (''sifang qian'', etc.). Often a woman who brought a large dowry was considered more virtuous in Chinese culture than one who didn't.&lt;ref name=mann/&gt; In parts of China, both dowry and brideprice (''pinjin'') were practiced from ancient eras to the 20th century. Though throughout the history of China, the practice of using a brideprice has largely been used instead of dowries, but has slowly diminished in modern times.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian, B. (2004). The Camera's Positioning: brides, grooms, and their photographers in Taipei's bridal industry. Ethos, 32(2), 140–163.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
Dowry was widely practiced in Europe until the early modern era. Folklorists often interpret the folk tale ''[[Cinderella]]'' as the competition between the stepmother and the stepdaughter for resources, which may include the need to provide a dowry. [[Gioachino Rossini]]'s opera ''[[La Cenerentola]]'' makes this economic basis explicit: Don Magnifico wishes to make his own daughters' dowries larger, to attract a grander match, which is impossible if he must provide a third dowry.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marina Warner]], ''From the Beast to the Blonde: On Fairy Tales And Their Tellers'', pp. 213–14 {{ISBN|0-374-15901-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One common penalty for the [[bride kidnapping|kidnapping]] and [[raptio|rape]] of an unmarried woman was that the abductor or rapist had to provide the woman's dowry. Until the late 20th century this was sometimes called [[wreath money]], or the [[breach of promise]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

[[File:Gentile da Fabriano 063.jpg|thumb|The dowry for the three virgins (Gentile da Fabriano, c. 1425, [[Pinacoteca Vaticana]], Rome), the St. Nicholas legend.]]
Providing dowries for poor women was regarded as a form of charity by wealthier parishioners. The custom of Christmas stockings springs from a legend of [[Nicholas of Myra#Deeds and miracles attributed to Saint Nicholas|St. Nicholas]], in which he threw gold in the stockings of three poor sisters, thus providing for their dowries. St. [[Elizabeth of Portugal]] and St. [[Martin de Porres]] were particularly noted for providing such dowries, and the Archconfraternity of the Annunciation, a Roman charity dedicated to providing dowries, received the entire estate of [[Pope Urban VII]]. In 1425, the Republic of Florence created a public fund, called the ''[[Monte delle doti]]'', to provide dowries to Florentine brides.

Vast inheritances were standard as dowries for aristocratic and royal brides in Europe during the Middle Ages. The Portuguese crown gave two cities in India and Morocco as dowry to the British Crown in 1661 when King [[Charles II of England]] married [[Catherine of Braganza]], a princess of Portugal.

In some cases, [[nun]]s were required to bring a dowry when joining a [[convent]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04340c.htm Convent] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101102013510/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04340c.htm |date=2010-11-02 }}", ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]''&lt;/ref&gt; At some times, such as [[Ancien Régime]] France, convents were also used by some parents to put less attractive daughters, so that the more marriageable daughters could have larger dowries.&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Auchincloss]], ''False Dawn'', p. 42 {{ISBN|0-385-18021-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancien Régime families that could not provide proper dowries also used the convents as places to put their daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Auchincloss, ''False Dawn'', p. 48 {{ISBN|0-385-18021-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[County of Bentheim]], for instance, parents who had no sons might give a land dowry to their new son-in-law. It was commonly given with the condition that he take the surname of his bride, in order to continue the family name.
====England====
Dowry was used in England, however, the right of daughters to inherit and of women to hold property and other rights in their own name made it a different instrument than on the Continent.   The [[Salic law]], which required females to be disinherited and disenfranchised from land ownership, did not apply in England.  Single women held many rights men did.  The most famous example of this English female inheritance and agency right is perhaps [[Elizabeth I of England]], who held all rights a male monarch did.  

While single women held rights to hold property equivalent to those of men, marriage and married women were affected by the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]] changes to the law in the 12th Century.   [[Coverture]] was introduced to the common law in some jurisdictions, requiring property of a wife to be held in the husband's name, custody and control.  The Normans also introduced the dowry in England replacing the earlier custom of the new husband giving a morning gift to his bride.  At first the husband publicly gave &lt;sup&gt;''[or received?]''&lt;/sup&gt; the dowry at the church door at the wedding.  

If the husband died, which was frequent, there was a Widows dowry of one third of the husband's lands at the time of his marriage; the income, and in some cases, the management, of the lands, was assigned to her for the rest of her life.  This concept is included in the [[Great Charter]], and along with the recognition of female inheritance and absence of the [[Salic law]], and women, particularly single women, holding many rights equivalent to those men held, manifests English law differing fundamentally from the law of the Continent, especially the law of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].    

Thirteenth-century court records are filled with disputes over dowries, and the law became increasingly complex.&lt;ref&gt; S. H. Steinberg et al. eds. ''A New Dictionary of British History'' (1963) pp. 110–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The English dowry system permitted most noble families to marry off their daughters and thereby gain extended kin and patronage ties. Marriageable daughters were a valuable commodity to ambitious fathers, and the English aristocracy sent few of their eligible daughters to convents.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara J. Harris, "A new look at the Reformation: Aristocratic women and nunneries, 1450–1540." ''Journal of British Studies'' 32.2 (1993): 89–113. &lt;/ref&gt;

Failure to provide a customary, or agreed-upon, dowry could cause a marriage to be called off. [[William Shakespeare]] made use of such an event in ''[[King Lear]]'': one of Cordelia's suitors gives up his suit upon hearing that King Lear will give her no dowry. In ''[[Measure for Measure]]'', Claudio and Juliet's premarital sex was brought about by their families' wrangling over dowry after the betrothal. Angelo's motive for forswearing his betrothal with Mariana was the loss of her dowry at sea.

In [[Victorian England]], dowries were viewed by some members of the upper class as an early payment of the daughter's [[inheritance]]. In some instances, daughters who had not received their dowries were the only female heirs entitled to part of the estate when their parents died. If a couple died without children, a woman's dowry was often returned to her family.&lt;ref&gt;Gail MacColl and Carol McD. Wallace, ''To Marry An English Lord'', pp. 166–67, {{ISBN|0-89480-939-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Coverture]] never applied universally in Britain and was repealed in the 1800s.  This effectively ended the concept of dowry as the property of a single woman was either retained by her after marriage or its income became marital property under joint control with a husband (not under his sole control as in coverture).

====Russia====
[[File:Wassilij Wladimirowitsch Pukirew 001.jpg|thumb|''The Dowry'' by 19th century Russian painter, Vasili Pukirev. Dowry was a common practice in Russia through the 19th century.]]
In some parts of Europe, especially Eastern Europe, land dowries were common. 

The [[Domostroy]], a Russian advice book of the 16th century for upper classes, includes advice to set aside property for purposes of a dowry, and use it to accumulate linens, clothing, and other things for it, rather than have to suddenly buy it all for the wedding; if the daughter should happen to die, the dowry should be used to give alms and for prayers for her soul, although some might be set aside for other daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn Johnston Pouncey, ''The Domostroi: Rules for Russian Households in the Time of Ivan the Terrible'', p. 95 {{ISBN|0-8014-9689-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsarist Russia]] the dowry originally consisted of clothing for the bride, linen, and bedding.&lt;ref name="Tian-Shanskaia1"&gt;Olga Semyonova Tian-Shanskaia, ''Village Life in Late Tsarist Russia'', pp. 3–4, 1993, Indiana University Press, Bloomington and Indianapolis.&lt;/ref&gt; Linen became less common, a fact blamed on poor flax harvest and girls being poor spinners, but emphasis was added to the finest of the clothing, and a money dowry was sometimes added, particularly if the bride was regarded as having some fault.&lt;ref name="Tian-Shanskaia1"/&gt; Prospective in-laws, usually concerned mostly with her working ability, grew more concerned about a money dowry.&lt;ref name="Tian-Shanskaia2"&gt;Olga Semyonova Tian-Shanskaia, ''Village Life in Late Tsarist Russia'', p. 66, 1993, Indiana University Press, Bloomington and Indianapolis&lt;/ref&gt;

====Romania====
In Romania in the late 18th and early 19th centuries (1750–1830s) the exclusion of dowered girls from the family inheritance led to increased cohesion within the nuclear family.  The wife's male relatives controlled the dowry but she retained sole ownership of the dowry and wedding gifts. Her relatives could prosecute the husband for squandering a dowry; wives gained some ability to leave an abusive marriage. The long-term result was a greater legal empowerment of women, while providing economic security to divorced women, widows, and children.&lt;ref&gt; Angela Jianu,  "Women, Dowries, and Patrimonial Law in Old Regime Romania (c. 1750–1830)." ''Journal of family history'' 34.2 (2009): 189–205.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Americas===

====Indigenous cultures====
According to one ethnographic study of indigenous cultures worldwide, around six percent of North American indigenous cultures practised reciprocal exchange, involving the giving of gifts between both the bride and groom's families.&lt;ref name="Ferraro, Gary P., and Susan Andreatta 2009 224"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ferraro, Gary P. |author2=Susan Andreatta|title=Cultural Anthropology: An Applied Perspective|year=2009|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=9780495601920|page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the tribes of the American Plains, a combination of [[dower]] and dowry was used. The groom would give a gift of horses to the bride's parents, while they in turn would give a gift to the groom. The exchange was somewhat reciprocal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Deogaonkar|first=S. G.|title=Native Americans And Native Indians|year=2002|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|isbn=9788170229094|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mexico====
Spanish colonists brought the dowry custom to Mexico. Spain's laws gave brides the right to control their dowry after marriage, contrary to the usual European practice of transferring the dowry to the control of the groom and his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mangan|first=Jane E.|title=Trading Roles: Gender, Ethnicity, and the Urban Economy in Colonial Potosí|year=2005|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=9780822334705|page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women, in practice, often did maintain control over their dowry after marriage. The husband might be given funds from the dowry to invest for the mutual benefit of the couple and their children, but wives also often used funds from their dowries to operate their own businesses, as grocers, tavern keepers, and shop owners in urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mangan|first=Jane E.|title=Trading Roles: Gender, Ethnicity, and the Urban Economy in Colonial Potosí|year=2005|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=9780822334705|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dowries were a common custom in the early colonial years, but were passing out of use by the mid-18th century. By that time, less wealthy daughters were often marrying without any dowry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Socolow|first=Susan Migden|title=The Women of Colonial Latin America|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521476423|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New France====
The French government made efforts to encourage marriage for the male soldiers and traders in New France by granting dowries to women willing to travel to the colony at Quebec. As the French crown provided dowries for many of the women persuaded to travel to [[New France]] for marriages and settlement there, they were known as ''[[filles du roi]]'' (daughters of the king).

Convents in Quebec, as in Europe, required a dowry from the parents of girls becoming nuns, much as the dowry was expected in the marriages of upper class brides. The Catholic Church intended for this requirement to be used to maintain some control over the new members of religious communities. Girls without a dowry were often supported by benefactors, however, and occasionally convents lowered the sum required to enter the convent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women and Freedom in Early America|year=1997|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=9780814721988|page=116|editor=Larry D.

The 15th-century painting relates to the story of a poor man with three daughters. In those days a young woman's father had to offer prospective husbands a dowry. Without a dowry, a woman was unlikely to marry. Mysteriously, on three occasions, so goes the story, a bag of gold appeared in their home, for the dowries, courtesy of St Nicholas. Later, St Nicholas came to be known as Santa Claus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stnicholascenter.org/pages/who-is-st-nicholas/ Who is St. Nicholas?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911183613/http://www.stnicholascenter.org/pages/who-is-st-nicholas/ |date=2012-09-11 }} St Nicholas Center&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The dowry was a custom brought to the United States by colonists from England and elsewhere in Europe. One legend tells how [[John Hull (merchant)|John Hull]], the Master of the Mint in [[Boston]] and a wealthy man, determined the dowry for his daughter Hannah's marriage to Samuel Sewall. Hull is said to have set his 18-year-old daughter onto one side of the large scales in his warehouse. He piled shillings into the other side of the scale until he reached her weight in silver, and that was her dowry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Archaeologia Americana: transactions and collections of the American Antiquarian Society, Volume 3|year=1857|publisher=American Antiquarian Society, digitized by University of Wisconsin at Madison|pages=274–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dowry system existed in certain Native American tribes. An example is found in the marriage of Virginia settler [[John Rolfe]] to [[Pocahontas]], who brought a dowry to the marriage that included a large amount of land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mirza|first=Rocky M.|title=The Rise and Fall of the American Empire: A Re-Interpretation of History, Economics and Philosophy: 1492–2006|year=2007|publisher=Trafford Publishing|isbn=9781425113834|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The daughters of wealthy 19th century industrialists, who were able to inherit large amounts of money and property, were given "dowries" by their fathers to marry European aristocrats who held a title but had little wealth. The mutual exchange of title and wealth raised the status of both bride and groom.&lt;ref name="Ferraro, Gary P., and Susan Andreatta 2009 224"/&gt;

====Brazil====
The dowry was a custom brought to Brazil by Portuguese settlers. Colonial economics meant that families had a great stake in inheritances of land in particular. As in Europe, the eldest daughter was usually granted the largest dowry by her father. Variations were not unusual, however, as research has shown in São Paulo, 31% of fathers gave dowries of increasing size to the younger daughters, and 21% distributed dowries with no particular favour shown to birth order of the daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nazzari|first=Muriel|title=Disappearance of the Dowry: Women, Families, and Social Change in São Paulo, Brazil (1600–1900)|year=1991|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=9780804719285|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to dowries, daughters could also be granted an inheritance from their father, a share of the ''legìtima''. Inheritance laws were complex in colonial Brazil. According to Portuguese law, an estate was to be divided among children who had not already received a dowry. In the early colonial period, married daughters receiving a large dowry would refuse to accept a further inheritance after the death of their father. In the 18th century, as inheritances and dowries gradually became smaller, this custom disappeared. Daughters accepted a dowry, plus a ''legìtima.'' In this way, they folded their dowry back into the estate with the ''legìtima'', called bringing the dowry ''à colação''. The remaining third of the estate, the ''terça'', was free for the father to divide as he wished among his heirs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nazzari|first=Muriel|title=Disappearance of the Dowry: Women, Families, and Social Change in São Paulo, Brazil (1600–1900)|year=1991|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=9780804719285|pages=65–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were instances where a daughter was left to marry without a dowry, whereas her sisters were given dowries, an indication of paternal control over marriage choices. During the 18th century, as inheritances decreased in size, litigation among siblings became more common. Dowries could include land, a house in the city, cash, gold dust, gold bars, tools and machinery, cattle, or horses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nazzari|first=Muriel|title=Disappearance of the Dowry: Women, Families, and Social Change in São Paulo, Brazil (1600–1900)|year=1991|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=9780804719285|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 19th century, economic changes meant that men, typically merchants, brought more to the marriage materially, and the economic dynamics of marriage changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nazzari|first=Muriel|title=Disappearance of the Dowry: Women, Families, and Social Change in São Paulo, Brazil (1600–1900)|year=1991|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=9780804719285|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current practices==
Dowry is a common practice in many parts of the world, especially in [[South Asia]] and several [[MENA|Middle East and North Africa]] countries. Dowry is most common in nations with inadequate male-biased inheritance laws and [[patrilineal]] societies, which expect women to live with or near their husband's family.&lt;ref name="Van Willigen 1991 pp. 369–377"&gt;Van Willigen, J., &amp; Channa, V. C. (1991). Law, custom, and crimes against women: The problem of dowry death in India. Human organization, 50(4), pp. 369–377&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dalmia, S. 2005 pp. 71–93"&gt;Dalmia, S., &amp; Lawrence, P. G. (2005). The institution of dowry in India: Why it continues to prevail. The Journal of Developing Areas, 38(2), pp. 71–93.&lt;/ref&gt; 
An unusual exception to the dowry custom in South Asia is found in [[Bhutan]]. The dowry system does not exist in Bhutan; inheritance is [[matrilineal]], and daughters do not take their father's name at birth, nor their husband's name upon marriage. Rural land may be registered in a woman's name. Women own businesses, and both [[polyandry]] and [[polygyny]] are socially accepted, with polygyny being more prevalent. Sometimes a prospective groom will work in the bride's family's household to earn the right to marry her.&lt;ref name="Stange, Mary Zeiss, and Carol K. Oyster, Jane E. Sloan 2011 149"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stange, Mary Zeiss |author2= Carol K. Oyster |author3=Jane E.

===India===
{{Main article|Dowry system in India}}
In India, dowry is called ''Dahej'' in Hindi, and ''Jahez'' in Arabic (derived from Islamic ''jahez-e-fatimi'').&lt;ref name=Waheed&gt;{{cite journal | last = Waheed | first = Abdul | title = Dowry among Indian muslims: ideals and practices | journal = [[Indian Journal of Gender Studies]] | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 47–75 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/097152150801600103 | date = February 2009 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In far eastern parts of India, dowry is called ''Aaunnpot''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ali | first = Maqbul | title = Pangal women: social challenges and education | journal = International Organization of Scientific Research – Journal of Humanities and Social Science (IOSR-JHSS) | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 39–42 | publisher = International Organization of Scientific Research (IOSR) | doi = 10.1177/097152150801600103 | date = March 2013 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dowry is a payment of cash or gifts from the bride's family to the bridegroom's family upon marriage. It may include cash, jewellery, electrical appliances, furniture, bedding, crockery, utensils, car and other household items that help the newly-weds set up their home.

In India, the dowry system puts great financial strain on the bride's family. Payment of dowry is now prohibited under the [[Dowry system in India#Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961|Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961]] in [[Law of India|Indian civil law]] and subsequently by Sections 304B and 498a of the [[Indian Penal Code]] (IPC). Despite anti-dowry laws in India, it is still a common illegal practice. Other laws attempting to address the problem include the ''Dowry and Bridal Gifts Restrictions Rules, 1976'' and the ''Dowry Prohibition (Maintenance of Lists of Presents to the Bride and Bridegroom) Rules, 1985'', which are intended to document gifts and provide complainants with stronger evidence in the event that prosecution for crimes against the bride occurs later.

Dowry in India is not limited to Hindus or any specific religion. It is widespread. For example, Indian Muslims call dowry as ''jahez'', justify the practice in terms of jahez-e-fatimi. Islamists classify jahez into two categories: The first comprises some essential articles for the outfit of the bride as well as for conjugal life. The other is made up of valuable goods, clothes, jewelry, an amount of money for the groom's family, which is settled on after bargaining. The ''jahez'' often far exceeds the cost of the ''[[baraat]]'' and marriage parties. The ''jahez'' is separate from cash payment as ''[[Mahr]]'' or dower that Sharia religious law requires.&lt;ref name=Waheed /&gt;

Although Indian laws against dowries have been in effect for decades, they have been largely criticised as being ineffective.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Practical Steps towards Eliminating Dowry and Bride-Burning in India|last = Manchandia|first = Purna|journal = Tul.

Dowry-murder persists. It is the killing of a wife for not bringing sufficient dowry to the marriage. It is the culmination of a series of prior domestic abuses by the husband's family.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Rudd, "Dowry-murder: An example of violence against women."

===Bangladesh===
The original custom in Bangladesh was the [[bride price]], called ''pawn'', where the groom's family makes a payment to the bride's parents. This has gradually been replaced by the dowry, called ''joutuk''. This transition in customs began in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Gavin W.|title=The Continuing Demographic Transition|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198292579|pages=290–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 21st century, the bride price has been supplanted by the dowry. ''Joutuk'', sometimes spelled ''Joutukh'', like elsewhere in South Asia, is a serious and growing problem in Bangladesh. Between 0.6 and 2.8 brides per year per 100,000 women are reported to die because of dowry-related violence.&lt;ref&gt;Shahnaz Huda (2006), [http://sar.sagepub.com/content/26/3/249.short Dowry in Bangladesh: Compromizing {{sic|hide=yes}} Women's Rights] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426235719/http://sar.sagepub.com/content/26/3/249.short |date=2015-04-26 }}, ''South Asia Research'', November vol. 26 no. 3, pp. 249–268. {{doi|10.1177/0262728006071707}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhakacourier.com.bd/?p=4592 Women’s Safety: Ghosts on the Prowl] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109202405/http://www.dhakacourier.com.bd/?p=4592 |date=November 9, 2014 }} Mahfuzur Rahman, Dhaka Courier, January 26, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Bangladesh has seen a rise in the expected size of dowries in recent decades, as its middle class has grown. Sociologist Sarah White has argued that the dowry is not compensation for weakness in women's economic contribution. Instead its main function is now to support family advancement by mobilizing additional resources. It also demonstrates an ongoing commitment to the norms of masculine provision and protection. Dowries make women more valuable, which pushes against the background of widespread corruption and political and gender violence.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah C.

A negative factor is the rise in the rate of "dowry deaths". In Bangladesh, dowry killings are more frequently done by stabbing or poison rather than burning. Dowry extortion is also a problem in Bangladesh.&lt;ref name="Menski 1998 109"&gt;{{cite book|last=Menski|first=Werner|title=South Asians and the Dowry Problem|year=1998|publisher=Trentham Books|isbn=9781858561417|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; From January to October 2009, more than 3,413 complaints were made to the police in Bangladesh concerning beatings and other abuses related to dowries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Annual Report: Bangladesh 2010|year=2010|publisher=Amnesty International|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/research/reports/annual-report-bangladesh-2010?page=2|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604140126/http://www.amnestyusa.org/research/reports/annual-report-bangladesh-2010?page=2|archivedate=2012-06-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the methods used by families who are unhappy with dowry includes [[acid throwing]], in which concentrated acid is thrown on the bride's face to cause disfiguration and social isolation. From 1995 to 1998, 15 women reported dowry disputes as the motivation behind acid attacks, though that number may be low due to underreporting.&lt;ref&gt;International Women's Rights Action Watch Asia Pacific. ''Baseline Report: Violence Against Women in Bangladesh''. 1–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Bangladesh is combating the problem with legislation largely copied from that of India. Laws prohibiting dowry in Bangladesh include ''Dowry Prohibition Act, 1980''; ''Dowry Prohibition (Amendment) Ordinance, 1982''; and ''Dowry Prohibition (Amendment) Ordinance, 1986''.

Dowry Prohibition Act Clause 4 states that any one demanding Dowry from a person has committed a crime. The law does not have any clause stating punishment to misuse it. Therefore, the law is frequently used by women to harass in-laws and husbands.&lt;ref name="News article on Dowry Law Abuse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.priyo.com/law-and-order/2011/feb/16/women-repression-dowry-law-nee-20016.html|title=Women repression, dowry: Law needs changes to check false cases|work=Priyo News|accessdate=20 April 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305113129/http://news.priyo.com/law-and-order/2011/feb/16/women-repression-dowry-law-nee-20016.html|archivedate=5 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pakistan===

Journal of Biosocial Science, 31(4), 449–461&lt;/ref&gt; At over 2000 dowry-related deaths per year, and annual rates exceeding 2.45 deaths per 100,000 women from dowry-related violence, Pakistan has the highest reported number of dowry death rates per 100,000 women in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/4e4213da2.pdf Operational Note: Pakistan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925131251/http://refworld.org/pdfid/4e4213da2.pdf |date=2013-09-25 }} Refworld, A United Nations initiative (August 2011), pp.&amp;nbsp;16–21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/21365/|title=To estimate an equation explaining the determinants of Dowry|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604225424/https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/21365/|archivedate=4 June 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ansari,&lt;ref&gt;Ansari, A. S. Bazmee (1978) "Is Dowry Obligatory?", Hamdard Islamicus, 1(2):78–84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Masrat Musavi, Fatima – The Ideal Model for Women of All Times, Imam Reza (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan's Muslim community considers dowry as an obligatory Islamic practice. They cite [[sunnah]] of the Prophet to justify the practice of giving dowry as well as receiving dower (Mahr); the Prophet gave items as dowry to his daughter Fatima at her marriage to Ali; and as second sunnah, the marriage of Zainab—another daughter of the Prophet—is mentioned, who received expensive jewelry from her family at the time of her marriage. Over 95 percent of all marriages in Pakistan involves transfer of a dowry from the bride's family to groom's family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popcouncil.org/pdfs/ayp0102.pdf Adolescents and Youth in Pakistan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312003405/http://www.popcouncil.org/pdfs/ayp0102.pdf |date=2014-03-12 }} Zeba Sathar, Cynthia Lloyd, et al., Population Council, with support from UNICEF; pp. 92–116&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 [[Gallup International Association|Gallup]] survey in Pakistan found that 84% of Pakistanis believe that dowry plays either very important or somewhat important role in marriage, while 69% believed it is not possible for a girl to get married without a dowry.&lt;ref&gt;"Tradition of dowry in Pakistan: 56% Pakistanis believe it is impossible for girls to get married without dowry" [http://gallup.com.pk/tradition-of-dowry-in-pakistan-56-pakistanis-believe-it-is-impossible-for-girls-to-get-married-without-dowry/ ''Gilani Research Foundation Polls,'' 17 Jan. 2017] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180325050410/http://gallup.com.pk/tradition-of-dowry-in-pakistan-56-pakistanis-believe-it-is-impossible-for-girls-to-get-married-without-dowry/ |date=2018-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pakistan has seen a rise in the values of dowries in recent decades, as in other South Asian countries.&lt;ref name="Menski 1998 109"/&gt; However, in Pakistan it is still expected that a bride will bring some kind of dowry with her to a marriage, whether she is Muslim, Hindu, or Christian.&lt;ref name="Walbridge 2003 134"&gt;{{cite book|last=Walbridge|first=Linda S.|title=The Christians of Pakistan: The Passion of Bishop John Joseph|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780700716562|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dower]] ([[bride price]]), called ''[[mahr]]'', and dowry, called ''jahaiz'', are both customs with long histories in Pakistan.

Control of the dowry belongs to the bride in theory, although in practice control often transfers to the husband and in-laws, and grooms sometimes extort large dowries. In rural Pakistan, dowry values are still relatively low, around 12 percent of a household's annual (non-durable goods) expenses. Also, in rural Pakistan it is standard for the bride to maintain control over her dowry after marriage, rather than control of the dowry being given to the in-laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bride Exchange and Women's Welfare in Rural Pakistan|publisher=World Bank Publications|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent survey in January 2017 by Gallup Pakistan showed that 56 percent of the population expects the girl to bring dowry to marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.globalvillagespace.com/improving-female-conditions-depends-outlawing-dowry/|title=Why Improving female conditions depends on outlawing dowry|date=2017-01-18|work=Global Village Space|access-date=2018-02-09|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180210003122/https://www.globalvillagespace.com/improving-female-conditions-depends-outlawing-dowry/|archivedate=2018-02-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;The pressure among some Pakistanis to provide a large dowry results in some brides' families going into debt, including debt servitude; some brides build up their dowry with their own earnings if they work outside the home.&lt;ref name="Walbridge 2003 134"/&gt; The debt trap created by providing large dowries puts pressure on parents aspiring to arrange a marriage for their daughter(s) into a better social class. It is also cited as a reason for the current trend toward delayed marriages. Arranged marriages among first cousins are common, since they provide a way of keeping dowries within an extended family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Singh, Sarina |author2= Lindsay Brown |author3= Paul Clammer |author4=Rodney Cocks |author5= John Mock |title=Pakistan and the Karakoram Highway|year=2008|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=9781741045420|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pakistan has passed several laws to address the problem of excessive dowry demands: ''West Pakistan Dowry (Prohibition of Display) Act, 1967''; ''Dowry and Bridal Gifts (Restriction) Act, 1976''. Women's rights to inheritance separate from the dowry are offered some protection in the ''Muslim Personal Law of Shariat of 1948'' and the ''Muslim Family Laws Ordinance of 1961''.&lt;ref name="Esposito, John L. and Natana J.

===Nepal===
The practice of dowry is common in Nepal, and dowry-related violence is increasingly becoming a problem. As a result, the dowry system has been banned in Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://southasia.oneworld.net/todaysheadlines/nepal-bans-dowry-caste-based-discrimination|title=Nepal bans dowry, caste-based discrimination|work=OWSA|accessdate=20 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20151201083902/http://southasia.oneworld.net/todaysheadlines/nepal-bans-dowry-caste-based-discrimination|archivedate=1 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the laws, the violent incidents continue, under a general perception of impunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Asia/Story/A1Story20110617-284657.html|title=Dowry deaths on the rise in Nepal|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030125/http://news.asiaone.com/News/Latest+News/Asia/Story/A1Story20110617-284657.html|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nepali people]] of the [[Madhesi people|Madhesi society]] still freely welcome dowry as a right to the groom's side. Even highly educated people living in the [[Terai]] of Nepal accept dowry without any second thoughts. Parents have thus started dreading the birth of daughters in the family, going as far as [[sex selection|determining the sex of fetuses]] in order to [[sex-selective abortion|abort daughters]].  Many deaths have also been caused by not giving dowry to the groom's side. Dowry system, however, is not practiced by Non-Hindu people or indigenous people.

In Nepal, the practice of dowry is closely related to social prestige; and dowry violence is especially prevalent in the Terai belt. In 2009, Nepal enacted the Social Customs and Practices Act outlawing dowry; however, there have been no known cases of enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.genevadeclaration.org/fileadmin/docs/Co-publications/Femicide_A%20Gobal%20Issue%20that%20demands%20Action.pdf|title=Femicide: A Global Issue that Demands Action|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Academic Council on the United Nations System (ACUNS) Vienna Liaison Office|isbn=978-3-200-03012-1|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630215522/http://www.genevadeclaration.org/fileadmin/docs/Co-publications/Femicide_A%20Gobal%20Issue%20that%20demands%20Action.pdf|archivedate=2014-06-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here, the dowry is known as ''dewedda''.

A large dowry is sometimes expected, and given, in Afghanistan; some houses are almost emptied so that the daughter may make a grand show at the wedding. Items included in a dowry depend on the resources of the bride's family and the demands made by the groom's family. Embroidery is traditionally included in a dowry, as is land, money, jewelry such as necklaces and ''pazab'', shoes, shawls, carpets, bedding, furniture, crockery, mirrors, clocks and such items. The dowry is transferred from bride's family house to the groom's family house one day before the wedding day in a ritual ceremony with band and a procession, which typically adopts the longest route in the residential area for the Afghan community to see the dowry being given by the bride's family.&lt;ref&gt;SHAH, Ikbal Ali.

Afghanistan has both dowry and bride price, although the practice differs between different tribal and ethnic groups. In Afghanistan, a marriage typically requires two kinds of payments: a [[mahr]], which typically consists of livestock, property and money, and in practice often takes the form of a bride price paid to the woman's family; and a dowry brought by the bride to her husband's home which may include various goods such as clothing, bedding and household utensils.&lt;ref name="undp.org.af"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Family"&gt;Peter Blood (2004), [http://countrystudies.us/afghanistan/57.htm Family] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20120703101254/http://countrystudies.us/afghanistan/57.htm |date=2012-07-03 }}, Afghanistan A Country Study, Library of Congress, {{ISBN|978-1419104985}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of dowry the bride brings often influences how she is treated when she arrives at her husband's home.&lt;ref name="Family"/&gt; Parents frequently arrange marriages for daughters at a young age, in order to end their economic responsibility for their daughter.&lt;ref name="Stange, Mary Zeiss, and Carol K.

Dowry has existed in Persia for over 1000 years, and called ''jahīzīeh'' (sometimes spelled ''jahaz'' or ''jaheez'', جهیزیه).&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/contextualize.pl?p.2.steingass.125920 Steingass Persian-English], University of Chicago, See explanation for Jahiz&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aryanpour.com/ Persian English Dictionary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102084608/http://www.aryanpour.com/ |date=2014-11-02 }} see Dowry&lt;/ref&gt; ''Jahiz'' is vestments, furniture, jewelry, cash and other paraphernalia a bride's family gives to the bride to take with her to the groom's family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/arusi-the-secular-wedding-celebration-which-follows-the-wedding-contract-ceremony-aqd-q Encyclopedia Iranica] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517002226/http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/arusi-the-secular-wedding-celebration-which-follows-the-wedding-contract-ceremony-aqd-q |date=2013-05-17 }}, New York (2011), Vol. II, Fasc. 6, pp. 666–670; See discussion of dowry, under ʿARŪSĪ&lt;/ref&gt; Jahiz is separate from [[Mahr]] required by [[Sharia]] religious laws, as well as the traditional payment of ''Shir Baha'' (literally: price of milk), in rural [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;Ghorayshi, P.

===Turkey===
Dowry is known as ''çeyiz'' in [[Turkey]]. ''Ceyiz'' is the property and money bride's family in Turkey give during marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Sherife Ayla Samli (2011), Containing the Future: Modern Identities as Material Negotiation in the Urban Turkish Ceyiz, PhD thesis, Rice University, Houston (US)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suad Joseph, Afsāna Naǧmābādī, Encyclopedia of Women &amp; Islamic Cultures, Volume 3, {{ISBN|9004128190}}, Brill (The Netherlands), p. 263, Quote: "Ceyiz, a combination of dowry/trouseau [sic?], takes the form of goods, property, gold or cash given to the bride"&lt;/ref&gt; Ceyiz is different and separate from the ''[[Mahr]]'', which is paid by the groom to the bride, or traditional ''baslik'' in some parts of Turkey.

Ceyiz often includes furnishings, appliances, clothing, gold jewelry, cash and other items depending on the resources of the Turkish family.&lt;ref&gt;Suad Joseph, Afsāna Naǧmābādī, Encyclopedia of Women &amp; Islamic Cultures, Volume 3, {{ISBN|9004128190}}, Brill (The Netherlands), pp. 262–263&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the Turkish dowry remains with the couple after marriage, other is specifically meant for the groom's family and relatives.&lt;ref&gt;Sandikci and Ilhan (2011), ''Dowry: A Cherished Possession or an Old-Fashioned Tradition in a Modernizing Society?'', in Cele Otnes, Tina M. Lowre (Editors): Contemporary Consumption Rituals: A Research Anthology, {{ISBN|0-8058-4204-7}}, Taylor &amp; Francis; p. 164, Quote – "Gift dowry is the third type of dowry and fulfills a different role than the other two types. Whereas chest and appliance dowries are for the use of the bride and groom, gift dowry are given to relatives. It is required for the bride's family to give gift dowry to the groom's family and relatives. Typically, the parents and siblings receive more valuable items, whereas the relatives are given smaller gifts. By offering valuable gifts to the closest relatives, the bride's family symbolically reaffirms the relatively higher status for the groom's family."&lt;/ref&gt; The ''ceyiz'' is typically agreed upon between the groom's and bride's families before the wedding date is finalized. According to tradition, even in current times, the dowry is displayed for showing-off, before the marriage in rural Turkey, at the bride's family, or groom's family—the display is typically attended and examined by females, particularly from the groom's family. In some cases, if the groom's family is not satisfied with the displayed dowry, the wedding is cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;Sandikci and Ilhan (2011), in Cele Otnes, Tina M.

===Azerbaijan===
Dowry is known as ''cehiz'' in [[Azerbaijan]]. ''Cehiz'' is the property and money the bride's family must give to the groom's family prior to marriage. ''Cehiz'' is separate from the money under ''[[Mahr]]'' required under [[Sharia]] religious requirements in Islamic Azerbaijan. ''Cehiz'' often includes furnishings, appliances, crystal, mirrors, bed, jewelry and cash depending on the negotiations between the groom's and bride's families before the wedding day. While the groom's family receives ''Cehiz'', the bride receives ''Mahr''. Relatives of the bride often contribute to the ''Cehiz'' demands, through the ritual of ''koncas''. Dowry is transferred a few days before the wedding, and examined by groom's family, and a ''Sihaye'' (receipt) for the dowry is issued by the groom's family; this helps avoid disputes.

===Tajikistan===
Dowries are sometimes expected in [[Tajikistan]], and they often consist of a collection of traditional dresses which are on display on the wedding day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-13065495|title=Tajik weddings hit by austerity law|work=BBC News|accessdate=20 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103021621/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-13065495|archivedate=3 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egypt===
In [[Egypt]], dowry is known as ''Gehaz''.&lt;ref name=amin2004&gt;Amin, Sajeda, and Nagah H. Al‐Bassusi. "Education, wage work, and marriage: Perspectives of Egyptian working women." ''Journal of Marriage and Family'' 66, no. 5 (2004): pp. 1287–1299. {{doi|10.1111/j.0022-2445.2004.00093.x}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://prezi.com/ltqoux45z6nv/marriage-in-subsaharan-west-african-countries/ Marriage in Subsaharan &amp; West African Countries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226211727/http://prezi.com/ltqoux45z6nv/marriage-in-subsaharan-west-african-countries/ |date=2013-12-26 }} Prezi (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; This is the property a bride is expected to bring with her at marriage, and it is different from the dower (Mahr) paid by the groom to the bride per requirements of Sharia. ''Gehaz'' is observed in rural and urban Egypt, and is typically negotiated between the groom's family and bride's. ''Gehaz'' includes furniture, appliances, jewelry, china, bedding and various household items. Families begin collecting dowry years before a girl is betrothed. Many Egyptian girls take up jobs so as to save money necessary to meet the expected dowry demands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popcouncil.org/pdfs/BuildingAssets_Oct05.pdf Building assets for safe, productive lives – Girls] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017093203/http://popcouncil.org/pdfs/BuildingAssets_Oct05.pdf |date=2012-10-17 }} Population Council, New York (2005); pp. 17–19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Egyptian+working+women's+perceptions+of+marriage.-a0110734686 Egyptian working women's perceptions of marriage], Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics, Egypt (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

While the dowry is given during the marriage, in rural Egypt, it is ritually displayed to the village prior to the marriage. Every piece of the ''gehaz'' is placed on open cars that go around the village several times, with music, in order to show off the dowry being given by the bride's family to the groom.&lt;ref name=amin2004/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/48/24/92/PDF/10035.pdf A Collective Model of Female Labor Supply : Do Distribution Factors Matter in the Egyptian Case?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730202653/http://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/48/24/92/PDF/10035.pdf |date=2012-07-30 }} Rana HENDY, Catherine SOFER, Universite Paris (May, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''gehaz'' show off ritual is also a means to enhance the bride's status within her new marital family.

===Morocco===
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Portret van groep vrouwen TMnr 60047825.jpg|thumb|Muslim [[Ouled Nail]] girls waiting in the streets of an Algerian village to earn dowry as dancers. Algerian patrons invited them at cafés and festivals or to shrines of Muslim [[Wali|awliya]]. When their dowries were adequate they returned to their mountain villages and married within the tribe. This centuries-old tradition has continued into modern [[Algeria]]. (Photo from the late 19th century, courtesy of Tropenmuseum, The Netherlands)&lt;ref&gt;Çelik, Zeynep, and Leila Kinney. "Ethnography and exhibitionism at the Expositions Universelles." Assemblage 13 (1990): 35–59.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Dowry is a traditional and current practice in [[Morocco]], and is called ''shura'', ''shawar'', ''ssdaq'' or ''amerwas'' depending on the speaker's region and ethnicity (e.g. Arabic, Berber, etc.). Dowry in Morocco is separate from the ''Mahr'' or ''Sadaq'' that is religiously required by [[Sharia]].&lt;ref name=Ziba2000/&gt;

Centuries ago, ''Mahr'' and ''Sadaq'' meant something different in Morocco. ''Mahr'' was the purchase price paid for the bride by the groom's family to the bride's father or guardian, while ''Sadaq'' was the betrothal gift offered by groom to the bride.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Westermarck (1914), Marriage ceremonies in Morocco, ISBN MacMillan (London), pp. 65–74&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the difference vanished and they are now one and the same, but different from the practice of dowry.&lt;ref&gt;Maher, V. (1974). Divorce and Property in the Middle Atlas of Morocco. Man, 9(1), pp. 103–122.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, the Moroccan practice is to split the so-called ''Sadaq'', which meets the Islamic requirement of ''Mahr'', into two parts: ''naqd'' (cash) and ''kali'' (remainder Mahr). The ''Naqd Sadaq'' is paid by the groom's family to bride's family before the wedding. The bride's family supplements the ''Naqd'' amount with an equal or greater amount of cash, and gives dowry (called ''shura'', ''shawar'' or ''amerwas''). This dowry typically includes furniture, clothing, appliances, beds, household items, divans, jewelry, and other property. The dowry amounts are negotiated before the wedding. Higher dowry and lower [[Mahr]] are expected for widows and divorcées than for virgins. If elders of the two families do not agree on the dowry amount, the marriage is typically delayed or cancelled. The value and composition of the dowry varies according to social class, family wealth and regional customs. The ''kali al-sadaq'' (sometimes called ''mwahhar'' in Northern Morocco) is paid later, to technically meet the requirements of ''Mahr'' under Islamic Sharia. The ''shura'' (dowry) far exceeds the ''kali al-sadaq'', and there is a large transfer of wealth from bride's family to the couple and the groom's family.&lt;ref name=Ziba2000&gt;Ziba Mir-Hosseini (2000), Marriage on Trial: A Study of Islamic Family Law, Tauris (London), {{ISBN|1860646085}}, pp. 97–102, 70–75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Camillia Fawzi El-Solh and Judy Mabro (1995), ''Muslim Women's Choices: Religious Belief and Social Reality'', {{ISBN|0-85496-8369}}, pp. 56–72&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bosnia===
Dowry is known as ''oprema'' in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]].&lt;ref name=bringa95&gt;Tone Bringa (1995), ''Being Muslim the Bosnian Way'', {{ISBN|978-0691001753}}, Princeton University Press; pp. 137–143&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Rheubottom(1980) in John Comaroff (Editor), Dowry and Wedding Celebrations in Yugoslav, Academic Press (London); pp. 221–251&lt;/ref&gt; In neighboring regions, it is sometimes called ''prikija'' or ''ženinstvo''. Another term ''miraz'' is used sometimes, but ''miraz'' is also used to mean inheritance, something different from dowry.&lt;ref&gt;Nusret Mulasmajic, Bosnian-English Dictionary – Turcisms Collorquialisms Islamic Words, {{ISBN|978-1-4634-0179-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stanimirovic, V. (2010). Re-Emergence of the Dowry amongst Serbs. Annals Fac. L. Belgrade Belgrade L. Rev., 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Oprema'' is separate from the Mahr dower Muslim Bosnians are required to give under Islamic laws. ''Oprema'' refers to the property the bride's parents give her as part of the marriage. It often includes furniture, kitchenware, decorative items, gold jewelry and other items. Oprema is also different from ''pohod'' (gift giving, ''dar'') ritual of Bosnia, as well as the ''ruho'' (embroidered clothing) ritual. Oprema is discussed between the groom's and bride's family before the marriage; the groom's family sets the quality and quantity expectations. The ''oprema'' is typically not displayed to those who attend the wedding. Oprema and ''dar'' are a major economic burden to bride's family in Bosnia. Poorer families spend years saving money and buying ''oprema'' in order to get their daughter(s) married.&lt;ref name=bringa95/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, O. (1935).

===Serbia===
In [[Serbia]], in some rural areas, the custom of dowry continues to be observed.
Dowry has been brought to medieval Serbia mainly through Byzantine influences; it was not originally a Slavic custom. The Turkish conquest of Serbia has caused the temporary disappearance of dowry, but the custom re-emerged in the 19th century. The communist regime sought to abolish dowry, but the custom has survived in some rural areas to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://anali.ius.bg.ac.rs/Annals%202010/Annals%202010%20p%20185-202.pdf|title=RE-EMERGENCE OF THE DOWRY AMONGST SERBS|last=Stanimirović|first=Vojislav|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728232057/http://anali.ius.bg.ac.rs/Annals%202010/Annals%202010%20p%20185-202.pdf|archivedate=2014-07-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Violence against women and international perspectives==
{{Main article|Violence against women}}
Disputes related to dowry sometimes result in violence against women, including killings and [[acid attacks]]. [[Amnesty International]] has stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/issues/women-s-rights/violence-against-women/violence-against-women-information|title=Violence Against Women Information|work=Amnesty International USA|accessdate=20 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404225053/http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/issues/women-s-rights/violence-against-women/violence-against-women-information|archivedate=4 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|[T]he ongoing reality of dowry-related violence is an example of what can happen when women are treated as property. Brides unable to pay the high "price" to marry are punished by violence and often death at the hands of their in-laws or their own husbands.}}

The [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women]] classifies violence against women into three categories: that occurring in the family (DV), that occurring within the general community, and that perpetrated or condoned by the State. Family violence is defined as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/48/a48r104.htm|title=A/RES/48/104.  Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130924000147/http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/48/a48r104.htm|archivedate=24 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family, including battering, sexual abuse of female children in the household, '''dowry-related violence''', [[marital rape]], [[female genital mutilation]] and other traditional practices harmful to women, non- spousal violence and violence related to exploitation.}}

Kirti Singh states, "Dowry is widely considered to be both a cause and a consequence of son preference. The practice of dowry inevitably leads to discrimination in different areas against daughters and makes them vulnerable to various forms of violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://india.unfpa.org/drive/LawsandSonPreferenceinIndia.pdf|title=Laws and son preference in India: a reality check|last=|first=|date=August 2013|website=|publisher=United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) – India|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313094849/http://india.unfpa.org/drive/LawsandSonPreferenceinIndia.pdf|archive-date=13 March 2014|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singh suggests this may lead to girls being unwanted, [[sex selective abortion]], or her parents may abandon or mistreat her after she is born.

They note the estimates for actual number of dowry deaths per year vary widely ranging from 600–750 homicides a year to 25,000 homicides a year, with official government records suggesting 7,618 deaths in 2006.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.path.org/publications/files/GVR_femicide_rpt.pdf|title=Strengthening Understanding of Femicide|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417135701/http://www.path.org/publications/files/GVR_femicide_rpt.pdf|archivedate=2012-04-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rakhshinda Perveen states thousands of dowry-related [[bride burning]] cases in Pakistan, yet few prosecutions and rare convictions for dowry-related violence against women.&lt;ref name=rperveen&gt;Rakhshinda Perveen, [http://www.humanrights.asia/news/ahrc-news/AHRC-ART-003-2014 PAKISTAN: The social injustice behind the practice of dowry-when greed dictates society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109184045/http://www.humanrights.asia/news/ahrc-news/AHRC-ART-003-2014 |date=2014-11-09 }}, January 10, 2014, [[Asian Human Rights Commission]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[UNODC]] includes dowry deaths as a form of gender-based violence.&lt;ref&gt;"Gender-based crimes can take many forms, including physical, psychological, moral and economic, and varies not only from country to country but city to village.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11363">'''Entertainment law''', also referred to as media law is legal services provided to the [[entertainment industry]]. These services in entertainment law overlap with [[intellectual property law]]. Intellectual property has many moving parts that include [[trademark]]s, [[copyright]], and the "[[Right of Publicity]]". However, the [[Legal practice|practice]] of entertainment law often involves questions of [[employment law]], [[contract law]], [[torts]], [[labor law]], [[bankruptcy law]], [[immigration]], [[securities law]], [[security interest]]s, [[agency (law)|agency]], right of privacy, defamation, advertising,  [[criminal law]], [[tax law]], [[International law]] (especially [[Private international law]]), and [[insurance]] law.

Much of the work of an entertainment law practice is transaction based, i.e., drafting contracts, negotiation and mediation. Some situations may lead to [[litigation]] or [[arbitration]].&lt;ref&gt;Winter, Erica.

== Overview ==
Entertainment law covers an area of law which involves media of all different types (TV, film, music, publishing, advertising, Internet &amp; news media, etc.), and stretches over various legal fields, which include corporate, finance, [[intellectual property]], [[publicity]] and [[privacy]], and, in the United States, the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]].

For film, entertainment attorneys work with the actor's agent to finalize the actor's contracts for upcoming projects.  After an agent lines up work for a star, the entertainment attorney negotiates with the agent and buyer of the actor's talent for compensation and profit participation.  Entertainment attorneys are under strict confidentiality agreements, so the specifics of their job are kept top secret. But, some entertainment attorney's job descriptions have become comparable to those of a star's agent, [[Talent manager|manager]] or [[publicist]]. Most entertainment attorneys have many other roles as well such as assisting in building a client's career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wasko|first=Janet|title=Hollywood Film Industry|year=2008|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Malden, MA|pages=176–178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
As the popularity of [[Mass media|media]] became widespread, the field of media law became more popular and needed leaving certain corporate professionals wanting to participate more in media. As a result, many young lawyers fledged into media law which allowed them the opportunity to increase connections in media, and the opportunity to become a media presenter or an acting role if such an opportunity arose. As technology continues to make huge advancements, many lawsuits have begun to arise which makes the demand for lawyers extremely necessary.

==Categories==
Entertainment law is generally sub-divided into the following areas related to the types of activities that have their own specific trade unions, production techniques, rules, [[Custom (law)|customs]], [[case law]], and negotiation strategies:

* '''[[film|F&lt;small&gt;ILM&lt;/small&gt;]]''': covering [[option (films)|option agreement]]s, [[chain of title]] issues, talent agreements ([[screenwriter]]s, [[film director]]s, [[actor]]s, [[composer]]s, [[designer|production designer]]s), [[film production|production]] and [[film editing|post production]] and trade union issues, [[distribution (film)|distribution]] issues, [[film|motion picture]] industry negotiations [[movie marketing|distribution]], and general [[intellectual property]] issues especially relating to [[copyright]] and, to a lesser extent, [[trademark]]s; 

-In an 8-0 choice, the Supreme Court held that in light of the fact that the FCC rules at the time did not cover "short lived exclamations," the fines issued against Fox were unethical and subsequently discredited as "illegally unclear".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law360.com/articles/402663/top-5-media-entertainment-cases-of-2012|title=Top 5 Media &amp; Entertainment Cases Of 2012 - Law360|website=www.law360.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

-Copyright: Golan v. Holder, No. 10-545 In a 6-2 vote, the judges dismissed contentions in light of the First Amendment and the Constitution's copyright provision, stating that the general population was not "a class of sacred centrality" and that copyright insurances may be extended regardless of whether they did not strive for new attempts to be made. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law360.com/articles/402663/top-5-media-entertainment-cases-of-2012|title=Top 5 Media &amp; Entertainment Cases Of 2012 - Law360|website=www.law360.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[internet|I&lt;small&gt;NTERNET&lt;/small&gt;]]''': In 2007, Viacom, a media aggregate that possesses MTV and Comedy Central TV, sued YouTube for $1 billion in light of copyright infringement claims for unapproved posting of Viacom copyrighted material. In May 2008, YouTube began utilizing its advanced fingerprinting innovation to secure copyright-ensured content.

[[Defamation]] ([[libel]] and [[slander]]), [[personality rights]] and [[privacy rights]] issues also arise in entertainment law.

==Cases==
-Contract Law is an arrangement of principles that represents the legitimacy of an understanding between at least two people, organizations, entities, etc. Contract Laws have been at the forefront of Entertainment with leading world-wide known cases. One of those cases deals with Singer/Songwriter, Kesha.

-Kesha v. Dr. Luke – In 2014, singer Kesha filed a civil suit against music producer Lukasz Sebastian Gottwald, also referred to some as Dr. Luke for gender-based hate crimes and emotional distress. This civil suit caused Lukasz Sebastian Gottwald to in return sue Kesha for defamation and breach of contract. This case ended with a judge declining to release Kesha from her binding contract that prohibited her from continuing her career effectively. The judge took note that Kesha had entered an agreement after she had sworn under oath that no harassment was taking place. Many celebrities such as Miley Cyrus, Lady Gaga, and Demi Lovato have shown support for Kesha in an attempt to broadcast the injustice contract laws have played in the outcome of this case. Singer-songwriter Taylor Swift donated $250,000 to relieve Kesha of any financial obligations.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/12/13/a-singer-spoke-up-about-sexual-harassment-in-country-music-now-shes-being-sued/|title=A singer spoke up about sexual harassment in country music.

-Katie Armiger – In 2016, singer/songwriter Katie Armiger claimed that a handful of DJs’ at radio stations across the United States harassed her during her radio tour while her record label, Cold River Records justified it by telling her that radio programmers are her ticket to fame. Cold River Records caused defamation and false light against Armigers’ character when they challenged her in a court case that played out in the public eye. Cold River Records held Armiger hostage in a lengthy prosecution that forbid her to release new music or perform live by strictly enforcing the terms and legality of her record contract. Because of this, Armiger lost countless fans with her lack of presence on social media and most likely lost credibility as well by not giving her fans an explanation.  There is no law created for instances like this where an artist is unable to breach their contract immediately when harassment is involved. Libel per quod can be applied to this case by showing that Armiger’s statements show plenty of proof and negligence on not only Cold Rivers’ behalf but the DJs’ behalf as well. In the end, Armigers’ character was defamed and a false light was shone upon her when Cold River Records’ head Pete O’Heeron claimed that Armigers’ suit was baseless. Defamation, false light and contract laws have played a significant role in Katie Armigers’ reality through her pursuit to breach her contract with Cold River Records.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/12/13/a-singer-spoke-up-about-sexual-harassment-in-country-music-now-shes-being-sued/|title=A singer spoke up about sexual harassment in country music.

'''Equality feminism''' is a subset of the overall [[feminism]] movement that focuses on the basic similarities between men and women, and whose ultimate goal is the equality of the sexes in all domains.  This includes economic and political equality, equal access within the workplace, freedom from oppressive gender stereotyping, and an androgynous worldview.&lt;ref name=Stanford&gt;Stanford University. [http://genderedinnovations.stanford.edu/terms/feminism.html Gendered Innovations]. Retrieved 3 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|reason=Citation refers to "Liberal Feminism, or the Equality Approach", article does not mention equality feminism| talk=Lead section|date=February 2018}}

Feminist theory seeks to promote the legal status of women as equal and undifferentiated from that of men. While equality feminists largely agree that men and women have basic biological differences in anatomy and frame, they argue that on a psychological level, the use of ration or reason is androgynous. For equality feminists, men and women are equal in terms of their ability to reason, achieve goals, and prosper in both the work and home front.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for this entire paragraph|date=February 2018}}

Equality feminism was the dominant version of feminism following [[Mary Wollstonecraft]]'s "A Vindication of the Rights of Woman" (1792). Wollstonecraft made the case that women's equality to men manifests itself in education and worker's rights, and further produced a proverbial roadmap in order for future women to follow in terms of activism and feminist theorizing.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, Mary. [https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext02/vorow10.txt "A Vindication of the Rights of Woman"]. Retrieved 4 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, active equality feminist include [[Simone de Beauvoir]], the [[Seneca Falls Convention]] Leaders, [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], [[Lucretia Coffin Mott]], [[Susan B. Anthony]], [[Betty Friedan]], and [[Gloria Steinem]].

While equality feminism was the dominant perspective of feminism during the 19th and 20th century, the 1980s and 1990s brought about a new focus in popular feminism on [[difference feminism]], or the essential differences between men and women.&lt;ref&gt;The University of Alabama. [http://www.uah.edu/woolf/feminism_kinds.htm "Kinds of Feminism"]. Retrieved 3 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In opposition to equality feminism, this view advocates for the celebration of the "feminine" by focusing on traditionally viewed female traits, such as empathy, nurturing, and care. While equality feminists view human nature as essentially androgynous, difference feminists claim that this viewpoint aligns the "good" with male-dominated stereotypes, thus sticking within the patriarchal framework of society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/care-eth/ Ethics of Care] (International Encyclopedia of Philosophy).

== History ==

In both law and in theology women were portrayed as both physically and intellectually inferior.  One of the first feminist documents that set the stage for feministic movements occurred when Mary Wollstonecraft wrote "Vindication of the Rights of Woman" in 1792.  While this literature was seen as rebellious at the time it echoed the feelings of women throughout [[France]] as women's republican clubs demanded that liberty, equality and fraternity should be applied to both men and women.  While this movement gained notoriety it was eventually extinguished by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s Code Napoleon that established that the husband had complete control over the family and regressed equality feminism.&lt;ref&gt;Landes, Joan B. Women and the Public Sphere in the Age of the French Revolution. Ithaca: Cornell UP, 1988. Retrieved 1 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

While much of the equality feminism movements that occurred in France weren't successful, they influenced much of the movements that occurred in North America in the 1800s.  Both [[Abigail Adams]] and [[Mercy Otis Warren]] fought for woman's emancipation to be included in the constitution of 1776 to no avail.  However, Elizabeth Cade Stanton, Lucretia Coffin Mott, along with thousands of other women changed the dynamics of equality feminism forever with the women's convention at Seneca Falls N.Y. in 1848.  Here along with independence they demanded full legal equality in all aspects of life (education, commercial opportunities, compensation, voting rights, etc.).  With the influence of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, this movement evolved into Europe.  In 1869 [[John Stuart Mill]] published ''[[The Subjection of Women]]'' in which he argued that equality between the sexes would translate to more moral and intellectual advancement which in turn would result in more human happiness to everyone.&lt;ref name=Mills/&gt;{{rp|87–89}}

After the expansion into Europe, the movement stifled its growth until 1920 where the [[woman suffrage]] movement occurred, as many women were divided when determining whether or not women were on equal standing with men.  This continued until the [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women]] was established in 1946 to secure equal political, economic and educational opportunities for women throughout the world.  In 1949, a French Existentialist Simone de Beauvoir published the work ''[[The Second Sex]]'', in which she debunks many of the claims made towards women and fights for gender equality.  In 1963 another literature pertaining to equality feminism arose, with Betty Friedan's ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'' in which she discussed "the problem that has no name", being the widespread unhappiness of women in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=FB&gt;Friedan, Betty. "The Feminine Mystique." The Essential Feminist Reader. Ed. Estelle B. Freedman. New York: Random House Group, 2007. Retrieved 2 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  She uses this information to describe many of the gender inequalities that society has created that has resulted in this unhappiness, such as giving up her psychology career to tend to her children.  Using these literatures as a guide feminism once again arose in the United States with the development of the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW) formed in 1966. This organization fought for the removal of all legal and social barriers placed upon women to once again influence true equality between men and women.  In 1972 women leaders such as [[Bella Abzug]], [[Betty Friedan]], and [[Gloria Steinem]] pushed the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] through Congress; however, it fell short of ratification by 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Castro, Ginette.

== Equality feminist theory ==

Equality feminist theory is the extension of the equality of the male and female into theoretical and philosophical fields of thought. At its core, equality feminist theory advocates for the equal standing of both men and women in terms of desires, wants, goals, and achievement. Thus, from this viewpoint, the basis of human nature outside of culture is androgynous, neutral, and equal.&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;{{Failed verification|reason=Citation refers to "Liberal Feminism, or the Equality Approach", article does not mention equality feminism| talk=Lead section|date=February 2018}}

Much of equality feminism focuses on the relation of reason as the central tenet of both men and women equally. Mary Wollstonecraft in "A Vindication on the Rights of Women" (1792) claimed that women should enjoy the same legal and political rights as men on the grounds that they are human beings. Specifically, Wollstonecraft argues for "[a]sserting the rights which women in common with men ought to contend for".&lt;ref name=WM&gt;Wollstonecraft, Mary. [https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext02/vorow10.txt A Vindication of the Rights of Women]. Retrieved 4 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}} In this way, both men and women should have equal access to rights because they have an equal access to the capacity to reason. Similarly, ''[[The Subjection of Women]]'' (1869), [[John Stuart Mill]] advocated that society ought to be arranged according to reason and that 'accidents of birth' is irrelevant. Thus, because both men and women are governed by principles of reason, then the biological elements such as sex, gender, and race aren't contributing factors to the essence of the individual. Mill notes that within a patriarchal society, "Men hold women in subjection by representing to them meekness, submissiveness resignation of all individual will into the hands of a man as an essential part of sexual attractiveness".&lt;ref name=Mills&gt;Mills, John Stuart and Okin, Susan Moller. [https://books.google.com/books/about/The_subjection_of_women.html?id=PK_BGGCU_dsC ''The Subjection of Women'']. Hacking Publishing, 1998. Retrieved 4 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1–127}} In this way, to say that women have essential characteristics of submission by nature of their sex is an oppressive measure that contradicts the basic principle of reason that governs all human nature.

== Important figures ==

===Mary Wollstonecraft===
In 1792 Wollstonecraft wrote one of the earliest works in feminist philosophy and though she doesn't explicitly state that men and women are equal she does call for equality in various realms of life which set the stage for future equality feminist works. In her piece ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]: with Strictures on Political and Moral Subjects'', Wollstonecraft argues that women should have an education comparable to their position in society.  She articulates her argument by claiming that since women were the primary care givers they could be able to better educate their own children and be seen as "companions" to the husband rather than wives if they were given this opportunity.  Instead of being considered "property" that were exchanged through marriage, Wollstonecraft maintains that women are human beings and therefore deserve equal fundamental rights as men.&lt;ref name=WM/&gt;{{rp|74–88}}

===John Stuart Mill===
In 1869, John Stuart Mill with the help of his wife [[Harriet Taylor Mill]] published ''The Subjection of Women'', in it he argued for equality between the sexes.  John Stuart Mill was able to draw off of some of the arguments his wife made in her essay ''The Enfranchisement of Women'', in which she opened the door of favoring equality for both men and women.  Mill believe that the moral and intellectual advancement from giving women the opportunity to be considered equal would translate to greater happiness for everyone involved.  He believed that all humans had the capability of being educated and civilized, with which he argued women should be given the right to vote.  Throughout the book Mill continues to argue that both men and women should be able to vote to defend their rights and be able to have the opportunity to stand on their own two feet morally and intellectually, and constantly used his position in Parliament to advocate for [[women's suffrage]].&lt;ref&gt;John Stuart Mills (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)". plato.stanford.edu. Retrieved 30 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mill attacks many of the arguments that women are inferior at certain activities and therefore be forbidden from doing them by saying that women aren't given the opportunities and therefore we don't know what women are capable of.  He claims that males are making an authoritative statement without evidence, an argument solely based on speculation.  Mill claims that by giving women this opportunity to figure out exactly what they were capable of would double the mass of mental faculties to serve humanity, and could produce a great impact on human development.&lt;ref name=Mills/&gt;{{rp|56–79}}

===Simone de Beauvoir===
[[Simone de Beauvoir]] played a large role in equality feminism with the publishing of her book ''[[The Second Sex]]'', broken into 3 parts.  In the first part, "Destiny", de Beauvoir discusses the relationship of male to female in a variety of creatures before comparing human beings.  This physiological data along with psychoanalytical data help her come to the conclusion that there wasn't a historical defeat of the female sex.  Part two, "History", outlines the two factors in the evolution of women's condition: participation in production and freedom from reproductive slavery.  In these chapters, de Beauvoir compares being a women to being like an animal, similar to the way male animals dominated a female.  Finally in part three, "Myths", de Beauvoir discusses the perceived "everlasting disappointment" of women from a male heterosexual point of view.  She then comes back and discusses full reality of the situation to show the discrepancies between perception and reality.&lt;ref&gt;Beauvoir, Simone De. ''The Second Sex''. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout her literary career, de Beauvoir helped unravel some of the "myths" associated with perceptions in gender and set forth a strong message that men and women should be treated equal with equal rights.

===Betty Friedan===
[[Betty Friedan]] became one of the most recognized equality feminists after writing the book ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'', in which she discusses "the problem that has no name", female unhappiness in the 1950s and 1960s.  It was through this book that Friedman was able to address many of the problems and the widespread recognition allowed her to later become president of the [[National Organization for Women]](NOW).  

Throughout the piece Friedan addressed the problem that women had "wanting more than a husband, children, and a home".  Friedan discusses the societal expectations of raising children and how this caused many women to not be able to do what they wanted.  Many decisions that were made for women were made by men and this had worn out many women.  She discusses the problem of education and that many families solely focused on education for the male children and women were instead "assigned to be married to fulfill child-bearing expectations".&lt;ref name=FB/&gt;  It was through the impact of this piece of literature that women were finally given a voice to say it was okay to not want to conform to societal expectations and fight for equality of opportunities, choices, marriage, education, and voting.

== Objections ==

The main objection raised to equality feminism comes in the form of [[difference feminism]], the belief that emphasizes the differences between men and women. This viewpoint, as championed by such feminists such as [[Carol Gilligan]], [[Joan Tronto]], [[Eva Feder Kittay]], [[Genevieve Lloyd]], [[Alison Jaggar]], and Ynestra King, developed out of the rejection of the androgynous view of human nature as emphasized in equality feminism. Begun largely in the 1980s, this viewpoint makes the case that equality feminism fails to account for the uniquely female experience, and thus creates the male perspective as the dominant aspiration.&lt;ref&gt;Bromley,Victoria L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="51566">This article focuses on ethnic minorities in the [[Republic of Azerbaijan]].

==Demographics==
According to the 2009 census, ethnic minorities in [[Azerbaijan]] represent 8.9% of the population, including [[Lezgins]] (the largest minority group, making up 2.0% of the population), [[Russians]] (1.3%) and others, such as [[Talysh people|Talysh]], [[Tat people (Caucasus)|Tats]] (Muslims and [[Mountain Jews|Judeo-Tats]]), [[Caucasian Avars|Avars]], [[Georgians]], and [[Ashkenazi Jews]], which comprise the remaining 3.9%.&lt;ref name="ecri"&gt;[http://www.coe.int/t/e/human_rights/ecri/1%2Decri/2%2Dcountry%2Dby%2Dcountry_approach/azerbaijan/azerbaijan_cbc_3.asp European Commission Against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI), Second Report on Azerbaijan, CRI(2007)22,  May 24, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/aj.html#People CIA World Factbook - Azerbaijan]&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijanis]] formed a consistent majority, it is worth noting that there was a shift in the demographic trends in modern Azerbaijan even before the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] and the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]], that lead to an exodus of some ethnic minorities, notably the [[Armenians in Azerbaijan|Armenians]] and [[Russians in Azerbaijan|Russians]], and conversely a large influx of [[Deportation of Azerbaijanis from Armenia|Azerbaijani refugees]] from Armenia and [[Refugees and internally displaced persons in Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani internally displaced persons from Nagorno-Karabakh and adjacent territories]], thus giving Azerbaijan a more homogeneous character.

==Background==
According to Professor Douglass Blum:

{{cquote|Finally, Azerbaijan presents a somewhat more ambiguous picture. It boasts a well-established official national identity associated with claims of a unique heritage based on an improbable blend of Turkism, Zoroastrianism, moderate Islam, and its historical function as 'bridge' between Asia and Europe along the Silk Road. At the same time there remain strong local allegiances and ethnic distinctions, including submerged tensions between Azeris, Russians, and also Lezgins and Talysh (besides Armenians), as well as stubborn religious cleavages (roughly 85% of the Islamic population is Shi'ite 15% Sunni). This persistence of parochialism is hardly surprising inasmuch as there has been little historical basis for national identity formation among Azeri elites, who were significantly affected by russification and are still generally lukewarm in their expressions of pan-Turkism.  Perhaps the most powerful source of social cohesion and stale legitimacy is the war in Nagorno-Karabakh, which has at least generated some degree of collective identity as victim of Armenian aggression perhaps a slender reed on which to construct a national identity conducive to developmental state building in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Douglass Blum, ‘’Contested national identities and weak state structures in   Eurasia ’’(pp  in Sean Kay, S. Victor Papacosma, James Sperling, Limiting institutions?: The Challenge of Eurasian Security Governance, Manchester University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Freedom House]] has reported, in July 2005, that some ethnic minorities have encountered discrimination in such areas as housing, education, and employment. The [[United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination]] (CERD) noted that, although Azerbaijan had demonstrated improvements by enacting legislation with provisions for racial discrimination, there had been no discrimination related cases prosecuted. In its summary record, the CERD questioned how such legislation would stem the reportedly discriminatory practices of public officials and law enforcement personnel. The CERD also recommended that Azerbaijan broaden its hitherto narrow understanding of discrimination by not only addressing its "most severe and extreme manifestations" but its commonplace occurrence. Concern over the lack of programs to support minority languages or those fostering inter-cultural education was also expressed by the Committee. Azerbaijan has attempted to curb discrimination by enacting laws.,&lt;ref name=IRBC&gt;[http://www.irb-cisr.gc.ca/en/research/rir/?action=record.viewrec&amp;gotorec=449896 Immigration and refugee board of Canada]&lt;/ref&gt; although the

{{cquote|
*I. The [[Azerbaijani language]] shall be the State language of the Republic of Azerbaijan.
*II. The Republic of Azerbaijan shall ensure the development of the [[Azerbaijani language]].
*III. The Republic of Azerbaijan shall guarantee the free use and development of other languages spoken by the population.}}

Furthermore, Article 45 ("The Right to Use Native Language") of Section III of the Constitution of Azerbaijan states:&lt;ref name="constitution" /&gt;
{{cquote|
*I. Every Person shall have the right to use Native language. Everyone shall have the right to be raised and get an education, be engaged in creative activities in Native Language.
*II. No one can be deprived of the right to use Native Language.}}

According to the 2007 report by the [[Council of Europe]]'s Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI):&lt;ref name="ecri" /&gt;

{{cquote|The languages of national minorities living in [[Azerbaijan]] are taught in public schools in regions where these minorities live compactly. In general, two hours a week are devoted to teaching minority languages from the first to the fourth grade. Apart from a great number of Russian schools, especially in the capital city of Baku, there are also some [[Georgian language|Georgian]] and [[Hebrew language|Jewish]] schools in [[Azerbaijan]]. ECRI notes that the Azerbaijani authorities have recently made efforts in order to improve the quality of teaching of several minority languages, including [[Lezgi language|Lezgin]] and [[Talysh language|Talysh]]. They have published textbooks in these languages to replace old or foreign textbooks which were not appropriate. However, according to several sources, the textbooks for learning other minority languages such as [[Tat language (Caucasus)|Tat]] and [[Avar language|Avar]] are still unsuitable. In addition, there are too few teachers for these minority languages, and the teachers are poorly trained. The Azerbaijani authorities have stated that the Ministry of Education is taking measures to improve the situation with regard to these issues.}}

According to other reports, there have been several complaints of ethnic unrest in Azerbaijan due to the assimilation politic of the government and its treatment of minorities. Among others the Avars, Talysh, Kurds and Tats.&lt;ref name="Avars"&gt;[http://www.today.az/news/politics/46435.html Today.Az - Forces, willing to incite ethnic conflict in Azerbaijan, attempt to use representatives of the Avarian people&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==General representation in public and political life==
According to the Resolution on the implementation of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities issued by the [[Council of Europe]] in 2004: 
{{cquote|   Azerbaijan has made particularly commendable efforts in opening up the personal scope of application of the Framework Convention to a wide range of minorities. In Azerbaijan, the importance of the protection and promotion of cultures of national minorities is recognised and the long history of cultural diversity of the country is largely valued; 
- The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and its consequences have considerably hampered efforts to implement the Framework Convention. Despite the general spirit of tolerance in Azerbaijan, the continued occupation of large parts of Azerbaijani territory and the displacement of a high number of people have caused tensions which have resulted in disconcerting manifestations of intolerance. It is to be hoped that a lasting and peaceful solution to the existing conflict will be found and that efforts to that effect will be accelerated. The eventual solution should protect the rights of all persons concerned, in conformity with the territorial integrity of the country and other principles of international law; 
&lt;br&gt;
- Certain general human rights issues - including concerns as regards freedom of expression and the process of registration of non-governmental organisations - have an impact also on the protection of national minorities and need to be addressed by the authorities as a matter of priority; 
&lt;br&gt;
- Despite certain positive legislative initiatives, there are a number of shortcomings in the legislation pertaining to the implementation of the Framework Convention. The 2002 Law on the State Language contains regrettable reductions in the legal guarantees relating to the protection of national minorities. These put at risk, for example, certain commendable practices in the field of electronic media. The process of amending the said law should be pursued further with a view to making it compatible with the Framework Convention; 
&lt;br&gt;
- There is a need to couple the Law on the State Language with improved legal guarantees for the protection of national minorities in such fields as minority language education and use of minority languages in relations with administrative authorities, with a view to consolidating and expanding the positive practices that exist. Priority should be given to the adoption of a new law on the protection of national minorities, providing the necessary guarantees for the implementation of the relevant minority language standards; 
&lt;br&gt;
- Azerbaijan should consider developing further the consultation structures for representatives of national minorities in order to improve their participation in decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=761919&amp;BackColorInternet=9999CC&amp;BackColorIntranet=&amp;BackColorLogged=FDC864 Council of Europe, Committee of Ministers, Resolution ResCMN-2004-8], on the implementation of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities by Azerbaijan, Adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 13 July 2004 at the 893rd meeting of the Ministers Deputies.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to the European Commission Against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI), the human right's body of the [[Council of Europe]]:&lt;ref name="ecri" /&gt;

{{cquote|ECRI notes the general view that national minorities are well represented in public and political life and particularly in parliament. However, there is currently no specific public body where representatives of national minorities could express their views on the public affairs of interest to them. It has been so since the disappearance of the Council for National Minorities, which was originally set up in 1993 and which does not meet anymore. According to several sources, national minorities generally hesitate to come forward to claim their linguistic and cultural rights, particularly due to the general climate resulting from the conflict over [[Nagorno-Karabakh]]. It seems that those who have tried before to publicly defend national minorities' rights have at the least experienced accusations of “working for the enemy” or of “separatism”, for instance by some media or some politicians.}}

==Assimilation==
According to the 1998 book “Linguistic Minorities in Central and Eastern Europe”:&lt;ref&gt;Christina Bratt (EDT) Paulston, Donald Peckham (eds.), Linguistic Minorities in Central and Eastern Europe, Multilingual Matters publisher, 1998, {{ISBN|1-85359-416-4}}, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|In 1993 there was an attempt officially to restore the Latin script; very few people advocated the Arabic script. Kryzi and Khinalug speakers, as well as most Tsakhurs, are bilingual and tend to assimilate with the Azeris. The same is true of the Tat speakers, and slightly less about the Talysh. At least there is no official recognition, teaching or publishing in these languages in any form. Lezghins in Azerbaijan are struggling very determinedly for their linguistic revival, but with little success. Generally there is a prevailing policy of forceful assimilation of all minorities, including the Talysh, Tat, Kurds and Lezgins. There is little or no resistance to assimilation from the Kryzi, Khinalug, Tsakhurs or Tat, and not much resistance from the Talysh. There are some desperate efforts of resistance from the Udin, stubborn resistance from the Kurds, and an extremely active struggle from the Lezgins, who want to separate Lezgin populated districts both from Dagestan and Azerbaijan in order to create an autonomous republic with Lezgin as the state language.}}

The Russian expert on the nationalities issue, Valery Tishkov, stated that Azerbaijan is one of the biggest assimilators of the former Soviet republics, the other two being Georgia and Uzbekistan.&lt;ref name="dewaal133"&gt;Thomas de Waal. ''Black Garden: Armenia and Azerbaijan Through Peace and War. '', New York: New York University Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-8147-1945-7}}, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Radio Free Europe organization's analyst Liz Fuller, several Azerbaijan's ethnic representatives (such as Magomed Guseinov from the Avar National Council) have voiced public concern about forced assimilation and ethnic cleansing in order to ensure the predominance of Azerbaijani Turks in the country over [[Lezghins]], [[Caucasian Avars|Avars]], [[Talysh people|Talysh]], [[Tat people (Caucasus)|Tats]], [[Kurds]] and other minorities.&lt;ref name="rfe1"&gt;Liz Fuller.

== Armenians ==
{{main|Armenians in Azerbaijan}}

The vast majority of Armenians in [[Azerbaijan]] live in territory controlled by the break-away region [[Nagorno-Karabakh]]. Non-official sources estimate that the number Armenians living on Azerbaijani territory outside Nagorno-Karabakh is around 2,000 to 3,000, and almost exclusively comprises persons married to Azeris or of mixed Armenian-Azeri descent. The number of Armenians who are likely not married to Azeris and are not of mixed Armenian-Azeri descent are estimated at 645 (36 men and 609 women) and more than half (378 or 59 per cent of Armenians in Azerbaijan outside Nagorno-Karabakh) live in Baku and the rest in rural areas. They are likely to be the elderly and sick, and probably have no other family members.&lt;ref name="ecri"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://intersci.ss.uci.edu/wiki/eBooks/Articles/National%20Identity%20in%20Postco%20AZ%20Tokluoglu.pdf Definitions of national identity, nationalism and ethnicity in post-Soviet Azerbaijan in the 1990s]&lt;/ref&gt; Armenians in [[Azerbaijan]] are at a great risk as long as the [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] conflict remains unsettled.&lt;ref name="CIDCM"&gt;[http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/mar/assessment.asp?groupId=37301 University of Maryland Center for International Development and Conflict Management.

===Azerbaijan SSR===
During Soviet rule, the question of Karabakh festered for Armenians. The Armenians of Karabakh made claims of economic neglect, charging that Azeri authorities with under-investment in the region in an attempt to keep it impoverished. In addition, Baku placed restrictions on cultural ties with Armenia. Tensions rose in the early 1960s, and in 1968 clashes erupted between Armenians and Azeris in [[Stepanakert]] (the capital of Nagorno-Karabakh). The Armenians feared that the Armenian character of Karabakh would disappear as it had in Nakhichevan over the decades, where the Armenian population had disappeared and all of the Armenian monuments were systematically removed and reportedly destroyed by the Azerbaijani authorities. In 1979, Nagorno-Karabakh had a 74% Armenian majority but received no Armenian television broadcasts and had no Armenian institution of higher learning&lt;ref name="CIDCM"/&gt;

According to Thomas De Wall:&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;de Waal, Thomas (2003). Black Garden: Armenia and Azerbaijan Through Peace and War. New York: New York University Press. {{ISBN|0-8147-1945-7}}.  pg 133&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|By 1979, the Armenians of Nakhicvhevan had declined to a level of 1 percent of the population, or three thousand people.  The Karabakh Armenians used the example of slow “de-Armenization” of Nakhichevan in the courrse of the twentieth century as an example what they feared would happen to them.}}

However, other evidence suggests that the Armenians lived in better conditions in [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] than Azerbaijanis. According to Yamskov,&lt;ref&gt;A.Yamskov. Ethnic Conflict in Transcaucasus: The Case of Nagorno-Karabakh. In Theory and Society, Vol. 20, No. 5, 1991, pp. 631-660&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|In Nagorno-Karabakh, for example, the social status of the Armenians in the enclave was higher than that of the Azeris inside and outside the territory.}}

The Soviet laws ensured that in Nagorno-Karabakh ''"party and state organs were staffed primarily by Armenians who not only ensured Armenian cultural autonomy with Armenian-language newspapers, schools, and arts but strengthened it"'' &lt;ref&gt;Audrey Alstatd. The Azerbaijani Turks : Power and Identity Under Russian Rule (Studies of Nationalities). Hoover Institution Press, 1992, p.126&lt;/ref&gt;

===1991 to present===
{{see also|Nagorno-Karabakh War}}

War soon broke out over Nagorno Karabakh and ended in 1994 with the Armenian separatists gaining control over the territory. Turkic nationalism is the leading force in Baku and has undoubtedly contributed to the conflict with the Armenians given the historical enmity between Armenians and Turkey.&lt;ref name="CIDCM"/&gt; All the major human rights monitors agreed that the status of Armenians, those married to or those who associate with Armenians, and those who are perceived to be sympathetic to Armenians, is extremely grave. There has also been numerous acts of vandalism against the Armenian Apostolic Church throughout Azerbaijan. The Armenians still remaining in Azerbaijan practically live in virtual hiding, and have also changed their Armenian names and surnames to Azerbaijani names and surnames because they have to maintain an extremely low profile to avoid harassment and physical attacks. They have continued to complain (in private due to fear of attacks) that they remain subject to harassmant and human rights violations and therefore have to hide their identity.&lt;ref&gt;"Implementation of the Helsinki Accords: Human Rights and Democratization in the Newly Independent States of the former Soviet Union" (Washington, DC: U.S. Congress, Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, January 1993), p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; Armenians and part Armenians living in Azerbaijan were reported as being refused permission to leave the country. They have also reported that the Department of Visas and Registrations took them off of the list of residents.&lt;ref name="USCIS"&gt;[http://www.uscis.gov/files/nativedocuments/azerba93.PDF Azerbaijan: The Status of Armenians, Russians, Jews and other Minorities]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1993 report from the American Embassy in Baku noted:&lt;ref name="USCIS"/&gt;

{{cquote|…those of mixed marriages cannot look to emigrate to Armenia since Azerbaijanis believe that they will be discriminated against just as Armenians are here, and because Yerevan Armenians [ethnic Armenians from Armenia] are openly hostile to Baku Armenians [ethnic Armenians from Azerbaijan], and most Azerbaijani Armenians have no ties to Russia.}}

According to a 1993 Department of Justice report:&lt;ref name="USCIS"/&gt;

{{cquote|It is clear that Armenians are the target of violence from societal forces and that the Azerbaijani government is unable or in some instances unwilling to control the violence or acts of discrimination and harassment. Some sectors of the government, such as the Department of Visas and Registrations mentioned above, appear unwilling to enforce the governments stated policy on minorities. As long as the Armenian-Azeri conflict over the fate of Karabakh continues, and possibly long after a settlement is reached, Armenian inhabitants of Azerbaijan will have no guarantees of physical safety.}}

Azerbaijan has been accused of embarking on a campaign beginning in 1998 to completely destroy the vast cemetery of medieval Armenian khachkar gravestones in the archeological site of [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (city)|Julfa]], [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]], an exclave of Azerbaijan.&lt;ref name= Pickman&gt;Pickman, Sarah.

Retrieved April 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Claims by Armenians that Azerbaijan had undertaken a systematic campaign to destroy and remove the monuments first arose in late 1998, and those charges were renewed in 2002 and again in December 2005 following the final destruction of the site.

Numerous appeals were filed by both Armenian and international organizations, condemning the Azerbaijani government and demanding it desist from such activity. In 2006, Azerbaijan barred [[European Parliament]] members from investigating the claims, charging them with a "biased and hysterical approach" to the issue and stating that it would only accept a delegation if it visited Armenian-controlled territory as well.&lt;ref name=TheIndependent&gt;Castle, Stephen.

According to European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) 2011 Report on Azerbaijan "the constant negative official and media discourse concerning the Republic of Armenia helps to sustain a negative climate of opinion regarding people of Armenian origin, who remain vulnerable to discrimination."&lt;ref name=ECRI2011&gt;{{cite web|title=ECRI REPORT ON AZERBAIJAN (fourth monitoring cycle)|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/ecri/Country-by-country/Azerbaijan/AZE-CbC-IV-2011-019-ENG.pdf|publisher=Council of Europe|accessdate=5 June 2011|author=European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI)|authorlink=European Commission against Racism and Intolerance|date=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kurds ==
{{main|Kurds in Azerbaijan}}
The presence of Kurds in Azerbaijan dates back to the 9th century. The area between [[Karabakh]] and [[Syunik Province|Zangezur]] became inhabited by nomadic Kurdish tribes in the early nineteenth century, when a new wave of Kurdish migrants numbering 600 families led by Mihamed Sefi Siltan moved to the [[Karabakh Khanate]] from Persia. A smaller number of them also moved here in 1885 from the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Дмитрий Пирбари.

There were some 41,000 Kurds residing in [[Azerbaijan]] during the [[Azerbaijan SSR|Soviet era]].&lt;ref name="iwpr"&gt;[http://iwpr.net/?p=crs&amp;s=f&amp;o=161108&amp;apc_state=henicrs2003 Rauf Orujev.

According to Thomas de Waal:&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

{{cquote| Smaller nationalities, such as Kurds, also complained of assimilation. In the 1920s, Azerbaijan's Kurds had their own region, known as Red Kurdistan, to the west of Nagorny Karabakh; in 1930, it was abolished and most Kurds were progressively recategorized as "Azerbaijani." A Kurdish leader estimates that there are currently as many as 200,000 Kurds in Azerbaijan, but official statistics record only about 12,000.}}

The geographical areas of concentration of Kurds in Azerbaijan were [[Kelbajar]], [[Lachin]], [[Qubadli]] and [[Zangilan]] districts, sandwiched between [[Armenia]] and the [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] region of [[Azerbaijan]]. In the course of [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]], these regions came under occupation of the Armenian forces.&lt;ref name="unscresolution"&gt;[https://www.state.gov/p/eur/rls/or/13508.htm "1993 UN Security Council Resolutions on Nagorno-Karabakh #822, #853, #874, and #884", Online Publication, U.S. Department of State website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117200012/http://www.state.gov/p/eur/rls/or/13508.htm |date=January 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Kurds along with the entire [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijani]] population of these regions were displaced to other parts of [[Azerbaijan]].&lt;ref name="unscresolution" /&gt;

By the 1920s, the Kurdish community in Azerbaijan was considerably diminished, when many of them moved to Armenia where Kurdish villages were created.&lt;ref name="World Cultures 1991 p.225"&gt;Encyclopedia of World Cultures, David Levinson, G.K. Hall &amp; Co. (1991), p.225&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, the Kurdish community in Azerbaijan was considerably diminished, when many of them moved to [[Armenia]] where Kurdish villages were created.&lt;ref name="World Cultures 1991 p.225"/&gt; About the same time Azerbaijan's Kurds had their own region called [[Kurdistan Uyezd|Red Kurdistan]] in the Lachin region, which was to the West of Karabakh. In fact, Lachin with the principal towns Kalbajar, Qubadli and [[Zangilan]] and the administrative sub-divisions of Karakushlak, Koturli, Murad-Khanli and Kurd-Haji were mostly inhabited by Kurds.&lt;ref&gt;The Kurds: A Contemporary Overview, Philip G. Kreyenbroek, Stefan Sperl, Routledge, (1992), {{ISBN|0-415-07265-4}}, p.201&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1930 it was abolished and most remaining Kurds were progressively recategorized as ''[[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijani]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Black Garden: Armenia and Azerbaijan Through Peace and War, Thomas De Waal, NYU Press, {{ISBN|0-8147-1945-7}}, p.133&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1930s Soviet authorities deported most of the Kurdish population of Azerbaijan and Armenia to [[Kazakhstan]], and Kurds of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] also became victims of [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]’s purges in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.hist.ru/kurdy.html Партизаны на поводке.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem is that the historical record of the Kurds in Azerbaijan is filled with lacunae.&lt;ref&gt;An Ethnohistorical Dictionary of the Russian and Soviet Empires, James Stuart Olson, Lee Brigance Pappas, Nicholas Charles Pappas, Greenwood Publishing Group, (1994), {{ISBN|0-313-27497-5}}, p.409&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in 1979 there was according to the census no Kurds recorded.&lt;ref name="th"&gt;The Kurds: A Contemporary Overview, Philip G. Kreyenbroek, Stefan Sperl, Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415-07265-4}}, (1992), p.204&lt;/ref&gt; Not only did Turkey and Azerbaijan pursue an identical policy against the Kurds, they even employed identical techniques like forced assimilation, manipulation of population figures, settlement of non-Kurds in areas predominantly Kurdish, suppression of publications and abolition of Kurdish as a medium of instruction in schools.&lt;ref name="th"/&gt; Kurdish historical figures such as Sharaf Khan of Bitlis and Ahmad Khani and the Shaddadid dynasty as a whole were described as Azeris.&lt;ref name="th"/&gt; Kurds who retained 'Kurdish' as their nationality on their internal passports as opposed to 'Azeri' were unable to find employment.&lt;ref name="th"/&gt;

==Talysh==
According to a 1926 census, there were 77,039 in [[Azerbaijan SSR]]. From 1959 to 1989, the Talysh were not included as a separate ethnic group in any census, but rather they were included as part of the Turkic-speaking Azerbaijani's, although the Talysh speak an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian language]]. In 1999, the Azerbaijani government claimed there were only 76,800 Talysh in Azerbaijan, but this is believed to be an under-representation given the problems with registering as a Talysh. Some claim that the population of the Talysh inhabiting the southern regions of Azerbaijan is 500,000.&lt;ref name="Hema"&gt;Hema Kotecha, Islamic and Ethnic Identities in Azerbaijan: Emerging trends and tensions, OSCE, Baku, July 2006 [http://www.osce.org/documents/ob/2006/08/23087_en.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Talysh nationalists have always asserted that the number of Talysh in Azerbaijan is substantially higher than the official statistics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cria-online.org/5_4.html Disputed number of Talysh in Azerbaijan]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NwvoM-ZFoAgC&amp;pg=PA674&amp;lpg=PA674&amp;dq=%22Talysh+nationalists%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=8aLgM9V1qo&amp;sig=_-x9bspkEfCVjmJDiavECJZAuKg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result Reasons for the dispute around the number of Talysh in Azerbaijan]: ''One Europe, Many Nations: A Historical Dictionary of European National Groups'', by James Minahan, Greenwood, 2000,
{{ISBN|0-313-30984-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-313-30984-7}}, p. 674 (viewable on [[Google Books]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Obtaining accurate statistics is difficult, due to the unavailability of reliable sources, intermarriage, and the decline of the [[Talysh language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =  Allegation of Minority Rights Violations in Azerbaijan | work = | publisher = http://www.washprofile.org/| date = | url = http://www.washprofile.org/en/node/6773 | format =| doi = | accessdate = 2007-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =  Talysh: Editor Arrested  | work = | publisher = http://www.unpo.org/| date = | url = http://www.unpo.org/article.php?id=6268 | format =| doi = | accessdate = 2007-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = AZERBAIJANI AUTHORITIES ACCUSED OF DISCRIMINATING AGAINST ETHNIC MINORITIES | work = | publisher = http://www.hri.org/| date = | url = http://www.hri.org/news/balkans/rferl/2007/07-07-11.rferl.html#11 | format =| doi = | accessdate = 2007-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  have voiced their concerns about the arrest of [[Novruzali Mamedov]], Chairman of the Talysh Cultural Centre and editor-in-chief of the "Tolyshi Sado" newspaper. 

===In Azerbaijan SSR===
The Talysh identity was strongly suppressed during Soviet times. In the early Soviet period, there were Talysh medium schools, a newspaper called "Red Talysh", and several Talysh language books published, but by end of the 1930s these schools were closed and the Talysh identity was not acknowledged in official statistics, with the Talysh being classified as "Azerbaijani".&lt;ref name="Hema" /&gt;

===From 1991 to present===
Historical repression of identity and the inability to practice their culture and language has led the Talysh to an internalized self repression.&lt;ref name="Hema" /&gt; This makes it hard to gauge support for any type of Talysh movement.&lt;ref name="Hema" /&gt; According to Hema Kotecha, many Talysh fear being associated with the separatist [[Talysh-Mughan Autonomous Republic]], with [[Russia]], or with [[Armenia]] if they acknowledged or attempted to talk about their beliefs in the public sphere. One instance of current repression was when a school in Lerik wanted to invite a poet from Lenkoran to have a party in his honor and for him to speak to Children; the headmaster was told that he would be dismessed if the event went ahead. The fear of the police is also another factor to this silence, although support for a secular democracy and shared Azerbaijani-Talysh feelings towards Nagorno-Karabakh contribute as well.&lt;ref name="Hema" /&gt;

==Lezgins==
Lezgins are the largest ethnic minority in [[Azerbaijan]]. The UNHCR states that Lezgins make up 40% of the populations of the [[Qusar]] and [[Khachmaz Rayon|Khachmaz]] regions and that Greater Baku is 1.8% Lezgin. Official Azerbaijani government statistics state that the Lezgin population is only 2% of the total population of the country, bringing the number to 178,000, however, this figure could be up to double. [[Arif Yunus]] suggests that the figure is closer to 250,000-260,000, while some Lezgin nationalists claim that they number more than 700,000. Qusar town is approximately 90 to 95% Lezgin according to the local NGO Helsinki Committee office.&lt;ref name="Hema" /&gt;

According to the Center for International Development and Conflict Management at the University of Maryland:&lt;ref name="CIDCM2"&gt;[http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/mar/assessment.asp?groupId=37302 University of Maryland Center for International Development and Conflict Management. Minorities at Risk: Assessment for Lezgins in Azerbaijan, Online Report, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Although many feared that Lezgin demands for the creation of an independent "[[Lezgistan]]" would result in another secessionist war in Azerbaijan, these fears have thus far proved to be unwarranted. It currently appears less likely than ever that the Lezgins will resort to any sustained collective action to address their grievances, although isolated incidents do occur. In the past eight years, they have not engaged in any serious protests and only two incidents of violence; they have also shown a willingness to negotiate and compromise on their most intractable demands. The Lezgin nationalist movements do not receive wide support among the Lezgin people who are not well-organized at the grass-roots level}}

According to Thomas de Waal:&lt;ref&gt;de Waal, Thomas (2003). Black Garden: Armenia and Azerbaijan Through Peace and War. New York: New York University Press. {{ISBN|0-8147-1945-7}}. pg 122&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|Although there are no discriminatory policies against them on the personal level, the Lezghins* campaign for national-cultural autonomy is vehemently rejected by the Azerbaijani authorities. Daghestani Lezghins fear that the continued existence of their ethnic kin in Azerbaijan as a distinct community is threatened by what they consider Turkic nationalistic policies of forceful assimilation.  Inter-ethnic tensions between Lezghins and Azeris spilled over from Azerbaijan to Daghestan also. They started in 1992 when the Popular Front came to power in Azerbaijan, but reached a peak in mid-1994, the time of heavy losses on the Karabakh front. In May that year violent clashes occurred in Derbent (Daghestan), and in June in the Gussary region of Azerbaijan. Since then the situation has stabilised, although Azerbaijani authorities allege a link between Lezghin activists and Karabakh Armenians and a cloud of suspicion surrounds the Lezghin community in Azerbaijan.}}

According to Svante E. Cornell:&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, Svante E. Small Nations and Great Powers : A Study of Ethnopolitical Conflict in the Caucasus. Richmond, Surrey,, GBR: Curzon Press Limited, 2000. p 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Where as officially the number of Lezgins registered as such in Azerbaijan is around 180,000 the Lezgins claim that the number of Lezgins registered in Azerbaijan is much higher than this figure, some accounts showing over 700,000 Lezgins in Azerbaijan.  These figures are denied by the Azerbaijani government, but in private many Azeris acknowledge the fact that the Lezgins – for that matter the Talysh or the Kurdish-population of Azerbaijan is far higher than the official figures...

For the Lezgins in Azerbaijan, the existence of ethnic kin in Dagestan is of high
importance. Nariman Ramazanov, one of the Lezgin political leaders, has argued
that whereas the Talysh, Tats, and Kurds of Azerbaijan lost much of their
language and ethnic identity, the Lezgins have been able to preserve theirs by
their contacts with Dagestan, where there was naturally no policy of Azeri
assimilation. 
….
The Lezgin problem remains one of the most acute and unpredictable of
the contemporary Caucasus. This said, the conditions for a peaceful resolution of
the conflict are present. No past conflict nor heavy mutual prejudices make
management of the conflict impossible; nor has ethnic mobilization taken place to
a significant extent. Hence there are no actual obstacles to a de-escalation of the
conflict at the popular level. At the political level, however, the militancy of
Sadval and the strict position of the Azeri government give cause for worry, and
may prevent the settlement of the conflict through a compromise such as a freetrading
zone. The Lezgin problem needs to be monitored and followed in closer
detail, and its continued volatility is proven by the tension surrounding a recent
Lezgin congress in Dagestan.}}

==Russians==
{{main|Russians in Azerbaijan}}

Russians are the second largest ethnic minority in [[Azerbaijan]] and is also the largest Russian community in the [[South Caucasus]] and one of the largest outside of [[Russia]].&lt;ref Name="ran02"&gt;[http://www.centrasia.ru/newsA.php?st=1222350780 Russian Community of Azerbaijan Celebrated 15th Anniversary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ran03"&gt;[http://www.russedina.org/frontend/former/azerbajan?id=15494 Russian community of Azerbaijan]&lt;/ref&gt; Since their arrival at the end of the eighteenth century, the Russians have played an important role in all spheres of life, particularly during the [[Russian Empire|Czarist]] and [[Azerbaijan SSR|Soviet period]], especially in the capital the city of [[Baku]].

The events of [[Black January]], the economic downturn, and the war with Armenia, coupled with growing pessimism and psychological discomfort, and pressure from the [[Deportation of Azerbaijanis from Armenia|Azerbaijani refugees from Armenia]] and [[Refugees and internally displaced persons in Azerbaijan|Azeri internally displaced persons from Nagorno-Karabakh and adjacent territories]], led to the exodus of Russian-speaking population of Azerbaijan. Between 1989 and 1999, the numbers of the Russian population fell from 392,000 to 142,000. As of 2009, the Russian population numbered 119,300 people.

A representative of the [[Molokan]] (ethnic Russian) community, in an interview on July 21, 2005, reported that there is no conflict between ethnic Russians and Azeris in Azerbaijan and that "there is no intolerance to the Russian language, culture or people" according to a parliamentary official. Similarly, Interfax News Service, on July 6, 2004, reported that a Russian Foreign Ministry representative stated, "We, [[Russians]], have no particular problems in Azerbaijan".&lt;ref name=IRBC/&gt;

{{see also|Azerbaijani Jews|Israel-Azerbaijan relations}}

==Foreign Interference==
Azerbaijan has claimed that neighboring countries - [[Armenia]], [[Iran]], and, to a lesser extent, [[Russia]] - support separatist sentiments in [[Azerbaijan]].

===Armenia===
In May 2005, [[Armenia]] organized the "First International Conference on Talysh Studies". The event was hosted by the Yerevan State University's Iranian Studies Department and the Yerevan-based Center for Iranian Studies in [[Armenia]]n resort town of Tsaghkadzor. According to [[Vladimir Socor]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://jamestown.org/edm/article.php?article_id=2369811 Vladimir Socor. "Talysh issue, dormant in Azerbaijan, reopened in Armenia", The Jamestown Foundation, May 27, 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930184901/http://jamestown.org/edm/article.php?article_id=2369811 |date=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Almost certainly, some political circles in Armenia were behind this initiative. The conference appeared designed at least in part to resurrect the issue of autonomy for the Talysh ethnic group in Azerbaijan. Such intentions draw inspiration from the would-be "Talysh-Mugan Republic," declared on June 21, 1993, in southeastern Azerbaijan by a group of ethnic Talysh officers under the leadership of Colonel Alikram Gumbatov. Their rebellion was correlated with a massive Armenian offensive on the Karabakh front and seizure of territories deep inside western Azerbaijan by Armenian forces. The Talysh rebels proclaimed the independence of a seven-district area in southeastern Azerbaijan, but did not elicit significant support among their own ethnic group.}}

In April 1996, Azerbaijan's National Security Ministry claimed that Armenian intelligence recruited and trained Armenian members of the Daghestan-based [[Lezgian people|Lezgin]] separatist organization "Sadval" who subsequently perpetrated a bomb attack on the [[Baku]] metro in March 1994 that killed 14 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2005/08/fc9ec058-6a3c-40d7-9eda-8e276ce7c044.html Liz Fuller. "Azerbaijan: Baku Implicates Armenian Intelligence In Alleged Coup Bid", Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, August 5, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iran===
According to Hema Kotecha:&lt;ref name="Hema" /&gt;

{{cquote|In the early years of independence, Iran took a paternalistic approach towards Azerbaijan, there were some ideas of integrating Azerbaijan to Iran and "Iran expected/pretended that Azerbaijan was a very unhappy place"... Stories about pressure put on Tehran by the US through sponsoring its minorities and dissenting groups increases its sense of insecurity and the pressure it puts on Baku not to support the US. Part of Iran’s leverage over Azerbaijan is [[Shi'a|religious]] influence over society and at moments of tension local observers say they perceive an increased involvement of "Iranian propaganda", Iran pulling on its strings of influence over people in the south.}}

===Russia===
In the northern regions of [[Azerbaijan]], [[Russia]] was reported to have linkage with Lezgin separatist movement:

{{cquote|It is frequently stated by the media and many local observers that both Armenia and Russia have interests in maintaining Sadval:the organisation is labelled as a ‘game’ used by Russia, Azerbaijan and internal Dagestani politics...By one of the founders of a Lezgin Democratic Party it was noted that ‘Lezgins have been pro-Russian (like the Armenians) since the 18th century.’ He emphasised that there is no particular leader for the Lezgins who might head a movement and that only outside organisations and people can channel their interests through Lezgins; Sadval have no particular source of financial support other than through external interests.}}

'''Female public intellectuals''' refers to [[woman|female]] [[intellectual]]s active within the [[public sphere]]. Although the term 'public intellectual' has traditionally remained non [[gender]] specific, it historically continues to be a role predominantly occupied by men.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,3604,1252059,00.htmll] Article by Laura Barton for the Guardian 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the intellectual history of women continues to be undervalued and discredited. There are a number of explanations for the lack of female public intellectuals as compared to their male counterparts. These explanations address issues such as [[institutionalized discrimination]] within the [[academy]], the problems which arise from female intellectuals who strongly advocate [[feminist]] [[ideology]] and [[theory]] and the impact of the [[Mass media|media]] and academy in the conceptualization of 'woman as her body'.

==Women and the Academy==
The traditional exclusion of women from the public sphere and from contributing to or initiating [[discourse]] as public intellectuals stems from the exclusion and discrimination of women within the academic field.

The origin of this discrimination lies in the power relations existing both in universities and other higher education establishments  that have facilitated the institutionalization of [[hegemonic masculinity]] concepts. This means that it is possible to identify the language, concepts, codes and conventions of academia as recognizably “a man’s world”,&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, V:"Transgression and the Academy:Feminists and Institutionalization", in  "Feminist Academics: Creative Agents for Change, Taylor and Francis, 1995, p.86&lt;/ref&gt; something which poses serious restrictions on women eager to establish both a professional and intellectual [[Identity (social science)|identity]].  Because universities essentially originated from all-male communities which for six hundred years sought specifically to exclude women from participation, the initial identification of [[knowledge]] was with men, a notion which still remains powerful and destructive for women [[academics]] today.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, V:"Transgression and the Academy:Feminists and Institutionalization", in  "Feminist Academics: Creative Agents for Change, Taylor and Francis, 1995, p.88.&lt;/ref&gt;

This association of men with knowledge is also an important consideration when explaining the absence of female public intellectuals. Women who struggle to establish a career in academia, (because their approach to and accumulation of knowledge may be viewed as less credible than that of their male counterparts) also inevitably struggle to carve out a career as a public intellectual for the same reason. This is because the process of being identified as intellectually able, making a reputation, [[mentoring]] and [[social network|networking]] tends to provide cumulative advantages to men and disadvantages to women.&lt;ref&gt;Heward, C: "Women and Careers in Higher Education", in "Breaking Boundaries:Women in Higher Education, Taylor and Francis, 1996, p.21.&lt;/ref&gt; The continuous privileging of men and hegemonic masculinities and devaluation of women and feminists has had cumulative effects on those who have succeeded in becoming senior academics and/or public intellectuals.

Considering that many public intellectuals also tend to emerge from an esteemed background in [[academia]], such as [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Richard Dawkins]], it is clear to see why women continue to struggle within the public intellectual sphere. In the academic profession, ‘The main currency….is reputation’ (Becher 1989, p.&amp;nbsp;52). Peer evaluation of intellectual work, theses, publications, conference papers and research applications is the basis of academic careers. Thus if men, in senior academic positions are judging the work of women who occupy less prestigious roles, it could be argued that the intellectual contributions of women to the academy may be subject to discrimination and male standards of approval, leading the work of women to be devalued.

This scenario is also applicable to public intellectuals, the most senior of whom have both the power and duty to evaluate and make judgement upon the work of their peers. Essentially,  the most successful public intellectuals, most commonly men, possess the power to control the careers of aspirants (often women) by evaluating their intellectual output, theses, papers, books and research applications.  However, if the same principles of hegemonic masculinity apply to the world of the public intellectual as they do to the academy, then there is usually only a limited opportunity for women to  use either their academic background as a springboard for establishing themselves as public intellectuals, or outside of the academy, to be recognised as a credible individual, with important things to say.

==Female public intellectuals and feminist ideology==
One theory as to why there is a notable lack of female public intellectuals is that by approaching their work from a distinctly [[feminist]] perspective many women intellectuals tend to alienate themselves from the wider public. [[Feminist theory]] often has a narrow focus dealing with themes such as [[discrimination]], [[stereotyping]], [[objectification]] (especially sexual objectification), [[oppression]] and [[patriarchy]] which despite their importance may only appeal to a small interest-group.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} In this case, female intellectuals arguing from an ideological feminist perspective fail to embody a primary characteristic of the public intellectual;  synthesizing disparate areas of [[knowledge]] for a broader lay audience.&lt;ref name="Parsi, K 2004"&gt;Parsi, K.P and K.E. Geraghty, (2004) "The Bioethicist as Public Intellectual." ''The American Journal of Bioethics'' 4(1):W17–W23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguing from a strictly feminist standpoint can lead female intellectuals to neglect engaging in debate upon a broad spectrum of topics; science, politics, high and low art, literature, evolution, the [[Iraq War]] and the origins of the universe are some examples.&lt;ref name="iwf.org"&gt;[http://www.iwf.org/news/show/18926.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021071642/http://iwf.org/news/show/18926.html |date=2007-10-21 }}. Article by Charlotte Allen for the Independent Women's Forum&lt;/ref&gt; However, women intellectuals can offer valuable perspective as they are able to offer a different examination of public discourse. Women's perspectives and histories are valuable contributions to not just women, but all whom are only acquainted with a bias cultural hegemony. Despite the odds, female intellectuals,  such as [[Germaine Greer]], [[Gloria Steinem]], [[Betty Friedan]], [[Barbara Ehrenreich]], [[Naomi Wolf]], [[Susan Faludi]], [[Deborah Tannen]], [[Mary Wollstonecraft]],  and [[Natalie Angier]], though this is hardly an exhaustive list, offer a different viewpoint and draw from their lived experiences as women.

The '''Gourmet Society''' is a UK-based dining club. Each member holds a Gourmet Society restaurant discount card, which entitles them to savings at UK restaurants.

Initially developed in the Midlands in 2003, the Gourmet Society was the UK's first national diners' club. Members pay an annual subscription, and receive discounts at participating restaurants. Members receive a discount card, and many members also receive a copy of the printed restaurant directory. 

As of May 2017, there are over 7,000 participating restaurants in the UK and Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gourmet Society|url=http://www.gourmetsociety.co.uk/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Gourmet Society Dining Card: Is it any good?|url=http://blogs.thisismoney.co.uk/2009/10/the-gourmet-society-dining-card-is-it-any-good.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gourmet Society members get either 2-for-1 meals; 50% off food; or 25% off their food and drink bill. Members also get access to discounted tickets at UK cinemas (up to 40% off), as well as access to discounts at UK retailers.

Membership is purchased through the website, and costs £69.99 for a year, although there are shorter trials available such as their £1 for 60 days trial and occasionally £34.99 yearly membership promotions. The Gourmet Society also works with other companies (including the [[The Automobile Association|AA]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The AA Dining Club|url=http://www.theaa.com/rewards/offers/gourmet-restaurant-club.jsp}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barclays]] and [[Nectar loyalty card|Nectar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gourmet Society Card {{!}} Spend Nectar Points|url=http://www.nectar.com/rewards/generalSearchOfferDetailsCatMain.nectar?ROM=ROM0009426}}&lt;/ref&gt; ) to provide users of their services with discounted memberships.

== Participating Restaurants ==

Participating restaurants include popular chains, independent venues, and AA Rosette and [[Michelin star]] venues. Michelin starred restaurants include [[Atul_Kochhar#Benares_Restaurant|Benares]] and JSW. Details of the offer and restrictions can be found on their website, in the printed restaurant guide and the smartphone app.

== Controversy ==

On 8th April, 2016 the Gourmet Society was featured on the [[BBC Radio 4]] programme [[You and Yours]]. It was claimed that some users who had taken a free introductory offer were charged the full annual fee earlier than they should have been. Criticism also centred around the poor customer service offered by Gourmet Society when customers tried to get some redress. Gourmet Society stated an understanding of the issue, and have changed their terms and conditions moving forwards to ensure that customers cannot be confused regarding their renewal date. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC Radio 4 You and Yours|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b075mf0j}}&lt;/ref&gt;

J. van Gerven|date=2014-06-03|publisher=punctum books|year=|isbn=9780692229149|location=|pages=203|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; are a group or [[dialect continuum]] of [[Nubian languages]] spoken by the [[Hill Nubians]] in the northern [[Nuba Mountains]] of [[Sudan]].

== Classification ==
The Hill Nubian languages are generally classified as being in the Central branch of the Nubian languages, one of three branches of the Nubian languages, the other two being Northern ([[Nile]]), consisting of [[Nobiin language|Nobiin]], and Western ([[Darfur]]), consisting of [[Midob language|Midob]]. They are grouped together with [[Kenzi language|Kenzi]]-[[Dongolawi language|Dongolawi]] (not seen to be closely related to Nobiin, despite their proximity) and [[Birgid language|Birgid]], a language of southwestern Sudan extinct since the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/subgroups/nubian|title=Nubian|work=Ethnologue|access-date=2017-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nubian lies within the [[Eastern Sudanic]] family, which is part of the [[Nilo-Saharan]] phylum.

== Languages ==
There are seven Hill Nubian languages, according to ''Ethnologue'' and Glottolog. Some of the languages have dialects. Their internal classification within Hull Nubian is not well established. Glottolog classifies Hill Nubian (Kordofan Nubian) into two branches: Eastern Kordofan Nubian and Western Kordofan Nubian, containing three and four languages respectively.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/kord1246|title=Glottolog 3.0 - Kordofan Nubian|last=|first=|date=|website=glottolog.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ethnologue'', however, only groups Kadaru and Ghulfan together, leaving the rest unclassified within Hill Nubian, as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/subgroups/hill|title=Hill|work=Ethnologue|access-date=2017-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Kadaru-Ghulfan
** [[Ghulfan language|Ghulfan]] (also Gulfan, Uncu, Uncunwee, Wunci, Wuncimbe) – 33,000 speakers
** [[Kadaru language|Kadaru]] (also Kadaro, Kadero, Kaderu, Kodhin, Kodhinniai, Kodoro, Tamya) – 25,000 speakers
* [[Dair language|Dair]] (also Dabab, Daier, Thaminyi) – 1,000 speakers
* [[Dilling language|Dilling]] (also Delen, Warkimbe, Warki) – 11,000 speakers
* [[El Hugeirat language|El Hugeirat]] (also El Hagarat) – 50 speakers
* [[Karko language (Sudan)|Karko]] (also Garko, Kaak, Karme, Kithonirishe, Kakenbi) – 7,000 speakers
* [[Wali language (Sudan)|Wali]] (also Walari, Walarishe, Wele) – 9,000 speakers
Additionally, one extinct language known only from a word list of 36 words, [[Haraza language|Haraza]], is unclassified within Hill Nubian.

[[Slavery]] has existed all throughout [[Asia]], and forms of slavery still exist today.

==Indian subcontinent==
{{Main article|Slavery in India}}

Slavery in India is evidenced since ancient times.&lt;ref name="Stein"&gt;B. Stein, D. Arnold. ''A History of India'', page 212 [https://books.google.com/books?id=0K3GZfqCabsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Burton+Stein%27s+History+of+India#v=onepage&amp;q=slavery&amp;f=false]. John Wiley and Sons, 2010, 444 pages. {{ISBN|1-4051-9509-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manu the Lawgiver, in his ''Manu Smriti'' lists seven different kinds of slaves.&lt;ref name="Stein"/&gt; The nature of slavery in India was extremely complex and cut across boundaries of caste, gender, kin, religion, and role.&lt;ref name="Stein"/&gt;

The early [[Muslim conquests|Arab invaders of Sind]] in the 8th century, the armies of the Umayyad commander [[Muhammad bin Qasim]], are reported to have enslaved tens of thousands of Indian prisoners, including both soldiers and civilians.&lt;ref&gt;Mirza Kalichbeg Fredunbeg, tr., The Chachnamah, an Ancient History of Sind, 1900, reprint (Delhi, 1979), pp. 154, 163. This thirteenth-century source claims to be a Persian translation of an (apparently lost) eighth-century Arabic manuscript detailing the Islamic conquests of Sind.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andre Wink, Al-Hind: the Making of the Indo-Islamic World, vol. 1, Early Medieval India and the Expansion of Islam, Seventh to Eleventh Centuries (Leiden, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 11th century Tarikh al-Yamini, the Arab historian [[Al-Utbi]] recorded that in 1001 the armies of [[Mahmud of Ghazna]] conquered [[Peshawar]] and [[Waihand]] (capital of Gandhara) after [[Battle of Peshawar (1001)|Battle of Peshawar]] (1001), "in the midst of the land of [[Hindustan]]", and captured some 100,000 youths.&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Qasim Firishta, Tarikh-i-Firishta (Lucknow, 1864).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andre Wink, Al-Hind: the Making of the Indo-Islamic World, vol. 2, The Slave Kings and the Islamic Conquest, 11th–13th centuries (Leiden, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Later, following his twelfth expedition into India in 1018–19, Mahmud is reported to have returned with such a large number of slaves that their value was reduced to only two to ten dirhams each. This unusually low price made, according to Al-Utbi, "merchants [come] from distant cities to purchase them, so that the countries of Central Asia, Iraq and Khurasan were swelled with them, and the fair and the dark, the rich and the poor, mingled in one common slavery". Elliot and Dowson refers to "five hundred thousand slaves, beautiful men and women.".&lt;ref&gt;Abu Nasr Muhammad al-Utbi, Tarikh al-Yamini (Delhi, 1847), tr. by James Reynolds, The Kitab-i-Yamini (London, 1858),&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wink, Al-Hind, II&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henry M. Elliot and John Dowson, History of India as told by its own Historians, 8 vols (London, 1867–77), II,&lt;/ref&gt; Later, during the [[Delhi Sultanate]] period (1206–1555), references to the abundant availability of low-priced Indian slaves abound. Levi attributes this primarily to the vast human resources of India, compared to its neighbors to the north and west (India's [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] population being approximately 12 to 20 times that of [[Turan]] and [[Iran]] at the end of the 16th century).&lt;ref&gt;Dale, Indian Merchants,&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Siddi]] are an ethnic group inhabiting [[India]] and [[Pakistan]]. Members are descended from [[Bantu peoples]] from [[Southeast Africa]] that were brought to the [[Indian subcontinent]] as slaves by [[Arab]] and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] merchants.&lt;ref name="Shah"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shah|first=Anish M.|title=Indian Siddis: African Descendants with Indian Admixture|journal=American Journal of Human Genetics|date=15 July 2011|volume=89|issue=1|pages=154–161|doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2011.05.030|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929711002230|accessdate=18 December 2012|display-authors=etal|pmid=21741027|pmc=3135801}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the northern and central parts of the subcontinent was ruled by the so-called [[Slave Dynasty]] of [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] origin from 1206 to 1290: [[Qutb-ud-din Aybak]], a slave of [[Muhammad Ghori]] rose to power following his master's death. For almost a century, his descendants ruled presiding over the introduction of Tankas and building of [[Qutub Minar]].

According to Sir [[Henry Bartle Frere]] (who sat on the Viceroy's Council), there were an estimated 8,000,000 or 9,000,000 slaves in India in 1841. In [[Malabar District|Malabar]], about 15% of the population were slaves. Slavery was officially abolished in India by the Indian Slavery Act V. of 1843. Provisions of the [[Indian Penal Code]] of 1861 effectively abolished slavery in India by making the enslavement of human beings a criminal offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-24160 |title=Slavery :: Britannica Concise Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24156 |title=Historical survey &gt; Slave-owning societies |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wluml.org/english/pubs/pdf/occpaper/OCP-07.pdf Islamic Law and the Colonial Encounter in British India]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429174400/http://www.wluml.org/english/pubs/pdf/occpaper/OCP-07.pdf |date=29 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=40A67F228E2C056228208BC3FD05D1C0.tomcat1?fromPage=online&amp;aid=126588 |title=Hindus Beyond the Hindu Kush: Indians in the Central Asian Slave Trade |doi=10.1017/S1356186302000329 |date=1 November 2002 |accessdate=4 December 2011 |volume=12 |journal=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society |pages=277–288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern times===
There are  an estimated five million bonded workers in [[Pakistan]], even though the government has passed laws and set up funds to eradicate the practice and rehabilitate the labourers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4042207.stm |title=Life as a modern slave in Pakistan |publisher=BBC News  |date=25 November 2004 |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As many as 200,000 [[Nepal]]i girls, many

==Afghanistan==
According to a report of an expedition to Afghanistan published in London in 1871:

:"The country generally between Caubul ([[Kabul]]) and the [[Oxus]] appears to be in a very lawless state; slavery is as rife as ever, and extends through [[Hazara, Pakistan|Hazara]], [[Badakshan]], [[Wakhan]], [[Tashkurgan Town|Sirikul]], Kunjūt ([[Hunza (princely state)|Hunza]]), &amp;c. A slave, if a strong man likely to stand work well, is, in Upper Badakshan, considered to be of the same value as one of the large dogs of the country, or of a horse, being about the equivalent of Rs 80. A slave girl is valued at from four horses or more, according to her looks &amp;c.; men are, however, almost always exchanged for dogs. When I was in Little Tibet ([[Ladakh]]), a returned slave who had been in the [[Kashmir]] army took refuge in my camp; he said he was well enough treated as to food &amp;c., but he could never get over having been exchanged for a dog, and constantly harped on the subject, the man who sold him evidently thinking the dog the better animal of the two. In Lower Badakshan, and more distant places, the price of slaves is much enhanced, and payment is made in coin."&lt;ref&gt;"Report of "The Mary's" Exploration from Caubul to Kashgar." T. G. Montgomerie. ''Journal of the Royal Geographical Society of London'', Vol. 41 (1871), p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the [[Hazara people|Hazara]] uprising of 1892, the Afghan Emir [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] declared a "[[Jihad]]" against the Shiites. His large army defeated the rebellion at its center, in [[Oruzgan]], by 1892 and the local population was being massacred. According to S. A. Mousavi, ''"thousands of Hazara men, women, and children were sold as slaves in the markets of Kabul and Qandahar, while numerous towers of human heads were made from the defeated rebels as a warning to others who might challenge the rule of the Amir"''. Until the 20th century, some Hazaras were still kept as slaves by the [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]]; although [[Amanullah Khan]] banned slavery in [[Afghanistan]] in the 1923 Constitution,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afghangovernment.com/Constitution1923.htm |title=Afghan Constitution: 1923 |publisher=Afghangovernment.com |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the practice carried on unofficially for many more years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afghanmagazine.com/2004_06/articles/hsadat.shtml |title=Afghan History: kite flying, kite running and kite banning By Mir Hekmatullah Sadat |publisher=Afghanmagazine.com |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==China==
{{Main article|Slavery in China}}
Slavery throughout pre-modern Chinese history has repeatedly come in and out of favor. Due to the enormous population and relatively high development of the region throughout most of its history, China has always had a large workforce.

===Tang Dynasty===

===Yuan Dynasty===
Many [[Han Chinese]] were enslaved in the process of the Mongols invasion of [[China proper]].&lt;ref&gt;Junius P. Rodriguez, "The Historical Encyclopedia of World Slavery", ABC-CLIO, 1997, pp146&lt;/ref&gt; According to Japanese historian Sugiyama Masaaki (杉山正明) and Funada Yoshiyuki (舩田善之), there were also certain number of Mongolian slaves owned by Han Chinese during the [[Yuan dynasty]]. Moreover, there is no evidence that Han Chinese, who were considered people of the bottom of Yuan society by some research, were suffered a particularly cruel abuse.&lt;ref&gt;杉山正明《忽必烈的挑战》，社会科学文献出版社，2013年，第44-46頁&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;船田善之《色目人与元代制度、社会－－重新探讨蒙古、色目、汉人、南人划分的位置》,〈蒙古学信息〉2003年第2期&lt;/ref&gt;

===Qing Dynasty===
{{Main article|Booi Aha}}
In the 17th century [[Qing Dynasty]], there was a hereditarily servile people called ''Booi Aha'' (Manchu:booi niyalma; Chinese transliteration: 包衣阿哈), which is a Manchu word literally translated as "household person" and sometimes rendered as "[[nucai]]".

In his book ''China Marches West'', Peter C. Perdue stated:"In 1624(After [[Nurhachi]]'s invasion of [[Liaodong]]) "Chinese households....while those with less were made into slaves."&lt;ref name="China Marches West" /&gt; The Manchu was establishing close personal and paternalist relationship between masters and their slaves, as Nurhachi said, "The Master should love the slaves and eat the same food as him".&lt;ref&gt;A History of Chinese Civilization&lt;/ref&gt; Perdue further pointed out that booi aha "did not correspond exactly to the Chinese category of "bond-servant slave" (Chinese:奴僕); instead, it was a relationship of personal dependency on a master which in theory guaranteed close personal relationships and equal treatment, even though many western scholars would directly translate "booi" as "bond-servant" (some of the "booi" even had their own servant).&lt;ref name="China Marches West"&gt;{{Cite book|last= Perdue|first= Peter |title=China Marches West |publisher=# Publisher: Triliteral |date= Pub.

;Various classes of Booi
# ''booi niru'' a Manchu word (Chinese:包衣佐領), meaning Neiwufu Upper Three Banner's platoon leader of about 300 men .
# ''Booi guanlin'' a Manchu word (Chinese:包衣管領), meaning the manager of ''booi'' doing all the domestic duties of Neiwufu.
# ''Booi amban'' is also a Manchu word, meaning high official, (Chinese:包衣大臣).
# ''Estate bannerman'' (Chinese:庄头旗人) are those renegade Chinese who joined the Jurchen, or original civilians-soldiers working in the fields. These people were all turned into ''booi aha'', or field slaves.

Here are two accounts of slavery given by two Westerners in the late 19th century and early 20th century:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"In the houses of wealthy citizens, it is not unusual to find twenty to thirty slaves attending upon a family. Even citizens in the humbler walks of life deem it necessary to have each a slave or two. The price of a slave varies, of course, according to age, health, strength, and general appearance. The average price is from fifty to one hundred dollars, but in time of war, or revolution, poor parents, on the verge of starvation, offer their sons and daughters for sale at remarkably low prices. I remember instances of parents, rendered destitute by the marauding bands who invested the two southern ''Kwangs'' in 1854–55, offering to sell their daughters in Canton for five dollars apiece. . . .

The slavery to which these unfortunate persons are subject, is perpetual and hereditary, and they have no parental authority over their offspring. The great-grandsons of slaves, however, can, if they have sufficient means, purchase their freedom. . . .

Masters seem to have the same uncontrolled power over their slaves that parents have over their children. Thus a master is not called to account for the death of a slave, although it is the result of punishment inflicted by him."&lt;ref&gt;Gray, John Henry. (1878). ''China: A History of the Laws, Manners and Customs of the People'', pp. 241–243. Reprint: Dover Publications, Mineola, New York. (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"In former times slaves were slain and offered in sacrifice to the spirit of the owner when dead, or by him to his ancestors: sometimes given as a substitute to suffer the death penalty incurred by his owner or in fulfilment of a vow. It used to be customary in Kuei-chou (and Szü-chuan too, I believe) to inter living slaves with their dead owners; the slaves were to keep a lamp burning in the tomb....

"Slavery exists in China, especially in Canton and Peking.... It is a common thing for well-to-do people to present a couple of slave girls to a daughter as part of her marriage dowery [sic]. Nearly all prostitutes are slaves. It is, however, customary with respectable people to release their slave girls when marriageable. Some people sell their slave girls to men wanting a wife for themselves or for a son of theirs.

"I have bought three different girls: two in Szü-chuan for a few taels each, less than fifteen dollars. One I released in Tientsin, another died in Hongkong; the other I gave in marriage to a faithful servant of mine. Some are worth much money at Shanghai."&lt;ref&gt;[[William Mesny]]. (13 May 1905). ''Mesny's Miscellany'', Vol IV, p. 399.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Modern times===
All forms of slavery have been illegal in China since 1910,&lt;ref&gt;Commemoration of the Abolition of Slavery Project&lt;/ref&gt; although the practice still exists through illegal trafficking in some areas.&lt;ref&gt;"Chinese Police Find Child Slaves."&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1930s and 1940s the [[Yi people]] (also known as Nuosu) of China terrorized Sichuan to rob and enslave non-Nuosu including [[Han people]]. The descendants of the Han Chinese slaves are the White Yi (白彝) and they outnumber the Black Yi (黑彝) aristocracy by ten to one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ramsey|first1=S.

==Japan==
{{Main article|Slavery in Japan}}

Slavery in Japan was, for most of its history, indigenous, since the export and import of slaves was restricted by Japan being a group of islands. The export of a slave from Japan is recorded in a 3rd-century Chinese document, although the system involved is unclear. These people were called {{Nihongo|''seiko''|生口}}, lit. "living mouth". "Seiko" from historical theories are thought to be as prisoner, slave, a person who has technical skill and also students studying abroad to China.&lt;ref&gt;[[:ja:生口]]{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 8th century, a slave was called {{Nihongo|''nuhi''|奴婢}} and a series of laws on slavery was issued. In an area of present-day [[Ibaraki Prefecture]], out of a population of 190,000, around 2,000 were slaves; the proportion is believed to have been even higher in western Japan.

Slavery persisted into the [[Sengoku period]] (1467–1615), but the attitude that slavery was anachronistic had become widespread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Nelson  | first =Thomas  | title =Slavery in Medieval Japan   | journal = [[Monumenta Nipponica]] | volume =59  | year =2004  | issue =4  | pages =463–492  | jstor =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oda Nobunaga]] is said to have had an African slave or former-slave in his retinue.&lt;ref&gt;Leupp, Gary P.

In 1595, Portugal passed a law banning the selling and buying of Chinese and Japanese slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dias|2007|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; but forms of contract and indentured labor persisted alongside the period penal codes' forced labor. Somewhat later, the Edo period penal laws prescribed "non-free labor" for the immediate family of executed criminals in Article 17 of the ''Gotōke reijō'' (Tokugawa House Laws), but the practice never became common. The 1711 ''Gotōke reijō'' was compiled from over 600 statutes promulgated between 1597 and 1696.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, James Bryant. (2003).

===World War II===
As the [[Empire of Japan]] annexed Asian countries, from the late 19th century onwards, archaic institutions including slavery were abolished in those countries. However, during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and the [[Pacific War]], the Japanese military used millions of civilians and [[prisoners of war]] as forced labor, on projects such as the [[Burma Railway]].

According to a joint study by historians including Zhifen Ju, Mitsuyoshi Himeta, Toru Kubo and [[Mark Peattie]], more than 10 million Chinese civilians were mobilized by the ''[[East Asia Development Board|Kōa-in]]'' (Japanese Asia Development Board) for forced labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~asiactr/sino-japanese/minutes_2002.htm |title=Japan's Atrocities of Conscripting and Abusing North China Draftees after the Outbreak of the Pacific War |author=Ju Zhifen |year=2002 |work=Joint study of the Sino-Japanese war }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Japanese military's own record, nearly 25% of 140,000 Allied [[POWs]] died while interned in Japanese prison camps where they were forced to work (U.S. POWs died at a rate of 37%).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080207230309/http://www.japantoday.com/jp/book/115 How Japanese companies built fortunes on American POWs] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/bataan/peopleevents/e_atrocities.html |title=Japanese Atrocities in the Philippines |publisher=Pbs.org |date=14 December 1944 |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 100,000 civilians and POWs died in the construction of the [[Death Railway|Burma-Siam Railway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mansell.com/pow_resources/links.html |title=Links for research, Allied POWs under the Japanese |publisher=Mansell.com |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Library of Congress estimates that in [[Java (island)|Java]], between 4 and 10 million ''[[romusha]]'' (Japanese: "manual laborer"), were forced to work by the Japanese military.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+id0029) Library of Congress, 1992, "Indonesia: World War II and the Struggle For Independence, 1942–50; The Japanese Occupation, 1942–45"] Access date: 9 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; About 270,000 of these Javanese laborers were sent to other Japanese-held areas in South East Asia.

Approximately 5,400,000 [[Koreans]] were conscripted into labor from 1944 to 1945 by the [[National Mobilization Law]]. About 670,000 of them were brought to Japan, where about 60,000 died between 1939 and 1945 due mostly to exhaustion or poor working conditions.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Many of those taken to [[Karafuto Prefecture]] (modern-day [[Sakhalin]]) were trapped there at the end of the war, stripped of their nationality and denied repatriation by Japan; they became known as the [[Sakhalin Koreans]].&lt;ref name="Lankov"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Lankov|first=Andrei|publisher=The Korea Times|date=5 January 2006|accessdate=26 November 2006|title=Stateless in Sakhalin|url=http://times.hankooki.com/lpage/opinion/200601/kt2006010516434554130.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total deaths of Korean forced laborers in Korea and [[Manchuria]] for those years is estimated to be between 270,000 and 810,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first=R.

==Korea==
{{main article|Slavery in Korea}}
The [[Joseon]] dynasty of Korea was a hierarchical society that consisted of social classes. [[Cheonmin]], the lowest class, included occupations such as butchers, shamans, prostitutes, entertainers, and also members of the slave class known as ''nobi''. Low status was hereditary, but members of higher classes could be reduced to cheonmin as a form of legal punishment. During poor harvests and [[famine]], many peasants voluntarily sold themselves into the nobi class in order to survive.&lt;ref name="seoul"&gt;{{cite web|first1=Young-hoon|last= Rhee|first2=Donghyu|last2= Yang|title=Korean Nobi in American Mirror: Yi Dynasty Coerced Labor in Comparison to the Slavery in the Antebellum Southern United States|url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/snu/ioerwp/no26.html |work=Working Paper Series |publisher=Institute of Economic Research, Seoul National University}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nobi were socially indistinct from freemen other than the ruling [[yangban]] class, and some possessed property rights, legal entities and civil rights.

In [[Siam]] (Thailand), the [[POW|war captives]] became the property of the king. During the reign of [[Rama III]] (1824–1851), there were an estimated 46,000 war slaves. Slaves from independent hill populations were ''"hunted incessantly and carried off as slaves by the Siamese, the Anamites, and the Cambodians"'' (Colquhoun 1885:53).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kyotoreviewsea.org/slavery4.htm |title=Slavery in Nineteenth-Century Northern Thailand |publisher=Kyotoreviewsea.org |accessdate=4 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009132129/http://kyotoreviewsea.org/slavery4.htm |archivedate=9 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery was not abolished in Siam until 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thailandsworld.com/index.cfm?p=213 |title=The Kingdom of Ayutthaya |publisher=Thailandsworld.com |accessdate=4 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080721192404/http://www.thailandsworld.com/index.cfm?p=213# |archive-date=21 July 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yi people]] in Yunnan practiced a complicated form of slavery. People were split into the Black Yi (nobles, 7% of the population), White Yi (commoners), Ajia (33% of the Yi population) and the Xiaxi (10%). Ajia and Xiaxi were slave castes. The White Yi were not slaves but had no freedom of movement. The Black Yi were famous for their slave-raids on [[Han Chinese]] communities. After 1959 some 700,000 slaves were freed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.istp.murdoch.edu.au/ISTP/casestudies/Case_Studies_Asia/tour_yi/tour_yi.html |title=The Yi Nationality |publisher=Istp.murdoch.edu.au |date=3 October 1999 |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://yi.peoples.org/learn/profiles/general.htm General Profile of the Yi]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203101749/http://yi.peoples.org/learn/profiles/general.htm |date=3 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/e-groups/shaoshu/shao-2-yi.htm |title=The Yi ethnic minority |publisher=China.org.cn |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slaves in [[Toraja]] society in [[Indonesia]] were family property. Sometimes Torajans decided to become slaves when they incurred a debt, pledging to work as payment. Slaves could be taken during wars, and slave trading was common. Torajan slaves were sold and shipped out to [[Java]] and [[Siam]]. Slaves could buy their freedom, but their children still inherited slave status. Slaves were prohibited from wearing bronze or gold, carving their houses, eating from the same dishes as their owners, or having sex with free women—a crime [[capital punishment|punishable by death]]. Slavery was [[abolitionism|abolished]] in 1863 in all Dutch colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stampslandia.webng.com/gallery2/niz/niz_old.htm |title=Stamps |publisher=Stamslandia.webng.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922042728/http://stampslandia.webng.com/gallery2/niz/niz_old.htm |archivedate=22 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/East-Southeast-Asia/Toraja-History-and-Cultural-Relations.html |title=Toraja History and Cultural Relations |publisher=Everyculture.com |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slavery was practiced by the tribal [[Austronesian peoples]] in [[History of the Philippines (900–1521)|pre-Spanish Philippines]]. Slaves were part of the lowest caste (''[[alipin]]'') in ancient Filipino societies. A caste which also included commoners. However, the characterization of ''alipin'' as "slaves" is not entirely accurate. Modern scholars in Philippine history prefer to use more accurate terms like "[[serf]]s" or "[[peon|bondsmen]]" instead.&lt;ref name="scott2"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Henry Scott|title =Barangay: sixteenth-century Philippine culture and society|publisher =Ateneo de Manila University Press|year =1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Garay warships of pirates in the Sulu Sea.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[Garay (ship)|Garay]]'' pirate ships in the [[Sulu Sea]], c. 1850]]
Slavery in Southeast Asia reached its peak in late 18th and early 19th centuries, when fleets of ''[[lanong]]'' and ''[[garay (ship)|garay]]'' warships of the [[Iranun people|Iranun]] and [[Banguingui]] people started engaging in [[piracy in the Sulu Sea|piracy and coastal raids]] for slave and plunder throughout Southeast Asia from their territories within the [[Sultanate of Sulu]] and [[Sultanate of Maguindanao|Maguindanao]]. It is estimated that from 1770 to 1870, around 200,000 to 300,000 people were enslaved by Iranun and Banguingui slavers. They came from ships and settlements as far as the [[Malacca Strait]], [[Java]], the southern coast of [[China]] and the islands beyond the [[Makassar Strait]]. The scale was so massive that the word for "pirate" in [[Malay language|Malay]] became ''Lanun'', an [[exonym]] of the Iranun people.  Male captives of the Iranun and the Banguingui were treated brutally, even fellow Muslim captives were not spared. They were usually forced serve as [[galley slave]]s on the ships of their captors. Female captives, however, were usually treated better. There were no recorded accounts of rapes, though some were starved for discipline. Most of the slaves were [[Tagalogs]], [[Visayans]], and "Malays" (including [[Bugis]], [[Mandarese people|Mandarese]], [[Iban people|Iban]], and [[Makassar people|Makassar]]). There were also occasional European and [[Chinese people|Chinese]] captives who were usually ransomed off through [[Tausug people|Tausug]] intermediaries of the [[Sulu Sultanate]].&lt;ref name="warren2"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Francis Warren|title =Iranun and Balangingi: Globalization, Maritime Raiding and the Birth of Ethnicity|publisher =NUS Press|year =2002|pages=53&amp;ndash;56|isbn =9789971692421|url =https://nuspress.nus.edu.sg/products/iranun-and-balangingi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

European powers finally succeeded in the mid-1800s in cutting off these raids through use of steam-powered warships.&lt;ref name="mck"&gt;Thomas H. McKenna, ''Muslim Rulers and Rebels'', University of California Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="warren3"&gt;James Francis Warren, "[https://web.archive.org/web/20141216235524/http://repository.cc.sophia.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/123456789/15569/1/200000079942_000127000_303.pdf The Port of Jolo and the Sulu Zone Slave Trade]", ''The Journal of Sophia Asian Studies No. 25'', 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Singapore]] in 1891 there was a regular trade in Chinese slaves by Muslim slaveowners, with girls and women sold for concubinage.&lt;ref&gt;S.Hurgronje, Verspreide Geschriften (Bonn, 1923), II, II ff&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Library of Congress estimates that in Java, between 4 and 10 million [[romusha]] (Japanese: "manual laborer") were forced to work by the Japanese military in [[World War II]]. About 270,000 of these Javanese laborers were sent to other Japanese-held areas in South East Asia. Only 52,000 were repatriated to Java, meaning that there was a death rate of 80%.

Within the [[Asia-Pacific]] region, there were as of 2015 an estimated 11.7 million trafficked people; within the Asia Pacific, the [[Greater Mekong Subregion]] (GMS), which includes [[Cambodia]], [[China]], [[Laos]], [[Burma]] (Myanmar), [[Thailand]] and [[Vietnam]], "features some of the most extensive flows of migration and human trafficking."&lt;ref name="SEAsiaStruggle"&gt;[http://www.dw.com/en/why-southeast-asia-struggles-to-tackle-modern-day-slavery/a-18371333 Why Southeast Asia struggles to tackle modern-day slavery], [[Deutsche Welle]] (April 9, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Industries with major problems with human trafficking and forced labor in Southeast Asia include [[fisheries industry|fisheries]], agriculture, manufacturing, construction and [[Domestic worker|domestic work]].&lt;ref name="SEAsiaStruggle"/&gt; The child sex trade has also plagued southeast Asia, where "[m]ost sources agree that far more than 1 million underage children are 'effectively enslaved'" as of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Weekend Edition Saturday]]|publisher=NPR|title=Tracking the Child Sex Trade in Southeast Asia|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5201813|date=February 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crimean Khanate==

In the time of the [[Crimean Khanate]], Crimeans engaged in frequent raids into the [[Danubian principalities]], [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland-Lithuania]], and [[Muscovy]]. For each captive, the khan received a fixed share (savğa) of 10% or 20%. The campaigns by Crimean forces categorize into "sefers", officially declared military operations led by the khans themselves, and ''çapuls'', raids undertaken by groups of noblemen, sometimes illegally because they contravened treaties concluded by the khans with neighbouring rulers. For a long time, until the early 18th century, the khanate maintained a massive [[Slave Trade]] with the Ottoman Empire and the Middle East. [[Caffa]] was one of the best known and significant trading ports and slave markets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24157 Historical survey &gt; Slave societies]&lt;/ref&gt; Crimean Tatar raiders enslaved more than 1 million Eastern Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Galina I.

'''[[Peru]]''' is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to [[human trafficking|trafficking]] in persons, specifically [[forced labor]] and forced [[prostitution]]. Several thousand persons are estimated to be subjected to conditions of forced labor within Peru, mainly in [[mining]], [[logging]], [[agriculture]], brick making, and domestic servitude. Many trafficking victims are women and girls from impoverished rural regions of the [[Amazon basin|Amazon]], recruited and coerced into prostitution in urban [[nightclub]]s, bars, and [[brothel]]s, often through false employment offers or promises of [[education]]. Indigenous persons are particularly vulnerable to debt bondage. Forced child labor remains a problem, particularly in informal [[gold mine]]s, [[cocaine]] production, and transportation. There were reports the [[terrorism|terrorist]] group Sendero Luminoso, or Shining Path, recruited children as soldiers and drug mules. To a lesser extent, Peruvians are subjected to forced prostitution in [[Ecuador]], [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], and the [[United States]], and forced labor in [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], and [[Brazil]]. Peru also is a destination country for some Ecuadorian and [[Bolivia]]n females in forced prostitution, and some Bolivian citizens in conditions of forced labor. Child sex tourism is present in [[Iquitos]], [[Madre de Dios Region, Peru|Madre de Dios]], and [[Cuzco]]. Traffickers reportedly operate with impunity in certain regions where there is little or no government presence.&lt;ref name=dos&gt;"Peru". [https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2010/142761.htm ''Trafficking in Persons Report 2010'']. [[U.S. Department of State]] (June 14, 2010). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Government of Peru does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. Last year, the government increased law enforcement efforts against trafficking crimes and maintained public awareness initiatives. However, the government failed to provide adequate victim services and made insufficient efforts to address the high incidence of labor trafficking in the country.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt; U.S. State Department's [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] placed the country in [[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|"Tier 2"]]  in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2017/271117.htm|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2017: Tier Placements|website=www.state.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prosecution==
The Government of Peru improved efforts to combat human trafficking through [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] last year. Law 28950 prohibits all forms of trafficking in persons, prescribing penalties of eight to 25 years’ imprisonment depending on the circumstances. These penalties are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as [[rape]]. During the reporting period, police investigated 137 trafficking cases; of these, 34 involved forced labor and 103 involved sex trafficking, with a total of 185 reported victims. Authorities brought forth 78 trafficking cases to the judiciary and secured the convictions of nine sex trafficking offenders, who received sentences ranging from three to 30 years’ imprisonment, in addition to fines. In comparison, Peruvian authorities prosecuted 54 cases and convicted five sex trafficking offenders the previous year. However, there were very few prosecutions and no convictions reported for forced labor offenses, despite an estimated high incidence of forced labor in the country. The government’s dedicated anti-trafficking police unit consisted of approximately 30 officers.

Police maintained and expanded the use of an electronic case tracking system for human trafficking investigations, although this system did not track judicial activity, such as prosecutions and convictions. Corruption among low-level officials enabled trafficking in certain instances, and individual police officers tolerated the operation of unlicensed brothels and the prostitution of children. No investigations or allegations of official complicity with trafficking activity were reported last year. The government provided training on human trafficking to law enforcement officials, [[immigration]] officials, diplomats, and legal officials, among others. The government collaborated with foreign governments on anti-trafficking initiatives and investigations.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Protection==
The government provided limited assistance to trafficking victims last year. The government did not employ a formal mechanism for identifying trafficking victims among vulnerable populations, such as adult women in prostitution. While the government had no formal process for referring trafficking victims for treatment, authorities could refer child victims of trafficking to government-operated children’s homes for basic shelter and care, two of which provide specialized care to victims of commercial sexual exploitation. Similarly, the government operated general shelters for adult female victims of abuse, which some trafficking victims accessed during the reporting period. [[Non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs) provided care to sexually exploited women; however, specialized services and shelter for trafficking victims remained largely unavailable. The government did not provide financial assistance to anti-trafficking NGOs, though it provided in-kind support; adequate victim services remained unavailable in many parts of the country.

Foreign victims had access to the same services as Peruvian victims. Last year, Peruvian authorities identified 185 trafficking victims, 159 women and 26 men{{spaced ndash}}though the number of victims in the country is thought to be much higher{{spaced ndash}}and provided 19 of these victims with legal, social, and psychological services. Some trafficking victims were not advised of their rights or provided with medical treatment, and some police officers released them without recognizing their victim status or referring them to shelters; some of these victims ended up returning to brothels in search of shelter and food.

Lack of victim participation in the investigation or prosecution of traffickers remained a problem, in addition to the lack of a witness protection program. Some victims may not have pursued legal redress because they could not afford legal representation. The government did not penalize victims for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked. Trafficking victims were eligible for temporary and permanent residency status under Peruvian [[refugee]] law, and at least 11 victims were granted such permanent residency. During the year, authorities assisted foreign trafficking victims with voluntary repatriation. Many of the country’s 412 labor inspectors have received training on forced labor; in 2009, the government created an elite team of five inspectors to address forced labor in the Amazon, but the team found their budget was insufficient to complete the mission.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Prevention==
The Government of Peru sustained anti-trafficking prevention efforts. The government maintained an anti-trafficking campaign and operated and promoted a hotline for trafficking-related crimes and information, which received 44 reports of trafficking in 2009. The government continued to air anti-trafficking videos in transportation hubs, warning travelers of the legal consequences of engaging in trafficking activity or consuming services from trafficked persons. Although some areas of the country are known [[child sex tourism]] destinations and Peruvian laws prohibit this practice, there were no reported convictions of child sex tourists. The government trained 710 government officials and tourism service providers about child sex tourism, conducted a public awareness campaign on the issue, and reached out to the tourism industry to raise awareness about child sex tourism; to date, 60 businesses have signed code of conduct agreements nationwide. No efforts to reduce demand for commercial sex acts or forced labor were reported. The government provided Peruvian peacekeepers with [[human rights]] training prior to deployment.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;
In October 2011, almost 300 women and young girls were rescued from sexual exploitation in a raid in an [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]]ian region of Peru known as a [[gold mining]] hub.&lt;ref name="latin-america-15165339"&gt;{{cite news

'''Indians in the Netherlands''' are residents of [[India]]n origin in the [[Netherlands]]. Most of the people of Indian descent in the Netherlands are of [[Indo-Surinamese]] origin. More recently the flow of [[Expatriate|expats]] from India has increased.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

== Background ==
After the Dutch government signed [[Anglo-Dutch Treaties of 1870-1871|a treaty with the United Kingdom on the recruitment of contract workers]], the Indians began migrating to [[Suriname]] in 1873 from what was then [[British Raj|British India]] as [[indenture]]d labourers, many from the modern-day Indian states of [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Bihar]] and the surrounding regions. Just before and just after the independence of Suriname on 25 November 1975 many Indo-Surinamese emigrated to the Netherlands, mainly because of the uncertain future that awaited them. A large part of this population was against the detachment of the Netherlands.

==Statistics==

In December 2001 the High Level Committee on Indian Diaspora estimated the population of [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|PIO's and Indian citizens]] at 215,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indiandiaspora.nic.in/contents.htm Report of the High Level Committee on the Indian Diaspora] December 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Dutch governmental institution [[Statistics Netherlands]] (CBS), in January 2016, 32,682 people had their origin from immigrants from India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://statline.cbs.nl/Statweb/publication/?DM=SLEN&amp;PA=37325eng&amp;D1=a&amp;D2=0&amp;D3=0&amp;D4=0&amp;D5=101&amp;D6=13-20&amp;LA=EN&amp;VW=T |title=CBS StatLine - Population; sex, age, origin and generation, 1 January |work=statline.cbs.nl |accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[List of diplomatic missions of India#Europe|Embassy of India]] states that the Netherlands has the "second largest population of people of Indian origin in Europe (next only to UK)" and that it is "home to about 220,000 Indian and Surinamese Hindustani Diaspora."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianembassy.nl/eoi.php?id=Community Embassy of India: Indian Community in Netherlands].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[NICCT|Netherlands India Chamber of Commerce &amp; Trade]] (NICCT) states the there are about 25,000 Indians or persons of Indian origin, excluding the Surinamese Hindustanis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nicct.nl/wp-content/uploads/Growing-Indian-Community-in-the-Netherlands.pdf NICCT: Growing Indian Community in The Netherlands].&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently there are more than 120,000 Indo-Surinamese living in the Netherlands, of which the majority, about 50,000, in [[The Hague]] and surroundings.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The '''Koreshan Unity''' was a communal [[utopia]] formed by [[Cyrus Teed]], who took the name "Koresh", the original [[Persian language|Persian]] form of his name [[Cyrus (name)|Cyrus]].  The Koreshans followed Teed's beliefs, called [[Koreshanity]].

The Koreshan Unity started in the 1870s in [[New York City|New York]], where Teed started preaching his beliefs. He formed short-lived groups in New York City and Moravia. He later moved to [[Chicago]]. Teed's followers formed a [[commune (intentional community)|commune]] in [[Chicago]] in 1888 called Beth-Ophra.  Some followers also formed a short-lived community in [[San Francisco]] (1891-2). Small church groups existed in other towns.

==Membership levels==
There was a tri-level system of membership.  
*The outer level was made up of non-believers who were willing to work for the Unity.  This group was called the Patrons of Equation, and allowed for marriage and participation in the secular aspects of the unity.  
*The middle group, the Department of Equitable Administration, allowed for marriage, but sexual relationships were only to be for the purpose of reproduction.  
*The inner, core, group (called The Pre-Eminent Unity) was the [[Celibate]] and [[Communal]] group, which did not allow marriage and practiced [[celibacy]].    
Within each of these three levels were three distinct branches, the Secular System, the Commercial System, and the Educational System, with a total of nine groups.

==Community==
Eventually, Teed took his followers to [[Estero, Florida]], to form his "[[New Jerusalem]]" in 1894.  The community was at its peak 1903&amp;ndash;1908, when it had over 250 residents.  There were apparently another 4,000 believers around the country. Teed had a vision in which he was to establish a utopian city of 10,000,000 with streets up to {{convert|400|ft|m}} wide. Membership declined following his death in 1908.

The group built extensively, establishing a bakery, printing house (publishing their newspaper and other publications), the "[[World College of Life]]", a general store, concrete works, power plant (supplying power to the surrounding area years before it was available elsewhere in the region) and more.  The colony was extensively landscaped.  There has been work to document and preserve the grounds in Estero (a [[Florida State Parks|Florida State Park]].)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ghosttowns.com/states/fl/koreshan.html Old Koreshan settlement.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political party==
In 1906, the community formed the [[Progressive Liberal Party (Florida)|Progressive Liberal Party]] to run several candidates for county government against the local [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] but were never successful. This Progressive Liberal Party consisted of Koreshans, [[socialism|socialists]], [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], and dissatisfied Democrats. The Koreshans had already incorporated Estero and were seeking further political power in Lee County.  After Teed died in 1908 the group went into decline.  Several groups split off from the Unity.  One such group was the [[Order of Theocracy]] that left in 1910 and moved to nearby [[Ft. Myers, Florida|Ft. Myers]]. This group lasted until 1931.  The fact the Unity was [[celibacy|celibate]] did not help, although celibacy was not the real problem since there was a married status within the Unity.  Celibates were the highest order.  Without new members joining, the group slowly dwindled.  It continued to publish the ''[[Flaming Sword]]'' until the printing press burned down in 1949.  It also published the ''American Eagle'', which began in 1906 and later became a [[horticultural]] newspaper.

===Followers===
The last remaining follower, Hedwig Michel, joined in 1940.  She had learned of the Koreshans in [[Germany]], and fled [[Nazism|Nazi]] persecution.  She ceded the main portion of the commune grounds to [[Florida]] to form a state park in 1961.  The Koreshan State Park (now known as the [[Koreshan State Historic Site]]) was opened in 1967. Hedwig Michel continued to live in the building known as the "''Planetary Court''".  She died in 1981. She is the only Koreshan buried within the park. Two other Koreshan cemeteries are nearby, one of which lies within a gated community and the other on land owned by the [[Audubon Society]].  Partly due to the Koreshan belief in a form of reincarnation, little, if anything, was done to care for these cemeteries.  The only permanent grave stones were put in by family members.

==College==
The College of Life Foundation, formerly the Koreshan Unity Foundation, is now the owner/caretaker of the remaining Koreshan land and the extensive archives. After Michel's death, control of the Koreshan Unity Foundation passed to her secretary, Jo Bigelow, and most recently another individual, Charles Dauray. None of those controlling the College of Life Foundation are Koreshan believers.

'''Libyan Arabic''' ({{lang-ar|ليبي}} ''Lībī''; also known as '''Sulaimitian Arabic''') is a [[variety of Arabic]] spoken in [[Libya]] and neighboring countries. It can be divided into two major dialect areas; the eastern centred in [[Benghazi]] and [[Bayda, Libya|Bayda]], and the western centred in [[Tripoli]] and [[Misurata]]. The eastern variety extends beyond the borders to the east into western [[Egypt]]. A distinctive southern variety, centered on [[Sabha, Libya|Sabha]], also exists and is more akin to the western variety.

==Note on transcription notation==
The [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] of Libyan Arabic into [[Latin script]] poses a few problems. First, there is not one standard transcription in use even for [[Modern Standard Arabic]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}. The use of the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] alone is not sufficient as it obscures some points that can be better understood if several different [[allophone]]s in Libyan Arabic are transcribed using the same symbol.

On the other hand, Modern Standard Arabic transcription schemes, while providing good support for representing Arabic sounds that are not normally represented by the Latin script, do not list symbols for other sounds found in Libyan Arabic.

Therefore, to make this article more legible, [[DIN 31635]] is used with a few additions to render [[phoneme]]s particular to Libyan Arabic. These additions are as follow:

==History==
Two major historical events have shaped the Libyan dialect: the [[Banu Hilal|Hilalian]]-[[Banu Sulaym|Sulaimi]] migration, and the migration of Arabs from [[al-Andalus]] to the [[Maghreb]] following the [[Reconquista]]. Libyan Arabic has also been influenced by [[Italian language|Italian]], and to a lesser extent by [[Turkish language|Turkish]].

The Libyan dialect is used predominantly in spoken communication in [[Libya]]. It is also used in Libyan folk poetry, TV dramas and comedies, songs, as well as in cartoons. Libyan Arabic is also used as a [[lingua franca]] by non-Arab Libyans whose mother tongue is not Arabic. Libyan Arabic is not normally written, as the written [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]] is normally [[Modern Standard Arabic]], but Libyan Arabic is the main language for cartoonists, and the only suitable language for writing Libyan folk poetry. It is also written in internet forums, emails and in instant messaging applications.

==Phonology==
As is the case with all [[Bedouin]] dialects and some Urban dialects, the {{IPAslink|q}} sound of Modern Standard Arabic is realized as a {{IPAblink|ɡ}}, but sometimes in words recently borrowed from literary Arabic.

The following table shows the consonants used in Libyan Arabic. Note: some sounds occur in certain [[dialect|regional varieties]] while being completely absent in others.

In western dialects, the interdental fricatives {{IPA|/θ ð ðˤ/}} have merged with the corresponding dental stops {{IPA|/t d dˤ/}}. Eastern dialects generally still distinguish the two sets, but there is a tendency to replace {{IPA|/dˤ/}} with {{IPA|/ðˤ/}}.

The e and o vowels exist only in long form. This can be explained by the fact that these vowels were originally [[diphthong]]s in Classical Arabic with {{IPA|/eː/}} replacing {{IPA|/ai/}} and {{IPA|/oː/}} replacing {{IPA|/au/}}. In some eastern varieties, however, the classical {{IPA|/ai/}} has changed to {{IPA|/ei/}} and {{IPA|/au/}} to {{IPA|/ou/}}.

Libyan Arabic has at least three [[click consonant|clicks]], which are used [[interjection]]ally, a trait shared with the [[Bedouin]] dialects of central [[Arabia]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}.  The first is used for affirmative responses and is generally considered very casual and sometimes associated with low social status. The second is a [[dental click]] and used for negative responses and is similar to the English 'tut'. The third is a [[palatal click]] used exclusively by women having a meaning close to that of the English word 'alas'.

===Syllable structure===
Although Western Libyan Arabic allows for the following [[syllable structure]] to occur.

:syllable: C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)(C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)
:(C = consonant, V = vowel, optional components are in parentheses.)

An [[Epenthesis|anaptyctic]] {{IPA|[ə]}} is inserted between C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to ease pronunciation, changing the structure above into the following.
:C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)(C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(əC&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).
On the other hand, Eastern Libyan always has an  [[Epenthesis|anaptyctic]] {{IPA|ə}} between C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the following manner.
:C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(əC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)(C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).

==Vocabulary==
Most of the vocabulary in Libyan Arabic is of Old Arabic origin, usually with a modified interconsonantal vowel structure. Many Italian [[loanwords]] also exist, in addition to [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Berber languages|Berber]], [[spanish language|Spanish]], and [[English language|English]] words.

===Relation to Classical Arabic vocabulary===
The bulk of vocabulary in Libyan Arabic has the same meaning as in Classical Arabic. However, many words have different but related meanings to those of [[Classical Arabic]]. The following table serves to illustrate this relation. The [[past tense]] is used in the case of verbs as it is more distinctive and has been traditionally used in Arabic [[lexicon]]s. Canonically, these verbs are pronounced with the final 'a' (marker of the past tense in Classical Arabic). This notation is preserved the table below. However, the relation between Libyan and Classical Arabic verbs can be better understood if the final 'a' is dropped, in accordance with the [[elision]] rule of pre-pause vowels of Classical Arabic.

===Berber loanwords===
Before the mass [[Arabization]] of what corresponds to modern-day Libya, [[Berber languages|Berber]] was the native language for most people. This led to the borrowing of a number of Berber words in Libyan Arabic. Many [[Berber languages|Berber]]-speaking people continue to live in Libya today but it is not clear to what extent Berber language continues to influence Libyan Arabic. Some examples of the Berber words in Libyan Arabic are Sardouk, fallous, kusha, garjuta, shlama, karmous, zemmita, bazin, kusksi, zukra&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Madghis Madi|title=أثر الأمازيغية والعربية في اللهجة العامية الليبية|date=2017-05-09|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ys1knIdQ3Vw&amp;app=desktop|access-date=2018-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and much more words.

==Grammar==
Libyan Arabic shares the feature of the [[grammatical person|first person]] [[grammatical number|singular]] initial n- with the rest of the [[Maghrebi Arabic]] [[dialect continuum]] to which it belongs. Like other [[colloquial Arabic]] dialects, Libyan does not mark [[grammatical case]]s by [[declension]]. However, it has a rich [[verb]]al [[grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] structure.

===Nouns===
Nouns in Libyan Arabic are marked for two [[grammatical gender]]s, termed masculine and feminine, and three [[grammatical number]]s, singular, dual and plural. [[Paucal]] number also exists for some nouns. The [[diminutive]] is also still widely used [[productivity (linguistics)|productively]] (especially by women) to add an endearing or an empathetic connotation to the original noun. As in Classical Arabic, rules for the diminutive formation are based on vowel [[apophony]].

[[Indefinite pronoun|Indefiniteness]] is not marked. Definite nouns are marked using the [[Arabic definite article]] but with somewhat different rules of pronunciation:
{{main|Sun and moon letters}}
* For nouns beginning with [[sun and moon letters|"moon" letters]], the definite article is pronounced either {{IPA|[l]}}, for words with an initial single consonant [[syllable onset|onset]], or {{IPA|[lə]}}, for words with a double consonant onset. Except for the letter '''j''' {{IPA|/ʒ/}}, moon letters in Libyan Arabic are the same as in Classical Arabic even for letters that have become different phonemes such as ''q'' changing to ''g''. The letter '''j''' {{IPA|/ʒ/}}, which corresponds to the Modern Standard Arabic phoneme {{IPA|/dʒ/}}, has changed from a moon letter to a sun letter.
* For nouns beginning with sun letters, which, in Libyan Arabic, include the letter [[j]] {{IPA|/ʒ/}}, the definite article is pronounced {{IPA|[ə]}}, with the first consonant [[gemination|geminated]].

====Dual====
While marking verbs for the dual number has been lost completely in Libyan Arabic as in other Arabic varieties, nouns have a specialized dual number form. However, in Eastern Libyan it tends to be more widespread.

====Demonstratives====
Various sets of demonstratives exist in Libyan Arabic. Following is a list of some of these. Note that the grouping in columns does not necessarily reflect grouping in reality:

&lt;small&gt;Tripoli dialect is used in the table above&lt;/small&gt;

====Conjugation====
Like Classical Arabic and other Arabic dialects, Libyan Arabic distinguishes between two main categories of roots: strong roots (those that do not have vowels or [[hamza]]) and [[Arabic grammar#Weak roots|weak roots]].

===== Conjugation of strong roots =====
Strong roots follow more predictable rules of conjugation, and they can be classified into three categories for [[Arabic grammar#Stem formation|Stem I]] in Western Libyan Arabic:

* i-verbs (e.g. k-t-b to write) follow an interconsonantal vowel structure that is predominated by an '''i''' (normally pronounced [ə])
* a-verbs (e.g. r-k-b to mount, to ascend) follow an interconsonantal vowel structure that is predominated by an '''a'''
* u-verbs (e.g. r-g-ṣ to dance) follow an interconsonantal vowel structure that is predominated by an '''u'''

Note that this classification is not always strictly followed. For example, the third person femunine past of the root r-g-d, which is a u-verb, is usually pronounced {{IPA|[rəɡdət]}}, instead of {{IPA|[ruɡdət]}}. Also, a-verbs and u-verbs follow the same rules in the past conjugation.

&lt;small&gt;1. The '''i''' in an i-verb is usually pronounced {{IPA|[ə]}}.&lt;br&gt;
2. In roots with initial [[uvular]], [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal]] and [[glottal consonant|glottal]] phonemes ('''{{IPA|χ ħ h ʁ ʕ ʔ}}''' but not '''{{IPA|q}}'''), '''i''' in the present and imperative is pronounced {{IPA|[e]}}.

&lt;small&gt;1. In roots with initial [[uvular]], [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal]] or [[glottal consonant|glottal]] phonemes ('''{{IPA|χ ħ h ʁ ʕ ʔ}}''' but not '''{{IPA|q}}'''), '''u''', in the present and the imperative, is realised by '''{{IPA|o}}'''. For example, the root {{IPA|ʁ-r-f}} (to scoop up) is conjugated as {{IPA|joʁrəf}}, {{IPA|toʁrəf}}, etc.&lt;/small&gt;

Conjugation in the Eastern Libyan Arabic is more fine grained, yielding a richer structure.

===Future tense===
Future in Libyan Arabic is formed by prefixing an initial {{IPA|bi}}, usually contracted to {{IPA|b}}, to the present tense conjugation. Thus, 'tiktəb' (she writes) becomes 'btiktəb' (she will write). It should not be confused with the [[indicative]] marker common in some Eastern Arabic varieties.

==Intelligibility with other varieties of Arabic==
Libyan Arabic is highly intelligible to Tunisians and to a good extent to eastern Algerians. However, for most eastern Arabic speakers, including Egyptians, it can be difficult to understand and requires some adaptation.

Libyans usually have to substitute some Libyan Arabic words to make themselves understood to other Arabic speakers, especially [[Middle East]]erners. Substitute words are usually borrowed from Modern Standard or [[Egyptian Arabic]]. The following table shows some of the commonly replaced words:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Libyan Arabic
! IPA
! Meaning
|-
| halba
| {{IPA|halba}}
| plenty
|-
| dār
| {{IPA|daːr}}
| (he) did
|-
| dwe
| {{IPA|dwe}}
| (he) spoke
|-
| gaʿmiz
| {{IPA|ɡaʕməz}}
| (he) sat
|-
| ngaz, naggez
| {{IPA|ŋɡaz}}
| (he) jumped
|-
| ḫnab
| {{IPA|χnab}}
| (he) stole
|-
|}

Generally, all Italian and to some extent Turkish loanwords are substituted.

It should be noted, however, that if a word is replaced, it does not mean that it is exclusively Libyan. The situation sometimes arises because the speaker mistakenly guesses that the word does not exist in the hearer's dialect. For example, the word '''zarda''' (feast, picnic) has close variants in other Maghrebi dialects but is usually substituted in Maghrebi contexts because most speakers do not know that such variants exist.

==Pidgin Libyan Arabic==
[[Pidgin]] Libyan exists in Libya as a [[contact language]] used by non-Arabs, mostly Saharan and sub-Saharan Africans living in [[Libya]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Like other pidgins, it has a simplified structure and limited expressive power.

The following are notable '''organizations''' devoted to the advocacy, legal aid, financial aid, technical aid, governance, etc. of '''[[free and open-source software]]''' (FOSS) as a whole, or of one or more specific FOSS projects.

{{Nihongo|'''Marine Day'''|海の日|Umi no Hi}}, also known as "Ocean Day" or "Sea Day", is a [[Public holidays in Japan|Japanese national holiday]] celebrated on the third Monday in July. The purpose of the holiday is to give thanks to the [[ocean]]'s bounty and to consider the importance of the ocean to Japan as an island nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www8.cao.go.jp/chosei/shukujitsu/gaiyou.html|script-title=ja:国民の祝日について|publisher=[[Cabinet Office (Japan)|Cabinet Office]], Government of Japan|language=Japanese|accessdate=July 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people take advantage of the holiday and summer weather to take a beach trip. Other ocean-related festivities are observed as well.&lt;ref name="UH"/&gt; The date roughly coincides with the end of [[East Asian rainy season|tsuyu]] ([[East Asian rainy season|rainy season]]) in much of the Japan mainland.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

==History==
The day was known as {{nihongo|Marine Memorial Day|海の記念日|umi no kinen bi}} until 1996. [[Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications|Communications Minister]] Shozo Murata designated the day in 1941 to commemorate the [[Meiji Emperor]] and his 1876 voyage in the [[Meiji Maru]], an [[iron steamship]] constructed in Scotland in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kaiyodai.ac.jp/english-c/en-facilities/12374.html|title=The Meiji-maru|publisher=[[Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology]]|accessdate=July 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The voyage included a trip around the [[Tōhoku region]], embarking on a lighthouse boat in [[Aomori, Aomori|Aomori]], and a brief stop in [[Hakodate]] before returning to [[Yokohama]] on July 20 of that year.&lt;ref name="Iida2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Iida|first=Masao|title=橋から見た隅田川の歴史 (History of the Sumida River as seen from a bridge)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kYP45frzjFAC&amp;pg=PA52|accessdate=July 17, 2012|date=June 2002|publisher=文芸社|language=Japanese|isbn=9784835538945|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not designated a national holiday until 1995, when it became the first holiday in the summer months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jetprogramme.org/e/culture/holidays/09.html|title=Marine Day (Third Monday of July)|work=[[JET Programme]]|publisher=[[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]]|accessdate=July 17, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530173605/http://www.jetprogramme.org/e/culture/holidays/09.html|archivedate=May 30, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First observed on July 20, 1996, the [[Happy Monday System]] legislation moved the date to the third Monday of July beginning in 2003.&lt;ref name="UH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crosscurrents.hawaii.edu/content.aspx?lang=eng&amp;site=japan&amp;theme=cal&amp;subtheme=PUBLICHOL&amp;unit=JCAL006|title=Marine Day (Third Monday in July)|work=Cross Currents|publisher=[[University of Hawaii]]|accessdate=July 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15156">The '''Model Penal Code''' ('''MPC''') is a text designed to stimulate and assist U.S. state legislatures to update and standardize the [[penal law]] of the [[United States of America]].&lt;ref&gt;Kadish (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MPC-Foreword"&gt;MPC (Foreword).&lt;/ref&gt; The MPC was a project of the [[American Law Institute]] (ALI), and was published in 1962 after a ten-year drafting period.{{sfnp|Kadish|Schulhofer|Barkow|2017|p=157}} The chief reporter on the project was [[Herbert Wechsler]], and contributors included [[Sanford Kadish]] and numerous other noted criminal law scholars, prosecutors, and defense lawyers.&lt;ref name="Wechsler1952"&gt;Wechsler (1952)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dubber7-10"&gt;Dubber (2015, pp. 7-10).&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Kadish|Schulhofer|Barkow|2017|p=157}} 

The ALI performed an examination of the penal system in the U.S. and the prohibitions, sanctions, excuses, and authority used throughout in order to arrive at a cohesive synthesis to the extent possible,&lt;ref name="Dubber7-10"/&gt;  and the best rules for the penal system in the United States.&lt;ref name="Dubber7-10"/&gt; Primary responsibility for [[criminal law of the United States|criminal law]] lies with the individual states, which over the years led to great inconsistency among the various state penal codes.&lt;ref name="Wechsler1952"/&gt; The MPC was meant to be a comprehensive criminal code that would allow for similar laws to be passed in different jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="MPC-Foreword"/&gt;

The MPC itself is not legally-binding law, but since its publication in 1962 more than half of all U.S. states have enacted criminal codes that borrow heavily from it.{{sfnp|Kadish|Schulhofer|Barkow|2017|p=157}} It has greatly influenced criminal courts even in states that have not directly drawn from it, and judges increasingly use the MPC as a source of the doctrines and principles underlying criminal liability.{{sfnp|Kadish|Schulhofer|Barkow|2017|p=157}}

== Key features ==

===Element analysis===
Under the MPC, crimes are defined in terms of a set of "elements of the offense," each of which must be proven to the finder of fact beyond a reasonable doubt.  There are three types of elements:
# conduct of a certain nature, 
# [[attendant circumstance]]s at the time of the conduct, or 
# the result of that conduct.

The elements are those facts that:

# are included in the definition of forbidden conduct as provided by the statute, or
# establish the required culpability, or
# negate an excuse or justification for such conduct, or
# negate a defense under the statute of limitation, or
# establish jurisdiction or venue.

All but the last two categories are ''material'' elements, and the prosecution must prove that the defendant had the required kind of culpability with respect to that element.

===''Mens rea'' or culpability===
One of the major innovations of the MPC is its use of standardized ''[[mens rea]]'' terms (criminal mind, or in MPC terms, culpability) to determine levels of mental states, just as homicide is considered more severe if done intentionally rather than accidentally. These terms are (in descending order) "[[Intention (criminal law)|purposely]]", "knowingly," "[[Recklessness (law)|recklessly]]", and "[[Criminal negligence|negligently]]", with a fifth state of "[[Strict liability (criminal)|strict liability]]", which is highly disfavored. Each material element of every crime has an associated culpability state that the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt.

* '''Purposely'''. If the element involves the nature of the conduct or the result thereof, it is his conscious object to engage in that conduct or cause the result. If the element involves attendant circumstances, he is aware of the circumstances or believes or hopes that they exist.
* '''Knowingly'''. If the element involves the nature of the conduct or the attendant circumstances, he is aware that his conduct is of that nature or that the circumstances exist. If the element involves a result, he is practically certain that the result will occur. Further, if the element involves knowledge of the existence of a particular fact, it is satisfied if he is aware of a high probability of the existence of that fact, unless he actually believes that it does not exist.
* '''Recklessly'''. A person ''consciously disregards'' a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the element exists or will result, such that its disregard involves a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a law-abiding person would observe.
* '''Negligently'''. A person ''should be aware'' of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the element exists or will result, such that the failure to perceive it involves a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe.

If an offense requires a specific kind of culpability, then any more severe culpability will suffice.  Thus if an offense is defined in the form, "It is illegal to ''knowingly'' do X," then it is illegal to do X knowingly or purposely (a more severe state), but not to do so recklessly or negligently (the two less severe states). Strict liability means that it is illegal to do something, regardless of one's mental state. If a statute provides only a single kind of culpability for a crime, that kind of culpability is assumed to apply to all elements. If no culpability is stated by statute, a minimum of recklessness is assumed to be required. The MPC declines to use the common terms "intentional" or "willful" in its specification of crimes, in part because of the complex interpretive history of these terms.&lt;ref&gt;Kadish (1999, p. 952).&lt;/ref&gt; However, it defines that any (non-MPC) statute in the jurisdiction's criminal code that uses the term "intentionally" shall mean "purposely," and any use of "willfully" shall mean "with knowledge." If a law makes an actor absolutely liable for an offense, MPC sections 2.05 and 1.04 state that the actor can only be guilty of what the MPC calls violations (essentially meaning [[civil infraction]]s), which only carry fines or other monetary penalties, and no jail time.

===Unlawful acts explicitly set forth===
{{See also|Void for vagueness}}

Another important feature is that under the MPC, any action not explicitly outlawed is legal. This concept follows the saying, "That which is not forbidden is allowed" as opposed to "That which is not allowed is forbidden." Legal scholars contrast the MPC's limits with laws passed by [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]], which allowed people to be punished for acts not specifically outlawed but similar to acts that were.  The MPC provision has a prospective effect in that it applies to those acts which may be committed in the future.  This is not the same as a retrospective effect of past acts which are protected by the rule against [[ex post facto]] laws.

Under the MPC, [[Ignorantia juris non excusat|ignorance of criminal law]] is not considered a valid defense, unless the legislature intended on making the [[mistake of law]] a defense, the law is unknown to the actor and had not been published, or the actor is acting as a result of some official statement about the law.  See sections 2.02(9) and 2.04.

===Options for enacting jurisdictions===
Certain parts of the MPC contain multiple options, inviting [[U.S. state|states]] to choose one. A particularly controversial topic was the proper place of the [[death penalty]] in the MPC. However, the MPC explicitly states that the "[American Law] Institute took no position on the desirability of the death penalty."  Note that no state is obliged to adopt any specific part of the MPC; see below.

== Criticism ==
Advocates of the MPC stress that the law must be clearly defined to prevent arbitrary enforcement, or a [[Chilling effect (term)|chilling effect]] on a population that does not know what actions are punishable.  This is known as the legality principle.&lt;ref&gt;Professor Paul H. Robinson, University of Pennsylvania, ''Criminal Law: Cases and Controversies'', full discussion beginning on page 39 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; However, critics say that the assumption that there are no possible legal systems between the extremes of "forbidden" and "allowed" is the central weakness of the MPC. British law, for example, assumes that a jury can decide what is "reasonable" both in the context of British law and social expectations as well as the specific accusation they are being asked to judge. Behavior may thus be deemed unlawful by a jury in cases where the MPC would require legislative change to produce a conviction.&lt;ref&gt;Wechsler (1952, pp. 1130-33).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use ==
The MPC is not law in any [[jurisdiction]] of the United States; however, it served and continues to serve as a basis for the replacement of existing criminal codes in over two-thirds of the states.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson (2003, p. 24)&lt;/ref&gt;  Many states adopted portions of the MPC, but only states such as [[New Jersey]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[Oregon]] have enacted almost all of the provisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Criminal Law Basics|url=http://www.mojolaw.com/info/cl014|publisher=Mojo Law|accessdate=12 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Idaho]] adopted the model penal code in its entirety in 1971, but the legislature repealed this action two months after it came into effect in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Stone &amp; Hall (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

The repeal of the MPC in [[Idaho]] came about after intense rejection of the new codification due to the lack of laws regulating [[morality]], areas of the MPC that affected important political groups in the state, and also [[prosecutor]]s and [[police]] who were critical of some areas of the new MPC-based code. The [[state bar association]], judiciary committees in the legislature, and the [[Supreme Court of Idaho]] defended the new MPC-based code. Chief in the objections were the omission of [[sodomy]], [[adultery]] and [[fornication]] as crimes, as well as objection by gun owners of the new stricter [[Gun politics in the United States|gun control law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eskridge|first=William N. Jr.|title=Dishonorable Passions: Sodomy Laws in America|year=2008|publisher=Penguin Group|isbn=978-0-670-01862-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2kvrxp4TUYsC&amp;lpg=PT182&amp;ots=QWxDBF9IlL&amp;dq=idaho%20model%20penal%20code%20repeal&amp;pg=PT182#v=onepage&amp;q=idaho%20model%20penal%20code%20repeal&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On rare occasions, the courts will turn to the MPC for its commentary on the law and use it to seek guidance in interpreting non-code criminal statutes. It is also used frequently as a tool for comparison.

''Section 230.3 Abortion'' (Tentative draft 1959, Official draft 1962) of the MPC was used as a model for [[abortion in the United States|abortion law]] reform legislation enacted in 13 states from 1967 to 1972. It is included as Appendix B of [[Harry Blackmun|Justice Blackmun]]'s opinion in the January 22, 1973 ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'' decision of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] (''[[Roe v. Wade]]'''s lesser-known companion case).

In October 2009, the ALI voted to disavow the framework for [[capital punishment]] that it had included in the MPC, "in light of the current intractable institutional and structural obstacles to ensuring a minimally adequate system for administering capital punishment." A study commissioned by the institute had said that experience had proved that the goal of individualized decisions about who should be executed and the goal of systemic fairness for minorities and others could not be reconciled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=New York Times |author=Adam Lipak |date= January 4, 2010 |title=Group Gives Up Death Penalty Work |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/05/us/05bar.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1574">The '''Mujavir''' are a [[Muslim]] community found in the state of [[Uttar Pradesh]] in [[India]].  They are also known as Shaikh Hashemi.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part Two edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das pages 991 to 994 Manohar Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==

The word mujavir literally means caretakers, and the Mujavir are the caretakers of the shrine of the famous [[Sufi]], Saiyid Salar Masood in [[Bahraich]]. They claim that their ancestors came from [[Iraq]], and were appointed custodians of the shrine. The Mujavir speak [[Urdu]] among themselves and [[Hindi]] with outsiders.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part Two edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das pages 991 to 994 Manohar Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

== Present circumstances ==

Their traditional occupation as the custodians of the shrine is now limited to few members of the community. Most Mujavir are now employed as carpenters, rickshaw pullers and daily wage labourers. They reside in their own quarters in the city of [[Bahraich]].  The Mujavir are endogamous, and only marry within the community. There are, however, some cases of intermarriage with other [[Shaikh of Uttar Pradesh|Shaikh]] groups.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part Two edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das pages 991 to 994 Manohar Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

An estimated 84,532&lt;ref&gt;1953 Statistical Almanac, Statistics Bureau, Ministry of Public Information&lt;/ref&gt; [[South Korea]]ns were taken to [[North Korea]] during the [[Korean War]]. In addition, South Korean statistics claim that, since the [[Korean Armistice Agreement]] in 1953, about 3,800 people have been abducted by North Korea (the vast majority in the late 1970s), 489 of whom were still being held in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sukuukai.jp/narkn/|title=NARKN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
South Korean abductees by North Korea are categorized into two groups, wartime abductees and postwar abductees.

===Wartime abductees===
Koreans from the south who were kidnapped to the north against their wishes during the 1950–53 [[Korean War]] and died there or are still being detained in North Korea are called wartime abductees or Korean War abductees. Most of them were already educated or skilled, such as politicians, government officials, scholars, educators, doctors, judicial officials, journalists, or businessmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://625.in/en/|title=“Historical Resource on the Korean War Abductees Incident" Vol. 1, Sep. 28, 2006 / Korean War Abductees’ Family Union|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?cataId=nk02500&amp;num=1967|title=Curious about Those Kidnapped to North Korea during the Korean Wartime, Part 1|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to testimonies by remaining family members, most abductions were carried out by North Korean soldiers who had specific names and identification in hand when they showed up at people's homes. This is an indication that the abductions were carried out intentionally and in an organized manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinu.or.kr/eng/|title=2008 White Paper on Human Rights in North Korea, Korean Institute for National Unification|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postwar abductees===
South Koreans who were kidnapped by North Korean agents in the South Korean territory or foreign countries after the armistice was signed in 1953 are known as postwar abductees. Most of them were captured while fishing near the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] (DMZ), but some were abducted by North Korean agents in South Korea. North Korea continued to abduct South Koreans into the 2000s, as is shown by the cases of reverend, [[Kim Dongsik]] ({{lang-ko|김동식}}), who was abducted on January 16, 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynk.com/korean/read_print.php?num=52245|title=DailyNK}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jin Gyeong-suk]] ({{lang-ko|진경숙}}), a [[North Korean defectors|North Korean defector]] to South Korea who was abducted on August 8, 2004, when she had returned to the China-North Korea border region using her South Korean passport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sukuukai.jp/narkn/useful_materials.html|title=Userful Materials|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
During wartime, North Korea kidnapped South Koreans to increase its human capacity for rehabilitation after the war. It recruited [[intelligentsia]] who were exhausted in North Korea and kidnapped those needed for postwar rehabilitation, technical specialists, and laborers. There was an intention to drain the intelligentsia of South Korean society, exacerbate societal confusion, and promote communization of South Korea by making postwar rehabilitation difficult due to the shortage of technical specialists and youth. They also had the intention to guise the abductions as voluntary entry for the advancement of their political system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynk.com/english/|title=DailyNK|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Complete Works, Volume Ⅳ'', dated July 31, 1946, North Korean leader [[Kim Il-sung]] wrote: "In regards to bringing Southern Chosun's&lt;ref&gt;South Korea&lt;/ref&gt; intelligentsia, not only do we need to search out all Northern Chosun's intelligentsia in order to solve the issue of a shortage of intelligentsia, but we also have to bring Southern Chosun's intelligentsia."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?cataId=nk02500&amp;num=1967 "Curious about Those Kidnapped to North Korea during the Korean Wartime" April 24, 2007, ''Daily NK'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of post war abductees, Yoichi Shimada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalrelations.house.gov/archives/109/shi042706.pdf|title=At the hearing of the U.S House Committee on International Relations, on April 27, 2006|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Fukui University professor in Japan, states that North Korea appeared to abduct foreign citizens to:
# eliminate witnesses who happened to run into North Korean agents in action
# steal victims' identities and infiltrate agents back into the countries concerned
# force abductees to teach their local language and customs to North Korean agents
# brainwash them into secret agents; the fishermen hardly had access to valuable intelligence, but they still could be trained as spies and sent back to the South
# use abductees' expertise or special skills
# use abductees as spouses for unusual residents in North Korea, especially lone foreigners such as defectors or other abductees

These six patterns are not mutually exclusive. Especially numbers 2, 3, and 4 derive from [[Kim Jong-il]]'s secret order of 1976 to use foreign nationals more systematically and thereby improve the quality of North Korean spy activities, contributing to his "localization of spy education."&lt;ref&gt;Although abduction had been conducted consistently by the North, it was after this order that the kidnap operation went into high gear.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, better-educated people could be employed by the institutions responsible for waging propaganda campaigns against the South in, say, their broadcast facilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Korea/GB26Dg01.html ”Body Snatching, North Korean Style”, Feb. 26, 2005, ''Asia Times'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== North Korea's position about the abduction issue ==
North Korea has shown different positions on the abduction issue.

In the case of Japanese abduction, on September 17, 2002, the North Korean government officially admitted the kidnapping of 13 Japanese citizens, at a meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong-il and Japanese Prime Minister [[Junichiro Koizumi]].&lt;ref&gt;North Korea claimed only 5 people had been alive and the other eight died, and that no other Japanese citizens were abducted. Japan insists that several more of its citizens have been abducted.&lt;/ref&gt;

As for the South Korean abduction issue, North Korea has consistently claimed that there were no South Korean abductees in North Korea. After the Armistice in 1953, North Korea refused the release of South Korean wartime abductees despite a provision allowing civilian abductees to return home in Article III of the Korean War Armistice Agreement,&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Korean Armistice Agreement|Korean Armistice Agreement]]&lt;/ref&gt; a document signed by representatives from the United States, North Korea and China. Instead, they only returned 19 foreigners to the South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinu.or.kr/eng/pub/pub_04_01.jsp?category=2672|title=2008 White Paper on Human Rights in North Korea, p. 335|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In regards to the post war abductees, North Korea insists that the South Koreans defected to North Korea, and remain there of their own free will, but refuses to allow South Korean relatives to communicate with them. Despite the testimonies of former abductees who have escaped from the North on their own, North Korea has held fast to the existing position: "There are no South Korean abductees and we cannot confirm their existence." The former husband of Japanese abductee [[Megumi Yokota]], himself a suspected abductee from the South, was allowed to meet his South Korean mother in 2006, but Yokota's parents called the meeting a publicity stunt by North Korea, meant to isolate his daughter from her Japanese family, as the man has now remarried a native North Korean and has a son with her.

== Inter-Korean talks held ==
The Seoul government has clarified that resolving the [[Korean War POWs detained in North Korea|Korean War POW]] and abductee issue is not only part of the Korean government's basic responsibility for protecting its citizens and one of the highest priorities. But despite the South Korean government's official urging for the North Korean government to deal with the abduction issue, there has no substantial results so far. Since the inter-Korean Summit held in 2000, the South and the North dealt with the abduction issue at the talks; the second South–North Summit, inter-Korean Prime Minister talk, and rounds of ministerial-level or inter-Korean Red Cross talks.

* On June 15, 2000, at the first South–North Summit, South Korean President [[Kim Dae-jung]] and his North Korean counterpart, [[Kim Jong-il]], agreed to settle humanitarian issues as early as possible, including the exchange of visiting groups of separated families and relatives. But from the words and phrases of their agreement, or [[June 15th North–South Joint Declaration]], there were no references to the abductee issue.
** In the same year, South Korea repatriated 63 convicted Communist spies and thereafter provided billions of dollars' worth of aid and trade to the North. But it has been reluctant to challenge North Korea's denials that it had abducted any South Koreans &amp;mdash; even though Kim Jong-il admitted in 2002 that North Korea had kidnapped thirteen Japanese citizens and released five.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/04/world/asia/04iht-fisher.1.7375753.html|title=One South Korean's story of abduction and repatriation|first=Choe|last=Sang-hun|date=4 September 2007|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On June 24, 2005, at the fifteenth round of Inter-Korean Ministerial Talks held in Seoul, the South and the North agreed to hold the sixth round of inter-Korean Red Cross talks to consult about humanitarian issues including confirmation of the fates and whereabouts of the missing people during Korean War.
** During the sixth round of inter-Korean Red Cross talks held in August 2005, the South and the North discussed the issue of confirming the fates and whereabouts of missing people during the Korean War&lt;ref&gt;missing people during the Korean War : euphemistic phrases to express " wartime abductee"&lt;/ref&gt; but produced no concrete results.
* During the eighth round of inter-Korean Red Cross talks held in April 2007, both Koreas agreed on “the framework of family reunion meetings”, cooperating and addressing the issue regarding those who have been missing "during or after" the Korean War.&lt;ref&gt;missing people after the Korean War: euphemistic phrases to express "post war abductees"&lt;/ref&gt; It seemed to be a more realistic approach but also showed that North Korea was still refusing to admit any cases of abduction of South Koreans.
* At the second South–North Summit, on October 4, 2007, Roh Moo-hyun raised the prisoners of war (POW) and abduction issue to Kim Jong-il, but he failed to achieve a settlement because Kim Jong-il did not respond.&lt;ref&gt;"Seoul Considering  task force on POWs" Feb. 23, 2008, ''Korea Herald''&lt;/ref&gt;
* First inter-Korean PM talks in November 2007 and ninth round of inter-Korean Red Cross talks (in November 2007) reconfirmed the agreement of 8th round of Red Cross talks.

== Substitution way: including the category of separated families ==
Because North Korea has been denying the existence of abductees and POWs on its territory, since November 2000, the South Korean government has been trying to resolve the issue through a more realistic approach of including the abductees and POWs in the category of separated families. By doing so, families of POWs or abductees also could participate in the normal reunion events that were organized for families separated by the war.
As a result of these efforts, a total of 38 families of abductees and POWs were able to meet their family members in North Korea, and the fates of 88 people were confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unikorea.go.kr/data/src/whitepaper/wp2008ch5.pdf 2008 Unification White Paper, Ministry of Unification, p. 203]&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast with the official policies, the 2014 United Nations ''[[Report of the Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea|Report of the commission of inquiry on human rights in the DPRK]]'' states that the South Korean government has not been willing to raise the issue with North Korea, thinking of the abductions in political rather than humanitarian terms. Further, the report says that "Well over 200,000 persons who were taken from other countries to the DPRK may have potentially become victims of enforced disappearance, as defined in the Declaration for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance" and "Most postwar abductee family members that have applied to attend a separated family reunion have received notification at the life status verification stage of the process, that their loved one has since deceased or their life status cannot be verified. Given the high level of surveillance on those of South Korean origin, and the nature of DPRK monitoring in society in general, from the Inmin-wiwon-oei (regional level) down to the Inminban (Neighbourhood Watch), the Commission finds it difficult to believe that life status verification is not possible in the DPRK."&lt;ref name="Human Rights Council 2014b"/&gt;

== The law concerning abductees ==
Separately from talks with North Korea, the South Korean government enacted on April 2, 2007, the "Law for the Victims of Abduction to the North in the Postwar Years (or, the law concerning the assistance and compensation for the abducted persons since the Korean War Armistice Agreement)". Based on this law, the abducted persons, upon return to South Korea, will be entitled to receive assistance and the returning person himself or herself and their family members will be entitled to compensation for the human rights infringements sustained during the period. By this law, on October 16, 2007, the South Korean government formed the "Committee for the Compensation of the Victims of Abduction to the North."

== Number of abductees ==

=== Wartime abduction ===
Owing to the special situation of wartime, the exact number of Korean War abductees is difficult to determine. There are considerable differences in the numbers cited in various published documents and statistics. Overall range of the numbers is from 2,438&lt;ref&gt;This number took only Seoul citizen into account in 1950 when Seoul city was briefly retook by the UN forces; the Statistics Bureau of South Korea's Ministry of Public Information&lt;/ref&gt; to 84,532.&lt;ref&gt;South Korea’s 1953 Statistical Almanac, Statistics Bureau, Ministry of Public Information&lt;/ref&gt; When the Korean National Red Cross set a special re-registration period to compile a list of missing people or the so-called "displaced people" in 1956, a total of 7,031 people registered. On February 26, 1957, the South delivered the list of 7,034 people to the North through the International Federation of Red Cross (IFRC).&lt;ref&gt;"The Issue of Korean War POWs &amp; South Korean Civilian Abductees"(Dec. 5, 2005) / ROK Ministry of Unification&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Later, on November 7, same year, the [[North Korean Red Cross]] sent the reply letter to the South Korean Red Cross, containing the names of 337 abducted persons, along with their addresses and jobs. On December 3, same year, the North Korea Red Cross asked the status of North Korean who came to the South during the war.&lt;/ref&gt; But according to the survey of "Korean War Abductees’ Family Union" in March 2002, its number amounts to 94,700.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinu.or.kr/eng/pub/pub_04_01.jsp?category=2672|title=2008 White Paper on Human Rights in North Korea, p. 336|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post war abduction ===
After the Korean War or during the [[Cold War]] period, a total of 3,795 people have been abducted and taken to North Korea. Subsequently, through the South Korean government's protests and various efforts via the Korean National Red Cross, 3,309 people have returned to South Korea. And six persons have recently escaped from the North and returned to the South Korea on their own. A total of 480 South Korean abductees remain in North Korea against their will (as of December 2007).

=== Fishermen ===
On May 28, 1955, a South Korean fishing boat, the ''Daesung-ho'', with a crew of ten fishermen, was hijacked by North Korean authorities. Since then, North Korean agents have hijacked numerous South Korean ships and kidnapped the seamen and fishermen aboard the vessels. In total, 3,696 fishermen and 120-plus fishing boats were seized by North Korea.

After strong protests from South Korean government, North Korea has repatriated 3,262 people. An additional six people have recently{{When|date=February 2011}} returned home to South Korea on their own. But a total of 427 fishermen are still held in North Korea.&lt;ref&gt;2008 White Paper on Human Rights in North Korea, Korea Institute for National Unification, p.340.&lt;/ref&gt;

===High school students===
Five South Korean high school students&lt;ref&gt;Kim Young-nam, Hong Geon-pyo, Lee Myoung-woo, Lee Min-gyo and Choi Seung-min&lt;/ref&gt; disappeared in 1977 and 1978. They had been regarded as missing persons. But in the late 1990s, through the testimonies of North Korean spies in South Korea, it was discovered that they were working in North Korea as instructors, teaching the basics of South Korean lifestyle to would-be undercover Northern operatives. It has been known that among them was the husband of Japanese abductee [[Yokota Megumi]], Kim Young-nam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.hankooki.com/times/times_view.php?term=+&amp;path=hankooki3/times/lpage/opinion/200702/kt2007022214221854140.htm&amp;media=kt|title=Korea Times, February 22, 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South Korean Navy personnel ===
On June 5, 1970, North Korean patrol boats seized a South Korean broadcast vessel with 20 crew on board off the west coast near the military demarcation line. The vessel was standing on guard for South Korean fishing boats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/man/crs/RL30004.pdf|title=“North Korea: Chronology of Provocations, 1950–2003” U.S CRS report|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060905062431/http://www.fas.org/man/crs/RL30004.pdf|archivedate=2006-09-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Korean Air Lines airplane hijacking ===

In December 1969, North Korean agents hijacked a South Korean airliner YS-11 to [[Wonsan]] en route from [[Kangnung]] to [[Seoul]] with 51 persons aboard; in February 1970, 39 of the crew and passengers were released. The remaining 11 were still detained in North Korea.&lt;ref&gt;It is believeed that 1 person was a hijacker&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, two stewardesses became announcers of the North Korean propaganda broadcasts that target South Korean audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Korea/GB26Dg01.html|work=Asia Times Online |title=Korea News and Korean Business and Economy, Pyongyang News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abductions abroad ===
{{see also|North Korean abductions of Japanese citizens}}
In February 1978, South Korean actress [[Choi Eun-hee]] and her film director husband [[Shin Sang-ok]] [[Abduction of Shin Sang-ok and Choi Eun-hee|were kidnapped in Hong Kong]] and taken to Pyongyang. They were abducted on the orders of [[Kim Jong-il]], the son of North Korean President [[Kim Il-sung]], who wanted to use them to improve the North Korean film industry. Shin attempted to escape and spent five years in a [[Brainwashing|re-education camp]], before being reunited with his wife. While living in North Korea, Shin made the monster movie ''[[Pulgasari]]''. In April 1984, South Korean government officials stated that the kidnappees were working in North Korea producing propaganda films that glorified Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il. The couple escaped to the United States in 1986 while on a filming assignment in [[Vienna]].&lt;ref name="Sebag-Montefiore 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fischer 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Human Rights Council 2014"/&gt;

In the 1990s most abductions of this sort took place in China, and their victims were political activists, missionaries, and real or suspected South Korean spies. All these abductions occurred in the Chinese North-East, near the borders of North Korea.
* In January 2000, South Korean, Reverend Kim Dong-shik, a legal resident of the [[United States]], was reported missing in Yanji, northeastern China. Kim is reported to have been actively involved since 1995 in evangelical work among North Korean escapees/refugees in [[Yanji]], [[Jilin province|Jilin Province]], China. In October 2000, South Korea’s [[National Intelligence Service (South Korea)|National Intelligence Service]] reportedly confirmed that Kim was kidnapped by North Koreans in [[Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture|Yanbian, China]], on February 1, 2000. In April 2005, the Seoul Central District Court convicted Chinese citizen Ryu Young-hwa of assisting North Korean agents in the abduction of Kim.
* In July 1995, a team of three North Korean agents and their two Korean-Chinese collaborators in Jilin abducted a South Korean pastor, Reverend Ahn Seung-woon, in southern [[Manchuria]]. Pyongyang claimed that Ahn defected voluntarily. But a Chinese court convicted a North Korean citizen of masterminding the abduction of Ahn and deported the agent to North Korea in July 1997 following a two-year prison term.

North Korean abductions have not been limited to northeast Asia and many documented abductees have been kidnapped while abroad, making the issue of serious concern to the international community.
* On April 5, 1971, Yu Sung-gun, a South Korean diplomat stationed at the South Korean embassy in [[West Germany]], was abducted by North Koreans while in [[West Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Korea/GB26Dg01.html Body snatching, North Korean style], ''[[Asia Times]]'', February 26, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
* In June 1979, North Korean agents abducted South Korean teacher Ko Sang-moon in [[Norway]], who had taken a taxi and stated his destination was "Embassy of Korea" but the driver took him to the embassy of the wrong country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/30/news/30iht-a4_35.html South Koreans Impatient For Return of Prisoners], ''[[New York Times]]'', August 30, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="taken"/&gt;
* In August 1987, Lee Chae-hwan, a South Korean student enrolled in the United States at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] was abducted by North Koreans while on a visit to [[Austria]].&lt;ref name="taken"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title= North Korean Provocative Actions, 1950 - 2007|work=Federation of American Scientists|date=April 20, 2007| url= https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL30004.pdf|accessdate=March 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being forced onto a boat by DPRK agents, Ms Choi demanded an explanation from the abductors, to which they replied “Madam Choi, we are now going to the bosom of General Kim Il-sung”.  On her arrival in the DPRK on 22 January, she was met by Kim Jong-il who took her on a tour of Pyongyang.  Upon learning of her disappearance, Ms Choi’s ex-husband Shin Sang-ok, a leading filmmaker, went to Hong Kong to look for her. He was also abducted from Hong Kong by the same DPRK agent in July 1978.  Kim Jong-il said to Mr Shin upon his arrival in the DPRK “I had ordered the operations group to carry out a project to bring you here as I wanted a talented director like you to be in the North.”  This information is consistent with the accounts from former DPRK officials who were personally involved in abductions who indicated that Kim Jong-il personally signed off on abduction orders.  During their time in the DPRK, Mr Shin Sang-ok and Ms Choi Un-hee were involved in a number of DPRK-produced movies of which Kim Jong-il was the executive producer. The couple escaped into the United States Embassy while visiting a film festival in Vienna in 1986. They later settled in the United States; Mr Shin has since passed away. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1285">[[Polygamous]] unions are legal in [[Libya]]. Previously, under the rule of [[Muammar Gaddafi]], a man needed to prove that he was capable of providing for the wives with reasons and required the consent of the first wife. This changed in February 2013, however, when the Constitutional Court overturned the previous law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2013/02/07/264927.html|title=Libyan men now allowed to remarry without consent of first wife: court rule|publisher=English.alarabiya.net|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2011/11/06/polygamy_in_libya_and_beyond/|title=Polygamy in Libya — and beyond|publisher=Salon.com|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/libyas-women-activists-outraged-by-court-ruling-on-multimple-wives/1611645.html|title=Libya's Women Activists Outraged by Court Ruling on Wives|work=VOA|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Probability matching''' is a [[decision strategy]] in which predictions of class membership are proportional to the class [[base rates]].  Thus, if in the training set positive examples are observed 60% of the time, and negative examples are observed 40% of the time, then the observer using a ''probability-matching'' strategy will predict (for unlabeled examples) a class label of "positive" on 60% of instances, and a class label of "negative" on 40% of instances.  

The optimal [[Bayesian decision theory|Bayesian decision strategy]] (to maximize the number of correct predictions, see {{Harvtxt|Duda|Hart|Stork|2001}}) in such a case is to always predict "positive" (i.e., predict the majority category in the absence of other information), which has 60% chance of winning rather than matching which has 52% of winning  (where ''p'' is the probability of positive realization, the result of matching would be &lt;math&gt;p^2+(1-p)^2&lt;/math&gt;, here &lt;math&gt;.6 \times .6+ .4 \times .4&lt;/math&gt;).  The probability-matching strategy is of psychological interest because it is frequently employed by human subjects in decision and classification studies (where it may be related to [[Thompson sampling]]).

'''QatarDebate''', a member of [[Qatar Foundation]] and the National Debating Organisation for [[Qatar]], is a civic engagement initiative which aims to develop and support the standard of open discussion and [[debate]] among students and youth in Qatar and the broader Arab world.

==History==
QatarDebate was established in 2008 under the direction of [[Moza bint Nasser]], chairperson of [[Qatar Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishcouncil.qa/en/about/press/public-debate-between-champion-university-debaters|title=A public debate between champion university debaters|publisher=British Council (Qatar)|date=16 March 2015|accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with support from the team behind the [[Doha Debates]].

QatarDebate's aim is to "shape the global citizens of today and the intellectual leaders of tomorrow in Qatar and the region" through the introduction of a variety of English and Arabic debate programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qatardebate.org/about-us/about-qd|title=About QD|publisher=QatarDebate|accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs and activities ==
The center selected and helped coach members of the Qatar National Debate Team for the 2008 and 2009 editions of the [[World Schools Debating Championships]]. In both editions, the team won four out of their eight debates. The team equaled Lithuania's record in the 2008 championships for the number of debates won by a team in its inaugural appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oicinternational.biz/ebook/oic-today/Volume-29/files/assets/basic-html/page26.html|title=Debaters Today, Leaders Tomorrow|publisher=OIC International Business Centre|volume=29|page=26|accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, two national forums were simultaneously organized by QatarDebate: the Qatar National Schools Debating Championship and Qatar National Universities Debating Championships.&lt;ref name="qfr"/&gt;

QatarDebate was awarded the rights to host the 2010 World Schools Debating Championships, becoming the first Arab-based society to do so. The event was launched on 9 February 2010 and featured teams from 57 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albawaba.com/news/2010-world-schools-debate-championship-opens-doha|title=2010 World Schools Debate Championship opens in Doha|publisher=Al Bawaba|date=11 February 2011|accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A biennial event known as the International Universities Arabic Debating Championship is held under the auspices of QatarDebate. The first edition was held in 2011, followed by two more editions in 2013 and 2015. The championship features students from international universities who debate predetermined topics. The 2015 edition, which featured teams from 33 countries, was the first to include universities from non-Arabic countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marhaba.qa/qatardebate-announce-third-international-universities-arabic-debating-championship/|title=QatarDebate Announce Third International Universities Arabic Debating Championship|publisher=Marhaba|date=21 April 2015|accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Films==
QatarDebate was involved in the filming of a documentary film on the first Qatar National Schools Debating Team (2008) entitled “Team Qatar”, directed by Liz Mermin, which won an award at the 2009 [[Doha Tribeca Film Festival]]. The center also produced an instructional film on debating for use by members of the society, entitled “QatarDebate Introduction to Debating”.&lt;ref name="qfr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qfradio.com/app/media/1323|title=Annual report 2008–2009|publisher=Qatar Foundation|page=181|accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
In 2013, the center released a dictionary with Arabic and English debate terminology. Along with definitions of each term, the book highlights their application in debates by providing examples of their use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qatar-tribune.com/data/20130113/content.asp?section=Nation1_1|title=Dictionary of debate terminology launched|publisher=Qatar Tribune|author=Joseph Varghese|date=13 January 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328205811/http://www.qatar-tribune.com/data/20130113/content.asp?section=Nation1_1|archive-date=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other publications released by the center include Al Murshed Book&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qatardebate.org/publications/almurshed|title=Al Murshed|publisher=QatarDebate|accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Introduction to the Art of Debating Book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qatardebate.org/publications/introduction-to-the-art-of-debating|title=Introduction to the Art of Debating|publisher=QatarDebate|accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3845">The '''Residential Drug Abuse Program''' (RDAP) is an intensive nine-month, 500-hour [[substance abuse]] rehabilitation program administered by the United States [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] (BOP), offered to [[federal prison]]ers who qualify and voluntarily elect to enroll.&lt;ref name="BOP"&gt;{{cite web|title=Substance Abuse Treatment|url=http://www.bop.gov/inmate_programs/substance.jsp|publisher=Federal Bureau of Prisons|accessdate=April 5, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120413163210/http://www.bop.gov/inmate_programs/substance.jsp|archivedate=April 13, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon successful completion of the program, prisoners who meet the necessary criteria are eligible for up to a 12-month reduction of their sentence and possibly six months in a halfway house depending on how many months they have left on their sentence. Due to the high demand and insufficient spots, inmates are placed on a waiting list typically when they have 12 months or less time left on their sentence and are accepted when there is an opening. This is part of the reason why inmates receive different amounts of time off their sentences. For example, if an inmate has waited for a slot until he has 12 months left and the program is six months long, then he only receives six months off his sentence and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report Number I-2003-002, Appendix I|url=http://www.justice.gov/oig/reports/BOP/e0302/app1.htm|publisher=The Federal Bureau of Prisons' Drug Interdiction Activities|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Vick]] was rumored to have entered the program while serving out his sentence at the [[United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth]], [[Kansas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vick enters drug treatment program at Kansas Prison|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3185291|publisher=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Munson|first=Lester|title=Vick at Leavenworth but isn't in prison drug program|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3282176|publisher=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Violent offenses normally disqualify defendants from the early release portion of the program. Felony or misdemeanor convictions for homicide, forcible rape, robbery, aggravated assault, and child sexual abuses all render a prisoner ineligible to participate.&lt;ref&gt;28 C.F.R. § 550.55 (2016), ''available at'' https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/28/550.55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pierce|first1=Maggie|title=Choosing a Drug Treatment Program - Guide|url=http://www.cannabisrehab.cqkunsen.com|accessdate=19 June 2009}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;Bad behavior and regular rule breaking will definitely lead to expulsion from the Residential Drug Abuse Program &lt;ref&gt;http://rdapdan.com/services/qualify-for-rdap-program/&lt;/ref&gt;

The program is open to inmates with a documented history of substance abuse in the 12-month period prior to arrest for the sentence they are currently serving. It is authorized in 18 U.S.C. § 3621.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Early Release Procedures Under 18 U.S.C. § 3621|url=http://www.bop.gov/policy/progstat/5331_002.pdf|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;  RDAP is only available to inmates in federal prisons; state prisoners are not eligible to participate.  

Research commissioned by the BOP revealed lower rates of [[recidivism]] and a higher quality of life upon returning to civilian life for offenders who successfully complete the program.&lt;ref name = "BOP" /&gt;

'''Rukun Warga''' (RW) is the division of regions in [[Indonesia]] under the [[Administrative village|Village or ''Kelurahan'']] (or under: ''Dusun'' or village). Rukun Warga not including the division of administration, and the formation of local communities is through consultation in the framework of community service set by the village or villages. RW is further divided into ''[[Rukun Tetangga]]'' (RT).
Most information about governance and functioning of the RW and RT is in Indonesian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Jakarta Raya (Indonesia).

'''Sindhi Rajputs''' ({{lang-sd|سنڌي راجپوت}}) are [[Sindhi people]] belonging to the [[Rajput]] community and living in [[Sindh]], [[Pakistan]].
{{toclimit|2}}

==Sindhi-Sipahi of Rajasthan==
The Sindh-Sipahi originally belonged to the family of [[Chandravanshi]] Rajputs. They are said to have converted to [[Islam]] at the time of the conquest of [[Sindh]] by the [[Arabs]], around the 8th century CE. The Sindhi Sipahi form a large part of the [[Muslim Rajput]]s population of [[Marwar]] and [[Mewar]]. According to their traditions, they were [[Chauhan]] and [[Bhati]] Rajputs who converted to Islam in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;pages 13 &amp; 14, 32 in Memories and movements : borders and communities in Banni, Kutch, Gujarat by Rita Kothari New Delhi : Orient Blackswan, 2013 {{ISBN|8125050493}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are concentrated in [[Mallani]], Sheo, Sanchor in [[Marwar]] and in [[Udaipur]].{{cn|date=October 2018}}

They are sub-divided into various tribes, such as the Bhatti, Sodha, Tonwar and Rathore, and further divided into firkas or sub-clans. Their main firkas are the Samma, Panwar, [[Gajju]], [[Bhayo]], Panno, [[Sithar]], and Mahar. The Samma clan is called so after the name of its founder and traces its pedigree to Bhati Rajputs. The Saand and Gajju were originally Sodha; Bhayo and Panno are said to be descended from Tonwar, and Sithar are Rathore. They have a common origin with the Sindhi Rajput tribes of [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;{{qn|date=January 2017}}

==Major clans==
The major Sindhi Rajput clans include:
*[[BHUTTO]]
*[[Sammat]]
*[[Junejo]]
*[[Hingora]]
*[[Khokhar]]
*[[Rathore]] are a Suryavanshi Rajput clan. Most of the Rathores have remained Hindu.

The '''South Korean illegal surveillance incident''' ({{lang-ko|민간인 불법사찰 사건}}, or ''illegal civilian surveillance incident'') was alleged to have occurred in 2010 when the Civil Service Ethics Division (공직윤리지원관실) under the  [[List of Prime Ministers of South Korea|Prime Minister's Office]] of [[South Korea]] inspected a civilian, a political action that is illegal under the South Korean conventions. The incident re-emerged in early 2012 as the [[South Korean legislative election, 2012|election]] approached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Min-uck | last = Chung | title = Surveillance case reemerges as polls near | date = 2012-03-13 | url = http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2012/03/117_106855.html | work = Korea Times | accessdate = 2012-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Kim Jong-ik===
The surveillance scandal originally developed as an investigation of a South Korean civilian named Kim Jong-ik ({{lang-ko|김종익}}), a bank worker who posted in his blog a video clip ''Jwiko'' ({{lang-ko|쥐코}}) that lampooned President [[Lee Myung-bak]] as a rat in a fashion from the movie, ''[[Sicko]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Yeong-chul (영출) | last = Park (박) |author2=Shin Bo-yeong (신보영) | script-title=ko:김종익씨 ‘쥐코’ 동영상이 사찰 발단 | date = 2010-07-05 | url = http://www.munhwa.com/news/view.html?no=2010070501070323031004 | work = Munhwa Ilbo | accessdate = 2012-03-14 | language = Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has generated multiple controversies such as concerns of [[Internet censorship in South Korea|Internet censorship]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Yun-hyeong (윤형) | last = Han (한) | script-title=ko:왜 ‘민간인 불법사찰 증거인멸’에 주목해야 할까? | date = 2012-03-05 | url = http://www.mediaus.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=23673 | work = MediaUs | accessdate = 2012-04-05 | language = Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt; and political misconducts. In a March 2012 interview of Kim Jong-ik, he said has been "emotionally scarred" and was forced to resign his position at his company and move to Japan. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He had lost his means to support his family and accumulated debt. Kim did not know why he himself was singled out as a target, as many others had posted the same video. He expressed deep concerns towards the government of this happening again.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news | first = Rak-in (락인) | last = Jeong (정) | script-title=ko:인간관계까지 철저히 파괴돼…나는 대한민국의 국민이 아니었다 | date = 2012-03-21 | url = http://www.sisapress.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=57441 | work = Sisa Journal | accessdate = 2012-04-05 | language = Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==

In 2012, The [[Supreme Prosecutors' Office of the Republic of Korea]] (SPO) has decided to reopen the case based on testimonies of the bureau insider, Jang Jin-su (장진수).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Sang-ho | last = Song | title = Prosecutors reopen probe of 2010 illegal surveillance case | date = 2012-03-16 | url = http://www.koreaherald.com/national/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20120316000903 | work = Korea Herald | accessdate = 2012-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A special team of prosecutors was formed to investigate the surveillance incident and a potential cover up.

The [[Supreme Prosecutors' Office of the Republic of Korea]] raided the Prime Minister's Office for the first time in its history on July 9, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Ji-sook | last = Bae | title = Prosecution raids PM’s office | date = 2010-07-09 | url = http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2010/07/117_69141.html | work = Korea Times | accessdate = 2012-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SPO eventually discovered an alleged concealment of evidences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Si-soo | last = Park | title = PM’s Office suspected of concealing key evidence | date = 2010-07-11 | url = http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2011/04/117_69193.html | work = Korea Times | accessdate = 2012-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Presidential Secretary for Employment and Labor Relations, Lee Young-ho (이영호), was banned from leaving the country for his involvement in incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Hyo-sik | last = Lee | title = Key figures in surveillance scandal face summons | date = 2012-03-18 | url = http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2012/03/117_107184.html | work = Korea Times | accessdate = 2012-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Presidential Secretary [[Lee Young-ho]] and former Presidential Labor Advisor [[Choi Jong-seok]] were arrested on April 3, 2012 for allegedly ordering Jang Jin-su to destroy the information related to the surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Two Key Figures In Surveillance Scandal Arrested | date = 2012-04-04 | url = http://www.arirang.co.kr/News/News_View.asp?nseq=127595&amp;code=Ne2&amp;category=2 | work = Arirang news | accessdate = 2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = He-suk | last = Choi | title = Surveillance scandal grows, key figures arrested | date = 2012-04-04 | url = http://www.koreaherald.com/national/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20120404001088 | work = Korea Herald | accessdate = 2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 4, 2012, Jang Jin-su revealed pictures of 50 million won he claims he received from Rhyu Chung-ryeol, a former Prime Minister's Office official, as a bribe to destroy the data, through the independent South Korean news source, [[OhMyNews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Hyeon-jun (현준) | last = Kim (김) | script-title=ko:장진수씨에 전달된 '관봉 5천만원' 사진 공개 | date = 2012-04-04 | url = http://www.yonhapnews.co.kr/society/2012/04/04/0701000000AKR20120404104700004.HTML | work = Yonhap News | accessdate = 2012-04-04 | language = Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Ji-yong (지용) | last = Choi (최) | script-title=ko:청와대 '5천만원 돈다발' 찰칵! 충격입니다 '증거인멸' 무마용... 5만원권 1000장 '비닐 포장 | date = 2012-04-04 | url = http://www.ohmynews.com/NWS_Web/view/at_pg.aspx?CNTN_CD=A0001717296&amp;CMPT_CD=E0942 | work = OhMyNews | accessdate = 2012-04-04 | language = Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roh Moo-hyun and Lee Myung-bak administrations===

As the scandal was revisited during the [[South Korean presidential election, 2012|2012 Korea elections]], debate has expanded over into conducts by both the current and previous regimes. Some have alleged that surveillance was done during the [[Roh Moo-hyun|previous]] regime, as well as the [[Lee Myung-bak government|current]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | script-title=ko:"내연녀와 모텔에…" 盧정부때 사찰문서 입수| date = 2012-04-05 | url = http://news.donga.com/Politics/3/00/20120406/45328894/1 | work = Donga Ilbo | accessdate = 2012-04-05 | language = Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media reports==
[[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation]], a notable media outlet, claimed to expose the incident in its journalist-oriented investigative program, [[PD Notebook]], on June 29, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Se-gi (세기) | last = Hong (홍) | script-title=ko:`쥐코'동영상이 뭐길래…블로그에 올렸다 `범죄인'됐다 | date = 2010-07-01 | url = http://www.newsway.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=86079 | work = News Way | accessdate = 2012-03-14 | language = Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The KBS-affiliated [[Korean Broadcasting System#Strikes|journalists]] who are on strike claimed to have obtained 2,619 surveillance-related cases of reports from the Lee Myung-bak government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = More than 2,600 Cases of Illegal Surveillance by PM Office Surface | date = 2012-03-30 | url = http://www.arirang.co.kr/News/News_View.asp?nseq=127491&amp;code=Ne2&amp;category=2 | work = Arirang News | accessdate = 2012-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Lee gov't draws flak for fresh revelations in surveillance scandal | date = 2012-03-30 | url = http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/national/2012/03/30/25/0301000000AEN20120330002500315F.HTML | work = Yonhap News | accessdate = 2012-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was later reported that over 80% of the alleged illegal surveillance records were actually created during the previous [[Roh Moo-hyun]] regime.  Of the 2,619 documents, only 120 were considered actual reports, and 2 reports were of civilians.&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;{{cite news |  title = 靑 "민간인 사찰 대부분 노무현 때…" | date = 2012-03-31 | url = http://news.donga.com/Politics/3/00/20120331/45191375/1 | work = [[Donga Ilbo]] | accessdate = 2012-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;{{cite news |  title = 청와대 반박에 "구라"라던 KBS 노조, 5시간 만에 슬그머니 '오류 사과'| date = 2012-03-31 | url = http://news.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2012/03/31/2012033101278.html?news_top | work = Chosun Ilbo | accessdate = 2012-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two former executives of [[National Intelligence Service (South Korea)|National Intelligence Service]], [[:ko:고영구|Koh Yeong-gu]] and [[:ko:김만복 (1946년)|Kim Man-bok]] denied the claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Sang-man (상만) | last = Kim (김) | script-title=ko:참여정부 국정원장들 "정치사찰 없었다" | date = 2012-04-04 | url = http://www.mediatoday.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=101496 | work = Media Today | accessdate = 2012-04-04 | language = Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt; The KBS union immediately  posted a tweet calling the explanation a lie, but soon changed stance and apologized for the inaccurate information.&lt;ref name="ref2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |  title = 靑 "민간인 사찰 대부분 노무현 때…" | date = 2012-03-31 | url = http://news.donga.com/Politics/3/00/20120331/45191375/1 | work = Donga Ilbo | accessdate = 2012-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The KBS journalists who are on strike later refuted the claim. They claimed that the total of cases including the duplicated entities are 2,837; total of cases during the Roh administration are 2,356 and written by police forces who follow ''normal procedures'' in which only 10 cases are involved with civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Jae-jin (재진) | last = Lee (이) | script-title=ko:참여정부 국정원장들 "정치사찰 없었다" | date = 2012-04-01 | url = http://www.mediatoday.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=101422 | work = Media Today | accessdate = 2012-04-05 | language = Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dailian criticised the KBS union for creating a large fabrications of facts used for political purposes, especially during election season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = KBS공영노조 "사찰문건 폭로, 최악 언론조작" | date = 2012-04-01 | url = http://www.dailian.co.kr/news/news_view.htm?id=282576 | work = Dailian | accessdate = 2012-04-05 | language = Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public opinion==

The main opposition [[Democratic United Party]] demanded a full reinvestigation of the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Sun-young | last = Lee | title = Opposition demands reopening probe on surveillance scandal | date = 2012-03-13 | url = http://www.koreaherald.com/national/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20120313000973 | work = Korea Herald | accessdate = 2012-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Korea Times]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Watergate of Korea | date = 2012-03-14 | url = http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/opinon/2012/03/202_106924.html | work = Korea Times | accessdate = 2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The New York Times]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = In South Korea Scandal, Echoes of Watergate | date = 2012-04-09 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/10/world/asia/government-spying-charges-complicate-korean-vote.html | work = The New York Times | accessdate = 2012-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared the scandal to the American [[Watergate scandal]], referring to it as the "Watergate of Korea". The conservative political activist and a current Saenuri Party political reformer, [[Lee Sang-don (1951)|Lee Sang-don]], made a remark during a radio interview on 5 April 2012:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Min-uck | last = Chung | title = It’s Watergate! | date = 2012-04-05 | url = http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2012/04/116_108415.html | work = Korea Times | accessdate = 2012-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Ji-hong (지홍) | last = Shin (신) | script-title=ko:이상돈, 불법사찰 관련 대통령 '하야' 거론 | date = 2012-04-05 | url = http://www.yonhapnews.co.kr/bulletin/2012/04/05/0200000000AKR20120405035900001.HTML | work = Yonhap News | accessdate = 2012-04-05 | language = Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The illegal surveillance case is exactly the same as the Watergate scandal. [U.S. President Richard] [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] didn’t instruct the illegal spying but stepped down from presidency for covering up the case.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Tarok''' is an [[agrarian society]] in the hills and on the plains southeast of [[Plateau State]], [[Nigeria]].

==The Tarok People==

The Tarok people call themselves oTárók, their language iTárók and their land ìTàrók. They are found principally in Langtang-North, Langtang-South, [[Wase, Nigeria|Wase]], Mikang and Kanke Local Government Areas (LGAs) of [[Plateau State]] in Central [[Nigeria]]. Their main town of [[Langtang]] is located about 186 kilometres south-east of [[Jos]], the state capital. They are also found in large numbers in [[Shendam]], Qua'an-Pan, Kanam, Pankshin LGAs and some part of Tafawa Balewa LGA of Bauchi state the Sur (Tapshin). Scattered in [[Nasarawa]] and [[Taraba State|Taraba]] states are Tarok farming communities. The people have been described to some extent in anthropological and ethnographical works by Fitzpatrick (1910), [[Roger Blench]], Lamle (1995),&lt;ref&gt;Lamle, E. N. (1995). Cultural Revival and Church Planting: A Nigerian Case study. Jos: CAPRO Media&lt;/ref&gt; Famwang and Longtau (1997). The oTárók is an amalgamation of various peoples who now form a more or less ‘homogeneous’ group. The constituents were of Pe, Ngas, [[Jukun people (West Africa)|Jukun]], [[Boghom language|Boghom]], Tel ( [[Montol]] ) and probably Tal origins, while others still remain obscure or unknown. The culture at a micro level portrays this admixture of peoples of the Tarok nation. The focus here is a description of their language.

==Name of the Language==

In the literature, other names have been used for Tarok as Appa, Yergam and its variants of Yergum and Yergem. The name Tarok itself has been wrongly spelt by some as Taroh. The name Appa on the other hand is used by the [[Jukun people (West Africa)|Jukun]] to refer to oTarok as a friendship term. These fresh insights are pointing to a conclusion that Tarok was a nickname given to the Tal/Ngas immigrants. The name of the original group is lost and has been replaced by the nickname. The term Pe-Tarok refers to the people who first spoke the original form of the language called Tarok today the mismatch notwithstanding. The origins of the peoples may be a knotty topic, but it is clear that Proto-Tarok is the parent of the language which is known as Tarok today (whatever might have been their original name).

==Tarok in a sea of Chadic languages==

Longtau described Tarok as one of the [[Benue–Congo languages]] which is almost completely submerged in a sea of Chadic languages. These languages include [[Ngas language|Ngas]], Tel, Boghom, [[Hausa language|Hausa]] / [[Fulfulde]] and Yiwom. Its non-Chadic neighbours are Pe, Jukun-Wase and Yangkam. Tarok has spread considerably in the twentieth century and it now borders Wapan in the south-east. The Chadic languages belong to a different language family called [[Afroasiatic]]. Longtau explained that Tarok had settled in their present abode long before the eastern and southward movements of Boghom and Ngas respectively.

==Tarok History==

Nankap Elias Lamle (2001) an anthropologist lecturing at the University of Jos in Nigeria stated that in the early twentieth century people from other ethnic groups such as Tal, Ngas, Jukun, Tel (Montol/Dwal) and  Yiwom (Gerkawa) migrated and settled together with the initial Timwat and Funyallang clans. People from these ethnic groups came as migrants labour workers. The Timwat and Funyallang people gave them land to settle in Tarokland after they have served the former. Colonialism and Christianity came into Tarokland by 1904 (Lamle 1995). The initial inhabitants could not trust the missionaries and colonialists as such did not encourage their people to join them. with the introduction of modernism the later migrants to Tarokland used their connections to the missionaries and colonialists to acquire western education and join the army. Today these latter migrants are at the helm of affairs in Nigeria as such tries to use their influence to change history ( cf. Lamle 2005).&lt;ref&gt;Lamle, E. N. Corporeality and Dwelling Spaces in Tarokland. Journal of Tarok studies: Nigerian Bible Translation Trust. Jos (Vol. 1 No 1 2005) pp 23&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, Lamle asserted that the framework of Tarok migration supports the assertion above and is based on the fact that the Tarok language is part of the Benue–Congo language family. However, other peoples of the Chadic language family, such as the Ngas, Boghom, Tel (Montol) and Yiwom, shifted to the Benue–Congo family and are given full status as Tarok (Lamle 1998). Also the Jukun, who speak languages of the Benue–Congo family, joined the Tarok. What is called the Tarok people are actually a mixture of many ethno-linguistic groups (Lamle 2008).

==Culture==

The Tarok people have an [[ancestral]] [[cult]] which retains considerable prestige and importance, despite major inroads of Christianity into the area. The ancestors, orìm, are represented by initiated males and post-[[menopausal]] women. [[Cult]] activities take place in sacred groves outside almost all Tarok settlements. Orìm are mostly heard, but emerge as masked figures under some circumstances, especially for the disciplining of ‘stubborn’ women and for making prophecies. Orìm figures speak through voice disguisers in a language dotted with code words although framed in normal Tarok syntax and their utterances are interpreted by unmasked figures.

Each Tarok settlement of any size has a sacred grove outside it, which is conserved as the place of the orim or ancestors. The singular form, ùrìm, is applied to a dead person or an ancestor, while orìm refers to the collective ancestors and the cult itself. Men above a certain age are allowed to enter the grove and engage with the ancestors. These inhabit the land of the dead and are thus in contact with all those who have died, including young people and children who were not admitted to the orìm. On certain nights when the ‘orìm are out’, women and children must stay in their houses. Orim can also be seen ‘dressed’, i.e. appearing as masquerades, when they engage with women through an interpreter. Surprisingly, most Tarok are [[Christian]] and Langtang hosts some large [[church (building)|churches]], but the association of the orìm with power ensures that these two systems continue to coexist. Indeed, it is said that the orìm take care to visit the houses of the retired generals and other influential figures at night to cement the bonds between two very different types of power. Orìm society is graded, in the sense that there are members who are not fully initiated and so cannot be let into the inner secrets of the society. Some of the orìm vocabulary is therefore for internal concealment, that is, there are code-words among the elder members to conceal the meaning of what is being said from junior members.

The main function of the orim from the external point of view is to maintain order, both [[Spirituality|spiritual]] and actual, within the society but also to prepare for warfare and other collective action. In practice, maintaining order seems to be about disciplining women, who are forced to cook food as a punishment for being lazy or ‘stubborn’. This category of orìm is called orìm aga., literally ‘masquerade that gives trouble’ and its speciality is to fine women. There is a special season, aga. ‘time of trouble’, for meting out fines to offenders. The orìm are also in contact with the dead and it is believed that the spirits of dead children require to be fed; hence they will request special meals from the mother of such children. Orìm also have a marriage-broking function; for example, young women tell the orìm the name of the young man they would like to marry, and they find ways of passing on the message.

==The Tarok Website==

The official website of the Tarok People was recently created and launched in December, 27th 2013.
It was created for the purpose of promoting their culture and tradition, which will serve as a rich resource for the up-coming generation. It also serves as a means for interaction between its members and as a voice to air out their ideas. It is aimed at promoting unity through various ways among the Taroks.

'''''The Devil in Miss Jones''''' is a 1973 [[pornographic film]], written, directed and produced by [[Gerard Damiano]] and starring [[Georgina Spelvin]] and [[Harry Reems]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely regarded as a classic adult film,&lt;ref name=pornstudies&gt;{{cite book |title=Porn studies |publisher=Duke University Press |authorlink=[[Linda Williams (film scholar)|author=Williams, Linda]] |year=2004 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rdWZ8JD5dkkC |isbn=0-8223-3312-0 |page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; released during the [[Golden Age of Porn]] (1969–1984).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The hypersexuality of race: performing Asian/American women on screen and scene|publisher=Duke University Press|author=Shimizu, Celine Parreñas |year=2007|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BToxwPEf814C|isbn=0-8223-4033-X|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his 1972 success with ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'', Damiano shot the film in a house on Park Drive South in the town of Harrison, New York.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artandpopularculture.com/The_Devil_in_Miss_Jones&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pennington"/&gt; Along with ''Deep Throat'' and ''[[Behind the Green Door]]'', the film is associated with a time in American culture known as "[[Golden Age of Porn#"Porno chic"|porno chic]]",&lt;ref name=Pennington/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-19730121"&gt;{{cite news |last=Blumenthal |first=Ralph |title=Porno chic; 'Hard-core' grows fashionable-and very profitable |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/21/archives/pornochic-hardcore-grows-fashionableand-very-profitable.html |date=January 21, 1973 |work=[[The New York Times Magazine]] |accessdate=January 20, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jahsonic.com/PornoChic.html Porno Chic (Jahsonic.com)]&lt;/ref&gt; in which [[Pornography|adult erotic]] films were just beginning to be widely released, publicly discussed by celebrities (like [[Johnny Carson]] and [[Bob Hope]])&lt;ref name="TM-20050329"&gt;{{cite web |last=Corliss |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Corliss |title=That Old Feeling: When Porno Was Chic |url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1043267,00.html |date=March 29, 2005 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=January 27, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and taken seriously by film critics (like [[Roger Ebert]]).&lt;ref name="RE-19730613" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RE-19761124"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Alice in Wonderland:An X-Rated Musical Fantasy |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/alice-in-wonderland-1976 |date=November 24, 1976 |work=[[RogerEbert.com]] |accessdate=February 26, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Devil in Miss Jones'' went on to spawn numerous remakes and sequels.

As with many films of the Golden Age of Porn, the copyright status of ''The Devil in Miss Jones'' is unresolved. VCX claims a copyright; rival distributor Arrow Productions distributed unauthorized copies of the film for a time before 2009, when (as part of a mutual truce between the companies) Arrow agreed to accept VCX's copyright claim in exchange for not challenging Arrow's copyright claim on ''Deep Throat''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/how-a-nasty-legal-fight-252525 |title=How a Nasty Legal Fight Over 'Deep Throat,' 'Debbie Does Dallas' Was Settled|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://lasvegassun.com/blogs/business-notebook/2009/may/01/porn-nostalgia-industry-heats-las-vegas/|last=Green|first=Steve|title=‘Porn nostalgia’ industry heats up in Las Vegas|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|date=May 1, 2009|accessdate=21 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
[[Georgina Spelvin]] plays Justine Jones, a lonely, [[major depressive disorder|depressed]] [[spinster]] who decides that [[suicide]] is the only way out of her routinely dull existence.&lt;ref name=vcxoriginal&gt;[http://www.vcx.com/store/detail.aspx?id=62 1973 Original Edition DVD] product page at [[VCX]]&lt;/ref&gt; While lying in the bathtub, Justine slits her wrists with a shaving blade and dies quietly as the water fills with her blood.&lt;ref&gt;Spelvin, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;

Because she has lived a "pure" life, Miss Jones finds herself in [[Limbo]]. There she meets Mr. Abaca (John Clemens), an [[angel]], of sorts, who informs her that she does not qualify for entrance to [[Heaven]] because she has killed herself. Angry that this one indiscretion has left her with only the options of Limbo or [[Hell]], she begs Mr. Abaca to let her "earn" her place in Hell by being allowed to return to Earth and become the embodiment of [[Lust]].&lt;ref name=vcxoriginal/&gt; After an intense session of pain and pleasure with a menacing man who goes only by the title of "The Teacher" ([[Harry Reems]]),&lt;ref name=Lewis11/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spelvin, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Justine has a few bizarre and sexually deviant encounters, the last of which is a graphic [[group sex|threesome]].

However, just as she is enjoying her new life of lust, the brief time Justine was given to fulfill herself runs out and she is faced with the eternity of Hell. At first, Miss Jones is horrified at the pain she will be forced to endure, but Abaca is quick to dispel the common human myth of Hell and promises Justine that she will be "quite comfortable..."

Justine, now a raging [[sex addict]], then finds herself confined to a small room with an [[impotence|impotent]] man who is more interested in catching [[fly|flies]] than her.&lt;ref name=Olson&gt;{{cite book |title=Historical dictionary of the 1970s |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |author=Olson, James Stuart |year=1999 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YKkF8vQRcp0C |isbn=0-313-30543-9 |page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; She desperately begs the man for sex, but he simply asks her to be quiet while he listens to the buzzing of his imaginary insects.

Trapped in her own private Hell, Miss Jones is left screaming in agony for all eternity, thirsting for a [[Orgasm|climax]] she will never achieve by her own means.

==Georgina Spelvin==
Spelvin was 36 when she made the film.&lt;ref name=pornstudies/&gt; ''The Devil in Miss Jones'' was one of her first acting appearances following a career as a chorus girl on Broadway where she was featured in productions such as ''Cabaret'', ''Guys and Dolls'', ''Sweet Charity'', and ''The Pajama Game''.&lt;ref name=rialto1&gt;[http://www.therialtoreport.com/2013/05/19/podcast-011-georgina-spelvin-the-devil-miss-jones-and-the-new-york-years/ Georgina Spelvin: The Devil, Miss Jones, and the New York Years], The Rialto Report, May 19, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TM-20050329" /&gt;

Her role in ''The Devil In Miss Jones'' was typical of her career, as she often played celibate spinsters who have a sexual awakening, then become sex fiends (e.g. ''Sleepyhead'').&lt;ref name=pornstudies/&gt; She also meets a tragic end in several of her other films.&lt;ref name=pornstudies/&gt; The film marked the first time she used the moniker Georgina Spelvin, a reference to [[George Spelvin]], a traditional stagename used to hide a performer's identity, for any number of reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Spelvin, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; According to her interview on [[Dave's Old Porn]], Spelvin also did the craft services and cooking on the set. The actress billed in the movie as Claire Lumiere was hired to do craft services only, but was offered $100 to do a lesbian scene with Spelvin, which she accepted.

In an audio interview with [[The Rialto Report]] in 2013, Spelvin spoke about how she and Lumiere were lovers at the time and they accepted the adult film work as a means of raising money for their film collective.&lt;ref name=rialto1 /&gt;

==Box office==
The movie was given an [[X rating]] by the [[MPAA]]&lt;ref name=Pennington&gt;{{cite book|title=The history of sex in American film|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|author=Pennington, Jody W. |year=2007|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OfAKgZ68a9AC|isbn=0-275-99226-8|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; and premiered at the 57th Street Playhouse in New York City.&lt;ref name=Pennington/&gt; In many theaters it was shown after ''Deep Throat'' as part of a double bill.&lt;ref name=Olson/&gt; ''The Devil In Miss Jones'' broke the box office record for a pornographic film.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; It was more commercially successful than both ''Deep Throat'' and ''Behind the Green Door'', and successfully competed against mainstream films.&lt;ref name=Lewis11/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lewis112&gt;Lewis, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; It earned $15 million in [[gross rental]] at the U.S. box office, making it the tenth most successful film of 1973, just behind ''[[Paper Moon (film)|Paper Moon]]'' with [[Ryan O'Neal]] and ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'' with Roger Moore.&lt;ref name=kramer&gt;{{cite book |first=Peter |last=Krämer |year=2005 |title=The new Hollywood: from Bonnie and Clyde to Star Wars |publisher=Wallflower Press |isbn=978-1-904764-58-8 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=B5PjuAbEPooC&amp;pg=PA108#v=twopage 208–209]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
As with the other films of the porno chic era, it was reviewed by the film critics of mainstream newspapers.&lt;ref name=Pennington/&gt;&lt;ref name=Olson/&gt; The film's review in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said, "With ''The Devil in Miss Jones'', the hard-core porno feature approaches an art form, one that critics may have a tough time ignoring in the future," and compared its plot to [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s play ''[[No Exit]]''.&lt;ref name=Lewis11&gt;Lewis, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; The review went on to say, "Damiano has expertly fashioned a bizarre melodrama," and described the opening scene as "a sequence so effective it would stand out in any legit theatrical feature".&lt;ref name=Lewis11/&gt; It finished by stating, "Booking a film of this technical quality into a standard sex house is tantamount to throwing it on the trash heap of most current hard-core fare."&lt;ref name=Lewis11/&gt;

According to Peter Michelson there is, "a relatively small corpus of [pornographic] films—e.g., ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'', ''Devil in Miss Jones'', ''[[Behind the Green Door]]''—that have a minimal but still sufficient artistic interest to distinguish themselves from the rest of the genre".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Speaking the unspeakable: a poetics of obscenity|publisher=SUNY Press|author=Michelson, Peter |year=1993|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X-jT4oEJ01QC&amp;dq=%22Behind+the+Green+Door%22|isbn=0-7914-1223-7|page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics have described it as, along with ''Deep Throat'', one of the "two best erotic motion pictures ever made".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Offensive literature: decensorship in Britain, 1960-1982|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|author=Sutherland, John |year=1983|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=udkN4xWi2r0C|isbn=0-389-20354-8|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] gave ''Deep Throat'' a no-stars rating,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/deep-throat-1973 |title=Deep Throat |publisher=Rogerebert.com |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |date=March 6, 1973 |accessdate=April 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but described ''The Devil in Miss Jones'' as the "best" of the genre he had seen and gave it three stars out of a possible four. He wrote that the relatively high production values and storytelling were partly the reason for his positive review, but that Spelvin's performance was the main draw: "she is not only the best, but possibly the only, actress in the hard-core field. By that I mean when she's on the screen, her body and actions aren't the only reasons we're watching her. Alone among porno stars, she never seems exploited."&lt;ref name="RE-19730613"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=The Devil In Miss Jones - Film Review |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-devil-in-miss-jones-1973 |date=June 13, 1973 |work=[[RogerEbert.com]] |accessdate=February 7, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Friedkin]] has called it a "great film", partly because it was one of the few porn films with a proper storyline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The erotic thriller in contemporary cinema|publisher=Indiana University Press|author=Williams, Linda Ruth |year=2005|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QOiY931rxDEC|isbn=0-253-34713-0|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the first films to be inducted into the [[XRCO Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dirtybob.com/xrco/hall.htm |title=HALL OF FAME |publisher=Dirty Bob/X-Rated Critics Organization |accessdate=June 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soundtrack==
The theme for the film was "I'm Comin' Home", sung by [[Linda November]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Discogs master |522918|name=The Devil In Miss Jones (Original Soundtrack Recording)|type=album }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dialogue was heavily sampled on a track called "The Teacher" by electronic outfit Wave Mechanics in 1991 on the Oh'Zone label - the label who first released the acid house classic "[[Chime (song)|Chime]]" by British electronic music pioneers [[Orbital (band)|Orbital]] before it became a crossover hit in the UK.

==Sequels and remakes==
In 2006, [[VCX]] employed [[Media Blasters]] to digitally re-master the film from the original 35mm film into a "Definitive Collectors Edition" 2-Disc set on DVD. This latest revision has been repackaged and supposedly has the best picture and audio quality of any original Devil In Miss Jones release. The DVDs contain the remastered feature, audio commentary with director [[Gerard Damiano]], a lengthy in-depth interview with Georgina Spelvin, the original trailer, the [[cable TV]] version, and a photo gallery.

'''Women in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]''' live in a society which has been changing over the centuries, where, after decades of Soviet regime, from the 1990s onwards, the culture has seen rapid social changes and new emerging values, but has also been affected by economic instability.

==Historical context==
{{Expand section|date=November 2017}}
[[File:Mariam Jambakur-Orbeliani, prominent educator of Georgia (E. Europe).jpg|thumb|right|[[Mariam Jambakur-Orbeliani]], 19th century Georgian [[philanthropist]] and [[feminist]]]]  
For much of the 20th century, Georgia was part of the USSR. In 1991, after the Soviet dissolution, Georgia became an independent country. As with other countries of the former communist block, the transition from a planned economy to a market economy was hard, and unemployment, economic destabilization, and conflicts have harmed the population, especially in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gfsis.org/media/download/library/articles/papava/Papava_Reforming_of_the_Post-Soviet_Georgia_Economy_in_1991-2011.pdf |format=PDF |title=Georgian Foundation for Strategic and International Studies |website=Gfsis.org |accessdate=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of population, more than 8 out of 10 inhabitants are ethnic Georgians, but there are also minorities such as Azeri, Armenians, Russians, and others. The vast majority of the population is [[Orthodox Christian]], but about one in ten are [[Muslim]]. The urbanization of the country is 53.6% (est. 2015). The [[total fertility rate]] (TFR) of 1.76 children born/woman (est. 2015) is below the replacement rate. The [[maternal mortality rate]] is 36 deaths/100,000 live births (est. 2015). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gg.html|title=The World Factbook|work=cia.gov|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitutional provisions==
The [[Constitution of Georgia (country)|Constitution of Georgia]] states at Article 14 that:"''Everyone is free by birth and is equal before law regardless of race, colour, language, religion, political and other opinions, national, ethnic and social belonging, origin, property and title, place of residence''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.ge/files/68_1944_951190_CONSTIT_27_12.06.pdf |format=PDF |title=THE CONSTITUTION OF GEORGIA |website=Parliament.ge |accessdate=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social role of women ==
{{Expand section|date=November 2017}}
[[File:Kartlis deda.JPG|thumb|right|[[Kartlis Deda]] monument]]
Because [[Georgian culture]] is a patriarchal one, women are accorded a [[chivalric]] form of respect.&lt;ref name=EC/&gt; Women can have the role of both as "breadwinner and housewife". Most of the chores at home are done by women. There is no "explicit division of labor" according to gender, except in so-called "areas of physical labor" (an example is in the field of mining). The statue of [[Mother of Georgia]] (''Kartlis Deda'', or "Mother of [[Kartli]]") that stands at a monument in the hills above [[Tbilisi]] perhaps best symbolizes such national character: in her left hand she holds a bowl of wine with which she greets her friends and in her right is a sword drawn against her enemies. One of the most important and powerful rulers of Georgia was [[Tamar of Georgia|Queen (king of kings) Tamar the Great]]. In more recent history Georgian women have been able to acquire various positions in the [[Georgian Armed Forces|military]] including being among the few professional fighter and helicopter pilots of the country's small airforce and also a small number in the army's special forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/node/66663|title=Georgia: Women Soldiers Fight for the Right to Fight Like Men|first=Molly|last=Corso|date=8 March 2013|publisher=|accessdate=17 June 2016|via=EurasiaNet}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many women also serve in the field of law enforcement and the [[Cabinet of Georgia|government]]. However, no women are allowed to become [[Orthodox church]] priests, or even to become Muslim [[mullah]]s.&lt;ref name=EC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Ge-It/Georgia.html#b#ixzz2VlOqZAkg|title=Culture of Georgia - history, people, traditions, women, beliefs, food, customs, family, social|work=everyculture.com|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The so-called "traditional stereotypes of gender-defined social roles" are undergoing changes because of the education being received by new generation of women.&lt;ref name=EC/&gt; Clothing norms stipulate that inside churches, head covering and dress or skirt for women are usually required.

==Employment==
The Labour Code of Georgia has certain protections for women. Article 2 ''Labor Relations'' para. 3 prohibits discrimination based on "race, color, language, ethnic or social origin, nationality, origin, property, birth, place of residence, age, '''gender''', sexual orientation, disability, membership of a religious , social, political or other associations, including the trade unions, by marital status, political or other opinion".&lt;ref name="matsne.gov.ge"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://matsne.gov.ge/ru/document/view/1155567 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 10, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420192014/https://matsne.gov.ge/ru/document/view/1155567 |archivedate=April 20, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Art. 27 grants [[maternity leave]], &lt;ref name="matsne.gov.ge"/&gt; and Art 36 and Art 37 in general (and explicitly at sections Art 36(2)g together with Art 37(3)c) protect women from dismissal due to  maternity, childbirth and child care, leave for a newborn child adoption and additional leave for child care.&lt;ref name="matsne.gov.ge"/&gt;
The ''Law of Georgia on Gender Equality'' provides additional protections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://matsne.gov.ge/en/document/view/91624 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 10, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420202134/https://matsne.gov.ge/en/document/view/91624 |archivedate=April 20, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Violence against women==
In 2006, Georgia enacted ''Law of Georgia on Elimination of Domestic Violence, Protection and Support of Victims of Domestic Violence''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://matsne.gov.ge/en/document/view/26422?publication%3D4 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 11, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421175938/https://matsne.gov.ge/en/document/view/26422?publication=4 |archivedate=April 21, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Georgia also ratified the [[Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/197/signatures|title=Full list|work=coe.int|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Women]] in [[Kuwait]]''' are among the most emancipated women in the [[Middle East]] region. In 2014 and 2015, Kuwait was ranked first among Arab countries in the [[Global Gender Gap Report]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://widgets.weforum.org/gender-gap-report-2014/#mena|title=The Global Gender Gap Index 2014 - World Economic Forum|publisher=World Economic Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kuna.net.kw/ArticlePrintPage.aspx?id=2405039&amp;language=en|title=Kuwait highest in closing gender gap: WEF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wef"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reports.weforum.org/global-gender-gap-report-2015/the-global-gender-gap-index-results-in-2015/|title=Global Gender Gap Index Results in 2015|publisher=World Economic Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, 53% of Kuwaiti women participated in the labor force.&lt;ref name="gend"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2013/cr13337.pdf|title=Kuwait: Selected Issues|page=17|quote=Kuwait has higher female labor market participation than other GCC countries; further improvements in labor force participation can support future growth prospects.

Women in Kuwait have experienced many changes since the discovery of oil. They have a long history of official political and social activism which started in the 1960s and continues today. In the 1950s their access to education and employment increased dramatically.

==Women in the pre-oil era==
From the 17th century until the discovery of oil in the 1950s, the [[economy of Kuwait]] was largely dependent on maritime trade. While men were seafaring, Kuwait’s women managed their homes, and controlled family affairs and finances. For those families that could afford it, houses were built with a courtyard and a [[harem]] where women spent most of their time. This structure, along with high windows and doors that faced into the house rather than the street, removed women from public vision. Urban, upper-class women’s participation in the public sphere was limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=al-Mughni|first=Haya|title=Women in Kuwait: The Politics of Gender|year=2001|publisher=Saqi|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, women from less fortunate circumstances had a much less secluded experience; they went to the [[suq]] on a daily basis, fetched drinking water and washed their families’ clothes on the beach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sweet|first=Louise E.|title=Camel Raiding of North Arabian Bedouin: A Mechanism of Ecological Adaptation|year=1970|location=New York|pages=271}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kuwaiti girls began learning scripture in 1916 when the first Quran school was established. After this many women of modest means began working as religious instructors. The first private school opened in 1926; it taught reading, writing, and [[embroidery]]. Public schooling began in 1937 though enrollment in it was low for some time; however, by the 1940s many young Kuwaiti women were enrolled in primary school. It was often women themselves who pushed for these educational advances and opportunities and in 1956 a group of young women burned their [[abaya|abayyas]] to protest their right to go abroad to study.

==Employment==
The participation of Kuwaiti women in the labor force is much higher than the regional GCC average,&lt;ref name=ilo/&gt; Kuwait has the highest percentage of working female citizens in the GCC.&lt;ref name=gnw/&gt;&lt;ref name="ilo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/@arabstates/@ro-beirut/documents/meetingdocument/wcms_330314.pdf|title=The Kuwaiti Labour Market and Foreign Workers: Understanding the Past and Present to Provide a Way Forward|work=[[International Labour Organization]]|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BfZR8SNg0bwC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq|title=Kuwait: Selected Issues and Statistical Appendix|work=[[International Monetary Fund]] |year=2012|pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kuwaiti women outnumber men in the workforce.&lt;ref name="gnw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/kuwait/kuwait-leads-gulf-states-in-women-in-workforce-1.1705940|title=Kuwait leads Gulf states in women in workforce|work=Gulf News|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, 53% of Kuwaiti women participated in the labor force.&lt;ref name=gend/&gt; Kuwait's labor force participation rate for Kuwaiti women is much higher than the [[Middle East and North Africa|MENA]] average.&lt;ref name=gend/&gt;

==Organizations and activism==
Women’s activism in Kuwait began in the 1950s. The first women’s organization, the Arab Women’s Renaissance Association (later changed to the Family Renaissance Association), was established by Noureya Al-Saddani in 1962 and was soon followed by the Women’s Cultural and Social Society  in February 1963. The Girls Club (Nadi Alfatat) was established in 1975, its initial focus was on women in sport. In 1981 Bayader As-Salam, a religious group whose objective was cultural awareness, was formed. The same year Sheikha Latifa Al-Sabah’s Islamic Care Association was established, it sought to spread Islam and an Islamic lifestyle and conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Al-Saddani|first=Noureya|title=The Arab Women’s Movement in the 20th Century 1917-1981|year=1982|location=Kuwait}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kuwaiti women played a large role in resisting the Iraqi invasion in 1990.  They mobilized the opposition, started an underground resistance paper called “al-Kuwaitiya”, passed weapons and ammunition through Iraqi checkpoints, transported and planted explosives using abayas, collected and distributed food and medicine, and ran shelters for the sick and disabled. During the invasion they also organized a large demonstration in defiance of the invasion, which cost some of them their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maria|first=Julia|author2=Hadi Ridha |title=Women and War: The Role Kuwaiti Women Played During the Iraqi Occupation|journal=Journal of International Development|year=2001|volume=13|pages=583–598|doi=10.1002/jid.782}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women became active in Islamist groups in the 1980s when Islamism was on the rise in Kuwait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hirmats|first=Aiko|title=The Changing Nature of the Parliamentary System in Kuwait: Islamists, Tribes, and Women in Recent Elections|journal=Kyoto Bulletin of Islamic Area Studies|year=2011|volume=4|issue=1&amp;2|pages=62–73|url=http://www.asafas.kyoto-u.ac.jp/kias/pdf/kb4_1and2/08hiramatsu.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through their early activity in these groups, many women acquired organizational skills which they were able to utilize in the campaign for [[suffrage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=al-Mughni|first=Haya|title=L’Émergence du Féminisme Islamique au Koweït|journal=Revue des Mondes Musulmans et de la Méditerranée|year=2010|volume=128|url=http://remmm.revues.org/6899|accessdate=2014-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women in the arts===
Kuwait’s long tradition of artistic expression has been spearheaded and organized by women. Women’s involvement in the fine arts dates back to at least 1969 when Najat Sultan along with her brother Ghazi established the Sultan Gallery, which served as a propagator for contemporary and secular movements in Arab art. The gallery was shut after the Iraqi invasion and reopened in 2006 by Farida Sultan. It currently focuses on contemporary photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sultan Gallery|url=http://www.sultangallery.com/mission-statement/|accessdate=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sheikha Hussah Al Sabah established [[Dar al-Athar al-Islamiyyah]] in 1983, and Dar al-Funoon gallery for contemporary art in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Al-Qassemi|first=Sultan Sooud|title=The Women Trailblazers of Gulf Arab Art|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sultan-sooud-alqassemi/the-women-trailblazers-of-gulf-arab-art_b_3012443.html|accessdate=6 April 2014|newspaper=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political participation==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Kuwaiti girls campaigning in elections.jpg|thumb|left|Young Kuwaiti women campaigning in 2012 elections]] --&gt;
The women's [[suffrage]] campaign started in 1971 when a group led by Noureya Al-Saddani took a proposal to [[National Assembly (Kuwait)|parliament]] to grant women political rights. The proposal was rejected. In the early 1990s, women campaigned heavily for the vote; they held protests outside of election headquarters and between 2000 and 2005 a number of women filed court cases against the Minister of Interior for his refusal to include women in election tables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Haidar|first=Khalil Ali|title=Kuwaiti women's movement and the religious current|url=http://www.14october.com/news.aspx?newsno=3002274|publisher=14 October|accessdate=2014-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 women demonstrated inside the parliament hall for the vote, and a year later they held one of the largest demonstrations in Kuwait’s history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shultziner|first=Doron|author2=Mary Ann Tétreault |title=Paradoxes of Democratic Progress in Kuwait: The Case of the Kuwaiti Women’s Rights Movement|journal=Muslim World Journal of Human Rights|year=2011|volume=7|issue=2|pages=1–25|doi=10.2202/1554-4419.1192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the Emir [[Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah|Sheikh Jaber Al-Sabah]] promulgated a decree granting women [[suffrage]] after the parliament was dissolved, however, it was overturned by the new parliament just months later by two-votes difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alwatan.kuwait.tt/articledetails.aspx?id=434133&amp;yearquarter=20152|title=المرأة الكويتية تحتفل اليوم بالذكرى العاشرة لحصولها على حقوقها السياسية|author=|date=|website=الوطـــن الإلكترونية}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kuwaiti women were granted the right to vote in May 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UN and US congratulate Kuwait over women’s right to vote|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/world/other-world/un-and-us-congratulate-kuwait-over-women-146-s-right-to-vote-1.288029|accessdate=2014-03-15|newspaper=Gulf News|date=May 18, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women voted for the first time in June 2006, and in these elections 28 women ran out of a pool of 250 candidates though none won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Historic first time vote for Kuwaiti women|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/kuwait/historic-first-time-vote-for-kuwaiti-women-1.183897|accessdate=2014-03-15|date=June 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost exactly four years after women were given full political rights, four were elected into parliament for the first time. The winners in the 2009 elections were: [[Massouma Al Mubarak]] (the first Kuwaiti woman appointed to the cabinet), [[Aseel Al Awadhi]], [[Rola Dashti]], and [[Salwa Al Jassar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kuwaiti women in first-ever win of four parliamentary seats|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/kuwait/kuwaiti-women-in-first-ever-win-of-four-parliamentary-seats-1.2021|accessdate=2014-03-15|newspaper=Gulf News|date=May 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Kuwait was ranked highest of all [[Arab states|Arab countries]] in [[gender equality]] in the [[Human Development Report]]'s [[Gender Inequality Index]].&lt;ref name="eq"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://chronicle.fanack.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2014/10/gender-inequality_kuwait_gender_730px_03_c1f442976a.jpg|title=Gender inequality |publisher=fanack.com |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable Kuwaiti women==
* [[Noureya Al-Saddani]]: An author, historian, broadcaster and director, Al-Saddani started the first women’s organization in Kuwait.  In 1971 she proposed to the National Assembly to grant women's political rights. During the invasion she worked in charity and mobilized the [[diaspora]]; upon her return to Kuwait she put together radio biographies of all the female martyrs in the invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Basha|first=Sadoon|title=Noureya Al-Saddani|url=http://www.kuwait-history.net/vb/showthread.php?t=5496|publisher=History of Kuwait|accessdate=2014-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Loulwa Abdulwahab Essa Al-Qatami]]: Al-Qatami the first woman to study abroad, she left Kuwait on 12/6/1955 for a degree in Education.

==Non-national women==
