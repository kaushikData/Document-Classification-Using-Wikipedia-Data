'''Alfred Lyall''' (6 February 1796 – 11 September 1865) was an English philosopher, editor, clergyman and traveller.

== Early life ==
Alfred Lyall was the youngest son of John Lyall (1752–1805), of [[Findon, Sussex]], and Jane Comyn (c.1756–1824). His eldest brother [[George Lyall, Snr|George Lyall]], sometime member of parliament for the [[City of London]], became Chairman of the [[East India Company]]. Of his other brothers to reach maturity, John Lyall was a Lieutenant-Colonel in the [[Bombay Army]], at that time under the command of the East India Company, Haseldine Lyall joined the [[Royal Navy]], while [[William Rowe Lyall]] entered the church and became [[Dean of Canterbury]].

Lyall was educated at [[Eton College|Eton]],&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[Dictionary of National Biography|DNB]]'' claims that he was in the same form as the poet [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], though this is disputed by Venn.&lt;/ref&gt; matriculated at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], in November 1813, and graduated Bachelor of Arts in 1818.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id= LL813A|name=Lyall, Alfred}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this he spent some time studying and travelling on the Continent, with extended stays in [[Frankfurt]] and [[Geneva]]. Lyall was especially drawn to Italy, where he acquired some knowledge of art. He was an incessant reader, a serious student of history and philosophical works, but also a lover of poetry.

By 1820 all of Lyall's surviving brothers and sisters were married and settled, while he was still a bachelor, living with his widowed mother at The Square, [[Findon, West Sussex|Findon]], West Sussex. The property is known today as Grey Point. Findon records show that another property called Avery's, larger but less elegant, located a short distance away, also belonged to the Lyall family around this time.

== Literary interests ==
Lyall literary leanings brought him an invitation to become editor of ''[[The Annual Register]]'', an influential review, which he did from 1822 until 1827, returning to it again in 1837. The winter of 1825–1826 he passed visiting [[Madeira]] and [[Portugal]]. On his return he published in 1827 a comprehensive narrative entitled ''Rambles in Madeira and in Portugal''. The book was accompanied by a folio volume of lithographic sketches by his friend and fellow traveller [[James Bulwer]], an accomplished artist and keen naturalist.

Subsequently, Lyall returned to Findon and immersed himself in metaphysical studies. His elder brother William Rowe Lyall, taking him in hand, steered him towards an ecclesiastical career.  The church was considered a good choice for educated gentry without private means, as it offered a secure and comfortable benefice, while generally allowing the incumbent enough leisure time to pursue literary interests. Before yielding to his brother's advice Lyall wrote a second book, entitled ''A Review of the Principles of Necessary and Contingent Truth'', published anonymously in 1830. This was a complex metaphysical discourse mainly attacking the theories of [[David Hume|Hume]] and [[Thomas Reid|Reid]]. It was intended as an introduction to a projected work of several volumes that was never executed.

== Career and family ==
Lyall took holy orders in 1829, and was appointed curate in Findon. Around the time of his ordination he became engaged to a 20-year-old girl from another old Scots family. Mary Drummond Broadwood (1809–1878) was the fourth daughter of James Schudi Broadwood (1778–1851) of nearby Lyne House, Surrey. Mary's paternal grandfather [[John Broadwood]] had established the [[Broadwood and Sons|Broadwood piano company]] after marrying the daughter of his business partner [[Burkat Schudi]], the Swiss harpsichord maker. Mary's mother was Margaret Schaw Stewart (1778–1849), whose great-uncle was Daniel Stewart of Glenbuckie, best remembered for his association with [[Bonnie Prince Charlie]] and the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]].

The couple were married in December 1830 and by 1835 had moved to [[Coulsdon]], where Alfred was acting as curate in charge. Subsequently, in 1837, he was appointed vicar of [[Godmersham]] in Kent.

At the request of the publishers [[Rivingtons (publishers)|Rivingtons]], Lyall resumed editorship of ''The Annual Register'' after moving to Godmersham, but was soon forced to relinquish the work due to health problems. Thereafter he continued to make sporadic literary contributions to other publications. Most notably in 1848 he was asked to collaborate on the ''[[Encyclopedia Metropolitana]]'', an ambitious project conceived by [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] for the dissemination of universal knowledge, and published in a series of main divisions, over a number of years, each division consisting of multiple volumes. Lyall contributed to the ''Third Division: History of the Christian Church, covering the fourth to twelfth centuries'', which appeared in 1850–51. In 1856 he published another book anonymously, entitled ''Agonistes, or Philosophical Strictures'', which gained him a certain literary reputation. This was his third and last sole-authorship book, a collection of polemics attacking the high churchmen's enemies of the day, most particularly the philosophical theories of [[John Stuart Mill]].

Nine children of the marriage survived, two of which – [[Alfred Comyn Lyall]] and [[James Broadwood Lyall]] – had distinguished careers in [[British India]], leading to Lieutenant-Governorships and knighthoods.

== Later life ==
The family's final move came in 1848, when they relocated to [[Harbledown]], a small parish located on a rise overlooking the cathedral city of [[Canterbury]], where his older brother was now [[Dean of Canterbury|Dean]]. Alfred did not naturally have the makings of a parish priest – he was too remote from the ordinary people of his congregation, a shortcoming his wife appears to have energetically made up for with charitable work. Despite being a little too 'broad' in his views for a country parson he seems to have given what was expected of him, and was by all accounts well liked and respected by the community he served. Nonetheless, it was wise to take the precaution of publishing his philosophical works anonymously, for it was not altogether appropriate that he should be seen by his congregation as engaging in metaphysical arguments on subjects deemed outside the realm of his parish duties. In any event, his intended circle of readers was undoubtedly well aware of the author's identity – there was little need to advertise his writings further than necessary.

Alfred Lyall remained as rector of Harbledown for the remainder of his life. He died while on a visit to [[Llangollen]], Wales, on 11 September 1865, and was buried at the parish church of St. Michael's, Harbledown, where there is a tablet to his memory.

In [[biology]], '''altruism''' refers to behaviour by an individual that increases the [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor.&lt;ref name="Bell2008"&gt;{{cite book| last = Bell| first = Graham| title = Selection: The Mechanism of Evolution| year = 2008| publisher = Oxford University Press| location = Oxford| isbn = 0-19-856972-6| pages = 367–368 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Altruism in this sense is different from the philosophical concept of altruism, in which an action would only be called "altruistic" if it was done with the conscious intention of helping another. In the behavioural sense, there is no such requirement. As such, it is not evaluated in moral terms—it is the consequences of an action for reproductive fitness that determine whether the action is considered altruistic, not the intentions, if any, with which the action is performed.&lt;ref name="Okasha"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/altruism-biological/|title=Biological altruism|author=Okasha, S.|publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|year=2008|accessdate=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term altruism was coined by the French philosopher [[Auguste Comte]] in French, as ''altruisme'', for an [[antonym]] of egoism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=altruism (n .)|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=altruism|work=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=Douglas Harper|accessdate=September 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Teske|first1=Nathan|title=Political Activists in America: The Identity Construction Model of Political Participation|date=2009|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|location=University Park, Pa.|isbn=9780271035468|page=101|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7B38I2UEPa0C&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt; He derived it from an Italian ''altrui'', which in turn was derived from Latin ''alteri'', meaning "other people" or "somebody else".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ciciloni|first1=Ferdinando|title=A Grammar of the Italian Language|date=1825|publisher=John Murray|location=London|page=64|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=neAGAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Altruistic behaviours appear most obviously in [[Kin selection|kin relationships]], such as in parenting, but may also be evident among wider social groups, such as in social insects. They allow an individual to increase the success of its genes by helping relatives that share those genes.&lt;ref name="DaviesKrebs2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nicholas B. Davies|author2=John R. Krebs|author3=Stuart A. West|title=An Introduction to Behavioural Ecology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G9mXO5asWi8C|date=April 9, 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-3949-9|pages=307–333|chapter=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obligate altruism is the permanent loss of direct fitness (with potential for indirect fitness gain). For example, honey bee workers may forage for the colony. Facultative altruism is temporary loss of direct fitness (with potential for indirect fitness gain followed by personal reproduction); for example, a [[Florida scrub jay]] helping at the nest, then gaining parental territory.&lt;ref&gt;{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR by John Alcock 9th edition}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
In the science of [[ethology]] (the study of behavior), and more generally in the study of [[social evolution]], on occasion, some animals do behave in ways that reduce their individual fitness but increase the fitness of other individuals in the population; this is a functional definition of altruism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = [[Robert L. Trivers]] | title = The Evolution of Reciprocal Altruism | journal = [[The Quarterly Review of Biology]] | volume = 46 | issue = 1
 | year = 1971 | page = 35 | url = https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2822435?uid=3738032&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101295513123 | doi = 10.1086/406755}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research in [[evolutionary theory]] has been applied to social behaviour, including altruism. Cases of animals helping individuals to whom they are closely related can be explained by [[kin selection]], and are not considered true altruism. Beyond the physical exertions that in some species mothers and in some species fathers undertake to protect their young, extreme examples of sacrifice may occur. One example is [[matriphagy]] (the consumption of the mother by her offspring) in the spider ''[[Stegodyphus]]''; another example is a male spider allowing a female fertilized by him to eat him. [[Hamilton's rule]] describes the benefit of such altruism in terms of [[Sewall Wright|Wright's]] [[coefficient of relationship]] to the beneficiary and the benefit granted to the beneficiary minus the cost to the sacrificer. Should this sum be greater than zero a fitness gain will result from the sacrifice.

When apparent altruism is not between kin, it may be based on [[reciprocal altruism|reciprocity]]. A monkey will present its back to another monkey, who will pick out parasites; after a time the roles will be reversed. Such reciprocity will pay off, in evolutionary terms, as long as the costs of helping are less than the benefits of being helped and as long as animals will not gain in the long run by "cheating"—that is to say, by receiving favours without returning them. This is elaborated on in [[evolutionary game theory]] and specifically the [[prisoner's dilemma]] as social theory.

==Implications in evolutionary theory==
[[Image:Canis lupus pack surrounding Bison.jpg|thumb|right| 250 px|Cooperative hunting by wolves allows them to tackle much larger and more nutritious prey than any individual wolf could handle. However, such cooperation could, potentially, be exploited by selfish individuals who do not expose themselves to the dangers of the hunt, but nevertheless share in the spoils.]]
The existence of altruism in nature is at first sight puzzling, because altruistic behaviour reduces the likelihood that an individual will reproduce. {{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} The idea that ''[[group selection]]'' might explain the evolution of altruism was first broached by Darwin himself in [[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex]], (1871). The concept of group selection has had a chequered and controversial history in evolutionary biology but the uncritical 'good of the species' tradition came to an abrupt halt in the 1960s, due largely to the work of [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]],&lt;ref&gt;[[George C. Williams (biologist)|Williams, G.C.]] (1972) [[Adaptation and Natural Selection: A Critique of Some Current Evolutionary Thought]].

(2012). [http://edge.org/conversation/the-false-allure-of-group-selection The False Allure of Group Selection].  Edge,  Jun 19, 2012.  http://edge.org/conversation/the-false-allure-of-group-selection&lt;/ref&gt; These evolutionary theorists pointed out that [[natural selection]] acts on the individual, and that it is the individual's fitness (number of offspring and grand-offspring produced compared to the rest of the population) that drives evolution. A group advantage (e.g. hunting in a pack) that is disadvantageous to the individual (who might be harmed during the hunt, when it could avoid injury by hanging back from the pack but still share in the spoils) cannot evolve, because the selfish individual will leave, on average, more offspring than those who join the pack and suffer injuries as a result. If the selfishness is hereditary, this will ultimately result in the population consisting entirely of selfish individuals. However, in the 1960s and 1970s an alternative to the "group selection" theory emerged. This was the [[kin selection]] theory, due originally to [[W. D. Hamilton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = W. D. | year = 1964 | title = The genetical evolution of social behaviour, I and II. | doi = 10.1016/0022-5193(64)90038-4| journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 1–16, 17–32 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kin selection is an instance of [[inclusive fitness]], which is based on the notion that an individual shares only half its genes with each offspring, but also with each full [[Sib (anthropology)|sib]] (See footnote{{#tag:ref |An individual's gene complement (or genome) can be represented by the letters of the alphabet. Each letter is represented twice: A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The subscript indicates from which parent that copy of A has come. Mostly the two copies are identical, but occasionally they differ slightly.

When this individual reproduces sexually, one or other copy of A (chosen randomly) is passed on to offspring-1, who gets its other copy of A from the sexual partner. The same happens with genes B, C, D …. Z. If we denote the two sexual partners by means of  subscripts "m" and "f", then the genome of the offspring they produce might consist of A&lt;sub&gt;m2&lt;/sub&gt;/A&lt;sub&gt;f1&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;m2&lt;/sub&gt;/B&lt;sub&gt;f2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;m1&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;f1&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;m1&lt;/sub&gt;/D&lt;sub&gt;f1&lt;/sub&gt; …… Z&lt;sub&gt;m1&lt;/sub&gt;/Z&lt;sub&gt;f2&lt;/sub&gt;. Each parent has contributed exactly half of the offspring's genome. So individual "m" shares only half of its genome with its offspring.
Suppose individuals "m" and "f" produce a second offspring (offspring-2), whose genome is determined in exactly the same manner. For this example, suppose their genome consists of 52 genes. There is a coin-flip 50% probability that offspring-2 will inherit the same copy of A from "m" as offspring-1 did (i.e. A&lt;sub&gt;m2&lt;/sub&gt;). This also applies to gene B and so on through the alphabet. If a coin-flip "heads" means that gene X is the same in offspring-1 as it is in offspring-2, then in 26 flips of the coin, approximately half are going to be "heads", and the rest "tails", i.e. half the genes inherited from parent "m" will be the same in the two offspring. The same will happen to the genes inherited from parent "f". Thus of the 52 genes inherited from the two parents, on average, 13&amp;nbsp;+ &amp;nbsp;13&amp;nbsp;= &amp;nbsp;26 (or half) will be identical in the two sibs.
Thus sibs are genetically as similar to one another as a parent is to an offspring.&lt;ref&gt;Grafen, A. (1984) Natural selection, kin selection and group selection. In Krebs, J.R. &amp; Davies, N.B. (Eds.) ‘' Behavioural Ecology. An Evolutionary Approach.'' (p. 70-71). Oxford: Blackwell Scientific Publications. {{ISBN|0632009985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=maynardsmith&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maynard Smith|first1 =J.|title=Evolutionary Genetics.|date=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0198542151|pages=173–175|url= |chapter=Evolution in structured populations. }}&lt;/ref&gt; |group=nb}}). From an evolutionary genetic point of view it is therefore as advantageous to help with the upbringing of full sibs as it is to produce and raise one's own offspring. The two activities are evolutionarily entirely equivalent. Co-operative breeding (i.e. helping one's parents raise sibs—provided they are full sibs) could thus evolve without the need for group-level selection. This  quickly gained prominence among biologists interested in the evolution of social behaviour.&lt;ref name="Okasha" /&gt;
[[File:Grooming monkeys.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Olive baboons grooming]]
In 1971 [[Robert Trivers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi =10.1086/406755|last=Trivers|first= R.L.|year=1971|title=The evolution of reciprocal altruism|journal=Quarterly Review of Biology| volume= 46|pages= 35–57|pmid =}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced his [[reciprocal altruism]] theory to explain the evolution of helping at the nest of an unrelated breeding pair of birds. He argued that an individual might act as a helper if there was a high probabilistic expectation of being helped by the recipients at some later date. If, however, the recipients did not reciprocate when it was possible to do so, the altruistic interaction with these recipients would be permanently terminated. But if the recipients did not cheat then the reciprocal altruism would continue indefinitely to both parties' advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Emlen, S.T. (1984) Cooperative breeding in birds and mammals.

However, Trivers did make reference to the [[Prisoner's dilemma|Prisoner's Dilemma Game]] which, 10 years later, would restore interest in Trivers' reciprocal altruism theory, but under the title of "tit-for-tat".&lt;ref name=axelrod&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.7466396|last1=Axelrod |first1=R.|last2=Hamilton|first2=W.D.|year = 1981 | title = The evolution of cooperation|url = | journal = Science |volume = 211 | issue =|pages = 1390–1396 |pmid =7466396|bibcode = 1981Sci...211.1390A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its original form the Prisoner's Dilemma Game (PDG) described two awaiting trial prisoners, A and B, each faced with the choice of betraying the other or remaining silent. The "[[Game theory|game]]" has four possible outcomes: (a) they both betray each other, and are both sentenced to two years in prison; (b) A betrays B, which sets A free and B is sentenced to four years in prison; (c) B betrays A, with the same result as (b) except that it is B who is set free and the other spends four years in jail; (d) both remain silent, resulting in a six-month sentence each. Clearly (d) ("cooperation") is the best mutual strategy, but from the point of view of the individual betrayal is  unbeatable (resulting in being set free, or getting only a two-year sentence). Remaining silent results in a four-year or six-month sentence. This is exemplified by a further example of the PDG:  two strangers attend a restaurant together and decide to split the bill. The mutually best ploy would be for both parties to order the cheapest items on the menu (mutual cooperation). But if one member of the party exploits the situation by ordering the most expensive items, then it is best for the other member to do likewise. In fact, if the fellow diner's personality is completely unknown, and the two diners are unlikely ever to meet again, it is always in one's own best interests to eat as expensively as possible. Situations in nature that are subject to the same dynamics (rewards and penalties) as the PDG define cooperative behaviour: it is never in the individual's fitness interests to cooperate, even though mutual cooperation rewards the two contestants (together) more highly than any other strategy.&lt;ref name=sigmund&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sigmund|first1 =K.|title=Games of Life.|date=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=|pages=180–206|url= |chapter= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooperation cannot evolve under these circumstances.

However, in 1981 Axelrod and Hamilton&lt;ref name=axelrod /&gt; noted that if the same contestants in the PDG meet repeatedly (the so-called Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game, IPD) then tit-for-tat (foreshadowed by Robert Triver's reciprocal altruism theory) is a robust strategy which promotes altruism.&lt;ref name=axelrod /&gt;&lt;ref name=sigmund /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maynard Smith|first1 =J.|title=Evolutionary Genetics|date=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0198542151|pages=168–169, 181–183|url= |chapter=Evolution in structured populations}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "tit-for-tat" both players' opening moves are cooperation. Thereafter each contestant repeats the other player's last move, resulting in a seemingly endless sequence of mutually cooperative moves. However, mistakes severely undermine tit-for-tat's effectiveness, giving rise to prolonged sequences of betrayal, which can only be rectified by another mistake. Since these initial discoveries, all the other possible IPD game strategies have been identified (16 possibilities in all, including, for instance, "generous tit-for-tat", which behaves like "tit-for-tat", except that it cooperates with a small probability when the opponent's last move was "betray".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Godfray, H.C.J. | title = The evolution of forgiveness | journal = Nature | volume = 355 | issue =  |date=1992 | pages = 206–207 | doi =  10.1038/355206a0| pmid =|bibcode = 1992Natur.355..206G }}&lt;/ref&gt;), but all can be outperformed by at least one of the other strategies, should one of the players switch to such a strategy.

In the light of the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Game failing to provide a full answer to the evolution of cooperation or altruism, several alternative explanations have been proposed.

There are striking parallels between altruistic acts and exaggerated [[Sexual selection|sexual ornaments]] displayed by some animals, particularly certain bird species, such as, amongst others, the [[Peafowl|peacock]]. Both are costly in fitness terms, and both are generally conspicuous to other members of the population or species. This led [[Amotz Zahavi]] to suggest that both might be [[Signalling theory|fitness signals]] rendered evolutionarily stable by his [[handicap principle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Amotz |last=Zahavi |year=1975 |title=Mate selection—a selection for a handicap |journal=[[Journal of Theoretical Biology]] |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=205–214 |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(75)90111-3 |pmid=1195756}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zahavi&gt;{{cite journal |first=Amotz |last=Zahavi |year=1977 |title=The cost of honesty (Further remarks on the handicap principle) |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=67 |issue=3 |pages=603–605 |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(77)90061-3 |pmid=904334}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Amotz |last=Zahavi |year=1997 |title=The handicap principle: a missing piece of Darwin's puzzle |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-510035-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If a signal is to remain reliable, and generally resistant to falsification, [[Signalling theory#The sports handicapping metaphor|the signal]] has to be evolutionarily costly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Grafen |first=A. |year=1990 |title=Biological signals as handicaps |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=144 |issue=4 |pages=517–546 |doi=10.1016/S0022-5193(05)80088-8 |pmid=2402153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, if a (low fitness) liar were to use the highly costly signal, which seriously eroded its real fitness, it would find it difficult to maintain a semblance or normality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Johnstone |first=RA |first2=A |last2=Grafen |year=1993 |title=Dishonesty and the handicap principle |journal=Anim. Behav. |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=759H. Carl 764 |doi=10.1006/anbe.1993.1253}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zahavi borrowed the term "handicap principle" from sports handicapping systems. These systems are aimed at reducing disparities in performance, thereby making the outcome of contests less predictable. In a horse [[Handicap (horse racing)|handicap race]], provenly faster horses are given heavier weights to carry under their saddles than inherently slower horses. Similarly, in [[Golf handicap|amateur golf]], better golfers have fewer strokes subtracted from their raw scores than the less talented players. The handicap therefore correlates with unhandicapped performance, making it possible, if one knows nothing about the horses, to predict which unhandicapped horse would win an open race. It would be the one handicapped with the greatest weight in the saddle. The handicaps in nature are highly visible, and therefore a peahen, for instance, would be able to deduce the health of a potential mate by comparing its handicap (the size of the peacock's tail) with those of the other males. The loss of the male's fitness caused by the handicap is offset by its increased access to females, which is as much of a fitness concern as is its health. An altruistic act is, by definition, similarly costly. It would therefore also signal fitness, and is probably as attractive to females as a physical handicap. If this is the case altruism is evolutionarily stabilized by [[sexual selection]].&lt;ref name=zahavi /&gt;

There is an alternate strategy for identifying fit mates which does not rely on one gender having exaggerated sexual ornaments or other handicaps, but is generally applicable to most, if not all sexual creatures. It derives from the concept that the change in appearance and functionality caused by a [[Silent mutation|non-silent]] [[mutation]] will generally stand out in a population. This is because that altered appearance and functionality will be unusual, peculiar, and different from the norm within that population. The norm against which these unusual features are judged is made up of fit attributes that have attained their plurality through [[natural selection]], while less adaptive attributes will be in the minority or frankly rare.&lt;ref name=fisher&gt;Fisher R. (1930) ''The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the overwhelming majority of mutant features are maladaptive, and it is impossible to predict evolution's future direction, sexual creatures would be expected to [[Koinophilia|prefer mates with the least number of unusual or minority features]].&lt;ref name=fisher /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Symons, D.

Once a population has become as homogeneous in appearance as is typical of most species, its entire repertoire of behaviours will also be rendered [[Evolutionarily stable strategy|evolutionarily stable]], including any altruistic, cooperative and social characteristics. Thus, in the example of the selfish individual who hangs back from the rest of the hunting pack, but who nevertheless joins in the spoils, that individual will be recognized as being different from the norm, and will therefore find it difficult to attract a mate.&lt;ref name="Koeslag, 1990" /&gt; Its genes will therefore have only a very small probability of being passed on to the next generation, thus evolutionarily stabilizing cooperation and social interactions at whatever level of complexity is the norm in that population.&lt;ref name=koeslag1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=koeslag3&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/s0022-5193(03)00188-7|last1 = Koeslag|first1 = J.H.| year = 2003 |title = Evolution of cooperation: cooperation defeats defection in the cornfield model |url = | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology| volume = 224 |issue = | pages = 399–410 |pmid =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reciprocity mechanisms ==
Altruism in animals describes a range of behaviors performed by animals that may be to their own disadvantage but which benefit others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/altruism |title=Altruism &amp;#124; Define Altruism at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The costs and benefits are measured in terms of reproductive fitness, or expected number of offspring. So by behaving altruistically, an organism reduces the number of offspring it is likely to produce itself, but boosts the likelihood that other organisms are to produce offspring. There are other forms of altruism in nature other than risk-taking behavior, such as reciprocal altruism. This biological notion of altruism is not identical to the everyday human concept. For humans, an action would only be called 'altruistic' if it was done with the conscious intention of helping another. Yet in the biological sense there is no such requirement. Instead, until we can communicate directly with other species, an accurate theory to describe altruistic acts between species is Biological Market Theory.
Humans and other animals exchange benefits in several ways, known technically as reciprocity mechanism. No matter what the mechanism, the common thread is that benefits find their way back to the original giver.

=== Symmetry-based ===
Also known as the "buddy-system", mutual affection between two parties prompts similar behavior in both directions without need to track of daily give-and-take, so long as the overall relationship remains satisfactory. This is one of the most common mechanism of reciprocity in nature, this kind is present in humans, primates, and many other mammals.

=== Attitudinal ===
Also known as, "If you're nice, I'll be nice too." This mechanism of reciprocity is similar to the heuristic of the golden rule, "Treat others how you would like to be treated." Parties mirror one another's attitudes, exchanging favors on the spot. Instant attitudinal reciprocity occurs among monkeys, and people often rely on it with strangers and acquaintances.

=== Calculated ===
Also known as, "what have you done for me lately?" Individuals keep track of the benefits they exchange with particular partners, which helps them decide to whom to return favors. This mechanism is typical of chimpanzees and very common among human relationships.&lt;ref&gt;DeWaal, F. B. M. 2005. "How animals do business." ??(?) ''Scientific American''.&lt;/ref&gt;
Yet some opposing experimental research suggests that calculated or contingent reciprocity does not spontaneously arise in laboratory experimental settings, despite patterns of behavior.

== Biological market theory ==
Biological market theory is an extension of the idea of reciprocal altruism, as a mechanism to explain altruistic acts between unrelated individuals in a more flexible system of exchanging commodities. The term 'biological market' was first used by Ronald Noe and Hammerstein in 1994 to refer to all the interactions between organisms in which different organisms function as 'traders' that exchange goods and services such as food and water, grooming, warning calls, shelter, etc. Biological market theory consists of five formal characteristics which present a basis for altruism.

# Commodities are exchanged between individuals that differ in the degree of control over those commodities.
# Trading partners are chosen from a number of potential partners.
# There is competition among the members of the chosen class to be the most attractive partner. This competition by 'outbidding' causes an increase in the value of the commodity offered.
# Supply and demand determine the bartering value of commodities exchanged.
# Commodities on offer can be advertised. As in commercial advertisements there is a potential for false information.&lt;ref&gt;Noë, R., &amp; Voelkl, B. (2013).

The applicability of biological market theory with its emphasis on partner choice is evident in the interactions between the [[cleaner wrasse]] and its "client" [[reef fish]]. [[Cleaner fish|Cleaners]] have small territories, which the majority of reef fish species actively visit to invite inspection of their surface, gills, and mouth. Clients benefit from the removal of [[Fish diseases and parasites|parasites]] while cleaners benefit from the access to a food source. Some particularly choosy client species have large home ranges that cover several [[cleaning station]]s, whereas other clients have small ranges and have access to one cleaning station only (resident clients). Field observations, field manipulations, and laboratory experiments revealed that whether or not a client has choice options influences several aspects of both cleaner and client behaviour. Cleaners give choosy clients priority of access. Choosy clients switch partners if cheated by a cleaner by taking a bite of out of the cleaner, whereas resident clients punish cheats. Cleaners and resident clients, but not choosy clients, build up relationships before normal cleaning interactions take place. Cleaners are particularly cooperative if choosy clients are bystanders of an interaction but less so when resident clients are bystanders.&lt;ref&gt;Bshary, R., &amp; Noë, R. (2003).

Hammerstein (Ed.), ''Genetic and cultural evolution of cooperation'' (pp. 167–184). Cambridge, MA US: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers tested whether wild white-handed [[gibbon]] males from [[Khao Yai National Park]], Thailand, increased their grooming activity when the female partner was fertile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barelii|first1=C|last2=Reichard|first2=U|last3=Mundry|first3=R|title=Is grooming used as a commodity in wild white-handed gibbons, Hylobates lar?|journal=Animal Behaviour|date=2011|volume=82|issue=4|pages=801–809|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2011.07.012}}&lt;!--|accessdate=10 January 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Adult females and males of our study population are codominant (in terms of aggression), they live in pairs or small multi male groups and mate promiscuously. They found that males groomed females more than vice versa and more grooming was exchanged when females were cycling than during pregnancy or lactation. The number of copulations/day was elevated when females were cycling, and females copulated more frequently with males on days when they received more grooming. When males increased their grooming efforts, females also increased their grooming of males, perhaps to equalize give and take. Although grooming might be reciprocated because of intrinsic benefits of receiving grooming, males also interchange grooming as a commodity for sexual opportunities during a female's fertile period.{{clarify|date=August 2014}}{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

It has been theorized that they may do this to promote group cohesion and reduce social disruption within the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krueger|first=Konstanze|last2=Schneider|first2=Gudrun|last3=Flauger|first3=Birgit|last4=Heinze|first4=Jürgen|title=Context-dependent third-party intervention in agonistic encounters of male Przewalski horses|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.beproc.2015.10.009|journal=Behavioural Processes|volume=121|pages=54–62|doi=10.1016/j.beproc.2015.10.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Birds===
* In numerous bird species, a breeding pair receives support in raising its young from other "helper" birds,  including help with the feeding of its fledglings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/16/AR2007081602257.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Birds' Cooperative Breeding Sheds Light on Altruism | first=David | last=Brown | date=August 17, 2007 | accessdate=April 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some will even go as far as protecting an unrelated bird's young from predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1200/is_n23_v135/ai_7680117 | work=Science News | title=Avian altruism: African birds sacrifice self-interest to help their kin – white-fronted bee eaters | first=Kathy A. | last=Fackelmann | year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fish===
* ''[[Harpagifer|Harpagifer bispinis]]'', a species of fish, live in social groups in the harsh environment of the [[Antarctic Peninsula]]. If the parent guarding the nest of eggs is removed, a usually male replacement unrelated to the parents guards the nest from predators and prevents fungal growth that would kill off the brood. There is no clear benefit to the male so the act may be considered altruistic.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, R.A. "Nest Guard Replacement in the Antarctic Fish Harpagifer bispinis: Possible Altruistic Behavior." Science, New Series. Vol. 205 No. 4408: (1979): p. 831–833.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples in invertebrates==
* Some [[Globitermes sulphureus|termites]] and [[Camponotus saundersi|ants]] release a sticky secretion by fatally rupturing a specialized gland.  This [[autothysis]] altruistically aids the [[Ant colony|colony]] at the expense of the individual insect. For example, defending against invading ants by creating a [[tar baby]] effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Bordereau, C., Robert, A., Van Tuyen V. &amp; A. Peppuy |year=1997 |title=Suicidal defensive behavior by frontal gland dehiscence in ''Globitermes sulphureus'' Haviland soldiers (Isoptera) |journal=Insectes Sociaux |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=289–297 |doi=10.1007/s000400050049}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be attributed to the fact that ants share their [[gene]]s with the entire [[ant colony|colony]], and so this behaviour is evolutionarily beneficial (not necessarily for the individual ant but for the continuation of its specific genetic make-up).
* [[Synalpheus regalis]] is a species of eusocial marine [[Synalpheus regalis|snapping shrimp]] that lives in [[sponge]]s in [[coral reef]]s. They live in colonies of about 300 individuals with one reproductive female.&lt;ref name=Coral&gt;{{cite journal |author=J.

==Examples in protists==
An interesting example of altruism is found in the cellular [[slime mould]]s, such as ''[[Dictyostelid|Dictyostelium]] mucoroides''.

==Biography==
Born of very humble parents at [[Laon]] before the middle of the 11th century, he is said to have studied under [[Anselm of Canterbury|Saint Anselm]] at [[Bec Abbey|Bec]],&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Anselm of Laon|volume=2|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this is almost certainly incorrect. Other potential teachers of Anselm have been identified, including [[Bruno of Cologne]] and [[Manegold of Lautenbach]]. By around 1080, he had moved back to his place of birth and was teaching at the [[cathedral school]] of Laon, with his brother Ralph. Around 1109, he became dean and chancellor of the cathedral, and in 1115 he was one of Laon's two archdeacons.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} His school for theology and [[exegesis]] rapidly became the most well known in Europe.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; Famously, in 1113, he expelled [[Peter Abelard]] from his school.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The ''Liber Pancrisi'' ({{circa|lk=no|1120}}) names him, with [[Ivo of Chartres]] and [[William of Champeaux]], as one of the three modern masters.

== Works ==
[[Image:Anselm Sentences.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Systematic Sentences attributed to St. Anselm of Laon.]][[File:The Rebdorf Psalter Gloss by Anselm.jpg|thumb|250px|The Rebdorf Psalter: Book of Psalms with Gloss by Anselm of Laon.]]
Anselm's greatest work, an interlinear and marginal [[Gloss (annotation)|gloss]] on the 'Scriptures', the [[Glossa ordinaria]], now attributed to him and his followers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lindberg |first=David |year=1978 |title=Science in the Middle Ages |location=Chicago |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0226482324 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the great intellectual achievements of the [[Middle Ages]]. It has been frequently reprinted.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; The significance of the gloss, which was most likely assembled after Anselm's death by his students, such as [[Gilbert de la Porrée]], and based on Anselm's teaching, is that it marked a new way of learning&amp;nbsp;— it represented the birth of efforts to present discrete [[patristic]] and earlier medieval interpretations of individual verses of Scripture in a readily accessible, easily  referenced way. This theme was subsequently adopted and extended by the likes of [[Hugh of St. Victor]], [[Peter Lombard]] and later [[Thomas Aquinas]], who gave us 'handbooks' for what we would now call [[theology]].

Other commentaries apparently by Anselm have been ascribed to various writers, principally to Anselm of Canterbury.{{refn|A list of them, with notice of Anselm's life, is contained in the ''[[Histoire littéraire de la France]]'', x. 170-189.}}&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

The works are collected in [[Jacques Paul Migne|Migne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Migne |first=Jacques Paul |title=Patrologiae Cursus Completus, [[Patrologia Latina]], ''Vol. CLXII'' }}. {{la icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his ''Sententiae'' were edited at Milan by G. Lefevre in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Hauréau |first=Barthélemy |author-link=Barthélemy Hauréau |title=Journal des savants |date=1895 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; The commentary on the Psalms attributed to [[Haymo of Halberstadt]] by Migne&lt;ref&gt;''PL'', Vol. CXVI.&lt;/ref&gt; has also been identified as possibly being the work of Anselm.

===''The Myth of the Rational Voter''===
''[[The Myth of the Rational Voter]]: Why Democracies Choose Bad Policies'', published
in 2007, further develops the "rational irrationality" concept from Caplan's earlier academic writing. It draws heavily from the ''Survey of Americans and Economists on the Economy'' in making the argument that voters have systematically biased beliefs about many important economic topics. Caplan writes that [[rational irrationality]] is an explanation for the failure of democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Block|first1=Walter|title=Review of "The Myth of the Rational Voter"|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/defending-the-undefendable/201112/review-the-myth-the-rational-voter|accessdate=29 September 2016|work=Psychology Today|publisher=Sussex|date=Dec 25, 2011|ref=PsychToday}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was reviewed in the popular press, including ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118401997995161399|title = Casting a Ballot With A Certain Cast of Mind|last = Casse|first = Daniel|date = 2007-07-10|accessdate = 2013-09-29|work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/27/magazine/27wwln-idealab-t.html?_r=0|title = Clueless|last = Bass|first = Gary J.|date = 2007-05-27|work=The New York Times|accessdate = 2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The New Yorker]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2007/07/09/070709crbo_books_menand|title = Fractured Franchise: Are the wrong people voting?|last = Menand|first = Louis|date = 2007-07-09|work =The New Yorker''|accessdate = 2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in academic publications such as the ''[[Journal of Libertarian Studies]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/journals/jls/22_1/22_1_35.pdf|title = ''The Myth of the Rational Voter'' (book review)|last = Block|first = Walter|publisher = ''[[Journal of Libertarian Studies]]'', Vol. 22 (2011), Page 689-718|accessdate = 2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Public Choice]]'',&lt;ref name=LomaskyReview&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/k6396012k8647800/|title = Swing and a myth: a review of Caplan's ''The Myth of the Rational Voter''|last = Lomasky|first = Loren|date = June 2008|accessdate = 2013-09-29|doi=10.1007/s11127-007-9273-7|volume=135|issue=3–4|journal=Public Choice|pages=469–484}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Libertarian Papers]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libertarianpapers.org/articles/2010/lp-2-28.pdf|title = Critique of Caplan's ''The Myth of the Rational Voter''|last = Farrand|first = Stuart|year = 2010|publisher = ''[[Libertarian Papers]]'', Vol. 2, Article No. 28|accessdate = 2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Independent Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.org/publications/tir/article.asp?a=723|title = The Myth of the Rational Voter: Why Democracies Choose Bad Policies (book review)|last = Callahan|first = Gene|date = Winter 2009|accessdate = 2013-09-29|publisher = ''[[The Independent Review]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; It received a disparaging critique by Rupert Read in the ''[[European Review]]''.&lt;ref name=Read2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Read|first1=Rupert|title=Economist-kings?

These reviews appear to have failed to note that Caplan's book celebrates the market and denigrates democracy at the very time when markets worldwide have failed and democracies have ridden to the rescue. It thus appears to have been undermined fatally by events that occurred as it was published (and which Caplan artfully omits to mention in the more recent paperback edition). Caplan's book in fact stands in the long tradition of anti-democratic writings that argue that an elite must rule. An elite of free-market economists. An elite no longer in good odour, since the financial crisis (and the climate crisis) occurred and became starkly evident to all. This Critical Notice also points out that numerous of Caplan's key claims, such as that individual voters have zero effect on election results, are empirically false.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids''===
In 2011 Caplan published a book, ''Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids'', arguing that people often work too hard in child-rearing, and as a result, they are scared of the idea of having children. Caplan's book urged parents to relax with respect to child-rearing. The book argues that as the perceived costs (in terms of child-rearing expense and effort) of having children fell, it made sense to have more children based on the basic theory of supply and demand.&lt;ref name="parenting.harder"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davis|first1=Tanika|title=Are parents making parenting harder than it has to be?|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/features/maryland-family/bs-lt-tanika-davis-family-1018-20151012-story.html|accessdate=29 September 2016|publisher=Baltimore Sun|date=15 Oct 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was reviewed in ''The Wall Street Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703806304576242661295724864|title = Go Ahead, Have Another|last = Last|first = Jonathan|date = 2011-04-16|accessdate = 2013-09-29|work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was also reviewed by ''[[The Guardian]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/may/15/parenting-less-fuss-more-fun|title = Parenting guru Bryan Caplan prescribes less fuss – and more fun|last = McVeigh|first = Tracy|work=The Guardian |date = 2011-05-15|accessdate = 2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[RealClearMarkets]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearmarkets.com/articles/2011/08/04/book_review_bryan_caplans_selfish_reasons_to_have_more_kids_99162.html|title = Book Review: Bryan Caplan's Selfish Reasons To Have More Kids|last = Tamny|first = John|publisher = ''[[RealClearMarkets]]''|date = 2011-08-04|accessdate = 2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Washington Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/may/4/go-and-multiply-without-guilt/|title = Go and Multiply, Without Guilt|last = Russell|first = Nicole|date = 2011-05-04|accessdate = 2013-09-29|work=Washington Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book also led to debates sponsored by ''The Wall Street Journal''&lt;ref name=carroll-wilkinson-wsj-debate&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/ideas-market/2011/04/14/live-chat-should-you-have-more-kids/|title = Live Chat: Should You Have More Kids?|date = 2011-04-14|accessdate = 2015-06-20|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Guardian''.&lt;ref name=caplan-chua-guardian-debate/&gt; ''The Guardian'' had Caplan debating "Tiger Mom" [[Amy Chua]] on the merits of strict [[parenting|parenting style]].&lt;ref name=caplan-chua-guardian-debate&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/jun/11/conversation-strict-parenting-amy-chua|title = Is strict parenting better for children?|last = Saner|first = Emine|date = 2011-06-11|accessdate = 2013-09-18|work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was also featured in a story on [[National Public Radio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Inskeep|first1=Steve|author2=David Greene|author3=Renee Montagne|title='Selfish Reasons' For Parents To Enjoy Having Kids|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/04/22/135612560/selfish-reasons-for-parents-to-enjoy-having-kids|accessdate=29 September 2016|work=[[Morning Edition]]|publisher=National Public Radio|date=22 Apr 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' described it as "Inconsistent and unpersuasive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/bryan-caplan/selfish-reasons-have-more-kids/ |journal=[[Kirkus Reviews]] |title=''Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids'' by Bryan Caplan |date=March 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Case Against Education''===
''The Case Against Education: Why the Education System Is a Waste of Time and Money'', published in 2018 by the [[Princeton University Press]]. Drawing on the economic concept of [[Signalling (economics)|job market signaling]] and research in [[educational psychology]], the book argues that much of higher education is very inefficient and has only a small effect in improving human capital, contrary to much of the conventional consensus in [[Labor economics]] that Caplan claims take the human capital theory for granted.

==Views==

===Open borders===
Caplan was cited as one of the leading proponents of the [[open border]]s position in articles in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' and ''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/04/if-people-could-immigrate-anywhere-would-poverty-be-eliminated/275332/|title = If People Could Immigrate Anywhere, Would Poverty Be Eliminated?|last = Raviv|first = Shaun|date = 2013-04-26|accessdate = 2013-09-27|publisher = ''[[The Atlantic]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2014/9/13/6135905/open-borders-bryan-caplan-interview-gdp-double/|title = The case for open borders|last = Matthews|first = Dylan|date = 2014-12-15|accessdate = 2018-04-14|publisher = ''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also been quoted in other mainstream press pieces on immigration in outlets such as the ''[[Huffington Post]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steve-roberson/immigrants-the-once-and-f_b_2836504.html|title = Immigrants – The Once, and Future, Story of Jobs|last = Roberson|first = Steve|publisher = ''[[Huffington Post]]''|date = 2013-03-08|accessdate = 2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://business.time.com/2013/01/30/the-economics-of-immigration-who-wins-who-loses-and-why/|title = The Economics of Immigration: Who Wins, Who Loses and Why|last = Matthews|first = Chris|date = 2013-01-30|accessdate = 2013-09-28|publisher = ''[[Time Magazine]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Winter 2012 issue of the peer-reviewed ''[[Cato Journal]]'', Caplan published a paper titled ''Why Should We Restrict Immigration?'', where he makes the moral and economic case for open borders while addressing various objections to his stance with practical solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/cato-journal/2012/1/cj32n1-2.pdf|title = Why Should We Restrict Immigration?|last = Caplan|first = Bryan|year = 2012|publisher = ''[[Cato Journal]]'', Vol. 32, Article No. 1 (Winter 2012)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anarcho-capitalism===
Caplan's [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalist]] views were discussed by [[Brian Doherty (journalist)|Brian Doherty]] in his book ''[[Radicals for Capitalism]]'' and in ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/blog/2013/04/03/anarcho-capitalism-so-crazy-it-just-migh|title = Anarcho-Capitalism: So Crazy, It Just Might Work!|last = Doherty|first = Brian|date = 2013-04-03|accessdate = 2013-09-28|publisher = ''Hit and Run ([[Reason Magazine|Reason]] blog)''}}&lt;/ref&gt; One frequent criticism of Caplan is an accusation that he has engaged in [[historical negationism]] by claiming that anarcho-capitalists have a better claim on the [[history of anarchism|history of anarchist thought]] than mainstream [[libertarian socialism|left-anarchists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spunk.org/texts/intro/faq/sp001547/append1.html|title = Replies to Some Errors and Distortions in Bryan Caplan's "Anarchist Theory FAQ" version 5.2|publisher = Spunk Library|accessdate = 2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.infoshop.org/faq/append1.pdf|title =Appendix : Anarchism and "anarcho"-capitalism|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20130702025618/http://www.infoshop.org/faq/append1.pdf|archivedate =July 2, 2013|df =mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Caplan has criticized one of the most notable examples of an anarchist-inspired society, revolutionary Catalonia during the Spanish Civil War, in an essay entitled "The Anarcho-Statists of Spain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Caplan|first1=Bryan|title=The Anarcho-Statists of Spain|url=http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/bcaplan/spain.htm|website=Econ Faculty|publisher=GMU|accessdate=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ayn Rand and Objectivism ===
After having long shed a youthful infatuation with the works of [[Russian American]] writer [[Ayn Rand]] and her philosophical system of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]], in 2004 Caplan wrote in his essay 'An Intellectual Biography', "I rejected Christianity because I determined that it was, to be blunt, idiotic. I rejected Objectivism and Austrianism, in contrast, as mixtures of deep truths and unfortunate mistakes. Let me begin with the deep truths. The Objectivists were right to insist that reality is objective, human reason able to grasp it, and [[skepticism|scepticism]] without merit. They correctly hold that humans have free will, morality is objective, and the pursuit of [[self-interest]] typically morally right."&lt;ref name="Walter"&gt;{{cite book|author=Block, Walter|title=I Chose Liberty: Autobiographies of Contemporary Libertarians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nONs9lus-zgC&amp;pg=PT85|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute|isbn=978-1-61016-270-8|page=85|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his essay, "''Atlas Shrugged'' and Public Choice: The Obvious Parallels", Caplan lauds Ayn Rand's ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'' as making "an important contribution to social science."&lt;ref name="Younkins2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Professor Edward W Younkins|title=Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged: A Philosophical and Literary Companion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p9MmnATOORwC&amp;pg=PA303|date=1 October 2012|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4094-8528-5|page=303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23751">'''Christian views on environmentalism''' vary among different [[Christian]]s and [[Christianity|Christian]] denominations.

Major Christian denominations endorse the Biblical calling of our stewardship of God's Creation and our responsibility for its care.  Some of this church policy is relatively recent and may not be followed by some parishioners.   According to some [[social science]] research, conservative Christians and members of the [[Christian right]] are typically less concerned about issues of [[environmentalism]] than the general public.&lt;ref&gt;Sherkat, D. E., and C. G. Ellison. 2007. Structuring the religion-environment connection: identifying religious influences on environmental concern and activism. ''[[Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion]]'' 46:71-85.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, M. N., and J. Liu. 2008. Impacts of religion on environmental worldviews: the Teton Valley case. ''Society and Natural Resources'' 21:704-718.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many Christians, however, are environmental activists and promote awareness and action at the church, community, and national levels.

Green Christianity is a broad field that encompasses Christian theological reflection on [[nature]], Christian [[liturgical]] and spiritual practices centered on [[environmental issues]], as well as Christian-based activism in the [[environmental movement]]. Within the activism arena, green Christianity refers to a diverse group of [[Christians]] who emphasize the [[biblical]] or [[theological]] basis for protecting and celebrating the environment. The term indicates not a particular [[Christian denomination|denomination]], but a shared territory of concern.

==Basic beliefs==
Christianity has a long historical tradition of reflection on nature and human responsibility. Christianity has a strong tendency toward [[anthropocentrism]], as emphasized in the early environmentalist critique of [[Lynn Townsend White, Jr.]]. While some Christians favor a more [[biocentrism (ethics)|biocentric]] approach, [[Catholic]] officials and others seek to retain an emphasis on humanity while incorporating environmental concerns within a framework of Creation Care. Christian environmentalists emphasize the ecological responsibilities of all Christians as stewards of God's earth.

Beginning with the [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] [[Genesis creation narrative|1:26-28]], God instructs humanity to manage the creation in particular ways.
{{quote|"And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth." {{bibleref2c-nb|Gen|1:28}} }}

[[Adam]]'s early purpose was to give care to the [[Garden of Eden]]:
{{quote|"And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it." (Genesis 2:15)}}

Green Christians point out that the biblical emphasis is on [[stewardship]], not [[ownership]]—that the earth remains the Lord's ([[Psalms]] 24:1) and does not belong to its human inhabitants. [[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]] 25:23 states:
{{quote|"The land must not be sold permanently, because the land is mine and you are but aliens and my tenants."&lt;ref&gt;[http://bible.cc/leviticus/25-23.htm Leviticus 25:23]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As a result of the doctrine of stewardship, Christian environmentalists oppose policies and practices that threaten the health or survival of the planet. Of particular concern to such Christians are the current widespread reliance on [[non-renewable resources]], [[habitat destruction]], [[pollution]], and all other factors that contribute to [[climate change]] or otherwise threaten the health of the [[ecosystem]]. Many Christian environmentalists have broken with conservative political leaders as a result of these positions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creationcare.org/resources/scripture.php Evangelical Environmental Network&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20021124084848/http://www.creationcare.org/resources/scripture.php |date=24 November 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anglican - Episcopal Church==
The Anglican Communion and the Episcopal Church have strong beliefs about the need for environmental awareness and actions.  Reducing carbon footprints and moving toward sustainable living are priorities.&lt;ref&gt; {{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orthodox Churches==

===Eastern Orthodox===
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
[[Patriarch Bartholomew I]] of [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Constantinople]], the "first among equals" in the [[Orthodox Church organization|Eastern Orthodox Communion]], has voiced support for aspects of the environmentalist movement, as has [[Pope John Paul II]] of [[Patriarchate of Rome|Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;''Moral Ground: Ethical Action for a Planet in Peril'' chapter author (editors: Kathleen Dean Moore and [[Michael P. Nelson]]) Bartholomew I author with [[Pope John Paul II]], [[Trinity University Press]] (2010) {{ISBN|9781595340665}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fr. [[John Chryssavgis]] serves as advisor to the Ecumenical Patriarch, currently [[Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople|Bartholomew I]], on environmental issues such as [[global warming]]. [[Eastern Orthodox Christian theology|Orthodox Christian theology]] is generally more [[mystical theology|mystical]] and [[panentheism|panentheistic]] than the traditions which developed in the [[Western Christianity|Christian West]], emphasizing the renewal and [[transfiguration (religion)|transfiguration]] of the whole creation through Christ's redemptive work. Many [[Eastern Christian monasticism|Eastern Christian monastics]] are known for having cultivated unusually close relationships with wild animals.

===Non-Chalcedonian, or Oriental Orthodox===

====Armenian Apostolic Church====

In the nineteenth century, [[Catholicos of All Armenians|Catholicos]] [[Nerses V]] of All Armenians planted a forest stretching 100 hectares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arcworld.org/news.asp?pageID=387|author=ARC: The Alliance of Religions and Conservation|date=16 April 2009|title=Armenian Orthodox start to replant their sacred forest - with a celebration|accessdate=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of it was destroyed during the [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Communist era]] but replanting efforts have begun in the twenty-first century.

The late [[Catholicos of All Armenians|Catholicos]] [[Karekin I]] stated that the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] is committed to the defence of creation because harming the gift of God is a sin when man has a duty to care for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Guaïta |first=Giovanni |date=2000 |title=Between Heaven and Earth: A conversation with His Holiness Karekin I |location=New York, NY, USA |publisher=St. Vartan Press |page=206 |isbn=9780934728393 |others=Translated by Diocese of the Armenian Church of America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[Catholicos of All Armenians|Catholicos]] [[Karekin II]], the Armenian Church produced a seven year ecological action plan &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arcworld.org/downloads/Christian-Armenian-Orthodox-7YP.pdf|title=Plan of the Armenian Apostolic Church for Generational Change|author=ARC: The Alliance of Religions and Conservation|date=2009|accessdate=15 March 2012|page=8)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ethiopian Orthodox 'Tewahedo' Church====

Traditionally, [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Orthodox]] [[monastery|monasteries]] and some churches have preserved small sacred forests around their buildings in memory of the [[Garden of Eden]]. This has allowed many endangered species to survive in areas where their habitat has otherwise been lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Votrin |first=Valery |date=2005 |title=The Orthodoxy and Sustainable Development: A Potential for Broader Involvement of the Orthodox Churches in Ethiopia and Russia |journal=Environment, Development and Sustainability |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=9-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evangelical churches==
{{Main|Evangelical environmentalism}}
As the scientific community has presented evidence of climate change, some members of the [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] community and other Christian groups have emphasized the need for Christian [[ecology]], often employing the phrase "creation care" to indicate the religious basis of their project. Some of these groups are now interdenominational, having begun from an evangelical background and then gained international and interdenominational prominence with the increase in public awareness of environmental issues. Organizations with an evangelical genesis{{Clarify|date=June 2011}} include [[A Rocha]], the [[Evangelical Climate Initiative]] and the Evangelical Environmental Network.

Some prominent members of the so-called [[Christian right]] have broken with the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] and other [[Conservativism in the United States|conservative]] politicians over the [[Climate change policy of the United States|issue of climate change]]. ''[[Christianity Today]]'' endorsed the [[McCain-Lieberman Bill]], which was eventually defeated by the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States Congress|Congress]] and opposed by [[George W. Bush|Bush]]. According to the magazine, "Christians should make it clear to governments and businesses that we are willing to adapt our lifestyles and support steps towards changes that protect our environment."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2004/october/10.26.html?start=1 "Heat Stroke" (''Christianity Today'', October 2004)]&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing Christian support for strong positions on climate change and related issues has been referred to as "The Greening of Evangelicals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A1491-2005Feb5.html | work=The [[Washington Post]] | first=Blaine | last=Harden | title=The Greening of Evangelicals | date=6 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Christians have expressed dissatisfaction with a leadership they feel places the interests of big businesses over [[Christian doctrine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christian-ecology.org.uk/p0501.htm January 2005 Prayer Guide - Christianity and the Environment - Christian Ecology Link&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many [[Christian right|conservative evangelical Christians]] have embraced [[climate change denialism]] or maintain a neutral stance due to the lack of internal consensus on such issues. The [[Cornwall Alliance]] is an organization which takes an opposing view on the issue to the Evangelical Climate Initiative. The [[National Association of Evangelicals]] has stated that "global warming is not a consensus issue", and is [[Global warming controversy|internally divided]] on the Christian response to climate change.

==Lutheran==
Major Lutheran Synods acknowledge that the Bible calls us to care for God's creation.  The dominion that God gave His human creatures has  often been abused, carried out to the detriment of creation:  [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]], [[resource depletion]], [[environmental damage]], etc.   We are called to live according to God’s wisdom in Creation with his other creatures. Sustainable living is needed.&lt;ref&gt; {{Citation

==Roman Catholic Church==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
Catholic environmental activists have found support in teachings by [[Pope Paul VI]] (''[[Octogesima adveniens]]'', #21) and [[Pope John Paul II]] (e.g., the [[encyclical]] ''[[Centesimus annus]]'', #37-38).

Pope Francis has published an encyclical, named "[[Laudato si']] (Be Praised), On the Care of Our Common Home", which aims to inspire everyone - not just Roman Catholics - to protect the Earth.
He endorses climate action and has made cases on Christian environmentalism on several occasions. 
"Take good care of creation. St. Francis wanted that. People occasionally forgive, but nature never does. If we don’t take care of the environment, there’s no way of getting around it."&lt;ref&gt;Pope Francis meets with President of Ecuador

==Seventh-day Adventists==
{{Expand section|date=June 2012}}
The [[Seventh-day Adventist church]] is committed to environmental stewardship &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adventist.org/beliefs/statements/main_stat9.html A Statement on the Environment], 1995 and [http://www.adventist.org/beliefs/statements/main_stat10.html Statement on Stewardship of the Environment], 1996.

Goodwin (ed.), [book title not yet specified]. [[Andrews University Press]], [[Berrien Springs, Michigan]].&lt;/ref&gt; as well as taking action to [[Avoiding dangerous climate change|avoid the dangers]] of [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adventist.org/beliefs/statements/main_stat8.html The Dangers of Climate Change: A Statement to Governments of Industrialized Countries], 1995 (Official statement)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to its official statement, the church "advocates a simple, wholesome lifestyle, where people do not step on the treadmill of unbridled [[over-consumption]], accumulation of goods, and production of waste. A reformation of lifestyle is called for, based on respect for nature, restraint in the use of the world's resources, reevaluation of one's needs, and reaffirmation of the dignity of created life."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adventist.org/beliefs/statements/main-stat10.html Statement on Stewardship of the Environment], 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Loma Linda University]], one of the church's largest universities, introduced the [[Loma Linda University Center for Biodiversity and Conservation Studies]]. The goal of the center is to address the comparative lack of environmental concern among Christians by increasing awareness of environmental issues. The center features animal displays representing global [[biodiversity hotspots]] of special concern and also introduces visitors to original scientific research being conducted in the school's biology, geology and natural sciences departments.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Her mother told a story of "knowing" her daughter would be holy because a dove had flown into her sleeve and lived there for seven days while she was pregnant.&lt;ref name="The Life of Christina of Markyate" /&gt;

As a child, Theodora is said to have talked to Christ "as if he were a man whom she could see."&lt;ref name="The Life of Christina of Markyate" /&gt; She befriended an older man named Sueno, who became her first religious mentor. It is mentioned in her hagiography that Sueno had once led an unholy life and that Christina's faith renewed his, so that they helped each other. Theodora visited [[St Albans Cathedral|St Alban's Abbey in Hertfordshire]] with her parents as a teenager, and the visit apparently instilled in her a deep faith that prompted her to make a private vow of chastity.&lt;ref name=Urquhart&gt;[https://fsuspecialcollections.wordpress.com/2012/03/26/a-book-for-christina-of-markyate/ Urquhart, Toni. "A book for Christina of Markyate" Florida State University Special Collections &amp; Archives division]&lt;/ref&gt; Of this she told Sueno, but no one else.

==Marriage==
While visiting an aunt, Elfgifu, Theodora met Bishop [[Ranulf Flambard]]. Her aunt was the bishop's concubine and Ranulf lusted after young Theodora, seeking to make her another one of his concubines. According to one account, when Ranulf attempted to force his attentions on her, Theodora suggested that she lock the door to guarantee their privacy. When he agreed, she proceeded to do so, from the outside, trapping him within.&lt;ref name=Speigel&gt;[http://decodedpast.com/christina-markyate-medieval-woman-refused-marriage-options/13357 Speigel, Frances. "Christina of Markyate: A Medieval Woman Who Refused Marriage", Decoded Past, September 15. 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; Rebuffed, he then exacted revenge by brokering a marriage for her with a young nobleman named Beorhtred.&lt;ref name="The Life of Christina of Markyate" /&gt;

Theodora's parents readily agreed, but Theodora did not, in view of her vow. Her angry parents arranged for Beorhtred to have access to her room, only to discover next morning that the two had spent the night discussing religious subjects. On one occasion Theodora recounted the life of St [[Cecilia]], who according to legend, was guarded on her wedding night by a vengeful angel. On another occasion, she hid behind a tapestry while Beorhtred searched for her in vain. As word went round of Theodora's plight, a hermit name Eadwine, with the blessing of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], helped her escape, disguised in men's clothes. Eadwine then took her to stay with an anchoress at [[Flamstead]] named Alfwen, who hid her from her family.&lt;ref name=Ely/&gt; Here Theodora changed her name to Christina.

==Anchoress==
Christina next found shelter with Roger, a hermit and sub-deacon of St Alban's Abbey, whose cell was at [[Markyate]].&lt;ref name=Speigel/&gt; The hermit Roger (died before 1118), whose death anniversary (12 September) is recorded in the [[St. Albans Psalter]] , is likely to have been identical with Roger d'Aubigny, a brother of abbot [[Richard d'Aubigny ]](1087–1119) and father of [[William d'Aubigny (died 1139)|William d'Aubigny (Pincerna)]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard Gallistl, ''"A book for Avicia?" Der Eremit Roger im Psalter von St. Albans'', Concilium medii aevi, 21, 2018, pp. 1–52,[http://cma.gbv.de/dr,cma,021,2018,a,01.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; She spent her time in prayer, sewing to support herself. She was a skilled needlewoman, who later embroidered three [[mitre]]s of superb workmanship for [[Pope Adrian IV]].&lt;ref name=Aberdeen&gt;[http://www.abdn.ac.uk/stalbanspsalter/english/essays/personalities.shtml "The Personalities", St Alban's Psalter, University of Aberdeen]&lt;/ref&gt; After two years, Beorhtard released Christina from the marriage contract, and Archbishop Thurstan of York formally annulled the marriage in 1122.&lt;ref name=Speigel/&gt; Thereafter Christina was able to come out of hiding and move into a small hut.&lt;ref name=Ely/&gt;

==Prioress==
Upon the death of Roger, Christina took over the hermitage near St Alban's Abbey, where she reportedly experienced frequent visions of Jesus, Mary, and [[Margaret the Virgin|St Margaret]]. Other women, including her sister Margaret, joined her there. Christina took her vows at St Albans in 1131. Markyate Priory was established in 1145.&lt;ref name=Aberdeen/&gt;

[[Geoffrey de Gorham]] became abbot of St Albans in 1119, and as prioress, Christina became his close friend and counsellor. Their friendship was such that he is said to have altered the St. Albans Psalter as a gift for her, by having an illuminated "C" placed at the beginning of Psalm 105.&lt;ref name=Urquhart/&gt;

==Hagiography==
Her Latin ''Vita'' was apparently written by a monk of St Alban's Abbey. This [[hagiography]] is considered to be one of the most realistic known.&lt;ref name=Sourcebook&gt;{{cite book |last1=Amt |first1=Emilie |title=Women's Lives in Medieval Europe |date=2010 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=9780415466837 |page=71 |edition=2nd |ref=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some parts still follow the typical route of hagiographies – a vow of chastity, overcoming all obstacles including marriage, and even being an anchoress – but others pull away from the norm. Christina is shown as having power as prioress of St Albans. She is also one of very few shown to have sexual desire, even though she overcomes it.

Her hagiography is incomplete. Parts were lost in a fire in the 18th century and it is unknown whether the biographer wrote the account before or after her death.&lt;ref name="The Life of Christina of Markyate" /&gt;

In the light of the priory's legal foundation by St Paul's, the friendship between Christina and Geoffrey seems likely to go back to a fiction by Abbot [[Robert de Gorron]] (1151–1166)&lt;ref&gt;Katie Bugyis: The Author of the Life of Christina of Markyate: The Case for Robert de Gorron (died 1166), in: ''The Journal of Ecclesiastical History'' 68 (2017), pp. 719–746 [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317022368_The_Author_of_the_Life_of_Christina_of_Markyate_The_Case_for_Robert_de_Gorron_d_1166]&lt;/ref&gt; or by the chronicler [[Matthew Paris]] (c. 1200–1259), who alleged in his chronicle that St Alban's Abbey had clerical competence over the nuns of Markyate. "It would almost seem that in the ''Gesta Abbatum'' the origins of Markyate and [[Sopwell Priory|Sopwell]] have been confused. There Markyate Priory is said to have arisen through the occupation of the hermitage of Roger, a former monk of St. Albans, by a saintly recluse called Christina, for whom abbot Geoffrey built a house. But in reality Markyate was not dependent on St. Albans, as it would have been if founded by the abbot, and as Sopwell was."&lt;ref&gt;William Page, ''The Victoria History of the County of Hertford '', 4, London 1914, p. 422.&lt;/ref&gt; "It is therefore altogether very possible that what we are dealing with here is a later piece of fiction from a monastic chronicler."&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard Gallistl, ''"The Christina of Markyate Psalter" A Modern Legend: On the Purpose of the St. Albans Psalter'', Concilium medii aevi, 17, 2014, p. 45,[http://cma.gbv.de/dr,cma,017,2014,a,03.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; A medieval cult of the anchoress Christina is not substantiated by [[Liturgy|liturgical]] or historical sources.&lt;ref&gt;Rachel M. Koopmans, ''The Conclusion of Christina of Markyate's Vita'', ''Journal of Ecclesiastical History'', 51,4, 2000, pp. 663–698/&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of the ''Vita'' and references to Christina in the ''Gesta Abbatum Monasterii Sancti Albani'' still suggest some interest in instigating such a cult in the 13th and 14th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Gerry, ''Cult and Codex: Alexis, Christina and the Saint Albans Psalter''. ''Der Albani-Psalter: Gottesfurcht &amp; Leidenschaft/The St. Albans Psalter: Piety &amp; Passion'', pp. 61–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Computing Machinery and Intelligence'''" is a seminal paper written by [[Alan Turing]] on the topic of [[artificial intelligence]]. The paper, published in 1950 in ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'', was the first to introduce his concept of what is now known as the [[Turing test]] to the general public.

Turing's paper considers the question "Can machines think?" Since the words "think" and "machine" cannot be defined in a clear way that satisfies everyone, Turing suggests we "replace the question by another, which is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1950|p=433}}&lt;/ref&gt; To do this, he must first find a simple and unambiguous idea to replace the word "think", second he must explain exactly which "machines" he is considering, and finally, armed with these tools, he formulates a new question, related to the first, that he believes he can answer in the affirmative.

==Turing's test==
[[File:Turing Test version 3.png|thumb|The "standard interpretation" of the Turing Test, in which the interrogator is tasked with trying to determine which player is a computer and which is a human]]
{{Main|Turing test}}

Rather than trying to determine if a machine is thinking, Turing suggests we should ask if the machine can win a game, called the "[[Turing test#Imitation Game|Imitation Game]]". The original Imitation game that Turing described is a simple party game involving three players. Player A is a man, player B is a woman and player C (who plays the role of the interrogator) can be of either sex. In the Imitation Game, player C is unable to see either player A or player B (and knows them only as X and Y), and can communicate with them only through written notes or any other form that does not give away any details about their gender. By asking questions of player A and player B, player C tries to determine which of the two is the man and which is the woman. Player A's role is to trick the interrogator into making the wrong decision, while player B attempts to assist the interrogator in making the right one.
  
Turing proposes a variation of this game that involves the computer: {{' "}}What will happen when a machine takes the part of A in this game?" Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace our original, 'Can machines think?{{" '}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1950|p=434}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
So the modified game becomes one that involves three participants in isolated rooms: a computer (which is being tested), a human, and a (human) judge. The human judge can converse with both the human and the computer by typing into a terminal. Both the computer and human try to convince the judge that they are the human. If the judge cannot consistently tell which is which, then the computer wins the game.&lt;ref&gt;This describes the simplest version of the test. For a more detailed discussion, see [[Turing test#Versions|Versions of the Turing test]].&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Stevan Harnad]] notes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |chapterurl=http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/12954/ |first=Stevan |last=Harnad |year=2008 |chapter=The Annotation Game: On Turing (1950) on Computing, Machinery, and Intelligence |editor1-last=Epstein |editor1-first=Robert |editor2-last=Peters |editor2-first=Grace |title=The Turing Test Sourcebook: Philosophical and Methodological Issues in the Quest for the Thinking Computer |location= |publisher=Kluwer |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the question has become "Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?" In other words, Turing is no longer asking whether a machine can "think"; he is asking whether a machine can ''act'' indistinguishably&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://cogprints.org/2615/ |first=Stevan |last=Harnad |year=2001 |title=Minds, Machines, and Turing: The Indistinguishability of Indistinguishables |journal=Journal of Logic, Language, and Information |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=425–445 |postscript=. }}&lt;/ref&gt; from the way a thinker acts. This question avoids the difficult philosophical problem of pre-defining the verb "to think" and focuses instead on the performance capacities that being able to think makes possible, and how a causal system can generate them.

Some have taken Turing's question to have been "Can a computer, communicating over a teleprinter, fool a person into believing it is human?"&lt;ref name=NMR&gt;Wardrip-Fruin, Noah and Nick Montfort, ed (2003). The New Media Reader. The MIT Press. {{ISBN|0-262-23227-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but it seems clear that Turing was not talking about fooling people but about generating human cognitive capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://cogprints.org/1584/ |first=Stevan |last=Harnad |title=The Turing Test Is Not A Trick: Turing Indistinguishability Is A Scientific Criterion |journal=SIGART Bulletin |volume=3 |issue=4 |year=1992 |pages=9–10 |postscript=. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital machines==
{{See also|Turing machine|Church–Turing thesis}}

Turing also notes that we need to determine which "machines" we wish to consider. He points out that a human [[cloning|clone]], while man-made, would not provide a very interesting example. Turing suggested that we should focus on the capabilities of digital machinery—machines which manipulate the binary digits of 1 and 0, rewriting them into memory using simple rules. He gave two reasons.

First, there is no reason to speculate whether or not they can exist. They already did in 1950.

Second, digital machinery is "universal". Turing's research into the [[theory of computation|foundations of computation]] had proved that a digital computer can, in theory, simulate the behaviour of any other digital machine, given enough memory and time. (This is the essential insight of the [[Church–Turing thesis]] and the [[universal Turing machine]].) Therefore, if ''any'' digital machine can "act like it is thinking" then, ''every'' sufficiently powerful digital machine can. Turing writes, "all digital computers are in a sense equivalent."&lt;ref name=P442&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1950|p=442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This allows the original question to be made even more specific. Turing now restates the original question as "Let us fix our attention on one particular digital computer C. Is it true that by modifying this computer to have an adequate storage, suitably increasing its speed of action, and providing it with an appropriate programme, C can be made to play satisfactorily the part of A in the imitation game, the part of B being taken by a man?"&lt;ref name=P442/&gt;

Hence Turing states that the focus is not on "whether all digital computers would do well in the game nor whether the computers that are presently available would do well, but whether there are imaginable computers which would do well".&lt;ref name=P436&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1950|p=436}}&lt;/ref&gt; What is more important is to consider the advancements possible in the state of our machines today regardless of whether we have the available resource to create one or not.

==Nine common objections==
{{See also|Philosophy of artificial intelligence}}

Having clarified the question, Turing turned to answering it: he considered the following nine common objections, which include all the major arguments against artificial intelligence raised in the years since his paper was first published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1950}} and see {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=948}} where comment "Turing examined a wide variety of possible objections to the possibility of intelligent machines, including virtually all of those that have been raised in the half century since his paper appeared."&lt;/ref&gt;

#''[[Religious]] Objection'': This states that thinking is a function of man's [[Immortality|immortal]] [[soul]]; therefore, a machine cannot think.  "In attempting to construct such machines," wrote Turing, "we should not be irreverently usurping His power of creating souls, any more than we are in the procreation of children: rather we are, in either case, instruments of His will providing mansions for the souls that He creates."
#'' 'Heads in the Sand' Objection'': "The consequences of machines thinking would be too dreadful.  Let us hope and believe that they cannot do so."  This thinking is popular among intellectual people, as they believe superiority derives from higher intelligence and the possibility of being overtaken is a threat (as machines have efficient memory capacities and processing speed, machines exceeding the learning and knowledge capabilities are highly probable). This objection is a fallacious [[appeal to consequences]], confusing what should not be with what can or cannot be (Wardrip-Fruin, 56).
#''[[Mathematics|Mathematical]] Objections'': This objection uses mathematical theorems, such as [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]], to show that there are limits to what questions a computer system based on [[logic]] can answer.  Turing suggests that humans are too often wrong themselves and pleased at the fallibility of a machine.  (This argument would be made again by philosopher [[John Lucas (philosopher)|John Lucas]] in 1961 and [[physicist]] [[Roger Penrose]] in 1989.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lucas|1961}}, {{Harvnb|Penrose|1989}}, {{Harvnb|Hofstadter|1979|pp=471–473,476–477}} and {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=949–950}}. Russell and Norvig identify Lucas and Penrose's arguments as being the same one answered by Turing.&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Argument From [[Consciousness]]'': This argument, suggested by Professor [[Geoffrey Jefferson]] in his 1949 Lister Oration states that "not until a machine can write a sonnet or compose a concerto because of thoughts and emotions felt, and not by the chance fall of symbols, could we agree that machine equals brain."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turingarchive.org/browse.php/B/44 "The Mind of Mechanical Man"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Turing replies by saying that we have no way of knowing that any individual other than ourselves experiences emotions, and that therefore we should accept the test.  He adds, "I do not wish to give the impression that I think there is no mystery about consciousness ... [b]ut I do not think these mysteries necessarily need to be solved before we can answer the question [of whether machines can think]." (This argument, that a computer can't have ''conscious experiences'' or ''understanding'' would be made in 1980 by philosopher [[John Searle]] in his [[Chinese room]] argument. Turing's reply is now known as the "[[problem of other minds|other minds]] reply". See also [[Philosophy of artificial intelligence#Can a machine have a mind, consciousness and mental states?|Can a machine have a mind?]] in the [[philosophy of AI]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1980}} and {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=958–960}}, who identify Searle's argument with the one Turing answers.&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Arguments from various disabilities''. These arguments all have the form "a computer will never do ''X''". Turing offers a selection:&lt;blockquote&gt;Be kind, resourceful, beautiful, friendly, have initiative, have a sense of humour, tell right from wrong, make mistakes, fall in love, enjoy strawberries and cream, make someone fall in love with it, learn from experience, use words properly, be the subject of its own thought, have as much diversity of behaviour as a man, do something really new.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Turing notes that "no support is usually offered for these statements," and that they depend on naive assumptions about how versatile machines may be in the future, or are "disguised forms of the argument from consciousness." He chooses to answer a few of them:
##''Machines cannot make mistakes.'' He notes it's easy to program a machine to appear to make a mistake.
##''A machine cannot be the subject of its own thought'' (or can't be [[self-aware]]). A program which can report on its internal states and processes, in the simple sense of a [[debugger]] program, can certainly be written. Turing asserts "a machine can undoubtably be its own subject matter."
##''A machine cannot have much diversity of behaviour''. He notes that, with enough storage capacity, a computer can behave in an astronomical number of different ways.
#''[[Ada Lovelace|Lady Lovelace]]'s Objection'': One of the most famous objections states that computers are incapable of originality. This is largely because, according to [[Ada Lovelace]], machines are incapable of independent learning.&lt;blockquote&gt;The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform. It can follow analysis; but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths.&lt;/blockquote&gt; Turing suggests that Lovelace's objection can be reduced to the assertion that computers "can never take us by surprise" and argues that, to the contrary, computers could still surprise humans, in particular where the consequences of different facts are not immediately recognizable. Turing also argues that Lady Lovelace was hampered by the context from which she wrote, and if exposed to more contemporary scientific knowledge, it would become evident that the brain's storage is quite similar to that of a computer.
#''Argument from continuity in the nervous system'': Modern [[neurological]] research has shown that the brain is not digital. Even though [[neuron]]s fire in an all-or-nothing pulse, both the exact timing of the pulse and the probability of the pulse occurring have analog components. Turing acknowledges this, but argues that any analog system can be simulated to a reasonable degree of accuracy given enough computing power. ([[Philosopher]] [[Hubert Dreyfus]] would make this argument against "the biological assumption" in 1972.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dreyfus|1979|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Argument from the informality of behaviour'': This argument states that any system governed by laws will be predictable and therefore not truly intelligent. Turing replies by stating that this is confusing laws of behaviour with general rules of conduct, and that if on a broad enough scale (such as is evident in man) machine behaviour would become increasingly difficult to predict. He argues that, just because we can't immediately see what the laws are, does not mean that no such laws exist. He writes "we certainly know of no circumstances under which we could say, 'we have searched enough. There are no such laws.'". ([[Hubert Dreyfus]] would argue in 1972 that human reason and problem solving was not based on formal rules, but instead relied on instincts and awareness that would never be captured in rules. More recent AI research in [[robotics]] and [[computational intelligence]] attempts to find the complex rules that govern our "informal" and unconscious skills of perception, mobility and pattern matching. See [[Dreyfus' critique of AI]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dreyfus|1972}}, {{Harvnb|Dreyfus|Dreyfus|1986}}, {{Harvnb|Moravec|1988}} and {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=51–52}}, who identify Dreyfus' argument with the one Turing answers.&lt;/ref&gt;. This rejoinder also includes the [[Turing's Wager]] argument.
#''[[Extra-sensory perception]]'': In 1950, extra-sensory perception was an active area of research and Turing chooses to give ESP the benefit of the doubt, arguing that conditions could be created in which [[Telepathy|mind-reading]] would not affect the test.

==Learning machines==
{{see also|Machine learning}}
In the final section of the paper Turing details his thoughts about the Learning Machine that could play the imitation game successfully.

Here Turing first returns to Lady Lovelace's objection that the machine can only do what we tell it to do and he likens it to a situation where a man "injects" an idea into the machine to which the machine responds and then falls off into quiescence. He extends on this thought by an analogy to an atomic pile of less than critical size which is to be considered the machine and an injected idea is to correspond to a [[neutron]] entering the pile from outside the pile; the neutron will cause a certain disturbance which eventually dies away. Turing then builds on that analogy and mentions that if the [[Critical mass|size]] of the pile were to be sufficiently large then a neutron entering the pile would cause a disturbance that would continue to increase until the whole pile were destroyed, the pile would be supercritical. Turing then asks the question as to whether this analogy of a super critical pile could be extended to a human mind and then to a machine. He concludes that such an analogy would indeed be suitable for the human mind with "There does seem to be one for the human mind. The majority of them seem to be "subcritical," i.e., to correspond in this analogy to piles of sub critical size. An idea presented to such a mind will on average give rise to less than one idea in reply. A smallish proportion are supercritical. An idea presented to such a mind that may give rise to a whole "theory" consisting of secondary, tertiary and more remote ideas". He finally asks if a machine could be made to be supercritical.

Turing then mentions that the task of being able to create a machine that could play the imitation game is one of programming and he postulates that by the end of the century it will indeed be technologically possible to program a machine to play the game. He then mentions that in the process of trying to imitate an adult human mind it becomes important to consider the processes that lead to the adult mind being in its present state; which he summarizes as:
::1. The initial state of the mind, say at birth,
::2. The education to which it has been subjected,
::3. Other experience, not to be described as education, to which it has been subjected.
Given this process he asks whether it would be more appropriate to program a child's mind instead of an adults mind and then subject the child mind to a period of education. He likens the child to a newly bought notebook and speculates that due to its simplicity it would be more easily programmed. The problem then is broken down into two parts, the programming of a child mind and its education process. He mentions that a child mind would not be expected as desired by the experimenter (programmer) at the first attempt. A learning process that involves a method of reward and punishment must be in place that will select desirable patterns in the mind. This whole process, Turing mentions, to a large extent is similar to that of evolution by natural selection where the similarities are:
::Structure of the child machine = hereditary material
::Changes of the child machine = mutations
::Natural selection = judgment of the experimenter
Following this discussion Turing addresses certain specific aspects of the learning machine: 
:* Nature of inherent complexity: The child machine could either be one that is as simple as possible, merely maintaining consistency with general principles, or the machine could be one with a complete system of logical inference programmed into it. This more complex system is explained by Turing as "..would be such that the machines store would be largely occupied with definitions and [[proposition]]s. The propositions would have various kinds of status, e.g., well-established facts, conjectures, mathematically proved theorems, statements given by an authority, expressions having the logical form of proposition but not belief-value. Certain propositions may be described as "imperatives." The machine should be so constructed that as soon as an imperative is classed as "well established" the appropriate action automatically takes place.". Despite this built-in logic system the logical inference programmed in would not be one that is formal, rather it would be one that is more pragmatic. In addition the machine would build on its built-in logic system by a method of "scientific induction".

:* Ignorance of the experimenter: An important feature of a learning machine that Turing points out is the ignorance of the teacher of the machines' internal state during the learning process. This is in contrast to a conventional discrete state machine where the objective is to have a clear understanding of the internal state of the machine at every moment during the computation. The machine will be seen to be doing things that we often cannot make sense of or something that we consider to be completely random. Turing mentions that this specific character bestows upon a machine a certain degree of what we consider to be intelligence, in that intelligent behaviour consists of a deviation from the complete determinism of conventional computation but only so long as the deviation does not give rise to pointless loops or random behaviour.

:* The importance of random behaviour: Though Turing cautions us of random behaviour he mentions that inculcating an element of randomness in a learning machine would be of value in a system. He mentions that this could be of value where there might be multiple correct answers or ones where it might be such that a systematic approach would investigate several unsatisfactory solutions to a problem before finding the optimal solution which would entail the systematic process inefficient. Turing also mentions that the process of evolution takes the path of random mutations in order to find solutions that benefit a organism but he also admits that in the case of evolution the systematic method of finding a solution would not be possible.

Turing concludes by speculating about a time when machines will compete with humans on numerous intellectual tasks and suggests tasks that could be used to make that start. Turing then suggests that abstract tasks such as playing chess could be a good place to start another method which he puts as "..it is best to provide the machine with the best sense organs that money can buy, and then teach it to understand and speak English.".

An examination of the development in [[artificial intelligence]] that has followed reveals that the learning machine did take the abstract path suggested by Turing as in the case of [[Deep Blue (chess computer)|Deep Blue]], a chess playing computer developed by [[IBM]] and one which defeated the world champion [[Garry Kasparov]] (though, this too is controversial) and the numerous computer chess games which can outplay most amateurs.&lt;ref name="ParsingTT2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Epstein|first1=Robert|last2=Roberts|first2=Gary|last3=Beber|first3=Grace|title=Parsing the Turing Test:Philosophical and Methodological Issues in the Quest for the Thinking Computer|date=2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-6710-5|page=65|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aggUJL_5_oQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for the second suggestion Turing makes, it has been likened by some authors as a call to finding a [[simulacrum]] of human cognitive development.&lt;ref name="ParsingTT2008"/&gt; And such attempts at finding the underlying algorithms by which children learn of the features of the world around them are only beginning to be made.&lt;ref name="ParsingTT2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gopnik|first1=Alison|last2=Meltzoff.|first2=Andrew N.|title=Words, thoughts, and theories.|date=1997|publisher=MIT Press|url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/words-thoughts-and-theories}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meltzoff|first1=Andrew N.|title=Origins of theory of mind, cognition and communication.|journal=Journal of communication disorders|date=1999|volume=32.4|pages=251–269|url=http://ilabs.washington.edu/meltzoff/pdf/99Meltzoff_JCommDisord.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29952">'''Constructivist teaching'''  is based on [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivist learning theory]]. Constructivist teaching is based on the belief that learning occurs as learners are actively involved in a process of meaning and [[knowledge construction]] as opposed to [[passive learning|passively receiving information]].  Learners are the makers of meaning and knowledge.

==History==
Constructivist approach teaching methods are based on [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivist]] [[learning theory (education)|learning theory]]. Along with [[John Dewey]], [[Jean Piaget]] researched [[childhood development]] and education. Both Dewey and Piaget were very influential in the development of informal education. Dewey's idea of influential education suggests that education must engage with and enlarge experience and the exploration of thinking and reflection associated with the role of educators.  Piaget's role in the constructivist teaching suggests that we learn by expanding our knowledge by experiences which are generated through play from infancy to adulthood which are necessary for learning. Their theories are now encompassed in the broader movement of [[progressive education]]. Constructivist learning theory says that all knowledge is constructed from a base of prior knowledge. Children are not a blank slate and knowledge cannot be imparted without the child making sense of it according to his or her current conceptions. Therefore, children learn best when they are allowed to construct a personal understanding based on experiencing things and reflecting on those experiences.&lt;ref name="thirteenorg"&gt;[http://www.thirteen.org/edonline/concept2class/constructivism/index_sub5.html Constructivism as a Paradigm for Teaching and Learning]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constructivist teaching strategies==

===Characteristics===
One of the primary goals of using constructivist teaching is that students learn how to learn by giving them the training to take initiative for their own learning experiences.

According to Audrey Gray{{who|date=May 2012}}, the characteristics of a constructivist classroom are as follows:
*the learners are actively involved
*the environment is democratic
*the activities are interactive and student-centered
*the teacher facilitates a process of learning in which students are encouraged to be responsible and autonomous

===Examples of activities===
Furthermore, in the constructivist classroom, students work primarily in groups and learning and knowledge are interactive and dynamic.  There is a great focus and emphasis on social and communication skills, as well as collaboration and exchange of ideas.&lt;ref name="thirteenorg"/&gt;  This is contrary to the traditional classroom in which students work primarily alone, learning is achieved through repetition, and the subjects are strictly adhered to and are guided by a textbook.  Some activities encouraged in constructivist classrooms are:
* '''Experimentation:''' Students individually perform an experiment and then come together as a class to discuss the results.
* '''Research projects:''' Students research a topic and can present their findings to the class.
* '''Field trips:'''  This allows students to put the concepts and ideas discussed in class in a real-world context.  Field trips would often be followed by class discussions.
* '''Films:'''  These provide visual context and thus bring another sense into the learning experience.
* '''Class discussions:'''  This technique is used in all of the methods described above.  It is one of the most important distinctions of constructivist teaching methods.&lt;ref name="templeedu"&gt;[http://www.temple.edu/CETP/temple_teach/CM-struc.html Strategies for Constructivist Teaching]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050920023123/http://www.temple.edu/CETP/temple_teach/CM-struc.html |date=September 20, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Campus wikis:'''  These provide learners with a platform for curating helpful learning resources. &lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Taking Constructivism One Step Further: Post Hoc Analysis of a Student-Created Wiki.|author=Pascoe, Michael|PMID=29903697|pages=1-11|url=http://mededu.jmir.org/2018/1/e16/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Constructivist approaches can also be used in online learning. For example, tools such as discussion forums, wikis and blogs can enable learners to actively construct knowledge. 
A contrast between the traditional classroom and the constructivist classroom is illustrated below:

The Traditional Classroom 
*Begins with parts of the whole–Emphasizes basic skills
*Strict adherence to fixed curriculum
*Textbooks and workbooks
*Instructor gives/students receive
*Instructor assumes directive, authoritative role
*Assessment via testing / correct answers
*Knowledge is inert
*Students work individually

The constructivist Classroom
*Begin with the whole – expanding to parts
*Pursuit of student questions / interests
*Primary Sources / manipulative materials
*Learning is interaction – building on what students already know
*Instructor interacts / negotiates with students
*Assessment via student works, observations, points of view, tests. Process is as important as product
*Knowledge is dynamic / change with experiences
*Students work in groups Source : Thirteen Ed Online (2004)

Because existing knowledge schemata are explicitly acknowledged as a starting point for new learning, constructivist approaches tend to validate individual and cultural differences and diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pagán|first=Brian|date=2006-02-28|title=Positive Contributions of Constructivism to Educational Design|url=http://ejop.psychopen.eu/article/view/318|journal=Europe's Journal of Psychology|volume=2|issue=1|doi=10.5964/ejop.v2i1.318|issn=1841-0413}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of teachers===
In the constructivist classroom, the teacher's role is to prompt and facilitate discussion.  Thus, the teacher's main focus should be on guiding students by asking questions that will lead them to develop their own conclusions on the subject. Parker J. Palmer (1997) suggests that good teachers join self, subject, and students in the fabric of life because they teach from an integral and undivided self, they manifest in their own lives, and evoke in their students, a capacity for connectedness".

David Jonassen identified three major roles for facilitators to support students in constructivist learning environments:
* Modeling
* [[Coaching]]
* [[Instructional scaffolding|Scaffolding]]&lt;ref name="Jonassen"&gt;[http://www.moe.gov.sg/edumall/mpite/edtech/papers/d1.pdf Jonassen, D. H. (1999).]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Constructing learning environments on the web: Engaging students in meaningful learning. ''EdTech 99: Educational Technology Conference and Exhibition 1999: Thinking Schools, Learning Nation.'' {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A brief description of the Jonassen major roles are:

'''Modeling''' – Jonassen describes Modeling as the most commonly used instructional strategy in CLEs. Two types of modeling exist: behavioural modeling of the overt performance and cognitive modeling of the covert cognitive processes. Behavioural modeling in Constructivist Learning Environments demonstrates how to perform the activities identified in the activity structure. Cognitive modeling articulates the reasoning (reflection-in-action) that learners should use while engaged in the activities.

'''Coaching''' – For Jonassen the role of coach is complex and inexact. She acknowledges that a good coach motivates learners, analyzes their performance, provides feedback and advice on the performance and how to learn about how to perform, and provokes reflection and articulation of what was learned. Moreover, she posits that coaching may be solicited by the learner. Students seeking help might press a "How am I Doing?" button. Or coaching may be unsolicited, when the coach observes the performance and provides encouragement, diagnosis, directions, and feedback. Coaching naturally and necessarily involves responses that are situated in the learner's task performance (Laffey, Tupper, Musser, &amp; Wedman, 1997).

'''Scaffolding''' - Scaffolding is a more systemic approach to supporting the learner, focusing on the task, the environment, the teacher, and the learner. Scaffolding provides temporary frameworks to support learning and student performance beyond their capacities. The concept of scaffolding represents any kind of support for cognitive activity that is provided by an adult when the child and adult are performing the task together (Wood &amp; Middleton, 1975).

===Constructivist learning environments (CLEs)===
Jonassen has proposed a model for developing constructivist learning environments (CLEs) around a specific learning goal. This goal may take one of several forms, from least to most complex:
* Question or issue
* Case study
* Long-term Project
* Problem (multiple cases and projects integrated at the curriculum level)

Jonassen recommends making the learning goals engaging and relevant but not overly structured.

In CLEs, learning is driven by the problem to be solved; students learn content and theory in order to solve the problem. This is different from traditional objectivist teaching where the theory would be presented first and problems would be used afterwards to practice theory.

Depending on students' prior experiences, related cases and scaffolding may be necessary for support. Instructors also need to provide an authentic context for tasks, plus information resources, cognitive tools, and collaborative tools.&lt;ref name="Jonassen" /&gt;

===Assessment===
Traditionally, assessment in the classrooms is based on testing.  In this style, it is important for the student to produce the correct answers.  However, in constructivist teaching, the process of gaining knowledge is viewed as being just as important as the product.  Thus, assessment is based not only on tests, but also on observation of the student, the student's work, and the student's points of view.&lt;ref name="thirteenorg"/&gt;  Some assessment strategies include:
*Oral discussions.  The teacher presents students with a "focus" question and allows an open discussion on the topic.
*KWL(H) Chart (What we know, What we want to know, What we have learned, How we know it).  This technique can be used throughout the course of study for a particular topic, but is also a good assessment technique as it shows the teacher the progress of the student throughout the course of study.
*Mind Mapping.  In this activity, students list and categorize the concepts and ideas relating to a topic.
*Hands-on activities.  These encourage students to manipulate their environments or a particular learning tool.  Teachers can use a checklist and observation to assess student success with the particular material.
*Pre-testing.  This allows a teacher to determine what knowledge students bring to a new topic and thus will be helpful in directing the course of study.&lt;ref name="templeedu"/&gt;

==An example of a lesson taught with a Constructivist background==

A good example of a lesson being taught in a constructivist way, with the teacher mediating learning rather than directly teaching the class is shown by the example of [[Michael Faraday|Faraday]]'s [[The Chemical History of a Candle|candle]]. There are various forms of this lesson, but all are developed from the Christmas lectures Faraday gave on the functioning of candles. In open constructivist lessons using these lectures as a basis, students are encouraged to discover for themselves how candles work. They do this first by making simple observations, from which they later build ideas and hypotheses which they then go on to test. The teacher acts to encourage this learning. If successful, students can use this lesson to understand the components of combustion, an important chemistry topic.&lt;ref name="faraday"&gt;* {{cite journal|

==Constructivism for adults==
Constructivist philosophy has a long history of application in education programs for young children, but is used less frequently in adult learning environments. As humans develop,  there are qualitative changes in their ability to think logically about experiences, but the processes by which learning occurs, [[Jean Piaget|cognitive adaptation]] and [[Vygotsky|social mediation]], are believed to be continuous or remain the same throughout the life.&lt;ref&gt;Piaget, J. &amp; Inhelder, B. (1969). The Psychology of the child. New York: Basic Books, Inc. Vygotsky, L.S. (1978). Mind in society: The development of higher psychological processes. Cambridge: MA, Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; At the heart of constructivist philosophy is the belief that knowledge is not given but gained through real experiences that have purpose and meaning to the learner, and the exchange of perspectives about the experience with others&lt;ref&gt;Piaget, J. &amp; Inhelder, B. (1969). The Psychology of the child. New York: Basic Books, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Jean Piaget|Piaget]] &amp; Inhelder, 1969; [[Vygotsky]],1978).

Learning environments for adults based on constructivist philosophy include opportunities for students to make meaningful connections between new material and previous experience, through discovery. One of the simplest ways to do this is asking [[Closed-ended question|open-ended questions]]. Open-ended questions such as "Tell me about a time when... ." or "How might this information be useful to you?" cause learners to think about how new information may relate to their own experience.  Student responses to such questions are opportunities for experiencing the perspectives of others.  For these questions to be effective it is critical that instructors focus on teaching content that is useful for participants.  The importance of using these types of strategies with adults contributes to what&lt;ref&gt;Bain, Ken. (2004). What the Best College Teachers Do. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University  Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Bain(2004 p.&amp;nbsp;4) noted as critical learning environments where instructors "embed" the skills they are teaching in "authentic tasks that will arouse curiosity, challenge students to rethink assumptions and examine their mental modes of reality". Mezirow J. (1997) who asserts that learners need to practice in recognizing frames of reference and using their imaginations to redefine problems from different perspectives. (pg. 10) I made the connection by also adding the point that "to promote discovery learning, the educator often reframes learner questions in terms of the learner's current level of understanding. Learning contracts, group projects, role play, case studies, and simulations are classroom methods associated with transformative education." Such approaches emphasize that learning is not an "all or nothing" process but that students learn the new information that is presented to them by building upon knowledge that they already possess.  It is therefore important that teachers constantly assess the knowledge their students have gained to make sure that the students' perceptions of the new knowledge are what the teacher had intended.  Teachers will find that since the students build upon already existing knowledge, when they are called upon to retrieve the new information, they may make errors.  It is known as reconstruction error when we fill in the gaps of our understanding with logical, though incorrect, thoughts.  Teachers need to catch and try to correct these errors, though it is inevitable that some reconstruction error will continue to occur because of our innate retrieval limitations.

In most pedagogies based on constructivism, the teacher's role is not only to observe and assess but to also engage with the students while they are completing activities, wondering aloud and posing questions to the students for promotion of [[reasoning]] (DeVries et al., 2002).  (ex: I wonder why the water does not spill over the edge of the full cup?)  Teachers also intervene when there are conflicts that arise; however, they simply facilitate the students' resolutions and [[Self-control|self-regulation]], with an emphasis on the conflict being the students' and that they must figure things out for themselves. For example, promotion of literacy is accomplished by integrating the need to read and write throughout individual activities within print-rich classrooms.  The teacher, after reading a story, encourages the students to write or draw stories of their own, or by having the students reenact a story that they may know well, both activities encourage the students to ''conceive themselves'' as reader and writers.

==Arguments against constructivist teaching techniques==
{{Main article|Constructivism (learning theory)}}
Critics have voiced the following arguments against constructivist based teaching instruction:

* A group of cognitive scientists has also questioned the central claims of constructivism, saying that they are either misleading or contradict known findings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://act-r.psy.cmu.edu/papers/misapplied.html Applications and Misapplications of Cognitive Psychology to Mathematics Education]&lt;/ref&gt;
* One possible deterrent for this teaching method is that, due to the emphasis on group work, the ideas of the more active students may dominate the group's conclusions.&lt;ref name="thirteenorg"/&gt;

While proponents of constructivism argue that constructivist students perform better than their peers when tested on higher-order reasoning, the critics of constructivism argue that this teaching technique forces students to "[[Reinventing the wheel|reinvent the wheel]]".  Supporters counter that "Students do not reinvent the wheel but, rather, attempt to understand how it turns, how it functions."&lt;ref name="thirteenorg"/&gt; Proponents argue that students&amp;mdash;especially [[elementary school]]-aged children&amp;mdash;are naturally curious about the world, and giving them the tools to explore it in a guided manner will serve to give them a stronger understanding of it.&lt;ref name="thirteenorg"/&gt;

Mayer (2004)&lt;ref name="Mayer"&gt;[http://projects.ict.usc.edu/itw/vtt/MayerThreeStrikesAP04.pdf  Should There Be a Three-Strikes Rule Against Pure Discovery Learning?], Mayer, 2004, ''American Psychologist, 59''(1), 14–19&lt;/ref&gt; developed a literature review spanning fifty years and concluded "The research in this brief review shows that the formula constructivism = hands-on activity is a formula for educational disaster." His argument is that [[active learning]] is often suggested by those subscribing to this philosophy. In developing this instruction these educators produce materials that require learning to be behaviorally active and not be "cognitively active".&lt;ref name="Mayer" /&gt; That is, although they are engaged in activity, they may not be learning (Sweller, 1988). Mayer recommends using guided discovery, a mix of direct instruction and hands-on activity, rather than pure discovery: "In many ways, guided discovery appears to offer the best method for promoting constructivist learning."&lt;ref name="Mayer" /&gt;

Kirchner et al. (2006) agree with the basic premise of constructivism, that learners construct knowledge, but are concerned with the instructional design recommendations of this theoretical framework. "The constructivist description of learning is accurate, but the instructional consequences suggested by constructivists do not necessarily follow." (Kirschner, Sweller, and Clark, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;78). Specifically, they say instructors often design unguided instruction that relies on the learner to "discover or construct essential information for themselves" (Kirchner et al., 2006, p75).

For this reason they state that it "is easy to agree with Mayer's (2004)&lt;ref name="Mayer" /&gt; recommendation that we "move educational reform efforts from the fuzzy and nonproductive world of ideology—which sometimes hides under the various banners of constructivism—to the sharp and productive world of theory-based research on how people learn" (p.&amp;nbsp;18). Finally Kirschner, Sweller, and Clark (2006) cite Mayer&lt;ref name="Mayer" /&gt; to conclude fifty years of empirical results do not support unguided instruction.

==Specific approaches==
Specific approaches to education that are based on constructivism include the following:

=== Constructionism ===
An approach to learning based on the constructivist learning ideologies presented by Jean Piaget (Harel &amp; Papert, 1991). In this approach, the individual is consciously engaged in the construction of a product (Li, Cheng, &amp; Liu, 2013). The utilization of constructionism in educational settings has been shown to promote higher-order thinking skills such as problem-solving and critical thinking (Li et al., 2013).

=== Guided instruction ===
A learning approach in which the educator uses strategically placed prompts, cues, questions, direct explanations, and modeling to guide student thinking and facilitate an increased responsibility for the completion of a task (Fisher &amp; Frey, 2010).

=== Problem-based learning ===
A structured educational approach which consists of large and small group discussions (Schmidt &amp; Loyens, 2007). [[Problem-based learning]] begins with an educator presenting a series of carefully constructed problems or issues to small groups of students (Schmidt &amp; Loyens, 2007).  The problems or issues typically pertain to phenomena or events to which students possess limited prior knowledge (Schmidt &amp; Loyens, 2007). The first component of problem-based learning is to discuss prior knowledge and ask questions related to the specific problems or issues (Schmidt &amp; Loyens, 2007). Following the class discussion, there is typically time in which students individually research or reflect on the newly acquired information and/or seek out areas requiring further exploration (Schmidt &amp; Loyens, 2007). After a pre-determined amount of time (as outlined by the educator), students will meet in the same small groups that were composed prior to the class discussion (Schmidt &amp; Loyens, 2007). In the first meeting, groups will spend between one and three hours further discussing the problems or issues from class in addition to presenting any new information collected during individual research (Schmidt &amp; Loyens, 2007). Following the first meeting, students will independently reflect on the group discussion, specifically in comparing thoughts regarding the problems or issues in question (Schmidt &amp; Loyens, 2007). Typically, groups will meet a second time to critically analyse individual and group thoughts and discussions and will attempt to synthesize the information in order to draw conclusions about the given problem or issue (Schmidt &amp; Loyens, 2007).  Within the educational setting, problem-based learning has enabled students to actively construct individual understandings of a topic using both prior and newly acquired knowledge (Schmidt &amp; Loyens, 2007). Moreover, students also develop self-directed and group learning skills which ultimately facilitates the comprehension of the problems or issues (Schmidt &amp; Loyens, 2007).

==== Inquiry-based learning ====
An educational approach associated with problem-based learning in which the student learns through investigating issues or scenarios (Hakverdi-Can &amp; Sonmez, 2012). In this approach, students pose and answer questions individually and/or collaboratively in order to draw conclusions regarding the specific issues or scenarios (Hakverdi-Can &amp; Sonmez, 2012). Within the educational setting, [[inquiry-based learning]] has been beneficial in developing student inquiry, investigation, and collaboration skills, in turn, increasing overall comprehension of the issue or scenario (Hakverdi-Can &amp; Sonmez, 2012).

Effective essential questions include student thought and research, connect to student's reality and can be solved in different ways (Crane, 2009).  There are no incorrect answers to essential questions, rather answers reveal student understanding(Crane, 2009).

==== Anchored instruction ====
An educational approach associated with problem-based learning in which the educator introduces an 'anchor' or theme in which students will be able to explore (Kariuki &amp; Duran, 2004). The 'anchor' acts as a focal point for the entire task, allowing students to identify, define, and explore problems while exploring the topic from a variety of different perspectives (Kariuki &amp; Duran, 2004).

=== Cooperative learning ===
A variety of educational approaches focusing on individuals working together to achieve a specific learning outcome (Hsiung, 2012). 

==== Reciprocal Peer Teaching ====
A [[cooperative learning]] approach wherein students alternate roles as teacher and learner (Krych, March, Bryan, Peake, Wojciech, &amp; Carmichael, 2005). The utilization of Reciprocal Peer Teaching (RPT) in educational settings has been effective in the development of teamwork, leadership, and communication skills in addition to improving students' understanding of course content (Krych et al., 2005).

==== Jigsaw ====
{{main article|Jigsaw (teaching technique)}}
A highly structured cooperative learning approach which is implemented in four stages: introduction, focused exploration, reporting and re-shaping, and integration and evaluation. In the introduction stage, the class is divided into heterogeneous 'home' groups consisting of between three and seven students (Karacop &amp; Doymus, 2013). Upon establishing the 'home' groups, the teacher will discuss the subtopics pertaining to the subject matter (Karacop &amp; Doymus, 2013). In the focused exploration stage, each student within all 'home' groups selects one of the subtopics (Karacop &amp; Doymus, 2013). Students from each 'home' group that have selected the same subtopic will form a 'jigsaw' group (Karacop &amp; Doymus, 2013). It is in the 'jigsaw' group that students will explore the material pertaining to the subtopic and will prepare for teaching it to their 'home' group, the reporting and re-shaping stage (Karacop &amp; Doymus, 2013). The approach concludes in the fourth stage, integration and evaluation, wherein each of the 'home' groups combine the learning of each subtopic together to create the completed piece of work (Karacop &amp; Doymus, 2013).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3815">'''Creative Writers and Day-Dreaming''' ({{lang-de|Der Dichter und das Phantasieren}}), was an informal talk given in 1907 by [[Sigmund Freud]], and subsequently published in 1908, on the relationship between unconscious [[fantasy (psychology)|phantasy]] and creative art.

Freud's argument – that artists, reviving memories of childhood [[daydream]]s and play activities, succeeded in making them acceptable through their aesthetic technique&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Freud: A Life for Our Time'' (1989) p. 307&lt;/ref&gt; – was to be widely influential for interwar [[modernism]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Berman, ''Translating Modernism'' (2010) p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic sources==
Freud began his talk by raising the question of where writers drew their material from, suggesting that children at play, and adults day-dreaming, both provided cognate activities to those of the literary artist.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Freud'' (1989) p. 307-8&lt;/ref&gt; Heroic and erotic daydreams or [[preconscious]] phantasies in both men and women were seen by Freud as providing substitute satisfactions for everyday deprivations;&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''On Psychopathology'' (PFL 10) p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; and the same phantasies were in turn turned into shareable (public) artistic constructs by the creative writer, where they could serve as cultural surrogates for the universal instinctual renunciations inherent in civilization.&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''Civilization, Society and Religion'' (PFL 12) p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic technique==
Freud saw the aesthetic principle as the ability to turn the private phantasy into a public artefact, using artistic pleasure to release a deeper pleasure founded on the release of forbidden (unconscious) material.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Freud'' (1989) p.&amp;nbsp;308&lt;/ref&gt; The process allowed the writer him/herself to emerge from their introversion and return to the public world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Fenichel]], The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 479&lt;/ref&gt; If the phantasies came too close to the unconscious repressed, however, the process would fail, leading either to creative inhibition or to a rejection of the artwork itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Fenichel]], The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud himself epitomised his essay's argument a decade later in his ''Introductory Lectures'',&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''Introductory lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 1) p. 423-3&lt;/ref&gt; stating of the true artist that: &lt;blockquote&gt;"he understands how to work over his daydreams in such a way as to make them lose what is too personal in them and repels strangers, and to make it possible for others to share in the enjoyment of them. He understands, too, how to tone them down so that they do not easily betray their origin from proscribed sources....he has thus achieved ''through'' his phantasy what originally he had achieved only ''in'' his phantasy – honour, power and the love of women".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4343">'''Elisabeth Anne Lloyd''' (born September 3, 1956) is an American philosopher of biology. She currently holds the Arnold and Maxine Tanis Chair of [[History and Philosophy of Science]] and is also professor of biology, adjunct professor of philosophy at [[Indiana University]], affiliated faculty scholar at the [[Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction]] and Adjunct Faculty at the Center for the Integrative Study of Animal Behavior.

==Early life and education==
Lloyd was born in [[Morristown, New Jersey]], and earned her BA in science and political theory from [[University of Colorado, Boulder]] in 1980, ''summa cum laude''.  Lloyd studied under [[Bas van Fraassen]] at [[Princeton University]] for a PhD in philosophy 1980{{spaced ndash}}1984. While a student at Princeton, she spent a year (1983) studying with [[Richard C. Lewontin]] at [[Harvard University | Harvard's]] [[Museum of Comparative Zoology]].&lt;ref&gt; Lloyd, E.A. 1994. The Structure and Confirmation of Evolutionary Theory. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ, p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
She worked as an assistant professor in the Department of Philosophy at [[University of California, San Diego]], 1985–88; and then was assistant professor, then associate professor, then full professor in the Department of Philosophy at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] from 1988 to 1999, before moving to [[Indiana University]]. Her 2005 book, ''The Case of the Female Orgasm,'' was widely discussed in the scholarly and popular press, including ''[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]'', ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]].''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/17/science/17orga.html?scp=1&amp;sq=elisabeth%20lloyd&amp;st=cse&lt;/ref&gt; The book criticizes what it portrays as anti-scientific biases infecting the many proposed adaptive explanations of female orgasm. Lloyd goes on to argue that the available evidence, such as from sexology studies, is far more supportive of a neutral "byproduct" explanation put forward by [[Donald Symons]], under which female orgasm is the result of orgasm developing as a species trait due to its critical role in males for procreation (akin to explanations for why nipples, which are required for nursing in females, are also present in males).  The book received so much attention that it was lampooned on an episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' because its title sounds like a racy version of a [[Hardy Boys]] novel. Lloyd had been working on the subject for two years, when a discussion with [[Stephen Jay Gould]] in 1986 led to her providing the basis for his 1987 essay in ''[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]]''  titled 'Freudian Slip',&lt;ref name="freudianslip"&gt;Gould, S.J. (1987). Freudian Slip. ''Natural History 96'' (2): 14-21.&lt;/ref&gt; which was reprinted in 1992 as 'Male Nipples and Clitoral Ripples.'&lt;ref name="bullyforbrontosaurus"&gt;Gould, S.J. (1992).

Because of his original philosophical position, the so-called ''neoparmenidism'', Severino has been claimed to be "a giant" and "the only philosopher who in the 20th century can be compared to [[Heidegger]]".{Massimo Cacciari}

In 1970, the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] ruled that Severino's ideas are not compatible with Christianity as the basis of Severino's belief in "the eternity of all being," a belief said to eliminate a Creator God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ncronline.org/print/25459|author=John L. Allen, Jr.|title=Meet the new Crown Prince of Catholicism|work=National Catholic Reporter|date=7-1-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Severino has received from the [[List of Presidents of the Italian Republic|President of the Italian Republic]] the "Golden medal of the Republic for culture merits" (''Medaglia d’oro della Repubblica per i Benemeriti della Cultura''). He is also a member of [[Accademia dei Lincei]], the official Italian scientific [[academy]]. He has won several prizes and writes opinion pieces on the ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' newspaper.

== The eternity of all beings ==
Severino confronts an ancient problem, rooted in Plato and Aristotle and taken up in the modern era by Heidegger, that of Being. For Severino, all the philosophies which have been formed up to now are characterized by one fundamental error, faith in the Greek sense of becoming. Indeed, since the ancient Greeks, a being (or anything which is) has been considered as coming from nothing, granted existence temporarily, and then returning into nothing.
Severino, reflecting on the absolute opposition between [[Being]] and [[meontology|non-Being]], given that between the two terms there is nothing in common, considers it evident that being can only remain constantly unchanging, not being changed by anything which is not itself. Thus, since Being is the totality of what exists, there can be nothing else besides it endowed with existence (Severino thereby refutes the concept of ontological difference as put forward by Heidegger). For Severino, therefore, the entire history of philosophy is based on the erroneous conviction that Being can become nothing. 


== Bibliography ==
Not many of Severino’s works have been translated, due to the lack of interest in Italian philosophy in the rest of Europe.  One of his crucial work has been translated into German: ''Vom Wesen des Nihilismus'', and into English as ''The Essence of Nihilism''.

'''Francisco do Monte Alverne''' (August 9, 1784 – December 2, 1858) was a [[Brazil]]ian [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] [[friar]], and the official preacher of the [[Empire of Brazil]].

He is the correspondent patron of the 14th chair of the [[Academia Brasileira de Letras|Brazilian Academy of Letters]].

==Life==
Monte Alverne was born '''Francisco José de Carvalho''' in 1784, to João Antônio da Silva and Ana Francisca da Conceição. In 1802, he entered a Franciscan monastery, where he studied alongside 11 [[Brazilians]] and 11 [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] people. In 1808, he became a [[presbyter]], and was given the surname '''Monte Alverne''', in a reference to the mount [[La Verna]], where [[Francis of Assisi|Saint Francis of Assisi]] received the [[stigmata]]s.

Later he became an itinerant preacher and Philosophy teacher. Moving to [[Rio de Janeiro]] in 1816, he was proclaimed the royal preacher. He performed the funeral oration of [[Maria Leopoldina of Austria|Empress Consort Maria Leopoldina]] in 1826.

From 1836, Monte Alverne started to show signs of blindness. He moved to a friend's house in [[Niterói]], where he died in 1858.

The Brazilian poet [[Gonçalves de Magalhães, Viscount of Araguaia|Gonçalves de Magalhães]], famous for introducing [[Romanticism]] in the [[literature of Brazil|Brazilian literature]], considers Monte Alverne a forerunner of this movement.

==Works==
* ''Obras Oratórias'' ([[1833 in literature|1833]] – in 4 volumes)
* ''Compêndio de Filosofia'' ([[1859 in literature|1859]] – posthumous), in which he defends the [[Eclecticism]] and the ideals of [[John Locke]] and [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac]], and fights against the [[Thomism]] and the [[Scholasticism]].

A '''fringe theory''' is an idea or viewpoint which differs from the accepted scholarship in its field. Fringe theories include the models and proposals of [[fringe science]], as well as similar ideas in other areas of scholarship, such as the [[humanities]]. The term ''fringe theory'' is commonly used in a narrower sense as a [[pejorative]], roughly synonymous with [[pseudo-scholarship]]. Precise definitions that distinguish between widely held viewpoints, fringe theories, and pseudo-scholarship are difficult to construct because of the [[demarcation problem]]. Issues of [[false balance]] or [[false equivalence]] can occur when fringe theories are presented as being equal to widely accepted theories.

==Definitions==
[[File:Circlon periodic table excerpt.jpeg|thumb|alt=Part of a fringe theory periodic table|Part of the [[periodic table]], according to [[Jim Carter (pseudoscientist)|Jim Carter]]'s fringe theory]]

Fringe theories are ideas which depart significantly from a prevailing or [[mainstream]] theory. A fringe theory is neither a majority opinion nor that of a respected minority.&lt;ref name=Jasanoff /&gt;{{sfn |Rundlett |2013 |p=5-88}} The term in general is closer to the popular understanding of the word ''theory''—a [[hypothesis]], [[guess]], or uncertain idea—than to the concept of an established [[scientific theory]].&lt;ref name=Morrison /&gt; Although the term is often used within the context of [[fringe science]], fringe theories have been discussed in diverse areas of scholarship, including [[Biblical criticism]],&lt;ref name=Collins /&gt; history,&lt;ref name=Joseph /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fritze /&gt; finance,{{sfn |Davidson |2002 |pp=125–126}} law,&lt;ref name=Bluestone /&gt; medicine,&lt;ref name=Sabbagh /&gt;{{sfn |Batt |1996 |p=206}} and politics.{{sfn |Quinn |2012 |p=143}} They even exist in fields of study which are themselves outside the mainstream, such as [[cryptozoology]]{{sfn |Shiel |2013 |p=157}} and [[parapsychology]].&lt;ref name=Stokes /&gt;

Fringe theories meet with varying levels of academic acceptance.&lt;ref name=Abrams /&gt; Financial journalist [[Alexander Davidson (financial journalist)|Alexander Davidson]] characterized fringe theories as "peddled by a small band of staunch supporters," but not necessarily without merit.{{sfn |Davidson |2002 |pp=125–126}} [[Daniel N. Robinson]] described them as occupying "a limbo between the decisive dead end and the ultimately credible productive theory."&lt;ref name=Robinson /&gt; However, the term is also used [[pejorative]]ly; advocates of fringe theories are dismissed as [[crank (person)|cranks]] or crackpots who are out of touch with reality.{{sfn |Wertheim |2011 |p=4}}&lt;ref name=Timmer /&gt; In this sense, there is some overlap with other dismissive labels, such as [[pseudoarchaeology]],&lt;ref name=Fritze /&gt;&lt;ref name=Magnusson /&gt; [[pseudohistory]],&lt;ref name=Fritze /&gt; and [[pseudoscience]].{{sfn |Thurs |Numbers |2013 |p=138}} Describing ideas as fringe theories may be less pejorative than describing them as [[pseudoscholarship]];{{sfn |Fritze |2009 |p=18}} while it is unlikely that anyone would identify their own work as pseudoscience,&lt;ref name=Hansson /&gt; [[astrologer]] [[David Cochrane (astrologer)|David Cochrane]] is "proud to be a fringe theorist."&lt;ref name=Cochrane /&gt;

The term is also used to describe [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]]. Such theories "explain" historical or political events as the work of a powerful secret organization — "a vast, insidious, preternaturally effective international conspiratorial network," according to [[Richard Hofstadter]].&lt;ref name=Hofstadter /&gt; The conspirators are possessed of "almost superhuman power and cunning," as described by historian [[Esther Webman]].{{sfn |Webman |2011 |p=8}}

[[Margaret Wertheim]] suggested that fringe theories should be treated in a manner similar to [[outsider art]]. In 2003 she curated an exhibit at the [[Santa Monica Museum of Art]] which was dedicated to the work of fringe physicist [[Jim Carter (scientist)|Jim Carter]].{{sfn |Wertheim |2011 |pp=11–12, 44}}

===Demarcation problem===
Wertheim wrote that a "credentialed physicist ... can generally recognize a fringe theory by sight" when it comes in the form of an eccentrically formatted manuscript.{{sfn |Wertheim |2011 |p=4}} However, it is difficult to distinguish between fringe theories and respected minority theories. A workable definition of what constitutes a fringe theory may not actually be possible.&lt;ref name=Jasanoff /&gt;{{sfn |Rundlett |2013 |p=5-88}} This is an aspect of the [[demarcation problem]] that occurs  within both [[science]] and the [[humanities]].{{sfn |Hansson |2013 |pp=64–65}}

Geologist [[Steven Dutch]] approached the demarcation problem by dividing scientific ideas into three categories: fringe, frontier, and center, based upon their adherence to scientific methodology and their level of acceptance.&lt;ref name=Dutch /&gt; Later authors, including [[Richard Duschl]], expanded these categories. Under Duschl's system, a fringe theory is a mix of legitimate new ideas and pseudoscience; it awaits analysis to determine whether it will pass into the "frontier" or be rejected entirely.{{sfn |Erduran |Dagher |2013 |p=117}}

==Mainstream impact==
[[File:Alfred Wegener ca.1924-30.jpg|thumb|alt=Alfred Wegener|[[Alfred Wegener]] advanced the theory of continental drift, a fringe theory which was later adopted by mainstream science]]

The majority of fringe theories never become part of established scholarship.&lt;ref name=Timmer /&gt; Rejected ideas may help to refine mainstream thought,{{sfn |Ullmann-Margalit |2006 |p=20}} but most outside theories are simply incorrect and have no wider impact.&lt;ref name=Timmer /&gt; Nevertheless, some ideas do gradually receive wider acceptance until they are no longer viewed as fringe theories. Occasionally such theories even become the mainstream view.

A widely known example is [[Alfred Wegener]]'s theory of [[continental drift]], which eventually served as the basis for the accepted model of [[plate tectonics]].&lt;ref name=Timmer /&gt;{{sfn |Bell |2005 |p=138}} Other ideas which have made the transition include the [[germ theory of disease]],{{sfn |Velasquez-Manoff |2013 |p=40}} [[Kristian Birkeland|Birkeland's]] explanation of the [[aurora]],{{sfn |Jago |2002 |pp=270—272}} [[prion]]s,&lt;ref name=Timmer /&gt; and [[Complex systems|complexity theory]] in [[project management]].{{sfn |Curlee |Gordon |2013 |p=198}} [[Behavioral finance]] was described in a 2002 journal article as "at the fringe of&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;modern financial theory",&lt;ref name=Leong /&gt; but it has since been widely applied in many fields of business.&lt;ref name=Steverman /&gt;

Sometimes this change is not gradual; in such cases it represents a [[paradigm shift]]. Writing for the ''[[New York Law Journal]]'', [[Andrew Bluestone]] described how a single court case in New York changed the use of an obscure [[common law]] statute regarding [[attorney misconduct]] from a "fringe theory of law" to an accepted, mainstream cause for legal action in the state.&lt;ref name=Bluestone /&gt;

Similarly, former mainstream theories such as [[Phlogiston theory|phlogiston]] and [[luminiferous aether]] may be [[Superseded scientific theories|superseded]] and relegated to the fringe.{{sfn |Shermer |2013|pp=220–221}}

Such shifts between fringe theory and accepted theories are not always clear-cut. In 1963, [[Reuben Fine]] wrote that mainstream psychology had adopted aspects of [[Sigmund Freud]]'s [[psychoanalysis]] but that many students of the discipline believed psychoanalysis to be a "lunatic fringe theory which has little to do with scientific psychology",{{sfn |Fine |2013 |p=228}} and psychoanalysis is now generally considered discredited, according to author [[Frederick Crews]] who stated, "if you consult psychology faculties in top American universities, you will find almost no one now who believes in the Freudian system of thought. As a research paradigm it’s pretty much dead."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=PBS NewsHour: Professor Frederick Crews|date=6 Jan 1999|publisher=PBS|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/health-jan-june99-freud_crews/|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==False balance==
The [[news media]] may play a role in the dissemination and popularization of fringe theories. The media sometimes reduce complex topics to two sides and frame issues in terms of an [[Underdog (term)|underdog]] challenger fighting the mainstream theory. [[Biblical studies|Biblical scholar]] Matthew Collins wrote that this simplification can be "both misrepresentative and misleading, especially when a far-fetched fringe theory is, in the name of neutrality and fairness, elevated to the role of equally legitimate contender."&lt;ref name=Collins /&gt; This [[False balance|false equivalence]] can become the expected media behavior. When ''[[The New York Times]]'' published an article strongly supporting the mainstream scientific stance on the [[thiomersal controversy]],&lt;ref name=Harris /&gt; others in the media condemned the ''Times'' for portraying the alleged vaccine-autism connection as a fringe theory, calling the article a "hit piece".{{sfn |Offit |2010 |p=182}}

Issues of false balance also arise in education, especially in the context of the [[creation–evolution controversy]]. [[Creationism]] has been discredited as a fringe theory akin to [[Lamarckism]] or the cosmology of [[Immanuel Velikovsky]]'s ''[[Worlds in Collision]]''. Because advocates of creationism want schools to present only their preferred alternative, not the entire variety of minority views, they have attempted to portray scholarship on the issue as being equally divided between only two models.&lt;ref name=Edwords /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wexler /&gt;

The '''Guiyang school''' ({{zh|c=潙仰宗|p=Guīyǎng Zōng}}, also read '''Weiyang School'''&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite book |title= Infinite Compassion, Endless Wisdom: The Practice of the Bodhisattva Path|last= Hsing Yun |first= |authorlink=Hsing Yun |year= 2009|publisher=Buddha's Light Publishing |location= |isbn=978-1-932293-36-4 |page=37 |pages= |accessdate=August 9, 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QSNDEf7PH3cC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=%22weiyang+school%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=__n0XDCrhg&amp;sig=jvzd_PyQ6VIleP839Qcx7EtowRM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3YAjUN3uCc2UiAfplIHwCQ&amp;redir_esc=y&amp;hl=zh-CN&amp;sourceid=cndr#v=onepage&amp;q=%22weiyang%20school%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is one of the sects of [[Chan Buddhism]].

==History==
The Guiyang school was the first established house of the [[Five Houses of Chán]].&lt;ref name="Ferguson"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ferguson |first1=Andrew E. |title=Zen's Chinese Heritage: The Masters and Their Teachings |url= |year=2000 |publisher=Wisdom Publications |location=Somerville MA |isbn=0-86171-163-7 |pages=126–127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guiyang is named after master Guishan Lingyou (771–854) and his disciple, Yangshan Huiji (813–890).

Guishan was a disciple of [[Baizhang Huaihai]], the Chan master whose disciples included [[Huangbo Xiyun]], who in turn taught [[Linji Yixuan]], founder of the [[Linji school]].&lt;ref&gt;Ven. Jian Hu. "Buddhism in the Modern World" Stanford University, May 25, 2006, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  After founding the Guiyang School, Yangshan moved his school to what is now modern [[Jiangxi]].

The Guiyang school is distinct from the other schools in many ways, notably in its use of esoteric metaphors and imagery in the school's [[kōan]]s and other teachings.&lt;ref name="Ferguson"/&gt; [[Hsuan Hua]] (April 16, 1918 – June 7, 1995) was the best-known modern representative of the Guiyang school.

==Absorption into the Linji school==
Over the course of Song Dynasty (960–1279), the Guiyang school, along with the [[Fayan school|Fayan]] and [[Yunmen school]]s were absorbed into the [[Linji school]]. [[Hsu Yun]] attempted to revive these absorbed lineages and succeeded in the case of the Guiyang school.

'''Henderik Roelof "Hans" Rookmaaker''' (February 27, 1922 – March 13, 1977) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Christian]] scholar, professor, and author who wrote and lectured on art theory, art history, music, philosophy, and religion.

In 1948 he met [[Christian]] [[theology|theologian]] [[Francis Schaeffer]] and became a member of [[L'Abri]] in [[Switzerland]]. Hans and his wife Anky opened a Dutch branch of L'Abri in 1971.

Following a doctorate in art history with a dissertation on Gauguin at the [[University of Amsterdam]], he became the founder of the art history department at the [[Vrije Universiteit|Free University]] in Amsterdam.

Rookmaaker combined his academic career with a prolific role of addressing ambiguity about art among Christians and ambiguity about faith among artists. His main thesis was laid out in his 1970 publication entitled ''Modern Art and The Death of a Culture''.

Throughout his career, he lectured in the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], and [[Canada]], as well as in his native [[Kingdom of the Netherlands|Netherlands]].

Two books by Rookmaaker were published posthumously: ''Art Needs No Justification'' in 1978 and ''The Creative Gift : Essays on Art and the Christian Life'' in 1981. In 2003 ''The Complete Works of Hans Rookmaaker'', edited by his daughter Marleen Hengelaar-Rookmaaker, were published.

== Childhood and youth ==

Born in [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]] Hans was the last born in a non-Christian family of colonizers with non-white blood, his grandmother having been half Indonesian.  He was largely raised in Indonesia, but returned to Holland to join the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]].  Already as a teenager he had begun what would become an extensive collection of African-American music. As a junior officer, he began to study ship construction at [[Delft University]] prior to the start of [[World War II]]. There, prior to the war, Rookmaaker met and became engaged to Riki Spetter, who was Jewish.

== Conversion to Christianity ==
As Rookmaaker was a naval officer, he was interned as a prisoner of war in [[Stanislau]], now [[Ukraine]] and later on in [[Neubrandenburg]] in northern [[Germany]]. In Stanislau he met the Christian philosopher [[J.P.A. Mekkes]] who would have a lasting impact on his life. He returned home as a Christian, but was severely tested as his bride-to-be was nowhere to be found. His study of the Old Testament, dedicated to her during the camp years, never reached her. It has been established that Sophia Henriëtte Spetter died in Auschwitz on September 30, 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.auschwitz.nl/paviljoen/nederlanders-in-auschwitz/naam |title=Ieder mens heeft een naam |publisher= Auschwitz NL | accessdate= 2012-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rookmaaker changed his career and took up a doctoral study in art history. In 1948, through his fiancé and bride-to-be Anky Huitker, he met [[Francis Schaeffer]]. This was the beginning of a lifelong friendship with a very fruitful exchange of ideas. Rookmaaker had a dominant influence on Schaeffer's ideas on art and culture &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.crossway.org/product/9781581348576 |title= Francis Schaeffer: An Authentic Life — Books |publisher=Crossway |date= 2008-06-30 |accessdate= 2012-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also introduced Schaeffer to [[Reformational philosophy]].

Rookmaaker's famous saying "Jesus didn't come to make us Christian. Jesus came to make us fully human" formed the central theme of Dick Staub's 2010 book ''About You''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.spiritualityandpractice.com/books/books.php?id=20171 |title= Book Review: About You, by Dick Staub | work = Spirituality &amp; Practice | accessdate=2012-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

Rookmaaker stood in the tradition of [[Neo-Calvinism]], developed in the late 19th century. The essential feature of this philosophy is the treatment of all of life as God's [[Genesis creation myth|creation]]. There is no neutrality, while [[secularism]] is just another religion. Rookmaaker ventured to apply this basic viewpoint to culture. With his expert ear of black music, multi-cultural roots and after a profound change of direction, he devoted his PhD to the ideas of Paul Gauguin and how they influenced his paintings. He also was an art critic for the Dutch Christian newspaper [[Trouw]]. He edited a 12-part [[Fontana Records]] series of black music, wrote a book on this subject and developed a Christian approach to art in a book aiming at a wide audience. On the political level he wrote about art and culture for the magazine of the Reformed party. By the mid '60's he was invited to start the department of art history at the [[Vrije Universiteit|Free University]]. His broad international perspective brought a large number of foreign students to the department at a time when this was still far from usual.

From 1955 onwards he frequently visited his friend [[Francis Schaeffer]] to lecture at the Swiss l’Abri community in Huémoz. He took Schaeffer on a tour to address Dutch audiences and started [[l'Abri]] meetings for university students in his Amsterdam home. He visited North America where he met his hero [[Mahalia Jackson]]. More and more Rookmaaker focused his career on motivating Christian believers to take culture seriously and live a life that integrates conviction and deeds. Traces of his influence are still to be found in many places, while the present awakening of [[Evangelicals]] to the arts &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gorski |first=Eric |url=http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2007/07/26/evangelicals_start_push_in_the_arts/?page=2 |title=Evangelicals start push in the arts |publisher=Boston.com |date=2007-07-26 |accessdate=2012-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; proves Rookmaaker's prophetic stand. Rookmaaker died suddenly on a Sunday in March 1977.

[[Hergé]] started drawing his comics series ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' in 1929 for ''[[Le Petit Vingtième]]'', the children's section of the [[Belgium|Belgian]] newspaper ''[[Le Vingtième Siècle]]'', run by the Abbé [[Norbert Wallez]], an avid supporter of [[social Catholicism]], a right-wing movement. During World War II, Tintin appeared in the [[Brussels]] daily pro-[[Nazi Germany|German]] ''[[Le Soir]]''; after the war he appeared in his own ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'' magazine (founded by a member of the [[Resistance during World War II|Resistance]], Raymond Leblanc) until Hergé's death in 1983.

As a young artist Hergé was influenced by his mentors, specifically the Abbé Wallez, who encouraged Hergé to use Tintin as a tool for [[Catholic]] [[propaganda]] to influence Belgian children. This shows in his earlier works within the Tintin series. As a result, [[Eurocentrism|European stereotypes]] pervade Hergé's early catalogue. A breakthrough came in 1934,  when the [[cartoonist]] was introduced to [[Zhang Chongren]], a [[China|Chinese]] student, who explained [[Politics of the Republic of China#Political history|Chinese politics]], [[Chinese culture|culture]], [[Chinese language|language]], [[Chinese art|art]], and [[Chinese philosophy|philosophy]] to him, which Hergé used to great effect in ''[[The Blue Lotus]]''. From this point onward, the artist developed ideologically, amidst the collapse of his country and the [[Second World War]], and so did the series: the general trend of the postwar stories is to become more [[progressivism|progressive]] and [[universalist]].

== First albums ==
The first Tintin book, ''[[Tintin in the Land of the Soviets]]'', was crafted on the orders of Hergé's superiors, to be anti-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] propaganda of limited outlook. Nonetheless, Hergé worked willingly: "I was sincerely convinced of being on the right path", he said later.  His only source was ''Moscou sans voiles'' ("Moscow without veils"), a book written in 1928 by [[Joseph Douillet]], former [[consul]] of [[Belgium]] in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. In this book, appearing not much more than a decade after the [[October Revolution]], Douillet denounced the communist system for producing [[poverty]], [[famine]], and [[state terrorism|terror]]. The [[secret police]] maintained order and the propaganda deceived foreigners. Nonetheless, the [[anti-totalitarian]] theme of this first book would persist throughout the series.

Hergé wanted the second book to take place in the [[United States]], which fascinated him. Wallez disagreed: he distrusted the USA, the country of [[Protestantism]], [[liberalism]], of easy money, and of [[gangsters]]. Instead, he asked Hergé to draw a book about the [[Belgian Congo]]: the colony needed white workers at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[[Benoît Peeters]], ''Tintin and the World of Hergé'', 1988, p. 29-30&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Tintin in the Congo]]'' reflected the dominant [[colonialist]] ideology at that time.  As put by Hergé in a later interview, "This was in 1930.  All I knew about the Congo was what people were saying about it at the time: 'The Negroes are big children, it's fortunate for them that we're there, etc'".&lt;ref&gt;[[Numa Sadoul]], ''Entretiens avec Hergé'', Casterman, 1989, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[paternalistic]] description of the [[indigenous people]] of [[Belgian Congo]] was more naive than [[racist]], and Hergé developed an important theme of Tintin in this book: international trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;[[Benoît Peeters]], ''Tintin and the World of Hergé'', 1988, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

==Turn-around from ''Tintin in America'' (1931–32) to ''The Black Island'' (1937–38)==
With his next book, Hergé could finally send Tintin to the United States. "[[Tintin in America]]" (1932) represents a significant change in tone. The story was, like the previous ones, very caricatured, because of Hergé's limited knowledge of the country: America was the land of [[Al Capone]], [[cowboy]]s and [[gigantism]]. But Hergé also took the defense of the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] (whom he called "Red Indians"), African Americans and blue-collar workers.  He criticized lynching, the theft of Native American land, and American business rapacity.

Even more striking is the fifth book, ''[[The Blue Lotus]]'' (1934–35), set in China.  For this story Hergé was put in touch with [[Zhang Chongren]], a Chinese student then studying in Brussels, whose name may have been the basis for the name of character Chang Chong-Chen. Hergé was very concerned with portraying the country accurately, and the adventure can be read as anti-[[imperialism|imperialist]]. It criticizes Japanese and Western involvement in China, including the international concessions and the Japanese invasion of [[Manchuria]], and shows with great disapproval Westerners making [[racism|racist]] or ignorant remarks about the Chinese. The Japanese themselves are portrayed with little sympathy; most of those shown are soldiers or government agents involved in the invasion of Manchuria.

''[[The Broken Ear]]'' (1935–36) is set mainly in the fictional South American republic of [[San Theodoros]] and takes a critical view of western businessmen conspiring to provoke a war over what they think will be profitable oil fields. They go about this using bribery, corruption, and the sale of arms to both sides. It then simply requires a border confrontation to be blown out of proportion in order to begin the conflict, much like the [[Mukden Incident]] shown in ''The Blue Lotus''. The war over the Grand Chapo oil plains was based on the [[Chaco War]] of the early 1930s. It also depicted the [[Shuar people|Shuar]] indigenous people, famous for their ''[[tsantsa]]s'' ("shrunken heads").

At first glance, ''[[The Black Island]]'' (1937–38) is a simple thriller with Tintin in pursuit of money [[Counterfeit|forgers]], with the chase to [[Scotland]] giving it a feel of [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s movie version of ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The Thirty-Nine Steps]]''. [[Dr. Müller]] is a German villain and can be read as a clear parody of the Germans at the time.

== The Second World War ==
Several stories were influenced by the menace of a second world war, and then by the war itself and the Nazi occupation of Belgium.

Despite the fact that Hergé was in favor of the neutrality of Belgium, ''[[King Ottokar's Sceptre]]'' (1938–39) could be read as anti-[[Nazism|Nazi]]: Müsstler (a possible contraction of ''Mussolini'' and ''Hitler'') is the leader of a conspiracy that seeks to merge the kingdom of [[Syldavia]] with its old enemy [[Borduria]].  The story could have been influenced by the [[Anschluss]] in Austria in 1938. Müsstler is the head of the Steel Guard, a name implying a pro-fascist paramilitary group which were common in Europe between the wars. An actual fascist and anti-Semitic group called the [[Iron Guard]] was very active in Romania in the years leading up to the Second World War. The Romanian Iron Guard was often in violent conflict with the King of Romania, King [[Carol II]], who they accused of corruption and being influenced by his Jewish mistress. The leader of the Iron Guard, [[Codreanu]], was executed shortly thereafter for treason by the Romanian government. The Iron Guard briefly formed the government in 1940 under [[Horia Sima]] after the King's abdication but Hitler ended up backing the more conservative General [[Antonescu]] in January 1941 and the Iron Guard was eliminated from government and purged. Thus, in the foreign policy of the Third Reich the Romanian monarchy and other authoritarian figures were supported over the local fascist party.

The early and unfinished version of ''[[Land of Black Gold]]'' (1939–40) alluded to the mobilization of Nazi war power. This unfinished adventure is set in the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] with British soldiers and officials. The beginning of the war and the defeat of Belgium prevented Hergé from finishing this version, though it did come out in 1950. He later rewrote it, setting the action in the fictional Arab Kingdom of [[Khemed]] and replacing the conflict between [[Arab]]s and Jews by a civil conflict between two Arab factions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Benoît Peeters]], ''Tintin and the World of Hergé'', 1988, p. 86-89&lt;/ref&gt;

During the war, Hergé worked for ''Le Soir'', a newspaper which collaborated with the German occupiers. To avoid controversy during the Nazi occupation of Belgium, Tintin's adventures now focused mainly on non-political issues such as drug smuggling (''[[The Crab with the Golden Claws]]''), intrigue and treasure hunts (''[[The Secret of the Unicorn]]'' and ''[[Red Rackham's Treasure]]''), and a mysterious curse (''[[The Seven Crystal Balls]]'').

Somewhat controversial though, was ''[[The Shooting Star]]'', which was about a race between two crews trying to reach a [[meteorite]] which had landed in the [[Arctic]].  Hergé chose the subject to be as fantastic as possible, to avoid trouble from the censors.  Nonetheless politics intruded in that the crew Tintin joined was composed of Europeans from Axis or neutral countries, while their underhanded rivals were Americans. Tintin also flies in a German plane in the book (an [[Arado Ar 196]]).

Most damaging of all for Hergé was that these stories were published in ''Le Soir'', a [[Collaborationism|collaborationist]] newspaper.  After the war he and other members of its staff faced lengthy investigations into their wartime allegiances.  Hergé expressed his regrets in a 1973 interview: ''"I recognise that I myself believed that the future of the West could depend on the New Order. For many, democracy had proved a disappointment, and the New Order brought new hope.  In light of everything which has happened, it is of course a huge error to have believed for an instant in the New Order"''.&lt;ref&gt;Haagse Post. March 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-war ==
The post-war stories are less controversial, developing several recurring themes:

* [[Humanism]] and [[anti-racism]] in ''[[The Castafiore Emerald]]'', which takes the side of the [[Romani people|Romani]]
* [[Totalitarianism]]: ''[[The Calculus Affair]]'' is anti-[[Stalinism|Stalinist]], but also shows the lengths to which both sides of the [[Cold War]] went to acquire [[weapons of mass destruction]]
* International trafficking and [[slavery]] in ''[[The Red Sea Sharks]]''
* [[Big Oil|Oil multinationals]] and their influence in ''[[Land of Black Gold]]'' (and previously in ''[[The Broken Ear]]'')
* Arms trade in ''The Red Sea Sharks'' and ''[[Flight 714 to Sydney]]''. [[Laszlo Carreidas]] in ''Flight 714 to Sydney'' is evidently based on French aircraft industrialist [[Marcel Dassault]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Benoît Peeters]], ''Tintin and the World of Hergé'', 1988, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; As Dassault was born Jewish, the album has been considered as anti-semitic by some, but there is no reference to the religion of Carreidas. In ''The Broken Ear'' (before the war), Hergé had already caricatured a real arms merchant, [[Basil Zaharoff]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Numa Sadoul]], ''Entretiens avec Hergé'', Casterman, 1989, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first edition of ''The Red Sea Sharks'', the black victims speak [[pidgin]] French and seem rather simple-minded. Hergé rewrote their dialogue in later editions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Benoît Peeters]], ''Tintin and the World of Hergé'', 1988, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

The last controversial album is ''[[Tintin and the Picaros]]'', which has been seen both as left-wing and right-wing. In it, Tintin goes through profound changes.  For the first time, Tintin seems to be flesh and blood, and perhaps even has weaknesses; for instance, he is at first uncharacteristically unwilling to travel to San Theodoros, where his friends have been falsely accused of espionage.  At the end he intervenes dramatically through revolution. But as [[Benoît Peeters]] puts it, "it is quite clear that this is no real revolution but a palace coup. Tapioca is backed by Borduria, Alcazar by the International Banana Company; as for ordinary people, they remain impoverished in the shantytowns."&lt;ref&gt;[[Benoît Peeters]], ''Tintin and the World of Hergé'', 1988, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genderism==
Hergé has also been accused of sexism, due to the almost complete lack of female characters in his books. The only woman character of importance is [[Bianca Castafiore]], who is portrayed to be foolish and nearly oblivious to all negative reactions to her behaviour—though she does show loyalty, presence of mind and quick wit when hiding Tintin and Haddock from [[Colonel Sponsz]] in ''[[The Calculus Affair]]''.

Hergé himself denied being a misogynist, saying that "for me, women have nothing to do in a world like Tintin's, which is the realm of male friendship".&lt;ref&gt;[[Numa Sadoul]], ''Entretiens avec Hergé'', Casterman, 1989, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

Other reasons were because he believed that sentimentality had little to do in Tintin's stories, which are mainly about men getting into all sorts of "misadventures rather than adventures", and wherein "mocking women would not be nice". He also felt that a man slipping on a banana skin, providing he does not break a leg, is much funnier than if it happened to a woman. As a female interviewer put it, "It has nothing to do with the [[misogynist]] world of the [[Boy Scout]],"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugL1NhFH0e8&amp;feature=related Interview with Hergé] available on youtube&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the fact that Hergé was a Scout in his youth.

==Tintin and the Jews==
Some aspects of Tintin's adventures have resulted in accusations of [[antisemitism]] being levelled at Hergé,&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.forward.com/bintel-blog/119123/ Hergé, Creator of Tintin: Antisemitism for all Ages], Benjamin Ivry, ''The Jewish Daily Forward,'' 17 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; accusations that are often connected to his work during World War II  for ''[[Le Soir]]'', a newspaper that collaborated with the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] during the German occupation of Belgium.

As the war began, the first version of ''[[Land of Black Gold]]'' (1939–40) was being published. This version was set in the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] and featured Jewish [[Zionism|Zionist]] terrorists led by a [[Rabbi]]. The story was suspended due to its political nature, but completed after the war.

[[File:Herge cartoon - Tintin and the Jews.jpg|thumb|right|Jews appearing in a scene in ''The Shooting Star'' which appeared in the original newspaper edition.&lt;br/&gt;
"Did you hear that, Isaac?... The end of the world!... What if it were true?..."&lt;br/&gt;
"Tee, hee!... Zat vould be a nice little teal, Salomon!... Ikh owe 50,000 Francs to my zurppliers... Zat vay ikh zould not have to pay..."]]

The most serious instance of alleged antisemitism, however, featured in ''[[The Shooting Star]]'' (1941), which appeared during the German occupation. In a scene that appeared in ''Le Soir'' on 11 November 1941, two evil-looking Jewish men, Isaac and Salomon, watch [[Philippulus the prophet]] inform Tintin that the end of the world is nigh. One of them, speaking in very twisted French, looks forward to this as it means that he will not be obliged to pay off his [[creditor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/stories/73/a7812173.shtml|author=Joris Goedbloed|title='The Shooting Star'|work=WW2 People's War|date=16 December 2005|accessdate=17 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Mr. Bohlwinkel|the sponsor of the rival expedition sent to find the meteorite]] is called Blumenstein, is given the appearance of a stereotypical Jewish businessman, and uses underhand and potentially lethal methods to delay Tintin's ship. His bank is located in New York and his crew attempts to plant the American flag on the meteorite.

After the war and the exposure of [[the Holocaust]], Jewish people became noticeably absent from Tintin's adventures. ''Land of Black Gold'' was redrawn at the request of Hergé's British publishers who felt that it was out-of-date now that the state of [[Israel]] had been established. The Irgun members in the British Mandate were replaced with a domestic insurgency in a fictional Arab emirate. The scene with Isaac and Salomon was left out of the book editions of ''The Shooting Star'', while "Blumenstein" was renamed "[[Mr. Bohlwinkel|Bohlwinkel]]" and relocated to the fictional country of [[São Rico]]. According to Hergé, both the original and the later name were honest mistakes:&lt;ref&gt;Tintin, Hergé &amp;amp; his creation, Thompson, 1991, {{ISBN|978-0-340-56462-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; he thought Blumenstein was a common American name, and chose Bohlwinkel because it sounded like "bollewinkel", a candy store.

Hugo Frey has argued that anti-Semitism continued in the post-war ''[[Flight 714 to Sydney]]''. Tintin's old nemesis and the mastermind of the plot in the book is the evil [[Rastapopoulos]], who Frey argues is an example of anti-Semitic caricature,&lt;ref&gt;Hugo Frey, "Trapped in the Past: Anti-Semitism in Hergé's Flight 714" in Mark McKinney, ed., ''History and Politics in French-Language Comics and Graphic Novels'' at p.31&lt;/ref&gt; though other writers argue against this, pointing out that Rastapopoulos is not Jewish (his surname make him likely of Greek ethnicity), and surrounds himself with explicitly German-looking characters: Kurt, the submarine commander of ''[[The Red Sea Sharks]]'', [[Dr. Krollspell]], whom Hergé himself referred to as a former concentration camp official, and Hans Boehm, the sinister-looking navigator and co-pilot, both from ''[[Flight 714 to Sydney]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Metamorphoses of Tintin: or Tintin for Adults'' by Jean-Marie Apostolidès, Jocelyn Hoy, published in 2009 by Stanford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

In other works, Hergé showed much sympathy for oppressed peoples, such as the Chinese in ''[[The Blue Lotus]]'', the black African Muslims about to be traded as slaves in ''[[The Red Sea Sharks]]'', and the [[Romani people|Gypsies]] of ''[[The Castafiore Emerald]]'' falsely accused of theft.

==Big business==
Much of Hergé's criticism was directed at [[big business]]es and the ways they would affect the lives of ethnic minorities and the affairs of nations just for the sake of money. He also accused them of using unethical methods and being a cover for criminal activities.

These attacks started as early as ''[[Tintin in America]]'' following the discovery of oil on land occupied by [[Blackfoot]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Natives]]. Tintin is then surrounded by businessmen offering him up to tens of thousands of dollars for the rights to the oil. When Tintin announces that it belongs to the Blackfoot, the chief of the tribe is, in comparison, given a mere $25 and half-an-hour to vacate the premises. An hour later the Blackfoot Natives are forced away by soldiers armed with rifles and bayonets; by the next day a whole city has been built on the site. A factory that Tintin later visits produces tinned "[[rabbit]]" meat out of stray [[cat]]s, [[dog]]s, and [[rat]]s.

Oil also came into play in ''[[The Broken Ear]]''. Western businesses General American Oil and British-South American Petrol get the states of [[San Theodoros]] and Nuevo Rico to go to war over territory which turns out not to have oil after all. This part of the story was inspired by the real-life [[Chaco War]] of 1932–35. One of the businessmen, [[R.W. Trickler]], uses [[bribery]], [[Police corruption|corruption]], and [[false evidence]] in order to get his way. Arms dealer Basil Bazarov, who sells weapons to both sides, is based on the real-life [[Basil Zaharoff]].

A similar situation occurred in ''[[Land of Black Gold]]'', in which two rival oil companies, Arabex and Skoil Petroleum, separately support [[Emir]] [[Mohammed Ben Kalish Ezab]] and [[Sheikh]] [[Bab El Ehr]] respectively.

Big business was also shown as a cover for illegal activities: [[Rastapopoulos]] for example is a respected businessman who mixes with people in high places, but is also the leader of major [[smuggling]] operations: [[opium]] in ''[[The Blue Lotus]]'' and [[Slavery|slaves]] in ''[[The Red Sea Sharks]]''. The villain in ''The Blue Lotus'' is [[Mitsuhirato]], a Japanese man who owns a fashion shop and an [[opium den]] (in a time and place where such dens were legal and considered legitimate), which cover his activities as a drug smuggler and [[secret agent]] of [[Japan]], and who organizes the sabotage of a Chinese railway (based on the real-life [[Mukden Incident]]). Rastapopoulos and Mitsuhirato have an Arabic counterpart in [[Omar ben Salaad]] of ''[[The Crab with the Golden Claws]]''.

The sponsor of the rival expedition in ''[[The Shooting Star]]'', [[Mr. Bohlwinkel]], is the head of a major banking organisation who uses unethical methods to delay the progress of Tintin and Haddock's ship. These include sabotage with [[dynamite]] and fake distress messages. Controversially, in his original version, Hergé gave the man a Jewish-sounding name and had him based in New York. These were changed in later editions.

Following the [[World War II|war]], Hergé's attacks on big business was suspended as he focused more on espionage (the [[Destination Moon (comics)|Moon adventures]] and ''[[The Calculus Affair]]''); but it returned with a vengeance in ''[[The Red Sea Sharks]]''. In this story Rastapopoulos becomes the Marquis di Gorgonzola, a [[media baron]], airline owner, and [[arms dealer]], who entertains influential people on board his luxury yacht. This serves as the cover of his business as a [[slave trader]]. When Emir Ben Kalish Ezab threatens to expose this for personal reasons, Rastapopoulos engineers his overthrow in favour of the Emir's enemy, Sheikh Bab El Ehr.

Tintin has a knack of meeting businessmen who appear friendly at first, but turn out to be far from ethical and can also be villains. Rastapopoulos and Mitsuhirato are two such examples; but there is also [[Laszlo Carreidas]] of ''[[Flight 714 to Sydney]]''. At first shown as a friendly if eccentric person, Carreidas was revealed to be a cunning individual with a long history of unscrupulous behaviour not limited to the business world. A large part of his personal fortune was in a [[Swiss bank]] account under a false name and signature, presumably for [[taxation]]-[[Tax evasion|related purposes]], while he confesses under [[truth serum]] to a long history of unscrupulous activities.

Hergé's attack on big business and its interference in national politics went all the way to the final completed story, ''[[Tintin and the Picaros]]''. In this adventure, [[guerrilla]] leader [[General Alcazar]] had the support of the International Banana Company, a reference to [[Banana republics]] and companies like the [[United Fruit Company]] (today [[Chiquita]]). Hergé's notes also reveal that Alcazar's wife was on the board of a company that kept him supplied with arms; a fact that may explain his marriage. To counter the rebels, Alcazar's enemy [[General Tapioca|Tapioca]] struck a deal with Loch Lomond whisky and parachuted large amounts of their brand into the jungle, making the rebels too drunk to stage a coup. Loch Lomond also sponsored the local carnival.

[[File:INOUE Tetsujiro.jpg|thumb|Inoue Tetsujirō.]]
{{nihongo|'''Inoue Tetsujirō'''|井上 哲次郎||February 1, 1855 – December 7, 1944}} was a Japanese [[philosopher]] who condemned [[Christianity]] as incompatible with [[Culture of Japan|Japanese culture]] and considered its followers "inherently disloyal" to Japan. He compiled {{nihongo4|''A Dictionary of Philosophy''|哲学字彙|Tetsugaku jii}}, which was first published in 1881, again in 1884, and finally in 1912.

He was also a member of the International Education Movement. He wrote a commentary on Japan's [[Imperial Rescript on Education]], wherein he encouraged the Japanese people to support the state and [[imperialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Dummings, William E. Education and Equality in Japan.  Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ; 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; Inoue's support of imperialism established him as opposed to the ideas of other proponents of International Education, such as [[Shimonaka Yasaburo]], [[Noguchi Entaro]], and [[Izumi Tetsu]].

Inoue was the most prolific and prominent promoter of [[bushido]] ideology in Japan before 1945, authoring dozens of works and giving hundreds of lectures on the subject over almost half a century.&lt;ref&gt;Oleg Benesch.

==Chinese poems==
After graduating from [[Tokyo Imperial University]] he composed Chinese poems, one of which inspired the composition of the poem [[White Aster (Japanese poem)|"White Aster"]] by [[Ochiai Naobumi]].

'''Ishq''' ({{lang-ar|عشق}}, ''‘išq'') is an Arabic word meaning "love" or "passion",&lt;ref name=EI2&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Arkoun, M.| year=1997 | title=ʿIs̲h̲ḳ|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam| edition=2nd|publisher=Brill |editors=P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs|volume=4|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; also widely used in other languages of the Muslim world. 

The word ''ishq'' does not appear in the Quran, which instead uses derivatives of the verbal root ''{{lang|ar-Latn|habba}}'' ({{lang|ar|حَبَّ}}), such as the noun ''{{lang|ar-Latn|hubb}}'' ({{lang|ar|حُبّ}}). The word is traditionally derived from the verbal root ''{{lang|ar-Latn|ʿašaq}}'' "to stick, to cleave to" and connected to the noun ''{{lang|ar-Latn|ʿašaqah}}'', which denotes a kind of ivy.&lt;ref name=Heydari-Malayeri/&gt; In its most common classical interpretation, ''ishq'' refers to the irresistible desire to obtain possession of the beloved (''ma‘shuq''), expressing a deficiency that the lover (''‘āshiq'') must remedy in order to reach perfection (''kamāl'').&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt; Like the perfections of the soul and the body, love thus admits of hierarchical degrees, but its underlying reality is the aspiration to the beauty (''al-husn'') which God manifested in the world when he created Adam in his own image.&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt; Islamic conception of love acquired further dimensions from the Greek-influenced view that the notions of Beauty, Good, and Truth (''al-haqq'') "go back to one indissoluble Unity (''wahda'')".&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt; 

Among classical Muslim authors, the notion of love was developed along three conceptual lines, conceived in an accending hierarchical order: natural love, intellectual love and divine love.&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt; The growth of affection (''mawadda'') into passionate love (''ishq'') received its most probing and realistic analysis in ''[[The Ring of the Dove]]'' by the Andalusian scholar [[Ibn Hazm]].&lt;ref name="EI2" /&gt; The term ''ishq'' is used extensively in Sufi poetry and literature to describe their selfless and 'burning love for Allah'. It is the core concept in the doctrine of [[Sufism|Islamic mysticism]] as it is the key to the connection between man and God. Ishq itself is held to have been the basis of 'creation'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mohammad Najib ur Rehman|first1=Hazrat Sakhi Sultan|title=Day of Alast-The start of creation|publisher=Sultan ul Faqr Publications Regd.|isbn=9789699795084|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wZ1kAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT8&amp;dq=haqeeqat+e+mohammadia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=haqeeqat%20e%20mohammadia&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

Traditional Persian lexicographers considered the Persian ''{{lang|fa-Latn|ešq}}'' and Arabic ''{{lang|ar-Latn|ʿišq}}'' ({{lang|ar|عشق}}) to derive from the Arabic verbal root ''{{lang|ar-Latn|ʿašaq}}'' ({{lang|ar|عَشَق}}) "to stick, to cleave to". They connected the origin of the root to ''{{lang|ar-Latn|ʿašaqa}}'' ({{lang|ar|عَشَقَه}}), a kind of ivy, because it twines around and cleaves to trees (Zamaxšari, Tâj al-'arus).&lt;ref name=Heydari-Malayeri/&gt;

Heydari-Malayeri suggests that (''{{lang|ar-Latn|ʿišq}}'') may have an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] origin and may be related to [[Avestan]] words such as ''{{lang|ae|iš-}}'' "to wish, desire, search", and ultimately derive from *iška. The Avestan ''{{lang|ae|iš-}}'' also exists in [[Middle Persian]] in the form of ''{{lang|pal-Latn|išt}}'' "desire".&lt;ref name=Heydari-Malayeri&gt;M. Heydari-Malayeri [http://aramis.obspm.fr/~heydari/dictionary/esq_eng.html On the origin of the word ešq ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a word in different languages==

In the most languages such as [[Dari language|Dari]]: ''eshq''; in {{lang-ps|eshq}}; in [[Somali language|Somali]]: ''{{lang|so|caashaq}}'' or ''{{lang|so|cishqi}}''; in {{lang-tr|aşk}} and in {{lang-az|eşq}}, in modern [[Persian language|Persian]] as ''{{lang|fa-Latn|ešq}}'' or ''{{lang|fa-Latn|eshgh}}'' {{lang|fa|عشق}}, it literally means "love".&lt;ref name=Heydari-Malayeri/&gt;

Some scholars objected to the use of the term 'ishq' due to its association with sensual love but despite the linguistic, cultural or technical meanings, Sufis believe that 'ishq' can only be associated to the Divine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ghazzali |first1=Aaron Spevack, Fethullah Gülen |title=Ghazali on the Principles of Islamic Spirituality: Selections from the Forty Foundations of Religion Annotated &amp; Explained |publisher=SkyLight Paths Publishing |isbn=9781594732843 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=09oeRfRDFo8C&amp;pg=PA268&amp;dq=ishq+meaning&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwBGoVChMIsMCQgseIyAIVhtoaCh0OiwfF#v=onepage&amp;q=ishq%20meaning&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ishq referred to traditional ghazals and Indo-Persian literary culture&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ghazalpage.net/prose/notes/ghazal_notes.html Ghazal Notes: Ishq]&lt;/ref&gt; and has made its way to many other languages which were influenced by Sufism. Some of the most notable languages which have this word are [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Urdu]], [[Pashto]], [[Arabic]], [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], [[Saraiki language|Saraiki]]: عشق, {{lang-tr|aşk}}, {{lang-az|eşq}}, {{lang-bn|ইশক}} and {{lang-pa|ਇਸ਼ਕ}}.

In Persian, Ishq construed with the verbs "bākhtan باختن", "khāstan خواستن", "sanjīdan سنجیدن", "rūīdan روییدن", "nishīndan نشاندن", etc.&lt;ref&gt;STEINGAS, Francis Joseph. A Comprehensive Persian-English Dictionary, ''عشق'', Asian Educational Services, 1992, page 850.&lt;/ref&gt; In Persian, "Āshiq عاشق" is the active participle (lover), "Mā'shūq معشوق" is the passive participle (beloved), and "Mā'shūqah معشوقه" conveys a vulgar meaning, whilst in Arabic it is the female passive participle of "Mā'shūq معشوق".

In Urdu, ''Ishq'' ('''عشق''') is used to refer to ''fervent love'' for any object, person or God. However, it is mostly used in its religious context. In Urdu, three very common religious terminologies have been derived from ''Ishq''. These terminologies are ''Ishq-e-Haqīqi'' (love of Truth), ''Ishq-e majāzi'' (love of God's creation i.e. a [[human]]), and ''ishq-e rasūl'' / ''ishq-e Muhammadi'' (love of the Messenger / love of [[Muhammad]]). Other than these, in non-religious context, ''‘ishq'' is a synonym for obsessive love.

In Turkish, ''Aşk'' is commonly used to express love, passion or adoration. The Turkish version replaces the 'q' with a 'k', as Turkish lacks [[voiceless uvular plosive]], and the letter 'ş' with the [[cedilla]] denotes the "sh" sound, {{IPAslink|ʃ}}. In comparison with [[Arabic]] or [[Urdu]], (like Persian) the word is less restrictive and can be applied to many forms of love, or simply romance. It is common in the lyrics of Turkish songs.

Ishq is also sometimes used in [[Hindi]] language movies which often borrow more formal, flowery and poetic words and language heavily from Urdu and Persian. The regular Hindi word for love is ''pyar''. In [[Bollywood]] ''{{transl|sem|ʻIshq'}}'' (इश्क़) means ''[[platonic love|lustless love]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ghazalpage.net/prose/notes/ghazal_notes.html Ghazal Notes: Ishq]&lt;/ref&gt; In Arabic, it is a noun. However, in Urdu it is used as both verb and noun.

In Modern Arabic the usual terms used for romantic love are ''{{lang|ar-Latn|habba}}'' and its derived forms ''{{lang|ar-Latn|hubb, habib, mahbub}}'', etc.&lt;ref&gt;M. Heydari-Malayeri [http://aramis.obspm.fr/~heydari/dictionary/esq_eng.html On the origin of the word ešq ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Sufism==
In religious context, Ishq, divided into three kinds, is a very important but rather complex concept of Sufi tradition of [[Islam]].

===Ishq-e Majāzi===
''Ishq-e Majāzi'' ({{lang-fa|عشق مجازی}}) literally means "metaphorical love". It refers to the love for God's creation i.e. love of a man for a woman or another man and vice versa. It is said to be generated by beloved person's external beauty but since it is connected to lust, it is against the [[Tariqa|law]] and considered unlawful. Hence, in [[Faqr]], the term Ishq-e-Majazi is directed only towards Ishq-e-Murshid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mohammad Najib ur Rehman|first1=Hazrat Sakhi Sultan|title=Ishq-e-Majazi (Metaphorical Love)|publisher=Sultan ul Faqr Publications Regd.|isbn=9789699795183|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hlyMAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA243&amp;dq=ishq+e+majazi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwAGoVChMI-qCSrdmUyAIVA1IUCh2MIwtB#v=onepage&amp;q=ishq%20e%20majazi&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This love for one's [[Murshid]] eventually leads to love for [[Muhammad]] and eventually for God, upon which one that understands Ishq-e-Haqeeqi is in fact the source of all 'metaphorical love'.

===Ishq-e Rasūl or Ishq-e Muhammadi===
''Ishq-e Rasūl'' ({{lang-fa|عشق رسول}}) means "love of Muhammad," an important part of being a Muslim. In Sufism, however, the Ishq-e-Majazi changes its form to Ishq-e-Rasool and the intense feeling of Ihsq is developed for [[Muhammad]]. Everything form of creation which exists is in fact the slave of the Creator. Since [[Muhammad]] is the most beloved to Allah, the true Lover feels Ishq-e-Rasool till "the Prophet becomes dearer to him than his life, wives, children, house, business and everything else". (Sahih Bukhari and Muslim)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Muslim|first1=Bukhari|title=Hadith of Hazrat Mohammad pbuh|url=http://www.virtualmosque.com/islam-studies/prophet-muhammad/loving-the-messenger-%EF%B7%BA-peace-be-upon-him-above-all-else/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Sufis firmly believe that the souls of the entire creation were created from the soul of [[Muhammad]]. Hence, the purified soul of the Lover craves to return to him. This is experienced at the level where the Lover witness the reflection of all the attributes of God within [[Muhammad]].

===Ishq-e Haqeeqi===
''Ishq-e Haqīqi'' ({{lang-fa|عشق حقیقی}}) literally means ''[[Divine Love|"the real love" i.e. "the love of God"]].'' It refers to the belief that only God is worth loving and He is the only one who can return His creature's love for Him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mohammad Najib ur Rehman|first1=Hazrat Sakhi Sultan|title=Ishq-e-Haqeeqi (Divine Love)|publisher=Sultan ul Faqr Publications Regd.|isbn=9789699795183|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hlyMAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA230&amp;dq=ishq+meaning&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=ishq%20meaning&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The inner subtlety whose locus is the heart is only felt by the true seeker of God otherwise there is no difference between a beast and a man because even a beast has five senses whereas the sixth i.e. the inner sight is only additional to the human.

''"And those who truly believe, love Allah intensely."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=7 Renowned Translations|first1=Arabic to English Translation|title=Al Baqarah (The Cow) 165|url=http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=2&amp;verse=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Al-Bakra 165)

'''Jacob Friedrich von Abel''' (9 May 1751 – 7 July 1829) was a [[Germany|German]] [[philosopher]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Friedrich Abel: Karlsschul-Schriften. Eine ...&lt;/ref&gt;  His main interest was the human [[soul]] and in trying to find a proof for its [[immortality]].

Born in [[Vaihingen an der Enz]], von Abel studied philology, philosophy and theology in the lower [[seminary|seminaries]] in [[Denkendorf, Baden-Württemberg|Denkendorf]] and [[Maulbronn]] and in the higher seminary in [[Tübingen]]. He graduated in 1770 and was appointed professor of philosophy at the ''Militär-Pflanzschule'' at the [[Castle Solitude|Solitude Palace]] which moved later to [[Stuttgart]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=43321159480157 Secret Societies and Weimar Classicism] - scholarly essay discusses "Stuttgart professor Jacob Friedrich Abel, who was also an Illuminati member"&lt;/ref&gt; While there, he was one of [[Schiller]]'s teachers and a good friend (becoming the dedicatee of his second play, ''[[Fiesco (play)|Fiesco]]'').

In 1790 he was appointed professor of philosophy and headmaster of the ''Contubernium'' in [[Tübingen]], in 1792 pedagogue of the Latin ''Schulen ob der Staig''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conspiracyarchive.com/NWO/Illuminati.htm A Metaprogrammer at the Door of Chapel Perilous]&lt;/ref&gt; Notably during this period, he adopted renowned German idealist [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] as his protege, according to Hegel's sister. It is also known that Abel's short book in defence of traditional rational metaphysics against Kant's arguments, was one of the first pieces of literature on [[Kantianism]] which Hegel was exposed to&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=GHWJQhWRNy0C&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=Jacob+Friederich+von+abel+and+hegel&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kS2VyZtYf7&amp;sig=hpGbBp6tEgeF3eyXAok5z6mADtE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwijlN-QgLzeAhUKd94KHWXBDKMQ6AEwAnoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Jacob%20Friederich%20von%20abel%20and%20hegel&amp;f=false|title=Hegel: A Biography|last=Pinkard|first=Terry|date=2001-06-18|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521003872|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  In 1811 Abel became [[prelate]], general superintendent in [[Oehringen]] and member of the executive authority of the Evangelic Church in [[Württemberg]]. In 1823 von Abel became general superintendent in [[Bad Urach|Urach]] and [[Reutlingen]], and lived in [[Stuttgart]]. He died on a leisure excursion in [[Schorndorf]].

Jacob Friedrich von Abel was also a member of the [[Illuminatenorden]], known as ''Pythagoras Abderites''.

'''Judicial interference''' is the actions of [[courts]] or [[judicial officer]]s in matters that are interpreted by some as beyond their [[constitution]]ally established role. &lt;!-- I believe I have that constitutional part correct; if not, it demonstrates the original author's need to have been more accurate/complete in his description. --&gt;

'''Konstantin Petrovich Pobedonostsev''' ({{lang-rus|Константи́н Петро́вич Победоно́сцев|p=kənstɐnˈtʲin pʲɪˈtrovʲɪtɕ pəbʲɪdɐˈnostsɨf}}; May 21, 1827, [[Moscow]] – March 23, 1907, [[Saint Petersburg]]) was a [[Russian Empire|Russian]] jurist, statesman, and adviser to three [[Tsar]]s. He was the chief spokesman for reactionary positions. He was the "[[éminence grise]]" of imperial politics during the reign of [[Alexander III of Russia]], holding the position of the [[Ober-Procurator]] of the [[Most Holy Synod]], the non-clerical official who supervised the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].

His writings on politics, law, art, and culture emphasized the positive element of the spiritual and secular unification of Russia with the acceptance of Christianity. He warned of the negative element in Russia, portraying democratic and liberal movements as enemies of the national and religious unity of Russian people. Achieving a harmonious society, said Pobedonostsev, meant there was a collective responsibility to uphold political and religious unity, hence close supervision of Russian behaviour and thinking was a necessity.&lt;ref&gt;John Basil, "K.P Pobedonostsev and the Harmonius Society". ''Canadian-American Slavic Studies'' 37.4 (2003): 415-426.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Pobedonostsev's father, Pyotr Vasilyevich Pobedonostsev, was a Professor of [[literature]] at [[Moscow State University]]. In 1841 he placed his son, then aged 14, in the St. Petersburg [[School of Jurisprudence]], which had been established to prepare young men for civil service. After graduation Konstantin Pobedonostsev entered the public service as an official in the eighth Moscow department of the Senate. The task of the department was to resolve civil cases from [[guberniya]]s surrounding Moscow. He was promoted rapidly within the eighth department.

From 1860 to 1865 he was Professor of civil law at [[Moscow State University]]. In 1861 Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] invited him to instruct his son and heir, [[Nicholas Alexandrovich, Tsesarevich of Russia|Nicholas]], in the theory of law and administration. In 1865 young Nicholas died, and Pobedonostsev was invited to teach Nicholas's brother Alexander (the future Tsar [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]]). In 1866 Pobedonostsev moved to a permanent residence in St. Petersburg. Pobedonostsev and Tsarevich Alexander remained very close for almost thirty years, through Alexander's ascension as Tsar in 1881 and until his death in 1894.

He became a member of the [[State Council of Imperial Russia|Council of the Empire]], and in 1880 – [[chief procurator]] of the [[Holy Synod]]. In the latter office Pobedonostsev was operating head of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. During the reign of Alexander III he was one of the most influential men in the empire. He was the mastermind of [[Manifesto on Unshakable Autocracy|Alexander's Manifesto]] of April 29, 1881. The Manifesto on Unshakeable Autocracy proclaimed that the [[Tsarist autocracy|absolute power]] of the Tsar was unshakable thus putting an end to [[Mikhail Tarielovich Loris-Melikov|Loris-Melikov]]'s endeavours to establish a representative body in the empire.

Actually, Pobedonostsev's ascension in the first days after the assassination of Alexander II resulted in the subsequent resignation of Loris-Melikov and other ministers eager for liberal reforms. He always was an uncompromising conservative and never shrank from boldly expressing his staunch opinions. Consequently, in liberal circles he was always denounced as an [[obscurantist]], pedant, and an enemy of progress.

After the death of Alexander III, he lost much of his influence. Tsar Nicholas II adhered to his father's Russification policy and even extending it to [[Russification of Finland|Finland]], but he generally disliked the idea of systematic religious persecution, and was not wholly averse to the partial emancipation of the Church from civil control.
[[File:Konstantin Pobedonostsev grave.jpg|thumb|200 px|Konstantin Pobedonostsev grave]] In 1901, Nikolai Lagovski, a socialist, tried to kill Pobedonostsev, shooting through the window of Pobedonostsev's office, but missing. Lagovski was sentenced to 6 years of [[katorga]].

He ordered [[Tolstoy]]'s [[excommunication]] in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p_wsH5m7NesC|title=My Life|last=Толстая|first=Софья Андреевна|date=2011-02-04|publisher=University of Ottawa Press|isbn=9780776619224|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Russian revolution of 1905|revolutionary tumult]] which followed the disastrous [[Russo-Japanese War|war with Japan]], Pobedonostsev, being nearly 80 years of age, retired from public affairs. He died on March 23, 1907.

He was fictionalized as old senator Ableukhov in [[Andrey Bely]]'s novel ''[[Petersburg (novel)|Petersburg]]'' (1912). Arguably he was also depicted in [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[Anna Karenina]]'' as Alexei Alexandrovich Karenin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arsenalband.ru/now169.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720020800/http://www.arsenalband.ru/now169.php |archivedate=2011-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jurisprudence==
Though Pobedonostsev is mostly known as a statesman and thinker, his contribution to Russian [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] is significant. He is generally regarded as one of the most educated European jurists of the 19th century. His main work was the three-volume "Course of Civil Law" (Курс гражданского права) published in 1868, 1871 and 1880, respectively.

Before the 1905 "[[The First Revolution]]" the Course was reprinted several times with minor changes. The Course was regarded as outstanding guide for practising lawyers. Quotations from the Course are reported to have been used as a ground for decisions of the Civil Board of the Senate. The author's profound knowledge of Russian civil law resulted in description of many previously insufficiently explored institutions such as communal land law.

In addition, Pobedonostsev published in 1865 in ''[[Moskovskie Vedomosti]]'' several anonymous articles on the [[judicial reform of Alexander II]].

==Doctrines and policies==
[[File:pobedonostsev by repin.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Pobedonostsev was known for his gaunt figure and pale, corpse-like countenance, as one may judge from this portrait by [[Ilya Repin]].]]

Pobedonostsev held the view that human nature is sinful, rejecting the ideals of freedom and independence as dangerous delusions of nihilistic youth.

In his "Reflections of a Russian Statesman" (1896),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EhQUAAAAIAAJ|title=Reflections of a Russian Statesman|last=Pobedonost͡sev|first=Konstantin Petrovich|date=1898-01-01|publisher=G. Richards|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; he promoted autocracy and condemned elections, representation and democracy, the jury system, the press, free education, charities, and social reforms. He despised representative government, and denounced the notion of an all-Russian Parliament. He also condemned [[Social Darwinism]] as an erroneous generalisation of Darwin's Theory of Evolution.

In the early years of the reign of Alexander II, Pobedonostsev maintained, though keeping aloof from the [[Slavophile]]s, that Western institutions were radically bad in themselves and totally inapplicable to Russia since they had no roots in Russian history and culture and did not correspond to the spirit of Russian people. In that period, he contributed several papers to [[Alexander Herzen]]'s radical periodical ''Voices from Russia''.

He denounced democracy as "the insupportable dictatorship of vulgar crowd". He argued that parliaments, trial by jury, freedom of the press, and secular education were undesirable alien nostrums. He subjected all of them to a severe analysis in his ''Reflections of a Russian Statesman''. He once stated that Russia should be "frozen in time", showing his undivided commitment to autocracy.

To these dangerous products of Western thought he found a counterpoise in popular ''vis inertiae'', and in the respect of the masses for institutions developed slowly and automatically during the past centuries of national life. In his view, human society evolves naturally, just like a tree grows. Human mind is not able to perceive the logic of social development. Any attempt to reform society is a violence and a crime. Among the practical deductions drawn from these premises is the necessity of preserving autocratic power, and of fostering among the people the traditional veneration for the ritual of the national Church.

In the sphere of practical politics Pobedonostsev exercised considerable influence in the [[Russification]] policy of Alexander III. This found expression in nationalist propaganda.

===Antisemitism===
Pobedonostsev particularly advised the anti-Jewish measures taken during Alexander III's administration. These began with the temporary "[[May Laws]]" that banned Jews from rural areas and [[shtetl]]s even within the [[Pale of Settlement]]. The May Laws did not lapse; further policies led to deportations of Jews from large cities, enrollment quotas in public education, and a proscription against voting in local elections.

His anti-Jewish measures, at least, may have stemmed from a personal motive. British author Arnold White, interested in Jewish agricultural colonisation in [[Argentina]], visited Pobedonostsev with credentials from [[Maurice de Hirsch|Baron de Hirsch]]; Pobedonostsev said to him: "The characteristics of the Jewish race are parasitic; for their sustenance they require the presence of another race as "host" although they remain aloof and self-contained. Take them from the living organism, put them on a rock, and they die. They cannot cultivate the soil."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author =Arnold White | url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/NorthAmericanRev-1904jan-00010 | title=The Jewish Question: How to Solve It | journal=The North American Review|volume= 178|number= 566 |date=Jan 1904 | pages= 10–24}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also by 1894 credited (dubiously)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=John D.

===Church policies===
Pobedonostsev was not always a reactionary. He had originally welcomed the Great Reforms that Tsar Alexander II undertook in the 1860s-1870s.&lt;ref&gt;W. Bruce Lincoln, ''The great reforms: Autocracy, bureaucracy, and the politics of change in imperial Russia'' (1990)&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, he soon became alarmed by the weakening of the rural estates and the tsarist bureaucracy. He decided that a deeper spiritual unity of the tsar and his people was needed to restore stability to Russia. When Alexander III ascended the throne in 1881, Pobedonostsev rapidly gained a powerful influence over the affairs of both church and state. To establish order he suppressed all reform efforts. The reforms of the 1860s had legalized the role of Protestant and other non-Orthodox religions. Pobedonostsev said Russia needed an Orthodox monopoly. However, he failed to win over the civil authorities, the judicial authorities, and the religious department in his struggle against the non-Orthodox. As a result, his policies, which were intended to unify, actually engendered dissension and violence and in the long run contributed to the collapse of the Russian Empire.&lt;ref&gt;A. Iu. Polunov, "The State and Religious Heterodoxy in Russia (from 1880 to the Beginning of the 1890s)". ''Russian Studies in History'' 39.4 (2001): 54-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pobedonostsev did develop a social program for the Church while limiting its autonomy. He imposed repressive measures against the non-Orthodox. He carried out major Church reforms, but they resulted in a church that by 1900 was enmeshed in bureaucracy, alienated in many ways from society, resentful of secular authorities, and divided internally. Stagnation in church and state policies prevailed until Pobedonostsev retired in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;A. Iu. Polunov, "Church, Regime, and Society in Russia (1880-1895)". ''Russian Studies in History'' 39.4 (2001): 33-53.&lt;/ref&gt; In the long run, argues Polunov, Pobedonostsev's attempts to impose safe conservative barriers to reform and his hostility toward innovation served only to weaken the autocratic state from within.&lt;ref&gt;A. Iu. Polunov, "Konstantin Petrovich Pobedonostsev—Man and Politician". ''Russian Studies in History'' 39.4 (2001): 8-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4869">'''Lars Svenonius''' (1927, [[Skellefteå]] – September 27, 2010, [[Silver Spring, Maryland]]) was a Swedish [[logician]] and [[philosopher]]. 

He was a visiting professor at University of California at Berkeley in 1962-63, then held a position at the University of Chicago from 1963–69, and was professor of philosophy at the [[University of Maryland]] from 1969 to 2009. He retired in 2009, but was awarded the position of Emeritus Professor, and continued to teach courses and advise students until his death at 83 years of age.

He was the first Swedish logician to work on [[model theory]] with his dissertation ''Some problems in Model Theory'' (for which the University of Uppsala awarded him a doctorate in 1960). His early work was in formal logic, and he established a reputation for brilliance early in his career with a series of proofs, including an independent proof of [[Omega-categorical theory|equivalent characterizations of omega-categorical theories]]. A 1959 paper of his in ''[[Theoria (philosophy journal)|Theoria]]'' establishes what is still referred to as the 'Svenonius theorem' on decidability. One of his proponents in Sweden was [[Per Lindström]].&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook of world philosophy'' by John Roy Burr, 1980. {{ISBN|0-313-22381-5}} (page 186)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Lars Svenonius' early work  was in the field of logic known as model theory, in which properties of the interpretations ("models") of theories are studied. This field was the object of intense study and saw great progress in the 1950s, largely due to the work of [[Alfred Tarski]] and his students at the University of California, Berkeley. At the same time it became much more mathematical, both in techniques and in the concepts used. Svenonius' work was of the modern mathematical
variety.

Svenonius' reputation as a mathematical model theorist was established with the publication of three papers in Theoria in 1959 and 1960:

# &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;-categoricity in first-order predicate calculus,
# A theorem on permutations in models,
# On minimal models of first-order systems.

In particular, paper (2) contains what is now called "Svenonius' Theorem", an important result on definability of predicates in first order theories. Even the statement of this result requires mathematical model-theoretic concepts. It states that if the interpretation of a predicate in any model of a first-order theory is invariant under permutations ("automorphisms") of the model fixing the other predicates, then the interpretation of that predicate is definable in every model by a formula involving only the other predicates; furthermore only finitely many such defining formulas are required. Beth's earlier [[Beth definability|definability theorem]] is a consequence of Svenonius' Theorem.

The other two papers include a characterization of theories having only one countable model, obtained also by the Polish logician [[Czesław Ryll-Nardzewski]], and results on prime models, obtained also by [[Robert Vaught]] at Berkeley. All of these results are classics of modern model theory.

Presumably as a result of these papers he was named a Visiting Associate Professor at The University of California, Berkeley, for 1962-1963, and gave an Invited Address at the International Symposium on the Theory of Models held there in 1963. His address was published in the Conference Proceedings (The Theory of Models, North-Holland Publishing Co., 1965) as "On the denumerable models of theories with extra predicates", pp 376–389. In this paper he characterizes the countable ("denumerable") structures  which can be made into models of a theory by adding interpretations of the extra predicates used in defining the theory. His characterization involves (infinite) expressions beginning with an infinite sequence of alternating quantifiers. Such expressions are now interpreted using infinite
two-person games. The importance of this work was only realized after it was rediscovered and extended by Robert Vaught in his work on [[descriptive set theory]] and [[infinitary logic]]s. Svenonius' role is well recognized, for example, by [[Wilfrid Hodges]] who defines "Svenonius games" and "Svenonius sentences" in his encyclopedic treatise Model Theory (Cambridge University Press, 1993).

[[File:Little Albert experiment (1920).webm|250px|thumb|thumbtime=192|The film of the experiment]]
The '''Little Albert experiment''' was a [[controlled experiment]] showing  [[empirical]] [[evidence]] of [[classical conditioning]] in humans. The study also provides an example of [[Taste aversion#Stimulus generalization|stimulus generalization]].  It was carried out by [[John B. Watson]] and his graduate student, [[Rosalie Rayner]], at [[Johns Hopkins University]].  The results were first published in the February 1920 issue of the ''[[Journal of Experimental Psychology]]''.

After observing children in the field, Watson hypothesized that the fearful response of children to loud noises is an innate unconditioned response.  He wanted to test the notion that by following the principles of the procedure now known as "classical conditioning", he could use this unconditioned response to condition a child to fear a distinctive stimulus that normally would not be feared by a child (in this case, furry objects).

==Method==
The aim of Watson and Rayner was to condition a [[phobia]] in an emotionally stable child.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, G. (2009). ''AS &amp; A Level Psychology Through Diagrams'', pg 27.&lt;/ref&gt; For this study they chose a nine-month old infant from a hospital referred to as "Albert" for the experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Watson &amp; Rayner, 1920, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  Watson followed the procedures which Pavlov had used in his experiments with dogs.&lt;ref&gt;''Anyone—Regardless of Their Nature—Can Be Trained to Be Anything''; Watson, John B.; "Big Ideas Simply Explained: The Psychology Book." London: Dorling Kindersley Publishing, Inc., 2012; Credo web reference-Subscription Required; accessed September 23, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the experiment, Albert was given a battery of baseline emotional tests: the infant was exposed, briefly and for the first time, to a white rat, a rabbit, a dog, a monkey, masks (with and without hair), cotton, wool, burning newspapers, and other [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]].  Albert showed no fear of any of these items during the baseline tests.

For the experiment proper, Albert was put on a mattress on a table in the middle of a room.  A white laboratory rat was placed near Albert and he was allowed to play with it.  At this point, Watson and Rayner made a loud sound behind Albert's back by striking a suspended steel bar with a hammer each time the baby touched the rat.  Albert responded to the noise by crying and showing fear.  After several such pairings of the two stimuli, Albert was presented with only the rat.  Upon seeing the rat, Albert got very distressed, crying and crawling away.  Apparently, the infant associated the white rat with the noise.  The rat, originally a [[neutral stimulus]], had become a conditioned stimulus, and it was eliciting an emotional response (conditioned response) similar to the distress (unconditioned response) originally given to the noise (unconditioned stimulus).&lt;ref name = Schwartz&gt;Steven Schwartz; ''Classic Studies in Psychology;'' Palo Alto: Mayfield Publishing,1986; print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In further experiments, Little Albert seemed to [[generalize]] his response to the white rat. He became distressed at the sight of several other furry objects, such as a rabbit, a furry dog, and a seal-skin coat, and even a [[Santa Claus]] mask with white cotton balls in the beard.  However, this stimulus generalization did not extend to everything with hair.&lt;ref name = Schwartz/&gt;

It should be noted that Watson's experiment had many failings by modern standards. For example, it had only a single subject and no [[control variable|control subjects]].  Furthermore, such an experiment could be hard to conduct in compliance with current law and regulations, given the expected risks to the subject.

==Subsequent events==

Albert was about one year old at the end of the experiment, and he reportedly left the hospital shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, pg 177.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Watson had discussed what might be done to remove Albert's conditioned fears, he had no time to attempt such desensitization with Albert, and it is likely that the infant's fear of furry things continued post-experimentally.&lt;ref&gt;(Harris, 1979).&lt;/ref&gt;

Watson later gave a series of weekend lectures describing the Little Albert study. One of these lectures was attended by [[Mary Cover Jones]], which sparked her interest in pursuing graduate work in psychology. Jones conducted an experiment to figure out how to eliminate fear responses in children and studied a boy named Peter, who was two years old. Peter shared similar fears of white rabbits and furry objects to Little Albert.  Jones was able to increase Peter's tolerance of white rabbits by exposing him to the animal, known as direct conditioning, and having Peter interact with children who were not afraid of the rabbit. Mary Cover Jones was the first psychologist to desensitize or uncondition a fear response and become known as the "Mother of Behavior Therapy". &lt;ref&gt;Rutherford, Alexandra. "Mary Cover Jones". Psychology's Feminist Voices, www.feministvoices.com/mary-cover-jones/.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identifying Little Albert==
According to some textbooks, Albert's mother worked in the same building as Watson and didn't know the tests were being conducted.  When she found out, she took Albert and moved away, letting no one know where they were going.  A 2009 report, however, disputes that.&lt;ref name="Beck2"&gt;H. P.; Levinson, S., &amp; Irons, G.; 2009; pp.605–614"&lt;/ref&gt;  The original report had stated that the baby's mother was a [[wet nurse]] at the hospital, who may have felt coerced and unable to turn down a request for her baby to be used in Watson's experiment.

===Douglas Merritte===
In 2009, psychologists Hall P. Beck and Sharman Levinson published an article in which they claimed to have discovered the true identity of "Albert B."&lt;ref name="Beck, H. P., Levinson, S., &amp; Irons, G. 2009 605–614"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Beck, H. P., Levinson, S., &amp; Irons, G.| year=2009| title=Finding Little Albert: A journey to John B. Watson's infant laboratory| journal=American Psychologist |volume=64 |issue=7 |pages=605–614 | doi=10.1037/a0017234 | pmid=19824748}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After reviewing Watson's correspondence and publications, as well as research in public documents (such as the [[1920 United States Census]] and state birth and death records), Beck argued that "Albert B." was a pseudonym for Douglas Merritte, the son of Arvilla Merritte, then a woman who appears to have been a wet nurse at the Harriet Lane Home.&lt;ref name="Beck, H. P., Levinson, S., &amp; Irons, G. 2009 605–614"/&gt;  Recent research has shown, however, that Douglas Merritte may not have been "Little Albert",&lt;ref name="Correcting"&gt;{{cite journal |last2=Digdon |first2=Nancy |last=Powell |first=Russell A.|last3=Harris |first3=Christopher |last4=Smithson |first4=Ben| date=2014 |title=Correcting the record on Watson, Rayner, and Little Albert: Albert Barger as "Psychology’s lost boy" |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/amp/69/6/600.html |journal=American Psychologist |publisher=American Psychological Association |volume=69 |issue=6 |pages=600–611 |doi=10.1037/a0036854 |access-date=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; who may in fact have been young William Barger.

===William Barger===
The identity claimed by Beck, Levinson, and Irons has been contested by psychology researchers, Russ Powell and Nancy Digdon, as well as Watson scholar, Ben Harris, who offer an alternative identity based on available data.&lt;ref name="Correcting"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alleged Impairment"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Digdon |first=Nancy |last2=Powell |first2=Russell A.|last3=Harris |first3=Ben |date=2014 |title=Little Albert’s Alleged Neurologicial Impairment: Watson, Rayner, and Historical Revision |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/hop/17/4/312.html |journal=History of Psychology |publisher=American Psychological Association |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=312–324 |doi=10.1037/a0037325 |access-date=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Barger had been born within a day of Merritte, was known by friends and family as "Albert" (even though his given name was William), and his mother had also worked at the hospital where the experiment was conducted.  In addition, his size and developmental condition much more closely matched the experiment's documentation of the subject baby's condition.&lt;ref name="chronicle"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://chronicle.com/article/The-Search-for-Psychologys/146747/ | publisher=The Chronicle of Higher Education | last=Bartlett| first= T. |date=June 2, 2014 | title= The Search for Psychology's Lost Boy: In 2009 the Decades-old Mystery of 'Little Albert' was Finally Solved... or Was It?}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through the use of a professional genealogist, the researchers learned Barger had died in 2007 at age 87 and identified one close living relative, a niece. In an interview, Barger's niece stated that she and her uncle had been quite close throughout his life, acknowledged Barger's antipathy toward dogs as a well-known fact that family members would tease him about (the researchers noted there was no way to determine whether or not this behavior was linked to Watson's experiment), and stated that she did not recall any other phobias.  The researchers concluded that Barger would have been unaware of his role as an infant test subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.macewan.ca/wcm/MacEwanNews/WHAT_HAPPENED_TO_LITTLE_ALBERT| title=Whatever Happened to Little Albert?| date=June 2, 2014| publisher=MacEwan University News| accessdate=August 30, 2014| location=Edmonton, Alberta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethical considerations==
Although he probably continued to fear various furry objects for a time, Albert would likely go on to experience [[Extinction (psychology)|extinction]] later in life, losing the mental association between furry objects and loud noises. Nonetheless, the experiment today would be considered [[ethics|unethical]] according to the [[American Psychological Association]]'s ethic code, and legislation has been passed to prevent such potentially harmful experiments.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} In the early 1970s, following widely publicized cases of research abuse, The [[National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research]] (NCPHS) was created to study issues surrounding the protection of humans in research.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} In 1979, the Commission issued a report entitled ''Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research'' (commonly called the ''[[Belmont Report]]''), which provided the ethical framework on which current federal regulations for the protection of human participants in research are based.&lt;ref name="American Psychology Association; 2013"&gt;American Psychology Association; 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="National Institute of Health"&gt;National Institute of Health&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the NCPHS standards set in the late 1970s, an experiment such as Watson's would not have been allowed.&lt;ref&gt;American Psychology Association; 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note: It is now considered unethical to evoke reactions of fear in humans under laboratory circumstances, except when the participant has given informed consent to being purposely horrified as part of the experiment.  The standards dictate that experiments should not cause the human participants to suffer unnecessary distress or to be in any way physically harmed.  The welfare of the human participants must always be the paramount consideration in any form of research, and this is especially true with specially protected groups such as [[children]].&lt;/ref&gt; There are also regulations now put in place by the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996]] and the [[Public Health Service Act]], as well as required education since 2000 in the use of human research participants required by the [[National Institutes of Health]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Criticisms==
A detailed review of the original study and its subsequent interpretations by Ben Harris (1979)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://htpprints.yorku.ca/archive/00000198/01/BHARRIS.HTM | title = Whatever Happened to Little Albert? | author = Ben Harris | accessdate = 30 August 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120803155410/http://htpprints.yorku.ca/archive/00000198/01/BHARRIS.HTM | archivedate = 3 August 2012 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; stated:
{{quote|Critical reading of Watson and Rayner's (1920) report reveals little evidence either that Albert developed a rat [[phobia]] or even that animals consistently evoked his fear (or anxiety) during Watson and Rayner's experiment.  It may be useful for modern learning theorists to see how the Albert study prompted subsequent research [...] but it seems time, finally, to place the Watson and Rayner data in the category of "interesting but uninterpretable" results.}}

It is difficult to be certain exactly what happened during the Little Albert Experiment since concrete evidence and scientific records are lacking. Though a film was shot during the experiment, textbooks interpret the movie differently. Various sources give contradicting accounts of events that took place, and they raise questions about exactly what stimuli were used, which stimuli the baby came to fear, and what happened to the child after the experiment. It was said that most textbooks "suffer from inaccuracies of various degrees" while referring to Watson and Rayner's study.  Texts often misrepresent, exaggerate, or minimize the range of Albert's post-conditioning fears.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 2011, 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Other criticisms stem from the health of the child (cited as Douglas Merritte) who was not a "healthy," "normal" infant as claimed in the study, but one who was very ill and had exhibited symptoms of [[hydrocephalus]] since birth—according to relatives he never learned to walk or talk later in life. The child would die five years after the experiment due to complications from the congenital disease. It is stated that the study's authors were aware of the child's severe cognitive deficit, abnormal behavior, and unusually frequent crying, but continued to terrify the sick infant and generalize their findings to healthy infants, an act criticized as academic fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bartlett|first1=Tom|title=A New Twist in the Sad Saga of Little Albert|url=http://www.chronicle.com/blogs/percolator/a-new-twist-in-the-sad-saga-of-little-albert/28423|website=chronicle.com|publisher=The Chronicle of Higher Education|accessdate=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fridlund|first1=Alan J.|last2=Beck|first2=Hall P.|last3=Goldie|first3=William D.|last4=Irons|first4=Gary|title=Little Albert: A neurologically impaired child|date=November 2012|volume=15|issue=4|pages=302-327|doi=10.1037/a0026720|pmid=23397921|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2012-01974-001/|accessdate=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These accusations have been challenged in another academic article which states that the child was actually William (called Albert by his family) Barger, and that the child was, in fact, healthy.&lt;ref name="Alleged Impairment" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1993">'''Luigi Ferri''' (June 15, 1826 – 1895), [[Italy|Italian]] [[philosopher]], was born at [[Bologna]].

His education was obtained mainly at the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in [[Paris]], where his father, a painter and architect, was engaged in the construction of the Théâtre Italien. From his twenty-fifth year he began to lecture in the colleges of [[Evreux]], [[Dieppe, france|Dieppe]], [[Blois]] and [[Toulouse]]. Later, he was lecturer at [[Annecy]] and [[Casal-Montferrat]], and became head of the education department under [[Terenzio, conte Mamiani de la Rovere|Mamiani]] in 1860.

Three years later he was appointed to the chair of philosophy at the Istituto di Perfezionamento at [[Florence]], and, in 1871, was made professor of philosophy in the [[University of Rome La Sapienza]]. On the death of Mamiani in 1885 he became editor of the ''Filosofia delle scuole italiane'', whose title he changed to ''Rivista italiana di filosofia''. He wrote both on psychology and on metaphysics, but is known especially as a historian of philosophy.

His original work is eclectic, combining the psychology of his teachers, [[Jules Simon]], [[Émile Saisset|Saisset]] and Mamiani, with the idealism of [[Antonio Rosmini-Serbati|Rosmini]] and [[Vincenzo Gioberti|Gioberti]]. Among his works may be mentioned:
*''Studii sulla coscienza''
*''Il Fenomeno nelle sue relazioni con la sensazione''
*''Della idea del vera''
*''Della filosofia del diritto presso Aristotile'' (1885)
*''Il Genio di Aristotile''
*''La Psicologia di Pietro Pomponazzi'' (1877)
*most important, ''Essai sur l'histoire de la philosophie en Italie au XIX' siècle'' (Paris, 1869)
*''La Psychologie de l'association depuis Hobbes jusqu'à nos jours''

[[Image:MSCP Generic Poster.PNG|thumb|right|MSCP Poster outlining the various activities of the organisation. [http://www.mscp.org.au/ MSCP Website]]]

The '''Melbourne School of Continental Philosophy''' ('''MSCP''') is an institution dedicated to scholarly, extensive and engaged readings of key figures and texts in the history of modern European thought and contemporary discourse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mscp.org.au MSCP Identity Statement]&lt;/ref&gt; The School was founded in 2003 and formalised its status as an independent, [[not-for-profit]] organisation in 2004. It is based in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] and is housed by [[The University of Melbourne]].

== Formation and early years ==

In January 2002, Cameron Shingleton, Jon Roffe, Matt Sharpe and David Rathbone ran a summer school with four courses (on Nietzsche, on Deleuze, on Zizek and on Hegel, respectively) in the 1888 Building at the University of Melbourne.  Sharpe had just finished his PhD on Zizek with Marion Tapper and Jon Rundell at Melbourne; Rathbone had returned to Melbourne from studies with Agnes Heller and Reiner Schurmann at the New School for Social Research in New York; Shingleton had completed his honors degree on Nietzsche in the German department; and Roffe his, in French.  All four were of the opinion that the formalities of institutional academia alone were not sufficient to undertaking philosophical and critical thought. They thus formed the MSCP in the spirit of a [[guild]] of philosophers with the intention of preserving and fostering genuine intellectual engagement with continental philosophy. In 2003, they were joined by Sean Ryan, Craig Barrie, and Ashley Woodward, and later, Esther Anatolitis, Felicity Joseph, Jack Reynolds, Kate Noble, Alex Murray, Atliana Safich, Mark Tomlinson, Marc Hiatt, James Garrett, Bryan Cooke, Paul Daniels, Andrea Leon-Martino, and Sherah Bloor, all of whom have all been involved in various ways during the five years 2004-2009, running annual Summer and Winter Schools, as well as several conferences and research days.

== Events and activities ==
===Summer and Winter Schools===

The MSCP runs Summer and Winter Schools at the University of Melbourne during the university vacation breaks. Courses in the Schools consist of five two-hour lectures over a week and do not involve assessment or require any demonstrated prior knowledge of the topic in question. As the MSCP is a not-for-profit organisation, registration costs are minimal.

MSCP courses seek a detailed and scholarly encounter with philosophical thinkers and themes. In particular, the courses attempt to promote constructive ways of engaging with philosophy which are not widely represented in contemporary academic discourse. The courses aim to locate philosophy in the context of its historical and cultural milieu, encouraging lively, academic debate, emphasising the interdisciplinary aspects of philosophy. Classes are informal but strive to be rigorous and faithful to the philosophers and texts being studied.

Past courses have covered philosophers such as [[Hegel]], [[Nietzsche]], [[Heidegger]], [[Wittgenstein]], [[Lyotard]], [[Derrida]], [[Deleuze]] and [[Badiou]]. A series of courses has run over several Summer and Winter Schools entitled 'MSCP History of Philosophy Series' which assessed philosophy from the [[pre-Socratics]] to [[modern empiricism]]. Similar courses, treating a theme rather than a particular philosopher or text, have included 'Three Centuries of Aphorism' and 'Democracy, Elites and Violence'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mscp.org.au/past.html MSCP past sessions]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conferences===

The MSCP has run conferences including:

* 2002 Australasian Society of Continental Philosophy conference at the University of Melbourne (the MSCP hosted this conference in conjunction with the Department of Philosophy at the University of Melbourne),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ascp.org.au/conferences.htm ASCP 2002 conference]&lt;/ref&gt; held in December 2002
* 'Immanuel Kant Today', commemorating the 200th anniversary of the death of [[Immanuel Kant]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mscp.org.au/kant_papers.html Immanuel Kant Today conference]&lt;/ref&gt; held in February 2004
* 'Sensorium', a conference on philosophy and [[aesthetics]], held in June 2005
* '[[Sartre]] Colloquium' which included a performance of ''[[Huis Clos]]'' (held in conjunction with the Department of French, Italian and Spanish Studies and the Department of Philosophy), held in October 2005
* '200 Years of Hegel's ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arts.unimelb.edu.au/community/events/starters/archive/arts-starters-06-27-07.html "200 Years of Hegel's ''Phenomenology of Spirit''"]&lt;/ref&gt; held in July 2007

===Research days===

The MSCP has initiated a series of research days where philosophers in a particular field converge on a specific topic and workshop their papers together. So far, "[[Spinoza]] and the [[Infinity (philosophy)|Infinite]]", convened by Jon Roffe was held in December 2005 and was attended by [[Justin Clemens]], Simon Duffy, Minna Koivuniemi and Jon Roffe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mscp.org.au/research/spinoza_infinite.html 'Spinoza and the Infinite' research day]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Parrhesia Journal.PNG|thumb|left|''Parrhesia'' An International Journal of Critical Philosophy. [http://www.parrhesiajournal.org/ Parrhesia Journal]]]

=== ''Parrhesia'' Journal ===
''[[Parrhesia: A Journal of Critical Philosophy]]'' is an international journal of [[Critical Philosophy]] affiliated with MSCP. It is edited by four MSCP members: Alex Murray, Matthew Sharpe, Jon Roffe and Ashley Woodward.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parrhesiajournal.org Parrhesia Journal website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/anbd.bib-an000041083174 National Library of Australia entry for Parrhesia Journal]&lt;/ref&gt; It was launched in 2006 and has included articles by [[Alain Badiou]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parrhesiajournal.org/parrhesia02/parrhesia02_badiou1.pdf Badiou, Alain, "A musical variant on the metaphysics of the subject", trans. Justin Clemens, in ''Parrhesia'', 2, 2007, pp. 29 - 36]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parrhesiajournal.org/parrhesia02/parrhesia02_badiou2.pdf Badiou, Alain, "The Event in Deleuze", trans. Jon Roffe, in ''Parrhesia'', 2, 2007, pp. 37 - 44 ]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jacques Rancière]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parrhesiajournal.org/parrhesia01/parrhesia01_ranciere.pdf Rancière, Jacques, "Thinking between disciplines: an aesthetics of knowledge," trans. Jon Roffe, in ''Parrhesia'', 1, 2006, pp. 1 - 12 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

== The MSCP and the University of Melbourne ==

[[File:Old Arts Building, University of Melbourne.jpg|thumb|right|The Old Law Quadrangle at the University of Melbourne, home to the School of Philosophy. The MSCP office is located in this building.]]
 
During 2004, the founding Convenor, Jon Roffe, negotiated an informal relationship between the MSCP and the Philosophy Department with Chris Cordner (then Head of the Philosophy Department).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/ Link to the MSCP via the School of Philosophy website ]&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed the MSCP to undertake its activities using an office in the Department and University of Melbourne resources and teaching spaces. Late 2004, the MSCP invited Dr Marion Tapper of the University of Melbourne Philosophy Department to become a member. This merely formalised her involvement as she had always been supportive of the MSCP both philosophically and on account of knowing all of its members personally from teaching and supervision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/staff/tr.html Marion Tapper, School of Philosophy staff profile]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
One way in which the MSCP attempts to transcend its university boundaries is by seeking new ways to teach and engage with philosophy.  In particular, MSCP events strive to be both informal and rigorous. With their courses offering no credit or assessment, students who attend are usually there for the joy of philosophy and seek to further their own intellects outside of a formal classroom setting. Being a not-for-profit organisation, the MSCP charges a minimum for its courses; again, this is aimed at transcending the current economic climate of university funding.

== Membership ==

New members are typically recommended by current members and, largely because the organisation was founded by postgraduate students, they are usually honours year or postgraduate students themselves.

==History==
The influence of rhythmic sounds and drums to enter altered states of consciousness is used in different indigenous tribes (see [[Shamanic music]]), as well as optical stimulation produced by the flickering light of camp fires or pressing lightly on the eyeballs.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thomason|first=Timothy|date=2010-01-01|title=The Role of Altered States of Consciousness in Native American Healing|url=http://works.bepress.com/timothy_thomason/10/|journal=Journal of Rural Community Psychology|volume=E13|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This “stroboscopic photo-stimulation produces "photic driving", the alpha type of brain electrical activity associated with an altered state in which people are susceptible to suggestion.” (&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;12).

First scientific observations were made by [[William Charles Wells]] in the 1790s who described different effects of binocular vision. His results were later transferred to be applied in [[binaural beats]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Destined for Distinguished Oblivion: The Scientific Vision of William Charles Wells (1757-1817)|last=Wade|first=N. J.|publisher=Kluwer-Plenum|year=2003|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Visual experiments with flickering lights were conducted in the 1940s by [[William Grey Walter]] who used stroboscopic light flashes to measure their effects on brain activity, assessed with EEG. He reported effect not just on visual areas but on the whole cortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The living brain|last=Walter|first=W. G|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|year=1963|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the '60s and '70s the interest in different methods to induce altered states without the use of drugs were rising. Some of the induced states by rhythmic light and sound combinations were even described as psychedelic-like, while these claims lack adequate measurements for their similarity. In this line, numerous nightclubs began using strobes to maximize the effects of the music for dancing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The development of alpha EEG feedback (see [[neurofeedback]]) is an important starting point for biofeedback and its explicit use for entering altered states of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Lynch, J. |author2=Paskewitz, D. |author3=Orne, M. |date=1974|title=Some Factors in the Feedback Control of Human Alpha Rhythm|url=|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|volume=36|issue=5|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these decades, Jack Schwarz built one of the first mind machines using rhythmic sounds and variable frequency lights in goggles to produce certain mental states.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Enterprises started to produce different types of mind machines and also some scientist followed the line of research to explore if and how these devices elicit effects on brain processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Audio-Visual Entrainment: History, Physiology, and Clinical Studies|last=Siever|first=D.|work=Handbook of Neurofeedback: Dynamics and Clinical Applications|publisher=James R. Evans|year=2007|isbn=|location=The Haworth Medical Press, Binghamton, NY|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s and early 1990s Farley initiated an investigation concerning medical claims made by some manufacturers and sellers.&lt;ref name="medical_claims" /&gt; The FDA concluded that Light and Sound Machines were not medical devices and did not warrant regulation. Sellers and manufacturers were given guidelines for how they could advertise these devices, and were required to include a disclaimer and cautionary document with each machine.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}
Nowadays, mind machines are rediscovered by some teenage cultures  as so called “digital drugs”, a legal way to enter altered states of consciousness.&lt;ref name="Idosing" /&gt;

== Application ==
Mind machines include flashing light devices, which are similar to the Brion Gysin dreamachine in that both produce a flickering visual field. Unlike flashing light devices, the dreamachine can be used by several people at once, but has few, if any, technical features.

=== Technical setting ===
[[File:Dreammachine.jpg |right|thumb|200px |A Brion Gysin Dreammachine.]]Mind machines typically consist of a control unit, a pair of headphones and/or strobe light goggles. The unit controls the sessions and drives the LEDs in the goggles. Professionally, they are usually referred to as Auditory Visual Stimulation Devices (AVS devices).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=PhD|first=Ruth Olmstead|date=2005-09-06|title=Use of Auditory and Visual Stimulation to Improve Cognitive Abilities in Learning-Disabled Children|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J184v09n02_04|journal=Journal of Neurotherapy|volume=9|issue=2|pages=49–61|doi=10.1300/J184v09n02_04|issn=1087-4208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also mind machines are offered that can connect to the Internet for updates download of new session material.

=== Application rate ===
One session normally takes between 15 and 60 minutes. During a session the user should lie relaxed, and place the glasses on the eyes, which should remain closed during the whole session. Many machines have pre-programmed sessions which vary in parameters like light brightness, audio pitch or beat frequency but also give the opportunity for the user to create an own session for him-/herself. Typically one session consists of a series of segments. Within one segment parameters change in a constant way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.amazing1.com/products/the-proteus.html|title=Advanced light sound stimulation system: Reference Guide and User’s Manual|last=Proteus|date=2006|work=|access-date=May 20, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mind machines are often used together with biofeedback or neurofeedback equipment in order to adjust the frequency on the fly,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.happy-electronics.eu/avs/application/|title=Applications – Happy Electronics|website=www.happy-electronics.eu|access-date=2016-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; while proof for their effectiveness is lacking.

== Description of altered states ==

=== Perceptual changes ===
Light &amp; sound mind machines can have various effects on the user. Most users describe seeing a flashing light, others perceive swirling patterns that have been compared to psychedelic light shows or fractals. A few users report seeing detailed, virtual reality like scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://realization.org/page/doc0/doc0036.htm|title=Mind machines FAQ|last=Hicks|first=J.|date=1999|website=|publisher=|access-date=May 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; But also tactile and emotional changes are reported  after a 6&amp;nbsp;Hz photic stimulation, as well as auditory hallucinations like binaural beats.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Changes in brain activity ===
Sessions will typically aim to address the target frequencies which correspond to delta (1-3 hertz), theta (4–7&amp;nbsp;Hz), alpha (8–12&amp;nbsp;Hz) or beta brain waves (13–40&amp;nbsp;Hz).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=mindmods.com|title=Accessing Alternity: Neurotechnology and Alternate States of Consciousness|last=Harrah-Conforth|first=B.|date=1992|work=|access-date=July 15, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those frequency bands can be adjusted by the user based on the desired effects.

For relaxation, often a reduction from beta waves to lower alpha or theta frequencies is observed. It is aimed to reach a level of “slow alpha” (8&amp;nbsp;Hz).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Glickson (1986) states that an alpha frequency of 10&amp;nbsp;Hz is optimal for perceiving visual hallucinations. He assumes that it's the change in alpha activity and not the alpha activity itself that is facilitating an altered state of consciousness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== After effects ===
Even if research is not sufficient so far, Michael Hutchison and other scientists report strong tranquilizing effects that lasted up to 3 days.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After several sessions it is observed that users can produce a desired brain state with the associated brainwaves easier and deliberately.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Other information ==

=== Therapeutic Use ===
Clinical research has been done on the use of auditory and visual stimulation to improve cognitive abilities in learning-disabled children as well as in the treatment of [[autism]] and [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Siever|first=D.|date=2003|title=Audio-Visual Entrainment: Applying Audio-Visual Entrainment Technology For Attention and Learning|url=|journal=Association for Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback (AAPB) publication, "Biofeedback Magazine"|volume=31|issue=4|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, lacking enough evidence to conclude that these treatments show efficacy, several studies indicate the potential to  increase effects on IQ and reading levels in primary students (cite Olmstead, 2005), but also improvements in inattention and impulsiveness in children with ADHD (cite Siever).

===Safety===

Rapidly flashing lights may be dangerous for people with [[photosensitive epilepsy]] or other nervous disorders.  It is thought that one out of 10,000 adults will experience a [[seizure]] while viewing such a device; about twice as many children will have a similar ill effect.&lt;ref name="Allen"&gt;{{cite news |first=Mark |last=Allen|title=Décor by Timothy Leary |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/20/garden/20mach.html?ex=1264050000&amp;en=2ead60550b324624&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt |work= |publisher=The New York Times |date=2005-01-20 |accessdate=2007-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulation===

Mind machine devices are legally available throughout the United States from many sources.&lt;ref name="Idosing" /&gt;

With some exceptions,&lt;ref name=TENS_approval&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm388765.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; these devices commonly do not have [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] approval for medical applications in the USA. They have been found by a U.S. district court to be Class III medical devices, and consequentially require FDA pre-market approval for all medical uses. One company making [[radionics|medical claims]] for a possibly unsafe device has been shut down and seen their devices destroyed.&lt;ref name=medical_claims&gt;{{ cite journal |last1 = Farley Dixie|year = 1994 |title = Unapproved 'Brain Wave' Devices Condemned after Seizure Reports |journal = FDA Consumer |quote = The devices were various models of a product called the InnerQuest Brain Wave Synchronizer - headgear (an audio cassette and eyeglasses) that emitted sounds and flashing lights.

'''Nan Huai-Chin''' ({{zh|t=南懷瑾|s=南怀瑾|p=Nán Huáijǐn}}) (March 18, 1918&amp;nbsp;– September 29, 2012) was a spiritual teacher of contemporary [[China]]. He was considered by many to be the major force in the revival of [[Chinese Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nanhuaijin.org/ |title=Nan Huai Jin |publisher=Nan Huai Jin |date=2006-09-25 |accessdate=2012-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004234347/http://www.nanhuaijin.org/ |archivedate=2012-10-04 |df= }} (Chinese)&lt;/ref&gt; While Nan was regarded by many in China as one of the most influential Chan Buddhist teachers, he was little known outside the [[East Asian cultural sphere|Chinese cultural sphere]].&lt;ref&gt;Scharmer, Otto, and Senge, Peter. ''Presence: Human Purpose and the Field of the Future.'' 2008. p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; Nan died at the age of 95 on Sept. 29th, 2012 in [[Suzhou]], China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1eew.com/data/page.php?id=638943 国学大师南怀瑾在苏州辞世 享年95岁] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130101220617/http://www.1eew.com/data/page.php?id=638943 |date=2013-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and military career ==

Nan Huai-Chin was born March 18, 1918, to a [[scholar-official]] family in [[Yueqing]] county, [[Wenzhou]] city, [[Zhejiang]] province. In his youth, Nan received a classical education that included various [[Confucianism|Confucian]] and [[Taoism|Daoist]] works, as well as [[traditional Chinese medicine]], [[Chinese literature|literature]], [[Chinese calligraphy|calligraphy]], [[poetry]], and other subjects. In his youth at the age of 18, he became the provincial [[martial arts]] champion after studying several [[Chinese martial arts]] including swordsmanship with the ''[[jian]]''.

Nan studied social welfare at [[Jinling University]] (now merged with [[Nanjing University]]), and later went on to teach at the [[Republic of China Military Academy]] in [[Nanjing]]. In the late 1930s at the age of 21 years, Nan became a military commander at the border regions of [[Sichuan]], [[Xikang]], and [[Yunnan]] during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sinc.sunysb.edu/Clubs/buddhism/nhj Master Nan and his teachings]&lt;/ref&gt; There, he led a local group of 30,000 men against the Japanese invasion.&lt;ref&gt;Nan Huai-Chin. ''Diamond Sutra Explained''. Florham Park: Primordia, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

== Buddhist practice ==

While still young, Nan left his military career so that he could commit himself fully to his study of Buddhism and to [[Buddhist meditation|meditation]]. In 1942 at age 24, he went on a three-year meditation retreat in the [[Mount Emei|Emei Mountains]]. It is said that it was there that he verified his experiences against the [[Chinese Buddhist canon]]. During this time, Nan's primary teacher was Yuan Huanxian (袁煥仙; 1887&amp;nbsp;– 1966).

In 1945, Nan went to seek out the teachings of [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. The 9th Gangkar Rinpoche (貢噶活佛; 1893&amp;nbsp;– 1957), a high-ranking [[tulku]] of the [[Kagyu]] school, also verified Nan's experiences, giving him the title "Vajra Master."&lt;ref name="grass_vii_viii"&gt;Yuan, Margaret. ''Grass Mountain: A Seven Day Intensive in Ch'an Training with Master Nan Huai-Chin''. York Beach: Samuel Weiser, 1986. pp. vii-viii&lt;/ref&gt; Nan was one of the few multidisciplinary experts in the world to be versed in the cultivation schools of Confucianism, Daoism, Tibetan Buddhism, and Chan Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dialogonleadership.org/interviews/Huai-Chin.shtml Interview with Master Nan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224164949/http://www.dialogonleadership.org/interviews/Huai-Chin.shtml |date=2008-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nan's [[Dharma name]] was ''Tōngchán'' (通禪).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfzt.org/documents/319 峨眉山往事─通禅与王恩洋]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic and personal life ==

Following the revolution in China, Nan later moved to [[Taiwan]] in 1949 where he became a well-known university professor and author, teaching at [[National Chengchi University]], [[Chinese Culture University]], and [[Fu Jen Catholic University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national-news/2012/10/01/356139/Academic-Nan.htm Academic Nan Huai-chin reported dead in mainland - The China Post&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; His first book, ''The Sea of Chan'' (禪海蠡測), was published in 1955, and was the first in a line of over 40 books and related materials published in his name.

Nan's books have achieved a great deal of popularity in mainland China and Taiwan. In total, more than 20 million copies of his books have been sold in Chinese-speaking countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Diamond Sutra Explained |url=https://www.amazon.com/Diamond-Sutra-Explained-Huaijin-Nan/dp/0971656126 |title=Diamond Sutra Explained: Huaijin Nan: 9780971656123: Amazon.com: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his more popular works have gone to a 20th printing in Taiwan and his works on Confucianism are used as standard university references in the mainland and Taiwan.&lt;ref name="grass_vii_viii"/&gt; [[Thomas Cleary]], who has translated several of his books into English, has written the following about Nan's works and methodology:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0877287767 Master Nan book review "The Cultivation of Practice" translated by J.C. Cleary]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|There is no question that Master Nan's work is a cut above anything else available from modern authors, either academic or sectarian, and I would like to see his work gain its rightful place in the English speaking world. ... [His] studies contain broad learning in all three main traditions of Chinese thought, Confucian, Taoist, and Buddhist. Although this comprehensive purview was common to the greatest minds of China since the T'ang dynasty, it is rare among scholars today.}}

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Nan mediated secret cross-strait communications between the mainland China and Taiwan.&lt;ref name="conflict_43_44"&gt;Bercovitch, Jacob, Kwei-Bo Huang, Chung-Chien Teng. ''Conflict Management, Security and Intervention in East Asia.'' 2008. pp. 43-44&lt;/ref&gt; Two of Nan's students were close confidants of Taiwan's President [[Lee Teng-hui]], and Nan was approached by his student Jia Yibin about creating a communication channel between Lee Teng-hui and mainland China's President [[Yang Shangkun]].&lt;ref name="conflict_43_44"/&gt; Both Jia and Nan mediated cross-straight negotiations, and successfully realized secret chamber meetings between special envoys.&lt;ref name="conflict_43_44"/&gt; In the early 1990s, Nan changed his place of residence from Taiwan to [[Hong Kong]]. Some secret cross-strait meetings were held at Nan's private residence in Hong Kong.&lt;ref name="conflict_43_44"/&gt;

In January 1992, Nan signed a contract with the Chinese government and invested 92 million RMB in the [[Jinhua–Wenzhou Railway]], which is the first joint-stock railway in China. In 2004, Nan returned to the mainland near Suzhou.

Nan died at the age of 94 on September 29, 2012.

== Taihu Great Learning Center ==

In [[Wujiang District, Suzhou]], in 2006, Nan founded the {{convert|200|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Lake Tai|Taihu]] Great Learning Center ([[:zh:太湖大學堂|太湖大學堂]]), which contains the Wujiang Taihu International School. The school curriculum is meant to combine the best approaches of traditional China and the West. It has unique emphases such as [[meditation]], [[ethics]] and [[etiquette]], [[Traditional Chinese medicine|traditional Chinese medical theory]], and [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[English language|English]] recitation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140427175841/http://www.educhina2000.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=174%3Awujiang-taihu-international-school&amp;catid=72%3Aguo0101&amp;Itemid=299 educhina2000: Wujiang Taihu International School]&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the school is in reference to the ''[[Great Learning]]'', one of the "[[Four Books]]" of [[Confucianism]].

'''Nana Asma'u''' (full name: '''Nana Asma’u bint Shehu Usman dan Fodiyo''', {{lang-ar|نانا أسماء بنت عثمان فودي}}; 1793–1864) was a [[princess]], [[poet]], [[teacher]], and a daughter of the founder of the [[Sokoto Caliphate]], [[Usman dan Fodio]].  She remains a revered figure in northern [[Nigeria]].  She is held up by some as an example of education and independence of women possible under [[Islam]], and by others as a precursor to modern [[feminism]] in Africa.

==Biography==
Nana Asma'u was born some 11 years before the [[Fulani War]] (1804–08), and was named after [[Asma bint Abi Bakr]], a companion of the Muslim Prophet. The daughter of the [[Sufi]]-inspired and [[Fula people|Fulɓe]]-led Sokoto Caliphate's founder and half-sister of its [[Muhammed Bello]] (the second [[Sultan of Sokoto]]), she outlived most of the founding generation of the Caliphate, making her an important source of guidance to its later rulers. From 1805, members of the Caliph's family came to great prominence, including the Caliph's female relatives. While Nana Asma'u became the most prominent, her sisters Myram and Fatima, and the Caliph's wives Aisha and Hawwa played major literary and political roles in the new state.  Like her father, she was educated in [[Tafsir|Qur'anic studies]], and placed a high value upon universal education. As exemplars of the [[Qadiriyyah]] Sufi school, the dan Fodio and his followers stressed the sharing of knowledge, especially that of the [[Sunnah]], the example of the prophet [[Muhammad]]. To learn without teaching, they thought, was sterile and empty.  Thus Nana Asma'u was devoted, in particular, to the education of the Muslim women. Like most of the rest of her family, she became a prolific author.

==Writer and counsellor==
Well educated in the classics of the Arab and Classical world, and well versed in four languages ([[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Fula language|the Fula language]], [[Hausa language|Hausa]] and [[Tuareg languages|Tamacheq Tuareg]]), Nana Asma'u had a public reputation as a leading scholar in the most influential Muslim state in West Africa, which gave her the opportunity to correspond broadly.&lt;ref&gt;David Westerlund wrote: "She continued to be a source of inspiration to the present day." Mary Wren Bivins, ''Telling Stories, Making Histories: Women, Words and Islam in Nineteenth-Century Hausaland and the Sokoto Caliphate''. London: Heinemann, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; She witnessed many of the wars of the Fulani War and wrote about her experiences in a prose narrative ''Wakar Gewaye'', "The Journey".  As the Sokoto Caliphate began as a cultural and religious revolutionary movement, the writings of its leaders held a special place by which later generations, both rulers and ruled, could measure their society. She became a counsellor to her brother when he took the Caliphate, and is recorded writing instructions to governors and debating with the scholars of foreign princes.

==Poet==
Among her more than 60 surviving works written over 40 years, Nana Asma’u left behind a large body of [[Arabic poetry|poetry]] in Arabic, the Fula language and Hausa, all written in the [[Arabic script]]. Many of these are historical narratives, but they also include elegies, laments, and admonitions. Her poems of guidance became tools for teaching the founding principles of the Caliphate. Asma'u also collaborated closely with [[Muhammed Bello]], the second Caliph. Her works include and expand upon the dan Fodio's strong emphasis on women leaders and women's rights within the community ideals of the Sunnah and [[Sharia|Islamic law]].&lt;ref name=Boyd&gt;{{Cite book

==Women's education==
Others of the surviving written works by Asma'u are related to Islamic education: for much of her adult life she was responsible for women's religious education. Starting around 1830, she created a cadre of women teachers (''jajis'') who travelled throughout the Caliphate educating women in the students' homes. In turn, each of these ''jajis'' used Nana Asma’u's and other Sufi scholars writings, usually through recited mnemonics and poetry, to train crops of learned women, called the ''’yan-taru'', or "those who congregate together, the sisterhood." To each ''jaji'' she bestowed a malfa (a hat and traditional ceremonial symbol of office of the pagan [[Hausa animism|Bori]] priestesses in [[Gobir]]) tied with a red turban. The ''jajis'' became, thus, symbols of the new state, the new order, and of Islamic learning even outside women's community.&lt;ref&gt;Excerpt from Mack, Beverly B., and Jean Boyd, [http://chnm.gmu.edu/wwh/p/214.html ''One Woman’s Jihad: Nana Asma’u, Scholar and Scribe'']. Includes two translated poems of Nana Asma'u.&lt;/ref&gt; In part, this educational project began as a way to integrate newly conquered pagan captives into a Muslim ruling class.  It expanded, however, to include the poor and rural, training teachers who travelled across the sprawling Caliphate.

==Contemporary legacy==
Nana Asma'u's continued legacy rests not just on her literary work, but also on her role in defining the values of the Sokoto state.  Today in Northern Nigeria, Islamic women's organisations, schools, and meeting halls are commonly named for her.  She re-entered the debate on the role of women in Islam in the 20th century, as her legacy has been carried by Islamic scholars and immigrants to Europe and its academic debates.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Boyd and Murray Last quote the Algerian scholar [[Ismael Hamet]] writing for a French audience in 1898, lamenting the "''Ligues Feministes d'Europe''" did not know of Nana Asma'u's legacy.  See "The Role of Women as 'Agents Religieux' in Sokoto", p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The republishing and translation of her works has brought added attention to the purely literary value of her prose and poems. She is the subject of several studies, including Jean Boyd's ''The Caliph's Sister: Nana Asma'u 1793–1865: Teacher, Poet and Islamic Leader'' (1989), described as an "important book" that "provides a good read for the nonspecialist willing to discard common stereotypes about women in Africa",&lt;ref&gt;Beverly B. Mack, [https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/african-studies-review/article/jean-boyd-the-caliphs-sister-nana-asmau-17931865-teacher-poet-and-islamic-leader-london-and-new-jersey-frank-cass-co-ltd-1988-168-pp-bibliography-glossary-15-paper/33098355463B75AF7CAF554FB000922D "Book Reviews"], ''African Studies Review'', Volume 33, Issue 2, September 1990, pp. 219–220.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''One Woman's Jihad: Nana Asma’u, Scholar and Scribe'' by Beverly B. Mack and Jean Boyd (2000). ''The Collected Works of Nana Asma’u, Daughter of Usman dan Fodiyo 1793–1864'', edited by Boyd and Mack, was published in 1997.

The song is remarkable for its impartial, egalitarian lyrics, which extols the soldiers' love and duty to the motherland without explicit reference to any particular race or religion.

''Perajurit Tanah Air'' found renewed popularity among Malaysians in the wake of the [[2013 Lahad Datu standoff]].

'''Philosophy of Eating''' is a concept of food production and nutritional philosophy that matches the source and result of health together.

The core of these points of view is to attach a mental state of mind with the sources of proper agricultural food sources in a balance of harmony in part because the sources have freshness and purity. Modern assertions are that the fresh foods contain vital [[micronutrients]] generally lost in most food processing.

Additional issues are brought to light in modern times where [[advertising]] along with subtle cues in color or related sensory inputs are masking substandard or even toxic ingredients present.  The masquerade of dyes and organic chemicals from non-food sources become key in the current vernacular of various publications and nutrition movements.

==History==
As a book [[The Philosophy of Eating]] by author [[Albert Jones Bellows|Andrew Bellows]] in the late 1860s,.&lt;ref&gt;Albert J. Bellows (1868) [https://books.google.com/books/about/Philosophy_of_Eating_1868.html?id=7Td5xyWSFb4C originated at the Harvard University Library, subsequently published by Hurd and Houghton] 1867.&lt;/ref&gt; The author portrayed the concepts in light of science as well as views drawn from religiosity common in the middle to late 1860's era.  So with a biblical fervor as an original direction of inspiration the author then supplies a variety of what was then scientific knowledge to correctly apply that in agriculture to the table in the kitchen. Fresh fruits and grains as those so ordained in the work making up a core of inputs to the meats of the day looked upon in detail most up to that time obtained from the local butcher.

More recent incarnations derived from this are exhibited in [[raw foodism]] for people. This manifestation seen in a variety of areas including [[vegan|vegan food preparation]] and offshoots related. The [[micronutrients]] [[amylase]]s, [[protease]]s, and [[lipase]]s aid digestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holisticjunction.com/articles/8019.html |title="Digestive Enzymes do More than just Aid Digestion", an article at Holistic Junction |publisher=Holisticjunction.com |date=2007-08-24 |accessdate=2010-05-12 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; to a variety of shared characteristics of the origins of food spelled out in the 1860s book started to mainstream more so as a backlash to &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drweil.com/drw/u/ART02840/How-to-Eat-in-Seven-Words.html |title="How to Eat in Seven Words", an article at Dr. Andrew Weil |author=Brad Lemley|publisher=drweil.com |date=2011-01-28 |accessdate=2013-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; simplify the sourcing to consumption in thought as well a contexts for acceptability.

Contemporary revisiting of this in a new updated book continuing is a more secular scientific work by [[George Davey]] who published a 2013 book called ''Break the Trance''.  [[The Philosophy of Eating Break the Trance|Break the Trance]]
.&lt;ref&gt;George Davey (2013) [http://lccn.loc.gov/2013938024 The Library of Congress, published by Corn Publishing]  2013.&lt;/ref&gt; With more up to date scientific analysis than the treatise from [[Albert Jones Bellows|Andrew Bellows]] the author describes how mechanisms of discovery, chemical masks and the driving forces beyond that of the earlier works in the topic.

==Experiences==

Philosophy extends from the scientific observation to how we as people treat our animals versus ourselves in dietary habits from youth through to adulthood.

Reviving the lost art of nourishing ourselves &lt;ref&gt;Carrien and Tamra (2006) [http://foodthatnourishes.blogspot.com/2006/10/philosophy-of-eating.html 'Philosophy of Eating', the real food revolution]  2006&lt;/ref&gt; blogged about in part to illustrate this as a proper approach.

Though cited in [[The Philosophy of Eating Break the Trance|Break the Trance]], health philosophy of eating like our paleolithic ancestors is found in a variety directions including mineral intake.

==Contrast==

Processed foods get celebration along with trepidation in newer periodicals in 2013. Scientific American and Wired devote entire issues to food content and philosophy of nutrition.

Particularly, the scientific basis is now better understood and psychological remediation or behavior patterns are more amenable to that of a reader in modern times contrasted with processed food celebration by.&lt;ref&gt;Evelyn Kim (2013) [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=processed-food-a-two-million-year-history 'Processed Food: A 2-Million-Year History', It is the dark force, we're told, behind the obesity epidemic, the death of the family farm and Tang...]  2013&lt;/ref&gt; The continued strength of industrialized food troubles some people though.

The '''Public Access Scheme''' (a.k.a. "Direct Access") allows members of the public in England &amp; Wales to instruct a [[barrister]] directly.   In the past, it was necessary for clients to use a [[solicitor]] or other third party in order to instruct a [[barrister]].

==History==
The Public Access Scheme was first established in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barcouncil.org.uk/media/119600/public_access_guidance_for_lay_clients_-_mar_2010_-_as_at_25_oct_2011__1_.pdf |format=PDF |title=THE PUBLIC ACCESS SCHEME : GUIDANCE FOR LAY CLIENT |website=Barcouncil.org\accessdate=2016-02-05}} &lt;/ref&gt;  Initially, there was a natural inclination to proceed gradually with its implementation.  The scheme heralded the first time for more than a century that barristers could be instructed directly by the public without the involvement of a solicitor, and there was a level of uncertainty as to whether clients would understand the limitations of barristers’ work. Understandably, it was felt that the new scheme should be approached carefully.  

Over the course of numerous consultations conducted by the [[Bar Standards Board]], the rules for public access practice were gradually relaxed to serve the public interest, particularly in light of pending cuts to [[Legal Aid]] funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bush |first=Stephen |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2015/09/five-years-death-british-justice-system |title=Five years in the death of the British justice system |website=Newstatesman.com |date=2015-09-08 |accessdate=2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current Public Access rules, which enable the widest scope of direct public access to barristers to date, are covered in C119-C131 of the Code of Conduct contained in the Bar Standards Board Handbook which came into force on 15 April 2015.

==Impacts==
The main advantage of the Public Access Scheme for consumers of legal services is the opportunity to save on legal costs, specifically solicitor’s fees.  However, removing solicitors from the processes of running a legal case often requires that clients themselves must perform the majority of document management, filing, and other related activities in the context of conducting litigation. 

Barristers are not allowed to take on public access clients unless doing so is in both the client’s best interests and in the interests of justice.&lt;ref&gt;Section D2 of the Bar Standards Board Handbook - Rules C120(3), C122 and C123.&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, in complicated cases barristers must recommend to clients that they obtain external support from a solicitor.  However, since the expense of using a solicitor can potentially defeat the 'cost-saving' purpose of the Public Access Scheme, consumers have the option of using a provider of [[Public Access Legal Support]] service (PALS), which is a specialised paralegal resource catering to barristers and clients who work together within the framework of the Public Access Scheme.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1641">'''Richard Robinson''' ([[Watton, Norfolk]], 12 April 1902–6 May 1996, [[Oxford]]) was an English secularist philosopher.

==Biography==

Robinson was educated at [[Repton School]] and [[Oxford University]].&lt;ref name=Indep&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-richard-robinson-1336987.html The Independent - Obituary]. 14 June 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

He taught at [[Cornell University]] from 1928 to 1946, then returned to Oxford University for over 20 years. He translated and edited books and articles on [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name=Indep/&gt;

Most of his books were academic, but ''An Atheist's Values'' gave him a popular audience. Nicolas Walter, writing in ''[[The Independent]]'', described the book as "one of the best short accounts of liberalism (a term Robinson accepted) and humanism (a term he ignored) produced during the present century, all the more powerful for its lucidity and moderation, its wit and wisdom."&lt;ref name=Indep/&gt;

'''Secret Santa''' is a [[Western culture|Western]] [[Christmas]] tradition in which members of a group or community are randomly assigned a person to whom they give a [[gift]].  The identity of the gift giver is a secret not to be revealed until after the gift is opened. 

Deriving from the [[Christianity|Christian]] tradition, the ritual is known as ''Secret Santa'' in the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]]; as ''Kris Kringel'' or ''Kris Kindle'' (''Christkindl'') in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]; as ''Wichteln, Secret Santa'', ''Kris Kringle'', ''Chris Kindle'' (''Christkindl'') or Engerl-Bengerl in parts of [[Austria]]; as ''Secret Santa'' or ''Kris Kringle'' in [[Canada]] and [[Australia]]; as ''Secret Santa'', ''Kris Kringle'', or ''Monito-monita'' in the [[Philippines]]; as ''Angelito'' in the [[Dominican Republic]]; and as "Wichteln" in Germany. "Wichteln" is what a "Wichtel", a wight, does, a good deed. In [[Poland]], the tradition is celebrated on the day of 6 December (Mikołajki),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.obliczakultury.pl/publicystyka/obyczaje-swiata/1506-mikolajki-6-grudnia|title=Oblicza Kultury - Mikołajki - 6 grudnia - Obyczaje świata|author=Magda Goetz|work=Oblicza Kultury}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mowimyjak.pl/styl-zycia/uroczystosci/kim-jest-sw-mikoaj-skad-sie-wzia-zwyczaj-kupowania-prezentow-na-6-grudnia,87_34412.html|title=Mikołajki. Skąd zwyczaj kupowania prezentów?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Ukraine]] — on December, 19th (Mykolay).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://destinations.com.ua/events/st-nicholas-day-in-ukraine|title=St. Nicholas Day in Ukraine|website=destinations.com.ua|language=en|access-date=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these names derive from traditional Christmas gift-bringers: the American custom is named after [[Santa Claus]], or St Nicholas (Poland and Ukraine), while ''Chris Kindle'' and ''Kris Kringle'' are both corruptions of the original name of the Austrian gift-bringer ''[[Christkindl]]'', which means the "Christ Child". Exceptions are the UK (where the traditional gift-bringer is [[Father Christmas]]) and the Philippines (which has the [[Three Kings]]). [[Spain]], [[Portugal]] and most places in [[Latin America]] use ''amigo secreto'' (secret friend) or ''amigo invisible/invisível'' (invisible friend). In [[Israel]], this game is called ''גמד וענק'' (A Dwarf and a Giant) and is mostly played during [[Purim]].

The term ''Pollyanna''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sassysanta.com/pollyanna/|title=Pollyanna Gift Exchange|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is used in [[Southeastern Pennsylvania]] and [[South Jersey]].

==Variations==

=== Thieving Secret Santa/Stealing Secret Santa/White Elephant/Yankee Swap ===

{{main|White elephant gift exchange}}
In this version, participants (players) bring one gift each which is potentially suitable or interesting to any of the other participants. The gifts should be wrapped in such a way as to disguise their nature. Ideally, the provider of each gift should not be disclosed when setting up the game. Players take turns, and can either open a new gift, or steal a previously opened gift. This game is more commonly known as the [[white elephant gift exchange]], or Yankee Swap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capecodonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071223/NEWS/712230338 |title=Yankee Swappers play gift game |publisher=CapeCodOnline.com |date=23 December 2007 |accessdate=2011-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify credibility|date=December 2013}}

===Guessing===

Each participant brings a gift for their assigned person, with a letter. This letter may or may not have hints on who the giver might be, depending on the rules participants have established. Each receiver must guess who made the gift.

===Secret Casino Santa===
In this version, each person buys a gift for specific amount, not for anyone specifically. Each person also puts in a specific amount of money into a pot. Who goes first in gift selection can be determined by random selection. The options are:

*Option A: Choose a gift
*Option B: Do not choose a gift, and go for Money.
*Option C: Put your name in to win all the unwanted gifts by those who went for Option B.

At the end, the gifts that were chosen are opened and the winner of the money and leftover gifts are drawn.

===Conspiracy Santa===
In this version, participants engage in a "conspiracy" where all participants work together to select a gift for a single participant without that participant's direct involvement or knowledge. Many such individual "conspiracies" run concurrently, one for each participant. Email threads or web apps are commonly used to manage each "conspiracy" until a consensus is made, wherein the gift is purchased by a decided upon participant and given at a later date. A common theme of Conspiracy Santa is collectively learning about participants, making it popular for workplaces and schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2472555,00.asp |title=Sick of Secret Santa? Try Conspiracy Santa |publisher=PCMag.com |date=21 November 2014 |accessdate=2014-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Secret Santa Online ===
The tradition of Secret Santa is becoming increasingly popular in online communities. 

On the one hand there are several ''Secret Santa Generators'' that tell every participant in a group for whom to buy a gift. This is especially useful for groups who can't meet in person to draw the names from a hat or bowl before the Secret Santa event. Popular ''Secret Santa Generators'' are:
* [https://www.drawnames.com/ DrawNames]: a simple email based Secret Santa Generator (supports multiple languages)
* [https://www.elfster.com/ elfster]: a combination of a Secret Santa Generator and an online shop to buy the Secret Santa gift (products on the US shop of Amazon.com). This also lets people RSVP to the invitations that are sent out to their name
* [https://www.pikkado.com/ Pikkado]: a free and very complete tool to successfully organize a Secret Santa gift exchange. (supports multiple languages: EN, ES, FR, PT)
*[https://wichtelmania.com/en/ Wichtelmania]: a Secret Santa Generator without email registration (based on secret links that can be sent to the participants using WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, ... or email)
* [https://www.easysanta.com Easy Santa]: a Secret Santa Generator available on [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[IOS]] where users register through the mobile phone and the draws are made and consulted also through the mobile phone. It supports 25 languages and works in most countries.
* [https://www.my-secret-santa.org My Secret Santa]: a full mobile Secret Santa Generator (no installation) to manage from 3 to thousands of participants and providing functionalities like: 1 to 5 draws per participant, custom design, anonymous messages exchanges between participants, vocal message to santa / whishlist sharing, gif ideas.
* [https://www.partylabz.com/secretsanta PartyLabz]: a Secret Santa Generator within online RSVP website. You can create an event and add a Secret Santa tab there. To be able to play, participants need to [[RSVP (invitations)|RSVP]] to the event. Then the host initiates Secret Santa game (the service randomly draws names and sends emails). The participants can anonymously send message or notify the host about sending or receiving a gift.
* [https://secret-santa.team Secret-Santa.team]: a Secret Santa application to start a Secret Santa with your team. Connect your application (Slack and Discord supported at the moment), select the participants and validates. The service will randomly draw users and send them a private message in their application to inform them of their peer name. Totally free, without ads, and no privacy data storage nor usage.
On the other hand there are communities like [https://www.redditgifts.com/ redditgifts] where you don't know the person for whom you buy a gift or from whom you receive a gift.

==Background==

=== Straight pride as an appeal to ridicule ===
{{see also|White pride}}

The concept of [[LGBT pride]] originates as a movement which seeks to [[Self-affirmation#Self-affirmation at the collective level|challenge the negative images]] of LGBT people&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/kameny_f,2.html|title=Kameny, Frank|website=glbtq.com}} "Kameny [...] coined the slogan 'Gay is Good'."&lt;/ref&gt; by being openly identified with a culturally [[Social stigma|stigmatized]] group; as such, it creates a discomfort.&lt;ref name="Shifting Sands"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eliason|first=Michele|author2=Schope, Robert |title=Shifting Sands or Solid Foundation? Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Identity Formation|journal=The Health of Sexual Minorities|year=2007|volume=1 |pages=3–26|doi=10.1007/97803873133441|doi-broken-date=2018-09-21}} "Not surprisingly, individuals in the pride stage are most criticized not only by heterosexual persons but also many LGBT individuals, who are uncomfortable forcing the majority to share the discomfort. Heterosexual individuals may express bewilderment at the term “gay pride,” arguing that they do not talk about “straight pride”".&lt;/ref&gt;

In this context, the terms ''straight pride'' and ''heterosexual pride'' exist as an argument criticizing gay pride as unnecessary, stating by contrast with [[heterosexuality]] that heterosexuals "don't talk about straight pride",&lt;ref name="Shifting Sands"/&gt; don't have "straight pride rallies",&lt;ref name="donthaveem"/&gt; and would be seen as ridiculous if they were to "band together and have a heterosexual pride [...] parade".&lt;ref name="kainz"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DRYkYduABiQC&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=%22heterosexual%20pride%22%20%22straight%20pride%22&amp;pg=PA39#v=onepage&amp;q=%22heterosexual%20pride%22%20%22straight%20pride%22&amp;f=false|author=[[Howard Kainz|Howard P. Kainz]]|title=Politically Incorrect Dialogues: Topics Not Discussed in Polite Circles|isbn=978-9042006867|year=1999}}, p.39. One of the two fictional philosophers in the dialogs states: "If, for example, heterosexuals were to band together and have a 'heterosexual pride' (or '"straight" pride') parade, it would be recognized immediately as dumb and ridiculous."&lt;/ref&gt;

This ''[[appeal to ridicule]]'' argument expresses the idea that showing pride for a homosexual orientation is equally absurd. Analysts of LGBT rights state as a counter-argument that mainstream culture offers many [[heteronormativity|approved social venues]] (weddings, baptism, family reunions...) for heterosexuals to express and celebrate their sexual orientation in public, while homosexuals usually feel isolated and [[pride parade]]s offer them support and an opportunity for socializing.&lt;ref name="donthaveem"/&gt;

=== Straight pride events ===
[[File:Man-and-woman-icon.svg|thumb|100px|right|An image often used on Straight Pride T-shirts]]
"Heterosexual pride" parades exist as a response to societal acceptance of LGBT visibility, and originated in campuses in the 1990s as a backlash tactic.&lt;ref name="Massachusetts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.massresistance.org/docs/downloads/romney/CommReport_Making_Colleges_Safe_7-93.pdf|title=Making colleges and universities safe for gay and lesbian students: Report and recommendations of the Governor's Commission on Gay and Lesbian Youth|publisher=Massachusetts. Governor's Commission on Gay and Lesbian Youth}}, p.20. "A relatively recent tactic used in the backlash opposing les/bi/gay/trans campus visibility is the so-called "heterosexual pride" strategy".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "ChicagoTribune1"/&gt;

Incidents where the slogan or concept of "Straight pride" caused controversy have occurred since the late 1980s. In 1988, for example, [[Vermont]] Republican John Burger asked the state's Governor to establish a "Straight Pride Day".&lt;ref name="vermont1988"/&gt;  In 1990, rallies in support of Straight Pride were held at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] (organized by the group Young Americans for Freedom) and nearby [[Mount Holyoke College]].&lt;ref name="straigh1"&gt;(6 May 1990). [https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/06/style/campus-life-umass-mount-holyoke-rallies-opposing-gay-students-disrupt-campuses.html Rallies Opposing Gay Students Disrupt Campuses], ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] organizations at [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] organized a "Straight Pride" rally attended by about 50 people and protested by a crowd estimated to be ten times larger.&lt;ref name="1991one"&gt;{{cite news|title=Campus Life: Massachusetts; Angry Gay Groups Drown Out Rally By Conservatives|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/10/nyregion/campus-life-massachusetts-angry-gay-groups-drown-out-rally-by-conservatives.html|accessdate=23 March 2012|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=10 March 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mayor agreed and set it for June 9.  Woytuik defended the proposal for Heterosexual Day by stating that "recognizing the contributions of heterosexuals is just as legitimate as recognizing the contributions of gay and lesbian communities."  The group seeking the Gay Pride Day designation was dismayed, asking if Black History Month would be partnered with White Heritage Month and whether days marking heart disease and strokes should be paired with days celebrating good health&lt;ref name = "Yellowknife" /&gt;  Woytuik's request for Heterosexual Day was widely reported on.  Shocked by the attention, he withdrew his request for the proclamation and apologized.

In light of previous anti-LGBT incidents, the school's principal ordered Chambers to remove the shirt, and a court case ensued.&lt;ref name="Ayres" /&gt;  A court upheld Chambers' complaint that his [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights had been violated, and that the principal's decision was unjustified.&lt;ref name="Ayres"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Ayres | first1 = Ian | last2 = Brown | first2 = Jennifer Gerarda | title = Straightforward: how to mobilize heterosexual support for gay rights (Google eBook) | publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 2005 | location = Princeton, NJ

In 2010, in response to local suicides amongst LGBT adolescents, an [[Ally Week]] was held at [[St. Charles North High School]] in [[St. Charles, Illinois]].

The back of these t-shirts displayed "[[s:Bible (King James)/Leviticus#Chapter 20|Leviticus 20:13]]", the verse stating that those who perform homosexual acts should be put to death.  While the school did not force the students to remove their t-shirts, it did persuade them to remove the bible quotation.  The following day two different students arrived wearing "Straight Pride" t-shirts minus the Bible quotations and were consequently asked to remove their shirts.&lt;ref name="dailyherald"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fuller|first=James|title=‘Straight Pride' shirts become free speech fight at St. Charles North|url=http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20101110/news/711119792/|accessdate=23 March 2012|newspaper=[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald]]|date=11 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = rightseducation&gt;&gt;http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/11/12/chicago-high-school-uses-straight-pride-shirts-rights-education/  Chicago High School Uses 'Straight Pride' Shirts for Rights Education

===Balancing freedom of expression vs. protection of students===

In school environments, straight pride expressions and events have been reviewed within a framework of balancing freedom of expression with protection of other students.  In some situations, schools take actions against students who are open about or encourage hiding homosexuality, or limit clothing that has references to sexual orientation.  Such may prompt lawsuits.&lt;ref name = SchoolLegal/&gt; In the  Minnesota Chambers v. Babbitt case, "The court noted that maintaining a school community of tolerance includes tolerance of such viewpoints as expressed by 'Straight Pride' as well as tolerance of homosexuality."&lt;ref name = SchoolLegal&gt;http://www.iog.unc.edu/pubs/electronicversions/pg/pgspsm06/article2.pdf Schools’  Legal Obligations to Gay Students by  Laurie L.

{{Sufism|Topics in Sufism}}
A '''tariqa''' (or ''tariqah''; {{lang-ar|[[:wikt:طريقة|طريقة]]}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|ṭarīqah}}'') is a school or order of [[Sufism]], or specifically a concept for the mystical teaching and spiritual practices of such an order with the aim of seeking ''[[Haqiqa]]'', which translates as "ultimate truth".

A tariqa has a ''[[murshid]]'' (guide) who plays the role of leader or spiritual director. The members or followers of a tariqa are known as ''[[Murid|muridin]]'' (singular ''murid''), meaning "desirous", viz. "desiring the knowledge of knowing [[God]] and loving God" (also called a ''[[Faqir]]'').

The metaphor of "way, path" is to be understood in connection of the term ''sharia'' which also has [[Sharia#Etymology and origins|the meaning of "path"]], more specifically "well-trodden path; path to the waterhole". The "path" metaphor of ''tariqa'' is that of a further path, taken by the mystic, which continues from the "well-trodden path" or exoteric of ''sharia'' towards the esoteric ''haqiqa''. A fourth "station" following the succession of ''shariah'', ''tariqa'' and ''haqiqa'' is called ''[[marifa]]''. This is the "unseen center" of ''haqiqa'', and the ultimate aim of the mystic, corresponding to the [[unio mystica]] in Western mysticism. ''Tasawwuf'', Arabic word that refers to mysticism and Islamic esotericism, is known in the West as Sufism.&lt;ref&gt;SILVA FILHO, Mário Alves da.

[[File:Syariah-thariqah-hakikah2.jpg|thumb|350px|'''"Tariqat" in the Four Spiritual Stations:''' The Four Stations are [[Sharia]], [[Ṭarīqah]], [[Haqiqa]], and the fourth station [[marifa]], which is considered "unseen" and actually located at ''the center'' of the ''haqiqa'' region. It's the essence of all four stations.]]

The most popular tariqa in the West is the [[Mevlevi Order]], named after [[Rumi|Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} In the same time the [[Bektashi Order]] was also founded, named after the [[Alevi]] Muslim saint [[Haji Bektash Veli]]. Four large tariqas in South Asia are: the [[Naqshbandi]] Order, named after [[Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari]]; the [[Qadiri]] Order, named after [[Abdul Qadir Jilani]]; the [[Chishti]] Order, named after Khawaja Mawdood Chisti while Khawaja [[Moinuddin Chishti]] is the most famous sheikh; the [[Suhrawardiyya|Suhrawardi]] Order, named after [[Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi]]. Large tariqats in Africa include [[Muridiyya]] and [[Tijaniyya]]. Others can be offshoots of a tariqa. For example, the [[Qalandariyya]] has roots in [[Malamatiyya]] (with [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]] influence) and Wafa'i (a combination of [[Ahmed Yesevi|Yasawiyya]]-[[Sunni]] and [[Batiniyya]]-[[Shia]]) of orders are offshoots of the [[Suhrawardiyya|Suhrawardi]] order. The [[Ashrafia]] after the 13 the century illustrious sufi saint [[Ashraf Jahangir Semnani]]&lt;ref&gt;'Hayate Makhdoom Syed [[Ashraf Jahangir Semnani]](1975), Second Edition(2017) {{ISBN|978-93-85295-54-6}}, Maktaba Jamia Ltd, Shamshad Market, Aligarh 202002,[[India]].&lt;/ref&gt; is the sub branch of Chisti spiritual lineage. The [[Tarika-e-Maizbhandari|Maizbhandari Tariqa]] or Maizbhandari Sufi Order is a liberated Sufism order established in the Bangladesh in the 19th century by the Gausul Azam Shah Sufi Syed Ahmadullah Maizbhandari (1826 AD − 1906 AD), 27th descendent of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad.

Membership of a particular Sufi order is not exclusive and cannot be likened to the ideological commitment to a political party. Unlike the Christian monastic orders which are demarcated by firm lines of authority and sacrament, Sufis often are members of various Sufi orders.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} The non-exclusiveness of Sufi orders has consequences for the social extension of Sufism. They cannot be regarded as indulging in a zero sum competition which a purely political analysis might have suggested. Rather their joint effect is to impart to Sufism a cumulant body of tradition, rather than individual and isolated experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Sufi martyrs of love By Carl W. Ernst, Bruce B. Lawrence. Pg 28&lt;/ref&gt;

In most cases the [[Sheikh (Sufism)|sheikh]] nominates his ''khalifa'' or "successor" during his lifetime, who will take over the order. In rare cases, if the sheikh dies without naming a ''khalifa'', the students of the tariqa elect another spiritual leader by vote. In some orders it is recommended to take a ''[[Khalif]]'' from the same order as the ''[[murshid]]''. In some groups it is customary for the khalifa to be the son of the sheikh, although in other groups the khalīfa and the sheikh are not normally relatives. In yet other orders a successor may be identified through the spiritual dreams of its members.

Tariqas have ''[[silsila]]s'' ({{lang-ar|سلسلة}}) "chain, lineage of sheikhs". Almost all orders except the [[Naqshbandi]] order claim a ''silsila'' that leads back to Muhammad through [[Ali]]. (The [[Naqshbandi]] Silsila goes back to [[Abu Bakr]], the first [[Caliph]] of [[Sunni Islam]], and then [[Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr]]. Historians however have traced this chain back to Ali as Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr was brought up by Ali from the age of three).

Every ''[[Murid]]'', on entering the tariqa, gets his ''[[Sama (Sufism)|awrad]]'', or daily recitations, authorized by his ''murshid'' (usually to be recited before or after the pre-dawn prayer, after the afternoon prayer and after the evening prayer). Usually these recitations are extensive and time-consuming (for example the ''awrad'' may consist of reciting a certain formula 99, 500 or even 1000 times). One must also be in a state of ritual purity (as one is for the obligatory prayers to perform them while facing Mecca). The recitations change as a student (murid) moves from a mere initiate to other Sufi degrees (usually requiring additional initiations). The Initiation ceremony is routine and consists of reading chapter 1 of the [[Quran]] followed by a single phrase prayer. Criteria have to be met to be promoted in rank: the common way is to repeat a single phrase prayer 82,000 times or more as in the case of [[Burhaniyya]], a number that grows with each achieved rank. Murids who experience unusual interaction during meditation: hear voices like "would you like to see a prophet?" or see visions who might even communicate with the Murid are held dear in the "[[Haḍra]]", the weekly group-chanting of prayers in attempt of reaching spirits as they are likely to experience something unusual and pass it on. This Murid is promoted faster than others. The least common way is to cause a miracle to happen with criteria similar to that of Catholic Sainthood.

Being mostly followers of the spiritual traditions of Islam loosely referred to as Sufism, these groups were sometimes distinct from the ''[[Ulema|Ulma]]'' or officially mandated scholars, and often acted as informal missionaries of Islam. They provided accepted avenues for emotional expressions of faith, and the Tariqas spread to all corners of the Muslim world, and often exercised a degree of political influence inordinate to their size (take for example the influence that the sheikhs of the [[Safavid]] had over the armies of [[Tamerlane]], or the missionary work of [[Ali-Shir Nava'i]] in [[Turkistan]] among the [[Mongol]] and [[Tatar]] people).
{{see|Silsila}}

==History==
The tariqas were particularly influential in the [[Islamization of Sudan|spread of Islam in the sub-Sahara]] during the 9th to 14th centuries, where they spread south along trade routes between North Africa and the sub-Saharan kingdoms of [[Ghana Empire|Ghana]] and [[Mali Empire|Mali]]. On the West African coast they set up Zawiyas on the shores of the river Niger and even established independent kingdoms such as ''al-Murabitun'' or [[Almoravids]]. The Al Hakika Mizaan Mizaani Sufi Order deals with heavy internalization and meditations, their spiritual practice is called Al Qudra Mizaan [(United States)]. The [[Senussi|Sanusi]] order were also highly involved in missionary work in Africa during the 19th century, spreading both Islam and a high level of literacy into Africa as far south as Lake Chad and beyond by setting up a network of ''[[Zawiya (institution)|zawiya]]s'' where Islam was taught. Much of [[central Asia]] and southern Russia was won over to Islam through the missionary work of the Tarīqahs, and the majority of [[Indonesia]]'s population, where a Muslim army never set foot, was converted to Islam by the perseverance of both Muslim traders and Sufi missionaries.

Tariqas were brought to China in the 17th century by [[Ma Laichi]] and other Chinese Sufis who had studied in [[Mecca]] and [[Yemen]], and had also been influenced by spiritual descendants of the [[Kashgar]]ian Sufi master [[Afaq Khoja]]. On the Chinese soil the institutions became known as ''[[menhuan]]'', and are typically headquartered near the tombs (''[[gongbei (Islamic architecture)|gongbei]]'') of their founders.&lt;ref name=dillon113&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Routledge |year=1999 |isbn=0-7007-1026-4 |title=China's Muslim Hui community: migration, settlement and sects |author= Michael Dillon |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=hUEswLE4SWUC |pages=113–114}} One of Dillon's main sources is: {{cite book |

Certain scholars, e.g., G. H. Jansen,{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} credit the original tariqas with several specific accomplishments:
* Preventing Islam from becoming a cold and formal doctrine by constantly infusing it with local and emotionally popular input, including stories and plays and rituals not part of Islam proper. (A parallel would be the role of [[Aesop]] relative to the [[Greek mythology|Greek mythos]].)
* Leading [[Muslim conquests|Islam's military and political battles]] against the [[Christian West]], as far back as the [[Qadiri]] order of the 12th century.

'''Tommaso Campailla''' (7 April 1668 – 7 February 1740) was an Italian philosopher, doctor, politician, poet and teacher.

Campailla was born in [[Modica]] in 1668 to the aristocratic family of Antonio and Adriana Giardina. When sixteen years old he studied law in [[Catania]], later following [[Autodidacticism|self-study]] after returning to Modica. His further studies included those in literature, [[Cartesianism|Cartesian]] philosophy, science, astronomy, and physics.&lt;ref name=Cristofolini&gt;Cristofolini, Paul; "[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=it&amp;u=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/tommaso-campailla_%28Dizionario_Biografico%29/&amp;prev=search Campailla, Thomas]" in ''Biographical Dictionary of Italians'' - Volume 17 (1974), [http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/istituto-della-enciclopedia-italiana/ Istituto della Enciclopedia Italiana]. Retrieved 30 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of his own ill heath led him to self-taught medical studies and self-healing practices and invented medical apparatus, particularly those with the use of [[Mercury (element)#Historic medicinal uses|mercury]]. He administered successfully as a physician in Modica, and taught other doctors, particularly in cures for [[syphilis]], although these were often "considered outlandish and questionable" by his contemporaries.&lt;ref name=Cristofolini/&gt;&lt;ref name=Museo&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=it&amp;u=http://ingegniculturamodica.ning.com/group/museotommasocampailla&amp;prev=search "Informazioni"], Museo Tommaso Campailla. IngegniCulturaModica. Retrieved 30 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt;    

As a writer, Campailla's most significant work, published 1709 and 1723, was the epic Cartesian-inspired poem ''The Adam'', of twenty verses describing a simple uncorrupt man discovering and contemplating truth through the help of archangel [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]]. Editions of the poem were sold in various parts of Italy, and in England.&lt;ref name=Cristofolini/&gt;
The poem was later dedicated to [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor]], and King of Sicily. The philosopher [[George Berkeley]] visited Modica and introduced Campailla to the works of [[Isaac Newton]] which afterwards became influential in Campailla's writings.&lt;ref name=TerraceCampailla&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=it&amp;u=http://www.terrazzecampailla.it/la-sala-museo/&amp;prev=search "The Museum Room"], Terrace Campailla. Retrieved 30 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  

Campailla was a friend to [[:scn:Girolama Lorefice Grimaldi|Girolama Lorefice Grimaldi]] (1681-1762), a poet who wrote in '[[Pastoral#Pastoral literature in general|Arcadian]]' style.{{cn|date=September 2015}}

Tommaso Campailla married and had issue, was reluctantly elected a senator seven times, and refused professorships for [[London]] and [[Padua]] through reluctance to travel. He died of a [[stroke]] aged 72, on 7 February 1740, and his body interred near the altar of Modica's [[Duomo of San Giorgio, Modica|Cathedral of St George]], with a plaque to his memory by the entrance.&lt;ref name=Cristofolini/&gt;&lt;ref name=TerraceCampailla/&gt;

The Museo Medico Tommaso Campailla, in Piazza Campailla, Modica, is named after Tommaso Campailla, and contains medical equipment he used, his [[anatomical theatre]], his medical volumes, and more recent photographs of the stages of syphilitic progression.&lt;ref name=Museo/&gt; His former home in Modica is today a restaurant.&lt;ref name=TerraceCampailla/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=it&amp;u=http://www.simoutique.com/museo-della-medicina-tommaso-campailla/&amp;prev=search "The Museum "Thomas Campailla" Modica: a journey through history and medicine"], SI-Moutique (identity system Modica).

His DPhil. thesis, entitled ''The View from Here: A First-person Constraint on Believing'' was completed in [[1998 in literature|1998]] at [[Oxford University]]. While finishing his thesis, Jones spent three years teaching philosophy at various colleges in Oxford.

Jones has published in the areas of [[epistemology]], [[ethics]], [[philosophy of mind]], [[aesthetics]], and metaphilosophy.

With a 1997 paper, 'Why Do We Value Knowledge', published in [[American Philosophical Quarterly]], he won regard as one of the early contributors to the nascent debate on the [[Meno|Meno problem]]. In collaboration with Samantha Vice, he has edited and contributed to ''Ethics at the Cinema'', which was published by [[Oxford University Press]] in 2010.

Turning to metaphilosophy in 2013, he completed a short manuscript, entitled 'Dissensus and the Value of Philosophy', on the value of philosophy to the non-philosopher'. It is currently under consideration at publishers.

He is currently co-editor of [[Philosophical Papers]], published by Routledge.

'''Won Hyo''' (617 – April 28, 686) was one of the leading thinkers, writers and commentators of the [[Korean Buddhism|Korean Buddhist]] tradition. [[Essence-Function]] ({{zh|c=體用}}), a key concept in [[East Asian Buddhism]] and particularly Korean Buddhism, was refined in the syncretic philosophy and [[world view]] of Wonhyo.&lt;ref&gt;Muller, Charles A. (1995). "The Key Operative Concepts in Korean Buddhist Syncretic Philosophy: Interpenetration (通達) and Essence-Function (體用) in Wŏnhyo, Chinul and Kihwa" cited in ''Bulletin of Toyo Gakuen University'' No. 3, March 1995, pp 33-48.Source: [http://www.acmuller.net/budkor/wonhyo-chinul-kihwa.htm] (accessed: September 18, 2008) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828072632/http://www.acmuller.net/budkor/wonhyo-chinul-kihwa.htm |date=August 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As one of the most eminent scholar-monks in Korean history, he was an influential figure in the development of the East Asian Buddhist intellectual and commentarial tradition. His extensive literary output runs to over 80 works in 240 fascicles, and some of his commentaries, such as those on the ''[[Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra]]'' and the ''[[Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana]]'', became classics revered throughout China and Japan as well as Korea. In fact, his commentary on the ''Awakening of Faith'' helped to make it one of the most influential and intensively studied texts in the East Asian Mahāyāna tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://glossary.buddhistdoor.com/word/16691/wonhyo |title=wonhyo - 佛門網 Buddhistdoor - 佛學辭彙 - Buddhist Glossary |publisher=Glossary.buddhistdoor.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese masters who were heavily influenced by Wonhyo include [[Fazang]], [[Li Tongxuan]], and [[Chengguan (monk)|Chengguan]]. The Japanese monks Gyonen, Zenshu and Joto of the [[Kegon]] school were also influenced by him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IYh9-Yl3cTkC&amp;pg=PA518&amp;lpg=PA518&amp;dq=Wonhyo+influenced+Fazang&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VYUeOcWcod&amp;sig=IF1KDIkw4g-r1MNTHn1UXVaqP5c&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6rELTca6DIOB8gaD-9ynDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Wonhyo%20influenced%20Fazang&amp;f=false |title=Sources Of East Asian Tradition: Premodern Asia - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With his life spanning the end of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] and the beginning of [[Unified Silla]], Wonhyo played a vital role in the reception and assimilation of the broad range of doctrinal Buddhist streams that flowed into the Korean peninsula at the time. Wonhyo was most interested in and affected by [[Buddha-nature]], [[East Asian Yogācāra]] and [[Hwaeom]] thought. However, in his extensive scholarly works, composed as commentaries and essays, he embraced the whole spectrum of the Buddhist teachings which were received in Korea, including such schools as [[Pure Land Buddhism]], [[East Asian Mādhyamaka]] and the [[Tiantai]].

==Biography==
[[File:Korea-Gyeongju-Bunhwangsa-Bogwangjeon hall-01.jpg|thumb|alt=|Bogwangjeon hall at [[Bunhwangsa]], [[Gyeongju]] which is a dedicated shrine to Wonhyo.]]
Wonhyo was born in Amnyang (押梁), nowadays the city of [[Gyeongsan]], [[North Gyeongsang Province]], [[South Korea]]. He had a son, [[Seol Chong]], who is considered to be one of the great [[Confucianism|Confucian scholars]] of [[Silla]].

Wonhyo was famous for singing and dancing in the streets. While the Buddha discouraged such behaviors, his songs and dances were seen as [[upaya]], or skillful means, meant to help save all sentient beings.

{{quote|[Wŏnhyo] tried to embody in his own life the ideal of a bodhisattva who works for the well-being of all sentient beings. Transcending the distinction of the sacred and the secular, he married a widower princess, visited villages and towns, and taught people with songs and dances.|Hee-Sung Keel&lt;ref&gt;Keel, Hee-Sung (2004). "Korea"; cited in Buswell, Robert E. (2004). ''Encyclopedia of Buddhism''. Volume 1. New York, USA: Macmillan Reference USA. {{ISBN|0-02-865719-5}} (Volume 1): pp.432&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He is thought to have founded Korea's lone riverside temple, [[Silleuksa]], in the late 600s. While Wonhyo was in [[Bunhwangsa]] (in modern Guhwang-dong, [[Gyeongju]]), he wrote a number of books. For such strong association with Wonhyo, a research center and a shrine named Bogwangjeon hall dedicated to Wonhyo's legacy are located in Bunhwangsa.&lt;ref&gt;(in Korean) [http://www.koreatemple.net/korea_temple/traditional_temple/history/view.asp?temple_seq=1002&amp;category_id=7&amp;content_id=732 분황사 창건과 역사 Establishment and History of Bunhangsa] Korea Temple&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contribution to commentarial tradition==
He wrote commentaries on virtually all of the most influential Mahayana scriptures, altogether including over eighty works in over two hundred fascicles. Among his most influential works were the commentaries he wrote on the ''Awakening of Faith'', ''Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra'' and ''[[Vajrasamadhi-sutra|Vajrasamādhi sūtra]]'', along with his exposition on the meaning of the two hindrances, the ''[[ijangui]]''. These were treated with utmost respect by leading Buddhist scholars in [[China]] and [[Japan]], and served to help in placing the ''Awakening of Faith'' as the most influential text in the Korean tradition.
{{quote|Wŏnhyo, commonly regarded as the greatest thinker in Korean Buddhism, was a prolific writer who produced no less than eighty-six works, of which twenty-three are extant either completely or partially. By his time, most of the important sūtras and treatises had flowed into Korea from China, and they were causing a great deal of confusion for Silla Buddhists, as they had for the Chinese. It was Wŏnhyo's genius to interpret all of the texts known to him in a way that would reveal their underlying unity of truth without sacrificing the distinctive message of each text. He found his hermeneutical key in the famous Mahāyāna text, the Awakening of Faith (Dasheng Qixin Lun).&lt;ref&gt;Keel, Hee-Sung (2004). "Korea"; cited in Buswell, Robert E. (2004). ''Encyclopedia of Buddhism''. Volume 1. New York, USA: Macmillan Reference USA. {{ISBN|0-02-865719-5}}, pp.431-432&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Teaching story==
Wonhyo spent the earlier part of his career as a monk. In 661 he and a close friend -  [[Uisang]] (625–702, founder of the [[Hwaeom]]) - were traveling to China where they hoped to study Buddhism further.  Somewhere in the region of [[Baekje]], the pair were caught in a heavy downpour and forced to take shelter in what they believed to be an earthen sanctuary. During the night Wonhyo was overcome with thirst, and reaching out grasped what he perceived to be a [[gourd]], and drinking from it was refreshed with a draught of cool, refreshing water. Upon waking the next morning, however, the companions discovered much to their amazement that their shelter was in fact an ancient tomb littered with human skulls, and the vessel from which Wonhyo had drunk was a human skull full of brackish water. Upon seeing this, Wonhyo vomited. Startled by the experience of believing that a gruesome liquid was a refreshing treat, Wonhyo was astonished at the power of the human mind to transform reality. After this "One Mind"&lt;ref&gt; 	Byeong-Jo Jeong; Wŏnhyo (2010). [http://www.koreanhero.net/Wonhyo/MasterWonhyo_Booklet.pdf Master Wonhyo: an overview of his life and teachings], Korean spirit and culture series, vol. 6, Seoul : Diamond Sutra Recitation Group, page 50&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bodhi|enlightenment]] experience, he abandoned his plan to go to China. He left the priesthood and turned to the spreading of the ''Buddhadharma'' as a layman. Because of this aspect of his character, Wonhyo ended up becoming a popular folk hero in Korea.&lt;ref&gt;Chun Ock-bae, 2010, "Why WonhyoNow?," ''The Korea Times'', April 16, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; An important result of his combined work with Uisang was the establishment of Hwaeom as the dominant stream of doctrinal thought on the [[Korean Peninsula]].

==English translation project ==
Wonhyo's twenty-three extant works are currently in the process of being translated into English as a joint project between [[Dongguk University]] and [[Stony Brook University]].  The [[University of Hawaii Press]] is publishing them in five volumes.&lt;ref name=stony_brook_publication&gt;{{cite web|title=Wonhyo Publication Project|url=http://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/korean/research/wonhyo.html|publisher=Stony Brook University, Center for Korean Studies|accessdate=2 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taekwondo sequence==
The [[International Taekwon-Do Federation]] [[Hyeong|pattern]] "Won-Hyo" is named in Wonhyo's honor. This pattern consists of 28 movements.

The [[World Taekwondo Federation]] has a [[Hyeong]] or pattern named Ilyeo for 9th Dan black belt which means the thought of the Buddhist priest of Silla Dynasty, Wonhyo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wtf.org/wtf_eng/site/about_taekwondo/poomsae.html WTF Poomsae]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Yutori education'''|ゆとり教育|yutori-kyōiku}} is a [[Education in Japan|Japanese education]] policy which reduces the hours and the content of the [[curriculum]] in [[primary education]]. In recent years, the mass media in Japan have used this phrase to criticize drops in scholastic ability.

== About ==
In [[Japan]], primary education is prescribed by a teaching guideline called {{nihongo|[[Curriculum guideline]]|学習指導要領|Gakushū shidō yōryō}}. Since the 1970s, the Japanese government gradually reduced the amount of class time and the contents given in the guideline, and this tendency is called yutori education. Especially in recent years, this has been a controversial issue.

Yutori education may be translated as "relaxed [[education]]" or "education free from pressure".

== History ==
In the 1970s, school [[violence]] and the collapse of [[Classroom management|classroom]] [[discipline]] became a big problem in junior high schools. So, the government revised the teaching guideline in 1977. The main purpose was to reduce education [[stress (biological)|stress]] and to introduce relaxed classes called {{nihongo|Rest Periods|ゆとりの時間|Yutori no jikan}}.

In 1984, during the time of [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Yasuhiro Nakasone]], the {{nihongo|'''Special Council for Education'''|臨時教育審議会|Rinji Kyōiku Shingikai}} was established as a consultative body. The council recommended that [[education]] regard the individual personalities of each student as paramount. Two major revisions of the teaching guidelines in 1989 and 1998 were implemented following this announcement.

In 1987, {{nihongo|'''the School Curriculum Council'''|教育課程審議会|Kyōiku Katei Shingikai}} declared four basic core principles to improve education in [[kindergarten]]s, [[Elementary schools in Japan|elementary schools]], and [[Secondary education in Japan|junior and senior high schools]].
# To form people with strength, confidence, and open minds.
# To create self-motivated students able to deal with changes in society.
# To teach the fundamental knowledge needed by Japanese people and to enrich education to ensure it considers individuality as very important.
# To form people who fully understand international society while still respecting [[culture of Japan|Japanese culture]] and traditions.

Under these principles, the teaching guideline were revised in 1989. In the lower grades of elementary schools, [[science]] and [[social studies]] classes were abolished and "[[environmental studies]]" was introduced. In junior high school, the number of elective classes was increased to further motivate students.

From 1992, schools closed on the second Saturday of every month to increase student spare time in accordance with the teaching guidelines. From 1995, schools closed on the fourth Saturday also.

In 1996, when the 15th {{nihongo|'''Central Council for Education'''|中央教育審議会|Chūō Kyōiku Shingikai}} was asked about what the Japanese education of the 21st century should be like, it submitted a report suggesting "the ability to survive" should be the basic principle of education. "The ability to survive" is defined as a principle that tries to keep the balance of [[Academic|intellectual]], [[Ethics|moral]], and [[physical education]].

In 1998, the teaching guidelines were revised to reflect the council's report. 30% of the curriculum was cut and "time for integrated study" in elementary and junior high school was established. It was a drastic change.

The School Curriculum Council stated its goals in a report.
# To enrich humanity, sociability, and the awareness of living as a Japanese within international society.
# To develop the ability to [[think]] and learn independently.
# To inculcate fundamental concepts in children at an appropriate pace while developing their individuality.
# To let every school form its own ethos.

Around 1999, a decline in the academic abilities of [[university]] students became a serious concern.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Elementary and secondary education started to be reconsidered. This trend focused criticism on the new teaching guidelines and aroused controversy.

In 2002, schools were no longer compulsory on Saturdays.

In 2007, a {{nihongo|''' National Scholarship Test for Elementary and Junior High School Students'''|全国小中学生学力テスト|Zenkoku Shōchūgakusei Gakuryoku Test}} was created.

== Criticism ==
Many people who oppose pressure-free education worry that it may lower children's scholastic ability, and also create a widening gap in scholastic ability. Some criticism is based on a misunderstanding of Yutori education.
* Japanese education performance test ([[PISA]]) results are not keeping pace internationally.
* Surveys of university students' [[math]] ability show very poor attainment.
* Yutori education may be good in principle but has not been implemented successfully.
* The workload of teachers has increased.
* Insufficient attention to educational fundamentals.
* If state schools are insufficient, children will need to go to a [[Juku]], which costs a great deal.
* [[Working class]] children will find it more difficult to progress to higher education and find good jobs.

== Responses ==

* The drop in scholastic ability is natural because the society is more affluent. Students in [[OECD]] nations are comfortable and less [[Motivation|motivated]].
* How should we define "scholastic ability?"
* Has scholastic ability really dropped?
* It is very difficult to judge scholastic ability objectively, so the results of tests don't necessarily indicate an overall drop in scholastic ability.
* Yutori education may reduce average scholastic ability, but it can develop the talents of a small number of [[gifted children]].
* The criticisms lack adequate [[evidence]].
* It is reported that achievement tests by the [[International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement|IEA]] and PISA both indicate Japanese students ability has continued to fall, but these two tests are different in what they intend to measure.
* The IEA mainly checks students' ability to recall facts while PISA checks their "ability to survive" and "ability to think". PISA's tests have been done only twice, and in the second test, countries participating increased. Moreover, in Japan, integrated studies were introduced in 2002, and PISA's test was done in 2003, so Japanese examinees had been under the new curriculum for only one year in junior high school. It is too early to determine whether integrated studies are successful.
