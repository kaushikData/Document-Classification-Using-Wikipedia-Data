'''''After Virtue''''' is a book on moral philosophy by [[Alasdair MacIntyre]].  MacIntyre provides a bleak view of the state of modern moral discourse, regarding it as failing to be rational, and failing to admit to being irrational.  He claims that older forms of moral discourse were in better shape, particularly singling out [[Aristotle]]'s [[moral philosophy]] as an exemplar.  ''After Virtue'' is among the most important texts in the recent revival of [[virtue ethics]].

The book was first published in 1981 and has since gone through two subsequent editions, which have added to, but not changed, the original text. The second edition, published in 1984, adds a postscript replying to critics of the first edition; the third edition, published in 2007, contains a new prologue entitled "''After Virtue'' After a Quarter of a Century".

==Summary==
MacIntyre holds that ''After Virtue'' makes seven central claims.&lt;ref&gt;Alasdair MacIntyre, "The Claims of ''After Virtue''", in Kelvin Knight (ed.), ''The MacIntyre Reader'' (University of Notre Dame Press, 1998), 69-72.&lt;/ref&gt; It begins with an [[allegory]] suggestive of the premise of the science-fiction novel ''[[A Canticle for Leibowitz]]'': a world where all sciences have been dismantled quickly and almost entirely. MacIntyre asks what the sciences would look like if they were re-assembled from the remnants of scientific knowledge that survived the catastrophe. 

He claims that the new sciences, though superficially similar to the old, would in fact be devoid of real scientific content, because the key suppositions and attitudes would not be present. "The hypothesis which I wish to advance," he continues, "is that in the actual world which we inhabit the language of morality is in the same state of grave disorder as the language of natural science in the imaginary world which I described."&lt;ref name=AV&gt;Alasdair MacIntyre, ''After Virtue: A Study in Moral Theory'' (University of Notre Dame Press, 1984, 2nd edn.), 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, MacIntyre applies this hypothesis to advance the notion that the moral structures that emerged from [[the Enlightenment]] were philosophically doomed from the start because they were formed using the aforementioned incoherent language of morality. MacIntyre claims that this failure encompasses the work of many significant Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment moral philosophers, including [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Immanuel Kant]], and [[David Hume]]. These philosophers "fail because of certain shared characteristics deriving from their highly specific historical background."&lt;ref name=AV/&gt;{{rp|51}} That background is the Enlightenment's abandonment of [[Aristotelianism]], and in particular the Aristotelian concept of [[teleology]]. 

Ancient and [[Scholasticism|medieval ethics]], argues MacIntyre, relied wholly on the teleological idea that human life had a proper end or character, and that human beings could not reach this natural end without preparation. Renaissance science rejected Aristotle's teleological [[physics]] as an incorrect and unnecessary account, which led Renaissance philosophy to make a similar rejection in the realm of ethics. But shorn of teleology, ethics as a body of knowledge was expurgated of its central content, and only remained as, essentially, a vocabulary list with few definitions and no context. With such an incomplete framework on which to base their moral understanding, the philosophers of the Enlightenment and their successors were doomed from the beginning.

MacIntyre illustrates this point through an example of a people who, he argues, experienced a similar incoherence in their own moral and ethical tradition: the [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] people of the [[Oceania|South Pacific]] and their [[Tapu (Polynesian culture)|taboos]]. [[King Kamehameha II]] removed the taboos of the people in order to modernize their society and met little if any resistance.  The Polynesians had no issue with abandoning their long-standing cultural traditions and MacIntyre claims this is because the taboos, though once meaningful to the islanders, had been shorn over the centuries of their underlying spiritual and didactic purpose, becoming a set of arbitrary prohibitions. The fact that Kamehameha II could abolish them so easily and without opposition is evidence, MacIntyre argues, of their incoherence. A similar incoherence, he argues, bedevils the ethical project since the Enlightenment.

Another reason MacIntyre gives for the doomed nature of the Enlightenment is the fact that it ascribed moral agency to the individual. He claims this made morality no more than one man's opinion and, thus, philosophy became a forum of inexplicably [[Subjectivity|subjective]] rules and principles. The failure of the Enlightenment Project, because of the abandonment of a teleological structure, is shown by the inadequacy of moral [[emotivism]], which MacIntyre believes accurately reflects the state of modern morality.

MacIntyre offers a critique of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], whom he calls the "King Kamehameha II of the European tradition," in reference to the Polynesian allegory above.&lt;ref name=AV/&gt;{{rp|113}} MacIntyre explains that, "[[Nietzschean]] man, the [[Übermensch]], [is] the man who transcends, finds his good nowhere in the social world to date, but only that in himself which dictates his own new law and his own new table of the virtues."&lt;ref name=AV/&gt;{{rp|257}} Although he disagreed with Nietzsche's inegalitarian and elitist view of humankind, he acknowledged the validity of Nietzsche's critique of Enlightenment morality as an explanation of the latter's degeneration into [[emotivism]], and that, like Kamehameha II, Nietzsche had identified the moral imperatives of his time as arbitrary and incoherent in demanding their abolition. 

The nineteenth-century critic who has most lastingly and profoundly influenced MacIntyre is not Nietzsche but Marx—indeed, ''After Virtue'' originates in MacIntyre's plans to write a book repairing the moral weaknesses of [[Marxism]].&lt;ref name=AV/&gt;{{rp|ix–x}} His critique of [[capitalism]], and its associated [[Liberalism|liberal]] ideology and bureaucratic state (including what, in ''After Virtue'', he condemned as the [[state capitalism]] of the USSR) is not expressed in traditional Marxist terms. Instead, it is written as a defence of ordinary social "practices", and of the "goods internal to practices". Pursuit of these helps to give narrative structure and intelligibility to our lives, but these goods must be defended against their corruption by "institutions", which pursue such "external goods" as money, power and status (chapters 14-15).

MacIntyre seeks to find an alternative to Nietzsche's philosophy and eventually concludes that only classic Aristotelian thought can hope to save Western humanity. While Nietzsche seems to include the Aristotelian ethics and politics in his attack on the "degenerate disguises of the will to power,"&lt;ref name=AV/&gt;{{rp|127}} MacIntyre claims that this cannot be done due to important differences between the structure and assumptions of Aristotelian and post-Enlightenment philosophy. These include:
*Aristotle's assumption that man is as-he-happens-to-be and that this is distinct from man-as-he-should-be. The Enlightenment, on the other hand, offers no metaphysical framework whatsoever in place of teleology.
*Aristotle's claim that rules are based on virtues, which are derived from an understanding of the [[Telos (philosophy)|telos]]. The Enlightenment reversed this and predicated virtues on an understanding of subjective (but purported to be universal) principles.
*Aristotle's assertion that virtue and morality are integral parts of society, as an understanding of the telos must be social and not individual. In the Enlightenment, however, societies lost their [[moral authority]] and the individual became the fundamental interpreter of moral questions.

MacIntyre opposes Nietzsche's return to the aristocratic ethics of [[Homeric]] Greece with the teleological approach to ethics pioneered by Aristotle. Nietzsche's critique of Enlightenment moral theory does not work against a [[teleological ethics]]. For MacIntyre, "Nietzsche replaces the fictions of the Enlightenment individualism, of which he is so contemptuous, with a set of individualist fictions of his own."&lt;ref name=AV/&gt;{{rp|129}}  Nietzsche's Uebermensch, his solution to the lies of the Enlightenment, exposes the failure of the Enlightenment's [[epistemological]] project and of its search for a subjective yet universal morality.  Nietzsche neglects the role of society in the formation and understanding of tradition and morality, and "Nietzsche's great man cannot enter into relationships mediated by appeal to shared standards or virtues or goods; he is his own only moral authority and his relationships to others have to be exercises of that authority... it will be to condemn oneself to that moral solipsism which constitutes Nietzschean greatness."&lt;ref name=AV/&gt;{{rp|258}}

''After Virtue'' ends by posing the question 'Nietzsche or Aristotle?', although MacIntyre acknowledges that the book does not give sufficient grounds for a definitive answer that it is Aristotle, not Nietzsche, who points to the best solution for the problems that the book has diagnosed. Those grounds are set out in MacIntyre's subsequent works, in which he elaborates a sophisticated revision of the philosophical tradition of [[Aristotelianism]].

In the end, however, MacIntyre tells us that we are waiting not for [[Waiting for Godot|Godot]] but for [[Benedict of Nursia]]. MacIntyre criticizes individualist political philosophy, such as [[John Rawls]]' ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' and [[Robert Nozick]]'s ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]''. To MacIntyre, morals and virtues can only be comprehended through their relation to the community in which they come from. Whereas Rawls tells us to conceive of justice through abstracting ourselves from who we are (through the veil of ignorance, for example) MacIntyre disagrees. Running throughout ''After Virtue'' is the belief that in order to comprehend who we are, we must understand where we come from.

==Reception==

[[George Scialabba]] found ''After Virtue'' to be a strong critique of modernity, but claimed that MacIntyre "faltered" at the conclusion of the argument, when he sketched the features of what virtuous life should be like in the conditions of modernity.&lt;ref&gt;George Scialabba's [http://www.georgescialabba.net/archive/000226.php review] of ''After Virtue''&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Scialabba objected to MacIntyre's claim that the good life for human beings consists in contemplating the good life for human beings; Scialabba found this insufficient and anticlimactic. Scialabba also argued that, although he appreciated MacIntyre's insistence on participation in community life as the best defense against the perils of modernity, this insistence was not justified with any discussion of how community life can be reconciled with the critical spirit that Scialabba finds to be one of the great achievements of modernity and of the philosophical enterprise.

In a review for ''Political Theory'', William E. Connolly argues that MacIntyre sees Nietzsche as "the adversary to be defeated, but Nietzsche's voice is not heard clearly". Connolly objects that MacIntyre's defense of virtue does not take into account Nietzsche's critique; MacIntyre also fails to build an account of ''telos'' that does not draw on biology in the way MacIntyre wanted to avoid—such a theory doesn't account for the fact that we are embodied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Connolly | first1 = W. E. | title = After Virtue | journal = Political Theory | volume = 10 | issue = 2 | pages = 315–319 | doi =  10.2307/190582| year = 1982 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthony Ellis, in the journal ''[[Philosophy (journal)|Philosophy]]'', argued that MacIntyre's positive philosophical project is not explained as well as it could have been: it is "of daunting opacity, though tantalizingly interesting" but not given enough space in the book. Ellis also states that the discussion of Rawls and Nozick in ''After Virtue'' "is slight and assertive".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ellis | first1 = A. | title = After Virtue: A Study in Moral Theory | journal = Philosophy | volume = 57 | issue = 222 | pages = 551–553 | doi =  10.2307/4619611| year = 1982 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Review of Metaphysics]]'', Christos Evangeliou said that if the reader "had expected to find in this book concretely how a revived Aristotelian tradition is supposed to work in order to shape ethically and rationally the irrational and disorderly modern world", they "may be a little disappointed in their expectations".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Evangeliou | first1 = C. | title = After Virtue | journal = The Review of Metaphysics | volume = 37 | issue = 1 | pages = 132–134 | doi =  10.2307/20127983| year = 1983 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francis Wheen]] included a brief critique of ''After Virtue'' in his own book ''How Mumbo-Jumbo Conquered the World''. The thrust of Wheen's book was a defense of the principles of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] against various strands of [[irrationalism]], and Wheen identified ''After Virtue'' and MacIntyre as constituting one such strand. In general, critics{{Like whom?|date=November 2017}} identified Wheen's disparagement of MacIntyre as one of ''Mumbo-Jumbo''{{'s}} few missteps. While MacIntyre certainly is a fierce critic of the Enlightenment, Wheen refused to engage MacIntyre's case but dismissed his work on the grounds that any objection to the Enlightenment qualified as "mumbo-jumbo" ''ex hypothesi''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A59099-2004Jun21.html footnote&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aleksandr Gelyevich Dugin''' ({{lang-rus|Алекса́ндр Ге́льевич Ду́гин}}; born 7 January 1962) is a Russian philosopher, [[political analyst]], and strategist known for his [[Fascism|fascist]] views.&lt;ref&gt;"Classification of Dugin as a fascist is justified, regardless of the fact that today the MGU professor frequently speaks not as a primitive ethnocentrist or biological racist. ( ... ) By «fascist» we understand the «generic» meaning of the concept, used in comparatory research of contemporary right-wing extremism by such well-known historians-comparativists as Alexandr Galkin (Moscow), Walter Laqueur (Washington), Stanley Payne (Madison), Wolfgang Wippermann (Berlin) or Roger Griffin (Oxford)", {{cite web | url=http://inosmi.ru/politic/20120622/193954633.html | title="Евразийские" проекты Путина и Дугина – сходства и различия |trans-title=Dugin's "Eurasian" projects − similarities and differences | publisher=Geopolitika (Lithuania) | date=22 June 2012 | accessdate=31 August 2015 | author=Андреас Умланд}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In a 1999 interview for a Polish "Fronda" Dugin explains: "In [[Russian Orthodox]] christianity a person is a part of the Church, part of the collective organism, just like a leg. So how can a person be responsible for himself? Can a leg be responsible for itself? Here is where the idea of state, total state originates from. Also because of this, Russians, since they are Orthodox, can be the true fascists, unlike artificial Italian fascists: of Gentile type or their Hegelians. The true [[Hegelianism]] is Ivan Peresvetov – the man who in 16th century invented the ''[[oprichnina]]'' for [[Ivan the Terrible]]. He was the true creator of Russian fascism. He created the idea that state is everything and an individual is nothing".

He is the author of more than 30 books, among them ''[[Foundations of Geopolitics]]'' (1997) and ''[[The Fourth Political Theory]]'' (2009).

==Early life and education==
Dugin was born in Moscow, into the family of a colonel-general in the [[GRU|Soviet military intelligence]] and [[Candidate of Science|candidate of law]] Geliy Alexandrovich Dugin and his wife Galina, a doctor and candidate of medicine.&lt;ref name=Literaturnaya&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.litrossia.ru/2007/15/01412.html |script-title=ru:Доктор Дугин |publisher=Литературная Россия |accessdate=18 March 2012 |language=Russian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022031837/http://www.litrossia.ru/2007/15/01412.html |archivedate=22 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, he entered the [[Moscow Aviation Institute]], but did not graduate due to his association with thinking contrary to the ongoing regime, which caused him to be expelled from the institute.

A self-taught polyglot, he read avidly in his fields of interest, from Middle Age and Renaissance European authors to Oriental Studies, translating into Russian from English, French, and German, and also the writings of Italian fascist [[Julius Evola]] and French author [[René Guénon]]. [[Traditionalist School|Religious Traditionalism]], Conservatism, [[Hermeticism]] and Poetry were topics followed closely by Dugin and a group of philosophers/thinkers also interested in Traditionalism: [[Geydar Dzhemal]], Evgeniy Golovin, Yuri Mamleev, Vladimir Stepanov, and Sergey Jigalkin.

He graduated in Economics and Management at [[Novocherkassk]] Meliorative State Academy in the [[Rostov Oblast]] in 1999, defending his post-graduate degree in Philosophy at [[Rostov-on-Don]] with the dissertation "The Evolution of Paradigmatic Foundations of Science" in 2000, and the PhD in the Faculty of Sociology at the same University in 2004 with the theme "The Transformation of the Political Structures and Institutions in the Process of Modernization of the Civil Society". In 1998, Dugin, Geydar Dzhemal, and Evgeniy Golovin created a study center based on their long time shared interests called the New University project.

In 1988 he and his friend [[Geydar Dzhemal]] joined the nationalist group [[Pamyat]]. He helped to write the political program for the newly refounded [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]] under the leadership of [[Gennady Zyuganov]].&lt;ref name=Dunlop /&gt;

In his 1997 article "Fascism – Borderless and Red", Dugin proclaimed the arrival of a "genuine, true, radically revolutionary and consistent, fascist fascism" in Russia. He believes that it was "by no means the racist and chauvinist aspects of [[National Socialism]] that determined the nature of its ideology. The excesses of this ideology in Germany are a matter exclusively of the Germans ... while Russian fascism is a combination of natural national conservatism with a passionate desire for true changes."&lt;ref name="Andreas"&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Andreas Umland]] |title=Will United Russia become a fascist party? |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/will-united-russia-become-a-fascist-party.aspx?pageID=438&amp;n=will-united-russia-become-a-fascist-party-2008-04-15 |work=[[Hürriyet Daily News]] |date=15 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Waffen-SS]] and especially the scientific sector of this organization, [[Ahnenerbe]]," was "an intellectual oasis in the framework of the National Socialist regime", according to him."&lt;ref name="Andreas" /&gt;

Dugin soon began publishing his own journal entitled ''Elementy'', which initially began by praising Franco-Belgian [[Jean-François Thiriart]], supporter of a Europe "from Dublin to Vladivostok". Consistently glorifying both [[Tsar]]ist and [[Joseph Stalin|Stalinist]] Russia, ''Elementy'' also revealed Dugin's admiration for [[Julius Evola]].  Dugin also collaborated with the weekly journal ''Den'' (The Day), a bastion of [[Rootless cosmopolitan|Russian anti-Cosmopolitanism]]{{clarify|date=April 2016}} previously directed by [[Alexander Prokhanov]].&lt;ref name="Dunlop" /&gt;

Dugin was amongst the earliest members of the [[National Bolshevik Party]] (NBP) and convinced [[Eduard Limonov]] to enter the political arena in 1994. A part of hard-line nationalist NBP members, supported by Dugin, split off to form the more right-wing, anti-liberal, anti-left, anti-[[Garry Kasparov|Kasparov]]{{clarify|date=April 2016}} aggressive nationalist organization, [[National Bolshevik Front]]. After breaking with Limonov, he became close to [[Yevgeny Primakov]] and later to [[Vladimir Putin]]'s circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jeffrey |last=Mankoff |title=Russian Foreign Policy: The Return of Great Power Politics |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |year=2009 |pages=66–67}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dugin claims to be disapproving of [[liberalism]] and the West, particularly [[American hegemony]].&lt;ref name="BBC 2014"&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ru:Дугин хочет с помощью Путина прояснить свой статус в МГУ|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/russian/russia/2014/06/140630_dugin_msu_university_dismissal|publisher=[[BBC Russian Service]]|date=30 June 2014|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; His assertions show that he likes [[Stalin]] and the [[Soviet Union]]: "We are on the side of Stalin and the Soviet Union".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Иван Зуев|script-title=ru:Александр Дугин: Уроки религии – это великая победа над русофобами|url=http://www.nakanune.ru/articles/16845|publisher=Nakanune.ru|language=Russian|date=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He calls himself a conservative and says, "We, conservatives, want a strong, solid State, want order and healthy family, positive values, the reinforcing of the importance of religion and the Church in society". He adds, "We want patriotic radio, TV, patriotic experts, patriotic clubs. We want the media that expresses national interests".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Дугин|script-title=ru:Мы должны забрать у либералов как минимум половину медийного поля!|url=http://www.nakanune.ru/articles/16946/|publisher=Nakanune.ru|language=Russian|date=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formation of the Eurasia Movement===
The [[Eurasia Party]], later [[Eurasia Movement]], was officially recognized by the Ministry of Justice on 31 May 2001.&lt;ref name="Dunlop"/&gt; The Eurasia Party claims support by some military circles and by leaders of the Orthodox Christian faith in Russia, and the party hopes to play a key role in attempts to resolve the [[Chechnya|Chechen]] problem, with the objective of setting the stage for Dugin's dream of a Russian strategic alliance with European and Middle Eastern states, primarily Iran. Dugin's ideas, particularly those on "a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]]-[[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] alliance in the Eurasian sphere" have recently become popular among certain nationalistic circles in Turkey, most notably among alleged members of the [[Ergenekon network]], which is the subject of a high-profile trial (on charges of conspiracy).{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Dugin's Eurasianist ideology has also been linked to his adherence to the doctrines of the [[Traditionalist School]]. (Dugin's Traditionalist beliefs are the subject of a book length study by J. Heiser, ''The American Empire Should Be Destroyed—Aleksandr Dugin and the Perils of Immanentized Eschatology.''&lt;ref name="Heiser"&gt;{{cite book|author=James D. Heiser|title=The American Empire Should Be Destroyed: Alexander Dugin and the Perils of Immanentized Eschatology|publisher=Repristination Press|isbn=1891469436}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Dugin also advocates for a Russo-Arab alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Megah Stack |date=4 September 2008 |title=Russian nationalist advocates Eurasian alliance against the U.S. |url=http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fgw-dugin4-2008sep04-story.html |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |location= California |access-date=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This common civilizational impulse will be the basis of a political and strategic union.|author=''[[The Basics of Geopolitics]]'' (1997)}}

The reborn Russia, according to Dugin's concept, is said by Charles Clover of the ''[[Financial Times]]'' to be a slightly remade version of the Soviet Union with echoes of ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' by [[George Orwell]], where [[Eurasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eurasia]] was one of three continent-sized super states including [[Eastasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eastasia]] and [[Oceania (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Oceania]] as the other two and was participating in endless war between them.&lt;ref name="Clover"/&gt;

In the Eurasian public discourse sphere, the totalitarian communist policy deployed in over three decades of works by various international groups that are part of the movement, is "a version of reintegration of the post-Soviet space into a "Eurasian" sphere of influence for Russia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=RAND |date=2017 |title=Russian Views of the International Order |url=https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1826.html |access-date=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The North-American program "works with a wide range of partners from all sectors of civil society" and "is advanced through grant making, advocacy and research, regional initiatives, and close engagement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=OSF |title=Eurasia Program |url=https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/about/programs/eurasia-program |access-date=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has criticized the "Euro-Atlantic" involvement in the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2004|2004 Ukrainian presidential election]] as a scheme to create a "[[cordon sanitaire]]" around Russia, much like the [[Border states (Eastern Europe)|French and British attempt]] post-[[World War I]].

In 2005, Dugin founded the [[Eurasian Youth Union]] of Russia as the youth wing of the International Eurasia Movement.&lt;ref name="The Daily Beast"&gt;{{cite web|title=Alexander Dugin: The Crazy Ideologue of the New Russian Empire|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/04/02/alexander-dugin-the-crazy-ideologue-of-the-new-russian-empire.html|work=The Daily Beast|date=4 February 2014}} In Russian: {{cite web|author1=Арсентий Тропаревский|script-title=ru:Дугин: Сумасшедший гений новой Российской империи|url=http://theinternettimes.ru/post/dugin_geniy|work=The Internet Times|language=Russian}}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before [[2008 South Ossetia war|war broke out]] between Russia and Georgia in 2008, Dugin visited South Ossetia and predicted, "Our troops will occupy the Georgian capital Tbilisi, the entire country, and perhaps even Ukraine and the Crimean Peninsula, which is historically part of Russia, anyway."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Road to War in Georgia: The Chronicle of a Caucasian Tragedy|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/road-to-war-in-georgia-the-chronicle-of-a-caucasian-tragedy-a-574812.html|newspaper=[[Der Spiegel]]|date=25 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards he said Russia should "not stop at liberating South Ossetia but should move further," and "we have to do something similar in Ukraine."&lt;ref name="Interview"&gt;{{cite web|author=Alexander Dugin|url=http://www.echo.msk.ru/programs/personalno/532383-echo/|title=Interview|publisher=[[Echo of Moscow]]|date=8 August 2008|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Dugin stated that Russia should repeat the Georgian scenario in Ukraine, namely attack it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ірина Біла|script-title=uk:Можливість застосування Ющенком силового сценарію; махінації навколо землі.

===Russian Orthodoxy and Rodnovery===

Dugin was [[baptism|baptized]] at the age of six in the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] church of [[Michurinsk]] by his great-grandmother Elena Mikhailovna Kargaltseva. Since 1999, he formally embraced a branch of the [[Old Believers]], a Russian religious movement which rejected the 1652–1666 [[Old Believers#Reforms of Patriarch Nikon|reforms]] of the official [[Russian Orthodox Church]].{{sfnp|Laruelle|2006|p=11}} Dugin's Eurasian philosophy owes much to [[Traditionalist School|Traditional Integralism]] and ''[[Nouvelle Droite]]'' movements, and as such it resonates with [[Neopaganism]],{{sfnp|Laruelle|2006|pp=11–14}} a category which in this context means the movement of [[Slavic Native Faith]] (Rodnovery), especially in the forms of [[Anastasianism]] and [[Ynglism]]. Dugin's Eurasianism is often cited as belonging to the same spectrum of these movements,&lt;ref&gt;[[Marat Shterin]] (2016). "[https://g2w.eu/zeitschrift/leseprobe/1250-attraktivitaet-und-dilemma-neue-religioese-bewegungen-in-russland Attraktivität und Dilemma: Neue religiöse Bewegungen in Russland]". ''RGOW'', 2. Institut G2W – Ökumenisches Forum für Glauben, Religion und Gesellschaft in Ost und West. p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as also having influences from [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]], [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] and [[Eastern religions|Eastern]] traditions.{{sfnp|Laruelle|2006|p=15}} He himself calls to rely upon "Eastern theology and mystical currents" for the development of the [[The Fourth Political Theory|Fourth Political Theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Aleksandr Dugin. ''The Fourth Political Theory''. Arktos, 2012. p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Marlene Laruelle]], his adherence to the Old Believers allows him to stand between Paganism and Orthodox Christianity without formally adopting either of them. His choice is not paradoxical, since, according to him — in the wake of [[René Guénon]] —, Russian Orthodoxy and especially the Old Believers have preserved an [[esotericism|esoteric]] and initiatory character which was utterly lost in Western Christianity. As such, the Russian Orthodox tradition may be merged with Neopaganism and may host "Neopaganism's nationalist force, which anchors it in the Russian soil, and separates it from the two other Christian confessions".{{sfnp|Laruelle|2006|p=11}}

===Esotericism, fascism, and integrative geopolitics===

In the early 1990s Dugin's work at the [[National Bolshevik Front]] included research into the roots of national movements and the activities of [[Esotericism in Germany and Austria|supporting esoteric groups]] in the first half of the 20th century. Partnering [[Christian Bouchet]],&lt;ref&gt;The Ordo Templi Orientis Phenomenon.

===Stance on Ukraine and role in Russian politics===

Aleksandr Dugin supports Putin and his foreign policies but has opposed Russian governments due to their economic policies. His 2007 quote, "There are no more opponents of Putin's course and, if there are, they are mentally ill and need to be sent off for clinical examination. Putin is everywhere, Putin is everything, Putin is absolute, and Putin is indispensable" – was voted number two in flattery by readers of ''[[Kommersant]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kommersant.ru/Tests/Test10.aspx|script-title=ru:Кто похвалит его лучше всех|trans-title=Who will praise him better than the rest|language=ru|work=Kommersant|date=2007|accessdate=24 March 2016}} (Click the "Results" ("Результаты") button at the bottom of the page)&lt;/ref&gt;

Dugin stated he was disappointed in [[Russian President]] [[Vladimir Putin]], saying that Putin did not aid the pro-Russian insurgents in Ukraine after the [[Ukrainian Army]]'s [[2014 insurgency in Donbass#Post-ceasefire government offensive|early July 2014 offensive]].&lt;ref name=DOUPOU/&gt; In August 2014, Dugin called for a "genocide" of Ukrainians.&lt;ref name=FT150128&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/a87747de-a713-11e4-b6bd-00144feab7de.html |title= Alarm bells ring over Syriza's Russian links |first= Sam |last= Jones |first2= Kerin |last2= Hope |first3= Courtney |last3= Weaver |work= [[Financial Times]] |date= 28 January 2015 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Halya Coynash of the [[Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group]] said that the influence of Dugin's "Eurasian ideology" on events in eastern Ukraine and on Russia's invasion of the Crimea was beyond any doubt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Halya Coynash|title=Intrigue over 'dismissal' of Putin's ideologue, Alexander Dugin|url=http://khpg.org.ua/en/index.php?id=1404029911|publisher=[[Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group]]|date=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Vincent Jauvert, Dugin's radical ideology today became the basis for the internal and foreign policy of the Russian authorities.&lt;ref name="Jauvert"&gt;{{cite news|author=Vincent Jauvert|title=Le Raspoutine de Poutine|url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/ukraine-la-revolte/20140503.OBS6009/le-raspoutine-de-poutine.html|work=[[Le Nouvel Observateur]]|date=3 May 2014|language=French}} In Russian: {{cite web|author=Венсан Жовер|script-title=ru:Дугин — путинский Распутин|url=http://inosmi.ru/russia/20140512/220188170.html|publisher=[[inoSMI]]|language=Russian|date=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; So Dugin is worth listening to, in order to understand to which fate the Kremlin is leading its country and the whole of Europe.&lt;ref name="Jauvert"/&gt; However, according to [[Alexander Nevzorov]], if we had had [[Sergey Kurginyan|Kurginyan]] and Dugin instead of Putin, there would have been hell for all of us to pay, they would have unleashed a European and World War without a shadow of a doubt, without considering consequences at all.&lt;ref name="Быков"/&gt; But Dugin and Kurginyan do not have the slightest impact on what is going on in the Kremlin and do not even get coaching there.&lt;ref name="Быков"/&gt; In another publication, Nevzorov said, "Beliefs are only proven by being under bullets, another prescription does not exist. I do not understand why [[Vitaly Milonov|Milonov]] and Dugin are not there yet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ru:Невзоров: Я не понимаю, почему Милонов и Дугин до сих пор не под пулями|url=http://www.rosbalt.ru/piter/2014/06/16/1280845.html|publisher=Rosbalt.ru|language=Russian|date=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 October 2014, Dugin said, "Only after restoring the Greater Russia that is the [[Eurasian Union]], we can become a credible global player. Now these processes slowed down very much. The [[Euromaidan|Ukrainian maidan]] was the response of the West to the advance of the Russian integration."&lt;ref name="Медведева"/&gt; He described the [[Euromaidan]] as a coup d'état carried out not by the Ukrainians but by the United States: "America wishes to wage the war against Russia not by its own hands but by the hands of the Ukrainians. Promising to wink at up to 10 thousand victims among the peaceful population of Ukraine and actually demanding the victims, the United States led to this war. The United States carried out the coup d'état during the maidan for the purpose of this war. The United States raised [[neo-Nazis]] [[Russophobes]] to the power for the purpose of this war."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Руслан Горевой|script-title=ru:На пороге войны|url=http://versia.ru/articles/2014/jun/30/na_poroge_voyny|work=Газета "Версия"|issue=24|date=30 July 2014|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dugin said Russia is the major driving force for the current events in Ukraine, "Russia insists on its sovereignty, its liberty, responds to challenges thrown down to it, for example, in Ukraine. Russia is attempting to integrate the post-Soviet space ..."&lt;ref name="Медведева"/&gt; As Israeli political scientist Vyacheslav Likhachov states, "If one seriously takes the fact that such a person as Alexander Dugin is the ideologist of the imperial dash for the West, then one can establish that Russia is not going to stop as far as the Atlantic Ocean."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Юрій Савицький|script-title=uk:Путін є найбільшим радикалом Росії – ізраїльський експерт|url=http://www.radiosvoboda.org/content/article/26599384.html|publisher=[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]|language=Ukrainian|date=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2014 article by [[Dmitry Bykov]] "Why TV, Alexander Dugin and Galina Pyshnyak crucified a boy", [[Channel One Russia]]'s use of the aired story by Dugin and Pyshnyak about the allegedly crucified boy as a pretext for escalating the conflict was compared to the case of [[Menahem Mendel Beilis|Beilis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Дмитрий Быков|script-title=ru:Зачем ТВ, Александр Дугин и Галина Пышняк распяли мальчика|url=http://sobesednik.ru/dmitriy-bykov/20140715-dmitriy-bykov-zachem-tv-aleksandr-dugin-i-galina-pyshnyak-ra|publisher=Sobesednik.ru|language=Russian|date=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 July 2014, Dugin on his Facebook account wrote a story that a 6 year old child was allegedly nailed down to an advertisement board and shot to death before his father's eyes.&lt;ref name="Епифанова"&gt;{{cite news|author=Мария Епифанова|script-title=ru:И это — не предел?|url=http://www.novayagazeta.ru/politics/64440.html|work=[[Novaya Gazeta]]|issue=77|date=16 July 2014|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 July 2014, ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'' provided a videotape of its correspondent Eugen Feldman walking along the main square in [[Sloviansk]], asking local old women if they had heard of the murder of the child. They said such an event did not take place.&lt;ref name="Епифанова"/&gt; The website [[Change.org]] hosted a petition of citizens who demanded "a comprehensive investigation with identification for all persons involved in the fabrication of the plot."&lt;ref name="Епифанова"/&gt;

On 2 October 2014, Dugin described the situation in Donbass: "The [[humanitarian crisis]] has long since been raging on the territory of [[Federal State of Novorossiya|Novorossiya]]. Already up to a million, if not more, refugees are in the Russian Federation. A large part of the inhabitants of the [[Donetsk People's Republic|DPR]] and the [[Lugansk People's Republic|LPR]] simply moved abroad."&lt;ref name="заговор"/&gt; In the end of October 2014, Dugin advised the separatists to establish dictatorship in Novorossiya until they win in the confrontation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ru:Новости "Новороссии": для достижения победы Дугин рекомендует террористам диктатуру|url=http://joinfo.ua/politic/1041112_Novosti-Novorossii-dostizheniya-pobedi-Dugin.html|publisher=Joinfo.ua|language=Russian|date=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rhetoric about the fifth column===
The typical rhetoric about the [[fifth column]] as [[foreign agent]]s is used by Dugin for political accusations in many publications. In his 2014 interview published by ''[[Vzglyad (newspaper)|Vzglyad]]'' and ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]'', he says, "A huge struggle is being conducted. And, of course, Europe has its own fifth column, its own [[2011–13 Russian protests|Bolotnaya Square]]-minded people. And if we have them sitting idly and doing nasty things on [[Dozhd]], Europe is indeed dominated and ruled by the fifth column in full swing. This is the same American riffraff ..."&lt;ref name="великая война"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Петр Акопов|script-title=ru:Это великая война континентов|url=http://www.vz.ru/politics/2014/2/20/672632.html|work=[[Vzglyad (newspaper)|Vzglyad]]|date=20 February 2014|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KP"&gt;{{cite news|script-title=ru:Политолог, философ Александр Дугин: Это великая война континентов|url=http://www.kp.ru/daily/26197.4/3084361/|work=[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]|date=20 February 2014|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sees the United States standing behind all the scenes, including the Russian fifth column, according to his statement, "The danger of our fifth column is not that they are strong, they are absolutely paltry, but that they are hired by the greatest 'godfather' of the modern world—by the United States. That is why they are effective, they work, they are listened to, they get away with anything because they have the world power standing behind them."&lt;ref name="великая война"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KP"/&gt; He sees the American embassy as the center for funding and guiding the fifth column and asserts, "We know that the fifth column receives money and instructions from the American embassy."&lt;ref name="заговор"&gt;{{cite web|author=Александр Дугин|script-title=ru:Против Путина готовится заговор, мы наблюдаем либеральный ответ Русской весне|url=http://www.nakanune.ru/articles/19518/|publisher=Nakanune.ru|date=2 October 2014|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dugin, the fifth column promoted the breakup of the [[Soviet Union]] as a land continental construction, seized power under [[Boris Yeltsin]], and headed Russia as the ruling politico-economic and cultural elite until the 2000s; the fifth column is the regime of liberal reformers of the 1990s and includes former [[Russian oligarchs]] [[Vladimir Gusinsky]], [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]], former government officials [[Mikhail Kasyanov]], [[Boris Nemtsov]], [[Vladimir Ryzhkov]], artistic, cultural, and media workers,&lt;ref name="Шестая"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Александр Дугин|script-title=ru:Шестая колонна|url=http://vz.ru/opinions/2014/4/29/684247.html|work=[[Vzglyad (newspaper)|Vzglyad]]|date=29 April 2014|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Echo of Moscow]], the [[Russian State University for the Humanities]], the highest ranks of the [[National Research University Higher School of Economics]], a significant part of teachers of the [[Moscow State Institute of International Relations]], and a minority part of teachers of the [[Moscow State University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |author1=Александр Дугин|title=Пятая колонна и либеральная идеология: аномалия вседозволенности |trans-title=The fifth column and liberal ideology: an anomaly of permissiveness|url=http://eurasiainform.md/pyataya-kolonna-i-liberalnaya-ideologiya-anomaliya-vsedozvolennosti-aleksandr-dugin.html|publisher=Eurasiainform.md|language=Russian|date=24 March 2014|access-date=4 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729212858/http://eurasiainform.md/pyataya-kolonna-i-liberalnaya-ideologiya-anomaliya-vsedozvolennosti-aleksandr-dugin.html|archive-date=29 July 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dugin proposes to deprive the fifth column of Russian citizenship and deport the group from Russia: "I believe it is necessary to deport the fifth column and deprive them of their citizenship."&lt;ref name="Макаревич"&gt;{{cite web|author=Елена Янкелевич|script-title=ru:Андрей Макаревич: "пятая колонна" или жертва травли?|url=http://riafan.ru/56800-andrey-makarevich-pyataya-kolonna-ili-zhertva-travli/|publisher=Riafan.ru|language=Russian|date=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2007, Dugin argued, "There are no longer opponents of Putin's policy, and if there are, they are mentally ill and should be sent to prophylactic health examination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Максим Соколов|script-title=ru:Путин абсолютен|trans-title=Putin is absolute|url=http://izvestia.ru/news/329407|work=[[Izvestia]]|date=5 October 2007|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Григорий Пасько|script-title=ru:Шизофрения, или Будьте здоровы!|trans-title=Schizophrenia, or To your health!|journal=[[Index on Censorship]]|year=2007|issue=27|url=http://index.org.ru/journal/27/pask27.html|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Dugin in an interview to ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' confirmed that he considers the opponents of Putin to be mentally ill.&lt;ref name="Neef"/&gt;

In one of his publications, Dugin introduced the term ''the sixth column'' and defined it as "the fifth column which just pretends to be something different",&lt;ref name="Шестая"/&gt; those who are in favor of Putin, but demand that he stand for liberal values (as opposed to the liberal fifth column, which is specifically against Putin). During the [[2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine]], Dugin said that all the Russian sixth column stood up staunchly for Ukrainian oligarch [[Rinat Akhmetov]].&lt;ref name="За Ахметова"&gt;{{cite web|author=Александр Дугин|script-title=ru:За Ахметова грудью встала российская шестая колонна|url=http://www.nakanune.ru/news/2014/5/21/22353563/|publisher=Nakanune.ru|language=Russian|date=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he asserts, "We need to struggle against the fifth and sixth columns."&lt;ref name="Медведева"&gt;{{cite web|author=Татьяна Медведева|script-title=ru:Александр Дугин: "Нужно бороться с "шестой колонной"|url=http://portal-kultura.ru/articles/person/64670-aleksandr-dugin-nuzhno-borotsya-s-shestoy-kolonnoy/|work=Газета "Культура"|issue=35|language=Russian|date=10–16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian-American artist [[Mihail Chemiakin]] says Dugin is inventing "the sixth column". "Soon, probably, there would already be the seventh one as well. "The fifth column" is understandable. That is we, intelligentsia, lousy, dirty, who read [[Albert Camus|Camus]]. And "the sixth column", in his opinion, is more dangerous, because that is the personal entourage of Vladimir Putin. But he is naive and understands nothing. And as for Dugin, he can tell him who to shoot to death and who to imprison. Maybe, [[Alexey Kudrin|Kudrin]] and maybe, [[Dmitry Medvedev|Medvedev]] ...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Виктор Резунков|script-title=ru:Попахивает фашизмом|url=http://www.svoboda.org/content/article/26646237.html|publisher=[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]|language=Russian|date=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

According to Dugin, the whole Internet should be banned: "I think that Internet as such, as a phenomenon is worth prohibiting because it gives nobody anything good."&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|74QT-Wcgjbs|God is against Internet (Dugin's speech in Russian)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2012, Dugin said in a lecture that chemistry and physics are demonic sciences, and that all Orthodox Russians need to unite around the President of the Russian Federation in the last battle between good and evil, following the example of Iran and North Korea.&lt;ref name="Гольянов"&gt;{{cite web|author=Владислав Гольянов|script-title=ru:Владимир Путин как спаситель от "сатанинского" Запада|url=http://www.baltinfo.ru/2012/06/13/Vladimir-Puti-kak-spasitel-ot-sataninskogo-Zapada-284483|publisher=Baltinfo.ru|language=Russian|date=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added, "If we want to liberate ourselves from the West, it is needed to liberate ourselves from textbooks on physics and chemistry."&lt;ref name="Гольянов"/&gt;

Dugin has characterized his position on the Ukrainian conflict as "firm opposition to the Junta and Ukrainian Nazism that are annihilating peaceful civilians" as well as unacceptance of liberalism and American hegemony.&lt;ref name="lenta.ru"/&gt;

==Loss of department headship==
During the conflict in Ukraine, Dugin also lost his post as Head of the Department of Sociology of International Relations of [[Moscow State University]].&lt;ref name=DOUPOU&gt;{{cite news|author1=Ben Hoyle|title=Putin accused of betraying and abandoning Ukraine separatists|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/putin-accused-of-betraying-and-abandoning-ukraine-separatists/story-fnb64oi6-1226976223365|work=[[The Australian]]|date=3 July 2014}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite news|title=Rebel leaders in Ukraine feel 'abandoned' by Putin|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/rebel-leaders-in-ukraine-feel-abandoned-by-putin/story-fnb64oi6-1226976988427|work=[[The Australian]]|date=4 July 2014}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite news|author=Paul Sonne|title=Russian Nationalists Feel Let Down by Kremlin|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-nationalists-feel-let-down-by-kremlin-again-1404510139|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=4 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fitzpatrick2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fitzpatrick|first1=Catherine A|title=Russia This Week: Dugin Dismissed from Moscow State University?

==Legal cases against Dugin==
At the end of October 2014, [[Sergey Kurginyan]], the leader of all-Russian movement [[Essence of Time (movement)|Essence of Time]], sued Dugin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ru:Дугин: Кургинян подал на меня в суд, а я бы вызвал его на дуэль|url=http://www.rosbalt.ru/moscow/2014/10/28/1332014.html|publisher=Rosbalt.ru|language=Russian|date=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; because Dugin called Kurginyan a traitor and accused him of destroying [[Donetsk People's Republic|DPR]] deputy foreign minister Proselkov in the following words: "Possessed supporters of traitor Kurginyan, who as now it turns out is working for [[Russian oligarchs|oligarchs]], [[Yukos]] and Israel, declared Sasha Proselkov "main enemy" after he along with Gubarev did not allow denigrating Russian hero [[Igor Girkin|Igor Strelkov]] with impunity."

An '''alphanumeric grid''' (also known as '''atlas grid'''&lt;ref&gt;http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/atlas+grid Retrieved 2010-03-22.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a simple [[coordinate system]] on a [[Grid (spatial index)|grid]] in which each cell is identified by a combination of a letter and a number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.esri.com/index.cfm?fa%3Dknowledgebase.gisDictionary.search%26search%3Dtrue%26searchTerm%3Dalphanumeric+grid |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010070525/http://support.esri.com/index.cfm?fa=knowledgebase.gisDictionary.search |archivedate=2007-10-10 |df= }} Retrieved 2010-03-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

An advantage over numeric coordinates, which use two numbers instead of a number and a letter to refer to a grid cell, is that there can be no confusion over which coordinate refers to which direction. As an easy example, one could think about battleship; simply match the number at the top to the number on the bottom, then follow the two lines until they meet in a spot.


[[Algebraic chess notation]] uses an alphanumeric grid to refer to the squares of a [[chessboard]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fide.com/fide/handbook?id=125&amp;view=article ''Appendices'' in [[FIDE|World Chess Federation]] Handbook: see part ''C.7'' of section ''C.

[[Image:Heterojunction variables in equilibrium.png|300px|thumb|right|[[Band diagram]]s for a straddling-gap type heterojunction, as understood by Anderson's rule. The junction alignment at equilibrium (bottom) is predicted based on a hypothetical flat-vacuum alignment (top).]]
'''Anderson's rule''' is used for the construction of [[energy band diagram]]s of the [[heterojunction]] between two [[semiconductor material]]s. Anderson's rule states that when constructing an energy band diagram, the [[vacuum level]]s of the two semiconductors on either side of the heterojunction should be aligned (at the same energy).&lt;ref&gt;Borisenko, V. E. and Ossicini, S. (2004). ''What is What in the Nanoworld: A Handbook on Nanoscience and Nanotechnology''. Germany: Wiley-VCH.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also referred to as the '''electron affinity rule''', and is closely related to the [[Schottky-Mott rule]] for [[metal-semiconductor junction]]s. 

Anderson's rule was first described by R. L. Anderson in 1960.&lt;ref name="Anderson1960"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anderson|first1=R. L.|title=Germanium-Gallium Arsenide Heterojunctions [Letter to the Editor]|journal=IBM Journal of Research and Development|volume=4|issue=3|year=1960|pages=283–287|issn=0018-8646|doi=10.1147/rd.43.0283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the vacuum levels are aligned it is possible to use the [[electron affinity]] and [[band gap]] values for each semiconductor to calculate the [[conduction band]] and [[valence band]] offsets.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, J. H., (1997). ''The Physics of Low-Dimensional Semiconductors''. UK: [[Cambridge University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; The electron affinity (usually given by the symbol &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt; in [[solid state physics]]) gives the energy difference between the lower edge of the conduction band and the [[vacuum level]] of the semiconductor.  The band gap (usually given the symbol &lt;math&gt;E_{\rm g}&lt;/math&gt;) gives the energy difference between the lower edge of the conduction band and the upper edge of the valence band. Each semiconductor has different electron affinity and band gap values. For semiconductor [[alloys]] it may be necessary to use [[Vegard's law]] to calculate these values.

Once the relative positions of the conduction and valence bands for both semiconductors are known, Anderson's rule allows the calculation of the [[band offset]]s of both the valence band (&lt;math&gt;\Delta E_{\rm v}&lt;/math&gt;) and the conduction band (&lt;math&gt;\Delta E_{\rm c}&lt;/math&gt;).
After applying Anderson's rule and discovering the bands' alignment at the junction, [[Poisson’s equation]] can then be used to calculate the shape of the [[band bending]] in the two semiconductors.

=== Example: straddling gap ===

Consider a heterojunction between semiconductor 1 and semiconductor 2. Suppose the conduction band of semiconductor 2 is closer to the vacuum level than that of semiconductor 1. The conduction band offset would then be given by the difference in electron affinity (energy from upper conducting band to vacuum level) of the two semiconductors:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta E_{\rm c} = (\chi_{2} - \chi_{1})\,&lt;/math&gt;

Next, suppose that the band gap of semiconductor 2 is large enough that the valence band of semiconductor 1 lies at a higher energy than that of semiconductor 2. Then the valence band offset is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta E_{\rm v} = (\chi_{\rm 1} + E_{\rm g1}) - (\chi_{\rm 2} + E_{\rm g2})\,&lt;/math&gt;

==Limitations of Anderson's rule==

{{details|topic=other models of heterojunction band alignment|Heterojunction}}

In real semiconductor heterojunctions, Anderson's rule fails to predict actual band offsets.
In Anderson's idealized model the materials are assumed to behave as they would in the limit of a large vacuum separation, yet where the vacuum separation is taken to zero.
It is that assumption that involves the use of the vacuum [[electron affinity]] parameter, even in a solidly filled junction where there is no vacuum.
Much like with the [[Schottky-Mott rule]], Anderson's rule ignores the real [[chemical bonding]] effects that occur with a small or nonexistent vacuum separation: interface states which may have a very large electrical [[polarization density|polarization]] and defect states, dislocations and other perturbations caused by imperfect crystal lattice matches.

To try to improve the accuracy of Anderson's rule, various models have been proposed.
The ''common anion rule'' guesses that, since the valence band is related to anionic states, materials with the same anions should have very small valence band offsets.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}
Tersoff&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=J. Tersoff|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.30.4874|title=Theory of semiconductor heterojunctions: The role of quantum dipoles|year=1984|journal=Physical Review B|volume=30|issue=8|pages=4874|bibcode = 1984PhRvB..30.4874T }}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed the presence of a [[dipole]] layer due to induced gap states, by analogy to the [[metal-induced gap states]] in a [[metal-semiconductor junction]].
Practically, heuristic corrections to Anderson's rule have found success in specific systems, such as the ''60:40 rule'' used for the GaAs/AlGaAs system.&lt;ref name="Debbar"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.40.1058|title=Conduction-band offsets in pseudomorphic InxGa1-xAs/Al0.2Ga0.8As quantum wells (0.07≤x≤0.18) measured by deep-level transient spectroscopy|year=1989|last1=Debbar|first1=N.|last2=Biswas|first2=Dipankar|last3=Bhattacharya|first3=Pallab|journal=Physical Review B|volume=40|issue=2|pages=1058|bibcode = 1989PhRvB..40.1058D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Aponia'''" ({{lang-grc|ἀπονία}}) means the absence of [[pain]], and was regarded by the [[Epicureans]] to be the height of bodily pleasure.

As with the other [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic schools of philosophy]], the [[Epicureans]] believed that the goal of human life is [[happiness]]. The Epicureans defined pleasure as the absence of pain (mental and physical), and hence pleasure can only increase until the point in which pain is absent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reale|1985|pp=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond this, pleasure cannot increase further, and indeed one cannot rationally seek bodily pleasure beyond the state of ''aponia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Furley|1999|pp=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Epicurus]], ''aponia'' was one of the static (''katastematic'') pleasures,&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, x. 136&lt;/ref&gt; that is, a pleasure one has when there is no want or pain to be removed.&lt;ref name="Annas1995"&gt;{{Harvnb|Annas|1995|pp=336}}&lt;/ref&gt; To achieve such a state, one has to experience kinetic pleasures, that is, a pleasure one has when want or pain is being removed.&lt;ref name="Annas1995" /&gt;

In the 1960s to 1970s, [[kente cloth]] and the Black Panthers uniform were worn in the U.S. as expressions of black pride.&lt;ref name="Hurst2015" /&gt; Headscarves were sometimes worn by [[Nation of Islam]] and other Black Muslim Movement members as an expression of black pride and a symbol of faith.&lt;ref name="Craig" /&gt; Other women used scarves with African prints to cover their hair.&lt;ref name="Hurst2015" /&gt;

[[Maxine Leeds Craig]] argues that all-black beauty pageants such as [[Miss Black America]] were institutionalized forms of black pride created in response to exclusion from white beauty pageants.&lt;ref name="Craig" /&gt;

===Brazil===
The black pride movement is very prevalent in [[Brazil]], especially throughout the poorer population, and it is found in the Brazilian [[funk]] music genre that began arose in the late 1960s, as also in [[funk carioca]], that emerged in the late 1980s. Both the origin of Brazilian funk and funk carioca reflects Brazilian black resistance. Ethnomusicologist George Yúdice states that youths were engaging black culture mediated by a U.S. culture industry met with many arguments against their susceptibility to cultural colonization. Although it borrows some ingredients from [[hip hop]], its style still remains unique to Brazil (mainly Rio de Janeiro and also São Paulo).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yúdice|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jamaica===
Black pride has been a central theme of the originally [[Jamaica]]n [[Rastafari movement]] since the second half of the 20th century. It has been described as "a rock in the face of expressions of white superiority."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/rastafari/history/slavery.shtml Rastafari and slavery]&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The slogan has been used in the [[United States]] by [[African Americans]] to celebrate heritage&lt;ref name="Tyson2001" /&gt; and personal pride. The black pride movement is closely linked with the developments of the [[civil rights movement]] and [[Black Power movement]]&lt;ref name="Glasker2009" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vahistorical.org/collections-and-resources/virginia-history-explorer/civil-rights-movement-virginia/rising-black |title=Rising Black Consciousness |publisher=[[Virginia Historical Society]] |quote=As the civil rights movement gained ground, removing the stigma of inferiority not only in schools but throughout society, black pride increased. |accessdate=February 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which opposed the conditions of the United States' segregated society, and lobbied for better treatment for people of all races.

The availability of '''bomb-making instruction on the Internet''' has been a [[cause célèbre]] amongst lawmakers and politicians anxious to curb the [[Internet]] frontier by [[Internet censorship|censoring]] certain types of information deemed "dangerous" which is available online. "Simple" examples of explosives created from cheap, readily available ingredients are given.&lt;ref&gt;Horgan, John. "The Psychology of Terrorism", p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] reports that there were 1,699 criminal bombings in 1989 and 3,163 in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=75LraX59rXcC&amp;pg=PT136&amp;dq=instructions+on+the+internet+Bomb-making&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=14#v=onepage&amp;q=instructions%20on%20the%20internet%20Bomb-making&amp;f=false ''The psychology of terrorism'', John Horgan, Routledge, 2005] {{ISBN|0-7146-5262-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moral philosophy==
Supporters of [[digital rights]] argue that managers of Internet traffic do not have a right to [[deep packet inspection]], the automated system of analyzing what information is being transmitted, for example refusing to deliver a packet with the words "bomb instructions" and alerting authorities to the [[ISP]] that requested the information.&lt;ref&gt;Stair, Ralph M. et al. "Principles of Information Systems", p. 275&lt;/ref&gt; They suggest that "we never seem to hear" about how the same instructions, including those for building nuclear devices,&lt;ref name="anna"/&gt; have been available in [[public library|public libraries]] for decades without calls for censorship.&lt;ref name="omgitswikiquotingwiki"&gt;[[Mike Godwin|Godwin, Mike]]. "Cyber Rights: Defending Free Speech in the Digital Age", p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th century, [[Johann Most]] compiled Austrian military documents into a booklet demonstrating the use of explosives and distributed it at anarchist picnics without repercussion.&lt;ref name="anna"&gt;Anna Larabee, "Bombs: It's Not the How, but the Why," Star-Telegram, August 7, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mike Godwin]], then of the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], claimed that journalists have played a key role in linking the creation of "bombs" with "the Internet" in the public conscious.&lt;ref name="omgitswikiquotingwiki"/&gt;

Critics of the prosecution of [[Sherman Austin]], an American anarchist charged with publishing instructions on the Internet, have pointed out that the [[Wikipedia]] article on [[Molotov cocktail]]s contains more detailed instructions on the construction of homemade explosives, than Austin's website did.&lt;ref name="cas"&gt;Caslon Analytics, [http://www.caslon.com.au/bombsnote1.htm Bomb info] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015121015/http://www.caslon.com.au/bombsnote1.htm |date=October 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Touretzky, David S. [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/raisethefist/ What the FBI Doesn't Want You to See]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most American websites offering bomb-making instructions would not face [[civil liability]], since ''[[Hess v. Indiana]]'' and ''[[Waller v. Osbourne]]'' determined that [[free speech]] restrictions can only be applied if the goal was "producing [[Imminent lawless action|imminent lawless conduct]]" among a single target group – which is not the case for a website available to a large swath of the population – making the situation comparable to music advocating violence or suicide in its lyrics.&lt;ref name="mtt"&gt;Weissblum, Lonn. [http://www.mttlr.org/volsix/Weissblum_art.html#VA Incitement to violence on the world wide web] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706020742/http://www.mttlr.org/volsix/Weissblum_art.html#VA |date=July 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Internet}}
In 1986, prior to the widespread use of the Internet, police investigated the sharing of a computer print-out from a digital manual titled the "Complete Book of Explosives" written by a group calling itself "Phoenix Force", as students shared the list with classmates and experimented with building many of the bombs it listed.&lt;ref name="hern"&gt;Hegarty, Stephen. [[Hernando TImes]], "Bomb-making instructions circulate in Pasco school", November 13, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1995 [[Oklahoma City bombing]], anonymous [[usenet]] posts criticised the construction of the bomb, and offered suggestions on how to overcome the failure of the bomb to do its maximum intended damage.&lt;ref name="steger"/&gt; On March 23, 1996, the full text of the ''Terrorist Handbook'' was published online, including instructions on building the bomb used in the bombing, with the suggested upgrades.&lt;ref name="steger"&gt;Steger, Manfred B. "Violence and Its Alternatives", p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Mohammed Usman Saddique]] was arrested in 2006, he was charged with "possessing a document or record containing information of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism" for having a copy of the manual on [[CD-ROM]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Daily Telegraph]], [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/7080258/Terror-suspect-had-bomb-making-manuals-court-told.html Terror suspect had bomb-making manuals, court told], January 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1994, a thread was made on the [[National Rifle Association]]'s [[bulletin board]] by a user named ''Warmaster'' that detailed how to make bombs out of [[baby food]] jars.&lt;ref name="steger"/&gt;

A 1996 copy of the left-wing online German magazine ''Radikal'' hosted on a Dutch server provided detailed instructions of how to sabotage railroad lines.&lt;ref name="COE"/&gt; In March of that year, a [[New South Wales]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] called for legislation regarding internet access for youth, following reports of a boy injuring himself while trying to follow a bomb recipe online.&lt;ref&gt;Everard, Jerry. "Virtual States: The Internet and the Boundaries of the Nation-State"&lt;/ref&gt;

Through 1998, the common view of the instructions was that they were used by curious youth anxious to build explosives simply as a dangerous experiment "with no intention of hurting anybody".&lt;ref&gt;Tri City Herald, "Bomb making instructions on internet", October 2, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversy over the availability of this information on the internet started as a result of the [[Columbine High School Shooting]]. Also, police claim that they found printed copies of bomb-making instructions downloaded from the Internet in the bedroom of Anthony "T.J." Solomon, the perpetrator of the 1999 [[Heritage High School shooting]].&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Mark Harrison. "Deadly Lessons: Understanding Lethal School Violence", p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1999, [[David Copeland]] planted nail bombs in London, killing 3 people and injuring 139, based on techniques discussed in ''The Terrorist's Handbook'' and ''How to Make Bombs:  Part Two'', which he had downloaded from the internet.&lt;ref name=terr&gt;{{cite book|last=Weimann |first=Gabriel |title=Terror on the Internet: the new arena, the new challenges|publisher=US Institute of Peace Press|date=2006|isbn=1-929223-71-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=19iCbNOoYmIC&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq=instructions+on+the+internet+Bomb-making&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=instructions%20on%20the%20internet%20Bomb-making&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The militant [[anti-abortion]] movement [[Army of God (USA)|Army of God]] also provided information on constructing bombs in preparation for [[anti-abortion violence]] on their website.&lt;ref&gt;Karafin, Michael. [[Ball State Daily News]], "Inflammatory news dangerous, irresponsible", January 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, journalists discovered that [[al-Qaeda]] members in Afghanistan had been using the internet to learn bomb-making techniques.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kzAnYBVwLYoC&amp;dq=instructions+hamas+internet+Bomb-making&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Hate and bias crime: a reader''], p. 367, Barbara Perry, Routledge, 2003, {{ISBN|0-415-94408-2}}, accessed February 23, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In Finland in 2002, "RC" discussed bomb-making techniques on the internet on a Finnish website whose moderator displayed a picture of his own face on [[Osama bin Laden]]'s body, and then [[Myyrmanni bombing|RC set off a bomb that killed seven people, including himself.]]&lt;ref name=terr/&gt;

In 2002, New Zealander Bruce Simpson published '' The Low Cost Cruise Missile; A looming threat?'' showing readers how they could construct a [[cruise missile]] for under $5,000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://aardvark.co.nz/pjet/cruise.shtml The Low Cost Cruise Missile], Bruce Simpson, 20 May, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=3505296 Boffin builds backyard missile], ''New Zealand Herald'', 4 June, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Jeremy Parker of the Southern Knights of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] posted detailed bomb instructions on the internet in response to [[Martin Luther King Jr. Day]], stating "sure would hate to see anything happen".&lt;ref&gt;[[Southern Poverty Law Center]], [http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2009/spring/ku-klux-klan Ku Klux Klan]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The report "How to Bomb Thy Neighbor:  Hamas Offers Online 'Academy'" describes a [[Hamas]] online interactive 14-lesson course for Muslims on bomb-making, as part of a campaign to increase the number of bomb-makers.&lt;ref name=terr/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WMZdR8XPzQoC&amp;dq=instructions+hamas+internet+Bomb-making&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''The World's Most Threatening Terrorist Networks and Criminal Gangs''], p. 159, Michael T.

In 2004, a Palestinian group posted an online video showing the proper construction of [[suicide vest]]s, hoping to support the [[Iraqi insurgency (Iraq War)|Iraqi insurgency]].&lt;ref&gt;Myers, Lisa.

The 2004 [[Madrid train bombings|Madrid train bombers]], who killed 191 people and wounded 1,800, downloaded their bomb-making instructions from the internet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,432133,00.html "Al-Qaida's Online University; Jihad 101 for Would-Be Terrorists," ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', August 17, 2005, accessed February 23, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian [[Saad Khalid]] admitted that he had downloaded bomb-making materials online in 2006, leading to the [[2006 Toronto terrorism case]].&lt;ref&gt;Gillespie, Bill. [[Canadian Broadcasting Centre|CBC]], [http://www.cbc.ca/radioshows/WORLD_REPORT/20090623.shtml Radio Show Log], June 23, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

British student [[Isa Ibrahim]] made a suicide vest bomb using instructions he found online. He planned on exploding the device at a mall. He was sentenced in July 2009 to a minimum of ten years in jail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/europe/british-student-learnt-bomb-making-on-net Sapsted, David, "British student ‘learnt bomb-making on net’", The National, June 13, 2009, accessed February 28, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Najibullah Zazi]], an al-Qaeda member who pleaded guilty in February 2010 to a plot to bomb the [[New York City Subway]] system, searched online for information on how to build a bomb and where to buy the parts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2009/09/24/Terror-suspect-indicted-for-conspiracy/UPI-98191253798162/ "Terror suspect indicted for conspiracy", UPI, September 24, 2009, accessed February 28, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, [[Dianne Feinstein]] produced a bill to the [[United States Senate]] making it illegal to distribute bomb-making information, punishable by a $250,000 fine and 20 years' imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/842- Feinstein Amendment SP419]&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, the body voted 94–0 in favor of implementing it.&lt;ref&gt;Yeazel, Bryan J.

In 2004, German authorities forced a seventeen-year-old to shut down his Web site, entitled ''Der Abarisch Sturm'' after he posted detailed instructions of how to build a bomb.&lt;ref name="COE"&gt;[[Council of Europe]], "Organised Crime in Europe: The threat of cybercrime," 2004. p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; That year, French police also arrested a computer student in [[Alfortville]] who claimed he had posted similar instructions "for fun."&lt;ref name="COE"/&gt;

A 2007 attempt by the [[European Commission]] to suppress bomb-making websites by making [[ISP]]s criminally liable for allowing a user to view such a page was ridiculed by ''[[The Register]]'' as "fantastically ignorant of internet realities"&lt;ref name="reg"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[The Times]], [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article2023030.ece Website bomb-making lessons to be outlawed across Europe], July 4, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6810">'''Carola Stabe''' is a former [[dissident]] and [[civil rights activist]] in East Germany [[GDR]]. She is the founder and leader of the environmental group ARGUS in [[Potsdam, Germany]]. She initiated the GDR- wide opposition network of environmental groups, which later converged in the Grüne Liga.

Stabe was born in 1955 in Templin, Mecklenburg. Her father, Dr. Siegfried Stabe, was detained by the Soviets in 1945. Later, he became a member of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]], a school principal and a representative in the East German People's Chamber. In 1975, during her studies of History and Russian at [[Humboldt University of Berlin]], she was arrested because of a publication about the Soviet [[Gulag]]s. From 1977 on, she worked as a teacher in Potsdam.

In April 1988, she initiated the founding of the group ARGUS (Consortium for Environmental Protection and Urban Design), which she led until December, 1989. In the summer of 1988, she began to build a network of environmental groups. As her base she used the Cultural Association of the GDR, the only place where assembly was legal, under the scrutiny of the [[Stasi]]. In April 1988 she organized the first GDR- wide meeting of environmental groups at the Cultural Association, together with [[Matthias Platzeck]] and other members of the ARGUS group in [[Potsdam]].  In June 1989, she organized, the 1. Potsdamer Pfingsbergfest, a public gathering at which the Stasi counted 3000 visitors from all over the GDR, together with Wieland Eschenburg and Matthias Platzeck. She used administrative loopholes to circumvent a prohibition of the assembly. During the gathering, oppositional groups distributed information leaflets.

A poster by graphic artist Bob Bahra and an information leaflet published by ARGUS helped to stop the demolition of Potsdam’s baroque city center, which had been planned by the leadership of the SED (Socialist Unity Party of Germany). Because of her active role at Pfingstbergfest and other events that were critical of the system,   Stabe was dismissed from the teaching profession in July 1989, for reasons of “counterrevolutionary activities”.

On October 7, 1989 she organized, together with Matthias Platzeck, the second GDR-wide meeting. 124 representatives of environmental groups followed an ARGUS invitation to Potsdam’s Cultural Association. The GDR leadership could not forbid the meeting.   Stabe had announced it as a festivity for the 40th anniversary of the GDR. On the evening of October 7, representatives of the environmental groups signed a declaration, expressing the need for political changes and human rights in the GDR. The declaration was sent to the press in East- and West Berlin. During the meeting on October 7, a small group of dissidents around   Stabe and   Platzeck planted the idea for an environmental organization that would exist independently from the Cultural Association. In October 1989, the founding appeal for a “Green League” (Grüne Liga) was drafted. On November 15, 1989, Carola Stabe, Matthias Platzeck and members of the ARGUS group organized the 1. Potsdamer Umweltnacht an event at Potsdam’s Karl Liebknecht Stadium. Here, they made their call for he founding of the Grüne Liga public, in front of 3,000 people.  From the middle of October 1989 on, Staube took part in talks towards the creation of a [[Green politics|Green Party]] of the GDR.

Following the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] on November 9, 1989, she became a founding member of the GDR’s Green Party on November 24, 1989. Simultaneously, she worked in the speakers’ council of the Grüne Liga to foster the collaboration between both groups.

On December 5, 1989, she took part in the occupation of the Stasi headquarters in Potsdam. With a group of fellow dissidents she founded the Rat der Volkskontrolle, which organized the transition to a democratic system in Potsdam. At the Zentraler Runder Tisch (Central Round Table) in Berlin and at the Round Table in Potsdam she represented the Grüne Liga. She partook in the organization of the founding congresses of the Grüne Liga, as well as the Green Party. Her election into the federal board was prevented by the wrongful allegation that she had worked for the Stasi. Henry Schramm, the person who made the allegation, was later exposed as an agent of the Stasi, posing as a dissident in the opposition movement.

From December 7 to April 30, 1990, she headed the office of Grüne Liga in Potsdam and later in Berlin. From May 1990 to July 1992 she was the executive director of Grüne Liga e. V. She supported the creation of environmental centers in the GDR’s 14 district cities and realized projects to build environmental counseling. She helped to prepare the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Brasil for the Federal Republic of Germany. In September 1994 she was politically and professionally rehabilitated and started to work in Brandenburg against right-wing extremism, for democratic participation and for a critical assessment of GDR history. In 2005, with Bob Bahra, she founded the Forum zur kritischen Auseinandersetzung mit der DDR-Geschichte (Forum for the Critical Exploration of GDR History). Since 2006, she works with [[Stefan Roloff]] on the production of films and art projects dealing with the history of the GDR. In 2011 she founded the Gemeinschaft der Verfolgten des DDR-Systems (Association of the Persecuted of the GDR System), together with Bob Bahra, Sibylle Schönemann and Birgit Willschütz.

A '''chain of events''' is a number of [[Action theory (philosophy)|actions]] and their effects that are [[Contiguity (probability theory)|contiguous]] and linked together that results in a particular outcome. In the [[physical science]]s, [[chain reaction]]s are a primary example. 

==Determinism==
{{Main|Determinism}}
''Determinism'' is the [[philosophy|philosophical]] [[proposition]] that every event, including human cognition and behaviour, decision and action, is [[causality|causally]] determined by an unbroken ''chain of events''.&lt;ref&gt;Van Inwagen, Peter, 1983, ''An Essay on Free Will'', Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; With numerous historical debates, many varieties and philosophical positions on the subject of determinism exist from traditions throughout the world.

==In value theory==
In [[value theory]], it is the amount of cause and effects of the chain of events before generating [[intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]] that separates [[Instrumental value#High and low grades|high and low grades of instrumental value]]. The ''chain of events duration'' is the time it takes to reach the terminal event. In value theory this is generally the intrinsic value (also called terminal value). It is contrasted with [[ethic value duration]], which is the time that an object has any [[value intensity]].

==Fabric of events==
A ''fabric of events'' is an expansion of the ''chain of events'', emphasizing that chains of events are intertwined with each other, as a [[Textile|fabric]].{{CN|date=April 2014}}

==In accident analysis==

{{Main|Chain of events (accident analysis)}}
In [[accident analysis]] - for example, in the analysis of aviation accidents - a '''chain of events''' (or '''error chain''') consists of the contributing factors leading to an undesired outcome.&lt;ref name="GFDPrivate"&gt;{{cite book |author=Willits, Pat |others=Mike Abbott and Liz Kailey |title=Guided Flight Discovery: Private Pilot |url=http://www.jeppesen.com/wlcs/application/commercewf?origin=itemsummary.jsp&amp;event=link(details)&amp;wlcs_catalog_item_sku=JS314500&amp;wlcs_catalog_category_id=AT1A1A8&amp;wlcs_document_type=details |year=2007  |publisher=[[Jeppesen]] |location=[[Englewood, Colorado|Englewood]] |isbn=0-88487-429-X |oclc=145504766 |pages=10–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DlgaHNs3EjoC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=%22chain+of+events%22+accidents&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwievvXXuOPZAhXII8AKHcukDEEQ6AEIWjAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22chain+of+events%22+accidents&amp;f=false|title=Improving Safety-related Rules Compliance in the Public Transportation Industry|first=Judith B.|last=Gertler|date=11 March 2018|publisher=Transportation Research Board|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4n4dBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=%22chain+of+events%22+accidents&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwievvXXuOPZAhXII8AKHcukDEEQ6AEIVjAI#v=onepage&amp;q=%22chain+of+events%22+accidents&amp;f=false|title=International Conference on Social, Education and Management Engineering|date=9 July 2014|publisher=DEStech Publications, Inc|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rn9Sbl9jMzIC&amp;pg=PA133&amp;dq=%22chain+of+events%22+accidents&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwievvXXuOPZAhXII8AKHcukDEEQ6AEIUDAH#v=onepage&amp;q=%22chain+of+events%22+accidents&amp;f=false|title=Accident/Incident Prevention Techniques, Second Edition|first=Charles D.|last=Reese|date=25 October 2011|publisher=CRC Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BdtY7uQeu-YC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=%22chain+of+events%22+accidents&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwievvXXuOPZAhXII8AKHcukDEEQ6AEIRTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=%22chain+of+events%22+accidents&amp;f=false|title=Principles of Risk-Based Decision Making|first=In c ABS|last=Consulting|date=1 February 2002|publisher=Government Institutes|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ceuq9P4hLJMC&amp;pg=RA1-PT590&amp;dq=%22chain+of+events%22+accidents&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwievvXXuOPZAhXII8AKHcukDEEQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22chain+of+events%22+accidents&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopaedia of Occupational Health and Safety|first=Jeanne Mager|last=Stellman|date=11 March 1998|publisher=International Labour Organization|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chronocentrism''' is the assumption that certain time periods (typically the [[present]]) are better, more important, or a more significant frame of reference than other time periods, either past or future.

==History==
Chronocentrism (from the Greek ''[[wikt:chrono-|chrono-]]'' meaning "time") was coined by sociologist Jib Fowles in an article in the journal ''Futures'' in February, 1974. Fowles described chronocentrism as "the belief that one's own times are paramount, that other periods pale in comparison".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fowles |first1=Jib |title=On Chronocentrism |work=Futures |volume=6 |number=1 |doi=10.1016/0016-3287(74)90008-1 |date=February 1974 |page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, it has been defined as "the egotism that one's own generation is poised on the very cusp of history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Standage |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom Standage |title=[[The Victorian Internet|The Victorian Internet: The Remarkable Story of the Telegraph and the Nineteenth Century's On-line Pioneers]] |year=2007 |publisher=Walker &amp; Company |isbn=0-8027-1604-0 |pages=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term had been used earlier in a study about attitudes to ageing in the workplace. Chronocentricity: "...only seeing the value of one's own age cohort...described the tendency for younger managers to hold negative perceptions of the abilities or other work-related competencies of older employees."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lyon |first1=Phil |last2=Pollard |first2=D|title=Perceptions of the older employee: is anything really changing?|journal=Personnel Review|volume=26 |number=4 |doi=10.1108/00483489710172051|date=1 January 1997 |page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of discrimination is a form of [[ageism]].

==Ethnocentrism==

Chronocentrism as [[ethnocentrism]] is the perceiving and judging of a culture's historical values in terms of the standards of one's own time period.

==Antichronocentrism==

The [[Long Now Foundation]] is an organization that encourages the use of 5-digit years, e.g. "02016" instead of "2016," to help emphasize how early the present time is in their vision of the timeline of humanity.  The use of two-digit years before [[Y2K]] was an example of chronocentrism (in the early years of computing, the years 2000 and 1899 were believed to be too far in the future or the past, and thus of less importance than being able to save two digits in computerizing and typing out years).

==In science==
The "Copernican time principle" is a temporal analog of the [[Copernican principle]] for space, which states that no spatial location is any more or less special of a frame of reference than any other spatial location (i.e., that our physical universe has no center). Some authors have extended this to also include that no point in time is any more or less special than any other point in time (e.g., in outdated [[steady-state theories]]), though this cannot be universally applied (e.g., the [[Big-Bang singularity]] is a special point in time that can be logically used as a frame of reference to date later events.)

[[File:1421 Sensory Homunculus.jpg|thumb|right|400px|A [[2D geometric model|2-D]] cortical ''sensory'' homunculus]]

A '''cortical homunculus''' is a distorted representation of the human body, based on a neurological "map" of the areas and proportions of the [[human brain]] dedicated to processing motor functions, or sensory functions, for different parts of the body.  The word ''[[homunculus]]'' is [[Latin]] for "little man", and was a term used in [[alchemy]] and [[folklore]] long before scientific literature began using it. A cortical homunculus, or "cortex man", illustrates the concept of [[heuristic]]ally representing the body lying within the brain. [[Nerve]] fibres from the [[spinal cord]] terminate in various areas of the [[parietal lobe]] in the [[cerebral cortex]], which forms a representational map of the body.

== Types ==
[[File:Motor homunculus.svg|thumb|A 2-D cortical ''motor'' homunculus]]

A ''motor'' homunculus represents a map of brain areas dedicated to ''motor'' processing for different anatomical divisions of the body.  The [[primary motor cortex]] is located in the [[precentral gyrus]], and handles signals coming from the premotor area of the [[frontal lobe]]s.&lt;ref name="Human Anatomy and Physiology"&gt;Marieb, E., Hoehn, K. ''Human Anatomy and Physiology''. 7th Ed. 2007. Pearson Benjamin Cummings: San Francisco.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''sensory'' homunculus represents a map of brain areas dedicated to ''sensory'' processing for different anatomical divisions of the body.  The [[postcentral gyrus|primary sensory cortex]] is located in the [[postcentral gyrus]], and handles signals coming from the [[thalamus]].&lt;ref name="Human Anatomy and Physiology" /&gt;

These signals are transmitted on from the gyri to the [[brain stem]] and [[spinal cord]] via corresponding nerves.

== Arrangement ==
Along the length of the primary motor and sensory cortices, the areas specializing in different parts of the body are arranged in an orderly manner, although ordered differently than one might expect.  The toes are represented at the top of the cerebral hemisphere (or more accurately, "the upper end", since the cortex curls inwards and down at the top), and then as one moves down the hemisphere, progressively higher parts of the body are represented, assuming a body that's faceless and has arms raised.  Going further down the cortex, the different areas of the face are represented, in approximately top-to-bottom order, rather than bottom-to-top as before.  The homunculus is split in half, with motor and sensory representations for the left side of the body on the right side of the brain, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Saladin, Kenneth (2007). Anatomy and Physiology: The Unity of Form and Function. McGraw Hill. p. 544-546&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of cortex devoted to any given body region is not proportional to that body region's surface area or volume, but rather to how richly innervated that region is.  Areas of the body with more complex and/or more numerous sensory or motor connections are represented as larger in the homunculus, while those with less complex and/or less numerous connections are represented as smaller.  The resulting image is that of a distorted human body, with disproportionately huge hands, lips, and face.

In the sensory homunculus, below the areas handling sensation for the teeth, gums, jaw, tongue, and pharynx lies an area for intra-abdominal sensation.  At the very top end of the primary sensory cortex, beyond the area for the toes, it has traditionally been believed that the sensory neural networks for the genitals occur.  However, more recent research has suggested that there may be two different cortical areas for the genitals, possibly differentiated by one dealing with [[sexual stimulation|erogenous stimulation]] and the other dealing with non-erogenous stimulation.&lt;ref name=willcov&gt;{{cite web |url=http://willcov.com/bio-consciousness/diagrams/Homunculus%20(Topographic)%20Diagram.htm |title=Homunculus (Topographic) Diagram |website=willcov.com |last=Covington, Jr. |first=William Oates |date=2015-05-27 |access-date=2017-07-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703025727/http://willcov.com/bio-consciousness/diagrams/Homunculus%20(Topographic)%20Diagram.htm |archivedate=2017-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=neurocritic&gt;{{cite web |url=https://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2009/08/new-clitoral-homunculus.html |title=The Neurocritic: A New Clitoral Homunculus? |date=2009-08-10 |access-date=2017-07-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707211146/http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2009/08/new-clitoral-homunculus.html |archivedate=2017-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=review&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cazala |first=Fadwa |last2=Vienney |first2=Nicolas |last3=Stoléru |first3=Serge |title=The cortical sensory representation of genitalia in women and men: a systematic review |journal=Socioaffective Neuroscience &amp; Psychology |volume=5 |doi=10.3402/snp.v5.26428 |issn=2000-9011 |pmc=4357265 |pmid=25766001 |date=2015-03-10 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery ==
[[File:Sensory and motor homunculi.jpg|thumb|upright=2.5|3-D Sensory and Motor homunculus models at the [[Natural History Museum, London]]]]

Dr. [[Wilder Penfield]] and his co-investigators Edwin Boldrey and Theodore Rasmussen are considered to be the originators of the sensory and motor homunculi.  They were not the first scientists to attempt to objectify human brain function by means of a homunculus.&lt;ref name=review /&gt;  However, they were the first to differentiate between sensory and motor function and to map the two across the brain separately, resulting in two different homunculi.  In addition, their drawings and later drawings derived from theirs became perhaps the most famous conceptual maps in modern neuroscience because they compellingly illustrated the data at a single glance.&lt;ref name=review /&gt;

Penfield first conceived of his homunculi as a thought experiment, and went so far as to envision an imaginary world in which the homunculi lived, which he referred to as "if".  He and his colleagues went on to experiment with electrical stimulation of different brain areas of patients undergoing open brain surgery to control epilepsy, and were thus able to produce the topographical brain maps and their corresponding homunculi.&lt;ref name=review /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Penfield |first1=Wilder |last2=Boldrey |first2=Edwin |title=Somatic Motor And Sensory Representation In The Cerebral Cortex Of Man As Studied By Electrical Stimulation |journal=Brain |date=1937 |volume=60 |issue=4 |pages=389–443 |doi=10.1093/brain/60.4.389 |url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/60/4/389 |accessdate=26 March 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208192147/http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/60/4/389 |archivedate=8 December 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent studies have improved this understanding of [[somatotopic arrangement]] using techniques such as [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI).&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolfgang Grodd|Grodd W]], Hülsmann E, Lotze M, Wildgruber D, Erb M. Sensorimotor mapping of the human cerebellum: fMRI evidence of somatotopic organization. Hum Brain Mapp. 2001 Jun;13(2):55-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Representation ==
Penfield referred to his creations as "grotesque creatures" due to their strange-looking proportions.  For example, the sensory nerves arriving from the hands terminate over large areas of the brain, resulting in the hands of the homunculus being correspondingly large.  In contrast, the nerves emanating from the torso or arms cover a much smaller area, thus the torso and arms of the homunculus look comparatively small and weak.

Penfield's homunculi are usually shown as 2-D diagrams.  This is an oversimplification, as it cannot fully show the data set Penfield collected from his brain surgery patients.  Rather than the sharp delineation between different body areas shown in the drawings, there is actually significant overlap between neighboring regions.  The simplification suggests that lesions of the motor cortex will give rise to specific deficits in specific muscles.  However, [[Primary motor cortex#Common misconceptions|this is a misconception]], as lesions produce deficits in groups of synergistic muscles.  This finding suggests that the [[Primary motor cortex|motor cortex]] functions in terms of overall movements as coordinated groups of individual motions.

The sensorimotor homunculi can also be represented as 3-D figures (such as the sensory homunculus sculpted by Sharon Price-James shown from different angles below), which can make it easier for laymen to understand the ratios between the different body regions' levels of motor or sensory innervation.  However, these 3-D models do not illustrate which areas of the brain are associated with which parts of the body.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4181">The '''cumulative accuracy profile (CAP)''' is used in data science to visualize the discriminative power of a model. The CAP of a model represents the cumulative number of positive outcomes along the ''y''-axis versus the corresponding cumulative number of a classifying parameter along the ''x''-axis. The CAP is distinct from the [[receiver operating characteristic]] (ROC), which plots the [[true-positive rate]] against the [[false-positive rate]].

==Example==

An example is a model that predicts whether a product is bought ('''positive outcome''') by each individual from a group of people ('''classifying parameter''') based on factors such as their gender, age, income etc. If group members would be contacted at random, the cumulative number of products sold would rise linearly toward a maximum value corresponding to the total number of buyers within the group. This distribution is called the '''"random" CAP'''. A perfect prediction, on the other hand, determines exactly which group members will buy the product, such that the maximum number of products sold will be reached with a minimum number of calls. This produces a steep line on the CAP curve that stays flat once the maximum is reached (contacting all other group members will not lead to more products sold), which is the '''"perfect" CAP'''.

[[File:CAP profiles.jpg|thumb|The CAP profiles for the perfect, good and random model predicting the buying customers from a pool of 100 individuals.]]

A successful model predicts the likelihood of individuals purchasing the product and ranks these probabilities to produce a list of potential customers to be contacted first. The resulting cumulative number of sold products will increase rapidly and eventually flatten out to the given maximum as more group members are contacted. This results in a distribution that lies between the random and the perfect CAP curves.

==Analyzing a CAP==

The CAP can be used to evaluate a model by comparing the curve to the '''perfect CAP''' in which the maximum number of positive outcomes is achieved directly and to the '''random CAP''' in which the positive outcomes are distributed equally. A good model will have a CAP between the perfect CAP and the random CAP with a better model tending to the perfect CAP.

The '''accuracy ratio (AR)''' is defined as the ratio of the area between the model CAP and the random CAP and the area between the perfect CAP and the random CAP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Another indication of the model strength is given by the cumulative number of positive outcomes at 50% of the classifying parameter. For a successful model this value should lie between 50% and 100% of the maximum, with a higher percentage for stronger models.

==Applications==

The CAP and the ROC are both commonly used by banks and regulators to analyze the discriminatory ability of rating systems that evaluate the credit risks &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

In [[sociology]], '''deviance''' describes an action or behavior that violates [[norm (sociology)|social norms]], including a formally enacted rule (e.g., [[crime]]),&lt;ref name="Macionis, J. 2010"&gt;{{cite book |last=Macionis |first=J. |last2=Gerber |first2=L. |year=2010 |title=Sociology |edition=7th Canadian |location=Toronto |publisher=Pearson |isbn=978-0-13-511927-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as informal violations of social norms (e.g., rejecting folkways and [[mores]]). Although deviance may have a negative connotation, the violation of social norms is not always a negative action; positive deviation exists in some situations. Although a norm is violated, a behavior can still be classified as positive or acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heckert|first=Alex|date=September 2002|title=a new typology of deviance:integrating normative and reactivist definitions of deviance|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=6&amp;sid=8166a1e2-8d9c-4391-b40f-4e9a99eb3ebe%40pdc-v-sessmgr01|journal=Deviant Behavior: An Interdisciplinary Journal|volume=23|pages=449-479|via=SOCindex}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Social norms differ from culture to culture. For example, a deviant act can be committed in one society but may be normal for another society.

Deviance is [[Relativism|relative]] to the place where it was committed or to the time the act took place. Killing another human is considered wrong, except when governments permit it during warfare or for self defense.  There are two types of major deviant actions, ''[[mala in se]]'' or ''[[mala prohibita|mala prohibits]] types.''

== Functions ==
Deviant acts can be assertions of individuality and identity, and thus as rebellion against [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/social-norms/ group norms] of the dominant culture and in favor of a sub-culture.

Deviance affirms cultural values and norms. It also clarifies moral boundaries, promotes social unity by creating an us/them dichotomy, encourages social change, and provides jobs to control deviance.&lt;ref name="Hastings, Stephanie E 2009"&gt;Hastings, Stephanie E. and Thomas A. O'Neil. "Predicting workplace deviance using broad versus narrow personality variables." Personality and Individual Differences.47 (2009):289–293.&lt;/ref&gt; "Certain factors of personality are theoretically and empirically related to workplace deviance, such as work environment, and individual differences."&lt;ref name="Kong, Travis S. K 2009"&gt;Kong, Travis S. K. More Than a Sex Machine: Accomplishing Masculinity Among Chinese Male Sex Workers in the Hong Kong Sex Industry. Deviant Behavior. 30 (2009)715–745.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theories ==
Three broad sociological classes exist that describe deviant behavior, namely, [[functionalism (sociology)|structural functionalism]], [[symbolic interaction]] and [[conflict theory]].

=== Structural-functionalism ===
Social integration is the attachment to groups and institutions, while social regulation is the adherence to the norms and values of society. Those who are very integrated fall under the category of "altruism" and those who are not very integrated fall under "[[egotism]]." Similarly, those who are very regulated fall under "[[fatalism]]" and those who are very unregulated fall under "[[anomie]]".
Durkheim's theory attributes social deviance to extremes of the dimensions of the social bond. [[Altruistic]] suicide (death for the good of the group), egoistic suicide (death for the removal of the self-due to or justified by the lack of ties to others), and [[anomic]] suicide (death due to the confounding of self-interest and societal norms) are the three forms of suicide that can happen due to extremes. Likewise, individuals may commit crimes for the good of an individual's group, for the self-due to or justified by lack of ties, or because the societal norms that place the individual in check no longer have power due to society's corruption.

==== Durkheim's concept ====
[[Émile Durkheim #ÉmileDurkheim|Durkheim]] (1858–1917) claimed that deviance was in fact a normal and necessary part of social organization.&lt;ref name="Macionis, J. 2010" /&gt; When he studied deviance he stated four important functions of deviance.

# "Deviance affirms cultural values and norms. Any definition of virtue rests on an opposing idea of vice: There can be no good without evil and no justice without crime".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Macionis and Gerber|first=John, Linda|title=Sociology |edition=7th Canadian |year=2010|publisher=Pearson Canada Inc.|location=Toronto, Ontario|isbn=978-0-13-700161-3|pages=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Deviance defines moral boundaries, people learn right from wrong by defining people as deviant.
# A serious form of deviance forces people to come together and react in the same way against it.
# Deviance pushes society's moral boundaries which, in turn leads to social change.

==== Merton's strain theory ====
{{Main|Strain theory (sociology)}}
[[File:Mertons social strain theory.svg|right|250 px]]
[[Robert K. Merton]] discussed deviance in terms of goals and means as part of his strain/anomie theory. Where [[Émile Durkheim #ÉmileDurkheim|Durkheim]]  states that anomie is the confounding of social norms, Merton goes further and states that anomie is the state in which social goals and the legitimate means to achieve them do not correspond. He postulated that an individual's response to societal expectations and the means by which the individual pursued those goals were useful in understanding deviance. Specifically, he viewed collective action as motivated by strain, stress, or frustration in a body of individuals that arises from a disconnection between the society's ''goals'' and the popularly used ''means'' to achieve those goals. Often, non-routine collective behavior (rioting, rebellion, etc.) is said to map onto economic explanations and causes by way of strain. These two dimensions determine the adaptation to society according to the cultural goals, which are the society's perceptions about the ideal life, and to the institutionalized means, which are the legitimate means through which an individual may aspire to the cultural goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Paternoster | first1 = R. | last2 = Mazerolle | first2 = P. | doi = 10.1177/0022427894031003001 | title = General Strain Theory and Delinquency: A Replication and Extension | journal = Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency | volume = 31 | issue = 3 | pages = 235 | year = 1994 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Merton described 5 types of deviance in terms of the acceptance or rejection of social goals and the institutionalized means of achieving them:

'''1. Innovation''' is a response due to the strain generated by our culture's emphasis on wealth and the lack of opportunities to get rich, which causes people to be "innovators" by engaging in stealing and selling drugs. Innovators accept society's goals, but reject socially acceptable means of achieving them. (e.g.: monetary success is gained through crime). Merton claims that innovators are mostly those who have been socialised with similar world views to conformists, but who have been denied the opportunities they need to be able to legitimately achieve society's goals.&lt;ref name="Macionis, J. 2010" /&gt;

'''2. Conformists''' accept society's goals and the socially acceptable means of achieving them (e.g.: monetary success is gained through hard work). Merton claims that conformists are mostly middle-class people in middle class jobs who have been able to access the opportunities in society such as a better education to achieve monetary success through hard work.&lt;ref name="Macionis, J. 2010" /&gt;

'''3. Ritualism''' refers to the inability to reach a cultural goal thus embracing the rules to the point where the people in question lose sight of their larger goals in order to feel respectable. Ritualists reject society's goals, but accept society's institutionalised means. Ritualists are most commonly found in dead-end, repetitive jobs, where they are unable to achieve society's goals but still adhere to society's means of achievement and social norms.&lt;ref name="Macionis, J. 2010" /&gt;

'''4. Retreatism''' is the rejection of both cultural goals and means, letting the person in question "drop out". Retreatists reject the society's goals and the legitimate means to achieve them. Merton sees them as true deviants, as they commit acts of deviance to achieve things that do not always go along with society's values.&lt;ref name="Macionis, J. 2010" /&gt;

'''5. Rebellion''' is somewhat similar to retreatism, because the people in question also reject both the cultural goals and means, but they go one step further to a "counterculture" that supports other social orders that already exist (rule breaking). Rebels reject society's goals and legitimate means to achieve them, and instead creates new goals and means to replace those of society, creating not only new goals to achieve but also new ways to achieve these goals that other rebels will find acceptable.&lt;ref name="Macionis, J. 2010" /&gt;

=== Symbolic interaction ===
{{Main|Symbolic interaction}}
'''Symbolic Interaction''',  refers to the patterns of communication, interpretation and adjustment between individuals. Both the verbal and nonverbal responses that a listener then delivers are similarly constructed in expectation of how the original speaker will react. The ongoing process is like the game of charades, only it’s a full-fledged conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A first look at communication theory. |last=Griffin |first=Em |year=2012 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |isbn=978-0-07-353430-5 |page=54 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "symbolic interactionism" has come into use as a label for a relatively distinctive approach to the study of human life and human conduct. (Blumer, 1969). With Symbolic interactionism, reality is seen as social, developed interaction with others. Most symbolic interactionists believe a physical reality does indeed exist by an individual's social definitions, and that social definitions do develop in part or relation to something “real.” People thus do not respond to this reality directly, but rather to the social understanding of reality. Humans therefore exist in three realities: a physical objective reality, a social reality, and a unique. A unique is described as a third reality created out of the social reality, a private interpretation of the reality that is shown to the person by others (Charon, 2007).&lt;ref&gt;Charon J.M. (2007). ''Symbolic Interactionism: An Introduction, An Interpretation, Integration''. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Perason Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; Both individuals and society cannot be separated far from each other for two reasons. One, being that both are created through social interaction, and two, one cannot be understood in terms without the other. Behavior is not defined by forces from the environment such as drives, or instincts, but rather by a reflective, socially understood meaning of both the internal and external incentives that are currently presented (Meltzer et al., 1975).&lt;ref&gt;Meltzer B.N., Petras J.W. &amp; Reynolds L.T.(1975). ''Symbolic Interactionism: Genesis, Varieties, and Criticism''. Boston: Routledge and Kegan Paul.&lt;/ref&gt;

Herbert Blumer (1969) set out three basic premises of the perspective:

* "Humans act toward things on the basis of the meanings they ascribe to those things."
* "The meaning of such things is derived from, or arises out of, the social interaction that one has with others and the society."
* "These meanings are handled in, and modified through, an interpretative process used by the person in dealing with the things he/she encounters."

==== Sutherland's differential association ====
{{Main|Differential association}}
In his [[differential association]] theory, [[Edwin Sutherland]] posited that criminals learn criminal and deviant behaviors and that deviance is not inherently a part of a particular individual's nature. When an individual's significant others engage in deviant and/or criminal behavior, criminal behavior will be learned as a result to this exposure.&lt;ref name="Botterweck, Michael C 2011 p 152"&gt;Ed. Botterweck, Michael C. et al. (2011) "Everyday Sociology", p 152. Starpoint Press, Elmhurst, IL.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, he argues that criminal behavior is learned in the same way that all other behaviors are learned, meaning that the acquisition of criminal knowledge is not unique compared to the learning of other behaviors.

Sutherland outlined some very basic points in his theory, including the idea that the learning comes from the interactions between individuals and groups, using communication of symbols and ideas. When the symbols and ideas about deviation are much more favorable than unfavorable, the individual tends to take a favorable view upon deviance and will resort to more of these behaviors.

Criminal behavior (motivations and technical knowledge), as with any other sort of behavior, is learned. Some basic assumptions include:

* Learning in interaction using communication within intimate personal groups.
* Techniques, motives, drives, rationalizations, and attitudes are all learned.
* Excess of definitions favorable to deviation.
* Legitimate and illegitimate behaviors both express the same general needs and essential values.

One example of this would be gang activity in inner city communities.  Sutherland would feel that because a certain individual's primary influential peers are in a gang environment, it is through interaction with them that one may become involved in crime.&lt;ref name="Botterweck, Michael C 2011 p 152" /&gt;

==== Neutralization theory ====
{{main|Techniques of neutralization}}
[[Gresham Sykes]] and [[David Matza]]'s [[Techniques of neutralization|neutralization theory]] explains how deviants justify their deviant behaviors by providing alternative definitions of their actions and by providing explanations, to themselves and others, for the lack of guilt for actions in particular situations.

There are five types of neutralization:

* Denial of responsibility: the deviant believes s/he was helplessly propelled into the deviance, and that under the same circumstances, any other person would resort to similar actions
* Denial of injury: the deviant believes that the action caused no harm to other individuals or to the society, and thus the deviance is not morally wrong
* Denial of the victim: the deviant believes that individuals on the receiving end of the deviance were deserving of the results due to the victim's lack of virtue or morals
* Condemnation of the condemners: the deviant believes enforcement figures or victims have the tendency to be equally deviant or otherwise corrupt, and as a result, are hypocrites to stand against
* Appeal to higher loyalties: the deviant believes that there are loyalties and values that go beyond the confines of the law; morality, friendships, income, or traditions may be more important to the deviant than legal boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jim |last=Mitchell |first2=Richard A. |last2=Dodder |year=1983 |title=Types of Neutralization and Delinquency |journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=307–318 |doi=10.1007/BF02088729 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Labeling theory ====
{{Main|Labeling theory}}
[[Frank Tannenbaum]] and [[Howard S. Becker]] created and developed the labeling theory, which is a core facet of symbolic interactionism, and often referred to as Tannenbaum's "dramatization of evil".  Becker believed that "social groups create deviance by making the rules whose infraction constitutes deviance".

Labeling is a process of social reaction by the "social audience", (stereotyping) the people in society exposed to, judging and accordingly defining (labeling) someone's behavior as deviant or otherwise.  It has been characterized as the "invention, selection, manipulation of beliefs which define conduct in a negative way and the selection of people into these categories [....]"&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 2001: 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Labeling theory, consequently, suggests that deviance is caused by the deviant's being labeled as morally inferior, the deviant's internalizing the label and finally the deviant's acting according to that specific label (in other words, you label the "deviant" and they act accordingly).  As time goes by, the "deviant" takes on traits that constitute deviance by committing such deviations as conform to the label (so you as the audience have the power to not label them and you have the power to stop the deviance before it ever occurs by not labeling them).  Individual and societal preoccupation with the label, in other words, leads the deviant individual to follow a self-fulfilling prophecy of abidance to the ascribed label.&lt;ref name="Macionis, J. 2010" /&gt;

This theory, while very much [[symbolic interaction|symbolically interactionist]], also has elements of conflict theory, as the dominant group has the power to decide what is deviant and acceptable, and enjoys the power behind the labeling process.  An example of this is a prison system that labels people convicted of theft, and because of this they start to view themselves as by definition thieves, incapable of changing.  "From this point of view," as [[Howard S. Becker]] has written,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Deviance is ''not'' a quality of the act the person commits, but rather a consequence of the application by others of rules and sanctions to an "offender".  The deviant is one to whom the label has successfully been applied; deviant behavior is behavior that people so label.&lt;ref&gt;Howard S. Becker. ''Outsiders: Studies in the Sociology of Deviance''. (New York: The Free Press, 1963). {{ISBN|978-0-684-83635-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In other words, "Behavior only becomes deviant or criminal if defined and interfered as such by specific people in [a] specific situation."&lt;ref&gt;Thomson 2004: 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is important to note the salient fact that society is not always correct in its labeling, often falsely identifying and misrepresenting people as deviants, or attributing to them characteristics which they do not have.  In legal terms, people are often wrongly accused, yet many of them must live with the ensuant [[Social stigma|stigma]] (or conviction) for the rest of their lives.

On a similar note, society often employs double standards, with some sectors of society enjoying favouritism.  Certain behaviors in one group are seen to be perfectly acceptable, or can be easily overlooked, but in another are seen, by the same audiences, as abominable.

The medicalization of deviance, ''the transformation of moral and legal deviance into a medical condition'', is an important shift that has transformed the way society views deviance.&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber 2010 pp. 204"&gt;{{cite book |last=Macionis |first=J. |last2=Gerber |first2=L. |year=2010 |title=Sociology |edition=7th Canadian |location=Toronto |publisher=Pearson |isbn=978-0-13-511927-3 |page=204 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The labelling theory helps to explain this shift, as behaviour that used to be judged morally are now being transformed into an objective clinical diagnosis. For example, people with drug addictions are considered "sick" instead of "bad".&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber 2010 pp. 204" /&gt;

==== Primary and secondary deviation ====
Edwin Lemert developed the idea of primary and secondary deviation as a way to explain the process of labeling. Primary deviance is any general deviance before the deviant is labeled as such in a particular way. Secondary deviance is any action that takes place after primary deviance as a reaction to the institutional identification of the person as a deviant.&lt;ref name="Macionis, J. 2010" /&gt;

When an actor commits a crime (primary deviance), however mild, the institution will bring social penalties down on the actor. However, punishment does not necessarily stop crime, so the actor might commit the same primary deviance again, bringing even harsher reactions from the institutions. At this point, the actor will start to resent the institution, while the institution brings harsher and harsher repression. Eventually, the whole community will stigmatize the actor as a deviant and the actor will not be able to tolerate this, but will ultimately accept his or her role as a criminal, and will commit criminal acts that fit the role of a criminal.

Primary And Secondary Deviation is what causes people to become harder criminals. Primary deviance is the time when the person is labeled deviant through confession or reporting. Secondary deviance is deviance before and after the primary deviance. Retrospective labeling happens when the deviant recognizes his acts as deviant prior to the primary deviance, while prospective labeling is when the deviant recognizes future acts as deviant.
The steps to becoming a criminal are:

# Primary deviation.
# Social penalties.
# Secondary deviation.
# Stronger penalties.
# Further deviation with resentment and hostility towards punishers.
# Community stigmatizes the deviant as a criminal. 
# Tolerance threshold passed.
# Strengthening of deviant conduct because of stigmatizing penalties.
# Acceptance as role of deviant or criminal actor.

==== Control theory ====
Control theory advances the proposition that weak bonds between the individual and society free people to deviate. By contrast, strong bonds make deviance costly.  This theory asks why people refrain from deviant or criminal behavior, instead of why people commit deviant or criminal behavior, according to [[Travis Hirschi]].  The control theory developed when norms emerge to deter deviant behavior.  Without this "control", deviant behavior would happen more often.  This leads to conformity and groups.  People will conform to a group when they believe they have more to gain from conformity than by deviance.  If a strong bond is achieved there will be less chance of deviance than if a weak bond has occurred.  Hirschi argued a person follows the norms because they have a bond to society.  The bond consists of four positively correlated factors: opportunity, attachment, belief, and involvement.&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber 2010 pp. 204" /&gt; When any of these bonds are weakened or broken one is more likely to act in defiance. [[Michael R. Gottfredson|Michael Gottfredson]] and [[Travis Hirschi]] in 1990 founded their Self-Control Theory.  It stated that acts of force and fraud are undertaken in the pursuit of self-interest and self-control.  A deviant act is based on a criminals own self-control of themselves.

Containment theory is considered by researchers such as [[Walter Reckless|Walter C. Reckless]] to be part of the control theory because it also revolves around the thoughts that stop individuals from engaging in crime. Reckless studied the unfinished approaches meant to explain the reasoning behind delinquency and crime. He recognized that societal disorganization is included in the study of delinquency and crime under social deviance, leading him to claim that the majority of those who live in unstable areas tend not to have criminal tendencies in comparison those who live in middle-class areas. This claim opens up more possible approaches to social disorganization, and proves that the already implemented theories are in need or a deeper connection to further explore ideas of crime and delinquency. These observations brought Reckless to ask questions such as, "Why do some persons break through the tottering (social) controls and others do not? Why do rare cases in well-integrated society break through the lines of strong controls?" Reckless asserted that the intercommunication between self-control and social controls are partly responsible for the development of delinquent thoughts. Social disorganization was not related to a particular environment, but instead was involved in the deterioration of an individuals social controls. The containment theory is the idea that everyone possesses mental and social safeguards which protect the individual from committing acts of deviancy. Containment depends on the individuals ability to separate inner and outer controls for normative behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Flexon|first1=Jamie L.|editor1-last=Cullen|editor1-first=Francis T.|editor2-last=Wilcoz|editor2-first=Pamela|title=Encyclopedia of Criminological Theory|date=2010|publisher=SAGE Publications|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|isbn=9781412959186|pages=777–782|chapter=Reckless, Walter C.:Containment Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More contemporary control theorists such as [[Robert Crutchfield]] take the theory into a new light, suggesting labor market experiences not only affect the attitudes and the "stakes" of individual workers, but can also affect the development of their children's views toward conformity and cause involvement in delinquency.  This is an ongoing study as he has found a significant relationship between parental labor market involvement and children's delinquency, but has not empirically demonstrated the mediating role of parents' or children's attitude.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} In a study conducted by Tim Wadsworth, the relationship between parent's employment and children's delinquency, which was previously suggested by Crutchfield (1993), was shown empirically for the first time. The findings from this study supported the idea that the relationship between socioeconomic status and delinquency might be better understood if the quality of employment and its role as an informal social control is closely examined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/sf/78.3.1041| title = Labor Markets, Delinquency, and Social Control Theory: An Empirical Assessment of the Mediating Process| journal = Social Forces| volume = 78| issue = 3| pages = 1041| year = 2000| last1 = Wadsworth | first1 = T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conflict theory ===
{{Main|Conflict theory}}
In sociology, conflict theory states that society or an organization functions so that each individual participant and its groups struggle to maximize their benefits, which inevitably contributes to social change such as political changes and revolutions. Deviant behaviors are actions that do not go along with the social institutions as what cause deviance. The institution's ability to change norms, wealth or status comes into conflict with the individual. The legal rights of poor folks might be ignored, middle class are also accept; they side with the elites rather than the poor, thinking they might rise to the top by supporting the status quo. Conflict theory is based upon the view that the fundamental causes of crime are the social and economic forces operating within society. However, it explains white-collar crime less well.

This theory also states that the powerful define crime. This raises the question: for whom is this theory functional? In this theory, laws are instruments of oppression: tough on the powerless and less tough on the powerful.

==== Karl Marx ====
[[Karl Marx|Marx]] did not write about deviant behavior but he wrote about [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] amongst the proletariat—as well as between the [[proletariat]] and the finished product—which causes conflict, and thus deviant behavior.

Many Marxist writers have the theory of the capitalist state in their arguments. For example, [[Steven Spitzer]] utilized the theory of bourgeois control over social junk and social dynamite; [[George Rusche]] was known to present analysis of different punishments correlated to the social capacity and infrastructure for labor. He theorized that throughout history, when more labor is needed, the severity of punishments decreases and the tolerance for deviant behavior increases. [[Jock Young]], another Marxist writer, presented the idea that the modern world did not approve of diversity, but was not afraid of social conflict. The late modern world, however, is very tolerant of diversity.&lt;ref name="Macionis, J. 2010" /&gt; But is extremely afraid of social conflicts, which is an explanation given for the political correctness movement. The late modern society easily accepts difference, but it labels those that it does not want as deviant and relentlessly punishes and persecutes.

==== Michel Foucault ====
[[Michel Foucault]] believed that [[torture]] had been phased out from modern society due to the dispersion of power; there was no need any more for the wrath of the state on a deviant individual. Rather, the [[Modernity#Sociologically|modern state]] receives praise for its fairness and dispersion of power which, instead of controlling each individual, controls the mass.

He also theorized that institutions control people through the use of [[discipline]].&lt;ref name="Steiner, Benjamin 2009"&gt;Steiner, Benjamin, and John Wooldredge."The relevance of inmate race/ethnicity versus population composition for understanding prison rule violations." ''[[Punishment &amp; Society]]'' 11(2009):459–489.&lt;/ref&gt;"Race and ethnicity could be relevant to an understanding of prison rule breaking if inmates bring their ecologically structured beliefs regarding legal authority, crime and deviance into the institutional environment."  For example, the modern prison (more specifically the [[panopticon]]) is a template for these institutions because it controls its inmates by the perfect use of discipline.

Foucault theorizes that, in a sense, the [[Post modern#History of term|postmodern society]] is characterized by the lack of [[free will]] on the part of individuals. Institutions of knowledge, norms, and values, are simply in place to categorize and control humans.

==== Biological theories of deviance ====
Praveen Attri claims genetic reasons to be largely responsible for social deviance. The Italian school of criminology contends that biological factors may contribute to crime and deviance. Cesare Lombroso was among the first to research and develop the Theory of Biological Deviance which states that some people are genetically predisposed to criminal behavior. He believed that criminals were a product of earlier genetic forms. The main influence of his research was Charles Darwin and his Theory of Evolution. Lombroso theorized that people were born criminals or in other words, less evolved humans who were biologically more related to our more primitive and animalistic urges. From his research, Lombroso took Darwin's Theory and looked at primitive times himself in regards to deviant behaviors.  He found that the skeletons that he studied mostly had low foreheads and protruding jaws.  These characteristics resembled primitive beings such as Homo Neanderthalensis. He stated that little could be done to cure born criminals because their characteristics were biologically inherited. Over time, most of his research was disproved. His research was refuted by Pearson and [[Charles Buckman Goring|Charles Goring]]. They discovered that Lombroso had not researched enough skeletons to make his research thorough enough.  When Pearson and Goring researched skeletons on their own they tested many more and found that the bone structure had no relevance in deviant behavior.  The statistical study that Charles Goring published on this research is called "The English Convict".

=== Other theories ===
The Classical school of criminology comes from the works of [[Cesare Beccaria]] and [[Jeremy Bentham]]. Beccaria assumed a [[utilitarian]] view of [[society]] along with a [[social contract]] theory of the [[State (polity)|state]]. He argued that the role of the state was to maximize the greatest possible utility to the maximum number of people and to minimize those actions that harm the society. He argued that deviants commit deviant acts (which are harmful to the society) because of the utility it gives to the private individual. If the state were to match the pain of punishments with the utility of various deviant behaviors, the deviant would no longer have any incentive to commit deviant acts. (Note that Beccaria argued for ''just'' punishment; as raising the severity of punishments without regard to logical measurement of utility would cause increasing degrees of social harm once it reached a certain point.)

== Cross-cultural communication ==
[[Cross-cultural communication]] is a field of study that looks at how people from different cultural backgrounds endeavor to communicate. All cultures make use of [[nonverbal communication]] but its meaning varies across cultures. In one particular country, a non-verbal sign may stand for one thing, and mean something else in another culture or country. The relation of cross-cultural communication with deviance is that a sign may be offensive to one in one culture and mean something completely appropriate in another. This is an important field of study because as educators, business employees, or any other form of career that consists of communicating with ones from other cultures, you need to understand non-verbal signs and their meanings, so you avoid offensive conversation or misleading conversation. Below is a list of non-verbal gestures that are appropriate in one country, and that would be considered deviant in another.

{| class="wikitable"

|}
These are just a few non-verbal cross-cultural communication signs of which one should be aware. Cross-Cultural communication can make or break a business deal, or even prevent an educator from offending a student. Different cultures have different methods of communication, so it is important to understand the cultures of others.

Shaving of heads after death of a family member is more common in some African cultures.

Proponents of the theory of a [[Southern culture of honor]] hold that violent behavior which would be considered criminal in most of the United States, may be considered a justifiable response to insult in a Southern culture of honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John Shelton |last=Reed |title=One South: An Ethnic Approach To Regional Culture |location=Baton Rouge |publisher=Louisiana State University Press |year=1982 |isbn=0-8071-1003-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
Taboo is a strong social form of behavior considered deviant by a majority. To speak of it publicly is condemned, and therefore, almost entirely avoided.  The term “taboo” comes from the Tongan word “[[Tapu (Polynesian culture)|tapu]]” meaning "under prohibition", "not allowed", or "forbidden". Some forms of taboo are prohibited under law and transgressions may lead to severe penalties. Other forms of taboo result in [[shame]], [[disrespect]] and [[humiliation]]. Taboo is not universal but does occur in the majority of societies. Some of the examples include [[murder]], [[rape]], [[incest]], or [[child molestation]].

[[Howard S. Becker|Howard Becker]], a labeling theorist, identified four different types of deviant behavior labels which are given as:

# "[[Falsely accusing]]" an individual - others perceive the individual to be obtaining obedient or deviant behaviors.
# "Pure deviance", others perceive the individual as participating in deviant and rule-breaking behavior.
# "[[Conforming]]", others perceive the individual to be participating in the social norms that are distributed within societies.
# "Secret deviance" which is when the individual is not perceived as deviant or participating in any rule-breaking behaviors.

== The criminal justice system ==
'''Police''': The police maintain public order by enforcing the law. Police use personal discretion in deciding whether and how to handle a situation. Research suggests that police are more likely to make an arrest if the offence is serious, if bystanders are present, or if the suspect is of a visible minority.&lt;ref name="Macionis, J. 2010"/&gt;

'''Courts''': Courts rely on an adversarial process in which attorneys-one representing the defendant and one representing the Crown-present their cases in the presence of a judge who monitors legal procedures. In practice, courts resolve most cases through plea bargaining. Though efficient, this method puts less powerful people at a disadvantage.&lt;ref name="Macionis, J. 2010"/&gt;

'''Punishment''': There are four jurisdictions for punishment: retribution, deterrence, rehabilitation, societal protection. Community-based corrections include probation and parole. These programs lower the cost of supervising people convicted of crimes and reduce [[prison overcrowding]] but have not been shown to reduce recidivism.&lt;ref name="Macionis, J. 2010"/&gt;

== In literature and film ==

Many works of literature offer [[allegories]] illustrating the conflict between character and society, in which the character does not conform to the society's norms and is subsequently alienated, ostracized, socially sanctioned, discriminated against or persecuted.

'''Domestic violence''' (also named '''domestic abuse''' or '''family violence''') is [[violence]] or other [[abuse]] by one person against another in a domestic setting, such as in [[marriage]] or [[cohabitation]]. It may be termed ''[[intimate partner violence]]'' when committed by a [[spouse]] or partner in an [[intimate relationship]] against the other spouse or partner, and can take place in [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] or [[Domestic violence in same-sex relationships|same-sex]] relationships, or between former spouses or partners. Domestic violence can also involve violence against children, parents, or the elderly. It takes a number of forms, including [[physical abuse|physical]], [[verbal abuse|verbal]], [[emotional abuse|emotional]], [[economic abuse|economic]], [[Religious abuse|religious]], [[Reproductive coercion|reproductive]], and [[sexual abuse]], which can range from subtle, coercive forms to [[marital rape]] and to violent physical abuse such as choking, beating, [[female genital mutilation]], and [[acid throwing]] that results in [[disfigurement]] or death. Domestic murders include [[stoning]], [[bride burning]], [[honor killing]]s, and [[dowry death]]s.

Globally, the victims of domestic violence are overwhelmingly women, and women tend to experience more severe forms of violence.&lt;ref name="McQuigg"&gt;{{citation | last = McQuigg | first = Ronagh J.A. | contribution = Potential problems for the effectiveness of international human rights law as regards domestic violence| editor-last = McQuigg | editor-first = Ronagh J.A. | title = International human rights law and domestic violence: the effectiveness of international human rights law | page = 13 | publisher = [[Taylor &amp; Francis]] | location = Oxford New York| year = 2011 | isbn = 9781136742088 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ltJxlsoMV4wC&amp;pg=PR13 | quote = This is an issue that affects vast numbers of women throughout all nations of the world.

Domestic violence often occurs when the abuser believes that abuse is an entitlement, acceptable, justified, or unlikely to be reported. It may produce an [[intergenerational cycle of abuse]] in children and other family members, who may feel that such violence is acceptable or condoned. Many people do not recognize themselves as abusers or victims because they may consider their experiences as family conflicts that got out of control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s10896-013-9555-4 |title=Stay with or Leave the Abuser?

Domestic violence often happens in the context of [[forced marriage|forced]] or [[child marriage]].&lt;ref name="Child marriages: 39 000 every day"&gt;{{cite web | last = WHO | author-link = World Health Organization | title = Child marriages: 39,000 every day | url = https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2013/child_marriage_20130307/en/ | website = who.int | publisher = [[World Health Organization]] | date = 7 March 2013 | access-date = 11 April 2014 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140414075336/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2013/child_marriage_20130307/en/ | archivedate = 14 April 2014 | df =  }} Joint news release Every Woman Every Child/Girls Not Brides/PMNCH/United Nations Foundation/UNFPA/UNICEF/UN Women/WHO/World Vision/World YWCA/&lt;/ref&gt;

In abusive relationships, there may be a [[cycle of abuse]] during which tensions rise and an act of violence is committed, followed by a period of reconciliation and calm. Victims of domestic violence may be trapped in domestic violent situations through [[Isolation to facilitate abuse|isolation]], [[Abusive power and control|power and control]], [[traumatic bonding]] to the abuser,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dutton|first=Donald|last2=Painter|first2=S.L.|date=1981-01-01|title=Traumatic bonding: The development of emotional attachments in battered women and other relationships of intermittent abuse|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284119047|journal=Victimology|volume=6|pages=139–155}}&lt;/ref&gt; cultural acceptance, lack of financial resources, [[fear]], [[shame]], or to protect children. As a result of abuse, victims may experience physical disabilities, dysregulated aggression, chronic health problems, mental illness, limited finances, and poor ability to create healthy relationships. Victims may experience severe psychological disorders, such as [[post-traumatic stress disorder]]. Children who live in a household with violence often show psychological problems from an early age, such as avoidance, hypervigilance to threats, and dysregulated aggression which may contribute to vicarious traumatization.&lt;ref name=care&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Schechter | first1 = Daniel S. | last2 = Zygmunt | first2 = Annette | last3 = Coates | first3 = Susan W. | last4 = Davies | first4 = Mark | last5 = Trabka | first5 = Kimberly A. | last6 = McCaw | first6 = Jamie | last7 = Kolodji | first7 = Ann | last8 = Robinson | first8 = Joann L. | title = Caregiver traumatization adversely impacts young children's mental representations on the MacArthur Story Stem Battery | journal = Attachment &amp; Human Development  | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 187–205 | doi = 10.1080/14616730701453762 | pmid = 18007959 | pmc = 2078523 | date = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known use of the term domestic violence in a modern context, meaning violence in the home, was in an address to the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] by [[Jack Ashley, Baron Ashley of Stoke|Jack Ashley]] in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.womensaid.org.uk/landing_page.asp?section=00010001001900040004 National Women's Aid Federation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113070656/http://www.womensaid.org.uk/landing_page.asp?section=00010001001900040004 |date=2012-01-13 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1973/jul/16/battered-wives House of Commons Sitting (1973)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024231056/http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1973/jul/16/battered-wives |date=2012-10-24 }} Battered Women.&lt;/ref&gt; The term previously referred primarily to [[civil unrest]], violence from within a country as opposed to violence perpetrated by a foreign power.&lt;ref name="DV Times"&gt;{{cite news | title = Domestic violence in the Times: From civil unrest to spouse abuse | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/11/upshot/domestic-violence-in-the-times-from-civil-unrest-to-spouse-abuse.html | website = The New York Times | date = September 10, 2014 | access-date = March 26, 2016 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160722131054/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/11/upshot/domestic-violence-in-the-times-from-civil-unrest-to-spouse-abuse.html | archivedate = July 22, 2016 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The federalist papers : no. 43 The same subject continued (The powers conferred by the constitution further considered) | url = http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed43.asp | website = Yale Law School, Avalon Project, Documents in History, Law and Diplomacy | access-date = March 26, 2016 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160326005948/http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed43.asp | archivedate = March 26, 2016 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Compare the July 18, 1877 request for help sent to President [[Rutherford B.

Traditionally, domestic violence (DV) was mostly associated with physical violence. Terms such as ''wife abuse'', ''wife beating'', and ''wife'' ''battering'' were used, but have declined in popularity due to efforts to include unmarried partners, abuse other than physical, female perpetrators, and same-sex relationships.{{refn|Terms such wife abuse, wife beating, and battering are descriptive terms that have lost popularity recently for several reasons:

Again, most legal systems fail to criminalize circumstances where a wife is forced to have sexual relations with her husband against her will.

In recent decades, there has been a call for the end of legal impunity for domestic violence, an impunity often based on the idea that such acts are private.&lt;ref name="who.intB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ohchr.org"/&gt; The [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence|Istanbul Convention]] is the first legally binding instrument in Europe dealing with domestic violence and violence against women.&lt;ref name="oas.org"/&gt; The convention seeks to put an end to the toleration, in law or in practice, of violence against women and DV. In its explanatory report it acknowledges the long tradition of European countries of ignoring, ''de jure'' or ''de facto'', these forms of violence.&lt;ref name=CofE_CETS210&gt;{{cite web | last = Council of Europe | author-link = Council of Europe | title = Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (CETS No. 210) | url = http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Reports/Html/210.htm | website = conventions.coe.int | publisher = [[Council of Europe]] | accessdate = 22 August 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150720234156/http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Reports/Html/210.htm | archivedate = 20 July 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; At para 219, it states: "There are many examples from past practice in Council of Europe member states that show that exceptions to the prosecution of such cases were made, either in law or in practice, if victim and perpetrator were, for example, married to each other or had been in a relationship. The most prominent example is rape within marriage, which for a long time had not been recognised as rape because of the relationship between victim and perpetrator."&lt;ref name=CofE_CETS210 /&gt;

There has been increased attention given to specific forms of domestic violence, such as honor killings, dowry deaths, and forced marriages.

Historically, children had few protections from violence by their parents, and in many parts of the world, this is still the case.

Limitations of [[methodology]], such as the [[conflict tactics scale]], that fail to capture injury, homicide, and sexual violence rates,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hamby|first=Sherry|date=2014-05-28|title=Measuring Intimate Partner Violence: A Multi-Study Investigation of Gender Patterns|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268125313}}&lt;/ref&gt; context (e.g., motivations, fear), disparate [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]] procedures, respondent reluctance to self-report, and differences in [[operationalization]] all pose challenges to existing research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hamby|first=Sherry|date=2017-04-01|title=On defining violence, and why it matters|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315967513|journal=Psychology of Violence|volume=7|issue=2|pages=167–180|doi=10.1037/vio0000117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chan2011&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Chan | first = Ko Ling | title = Gender differences in self-reports of intimate partner violence: a review | journal = [[Aggression and Violent Behavior]] | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 167–175 | doi = 10.1016/j.avb.2011.02.008 | date = March–April 2011 | url = http://hub.hku.hk/bitstream/10722/134467/1/Content.pdf | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151208161311/http://hub.hku.hk/bitstream/10722/134467/1/Content.pdf | archivedate = 2015-12-08 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Chan | first = Ko Ling | title = Gender symmetry in the self-reporting of intimate partner violence | journal = Journal of Interpersonal Violence | volume = 27 | issue = 2 | pages = 263–286 | doi = 10.1177/0886260511416463 | pmid = 21920874 | date = January 2012 | url = http://hub.hku.hk/bitstream/10722/134462/1/Content.pdf | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151208152121/http://hub.hku.hk/bitstream/10722/134462/1/Content.pdf | archivedate = 2015-12-08 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Rose | first = Susan D. | contribution = Gender violence: the problem | editor-last = Rose | editor-first = Susan D. | title = Challenging global gender violence: the global clothesline project | pages = 12–13 | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | location = New York | year = 2014 | isbn = 9781137388483 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HZsKAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA12 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160501065849/https://books.google.com/books?id=HZsKAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA12 | archivedate = 2016-05-01 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Normalization (sociology)|Normalization]] of domestic violence in those who experience covert forms of abuse, or have been abused by multiple partners, for long periods of time, reduces the likelihood of recognizing, and therefore reporting, domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Boundless | author-link = Boundless (company) | contribution = Spousal abuse | editor-last = Boundless | editor-link = Boundless (company) | title = Sociology | pages = 898–899 | publisher = [[Boundless (company)|Boundless]] | location = Boston, Massachusetts | isbn = 9781940464374}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=kbLpAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA899 Details.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151022140457/https://books.google.com/books?id=kbLpAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA899 |date=2015-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many organizations have made efforts to use gender-neutral terms when referring to perpetration and victimization.

Researchers have also found different outcomes for men and women in response to intimate partner violence. A 2012 review from the journal ''[[Psychology of Violence]]'' found that women suffered disproportionately as a result of intimate partner violence, especially in terms of injuries, fear, and [[posttraumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0026296 |title=Gender differences in intimate partner violence outcomes |journal=Psychology of Violence |volume=2 |pages=42–57 |year=2012 |last1=Caldwell |first1=Jennifer E |last2=Swan |first2=Suzanne C |last3=Woodbrown |first3=V. Diane }}&lt;/ref&gt; The review also found that 70% of female victims in one study were "very frightened" in response to IPV from their partners, but 85% of male victims reported "no fear", and that IPV mediated the satisfaction of the relationship for women but not for men.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Hamberger's (2005) review found that men tend to respond to female partner-initiated IPV with laughter and amusement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hamberger|first=L.

A 2013 review examined studies from five [[continents]] and the correlation between a country's level of gender inequality and rates of domestic violence. The authors found that when partner abuse is defined broadly to include emotional abuse, any kind of hitting, and who hits first, partner abuse is relatively even. They also stated if one examines who is physically harmed and how seriously, expresses more fear, and experiences subsequent psychological problems, domestic violence is significantly gendered toward women as victims.&lt;ref name="Eugenio"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Esquivel-Santovena |first1=Esteban Eugenio | last2=Lambert | first2=Teri | last3=Hamel | first3=John | title = Partner abuse worldwide | journal = Partner Abuse | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–8 | doi = 10.1891/1946-6560.4.1.e14 |url =http://domesticviolenceresearch.org/pdf/PASK.Tables14.Revised.pdf| date = January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws on domestic violence vary by country. While it is generally outlawed in the [[Western world]], this is not the case in many [[developing countries]]. For instance, in 2010, the United Arab Emirates's Supreme Court ruled that a man has the right to physically discipline his wife and children as long as he does not leave physical marks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = CNN Wire Staff | title = Court in UAE says beating wife, child OK if no marks are left | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120325143850/http://articles.cnn.com/2010-10-19/world/uae.court.ruling_1_islamic-law-sharia-law-ruling?_s=PM%3AWORLD | archive-date = 25 March 2012 | url = https://articles.cnn.com/2010-10-19/world/uae.court.ruling_1_islamic-law-sharia-law-ruling?_s=PM:WORLD | website = cnn.com | publisher = CNN | date = 19 October 2010 | access-date = 24 January 2014 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The social acceptability of domestic violence also differs by country. While in most developed countries domestic violence is considered unacceptable by most people, in many regions of the world the views are different: according to a [[UNICEF]] survey, the percentage of women aged 15–49 who think that a husband is justified in hitting or beating his wife under certain circumstances is, for example: 90% in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Jordan]], 87% in [[Mali]], 86% in [[Guinea]] and [[Timor-Leste]], 81% in [[Laos]], 80% in [[Central African Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Childinfo | title = Attitudes towards wife beating: percentage of women aged 15–49 who think that a husband/partner is justified in hitting or beating his wife/partner under certain circumstances | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140704112113/http://www.childinfo.org/attitudes_data.php | archive-date = 4 July 2014 | url = https://www.childinfo.org/attitudes_data.php | website = childinfo.org | publisher = Childinfo: monitoring the situation of children and women | accessdate = 8 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Refusing to submit to a husband's wishes is a common reason given for justification of violence in developing countries:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Home page | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140214095207/http://www.measuredhs.com/ | archive-date = 14 February 2014 | url = https://www.measuredhs.com/ | publisher = Measure DHS (Demographic and Health Surveys): Quality information to plan, monitor and improve population, health, and nutrition programs | date = 4 April 2013 | accessdate = 8 September 2013 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; for instance 62.4% of women in [[Tajikistan]] justify wife beating if the wife goes out without telling the husband; 68% if she argues with him; 47.9% if she refuses to have sex with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = State Committee on Statistics of the Republic of Takistan | title = Tajikistan multiple indicator cluster survey 2005, final report | publisher = State Committee on Statistics of the Republic of Takistan | url = http://www.childinfo.org/files/MICS3_Tajikistan_FinalReport_2005_Eng.pdf| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150923213608/http://www.childinfo.org/files/MICS3_Tajikistan_FinalReport_2005_Eng.pdf| dead-url = yes| archive-date = 2015-09-23| location = Dushanbe, Tajikistan | date = 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women]] (1993) states that "[[violence against women]] is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women, which has led to domination over and discrimination against women by men and to the prevention of the full advancement of women, and that violence against women is one of the crucial social mechanisms by which women are forced into a subordinate position compared with men".&lt;ref name="UN GA Res" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = UNFPA | author-link = United Nations Population Fund | title = UNFPA strategy and framework for action to addressing gender-based violence 2008–2011 | url = http://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/2009_add_gen_vio.pdf | publisher = United Nations Population Fund | location = New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 9780897149518 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://perma-archives.org/warc/20160112155127/http://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/2009_add_gen_vio.pdf | archivedate = 2016-01-12 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women classifies violence against women into three categories: that occurring in the family (DV), that occurring within the general community, and that perpetrated or condoned by the State.&lt;ref name="UN GA Res" /&gt;

The Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment, and Eradication of Violence against Women defines violence against women as "any act or conduct, based on gender, which causes death or physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, whether in the public or the private sphere".&lt;ref name=Treaties&gt;{{cite web | title = Multilateral treaties: Inter-American convention on the prevention, punishment and eradication of violence against women "Convention of Belém do Pará" | url = http://www.oas.org/juridico/english/treaties/a-61.html | website = oas.org | publisher = Department of International Law, [[Organization of American States]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160413001826/http://www.oas.org/juridico/english/treaties/a-61.html | archivedate = 2016-04-13 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly with the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women, it classifies violence against women into three categories; one of which being DV – defined as violence against women which takes place "within the family or domestic unit or within any other interpersonal relationship, whether or not the perpetrator shares or has shared the same residence with the woman".&lt;ref name=Treaties /&gt;

The [[Maputo Protocol]] adopted a broader definition, defining violence against women as: "all acts perpetrated against women which cause or could cause them physical, sexual, psychological, and economic harm, including the threat to take such acts; or to undertake the imposition of arbitrary restrictions on or deprivation of fundamental freedoms in private or public life in peace time and during situations of armed conflicts or of war".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = ACHPR | author-link = African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights | title = Protocol to the African charter on human and peoples' rights on the rights of women in Africa | url = http://www.achpr.org/instruments/women-protocol/ | publisher = [[African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights]] | date = 11 July 2003 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151202092756/http://www.achpr.org/instruments/women-protocol | archivedate = 2 December 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Femicide]] is usually defined as the gender-based killing of women by men, although the exact definitions vary.  Femicides often occur in the context of DV, such as honor killings or dowry killings. For statistical purposes, femicide is often defined as any killing of a woman. The top countries by rate of femicide are [[El Salvador]], [[Jamaica]], [[Guatemala]], [[South Africa]] and [[Russia]] (data from 2004–09).&lt;ref name="smallarmssurvey.org"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Small Arms Survey | author-link = Small Arms Survey | title = Femicide: a global problem — research note 14 | journal = [[Small Arms Survey|Small Arms Survey Research Notes]] | date = February 2012 | url = http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/about-us/highlights/highlight-rn14.html | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160205035809/http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/about-us/highlights/highlight-rn14.html | archivedate = 2016-02-05 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in El Salvador and Colombia, which have a very high rate of femicide, only three percent of all femicides are committed by a current or former intimate partner, while in [[Cyprus]], [[France]], and [[Portugal]] former and current partners are responsible for more than 80% of all cases of femicide.&lt;ref name="smallarmssurvey.org"/&gt;

While the general literature indicates that adolescent boys and girls engage in IPV at about equal rates, females are more likely to use less dangerous forms of physical violence (e.g. pushing, pinching, slapping, scratching or kicking), while males are more likely to punch, strangle, beat, burn, or threaten with weapons. Males are also more likely to use sexual aggression, although both genders are equally likely to pressure their partner into sexual activities. In addition, females are four times more likely to respond as having experienced rape and are more likely to suffer fatal injuries inflicted by their partner, or to need psychological help as a result of the abuse. Females are more likely to consider IPV a serious problem than are their male counterparts, who are more likely to disregard female-perpetrated IPV.&lt;ref name="O'Donohue"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Poet&gt;{{citation | last1 = Poet | first1 = Andrea | last2 = Swiderski | first2 = Catherine R. | last3 = McHugh | first3 = Maureen C. | contribution = Developing teen relationships: the role of violence | editor-last = Paludi | editor-first = Michele A. | title = The psychology of teen violence and victimization, volume 1, Part III.

There is a strong link between domestic violence and child abuse. Since domestic violence is a pattern of behavior, these incidences may increase in severity and frequency, resulting in an increased probability the children themselves will become victims. The estimated overlap between domestic violence and child abuse ranges from 30 to 50 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vawnet.org/Assoc_Files_VAWnet/PCAA_DVandChild.pdf|date=September 1996|title=The Relationship Between Domestic Violence and Child Abuse|publisher=Prevent Child Abuse America|accessdate=2016-04-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151207171540/http://www.vawnet.org/Assoc_Files_VAWnet/PCAA_DVandChild.pdf|archivedate=2015-12-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gay and lesbian relationships have been identified as a risk factor for abuse in certain populations.&lt;ref name="Siemieniuk 2010 763–770"/&gt; LGBT people in some parts of the world have very little legal protection from DV, because engaging in homosexual acts is itself prohibited by the "[[sodomy laws]]" of those jurisdictions (as of 2014, same-sex sexual acts are punishable by imprisonment in 70 countries and by death in another 5 countries)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Rodgers | first1 = Lucy | last2 = Gutierrez Martin | first2 = Pablo Gutierrez Martin | last3 = Rees | first3 = Martyn | last4 = Connor | first4 = Steven | title = Where is it illegal to be gay? | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-25927595 | work = [[BBC News]] | publisher = BBC | date = 10 February 2014 | accessdate = 22 August 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150812100906/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-25927595 | archivedate = 12 August 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and these legal prohibitions prevent LGBT victims of DV from reporting the abuse to authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Serra | first = Natalie E. | title = Queering international human rights: LGBT access to domestic violence remedies | journal = Journal of Gender, Social Policy &amp; the Law | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 583–607 | date = 2013 | url = http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1611&amp;context=jgspl | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140819082107/http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1611&amp;context=jgspl | archivedate = 2014-08-19 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the face of the 2003 Supreme Court decision, 13 US states have refused to remove sodomy laws from legislation as of 2013.&lt;ref name="Chen 2013"/&gt;

People in same-sex relationships face special obstacles in dealing with the issues that some researchers have labeled "the double closet". A 1997 Canadian study by Mark W. Lehman suggests similarities include frequency (approximately one in every four couples); manifestations (emotional, physical, financial, etc.); co-existent situations (unemployment, substance abuse, low self-esteem); victims' reactions (fear, feelings of helplessness, hypervigilance); and reasons for staying (love, can work it out, things will change, denial).&lt;ref name="Lehman 1997"&gt;{{cite book | last = Lehman | first = Mark Warren | title = At the end of the rainbow: a report on gay male domestic violence and abuse | publisher = Minnesota Center Against Violence and Abuse | location = St. Paul, Minnesota | date = 1997 | url = http://www.mincava.umn.edu/documents/rainbow/At%20The%20End%20Of%20The%20Rainbow.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 30 December 2007 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080216045419/http://www.mincava.umn.edu/documents/rainbow/At%20The%20End%20Of%20The%20Rainbow.pdf | archivedate = 16 February 2008 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies conducted by Emory University in 2014 identified 24 trigger for partner violence through web-based surveys, ranging from drugs and alcohol to safe-sex discussions.&lt;ref name="Finneran 2014"/&gt; A general theme of power and control seems to underlie abuse in both heterosexual and homosexual relationships.&lt;ref name="Chen 2013"/&gt;

At the same time, significant differences, unique issues, and deceptive myths are typically present.&lt;ref name="Lehman 1997"/&gt; Lehman, regarding his 1997 survey, points to added discrimination and fears that gay and lesbian individuals may face. This includes potential dismissal by police and some social services, a lack of support from peers, fear of attracting negative stigma toward the [[gay community]], the impact of [[HIV/AIDS]] status in keeping partners together (due to health care insurance/access, or guilt), threat of [[outing]], and encountering supportive services that are targeted, or structured for the needs of heterosexual women, and may not meet the needs of gay men or lesbians. This service structure can make LGBTQ victims feel even more isolated and misunderstood than they may already because of their minority status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Same-sex abuse|url=https://www.womenslaw.org/laws_state_type.php?id=13586&amp;state_code=PG&amp;open_id=all|website=womenslaw.org|publisher=National Network to End Domestic Violence, Inc.|accessdate=24 November 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320065837/http://womenslaw.org/laws_state_type.php?id=13586&amp;state_code=PG&amp;open_id=all|archivedate=20 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lehman, however, stated that "due to the limited number of returned responses and non-random sampling methodology the findings of this work are not generalizable beyond the sample" of 32 initial respondents and final 10 who completed the more in-depth survey.&lt;ref name="Lehman 1997"/&gt; Particularly, sexual stressors and HIV/AIDS status have emerged as significant differences in same-sex partner violence.&lt;ref name="Finneran 2014"/&gt;

===Underreporting===
DV is among the most underreported crimes worldwide for both men and women.&lt;ref name="Cengage Learning"/&gt;&lt;ref name=concannon/&gt; A 2011 review article by intimate partner violence researcher Ko Ling Chan found men tended to under-report their own perpetration of domestic violence while women were more likely to under-report their victimization and over-estimate their own violence perpetration.&lt;ref name=chan2011/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Chan | first = Ko Ling | title = Gender symmetry in the self-reporting of intimate partner violence | journal = Journal of Interpersonal Violence | volume = 27 | issue = 2 | pages = 263–286 | doi = 10.1177/0886260511416463 | pmid = 21920874 | date = January 2012 | url = http://hub.hku.hk/bitstream/10722/134462/1/Content.pdf | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151208152121/http://hub.hku.hk/bitstream/10722/134462/1/Content.pdf | archivedate = 2015-12-08 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Financial or familial dependence, normalization of violence, and [[Self-blame|self-blaming]] were found to reduce the likelihood of self-reporting victimization in women. By contrast, fear and avoidance of legal consequences, the tendency to blame their partner, and a narrative focus on their own needs and emotions reduced the likelihood of self-reporting perpetration in men.&lt;ref name=chan2011/&gt;

A 2014 study conducted across the 28 member states of the [[European Union]] found that only 14% of women reported their most serious incident of intimate partner violence to the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = UN Women | author-link = UN Women | title = Facts and figures: ending violence against women | url = http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures | website = unwomen.org | publisher = UN Women | accessdate = 22 August 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150827022736/http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures | archivedate = 27 August 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 report on DV in [[Northern Ireland]] found that "under-reporting is a concern and domestic abuse is the least likely of all violent crimes to be reported to the police".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = Domestic call 'every 23 minutes' | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/7960591.stm | work = [[BBC news]] | publisher = BBC | location = Northern Ireland | date = 24 March 2009 | accessdate = 22 August 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151211064421/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/7960591.stm | archivedate = 11 December 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Men face additional gender related barriers in reporting, due to social stigmas regarding male victimization, and an increased likelihood of being overlooked by healthcare providers.&lt;ref name="Riviello 129"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Finley 163"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Criminal Investigation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clearinghouse"/&gt;

===Social views===
[[File:Advertisement for Littleton Butter (31 December 1903).jpg|thumb|In this 1903 advertisement for Littleton Butter, domestic violence is portrayed as embarrassing but normal.]]

Social views on domestic violence vary from person to person, and from region to region, but in many places outside the West, the concept is very poorly understood. This is because in most of these countries the relation between the husband and wife is not considered one of equals, but instead one in which the wife must submit herself to the husband. This is codified in the laws of some countries – for example, in [[Yemen]], marriage regulations state that a wife must obey her husband and must not leave home without his permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Amnesty International | author-link = Amnesty International | title = Yemen's dark side: discrimination and violence against women and girls | url = https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde31/014/2009/en/ | publisher = [[Amnesty International]] | date = November 2009 | access-date = 11 April 2014 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151210214138/https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde31/014/2009/en/ | archivedate = 10 December 2015 | df =  }} [http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/docs/ngos/Yemen%27s%20darkside-discrimination_Yemen_HRC101.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160326165645/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/docs/ngos/Yemen%27s%20darkside-discrimination_Yemen_HRC101.pdf |date=2016-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Violence against Women in Families and Relationships'', "Globally, wife-beating is seen as justified in some circumstances by a majority of the population in various countries, most commonly in situations of actual or suspected infidelity by wives or their "disobedience" toward a husband or partner." &lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Flood | first1 = Michael | last2 = Pease | first2 = Robert | last3 = Taylor | first3 = Natalie | last4 = Webster | first4 = Kim | author-link = Michael Flood | contribution = Reshaping attitudes towards violence against women | editor-last1 = Buzawa | editor-first1 = Eve S. | editor-last2 = Stark | editor-first2 = Evan | title = Violence against women in families and relationships, Volume IV: the media and cultural attitudes | page = 184 | publisher = Praeger/ABC-CLIO | location = Santa Barbara, California | year = 2009 | isbn = 9780275998547}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=EE8dkgEACAAJ&amp;dq=Violence+against+women+9780275998547 Details.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110213354/https://books.google.com/books?id=EE8dkgEACAAJ&amp;dq=Violence+against+women+9780275998547 |date=2017-01-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These violent acts against a wife are often not considered a form of abuse by society (both men and women) but are considered to have been provoked by the behavior of the wife, who is seen as being at fault. While beatings of wives are often a response to "inappropriate" behaviors, in many places extreme acts such as [[honor killing]]s are approved by a high section of the society. In one survey, 33.4% of teenagers in  [[Jordan]]'s capital city, [[Amman]], approved of honor killings. This survey was carried in the capital of Jordan, which is much more liberal than other parts of the country; the researchers said that "We would expect that in the more rural and traditional parts of Jordan, support for honor killings would be even higher".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Maher |first=Ahmed |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-22992365 |title=Many Jordan teenagers 'support honour killings' |work=[[BBC news]] |publisher=BBC |date=20 June 2013 |accessdate=9 September 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921234334/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-22992365 |archivedate=21 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2012 news story, ''The Washington Post'' reported, "The Reuters TrustLaw group named [[India]] one of the worst countries in the world for women this year, partly because domestic violence there is often seen as deserved. A 2012 report by UNICEF found that 57 percent of Indian boys and 53 percent of girls between the ages of 15 and 19 think wife-beating is justified."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Khazan | first1 = Olga | last2 = Lakshmi | first2 = Rama | title = 10 reasons why India has a sexual violence problem | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2012/12/29/india-rape-victim-dies-sexual-violence-proble/ | work = [[The Washington Post]] | publisher = [[Jeff Bezos|Nash Holdings LLC]] | date = 29 December 2012 | access-date = 9 December 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150512153618/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2012/12/29/india-rape-victim-dies-sexual-violence-proble/ | archivedate = 12 May 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In conservative cultures, a wife dressing in attire deemed insufficiently modest can suffer serious violence at the hands of her husband or relatives, with such violent responses seen as appropriate by most of the society: in a survey, 62.8% of women in [[Afghanistan]] said that a husband  is justified in beating his wife if she wears inappropriate clothes.&lt;ref name="cso.gov.af"&gt;[https://cso.gov.af/Content/files/AMICS.pdf Monitoring the Situation of Women &amp; Children.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205040032/http://cso.gov.af/Content/files/AMICS.pdf |date=2016-02-05 }} Afghanistan Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 2010/2011.

According to [[Antonia Parvanova]], one of the difficulties of dealing legally with the issue of DV is that men in many male dominated societies do not understand that inflicting violence against their wives is against the law. She said, referring to a case that occurred in Bulgaria, "A husband was tried for severely beating his wife and when the judge asked him if he understood what he did and if he's sorry, the husband said "But she's my wife". He doesn't even understand that he has no right to beat her."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = Seven women die in EU each day due to domestic violence | url = http://www.novinite.com/articles/158764/Seven+Women+Die+in+EU+Each+Day+Due+to+Domestic+Violence | work = [[Novinite]] | publisher = One Click Media Group | location = Bulgaria | date = 8 March 2014 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150405141612/http://www.novinite.com/articles/158764/Seven+Women+Die+in+EU+Each+Day+Due+to+Domestic+Violence | archivedate = 5 April 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNFPA]] writes that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = UNFPA | author-link = United Nations Population Fund | title = Taking a stand against practices that harm women | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150404082023/http://web.lb.unfpa.org/gender/practices.htm | archive-date = 4 April 2015 | url = http://web.lb.unfpa.org/gender/practices.htm | publisher = United Nations Population Fund | date = April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
"In some developing countries, practices that subjugate and harm women – such as wife-beating, killings in the name of honour, female genital mutilation/cutting and dowry deaths – are condoned as being part of the natural order of things".

Strong views among the population in certain societies that reconciliation is more appropriate than punishment in cases of domestic violence are also another cause of legal impunity; a study found that 64% of public officials in Colombia said that if it were in their hands to solve a case of intimate partner violence, the action they would take would be to encourage the parties to reconcile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Álvarez | first = Camilo Segura | title = Colombia sigue legitimando la violencia contra la mujer | url = http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/politica/colombia-sigue-legitimando-violencia-contra-mujer-articulo-547754 | work = [[El Espectador]] | publisher = [[Fidel Cano Correa]] | date = 5 March 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150510123028/http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/politica/colombia-sigue-legitimando-violencia-contra-mujer-articulo-547754 | archivedate = 10 May 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Victim blaming]] is also prevalent in many societies, including in Western countries: a 2010 [[Eurobarometer]] poll found that 52% of respondents agreed with the assertion that the "provocative behaviour of women" was a cause of violence against women; with  respondents in Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta and Slovenia being most likely to agree with the assertion (more than 70% in each of these countries).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = TNS | author-link = Taylor Nelson Sofres | contribution = Annexes: Tables: QC4.11 Please tell me whether you consider each of the following to be a cause of domestic violence against women, or not?: The provocative behaviour of women. | editor-last = TNS | editor-link = Taylor Nelson Sofres | title = Special Eurobarometer 344: Domestic violence against women | url = https://open-data.europa.eu/en/data/dataset/S816_73_2_EBS344 | publisher = [[European Commission]] | location = Brussels, Belgium | date = September 2010 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151211000741/https://open-data.europa.eu/en/data/dataset/S816_73_2_EBS344 | archivedate = 2015-12-11 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===

===Custom and tradition===
[[File:Say no to dowry.jpg|thumb|Anti-dowry poster in [[Bangalore, India]]]]
Local customs and traditions are often responsible for maintaining certain forms of DV. Such customs and traditions include son preference (the desire of a family to have a boy and not a girl, which is strongly prevalent in parts of Asia), which can lead to abuse and neglect of girl children by disappointed family members; child and forced marriages; [[dowry]]; the hierarchic [[caste]] system which stigmatizes "lower castes" and "untouchables", leading to discrimination and restricted opportunities of the females and thus making them more vulnerable to abuse; strict dress codes for women that may be enforced through violence by family members; strong requirement of female virginity before the wedding and violence related to non-conforming women and girls; taboos about [[menstruation]] leading to females being isolated and shunned during the time of menstruation; [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM); ideologies of marital 'conjugal rights' to sex which justify marital rape; the importance given to '[[family honor]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = UNESCAP | author-link = United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific | title = Harmful traditional practices in three counties of South Asia: culture, human rights and violence against women | url = http://www.unescap.org/resources/harmful-traditional-practices-three-countries-south-asia-culture-human-rights-and-violence | publisher = [[United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific]] | date = November 2012 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151211144247/http://www.unescap.org/resources/harmful-traditional-practices-three-countries-south-asia-culture-human-rights-and-violence | archivedate = 2015-12-11 | df =  }} Gender and Development Discussion Paper Series No. 21.

According to a 2003 report by Human Rights Watch, "Customs such as the payment of '[[bride price]]' (payment made by a man to the family of a woman he wishes to marry), whereby a man essentially purchases  his wife’s sexual favors and reproductive capacity, underscore men’s socially sanctioned entitlement to dictate the terms of sex, and to use force to do so."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Human Rights Watch | author-link = Human Rights Watch | title = Policy paralysis: a call for action on HIV/AIDS-related human rights abuses against women and girls in Africa | url = https://www.hrw.org/reports/2003/africa1203/africa1203.pdf | publisher = Human Rights Watch | date = December 2003 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160311131419/https://www.hrw.org/reports/2003/africa1203/africa1203.pdf | archivedate = 2016-03-11 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Health Organization has stated that women in abusive relations are at significantly higher risk of HIV/AIDS. WHO states that women in violent relations have difficulty negotiating [[safer sex]] with their partners, are often forced to have sex, and find it difficult to ask for appropriate testing when they think they may be infected with HIV.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite book | last = WHO | author-link = World Health Organization | title = Violence against women and HIV/AIDS: critical intersections: intimate partner violence and HIV/AIDS | publisher = World Health Organization | location = Geneva, Switzerland | url = http://www.who.int/hac/techguidance/pht/InfoBulletinIntimatePartnerViolenceFinal.pdf | series = Information Bulletin Series | id = Bulletin no. 1 | date = November 2004 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131025220637/http://www.who.int/hac/techguidance/pht/InfoBulletinIntimatePartnerViolenceFinal.pdf | archivedate = 2013-10-25 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A decade of cross-sectional research from Rwanda, Tanzania, South Africa, and India, has consistently found women who have experienced partner violence to be more likely to be infected with HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = UN Women | author-link = UN Women | title = Facts and figures: ending violence against women | url = http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures#notes | website = unwomen.org | publisher = UN Women | date = October 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150827022736/http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures#notes | archivedate = 2015-08-27 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO stated that:&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is a compelling case to end intimate partner violence both in its own right as well as to reduce women and girls vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. The evidence on the linkages between violence against women and HIV/AIDS highlights that there are direct and indirect mechanisms by which the two interact.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Same-sex relationships are similarly affected by HIV/AIDS status in domestic violence. Research by Heintz and Melendez found that same-sex individuals may have difficulty breaching the topic of safe-sex for reasons such as "decreased perception of control over sex, fear of violence, and unequal power distributions..."&lt;ref name="Heintz 2006"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Heintz | first1 = Adam J. | last2 = Melendez | first2 = Rita M. | title = Intimate partner violence and HIV/STD risk among lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals | journal = Journal of Interpersonal Violence | volume = 21 | issue = 2 | pages = 193–208 | doi = 10.1177/0886260505282104 | pmid = 16368761 | date = February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of those who reported violence in the study, about 50% reported forced sexual experiences, of which only half reported the use of safe sex measures. Barriers to safer-sex included fear of abuse, and deception in safe-sex practices. Heintz and Melendez's research ultimately concluded that sexual assault/abuse in same-sex relationships provides a major concern for HIV/AIDS infection as it decreases instances of safe-sex. Furthermore, these incidents create additional fear and stigma surrounding safe-sex conversations and knowing ones STD status.&lt;ref name="Heintz 2006"/&gt;

===Legislation===
Lack of adequate legislation which criminalizes domestic violence, or, alternatively legislation which prohibits consensual behaviors, may hinder the progress in regard to reducing the incidence of DV. Amnesty International’s Secretary General has stated that: "It is unbelievable that in the twenty-first century some countries are condoning child marriage and marital rape while others are outlawing abortion, sex outside marriage and same-sex sexual activity – even punishable by death."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Amnesty International | author-link = Amnesty International | title = Women and girls: sexual and reproductive rights under threat worldwide | url = https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/sexual-and-reproductive-rights-under-threat-worldwide-2014-03-06 | website = amnesty.org | publisher = [[Amnesty International]] | date = 6 March 2014 | accessdate = 22 August 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141206225115/http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/sexual-and-reproductive-rights-under-threat-worldwide-2014-03-06 | archivedate = 6 December 2014 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to WHO, "one of the most common forms of violence against women is that performed by a husband or male partner." The WHO notes that such violence is often ignored because often "legal systems and cultural norms do not treat as a crime, but rather as a 'private' family matter, or a normal part of life."&lt;ref name="who.intB"&gt;{{cite book | last = WHO | author-link = World Health Organization | title = Gender, equity, human rights: gender based violence | publisher = World Health Organization | location = Geneva, Switzerland | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150423143519/http://www.who.int/gender/violence/gbv/en/ | archive-date = 23 April 2015 | url = http://www.who.int/gender/violence/gbv/en/ | accessdate = 22 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The criminalization of [[adultery]] has been cited as inciting violence against women, as these prohibitions are often meant, in law or in practice, to control women's and not men's behavior; and are used to rationalize acts of violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = OHCHR | author-link = Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights | title = Statement by the United Nations Working Group on discrimination against women in law and in practice | url = http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=12672 | publisher = [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] | date = 18 October 2012 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140426235132/http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=12672 | archivedate = 26 April 2014 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = UN Women | author-link = UN Women | title = Decriminalization of adultery and defenses | url = http://www.endvawnow.org/en/articles/738-decriminalization-of-adultery-and-defenses.html%29 | website = endvawnow.org | publisher = Virtual Knowledge Centre to End Violence Against Women and Girls, UN Women | accessdate = 22 August 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160108112544/http://www.endvawnow.org/en/articles/738-decriminalization-of-adultery-and-defenses.html%29 | archivedate = 8 January 2016 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to High Commissioner for Human Rights [[Navi Pillay]]: "Some have argued, and continue to argue, that family violence is placed outside the conceptual framework of international human rights. However, under international laws and standards, there is a clear State responsibility to uphold women’s rights and ensure freedom from discrimination, which includes the responsibility to prevent, protect and provide redress – regardless of sex, and regardless of a person’s status in the family."&lt;ref name="ohchr.org"&gt;{{cite book | last = OHCHR | author-link = Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights | title = High Commissioner speaks out against domestic violence and "honour killing" on occasion of International Women's Day | url = http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=9869&amp;LangID=E | publisher = [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] | date = 8 March 2010 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140714182718/http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=9869&amp;LangID=E | archivedate = 14 July 2014 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ability to leave===
The ability of victims of domestic violence to leave the relationship is crucial for preventing further abuse. In traditional communities, divorced women often feel rejected and ostracized. In order to avoid this stigma, many women prefer to remain in the marriage and endure the abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Fields | first = Rona | contribution = The Negev Bedouin: a contemporary remnant of ancient tribal society | editor-last = Fields | editor-first = Rona | title = Against violence against women: the case for gender as a protected class | pages = 63–64 | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | location = Basingstoke | year = 2014 | isbn = 9781137439178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When she separates from her husband or when he dies, she risks losing her home, land, household goods and other property. Failure to ensure equal property rights upon separation or divorce discourages women from leaving violent marriages, as women may be forced to choose between violence at home and destitution in the street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Manjoo | first = Rashida | author-link = Rashida Manjoo | title = Statement by Ms. Rashida Manjoo, Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its cause and consequences | url = https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/csw/csw56/statements/statement-spec-rap-manjoo.pdf | publisher = UN Women | location = New York | date = February 2012 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170318105200/http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/csw/csw56/statements/statement-spec-rap-manjoo.pdf | archivedate = 2017-03-18 | df =  }} [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women#Session reports|CSW56]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The legal inability to obtain a divorce is also a factor in the proliferation of domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Conway-Turner | first1 = Kate | last2 = Cherrin | first2 = Suzanne | contribution = Sexual harassment: can women be comfortable in the public world? | editor-last1 = Conway-Turner | editor-first1 = Kate | editor-last2 = Cherrin | editor-first2 = Suzanne | title = Women, families, and feminist politics: a global exploration | page = 198 | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis | location = Oxford New York | isbn = 9781560239352| date = 1998-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cultures where [[arranged marriage|marriages are arranged]] between families, a woman who attempts a separation or divorce without the consent of her husband and extended family or relatives may risk being subjected to "honor"- based violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Mayell | first = Hillary | title = Thousands of women killed for family "honor" | url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/02/0212_020212_honorkilling_2.html | work = [[National Geographic News]] | publisher = [[National Geographic Society]] | date = 12 February 2002 | accessdate = 22 August 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151019011522/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/02/0212_020212_honorkilling_2.html | archivedate = 19 October 2015 | df =  }} [http://www.unl.edu/rhames/courses/212/readings/honor-kil-ng.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151129092131/http://www.unl.edu/rhames/courses/212/readings/honor-kil-ng.pdf |date=2015-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hbv-awareness.com"&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff writer | title = FAQ: frequently asked questions about honour based violence (HBV) and honour killings | url = http://hbv-awareness.com/faq/ | website = hbv-awareness.com | publisher = [[Deeyah Khan#Honour Based Violence Awareness (HBVA)|Honour Based Violence Awareness (HBVA)]] | accessdate = 22 August 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150815114026/http://hbv-awareness.com/faq/ | archivedate = 15 August 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The custom of [[bride price]] also makes leaving a marriage more difficult: if a wife want to leave, the husband may demand back the bride price from her family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Protecting the girl child: using the law to end child, early and forced marriage and related human rights violations | url = http://www.equalitynow.org/sites/default/files/Protecting_the_Girl_Child.pdf | publisher = [[Equality Now]] | date = January 2014 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150528120452/http://www.equalitynow.org/sites/default/files/Protecting_the_Girl_Child.pdf | archivedate = 2015-05-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lelieveld | first = Marlijn | title = Child protection in the Somali region of Ethiopia | url = http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/sites/default/files/docs/FINALChild_Protection_in_the_Somali_Region_30511.pdf | publisher = [[Save the Children]] | date = April 2011 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150924095119/http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/sites/default/files/docs/FINALChild_Protection_in_the_Somali_Region_30511.pdf | archivedate = 2015-09-24 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Stange | first1 = Mary Z. | last2 = Oyster | first2 = Carol K. | last3 = Sloan | first3 = Jane E. | contribution = Equatorial Guinea | editor-last1 = Stange | editor-first1 = Mary Z. | editor-last2 = Oyster | editor-first2 = Carol K. | editor-last3 = Sloan | editor-first3 = Jane E. | title = Encyclopedia of women in today's world, volume 1 | page = 496 | publisher = Sage Reference | location = Thousand Oaks, California | year = 2011 | isbn = 9781412976855}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In advanced nations like the [[United Kingdom]] domestic violence victims may have difficulties getting alternative housing which can force them to stay in the abusive relationship.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-41803342 The domestic violence victims 'left begging for a home'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171031124354/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-41803342 |date=2017-10-31 }} ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Many domestic violence victims delay leaving the abuser because they have pets and are afraid of what will happen to the pets if they leave.  Safehouses need to be more accepting of pets, many refuse to accept pets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-46404837/the-safehouse-for-women-and-pets-to-flee-abuse The safehouse for women and pets to flee abuse] ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Individual versus family unit rights===
The way the individual rights of a family member versus the rights of the family as a unit are balanced vary significantly in different societies. This may influence the degree to which a government may be willing to investigate family incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Human Rights Watch | author-link = Human Rights Watch | title = Uzbekistan: Sacrificing women to save the family? Domestic violence in Uzbekistan | url = https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/uzbekistan/uzbek0701.pdf | website = hrw.org | publisher = Human Rights Watch | date = July 2001 | accessdate = 22 August 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160205035651/https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/uzbekistan/uzbek0701.pdf | archivedate = 5 February 2016 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cultures, individual members of the family are expected to sacrifice almost completely their own interests in favor of the interests of the family as a whole. What is viewed as an undue expression of personal autonomy is condemned as unacceptable. In these cultures the family predominates over the individual, and where this interacts with [[family honor|cultures of honor]], individualistic choice that may damage the family reputation in the community may result in extreme punishment, such as honor killings.&lt;ref name="hbv-awareness.com"/&gt;

===Immigration policies===
In some countries, the [[immigration policy]] is tied to whether the person desiring citizenship is married to his/her sponsor. This can lead to persons  being trapped in violent relations – such persons may risk deportation if they attempt to separate (they may be accused of having entered into a [[sham marriage]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Douglas | first1 = Debbie | last2 = Go | first2 = Avvy | last3 = Blackstock | first3 = Sarah | title = Editorial opinion: Canadian immigration changes force women to stay with sponsoring spouse for two years | url = https://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorialopinion/2012/12/05/canadian_immigration_changes_force_women_to_stay_with_sponsoring_spouse_for_two_years.html | work = [[Toronto Star|The Star]] | publisher = [[Star Media Group]], [[Torstar|Torstar Corporation]] | location = Toronto, Canada | date = 5 December 2012 | accessdate = 22 August 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150904192500/http://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorialopinion/2012/12/05/canadian_immigration_changes_force_women_to_stay_with_sponsoring_spouse_for_two_years.html | archivedate = 4 September 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Domestic violence victims must not be trapped by deportation fears | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141006110720/http://www.immigrantcouncil.ie/research-publications/publications/694-domestic-violence-victims-must-not-be-trapped-by-deportation-fears | archive-date = 6 October 2014 | url = http://www.immigrantcouncil.ie/research-publications/publications/694-domestic-violence-victims-must-not-be-trapped-by-deportation-fears | website = immigrantcouncil.ie | publisher = The Immigrant Council of Ireland (ICI) | date = May 2013 }} [http://immigrantcouncil.ie/files/publications/1a2d6-briefing_document_dv_-_longer_version_-_final_2013.pdf Briefing document by the Domestic Violence Coalition.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424204545/http://immigrantcouncil.ie/files/publications/1a2d6-briefing_document_dv_-_longer_version_-_final_2013.pdf |date=2016-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = AFP in Sydney | title = Australian migrants trapped in 'slave-like' marriages | url = https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/aug/01/australian-migrants-slave-marriages | work = [[The Guardian]] | publisher = [[Guardian Media Group]] | date = 1 August 2014 | accessdate = 22 August 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151011091736/http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/aug/01/australian-migrants-slave-marriages | archivedate = 11 October 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Lyneham | first1 = Samantha | last2 = Richards | first2 = Kelly | title = Human trafficking involving marriage and partner migration to Australia | publisher = Australian Institute of Criminology | location = Canberra, Australia | series = Research and Public Policy Series | id = Paper no. 124 | url = http://eprints.qut.edu.au/72187/3/72187.pdf | format = PDF | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160205034638/http://eprints.qut.edu.au/72187/3/72187.pdf | archivedate = 2016-02-05 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Often the women come from cultures where they will suffer disgrace from their families if they abandon their marriage and return home, and so they prefer to stay married, therefore remaining locked in a cycle of abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Raza | first = Nusrat | title = Visa for hell | year = 2011 | publisher = Best Books Publications | location = Lahore | oclc = 772450148 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immigrant communities===
Domestic violence may happen in immigrant communities, and often there is little awareness in these communities of the laws and policies of the host country. A study among first generation South Asians in the UK found that they had little knowledge about what constituted criminal behavior under the English law. The researchers found that "There was certainly no awareness that there could be rape within a marriage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = McVeigh | first = Tracy | title = Abuse going unreported in Britain’s south Asian communities – study | url = https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/sep/19/abuse-going-unreported-in-britains-south-asian-communities-study | work = [[The Guardian]] | publisher = [[Guardian Media Group]] | date = 19 September 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160812152918/https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/sep/19/abuse-going-unreported-in-britains-south-asian-communities-study | archivedate = 12 August 2016 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cowburn | first1 = Malcolm | last2 = Gill | first2 = Aisha K. | last3 = Harrison | first3 = Karen | title = Speaking about sexual abuse in British South Asian communities: offenders, victims and the challenges of shame and reintegration | journal = Journal of Sexual Aggression, Special Issue: Community Reintegration of Sexual Offenders | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 4–15 | doi = 10.1080/13552600.2014.929188 | date = January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study in Australia showed that among the immigrant women sampled who were abused by partners and did not report it, 16.7% did not know DV was illegal, while 18.8% did not know that they could get protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Satyen | first1 = Lata | last2 = Ranganathan | first2 = Archna | last3 = Piedra | first3 = Steve | last4 = Simon | first4 = Ben | last5 = Kocsic | first5 = Jessica | title = Family violence in migrant women in Australia: strategies for migrant men to reduce the violence | date = May 2013 }} Conference paper for the White Ribbon International Conference, Sydney, Australia, 13–15 May 2013.

==Causes==
Of the most important factors in domestic violence is a belief that abuse, whether physical or verbal, is acceptable. Other factors include [[substance abuse]], [[unemployment]], mental health problems, lack of coping skills, isolation, and excessive dependence on the abuser.&lt;ref name="Newman p. 11"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Newman | first1 = Willis C. | last2 = Newman | first2 = Esmeralda | contribution = What is domestic violence?

===Cycles of violence===

====Cycle of abuse====
[[Lenore E. Walker]] presented the model of a [[cycle of abuse]] which consists of four phases. First, there is a buildup to abuse when tension rises until a domestic violence incident ensues. During the reconciliation stage, the abuser may be kind and loving and then there is a period of calm. When the situation is calm, the abused person may be hopeful that the situation will change.

====Intergenerational violence====
A common aspect among abusers is that they witnessed abuse in their childhood, in other words they were participants in a chain of [[Cycle of violence|intergenerational cycles of domestic violence]].&lt;ref name=Danieli&gt;{{citation | last1 = Simons | first1 = Ronald L. | last2 = Johnson | first2 = Christine | contribution = An examination of competing explanations for the intergenerational transmission of domestic violence | editor-last = Danieli | editor-first = Yael | title = International handbook of multigenerational legacies of trauma | pages = 553–570 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Plenum Press]] | location = New York London | year = 1998 | isbn = 9780306457388 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=thoNwuDmHEQC&amp;pg=PA553 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140704165827/http://books.google.com/books?id=thoNwuDmHEQC&amp;pg=PA553 | archivedate = 2014-07-04 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; That does not mean, conversely, that if a child witnesses or is subject to violence that they will become abusers.&lt;ref name="Newman p. 11" /&gt; Understanding and breaking the intergenerational abuse patterns may do more to reduce domestic violence than other remedies for managing the abuse.&lt;ref name=Danieli /&gt;

Responses that focus on children suggest that experiences throughout life influence an individual’s propensity to engage in family violence (either as a victim or as a perpetrator). Researchers supporting this theory suggest it is useful to think of three sources of domestic violence: childhood socialization, previous experiences in couple relationships during adolescence, and levels of strain in a person's current life. People who observe their parents abusing each other, or who were themselves abused may incorporate abuse into their behaviour within relationships that they establish as adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Kalmuss | first1 = Debra | last2 = Seltzer | first2 = Judith A. | title = The effect of family structure on family violence: the case of remarriage | location = Durham, New Hampshire | year = 1984 }} Paper presented at the Second National Conference for Family Violence Researchers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Kalmuss | first = Debra | title = The intergenerational transmission of marital aggression | journal = Journal of Marriage and Family | volume = 46 | issue = 1 | pages = 11–19 | doi = 10.2307/351858 | jstor = 351858 | date = February 1984 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kalmuss | first1 = Debra | last2 = Seltzer | first2 = Judith A. | title = Continuity of marital behavior in remarriage: the case of spouse abuse | journal = Journal of Marriage and Family | volume = 48 | issue = 1 | pages = 113–120 | doi = 10.2307/352234 | jstor = 352234 | date = February 1986 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research indicates that the more children are [[corporal punishment|physically punished]], the more likely they will be as adults to act violently towards family members, including intimate partners.&lt;ref name="Gershoff 2008"&gt;{{cite book |author=Gershoff, E.T. |date=2008 |title=Report on Physical Punishment in the United States: What Research Tells Us About Its Effects on Children |format=PDF |location=Columbus, OH |publisher=Center for Effective Discipline |page=16 |url=http://www.phoenixchildrens.org/sites/default/files/PDFs/principles_and_practices-of_effective_discipline.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160127213730/http://www.phoenixchildrens.org/sites/default/files/PDFs/principles_and_practices-of_effective_discipline.pdf |archivedate=2016-01-27 |df= |access-date=2015-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children who are [[spank]]ed more as children are more likely as adults to approve of hitting a partner, and also experience more marital conflict and feelings of anger in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Committee on Psychosocial Aspects of Child and Family Health|title=Guidance for effective discipline |journal=Pediatrics |volume=101 |issue=4 Pt 1 |pages=723–8 |date=April 1998 |pmid=9521967}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of studies have found physical punishment to be associated with "higher levels of aggression against parents, siblings, peers and spouses", even when controlling for other factors.&lt;ref name="Durrant &amp; Ensom"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Durrant |first=Joan |last2=Ensom |first2=Ron |date=4 September 2012 |title=Physical punishment of children: lessons from 20 years of research |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |volume=184 |issue=12 |pages=1373–1377 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.101314 |pmid=22311946 |pmc=3447048}}&lt;/ref&gt; While these associations do not prove a [[causation (sociology)|causal]] relationship, a number of [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal studies]] suggest that the experience of physical punishment does have a direct causal effect on later aggressive behaviors.

In some  [[patrilineal]] societies around the world, a young bride moves with the family of her husband. As a new girl in the home, she starts as having the lowest (or among the lowest) position in the family, and is often subjected to violence and abuse, and is, in particular, strongly controlled by the parents-in-law: with the arrival of the daughter-in-law in the family, the mother-in-law's status is elevated and she now has (often for the first time in her life) substantial power over someone else, and "This family system itself tends to produce a cycle of violence in which the formerly abused bride becomes the abusing mother-in-law to her new daughter-in-law".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Ruether | first = Rosemary Radford | contribution = The greening of world religions | editor-last = Ruether | editor-first = Rosemary Radford | title = Integrating ecofeminism, globalization, and world religions | page = 50 | publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers | location = Lanham, Maryland | year = 2005 | isbn = 9780742535305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty International writes that, in [[Tajikistan]], "it is almost an initiation ritual for the mother-in-law to put her daughter-in-law through the same torments she went through herself as a young wife."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Amnesty International | author-link = Amnesty International | title = Violence is not just a family affair: women face abuse in Tajikistan | publisher = [[Amnesty International]] | id = Paper no.

Personality traits include sudden bursts of [[anger]], poor [[impulse control]], and poor [[self-esteem]]. Various theories suggest that psychopathology is a factor, and that abuse experienced as a child leads some people to be more violent as adults. Correlation has been found between [[juvenile delinquency]] and domestic violence in adulthood.&lt;ref name=Kalra&gt;{{cite thesis|degree=M.A.|first=Michelle|last=Kalra|title=Juvenile delinquency and adult aggression against women|url=http://scholars.wlu.ca/etd/570/|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University|date=1996|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502151157/http://scholars.wlu.ca/etd/570/|archivedate=2012-05-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dutton has suggested a psychological profile of men who abuse their wives, arguing that they have [[borderline personality disorder|borderline personalities]] that are developed early in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Dutton, Donald G.  |author2=Golant, Susan | title = The batterer: a psychological profile | publisher = Basic Books | location = Princeton, New Jersey | year = 2004 | isbn = 9780465033881 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dutton | first1 = Donald G. | last2 = Starzomski | first2 = Andrew J. | title = Borderline personality in perpetrators of psychological and physical abuse | journal = Violence &amp; Victims | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = 326–337 | pmid = 8060906 | date = Winter 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these psychological theories are disputed: Gelles suggests that psychological theories are limited, and points out that other researchers have found that only 10% (or less) fit this psychological profile.

An [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychological]] explanation of domestic violence is that it represents male attempts to control female reproduction and ensure sexual exclusivity.&lt;ref name=Jealousy2&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Goetz | first = Aaron T. | title = The evolutionary psychology of violence | journal = Psicothema | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–21 | pmid = 20100422 | date = 2010 | url = http://www.psicothema.com/english/psicothema.asp?id=3690 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151222130253/http://www.psicothema.com/english/psicothema.asp?id=3690 | archivedate = 2015-12-22 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Violence related to extramarital relations is seen as justified in certain parts of the world. For instance, a survey in [[Diyarbakir]], [[Turkey]], found that, when asked the appropriate punishment for a woman who has committed [[adultery]], 37% of respondents said she should be killed, while 21% said her nose or ears should be cut off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Rainsford | first = Sarah | title = 'Honour' crime defiance in Turkey | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4357158.stm | work = [[BBC News]] | publisher = BBC | date = 19 October 2005 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150115054818/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4357158.stm | archivedate = 15 January 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar feelings may at times be generated in a situations where one partner is more financially successful.&lt;ref name=Jealousy2/&gt;

===Social theories===

====General====
Social theories look at external factors in the offender's environment, such as family structure, stress, social learning, and includes [[rational choice theory (criminology)|rational choice]] theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Haugan | first1 = Grethemor Skagseth | last2 = Nøttestad | first2 = Jim Aage | title = Norway: treatment program for men who batters | url = http://www.europrofem.org/contri/2_04_en/en-viol/81en_vio.htm | publisher = Violence in intimate relationships Norway: EuroPROFEM – The European Men Profeminist Network, [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]] | location = Trondheim, Norway | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110726042139/http://www.europrofem.org/contri/2_04_en/en-viol/81en_vio.htm | archivedate = 2011-07-26 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Social learning theory]] suggests that people learn from observing and modeling after others' behavior. With [[positive reinforcement]], the behavior continues. If one observes violent behavior, one is more likely to imitate it. If there are no negative consequences (e. g. victim accepts the violence, with submission), then the behavior will likely continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hotaling | first1 = Gerald T. | last2 = Sugarman | first2 = David B. | title = An analysis of risk markers in husband to wife violence: the current state of knowledge | journal = Violence &amp; Victims | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 101–124 | pmid = 3154143 | date = 1986 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Murphy | first1 = Christopher M. | last2 = Meyer | first2 = Shannon-Lee | last3 = O'Leary | first3 = K.

Resource theory was suggested by William Goode (1971).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Goode | first = William J. | title = Force and violence in the family | journal = Journal of Marriage and Family | volume = 33 | issue = 4 | pages = 624–636 | doi = 10.2307/349435 | jstor = 349435 | date = November 1971 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women who are most dependent on the spouse for economic well being (e.g. homemakers/housewives, women with handicaps, the unemployed), and are the primary caregiver to their children, fear the increased financial burden if they leave their marriage. Dependency means that they have fewer options and few resources to help them cope with or change their spouse's behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Kalmuss | first1 = Debra S. | last2 = Straus | first2 = Murray A. | author-link2 = Murray A.

Couples that share power equally experience lower incidence of conflict, and when conflict does arise, are less likely to resort to violence. If one spouse desires control and power in the relationship, the spouse may resort to abuse&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Kurz | first = Demie | contribution = Battering and the criminal justice system: a feminist view | editor-last1 = Buzawa | editor-first1 = Eva Schlesinger | editor-last2 = Buzawa | editor-first2 = Carl G. | title = Domestic violence: the changing criminal justice response | pages = 21–40 | publisher = Auburn House | location = Westport, Connecticut | year = 1992 | isbn = 9780865690011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may include coercion and threats, intimidation, emotional abuse, economic abuse, isolation, [[making light of]] the situation and blaming the spouse, using children (threatening to take them away), and behaving as "master of the castle".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Wallace | first = Harvey | contribution = Spousal abuse | editor-last = Wallace | editor-first = Harvey | title = Family violence: legal, medical, and social perspectives | pages = 184–185 | publisher = Pearson | location = Boston, Massachusetts | year = 2005 | isbn = 9780205418220}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Power and control wheel | url = http://www.theduluthmodel.org/documents/PhyVio.pdf | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100601232757/http://www.theduluthmodel.org/documents/PhyVio.pdf | archivedate = 1 June 2010 | publisher = Domestic Abuse Intervention Project | accessdate= 27 November 2007 | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social stress====

Stress may be increased when a person is living in a family situation, with increased pressures. Social stresses, due to inadequate finances or other such problems in a family may further increase tensions.&lt;ref name="gelles"/&gt; Violence is not always caused by stress, but may be one way that some people respond to stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kalmuss | first1 = Debra | last2 = Seltzer | first2 = Judith A. | title = Socialization and stress explanations for spouse abuse | journal = [[Social Forces]] | volume = 67 | issue = 2 | pages = 473–491 | doi = 10.2307/2579191 | jstor = 2579191 | date = December 1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Aneshensel | first = Carol S.  | title = Social stress: theory and research | journal = [[Annual Review of Sociology]] | volume = 18 | pages = 15–38 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.so.18.080192.000311 | date = August 1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Families and couples in poverty may be more likely to experience domestic violence, due to increased stress and conflicts about finances and other aspects.&lt;ref name="jewkes2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Jewkes | first = Rachel | title = Intimate partner violence: causes and prevention | journal = [[The Lancet]] | volume = 359 | issue = 9315 | pages = 1423–1429 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08357-5 | jstor = 11978358 | date = 20 April 2002 | pmid=11978358}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some speculate that poverty may hinder a man's ability to live up to his idea of "successful manhood", thus he fears losing honor and respect. Theory suggests that when he is unable to economically support his wife, and maintain control, he may turn to [[misogyny]], [[substance abuse]], and [[crime]] as ways to express masculinity.&lt;ref name="jewkes2002" /&gt;

Same-sex relationships may experience similar social stressors. Additionally, violence in same-sex relationships has been linked to internalized homophobia, which contributed to low self-esteem and anger in both perpetrator and victim.&lt;ref name="Murray 2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Murray | first1 = Christine E. | last2 = Mobley | first2 = A. Keith | last3 = Buford | first3 = Anne P. | last4 = Seaman-DeJohn | first4 = Megan M. | title = Same-sex Intimate partner violence: dynamics, social context, and counseling implications | journal = Journal of LGBT Issues in Counseling | volume = 1 | issue = 4 | pages = 7–30 | doi = 10.1300/J462v01n04_03 | date = January 2007 | url = https://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/AK_Mobley_Same_2007.pdf | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160205035411/https://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/AK_Mobley_Same_2007.pdf | archivedate = 2016-02-05 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Internalized homophobia also appears to be a barrier in victims seeking help. Similarly, [[heterosexism]] can play a key role in domestic violence in the LGBT community. As a social ideology that implies "heterosexuality is normative, morally superior, and better than [homosexuality],"&lt;ref name="Murray 2006"/&gt; heterosexism can hinder services and lead to an unhealthy self-image in sexual minorities. Heterosexism in legal and medical institutions can be seen in instances of discrimination, biases, and insensitivity toward sexual orientation. For example, as of 2006, seven states explicitly denied LGBT individuals the  ability to apply for protective orders,&lt;ref name="Murray 2006"/&gt; proliferating ideas of LGBT subjugation, which is tied to feelings of anger and powerlessness.

====Power and control====

[[File:(2) Cycle of abuse, power &amp; control issues in domestic abuse situations.gif|thumb|Cycle of abuse, power &amp; control issues in domestic abuse situations (double click to enlarge)]]
[[Power (social and political)|Power]] and control in abusive relationships is the way that abusers exert physical, sexual and other forms of abuse to gain control within relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff writer | title = Violence wheel | url = http://www.domesticviolence.org/violence-wheel/ | publisher = Domestic Abuse Violence Project (aka [[Duluth Model]]) | access-date = 18 April 2014 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140223092347/http://www.domesticviolence.org/violence-wheel | archivedate = 23 February 2014 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[causality|causalist]] view of domestic violence is that it is a strategy to gain or maintain power and control over the victim. This view is in alignment with Bancroft's "cost-benefit" theory that abuse rewards the perpetrator in ways other than, or in addition to, simply exercising power over his or her target(s). He cites evidence in support of his argument that, in most cases, abusers are quite capable of exercising control over themselves, but choose not to do so for various reasons.&lt;ref name=Bancroft&gt;{{cite book | last = Bancroft | first = Lundy | title = Why does he do that?: Inside the minds of angry and controlling men | publisher = [[Berkley Books]] | location = New York, New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780425191651 }} [https://books.google.com/books?id=xEZIpu3SVvcC Details.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151101115109/https://books.google.com/books?id=xEZIpu3SVvcC |date=2015-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, one person seeks complete power and control over their partner and uses different ways to achieve this, including resorting to physical violence.

Questions of power and control are integral to the widely utilized [[Duluth Domestic Abuse Intervention Project]]. They developed a "Power and Control Wheel" to illustrate this: it has power and control at the center, surrounded by spokes (techniques used), the titles of which include: coercion and [[threat]]s, [[intimidation]], [[emotional abuse]], [[solitude|isolation]], [[Minimisation (psychology)|minimizing]], [[denial|denying]] and blaming, using children, economic abuse, and privilege.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Power and control wheel | url = http://www.ncdsv.org/images/Power_and_Control_wheel_NCDSV.pdf | format = PDF | publisher = National Center on Domestic and Sexual Violence | access-date = 18 November 2011 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150314062136/http://www.ncdsv.org/images/Power_and_Control_wheel_NCDSV.pdf | archivedate = 14 March 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nonsubordination theory ===
Nonsubordination theory, sometimes called dominance theory, is an area of [[feminist legal theory]] that focuses on the power differential between men and women.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[[#Bartlett|Bartlett et al.]], p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonsubordination theory takes the position that society, and more especially men in society, use sex differences between men and women to perpetuate this power imbalance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Unlike other topics within [[feminist legal theory]], nonsubordination theory focuses specifically on certain sexual behaviors, including control of women’s [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], [[sexual harassment]], pornography, and violence against women generally.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bartlett|Bartlett et al.]], p. 328&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Catharine MacKinnon]] argues that nonsubordination theory best addresses these particular issues because they affect “almost exclusively” women.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;[[#Bartlett|Bartlett et al.]], p. 332 citing MacKinnon, Catharine A. (1987) ''Feminism Unmodified: Discourses on Life and Law''. Harvard University Press. pp. 40–41. {{ISBN|0674298748}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  MacKinnon advocates for nonsubordination theory over other theories, like formal equality, substantive equality, and difference theory, because [[sexual violence]] and other forms of [[violence against women]] are not a question of “sameness and difference,” but rather are best viewed as “more central inequalities” for women.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Though nonsubordination theory has been discussed at great length in evaluating various forms of [[sexual violence]] against women, it also serves as a basis for understanding domestic violence and why it occurs.  Nonsubordination theory tackles the issue of domestic violence as a subset of the broader problem of [[violence against women]] because domestic violence victims are overwhelmingly female.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bartlett|Bartlett et al.]], p. 387 citing Rennison, Callie Marie and Welchans, Sarah (May 2000) [https://web.archive.org/web/20090901024747/http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov//bjs//pub/pdf/ipv.pdf ''Special Report: Intimate Partner Violence''], Bureau of Justice Statistics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of nonsubordination theory propose several reasons why it works best to explain domestic violence.  First, there are certain recurring patterns in domestic violence that indicate it is not the result of intense anger or arguments, but rather is a form of subordination.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;[[#Bartlett|Bartlett et al.]], pp. 389–92 citing Fischer, Karla et al. (1993) [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/37810125_The_Culture_of_Battering_and_the_Role_of_Mediation_in_Domestic_Violence_Cases ''The Culture of Battering and the Role of Mediation in Domestic Violence Cases''], 46 SMU L. Rev. pp. 2117, 2121–2130, 2133, 2136–2138, 2141.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is evidenced in part by the fact that domestic violence victims are typically abused in a variety of situations and by a variety of means.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  For example, victims are sometimes beaten after they have been sleeping or have been separated from the batterer, and often the abuse takes on a financial or emotional form in addition to physical abuse.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Supporters of nonsubordination theory use these examples to dispel the notion that battering is always the result of heat of the moment anger or intense arguments.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Also, batterers often employ manipulative and deliberate tactics when abusing their victims, which can “rang[e] from searching for and destroying a treasured object of hers to striking her in areas of her body that do not show bruises (e.g. her scalp) or in areas where she would be embarrassed to show others her bruises.”&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  These behaviors can be even more useful to a batterer when the batterer and the victim share children, because the batterer often controls the family’s financial assets, making the victim less likely to leave if it would put her children at risk.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bartlett|Bartlett et al.]], p. 413.&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Martha Mahoney, of the [[University of Miami School of Law]], also points to the notion of “separation assault”—a phenomenon where a batterer further assaults a victim who is attempting or has attempted to leave an abusive relationship—as additional evidence that domestic violence is used to subordinate victims to their batterers.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;[[#Bartlett|Bartlett et al.]], pp. 392–93 citing {{cite journal|doi=10.2307/1289533 |jstor=1289533 |title=Legal Images of Battered Women: Redefining the Issue of Separation |journal=Michigan Law Review |volume=90 |pages=1 |year=1991 |last1=Mahoney |first1=Martha R. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A batterer’s unwillingness to allow the victim to leave the relationship substantiates the idea that violence is being used to force the victim to continue to fulfill the batterer’s wishes that she obey him.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Nonsubordination theorists argue that all of these actions—the variety of abusive behaviors and settings, exploiting the victim’s children, and assault upon separation—suggest a larger problem than merely an inability to properly manage anger, though anger may be a byproduct of these behaviors.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  The purpose of these actions is to keep the victim, and sometimes the entire family, subordinate to the batterer, according to nonsubordination theory.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

A second rationale for using nonsubordination theory to explain domestic violence, beyond the variety of tactics used by abusers, is that the frequency with which domestic violence occurs overpowers the idea that it is merely the result of a batterer’s anger.  Professor Mahoney explains that because of the [[sensationalism]] generated in media coverage of “big” or particularly horrific domestic violence cases, it is difficult for people to conceptualize how frequently domestic violence happens in society.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  However, domestic violence is a regular occurrence experienced by up to one half of people in the United States, and an overwhelming number of victims are female.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  The sheer number of domestic violence victims in the United States suggests that domestic violence is not merely the result of intimate partners who cannot control their anger.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Nonsubordination theory contends that it is the batterer’s desire to subordinate the victim, not his uncontainable anger, which explains the frequency of domestic violence.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Nonsubordination theorists argue that other forms of [[feminist legal theory]] do not offer any explanation for the phenomenon of domestic violence generally or the frequency with which it occurs.

Critics of nonsubordination theory complain that it offers no solutions to the problems it points out.  For example, proponents of nonsubordination theory criticize certain approaches that have been taken to address domestic violence in the legal system, such as mandatory arrest or prosecution policies.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;[[#Bartlett|Bartlett et al.]], p. 405&lt;/ref&gt;  These policies take discretion away from [[law enforcement]] by forcing police officers to arrest suspected domestic violence offenders and prosecutors to prosecute those cases.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; There is a lot of discourse surrounding mandatory arrest. Opponents argue that it undermines a victim's autonomy, discourages the empowerment of women by discounting other resources available and puts victims at more risk for domestic abuse. States that have implemented mandatory arrest laws have 60% higher homicide rates which have been shown to be consistent with the decline in reporting rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pavlidakis|first=Alexandra|date=January 1, 2009|title=Mandatory Arrest: Past Its Prime|url=http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1076&amp;context=lawreview|journal=Santa Clara Law Review|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604135236/http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1076&amp;context=lawreview|archivedate=June 4, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of these policies contend that the criminal justice system is sometimes the only way to reach victims of domestic violence, and that if an offender knows he will be arrested, it will [[Deterrence (legal)|deter]] future domestic violence conduct.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  People who endorse nonsubordination theory argue that these policies only serve to further subordinate women by forcing them to take a certain course of action, thus compounding the trauma they experienced during the abuse.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  However, nonsubordination theory itself offers no better or more appropriate solutions, which is why some scholars argue that other forms of [[feminist legal theory]] are more appropriate to address issues of domestic and [[sexual violence]]. Sociologist Andrew Glover critiques non-subordination theory on the grounds that domestic violence occurs among homosexual couples at the same rate as heterosexual couples. So it cannot be caused by, or exist to perpetuate, power differentials between the sexes. &lt;ref&gt; Glover, Andrew. "Beware of Root Causes."

===Psychological===
Among victims who are still living with their perpetrators high amounts of stress, fear, and anxiety are commonly reported. [[Depression (mood)|Depression]] is also common, as victims are made to feel [[guilt (emotion)|guilty]] for ‘provoking’ the abuse and are frequently subjected to intense [[criticism]]. It is reported that 60% of victims meet the [[Rating scales for depression|diagnostic criteria for depression]], either during or after termination of the relationship, and have a greatly increased risk of suicide. Those who are battered either emotionally or physically often are also depressed because of a feeling of worthlessness. These feelings often persist long-term and it is suggested that many receive therapy for it because of the heightened risk of suicide and other traumatic symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Barnett | first = Ola W. | title = Why battered women do not leave, part 2: external inhibiting factors — social support and internal inhibiting factors | journal = [[Trauma, Violence, &amp; Abuse]] | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–35 | doi = 10.1177/1524838001002001001 | date = 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to depression, victims of domestic violence also commonly experience long-term [[anxiety]] and [[panic]], and are likely to meet the diagnostic criteria for [[Generalized Anxiety Disorder]] and [[Panic Disorder]]. The most commonly referenced psychological effect of domestic violence is [[Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder]] (PTSD). PTSD (as experienced by victims) is characterized by [[Flashback (psychology)|flashbacks]], intrusive images, exaggerated [[startle response]], [[nightmares]], and avoidance of triggers that are associated with the abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vitanza | first1 = Stephanie | last2 = Vogel | first2 = Laura C.M. | last3 = Marshall | first3 = Linda L. | title = Distress and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder in abused women | journal = Violence &amp; Victims | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 23–34 | pmid = 8555116 | date = Spring 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have indicated that it is important to consider the effect of domestic violence and its psychophysiologic sequelae on women who are mothers of infants and young children. Several studies have shown that maternal interpersonal violence-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can, despite traumatized mother's best efforts, interfere with their child's response to the domestic violence and other traumatic events.&lt;ref name=care/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schechter | first1 = Daniel S. | last2 = Coates | first2 = Susan W. | last3 = Kaminer | first3 = Tammy | last4 = Coots | first4 = Tammy | last5 = Zeanah, Jr. | first5 = Charles H. | last6 = Davies | first6 = Mark | last7 = Schonfeld | first7 = Irvin S. | last8 = Marshall | first8 = Randall D. | last9 = Liebowitz | first9 = Michael R. | last10 = Trabka | first10 = Kimberly A. | last11 = McCaw | first11 = Jaime E. | last12 = Myers | first12 = Michael M. | title = Distorted maternal mental representations and atypical behavior in a clinical sample of violence-exposed mothers and their toddlers | journal = Journal of Trauma &amp; Dissociation | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 123–147 | doi = 10.1080/15299730802045666 | pmid = 18985165 | pmc = 2577290 | date = June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial===
Once victims leave their perpetrator, they can be stunned with the reality of the extent to which the abuse has taken away their autonomy. Due to economic abuse and isolation, the victim usually has very little money of their own and few people on whom they can rely when seeking help. This has been shown to be one of the greatest obstacles facing victims of DV, and the strongest factor that can discourage them from leaving their perpetrators.&lt;ref name="Stop Violence Against Women"&gt;{{cite web | title = Domestic violence and housing | url = https://www.stopvaw.org/Domestic_Violence_and_Housing.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151002061435/http://www.stopvaw.org/Domestic_Violence_and_Housing.html | archive-date = 2 October 2015 | website = stopvaw.org | publisher = Stop Violence Against Women: a project of the Advocates for Human Rights | date = August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to lacking financial resources, victims of DV often lack specialized skills, education, and training that are necessary to find gainful employment, and also may have several children to support. In 2003, thirty-six major US cities cited DV as one of the primary causes of homelessness in their areas.&lt;ref name="aclu.org"&gt;{{cite web | title = Domestic violence and homelessness | url = https://www.aclu.org/FilesPDFs/housing%20paper.4.pdf | website = aclu.org | publisher = American Civil Liberties Union Women's Rights Project | date = 2007 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130812013406/http://www.aclu.org/FilesPDFs/housing%20paper.4.pdf | archivedate = 2013-08-12 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been reported that one out of every three homeless women are homeless due to having left a DV relationship. If a victim is able to secure rental housing, it is likely that her apartment complex will have "zero tolerance" policies for crime; these policies can cause them to face eviction even if they are the victim (not the perpetrator) of violence.&lt;ref name="aclu.org"/&gt; While the number of shelters and community resources available to DV victims has grown tremendously, these agencies often have few employees and hundreds of victims seeking assistance which causes many victims to remain without the assistance they need.&lt;ref name="Stop Violence Against Women"/&gt;

Women and children experiencing domestic violence undergo [[occupational apartheid]]; they are typically denied access to desired occupations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Cage | first = Anthea | title = Occupational therapy with women and children survivors of domestic violence: are we fulfilling our activist heritage?

An analysis in the US showed that 106 of the 771 officer killings between 1996 and 2009 occurred during domestic violence interventions.&lt;ref name=officers&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meyer |first1=Shannon |last2=Carroll |first2=Randall H. |title=When officers die: understanding deadly domestic violence calls for service |journal=The Police Chief |volume=78 |issue=5 |pages=24–27 |date=May 2011 |url=http://www.policechiefmagazine.org/magazine/index.cfm?fuseaction=display_arch&amp;article_id=2378&amp;issue_id=52011|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906013511/http://www.policechiefmagazine.org/magazine/index.cfm?fuseaction=display_arch&amp;article_id=2378&amp;issue_id=52011 |archivedate=September 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, 51% were defined as unprovoked or as ambushes, taking place before officers had made contact with suspects. Another 40% occurred after contact and the remainder took place during tactical situations (those involving hostages and attempts to overcome barricades).&lt;ref name=officers/&gt; The [[FBI]]'s [[National Incident Based Reporting System#LEOKA segment|LEOKA]] system grouped officer domestic violence response deaths into the category of disturbances, along with "bar fights, gang matters, and persons brandishing weapons," which may have given rise to a misperception of the risks involved.&lt;ref name=officers/&gt;&lt;ref name="BuzawaBuzawa2003"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Buzawa | first1 = Eva Schlesinger | last2 = Buzawa | first2 = Carl G. | title = Domestic violence: the criminal justice response | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | location = Thousand Oaks, California | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780761924487 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9jCJXOxKXoUC&amp;pg=PA80 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160623192417/https://books.google.com/books?id=9jCJXOxKXoUC&amp;pg=PA80 | archivedate = 2016-06-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the gravity and intensity of hearing victims’ stories of abuse, professionals (social workers, police, counselors, therapists, advocates, medical professionals) are at risk themselves for secondary or vicarious trauma (VT), which causes the responder to experience trauma symptoms similar to the original victim after hearing about the victim’s experiences with abuse.&lt;ref name="Iliffe"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Iliffe | first1 = Gillian | last2 = Steed | first2 = Lyndall G. | title = Exploring the counselor's experience of working with perpetrators and survivors of domestic violence | journal = Journal of Interpersonal Violence | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 393–412 | doi = 10.1177/088626000015004004 | date = April 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has demonstrated that professionals who experience vicarious trauma show signs of exaggerated startle response, [[hypervigilance]], nightmares, and [[intrusive thoughts]] although they have not experienced a trauma personally and do not qualify for a clinical diagnosis of PTSD.&lt;ref name="Iliffe" /&gt;

There exist several strategies that are being used to attempt to prevent or reduce DV. It is important to assess the effectiveness of a strategy that is being implemented.&lt;ref name="who.int1"&gt;{{cite book | last = WHO | author-link = World Health Organization | title = Preventing intimate partner and sexual violence against women: taking action and generating evidence | publisher = World Health Organization | location = Geneva, Switzerland | url = http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/44350/1/9789241564007_eng.pdf | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160205034703/http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/44350/1/9789241564007_eng.pdf | archivedate = 2016-02-05 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reforming the legislation in order to ensure that domestic violence falls under the scope of the law is important. This may imply repealing existing laws which discriminate against women: according to the WHO, "when the law allows husbands to physically discipline wives, implementing a programme to prevent intimate partner violence may have little impact".&lt;ref name="who.int1"/&gt; [[Marriage law]]s are also important, "They [women] should also be able to enter freely into a marriage or to leave it, to obtain financial credit, and to own and administer property."&lt;ref name="who.int1"/&gt; Abolishing or restricting the offering and receiving of [[dowry]] and [[bride price]] and scrutinizing the impact of these transactions on the legislative decisions regarding DV is also important. UN Women has stated that the legislation should ensure that "a perpetrator of domestic violence, including marital rape, cannot use the fact that he paid bride price as a defence to a domestic violence charge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = UN Women | author-link = UN Women | title = Supplement to the handbook for legislation on violence against women: "harmful practices" against women | publisher = UN Women | location = New York | year = 2012 | url = http://www.unwomen.org/~/media/headquarters/attachments/sections/library/publications/2012/12/unw-legislation-supplement-en%20pdf.pdf| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150610131259/http://www.unwomen.org/~/media/headquarters/attachments/sections/library/publications/2012/12/unw-legislation-supplement-en%20pdf.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2015-06-10  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender norms that promote the inferiority of women may lead to the abuse of women by intimate partners. The WHO writes that, "Dismantling hierarchical constructions of masculinity and femininity predicated on the control of women, and eliminating the structural factors that support inequalities are likely to make a significant contribution to preventing intimate partner and sexual violence".&lt;ref name="who.int1"/&gt;

According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], "A key strategy in preventing domestic violence is the promotion of respectful, nonviolent relationships through individual, community, and societal level change."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff writer | title = Prevent domestic violence in your community | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151003152901/http://www.cdc.gov/features/intimatepartnerviolence/ | archive-date = 3 October 2015 | url = https://www.cdc.gov/features/intimatepartnerviolence/ | website = cdc.gov | publisher = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | date = 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Early intervention programs, such as school-based programs to prevent [[dating violence]] are also effective.&lt;ref name="who.int1"/&gt; Children who grow up in violent homes may be led to believe that such behavior is a normal part of life, therefore it is important to challenge such attitudes when they are present among these children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dept. for Health | author-link = Department of Health (United Kingdom) | title = Responding to domestic abuse: a handbook for health professionals | publisher = [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] | location = London, UK | year = 2005 | url = http://dh.gov.uk/en/publicationsandstatistics/publications/publicationspolicyandguidance/dh_4126161 | archive-url = http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20060123125814/dh.gov.uk/en/publicationsandstatistics/publications/publicationspolicyandguidance/dh_4126161 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2006-01-23 | oclc = 278343897 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Electromagnetic''' or '''magnetic induction''' is the production of an [[electromotive force]] (i.e., voltage) across an [[electrical conductor]] in a changing [[magnetic field]].

[[Michael Faraday]] is generally credited with the discovery of induction in 1831, and [[James Clerk Maxwell]] mathematically described it as [[Faraday's law of induction]]. [[Lenz's law]] describes the direction of the induced field. Faraday's law was later generalized to become the Maxwell–Faraday equation, one of the four [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell equations]] in his theory of [[electromagnetism]].

Electromagnetic induction has found many applications, including electrical components such as [[inductor]]s and [[transformer]]s, and devices such as [[electric motor]]s and [[electric generator|generator]]s.

[[File:Faraday disk generator.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Faraday's disk (see [[homopolar generator]])]]

Electromagnetic induction was discovered by [[Michael Faraday]], published in 1831.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ulaby|first=Fawwaz|title=Fundamentals of applied electromagnetics|edition=5th|year=2007|url=https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0132413264/ref=ord_cart_shr?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;v=glance|publisher=Pearson:Prentice Hall|isbn=0-13-241326-4|page=255}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nas.edu/history/members/henry.html|title=Joseph Henry|accessdate=2006-11-30|work=Distinguished Members Gallery, National Academy of Sciences|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213121232/http://www.nas.edu/history/members/henry.html|archivedate=2013-12-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was discovered independently by [[Joseph Henry]] in 1832.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Electromagnetism|url=http://web.hep.uiuc.edu/home/serrede/P435/Lecture_Notes/A_Brief_History_of_Electromagnetism.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Smithsonian Institution Archives|title=Electromagnetism|url=http://siarchives.si.edu/history/exhibits/henry/electromagnetism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Faraday's first experimental demonstration (August 29, 1831), he wrapped two wires around opposite sides of an iron ring or "[[torus]]" (an arrangement similar to a modern [[toroidal transformer]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Based on his understanding of electromagnets, he expected that, when current started to flow in one wire, a sort of wave would travel through the ring and cause some electrical effect on the opposite side. He plugged one wire into a [[galvanometer]], and watched it as he connected the other wire to a battery. He saw a transient current, which he called a "wave of electricity", when he connected the wire to the battery and another when he disconnected it.&lt;ref&gt;''Michael Faraday'', by L. Pearce Williams, p. 182-3&lt;/ref&gt; This induction was due to the change in [[magnetic flux]] that occurred when the battery was connected and disconnected.&lt;ref name=Giancoli/&gt; Within two months, Faraday found several other manifestations of electromagnetic induction. For example, he saw transient currents when he quickly slid a bar magnet in and out of a coil of wires, and he generated a steady ([[direct current|DC]]) current by rotating a copper disk near the bar magnet with a sliding electrical lead ("Faraday's disk").&lt;ref&gt;''Michael Faraday'', by L. Pearce Williams, p. 191–5&lt;/ref&gt;

Faraday explained electromagnetic induction using a concept he called [[lines of force]]. However, scientists at the time widely rejected his theoretical ideas, mainly because they were not formulated mathematically.&lt;ref name=Williams510&gt;''Michael Faraday'', by L. Pearce Williams, p. 510&lt;/ref&gt; An exception was [[James Clerk Maxwell]], who used Faraday's ideas as the basis of his quantitative electromagnetic theory.&lt;ref name=Williams510/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, James Clerk (1904), ''A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism'', Vol. II, Third Edition. Oxford University Press, pp. 178–9 and 189.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IEEUK"&gt;[http://www.theiet.org/about/libarc/archives/biographies/faraday.cfm "Archives Biographies: Michael Faraday", The Institution of Engineering and Technology.]&lt;/ref&gt; In Maxwell's model, the time varying aspect of electromagnetic induction is expressed as a differential equation, which [[Oliver Heaviside]] referred to as Faraday's law even though it is slightly different from Faraday's original formulation and does not describe [[#Faraday's law as two different phenomena|motional EMF]]. Heaviside's version (see [[#Maxwell–Faraday equation|Maxwell–Faraday equation below]]) is the form recognized today in the group of equations known as [[Maxwell's equations]].

In 1834 [[Heinrich Lenz]] formulated the law named after him to describe the "flux through the circuit". [[Lenz's law]] gives the direction of the induced EMF and current resulting from electromagnetic induction.

Faraday's law of induction makes use of the [[magnetic flux]] Φ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; through a region of space enclosed by a wire loop. The magnetic flux is defined by a [[surface integral]]:&lt;ref&gt;

where ''d'''''A''' is an element of the surface Σ enclosed by the wire loop, '''B''' is the magnetic field. The [[dot product]] '''B'''·''d'''''A''' corresponds to an infinitesimal amount of magnetic flux. In more visual terms, the magnetic flux through the wire loop is proportional to the number of [[field line|magnetic flux lines]] that pass through the loop.

When the flux through the surface changes, [[Faraday's law of induction]] says that the wire loop acquires an [[electromotive force]] (EMF).{{refn|group=note|The EMF is the voltage that would be measured by cutting the wire to create an [[Electric circuit|open circuit]], and attaching a [[voltmeter]] to the leads. Mathematically, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the energy available from a unit charge that has traveled once around the wire loop.&lt;ref name=Feynman&gt;

To increase the generated EMF, a common approach is to exploit [[flux linkage]] by creating a tightly wound [[inductor|coil of wire]], composed of ''N'' identical turns, each with the same magnetic flux going through them. The resulting EMF is then ''N'' times that of one single wire.&lt;ref&gt;

Generating an EMF through a variation of the magnetic flux through the surface of a wire loop can be achieved in several ways:
# the magnetic field '''B''' changes (e.g. an alternating magnetic field, or moving a wire loop towards a bar magnet where the B field is stronger),
# the wire loop is deformed and the surface Σ changes,
# the orientation of the surface ''d'''''A''' changes (e.g. spinning a wire loop into a fixed magnetic field),
# any combination of the above

===Maxwell–Faraday equation===
{{See also|Faraday's law of induction#Maxwell–Faraday equation}}
In general, the relation between the EMF &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; in a wire loop encircling a surface &amp;Sigma;, and the electric field '''E''' in the wire is given by
:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{E} = \oint_{\partial \Sigma} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} &lt;/math&gt;
where ''d'''''ℓ''' is an element of contour of the surface &amp;Sigma;, combining this with the definition of flux
:&lt;math&gt; \Phi_\mathrm{B} = \int\limits_{\Sigma} \mathbf{B} \cdot d \mathbf{A}\ , &lt;/math&gt;

we can write the integral form of the Maxwell–Faraday equation
:&lt;math&gt; \oint_{\partial \Sigma} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} = -\frac{d}{d t} { \int_{\Sigma} \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{A}} &lt;/math&gt;

It is one of the four [[Maxwell's equations]], and therefore plays a fundamental role in the theory of [[classical electromagnetism]].

===Faraday's law and relativity===
Faraday's law describes two different phenomena: the ''motional EMF'' generated by a magnetic force on a moving wire (see [[Lorentz force#Force on a current-carrying wire|Lorentz force]]), and the ''transformer EMF'' this is generated by an electric force due to a changing magnetic field (due to the differential form of the [[#Maxwell–Faraday equation|Maxwell–Faraday equation]]). [[James Clerk Maxwell]] drew attention to the separate physical phenomena in 1861.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Einstein]] noticed that the two situations both corresponded to a relative movement between a conductor and a magnet, and the outcome was unaffected by which one was moving. This was one of the principal paths that led him to develop [[special relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;

===Electrical generator===
[[Image:Spindle.PNG|thumb|293x293px|Rectangular wire loop rotating at angular velocity ω in radially outward pointing magnetic field '''B''' of fixed magnitude. The circuit is completed by brushes making sliding contact with top and bottom discs, which have conducting rims. This is a simplified version of the ''drum generator''.]]
{{Main article|Electric generator}}
The EMF generated by Faraday's law of induction due to relative movement of a circuit and a magnetic field is the phenomenon underlying [[electrical generator]]s. When a [[magnet|permanent magnet]] is moved relative to a conductor, or vice versa, an electromotive force is created. If the wire is connected through an [[electrical load]], current will flow, and thus [[electrical energy]] is generated, converting the mechanical energy of motion to electrical energy. For example, the ''drum generator'' is based upon the figure to the bottom-right. A different implementation of this idea is the [[Homopolar generator|Faraday's disc]], shown in simplified form on the right.

In the Faraday's disc example, the disc is rotated in a uniform magnetic field perpendicular to the disc, causing a current to flow in the radial arm due to the Lorentz force. Mechanical work is necessary to drive this current. When the generated current flows through the conducting rim, a magnetic field is generated by this current through [[Ampère's circuital law]] (labelled "induced B" in the figure). The rim thus becomes an [[electromagnet]] that resists rotation of the disc (an example of [[Lenz's law]]). On the far side of the figure, the return current flows from the rotating arm through the far side of the rim to the bottom brush. The B-field induced by this return current opposes the applied B-field, tending to ''decrease'' the flux through that side of the circuit, opposing the ''increase'' in flux due to rotation. On the near side of the figure, the return current flows from the rotating arm through the near side of the rim to the bottom brush. The induced B-field ''increases'' the flux on this side of the circuit, opposing the ''decrease'' in flux due to rotation. Thus, both sides of the circuit generate an EMF opposing the rotation. The energy required to keep the disc moving, despite this reactive force, is exactly equal to the electrical energy generated (plus energy wasted due to [[friction]], [[Joule heating]], and other inefficiencies). This behavior is common to all generators converting [[mechanical energy]] to electrical energy.

===Electrical transformer===
{{Main article|Transformer}}
When the electric current in a loop of wire changes, the changing current creates a changing magnetic field. A second wire in reach of this magnetic field will experience this change in magnetic field as a change in its coupled magnetic flux, ''d'' Φ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; / ''d t''. Therefore, an electromotive force is set up in the second loop called the induced EMF or transformer EMF. If the two ends of this loop are connected through an electrical load, current will flow.

====Current clamp====
[[File:Current Clamp.jpg|thumb|150px|A current clamp]]
{{Main article|Current clamp}}

A current clamp is a type of transformer with a split core which can be spread apart and clipped onto a wire or coil to either measure the current in it or, in reverse, to induce a voltage. Unlike conventional instruments the clamp does not make electrical contact with the conductor or require it to be disconnected during attachment of the clamp.

===Magnetic flow meter===

Faraday's law is used for measuring the flow of electrically conductive liquids and slurries. Such instruments are called magnetic flow meters. The induced voltage ℇ generated in the magnetic field ''B'' due to a conductive liquid moving at velocity ''v'' is thus given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}= - B \ell v,&lt;/math&gt;

where ℓ is the distance between electrodes in the magnetic flow meter.

==Eddy currents==
{{main article|Eddy current}}
Conductors (of finite dimensions) moving through a uniform magnetic field, or stationary within a changing magnetic field, will have currents induced within them. These induced eddy currents can be undesirable, since they dissipate energy in the resistance of the conductor.
There are a number of methods employed to control these undesirable inductive effects.
* Electromagnets in electric motors, generators, and transformers do not use solid metal, but instead use thin sheets of metal plate, called ''laminations''. These thin plates reduce the parasitic eddy currents, as described below.
* Inductive coils in electronics typically use [[magnetic core]]s to minimize parasitic current flow. They are a mixture of metal powder plus a resin binder that can hold any shape. The binder prevents parasitic current flow through the powdered metal.

===Electromagnet laminations===
[[File:Hawkins Electrical Guide - Figure 292 - Eddy currents in a solid armature.jpg|300px|left]]
Eddy currents occur when a solid metallic mass is rotated in a magnetic field, because the outer portion of the metal cuts more lines of force than the inner portion, hence the induced electromotive force not being uniform, tends to set up currents between the points of greatest and least potential. Eddy currents consume a considerable amount of energy and often cause a harmful rise in temperature.&lt;ref name="Imagesand"&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Images and reference text are from the public domain book: [[Hawkins Electrical Guide]], Volume 1, Chapter 19: Theory of the Armature, pp. 270–273, Copyright 1917 by Theo. Audel &amp; Co., Printed in the United States&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}
[[File:Hawkins Electrical Guide - Figure 293 - Armature core with a few laminations showing effect on eddy currents.jpg|300px|left]]
Only five laminations or plates are shown in this example, so as to show the subdivision of the eddy currents. In practical use, the number of laminations or punchings ranges from 40 to 66 per inch, and brings the eddy current loss down to about one percent. While the plates can be separated by insulation, the voltage is so low that the natural rust/oxide coating of the plates is enough to prevent current flow across the laminations.&lt;ref name="Imagesand" /&gt;

===Parasitic induction within conductors===
[[File:Hawkins Electrical Guide - Figure 291 - Formation of eddy currents in a solid bar inductor.jpg|300px|left]]
In this illustration, a solid copper bar conductor on a rotating armature is just passing under the tip of the pole piece N of the field magnet. Note the uneven distribution of the lines of force across the copper bar. The magnetic field is more concentrated and thus stronger on the left edge of the copper bar (a,b) while the field is weaker on the right edge (c,d). Since the two edges of the bar move with the same velocity, this difference in field strength across the bar creates whorls or current eddies within the copper bar.&lt;ref name="Imagesand"/&gt;

High current power-frequency devices, such as electric motors, generators and transformers, use multiple small conductors in parallel to break up the eddy flows that can form within large solid conductors. The same principle is applied to transformers used at higher than power frequency, for example, those used in [[switch mode power supply|switch-mode power supplies]] and the [[intermediate frequency]] coupling transformers of radio receivers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1065">'''Endowment''' (in philosophy) refers to the innate capacities of an individual, group, or institution. An individual's "natural endowment" can be abilities, such as intelligence or strength, given at birth. An individual's "social endowment" can be abilities attributed to the individual's position within a social hierarchy. 

According to [[Stephen R. Covey]], author of [[The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People]], there are seven human endowments.  They are listed below.

==Primary endowments==

1) Self-awareness or self-knowledge
 
2) Imagination and conscience 
 
3) Volition or will power

==Secondary endowments==

4) An [[abundance mentality]]

5) Courage and consideration

6) Creativity

7) Self-renewal

'''Exclusive or''' or '''exclusive disjunction''' is a [[Logical connective|logical operation]] that outputs true only when inputs differ (one is true, the other is false).&lt;ref name=wolfram&gt;{{cite web|last1=Germundsson|first1=Roger|last2=Weisstein|first2=Eric|title=XOR|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/XOR.html|website=[[MathWorld]]|publisher=[[Wolfram Research]]|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is [[Table of logic symbols|symbolized]] by the prefix operator '''J'''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy|volume=10|editor-first=Edward|editor-last=Craig|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1998|isbn=9780415073103|page=496|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HP9O6OM4iOgC&amp;pg=PA496}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the [[infix]] operators '''XOR''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɛ|k|s|_|ˈ|ɔr}}), '''EOR''', '''EXOR''', '''&lt;span style="font-size:120%;"&gt;⊻&lt;/span&gt;''', '''&lt;span style="font-size:120%;"&gt;⩒&lt;/span&gt;''', '''&lt;span style="font-size:120%;"&gt;⩛&lt;/span&gt;''', '''&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;⊕&lt;/span&gt;''', &lt;span style="font-size:150%;"&gt;↮&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span style="font-size:150%;"&gt;'''&amp;#8802;'''&lt;/span&gt;. The [[negation]] of XOR is [[logical biconditional]], which outputs true only when both inputs are the same.

It gains the name "exclusive or" because the meaning of "or" is ambiguous when both [[operand]]s are true; the exclusive or operator ''excludes'' that case. This is sometimes thought of as "one or the other but not both". This could be written as "A or B, but not, A and B".

More generally, XOR is true only when an odd number of inputs are true. A chain of XORs—''a'' XOR ''b'' XOR ''c'' XOR ''d'' (and so on)—is true whenever an odd number of the inputs are true and is false whenever an even number of inputs are true.

==Truth table==
[[File:Multigrade operator XOR.svg|thumb|220px|Arguments on the left combined by XOR. This is a binary [[Walsh matrix]] (cf. [[Hadamard code]]).]]
The [[truth table]] of A XOR B shows that it outputs true whenever the inputs differ:

|-
| 0 || 1 || 1
|-
| 1 || 0 || 1
|-
| 1 || 1 || 0
|}

* 0, false
* 1, true

==Equivalences, elimination, and introduction==
Exclusive disjunction essentially means 'either one, but not both nor none'. In other words, the statement is true [[if and only if]] one is true and the other is false. For example, if two horses are racing, then one of the two will win the race, but not both of them. The exclusive disjunction &lt;math&gt;p \oplus q&lt;/math&gt;, also denoted by &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:120%;"&gt;'''⩛'''&lt;/span&gt; &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{J}pq&lt;/math&gt;, can be expressed in terms of the [[logical conjunction]] ("logical and", &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt;), the [[disjunction]] ("logical or", &lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt;), and the [[negation]] (&lt;math&gt;\lnot&lt;/math&gt;) as follows:
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
  p \oplus q &amp; = &amp; (p \lor q) \land  \lnot (p \land q)
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The exclusive disjunction &lt;math&gt;p \oplus q&lt;/math&gt; can also be expressed in the following way:
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
  p \oplus q &amp; = &amp; (p \land \lnot q) \lor (\lnot p \land q)
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

This representation of XOR may be found useful when constructing a circuit or network, because it has only one &lt;math&gt;\lnot&lt;/math&gt; operation and small number of &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt; operations. A proof of this identity is given below:
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
  p \oplus q &amp; = &amp; (p \land \lnot q) &amp; \lor &amp; (\lnot p \land q) \\[3pt]
             &amp; = &amp; ((p \land \lnot q) \lor \lnot p) &amp; \land &amp; ((p \land \lnot q) \lor q) \\[3pt]
             &amp; = &amp; ((p \lor \lnot p) \land (\lnot q \lor \lnot p)) &amp; \land &amp; ((p \lor q) \land (\lnot q \lor q)) \\[3pt]
             &amp; = &amp; (\lnot p \lor \lnot q) &amp; \land &amp; (p \lor q) \\[3pt]
             &amp; = &amp; \lnot (p \land q) &amp; \land &amp; (p \lor q)
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

It is sometimes useful to write &lt;math&gt;p \oplus q&lt;/math&gt; in the following way:
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
  p \oplus q &amp; = &amp; \lnot ((p \land q) \lor (\lnot p \land \lnot q))
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
or:
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
  p \oplus q &amp; = &amp; (p \lor q) \land (\lnot p \lor \lnot q)
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

This equivalence can be established by applying [[De Morgan's laws]] twice to the fourth line of the above proof.

The exclusive or is also equivalent to the negation of a [[logical biconditional]], by the rules of material implication (a [[material conditional]] is equivalent to the disjunction of the negation of its [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] and its consequence) and [[If and only if|material equivalence]].

In summary, we have, in mathematical and in engineering notation:
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
  p \oplus q &amp; = &amp; (p \land \lnot q) &amp; \lor &amp; (\lnot p \land q) &amp; = &amp; p\overline{q} + \overline{p}q \\[3pt]
             &amp; = &amp; (p \lor q) &amp; \land &amp; (\lnot p \lor \lnot q) &amp; = &amp; (p + q)(\overline{p} + \overline{q}) \\[3pt]
             &amp; = &amp; (p \lor q) &amp; \land &amp; \lnot (p \land q) &amp; = &amp; (p + q)(\overline{pq})
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

==Relation to modern algebra==

Although the [[Operation (mathematics)|operators]] &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt; ([[Logical conjunction|conjunction]]) and &lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt; ([[Logical disjunction|disjunction]]) are very useful in logic systems, they fail a more generalizable structure in the following way:

The systems &lt;math&gt;(\{T, F\}, \wedge)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(\{T, F\}, \lor)&lt;/math&gt; are [[monoid]]s, but neither is a [[group (mathematics)|group]]. This unfortunately prevents the combination of these two systems into larger structures, such as a [[Ring (mathematics)|mathematical ring]].

However, the system using exclusive or &lt;math&gt;(\{T, F\}, \oplus)&lt;/math&gt; '''is''' an [[abelian group]].  The combination of operators &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; over elements &lt;math&gt;\{T, F\}&lt;/math&gt; produce the well-known [[field (mathematics)|field]] [[GF(2)|&lt;math&gt;F_2&lt;/math&gt;]].  This field can represent any logic obtainable with the system &lt;math&gt;(\land, \lor)&lt;/math&gt; and has the added benefit of the arsenal of algebraic analysis tools for fields.

More specifically, if one associates &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; with 0 and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; with 1, one can interpret the logical "AND" operation as multiplication on &lt;math&gt;F_2&lt;/math&gt; and the "XOR" operation as addition on &lt;math&gt;F_2&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
   r = p \land q &amp; \Leftrightarrow &amp; r = p \cdot q \pmod 2 \\[3pt]
  r = p \oplus q &amp; \Leftrightarrow &amp; r = p + q \pmod 2 \\
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Using this basis to describe a boolean system is referred to as [[algebraic normal form]].

==Exclusive "or" in English==
{{essay|section|date=May 2013}}

The Oxford English Dictionary explains "either ... or" as follows:
{{quote|The primary function of ''either'', etc., is to emphasize the [[Mutually independent|perfect indifference]] of the two (or more) things or courses ... ; but a secondary function is to emphasize the mutual exclusiveness, {{=}} either of the two, but not both.&lt;ref&gt;or, conj.2 (adv.3) 2a ''Oxford English Dictionary'', second edition (1989). OED Online.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The exclusive-or explicitly states "one or the other, but not neither nor both." However, the mapping correspondence between formal [[Boolean algebra|Boolean]] operators and natural language conjunctions is far from simple or one-to-one, and has been studied for decades in [[linguistics]] and [[analytic philosophy]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Following this kind of common-sense intuition about "or", it is sometimes argued that in many natural languages, [[English language|English]] included, the word "or" has an "exclusive" sense.&lt;ref&gt;Jennings quotes numerous authors saying that the word "or" has an exclusive sense. See Chapter 3, "The First Myth of 'Or'":&lt;br/&gt;{{cite book |last=Jennings |first=R. E. |date=1994 |title=The Genealogy of Disjunction |url= |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The '''exclusive disjunction''' of a pair of propositions, (''p'', ''q''), is supposed to mean  that ''p'' is true or ''q'' is true, but not both.  For example, it might be argued that the normal intention of a statement like "You may have coffee, or you may have tea" is to stipulate that exactly one of the conditions can be true. Certainly under some circumstances a sentence like this example should be taken as forbidding the possibility of one's accepting both options. Even so, there is good reason to suppose that this sort of sentence is not disjunctive at all. If all we know about some disjunction is that it is true overall, we cannot be sure which of its disjuncts is true. For example, if a woman has been told that her friend is either at the snack bar or on the tennis court, she cannot validly infer that he is on the tennis court. But if her waiter tells her that she may have coffee or she may have tea, she can validly infer that she may have tea. Nothing classically thought of as a disjunction has this property. This is so even given that she might reasonably take her waiter as having denied her the possibility of having both coffee and tea.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In English, the construct "either ... or" is usually used to indicate exclusive or and "or" generally used for inclusive.{{dubious|date=January 2013}}  But in Spanish, the word "''o''" (or) can be used in the form "''p o q''" (exclusive) or the form "''o p o q''" (inclusive). Some may contend that any binary or other [[arity|n-ary]] exclusive "or" is true if and only if it has an odd number of true inputs (this is not, however, the only reasonable definition; for example, digital xor gates with multiple inputs typically do not use that definition), and that there is no conjunction in English that has this general property.  For example, Barrett and Stenner contend in the 1971 article "The Myth of the Exclusive 'Or{{' "}} (Mind, 80 (317), 116–121) that no author has produced an example of an English or-sentence that appears to be false because both of its inputs are true, and brush off or-sentences such as "The light bulb is either on or off" as reflecting particular facts about the world rather than the nature of the word "or".  However, the "[[barber paradox]]"—Everybody in town shaves himself or is shaved by the barber, who shaves the barber? -- would not be paradoxical if "or" could not be exclusive (although a purist could say that "either" is required in the statement of the paradox).

Whether these examples can be considered "natural language" is another question.{{dubious|date=January 2013}}  Certainly when one sees a menu stating "Lunch special: sandwich and soup or salad" (parsed as "sandwich and (soup or salad)" according to common usage in the restaurant trade), one would not expect to be permitted to order both soup and salad.  Nor would one expect to order neither soup nor salad, because that belies the nature of the "special", that ordering the two items together is cheaper than ordering them a la carte.  Similarly, a lunch special consisting of one meat, French fries or mashed potatoes and vegetable would consist of three items, only one of which would be a form of potato.  If one wanted to have meat and both kinds of potatoes, one would ask if it were possible to substitute a second order of potatoes for the vegetable.  And, one would not expect to be permitted to have both types of potato and vegetable, because the result would be a vegetable plate rather than a meat plate.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Alternative symbols==
The symbol used for exclusive disjunction varies from one field of application to the next, and even depends on the properties being emphasized in a given context of discussion.  In addition to the abbreviation "XOR", any of the following symbols may also be seen:
* '''&lt;samp&gt;+&lt;/samp&gt;''', a plus sign, which has the advantage that all of the ordinary algebraic properties of mathematical [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] and [[field (mathematics)|fields]] can be used without further ado; but the plus sign is also used for inclusive disjunction in some notation systems; note that exclusive disjunction corresponds to [[addition]] [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] 2, which has the following addition table, clearly [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the one above:

If using [[binary numeral system|binary]] values for true (1) and false (0), then ''exclusive or'' works exactly like [[addition]] [[Modular arithmetic|modulo]] 2.

==Computer science==
[[File:XOR ANSI Labelled.svg|thumb|right|114px|Traditional symbolic representation of an XOR [[logic gate]]]]

===Bitwise operation===
{{Main article|Bitwise operation}}
[[File:Z2^4; Cayley table; binary.svg|thumb|[[Nimber]] addition is the ''exclusive or'' of [[natural number|nonnegative integers]] in [[w:binary numeral system|binary]] representation. This is also the vector addition in &lt;math&gt;(\Z/2\Z)^4&lt;/math&gt;.]]
Exclusive disjunction is often used for bitwise operations. Examples:
* 1 XOR 1 = 0
* 1 XOR 0 = 1
* 0 XOR 1 = 1
* 0 XOR 0 = 0
* {{n-ary|1110|2}} XOR {{n-ary|1001|2}} = {{n-ary|0111|2}} (this is equivalent to addition without [[carry (arithmetic)|carry]])

As noted above, since exclusive disjunction is identical to addition modulo 2, the bitwise exclusive disjunction of two ''n''-bit strings is identical to the standard vector of addition in the [[vector space]] &lt;math&gt;(\Z/2\Z)^n&lt;/math&gt;.

In computer science, exclusive disjunction has several uses:
* It tells whether two bits are unequal.
* It is an optional bit-flipper (the deciding input chooses whether to invert the data input).
* It tells whether there is an [[Parity (mathematics)|odd]] number of 1&amp;nbsp;bits (&lt;math&gt;A \oplus B \oplus C \oplus D \oplus E&lt;/math&gt; is true [[If and only if|iff]] an odd number of the variables are true).

In logical circuits, a simple [[adder (electronics)|adder]] can be made with an [[XOR gate]] to add the numbers, and a series of AND, OR and NOT gates to create the carry output.

On some computer architectures, it is more efficient to store a zero in a register by XOR-ing the register with itself (bits XOR-ed with themselves are always zero) instead of loading and storing the value zero.

In simple threshold activated [[neural network]]s, modeling the XOR function requires a second layer because XOR is not a linearly separable function.

Exclusive-or is sometimes used as a simple mixing function in [[cryptography]], for example, with [[one-time pad]] or [[Feistel cipher|Feistel network]] systems.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Exclusive-or is also heavily used in block ciphers such as AES (Rijndael) or Serpent and in block cipher implementation (CBC, CFB, OFB or CTR).

Similarly, XOR can be used in generating [[entropy pool]]s for [[hardware random number generator]]s.  The XOR operation preserves randomness, meaning that a random bit XORed with a non-random bit will result in a random bit.  Multiple sources of potentially random data can be combined using XOR, and the unpredictability of the output is guaranteed to be at least as good as the best individual source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davies|first=Robert B|title=Exclusive OR (XOR) and hardware random number generators|url=http://www.robertnz.net/pdf/xor2.pdf|accessdate=28 August 2013|date=28 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

XOR is used in [[RAID]] 3–6 for creating parity information.  For example, RAID can "back up" bytes {{n-ary|10011100|2}} and {{n-ary|01101100|2}} from two (or more) hard drives by XORing the just mentioned bytes, resulting in ({{n-ary|11110000|2}}) and writing it to another drive.  Under this method, if any one of the three hard drives are lost, the lost byte can be re-created by XORing bytes from the remaining drives. For instance,  if the drive containing {{n-ary|01101100|2}} is lost, {{n-ary|10011100|2}} and {{n-ary|11110000|2}} can be XORed to recover the lost byte.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nobel|first=Rickard|title=How RAID 5 actually works|accessdate=23 March 2017|date=26 July 2011|url=http://rickardnobel.se/how-raid5-works}}&lt;/ref&gt;

XOR is also used to detect an overflow in the result of a signed binary arithmetic operation. If the leftmost retained bit of the result is not the same as the infinite number of digits to the left, then that means overflow occurred. XORing those two bits will give a "1" if there is an overflow.

XOR can be used to swap two numeric variables in computers, using the [[XOR swap algorithm]]; however this is regarded as more of a curiosity and not encouraged in practice.

[[XOR linked list]]s leverage XOR properties in order to save space to represent [[doubly linked list]] data structures.

In [[computer graphics]], XOR-based drawing methods are often used to manage such items as [[bounding volume|bounding boxes]] and [[cursor (computers)|cursors]] on systems without [[alpha compositing|alpha channels]] or overlay planes.

==Encodings==
Apart from the ASCII codes, the operator is encoded at {{unichar|22BB|XOR|html=}} and {{unichar|2295|CIRCLED PLUS|html=}}, both in block [[Mathematical operators and symbols in Unicode#Mathematical Operators|Mathematical Operators]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47231">'''Functionalism''' is a view in the [[philosophy of the mind|theory of the mind]]. It states that mental states (beliefs, desires, being in pain, etc.) are constituted solely by their functional role – that is, they have causal relations to other mental states, numerous sensory inputs, and behavioral outputs.&lt;ref name="Block1996"&gt;Block, Ned. (1996). "What is functionalism?" a revised version of the entry on functionalism in ''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy Supplement'', Macmillan. 
([http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/philo/faculty/block/papers/functionalism.pdf PDF online])&lt;/ref&gt; Functionalism developed largely as an alternative to the [[identity theory of mind]] and [[behaviorism]].

Functionalism is a theoretical level between the physical implementation and behavioral output.&lt;ref name="Marr1982"&gt;Marr, D. (1982). ''Vision: A Computational Approach''. San Francisco: Freeman &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is different from its predecessors of [[Cartesian dualism]] (advocating independent mental and physical substances) and Skinnerian [[behaviorism]] and [[physicalism]] (declaring only physical substances) because it is only concerned with the effective functions of the brain, through its organization or its "software programs".

Since mental states are identified by a functional role, they are said to be realized on multiple levels; in other words, they are able to be manifested in various systems, even perhaps computers, so long as the system performs the appropriate functions. While computers are physical devices with electronic substrate that perform [[computation]]s on inputs to give outputs, so brains are physical devices with neural substrate that perform computations on inputs which produce behaviors.

==Multiple realizability==
An important part of some accounts of functionalism is the idea of [[multiple realizability]]. Since, according to standard functionalist theories, mental states are the corresponding functional role, mental states can be sufficiently explained without taking into account the underlying physical medium (e.g. the brain, neurons, etc.) that realizes such states; one need only take into account the higher-level functions in the cognitive system. Since mental states are not limited to a particular medium, they can be realized in multiple ways, including, theoretically, within non-biological systems, such as computers. In other words, a silicon-based machine could, in principle, have the same sort of mental life that a human being has, provided that its cognitive system realized the proper functional roles. Thus, mental states are individuated much like a valve; a valve can be made of plastic or metal or whatever material, as long as it performs the proper function (say, controlling the flow of liquid through a tube by blocking and unblocking its pathway).

However, there have been some functionalist theories that combine with the identity theory of mind, which deny multiple realizability. Such ''Functional Specification Theories'' (FSTs) (Levin, § 3.4), as they are called, were most notably developed by [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]]&lt;ref name="Lewis1980"&gt;Lewis, David. (1980). "Mad Pain and Martian Pain". In Block (1980a) Vol. 1, pp.&amp;nbsp;216–222.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[David Malet Armstrong]].&lt;ref name="Armstrong1968"&gt;Armstrong, D.M. (1968). ''A Materialistic Theory of the Mind''. London: RKP.&lt;/ref&gt; According to FSTs, mental states are the particular "realizers" of the functional role, not the functional role itself.  The mental state of belief, for example, just is whatever brain or neurological process that realizes the appropriate belief function.  Thus, unlike standard versions of functionalism (often called ''Functional State Identity Theories''), FSTs do not allow for the multiple realizability of mental states, because the fact that mental states are realized by brain states is essential.  What often drives this view is the belief that if we were to encounter an alien race with a cognitive system composed of significantly different material from humans' (e.g., silicon-based) but performed the same functions as human mental states (e.g., they tend to yell "Yowzass!" when poked with sharp objects, etc.) then we would say that their type of mental state is perhaps similar to ours, but too different to say it's the same. For some, this may be a disadvantage to FSTs. Indeed, one of [[Hilary Putnam]]'s&lt;ref name="Putnam1960"&gt;Putnam, Hilary. (1960). "Minds and Machines". Reprinted in Putnam (1975a).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Putnam1967"&gt;Putnam, Hilary. (1967). "Psychological Predicates". In ''Art, Mind, and Religion'', W.H. Capitan and D.D. Merrill (eds.), pp.&amp;nbsp;37–48. (Later published as "The Nature of Mental States" in Putnam (1975a).&lt;/ref&gt; arguments for his version of functionalism relied on the intuition that such alien creatures would have the same mental states as humans do, and that the multiple realizability of standard functionalism makes it a better theory of mind.

==Types==

===Machine-state functionalism===
[[Image:Maquina.png|thumb|right| Artistic representation of a [[Turing machine]].]]
The broad position of "functionalism" can be articulated in many different varieties. The first formulation of a functionalist theory of mind was put forth by [[Hilary Putnam]]&lt;ref name="Putnam1960"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Putnam1967"/&gt; in the 1960s. This formulation, which is now called '''machine-state functionalism''', or just '''machine functionalism''', was inspired by the analogies which Putnam and others noted between the [[mind]] and the theoretical "machines" or computers capable of computing any given [[algorithm]] which were developed by [[Alan Turing]] (called '''[[Turing machine]]s'''). It should be noted that Putnam himself, by the mid-1970s, had begun questioning this position. The beginning of his opposition to machine-state functionalism can be read about in his [[Twin Earth thought experiment]].

In non-technical terms, a Turing machine is not a physical object, but rather an abstract machine built upon a mathematical model. Typically, a Turing Machine has a horizontal tape divided into rectangular cells arranged from left to right. The tape itself is infinite in length, and each cell may contain a symbol. The symbols used for any given "machine" can vary. The machine has a ''read-write head'' that scans cells and moves in left and right directions. The action of the machine is determined by the symbol in the cell being scanned and a table of transition rules that serve as the machine's programming. Because of the infinite tape, a traditional Turing Machine has an infinite amount of time to compute any particular function or any number of functions. In the below example, each cell is either blank (''B'') or has a ''1'' written on it. These are the inputs to the machine. The possible outputs are:

*Halt: Do nothing.
*''R'': move one square to the right.
*''L'': move one square to the left.
*''B'': erase whatever is on the square.
*''1'': erase whatever is on the square and print a '1''.

An extremely simple example of a Turing machine which
writes out the sequence '111' after scanning three blank squares and then stops as specified by the following machine table:

{| border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"
|  ||'''State One''' || '''State Two''' || '''State Three'''
|-
|B || write 1; stay in state 1 || write 1; stay in state 2 || write 1; stay in state 3
|-
|1 || go right; go to state 2 || go right; go to state 3 || [halt]
|-
|}

This table states that if the machine is in state one and scans a blank square (''B''), it will print a ''1'' and remain in state one. If it is in state one and reads a ''1'', it will move one square to the right and also go into state two. If it is in state two and reads a ''B'', it will print a ''1'' and stay in state two. If it is in state two and reads a ''1'', it will move one square to the right and go into state three. If it is in state three and reads a ''B'', it prints a ''1'' and remains in state three. Finally, if it is in state three and reads a ''1'', then it will stay in state three.

The essential point to consider here is the ''nature of the states'' of the Turing machine. Each state can be defined exclusively in terms of its relations to the other states as well as inputs and outputs. State one, for example, is simply the state in which the machine, if it reads a ''B'', writes a ''1'' and stays in that state, and in which, if it reads a ''1'', it moves one square to the right and goes into a different state. This is the functional definition of state one; it is its causal role in the overall system. The details of how it accomplishes what it accomplishes and of its material constitution are completely irrelevant. 

The above point is critical to an understanding of machine-state functionalism. Since Turing machines are not required to be physical systems, "anything capable of going through a succession of states in time can be a Turing machine".&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, H. (1967). “The Mental Life of Some Machines,” in H.-N. Castaneda (Ed.), Intentionality, Minds, and Perception. Detroit, MI: Wayne State University Press, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; Because biological organisms “go through a succession of states in time”, any such organisms could also be equivalent to Turing machines.  

According to machine-state functionalism, the nature of a mental state is just like the nature of the Turing machine states described above. If one can show the rational functioning and computing skills of these machines to be comparable to the rational functioning and computing skills of human beings, it follows that Turing machine behavior closely resembles that of human beings.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, H. (1967). “The Mental Life of Some Machines,” in H.-N. Castaneda (Ed.), Intentionality, Minds, and Perception. Detroit, MI: Wayne State University Press, pp. 179-180.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is not a particular physical-chemical composition responsible for the particular machine or mental state, it is the programming rules which produce the effects that are responsible. To put it another way, any rational preference is due to the rules being followed, not to the specific material composition of the agent.

===Psycho-functionalism===
A second form of functionalism is based on the rejection of [[behaviorism|behaviorist]] theories in psychology and their replacement with empirical cognitive models of the mind. This view is most closely associated with [[Jerry Fodor]] and [[Zenon Pylyshyn]] and has been labeled '''psycho-functionalism'''.

The fundamental idea of psycho-functionalism is that psychology is an irreducibly complex science and that the terms that we use to describe the entities and properties of the mind in our best psychological theories cannot be redefined in terms of simple behavioral dispositions, and further, that such a redefinition would not be desirable or salient were it achievable. Psychofunctionalists view psychology as employing the same sorts of irreducibly [[teleology|teleological]] or purposive explanations as the biological sciences. Thus, for example, the function or role of the heart is to pump blood, that of the kidney is to filter it and to maintain certain chemical balances and so on—this is what accounts for the purposes of scientific explanation and taxonomy. There may be an infinite variety of physical realizations for all of the mechanisms, but what is important is only their role in the overall biological theory. In an analogous manner, the role of mental states, such as belief and desire, is determined by the functional or causal role that is designated for them within our best ''scientific'' psychological theory. If some mental state which is postulated by [[folk psychology]] (e.g. hysteria) is determined not to have any fundamental role in cognitive psychological explanation, then that particular state may be considered not to exist .
On the other hand, if it turns out that there are states which theoretical cognitive psychology posits as necessary for explanation of human behavior but which are not foreseen by ordinary folk psychological language, then these entities or states exist.

===Analytic functionalism===
A third form of functionalism is concerned with the meanings of theoretical terms in general. This view is most closely associated with [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]] and is often referred to as '''analytic functionalism''' or '''conceptual functionalism'''. The basic idea of analytic functionalism is that theoretical terms are implicitly defined by the theories in whose formulation they occur and not by intrinsic properties of the phonemes they comprise. In the case of ordinary language terms, such as "belief", "desire", or "hunger", the idea is that such terms get their meanings from our common-sense "folk psychological" theories about them, but that such conceptualizations are not sufficient to withstand the rigor imposed by materialistic theories of reality and causality. Such terms are subject to conceptual analyses which take something like the following form:

:Mental state M is the state that is preconceived by P and causes Q.

For example, the state of '''pain''' is ''caused'' by sitting on a tack and ''causes'' loud cries, and higher order mental states of anger and resentment directed at the careless person who left a tack lying around. These sorts of functional definitions in terms of causal roles are claimed to be ''[[Logical truth|analytic]]'' and ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' truths about the submental states and the (largely fictitious) propositional attitudes they describe. Hence, its proponents are known as ''analytic'' or ''conceptual'' functionalists. The essential difference between analytic and psychofunctionalism is that the latter emphasizes the importance of laboratory observation and experimentation in the determination of which mental state terms and concepts are genuine and which functional identifications may be considered to be genuinely [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] and ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' identities. The former, on the other hand, claims that such identities are [[Logical truth|necessary]] and not subject to empirical scientific investigation.

===Homuncular functionalism===
'''Homuncular functionalism''' was developed largely by [[Daniel Dennett]] and has been advocated by [[William Lycan]]. It arose in response to the challenges that [[Ned Block]]'s [[China Brain]] (a.k.a. Chinese nation) and [[John Searle]]'s [[Chinese room]] thought experiments presented for the more traditional forms of functionalism (see below under "Criticism"). In attempting to overcome the conceptual difficulties that arose from the idea of a nation full of Chinese people wired together, each person working as a single neuron to produce in the wired-together whole the functional mental states of an individual mind, many functionalists simply bit the bullet, so to speak, and argued that such a Chinese nation would indeed possess all of the qualitative and intentional properties of a mind; i.e. it would become a sort of systemic or collective mind with propositional attitudes and other mental characteristics. Whatever the worth of this latter hypothesis, it was immediately objected that it [[logical consequence|entailed]] an unacceptable sort of mind-mind supervenience: the ''systemic'' mind which somehow emerged at the higher-level must necessarily supervene on the individual minds of each individual member of the Chinese nation, to stick to Block's formulation. But this would seem to put into serious doubt, if not directly contradict, the fundamental idea of the supervenience thesis: there can be no change in the mental realm without some change in the underlying physical substratum. This can be easily seen if we label the set of [[mental fact]]s that occur at the higher-level ''M1'' and the set of mental facts that occur at the lower-level ''M2''. Given the transitivity of supervenience, if ''M1'' supervenes on ''M2'', and ''M2'' supervenes on ''P'' (physical base), then ''M1'' and ''M2'' both supervene on ''P'', even though they are (allegedly) totally different sets of mental facts.

Since mind-mind supervenience seemed to have become acceptable in functionalist circles, it seemed to some that the only way to resolve the puzzle was to postulate the existence of an entire hierarchical series of mind levels (analogous to [[homunculi]]) which became less and less sophisticated in terms of functional organization and physical composition all the way down to the level of the physico-mechanical neuron or group of neurons. The homunculi at each level, on this view, have authentic mental properties but become simpler and less intelligent as one works one's way down the hierarchy.

===Mechanistic functionalism===

This account remains a sort of functionalism because functional relations are still essential to [[Cognitive psychology|mental states]], but it is mechanistic because the functional relations are always manifestations of concrete structures—albeit structures understood at a certain level of abstraction.

Mechanistic functionalism leads functionalism away from the traditional functionalist autonomy of psychology from neuroscience and towards integrating psychology and neuroscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Piccinini G. | author2 = Craver C. F. | year = 2011 | title = Integrating psychology and neuroscience: Functional analyses as mechanism sketches | url = | journal = Synthese | volume = 183 | issue = 3| pages = 283–311 | doi = 10.1007/s11229-011-9898-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By providing an applicable framework for merging traditional psychological models with neurological data, mechanistic functionalism may be understood as reconciling the functionalist theory of mind with neurological accounts of how the brain actually works. This is due to the fact that mechanistic explanations of function attempt to provide an account of how functional states (mental states) are physically realized through neurological mechanisms.

==Physicalism==
There is much confusion about the sort of relationship that is claimed to exist (or not exist) between the general thesis of functionalism and [[physicalism]]. It has often been claimed that functionalism somehow "disproves" or falsifies physicalism ''[[tout court]]'' (i.e. without further explanation or description). On the other hand, most philosophers of mind who are functionalists claim to be physicalists—indeed, some of them, such as David Lewis, have claimed to be strict reductionist-type physicalists.

Functionalism is fundamentally what Ned Block has called a broadly metaphysical thesis as opposed to a narrowly [[ontological]] one.  That is, functionalism is not so much concerned with ''what there is'' than with what it is that characterizes a certain type of mental state, e.g. pain, as the type of state that it is. Previous attempts to answer the mind-body problem have all tried to resolve it by answering ''both'' questions: dualism says there are two substances and that mental states are characterized by their immateriality; behaviorism claimed that there was one substance and that mental states were behavioral disposition; physicalism asserted the existence of just one substance and characterized the mental states as physical states (as in "pain = C-fiber firings").

On this understanding, '''type physicalism''' can be seen as incompatible with functionalism, since it claims that what characterizes mental states (e.g. pain) is that they are physical in nature, while functionalism says that what characterizes pain is its functional/causal role and its relationship with yelling "ouch", etc. However, any weaker sort of physicalism which makes the simple ontological claim that everything that exists is made up of physical matter is perfectly compatible with functionalism. Moreover,  most functionalists who are physicalists require that the properties that are quantified over in functional definitions be physical properties. Hence, they ''are'' physicalists, even though the general thesis of functionalism itself does not commit them to being so.

In the case of David Lewis, there is a distinction in the concepts of "having pain" (a [[rigid designator]] true of the same things in all possible worlds) and just "pain" (a non-rigid designator). Pain, for Lewis, stands for something like the definite description "the state with the causal role x". The referent of the description in humans is a type of brain state to be determined by science. The referent among silicon-based life forms is something else. The referent of the description among angels is some immaterial, non-physical state. For Lewis, therefore, ''local'' type-physical reductions are possible and compatible with conceptual functionalism. (See also Lewis's [[mad pain and Martian pain]].) There seems to be some confusion between types and tokens that needs to be cleared up in the functionalist analysis.

==Criticism==

=== China brain ===
{{Main|China brain}}
Ned Block&lt;ref name="Block1980b"&gt;Block, Ned. (1980b). "Troubles With Functionalism", in (1980a).&lt;/ref&gt; argues against the functionalist proposal of [[multiple realizability]], where hardware implementation is irrelevant because only the functional level is important.  The "China brain" or "Chinese nation" thought experiment involves supposing that the entire nation of China systematically organizes itself to operate just like a brain, with each individual acting as a neuron.  (The tremendous difference in speed of operation of each unit is not addressed.). According to functionalism, so long as the people are performing the proper functional roles, with the proper causal relations between inputs and outputs, the system will be a real mind, with mental states, consciousness, and so on. However, Block argues, this is patently absurd, so there must be something wrong with the thesis of functionalism since it would allow this to be a legitimate description of a mind.

Some functionalists believe China would have qualia but that due to the size it is impossible to imagine China being conscious.&lt;ref name="Lycan1987"&gt;{{cite book | last = Lycan | first = William | title = Consciousness | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1987 | isbn = 9780262121248 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, it may be the case that we are constrained by our [[theory of mind]]&lt;ref ="see, eg" name="BCLF1985"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baron-Cohen | first1 = Simon | last2 = Leslie | first2 = Alan M. | last3 = Frith | first3 = Uta | title = Does the autistic child have a "theory of mind"? | journal = [[Cognition (journal)|Cognition]] | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 37&amp;ndash;46 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(85)90022-8 | pmid = 2934210 | date = October 1985 | url = https://doi.org/10.1016/0010-0277(85)90022-8 | ref = harv | postscript = . }} [https://web.archive.org/web/20170928145836/http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/images/personal-alan-leslie/publications/Baron-Cohen%20Leslie%20%26%20Frith%201985.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; and will never be able to understand what Chinese-nation consciousness is like. Therefore, if functionalism is true either qualia will exist across all hardware or will not exist at all but are illusory.&lt;ref name="Dennett1990"&gt;{{citation | last = Dennett | first = Daniel | author-link = Daniel Dennett | contribution = Quining Qualia | editor-last = Lycan | editor-first = William G. | title = Mind and cognition: a reader | publisher = Basil Blackwell | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA | year = 1990 | isbn = 9780631160762 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Chinese room===
{{Main|Chinese room}}

The [[Chinese room]] argument by [[John Searle]]&lt;ref name="Searle1980"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Searle, John |year=1980 |title=Minds, Brains and Programs |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=3 |url=http://www.bbsonline.org/Preprints/OldArchive/bbs.searle2.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010221025515/http://www.bbsonline.org/Preprints/OldArchive/bbs.searle2.html |archivedate=2001-02-21 |df= | doi = 10.1017/s0140525x00005756 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a direct attack on the claim that thought can be represented as a set of functions. The thought experiment asserts that it is possible to mimic intelligent action without any interpretation or understanding through the use of a purely functional system. In short, Searle describes a person who only speaks English who is in a room with only Chinese symbols in baskets and a rule book in English for moving the symbols around.  The person is then ordered by people outside of the room to follow the rule book for sending certain symbols out of the room when given certain symbols. Further suppose that the people outside of the room are Chinese speakers and are communicating with the person inside via the Chinese symbols.  According to Searle, it would be absurd to claim that the English speaker inside knows Chinese simply based on these syntactic processes.  This thought experiment attempts to show that systems which operate merely on syntactic processes (inputs and outputs, based on algorithms) cannot realize any semantics (meaning) or intentionality (aboutness).  Thus, Searle attacks the idea that thought can be equated with following a set of syntactic rules; that is, functionalism is an insufficient theory of the mind.

As noted above, in connection with Block's Chinese nation, many functionalists responded to Searle's [[thought experiment]] by suggesting that there was a form of mental activity going on at a higher level than the man in the Chinese room could comprehend (the so-called "system reply"); that is, the system does know Chinese. Of course, Searle responds that there is nothing more than syntax going on at the higher-level as well, so this reply is subject to the same initial problems. Furthermore, Searle suggests the man in the room could simply memorize the rules and symbol relations. Again, though he would convincingly mimic communication, he would be aware only of the symbols and rules, not of the meaning behind them.

===Inverted spectrum===
{{Main|Inverted spectrum}}

Another main criticism of functionalism is the [[inverted spectrum]] or inverted [[qualia]] scenario, most specifically proposed as an objection to functionalism by Ned Block.&lt;ref name=Block1980b/&gt;&lt;ref name="BF1972"&gt;Block, Ned and Fodor, J. (1972). "What Psychological States Are Not". ''Philosophical Review'' 81.&lt;/ref&gt; This thought experiment involves supposing that there is a person, call her Jane, that is born with a condition which makes her see the opposite spectrum of light that is normally perceived. Unlike normal people, Jane sees the color violet as yellow, orange as blue, and so forth. So, suppose, for example, that you and Jane are looking at the same orange.  While you perceive the fruit as colored orange, Jane sees it as colored blue.  However, when asked what color the piece of fruit is, both you and Jane will report "orange".  In fact, one can see that all of your behavioral as well as functional relations to colors will be the same.  Jane will, for example, properly obey traffic signs just as any other person would, even though this involves the color perception. Therefore, the argument goes, since there can be two people who are functionally identical, yet have different mental states (differing in their qualitative or phenomenological aspects), functionalism is not robust enough to explain individual differences in qualia.&lt;ref name="Block1994"&gt;Block, Ned. (1994). Qualia. In S. Guttenplan (ed), ''A Companion to Philosophy of Mind''. Oxford: Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Chalmers]] tries to show&lt;ref name="Chalmers 1996"&gt;Chalmers, David. (1996). ''The Conscious Mind''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; that even though mental content cannot be fully accounted for in functional terms, there is nevertheless a ''nomological correlation'' between mental states and functional states in this world. A silicon-based robot, for example, whose functional profile matched our own, would ''have'' to be fully conscious. His argument for this claim takes the form of a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]''. The general idea is that since it would be very unlikely for a conscious human being to experience a change in its qualia which it utterly fails to notice, mental content and functional profile appear to be inextricably bound together, at least in the human case. If the subject's qualia were to change, we would expect the subject to notice, and therefore his functional profile to follow suit. A similar argument is applied to the notion of [[Absent qualia|''absent'' qualia]]. In this case, Chalmers argues that it would be very unlikely for a subject to experience a fading of his qualia which he fails to notice and respond to. This, coupled with the independent assertion that a conscious being's functional profile just could be maintained, irrespective of its experiential state, leads to the conclusion that the subject of these experiments would remain fully conscious. The problem with this argument, however, as Brian G. Crabb (2005) has observed, is that it begs the central question: How could Chalmers ''know'' that functional profile can be preserved, for example while the conscious subject's brain is being supplanted with a silicon substitute, unless he already assumes that the subject's possibly changing qualia would not be a determining factor? And while changing or fading qualia in a conscious subject might force changes in its functional profile, this tells us nothing about the case of a permanently inverted or unconscious robot. A subject with inverted qualia from birth would have nothing to notice or adjust to. Similarly, an unconscious functional simulacrum of ourselves (a zombie) would have no experiential changes to notice or adjust to. Consequently, Crabb argues, Chalmers' "fading qualia" and "dancing qualia" arguments fail to establish that cases of permanently inverted or absent qualia are nomologically impossible.

A related critique of the inverted spectrum argument is that it assumes that mental states (differing in their qualitative or phenomenological aspects) can be independent of the functional relations in the brain. Thus, it [[begs the question]] of functional mental states: its assumption denies the possibility of functionalism itself, without offering any independent justification for doing so. (Functionalism says that mental states are produced by the functional relations in the brain.) This same type of problem—that there is no argument, just an antithetical assumption at their base—can also be said of both the Chinese room and the Chinese nation arguments. Notice, however, that Crabb's response to Chalmers does not commit this fallacy: His point is the more restricted observation that ''even if'' inverted or absent qualia turn out to be nomologically impossible, and it is perfectly possible that we might subsequently discover this fact by other means, Chalmers' argument fails to demonstrate that they are impossible.

===Twin Earth===
{{Main|Twin Earth thought experiment}}
The [[Twin Earth thought experiment]], introduced by Hilary Putnam,&lt;ref name="Putnam1975b"&gt;Putnam, Hilary. (1975b). "The Meaning of 'Meaning{{'"}}, reprinted in Putnam (1975a).([http://internalism.googlegroups.com/web/Putnam%20-%20The%20meaning%20of%20%27meaning%27.pdf?gda=twdJY1oAAABFSTngQf24Sy1RD7yNn1iVgy3Odg0ZctAT1N_Bh2qhdGG1qiJ7UbTIup-M2XPURDQe1sJTwbuelxnpaL6JzH4yeFMfiRQRvg6UTOJgQe0faGtRc9Sp7hcxNJ_gjwZr8bQ PDF online] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618031552/http://internalism.googlegroups.com/web/Putnam%20-%20The%20meaning%20of%20%27meaning%27.pdf?gda=twdJY1oAAABFSTngQf24Sy1RD7yNn1iVgy3Odg0ZctAT1N_Bh2qhdGG1qiJ7UbTIup-M2XPURDQe1sJTwbuelxnpaL6JzH4yeFMfiRQRvg6UTOJgQe0faGtRc9Sp7hcxNJ_gjwZr8bQ |date=June 18, 2013 }})&lt;/ref&gt; is responsible for one of the main arguments used against functionalism, although it was originally intended as an argument against [[internalism and externalism|semantic internalism]]. The thought experiment is simple and runs as follows. Imagine a Twin Earth which is identical to Earth in every way but one: water does not have the chemical structure H₂O, but rather some other structure, say XYZ. It is critical, however, to note that XYZ on Twin Earth is still called "water" and exhibits all the same macro-level properties that H₂O exhibits on Earth (i.e., XYZ is also a clear drinkable liquid that is in lakes, rivers, and so on). Since these worlds are identical in every way except in the underlying chemical structure of water, you and your Twin Earth [[doppelgänger]] see exactly the same things, meet exactly the same people, have exactly the same jobs, behave exactly the same way, and so on. In other words, since you share the same inputs, outputs, and relations between other mental states, you are functional duplicates. So, for example, you both believe that water is wet. However, the content of your mental state of believing that water is wet differs from your duplicate's because your belief is of H₂O, while your duplicate's is of XYZ. Therefore, so the argument goes, since two people can be functionally identical, yet have different mental states, functionalism cannot sufficiently account for all mental states.

Most defenders of functionalism initially responded to this argument by attempting to maintain a sharp distinction between internal and external content. The internal contents of propositional attitudes, for example, would consist exclusively in those aspects of them which have no relation with the external world ''and'' which bear the necessary functional/causal properties that allow for relations with other internal mental states. Since no one has yet been able to formulate a clear basis or justification for the existence of such a distinction in mental contents, however, this idea has generally been abandoned in favor of externalist ''causal theories of mental contents'' (also known as [[informational semantics]]). Such a position is represented, for example, by [[Jerry Fodor]]'s account of an "asymmetric causal theory" of mental content. This view simply entails the modification of functionalism to include within its scope a very broad interpretation of input and outputs to include the objects that are the causes of mental representations in the external world.

The twin earth argument hinges on the assumption that experience with an imitation water would cause a different mental state than experience with natural water. However, since no one would notice the difference between the two waters, this assumption is likely false. Further, this basic assumption is directly antithetical to functionalism; and, thereby, the twin earth argument does not constitute a genuine argument: as this assumption entails a flat denial of functionalism itself (which would say that the two waters would not produce different mental states, because the functional relationships would remain unchanged).

===Meaning holism===
Another common criticism of functionalism is that it implies a radical form of [[semantic holism]]. Block and Fodor&lt;ref name="BF1972"/&gt; referred to this as the ''damn/darn problem''. The difference between saying "damn" or "darn" when one smashes one's finger with a hammer can be mentally significant. But since these outputs are, according to functionalism, related to many (if not all) internal mental states, two people who experience the same pain and react with different outputs must share little (perhaps nothing) in common in any of their mental states. But this is counterintuitive; it seems clear that two people share something significant in their mental states of being in pain if they both smash their finger with a hammer, whether or not they utter the same word when they cry out in pain.

Another possible solution to this problem is to adopt a moderate (or molecularist) form of holism. But even if this succeeds in the case of pain, in the case of beliefs and meaning, it faces the difficulty of formulating a distinction between relevant and non-relevant contents (which can be difficult to do without invoking an [[analytic–synthetic distinction]], as many seek to avoid).

===Triviality arguments===

According to Ned Block, if functionalism is to avoid the chauvinism of type-physicalism, it becomes overly liberal in "ascribing mental properties to things that do not in fact have them".&lt;ref name=Block1980b/&gt; As an example, he proposes that the economy of Bolivia might be organized such that the economic states, inputs, and outputs would be isomorphic to a person under some bizarre mapping from mental to economic variables.&lt;ref name=Block1980b/&gt;

Hilary Putnam,&lt;ref name="Putnam1988"&gt;Putnam, H. (1988). ''Reality and representation''. Appendix.

These arguments typically use the assumption that physics leads to a progression of unique states, and that functionalist realization is present whenever there is a mapping from the proposed set of mental states to physical states of the system. Given that the states of a physical system are always at least slightly unique, such a mapping will always exist, so any system is a mind. Formulations of functionalism which stipulate absolute requirements on interaction with external objects (external to the functional account, meaning not defined functionally) are reduced to behaviorism instead of absolute triviality, because the input-output behavior is still required.

[[Peter Godfrey-Smith]] has argued further&lt;ref name="Godfrey-Smith2009"&gt;Peter Godfrey-Smith, "Triviality Arguments against Functionalism". 2009. Philosophical studies 145 (2). [http://philpapers.org/rec/GODTAA]/{{cite web |url=http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~pgs/TrivArgtsFnm-08-Zweb.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522022444/http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~pgs/TrivArgtsFnm-08-Zweb.pdf |archivedate=2011-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that such formulations can still be reduced to triviality if they accept a somewhat innocent-seeming additional assumption. The assumption is that adding a ''transducer layer'', that is, an input-output system, to an object should not change whether that object has mental states. The transducer layer is restricted to producing behavior according to a simple mapping, such as a lookup table, from inputs to actions on the system, and from the state of the system to outputs. However, since the system will be in unique states at each moment and at each possible input, such a mapping will always exist so there will be a transducer layer which will produce whatever physical behavior is desired.

Godfrey-Smith believes that these problems can be addressed using [[causality#Theories|causality]], but that it may be necessary to posit a continuum between objects being minds and not being minds rather than an absolute distinction. Furthermore, constraining the mappings seems to require either consideration of the external behavior as in behaviorism, or discussion of the internal structure of the realization as in identity theory; and though multiple realizability does not seem to be lost, the functionalist claim of the autonomy of high-level functional description becomes questionable.&lt;ref name="Godfrey-Smith2009"/&gt;

[[File:9mm-hollowpoint from XC75.jpg|thumb|Gunshot residue from a pistol shot]]
'''Gunshot residue (GSR)''', also known as '''cartridge discharge residue''' (CDR), "gunfire residue" (GFR), or '''firearm discharge residue''' (FDR), is residue deposited on the hands and clothes of someone who discharges a [[firearm]]. It is principally composed of burnt and unburnt particles from the [[explosive primer]], the [[propellant]]—and possibly fragments of the [[bullet]], [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]] case, and the firearm.

Law enforcement investigators test the clothing and skin of people for GSR to determine if they were near a gun when it discharged. Gunshot residue can travel over 3–5 feet (0.9–1.5 meters) from the gun. At the farthest distance, only a few trace particles may be present.

==History==
In 1971 John Boehm presented some [[micrographs]] of GSR particles found during the examination of bullet entrance holes using a [[scanning electron microscope]]. If the scanning electron microscope is equipped with an [[energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]] detector, the [[chemical elements]] present in such particles, mainly [[lead]], [[antimony]] and [[barium]], can be identified.

In 1979 Wolten et al. proposed a classification of GSR based on composition, [[Morphology (chemistry)|morphology]], and size. Four compositions were considered ''characteristic'':
* [[Lead]], [[antimony]], and [[barium]]
* Barium, [[calcium]], and [[silicon]]
* Antimony
* Barium
The authors proposed some rules about chemical elements that could also be present in these particles.

Wallace and McQuillan published a new classification of the GSR particles in 1984. They labeled as ''unique'' particles those that contain lead, antimony, and barium, or that contain antimony and barium. Wallace and McQuillan also maintained that these particles could contain only some chemical elements.

==Current practice==
In the latest [[ASTM]] Standard Guide for GSR analysis by Scanning Electron Microscopy/Energy Dispersive [[X-ray]] [[Spectroscopy|Spectrometry]] (SEM-EDX) particles containing lead, antimony and barium, and respecting some rules related to the morphology and to the presence of other elements are considered characteristic of GSR. The most definitive method to determine whether a particle is characteristic of or consistent with GSR is by its elemental profile. An approach to the identification of particles characteristic of or consistent with GSR is to compare the elemental profile of the recovered particulate with that collected from case-specific known source items, such as the recovered [[weapon]], Cartridge cases or victim-related items whenever necessary. This approach was called ‘‘case by case’’ by Romolo and Margot in an article published in 2001. In 2010 Dalby et al. published the latest review on the subject and concluded that the adoption of a "case by case" approach to GSR analysis must be seen as preferable, in agreement with Romolo and Margot.

In light of similar particles produced from extraneous sources, both Mosher et al. (1998) and Grima et al. (2012) presented evidence of pyrotechnic particles that can be mistakenly identified as GSR. Both publications highlight that certain markers of exclusion and reference to the general population of collected particulate can help the expert in designating GSR-similar particles as [[Fireworks|firework]]-sourced.

Particle analysis by scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy detector is the most powerful [[forensic]] tool that investigators can use to determine a subject's proximity to a discharging firearm or contact with a surface exposed to GSR (firearm, spent cartridge case, target hole). Test accuracy requires procedures that avoid secondary gunshot residue transfer from police officers onto subjects or items to be tested, and that avoid [[contamination]] in the laboratory.

The two main groups of specialists currently active on gunshot residue analysis are the [[Scientific Working Group]] for Gunshot Residue (SWGGSR) based in USA and the ENFSI EWG Firearms/GSR  Working Group based in Europe.

==Results==
A positive result for GSR from SEM-EDX analysis can mean many things.  Mainly it indicates that the person sampled was either in the vicinity of a gun when it was fired, handled a gun after it was fired, or touched something that was around the gun when it was fired. (For example: When a person goes to the aid of a victim of a gunshot wound, some GSR particles can transfer from the victim.)

A negative result can mean that the person was nowhere near the gun when it was fired, or that they were near it but not close enough for GSR to land on them, or it can mean that the GSR deposited on them wore off. GSR is the consistency of flour and typically only stays on the hands of a living person for 4–6 hours.  Wiping the hands on anything, even putting them in and out of pockets can transfer GSR off the hands.  Victims don't always get GSR on them; even suicide victims can test negative for GSR.

==Matching GSR to a specific source==
If the ammunition used was specifically tagged in some way by special elements, it is possible to know the cartridge used to produce the GSR. Inference about the source of GSR can be based on the examination of the particles found on a suspect and the population of particles found on the victim, in the firearm or in the cartridge case, as suggested by the ASTM Standard Guide for GSR analysis by Scanning Electron Microscopy/Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometry. Advanced analytical techniques such as Ion Beam Analysis (IBA), carried out after Scanning Electron Microscopy, can support further information allowing to infer about the source of GSR particles. Christopher et al. showed as the grouping behaviour of different makes of ammunition can be determined using multivariate analysis. Bullets can be matched back to a gun using comparative ballistics.

==Organic gunshot residue==
[[organic compound|Organic]] gunshot residue can be analysed by [[analytical techniques]] such as [[chromatography]], [[capillary electrophoresis]], and [[mass spectrometry]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1168">A '''higraph''' is a diagramming object that formalizes relations into a visual structure, it was developed by [[David Harel]] in 1988. Higraphs extend [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|mathematical graphs]] by including notions of [[:wikt:depth|depth]] and [[orthogonality]]. In particular, [[Node (graph theory)|nodes]] in a higraph can contain other nodes inside them, creating a hierarchy. The idea was initially developed for applications to [[databases]], [[knowledge representation]], and the behavioral specification of complex [[concurrent systems]] using the higraph-based language of statecharts.

Higraphs are widely used in industrial applications like [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]]. Recently they have been used by [[philosophers]] to formally study the use of [[diagrams]] in [[mathematical proof]]s and reasoning.

[[File:Bois-Reymond.jpg|thumb|[[Emil du Bois-Reymond]], (1818–1896), promulgator of the maxim ''ignoramus et ignorabimus.'' (Heliogravure of a painting &lt;br /&gt; by [[Max Koner]].]]

The [[Latin]] maxim '''''ignoramus et ignorabimus''''', meaning "we do not know and will not know", represents the idea that [[scientific knowledge]] is limited. It was publicized, in this sense, by [[Emil du Bois-Reymond]], a German [[physiologist]], in his publication ''Über die Grenzen des Naturerkennens'' ("On the limits of our understanding of nature") of 1872.

== Seven World Riddles ==

[[Emil du Bois-Reymond]] used the phrase ''ignoramus et ignorabimus'' while discussing what he termed [[Emil du Bois-Reymond#The Seven World Riddles|seven "world riddles"]], in a famous 1880 speech before the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]].

He defined seven "world riddles", of which three, he declared, neither science nor philosophy could ever explain, because they are "[[Transcendence (philosophy)#Kant (and modern philosophy)|transcendent]]". Of the riddles, he considered the following transcendental and declared of them ''ignoramus et ignorabimus:''&lt;ref&gt;William E. Leverette Jr., ''E. L. Youmans' Crusade for Scientific Autonomy and Respectability'', American Quarterly, Vol. 17, No. 1. (Spring, 1965), pg. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;
"1. the ultimate nature of matter and force, 2. the origin of motion, ... 5. the origin of simple [[Sense|sensations]], a quite transcendent question."

== Hilbert's reaction ==

[[David Hilbert]], a widely-respected German mathematician, suggested that such a conceptualization of human knowledge and ability is too pessimistic, and that by considering questions unsolvable, we limit our understanding.

In 1900, during an address to the International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris, Hilbert suggested that answers to problems of mathematics are possible with human effort.  He declared, "In mathematics there is no ''ignorabimus''.",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=D. Hilbert |title=Mathematical Problems: Lecture Delivered before the International Congress of Mathematicians at Paris in 1900 |journal=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society |volume=8 |year=1902 |pages=437–79 |url=http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/hilbert/problems.html | doi = 10.1090/S0002-9904-1902-00923-3 | mr = 1557926}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he worked with other [[Formalism (mathematics)|formalist]]s to establish [[foundations of mathematics#foundation crisis|foundations for mathematics]] during the early 20th century.

On 8 September 1930, [[Hilbert]] elaborated his opinion in a celebrated address to the Society of German Scientists and Physicians, in [[Königsberg]]:&lt;ref name=speech_hilbert_1930/&gt;

{{Cquote|We must not believe those, who today, with philosophical bearing and deliberative tone, prophesy the fall of culture and accept the ''ignorabimus''. For us there is no ''ignorabimus'', and in my opinion none whatever in natural science. In opposition to the foolish ''ignorabimus'' our slogan shall be: ''Wir müssen wissen — wir werden wissen.''&lt;ref name=wissen/&gt; ('We must know - we will know.')}}

Answers to some of Hilbert's Program of [[Hilbert's problems|23 problems]] were found during the 20th century.  Some have been answered definitively; some have not yet been solved; a few have been shown to be impossible to answer with mathematical rigor. 

During 1931, [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] showed that answers to some mathematical questions cannot be answered in the manner we would usually prefer.

== Sociological responses ==
The [[sociologist]] [[Wolf Lepenies]] has discussed the ''ignorabimus'' with the opinion that du Bois-Reymond was not really pessimistic about science:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lepenies|first=Wolf|authorlink=Wolf Lepenies|title=Between Literature and Science: the Rise of Sociology|year=1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=0-521-33810-7|page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|—it is in fact an incredibly self-confident support for scientific hubris masked as modesty—}}

This is in a discussion of [[Friedrich Wolters]], one of the members of the literary group "[[George-Kreis]]". Lepenies comments that Wolters misunderstood the degree of pessimism being expressed about science, but well understood the implication that scientists themselves could be trusted with self-criticism.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20790">'''International Year of Volunteers''' was designated for 2001 by the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. The initiative aimed at increased recognition, facilitation, networking and promotion of [[volunteering]], to highlight the achievements of the millions of volunteers worldwide who devote their time to serving others, and to encourage more people globally to engage in volunteering.

== Origins and goals ==

The concept for a [[United Nations]] year to recognize volunteerism first emerged within the UN system at a 1996 policy forum in [[Japan]] by UNV and [[United Nations University]] (UNU). A February 1997 proposal of the Government of Japan was transmitted through the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN Secretary General]] be placed on the agenda of the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC) in July 1997. ECOSOC, in its resolution 1977/44 of 22 July 1997, recommended to the UN General Assembly that it adopt the resolution proclaiming 2001 the International Year of Volunteers. The UN General Assembly, in its 52nd session on 20 November 1997 in Resolution 52/17,&lt;ref&gt;"Declaration of 2001 as International Year of Volunteers" published by [http://www.unv.org/en/news-resources/resources/un-resolutions/doc/declaration-of-2001-as.html UNV] on November 20, 1997, accessed August 3, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; co-sponsored by 123 countries, passed the ECOSOC resolution, thereby proclaiming 2001 as the International Year of Volunteers. The [[United Nations Volunteers|United Nations Volunteers programme]] (UNV), part of the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP), was designated in the resolution as the international focal point.&lt;ref&gt;"What is the International Year of Volunteers 2001?" published at [https://web.archive.org/web/20001021024611/http://www.iyv2001.org/iyv_eng/whatis/whatis.htm www.iyv2001.org], version October 21, 2000, archived at [[Internet Archive]], accessed August 3, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;"IYV 2001: A chronology" published at [http://www.unv.org/en/news-resources/archive/unv-news/unv-news-december-2001/doc/iyv-2001-a-chronology.html unv.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006175744/http://www.unv.org/en/news-resources/archive/unv-news/unv-news-december-2001/doc/iyv-2001-a-chronology.html |date=2016-10-06 }}, by UN Volunteers, accessed August 11, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Objectives of IYV were:
* increased recognition of volunteers and their contributions
* increased facilitation and support for volunteerism
* promoting the achievements of volunteers
* "attracting more requests for the deployment of volunteers, at attracting offers of service from new candidates with a view to enhancing operational activities, and generally creating a climate of public and official opinion even more supportive of voluntary action"&lt;ref&gt;"International Year of Volunteers 2001" published at [http://www.worldvolunteerweb.org/tools/about-us/iyv-2001.html worldvolunteerweb.org], accessed August 3, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== Administration ==

[[Sharon Capeling-Alakija]] was the Executive Coordinator of United Nations Volunteers during IYV 2001. As the international focal point, UNV, based in [[Bonn]], [[Germany]], took the lead in all organizing and promotion regarding the year internationally.&lt;ref&gt;"Background on the International Year of Volunteers 2001" published at [https://web.archive.org/web/20001212202200/http://www.iyv2001.org/iyv_eng/whatis/bakgrnd.htm www.iyv2001.org], version December 12, 2000, archived at [[Internet Archive]], accessed August 3, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''www.iyv2001.org'' website, launched in December 1998 by UNV,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; provided resources for United Nations organizations, non-governmental organizations and governments to recognize the year in some way. The resources provided by the site included:
* a IYV overview slide presentation
* a slide presentation on IYV national committees
* a side presentation on planning
* IYV banners / graphics for web pages
* suggestions on local IYV activities and partnerships&lt;ref&gt;"The International Year of Volunteers toolkit" published at [https://web.archive.org/web/20001205004500/http://www.iyv2001.org/iyv_eng/toolkit/toolkit.htm www.iyv2001.org], version December 5, 2000, archived at [[Internet Archive]], accessed August 3, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The IYV logo was a creation and volunteer contribution from Argentine designer Sandra Rojas, and was provided in the six official UN languages as well as a composite logo that combines all six in one.&lt;ref&gt;"International Year of Volunteers logo" published at [https://web.archive.org/web/20011030073536/http://www.iyv2001.org/iyv_eng/toolkit/logo/logo.htm www.iyv2001.org], version October 3, 2001, archived at [[Internet Archive]], accessed August 3, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Word Volunteer Conference in [[Amsterdam]], in honor of IYV, the [[International Association for Volunteer Effort]] re-issued a revised Universal Declaration on Volunteering, first issued in 1990 during the World Volunteer Conference in Paris. "This Declaration supports the right of every woman, man and child to associate freely and to volunteer regardless of their cultural and ethnic origin, religion, age, gender, and physical, social or economic condition."&lt;ref&gt;"The Universal Declaration on Volunteering", [https://www.iave.org/advocacy/the-universal-declaration-on-volunteering/ IAVE web site], accessed August 4, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual countries also created their own national IYV websites, and events were held around the world to promote the goals of IYV, such as the official launch event in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;"International Year of Volunteers in NYC; April is Volunteer Month" published at [https://web.archive.org/web/20011112013310/http://www.iyv2001.org/infobase/press/01_02_12USA.htm www.iyv2001.org], version November 12, 2001, archived at [[Internet Archive]], accessed August 3, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"International Year of Volunteering kicks off" published at [https://www.theguardian.com/society/2000/dec/06/volunteering The Guardian], version December 6, 2000, accessed August 3, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles, Prince of Wales]] unveiled the design of a 10-cent Canadian circulation coin commemorating IYV in April 2001. The coin went into circulation later that year. It was produced by [[Royal Canadian Mint]] and adapted from a photo provided by the [[March of Dimes]].&lt;ref&gt;"Prince Charles unveils the new circulation 10-cent circulation coin honouring volunteers" published at [https://web.archive.org/web/20011112011026/http://www.iyv2001.org/infobase/press/01_04_26CAN_coin.htm www.iyv2001.org], version November 12, 2001, archived at [[Internet Archive]], accessed August 3, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a press release by UNV in October 2001, lawmakers in [[France]], Germany, Spain and the UK passed pro-volunteer legislation in 2001, and new laws were proposed in Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, Madagascar, Mozambique, Nepal, Senegal and Tanzania. Also for the year, UNV and the [[Independent Sector]] released "Measuring Volunteering: A Practical Toolkit," a survey guide to measure the economic contribution of volunteering. The press release says the toolkit was adapted for use in [[Botswana]], [[China]], Lao PDR, [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Mongolia]], and that research on volunteering had begun in [[Cambodia]], [[Madagascar]], [[Namibia]], [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Tanzania]].&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;"UN Volunteer Year gains ground in fourth quarter" published at [https://web.archive.org/web/20020319124831/http://www.iyv2001.org/infobase/press/01_10_11DEU_4thQuarter_un.htm www.iyv2001.org], version March 19, 2002, archived at [[Internet Archive]], accessed August 3, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Solicited by UNV, musicians from around the world donated and wrote songs about volunteerism, submitting them to UNV for possible inclusion on the IYV2001 website and in a CD. Chosen songs were offered via the website to download for free. UNV also offered a CD with 27 songs in nine languages, by musicians from 18 countries, in celebration of IYV.  The CD featured Jamaican reggae star [[Tony Rebel]], who donated the song, "Not all about money", and Portugal's [[Paulo de Carvalho]], who donated the song "Vai e faz" (Go and Do). Most of the songs praised the virtues of volunteers, but the last song, by Dave Greenfield of Canada, was meant to provoke political debate and question social issues about volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;"Songs celebrating volunteerism" published at [https://web.archive.org/web/20020603162258/http://www.iyv2001.org/iyv_eng/world/creativity/songs/index.htm www.iyv2001.org], version June 3, 2002, archived at [[Internet Archive]], accessed August 3, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Colors of [[Benetton Group|Benetton]]'s communication campaign for autumn 2001 was produced in collaboration with UNV and honored IYV. Instead of professional models, the campaign featured photos of volunteers, such as a tattooed former member of a street gang who volunteered in anti-violence activities, a young lawyer volunteering to promote and defend human rights, a trans-gendered person who volunteered to distribute condoms amongst prostitutes, and an elderly tap dancer who entertained residents in homes for the elderly. The campaign was promoted throughout Europe, the United States, South America and parts of Asia, in newspapers, magazines, and billboards. A special issue of Benetton's magazine ''Colors'' was published for the campaign in November 2001.&lt;ref&gt;"Benetton launches new campaign in collaboration with UN Volunteers for the International Year of Volunteers" published at [https://web.archive.org/web/20011006000551/http://www.iyv2001.org/infobase/press/01_09_25DEU_benetton_un.htm www.iyv2001.org], version October 6, 2001, archived at [[Internet Archive]], accessed August 3, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;VOLUNTEERS [http://www.colorsmagazine.com/magazine/46 Colors] Issue #46, published November 2001, accessed August 5, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The final event for the year by UNV, the International Symposium on Volunteering, was 18–21 November 2001 in Geneva, Switzerland. The event was attended by representatives from most of the IYV national committees, and provided workshops to discuss the outcomes of IYV 2001.&lt;ref&gt;"Final Report" published at [http://www.icvolunteers.org/icv/files/isv2001_report_final.pdf icvolunteers.org], version April 2002, accessed August 3, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Then [[Pope John Paul II]] issued a statement on December 5, 2001, noting, "At the end of the year, that the United Nations dedicated to Volunteer work, I wish to express my heartfelt appreciation for your constant dedication, in every part of the world, in going to meet those who live in poverty. Whether you work individually or gathered together in special associations, you represent for children, the elderly, the sick, people in difficulty, refugees and the persecuted a ray of hope that pierces the darkness of solitude and encourages them to overcome the temptations of violence and egotism."&lt;ref&gt;"MESSAGE OF JOHN PAUL II

The General Assembly marked the closing of IYV on December 5, 2001 by adopting a resolution on recommendations for volunteer action, commending the ongoing contributions of all volunteers to society, and encouraging all people to become more engaged in voluntary activities. The assembly also decided that two plenary meetings at its fifty-seventh session on 5 December 2002 should be devoted to the outcome of the IYV and its follow-up.  Specific recommendations on ways governments and the UN system could support volunteering were contained in an annex to the resolution.&lt;ref&gt;"marking End of International Year of Volunteers, General Assembly Encourages All People to Become More Engaged in Voluntary Activities" published at [https://www.un.org/press/en/2001/GA9990.doc.htm United Nations], December 5, 2001, archived at [[Internet Archive]], accessed August 3, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Worldwide volunteer activities of the Vienna based NGO community were presented at the Vienna International Centre on 11 December 2001 to mark IYV 2001 and the [[International Day of Human Rights]], jointly organized by the [[United Nations Information Service Vienna]] (UNIS) and CONGO (Conference of NGOs in consultative relationship with the UN).&lt;ref&gt;"

== European Year of Volunteering ==

The European Year of Volunteering (EYV) was in 2011, launched by the [[European Commission]] to celebrate the volunteerism efforts of Europeans and chosen to correspond with the 10th anniversary of  IYV. It was originally an initiative of the EYV 2011 Alliance, an informal gathering of volunteer networks, such as [[Caritas (charity)|Caritas]], the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] and [[European Youth Forum]]. The web site address was ''www.europa.eu/volunteering'', and the site is now archived on the European Commission website.&lt;ref&gt;"European Year of Volunteering" [http://www.unric.org/en/volunteering/27163-european-year-of-volunteering United Nations Regional Information Centre for Western Europe], interview with John Macdonald, Head of Task Force for the European Year of Volunteering 2011, from the European Commission Directorate-General, accessed August 4, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;European Year of Volunteering 2011 [http://ec.europa.eu/citizenship/european-year-of-volunteering/index_en.htm European Commission, EU Citizenship Portal], accessed August 4, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== International Year of Volunteers Plus 10 ==

In 2011, ten years after IYV, under [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] Resolution 63/153 (2008)&lt;ref&gt;"General Assembly Resolution 63/153" published at [http://www.undemocracy.com/A-RES-63-153.pdf www.undemocracy.com], accessed August 3, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United Nations]] IYV+10 was recognized and promoted by UNV to renew the goals of the original IYV and to encourage people’s contributions to peace and the [[Millennium Development Goals]] through volunteering. National and international UN Volunteers, as well as [[virtual volunteering|online volunteers]], were recruited to support work on IYV+10, strengthen links with stakeholders and partners at the national level, and monitor initiatives developed during the Year. Activities were promoted via the UNV web site www.worldvolunteerweb.org. During the first half of 2011, a series of five regional consultation meetings were organized in [[Ecuador]] (28–20 March), [[Turkey]] (18–19 April), [[the Philippines]] (3–4 May), and [[Senegal]] (30–31 May for [[Francophone Africa]] and 6–7 June for Anglophone Africa). These events brought together hundreds of stakeholders from civil society, the private sector, national authorities and academia, UNV Field Units and other United Nations entities. A global conference on ‘Volunteering for a sustainable future’ was held 15–17 September in [[Budapest]] in partnership with the [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies|International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC)]] and the [http://www.iave.org/ International Association for Volunteer Effort (IAVE)]. The conference brought together UN member states and volunteer-involving organizations, plus partners from academia and the private sector. The 64th Annual UN [https://www.un.org/wcm/content/site/ngoconference DPI/NGO Conference] was held from 3–5 September hosted by the [[German government]] and the [[Bonn|city of Bonn]]. The event theme was ‘Sustainable Societies, Responsive Citizens’.

A '''late bloomer''' is a person whose talents or capabilities are not visible to others until later than usual.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yourdictionary.com/late-bloomer Yourdictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/late%20bloomer?s=t Dictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/american/late-bloomer Collinsdictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used metaphorically to describe a child or adolescent who develops slower than others in their age group, but eventually catches up and in some cases overtakes their peers, or an adult whose talent or genius in a particular field only appears later in life than is normal – in some cases only in old age.

This article discusses late-blooming children, adolescents, and adults.

==Children==

"Late Bloomer" is commonly used to refer to young children who develop skills such as language, reading, or social interaction later than others of their age.

There are many theories of the way in which children develop, proposed by authorities such as [[Urie Bronfenbrenner]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Sept05/Bronfenbrenner.ssl.html "Urie Bronfenbrenner, father of Head Start program and pre-eminent 'human ecologist,' dies at age 88"] Cornell University 26 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jerome Bruner]],&lt;ref&gt;Bruner, J. S. &amp; Goodman, C. C. (1947). Value and need as organizing factors in perception. ''Journal of Abnormal Social Psychology'', 42, 33–44.

(1977). "The essential Piaget" ed by Howard E. Gruber and J. Jacques Voneche Gruber, New York: Basic Books&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lev Vygotsky]]. Although they disagree about how stages of development should be defined, and about the primary influences on development, they agree that a child's development can be measured as a predictable series of advances in physical, intellectual and social skills which almost always occur in the same sequence, although the rate may vary from one child to another.

When a child falls behind their peers at some stage of development, their teacher may perceive that the child is "backward". There is strong evidence that this perception may become self-fulfilling: although the child catches up, the teacher may continue to rate their performance poorly, imposing a long-term handicap.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110716135424/http://www.se.rit.edu/~swami/LearningPapers/alvidrez1999TeacherPerceptions.pdf "Early Teacher Perceptions and Later Student Academic Achievement"] Journal of Educational Psychology, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Heatherton | first =  Edited by Todd F. | year = 2003 | title = The social psychology of stigma Chapter 13: Stigma and Self-Fulfilling Prophecies | isbn = 1-57230-942-3 | publisher = Guilford Press | location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Edison]]'s mind often wandered and his teacher was overheard calling him "addled."

==Adolescents==
[[File:William Butler Yeats by John Butler Yeats 1900.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of young William Butler Yeats by his father, John Butler Yeats]]
During adolescence a child goes through physical and [[Adolescent psychology|mental]] changes that lead to them becoming an adult. Adolescence is usually considered to start with the first stages of [[puberty]] and to continue until physical growth is complete, although the [[World Health Organization]] defines adolescence simply as the period between ages 10 and 20. There is a wide range of normal ages, but generally girls begin the process of puberty between the ages of 9 to 14, reaching adult height and reproductive maturity within 4 years, while boys usually start between the ages of 10 to 17, and continue to grow for about 6 years after the first visible pubertal changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Marshall | first = William A. |author2=Tanner, JM  | editor = Falkner F |editor2=Tanner JM, eds. | title = Human Growth: A Comprehensive Treatise | edition = 2nd | year = 1986 | publisher = Plenum Press | location = New York | isbn=0-306-41952-1 | pages = 171–209 | chapter =Chapter 8: Puberty}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescence is often a period of turbulent emotions and [[mood swings]] combined with rapid, intellectual development.&lt;ref name=Viner_2005&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Viner  | first = Russell  |author2=Christie, Deborah   | title = Adolescent development  | journal = British Medical Journal  | volume = 330  | issue =  7486| pages = 301–304  | date = 5 February 2005  | url = http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/330/7486/301  | doi = 10.1136/bmj.330.7486.301  | id =  | accessdate =20 June 2007  | pmid = 15695279  | pmc = 548185 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Late bloomer" can refer to children who suffer from [[delayed puberty]], who are late in reaching their full height. [[W. B. Yeats]] (age 30),&lt;ref&gt;Foster, R. F. (1997). ''W. B. Yeats: A Life, Vol. I: The Apprentice Mage''. New York: [[Oxford University Press|Oxford UP]]. {{ISBN|0-19-288085-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre Trudeau]] (age at least 28),&lt;ref&gt;''Memoirs'', by Pierre Elliott Trudeau, Toronto 1993, [[McClelland &amp; Stewart]] publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Twain]] (age 34), and [[Johann von Goethe]] (age 39) are all "late bloomers" in this last sense.

In most [[public education]]al systems, children and adolescents of the same age are put in the same classes. Because of the wide variance in the onset of adolescence, this means that one class may include individuals who have not yet started puberty, others who are [[Sexual maturity|sexually mature]] but not fully grown and yet others who are effectively adult. During this period, there is a high risk of an adolescent dropping out of formal education (due most commonly to laziness, intellectual boredom, [[bullying]], or rebellion) without having achieved their full learning potential.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ericdigests.org/1996-1/dropout.htm "Dropout Intervention and Language Minority Youth"] ERIC Digest. Retrieved 5 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The term "late-bloomer" may refer to such an individual who develops serious intellectual interests in their 20s or 30s and enrols in college, where he or she performs particularly well and subsequently establishes a professional career.

==Adults==

A late blooming adult is a person who does not discover their talents and abilities until later than normally expected. In certain cases retirement may lead to this discovery.

Although there is a common perception that intellectual development peaks in a young adult and then slowly declines with increasing age, this may be simplistic. Although the ability to form new memories and concepts may indeed diminish, the older person has the advantage of accumulated knowledge, associations between concepts, and mental techniques that may give them an advantage in some fields.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1147163-1,00.html "The Surprising Power of the Aging Brain"] ''Time'' magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

Some notable examples of late bloomers in different fields follow.

===Acting===
It was common for many actors to not get their big 'break' into the [[film industry]] until their late twenties or well into their thirties. [[Meryl Streep]] did not graduate [[Yale School of Drama]] until the age of twenty seven. The actor [[Alan Rickman]] did not begin his career until he was twenty eight, having operated a graphic-design company before then. He did not get his first real break into theatre until he was in his forties. [[Danny Aiello]] did not start acting until he was forty. [[Peg Phillips]] might be one of the best examples as she first pursued acting as a professional after her retirement from accounting; she started acting professionally in her late sixties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/local/95227_phillips12.shtml "Actress realized her dream on 'Northern Exposure'"] SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER 12 November 2002.

[[George Wendt]] who played Norm on ''Cheers'' became active at the age of thirty two. [[Brian Dennehy]] had dreams of stage and screen at an early age, but chose to first pursue other interests such as service in the U.S. Marine Corps prior to becoming active at the age of thirty eight. Irish actor [[Brendan Gleeson]], who appeared as [[Mad Eye Moody]] in the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' films and alongside [[Colin Farrell]] in ''[[In Bruges]]'', started acting professionally at thirty four, having previous work as a school teacher. The Indian (Bengali) actor [[Paran Bandopadhyay]] is another late bloomer, who started his acting career in television and films at the age of sixty, after retiring from his government job. [[Jerry Doyle]], of ''[[Babylon 5]]'' fame, did not start acting until he was thirty six after working as a stockbroker and pilot. [[Sylvester Stallone]] was thirty when he wrote and starred in the first ''[[Rocky]]''. All throughout his life, he has pushed his body through rigorous training routines for his film roles. Most notably at age forty three, he developed his now-famous ''Rambo 3'' physique which got him named as "body of the '80s". The veteran Indian (Malayalam) actor [[Sathyan (actor)|Sathyan]] started his career at the age of forty, after resigning from Police Service. He later came to be known as one of the greatest actors ever in Malayalam film industry.

===Filmmaking===
[[File:Manuel de Oliveira répondant à Antonio Tabucchi (2008.07.03)-Romanceor.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Manoel de Oliveira]]

Though many filmmakers begin directing in their late 20s or early 30s, many of the most notable directors in film history waited until their mid-to-late-30s to direct their first feature. These directors include [[Nicholas Ray]], [[Alain Resnais]], [[Edward Yang]], [[Michael Mann (director)|Michael Mann]], [[Frank Tashlin]], [[Robert Aldrich]], [[Satyajit Ray]], [[Anthony Mann]], [[Terry Gilliam]], [[Jerry Lewis]], [[Tsai Ming-liang]], [[Don Siegel]], [[Melvin Van Peebles]], [[Gaspar Noé]], [[Lloyd Bacon]], [[Alexander Kluge]], [[Mrinal Sen]], [[Jean-Marie Straub]], [[Ida Lupino]], [[Sam Mendes]], [[Alexander Payne]], [[Ang Lee]] and [[Jacques Rivette]]. [[David Mamet]] directed his first feature at 40, having already found success and been awarded a [[Pulitzer Prize]] as a playwright. [[Éric Rohmer]] directed his first feature film at 39, though he didn't become a full-time filmmaker until he was in his late 40s. 

Many notable directors started even later: [[Robert Bresson]], [[Jacques Tati]], and [[Takeshi Kitano]] directed their first features at 42; [[Maurice Pialat]] at 43; [[Michael Haneke]] at 47; [[Jim Sheridan]] at 40; and his peer and collaborator [[Terry George]] at 46. [[Yevgeni Bauer]] at 48. [[Clint Eastwood]], the oldest person to win the [[Academy Award for Best Director]], directed his first film at 41.

One of the most shining examples of late bloomers in filmmaking is the Portuguese director [[Manoel de Oliveira]]. Born in 1908, he worked sporadically in filmmaking from the 1930s. He completed his first feature film in 1941 called ''Aniki-Bobo''. Due to circumstances beyond his control (difficulty in financing, having to deal with his family's business), he did not complete his second feature film until 1971 (when he turned 63). 2 years later, he completed his third feature film, ''Benilde or the Virgin Mother'' (1973). Five years later, he made his breakthrough film (originally commissioned by Portuguese TV) called ''Doomed Love''. After his critically acclaimed film ''Francisca'' (1981), he became a full-time filmmaker (at the age of 73).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euronews.net/en/article/12/12/2008/portugals-oliveira-still-making-films-at-100 Portugal’s Oliveira – still making films at 100!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116202228/http://www.euronews.net/en/article/12/12/2008/portugals-oliveira-still-making-films-at-100/ |date=16 January 2009 }} Euronews 12 December 2008.

===Politics===
[[File:Churchill HU 90973.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Winston Churchill]], failed thrice at high school.]] 
It is common for politicians to achieve prominence late in life, often after a career in business, law or academia. For example, in the [[111th United States Congress#Members|United States Congress]] of January 2009, of 540 elected officials, 215 had worked in the legal profession, and 189 had worked in private sector business.

===Writing===
Many writers have published their first major work late in life. [[Mary Wesley]] might be a classic example.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6485">'''Multiplicity''' ({{lang-fr|multiplicité}}) is an assertion that there is more than one geo-[[historical trajectory]]. It is a philosophical concept developed by [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Henri Bergson]] from [[Bernhard Riemann|Riemann]]'s description of the [[Multiplicity (mathematics)|mathematical concept]].&lt;ref&gt;"It was Riemann in the field of physics and mathematics who dreamed about the notion of 'multiplicity' and other different kinds of multiplicities. The philosophical importance of this notion then appeared in Husserl's ''Formal and Transcendental Logic'', as well as in Bergson's ''Essay on the Immediate Given of Awareness''" (Deleuze 1986, 13).&lt;/ref&gt; It forms an important part of the philosophy of [[Gilles Deleuze]], particularly in his collaboration with [[Félix Guattari]], ''[[Capitalism and Schizophrenia]]'' (1972–80). In his ''Foucault'' (1986), Deleuze describes [[Michel Foucault]]'s ''[[The Archaeology of Knowledge]]'' (1969) as "the most decisive step yet taken in the theory-practice of multiplicities."&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze (1986, 14).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

The philosopher Jonathan Roffe describes Deleuze's concept of Multiplicity as follows: "A  multiplicity  is,  in  the  most  basic  sense,  a  complex  structure  that does not reference a prior unity. Multiplicities are not parts of a greater whole that have been fragmented, and they cannot be considered manifold expressions of a single concept or transcendent unity. On these grounds, Deleuze opposes the dyad One/Many, in all of its forms, with multiplicity. Further, he insists that the crucial point is to consider multiplicity in its substantive form – a multiplicity – rather than as an adjective – as multiplicity of something. Everything for Deleuze is a multiplicity in this fashion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Deleuze Dictionary: the revised edition|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deleuze argues in his commentary ''Bergsonism'' (1966) that the notion of multiplicity forms a central part of Bergson's critique of philosophical [[Negativity (philosophy)|negativity]] and the [[dialectic]]al method. The theory of multiplicities, he explains, must be distinguished from traditional philosophical problems of "the One and the Multiple."&lt;ref&gt;"Multiplicity remains completely indifferent to the traditional problems of the multiple and the one, and above all to the problem of a subject who would think through this multiplicity, give it conditions, account for its origins, and so on. There is neither one nor multiple, which would at all events entail having recourse to a consciousness that would be regulated by the one and developed by the other" (Deleuze 1986, 14).&lt;/ref&gt; By opposing "the One and the Multiple," dialectical philosophy claims "to reconstruct the real," but this claim is false, Bergson argues, since it "involves abstract concepts that are much too general."&lt;ref&gt;See Deleuze (1966, 38-47); The dialectical method "compensates for the inadequacy of a concept that is too broad or too general by invoking the opposite concept, which is no less broad and general [. . .]. The concrete will never be attained by combining the inadequacy of one concept with the inadequacy of its opposite. The singular will never be attained by correcting a generality with another generality" (Deleuze 1966, 44).&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of referring to "the Multiple in general", Bergson's theory of multiplicities distinguishes between two types of multiplicity: continuous multiplicities and discrete multiplicities (a distinction that he developed from [[Bernhard Riemann|Riemann]]).&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze (1966, 39).&lt;/ref&gt; The features of this distinction may be tabulated as follows:

In [[Dvaita]] [[theology]], '''Nitya-samsarins''', as classified by [[Shri Madhvacharya]], are [[soul]]s which are [[eternity|eternally]] [[reincarnation|transmigrating]].

Madhva divides souls into three classes: one class of souls which qualify for liberation ([[Mukti-yogyas]]), another subject to eternal rebirth or eternal transmigration (Nitya-samsarins), and a third class that is eventually condemned to eternal [[hell]] or [[Andhatamas]] ([[Tamo-yogyas]]).&lt;ref&gt;Tapasyananda, Swami.  ''Bhakti Schools of Vedanta'' pg. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nitya-samsarins delight only in [[worldliness|worldly]] [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]]s and feel no need for [[ethics|ethical]] and [[Spirituality|spiritual]] life. By reaping the fruits of their own actions, they pass through continuous [[birth]]s and [[death]]s eternally.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="49305">'''Oppression''' can refer to an authoritarian regime controlling its citizens via state control of politics, the monetary system, media, and the military; denying people any meaningful human or civil rights; and terrorizing the populace through harsh, unjust punishment, and a hidden network of obsequious informants reporting to a vicious secret police force. 

Oppression also refers to a less overtly malicious pattern of subjugation, although in many ways this social oppression represents a particularly insidious and ruthlessly effective form of manipulation and control. In this instance, the subordination and injustices do not afflict everyone—instead it targets specific groups of people for restrictions, ridicule, and marginalization. No universally accepted term has yet emerged to describe this variety of oppression, although some scholars will parse the multiplicity of factors into a handful of categories, e.g., social (or sociocultural) oppression; institutional (or legal) oppression; and [[economic oppression]].

==Authoritarian oppression==
The word ''oppress ''comes from the Latin ''oppressus'', past participle of ''opprimere'', ("to press against",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=oppress|title=American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|last=|first=|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year=2016|isbn=9780544454453|edition=5th|location=|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171125135556/https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=oppress|archivedate=2017-11-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "to squeeze", "to suffocate").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.kdictionaries-online.com/DictionaryPage.aspx?ApplicationCode=18#&amp;&amp;DictionaryEntry=oppress&amp;SearchMode=Entry|title=Random House Kernerman Webster's College Dictionary|last=|first=|publisher=K Dictionaries Ltd, by arrangement with Random House Information Group, an imprint of The Crown Publishing Group, a division of Random House, Inc.|year=2010|isbn=|edition=Revised &amp; Updated|location=|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006084452/http://www.kdictionaries-online.com/DictionaryPage.aspx?ApplicationCode=18#&amp;&amp;DictionaryEntry=oppress&amp;SearchMode=Entry|archivedate=2014-10-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, when [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian governments]] use oppression to subjugate the people, they want their citizenry to feel that "pressing down", and to live in fear that if they displease the authorities they will, in a metaphorical sense, be "squeezed" and "suffocated", e.g., thrown in a dank, dark, state prison or summarily executed. Such governments oppress the people using restriction, control, terror, hopelessness, and despair.{{efn|This description of authoritarian governments is somewhat simplistic in that it describes the epitome of authoritarianism, i.e., the worst-case scenario, which still exists in some countries today, but has gradually become less prevalent over the last two centuries or so. See the five books cited at the end of this paragraph for a more nuanced discussion. Also see the Wikipedia article, [[Authoritarianism]].}} The tyrant's tools of oppression include, for example, extremely harsh punishments for "unpatriotic" statements; developing a loyal, guileful [[secret police]] force; prohibiting [[freedom of assembly]], [[freedom of speech]], and [[freedom of the press]]; controlling the monetary system and economy; and imprisoning or killing activists or other leaders who might pose a threat to their power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Competitive Authoritarianism: Hybrid Regimes after the Cold War|last=Levitsky|first=Steven|last2=Way|first2=Lucan A.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780521882521|oclc=968631692|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/968631692|location=New York City, NY|pages=5–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/967148718|title=Non-democratic politics : authoritarianism, dictatorship, and democratization|last=Xavier|first=Márquez|year=2017|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|pages=1–21; 39–61; 130–141|isbn=9781137486318|location=London|oclc=967148718}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/340983053|title=Democracy and authoritarianism in the post-communist world|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|last=Bunce|first=Valerie|last2=McFaul|first2=Michael|last3=Stoner|first3=Kathryn|isbn=9780521115988|location=Cambridge, England (UK)|oclc=340983053}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/191465180|title=The Protestant ethic and the spirit of authoritarianism: Puritanism, democracy, and society|last=Zafirovski|first=Milan|date=2007|pages=15–18|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media|isbn=9780387493206|location=New York City, NY|oclc=191465180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/607553768|title=The new authoritarianism in the Middle East and North Africa|last=King|first=Stephen J.|date=2009|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=9780253353979|location=Bloomington, IN|oclc=607553768}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socioeconomic, political, legal, cultural, and institutional oppression==
Oppression also refers to a more insidious type of manipulation and control, in this instance involving the subjugation and marginalization of specific groups of people within a country or society, such as: [[Women's rights|girls and women]], [[Misandry|boys and men]], [[Person of color|people of color]], [[Minority religion|religious communities]], [[Poverty|citizens in poverty]], [[LGBT history|LGBT people]], [[youth rights|youth and children]], and many more. This [[Social class|socioeconomic]], cultural, political, legal, and institutional oppression (hereinafter, "social oppression") probably occurs in every country, culture, and society, including the most advanced [[Democracy|democracies]], such as the United States, Japan, Costa Rica, Sweden, and Canada.{{efn|This list of countries is mostly arbitrary, and is meant only to illustrate what is meant by "advanced democracies".}}{{efn|The terms [[Representative democracy|representative democracies]], [[Republic|republics]], or [[Democratic republic|democratic republics]] could also be used instead of [[Democracy|democracies]]. The four Wikipedia articles linked to in the previous sentence discuss the similarities and differences between and amongst the four related terms.}}

A single, widely accepted definition of social oppression does not yet exist, although there are commonalities. Taylor (2016)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Taylor|first=Elanor|year=2016|title=Groups and Oppression|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hypa.12252/abstract|journal=Hypatia|volume=31|issue=3|pages=520–536|doi=10.1111/hypa.12252|issn=1527-2001|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160829135247/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hypa.12252/abstract|archivedate=2016-08-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; defined (social) oppression in this way:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Oppression is a form of injustice that occurs when one social group is subordinated while another is privileged, and oppression is maintained by a variety of different mechanisms including social norms, stereotypes and institutional rules. A key feature of oppression is that it is perpetrated by and affects social groups. ... [Oppression]  occurs when a particular social group is unjustly subordinated, and where that subordination is not necessarily deliberate but instead results from a complex network of social restrictions, ranging from laws and institutions to implicit biases and stereotypes. In such cases, there may be no deliberate attempt to subordinate the relevant group, but the group is nonetheless unjustly subordinated by this network of social constraints.{{sfn|Taylor|2016|pp=520-521}} &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Harvey (1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41528208|title=Civilized oppression|first=Jean|last=Harvey|date=1999|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|pages=1–2|isbn=978-0847692743|location=Lanham|oclc=41528208}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested the term "civilized oppression", which he introduced as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is harder still to become aware of what I call 'civilized Oppression,' that involves neither physical violence nor the use of law. Yet these subtle forms are by far the most prevalent in Western industrialized societies. This work will focus on issues that are common to such subtle oppression in several different contexts (such as racism, classism, and sexism) ... Analyzing what is involved in civilized oppression includes analyzing the kinds of mechanisms used, the power relations at work, the systems controlling perceptions and information, the kinds of harms inflicted on the victims, and the reasons why this oppression is so hard to see even by contributing agents.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Research and theory development on social oppression has advanced apace since the 1980s with the publication of seminal books and articles,{{efn|see "General references (seminal works)" below.}} and the cross-pollination of ideas and discussion among diverse disciplines, such as: feminism, sociology, psychology, philosophy, and political science. Nonetheless, more fully understanding the problem remains an extremely complicated challenge for scholars. Improved understanding will likely involve, for example, comprehending more completely the historical antecedents of current social oppression; the commonalities (and lack thereof) among the various social groups damaged by social oppression (and the individual human beings who make up those groups); and the complex interplay between and amongst sociocultural, political, economic, psychological, and legal forces that cause and support oppression.

==Social oppression==
Social oppression is when a single group in society takes advantage of, and exercises power over, another group using dominance and subordination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Political Sociology: Oppression, Resistance, and the State|last=Glasberg, Shannon|first=Davita, Deric|publisher=Sage Publication Inc|year=2011|isbn=9781452238081|location=United States of America|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This results in the socially supported mistreatment and exploitation of a group of individuals by those with relative power.&lt;ref&gt;Van Wormer, K., &amp; Besthorn, F. H. (2010). ''Human behavior and the social environment, macro level: Groups, communities, and organizations''. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In a social group setting, oppression may be based on many ideas, such as poverty, gender, class, race, or other categories. Oppression by institution, or systematic oppression, is when the laws of a place create unequal treatment of a specific social identity group or groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=|title=Institutionalized Oppression Definitions|last=Cheney|first=Carol|last2=LeFrance|first2=Jeannie|date=2006|website=Act for Action|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|last3=Quinteros|first3=Terrie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of social oppression is when a specific social group is denied access to education that may hinder their lives in later life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Justice and the Politics of Difference|last=Young|first=Iris|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1990|isbn=|location=|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic oppression is the divide between two classes of society. These were once determined by factors such slavery, property rights, disenfranchisement, and forced displacement of livelihood. Each divide yielded various treatments and attitudes towards each group.

Social oppression derives from power dynamics and imbalances related to the social location of a group or individual. [[Social location]], as defined by Lynn Weber, is "an individual's or a group's social 'place' in the race, class, gender and sexuality hierarchies, as well as in other critical social hierarchies such as age, ethnicity, and nation".&lt;ref name=Weber&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding Race, Class, Gender, and Sexuality: A Conceptual Framework|last=Weber|first=Lynn|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-19-538024-8|edition=2nd|location=New York|pages=|oclc=699188746}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}} An individual's social location often determines how they will be perceived and treated by others in society. Three elements shape whether a group or individual can exercise power: the power to design or manipulate the rules and regulations, the capacity to win competitions through the exercise of political or economic force, and the ability to write and document social and political history.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, S. J. (Ed.). (2015). ''Race, Gender, Sexuality, and Social Class: Dimensions of Inequality and Identity''. SAGE Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;. There are four predominant social hierarchies, race, class, gender and sexuality, that contribute to social oppression.

===Privilege===
Weber,&lt;ref name="Weber"/&gt; among some other political theorists, argues that oppression persists because most individuals fail to recognize it; that is, discrimination is often not visible to those who are not in the midst of it. [[Privilege (social inequality)|Privilege]] refers to a sociopolitical immunity one group has over others derived from particular societal benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/privilege|title=Definition of PRIVILEGE|last=|first=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170920143749/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/privilege|archive-date=2017-09-20|dead-url=no|access-date=2017-11-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the groups who have privilege over gender, race, or sexuality, for example, can be unaware of the power their privilege holds. These inequalities further perpetuate themselves because those who are oppressed rarely have access to resources that would allow them to escape their maltreatment. This can lead to [[internalized oppression]], where subordinate groups essentially give up the fight to get access to equality, and accept their fate as a non-dominant group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Freibach-Heifetz|first1=Dana|last2=Stopler|first2=Gila|date=June 2008|title=On conceptual dichotomies and social oppression|journal=Philosophy and Social Criticism|volume=34|issue=5|pages=515–35|doi=10.1177/0191453708089197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Racial oppression===
The first social hierarchy is race or racial oppression, which is defined as: " ... burdening a specific race with unjust or cruel restraints or impositions. Racial oppression may be social, systematic, institutionalized, or internalized. Social forms of racial oppression include exploitation and mistreatment that is socially supported."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reference.com/world-view/racial-oppression-bacab47f0ce758d|title=What is Racial Oppression?|last=|first=|date=|website=Reference|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425024203/https://www.reference.com/world-view/racial-oppression-bacab47f0ce758d|archive-date=2017-04-25|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; United States history consists of five primary forms of racial oppression including genocide and geographical displacement, slavery, second-class citizenship, non-citizen labor, and diffuse racial discrimination.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Blauner, B. (1972). ''Racial oppression in America''. Harpercollins College Div.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first, primary form of racial oppression—[[genocide]] and [[Forced displacement|geographical displacement]]—in the US context refers to [[Western Europe]] and settlers taking over an Indigenous population's land. Many Indigenous people, commonly known today as [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], were relocated to [[Indian Reservation]]s or killed during wars fought over the land. The second form of racial oppression, [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]], refers to [[Africans]] being taken from their homeland and sold as property to [[white Americans]]. Racial oppression, particularly in the [[Southern United States]], was a significant part of daily life and routine in which African-Americans worked on plantations and did other labor without pay and the freedom to leave their workplace. The third form of racial oppression, [[second-class citizen]]ship, refers to some categories of citizens having fewer rights than others. Second-class citizenship became a pivotal form of racial oppression in the United States following the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], as African-Americans who were formerly enslaved continued to be considered unequal to white citizens, and had no voting rights. Moreover, immigrants and foreign workers in the US are also treated like second-class citizens, with fewer rights than people born in the US. The fourth form of racial oppression in American history, non-citizen labor, refers to the linkage of race and legal citizenship status. During the middle of the 19th century, some categories of immigrants, such as Mexicans and Chinese, were sought as physical laborers, but were nonetheless denied legal access to citizenship status. The last form of racial oppression in American history is diffuse discrimination. This form of racial oppression refers to discriminatory actions that are not directly backed by the legal powers of the state, but take place in widespread everyday social interactions. This can include employers not hiring or promoting someone on the basis of race, landlords only renting to people of certain racial groups, salespeople treating customers differently based on race, and racialized groups having access only to impoverished schools. Even after the civil rights legislation abolishing segregation, racial oppression is still a reality in the United States. According to Robert Blauner, author of ''Racial Oppression in America'', "racial groups and racial oppression are central features of the American social dynamic".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
[[File:Crying eye.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Pencil drawing of a crying eye.|"crying eye" (pencil drawing)]]

===Class oppression===
The second social hierarchy, class oppression, sometimes referred to as classism, can be defined as prejudice and discrimination based on social class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/classism|title=Definition of CLASSISM|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-24|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425024521/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/classism|archivedate=2017-04-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Class is an unspoken social ranking based on income, wealth, education, status, and power. A class is a large group of people who share similar economic or social positions based on their income, wealth, property ownership, job status, education, skills, and power in the economic and political sphere. The most commonly used class categories include: upper class, middle class, working class, and poor class. A majority of people in the United States self-identify in surveys as middle class, despite vast differences in income and status. Class is also experienced differently depending on race, gender, ethnicity, global location, disability, and more. Class oppression of the poor and working class can lead to deprivation of basic needs and a feeling of inferiority to higher-class people, as well as shame towards one's traditional class, race, gender, or ethnic heritage. In the United States, class has become racialized leaving the greater percentage of people of color living in poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.classism.org/about-class/|title=Class Action   » About Class|website=www.classism.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-24|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703001452/http://www.classism.org/about-class/|archivedate=2017-07-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since class oppression is universal among the majority class in American society, at times it can seem invisible, however, it is a relevant issue that causes suffering for many.

===Gender oppression===
{{refimprove section|date=November 2017}}
The third social hierarchy is gender oppression, which is instituted through gender norms society has adopted. In some cultures today, gender norms suggest that masculinity and femininity are opposite genders, however it is an unequal binary pair, with masculinity being dominant and femininity being subordinate. Gender as such is not natural but socially constructed, and gendered power differences provide social mechanisms that benefit masculinity. "Many have argued that cultural practices concerning gender norms of child care, housework, appearance, and career impose an unfair burden on women and as such are oppressive."{{cn|date=November 2017}} According to feminist Barbara Cattunar, women have always been "subjected to many forms of oppression, backed up by religious texts which insist upon women's inferiority and subjugation".{{cn|date=November 2017}} Femininity has always been looked down upon, perpetuated by socially constructed stereotypes, which has affected women's societal status and opportunity. In current society, sources like the media further impose gendered oppression as they shape societal views. Females in pop-culture are objectified and sexualized, which can be understood as degrading to women by depicting them as sex objects with little regard for their character, political views, cultural contributions, creativity or intellect. Feminism, or struggles for women's cultural, political and economic equality, has challenged gender oppression. Gender oppression also takes place against trans, gender-non-conforming, gender queer, or non-binary individuals who do not identify with binary categories of masculine/feminine or male/female.

===Age oppression===
Young people are a commonly, yet rarely acknowledged, oppressed demographic. Minors are denied many democratic and human [[rights]], including the rights to [[vote]], [[marry]], and give [[sexual consent]]. Society as a whole also tends to [[discrimination|discriminate]] against young people and view them as inferior.&lt;ref&gt;[http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1978-00956-000]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexuality oppression===
{{refimprove section|date=November 2017}}
The fourth social hierarchy is sexuality oppression or [[heterosexism]]. Dominant societal views with respect to sexuality, and sex partner selection, have formed a sexuality hierarchy oppressing people who do not conform to [[heteronormativity]]. Heteronormativity is an underlying assumption that everyone in society is heterosexual, and those who are not are treated as different or even abnormal by society, excluded, oppressed, and sometimes subject to violence. Heterosexism also derives from societal views of the nuclear family which is presumed to be heterosexual, and dominated or controlled by the male partner. Social actions by oppressed groups such as [[LGBT]]QI movements have organized to create social change.

=== Religious Persecution ===
[[File:P religion world.svg|thumb|Different types of religious symbols]]
Religious persecution is the systematic mistreatment of an individual because of their religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.definitions.net/definition/religious+persecution|title=What does religious persecution mean?|website=www.definitions.net|language=en|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Iris Young oppression can be divided into different categories such as powerlessness, exploitation, and violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Justice and the Politics of Difference|last=Young|first=Iris|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1990|isbn=0691078327|location=|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first category of powerlessness in regards to religious persecution is when a group of people that follow one religion have less power than the dominant religious followers. An example of powerlessness would be during the 17th century when the pilgrims, wanting to escape the [[Church of England]] came to what is now called the [[United States]]. The pilgrims created their own religion of [[Protestantism]], and after doing so they eventually passed laws to keep other religions from prospering.  The Protestants used their power of legislature to oppress the other religions in the United States. &lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blumenfeld|first=Warren|date=|title=Christian Privilege and the Promotion of "Secular" and Not-So "Secular" Mainline Christianity in Public Schooling and in the Larger Society|url=|journal=Equity and Excellence in Education|volume=39|pages=|via=Ebscohost}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second category of oppression: exploitation, has been seen in many different forms around the world when it comes to religion. The definition of exploitation is the action or fact of treating someone unfairly in order to benefit from their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/exploitation|title=exploitation {{!}} Definition of exploitation in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example during the [[American Civil War]], white Americans used Chinese immigrants in order to build the [[Transcontinental railroad|transcontinental railroads.]] During this time it was common for the Chinese immigrants to follow the religions of [[Buddhism]], [[Taoism]], and [[Confucianism]], because of this the Chinese were looked at as different and not equal to the white Americans. Due to this view it led them to unequal pay, and many hardships during their time working on the railroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uscitizenship.info/Chinese-immigration-and-the-Transcontinental-railroad/|title=Chinese immigration and the Transcontinental railroad|website=www.uscitizenship.info|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third category that can be seen in religious persecution is violence. According to the Merriam Webster dictionary violence is "the use of physical force so as to injure, abuse, damage, or destroy". An example of violence in regards to religious persecution is hate crimes that occur in the United States against Muslims. Sense [[September 11 attacks|September 11th, 2001]] hate crimes against people of the Muslim faith have greatly increased. One incident occurred on August 5th, 2017 when three men bombed a [[Mosque]] because they felt that Muslims "'push their beliefs on everyone else'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/13/us/minnesota-mosque-bombing-suspects.html|title=3 Suspects in Bombing of Minnesota Mosque Face Weapons Charges|access-date=2018-11-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This violence happens to not only muslims but other religions as well.

===Domination===
{{refimprove section|date=November 2017}}
Addressing social oppression on both a macro and micro level, feminist [[Patricia Hill Collins]] discusses her "[[matrix of domination]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment|last=Collins|first=Patricia Hill|publisher=Routledge|year=2000|isbn=978-0-415-92483-2|edition=2nd|location=New York|page=295|oclc=491072106|author-link=Patricia Hill Collins}}&lt;/ref&gt; The matrix of domination discusses the interrelated nature of four domains of power, including the structural, disciplinary, [[hegemony|hegemonic]], and interpersonal domains. Each of these spheres works to sustain current inequalities that are faced by marginalized, excluded or oppressed groups. The structural, disciplinary and hegemonic domains all operate on a macro level, creating social oppression through macro structures such as education, or the criminal justice system, which play out in the interpersonal sphere of everyday life through micro-oppressions.

[[Standpoint theory]] can help us to understand the interpersonal domain. Standpoint theory deals with an individual's social location in that each person will have a very different perspective based on where they are positioned in society. For instance, a white male living in America will have a very different take on an issue such as abortion than a black female living in Africa. Each will have different knowledge claims and experiences that will have shaped how they perceive abortion. Standpoint theory is often used to expose the powerful social locations of those speaking, to justify claims of knowledge through closer experience of an issue, and to deconstruct the construction of knowledge of oppression by oppressors.

===Institutionalized oppression===
"Institutional Oppression occurs when established laws, customs, and practices systemically reflect and produce inequities based on one's membership in targeted social identity groups. If oppressive consequences accrue to institutional laws, customs, or practices, the institution is oppressive whether or not the individuals maintaining those practices have oppressive intentions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcc.edu/resources/illumination/documents/institutionalized-oppression-definitions.pdf |title=Institutionalized Oppression Definitions |format=PDF |last1=Cheney |first1=Carol |last2=LaFrance |first2=Jeannie |last3=Quinteros |first3=Terrie |date=25 August 2006 |website=The Illumination Project |publisher=Portland Community College |accessdate=2012-08-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907023850/http://www.pcc.edu/resources/illumination/documents/institutionalized-oppression-definitions.pdf |archivedate=7 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Flickr - USCapitol - The Monroe Doctrine, 1823.jpg|thumb|alt=Painting representing the Monroe Doctrine, and a quote about oppression by President Franklin D. Roosevelt|U.S. Capitol - oil painting by Allyn Cox - The Monroe Doctrine (1823), plus a quote from President Franklin D. Roosevelt (1940). (photograph: Architect of the Capitol)]]

Institutionalized oppression allows for government organizations and their employees to systematically favor specific groups of people based upon group identity. Dating back to colonization, the United States implemented the institution of slavery where Africans were brought to the United States to be a source of free labor to expand the cotton and tobacco industry.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seabrook|first=Renita|last2=Wyatt-Nichol|first2=Heather|date=|title=The Ugly Side of America: Institutional Oppression and Race|url=|journal=Journal of Public Management &amp; Social Policy|volume=23|pages=1–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Implementing these systems by the United States government was justified through religious grounding where "servants [were] bought and established as inheritable property".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Although the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth amendments freed African Americans, gave them citizenship, and provided them the right to vote, institutions such as some police departments continue to use oppressive systems against minorities. They train their officers to profile individuals based upon their racial heritage, and to exert excessive force to restrain them. [[Racial profiling]] and [[police brutality]] are "employed to control a population thought to be undesirable, undeserving, and under punished by established law".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Above the Law: Police and the Excessive Use of Force|last=Skolnick|first=Jerome H.|last2=Fyfe|first2=James J.|publisher=|year=1994|isbn=|location=New York|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both situations, police officers "rely on legal authority to exonerate their extralegal use of force; both respond to perceived threats and fears aroused by out-groups, especially— but not exclusively— racial minorities".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For example, "blacks are: approximately four times more likely to be targeted for police use of force than their white counterparts; arrested and convicted for drug-related criminal activities at higher rates than their overall representation in the U.S. population; and are more likely to fear unlawful and harsh treatment by law enforcement officials".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The International Association of Chiefs of Police collected data from police departments between the years 1995 and 2000 and found that 83% of incidents involving use-of-force against subjects of different races than the officer executing it involved a white officer and a black subject.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Institutionalized oppression is not only experienced by people of racial minorities, but can also affect those in the LGBT community. Oppression of the LGBT community in the United States dates back to President Eisenhower's presidency where he passed [[Executive Order 10450]] in April 1953 which permitted non-binary sexual behaviors to be investigated by federal agencies.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Law and the Gay Rights Story : The Long Search for Equal Justice in a Divided Democracy|last=Walker|first=Frank|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this order, "More than 800 federal employees resigned or were terminated in the two years following because their files linked them in some way with homosexuality."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Oppression of the LGBT community continues today through some religious systems and their believers' justifications of discrimination based upon their own freedom of religious belief. States such as Arizona and Kansas passed laws in 2014 giving religious-based businesses "the right to refuse service to LGBT customers".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Violence against Queer People : Race, Class, Gender, and the Persistence of Anti-LGBT Discrimination|last=Meyer|first=Doug|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (EDNA) offers full protection of LGBT workers from job discrimination; however, the act does not offer protection against religious-based corporations and businesses, ultimately allowing the LGBT community to be discriminated against in environments such as churches and religious-based hospitals.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The LGBT community is further oppressed by the United States government with the passage of the [[First Amendment Defense Act]] which states, "Protecting religious freedom from Government intrusion is a Government interest of the highest order."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/1598/text|title=S.1598 - First Amendment Defense Act|last=Lee|first=Mike|date=June 2015|website=Congress.gov|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170608160625/https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/1598/text|archive-date=2017-06-08|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This act essentially allows for institutions of any kind—schools, businesses, hospitals—to deny service to people based upon their sexuality because it goes against a religious belief.

===Economic oppression===
The term economic oppression changes in meaning and significance over time, depending on its contextual application. In today's context, economic oppression may take several forms, including, but not limited to: the practice of [[bonded labour]] in some parts of India, [[serfdom]], [[Unfree labour|forced labour]], low wages, denial of [[equal opportunity]], and practicing employment discrimination, and economic discrimination based on sex, nationality, race, and religion.&lt;ref&gt;Kirst-Ashman, K. K., &amp; Hull, G. H. (2012). Understanding Generalist Practice. Belmont, CA: Brooks/Cole, Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ann Cudd]] describes the main forces of economic oppression as oppressive economic systems and direct and indirect forces. Even though capitalism and socialism are not inherently oppressive, they "lend themselves to oppression in characteristic ways".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Cudd, Ann E. (2006). Analyzing Oppression. Oxford University Press US. {{ISBN|0-19-518744-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She defines direct forces of economic oppression as "restrictions on opportunities that are applied from the outside on the oppressed, including enslavement, segregation, employment discrimination, group-based harassment, opportunity inequality, [[neocolonialism]], and governmental corruption". This allows for a dominant social group to maintain and maximize its wealth through the intentional exploitation of economically inferior subordinates. With indirect forces (also known as oppression by choice), "the oppressed are co-opted into making individual choices that add to their own oppression". The oppressed are faced with having to decide to go against their social good, and even against their own good. If they choose otherwise, they have to choose against their interests, which may lead to resentment by their group.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

An example of direct forces of economic oppression is [[employment discrimination]] in the form of the [[gender pay gap]]. Restrictions on women's access to and participation in the workforce like the wage gap is an "inequality most identified with industrialized nations with nominal equal opportunity laws; legal and cultural restrictions on access to education and jobs, inequities most identified with developing nations; and unequal access to capital, variable but identified as a difficulty in both industrialized and developing nations".&lt;ref name="Mupepi, Mambo 2016"&gt;Mupepi, Mambo (Ed.). (2016). Effective Talent Management Strategies for Organizational Success. Hershey: Business Science Reference. {{ISBN|1522519610}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the median weekly earnings for women were 82 percent of the median weekly earnings for men in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, The Economics Daily, "Women's median earnings 82 percent of men's in 2016. https://www.bls.gov {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171123041856/https://www.bls.gov/ |date=2017-11-23 }} (visited April 21, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue women are prevented from achieving complete gender equality in the workplace because of the "ideal-worker norm," which "defines the committed worker as someone who works full-time and full force for forty years straight," a situation designed for the male sex.&lt;ref name="Mupepi, Mambo 2016"/&gt; 

Women, in contrast, are still expected to fulfill the caretaker role and take time off for domestic needs such as pregnancy and ill family members, preventing them from conforming to the "ideal-worker norm". With the current norm in place, women are forced to juggle full-time jobs and family care at home.&lt;ref&gt;Kinnear, Karen L. (2011). Women in Developing Countries: a Reference Handbook. ABC-Clio. {{ISBN|9781598844252}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Others believe that this difference in wage earnings is likely due to the supply and demand for women in the market because of family obligations.&lt;ref&gt;Magnusson, Charlotta.  (2010). "Why Is There A Gender Wage Gap According To Occupational Prestige?" Acta Sociologica (Sage Publications, Ltd.) 53.2: 99-117. Academic Search Complete.&lt;/ref&gt; Eber and Weichselbaumer argue that "over time, raw wage differentials worldwide have fallen substantially. Most of this decrease is due to better labor market endowments of females".&lt;ref&gt;Weichselbaumer, D. and Winter-Ebmer, R. (2005). A Meta-Analysis of the International Gender Wage Gap. Journal of Economic Surveys, 19: 479–511. Doi: 10.1111/j.0950-0804.2005.00256.x&lt;/ref&gt;

Indirect economic oppression is exemplified when individuals work abroad to support their families. [[Outsourcing|Outsourced]] employees, working abroad generally little to no bargaining power not only with their employers, but with immigration authorities as well. They could be forced to accept low wages and work in poor living conditions. And by working abroad, an outsourced employee contributes to the economy of a foreign country instead of their own. Veltman and Piper describe the effects of outsourcing on female laborers abroad:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Her work may be oppressive first in respects of being [[Heteronomy|heteronomous]]: she may enter work under conditions of constraint; her work may bear no part of reflectively held life goals; and she may not even have the: freedom of bodily movement at work. Her work may also fail to permit a meaningful measure of economic independence or to help her support herself or her family, which she identifies as the very purpose of her working.&lt;ref&gt;Veltman, A., &amp; Piper, M. (Eds.). (2014). Autonomy, Oppression, and Gender. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By deciding to work abroad, laborers are "reinforcing the forces of economic oppression that presented them with such poor options".&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;

===Feminism and Equal Rights===
[[File:No Chains Woman.png|thumb|upright|left|alt=Image of a woman breaking free of chains.|A woman breaking free of chains.]]Although a relatively modern form of resistance, feminism's origins can be traced back to the events leading up to the introduction of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] (ERA) in 1923. While the ERA was created to address the need for equal protection under the law between men and women in the workplace, it spurred increased feminism that has come to represent the search for equal opportunity and respect for women in patriarchal societies, across all social, cultural, and political spheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=5771e8ef-9026-4070-a19b-3afe0237ba52%40sessionmgr120&amp;vid=12&amp;hid=117|title=Equality, Sameness, Difference: Revisiting the Equal Rights Amendment|last=Chávez|first=Karma|last2=Nair|first2=Yasmin|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|last3=Conrad|first3=Ryan|author-last##=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demonstrations and marches have been a popular medium of support, with the January 21, 2017, [[2017 Women's March|Women's March]]'s replication in major cities across the world drawing tens of thousands of supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2017/01/21/womens-march-photos/|title=Women's March|last=Nusca|first=Andrew|date=January 21, 2017|work=Fortune|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424085625/http://fortune.com/2017/01/21/womens-march-photos/|archive-date=2017-04-24|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminists' main talking points consist of women's reproductive rights, the closing of the pay gap between men and women, the [[glass ceiling]] and workplace discrimination, and the [[intersectionality]] of feminism with other major issues such as African-American rights, immigration freedoms, and gun violence.

==="Resistance"===
Resistance to oppression has been linked to a moral obligation, an act deemed necessary for the preservation of self and society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hay|first=Carol|date=|title=The Obligation to Resist Oppression|url=|journal=Journal of Social Philosophy|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, resistance to oppression has been largely overlooked in terms of the amount of research and number of studies completed on the topic, and therefore, is often largely misinterpreted as "lawlessness, belligerence, envy, or laziness".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cudd|first=Ann|date=|title=Strikes, Housework, and the Moral Obligation to Resist|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the last two centuries, resistance movements have risen that specifically aim to oppose, analyze, and counter various types of oppression, as well as to increase public awareness and support of groups marginalized and disadvantaged by systematic oppression. Late 20th century resistance movements such as [[liberation theology]] and [[anarchism]] set the stage for mass critiques of, and resistance to, forms of social and institutionalized oppression that have been subtly enforced and reinforced over time. Resistance movements of the 21st century have furthered the missions of activists across the world, and movements such as [[liberalism]], [[Black Lives Matter]] (related: [[Blue Lives Matter]], [[All Lives Matter]]) and [[feminism]] (related: [[Meninism]]) are some of the most prominent examples of resistance to oppression today.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3361">'''Pattern-oriented modeling''' ('''POM''') is an approach to bottom-up [[complex systems]] [[Systems analysis|analysis]] that was developed to [[Systems modeling|model]] complex ecological and [[agent-based model|agent-based]] systems. A goal of POM is to make ecological modeling more rigorous and comprehensive.&lt;ref name="IndividualBasedModelingAndEcology"&gt;Grimm, V.; Railsback  S.F. (2005), ''Individual-based Modeling and Ecology'', [[Princeton University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A traditional ecosystem model attempts to approximate the real system as closely as possible. POM proponents posit that an ecosystem is so information-rich that an ecosystem model will inevitably either leave out relevant information or become over-parameterized and lose predictive power.&lt;ref name="PatternOrientedModelingOfAgentBasedComplexSystems"&gt;Grimm, V.; Revilla, E.; Berger, U.; Jeltsch, F.; Mooij, W.M.; Railsback, S.F.; Thulke, H.H.; Weiner, J. Wiegand, T.; DeAngelis D.L. (2005), "Pattern-oriented modeling of agent-based complex systems: lessons from ecology", ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', 310: 987-991&lt;/ref&gt; Through a focus on only the relevant patterns in the real system, POM offers a meaningful alternative to the traditional approach. 

An attempt to mimic the [[scientific method]], POM requires the researcher to begin with a pattern found in the real system, posit hypotheses to explain the pattern, and then develop predictions that can be tested. A model used to determine the original pattern may not be used to test the researcher’s predictions.  Through this focus on the pattern, the model can be constructed to include only information relevant to the question at hand.&lt;ref name="PatternOrientedModelingInpopulationEcology"&gt;Grimm, V.; Frank, K.; Jeltsch, F.; Brandl, R.; Uchmariski, J.; Wissel C. (1996), "Pattern-oriented modeling in population ecology", ''The Science of the Total Environment'', 183: 151-166.&lt;/ref&gt;

POM is also characterized by an effort to identify the appropriate [[Temporal scales|temporal]] and [[Spatial scales|spatial scale]] at which to study a pattern, and to avoid the assumption that a single process might explain a pattern at multiple temporal or spatial scales. It does, however, offer the opportunity to look explicitly at how processes at multiple scales might be driving a particular pattern.&lt;ref name="PatternOrientedModelingOfAgentBasedComplexSystems" /&gt;

A look at the trade-offs between model complexity and payoff can be considered in the framework of the [[Medawar zone]]. The model is considered too simple if it addresses a single problem (e.g., the explanation behind a single pattern), whereas it will be considered too complex if it incorporates all the available biological data. The Medawar zone, where the payoff in what is learned is greatest, is at an intermediate level of model complexity.

==Usage==
Pattern-oriented modeling has been used to test [[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]] hypotheses on how herdsman decide which farmers to contract with when grazing their cattle. Herdsman behavior followed the pattern predicted by a 'friend' rather than 'cost' priority hypothesis.&lt;ref name="PatternOrientedModelingOfAgentBasedComplexSystems" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2278">'''Perajurit Tanah Air''' or '''Inilah Barisan Kita''' is a [[patriotic]] [[Malaysia]]n [[national song]]. Composed by Saiful Bahari. The song is remarkable for its impartial, egalitarian lyrics, which extols the soldiers' love and duty to the motherland without explicit reference to any particular race or religion.

''Perajurit Tanah Air'' found renewed popularity among Malaysians in the wake of the [[2013 Lahad Datu standoff]].

Inilah barisan kita,&lt;br /&gt;
Yang ikhlas berjuang.&lt;br /&gt;
Siap sedia berkorban,&lt;br /&gt;
Untuk ibu pertiwi!&lt;br /&gt;

Sebelum kita berjaya,&lt;br /&gt;
Jangan harap kami pulang!&lt;br /&gt;
Inilah sumpah pendekar kita,&lt;br /&gt;
Menuju medan bakti!&lt;br /&gt;

Andai kata kami gugur semua,&lt;br /&gt;
Taburlah bunga di atas pusara.&lt;br /&gt;
Kami mohon doa,&lt;br /&gt;
Malaysia berjaya!&lt;br /&gt;

Semboyan telah berbunyi,&lt;br /&gt;
Menuju medan bakti!

These are our lines and ranks,&lt;br /&gt;
Who fight sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;
Prepared to sacrifice our lives,&lt;br /&gt;
For the motherland!&lt;br /&gt;

Before we achieve victory,&lt;br /&gt;
Do not hope for our return!&lt;br /&gt;
This is our oath as warriors,&lt;br /&gt;
March on to the battlefield!&lt;br /&gt;

Suppose that we were all to fall,&lt;br /&gt;
Then scatter flowers on our graves,&lt;br /&gt;
We ask for prayers,&lt;br /&gt;
For Malaysia to succeed!&lt;br /&gt;

The bugle has sounded,&lt;br /&gt;
March on to the battlefield!

Here we are standing united,&lt;br /&gt;
We are willing to fight,&lt;br /&gt;
Brave and ready to sacrifice,&lt;br /&gt;
For our nation's liberty!&lt;br /&gt;

And before victory is called,&lt;br /&gt;
We shall never be returned home!&lt;br /&gt;
This is our true oath, as true warriors,&lt;br /&gt;
March on to the battlefield!&lt;br /&gt;

If we all fall while in the line of battle,&lt;br /&gt;
We ask you to place flowers on our graves,&lt;br /&gt;
And to God we all pray,&lt;br /&gt;
Malaysia will prevail!&lt;br /&gt;

And the war signal is calling,&lt;br /&gt;
March on to the battlefield!

The abbreviation PII is widely accepted in the U.S. context, but the phrase it abbreviates has four common variants based on ''personal''  / ''personally'', and ''identifiable'' / ''identifying''. Not all are equivalent, and for legal purposes the effective definitions vary depending on the jurisdiction and the purposes for which the term is being used. (In other countries with privacy protection laws derived from the OECD privacy principles, the term used is more often "personal information", which may be somewhat broader: in Australia's ''Privacy Act ''1988 (Cth) "personal information" also includes information from which the person's identity is "reasonably ascertainable", potentially covering some information not covered by PII.)

Under European and other data protection regimes, which centre primarily around the [[General Data Protection Regulation]], the term "personal data" is significantly broader, and determines the scope of the regulatory regime.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=Paul M|last2=Solove|first2=Daniel|date=2014|title=Reconciling Personal Information in the United States and European Union |url=https://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/californialawreview/vol102/iss4/7/|journal=California Law Review|language=en|volume=102|issue=4|pages=|doi=10.15779/Z38Z814|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]] Special Publication 800-122&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-122.pdf|title=NIST Special Publication 800-122|author=|date=|website=nist.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines PII as "any information about an individual maintained by an agency, including (1) any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother's maiden name, or biometric records; and (2) any other information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information." So, for example, a user's IP address is not classed as PII on its own, but is classified as linked PII.&lt;ref&gt;Section 3.3.3 “Identifiability”&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of PII has become prevalent as [[information technology]] and the [[Internet]] have made it easier to collect PII leading to a profitable market in collecting and reselling PII. PII can also be exploited by criminals to [[stalking|stalk]] or [[identity theft|steal the identity]] of a person, or to aid in the planning of criminal acts. As a response to these threats, many website [[privacy policy|privacy policies]] specifically address the gathering of PII,{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} and lawmakers{{who|date=April 2013}} have enacted a series of legislation{{which|date=February 2018}} to limit the distribution and accessibility of PII.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

However, PII is a legal concept, not a technical concept, and as noted, it is not utilised in all jurisdictions. Because of the versatility and power of modern re-identification algorithms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Montjoye|first=Yves-Alexandre|author2=César A.

== NIST definition ==
The following data, often used for the express purpose of distinguishing individual identity, clearly classify as PII under the definition used by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (described in detail below):&lt;ref name="NIST"&gt;{{cite web

* [[Full name]] (if not common)
* [[Face]] (sometimes)
* [[Address (geography)|Home address]]
* [[Email address]]
* [[National identification number]] (e.g., [[Social Security number]] in the U.S.)
* [[Passport]] number
* [[Vehicle registration plate]] number
* [[Driver's license]] number
* [[Face]], [[fingerprint]]s, or [[handwriting]]

* [[Digital identity]]
* [[Date of birth]]

* [[Genetics|Genetic information]]
* [[Telephone number]]
* [[User (computing)|Login name]], screen name, [[nickname]], or [[Pseudonym|handle]]

The following are less often used to distinguish individual identity, because they are traits shared by many people.
However, they are potentially PII, because they may be combined with other personal information to identify an individual.

* First or last name, if common
* Country, state, [[postcode]] or city of residence
* Age, especially if non-specific
* [[Gender]] or race
* Name of the school they attend or workplace
* Grades, salary, or job position
* [[Criminal record]]
* [[Web cookie]]&lt;ref name=LN01&gt;{{cite web|title=Anonymity and PII|url=http://cookieresearch.com/anonymityandpii|website=cookieresearch.com|accessdate=6 May 2015|ref=LN01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a person wishes to remain anonymous, descriptions of them will often employ several of the above, such as "a 34-year-old white male who works at Target". Note that information can still be ''private'', in the sense that a person may not wish for it to become publicly known, without being personally identifiable. Moreover, sometimes multiple pieces of information, none sufficient by itself to uniquely identify an individual, may uniquely identify a person when combined; this is one reason that multiple pieces of evidence are usually presented at criminal trials. It has been shown that, in 1990, 87% of the population of the United States could be uniquely identified by gender, [[ZIP code]], and full date of birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In [[hacker (computer security)|hacker]] and [[Internet slang]], the practice of finding and releasing such information is called "[[doxing]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=James Wray and Ulf Stabe |url=http://www.thetechherald.com/articles/The-FBIs-warning-about-doxing-was-too-little-too-late |title=The FBI's warning about doxing was too little too late |publisher=Thetechherald.com |date=2011-12-19 |accessdate=2012-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/276610/20120104/anonymous-operation-hiroshima-inside-doxing-coup.htm |title=Anonymous's Operation Hiroshima: Inside the Doxing Coup the Media Ignored (VIDEO) |publisher=Ibtimes.com |date=2012-01-01 |accessdate=2012-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes used to deter collaboration with law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/technology/2011/07/did-lulzsec-trick-police-arresting-wrong-guy/40522/ |title=Did LulzSec Trick Police Into Arresting the Wrong Guy? - Technology |publisher=The Atlantic Wire |date=2011-07-28 |accessdate=2012-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On occasion, the doxing can trigger an arrest, particularly if law enforcement agencies suspect that the "doxed" individual may panic and disappear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bright |first=Peter |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2012/03/doxed-how-sabu-was-outed-by-former-anons-long-before-his-arrest.ars |title=Doxed: how Sabu was outed by former Anons long before his arrest |publisher=Ars Technica |date=2012-03-07 |accessdate=2012-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In privacy law==
The U.S. government used the term "personally identifiable" in 2007 in a memorandum from the Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget (OMB),&lt;ref name="whitehouse.gov"&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/memoranda/fy2007/m07-16.pdf M-07-16 SUBJECT:Safeguarding Against and Responding to the Breach of Personally Identifiable Information] FROM: Clay Johnson III, Deputy Director for Management (2007/05/22)&lt;/ref&gt; and that usage now appears in US standards such as the [[NIST]] ''Guide to Protecting the Confidentiality of Personally Identifiable Information'' (SP 800-122).&lt;ref name="NIST"/&gt;  The OMB memorandum defines PII as follows:

{{cquote|''Information which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as their name, social security number, biometric records, etc. alone, or when combined with other personal or identifying information which is linked or linkable to a specific individual, such as date and place of birth, mother’s maiden name, etc.''}}

A term similar to PII, "personal data" is defined in EU directive 95/46/EC, for the purposes of the directive:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31995L0046:EN:HTML |title=Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |accessdate=2013-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|''Article 2a: 'personal data' shall mean any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity;''}}

However, in the EU rules, there has been a clearer notion that the data subject can potentially be identified through additional processing of other attributes—quasi- or pseudo-identifiers. In an early draft of the EU [[General Data Protection Regulation]], this was formalized in Article 4, but was omitted in the final version: a "data subject" is one "who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by means reasonably likely to be used by the controller or by any other natural or legal person".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P7-TA-2014-0212+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN|title=Texts adopted - Wednesday, 12 March 2014 - Protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data ***I - P7_TA(2014)0212|author=|date=|website=www.europarl.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[General Data Protection Regulation|GDPR]] became enforceable on 25 May 2018.

Another term similar to PII, "personal information" is defined in a section of the California data breach notification law, SB1386:&lt;ref name="California"&gt;{{cite web
| url= http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/01-02/bill/sen/sb_1351-1400/sb_1386_bill_20020926_chaptered.html
| title=Text of California Senate Bill SB 1386 ref paragraph SEC. 2 1798.29.(e)
| publisher=California
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|''(e) For purposes of this section, "personal information" means an individual's first name or first initial and last name in combination with any one or more of the following data elements, when either the name or the data elements are not encrypted:  (1) Social security number. (2) Driver's license number or California Identification Card number. (3) Account number, credit or debit card number, in combination with any required security code, access code, or password that would permit access to an individual's financial account. (f) For purposes of this section, "personal information" does not include publicly available information that is lawfully made available to the general public from federal, state, or local government records.''}}

The concept of information combination given in the SB1386 definition is key to correctly distinguishing PII, as defined by OMB, from "personal information", as defined by SB1386.  Information, such as a name, that lacks context cannot be said to be SB1386 "personal information", but it must be said to be PII as defined by OMB. For example, the name [[Placeholder name|John Smith]] has no meaning in the current context and is therefore not SB1386 "personal information", but it is PII. A [[Social Security Number]] (SSN) without a name or some other associated identity or context information is not SB1386 "personal information", but it is PII. For example, the SSN 078-05-1120 by itself is PII, but it is not SB1386 "personal information". However the combination of a valid name with the correct SSN is SB1386 "personal information".&lt;ref name="California"/&gt;

The combination of a name with a context may also be considered PII; for example, if a person's name is on a list of patients for an HIV clinic.  However, it is not necessary for the name to be combined with a context in order for it to be PII.  The reason for this distinction is that bits of information such as names, although they may not be sufficient by themselves to make an identification, may later be combined with other information to identify persons and expose them to harm.

According to the OMB, it is not always the case that PII is "sensitive", and context may be taken into account in deciding whether certain PII is or is not sensitive.&lt;ref name="whitehouse.gov"/&gt;{{full citation needed|date=April 2013}}

=== Australia ===
In Australia, the [[Privacy Act 1988]] deals with the protection of individual privacy, using the OECD Privacy Principles from the 1980s to set up a broad, principles-based regulatory model (unlike in the US, where coverage is generally not based on broad principles but on specific technologies, business practices or data items). Section 6 has the relevant definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/pa1988108/s6.html|title=Privacy Act 1988|accessdate=14 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critical detail is that the definition of 'personal information' also applies to where the individual can be indirectly identified:

{{quote|"personal information" means information or an opinion (including information or an opinion forming part of a database), whether true or not, and whether recorded in a material form or not, about an individual whose identity is apparent, ''or can reasonably be ascertained'', from the information or opinion. [emphasis added]}}

This raises the question of reasonableness: assume it is theoretically possible to identify a person from core information which say does NOT include a simple name and address, but does contain clues which could be pursued to ascertain who it relates to. Just how much extra effort or difficulty would such a step need before we could clearly say that the identity could NOT be "reasonably ascertained" from it?

{{quote|For instance, if the information involves an IP address, and the relevant ISP stores logs which could easily be inspected (if you had sufficient legal justification) to re-link the IP address to the account holder, can their identity be "reasonably ascertained"? If such linking used to be expensive, slow and difficult, but becomes easier, does this change the answer at some point?}}

It appears that this definition is significantly broader than the Californian example given above, and thus that Australian privacy law, while in some respects weakly enforced, may cover a broader category of data and information than in some US law.
In particular, online behavioral advertising businesses based in the US but surreptitiously collecting information from people in other countries in the form of cookies, bugs, trackers and the like may find that their preference to avoid the implications of wanting to build a psychographic profile of a particular person using the rubric of 'we don't collect personal information' may find that this does not make sense under a broader definition like that in the Australian Privacy Act.

The [[Privacy Act of 1974]] (Pub.L. 93–579, 88 Stat. 1896, enacted December 31, 1974, 5 U.S.C. § 552a), a United States federal law, establishes a Code of Fair Information Practice that governs the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of personally identifiable information about individuals that is maintained in systems of records by federal agencies.

One of the primary focuses of the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA), is to protect a patient's [[Protected Health Information]] (PHI), which is similar to PII. The U.S. Senate proposed the [[Privacy Act of 2005]], which attempted to strictly limit the display, purchase, or sale of PII without the person's consent. Similarly, the (proposed) [[Anti-Phishing Act of 2005]] attempted to prevent the acquiring of PII through [[phishing]].

U.S. lawmakers have paid special attention to the [[social security number]] because it can be easily used to commit [[identity theft]]. The (proposed) [[Social Security Number Protection Act of 2005]] and (proposed) [[Identity Theft Prevention Act of 2005]] each sought to limit the distribution of an individual's social security number.

== Personal safety ==
In some professions, it is dangerous for a person's identity to become known, because this information might be exploited violently by their enemies; for example, their enemies might hunt them down or kidnap loved ones to force them to cooperate. For this reason, the [[United States Department of Defense]] (DoD) has strict policies controlling release of PII of DoD personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Perturbation theory''' comprises mathematical methods for finding an [[approximation theory|approximate solution]] to a problem, by starting from the exact [[solution (equation)|solution]] of a related, simpler problem. A critical feature of the technique is a middle step that breaks the problem into "solvable" and "perturbation" parts.&lt;ref name="General Perturbations"&gt;{{cite book |isbn= 978-145378-1470|url= https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Astrodynamics-William-E-Wiesel/dp/1453781471/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1400160278&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=modern+astrodynamics+wiesel |title=Modern Astrodynamics |author=William E. Wiesel |location=Ohio |publisher=Aphelion Press| year=2010 |page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perturbation theory is applicable if the problem at hand cannot be solved exactly, but can be formulated by adding a "small" term to the mathematical description of the exactly solvable problem.

Perturbation theory leads to an expression for the desired solution in terms of a [[formal power series]] in some "small" parameter – known as a '''perturbation series''' – that quantifies the deviation from the exactly solvable problem. The leading term in this power series is the solution of the exactly solvable problem, while further terms describe the deviation in the solution, due to the deviation from the initial problem. Formally, we have for the approximation to the full solution {{mvar|A}}, a series in the small parameter (here called {{mvar|ε}}), like the following:

:&lt;math&gt; A= A_0 + \varepsilon^1 A_1 + \varepsilon^2 A_2 + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

In this example, {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} would be the known solution to the exactly solvable initial problem and {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...}} represent the '''higher-order terms''' which may be found iteratively by some systematic procedure. For small {{mvar|ε}} these higher-order terms in the series become successively smaller.

An approximate "perturbation solution" is obtained by truncating the series, usually by keeping only the first two terms, the initial solution and the "first-order" perturbation correction
:&lt;math&gt;A \approx A_0 + \varepsilon A_1~.&lt;/math&gt;

==General description==
Perturbation theory is closely related to methods used in [[numerical analysis]]. The earliest use of what would now be called ''perturbation theory'' was to deal with the otherwise unsolvable mathematical problems of [[celestial mechanics]]: for example the [[orbit of the Moon]], which moves noticeably differently from a simple [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Keplerian ellipse]] because of the competing gravitation of the Earth and the [[Sun]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.70.589 Martin C. Gutzwiller, "Moon-Earth-Sun: The oldest three-body problem", Rev. Mod. Phys. 70, 589 – Published 1 April 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

Perturbation methods start with a simplified form of the original problem, which is ''simple enough'' to be solved exactly. In [[celestial mechanics]], this is usually a [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Keplerian ellipse]]. Under [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|non-relativistic gravity]], an ellipse is exactly correct when there are only two gravitating bodies (say, the Earth and the [[Moon]]) but not quite correct when there are [[three-body problem|three or more objects]] (say, the Earth, [[Moon]], [[Sun]], and the rest of the [[solar system]]) and not quite correct when the gravitational interaction is stated using formulations from [[General relativity]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

The solved, but simplified problem is then ''"perturbed"'' to make the conditions that the perturbed solution actually satisfies closer to the formula in the original problem, such as including the gravitational attraction of a third body (the [[Sun]]). Typically, the "conditions" that represent reality are a formula (or several) that specifically express some physical law, like [[Newton's second law|Newton's second law, the force-acceleration equation]],
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = m \mathbf{a} ~.&lt;/math&gt;

In the case of the example, the force {{math|'''F'''}} is calculated based on the number of gravitationally relevant bodies; the acceleration {{math|'''a'''}} is obtained, using calculus, from the path of the [[Moon]] in its orbit. Both of these come in two forms: approximate values for force and acceleration, which result from simplifications, and hypothetical exact values for force and acceleration, which would require the complete answer to calculate.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

The slight changes that result from accommodating the perturbation, which themselves may have been simplified yet again, are used as corrections to the approximate solution. Because of simplifications introduced along every step of the way, the corrections are never perfect, and the conditions met by the corrected solution do not perfectly match the equation demanded by reality. However, even only one cycle of corrections often provides an excellent approximate answer to what the real solution should be.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

There is no requirement to stop at only one cycle of corrections. A partially corrected solution can be re-used as the new starting point for yet another cycle of perturbations and corrections. In principle, cycles of finding increasingly better corrections could go on indefinitely. In practice, one typically stops at one or two cycles of corrections. The usual difficulty with the method is that the corrections progressively make the new solutions very much more complicated, so each cycle is much more difficult to manage than the previous cycle of corrections. [[Isaac Newton]] is reported to have said, regarding the problem of the [[Moon]]'s orbit, that ''"It causeth my head to ache."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Cropper | first1=William H. | title=Great Physicists: The Life and Times of Leading Physicists from Galileo to Hawking | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | isbn=978-0-19-517324-6 | year=2004 | page=34}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This general procedure is a widely used mathematical tool in advanced sciences and engineering: start with a simplified problem and gradually add corrections that make the formula that the corrected problem becomes a closer and closer match to the original formula.

==Examples==
Examples for the "mathematical description" are:  an [[algebraic equation]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.unm.edu/~lromero/2013/class_notes/poly.pdf L. A. Romero, "Perturbation theory for polynomials", Lecture Notes, University of New Mexico (2013)]&lt;/ref&gt; a [[differential equation]] (e.g., the [[equations of motion]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.physik.uni-muenchen.de/lehre/vorlesungen/sose_11/T1_Theoretische_Mechanik/vorlesung/anharmonic-perturbation.pdf Sergei Winitzki, "Perturbation theory for anharmonic oscillations", Lecture notes, LMU (2006)]&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[wave equation]]), a [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] (in [[statistical mechanics]]), radiative transfer,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222659054_Radiative_perturbation_theory_A_review Michael A. Box, "Radiative perturbation theory: a review", Environmental Modelling &amp; Software 17 (2002) 95–106]&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] operator (in [[quantum mechanics]]).

Examples for the kind of solution to be found perturbatively: the solution of the equation (e.g., the [[trajectory]] of a particle), the [[average|statistical average]] of some physical quantity (e.g., average magnetization), the [[ground state]] energy of a quantum mechanical problem.

Examples for the exactly solvable problems to start with: [[linear equation]]s, including linear equations of motion ([[harmonic oscillator]], [[linear wave equation]]), statistical or quantum-mechanical systems of non-interacting particles (or in general, Hamiltonians or free energies containing only terms quadratic in all degrees of freedom).

Examples of "perturbations" to deal with: Nonlinear contributions to the equations of motion, [[interaction]]s between particles, terms of higher powers in the Hamiltonian/Free Energy.

For physical problems involving interactions between particles, the terms of the perturbation series may be displayed (and manipulated) using [[Feynman diagram]]s.

==History==
Perturbation theory was first devised to solve [[Three-body problem|otherwise intractable problems]] in the calculation of the motions of planets in the solar system. For instance, [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] explained the gravitation between two astronomical bodies, but when a third body is added, the problem was, "How does each body pull on each?" Newton's equation only allowed the mass of two bodies to be analyzed. The gradually increasing accuracy of [[astrometry|astronomical observations]] led to incremental demands in the accuracy of solutions to Newton's gravitational equations, which led several notable 18th and 19th&amp;nbsp;century mathematicians, such as [[Lagrange]] and [[Laplace]], to extend and generalize the methods of perturbation theory. These well-developed perturbation methods were adopted and adapted to solve new problems arising during the development of [[quantum mechanics]] in 20th&amp;nbsp;century atomic and subatomic physics. [[Paul Dirac]] developed perturbation theory in 1927 to evaluate when a particle would be emitted in radioactive elements. It was later named [[Fermi's golden rule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bransden|first1=B. H.|last2=Joachain|first2=C. J.|title=Quantum Mechanics|edition=2nd|year=1999|isbn=978-0582356917|page=443}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dirac | first = P.A.M. | authorlink = Paul Dirac | title = The Quantum Theory of Emission and Absorption of Radiation | journal = [[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]] | volume = 114 | pages = 243–265 | date=1 March 1927| issue = 767 | doi = 10.1098/rspa.1927.0039 | jstor=94746|bibcode = 1927RSPSA.114..243D }} See equations (24) and (32).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beginnings in the study of planetary motion===
Since the planets are very remote from each other, and since their mass is small as compared to the mass of the Sun, the gravitational forces between the planets can be neglected, and the planetary motion is considered, to a first approximation, as taking place along Kepler's orbits, which are defined by the equations of the [[two-body problem]], the two bodies being the planet and the Sun.&lt;ref name="EoM"&gt;Perturbation theory. N. N. Bogolyubov, jr. (originator), Encyclopedia of Mathematics. URL: http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php?title=Perturbation_theory&amp;oldid=11676&lt;/ref&gt;

Since astronomic data came to be known with much greater accuracy, it became necessary to consider how the motion of a planet around the Sun is affected by other planets. This was the origin of the [[three-body problem]]; thus, in studying the system Moon–Earth–Sun the mass ratio between the Moon and the Earth was chosen as the small parameter. [[Lagrange]] and [[Laplace]] were the first to advance the view that the constants which describe the motion of a planet around the Sun are  "perturbed", as it were, by the motion of other planets and vary as a function of time; hence the name "perturbation theory".&lt;ref name="EoM" /&gt;

Perturbation theory was investigated by the classical scholars—[[Laplace]], [[Siméon Denis Poisson|Poisson]], [[Gauss]]—as a result of which the computations could be performed with a very high accuracy. [[Discovery of Neptune|The discovery of the planet Neptune]] in 1848 by [[Urbain Le Verrier]], based on the deviations in motion of the planet [[Uranus]] (he sent the coordinates to [[Johann Gottfried Galle]] who successfully observed Neptune through his telescope), represented a triumph of perturbation theory.&lt;ref name="EoM" /&gt;

==Perturbation orders==
The standard exposition of perturbation theory is given in terms of the ''order'' to which the perturbation is carried out: '''first-order perturbation theory''' or '''second-order perturbation theory''', and whether the perturbed states are degenerate, which requires '''[[singular perturbation]]'''. In the singular case extra care must be taken, and the theory is slightly more elaborate.

==In chemistry==
Many of the [[ab initio quantum chemistry methods]] use perturbation theory directly or are closely related methods. Implicit perturbation theory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ja00428a004 | title = Theory of the Chemical Bond | year = 1976 | last1 = King | first1 = Matcha | journal = JACS | volume = 98 | issue = 12 | pages = 3415–3420 }}&lt;/ref&gt; works with the complete Hamiltonian from the very beginning and never specifies a perturbation operator as such. [[Møller&amp;ndash;Plesset perturbation theory]] uses the difference between the [[Hartree&amp;ndash;Fock]] Hamiltonian and the exact non-relativistic Hamiltonian as the perturbation. The zero-order energy is the sum of orbital energies. The first-order energy is the Hartree&amp;ndash;Fock energy and electron correlation is included at second-order or higher. Calculations to second, third or fourth order are very common and the code is included in most [[Computational chemistry#Software packages|ab initio quantum chemistry programs]]. A related but more accurate method is the [[coupled cluster]] method.

In [[geometry]], '''Plücker coordinates''', introduced by [[Julius Plücker]] in the 19th century, are a way to assign six [[homogeneous coordinates]] to each [[line (mathematics)|line]] in [[projective space|projective 3-space]], '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Because they satisfy a quadratic constraint, they establish a [[one-to-one correspondence]] between the 4-dimensional space of lines in '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and points on a [[quadric (projective geometry)|quadric]] in '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; (projective 5-space). A predecessor and special case of [[Grassmann coordinates]] (which describe ''k''-dimensional linear subspaces, or ''flats'', in an ''n''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]), Plücker coordinates arise naturally in [[geometric algebra]]. They have proved useful for [[computer graphics]], and also can be extended to coordinates for the [[screw theory|screws and wrenches]] in the theory of [[kinematics]] used for [[robot control]].

[[File:Plücker line coordinate geometry.png|thumb|right|Displacement and moment of two points on line]]
A line ''L'' in 3-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] is determined by two distinct points that it contains, or by two distinct planes that contain it. Consider the first case, with points '''''x'''''&amp;nbsp;= (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and '''''y'''''&amp;nbsp;= (''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''y''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). The vector displacement from '''''x''''' to '''''y''''' is nonzero because the points are distinct, and represents the ''direction'' of the line. That is, every displacement between points on ''L'' is a scalar multiple of '''''d'''''&amp;nbsp;= '''''y'''''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;'''''x'''''. If a physical particle of unit mass were to move from '''''x''''' to '''''y''''', it would have a [[moment (physics)|moment]] about the origin. The geometric equivalent is a vector whose direction is perpendicular to the plane containing ''L'' and the origin, and whose length equals twice the area of the triangle formed by the displacement and the origin. Treating the points as displacements from the origin, the moment is '''''m'''''&amp;nbsp;= '''''x'''''×'''''y''''', where "×" denotes the vector [[cross product]]. For a fixed line, ''L'', the area of the triangle is proportional to the length of the segment between '''''x''''' and '''''y''''', considered as the base of the triangle; it is not changed by sliding the base along the line, parallel to itself. By definition the moment vector is perpendicular to every displacement along the line, so '''''d'''''•'''''m'''''&amp;nbsp;= 0, where "•" denotes the vector [[dot product]].

Although neither '''''d''''' nor '''''m''''' alone is sufficient to determine ''L'', together the pair does so uniquely, up to a common (nonzero) scalar multiple which depends on the distance between '''''x''''' and '''''y'''''. That is, the coordinates

: ('''''d''''':'''''m''''') = (''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;:''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:''d''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;:''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;:''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:''m''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)

may be considered [[homogeneous coordinates]] for ''L'', in the sense that all pairs (''λ'''d''''':''λ'''m'''''), for ''λ''&amp;nbsp;≠ 0, can be produced by points on ''L'' and only ''L'', and any such pair determines a unique line so long as '''''d''''' is not zero and '''''d'''''•'''''m'''''&amp;nbsp;= 0. Furthermore, this approach extends to include [[point at infinity|points]], [[line at infinity|lines]], and a [[plane at infinity|plane]] "at infinity", in the sense of [[projective geometry]].

: '''Example.''' Let '''''x'''''&amp;nbsp;= (2,3,7) and '''''y'''''&amp;nbsp;= (2,1,0). Then ('''''d''''':'''''m''''')&amp;nbsp;= (0:−2:−7:−7:14:−4).

Alternatively, let the equations for points '''''x''''' of two distinct planes containing ''L'' be

: 0 = ''a'' + '''''a'''''•'''''x'''''
: 0 = ''b'' + '''''b'''''•'''''x''''' .

Then their respective planes are perpendicular to vectors '''''a''''' and '''''b''''', and the direction of ''L'' must be perpendicular to both. Hence we may set '''''d'''''&amp;nbsp;= '''''a'''''×'''''b''''', which is nonzero because '''''a''''' and '''''b''''' are neither zero nor parallel (the planes being distinct and intersecting). If point '''''x''''' satisfies both plane equations, then it also satisfies the linear combination

:{|
|-
| 0 || = ''a'' (''b'' + '''''b'''''•'''''x''''') − ''b'' (''a'' + '''''a'''''•'''''x''''')
|-
| || = (''a'' '''''b''''' − ''b'' '''''a''''')•'''''x''''' .
|}

That is, '''''m'''''&amp;nbsp;= ''a''&amp;nbsp;'''''b'''''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;'''''a''''' is a vector perpendicular to displacements to points on ''L'' from the origin; it is, in fact, a moment consistent with the '''''d''''' previously defined from '''''a''''' and '''''b'''''.

proof：need to show '''''m'''''&amp;nbsp;= ''a''&amp;nbsp;'''''b'''''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;'''''a = r×d = r× a×b, let  a•a = b•b = 1'''''
[[File:BaiduShurufa 2018-9-29 20-38-43.png|thumb|plane orthogonal to the line and include the origin]]
point B is the origin.  the line is pass point D and orthogonal to the plane, the 2 plane pass CD and DE both orthogonal to the plane, BD is diameter

: '''''a ='''''  BE/ ||BE||,  '''''b =''''' BC/ ||BC||，'''''r''''' = BD,  −a = ||BF|| = ||BE||，−b = ||BG|| = ||BC||, '''''m'''''= a'''''b'''''−b'''''a =''''' FG,  ||'''''d''&amp;nbsp;|| = || ''a''×''b'' ||''' = sin(FBG)

angle BCE = BDE = BGF, so points D,G,E,H on a circle, and angle GHG is right angle, FG orthogonal to BD, so 4 points C, D, H, F on a circle, and 

||BF||&amp;nbsp;||BC|| = ||BH||&amp;nbsp;||BD||, that is ''ab''&amp;nbsp;sin(FBG) = ||BH||&amp;nbsp;||'''''r'''''||&amp;nbsp;sin(FBG), 2&amp;middot;area of triangle BFG = ''ab''&amp;middot;sin(FBG) =  ||BH||&amp;nbsp;||FG|| = ||BH||&amp;nbsp;||'''''r'''''||&amp;nbsp;sin(FBG), 
||'''''m'''''|| = ||FG|| = ||'''''r'''''||&amp;nbsp;sin(FBG) = ||'''''r'''''||&amp;nbsp;||'''''d&amp;nbsp;||,''''' check direction and '''''m = r''×''d.'''''

when ||'''''r'''''|| = 0, the line is the one pass origin with direction '''''d'''''; if ||'''''r'''''|| &gt; 0,  the line is with direction '''''d,''''' the plane including the origin and the line has normal vector '''''m''''', the line is tangent to a circle on the plane centered origin and with radius ||''r''|| at point '''''r'''''.

: '''Example.''' Let ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 2, '''''a'''''&amp;nbsp;= (−1,0,0) and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= −7, '''''b'''''&amp;nbsp;= (0,7,−2). Then ('''''d''''':'''''m''''')&amp;nbsp;= (0:−2:−7:−7:14:−4).

Although the usual algebraic definition tends to obscure the relationship, ('''''d''''':'''''m''''') are the Plücker coordinates of ''L''.

== Algebraic definition ==

=== Primal coordinates ===
In a 3-dimensional projective space '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, let ''L'' be a line through distinct points '''x''' and '''y''' with [[homogeneous coordinates]] (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;:''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;:''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;:''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;:''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:''y''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).
The Plücker coordinates ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; are defined as follows:
:{|
|-
| &lt;math&gt;p_{ij} &lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt; {}= \begin{vmatrix} x_{i} &amp; y_{i} \\ x_{j} &amp; y_{j}\end{vmatrix} = x_{i}y_{j}-x_{j}y_{i} . &lt;/math&gt;
|}
This implies ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''ii''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 0 and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= −''p''&lt;sub&gt;''ji''&lt;/sub&gt;, reducing the possibilities to only six (4 [[binomial coefficient|choose]] 2) independent quantities. The sixtuple

: &lt;math&gt;(p_{01}:p_{02}:p_{03}:p_{23}:p_{31}:p_{12}) &lt;/math&gt;

is uniquely determined by ''L'' up to a common nonzero scale factor. Furthermore, not all six components can be zero.
Thus the Plücker coordinates of ''L'' may be considered as homogeneous coordinates of a point in a 5-dimensional projective space, as suggested by the colon notation.

To see these facts, let ''M'' be the 4×2 matrix with the point coordinates as columns.

: &lt;math&gt; M = \begin{bmatrix} x_0 &amp;  y_0 \\ x_1 &amp; y_1 \\ x_2 &amp; y_2 \\ x_3 &amp; y_3 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The Plücker coordinate ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; is the determinant of rows ''i'' and ''j'' of ''M''.
Because '''x''' and '''y''' are distinct points, the columns of ''M'' are [[linear independence|linearly independent]]; ''M'' has [[rank (linear algebra)|rank]] 2. Let ''M&amp;prime;'' be a second matrix, with columns '''x&amp;prime;''' and '''y&amp;prime;''' a different pair of distinct points on ''L''. Then the columns of ''M&amp;prime;'' are [[linear combination]]s of the columns of ''M''; so for some 2×2 [[nonsingular matrix]] Λ,

: &lt;math&gt; M' = M\Lambda . &lt;/math&gt;

In particular, rows ''i'' and ''j'' of ''M&amp;prime;'' and ''M'' are related by

: &lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix} x'_{i} &amp; y'_{i}\\x'_{j}&amp; y'_{j} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} x_{i} &amp; y_{i}\\x_{j}&amp; y_{j} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \lambda_{00} &amp; \lambda_{01} \\ \lambda_{10} &amp; \lambda_{11} \end{bmatrix} . &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the determinant of the left side 2×2 matrix equals the product of the determinants of the right side 2×2 matrices, the latter of which is a fixed scalar, det&amp;nbsp;Λ. Furthermore, all six 2×2 subdeterminants in ''M'' cannot be zero because the rank of ''M'' is 2.

=== Plücker map ===
Denote the set of all lines (linear images of '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) in '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; by ''G''&lt;sub&gt;1,3&lt;/sub&gt;.  We thus have a map:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\alpha \colon \mathrm{G}_{1,3} &amp; \rightarrow \mathbf{P}^5 \\
L &amp; \mapsto L^{\alpha},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt; L^{\alpha}=(p_{01}:p_{02}:p_{03}:p_{23}:p_{31}:p_{12}) . &lt;/math&gt;

=== Dual coordinates ===
Alternatively, a line can be described as the intersection of two planes. Let ''L'' 
be a line contained in distinct planes '''a''' and '''b''' with homogeneous coefficients (''a''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;:''a''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;:''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and (''b''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;:''b''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;:''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:''b''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), respectively. (The first plane equation is ∑&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;=0, for example.) The dual Plücker coordinate ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''ij''&lt;/sup&gt; is

:{|
|-
| &lt;math&gt;p^{ij} &lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt; {}= \begin{vmatrix} a^{i} &amp; a^{j} \\ b^{i} &amp; b^{j}\end{vmatrix}  = a^{i}b^{j}-a^{j}b^{i} . &lt;/math&gt;
|}

Dual coordinates are convenient in some computations, and they are equivalent to primary coordinates:
: &lt;math&gt;
(p_{01}:p_{02}:p_{03}:p_{23}:p_{31}:p_{12})=
(p^{23}:p^{31}:p^{12}:p^{01}:p^{02}:p^{03})
&lt;/math&gt;
Here, equality between the two vectors in homogeneous coordinates means that the numbers on the right side are equal to the numbers on the left side up to some common scaling factor &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. Specifically, let (''i'',''j'',''k'',''ℓ'') be an [[even permutation]] of (0,1,2,3); then

: &lt;math&gt;p_{ij} = \lambda p^{k\ell} .  &lt;/math&gt;

=== Geometry ===
To relate back to the geometric intuition, take ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 0 as the plane at infinity; thus the coordinates of points ''not'' at infinity can be normalized so that ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 1. Then ''M'' becomes

: &lt;math&gt; M = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp;  1 \\ x_1 &amp; y_1 \\ x_2&amp; y_2 \\ x_3 &amp; y_3 \end{bmatrix} , &lt;/math&gt;

and setting '''''x'''''&amp;nbsp;= (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and '''''y'''''&amp;nbsp;= (''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''y''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), we have '''''d'''''&amp;nbsp;= (''p''&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt;,''p''&lt;sub&gt;02&lt;/sub&gt;,''p''&lt;sub&gt;03&lt;/sub&gt;) and '''''m'''''&amp;nbsp;= (''p''&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;,''p''&lt;sub&gt;31&lt;/sub&gt;,''p''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;).

Dually, we have '''''d'''''&amp;nbsp;= (''p''&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;,''p''&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;,''p''&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;) and '''''m'''''&amp;nbsp;= (''p''&lt;sup&gt;01&lt;/sup&gt;,''p''&lt;sup&gt;02&lt;/sup&gt;,''p''&lt;sup&gt;03&lt;/sup&gt;).

==Bijection between lines and Klein quadric==
=== Plane equations ===
If the point '''z'''&amp;nbsp;= (''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;:''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;:''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:''z''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) lies on ''L'', then the columns of

: &lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix} x_0 &amp; y_0 &amp; z_0 \\ x_1 &amp; y_1 &amp; z_1 \\ x_2 &amp; y_2 &amp; z_2 \\ x_3 &amp; y_3 &amp; z_3 \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

are [[linearly dependent]], so that the rank of this larger matrix is still 2. This implies that all 3×3 submatrices have determinant zero, generating four (4 choose 3) plane equations, such as

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
0 &amp; = \begin{vmatrix} x_0 &amp; y_0 &amp; z_0 \\ x_1 &amp; y_1 &amp; z_1 \\ x_2 &amp; y_2 &amp; z_2 \end{vmatrix} \\[5pt]
&amp; = \begin{vmatrix} x_1 &amp; y_1 \\ x_2 &amp; y_2 \end{vmatrix} z_0 - \begin{vmatrix} x_0 &amp; y_0 \\ x_2 &amp; y_2 \end{vmatrix} z_1 + \begin{vmatrix} x_0 &amp; y_0 \\ x_1 &amp; y_1 \end{vmatrix} z_2 \\[5pt]
&amp; = p_{12} z_0 - p_{02} z_1 + p_{01} z_2 . \\[5pt]
&amp; = p^{03} z_0 + p^{13} z_1 + p^{23} z_2 .
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The four possible planes obtained are as follows.

: &lt;math&gt; \begin{matrix}
0 &amp; = &amp; {}+ p_{12} z_0 &amp; {}- p_{02} z_1 &amp; {}+ p_{01} z_2 &amp; \\
0 &amp; = &amp; {}- p_{31} z_0 &amp; {}- p_{03} z_1 &amp; &amp; {}+ p_{01} z_3 \\
0 &amp; = &amp; {}+p_{23} z_0 &amp; &amp; {}- p_{03} z_2 &amp; {}+ p_{02} z_3 \\
0 &amp; = &amp; &amp; {}+p_{23} z_1 &amp; {}+ p_{31} z_2 &amp; {}+ p_{12} z_3
\end{matrix} &lt;/math&gt;

Using dual coordinates, and letting (''a''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;:''a''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;:''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) be the line coefficients, each of these is simply ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;= ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''ij''&lt;/sup&gt;, or

: &lt;math&gt; 0 = \sum_{i=0}^3 p^{ij} z_i , \qquad j = 0,\ldots,3 . &lt;/math&gt;

Each Plücker coordinate appears in two of the four equations, each time multiplying a different variable; and as at least one of the coordinates is nonzero, we are guaranteed non-vacuous equations for two distinct planes intersecting in ''L''. Thus the Plücker coordinates of a line determine that line uniquely, and the map α is an [[Injective function|injection]].

=== Quadratic relation ===
The image of α is not the complete set of points in '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;; the Plücker coordinates of a line ''L'' satisfy the quadratic Plücker relation

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
0 &amp; = p_{01}p^{01}+p_{02}p^{02}+p_{03}p^{03} \\
&amp; = p_{01}p_{23}+p_{02}p_{31}+p_{03}p_{12}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

For proof, write this homogeneous polynomial as determinants and use [[Laplace expansion]] (in reverse).

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
0 &amp; = \begin{vmatrix}x_0&amp;y_0\\x_1&amp;y_1\end{vmatrix}\begin{vmatrix}x_2&amp;y_2\\x_3&amp;y_3\end{vmatrix}+
\begin{vmatrix}x_0&amp;y_0\\x_2&amp;y_2\end{vmatrix}\begin{vmatrix}x_3&amp;y_3\\x_1&amp;y_1\end{vmatrix}+
\begin{vmatrix}x_0&amp;y_0\\x_3&amp;y_3\end{vmatrix}\begin{vmatrix}x_1&amp;y_1\\x_2&amp;y_2\end{vmatrix} \\[5pt]
&amp; = (x_0 y_1-y_0 x_1)\begin{vmatrix}x_2&amp;y_2\\x_3&amp;y_3\end{vmatrix}-
(x_0 y_2-y_0 x_2)\begin{vmatrix}x_1&amp;y_1\\x_3&amp;y_3\end{vmatrix}+
(x_0 y_3-y_0 x_3)\begin{vmatrix}x_1&amp;y_1\\x_2&amp;y_2\end{vmatrix} \\[5pt]
&amp; = x_0 \left(y_1\begin{vmatrix}x_2&amp;y_2\\x_3&amp;y_3\end{vmatrix}-
y_2\begin{vmatrix}x_1&amp;y_1\\x_3&amp;y_3\end{vmatrix}+
y_3\begin{vmatrix}x_1&amp;y_1\\x_2&amp;y_2\end{vmatrix}\right)
-y_0 \left(x_1\begin{vmatrix}x_2&amp;y_2\\x_3&amp;y_3\end{vmatrix}-
x_2\begin{vmatrix}x_1&amp;y_1\\x_3&amp;y_3\end{vmatrix}+
x_3\begin{vmatrix}x_1&amp;y_1\\x_2&amp;y_2\end{vmatrix}\right) \\[5pt]
&amp; = x_0 \begin{vmatrix}x_1&amp;y_1&amp;y_1\\x_2&amp;y_2&amp;y_2\\x_3&amp;y_3&amp;y_3\end{vmatrix}
-y_0 \begin{vmatrix}x_1&amp;x_1&amp;y_1\\x_2&amp;x_2&amp;y_2\\x_3&amp;x_3&amp;y_3\end{vmatrix}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Since both 3×3 determinants have duplicate columns, the right hand side is identically zero.

Another proof may be done like this:
Since vector

: &lt;math&gt; d = \left( p_{01}, p_{02}, p_{03} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

is perpendicular to vector

: &lt;math&gt; m = \left( p_{23}, p_{31}, p_{12} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

(see above), the scalar product of ''d'' and ''m'' must be zero! q.e.d.

=== Point equations ===
Letting (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;:''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;:''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) be the point coordinates, four possible points on a line each have coordinates ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;, for ''j''&amp;nbsp;= 0…3. Some of these possible points may be inadmissible because all coordinates are zero, but since at least one Plücker coordinate is nonzero, at least two distinct points are guaranteed.

=== Bijectivity ===
If (''q''&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt;:''q''&lt;sub&gt;02&lt;/sub&gt;:''q''&lt;sub&gt;03&lt;/sub&gt;:''q''&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;:''q''&lt;sub&gt;31&lt;/sub&gt;:''q''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;) are the homogeneous coordinates of a point in '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, without loss of generality assume that ''q''&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt; is nonzero. Then the matrix

: &lt;math&gt; M = \begin{bmatrix} q_{01} &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; q_{01} \\ -q_{12} &amp; q_{02} \\ q_{31} &amp; q_{03} \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

has rank 2, and so its columns are distinct points defining a line ''L''. When the '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; coordinates, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;, satisfy the quadratic Plücker relation, they are the Plücker coordinates of ''L''. To see this, first normalize ''q''&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt; to 1. Then we immediately have that for the Plücker coordinates computed from ''M'', ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;, except for

: &lt;math&gt; p_{23} = - q_{03} q_{12} - q_{02} q_{31} . &lt;/math&gt;

But if the ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; satisfy the Plücker relation ''q''&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;+''q''&lt;sub&gt;02&lt;/sub&gt;''q''&lt;sub&gt;31&lt;/sub&gt;+''q''&lt;sub&gt;03&lt;/sub&gt;''q''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 0, then ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''23''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''23''&lt;/sub&gt;, completing the set of identities.

Consequently, α is a [[surjection]] onto the [[algebraic variety]] consisting of the set of zeros of the quadratic polynomial

: &lt;math&gt; p_{01}p_{23}+p_{02}p_{31}+p_{03}p_{12} . &lt;/math&gt;

And since α is also an injection, the lines in '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; are thus in [[bijection|bijective]] correspondence with the points of this [[quadric]] in '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, called the Plücker quadric or [[Klein quadric]].

==Uses==
Plücker coordinates allow concise solutions to problems of line geometry in 3-dimensional space, especially those involving [[incidence (geometry)|incidence]].

=== Line-line crossing ===
Two lines in '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; are either [[skew lines|skew]] or [[coplanar]], and in the latter case they are either coincident or intersect in a unique point. If ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; are the Plücker coordinates of two lines, then they are coplanar precisely when '''''d'''''⋅'''''m'''''&amp;prime;+'''''m'''''⋅'''''d'''''&amp;prime;&amp;nbsp;= 0, as shown by

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
0 &amp; = p_{01}p'_{23} + p_{02}p'_{31} + p_{03}p'_{12} + p_{23}p'_{01} + p_{31}p'_{02} + p_{12}p'_{03} \\[5pt]
&amp; = \begin{vmatrix}x_0&amp;y_0&amp;x'_0&amp;y'_0\\
x_1&amp;y_1&amp;x'_1&amp;y'_1\\
x_2&amp;y_2&amp;x'_2&amp;y'_2\\
x_3&amp;y_3&amp;x'_3&amp;y'_3\end{vmatrix}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

When the lines are skew, the sign of the result indicates the sense of crossing: positive if a right-handed screw takes ''L'' into ''L''&amp;prime;, else negative.

The quadratic Plücker relation essentially states that a line is coplanar with itself.

=== Line-line join ===
In the event that two lines are coplanar but not parallel, their common plane has equation

: 0 = ('''''m'''''•'''''d'''''&amp;prime;)''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ('''''d'''''×'''''d'''''&amp;prime;)•'''''x''''' ,

where '''''x'''''&amp;nbsp;= (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).

The slightest perturbation will destroy the existence of a common plane, and near-parallelism of the lines will cause numeric difficulties in finding such a plane even if it does exist.

=== Line-line meet ===
Dually, two coplanar lines, neither of which contains the origin, have common point

: (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; : '''''x''''') = ('''d'''•'''m'''&amp;prime;:'''m'''×'''m'''&amp;prime;) .

To handle lines not meeting this restriction, see the references.

=== Plane-line meet ===
Given a plane with equation

: &lt;math&gt; 0 =  a^0x_0 + a^1x_1 + a^2x_2 + a^3x_3 , &lt;/math&gt;

or more concisely 0&amp;nbsp;= ''a''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;+'''''a'''''•'''''x'''''; and given a line not in it with Plücker coordinates ('''''d''''':'''''m'''''), then their point of intersection is

: (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; : '''''x''''') = ('''''a'''''•'''''d''''' : '''''a'''''×'''''m''''' − ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'''''d''''') .

The point coordinates, (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;:''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;:''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), can also be expressed in terms of Plücker coordinates as

: &lt;math&gt; x_i = \sum_{j \ne i} a^j p_{ij} , \qquad i = 0 \ldots 3 . &lt;/math&gt;

=== Point-line join ===
Dually, given a point (''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;:'''''y''''') and a line not containing it, their common plane has equation

: 0 = ('''''y'''''•'''''m''''') ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ('''''y'''''×'''''d'''''−''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'''''m''''')•'''''x''''' .

The plane coordinates, (''a''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;:''a''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;:''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), can also be expressed in terms of dual Plücker coordinates as

: &lt;math&gt; a^i = \sum_{j \ne i} y_j p^{ij} , \qquad i = 0 \ldots 3 . &lt;/math&gt;

=== Line families ===
Because the [[Klein quadric]] is in '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, it contains linear subspaces of dimensions one and two (but no higher). These correspond to one- and two-parameter families of lines in '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

For example, suppose ''L'' and ''L''&amp;prime; are distinct lines in '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; determined by points '''x''', '''y''' and '''x'''&amp;prime;, '''y'''&amp;prime;, respectively. Linear combinations of their determining points give linear combinations of their Plücker coordinates, generating a one-parameter family of lines containing ''L'' and ''L''&amp;prime;. This corresponds to a one-dimensional linear subspace belonging to the Klein quadric.

==== Lines in plane ====
If three distinct and non-parallel lines are coplanar; their linear combinations generate a two-parameter family of lines, all the lines in the plane. This corresponds to a two-dimensional linear subspace belonging to the Klein quadric.

==== Lines through point ====
If three distinct and non-coplanar lines intersect in a point, their linear combinations generate a two-parameter family of lines, all the lines through the point. This also corresponds to a two-dimensional linear subspace belonging to the Klein quadric.

==== Ruled surface ====
A [[ruled surface]] is a family of lines that is not necessarily linear. It corresponds to a curve on the Klein quadric. For example, a [[hyperboloid of one sheet]] is a quadric surface in '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ruled by two different families of lines, one line of each passing through each point of the surface; each family corresponds under the Plücker map to a [[conic section]] within the Klein quadric in '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;.

=== Line geometry ===
During the nineteenth century, ''line geometry'' was studied intensively. In terms of the bijection given above, this is a description of the intrinsic geometry of the Klein quadric.

==== Ray tracing ====
Line geometry is extensively used in [[Ray_tracing_(graphics)|ray tracing]] application where the geometry and intersections of rays need to be calculated in 3D. An implementation is described in
[http://www.flipcode.com/archives/Introduction_To_Plcker_Coordinates.shtml Introduction to Plücker Coordinates] written for the Ray Tracing forum by Thouis Jones.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9493">The '''Rule of Law in Armed Conflicts Project''' ('''RULAC Project''') is an initiative of the [[Geneva Academy of International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights]] to support the application and implementation of the [[Public international law|international]] [[Laws of war|law of armed conflict]].

==Overview==
Through a global [[database]] and analysis, the RULAC Project has as its aim an assessment of the implementation by [[Sovereign state|states]] of the law applicable in armed conflicts: 
*[[international humanitarian law]] 
*[[international human rights law]]
*[[international criminal law]]
*[[refugee law]]

The project will ultimately cover all [[List of United Nations member states|member states of the United Nations]] and parties to the [[Geneva Conventions]] as well as contested territories, whether they are in situation of armed conflict or not. Indeed, certain international rules must be implemented during peacetime or are relevant in post-conflict situations, in particular those relating to the repression of international crimes. In addition, the rules regarding the fight against [[terrorism]], also to be covered by the website, are applicable to states that are not necessarily in a situation of armed conflict.

The website is divided into three parts. The homepage offers a small description of the applicable law and addresses the main legal issues in that area, for example the legal qualification of conflicts or the applicability of international law to non-state armed groups. The website then offers for each country the relevant texts and documents dealing with the national and international legal framework (national [[legislation]] and [[case law]], [[Resolution (law)|resolutions]] of [[intergovernmental organizations]], [[treaty]], etc.). Finally, the website offers a legal analysis that, on one hand, qualifies the conflict under international humanitarian law and on the other hand, determines the applicable law. This part of the website, certainly the most delicate in juridical and political terms, is particular to the RULAC Project.

The RULAC Project should prove to be a precious source of information for government officials, journalists and more widely for any person interested by the respect of the law in war.

==Geneva Conventions==
The first three Geneva Conventions were revised, expanded, and replaced, and the fourth one was added, in 1949.

* The Geneva Convention ''for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field'' was adopted in 1864. It was significantly revised and replaced by the 1906 version,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/INTRO/180?OpenDocument |title=Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armies in the Field. Geneva, 6 July 1906 |publisher=[[International Committee of the Red Cross]] |accessdate=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armies in the Field (1929)|1929 version]], and later the [[First Geneva Convention]] of 1949.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cil.nus.edu.sg/1949/1949-geneva-convention-i-for-the-amelioration-of-the-condition-of-the-wounded-and-sick-in-armed-forces-in-the-field/ 1949 Geneva Convention (I) for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221161712/http://cil.nus.edu.sg/1949/1949-geneva-convention-i-for-the-amelioration-of-the-condition-of-the-wounded-and-sick-in-armed-forces-in-the-field/ |date=2014-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Geneva Convention ''for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea'' was adopted in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The International Committee of the Red Cross: A Neutral Humanitarian Actor |date=June 17, 2007 |author=David P. Forsythe |page=43 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=0-4153-4151-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was significantly revised and replaced by the [[Second Geneva Convention]] of 1949.
* The [[Geneva Convention (1929)|Geneva Convention ''relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War'' was adopted in 1929]]. It was significantly revised and replaced by the [[Third Geneva Convention]] of 1949.
* The [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] ''relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War'' was adopted in 1949.

In addition, there are three additional amendment protocols to the Geneva Convention:
* [[Protocol I]] (1977): Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts. As of 12 January 2007 it had been ratified by 167 countries.
* [[Protocol II]] (1977): Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts. As of 12 January 2007 it had been ratified by 163 countries.
* [[Protocol III]] (2005): Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Adoption of an Additional Distinctive Emblem. As of June 2007 it had been ratified by 17 countries and signed but not yet ratified by an additional 68 countries.

{{Catholic philosophy}}
The ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' defines [[virtue]] as "a habitual and firm disposition to do the [[good]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccc.usccb.org/flipbooks/catechism/index.html#461/z Catechism of the Catholic Church, §1803]&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, the '''seven Christian virtues''' or '''heavenly virtues''' combine the four classical [[cardinal virtues]] of [[prudence]], [[Justice (virtue)|justice]], [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]] and [[courage]] (or fortitude) with the three [[theological virtues]] of [[Faith in Christianity|faith]], [[Hope (virtue)|hope]] and [[Charity (virtue)|charity]]. These were adopted by the [[Church Fathers]] as the seven virtues.

==Cardinal virtues==
{{Main|Cardinal virtues}}
The Greek philosophers [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]], regarded temperance, wisdom, justice, and courage as the four most desirable character traits. The [[Book of Wisdom]] is one of the seven [[Sapiential Books]] included in the [[Septuagint]]. Wisdom 8:7 states that the fruits of Wisdom "...are virtues; For she teaches moderation and prudence, justice and fortitude, and nothing in life is more useful for men than these."

The moral virtues are attitudes, dispositions, and good habits that govern one's actions, passions, and conduct according to reason; and are acquired by human effort.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccc.usccb.org/flipbooks/catechism/index.html#461/z CCC §1804]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immanuel Kant]] said, "Virtue is the moral strength of the will in obeying the dictates of duty".&lt;ref name=Rickaby&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06147a.htm Rickaby, John. "Fortitude." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 6. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 6 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The cardinal virtues are prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance.

* '''Prudence''' from {{lang|la|prudentia}} meaning "seeing ahead, sagacity") is the ability to govern and discipline oneself by the use of [[reason]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prudence Prudence – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary]. Merriam-webster.com (2012-08-31).&lt;/ref&gt; It is called the ''Auriga virtutum'' (the charioteer of the virtues) as it guides the other virtues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccc.usccb.org/flipbooks/catechism/index.html#462/z CCC §1806]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Justice''' is the virtue which regulates man in his dealings with others. Connected to justice are the virtues of [[Religion (virtue)|religion]], piety, and gratitude. &lt;ref name=Waldron&gt;{{catholic|title=Virtue|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm|last=Waldron|firtst=Martin Augustine|volume=15|year=1912|accessdate=6 April 2017|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Fortitude''' which [[Thomas Aquinas]] ranks third after prudence and justice and equates with brave endurance.&lt;ref name=Rickaby/&gt; Patience and perseverance are virtues related to fortitude.
* '''Temperance''' is the virtue which moderates in accordance with reason the desires and pleasures of the sensuous appetite. Related to temperance are the virtues of continence, humility, and meekness.&lt;ref name=Waldron/&gt;

Philosophers recognized the interrelatedness of the virtues such that courage without prudence risks becoming mere foolhardiness. Aquinas found an interconnection of practical wisdom (''prudentia'') and moral virtue. This is frequently termed "the Unity of the Virtues."&lt;ref&gt;Annas, Julia. ''The Morality of Happiness'' (Oxford; Oxford University Press, 1993), pp. 73–84&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas also argued that it not only matters what a person does but how the person does it. The person must aim at a good end and also make a right choice about the means to that end. The moral virtues direct the person to aim at a good end, but to ensure that the person make the right choices about the means to a good end, one needs practical wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas. ''Commentary on the Nicomachean Ethics'', Book VI, Lecture XI, ##1279–1280&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theological virtues==
{{Main|Theological virtues}}
The traditional understanding of the differences in the natures of Cardinal and Theological virtues, is that the latter are not fully accessible to humans in their natural state without assistance from God. "All virtues have as their final scope to dispose man to acts conducive to his true happiness. The happiness, however, of which man is capable is twofold, namely, natural, which is attainable by man's natural powers, and supernatural, which exceeds the capacity of unaided human nature. Since, therefore, merely natural principles of human action are inadequate to a supernatural end, it is necessary that man be endowed with supernatural powers to enable him to attain his final destiny. Now these supernatural principles are nothing else than the theological virtues."&lt;ref name=Waldron/&gt;

==Seven virtues and the seven capital sins==

A list of seven virtues that oppose the [[seven deadly sins]] appeared later in an [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] titled  ''[[Psychomachia]]'', or ''Battle/Contest of the Soul''. Written by [[Prudentius|Aurelius Clemens Prudentius]], a Christian governor who died around 410 AD, it entails the battle between good virtues and evil [[vice]]s. The enormous popularity of this work in the [[Middle Ages]] helped to spread the concept of holy virtue throughout [[Europe]].

After Pope Gregory released his list of seven deadly sins in 590 AD, the seven virtues became identified as [[chastity]], [[temperance (virtue)|temperance]], [[Charity (practice)|charity]], [[diligence]], [[patience]], [[kindness]], and [[humility]]. Practicing them is said to protect one against [[temptation]] from the seven deadly sins.

It should be noted, however, that these seven virtues do not correspond to the seven heavenly virtues arrived at by combining the cardinal and theological virtues.  Furthermore, efforts in the Middle Ages to set the seven heavenly virtues in direct opposition to the seven capital sins are both uncommon and beset with difficulties. “[T]reatises exclusively concentrating on both septenaries are actually quite rare.” and “examples of late medieval catalogues of virtues and vices which extend or upset the double heptad can be easily multiplied.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Bejczy |first1= István P. |title= The Cardinal Virtues in the Middle Ages: A Study in Moral Thought from the Fourth to the Fourteenth Century |date=2011|publisher= Brill |location=Boston|pages=228, 229}}&lt;/ref&gt;  And there are problems with this parallelism.
{{quote|The opposition between the virtues and the vices to which these works allude despite the frequent inclusion of other schemes may seem unproblematic at first sight.  The virtues and the vices seem to mirror each other as positive and negative moral attitudes, so that medieval authors, with their keen predilection for parallels and oppositions, could conveniently set them against each other. . . . Yet artistic representations such as Conrad’s trees are misleading in that they establish oppositions between the principal virtues and the capital vices which are based on mere juxtaposition.  As to content, the two schemes do not match each other.  The capital vices of lust and avarice, for instance, contrast with the remedial virtues of chastity and generosity, respectively, rather than with any theological or cardinal virtue; conversely, the virtues of hope and prudence are opposed to despair and foolishness rather than to any deadly sin.  Medieval moral authors were well aware of the fact.  Actually, the capital vices are more often contrasted with the remedial or contrary virtues in medieval moral literature than with the principal virtues, while the principal virtues are frequently accompanied by a set of mirroring vices rather than by the seven deadly sins.&lt;ref&gt;Bejczy, 2011, pp. 232-33&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Given a [[size pair]]  &lt;math&gt;(M,f)\ &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;M\ &lt;/math&gt; is a [[manifold]] of dimension
&lt;math&gt;n\ &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f\ &lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary real [[continuous function]]  defined
on it, the &lt;math&gt;i\ &lt;/math&gt;-th '' size functor'',&lt;ref name="CaFePo01"&gt;Francesca Cagliari, Massimo Ferri, Paola Pozzi, ''Size functions from a categorical viewpoint'', Acta Applicandae Mathematicae, 67(3):225-235, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; with &lt;math&gt;i=0,\ldots,n\ &lt;/math&gt;, denoted
by &lt;math&gt;F_i\ &lt;/math&gt;, is the [[functor]] in &lt;math&gt;Fun(\mathrm{Rord},\mathrm{Ab})\ &lt;/math&gt;, where  &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Rord}\ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of  ordered real numbers, and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Ab}\ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of [[Abelian groups]], defined in the following way. For &lt;math&gt;x\le y\ &lt;/math&gt;, setting  &lt;math&gt;M_x=\{p\in M:f(p)\le x\}\ &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;M_y=\{p\in M:f(p)\le y\}\ &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;j_{xy}\ &lt;/math&gt; equal to the inclusion from &lt;math&gt;M_x\ &lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;M_y\ &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; k_{xy}\ &lt;/math&gt; equal to the [[morphism]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Rord}\ &lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;x\ &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;y\ &lt;/math&gt;,

* for each &lt;math&gt;x\in\R\ &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;F_i(x)=H_i(M_x);\ &lt;/math&gt;
*   &lt;math&gt;F_i(k_{xy})=H_i(j_{xy}).\ &lt;/math&gt;

In other words, the size functor  studies the
process of the birth and death of homology classes as the lower level set changes.
When &lt;math&gt;M\ &lt;/math&gt; is smooth and compact and &lt;math&gt;f\ &lt;/math&gt; is a Morse function, the functor &lt;math&gt;F_0\ &lt;/math&gt; can be
described by oriented trees, called &lt;math&gt;H_0\ &lt;/math&gt; − trees.

The concept of size functor was introduced as an extension to [[homology theory]] and [[category theory]] of the idea of [[size function]].  The main motivation for introducing the size functor originated  by the observation that the [[size function]] &lt;math&gt;\ell_{(M,f)}(x, y)\ &lt;/math&gt; can be seen as the rank
of the image of &lt;math&gt;H_0(j_{xy}) : H_0(M_x) \rightarrow H_0(M_y)&lt;/math&gt;.

The concept of size functor is strictly related to the concept of [[persistent homology group]]
,&lt;ref name="EdLeZo02"&gt;[[Herbert Edelsbrunner]], David Letscher, Afra Zomorodian, ''Topological Persistence and Simplification'', Discrete and Computational Geometry, 28(4):511-533, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
studied in [[persistent homology]]. It is worth to point out that the &lt;math&gt;i\ &lt;/math&gt;-th persistent homology group coincides with the image of the [[homomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;F_i(k_{xy})=H_i(j_{xy}): H_i(M_x) \rightarrow H_i(M_y)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Systems theory''' is the [[interdisciplinary]] study of [[system]]s. A system is a cohesive conglomeration of interrelated and interdependent parts that is either [[natural]] or [[man-made]]. Every system is delineated by its spatial and temporal boundaries, surrounded and influenced by its environment, described by its structure and purpose or nature and expressed in its functioning. In terms of its effects, a system can be more than the sum of its parts if it expresses [[synergy]] or [[emergent behavior]]. Changing one part of the system usually affects other parts and the whole system, with predictable patterns of behavior. For systems that are self-learning and self-adapting, the positive growth and adaptation depend upon how well the system is adjusted with its environment. Some systems function mainly to support other systems by aiding in the maintenance of the other system to prevent failure. The goal of systems theory is systematically discovering a system's dynamics, [[Theory of constraints|constraints]], conditions and elucidating principles (purpose, measure, methods, tools, etc.) that can be discerned and applied to systems at every level of nesting, and in every field for achieving optimized [[equifinality]].&lt;ref&gt;Beven, K. (2006). A manifesto for the equifinality thesis. Journal of hydrology, 320(1), 18-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

General systems theory is about broadly applicable concepts and principles, as opposed to concepts and principles applicable to one domain of knowledge. It distinguishes dynamic or active systems from static or passive systems. Active systems are activity structures or components that interact in behaviours and processes. Passive systems are structures and components that are being processed. E.g. a program is passive when it is a disc file and active when it runs in memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paolo Rocchi|title=Technology + Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2X17MLCjsKgC&amp;pg=PA8|year=2000|publisher=IOS Press|isbn=978-1-58603-035-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field is related to '''systems thinking''' and [[systems engineering]].

== Key concepts ==
* System: An organized entity made up of interrelated and interdependent parts.
* Boundaries: Barriers that define a system and distinguish it from other systems in the environment.
* Homeostasis: The tendency of a system to be resilient towards external factors and maintain its key characteristics.
* Adaptation: The tendency of a self-adapting system to make the internal changes needed to protect itself and keep fulfilling its purpose.
* Reciprocal Transactions: Circular or cyclical interactions that systems engage in such that they influence one another.
* Feedback Loop: The process by which systems self-correct based on reactions from other systems in the environment.
* Throughput: Rate of energy transfer between the system and its environment during the time it is functioning.
* Microsystem: The system closest to the client.
* Mesosystem: Relationships among the systems in an environment.
* Exosystem: A relationship between two systems that has an indirect effect on a third system.
* Macrosystem: A larger system that influences clients, such as policies, administration of entitlement programs, and culture.
* Chronosystem: A system composed of significant life events that can affect adaptation.

== Origin of the term ==
The term "general systems theory" originates from [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy|Bertalanffy]]'s [[#General systems research and systems inquiry|general systems theory]] (GST). His ideas were adopted by others including [[Kenneth E. Boulding]], [[William Ross Ashby]] and [[Anatol Rapoport]] working in mathematics, psychology, biology, game theory and [[social network analysis]].

Sociological systems thinking started earlier, in the 19th century.  Stichweh states:&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Badie et al. (eds.), ''International Encyclopedia of Political Science''. Sage New York.&lt;/ref&gt; "... Since its beginnings the [[social science]]s were an important part of the establishment of systems theory... the two most influential suggestions were the comprehensive sociological versions of systems theory which were proposed by [[Talcott Parsons]] since the 1950s and by [[Niklas Luhmann]] since the 1970s." References include Parsons' [[Action theory (sociology)|action theory]]&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Stichweh (2011) "[http://www.fiw.uni-bonn.de/demokratieforschung/personen/stichweh/pdfs/80_stw_systems-theory-international-encyclopedia-of-political-science_2.pdf Systems Theory]", in:y.&lt;/ref&gt; and Luhmann's social systems theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Luhmann|first=Niklas|title=Soziale Systeme: Grundriß einer allgemeinen Theorie|date=1984|publisher=Suhrkamp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Contemporary ideas from systems theory have grown with diverse areas, exemplified by the work of biologist [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]], linguist [[Béla H. Bánáthy]], sociologist [[Talcott Parsons]], ecological systems with [[Howard T. Odum]], [[Eugene Odum]] and [[Fritjof Capra]], [[organizational theory]] and [[management]] with individuals such as [[Peter Senge]], interdisciplinary study with areas like [[Human Resource Development]] from the work of [[Richard A. Swanson]], and insights from educators such as [[Debora Hammond]] and Alfonso Montuori. As a transdisciplinary, interdisciplinary and [[Multiperspectivalism|multiperspectival]] domain, the area brings together principles and concepts from [[ontology]], [[philosophy of science]], [[physics]], [[computer science]], [[biology]] and [[engineering]] as well as [[geography]], [[sociology]], [[political science]], [[psychotherapy]] (within [[family systems therapy]]) and [[economics]] among others. Systems theory thus serves as a bridge for interdisciplinary dialogue between autonomous areas of study as well as within the area of [[systems science]] itself.

In this respect, with the possibility of misinterpretations, von Bertalanffy&lt;ref&gt;Bertalanffy (1950: 142)&lt;/ref&gt; believed a general theory of systems "should be an important regulative device in science", to guard against superficial analogies that "are useless in science and harmful in their practical consequences". Others remain closer to the direct systems concepts developed by the original theorists. For example, [[Prigogine|Ilya Prigogine]], of [[the Center for Complex Quantum Systems]] at the University of Texas, Austin, has studied [[emergence|emergent properties]], suggesting that they offer [[analogy|analogues]] for [[life|living systems]]. The theories of [[autopoiesis]] of [[Francisco Varela]] and [[Humberto Maturana]] represent further developments in this field. Important names in contemporary systems science include [[Russell Ackoff]], [[Ruzena Bajcsy]], [[Béla H. Bánáthy]], [[Gregory Bateson]], [[Anthony Stafford Beer]], [[Peter Checkland]], [[Barbara Grosz]], [[Brian Wilson (systems scientist)|Brian Wilson]], [[Robert L. Flood]], [[Allenna Leonard]], [[Radhika Nagpal]], [[Fritjof Capra]], [[Warren McCulloch]], [[Kathleen Carley]], [[Michael C. Jackson]], [[Katia Sycara]], and [[Edgar Morin]] among others.

With the modern foundations for a general theory of systems following World War I, [[Ervin Laszlo]], in the preface for Bertalanffy's book: ''Perspectives on General System Theory'', points out that the [[translation]] of "general system theory" from German into English has "wrought a certain amount of havoc":&lt;ref name="Laszlo 1974"&gt;(Laszlo 1974)&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|It (General System Theory) was criticized as pseudoscience and said to be nothing more than an admonishment to attend to things in a holistic way. Such criticisms would have lost their point had it been recognized that von Bertalanffy's general system theory is a perspective or paradigm, and that such basic conceptual frameworks play a key role in the development of exact scientific theory. .. Allgemeine Systemtheorie is not directly consistent with an interpretation often put on 'general system theory,' to wit, that it is a (scientific) "theory of general systems." To criticize it as such is to shoot at straw men. Von Bertalanffy opened up something much broader and of much greater significance than a single theory (which, as we now know, can always be falsified and has usually an ephemeral existence): he created a new paradigm for the development of theories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isss.org/laszlofw.htm Forward by Ervin Laszlo] to Perspectives on GENERAL SYSTEM THEORY by Ludwig von Bertalanffy&lt;/ref&gt;}} "Theorie" (or "Lehre"), just as "Wissenschaft" (translated Scholarship), "has a much broader meaning in German than the closest English words 'theory' and 'science'".&lt;ref name="Laszlo 1974"/&gt; These ideas refer to an organized body of knowledge and "any systematically presented set of concepts, whether [[empirically]], [[axiomatically]], or [[philosophical]]ly" represented, while many associate "Lehre" with theory and science in the etymology of general systems, though it also does not translate from the German very well; its "closest equivalent" translates as "teaching", but "sounds dogmatic and off the mark".&lt;ref name="Laszlo 1974"/&gt;  While the idea of a "general systems theory" might have lost many of its root meanings in the translation, by defining a new way of thinking about science and [[Paradigm|scientific paradigms]], Systems theory became a widespread term used for instance to describe the interdependence of relationships created in [[organization]]s.

A system in this frame of reference can contain regularly interacting or interrelating groups of activities. For example, in noting the influence in organizational psychology as the field evolved from "an individually oriented [[industrial psychology]] to a systems and developmentally oriented [[organizational psychology]]", some theorists recognize that organizations have complex social systems; separating the parts from the whole reduces the overall effectiveness of organizations.&lt;ref&gt;(Schein 1980: 4-11)&lt;/ref&gt; This difference, from conventional models that center on individuals, structures, departments and units, separates in part from the whole, instead of recognizing the interdependence between groups of individuals, structures and processes that enable an organization to function. Laszlo&lt;ref&gt;Laslo (1972: 14-15)&lt;/ref&gt; explains that the new systems view of organized complexity went "one step beyond the Newtonian view of organized simplicity" which reduced the parts from the whole, or understood the whole without relation to the parts. The relationship between organisations and their [[environment (systems)|environments]] can be seen as the foremost source of complexity and interdependence. In most cases, the whole has properties that cannot be known from analysis of the constituent elements in isolation. [[Béla H. Bánáthy]], who argued—along with the founders of the systems society—that "the benefit of humankind" is the purpose of science, has made significant and far-reaching contributions to the area of systems theory. For the Primer Group at ISSS, Bánáthy defines a perspective that iterates this view:&lt;ref&gt;(Banathy 1997: ¶ 22)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=October 2016}}

{{quote|The systems view is a world-view that is based on the discipline of SYSTEM INQUIRY. Central to systems inquiry is the concept of SYSTEM. In the most general sense, system means a configuration of parts connected and joined together by a web of relationships. The Primer Group defines system as a family of relationships among the members acting as a whole. Von Bertalanffy defined system as "elements in standing relationship."}}

Similar ideas are found in learning theories that developed from the same fundamental concepts, emphasising how understanding results from knowing concepts both in part and as a whole. In fact, Bertalanffy's organismic psychology paralleled the learning theory of [[Jean Piaget]].&lt;ref name="GST"&gt;1968, General System theory: Foundations, Development, Applications, New York: George Braziller, revised edition 1976: {{ISBN|0-8076-0453-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some consider interdisciplinary perspectives critical in breaking away from [[industrial age]] models and thinking, wherein history represents history and math represents math, while the arts and sciences [[Academic specialization|specialization]] remain separate and many treat teaching as [[behaviorist]] conditioning.&lt;ref&gt;(see Steiss 1967; Buckley, 1967)&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary work of [[Peter Senge]]&lt;ref&gt;Peter Senge (2000: 27-49)&lt;/ref&gt; provides detailed discussion of the commonplace critique of educational systems grounded in conventional assumptions about learning, including the problems with fragmented knowledge and lack of holistic learning from the "machine-age thinking" that became a "model of school separated from daily life". In this way some systems theorists attempt to provide alternatives to, and evolved ideation from orthodox theories which have grounds in classical assumptions, including individuals such as [[Max Weber]] and [[Émile Durkheim]] in sociology and [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]] in [[scientific management]].&lt;ref&gt;(Bailey 1994: 3-8; see also Owens 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The theorists sought holistic methods by developing systems concepts that could integrate with different areas.

Some may view the contradiction of [[reductionism]] in conventional theory (which has as its subject a single part) as simply an example of changing assumptions. The emphasis with systems theory shifts from parts to the organization of parts, recognizing interactions of the parts as not static and constant but dynamic processes. Some questioned the conventional [[closed system]]s with the development of [[open system (systems theory)|open systems]] perspectives. The shift originated from [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute]] and universal authoritative principles and knowledge to relative and general [[concept]]ual and [[perceptual]] knowledge&lt;ref&gt;(Bailey 1994: 3-8)&lt;/ref&gt; and still remains in the tradition of theorists that sought to provide means to organize human life. In other words, theorists rethought the preceding [[history of ideas]]; they did not lose them. Mechanistic thinking was particularly critiqued, especially the industrial-age mechanistic [[metaphor]] for the mind from [[interpretation (philosophy)|interpretation]]s of [[Newtonian mechanics]] by [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophers and later psychologists that laid the foundations of modern organizational theory and management by the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;(Bailey 1994; Flood 1997; Checkland 1999; Laszlo 1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of applications==

===System dynamics===
{{Main|System dynamics}}
System dynamics is an approach to understanding the [[nonlinearity|nonlinear]] behaviour of [[complex system]]s over time using [[Stock and flow|stocks, flows]], internal [[feedback loop]]s, and time delays.&lt;ref name="sysdyn"&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/sysdyn/sd-intro/ MIT System Dynamics in Education Project (SDEP)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systems biology===
{{Main|Systems biology}}
Systems biology is a movement that draws on several trends in bioscience research. Proponents describe systems biology as a biology-based inter-disciplinary study field that focuses on complex interactions in [[biological system]]s, claiming that it uses a new perspective ([[holism]] instead of [[reductionist|reduction]]). Particularly from the year 2000 onwards, the [[biosciences]] use the term widely and in a variety of contexts. An often stated ambition of systems biology is the modelling and discovery of [[emergent property|emergent properties]] which represents properties of a system whose theoretical description requires the only possible useful techniques to fall under the remit of systems biology. It is thought that [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]] may have created the term systems biology in 1928.&lt;ref name="LVB1928"&gt;1928, Kritische Theorie der Formbildung, Borntraeger.

Systems ecology is an [[interdisciplinary]] field of [[ecology]], a subset of [[Earth system science]], that takes a [[holism|holistic]] approach to the study of ecological systems, especially [[ecosystem]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Shugart, Herman H., and Robert V. O'Neill. "Systems Ecology". Dowden, Hutchingon &amp; Ross, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Dyne, George M. "Ecosystems, Systems Ecology, and Systems Ecologists". ORNL- 3975.

Central to the systems ecology approach is the idea that an ecosystem is a [[complex system]] exhibiting [[emergent properties]]. Systems ecology focuses on interactions and transactions within and between biological and ecological systems, and is especially concerned with the way the functioning of ecosystems can be influenced by human interventions. It uses and extends concepts from [[thermodynamics]] and develops other macroscopic descriptions of complex systems.

===Systems engineering===
{{Main|Systems engineering}}
[[Systems engineering]] is an [[interdisciplinary]] approach and means for enabling the realisation and deployment of successful [[system]]s. It can be viewed as the application of engineering techniques to the engineering of systems, as well as the application of a systems approach to engineering efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Thomé | first = Bernhard | authorlink = | date = 1993 | title = Systems Engineering: Principles and Practice of Computer-based Systems Engineering | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | location = Chichester| isbn = 0-471-93552-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Systems engineering integrates other disciplines and specialty groups into a team effort, forming a structured development process that proceeds from concept to production to operation and disposal. Systems engineering considers both the business and the technical needs of all customers, with the goal of providing a quality product that meets the user's needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=INCOSE|author-link=INCOSE |url=http://www.incose.org/practice/whatissystemseng.aspx|title=What is Systems Engineering|accessdate=2006-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Blockley David, Godfrey Patrick ''Doing it Differently: Systems for Rethinking Infrastructure (2nd Edition)'' ICE Publishing, London, {{ISBN|978-0-7277-6082-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systems psychology===
{{Main|Systems psychology}}
Systems psychology is a branch of [[psychology]] that studies [[human behaviour]] and [[experience]] in [[complex system]]s. It received inspiration from systems theory and systems thinking, as well as the basics of theoretical work from [[Roger Barker]], [[Gregory Bateson]], [[Humberto Maturana]] and others. It makes an approach in [[psychology]] in which groups and individuals receive consideration as [[systems]] in [[homeostasis]]. Systems psychology "includes the domain of [[engineering psychology]], but in addition seems more concerned with societal systems and with the study of motivational, affective, cognitive and group behavior that holds the name engineering psychology."&lt;ref&gt;Lester R. Bittel and Muriel Albers Bittel (1978), ''Encyclopedia of Professional Management'', McGraw-Hill, {{ISBN|0-07-005478-9}}, p.498.&lt;/ref&gt; In systems psychology, "characteristics of [[organizational behaviour]], for example individual needs, rewards, [[Expectation (epistemic)|expectation]]s, and attributes of the people interacting with the [[systems]], considers this process in order to create an effective system".&lt;ref&gt;Michael M. Behrmann (1984), ''Handbook of Microcomputers in Special Education''. College Hill Press. {{ISBN|0-933014-35-X}}. Page 212.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether considering the first systems of written communication with [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] [[cuneiform]] to [[Maya numerals|Mayan numerals]], or the feats of engineering with the [[Egyptian pyramids]], systems thinking can date back to antiquity. Differentiated from Western [[rationalist]] traditions of philosophy, C. West Churchman often identified with the [[I Ching]] as a systems approach sharing a frame of reference similar to [[pre-Socratic]] philosophy and [[Heraclitus]].&lt;ref&gt;(Hammond 2003: 12-13)&lt;/ref&gt; Von Bertalanffy traced systems concepts to the philosophy of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|G.W. Leibniz]] and [[Nicholas of Cusa]]'s ''[[Coincidentia oppositorum#Coincidentia oppositorum|coincidentia oppositorum]]''. While modern systems can seem considerably more complicated, today's systems may embed themselves in history.

Figures like [[James Prescott Joule|James Joule]] and [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] represent an important step to introduce the ''systems approach'' into the (rationalist) [[Hard Science|hard sciences]] of the 19th century, also known as the [[energy transformation]]. Then, the [[thermodynamics]] of this century, by [[Rudolf Clausius]], [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|Josiah Gibbs]] and others, established the ''system'' [[reference model]] as a formal scientific object.

The [[Society for General Systems Research]] specifically catalyzed systems theory as an area of study, which developed following the World Wars from the work of [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]], [[Anatol Rapoport]], [[Kenneth E. Boulding]], [[William Ross Ashby]], [[Margaret Mead]], [[Gregory Bateson]], [[C. West Churchman]] and others in the 1950s, had specifically catalyzed by collaboration in. Cognizant of advances in science that questioned classical assumptions in the organizational sciences, Bertalanffy's idea to develop a theory of systems began as early as the interwar period, publishing "An Outline for General Systems Theory" in the ''British Journal for the Philosophy of Science'', Vol 1, No. 2, by 1950. Where assumptions in Western science from Greek thought with [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] to [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' have historically influenced all areas from the hard to social sciences (see [[David Easton]]'s seminal development of the "[[political system]]" as an analytical construct), the original theorists explored the implications of twentieth century advances in terms of systems.

People have studied subjects like [[complexity]], [[self-organization]], [[connectionism]] and [[adaptive systems]] in the 1940s and 1950s. In fields like cybernetics, researchers such as [[Norbert Wiener]], [[William Ross Ashby]], [[John von Neumann]] and [[Heinz von Foerster]], examined complex systems mathematically. [[John von Neumann]] discovered [[cellular automata]] and self-reproducing systems, again with only pencil and paper. [[Aleksandr Lyapunov]] and [[Jules Henri Poincaré]] worked on the foundations of [[chaos theory]] without any [[computer]] at all. At the same time [[Howard T. Odum]], known as a radiation ecologist, recognized that the study of general systems required a language that could depict [[energetics]], [[thermodynamics]] and [[Kinetics (physics)|kinetics]] at any system scale. Odum developed a general system, or [[universal language]], based on the circuit language of [[electronics]], to fulfill this role, known as the [[Energy Systems Language]]. Between 1929-1951, [[Robert Maynard Hutchins]] at the [[University of Chicago]] had undertaken efforts to encourage innovation and interdisciplinary research in the social sciences, aided by the [[Ford Foundation]] with the interdisciplinary Division of the Social Sciences established in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;Hammond 2003: 5-9&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous scholars had actively engaged in these ideas before ([[Tectology]] by [[Alexander Bogdanov]], published in 1912-1917, is a remarkable example), but in 1937, von Bertalanffy presented the general theory of systems at a conference at the University of Chicago.

The systems view was based on several fundamental ideas. First, all phenomena can be viewed as a web of relationships among elements, or a [[system]]. Second, all systems, whether [[electrical]], [[biological]], or [[social system|social]], have common [[patterns]], [[behaviors]], and [[properties]] that the observer can analyze and use to develop greater insight into the behavior of complex phenomena and to move closer toward a unity of the sciences. System philosophy, methodology and application are complementary to this science.&lt;ref name="Laszlo 1974"/&gt; By 1956, theorists established the [[Society for General Systems Research]], which they renamed the International Society for Systems Science in 1988. The Cold War affected the research project for systems theory in ways that sorely disappointed many of the seminal theorists. Some began to recognize that theories defined in association with systems theory had deviated from the initial General Systems Theory (GST) view.&lt;ref&gt;Hull 1970&lt;/ref&gt; The economist [[Kenneth Boulding]], an early researcher in systems theory, had concerns over the manipulation of systems concepts. Boulding concluded from the effects of the Cold War that abuses of [[Political power|power]] always prove consequential and that systems theory might address such issues.&lt;ref&gt;(Hammond 2003: 229-233)&lt;/ref&gt; Since the end of the Cold War, a renewed interest in systems theory emerged, combined with efforts to strengthen an [[ethical]]&lt;ref&gt;1968 Ludwig von Bertalanffy publishes General System theory: Foundations, Development, Applications&lt;/ref&gt; view on the subject.

==Developments==

===General systems research and systems inquiry===
Many early systems theorists aimed at finding a general systems theory that could explain all systems in all fields of science. The term goes back to [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy|Bertalanffy]]'s book titled "''General System theory: Foundations, Development, Applications''" from 1968.&lt;ref name="GST"/&gt; He developed the "allgemeine Systemlehre" (general systems theory) first via lectures beginning in 1937 and then via publications beginning in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Ludwig von Bertalanffy]]: ''... aber vom Menschen wissen wir nichts'', (English title: Robots, Men and Minds), translated by Dr. Hans-Joachim Flechtner. page 115. Econ Verlag GmbH (1970), Düsseldorf, Wien. 1st edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Bertalanffy's objective was to bring together under one heading the organismic science he had observed in his work as a biologist. His desire was to use the word ''system'' for those principles that are common to systems in general. In GST, he writes:

{{quote|...there exist models, principles, and laws that apply to generalized systems or their subclasses, irrespective of their particular kind, the nature of their component elements, and the relationships or "forces" between them. It seems legitimate to ask for a theory, not of systems of a more or less special kind, but of universal principles applying to systems in general.|Von Bertalanffy&lt;ref&gt;(GST p.32)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ervin Laszlo&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projects.isss.org/perspectives_on_general_system_theory|title=start [ProjectsISSS]|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the preface of von Bertalanffy's book ''Perspectives on General System Theory'':&lt;ref&gt;von Bertalanffy, Ludwig, (1974) ''Perspectives on General System Theory'' Edited by Edgar Taschdjian. George Braziller, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Thus when von Bertalanffy spoke of Allgemeine Systemtheorie it was consistent with his view that he was proposing a new perspective, a new way of doing science. It was not directly consistent with an interpretation often put on "general system theory", to wit, that it is a (scientific) "theory of general systems." To criticize it as such is to shoot at straw men. Von Bertalanffy opened up something much broader and of much greater significance than a single theory (which, as we now know, can always be falsified and has usually an ephemeral existence): he created a new paradigm for the development of theories.}}

Ludwig von Bertalanffy outlines systems inquiry into three major domains: Philosophy, Science, and Technology. In his work with the Primer Group, Béla H. Bánáthy generalized the domains into four integratable domains of systemic inquiry:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Domain
!Description
|-
|Philosophy
|the [[ontology]], [[epistemology]] and [[axiology]] of systems
|-
|Theory
|a set of interrelated concepts and principles applying to all systems
|-
|Methodology
|the set of models, strategies, methods and tools that instrumentalize systems theory and philosophy
|-
|Application
|the application and interaction of the domains
|}

These operate in a recursive relationship, he explained. Integrating Philosophy and Theory as Knowledge, and Method and Application as action, Systems Inquiry then is knowledgeable action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projects.isss.org/Main/SystemsInquiry|title=start [ProjectsISSS]|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cybernetics===
{{Main|Cybernetics}}

Cybernetics is the study of the [[communication]] and control of regulatory [[feedback]] both in living and lifeless systems (organisms, organizations, machines), and in combinations of those. Its focus is how anything (digital, mechanical or biological) controls its behavior, processes information, reacts to information, and changes or can be changed to better accomplish those three primary tasks.

The terms "systems theory" and "cybernetics" have been widely used as synonyms. Some authors use the term ''cybernetic'' systems to denote a proper subset of the class of general systems, namely those systems that include [[feedback]] loops. However [[Gordon Pask]]'s differences of eternal interacting actor loops (that produce finite products) makes general systems a proper subset of cybernetics. According to Jackson (2000), von Bertalanffy promoted an embryonic form of general system theory (GST) as early as the 1920s and 1930s but it was not until the early 1950s it became more widely known in scientific circles.

Threads of cybernetics began in the late 1800s that led toward the publishing of seminal works (e.g., Wiener's ''Cybernetics'' in 1948 and von Bertalanffy's ''General Systems Theory'' in 1968). Cybernetics arose more from engineering fields and GST from biology. If anything it appears that although the two probably mutually influenced each other, cybernetics had the greater influence. Von Bertalanffy (1969) specifically makes the point of distinguishing between the areas in noting the influence of cybernetics: "Systems theory is frequently identified with cybernetics and control theory. This again is incorrect. Cybernetics as the theory of control mechanisms in technology and nature is founded on the concepts of information and feedback, but as part of a general theory of systems;" then reiterates: "the model is of wide application but should not be identified with 'systems theory' in general", and that "warning is necessary against its incautious expansion to fields for which its concepts are not made." (17-23). Jackson (2000) also claims von Bertalanffy was informed by [[Alexander Bogdanov]]'s three volume ''[[Tectology]]'' that was published in Russia between 1912 and 1917, and was translated into German in 1928. He also states it is clear to Gorelik (1975) that the "conceptual part" of general system theory (GST) had first been put in place by Bogdanov. The similar position is held by [[Richard Mattessich|Mattessich]] (1978) and Capra (1996). Ludwig von Bertalanffy never even mentioned Bogdanov in his works, which Capra (1996) finds "surprising".

Cybernetics, [[catastrophe theory]], [[chaos theory]] and [[Complex systems#Complexity and chaos theory|complexity theory]] have the common goal to explain complex systems that consist of a large number of mutually interacting and interrelated parts in terms of those interactions. Cellular automata (CA), neural networks (NN), artificial intelligence (AI), and [[artificial life]] (ALife) are related fields, but they do not try to describe general (universal) complex (singular) systems. The best context to compare the different "C"-Theories about complex systems is historical, which emphasizes different tools and methodologies, from pure mathematics in the beginning to pure computer science now. Since the beginning of chaos theory when [[Edward Lorenz]] accidentally discovered a [[strange attractor]] with his computer, computers have become an indispensable source of information. One could not imagine the study of complex systems without the use of computers today.

===Complex adaptive systems===
{{Main|Complex adaptive system}}
Complex adaptive systems (CAS) are special cases of [[complex system]]s. They are ''complex'' in that they are diverse and composed of multiple, interconnected elements; they are ''adaptive'' in that they have the capacity to change and learn from experience. In contrast to control systems in which [[negative feedback]] dampens and reverses disequilibria, CAS are often subject to [[positive feedback]], which magnifies and perpetuates changes, converting local irregularities into global features. Another mechanism, [[Dual-phase evolution]] arises when connections between elements repeatedly change, shifting the system between phases of variation and selection that reshape the system. Differently from Beer [[Management cybernetics|Management Cybernetics]], [[Cultural Agency Theory]] (CAT) provides a modelling approach to explore predefined contexts and can be adapted to reflect those contexts.

The term ''complex adaptive system'' was coined at the interdisciplinary [[Santa Fe Institute]] (SFI), by [[John Henry Holland|John H. Holland]], [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and others. An alternative conception of complex adaptive (and learning) systems, methodologically at the interface between natural and social science, has been presented by [[Kristo Ivanov]] in terms of [[Kristo Ivanov#Hypersystems|hypersystems]]. This concept intends to offer a theoretical basis for understanding and implementing participation of "users", decisions makers, designers and affected actors, in the development or maintenance of self-learning systems.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kristo Ivanov|Ivanov, K.]] (1993).

Ancient [[Nahuatl]] people believed that it was located in the hair and the [[fontanel]] area of one’s skull, and that the tonalli provided the “vigor and energy for growth and development”.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carrasco|first1=David|title=Religions of Mesoamerica|date=2014|publisher=Waveland Press|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; It often overlaps with the force of teyolía which was often considered both an animating force ([[soul]]) and the physical heart in various [[Mesoamerican]] [[cultures]].

== Etymology ==
The root “tona” acts as a verb to mean "to irradiate or make warm with sun”.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carrasco|first1=David|title=Religions of Mesoamerica|date=2014|publisher=Waveland Press|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mythology ==
In the Ancient Nahuatl belief, the tonalli is bestowed upon a child in utero by the aged [[deities]] known as [[Ometecuhtli]] and [[Omecihuatl]], or the “Lord and Lady of Duality”.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Furst|first1=Jill Leslie McKeever|title=The Natural History of the Soul in Ancient Mexico|date=1995|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implementation of tonalli is conducted through a process known as Fire Drilling.
[[File:Fire Drilling.JPG|thumb|Drilling with a stick on an upright base to make smoke and fire. Post classic Mixtec, Oaxaca]]
It is believed that the old deities, Ometecuhtli and Omecihuatl transferred tonalli to human fetuses by “simultaneously breath[ing] the tonalli into the child and ignit[ing] a fire in its chest”.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Furst|first1=Jill Leslie McKeever|title=The Natural History of the Soul in Ancient Mexico|date=1995|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Fire Drilling process involves an upright wooden piece being twirled rapidly on a flat base. It produces heat through friction, although this seemingly simple instrument requires considerable skill to make anything but smoke. The fire maker blows on an ignited spark to fan it into a vigorous flame, and the breathing (or blowing air) and friction in the chest animate an infant.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; The Franciscan friars connected this idea of Fire Drilling, namely, the conception of tonalli as breath, to [[Christianity]] as the infusion of breath into the body recalls the beginning of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], where God the Father breathes life into Adam.

== The human body ==
The Nahuatl people of Mesoamerica believed that the soul comprised three [[entities]]: Tonalli, Teyolía, and Ihíyotl, three souls in the body. Tonalli is located in fontanel area of the skull. Teyolía is located in the heart and Ihíyotl is in the liver. Each of these souls has its own functions and protective deities. But there are important differences. The Tonalli is the soul that enters and leaves the body. In [[Atla, Sierra de Puebla|Atla]] in the northern Sierra de Puebla, the inhabitants believe this is the soul that travels while you sleep at night, and then comes back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Montoya Briones|first1=Jose de Jesus|title=Atla: Etnografia de un Pueblo Nahuatl|date=1964|publisher=Mexico City: INAH|location=Mexico City|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the soul that leaves and comes back every time you sneeze, or whenever you yawn, or even when you are startled. The Nahua believed that it was not good to sneeze and keep talking, because it causes your tonalli to leave and once your Tonalli leaves, you have to wait for a period of time before it returns. At that moment, anything can enter your body. However, the soul of the heart (Teyolía) and the soul of the liver (Ihiíyotl) only leave your body when you die; those two souls will exit only at the exact moment of your death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Diana|last2=Constantino|first2=Roselyn|title=Holy Terrors: Latin American Women Perform.''Nahuatlismo: The Aztec Method''|date=2003|publisher=Duke University Press|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tonalli in the blood ===
Along with the heart, the ancient [[Mexica]] took blood from sacrificed prisoners and offered its fructifying force to the gods. On public and private ritual occasions, people drew blood from their ears, tongues, or calves, splattered it on pieces of native paper, and gave it to the spirits as tokens of thanks for benefits received or as requests for future favors. The gods could be coaxed or rewarded, less by the physical fluid itself than by the tonalli (life force) it carried and transferred to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Furst|first1=Jill Leslie McKeever|title=The Natural History of the Soul in Ancient Mexico|date=1995|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|pages=128–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among most modern Nahuatl speakers, the state of the life force may even be determined from the movement of blood in the body, whether this movement is experienced as a tic, a pulse, or a muscular movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Furst|first1=Jill Leslie McKeever|title=The Natural History of the Soul in Ancient Mexico|date=1995|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; When blood drains from its proper course, the person loses his/her life force, and, essentially, soul.

== Ritual ==
[[File:Warrior Grabbing Captive in Perceived Location of Tonalli.JPG|thumb|Warrior who has taken a captive by the hair. This is a symbolic representation of seizing the captive's tonalli. Early colonial Central Mexico.]]

=== War and human sacrifice ===
Tonalli was highly valued in society and sought after in warfare and ritual sacrifice. The hair that covered the head, especially the fontanel area, was a major receptacle of tonalli, and it was believed that hair prevented the tonalli from leaving the body. During times of war, when a warrior would take a prisoner captive, the warrior would often seize the captive by the hair (the fontanel area). It was believed that the fortitude and valor of a warrior resided, in part, in the hair, and there are many pictorial scenes showing Aztec warriors grabbing the hair of enemies. The hair of warriors captured in battle was kept by the captors in order to increase their tonalli. The severed heads of enemy warriors were a supreme prize for the city, which gained more tonalli through the ceremonial use of heads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carrasco|first1=David|title=Religions of Mesoamerica|date=2014|publisher=Waveland Press|pages=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tonalli embedded within skulls of enemy warriors and captives were also offered as gifts to the gods in the temple complexes. This was believed to be an offering to the gods in the form of a type of debt repayment.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

=== Social practices ===
The [[essence]] of tonalli was a force that  could transcend the limits of the human body. Parts of the tonalli could reside outside the body in objects and animals. For example, tlacopatli beads were often left in the temple and represented a substitute for a child unable to go to the temple school, due to age restrictions. These beads served to contain the tonalli and do penitence for the underaged child.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{cite book|last1=López|first1=Austin Alfredo|title=Relationship of the Essences. ''Tamoanchan, Tlalocan: Places of Mist''|date=1997|publisher=Niwot, CO: U of Colorado|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; This points to the belief of the physicality of the soul and the embodiment of the tonalli. Stones were also used as repositories of the soul in a different sense. As tonalli was considered to be an indication of destiny or fate, the possession of [[gemstones]] served as direct evidence of those with positive [[fate]]s despite low births and the auspicious destinies of members of the elite class.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;
[[File:Figure with 20 Day Signs.JPG|thumb|Figure with 20 day signs of ancient Mexica attached to parts of the body in place of the astrological signs assigned to them in Europe.]]

== Tonalli co-essences ==
The tonalli operated within a complex that involved the god of the birth date and the human. The soul of the individuality of a person, resided inside; but the god of the tonalli resided outside&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=López|first1=Austin Alfredo|title=Relationship of the Essences. ''Tamoanchan, Tlalocan: Places of Mist''|date=1997|publisher=Niwot, CO: U of Colorado|location=Colorado|pages=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The co-essence of tonalli in a human body is subject to the power of an external god/time that could lodge in a person’s body. The dynamics of this joint essence relationship made it necessary for humans to implore each god of birth dates for internal strength, health and good fortune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=López|first1=Austin Alfredo|title=Relationship of the Essences. ''Tamoanchan, Tlalocan: Places of Mist''|date=1997|publisher=Niwot, CO: U of Colorado|location=Colorado|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Animating quality of tonalli ==
Tonalli, along with ''teyolia'' and ''ihiyotl'', was believed to direct the [[physiological]] process of the human body. It gave a person character, and was highly valued by the family and sought after in [[warfare]] and ritual [[sacrifice]]. It was believed that tonalli could be taken from a human body and either offered to the gods as a form of debt payment or acquired by the ritual person who touched the physical entity in which they resided.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The concept of tonalli was not only limited to human beings. It infiltrated animals, gods, plants, and objects used in rituals.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

=== Astrological signs ===
The tonalli also determines the sign under which a person is born and informs [[Luck|fortune]], character, and name. Tonalli conveyed [[astrological signs]] and names through birthdays, and in the [[Mexica]] [[divinatory]] system, a person’s birthday fell on one of the 260 name days in a special [[calendar]]. Individuals followed the path or code of conduct demanded by the tonalli and the day sign. This calendar was notable because it was used solely for divination and celebrating rituals in the deities’ honor. The calendrical name of a given person transmitted a character and fate to both men and women. A person born on the first day of the 260-day cycle, would be named One Crocodile and was given a positive character that would bring about authority, wealth, and fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Furst|first1=Jill Leslie McKeever|title=The Natural History of the Soul in Ancient Mexico|date=1995|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that inauspicious day signs could be ameliorated through rituals such as first baths, and life events.

== Free will ==
It was believed that individuals possess free will within the constraints imposed by their tonalli. One is born with either favorable or unfavorable tonalli and with a corresponding predetermined character. While this places certain constraints upon what one may accomplish, one freely chooses what to make of one's tonalli within these limits. Someone born with favorable tonalli may squander it through improper action; someone with unfavorable tonalli may neutralize its adverse effects through knowledge of the [[sacred]] calendar and careful selection of actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maffie|first1=James|title=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=iep.utm.edu/aztec/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Soul loss ==
As an animating force within both the human and [[Supernatural|spiritual]] world, retaining tonalli provides consciousness and personality. The concept of soul loss was inherent to the ancient Central Mexican understanding of [[aging]] and [[death]]. The loss of tonalli, in its various stages, is known by states in which the person suffers slowed, impaired, or complete loss of consciousness. As the understanding of tonalli is reliant upon conceptions of warmth, heat, and the sun, the absence of tonalli is felt as fluctuations in internal temperature. The inability to re-implant the life force leads to a decline in health and ultimately death. The modern Nahua and the Mexica have identified the tonalli’s departure as the cause of illnesses with the same general and observable symptoms as death and dying.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

'''Type II partnerships''' were developed at the [[Earth Summit 2002|Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development]] in 2002. Arising in opposition to the [[State (polity)|state]]-centred [[Ecogovernmentality|eco-governmentality]] of previous approaches to [[sustainable development]] policy, the partnerships facilitate the inclusion of private and civil [[Actor (policy debate)|actors]] into the management of sustainable development. The partnerships are employed alongside traditional [[Intergovernmentalism|intergovernmental]] mechanisms in order to effectively implement the United Nations' [[Agenda 21]] and [[Millennium Development Goals]], particularly at sub-national level. Although widely acknowledged as one of the most innovative and effective developments in global [[environmental governance]] in recent years, the partnerships have faced criticism due to fears of a lack of [[accountability]], and the risk that they may exacerbate inequalities of power between Northern and Southern states. Despite these reservations, there is a general consensus among state and non-governmental actors that Type II partnerships are a significantly progressive step in global environmental governance in general, and sustainable development [[discourse]] in particular.&lt;ref name="Witte"&gt;{{cite book|last=Witte|first=J.M.|title=or Peril? Networks and Partnerships in Global Environmental Governance|year=2003|publisher=Global Public Policy Institute|location=Washington D.C.|authorlink=The Road from Johannesburg: What Future for Partnerships in Global Environmental Governance?|author2=Streck, C. |author3=Benner, T. |editor=T. Benner |editor2=C. Streck |editor3=J.M. Witte}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background and development==

First proposed at the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002, Type II partnerships are characterised by collaborations between national or sub-national governments, private sector actors and civil society actors, who form [[Voluntariness|voluntary]] transnational agreements in order to meet specific sustainable development goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baker|first=Susan|title=Sustainable Development|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Johannesburg negotiations also produced so-called Type I outcomes referred to under the umbrella of a Global Deal, a series of legally binding intergovernmental commitments designed to aid states in the implementation of sustainable development goals.&lt;ref name="Death"&gt;{{cite book|last=Death|first=Carl|title=Governing Sustainable Development: Partnerships, Protests and Power at the World Summit|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the discussions preceding the summit, a growing consensus emerged among the actors involved that traditional intergovernmental relations were no longer sufficient in the management of sustainable development, and consequently the talks began to incorporate suggestions for increasingly [[Decentralisation|decentralised]] and [[Participation (decision making)|participatory]] approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Von Moltke|first=K|title=Governments and International Civil Society in Sustainable Development: A Framework|journal=International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics|year=2002|volume=2|issue=4|pages=341–359|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/r357283n24j85mr1/|accessdate=10 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considered to be one of the most innovative and celebrated outcomes of the 2002 summit, the partnerships were created as a means by which to further implement the sustainable development goals set out in the Agenda 21 action plan, particularly those objectives aimed at the local and regional level, as traditional Type I intergovernmental strategies were deemed unlikely to effectively achieve lower level implementation of the Agenda 21 plan.&lt;ref name="UNESCAP"&gt;{{cite book|last=UNESCAP|title=Regional Follow-Up to the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific|year=2003|publisher=United Nations Publications|location=Italy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Johannesburg negotiations concluded that Type II partnerships must meet seven key criteria: i) they should be voluntary and based on shared responsibility, ii) they must complement, rather than substitute, intergovernmental sustainable development strategies, and must meet the agreed outcomes of the Johannesburg summit, iii) they must consist of a range of multi-level [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]], preferably within a given area of work, iv) they must ensure [[Transparency (social)|transparency]] and accountability, v) they must produce tangible results, vi) the partnership must be new, and adequate funding must be available, and vii) a follow-up process must be developed. If these requirements were successfully fulfilled, it was hoped that Type II partnerships could create a fundamental shift in sustainable development discourse, leading to an increasingly participatory, bottom-up method of governing the issue.&lt;ref name="UNESCAP"/&gt;

== Implementation and management==

Following the Johannesburg summit, the [[United Nations Commission for Sustainable Development]] was granted responsibility for the management of Type II partnerships as its [[:wikt:mandate|mandate]] and focus were considered most appropriate to the supervision of the partnerships. The UNCSD was created following the [[Earth Summit|1992 Rio summit]] with the sole mandate of overseeing the implementation of Agenda 21 and the [[Rio Declaration on Environment and Development]], a focus which made the UNCSD highly amenable to the management of Type II agreements. The UNCSD supervises the 300+ Type II partnerships formed as a result of the summit, ensuring that the partnerships continue to implement the sustainable development goals agreed at Johannesburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bull|first=B|title=International Handbook on Public-Private Partnerships|year=2011|publisher=Edward Elgar|location=Cheltenham|authorlink=Public-Private Partnerships: The United Nations Experience|editor=G.A. Hodge |editor2=C. Greve |editor3=A.E. Boardman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of one of the larger partnerships supervised by the UNCSD is the [[Global Water Partnership]], a network of over 2,300 global partners composed of organisations including UN agencies, governments of developed and developing countries, development banks, research institutions, [[NGOs]] and private actors. The organisation aims to diffuse information regarding water management to stakeholders at all levels, and assists countries in the development of water management strategies at the local, national and global level, increasing the capacity of developing nations to manage water supplies in the long term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Global Water Partnership|title=About GWP|url=http://www.gwp.org/en/About-GWP/|accessdate=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role in environmental governance==

=== Transition from government to governance===

&lt;blockquote&gt;''“This Summit will be remembered not for the treaties, commitments, or eloquent declarations it produced, but for the first stirrings of a new way of governing the global commons, the beginnings of a shift from the stiff formal waltz of traditional diplomacy to the jazzier dance of improvisational solution oriented partnerships that may include non-government organizations, willing governments and other stakeholders.”'' World Resources Institute, 2002&lt;ref name="WRI"&gt;{{cite web|last=World Resources Institute|title=The Johannesburg Summit- News Release|url=http://archive.wri.org/newsroom/wrifeatures_text.cfm?ContentID=371|accessdate=11 May 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807172431/http://archive.wri.org/newsroom/wrifeatures_text.cfm?ContentID=371|archivedate=7 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The dominance of Type II partnerships as a primary outcome of the Johannesburg summit represented a fundamental shift in the governing of sustainable development; a transition from the top-down, government-centred method favoured by the [[Brundtland Report]] and at the 1992 Rio summit, to a collaborative, multi-stakeholder approach which acknowledged the importance of the economic and social expertise of non-governmental actors in sustainable development initiatives. Immediately prior to the summit, then- UN Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]] predicted that whilst [[governments]] would be responsible for the creation of a common plan of action for sustainable development, the most significant and powerful agents of change to emerge from the Johannesburg negotiations would be Type II partnerships, through which the UN hoped to harness the technological, financial and scientific resources of partners involved in the agreements, reinvigorating the organisation's pursuit of sustainable development.&lt;ref name="Death"/&gt;

The UN guidelines for Type II partnerships specified that the agreements should be complementary to, not an alternative to, intergovernmental action plans for sustainable development. As opposed to developing the partnerships as a method of 'governing without government', the agreements were designed to govern alongside traditional government approaches. Rather than treating Type II partnerships as a [[panacea]] for sustainable development, it was hoped that such participatory multi-stakeholder governance mechanisms would increase the flexibility and enhance the implementation of sustainable development policy in collaboration with states and international organisations. After the Johannesburg summit, the concept of environmental governance was no longer understood as a legalistic function performed solely by governments, but rather as a collaborative, informal approach to the management of environmental issues, involving both state and non-governmental actors. This new understanding demonstrates that the changing approach to sustainable development which arose from the Johannesburg summit influenced a much wider shift in global environmental governance.&lt;ref name="Witte"/&gt;

==== Competing rationalities of government====

Within a [[Michel Foucault|Foucauldian]] context, the Type I and Type II arguments presented in the summit negotiations represent two fundamentally opposing [[Governmentality|rationalities of government]]. The [[Interventionism (politics)|interventionist]], state-centric approach to sustainable development favoured by advocates of the Global Deal represents a rationality of government which Foucault&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foucault|first=Michel|title=The Will to Knowledge: The History of Sexuality, vol. 1|year=1998|publisher=Penguin|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; identified as [[Biopolitics|bio-politics]]; the application of political power in an attempt to control or modify life processes. Such an approach to the pursuit of sustainable development offers little opportunity for participation by private or civil actors, in direct contrast to the multi-stakeholder premise of Type II partnerships. The eco-governmental, disciplinary ideas conveyed in the Global Deal suggest that the Type I approach typifies the centralised [[command-and-control]] method favoured by traditional government, whereas the decentralised, voluntary nature of Type II partnerships demonstrates an advanced liberal governmentality which empowers non-state actors to undertake responsibility for the governing of sustainable development, an approach which is representative of the participatory, multi-stakeholder methods by which governance is characterised.&lt;ref name="Death"/&gt; The eventual dominance of Type II partnerships in the outcomes of the Johannesburg summit therefore symbolises a wider shift in the understanding of the purposes, ends and means of government in relation to sustainable development and environmental governance.

However, Mert&lt;ref name="Mert"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mert|first=A|title=Partnerships for sustainable development as discursive practice: Shifts in discourses of environment and democracy|journal=Forest Policy and Economics|year=2009|volume=11|issue=5–6|pages=326–339|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VT4-4V1V4W8-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=10%2F31%2F2009&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=gateway&amp;_origin=gateway&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=15ccd8bbaafc4015ed26846ca6267eb1&amp;searchtype=a|accessdate=14 May 2011|doi=10.1016/j.forpol.2008.10.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; questions the compatibility of partnerships with the global governance of sustainable development. The partnerships represented a point of intersection between three previously separate political discourses; [[participatory democracy]], [[private governance]], and sustainable development, altering the dynamics of global environmental governance processes. The shift towards voluntary [[Mechanism (sociology)|mechanisms]] as opposed to international regulation could prove problematic as legally binding [[Legal framework|frameworks]] are sometimes the most appropriate solution to the governance of environmental problems. A [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] approach to sustainable development discourse could demonstrate greater effectiveness in the management of the issue than a fragmented, partnership-driven approach which could lead to inconsistent and conflicting management of such a global issue.&lt;ref name="Mert"/&gt;

=== Transnational governance networks===

Type II partnerships exemplify a growing reliance on public-private-civil co-operation in environmental governance. The architects of the summit placed an emphasis on discussions which would encourage the creation of multi-stakeholder partnerships with the objective of fulfilling UN sustainable development goals, acknowledging that traditional intergovernmental agreements were inadequate to sufficiently promote sustainable development.&lt;ref name="AndonovaLevy"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Andonova|first=L.B.|author2=Levy, M.A.|title=Franchising Global Governance: Making Sense of the Johannesburg Type II Partnerships|journal=Yearbook of International Co-operation on Environment and Development 2003/04|year=2003|url=http://web-prod.iheid.ch/webdav/site/iheid/shared/iheid/800/andonova/Andonova-Levy2.pdf|accessdate=5 May 2011}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, state actors were notoriously unwilling to improve international environmental co-operation prior to the Johannesburg summit, leaving those who sought a positive outcome to the WSSD to search for alternative solutions which incorporated a broader variety of actors.&lt;ref name="Andonova"&gt;{{cite book|title=International Organisations in Global Environmental Governance|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon|author=Andonova, L.B.|authorlink=International Organisations as Entrepreneurs of Environmental Partnerships|editor1=F. Biermann |editor2=B. Siebenhüner |editor3=A. Schreyögg }}&lt;/ref&gt; Type II partnerships emerged as the dominant outcome of the Johannesburg summit, highlighting their importance as agents of change in the achievement of sustainable development. The partnerships were considered by advocates to be representative of a new era of environmental governance, characterised by collaborative decision-making and shared responsibility between public, private and civil actors in the management of [[International|transnational]] public issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Partnerships, Governance and Sustainable Development: Reflections on Theory and Practice|year=2007|publisher=Edward Elgar|location=Cheltenham|author=Glasbergen, P.|authorlink=Setting the Scene: The Partnership Paradigm in the Making|editor=P. Glasbergen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of Type II partnerships marked the emergence of a broader phenomenon within environmental governance- the introduction of [[Network governance|transnational governance networks]] in the management of global environmental issues. Transnational governance networks combine actors from the public, private and civil sectors in the pursuit of common practices and ideas.&lt;ref name="Andonova"/&gt; The role of networks of private and civil actors in transboundary communication is not novel to the academic community; however, the emphasis on transnational public-private-civil networks as mechanisms for achieving sustainable development during the Johannesburg negotiations led to recognition of the ability of such networks to integrate private and civil actors into the global environmental governance process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=J|title=Environmental Governance|year=2011|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transnational governance networks address a number of shortcomings in traditional state-centred approaches to the management of transboundary issues such as sustainable development. They can diffuse information to the public perhaps more effectively than governments or international organisations, particularly when such information requires a degree of technical expertise to deliver, such as the transfer of specialised knowledge from the private sector to industry groups regarding sustainable business practices. They can also facilitate the implementation of global management strategies at the local level, and they may potentially close the participation gap in global environmental governance by involving private and civil actors in decision-making processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Biermann|first=F |author2=Chan, M-S. |author3=Mert, A. |author4=Pattberg, P. |title=Multi-stakeholder Partnerships for Sustainable Development: Does the Promise Hold?|journal=Paper presented at the 2007 Amsterdam Conference on the Human Dimensions of Global Environmental Change|year=2007|url=http://www.2007amsterdamconference.org/Downloads/AC2007_%20BiermannChanMertPattberg.pdf|accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reframing of sustainable development discourse===

The Johannesburg summit represented a further shift in the governing of sustainable development; rather than considering environmental issues in isolation, as had previously been common practice within sustainable development policy, the Johannesburg negotiations concluded that a reframing of sustainable development discourse, which re-conceptualised sustainable development as a dynamic interaction between three interdependent pillars- society, environment and economy- was necessary in order to pursue a more [[holistic]] ideal of sustainable development. This reframing of sustainable development required Type II partnerships to address a broader concept of sustainable development, and consequently objectives such as poverty alleviation and community involvement feature alongside environmental issues in the objectives of the partnerships.&lt;ref name="Death"/&gt;

== Issues==

=== Imbalances of power===

Although designed to incorporate a broader range of social, environmental and economic perspectives into the environmental governance process and to facilitate the inclusion of actors from all levels into decision-making, the extent to which imbalances of power between actors involved in the partnerships affects their implementation has provoked concern among their critics.&lt;ref name="AndonovaLevy"/&gt;

Brinkerhoff and Brinkerhoff&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brinkerhoff|first=D.W.|author2=Brinkerhoff, J.M. |title=Partnerships between international donors and non-governmental development organizations: opportunities and constraints|journal=Review of Administrative Sciences|year=2004|volume=70|issue=2|pages=253–270|url=http://ras.sagepub.com/content/70/2/253.short|accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; theorised that an effective partnership must fulfil two essential criteria: mutuality- interdependence and equality between partners, and organisational identity- the equal maintenance of each partner’s missions and goals. In the event of a partnership between Northern and Southern actors, for example, the North will inevitably contribute greater financial and material resources to the partnership than the South, creating a power inequality which may enable the North to assume control of the partnership and impairing the mutuality necessary for the partnership to function successfully.&lt;ref name="Blagescu"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blagescu|first=M.|author2=Young, J. |title=Partnerships and Accountability: Current thinking and approaches among agencies supporting Civil Society Organisations|journal=ODI Working Paper no. 255|year=2005|url=http://kms1.isn.ethz.ch|accessdate=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concern was reflected by a number of developing nations who formed a coalition to lobby against the development of Type II partnerships, fearing that the partnerships would award too much authority over sustainable development to the global North, whilst simultaneously reducing the responsibility of industrialised nations to develop and implement legally binding intergovernmental management strategies.&lt;ref name="Witte"/&gt;

In order to maintain mutuality, it is therefore essential that the definition of a contribution within Type II partnerships is extended beyond financial and material resources, and includes knowledge, skills and other relevant strengths which can be incorporated to redress the balance of power within the partnership.&lt;ref name="Blagescu"/&gt;

=== Accountability===

Critics of Type II partnerships have expressed concern that the initiative is simply a means by which to deflect accountability for sustainable development management from states and international organisations. The United States, a nation infamously opposed to state-led environmental governance as evidenced by their withdrawal from the [[Kyoto protocol]], strongly supported the development of Type II partnerships whilst continuing to oppose Type I outcomes, leading to concern that some nations may view Type II partnerships as an opportunity to deflect attention from a lack of state-level progress in the management of sustainable development. An emphasis on Type II partnerships, it is argued, could therefore be exploited by nations who wish to avoid accountability for the management of sustainable development and environmental issues, transferring responsibility for such issues to private actors who are less accountable to the needs of those affected by the problem in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Survival For a Small Planet|year=2004|publisher=Earthscan|location=London|author=Bigg, T.|authorlink=The World Summit on Sustainable Development: Was It Worth It?|editor=T. Bigg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ensuring of accountability and transparency is a key criterion of Type II partnerships; however, the diverse multi-stakeholder composition of the partnerships negates the use of traditional accountability methods, such as the introduction of a centralised authority charged with maintaining the accountability of the partners involved in Type II agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hale|first=T.N.|author2=Mauzerall, D.L. |title=Thinking Globally and Acting Locally: Can the Johannesburg Partnerships Coordinate Action on Sustainable Development?|journal=Journal of Environment and Development|year=2004|volume=13|issue=3|pages=220–239|url=http://jed.sagepub.com/content/13/3/220.short|accessdate=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bäckstrand&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bäckstrand|first=K|title=Democratizing Global Environmental Governance?

== Discussion==

The Type II partnerships developed at the Johannesburg summit demonstrated a paradigm-shifting impact upon sustainable development discourse and the conceptualisation of global environmental governance. By addressing the limitations of the state-centric, top-down method which typified environmental governance prior to Johannesburg and facilitating the participation of private and civil actors in the governing of sustainable development, the partnerships became emblematic of the transition from command-and-control government to the informal, participatory governance mechanisms by which global environmental governance is now classified. Furthermore, the partnerships exemplify the use of transnational governance networks as a mechanism by which to implement environmental policy at local and regional level. Such factors led the World Resources Institute&lt;ref name="WRI"/&gt; to declare the partnerships representative of a ‘new era’ of environmental governance.

However, considering the flaws inherent in the partnerships, it is crucial that advocates of the agreements resist the temptation to consider them a magic bullet with which every shortcoming of a centralised approach to environmental governance can be addressed. Although advantageous in terms of increased flexibility and effective lower-level implementation of policies, partnerships lack the internal and external accountability of intergovernmental strategies, and may intensify power inequalities between the industrialised North and developing South. The decision of the UN to introduce Type II partnerships as complementary governance mechanism is therefore the most appropriate application of the partnerships, as the dynamic interaction between intergovernmental strategies and voluntary public-private-civil partnerships can potentially produce a far greater positive impact upon global environmental governance than the sum of its parts.

'''Unix time''' (also known as '''POSIX time'''{{cn|date=July 2017}} or '''UNIX Epoch time'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beginning Linux Programming|last=Matthew|first=Neil|last2=Stones|first2=Richard|publisher=Wiley|year=2008|isbn=978-0-470-14762-7|location=Indianapolis, Indiana, US|pages=148|chapter=The Linux Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a system for describing a point in [[time]].

However, Unix time is not a true representation of UTC, as a leap second in UTC shares the same Unix time as the second which came before it. Unix time may be checked on most Unix systems by typing {{code|date +%s}} on the command line.

On systems where the representation of Unix time is as a signed 32-bit number, the representation will end after the completion of {{val|2147483647}} (2&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; − 1) seconds from 00:00:00 on 1 January 1970, which will happen at 3:14:08 on 19 January 2038 UTC, although exactly how many seconds that is from now is not known because of unpredictable leap seconds. This is referred to as the ''[[Year 2038 problem]]'' where the 32-bit signed Unix time will overflow and will take the actual count to negative.

==Definition==
Two layers of encoding make up Unix time. The first layer encodes a point in time as a [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] [[real number]] which represents the number of seconds that have passed since the beginning of 00:00:00 UTC Thursday, 1 January 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.epochconverter.com/|title=Epoch Converter - Unix Timestamp Converter|website=Epoch Converter|language=en|access-date=2017-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second layer encodes that number as a sequence of bits or decimal digits.

As is standard with UTC, this article labels days using the [[Gregorian calendar]], and counts times within each day in hours, minutes, and seconds. Some of the examples also show [[International Atomic Time]] (TAI), another time scheme, which uses the same seconds and is displayed in the same format as UTC, but in which every day is exactly {{val|86400}} seconds long, gradually losing [[synchronization]] with the Earth's rotation at a rate of roughly one second per year.

===Encoding time as a number===
Unix time is a single signed number which increments every second, without requiring the calculations to determine year, month, day of month, hour and minute required for intelligibility to humans.

The ''Unix [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]]'' is the time 00:00:00{{nbsp}}UTC on 1 January 1970. There is a problem with this definition, in that UTC did not exist in its current form until 1972; this issue is discussed below. For brevity, the remainder of this section uses [[ISO 8601]] date and time format, in which the Unix epoch is 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.

The Unix time number is zero at the Unix epoch, and increases by exactly {{val|86400}} per day since the epoch. Thus 2004-09-16T00:00:00Z, {{val|12677}} days after the epoch, is represented by the Unix time number {{val|12677}} × {{val|86400}} = {{val|1095292800}}. This can be extended backwards from the epoch too, using negative numbers; thus 1957-10-04T00:00:00Z, {{val|4472}} days before the epoch, is represented by the Unix time number {{val|−4472}} × {{val|86400}} = {{val|−386380800}}.

Within each day, the Unix time number is calculated as in the preceding paragraph at midnight UTC (00:00:00Z), and increases by exactly 1 per second since midnight. Thus 2004-09-16T17:55:43.54Z, {{val|64543.54}} seconds since midnight on the first day in the example above, is represented by the Unix time number {{val|1095292800}} + {{val|64543.54}} = {{val|1095357343.54}}. On dates before the epoch the number still increases, thus becoming less negative, as time moves forward.

Because Unix time is based on the Unix epoch, it is sometimes referred to as ''epoch time''.

===Leap seconds===
The above scheme means that on a normal UTC day, which has a duration of {{val|86400}} seconds, the Unix time number changes in a [[continuous function|continuous]] manner across midnight. For example, at the end of the day used in the examples above, the time representations progress as follows:

When a [[leap second]] occurs, the UTC day is not exactly {{val|86400}} seconds long and the Unix time number (which always increases by exactly {{val|86400}} each day) experiences a [[discontinuity (mathematics)|discontinuity]]. At the end of a day with a negative leap second, which has not yet occurred, the Unix time number would jump up by 1 to the start of the next day. During a positive leap second at the end of a day, which occurs about every year and a half on average, the Unix time number increases continuously into the next day during the leap second and then at the end of the leap second jumps back by 1 (returning to the start of the next day). For example, this is what happened on strictly conforming POSIX.1 systems at the end of 1998:

Unix time numbers are repeated in the second immediately following a positive leap second. The Unix time number {{val|915148800.50}} is thus ambiguous: it can refer either to the instant in the middle of the leap second, or to the instant one second later, half a second after midnight UTC. In the theoretical case when a negative leap second occurs, no ambiguity is caused, but instead there is a range of Unix time numbers that do not refer to any point in time at all.

A Unix clock is often implemented with a different type of positive leap second handling associated with the [[Network Time Protocol]] (NTP). This yields a system that does not conform to the POSIX standard. See the section below concerning NTP for details.

When dealing with periods that do not encompass a UTC leap second, the difference between two Unix time numbers is equal to the duration in seconds of the period between the corresponding points in time. This is a common computational technique. However, where leap seconds occur, such calculations give the wrong answer. In applications where this level of accuracy is required, it is necessary to consult a table of leap seconds when dealing with Unix times, and it is often preferable to use a different time encoding that does not suffer from this problem.

A Unix time number is easily converted back into UTC by taking the quotient and modulus of the Unix time number, modulo {{val|86400}}. The quotient is the number of days since the epoch, and the modulus is the number of seconds since midnight UTC on that day. If given a Unix time number that is ambiguous due to a positive leap second, this algorithm interprets it as the time just after midnight. It never generates a time that is during a leap second. If given a Unix time number that is invalid due to a negative leap second, it generates an equally invalid UTC time. If these conditions are significant, it is necessary to consult a table of leap seconds to detect them.

====Non-synchronous Network Time Protocol-based variant====
Commonly a [[David L. Mills|Mills]]-style Unix clock is implemented with leap second handling not synchronous with the change of the Unix time number. The time number initially decreases where a leap should have occurred, and then it leaps to the correct time 1 second after the leap. This makes implementation easier, and is described by Mills' paper.&lt;ref name="eeci_TheN"&gt;{{Cite web | title = The NTP Timescale and Leap Seconds | last = Mills | first = David L. | work = eecis.udel.edu | date = 12 May 2012 | accessdate = 2017-08-21 | url = https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/leap.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is what happens across a positive leap second:

This can be decoded properly by paying attention to the leap second state variable, which unambiguously indicates whether the leap has been performed yet. The state variable change is synchronous with the leap.

A similar situation arises with a negative leap second, where the second that is skipped is slightly too late. Very briefly the system shows a nominally impossible time number, but this can be detected by the '''TIME_DEL''' state and corrected.

In this type of system the Unix time number violates POSIX around both types of leap second. Collecting the leap second state variable along with the time number allows for unambiguous decoding, so the correct POSIX time number can be generated if desired, or the full UTC time can be stored in a more suitable format.

The decoding logic required to cope with this style of Unix clock would also correctly decode a hypothetical POSIX-conforming clock using the same interface. This would be achieved by indicating the '''TIME_INS''' state during the entirety of an inserted leap second, then indicating '''TIME_WAIT''' during the entirety of the following second while repeating the seconds count. This requires synchronous leap second handling. This is probably the best way to express UTC time in Unix clock form, via a Unix interface, when the underlying clock is fundamentally untroubled by leap seconds.

====TAI-based variant====
{{Disputed section|Does any system really keep a time as a pure linear count of seconds elapsed since 1970-01-01T00:00:00 *TAI*?|date=April 2016}}
Another, much rarer, non-conforming variant of Unix time keeping involves encoding TAI rather than UTC; some Linux systems are configured this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Time Scales|url=http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Support/TimeScales|work=Network Time Protocol Wiki|accessdate=2013-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because TAI has no leap seconds, and every TAI day is exactly 86400 seconds long, this encoding is actually a pure linear count of seconds elapsed since 1970-01-01T00:00:00{{nbsp}}TAI. This makes time interval arithmetic much easier. Time values from these systems do not suffer the ambiguity that strictly conforming POSIX systems or NTP-driven systems have.

In these systems it is necessary to consult a table of leap seconds to correctly convert between UTC and the pseudo-Unix-time representation. This resembles the manner in which time zone tables must be consulted to convert to and from [[civil time]]; the [[IANA time zone database]] includes leap second information, and the sample code available from the same source uses that information to convert between TAI-based time stamps and local time. Conversion also runs into definitional problems prior to the 1972 commencement of the current form of UTC (see section [[Unix time#UTC basis|UTC basis]] below).

This TAI-based system, despite its superficial resemblance, is not Unix time. It encodes times with values that differ by several seconds from the POSIX time values, and does not have the simple mathematical relationship to UTC that is mandated by POSIX.

===Representing the number===
A Unix time number can be represented in any form capable of representing numbers. In some applications the number is simply represented textually as a string of decimal digits, raising only trivial additional problems. However, certain binary representations of Unix times are particularly significant.

The Unix &lt;!-- time_t meaning time type is a C type name. DO NOT REPLACE time_t WITH time t!!! --&gt;&lt;tt&gt;[[time t|time_t]]&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;!-- DO NOT REPLACE time_t WITH time t!!! --&gt; data type that represents a point in time is, on many platforms, a [[Integer (computer science)|signed integer]], traditionally of 32{{nbsp}}[[bit]]s (but see below), directly encoding the Unix time number as described in the preceding section. Being 32 bits means that it covers a range of about 136 years in total. The minimum representable time is Friday 1901-12-13, and the maximum representable time is Tuesday 2038-01-19. One second after 03:14:07{{nbsp}}UTC 2038-01-19 this representation will [[arithmetic overflow|overflow]]. This milestone is anticipated with a mixture of amusement and dread—see [[year 2038 problem]].

In some newer operating systems, &lt;tt&gt;time_t&lt;/tt&gt; has been widened to 64 bits. This expands the times representable by approximately 293 billion years in both directions, which is over twenty times the present [[age of the universe]] per direction.

There was originally some controversy over whether the Unix &lt;tt&gt;time_t&lt;/tt&gt; should be signed or unsigned. If unsigned, its range in the future would be doubled, postponing the 32-bit overflow (by 68 years). However, it would then be incapable of representing times prior to the epoch. The consensus is for &lt;tt&gt;time_t&lt;/tt&gt; to be signed, and this is the usual practice. The software development platform for version 6 of the [[QNX]] operating system has an unsigned 32-bit &lt;tt&gt;time_t&lt;/tt&gt;, though older releases used a signed type.

The [[POSIX]] and [[Open Group]] Unix specifications include the [[C standard library]], which includes the time types and functions defined in the [[time.h|&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;time.h&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;]] header file. The ISO C standard states that &lt;tt&gt;time_t&lt;/tt&gt; must be an arithmetic type, but does not mandate any specific type or encoding for it. POSIX requires &lt;tt&gt;time_t&lt;/tt&gt; to be an integer type, but does not mandate that it be signed or unsigned.

Unix has no tradition of directly representing non-integer Unix time numbers as binary fractions. Instead, times with sub-second precision are represented using [[composite data type]]s that consist of two integers, the first being a &lt;tt&gt;time_t&lt;/tt&gt; (the integral part of the Unix time), and the second being the fractional part of the time number in millionths (in &lt;tt&gt;struct timeval&lt;/tt&gt;) or billionths (in &lt;tt&gt;struct timespec&lt;/tt&gt;). These structures provide a [[decimal]]-based [[Fixed-point arithmetic|fixed-point]] data format, which is useful for some applications, and trivial to convert for others.

===UTC basis===
The present form of UTC, with leap seconds, is defined only from 1 January 1972 onwards. Prior to that, since 1 January 1961 there was an older form of UTC in which not only were there occasional time steps, which were by non-integer numbers of seconds, but also the UTC second was slightly longer than the SI second, and periodically changed to continuously approximate the Earth's rotation. Prior to 1961 there was no UTC, and prior to 1958 there was no widespread [[atomic clock|atomic timekeeping]]; in these eras, some approximation of [[GMT]] (based directly on the Earth's rotation) was used instead of an atomic timescale.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

The precise definition of Unix time as an encoding of UTC is only uncontroversial when applied to the present form of UTC. The Unix epoch predating the start of this form of UTC does not affect its use in this era: the number of days from 1 January 1970 (the Unix epoch) to 1 January 1972 (the start of UTC) is not in question, and the number of days is all that is significant to Unix time.

The meaning of Unix time values below {{val|+63072000}} (i.e., prior to 1 January 1972) is not precisely defined. The basis of such Unix times is best understood to be an unspecified approximation of UTC. Computers of that era rarely had clocks set sufficiently accurately to provide meaningful sub-second timestamps in any case. Unix time is not a suitable way to represent times prior to 1972 in applications requiring sub-second precision; such applications must, at least, define which form of UT or GMT they use.

{{As of|2009}}, the possibility of ending the use of leap seconds in civil time is being considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A likely means to execute this change is to define a new time scale, called ''International Time'', that initially matches UTC but thereafter has no leap seconds, thus remaining at a constant offset from TAI. If this happens, it is likely that Unix time will be prospectively defined in terms of this new time scale, instead of UTC. Uncertainty about whether this will occur makes prospective Unix time no less predictable than it already is: if UTC were simply to have no further leap seconds the result would be the same.

==Command line==
In [[Unix-like operating system]]s, &lt;code&gt;date&lt;/code&gt; is the command which will print or set the current time.&lt;ref&gt;{{man|cu|date}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The earliest versions of Unix time had a 32-bit integer incrementing at a rate of 60&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]], which was the rate of the system clock on the hardware of the early Unix systems. The value 60&amp;nbsp;Hz still appears in some software interfaces as a result. The epoch also differed from the current value. The first edition Unix Programmer's Manual dated 3 November 1971 defines the Unix time as "the time since 00:00:00, 1 January 1971, measured in sixtieths of a second".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Unix Programmer's Manual|edition=1st|url=https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/pdfs/man22.pdf|quote="''time'' returns the time since 00:00:00, 1 Jan. 1971, measured in sixtieths of a second."|date=1971-11-03|accessdate=2012-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The User Manual also commented that "the chronologically-minded user will note that 2**32 sixtieths of a second is only about 2.5 years". Because of this limited range, the epoch was redefined more than once, before the rate was changed to 1&amp;nbsp;Hz and the epoch was set to its present value of 1 January 1970 00:00:00 UTC. This yielded a range of about 136 years, though with more than half the range in the past (see discussion of signedness above).

As indicated by the definition quoted above, the Unix time scale was originally intended to be a simple linear representation of time elapsed since an epoch. However, there was no consideration of the details of time scales, and it was implicitly assumed that there was a simple linear time scale already available and agreed upon. The first edition manual's definition does not even specify which time zone is used. Several later problems, including the complexity of the present definition, result from Unix time having been defined gradually by usage rather than fully defined from the outset.

When [[POSIX#POSIX.1|POSIX.1]] was written, the question arose of how to precisely define &lt;tt&gt;time_t&lt;/tt&gt; in the face of leap seconds. The POSIX committee considered whether Unix time should remain, as intended, a linear count of seconds since the epoch, at the expense of complexity in conversions with civil time or a representation of civil time, at the expense of inconsistency around leap seconds. Computer clocks of the era were not sufficiently precisely set to form a precedent one way or the other.

The POSIX committee was swayed by arguments against complexity in the library functions,{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} and firmly defined the Unix time in a simple manner in terms of the elements of UTC time. This definition was so simple that it did not even encompass the entire [[leap year]] rule of the Gregorian calendar, and would make 2100 a leap year.

The 2001 edition of POSIX.1 rectified the faulty leap year rule in the definition of Unix time, but retained the essential definition of Unix time as an encoding of UTC rather than a linear time scale. Since the mid-1990s, computer clocks have been routinely set with sufficient precision for this to matter, and they have most commonly been set using the UTC-based definition of Unix time. This has resulted in considerable complexity in Unix implementations, and in the [[Network Time Protocol]], to execute steps in the Unix time number whenever leap seconds occur.

==Notable events in Unix time==
&lt;!-- new entries to this list are subject to removal unless accompanied by a citation establishing notability --&gt;

Unix enthusiasts have a history of holding "time_t parties" to celebrate significant values of the Unix time number.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2009/02/unix-lovers-to/ |accessdate=2013-08-09 |title=Unix Lovers to Party Like It's 1234567890 |magazine=Wired |last=Tweney |first=Dylan |date=12 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://slashdot.org/articles/05/03/17/169200.shtml?tid=130 |title=Slashdot {{!}} date +%s Turning 1111111111 |accessdate=2007-07-14 }}{{unreliable source?|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are directly analogous to the [[new year]] celebrations that occur at the change of year in many calendars. As the use of Unix time has spread, so has the practice of celebrating its milestones. Usually it is time values that are round numbers in [[decimal]] that are celebrated, following the Unix convention of viewing &lt;tt&gt;time_t&lt;/tt&gt; values in decimal. Among some groups round [[binary numeral system|binary]] numbers are also celebrated, such as +2&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; which occurred at 13:37:04 UTC on Saturday, 10 January 2004.

The events that these celebrate are typically described as "''N'' seconds since the Unix epoch", but this is inaccurate. As discussed above, due to the handling of leap seconds in Unix time, the number of seconds elapsed since the Unix epoch is slightly greater than the Unix time number for times later than the epoch.

'''Vapor pressure''' (or vapour pressure in British spelling) or '''equilibrium vapor pressure''' is defined as the [[pressure]] exerted by a [[vapor]] in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] with its [[Condensation|condensed]] [[Phase (matter)|phase]]s (solid or liquid) at a given temperature in a [[Thermodynamic system#Closed system|closed system]]. The equilibrium vapor pressure is an indication of a liquid's [[evaporation]] rate. It relates to the tendency of particles to escape from the liquid (or a solid). A substance with a high vapor pressure at normal temperatures is often referred to as ''[[volatility (chemistry)|volatile]]''. The pressure exhibited by vapor present above a liquid surface is known as vapor pressure. As the temperature of a liquid increases, the kinetic energy of its molecules also increases. As the kinetic energy of the molecules increases, the number of molecules transitioning into a vapor also increases, thereby increasing the vapor pressure.

The vapor pressure of any substance increases non-linearly with temperature according to the [[Clausius–Clapeyron relation]]. The [[atmospheric pressure]] [[boiling point]] of a liquid (also known as the [[normal boiling point]]) is the temperature at which the vapor pressure equals the ambient atmospheric pressure. With any incremental increase in that temperature, the vapor pressure becomes sufficient to overcome [[atmospheric pressure]] and lift the liquid to form vapor bubbles inside the bulk of the substance. [[liquid bubble|Bubble]] formation deeper in the liquid requires a higher temperature due to the higher fluid pressure, because fluid pressure increases above the atmospheric pressure as the depth increases. More important at shallow depths is the higher temperature required to start bubble formation. The surface tension of the bubble wall leads to an overpressure in the very small, initial bubbles. Thus, thermometer calibration should not rely on the temperature in boiling water.

The vapor pressure that a single component in a mixture contributes to the total pressure in the system is called [[partial pressure]]. For example, air at sea level, and saturated with water vapor at 20&amp;nbsp;°C, has partial pressures of about 2.3 kPa of water, 78 kPa of [[nitrogen]], 21 kPa of [[oxygen]] and 0.9 kPa of [[argon]], totaling 102.2 kPa, making the basis for [[atmosphere (unit)|standard atmospheric pressure]].

==Measurement and units==
Vapor pressure is measured in the standard units of [[pressure]]. The [[International System of Units]] (SI) recognizes pressure as a [[SI derived unit|derived unit]] with the dimension of force per area and designates the [[pascal (unit)|pascal]] (Pa) as its standard unit. One pascal is one [[newton (unit)|newton]] per [[square meter]] (N·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; or kg·m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;).

Experimental measurement of vapor pressure is a simple procedure for common pressures between 1 and 200 kPa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.capec.kt.dtu.dk/documents/overview/Vapor-pressure-Ruzicka.pdf |title=Vapor Pressure of Organic Compounds. Measurement and Correlation |author1=Růžička, K. |author2=Fulem, M. |author3=Růžička, V. |lastauthoramp=yes |access-date=2009-10-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226095004/http://www.capec.kt.dtu.dk/documents/overview/Vapor-pressure-Ruzicka.pdf |archive-date=2010-12-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most accurate results are obtained near the boiling point of substances and large errors result for measurements smaller than {{gaps|1|kPa}}. Procedures often consist of purifying the test substance, isolating it in a container, evacuating any foreign gas, then measuring the equilibrium pressure of the gaseous phase of the substance in the container at different temperatures. Better accuracy is achieved when care is taken to ensure that the entire substance and its vapor are at the prescribed temperature. This is often done, as with the use of an [[isoteniscope]], by submerging the containment area in a liquid bath.

Very low vapor pressures of solids can be measured using the [[Knudsen effusion cell]] method.

In a medical context, vapor pressure is sometimes expressed in other units, specifically [[Millimeter of mercury|millimeters of mercury (mmHg)]]. This is important for [[volatile anesthetics]], most of which are liquids at body temperature, but with a relatively high vapor pressure. Anesthetics with a higher vapor pressure at body temperature will be excreted more quickly, as they are exhaled from the lungs.

==Estimating vapor pressures with Antoine equation==

The [[Antoine equation]]&lt;ref name=frostburg&gt;[http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/liquids/faq/antoine-vapor-pressure.shtml What is the Antoine Equation?] (Chemistry Department, [[Frostburg State University]], [[Maryland]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sinnot&gt;{{cite book|author=Sinnot, R.K.|title=Chemical Engineering Design]|edition=4th|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|year=2005|page=331|isbn=0-7506-6538-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DJaxUL3numgC&amp;pg=PA331 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a mathematical expression of the relation between the vapor pressure and the temperature of pure liquid or solid substances. The basic form of the equation is:

:&lt;math&gt;\log P = A-\frac{B}{C+T}&lt;/math&gt;

and it can be transformed into this temperature-explicit form:

:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{B}{A-\log P} - C&lt;/math&gt;

where: &lt;span style="vertical-align:+12%;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is the absolute vapor pressure of a substance&lt;br&gt;
:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;span style="vertical-align:+15%;"&gt;&lt;span style="vertical-align:+12%;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is the temperature of the substance&lt;/span&gt;
:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;span style="vertical-align:+12%;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="vertical-align:+12%;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="vertical-align:+12%;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are substance-specific coefficients (i.e., constants or parameters)
:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;span style="vertical-align:-30%;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;\log&lt;/math&gt; is typically either &lt;math&gt;\log_{10}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\log_e&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ref name=Sinnot/&gt;

A simpler form of the equation with only two coefficients is sometimes used:

:&lt;math&gt;\log P = A-\frac{B}{T}&lt;/math&gt;

which can be transformed to:

:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{B}{A-\log P}&lt;/math&gt;

Sublimations and vaporizations of the same substance have separate sets of Antoine coefficients, as do components in mixtures.&lt;ref name=frostburg/&gt; Each parameter set for a specific compound is only applicable over a specified temperature range. Generally, temperature ranges are chosen to maintain the equation's accuracy of a few up to 8–10 percent. For many volatile substances, several different sets of parameters are available and used for different temperature ranges. The Antoine equation has poor accuracy with any single parameter set when used from a compound's melting point to its critical temperature. Accuracy is also usually poor when vapor pressure is under 10 Torr because of the limitations of the apparatus used to establish the Antoine parameter values.

The Wagner equation&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last= Wagner|first= W.|title= New vapour pressure measurements for argon and nitrogen and a new method for establishing rational vapour pressure equations|journal= Cryogenics|volume= 13|issue= 8|pages= 470–482 |year= 1973|doi=  10.1016/0011-2275(73)90003-9|bibcode = 1973Cryo...13..470W }}&lt;/ref&gt; gives "one of the best"&lt;ref&gt;Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook, 7th Ed. pp. 4–15&lt;/ref&gt; fits to experimental data but is quite complex. It expresses reduced vapor pressure as a function of reduced temperature.

==Relation to boiling point of liquids==
{{further|Boiling point}}
[[Image:vapor_pressure_chart.svg|thumb|right|A log-lin vapor pressure chart for various liquids]]
As a general trend, vapor pressures of liquids at ambient temperatures increase with decreasing boiling points. This is illustrated in the vapor pressure chart (see right) that shows graphs of the '''vapor pressures versus temperatures''' for a variety of liquids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book||editor=Perry, R.H. |editor2=Green, D.W. |title=[[Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook]]|edition=7th|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1997|isbn= 0-07-049841-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the normal boiling point of a liquid, the vapor pressure is equal to the standard atmospheric pressure defined as 1 atmosphere&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Petrucci, Ralph H. |author2=Harwood, William S. |author3=Herring, F.Geoffrey |title=General Chemistry |edition=8th|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2002|isbn= 0-13-014329-4|page=484}}&lt;/ref&gt; (760 Torr or 101.325 kPa or 14.69595 PSI).

For example, at any given temperature, [[methyl chloride]] has the highest vapor pressure of any of the liquids in the chart. It also has the lowest normal boiling point (−24.2&amp;nbsp;°C), which is where the vapor pressure curve of methyl chloride (the blue line) intersects the horizontal pressure line of one atmosphere ([[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]]) of absolute vapor pressure.

Although the relation between vapor pressure and temperature is non-linear, the chart uses a logarithmic vertical axis to produce slightly curved lines, so one chart can graph many liquids. A nearly straight line is obtained when the logarithm of the vapor pressure is plotted against 1/(T+230)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Dreisbach, R. R.  |author2=Spencer, R. S. |lastauthoramp=yes | title=Infinite Points of Cox Chart Families and dt/dP Values at any Pressure|journal=Industrial and Engineering Chemistry,|volume=41|number=1|page=176|date= 1949|doi=10.1021/ie50469a040}}&lt;/ref&gt; where T is the temperature in degrees Celsius. The vapor pressure of a liquid at its boiling point equals the pressure of its surrounding environment.

==Liquid mixtures==
[[Raoult's law]] gives an approximation to the vapor pressure of mixtures of liquids. It states that the activity (pressure or [[fugacity]]) of a single-phase mixture is equal to the mole-fraction-weighted sum of the components' vapor pressures:

:&lt;math&gt; P_{\rm tot} =\sum_i P y_i = \sum_i P_i^{\rm sat} x_i \,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P_{\rm tot}&lt;/math&gt; is the mixture's vapor pressure, &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is the [[mole fraction]] of component &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in the liquid phase and &lt;math&gt;y
_i&lt;/math&gt; is the [[mole fraction]] of component &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in the vapor phase respectively. &lt;math&gt;P_i^{\rm sat}&lt;/math&gt; is the vapor pressure of component &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;. Raoult's law is applicable only to non-electrolytes (uncharged species); it is most appropriate for non-polar molecules with only weak intermolecular attractions (such as [[London force]]s).

Systems that have vapor pressures higher than indicated by the above formula are said to have positive deviations. Such a deviation suggests weaker intermolecular attraction than in the pure components, so that the molecules can be thought of as being "held in" the liquid phase less strongly than in the pure liquid. An example is the [[azeotrope]] of approximately 95% ethanol and water. Because the azeotrope's vapor pressure is higher than predicted by Raoult's law, it boils at a temperature below that of either pure component.

There are also systems with negative deviations that have vapor pressures that are lower than expected. Such a deviation is evidence for stronger intermolecular attraction between the constituents of the mixture than exists in the pure components. Thus, the molecules are "held in" the liquid more strongly when a second molecule is present. An example is a mixture of trichloromethane (chloroform) and 2-propanone (acetone), which boils above the boiling point of either pure component.

The negative and positive deviations can be used to determine [[thermodynamic activity]] coefficients of the components of mixtures.

==Solids==
[[Image:Vapor Pressure Curve of Liquid and Solid Benzene.png|thumb|300px|Vapor pressure of liquid and solid benzene]]
Equilibrium vapor pressure can be defined as the pressure reached when a condensed phase is in equilibrium with its own vapor. In the case of an equilibrium solid, such as a [[crystal]], this can be defined as the pressure when the rate of [[sublimation (physics)|sublimation]] of a solid matches the rate of deposition of its vapor phase. For most solids this pressure is very low, but some notable exceptions are [[naphthalene]], [[dry ice]] (the vapor pressure of dry ice is 5.73 MPa (831 psi, 56.5 atm) at 20 °C, which causes most sealed containers to rupture), and ice. All solid materials have a vapor pressure. However, due to their often extremely low values, measurement can be rather difficult. Typical techniques include the use of [[thermogravimetry]] and gas transpiration.

There are a number of methods for calculating the sublimation pressure (i.e., the vapor pressure) of a solid. One method is to estimate the sublimation pressure from extrapolated liquid vapor pressures (of the supercooled liquid), if the [[Enthalpy of fusion|heat of fusion]] is known, by using this particular form of the Clausius–Clapeyron relation:&lt;ref name="Moller"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Moller B. |author2=Rarey J. |author3=Ramjugernath D. |title=Estimation of the vapour pressure of non-electrolyte organic compounds via group contributions and group interactions|journal=Journal of Molecular Liquids|volume=143|pages=52|doi=10.1016/j.molliq.2008.04.020 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ln\,P^{\rm sub}_{\rm s} = \ln\,P^{\rm sub}_{\rm l} - \frac{\Delta_{\rm fus}H}{R} \left( \frac{1}{T_{\rm sub}} - \frac{1}{T_{\rm fus}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where:

* &lt;math&gt;P^{\rm sub}_{\rm s}&lt;/math&gt; is the sublimation pressure of the solid component at the temperature &lt;math&gt; T_{\rm sub} &lt; T_{\rm fus} &lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt; P^{\rm sub}_{\rm l}&lt;/math&gt; is the extrapolated vapor pressure of the liquid component at the temperature &lt;math&gt; T_{\rm sub} &lt; T_{\rm fus} &lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;\Delta_{\rm fus}H &lt;/math&gt; is the heat of fusion.
* &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gas constant]].
* &lt;math&gt;T_{\rm sub}&lt;/math&gt; is the sublimation temperature.
* &lt;math&gt;T_{\rm fus}&lt;/math&gt; is the melting point temperature.

This method assumes that the heat of fusion is temperature-independent, ignores additional transition temperatures between different solid phases, and it gives a fair estimation for temperatures not too far from the melting point. It also shows that the sublimation pressure is lower than the extrapolated liquid vapor pressure (Δ&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt;''H'' &gt; 0) and the difference grows with increased distance from the melting point.

==Boiling point of water==
[[Image:Water vapor pressure graph.jpg|thumb|right|Graph of water vapor pressure versus temperature. At the normal boiling point of 100 °C, it equals the standard atmospheric pressure of 760 [[Torr]] or 101.325 [[kPa]].]]
{{main|Vapor pressure of water}}
Like all liquids, water boils when its vapor pressure reaches its surrounding pressure. In nature, the atmospheric pressure is lower at higher elevations and water boils at a lower temperature. The boiling temperature of water for atmospheric pressures can be approximated by the [[Antoine equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\log_{10}P = 8.07131 - \frac{1730.63}{233.426 + T_b}&lt;/math&gt;

or transformed into this temperature-explicit form:

:&lt;math&gt;T_b = \frac{1730.63}{8.07131 - \log_{10}P} - 233.426&lt;/math&gt;

where the temperature &lt;math&gt;T_b&lt;/math&gt; is the boiling point in degrees [[Celsius]] and the pressure &lt;math&gt;P_{ } &lt;/math&gt; is in [[Torr]].

==Dühring's rule==
{{main|Dühring's rule}}
Dühring's rule states that a linear relationship exists between the temperatures at which two solutions exert the same vapor pressure.

==Meaning in meteorology==
In [[meteorology]], the term ''vapor pressure'' is used to mean the partial pressure of [[water vapor]] in the atmosphere, even if it is not in equilibrium,&lt;ref&gt;[http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=vapor-pressure1 Glossary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110415075010/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=vapor-pressure1 |date=2011-04-15 }} (Developed by the [[American Meteorological Society]])&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''equilibrium vapor pressure'' is specified otherwise. Meteorologists also use the term ''saturation vapor pressure'' to refer to the equilibrium vapor pressure of water or [[brine]] above a flat surface, to distinguish it from equilibrium vapor pressure, which takes into account the shape and size of water droplets and particulates in the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fermi.jhuapl.edu/people/babin/vapor/index.html A Brief Tutorial]. jhuapl.edu (An article about the definition of equilibrium vapor pressure)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Via media''''' is a [[Latin]] phrase meaning "the middle road" and is a philosophical [[maxim (philosophy)|maxim]] for life which advocates moderation in all thoughts and actions.

Originating from early [[Ancient Greek philosophy]], where [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BCE) taught [[moderation]], urging his students to follow the middle road between extremes, the ''via media'' was the dominant philosophical [[precept]] by which [[Ancient Roman]] civilisation and society was organised.

==Erasmus==
{{Main|Erasmus}}

==Anglicanism==
The term ''via media'' is frequently applied to the [[Anglican]] churches, though not without debate, as a term of [[apologetics]]. The idea of a middle way, between the Roman [[Catholics]] and the Magisterial Reformers, goes back to early in the [[Protestant Reformation]], when theologians such as [[Martin Bucer]], [[Thomas Cranmer]] and [[Heinrich Bullinger]] advocated a religious solution in which secular authority would hold the ring in the religious dispute, and ensure political stability.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diarmaid MacCulloch]], ''Thomas Cranmer'' (1996), p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Richard Hooker===
A recent scholarly study points out that, while [[Richard Hooker]]'s ''[[Law of Ecclesiastical Polity]]'' has a reputation as "the classic depiction of the English ''via media'' based upon the sound triumvirate of scripture, reason and tradition", the actual term ''via media'' nowhere appears in the work (written in English).&lt;ref&gt;Michael Brydon, ''The Evolving Reputation of Richard Hooker: An Examination of Responses 1600-1714'' (2006), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Tractarianism===
Three centuries later, the phrase was used by [[John Henry Newman]] in setting out his influential views on [[Anglicanism]], as part of the argument he brought forward with the [[Tractarian]] movement.
''Via Media'' was the title of a series of the ''Tracts for Today'', published by Newman around 1834. These tracts in particular used the title to pay homage to the inception of the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] and in so doing claim that the Tractarian movement was of the same vein as early Church of England scholars and theologians. They examined the [[Elizabethan Settlement]] and reinterpreted it as a compromise between Rome and Reform.

The Tractarians promoted the idea of Anglicanism as a middle way between the extremes of [[Protestantism]] and [[Catholicism]],&lt;ref&gt;Newman: Tract 38 ''Via Media I'': "The glory of the English Church is, that it has taken the VIA MEDIA, as it has been called. It lies between the (so called) Reformers and the Romanists."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Newman: Tract 41 ''Via Media II'': "A number of distinct doctrines are included in the notion of Protestantism: and as to all these, our Church has taken the VIA MEDIA between it and Popery"&lt;/ref&gt; which became later an idea of Anglicanism as a middle way between Rome and Protestantism itself.

In justification of its idea of a ''via media'', the Oxford Movement attributed this position to the works of the Elizabethan theologian [[Richard Hooker]] and in particular his book ''Lawes of Ecclesiastical Polity'', which is accepted as a founding work on Anglican theology, a view of Hooker promoted by [[John Keble]], who was one of the first to argue that English theology underwent such a "decisive change" in Hooker’s hands.&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Atkinson: [http://www.churchsociety.org/crossway/documents/Cway_060_AtkinsonHooker1.pdf Richard Hooker – Reformed Theologian of the English Church] - The Church Society, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Hooker does not use the phrase "''via media''" or "middle way" or the word "Anglican" in any of his works; the attribution of ''via media'' to him is much later. Hooker's work concerned the form of [[Protestant Reformation|Protestant]] church government as an argument against the extreme advocates of [[Puritan]]ism, arguing that elements of Church of England practice condemned by the Puritans, in particular the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' and the institution of [[bishop]]s, are proper and accord with Scripture. Later theologians analysed Hooker's approach to the particular doctrine of justification by faith as a middle way between the [[predestination]]ism of the extreme Calvinists and [[Lutheran]] and [[Arminian]] doctrines.

The Oxford Movement recast this ''via media'' as a middle way not within Protestantism but between Protestantism and Roman Catholicism. Its application to early Anglicanism has remained current in Anglican discourse.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13373">'''Visual space''' is the [[perception|perceptual]] space housing the [[visual perception|visual]] world being experienced by an aware [[observation|observer]]; it is the subjective counterpart of the space of physical objects before an observer's eyes.

==Spaces of objects and of visual percepts==

===Space of physical objects===

In ''' object space''' the location and shape of physical targets can be accurately described with the tools of geometry. For practical purposes it is [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]]. It is three-dimensional and various co-ordinate systems like the [[Cartesian coordinates|Cartesian]] x,y,z (with a defined origin in relation to an observer's head or eyes), or [[Bipolar coordinates|bipolar]] with angles of elevation, azimuth and binocular parallax (based on the separation of the two eyes) are interchangeable. No elaborate mathematics are needed.

===Space of visual percepts===

'''Percepts''', the counterparts in the aware observer's conscious experience of objects in physical space, constitute an ordered ensemble or, as [[Ernst Cassirer]] explained,&lt;ref&gt;Cassirer, E. (1944). The concept of group and the theory of perception. ''Philosophy and Phenomenological Research'', 5 (1), 1-35.&lt;/ref&gt; the perceptual world has a structure and is not an aggregate of scattered sensations. This visual space can be accessed by introspection, by interrogation, or by suitable experimental procedures which allow relative location as well as some structural properties to be assessed, even quantitatively.

An example illustrates the relationship between the concepts of object and visual space:
Two straight lines are presented to an observer who is asked to set them so that they appear parallel. When this has been done, the lines ''are'' parallel in visual space and now a comparison is feasible with the physical lines' setting in object space. Good precision can be achieved using psychophysical procedures in human observers or behavioral ones in trained animals. The reciprocal experiment is easier to perform but does not yield a numerical read-out as readily: show objectively parallel lines and make a determination of their inclination in the observer's perception.

Considering how it arises (see below), visual space seems, as an immediate, unmediated experience, to provide a remarkably true and unproblematic representation of a real world of objects.

===Visual space and visual field===

The distinction is mandatory between what the eye professions call ''visual field'', the area or extent of physical space that is available to the eye or that is being imaged on the retina, and the virtual, perceptual ''visual space'' in which visual percepts are located, the subject of this entry.
Confusion is caused by the use of ''[[:de:Geschichte der Theorie des Sehens|Sehraum]]'' in the German literature for both. There is no doubt that [[Ewald Hering]] and his followers &lt;ref&gt;Tschermak, A. (1947). ''Einführung in die Physiologische Optik''. Wien: Springer-Verlag&lt;/ref&gt; meant visual space in their disquisitions.

===Spaces: formal, physical, perceptual&lt;!--Linked from 'Rudolf Carnap'--&gt;===
{{See also|Conceptual space}}
The fundamental distinction was made by [[Rudolf Carnap]] between three kinds of space which he called ''formal'', ''physical'' and ''perceptual.''&lt;ref&gt;Carnap, R. (1922). Der Raum. In: ''Kantstudien Ergänzungsheft'', 56&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematicians, for example, deal with ordered structures, ensembles of elements for which rules of logico-deductive relationships hold, limited solely by being not self-contradictory. These are the ''formal'' spaces. According to Carnap, studying ''physical'' space means examining the relationship between empirically determined objects. Finally, there is the realm of what students of Kant know as ''[[:de:Anschauung|Anschauungen]],'' immediate sensory experiences, often awkwardly translated as "[[apperception]]s," which belong to ''perceptual spaces.''

==Visual space and geometry==
Geometry is the discipline devoted to the study of space and the rules relating the elements to each other. For example, in Euclidean space there is the [[Pythagorean theorem]] for distances. In a two-dimensional space of constant curvature, like the surface of a sphere, the rule is somewhat more complex but applies everywhere. On the two-dimensional surface of a football, the rule is more complex still and has different values depending on location. In well-behaved spaces such rules used for measurement and called ''[[Metric (mathematics)|Metrics]],'' are classically handled by the mathematics invented by [[Riemann]]. Object space belongs to that class.

To the extent that it is reachable by scientifically acceptable probes, visual space as defined is also a candidate for such considerations. The first and remarkably prescient analysis was published by [[Ernst Mach]]&lt;ref&gt;Mach, E. (1906) ''Space and Geometry''. Open Court Publishing: Chicago&lt;/ref&gt; in 1901. Under the heading ''On Physiological as Distinguished from Geometrical Space'' Mach states that "Both spaces are threefold manifoldnesses" but the former is "...neither constituted everywhere and in all directions alike, nor infinite in extent, nor unbounded." A notable attempt at a rigorous formulation was made in 1947 by the highly talented mathematician [[Rudolf Luneburg]], who preceded his essay &lt;ref&gt;Luneburg, R.K. (1947). ''Mathematical Analysis of Binocular Vision''. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; by a profound analysis of the underlying principles. When features are sufficiently singular and distinct, there is no problem about a correspondence between an individual item ''A'' in object space and its correlate ''A' '' in visual space. Questions can be asked and answered such as "If visual percepts ''A',B',C' '' are correlates of physical objects ''A,B,C,'' and if ''C'' lies between ''A'' and ''B'', does ''C' '' lie between ''A' '' and ''B' ''?" In this manner, the possibility of visual space being metrical can be approached. If the exercise is successful, a great deal can be said about the nature of the mapping of the physical space on the visual space.

On the basis of fragmentary psychophysical data of previous generations, Luneburg concluded that visual space was hyperbolic with constant curvature, meaning that elements can be moved throughout the space without changing shape. One of Luneburg's major arguments is that, in accord with a common observation, the transformation involving hyperbolic space renders infinity into a dome (the sky). The Luneburg proposition gave rise to discussions and attempts at corroborating experiments, which on the whole did not favor it.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 3 ''Geometry and Spatial Vision''. (2006) In M.R.M. Jenkin and L.R. Harris (Eds) ''Seeing Spatial Form''. Oxford U. Press. pp 35-41&lt;/ref&gt;

Basic to the problem, and underestimated by Luneburg the mathematician, is the likely success of a mathematically viable formulation of the relationship between objects in physical space and percepts in visual space. Any scientific investigation of visual space is colored by the kind of access we have to it, and the precision, repeatability and generality of measurements. Insightful questions can be asked about the mapping of visual space to object space &lt;ref&gt;Foley, J.M. (1964). Desarguesian property in visual space. ''Journal of the Optical Society of America'', 54 (5), 684-692.&lt;/ref&gt; but answers are mostly limited in the range of their validity. If the physical setting that satisfies the criterion of, say, apparent parallelism varies from observer to observer, or from day to day, or from context to context, so does the geometrical nature of, and hence mathematical formulation for, visual space.

All these arguments notwithstanding, there is a major concordance between the locations of items in object space and their correlates in visual space. It is adequately veridical for us to navigate very effectively in the world, deviations from such a situation are sufficiently notable to warrant special consideration. [[visual space agnosia]] is a recognized neurological condition, and the many common distortions, called [[geometrical-optical illusions]], are widely demonstrated but of minor consequence.

==Neural representation of space==

===Fechner's ''inner'' and ''outer'' psychophysics ===

Its founder, [[Gustav Theodor Fechner]] defined the mission of the discipline of [[psychophysics]] as the functional relationship between the mental and material worlds—in this particular case, the visual and object spaces—but he acknowledged an intermediate step, which has since blossomed into the major enterprise of modern neuroscience. In distinguishing between ''inner'' and ''outer'' psychophysics, Fechner recognized that a physical stimulus generates a percept by way of an effect on the organism's sensory and nervous systems. Hence, without denying that its essence is the arc between object and percept, the inquiry can concern itself with the neural substrate of visual space.

===Retinotopy and beyond===

Two major concepts dating back to the middle of the 19th century set the parameters of the discussion here. [[Johannes Peter Müller|Johannes Müller]] emphasized that what matters in a neural path is the connection it makes, and Hermann [[Lotze]], from psychological considerations, enunciated the principle of local sign. Put together in modern neuroanatomical terms they mean that a nerve fiber from a fixed retinal location instructs its target neurons in the brain about the presence of a stimulus in the location in the eye's visual field that is imaged there. The orderly array of retinal locations is preserved in the passage from the retina to the brain, and provides what is aptly called a "[[Retinotopy|retinotopic"]] mapping in the primary visual cortex. Thus in the first instance brain activity retains the relative spatial ordering of the objects and lays the foundations for a neural substrate of visual space. Unfortunately, as is so common in brain studies, simplicity and transparency ends here. Right at the outset, visual signals are analyzed not only for their position, but also, separately in parallel channels, for many other attributes such as brightness, color, orientation, depth. No single neuron or even neuronal center or circuit represents both the nature of a target feature and its accurate location. The unitary mapping of object space into the coherent visual space without internal contradictions or inconsistencies that we as observer automatically experience, demands concepts of conjoint activity in several parts of the nervous system that is at present beyond the reach of neurophysiological research.

===Place cells===

Though the details of the process by which the experience of visual space emerges remain opaque, a startling finding gives hope for future insights. Neural units have been demonstrated in the brain structure called [[hippocampus]] that show activity only when the animal is in a specific place in its environment{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}.

==Space and its content==
Only on an astronomical scale are physical space and its contents interdependent, This major proposition of the [[general relativity|general theory of relativity]] is of no concern in vision. For us, distances in object space are independent of the nature of the objects.

But this is not so simple in visual space. At a minim an observer judges the relative location of a few light points in an otherwise dark visual field, a simplistic extension from object space that enabled Luneburg to make some statements about the geometry of visual space. In a more richly textured visual world, the various visual percepts carry with them prior perceptual associations which often affect their relative spatial disposition. Identical separations in physical space can look quite different (''are quite different'' in visual space) depending on the features that demarcate them. This is particularly so in the depth dimension because the apparatus by which values in the third visual dimension are assigned is fundamentally different from that for the height and width of objects.

Even in monocular vision, which physiologically has only two dimensions, cues of size, perspective, relative motion etc. are used to [[Monocular depth cues|assign depth differences to percepts]]. Looked at as a mathematical/geometrical problem, expanding a 2-dimensional object manifold into a 3-dimensional visual world is "ill-posed," i.e., not capable of a rational solution, but is accomplished quite effectively by the human observer.

The problem becomes less ill-posed when [[binocular vision]] allows actual determination of relative depth by [[stereoscopy]], but its linkage to the evaluation of distance in the other two dimensions is uncertain (see: [[stereoscopic depth rendition]]). Hence, the uncomplicated three-dimensional visual space of every-day experience is the product of many perceptual and cognitive layers superimposed on the physiological representation of the physical world of objects.
