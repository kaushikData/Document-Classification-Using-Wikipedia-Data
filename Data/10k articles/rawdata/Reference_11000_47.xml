'''''A.B.C. of Chairmanship''''' by [[Walter Citrine, 1st Baron Citrine|Walter Citrine]] is considered by many in the Labour and Union movements of the UK to be the definitive book on how meetings should be run and how committees should be managed.&lt;ref name="tuc"&gt;Typical usage see [http://www.chelmsford-tuc.org.uk/article35.html TUC guideline article]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hallas"&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/hallas/works/1972/03/chair.htm Hallas, D ''Hints on Chairmanship'']&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="unionhome"&gt;[http://www.unionhome.org.uk/?p=1977 UnionHome 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UCU"&gt;[https://www.ucu.org.uk/media/1691/Activist-experience-How-do-I-cope-with-meetings/pdf/meetings_cope_1.pdf University and College Union advice sheet, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;  It originated as notes for [[Electrical Trades Union (UK)|Electrical Trades Union]] (ETU) activists in the Merseyside area of the UK– they had Liverpool, Birkenhead and Bootle branches - in the 1910s by [[Walter Citrine, 1st Baron Citrine|Citrine]] who was then Chairman of their District Committee.&lt;ref name="moher"&gt;[[James Moher|J.G. Moher]], ''Walter Citrine: a pioneer of industrial cooperation, 2016'' in Other Worlds of Labour&lt;/ref&gt;

Union meetings were then important places where the terms of employment in the trade were keenly discussed by union activists, news of employment opportunities were shared and some general social life ensued in the pub where they usually met. It was to guide these activist electricians – a very intelligent but sometimes fractious community who tended to be critical of their ETU headquarters officials in [[Manchester]] - that Citrine devised the notes, based on Parliamentary rules of debate, to ensure the efficient and orderly conduct of the business. So well received were they that the ETU adopted them nationally in its Rule Book in 1914. Over the years, they were revised and adapted to changing circumstances in a union which grew vastly during World War 1.&lt;ref name="Lloyd"&gt;J. Lloyd, ''Light and Liberty, the History of the Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunicaiton and Plumbing Union'', (as the ETU became), 1990, 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920, [[Walter Citrine, 1st Baron Citrine|Citrine]], who had stood as a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Parliamentary candidate for the Wallasey seat in the 1918 General Election, was encouraged to produce an expanded version of this guide for other unions and the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], entitled ''The Labour Chairman''. This was published with an introduction by a leading [[National Union of Railwaymen]] and TUC figure of that time, [[J. H. Thomas|J.H. (‘Jimmy’) Thomas]]. It had considerable influence and became an authoritative source of rulings on all procedural aspects of the conduct of meetings from branch to national levels.

[[File:Citrine The Labour Chairman.png|thumb|alt=Book cover image of The Labour Chairman by Walter Citrine, 1920|The Labour Chairman book cover from 1920]]

It was this book, later updated by [[Walter Citrine, 1st Baron Citrine|Citrine]], which was published by the [[Fabian Society]], Co-operative Society, NCLC and many unions as The ABC of Chairmanship from 1939 onwards. New editions were published regularly until the 1980s and all those whose duty it fell to chair or manage meetings (not just by union and Labour Party officers), saw their well-thumbed copies as ‘their bible’. Alan Johnson MP, former General Secretary of the Communication Workers Union and Home Secretary, and now a highly successful author of two books of memoirs, described Citrine (as it is generally called), as his and all his colleagues’ key guide.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;[[Alan Johnson]], ''Please Mr Postman – A Memoir'', (2014), 245-6, 152-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Walter Citrine, 1st Baron Citrine|Walter Citrine]] was a leading British [[trade union]]ist of the twentieth century.

The '''Archives and Records Association''' ('''ARA''') is the principal professional body for [[archivist]]s, archive [[Art conservation|conservators]] and [[records manager]]s in the [[UK]] and [[Ireland]]. The Archives and Records Association (ARA, UK &amp; Ireland) came into existence on 1 June 2010 and is the result of a merger of the National Council on Archives (NCA) and the Association of Chief Archivists in Local Government (ACALG) with the [[Society of Archivists]] (SoA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.org.uk/latest-news/archives-a-records-association-launches.html |title=Archives &amp; Records Association Launches &amp;#124; Latest News |publisher=Archives.org.uk |date=2010-07-28 |accessdate=2014-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140620170351/http://www.archives.org.uk/latest-news/archives-a-records-association-launches.html |archivedate=20 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a member of the [[International Council on Archives]].

==Aims==
The principal aims of the ARA are: to promote the care and preservation of archives and the better administration of archive repositories; to advance the training of its members; and to encourage relevant research and publication. It achieves these aims through the work of its Council and its various Committees, Groups and Regions, and through its role as the voice of the three professions. The association advises, submits evidence and makes comment on matters of professional concern to people or organisations whose activities affect archives and records.

==Membership==
The association has over two thousand members, mainly made up of professional archivists, records managers, archive conservators and digital curators from all the different types of organisations that employ such professionals. Through an affiliate membership scheme, those who work at a [[paraprofessional]] level or who are generally interested in the work of the association and its members can join. There is also a student membership option for those who are studying for a professional qualification in archives, records management or archive conservation.

==Structure==
The association is managed by a Council, which is partially elected every two years, along with a number of committees and sub-committees relating to specific areas of business.

The membership is divided into eleven regions that span the whole of the UK and Ireland, each with their own regional committee. The regional group covering [[Ireland]] (both the [[Republic of Ireland|Republic]] and [[Northern Ireland]]) has a semi-autonomous status as the [[Archives and Records Association, Ireland]].

Seven special interest groups also exist within the organisation’s structure, representing members’ different employment backgrounds and/or concerns.

The association has an office in [[Taunton]], [[Somerset]], which deals with the day-to-day administration of the organisation.

==Publications and outreach==
A biannual publication entitled ''Archives and Records: The Journal of the Archives and Records Association'', which covers professional issues, is produced for the association's members. The journal was previously known as the ''Journal of the Society of Archivists'', and this title was retained until 2012: the current title was first used for volume 34, published in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.org.uk/publications/journal-of-the-society-of-archivists.html |title=Archives and Records: The Journal of the Archives and Records Association &amp;#124; Journal of the ARA |publisher=Archives.org.uk |date=2010-11-04 |accessdate=2014-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140805112227/http://www.archives.org.uk/publications/journal-of-the-society-of-archivists.html |archivedate=5 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The association also publishes a monthly newsletter, called ''ARC Magazine'' (Archives, Records management, Conservation), and a fortnightly recruitment supplement called ARC Recruitment containing job and voluntary placement opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.org.uk/publications/arc-magazine.html |title=ARC Magazine &amp;#124; Publications |publisher=Archives.org.uk |date=2010-11-04 |accessdate=2014-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.org.uk/publications/arc-recruitment.html |title=ARC Recruitment &amp;#124; Publications |publisher=Archives.org.uk |date=2010-11-04 |accessdate=2014-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313050251/http://www.archives.org.uk/publications/arc-recruitment.html |archivedate=13 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Periodically more in depth guides on particular types of records or professional issues are produced and made available for members to purchase.

==Training==
In terms of professional training for archives and records management, the ARA accredits externally provided postgraduate diploma/degree programmes, of which there are currently six; three in England and one each in Wales, Scotland and Ireland.

For Archive Conservation, the association runs a Certificate in Archive Conservation as an in-service scheme restricted to members only. It is also involved in the Professional Accreditation of Conservator-Restorers (PAC-R) scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.org.uk/training/certificate-in-archive-conservation.html |title=Certificate in Archive Conservation &amp;#124; Training |publisher=Archives.org.uk |date=2010-07-28 |accessdate=2014-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other training events for members are organised by the Regional committees or Special Interest Groups of the association and co-ordinated by the association’s Training Officer.
The association’s Registration Scheme acts as a formal process of [[Continuing Professional Development|continued professional development]]. A register was first established in 1987, initially with a clause allowing professional members to be accepted automatically if they had been working in a recognised post for at least two years: this clause has now been closed and full completion of the present scheme, introduced in 1996, is now the only way to become a Registered Member of the association. Those who complete the registration scheme are entitled to use the [[post-nominal]]s '''RMARA''' (Registered Member Archives and Records Association).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.org.uk/training/registration-scheme.html |title=ARA Registration Scheme |publisher=Archives.org.uk |accessdate=2014-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2156">The '''Armorial Hall''' of the [[Winter Palace]] is a vast chamber originally designed for official ceremonies.  The Armorial Hall is located between the [[Military Gallery]] and the [[Gardens of the Winter Palace|palace courtyard]].

The current hall was designed by [[Vasily Stasov]] in the late 1830s, after the original hall was damaged by an extensive palace fire in 1837; it was at this time that the fluted columns were gilded. Along with [[St George's Hall, and Apollo Hall of the Winter Palace|St George's Hall]] and the [[Nicholas Hall of the Winter Palace|Nicholas Hall]], it was one of the palace's main areas for entertaining.  The edges of the hall are decorated with vast stucco [[panoply|panoplies]].  In the center of the hall sits a [[lapidary]] vase made of [[aventurine]] from 1842.

Under the direction of [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]], who became the Commissar of Enlightenment after the [[October Revolution]], the Armorial Hall was used as a concert hall, with a capacity of up to 2,000.

Today, as part of the [[State Hermitage Museum]], this room retains its original decoration.

{{Gospel Jesus}}
The '''ascension of Jesus''' ([[anglicized]] from the [[Vulgate]] Latin [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#1:9|Acts 1:9-11]] section title: ''Ascensio Iesu'') is the departure of [[Christ (title)|Christ]] from [[Earth]] into the presence of [[God in Christianity|God]].{{sfn|Holwerda|1979|p=310}} 
The biblical narrative in Chapter 1 of the [[Acts of the Apostles]] takes place 40 days after the [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]]: [[Jesus]] is taken up from the [[Apostles|disciples]] in their sight, a [[cloud]] hides him from view, and two men in white appear to tell them that he will return "in the same way you have seen him go into heaven."{{sfn|Müller|2016|p=113-114}} In the Christian tradition, reflected in the major [[Christian creeds]] and confessional statements, the ascension is connected with the [[heavenly session|exaltation of Jesus]], meaning that through his ascension, Jesus took his seat at the [[right hand of God]]: "He ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty."{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|p=114}} Despite this, in modern times the Ascension is seen less as the climax of the mystery of Christ than as "something of an embarrassment", in the words of McGill University's Douglas Farrow.{{sfn|Farrow|2004|p=9}}

In [[Christian art]], the ascending Jesus is often shown blessing an earthly group below him, signifying the entire Church.{{sfn|Ouspensky|Lossky|1999|p=197}} The [[Feast of the Ascension]] is celebrated on the 40th day of [[Easter]], always a Thursday;{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|p=114}} the Orthodox tradition has a different calendar up to a month later than in the Western tradition, and while the [[Anglican communion]] continues to observe the feast, most [[Protestant]] churches have abandoned the observance.{{sfn|Quast|2011|p=45}}{{sfn|Stokl-Ben-Ezra|2007|p=286}} 

== Biblical accounts ==
{{Death of Jesus}}
[[Luke-Acts]], a single work from the same anonymous author, provides the only narrative account of the ascension.{{sfn|Thompson|2010|p=319}}{{sfn|Holwerda|1979|p=310}} [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 24 tells how Jesus leads the eleven disciples to [[Bethany (Biblical village)|Bethany]], a village on the [[Mount of Olives]] not far from Jerusalem, where he instructs them to remain in Jerusalem until the coming of the [[Holy Spirit]] and blesses them. "And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he parted from them, and was carried up into heaven. And they worshiped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy." [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 1 describes a meal at which Jesus commands the disciples to await the coming of the Holy Spirit, a cloud takes him upward from sight, and two men in white appear to tell them (the disciples) that he will return "in the same way you have seen him go into heaven."{{sfn|Müller|2016|p=113-114}} Luke and Acts appear to describe the same event, but present quite different chronologies, Luke placing it on the same day as the [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] and Acts forty days afterwards;{{sfn|Seim|2009|p=24}} various proposals have been put forward to resolve the contradiction, but the question remains open.{{sfn|Müller|2016|p=113}}

The [[Gospel of John]] has three references to ascension in Jesus' own words: "No one has ascended into heaven but he who descended from heaven, the son of man" (John 3:13); "What if you (the disciples) were to see the son of man ascending where he was before?" (John 6:62); and to Mary Magdalene after his resurrection, "Do not hold me, for I not yet ascended to my father..." (John 20:17).{{sfn|Holwerda|1979|p=310}} In the first and second Jesus is claiming to be the apocalyptic "one like a son of man" of [[Daniel 7]];{{sfn|Köstenberger|2004|p=85}} the last has mystified commentators – why should Mary be prohibited from touching the risen but not yet ascended Christ, while Thomas is later invited to do so?{{sfn|Quast|1991|p=134}}

Various epistles (Romans 8:34, Ephesians 1:19-20, Colossians 3:1, Philippians 2:9-11, 1 Timothy 3:16, and 1 Peter 3:21-22) also refer to an ascension, seeming, like Luke-Acts and John, to equate it with the post-resurrection "exaltation" of Jesus to the right hand of God.{{sfn|McDonald|2004|p=21}} There is a broad consensus among scholars that the brief ascension account in the [[Gospel of Mark]] (Mark 16:19) is a later addition to the original version of that gospel.{{sfn|Cresswell|2013|loc=unpaginated}}


== Background ==
Theologian [[James Dunn (theologian)|James Dunn]] describes the ascension as at best a puzzle and at worst an embarrassment for an age which no longer conceives of a physical heaven located above the Earth.{{sfn|Seim|2009|p=23}} The [[Biblical cosmology|cosmology]] of the author of Luke-Acts was quite different: his age believed in a three-part cosmos with the heavens above, a flat earth centered on Jerusalem in the middle, and the [[underworld]] below.{{sfn|Wright|2002|p=53}}{{sfn|Najman|2014|p=93}} Heaven was separated from the earth by the [[firmament]], the visible sky, a solid inverted bowl where God's palace sat on pillars in the celestial sea.{{sfn|Pennington|2007|p=41-42}} Humans looking up from earth saw the floor of heaven, made of clear blue [[lapis-lazuli]] (Exodus 24:9-10), as was God's throne (Ezekiel 1:26).{{sfn|Wright|2002|p=54,56}}

Ascension stories were fairly common around the time of Jesus and the gospel-authors,{{sfn|McDonald|2004|p=22}} signifying the deification of a noteworthy person (usually a Roman Emperor), and in Judaism as an indication of divine approval.{{sfn|Aune|2003a|p=65}} Another function of heavenly ascent was as a mode of divine revelation reflected in Greco-Roman, early Jewish, and early Christian literary sources, in which particular individuals with prophetic or revelatory gifts are thought to have experienced a heavenly journey during which they learned cosmic and divine secrets.{{sfn|Aune|2003a|p=65}} Figures familiar to Jews would have included [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] (from the [[Book of Genesis]] and a popular non-Biblical work called [[1 Enoch]]); the 5th-century sage [[Ezra]]; [[Baruch ben Neriah|Baruch]] the companion of the prophet [[Jeremiah]] (from a work called [[2 Baruch]], in which Baruch is promised he will ascend to heaven after 40 days); [[Levi]] the ancestor of priests; the [[Teacher of Righteousness]] from the [[Qumran]] community; the prophet [[Elijah]] (from [[2 Kings]]); [[Moses]], who was deified on entering heaven; and the children of [[Book of Job|Job]], who according to the [[Testament of Job]] ascended heaven following their [[resurrection from the dead]].{{sfn|Munoa|2000|p=109}}{{sfn|Zwiep|2016|p=16}} Non-Jewish readers would have been familiar with the case of the emperor [[Augustus]], whose ascent was witnessed by Senators; [[Romulus]] the founder of Rome, who, like Jesus, was taken to heaven in a cloud; the Greek hero [[Heracles]] (Hercules); and others.{{sfn|McDonald|2004|p=21}}

== Christian theology ==
[[File:The Ascension of Jesus - Orthodox.ogv|thumb|Orthodox [[Feast of the Ascension]]]]
The common thread linking all the New Testament ascension references, reflected in the major [[Christian creeds]] and confessional statements, is the [[heavenly session|exaltation of Jesus]], meaning that through his ascension Jesus took his seat at the right hand of God in Heaven:{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|p=114}} "He ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty." ([[Apostles' Creed]]) It implies the human Jesus being taken into Heaven and marks the beginning of Christ's heavenly rule, and its hold on the Christian imagination is evidenced by its importance in Christian art through the centuries.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|p=114}}

== Liturgy: Feast of the Ascension==
[[File:Dosso Dossi 022.jpg||thumb|200px|''The Ascension'', [[Dosso Dossi]], 16th century.]]
{{Main article|Feast of the Ascension}}{{Main article|Ascension of Jesus in Christian art}}
The [[Feast of the Ascension]] is one of the [[ecumenical]]  (i.e., universally celebrated) feasts of the Christian [[liturgical year]], along with the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]], [[Easter]], [[Pentecost]], and [[Christmas]]. Ascension Day is traditionally celebrated on the sixth Thursday after Easter Sunday, the fortieth day from [[Easter]] day, although some Roman Catholic provinces have moved the observance to the following Sunday to facilitate the obligation to attend Mass. [[Saint Jerome]] held that it was of Apostolic origin, but in fact the ascension was originally part of [[Pentecost]] (the coming of the [[Holy Spirit]]), and developed as a separate celebration only slowly from the late 4th century onward. In the Catholic tradition it begins with a three-day "rogation" to ask for God's mercy, and the feast itself includes a procession of torches and banners symbolising Christ's journey to the Mount of Olives and entry into heaven, the extinguishing of the [[Paschal candle]], and an all-night vigil; white is the liturgical colour. The orthodox tradition has a slightly different calendar up to a month later than in the Western tradition; the [[Anglican communion]] continues to observe the feast, but most [[Protestant]] churches have abandoned the traditional Christian calendar of feasts.{{sfn|Quast|2011|p=45}}{{sfn|Stokl-Ben-Ezra|2007|p=286}}

== In Christian art ==
The ascension has been a frequent subject in [[Christian art]].{{sfn|Becchio|Schadé|2006|loc=unpaginated}} By the 6th century the iconography of the ascension had been established and by the 9th century ascension scenes were being depicted on domes of churches.{{sfn|Baggley|2000|p=137-138}}{{sfn|Jensen|2008|p=51-53}} The [[Rabbula Gospels]] (c. 586) include some of the earliest images of the ascension.{{sfn|Jensen|2008|p=51-53}} Many ascension scenes have two parts, an upper (Heavenly) part and a lower (earthly) part. The ascending Christ may be carrying a resurrection banner or make a sign of benediction with his right hand.{{sfn|Earls|1987|p=26-27}} The blessing gesture by Christ with his right hand is directed towards the earthly group below him and signifies that he is blessing the entire Church.{{sfn|Ouspensky|Lossky|1999|p=197}} In the left hand, he may be holding a Gospel or a scroll, signifying teaching and preaching.{{sfn|Ouspensky|Lossky|1999|p=197}}

The [[Eastern Orthodox]] portrayal of the ascension is a major metaphor for the mystical nature of the Church.{{sfn|Nes|2005|p=87}} In many Eastern icons the [[Virgin Mary]] is placed at the center of the scene in the earthly part of the depiction, with her hands raised towards Heaven, often accompanied by various Apostles.{{sfn|Nes|2005|p=87}} The upwards-looking depiction of the earthly group matches the Eastern liturgy on the Feast of the Ascension: "Come, let us rise and turn our eyes and thoughts high&amp;nbsp;..."{{sfn|Ouspensky|Lossky|1999|p=197}}

The traditional site of the ascension is [[Mount Olivet]] (the "Mount of Olives"), on which the village of Bethany sits. Before the conversion of Constantine in 312 AD, early Christians honored the ascension of Christ in a cave on the Mount, and by 384 the ascension was venerated on the present site, uphill from the cave.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

Around the year 390 a wealthy [[Roman Empire|Roman]] woman named Poimenia financed construction of the original [[Church (building)|church]] called "[[Eleona Basilica]]" (''elaion'' in Greek means "olive garden", from ''elaia'' "olive tree," and has an oft-mentioned similarity to ''eleos'' meaning "mercy"). This church was destroyed by [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid Persians]] in 614. It was subsequently rebuilt, destroyed, and rebuilt again by the [[Crusaders]]. This final church was later destroyed by Muslims, leaving only a 12x12 meter octagonal structure (called a ''martyrium''—"memorial"—or "Edicule") that remains to this day.{{cn|date=October 2018}} The site was ultimately acquired by two emissaries of [[Saladin]] in the year 1198 and has remained in the possession of the Islamic [[Waqf]] of Jerusalem ever since. The [[Russian Orthodox Church]] also maintains a [[convent]] of the ascension on the top of the Mount of Olives.

The '''Bahá'í/Bábí split''' occurred when most [[Bábí]]s accepted [[Bahá'u'lláh]] as the messiah of the [[Báb|Báb's]] writings, leading them to become [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]], and leaving a remnant of Bábís who became known as [[Azalis]].  The split occurred after Bahá'í founder Bahá'u'lláh made his claims to be the messiah public in 1866, leading to expressions of support from the majority of the [[Bábís|Bábí]] community, and opposition from [[Subh-i-Azal]], who became the leader of the remaining group.

==The Báb==
{{main|Báb|Bábism}}

Siyyid `Alí-Muhammad was a merchant from [[Shiraz, Iran|Shiraz]], [[Persian Empire|Persia]], who at the age of 25, claimed to be a new and independent [[Manifestation of God]], and the promised [[Al-Qa'im (person)|Qá'im]], or [[Mahdi|Mihdí]] of [[Islam]]. In his early writings he took on the title of the Báb, meaning "Gate", after a [[Shi'a Islam|Shi'a]] religious concept that explained he was only a, 'door', or 'gate', for a soon to come Manifestation of God, or Prophet.  His followers were therefore known as [[Bábís]]. He later declared that he was not just, 'the Gate', or the Bab, but he was the Qa'im, or Promised One himself.&lt;ref name="EoA"&gt;{{cite book | chapter = Resurgence of Apocalyptic in Modern Islam | first = Abbas | last = Amanat | editor = Stein, Stephen J. | title = The Encyclopedia of Apocalypticism, vol. III: Apocalypticism in the Modern Period and the Contemporary Age. | location = New York | publisher = Continuum | year = 2000 | pages = 241–242 | isbn = 0-8264-1255-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Báb's writings had the concept of the returning messiah called, "[[He whom God shall make manifest]]". As the Báb's teachings spread, the Islamic government saw his following as a threat to the state religion. Several military confrontations took place between government and Bábí forces. The Báb was imprisoned and executed by firing squad in [[Tabriz]] on July 9, 1850.

==Succession==
In most of his prominent writings, the Báb alluded to a Promised One, most commonly referred to as "[[Him whom God shall make manifest]]", and that he himself was "but a ring upon the hand of Him Whom God shall make manifest." The [[Bayán (exposition)|Bayán]] is essentially a discourse on Him whom God shall make manifest, and the Báb always discussed his own writings in the context of the coming of Him Whom God shall make manifest.&lt;ref name="Saiedi344"&gt;{{Harvnb|Saiedi|2008|p=344}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the Báb's writings state the coming of Him Whom God shall make manifest would be imminent.&lt;ref name="Saiedi344"/&gt;

The Báb eliminated the institution of successorship or vicegerency to his movement, and stated that no other person's writings would be binding after his death until Him Whom God shall make manifest would appear.&lt;ref name="Saiedi344"/&gt;

He did, however, appoint a nominal leader after himself. Shortly before the Báb's execution, a follower of the Báb, Abd al-Karim, brought to the Báb's attention the necessity to appoint a leader; thus the Báb wrote a certain number of tablets which he gave to Abd al-Karim to deliver to Subh-i-Azal and Bahá'u'lláh.&lt;ref name="amanat384"&gt;{{Harvnb|Amanat|1989|p=384}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tablets were later interpreted by both Azalis and Bahá'ís as proof of the Báb's delegation of leadership.&lt;ref name="amanat384" /&gt; Bahá'í sources state that the Báb did this at the suggestion of Bahá'u'lláh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|`Abdu'l-Bahá|2004|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Taherzadeh|1976|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of the tablets, which is commonly referred to as the ''"Will and Testament of the Báb"'', Subh-i-Azal is viewed to have been appointed as leader of the Bábis after the death of the movement's founder; the tablet, in verse 27, also appears to order Subh-i-Azal "...to obey Him Whom God Shall Make Manifest."&lt;ref name = "Manuchehri (2004)"&gt;{{Harvnb|Manuchehri|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple versions of this tablet exist, and Browne notes in his translation that this copy of the letter is actually in Subh-i-Azal's handwriting rather than the Báb's.&lt;ref name = "Hamadani (1893)"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hamadani|1893|pp=426}} [http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/diglib/books/K-O/M/MirzaHuseyn/TJ426.gif] &amp; [http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/diglib/books/K-O/M/MirzaHuseyn/TJ426a.gif]&lt;/ref&gt; Browne, discussing a visit with Subh-i-Azal in Cyprus, notes that he saw the original document in the Báb's own handwriting.&lt;ref name = "Browne (1897) p. 763"&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1897|p=763}} [http://www.h-net.msu.edu/~bahai/diglib/articles/A-E/browne/brznjan1.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the difficulties of collecting original Bábí documents at such a distance — Browne was at Cambridge — was the widespread Azali practice of ''[[Taqiyya]]'' (Dissimulation), or concealing one's beliefs.&lt;ref name = "Manuchehri (1999)"&gt;{{Harvnb|Manuchehri|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Browne appears to have been unaware of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Balyuzi|1970|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Browne, Iranica"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | title = Browne, Edward Granville ii. Browne on Babism and Bahaism | encyclopedia = Encyclopaedia Iranica Online | volume = 4 | year = 2009 | url = http://www.iranica.com/newsite/index.isc?Article=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/unicode/v4f5/v4f5a014.html | accessdate = 2009-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Bahá'í/Bábí split#Azali Taqiyya (Dissimulation)|Azali Taqiyya (Dissimulation)]] below.)

==Leadership and confrontation==
Subh-i-Azal's leadership was controversial. He generally absented himself from the Bábí community spending his time in [[Baghdad]] in hiding and disguise; and even went so far as to publicly disavow allegiance to the Báb on several occasions.&lt;ref name="cole_bio"&gt;{{cite web | title = A Brief Biography of Baha'u'llah | last = Cole| first = Juan| accessdate=2006-06-22 | url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jrcole/bahabio.htm | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060710185629/http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jrcole/bahabio.htm| archivedate= 10 July 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iranica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Iranica |year= 1989 |article=Azali Babism | first = Dennis | last = MacEoin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Barrett p. 246"/&gt; Subh-i-Azal gradually alienated himself from a large proportion of the Bábís who started to give their alliance to other claimants.&lt;ref name="iranica" /&gt; During the time that both Bahá'u'lláh and Subh-i-Azal were in Baghdad, since Subh-i-Azal remained in hiding, Bahá'u'lláh performed much of the daily administration of the Bábí affairs.&lt;ref name="cole_bio"/&gt;

[[Bahá'u'lláh]] claimed that in 1852, while a prisoner in Tehran, he was visited by a "[[Maid of Heaven]]", which symbolically marked the beginning of his mission as a Messenger of God. In 1863 as he was leaving Baghdad in the [[Garden of Ridván, Baghdad|Garden of Ridván]], he made his first public declaration to be [[Him Whom God Shall Make Manifest]], the messianic figure in the Báb's writings, to a small number of followers.&lt;ref name="iranica" /&gt; This declaration started a new phase of leadership in the Bábí community that would eventually lead to the emergence of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] as a separate movement distinct from Bábism.&lt;ref name="PSmith23"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in [[Adrianople]] (current-day [[Edirne, Turkey]]), Bahá'u'lláh was the clear leader of the newly established Bábí community, and a permanent break between Bahá'u'lláh and Subh-i-Azal occurred.&lt;ref name="PSmith23"/&gt;

In 1865 Subh-i-Azal was accused of attempting to plot to kill Bahá'u'lláh.&lt;ref name="PSmith24"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contemporary accounts, Subh-i Azal is reported to have tried to have Bahá'u'lláh assassinated at the hands of the barber of the local bath. The barber, Muhammad `Alí of Isfahán, apparently refused and spread word of the danger around the community. Bahá'u'lláh is reported to have counselled "on all patience, quietude and gentleness".&lt;ref name = "Browne (1918) p. 17"&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1918|p=17}} [http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/diglib/books/A-E/B/browne/material/msbrtoc.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; This pattern was repeated when, according to the personal account of Ustád Muhammad-`Alíy-i Salmání, Subh-i Azal attempted to persuade him likewise to murder Bahá'u'lláh in the bath.&lt;ref name = "Salmání (1982) p. 51"&gt;{{Harvnb|Salmání|1982|p=51}} [http://bahai-library.com/salmani_memories_bahaullah]&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually Subh-i-Azal attempted to poison Bahá'u'lláh that left him gravely ill for a time, and left him with a shaking hand for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name="PSmith24"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1918|p=16}} [http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/diglib/books/A-E/B/browne/material/qazvini.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Cole, J.R.I. |authorlink = Juan Cole |title = Bahá'u'lláh's Surah of God: Text, Translation, Commentary |journal = Translations of Shaykhi, Babi and Bahá'í Texts |year = 2002 |volume =  6 |issue =  1 |url = http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/trans/vol6/surall.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, followers of Azal made the counter-claim that Bahá'u'lláh had accidentally poisoned himself while trying to poison others.&lt;ref&gt;Mirza Aqa Khan Kirmani made this claim later in his ''[[Hasht-Bihisht (Azali text)|Hasht-Bihisht]]''. This book is abstracted in part by E.G.

However, due to the practice of ''[[Taqiyya]]'' (Dissimulation) among Azalis and contemporary historians recognize that: "The Azali Babis and in particular Mirza Aqa Khan Kirmani and Shaykh Ahmad Ruhi showed little hesitation in alteration and falsification of Babi teachings and history in their works." Manuchehri (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Smith also notes that the Bahá'í accounts of this dispute seem to be credible.&lt;ref name="PSmith24"/&gt;

After this event in 1866 Bahá'u'lláh made his claim to be Him Whom God Shall Make Manifest public,&lt;ref name="iranica" /&gt; as well as making a formal written announcement to Subh-i-Azal referring to his followers for the first time as the "''people of Bahá''".&lt;ref name="PSmith24"/&gt; After his public announcement, Bahá'u'lláh secluded himself in his house and instructed the Bábís to choose between himself and Subh-i-Azal.&lt;ref name="PSmith24"/&gt; Bahá'u'lláh's claims threatened Subh-i-Azal's position as leader of the religion since it would mean little to be leader of the Bábís if "Him Whom God Shall Make Manifest" were to appear and start a new religion.&lt;ref name="cole_bio"/&gt; Subhh-i-Azal responded by making his own claims, but his attempt to preserve the traditional Bábísm was largely unpopular, and his followers became the minority.&lt;ref name="iranica" /&gt;

In 1867, Subh-i-Azal challenged Bahá'u'lláh to a test of the divine will in a local mosque in Edirne (Adrianople),&lt;ref name="PSmith24"/&gt; such that "God would strike down the impostor."  Bahá'u'lláh agreed, and went to the Sultan Selim mosque at the appointed time, but Mirza Yahya lost face and lost credibility when he refused to show up.&lt;ref name="PSmith24"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Browne (1918) p. 18"&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1918|p=18}} [http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/diglib/books/A-E/B/browne/material/qazvini.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Salmání (1982) pp. 94-95"&gt;{{Harvnb|Salmání|1982|pp=94–95}} [http://bahai-library.com/salmani_memories_bahaullah]&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually Bahá'u'lláh was recognized by the vast majority of Bábís as "He whom God shall make manifest" and his followers began calling themselves [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]].&lt;ref name="cole_bio"/&gt; The small minority of Bábís that followed Subh-i-Azal became known as [[Azalis]].

==Exile of community==
After the Bábí community was separated into two, the Azalis tried to discredit Bahá'u'lláh to the Ottoman authorities, accusing him of  	 causing agitation against the government.&lt;ref name="PSmith26"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; While an investigation cleared Bahá'u'lláh, it did notify the government that Bahá'u'lláh and Subh-i-Azal were propagating religious claims, and may cause future disorder, and thus led to the further exile of the 'Bábí' leaders.&lt;ref name="PSmith26"/&gt; A royal command was issued in July 1868 condemning the Bábís to perpetual imprisonment and isolation in far-flung outposts of the Ottoman Empire — [[Famagusta]], [[Cyprus]] for Subh-i-Azal and his followers, and [[Acre, Israel|`Akká]], in Ottoman [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], for Bahá'u'lláh and his followers.&lt;ref name="PSmith26"/&gt;

While most of those that followed Subh-i-Azal were sent to Cyprus, some were sent to Akká, intended to serve as spies.&lt;ref name="PSmith26"/&gt;  In 1872 a few Bahá'ís decided to kill the followers of Subh-i-Azal as they were causing endless difficulties to the Bahá'í community.&lt;ref name="PSmith26"/&gt; Bahá'u'lláh strongly condemned the action,&lt;ref name="PSmith26"/&gt; and publicly condemned the murderers as clear violators of Bahá'í law.&lt;ref name = "Browne (1891) p. 370"&gt;Browne (1891) [http://www.h-net.msu.edu/~bahai/diglib/books/A-E/B/browne/tn/tnappx2.htm p. 370]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Browne (1918) p. 45"&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1918|p=45}} [http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/diglib/books/A-E/B/browne/material/qazvini.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] authorities initially hardened the imprisonment of Bahá'u'lláh. But as Bahá'u'lláh was later exonerated by the authorities as having no connection to the murders, their imprisonment was eased.

==After the split==
Eventually Bahá'u'lláh was recognized by the vast majority of Bábís as "He whom God shall make manifest" and his followers began calling themselves [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]].&lt;ref name="cole_bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Barrett p. 246"&gt;{{Harvnb|Barrett|2001|pp=246–247}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1908 there were probably from half a million to a million Bahá'ís, and at most only a hundred followers of Subhh-i-Azal. Subh-i Azal died in [[Famagusta]], [[Cyprus]] in 1912, and his followers are known as [[Azalis]] or Azali Bábis. MacEoin notes that after the deaths of those Azali Babis who were active in the [[Iranian Constitutional Revolution|Constitutional Revolution]] in Iran, the Azali form of Babism entered a stagnation which it has not recovered as there is no acknowledged leader or central organization.&lt;ref name="iranica" /&gt; Current estimates of Azalis are that there are no more than a few thousand.&lt;ref name = "Barrett p. 246"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Azali | encyclopedia = Britannica Concise Encyclopedia | volume = 2006 | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica | url = http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9356264/Azali | accessdate = 26 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''World Religion Database'' estimated 7.3 million Bahá'ís in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Johnson| first =Todd M. |author2=Brian J.

After Bahá'u'lláh's death, leadership of the religion then passed on to [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], Bahá'u'lláh's son, who was appointed by Bahá'u'lláh, and was accepted by almost all Bahá'ís.&lt;ref name="iranica"/&gt; After the death of `Abdu'l-Bahá in 1921, the leadership of the Bahá'í community was passed on to his grandson, [[Shoghi Effendi]], who  was appointed in `Abdu'l-Bahá's [[Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá|will]]. The document appointed [[Shoghi Effendi]] as the first Guardian, and called for the election of the [[Universal House of Justice]] once the Bahá'í Faith had spread sufficiently for such elections to be meaningful. Shoghi Effendi died in 1957, and in 1963 the [[Universal House of Justice]] was elected. Since 1963 the Universal House of Justice has been elected every five years and remains the successor and leading institution of the religion.&lt;ref name="iranica"/&gt;

There are conflicting reports as to whom Subh-i-Azal appointed as his successor. [[Edward Granville Browne|Browne]] reports that there was confusion over who was to be Subh-i-Azal's successor at his death. Subh-i-Azal's son, Rizwán `Ali, reported that he had appointed the son of Aqa Mirza Muhammad Hadi Daulatabadi as his successor; while another, H.C. Lukach's, states that Mirza Yahya had said that whichever of his sons "resembled him the most" would be the successor. None appear to have stepped forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1918|pp=312–314}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Denis MacEoin|MacEoin]] notes that Subh-i-Azal appointed his son, Yahya Dawlatabadi, as his successor, but he notes that there is little evidence that Yahya Dawlatabadi was involved in the affairs of the religion,&lt;ref name="iranica" /&gt; and that instead he spent his time as that of secular reformer.&lt;ref name="EoI"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Subh-i-Azal | encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam | accessdate=2008-01-29 | first = Denis | last = MacEoin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shoghi Effendi reports that Mirza Yahya appointed a distinguished Bábí, Aqa Mirza Muhammad Hadi of Daulatabad (Mirza Hadiy-i-Dawlat-Abadi) successor, but he later publicly recanted his faith in the Báb and in Mirza Yahya. Mirza Yahya's eldest son apparently became a Bahá'í himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Effendi|1944|p=233}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Momen, M. |title = The Cyprus Exiles |journal = Bahá'í Studies Bulletin |year = 1991 |page=99 |url = http://bahai-library.com/momen_cyprus_exiles }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Azali Taqiyya (Dissimulation)==
The practice of ''[[Taqiyya]]'' (Dissimulation, or concealing one's beliefs) was widespread among Azalis.&lt;ref name = "Manuchehri (1999)"/&gt; While the primary means of transmitting copies of documents was manually copying them which could introduce discrepancies between copies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Cole |first = J. |title = ''Nuqtat al-Kaf'' and the Babi Chronicle Traditions |journal = Research Notes in Shaykhi, Babi and Bahá'í Studies |volume =  2 | issue =  6 |pages =106–107 |date = August 1998 |url = http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/notes/vol2/babihist.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; the practice of ''taqiyya'' led some to actually alter and falsify Bábí teachings and history.&lt;ref name = "Manuchehri (1999)"/&gt; This compromised their campaign against Bahá'u'lláh. One historian has concluded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Bahaullah clearly announced that the recognition of the manifestation of God and ‘steadfastness’ [in] His Cause is more important than observing any of the other teachings. Gradual abandonment of taqiyyah amongst the Baha’is was one of the distinguishing feature[s] of the new religion from the Babi era. After this time the practice of taqiyyah became unofficially superseded.

"In contrast the Azali Babis glorified taqiyyah in their literature. Taqiyyah was considered a virtue and classified into various levels of concealment. Prominent Azali leaders openly recanted their faith and even abused Bab and Azal in the process. The extent of taqiyyah in their words and actions caused Mirza Abu’l-Fadl to question [[Edward Granville Browne|Edward Browne’s]] method of portraying of Azali Babis. Taqiyyah became one of the distinguishing features of the Azali-Bahai split."&lt;ref name = "Manuchehri (1999)"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Compounding the problem of collecting reliable manuscripts, Azali ''taqiyya'' had the effect of rendering many early Bábí documents unreliable afterwards, as Azali Bábís would often alter and falsify Bábí teachings and history.&lt;ref name = "Manuchehri (1999)"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example, the problems with the version of the ''Nuqtatu'l-Kaf'' translated and published in 1910 by E.G. Browne are noted by MacEoin ({{cite journal |last = MacEoin |first = D. |title = Hierarchy, Authority and Eschatology in Early Bábí Thought |journal = In Iran: Studies in Bábí and Bahá'í History |volume =  3 |pages =106–107 |year = 1986 |url = http://bahai-library.com/maceoin_hierarchy_authority_babi }}), and addressed by Balyuzi (1970, pp. 70-88) and Cole ({{cite journal |last = Cole |first = J. |title = ''Nuqtat al-Kaf'' and the Babi Chronicle Traditions |journal = Research Notes in Shaykhi, Babi and Bahá'í Studies |volume =  2 | issue =  6 |pages =106–107 |date = August 1998 |url = http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/notes/vol2/babihist.htm }}) who notes that material on Mirza Yahya was likely added to that manuscript in 1864.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Doctrinal disputes==

===The completion of the Bayán===
The [[Arabic Bayán]] is a book written by the Báb around 1848, and is the smaller sister book to the [[Persian Bayán]]. The work is incomplete, containing only eleven chapters of a supposedly total nineteen. In the tablet that is considered the Báb's will and testament, he gives permission to Subh-i-Azal to finish the remaining eight, with the permission of Him Whom God Shall Make Manifest.&lt;ref name="Saiedi344"/&gt; The Azalis believe that this means that the Báb authorized Subh-i-Azal to finish the text of the Arabic Bayán.&lt;ref name="Saiedi344"/&gt;  However, Saiedi states that even if it is assumed that Subh-i-Azal was allowed to finish the remaining chapters of the book, it could only happen if He whom God shall make manifest had already appeared and had revealed the eight chapters for him.&lt;ref name="Saiedi345"&gt;{{Harvnb|Saiedi|2008|p=345}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Báb states that after his death no one else's writings will be binding until the appearance of He whom God shall make manifest, and the text of the Arabic Bayán was written in a style termed "divine verses", and the Báb states that in another one of his writings that after him only He whom God shall make manifest can reveal divine verses.&lt;ref name="Saiedi345"/&gt; Subh-i-Azal did write a book that was supposed to complete the Bayán, the Mutammim-i-Bayan, but instead of completing the Arabic Bayán, he tries to extend the Persian Bayán; it seems Subh-i-Azal, unlike his followers, did not understand the reference of the Báb to mean that he had to complete the Arabic Bayán.&lt;ref name="Saiedi346"&gt;{{Harvnb|Saiedi|2008|pp=346–347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saiedi also points to another translation and interpretation of the version in the Báb's letter: the Báb's use the word ''manahij (paths)'' in two ways; in one way it refers to the chapters of the Bayán, and in another way it refers to the entire Bayán and his laws.&lt;ref name="Saiedi346"/&gt; Saiedi states that the reference to manifesting the eight paths may refer to the distribution of the eight copies of the Bayán that the Báb had sent to Subh-i-Azal, to the eight individuals who are identified in the letter, when the Promised One appears.&lt;ref name="Saiedi346"/&gt;

===Year of revelation===
The Báb prophesied that the [[messianic figure]] [[He whom God shall make manifest]] would emerge some time in the future. Many of the Báb's writings support the belief that He whom God shall make manifest's arrival would be imminent.&lt;ref name="Saiedi344"/&gt; The Bahá'í belief is that the Báb's writings allude to the year 9, while the Azali belief is that He whom God shall make manifest would come after 2000 years.

In Azali belief, the Promised One could not appear until the realization of the laws of the Bayán and the maturation of the Bayán in 2000 years.&lt;ref name="Saiedi345"/&gt; However, there are problems with this belief and inconsistencies in Azali belief.  The Azalis believe that the Báb gave permission for Subh-i-Azal to complete the Arabic Bayán with the permission of He whom God shall make manifest, thus pointing to He whom God shall make manifest appearing in Subh-i-Azal's own lifetime.&lt;ref name="Saiedi345"/&gt; Also, the ''Nuqtatu'l-Kaf'', an Azali text, states that the laws of the Bayán may be abrogated a few years after the Báb's death, and that He whom God shall make manifest may appear within Subh-i-Azal's lifetime.&lt;ref name="Saiedi346"/&gt; The Azali view that the appearance of He whom God shall make manifest can only occur thousands of years in the future is also problematic, since in some of their texts they state that Subh-i-Azal is He whom God shall make manifest.&lt;ref name="Saiedi346"/&gt;

The Báb writes in many of his texts about the imminent appearance of the Promised One. In many of his writings he refers to the year nine and nineteen from the beginning of his claimed revelation (1844) as to the appearance of He whom God shall make manifest.&lt;ref name="Saiedi351"&gt;{{Harvnb|Saiedi|2008|pp=351–357}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also uses the [[Abjad numerals]] of Arabic, a system of providing numerical values for letters and words, to identify the coming of He whom God shall make manifest, referring the manifest aspect of the [[Bahá'í symbols#The Greatest Name|Most Great Name of God]] as ''"Vahid"'' which has a numerical value of 19 and the hidden aspect of the same name as "''Bahá''" which has a numerical value of 9.&lt;ref name="Saiedi351"/&gt; Bahá'ís point to the Báb's allusions to the years nine (1853) and nineteen (1863) in the Báb's writings as a prophecy of [[Bahá'u'lláh]] being He whom God shall make manifest. Bahá'u'lláh claimed that while being imprisoned in the [[Siyah-Chal]] in 1853 in Iran he underwent a series of mystical experiences including having a vision of the ''Maid of Heaven'' who told him of his divine mission, and the promise of divine assistance.&lt;ref name="Saiedi352"&gt;{{Harvnb|Saiedi|2008|p=352}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PSmith2"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Bahá'u'lláh &amp;ndash; Life |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1863 as he was leaving Baghdad in the [[Garden of Ridván, Baghdad|Garden of Ridván]], Bahá'u'lláh made his first public declaration to be [[Him Whom God Shall Make Manifest]].&lt;ref name="iranica" /&gt;

==Bahá'í views of the split==
Bahá'ís argue that succession in the Bábí religion was superseded when the [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í Faith's]] founder [[Bahá'u'lláh]] declared himself to be [[He whom God shall make manifest]] - they often describe Subh-i-Azal as an "interim head."

Bahá'ís view Subh-i-Azal's leadership largely as a nominal head. According to Taherzadeh:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mirza Yahya [Subh-i-Azal] came into prominence not because he possessed any outstanding qualities, but rather through his close link with Bahá'u'lláh. In order to divert the attention of the enemies of the Faith from the person of Bahá'u'lláh, Who had emerged as a focal point among the early believers, the Báb wholeheartedly approved the suggestion of nominating the youthful and relatively unknown Mirza Yahya [Subh-i-Azal] as the chief of the Bábí community. This suggestion had come from Bahá'u'lláh, and only two others were aware of the plan, namely, Bahá'u'lláh's faithful brother [[Mírzá Músá]] (Áqáy-i-Kalím) and a certain Mulla Abdu'l-Karim-i-Qazvini, who had been entrusted by the Báb, shortly before His martyrdom, with the task of delivering His pen-case, seals and writings to Bahá'u'lláh; he was subsequently martyred in Tihran at the time of Bahá'u'lláh's imprisonment in the Siyah-Chal.

The advantages of this nomination were obvious and, as this system operated for some time, those who were endowed with insight and wisdom were able to see that Mirza Yahya was only a figurehead, and that it was the guiding hand of Bahá'u'lláh alone that was unobtrusively directing the affairs of the Bábí community after the martyrdom of the Báb."&lt;ref name = "Taherzadeh (1992)"&gt;{{Harvnb|Taherzadeh|1992|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This view is supported by the Báb's long-time secretary Mulla Abdu'l-Karim-i-Qazvini, believed to be the only other person who participated in the plan.  John Walbridge writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"With him [Mulla Abdu'l-Karim-i-Qazvini] Bahá'u'lláh originated the plan to proclaim Mirza Yahya as the Báb's successor while keeping him in hiding &amp;mdash; this in order to deflect attention from Bahá'u'lláh, who was well known to the authorities and the people."&lt;ref name = "Walbridge (1997)"&gt;{{Harvnb|Walbridge|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Qazvini himself wrote in a letter in 1851 describing the urgency that the friends do nothing to call attention to Bahá'u'lláh during his period of messianic secrecy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"But it is requested, according to his [Bahá'u'lláh] command, that the friends should desist from hinting around (shivih-ha) about him, as they had in the past, in such a way that they provoked troubles for the friends of God; and that they should avoid bringing sorrow upon that gentleman, who is of gentle disposition.
...
Let them not provoke investigations or cause the encounter with God to become more distant, or become a veil of chains and manacles between the servants and the Lord of Lords any more than they already have been."&lt;ref name = "Qazvini Letter"&gt;Letter from `Abdu'l-Karim Qazvini to Sayyid Javad Karbala'i, c. August 1851, translated by Cole (1997) [http://www.h-net.msu.edu/~bahai/trans/vol1/qazvini/qazvini1.htm]. `Abdu'l-Karim Qazvini was one of The Báb's secretaries, and his primary contact with the Bábí's in [[Tehran]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Near the end of his life the Báb had his remaining writings, other ''accoutrement'', as well as a particular tablet addressed to Bahá'u'lláh, delivered to him.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In Qum, shortly before the Báb's martyrdom, he received a coffer from the Báb containing the last of his writings and his pen-case, seals, rings, and the famous pentacle tablet containing 350 derivatives of the word Bahá. He left the same day for Tehran, explaining that the Báb's accompanying letter ordered him to deliver it to Bahá'u'lláh."&lt;ref name = "Walbridge (1997)"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bahá'ís believes there is symbolism in the Báb sending to Báhá'u'llah not only all of his remaining writings, but his seals and his pens, literally handing over the instruments of revelation, along with the pentacle tablet written in his own hand confirming Bahá'u'lláh's station. The Báb's Will &amp; Testament, which was unambiguously directed to Subh-i-Azal, makes it clear that he would not be the One promised by the Báb:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We order you to obey Him Whom God Shall Make Manifest. He will verily appear amongst this people with a sublime reign in the final resurrection. Verily we are all servants and kneel down before Him. He shall carry out whatever He wishes, with permission from His Lord. He shall not be questioned for his actions. However, all others are responsible for everything they do." [verses 27-29]&lt;ref name = "Manuchehri (2004)"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Regarding Subh-i-Azal, common Bahá'í belief is summarised by [[Shoghi Effendi]], who wrote that Subh-i-Azal was "good-natured yet susceptible to the slightest influence".&lt;ref name = "GPB, p. 90"&gt;{{Harvnb|Effendi|1944|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a reference to Siyyid Muhammad-i-Isfahani, who is accused of conspiring with Subh-i-Azal and leading him astray.&lt;ref name = "Abdu'l-Bahá (1886) p. 55"&gt;{{Harvnb|`Abdu'l-Bahá|2004|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is sometimes described as the Bahá'í "anti-Christ".&lt;ref name = "Taherzadeh (1984) pp. 24 &amp; 56"&gt;{{Harvnb|Taherzadeh|1984|pp=24,56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taherzadeh (1987) pp. 236 &amp; 444"&gt;{{Harvnb|Taherzadeh|1987|pp= 236,444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Azali view of the split==
Azalis rejected the divine claims of Bahá'u'lláh, arguing that the world must first accept the laws of the Báb before ''He Whom God Shall Make Manifest'' can appear.&lt;ref name = "Britannica: Azali"&gt;{{cite web | title = Azali | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica | url = http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9011527/Azali | accessdate = 2006-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Berlin Stadtschloss.jpg|thumbnail|300px|The Berliner Stadtschloss (or Stadtschloß) in a 19th-century painting]]
The '''Berlin Palace''' ({{lang-de|Berliner Schloss}} or ''Stadtschloss''), also known as the '''Berlin City Palace''', is a building in the centre of [[Berlin]], located on the [[Museum Island]] at [[Schloßplatz (Berlin)|Schlossplatz]], opposite the [[Lustgarten]] park. It was a royal and imperial palace and served mostly as the main residence of the [[List of rulers of Brandenburg|Electors of Brandenburg]], the [[King of Prussia|Kings of Prussia]] and the [[German Emperor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Wolf Burchard |url=https://www.apollo-magazine.com/whats-the-point-of-rebuilding-germanys-palaces |title=What's the point of rebuilding Germany's palace |publisher=Apollo Magazine |date= |accessdate=2018-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demolished by the [[government of East Germany]] the 1950s, the palace is currently being rebuilt, with completion expected in 2019. The reconstructed palace will be the seat of the [[Humboldt Forum]], a museum for world culture which is a successor museum of the Ancient Prussian Art Chamber, which was also located in the Berlin Palace. The Humboldt Forum has been described as the German equivalent of the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Tim Adams |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/apr/17/neil-macgregor-britain-germany-humboldt-forum-berlin |title=Neil MacGregor: ‘Britain forgets its past. Germany confronts it’ &amp;#124; Culture |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The palace was originally built in the 15th century and changed throughout the next few centuries. It bore features of the [[Baroque]] style, and its shape, finalised by the middle 18th century, is for the most part attributed to German architect [[Andreas Schlüter]], whose first design is likely to date from 1702, though the palace incorporated earlier parts seen in 1688 by [[Nicodemus Tessin the Younger|Nicodemus Tessin]]. It served as a residence to various [[Electors of Brandenburg]]. It was the principal residence and winter residence of the [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] [[Kings of Prussia]] from 1701 to 1918. After the [[unification of Germany]] in 1871, it also became the central residence for the [[German Emperors]]. After the proclamation of the [[Weimar Republic]] in 1918, the palace became a museum. In [[World War II]], the building was heavily damaged by Allied bombings. Although it could have been repaired, the palace was demolished in 1950 by the [[German Democratic Republic]] authorities, despite criticism. In the 1970s, the [[Palace of the Republic, Berlin|Palace of the Republic]] was constructed on its site, but demolished in 2008 to make place for the reconstruction of the old palace.

Following the [[reunification of Germany]], it was decided to rebuild the entire exterior of the palace in the original style except for the east side. The authentically reconstructed facades will include various remnant sculptures and rocks of the original palace. The interior will be modern, except the facades of one of the courts which is constructed in original style (Schlüterhof). However, the floorplan has been designed to allow potential future reconstruction of notable historical rooms. The building will house the [[Humboldtforum]] museum and congress complex, and is scheduled to be finished 14 September 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=So verlief das Richtfest am Berliner Schloss (Topping-out wreath ceremony at the Palace, German article)|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/menschen-steine-sensationen-so-verlief-das-richtfest-am-berliner-schloss/11911454.html|website=Tagesspiegel|accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History up to 1871==

The palace replaced an earlier fort or castle guarding the crossing of the [[Spree|Spree river]] at [[Cölln]], a neighboring town which merged with  Berlin in 1710. The castle stood on Fishers' Island, as the southern end of the [[Museum Island]] in the Spree is known. In 1443 [[Frederick II, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick II]] "Irontooth", [[Margrave of Brandenburg|Margrave and Prince Elector of Brandenburg]], laid the foundations of Berlin's first fortification in a section of swampy wasteland north of Cölln. At the completion of the castle in 1451, Frederick moved there from the town of [[Brandenburg an der Havel|Brandenburg]]. The main role of the castle and its garrison in this period was to establish the authority of the Margraves over the unruly citizens of Berlin, who were reluctant to give up their medieval privileges to a monarchy. In 1415 King [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]] had enfeoffed the Hohenzollern princes with Brandenburg, and they were now establishing their power and withdrawing electoral privileges which the cities had attained in the Brandenburg interregnum of 1319–1415.

The castle also included a chapel.&lt;!-- *Obviously* it was Catholic -- before the Reformation! --&gt; In 1454 Frederick II, after having returned via [[Rome]] from his pilgrimage to [[Jerusalem]], made the castle chapel a parish church, richly endowing it with relics and altars.&lt;ref&gt;Ingo Materna and Wolfgang Ribbe, ''Geschichte in Daten – Brandenburg'', Munich and Berlin: Koehler &amp; Amelang, 1995, p. 68. {{ISBN|3-7338-0188-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Nicholas V]] ordered [[Stephan Bodecker]], then Prince-[[Bishop of Brandenburg]], to consecrate the Chapel to [[Erasmus of Formiae]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Gottschalk, ''Altberliner Kirchen in historischen Ansichten'', Würzburg: Weidlich, 1985, p. 171. {{ISBN|3-8035-1262-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 April 1465, at Frederick's request, [[Pope Paul II]] attributed to ''St Erasmus Chapel'' a [[canon law|canon-law]] [[College (canon law)|College]] named ''Stift zu Ehren Unserer Lieben Frauen, des heiligen Kreuzes, St. Petri und Pauli, St. Erasmi und St. Nicolai''. This [[collegiate church]] became the nucleus of today's [[Prussian Union (Evangelical Christian Church)|Evangelical]] [[Berlin Cathedral|Supreme Parish and Collegiate Church]], adjoining the site of the castle.

In 1538, the Margrave [[Joachim II, Elector of Brandenburg|Joachim II]] demolished the palace and engaged the master builder [[Caspar Theiss]] to build a new and grander building in the [[Italian Renaissance]] style. After the [[Thirty Years War]] (1618–1648), [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William]] (1620–1688), the "Great Elector", embellished the palace further. In 1688, [[Nicodemus Tessin the Younger|Nicodemus Tessin]] designed courtyard arcades with massive columns in front. Not much is known about the alterations of 1690–1695, when [[Johann Nering]] was the court architect. [[Martin Grünberg]] continued the alterations in 1695–1699.

In 1699 the [[Frederick I of Prussia|Elector Frederick III of Brandenburg]] (who took the title [[King in Prussia]] in 1701, becoming Frederick I), appointed the architect [[Andreas Schlüter]] to execute a "second plan" in the Italian manner. Schlüter's first design probably dates from 1702; he planned to rebuild the palace in the Protestant [[Baroque]] style. His overall concept in the shape of a regular cube enclosing a magnificently ornamented courtyard was retained by all the building directors who succeeded him. In 1706, Schlüter was replaced by [[Johann Friedrich Eosander von Göthe]], who designed the western extension of the palace, doubling its size. In all essentials, Schlüter's balanced, rhythmic composition of the façades was retained, but Göthe moved the main entrance to the new west wing.

[[Frederick William I of Prussia|Frederick William I]], who became king in 1713, was interested mainly in building up Prussia as a military power, and dismissed most of the craftsmen working on the Stadtschloss. As a result, Göthe's plan was only partly carried out. Nevertheless, the exterior of the palace had come close to its final form by the mid-18th century. The final stage was the erection of the dome in 1845, during the reign of [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|Frederick William IV]]. The dome was built by [[Friedrich August Stüler]] after a design by [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]]. Subsequent major works were limited to the interior, engaging the talents of [[Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff]], [[Carl von Gontard]] and many others.

The Stadtschloss was at the centre of the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] in Prussia. Huge crowds gathered outside the palace to present an "address to the king" containing their demands for a constitution, liberal reform and German unification. [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|Frederick William]] emerged from the palace to accept their demands. On 18 March, a large demonstration outside the Stadtschloss led to bloodshed and the outbreak of street fighting. Frederick William later reneged on his promises and reimposed an autocratic regime. From that time onwards, many Berliners and other Germans came to see the Stadtschloss as a symbol of oppression and "Prussian militarism".

==Later history==
[[Image:Hochschule für Musik.JPG|thumb|left|[[Karl Liebknecht]] proclaims the German Free Socialist Republic at the Berliner Stadtschloss, 9 November 1918 (Mural, Hochschule für Musik, Berlin)]]

In 1871, King [[William I, German Emperor|William I]] was elevated to the status of Emperor (''Kaiser'') of a united Germany, and the Stadtschloss became the symbolic centre of the German Empire. The Empire was, however, at least in theory a constitutional state, and from 1894 the new [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag]] building, the seat of the German parliament, came to rival and overshadow the Stadtschloss as the centre of power. In conjunction with Germany's defeat in [[World War I]], [[William II, German Emperor|William II]] was forced to abdicate both as German Emperor and as King of Prussia. In November 1918, the [[Spartacus League|Spartacist]] leader, [[Karl Liebknecht]], declared the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919|German Socialist Republic]] from a balcony of the Stadtschloss, ending more than 400 years of royal occupation of the building.

During the [[Weimar Republic]], parts of the Stadtschloss were turned into a museum, while other parts continued to be used for receptions and other state functions. Under [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Party|National Socialist (Nazi) Party]], which laid to rest monarchist hopes of a [[Hohenzollern dynasty|Hohenzollern]] restoration, the building was mostly ignored. During [[World War II]], the Stadtschloss was twice [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|struck by Allied bombs]]: on 3 February and 24 February 1945. On the latter occasion, when the air defence and fire-fighting systems of Berlin had been destroyed, the building was struck by incendiaries, lost its roof and was largely burnt out.

The end of the war saw the Stadtschloss a burned-out shell of its former glory, although the building had remained structurally sound and much of its interior decoration was still preserved. It could have been restored, as many other bombed-out buildings in central Berlin later were. However, the area in which it was located was within the [[Soviet Union]] zone, which became the [[German Democratic Republic]]. The building was used for a Soviet war movie ("the Battle of Berlin") in which the Stadtschloss served as a backdrop, with live artillery shells fired at it for the realistic cinematic impact.&lt;ref&gt;Renate Petras, ''Das Schloss in Berlin: Von der Revolution 1918 bis zur Vernichtung 1950'', Berlin: Verlag Bauwesen, 1999, p. 110. {{ISBN|3-345-00690-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Image:Palast der Republik und Fernsehturm.jpg|thumb|left|The site of the City Palace in 2007, with the [[Palast der Republik]] being demolished.]]
The new socialist government declared the Stadtschloss a symbol of Prussian militarism, although at that time there appeared to be no plans to destroy the building. Some parts of it were in fact repaired and used from 1945 to 1950 as an exhibition space. A secret 1950 GDR Ministry of Construction report, only rediscovered in 2016, calculated that reconstruction of the damaged Palace could be achieved for 32 million GDR marks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bz-berlin.de/berlin/mitte/geheimes-gutachten-krimi-um-die-sprengung-des-berliner-schlosses|title=Geheimes Gutachten: Krimi um die Sprengung des Berliner Schlosses|website=Bz-berlin.de|access-date=2016-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in July 1950 [[Walter Ulbricht]], the new General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, announced the demolition of the palace. Despite objections, its removal commenced in September 1950, the process taking four months and consuming 19 tons of dynamite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bild.de/regional/berlin/ddr/haette-stadtschloss-fuer-32-mio-mark-retten-koennen-47141318.bild.html|title=Jetzt aufgetauchtes Gutachten belegt {{!}} DDR hätte Stadtschloss für 32 Millionen Mark retten können|website=Bild.de|access-date=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; So solid was its construction that the dome and its entire mount remained intact even after it is fell to the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Photo: Köhler, Gustav; 15 October 1950; Bundesarchiv, Bild 183-08 103-0025&lt;/ref&gt; Only one section was preserved, a portal from the balcony of which [[Karl Liebknecht]] had declared the German Socialist Republic. It was later added to the Council of State building ([[Staatsratsgebäude]]), with an altered cartouche, where it forms the main entrance. The empty space where the Stadtschloss had stood was named Marx-Engels-Platz and used as a parade ground.

[[Image:State Council building 017.JPG|thumb|right|Liebknecht's balcony in the Council of State [[Staatsratsgebäude]] building (today's [[European School of Management and Technology|ESMT European School of Management and Technology]])]]

In 1964, the GDR built a new [[State Council of the German Democratic Republic|Staatsrat]] or [[Council of State]] building on part of the site, incorporating Liebknecht's balcony in its facade. From 1973 to 1976, during the government of [[Erich Honecker]], a large modernist building was built, the [[Palast der Republik]] (Palace of the Republic), which occupied most of the site of the former Stadtschloss. Shortly before [[German reunification]] in October 1990, the Palast der Republik was found to be contaminated with [[asbestos]] and was closed to the public. After reunification, the Berlin city government ordered the removal of the asbestos, a process which was completed by 2003. In November 2003, the German federal government decided to demolish the building and leave the area as parkland pending a decision as to its ultimate future. Demolition started in February 2006 and was completed in 2009. East Germans resented the demolition, especially those for whom the Palace of the Republic had been a place of fond memories, or who felt a sense a dislocation in a post-communist world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Architectural Conservation in Europe and the Americas|last1=Stubbs|first1=John H.|last2=Makaš|first2=Emily G.|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2008 until the commencement of construction in 2013, the large area of original Schlossplatz became a grassed field, laid out on minimal lines with wooden platforms. At the same time, the Berlin Monument Authority (Landesdenkmalamt) undertook extensive archaeological excavations. Parts of cellars that had been situated in the south-west corner of former Palace were discovered; at it was decided these would be preserved and made accessible to visitors as an "archaeological window".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Berlin Palace Becomes The Humboldt Forum|last=Rettig|first=Manfred|publisher=Humboldt Forum Foundation|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reconstruction ==

===The debate===
Following reunification a 20-year-long debate commenced as to whether the palace should be reconstructed, and whether this should be in part or whole. Pro-reconstruction lobby groups argued that the rebuilding of the Stadtschloss would restore the unity and integrity of the historical centre of Berlin, which includes the [[Berliner Dom]], the [[Lustgarten]] and the museums of [[Museum Island]].  Opponents of the project included those who advocated the retention of the [[Palast der Republik]] on the grounds that it was itself of historical significance; those who argued that the area should become a public park; and those who believed that a new building would be a [[pastiche]] of former architectural styles; would be an unwelcome symbol of Germany's imperial past; and would be unacceptably expensive for no definite economic benefit. They also argued that it would be impossible to accurately reconstruct the exterior or interiors of the building, since neither detailed plans nor the necessary craft skills are available. Others disputed this, claiming that sufficient photographic documentation of both existed when it was converted to a museum following 1918.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The ideological divide was symbolised by two groups. The Association for the Preservation of the Palace of the Republic (''Verein zur Erhaltung des Palastes der Republik'') championed a renovation of the GDR building that would incorporate a re-creation of the principal western facade the City Place, for a multipurpose people's centre similar to the [[Centre Georges Pompidou|Centre Pompidou]] in Paris. The Berlin City Palace Sponsoring Association (''Förderverein Berliner Stadtschloß'') argued for complete external reconstruction of the City Palace, considering it the only option that would restore the aesthetic and historic ensemble at Berlin's heart.&lt;ref name="reconstruction2003"&gt;Goebe,Rolf J. ''Berlin's Architectural Citations: Reconstruction, Simulation, and the Problem of Historical Authenticity'', PMLA, Modern Language Association of America, 2003''&lt;/ref&gt; It also rejected suggestions that the proposed meticulous reconstruction would be an unauthentic 'Disney' replica, drawing attention to the fact that most centuries-old stone buildings are, by dint of aging and repair, at least partial reconstructions; and that the argument that the present time can only represent itself in its own architectural language, is simply ideology. It also drew attention to the [[Venice Charter]] observation that "historic edifices have a material age and an immaterial significance" – an importance that transcends time, and justifies their reconstruction to preserve a vital part of urban identity and historical memory, provided that sufficient documentation for a truly authentic copy exists.&lt;ref name="reconstruction2003"/&gt;

===Towards construction===

The driving force in ultimately achieving reconstruction of the Stadtschloss were businessman and aristocrat [[:de:Wilhelm von Boddien|Wilhelm von Boddien]]. Until von Boddien and his associates became involved, the Government had given no thought to rebuilding the entire palace.&lt;ref name="whitney1993"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/12/arts/a-berlin-palace-stirs-in-its-grave.html|title=A Berlin Palace Stirs in Its Grave|last=Whitney|first=Craig R.|date=1993-07-12|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992 von Boddien co-founded with [[Kathleen King von Alvensleben]],&lt;ref&gt;Amid Squabbling, Berlin to Reveal Imperial Palace Design, DW, 27 November 2008[https://www.dw.com/en/amid-squabbling-berlin-to-reveal-imperial-palace-design/a-3823687]&lt;/ref&gt; (an American architect who had married into a German noble family), what evolved to be the Berlin City Palace Sponsoring Association – which became the most influential lobby group. The Association accumulated plans that had been believed lost, and funded a research project at the Technical University of Berlin to measure surviving photos and drawings of the Palace to create precise architectural plans. In 1993, on the world's largest scaffolding assembly, it audaciously erected a ''[[Trompe-l'œil|trompe-l'oeil]]'' mockup of two frontages of the Stadtschloss facade on a 1:1 scale on plastic sheeting. Privately funded by donations and sponsorship this ''[[wikt:coup de théâtre|coup de théâtre]]'' stood for a year and half. Showing a vision of central Berlin lost for fifty years, and how the palace could provide the missing link to the historical ensemble of the [[Zeughaus]], the [[Altes Museum]], and the [[Berlin Cathedral]], the spectacle brought the debate to a temporary climax in 1993/4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/berlins-city-palace-controversy-refuses-to-die/a-3924736 |title=Berlin's City Palace Controversy Refuses to Die|last=|first=|date=|website=Dw.com|access-date=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whitney1993"/&gt; While opinion continued to remain divided, it succeeded in winning over many politicians and other key figures for the endeavour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Oswalt|first=Philipp|date=1 February 2008|title=Das Stadtschloss-Geschäft|trans-title=The Berlin Palace Business|url=http://www.bauwelt.de/themen/betrifft/bw_2008-01_Das_Stadtschloss-Geschaeft-2098188.html|work=Bauwelt|access-date=2017-06-07|pages=7–8|lang=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Humboldt-Forum-20170711.jpg|thumb|right|Construction work, July 2017]]

In view of the previous opposition, including high cost, and most importantly, the psychological and political objections, successive German governments had declined to commit themselves to the project. However, by 2002 and 2003 cross-party resolutions of the [[Bundestag]] reached a compromise to support at least a partial rebuilding of the Stadtschloss. In 2007, the [[Bundestag]] (German parliament) made a definitive decision about the reconstruction. According to this compromise, which had been drawn up by a commission, three façades of the palace would be rebuilt, but the interior would be a modern structure to serve as a cultural museum and forum. An architectural competition was held, and in 2008 the jury chose the submission by Italian architect [[Franco Stella]].&lt;ref&gt;Werning, Remei Capdevila ''From Berliner Stadtschloss to Humboldt-Box and Back Again: Architecture in the Conditional'', Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the internal spaces in Stella's design follow the exact proportions of the original state rooms of the palace, so as to facilitate their reconstruction at a later date should this be desired. The reconstruction also reproduces the original metre-thick width of the outer walls. However these have been rebuilt as a sandwiched construction: an inner retaining wall of concrete, followed by a layer of insulation, and an outer wall of brick, sandstone and stucco which replicates the original. Reconstruction of the Renaissance-gabled Pharmacy Wing, which connected to the Stadtschloss on the north side, would be another possible future project.

[[File:Berliner Schloss Panorama.jpg|thumb|right|Panorama of how the finished reconstruction will look.]]
Due to German government budget cuts, construction of the "Humboldtforum", as the new palace was titled, was delayed. The [[foundation stone]] was finally laid by President [[Joachim Gauck]] in a ceremony on 12 June 2013 signalling the launch of a €590M (£500M) reconstruction project.&lt;ref name="12 Jun 2013"&gt;{{cite web |url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/10117103/Berlin-begins-reconstruction-of-King-Frederick-the-Greats-palace.html|title =Berlin begins reconstruction of King Frederick the Great's palace | author= Harriet Alexander|date =12 Jun 2013|work  = |publisher =The Telegraph |accessdate =14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On completion in 2019 the building will house a modern museum containing collections of African and other non-European art, as well as two restaurants, a theater, a movie theater and an auditorium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-12/berlin-palace-rebuilding-begins-63-years-after-explosion.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141207211822/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-12/berlin-palace-rebuilding-begins-63-years-after-explosion.html |archivedate=2014-12-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Donations continue to be sought for the baroque facade decoration by Förderverein Berliner Schloss eV, which is funding this part of the reconstruction. In a congratulatory letter to Wilhelm von Boddien on his 75th birthday, the chairman of the board of the board of the Foundation Humboldt Forum wrote: "Without you, the castle would not exist."&lt;ref&gt;""Berliner Schlossherr" Wilhelm von Boddien wird 75", "Die Welt", 26 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, a Berlin newspaper conceded: "Boddien comes from one of the longest and most annoying debates of the last 20 years, whether this Berlin needs a castle or not, as a grinning, even brilliant winner.&lt;ref&gt;Messmer, Susanne "Fast Fertig", Taz, 25 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3531">The '''''Bibliothèque universelle''''' was an [[academic journal]] published by a group of Genevan scholars first centred on [[Marc-Auguste Pictet]] (1752–1825), later around [[Auguste Arthur de la Rive]] (1801–1873) and other scholars. It enjoyed a wide audience in the various French-speaking countries of Europe during the 19th century.

The initial form of the journal was the ''[[Bibliothèque Britannique]]'', which began publication in 1796, and focused on British science, techniques, literature and agriculture. Its founders and editors were Marc-Auguste Pictet ("Sciences &amp; Arts"), [[Charles Pictet de Rochemont]] ("Literature") and Frédéric-Guillaume Maurice ("Agriculture").&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionnaire historique suisse'', notice ''Bibliothèque universelle'', par Doris Jakubec, 30 septembre 2004 [http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/f/F24583.php]&lt;/ref&gt; This journal was succeeded in 1816 by the ''Bibliothèque universelle des sciences, belles-lettres, et arts'', which kept the same editors until 1824–25 and was also published in three series, one focusing on science and techniques, another on literature and a third one on agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Bickerton, Marc-Auguste and Charles Pictet, the "Bibliothèque britannique" (1796–1815) and the dissemination of British literature and science on the Continent, Genève, Slatkine, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Pictet's death (1825), the periodical was taken over by Georges Maurice (1799–1839) and Pictet de Rochemont's two sons, soon joined by a group of Genevan scholars including [[Etienne Dumont]], [[Pellegrino Rossi]], [[Jacob Frederic Lullin de Châteauvieux]], as well as [[Augustin Pyramus de Candolle]] and Auguste De la Rive for the scientific part.

In 1836, the two main series, science and literature, were merged for a period of ten years under the leadership of Auguste De la Rive and given the name of ''Bibliothèque universelle de Genève''. In 1846, the periodical was divided again between a series on literature, which kept the name of "Bibliothèque Universelle" and a series on science, which took the name of "Archives des Sciences Physiques et Naturelles".

The "Bibliothèque Universelle" went through many changes, which did not prevent its encyclopedic formula to become gradually obsolete. It disappeared in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Maggetti, Yves Bridel, Roger Francillon, La Bibliothèque universelle, 1815-1924: miroir de la sensibilité romande au XIXe siècle, Lausanne, Payot, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Archives des Sciences Physiques et Naturelles" were edited until the first World War by Genevan men of science such as Auguste De la Rive, [[François-Jules Pictet-De la Rive]] (1809–1872), [[Casimir Pyrame de Candolle]] (1836–1918) and [[Edouard Sarasin]] (1843–1917). Renamed "Archives des Sciences" in 1947, this periodical maintained its three issues a year until 2004. It still exists today as a local and non-specialized periodical of natural history and history of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/bibliothqueuniv22unkngoog|work=Internet Archive|title=Bibliothèque universelle des sciences, belles-lettres, et arts (1816)|accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bollocks to Alton Towers: Uncommonly British Days Out''''' ({{ISBN|0-14-102120-9}}) is a humorous [[Guide book|travel book]] written by Robin Halstead, Jason Hazeley, Alex Morris, and [[Joel Morris]] (the creators of ''[[The Framley Examiner]]''), which showcases unusual attractions, left-field [[museums]] and one-off days out in the United Kingdom.

The introduction describes the book as "a collection of the underdogs of British tourism... [that] say more about Britain and the British than any number of corkscrew thrill rides or high-tech Interactive Visitor Experiences."

According to the book's information, the authors, on average, "were born on 2 November 1971 and live on [[Blackfriars Bridge]] in [[London]] with their three-quarters of a partner and half a child each."

The book was published in hardback by Michael Joseph Ltd (an imprint of the [[Penguin Group]]) in 2005. It was also published in paperback by [[Penguin Books]] in 2006.

A sequel, titled ''Far From the Sodding Crowd'', was published in hardback in 2007. A paperback edition, ''More Bollocks to Alton Towers'', ({{ISBN|0-14-102785-1}}) was published in April 2008.

A short documentary, ''Far From the Sodding Crowd'', was made in 2009 and features some of the attractions included in both books, as well as writers Jason Hazeley and Joel Morris.

==Trivia==

The final testimonial quote on the back of the paperback edition (published in March 2006) is:
'A very, very witty, charming book' - Russell Barnes, General Manager, Alton Towers

Some copies display the first word of the title as ''B**locks'' on the cover (front, back and spine). However the word remains uncensored inside.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22889">In [[investment]], the '''bond credit rating''' represents the [[credit worthiness]] of corporate or government [[bond (finance)|bonds]].  It is not the same as individual's [[credit score]]. The ratings are published by [[Credit rating agency|credit rating agencies]] and used by investment professionals to assess the likelihood the debt will be repaid.

==Credit rating agencies==
Credit rating is a highly concentrated industry with the two largest [[credit rating agencies|rating agencies]] — [[Moody's Investors Service]] and [[Standard &amp; Poor's#Credit ratings|Standard &amp; Poor's]] — having roughly 80% market share globally, and the [[Big Three (credit rating agencies)|"Big Three" credit rating agencies]] — Moody's, S&amp;P and [[Fitch Group|Fitch Ratings]] — controlling approximately 95% of the ratings business.&lt;ref name="controversy"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfr.org/united-states/credit-rating-controversy/p22328|title=The Credit Rating Controversy.

[[Credit rating agency|Credit rating agencies]] registered as such with the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] are "[[nationally recognized statistical rating organization]]s". The following firms are [[Nationally recognized statistical rating organization#List of NRSROs|currently registered as NRSROs]]: [[A.M.

Under the [[Credit Rating Agency Reform Act]], an NRSRO may be registered with respect to up to five classes of credit ratings: (1) financial institutions, brokers, or dealers; (2) insurance companies; (3) corporate issuers; (4) issuers of asset-backed securities; and (5) issuers of government securities, municipal securities, or securities issued by a foreign government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/answers/nrsro.htm |title=Rating Agencies - NRSROs |publisher=Sec.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Credit rating tiers==
The credit rating is a financial indicator to potential investors of [[debt]] [[Security (finance)|securities]] such as [[Bond (finance)|bonds]]. These are assigned by [[credit rating agencies]] such as Moody's, Standard &amp; Poor's and Fitch Ratings to have letter designations (such as AAA, B, CC) which represent the quality of a bond.  Moody's assigns bond credit ratings of [[Moody's AAA Bond|Aaa]], Aa, A, Baa, Ba, B, Caa, Ca, C, with WR and NR as withdrawn and not rated.&lt;ref name="MRSD"&gt;{{cite web |title=Moody's Rating Symbols &amp; Definitions |page=5 |url=http://v3.moodys.com/sites/products/AboutMoodysRatingsAttachments/MoodysRatingsSymbolsand%20Definitions.pdf |format=PDF |quote=Withdrawn - WR ...

===Investment grade===
A [[Bond (finance)|bond]] is considered '''investment grade''' or '''IG''' if its credit rating is BBB- or higher by [[Standard &amp; Poor's]] or Baa3 or higher by [[Moody's]]. Generally they are bonds that are judged by the rating agency as likely enough to meet payment obligations that banks are allowed to invest in them.

Ratings play a critical role in determining how much companies and other entities that issue debt, including sovereign governments, have to pay to access credit markets, i.e., the amount of interest they pay on their issued debt. The threshold between investment-grade and speculative-grade ratings has important market implications for issuers' borrowing costs. 

Bonds that are not rated as investment-grade bonds are known as '''high yield''' bonds or more derisively as [[junk bonds]].

The risks associated with investment-grade bonds (or investment-grade [[corporate debt]]) are considered significantly higher than those associated with first-class government bonds. The difference between rates for first-class government bonds and investment-grade bonds is called investment-grade spread. The range of this spread is an indicator of the market's belief in the stability of the economy. The higher these investment-grade spreads (or [[risk premium]]s) are, the weaker the economy is considered.

==Criticism==
Until the early 1970s, bond credit ratings agencies were paid for their work by investors who wanted impartial information on the credit worthiness of securities issuers and their particular offerings.  Starting in the early 1970s, the "Big Three" ratings agencies (S&amp;P, Moody's, and Fitch) began to receive payment for their work by the securities issuers for whom they issue those ratings, which has led to charges that these ratings agencies can no longer always be impartial when issuing ratings for those securities issuers.  Securities issuers have been accused of "shopping" for the best ratings from these three ratings agencies, in order to attract investors, until at least one of the agencies delivers favorable ratings.  This arrangement has been cited as one of the primary causes of the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] (which began in 2007), when some securities, particularly [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]] (MBSs) and [[collateralized debt obligation]]s (CDOs) rated highly by the credit ratings agencies, and thus heavily invested in by many organizations and individuals, were rapidly and vastly devalued due to defaults, and fear of defaults, on some of the individual components of those securities, such as home loans and credit card accounts. Other countries are beginning to mull the creation of domestic credit ratings agencies to challenge the dominance of the "Big Three", for example in Russia, where the ACRA was founded in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2750321 Contextualizing Russia's Ratings Agency: ACRA]. ''Emerging Market Fiscal Oversight and Governance Mechanisms.'' Social Science Research Network. Accessed 27 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Municipal bonds==
[[Municipal bond]]s are instruments issued by local, state, or federal governments in the [[United States]]. Until April-May 2010 Moody's and Fitch were rating municipal bonds on the separate naming/classification system which mirrored the tiers for corporate bonds. S&amp;P abolished dual rating system in 2000.

==Default rates==
The historical default rate for municipal bonds is lower than that of corporate bonds.  The Municipal Bond Fairness Act (HR 6308),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_reports&amp;docid=f:hr835.110 |title=House Report 110-835 - MUNICIPAL BOND FAIRNESS ACT |publisher=Frwebgate.access.gpo.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced September 9, 2008, included the following table giving historical bond default rates for municipal versus corporate bonds by rating and rating agency.

A potential misuse of historic default statistics is to
assume that historical average default rates represent the "[[probability of default]]" of debt in a particular rating category. However, [...] default rates can vary significantly from one year to the next and
the observed rate for any given year can vary significantly from the average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Understanding Standard &amp; Poor's Rating Definitions |url=http://www.standardandpoors.com/servlet/BlobServer?blobheadername3=MDT-Type&amp;blobcol=urldata&amp;blobtable=MungoBlobs&amp;blobheadervalue2=inline%3B+filename%3Dunderstanding_ratings_definitions.pdf&amp;blobheadername2=Content-Disposition&amp;blobheadervalue1=application%2Fpdf&amp;blobkey=id&amp;blobheadername1=content-type&amp;blobwhere=1243834063620&amp;blobheadervalue3=UTF-8 |publisher=standardandpoors.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Cantares Mexicanos''''' is the name given to a manuscript collection of [[Nahuatl]] songs or poems recorded in the 16th century. The 91 songs of the ''Cantares'' form the largest Nahuatl song collection, containing over half of all known traditional Nahuatl songs. It is currently located in the [[National Library of Mexico]] in [[Mexico City]]. A description is found in the census of prose manuscripts in the native tradition in the ''Handbook of Middle American Indians''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Gibson (historian)|Gibson, Charles]] and John B. Glass. "Prose sources in the Native Historical Tradition", article 27B. "A Census of Middle American Prose Manuscripts in the Native Historical Tradition". ''Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources'' Part 4; ''Handbook of Middle American Indians''. University of Texas Press 1975, census #1019 p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Spanish edition and translation of much of the manuscript was given by the great Mexican scholar, [[Ángel María Garibay]] Kintana, in the second and third volumes of his ''Poesía náhuatl'' (1965, 1968). It was not until [[Miguel León-Portilla]] edited a two-volume Spanish translation of the codex, published by the Universidad Nacional Autonóma de México, that entire ''Cantares'' was rendered in Spanish. 

A complete paleographic transcription and English translation of the ''Cantares'' was published in 1985 by [[John Bierhorst]] as ''Cantares Mexicanos: Songs of the Aztecs'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|0-8047-1182-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a dictionary and [[concordance (publishing)|concordance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|0-8047-1183-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Bierhorst's transcription was appreciated by scholars for its accuracy and faithfulness to the original manuscript, his translations were criticized as misleading and colored by his view that the ''Cantares'' are "ghost songs", part of a colonial [[revitalization movement]] parallel to the [[ghost dance]]s of the [[Plains Indians]].&lt;ref&gt;Dakin (1986): pp. 1014–1016; Karttunen (1987): pp. 442–443; León-Portilla (1992): pp. 41–44; Lockhart (1991): pp. 141–157.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Bowles (author)|David Bowles]], in his translations of selected poems from the ''Cantares'' and other Mesoamerican codices, agrees with León-Portilla and Garibay that the songs are part of a long aesthetic and philosophical tradition predating the Conquest.&lt;ref&gt;Bowles (2013): pp. i-v.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cook and Enjoy It''' is the [[English language|English]] version of the original [[Afrikaans]] cookbook, ''Kook en Geniet'', which became known as the definitive cookbook representing authentic South African food culture and heritage. ''Kook en Geniet'' was originally published by S.J.A. de Villiers in 1951 in her private capacity after South African publishers expressed disinterest.

''Cook and Enjoy It'' was published by the Central News Agency in 1961, and from 1972 onwards by [[Human &amp; Rousseau]] when the Central News Agency withdrew from publishing.

In 1990 Human &amp; Rousseau obtained the rights to the production and marketing of the Afrikaans edition, resulting in a completely revised edition in 1992 with a new appearance for both the Afrikaans and English versions. The new edition attempted to retain the character of the original book's more than 700 recipes and basic cooking principles, having incorporated the use of modern kitchen appliances such as microwaves and food processors in many recipes.

For the revised 1992 edition, some recipes were newly-tested and rewritten in what was perceived to be an easy-to-follow style. Although a few recipes were edited and replaced, the intention was to retain the spirit and essence of [[Ina de Villiers]]'s great South African classic.

In 2009 Human &amp; Rousseau published a new, updated and revised edition of the book. Eunice van der Berg, a daughter of the author, was in charge of the whole process of revitalizing the book. This edition returned to a format more in line with the original edition, but also incorporated a modern approach and feel. Amongst the changes was a truncated title for the English edition: ''Cook and Enjoy''.

S.J.A de Villiers died on 20 September 2010, at the age of 91.

In 2005 it was estimated that over half a million Afrikaans copies had been sold. At the time of the author's death, sales in both languages far exceeded a million copies, making it the most successful South African cookbook ever.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10356">'''Drekavac''' ([[Serbian Cyrillic|Cyrillic]]: дрекавац, {{IPA-sh|drɛkaʋats}}, literally ''"the screamer"'' or ''"the yeller"''&lt;ref name = "Levi"&gt;Levi, Pavle (2007.) ''Disintegration in frames: aesthetics and ideology in the Yugoslav and post-Yugoslav cinema'' Stanford University Press, Stanford, California, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-Sdi63FxE7EC&amp;pg=PA181 page 181], {{ISBN|978-0-8047-5368-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;), also called  '''drekalo''', '''krekavac''', '''zdrekavac''' or  '''zrikavac''', is a mythical creature in [[South Slavs|South]] [[Slavic mythology]]. The name is derived from the adjective "''drečati"'' ([[Serbian Cyrillic|Cyrillic]]: дречати) as meaning ''yelling''.

== Description ==
In South Slavic mythology it is described as furry humanoid forest demon bearing long claws on the front limbs.

In later folk tales this creature has been variously described:
* In some folk tales it has been depicted in the form of an undead man that came out of the grave during night time and haunt people.&lt;ref name = SMR/&gt;
* Also in some folk tales it has been depicted in the form of an undead unbaptised child that rose out from its grave during night time to haunt its parents. Also this creature is known for calling out to people passing near cemeteries to baptise it.&lt;ref name = SMR/&gt;
* In [[Southern and Eastern Serbia|Eastern Serbia]] it has been depicted in the form of a humanoid canine creature that walks on its back legs.
* In the vicinity of [[Maglaj]] it has been depicted in the form of ghosts of soldiers that wander around during night time, scaring people.&lt;ref name = SMR/&gt;
* In the vicinity of [[Kozarska Dubica]] it has been depicted as a vampire-like undead man that rises out of the grave during night time, and wanders around scaring people.&lt;ref name = SMR/&gt;
* In the vicinity of [[Arilje]] it has been depicted in form of a long-necked long-legged creature with a cat-like head.&lt;ref name = SMR/&gt;
* In [[Sredačka župa]] it has been depicted in the form of a one-legged humanoid creature with glowing eyes that wanders around during night time and scares people.&lt;ref name = SMR/&gt;
* In the vicinity of [[Prijepolje]], [[Lešak]] and Dragačevo it has been depicted as an apparition that can be seen in form of a dappled foal, dog, cat, or bird.&lt;ref name = SMR/&gt;
* In the vicinity of [[Gruža (Knić)|Gruža]] it has been depicted in the form of a creature having a dappled, elongated and [[spindle (textiles)|spindle]]-thin body with a disproportionately large head. This creature can fly and it is believed to be the soul of a dead child.&lt;ref name = SMR/&gt;  

A modern description of a supposed drekavac describes it as a canine creature similar to a [[dog]]&lt;ref name= Svetlost&gt;{{cite news |title = Gimnastika na poledici |url = http://www.svetlost.co.yu/arhiva/99/216/216-2.htm |year = 1999 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080409215503/http://www.svetlost.co.yu/arhiva/99/216/216-2.htm |archivedate = 2008-04-09 |newspaper = Nezavisna Svetlost #216}}&lt;/ref&gt; or some kind of bird.&lt;ref name = Glas&gt;{{cite news |title = I drekavac sumnjiv |author = Z. Šaponjić |work = [[Glas Javnosti]] |date = 2003-10-20 |url = http://arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs/arhiva/2003/10/20/srpski/R03101902.shtml |accessdate = 2006-09-22 |language = Serbo-Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Original beliefs ==
The drekavac was originally thought to have come from the [[soul]]s of sinful men, or from children who died [[baptism|unbaptised]].&lt;ref name = SMR&gt;{{cite book |author = Š. Kulišić |author2 = P. Ž. Petrović |author3 = N. Pantelić |title = Српски митолошки речник |year = 1970 |publisher = Nolit |location = Belgrade |language = Serbo-Croatian |pages = 110 |chapter = Дрекавац}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was popularly believed to be visible only at night, especially during the [[twelve days of Christmas]] (called ''unbaptised days'' in [[Serbo-Croatian]]) and in early [[Spring (season)|spring]], when other demons and mythical creatures were believed to be more active.&lt;ref name = SMR/&gt; When assuming the form of a child, it predicts someone's [[death]], while in its animal form, it predicts cattle disease.&lt;ref name = SMR/&gt; The drekavac is believed to avoid dogs and bright light.&lt;ref name = SMR/&gt; Also, it is believed that if the shadow of drekavac falls upon some person then that person will turn sick and die.&lt;ref name = SMR/&gt;

== Modern sightings ==
Though the creature is used in precautionary tales for children, there are adults who still believe in its existence. According to the guide of a reporter of ''Duga'' magazine, numerous villagers on the mountain of [[Zlatibor]] report seeing it, and many inhabitants claim to have heard it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Ljudi i vreme |url = http://www.vreme.com/arhiva_html/525/17.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some modern sightings happened:
* In 1992, it was reported that in the [[Krvavica]], the villagers found remains of an animal unlike any known from the area, and claimed it was a drekavac. It was described as looking like a dog, but with a "snake-like" head and hind legs "similar" to those of a [[kangaroo]].&lt;ref name = Svetlost/&gt; Later, it was revealed to be just a rotten carcass of a fox;
* In 2003, in the village of [[Tometino Polje]] near [[Divcibare]], a series of attacks on [[sheep]] occurred, with some villagers concluding that they had been perpetrated by a drekavac. Other villagers disagreed, seeing as the attacks took place in the daytime, as opposed to night, when the drekavac is supposedly more active.&lt;ref name = Glas/&gt;

== Appearances and references in fiction ==
=== In literature ===
* Drekavac is mentioned in a short story by [[Branko Ćopić]], ''"Brave Mita and drekavac from the pond"'' ([[Serbian Cyrillic|Cyrillic]]: ''"Храбри Мита и дрекавац из рита"'') in which a group of [[superstition|superstitious]] [[fishermen]] stop fishing because they hear mysterious yells in the pond, where they were usually fishing, and start believing that they hear a drekavac, which leads to hunger in the village. The [[protagonist]] of the story, a courageous village boy named Mita, investigates this mystery and captures the "drekavac", which turns out to be a [[great bittern]], a bird very rare for the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Ćopić |first = Branko |authorlink = Branko Copic |title = U svijetu medvjeda i leptirova |chapter = Hrabri Mita i drekavac iz rita |url = http://www.lektirabih.com.ba/101/102/copasml.htm |chapterurl = http://www.lektirabih.com.ba/101/102/102bcsml.htm#_Toc158393743 |accessdate = 2007-05-01 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070128104013/http://www.lektirabih.com.ba/101/102/copasml.htm |archivedate = 2007-01-28 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In video games and roleplaying games ===
Drekavac is rarely depicted in [[video game|video]] and [[roleplaying game|roleplaying]] games.
* In the ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'' has a card of drekavac from the [[Dissension (Magic: The Gathering)|Dissension set]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = ''Dissension'' Sortable Spoiler |url = http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=magic/cardlist/dissension |accessdate = 2007-05-01 |publisher = [[Wizards of the Coast]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Serbian [[trading card game]] ''"Izvori Magije"'' has numerous cards of drekavac type creatures, one of them named ''Drekavac iz vira'' (meaning "Drekavac from  the whirlpool"). This creature is described as: ''Big-headed and with long thin necks, drekavac often jump out of whirpools to attack people who are returning home from watermills.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://izvorimagije.com/izvoriste/kartaned.php?tm=1176987639 |title = Drekavac iz vira |accessdate = 2007-05-01 |publisher = Izvorimagije.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward Arber''' (4 December 1836 – 23 November 1912&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who 1914''&lt;/ref&gt;) was an [[England|English]] scholar, writer, and editor. 

[[File:Mason Science College.png|thumb|right|[[Mason Science College|Mason College, now Birmingham University]]]]

==Background and professional work==
Arber was born in [[London]]. From 1854 he 1878 he worked as a clerk in the [[Admiralty]], and began evening classes at [[King's College London]] in 1858. From 1878 to 1881 he studied English literature, under H. Morley, at [[University College London]]; and from 1881 to 1894 he was professor of English at [[Mason College]] (which later became [[Birmingham University]]). From 1894 he lived in London as emeritus professor, being also a fellow of [[King's College London]]. In 1905 he received the honorary degree of D. Litt. from the [[University of Oxford]]. He married in 1869, and had two sons, one of whom, [[Edward Alexander Newell Arber|E. A. N. Arber]], became demonstrator in [[paleobotany]] at the [[University of Cambridge]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Scholarly edits==
As a scholarly editor, Arber made notable contributions to [[English literature]]. His name is associated particularly with the series of "[[English Reprints]]" (1868–1871), by which an accurate text of the works of many English authors, formerly only accessible in more expensive editions, was placed within reach of the general public. Among the thirty volumes of the series were [[Stephen Gosson]]'s ''School of Abuse'', [[Roger Ascham]]'s ''[[Toxophilus]]'', ''[[Tottel's Miscellany]]'', and [[Robert Naunton]]'s ''Fragmenta Regalia''. It was followed by the "English Scholar's Library" (16 volumes) which included the ''Works'' (1884) of [[John Smith of Jamestown|Captain John Smith]], governor of [[Virginia]], and the ''Poems'' (1882) of [[Richard Barnfield]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Other publications==
In his ''English Garner'' (8 vols. 1877-1890) he collected rare old tracts and poems; in 1899-1901 he issued ''[[British Anthologies]]'', and in 1907 began a series called ''[[A Christian Library]]''. He was also the sole editor of two vast English bibliographies: ''A Transcript of the [[Stationers' Register|Registers of the Stationers' Company]]'', 1553-1640 (1875–1894), and ''[[Term Catalogue|The Term Catalogues]]'', 1668-1709/11.&lt;ref&gt;''The Term Catalogues, 1668-1709, With a Number for Easter Term, 1711 A.D. A Contemporary Bibliography of English Literature in the Reigns of Charles II, James II, William and Mary, and Anne.'' Ed. by Edward Arber, vols. 1-3. London: Edward Arber, 1903/ 1905/ 1906.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Elseworlds 80-Page Giant''''' is an 80-page collection of ''[[Elseworlds]]'' stories published by [[DC Comics]].  The collection was withdrawn and pulped after DC became concerned about a scene in one of the stories.

==Publication history==

It included the stories "''Superman Jr. Is No More!''", featuring the [[Super-Sons]], and "''[[Letitia Lerner, Superman's Babysitter]]''", among others. However, DC Comics President [[Paul Levitz]] deemed the Letitia Lerner story inappropriate (for featuring scenes depicting the baby Superman in a microwave, among others) and ordered the press run halted and the printed issues destroyed. However, around 2,000 copies of the issue had already been shipped to the UK. Although DC attempted to recall these copies, they quickly became a highly sought after collector's item (see [[Recalled comics]] for more pulped, recalled, and erroneous comics), and estimates of available copies range between 700 and 2,000.

The Letitia Lerner story earned two [[Eisner Awards]], however, and was later republished in the pages of ''Bizarro Comics'' (a collection originally devised as a vehicle to showcase the feature).

The Super-Sons story was republished in ''Batman/Superman: Saga of the Super Sons''.

==History==
The company was founded as a joint-venture between [[Reuters]] and [[Dow Jones &amp; Company]] in May 1999 under the Dow Jones Reuters Business Interactive name,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://newsbreaks.infotoday.com/nbreader.asp?ArticleID=17964
|title=Dow Jones Interactive, Reuters Business Briefing Merged into Dow Jones Reuters Business Interactive  
|accessdate=15 May 2010
|publisher=Information Today, Inc
|date=17 May 1999
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and renamed Factiva six months later.  Timothy M. Andrews, a longtime Dow Jones executive, was founding president and chief executive of the venture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://newsbreaks.infotoday.com/nbreader.asp?ArticleID=17879
|title=Factiva: The New Name for Dow Jones Reuters Business Interactive 
|accessdate=15 May 2010
|publisher=Information Today, Inc
|date=8 November 1999
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mr. Andrews was succeeded by Clare Hart in January 2000, another longtime Dow Jones executive, who was serving as Factiva’s vice president and director of global sales.

It developed modules with [[Microsoft]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle Corp.]], [[IBM]] and [[Yahoo!]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20051001063212/http://search.yahoo.com/subscriptions]. Factiva has also partnered with EuroSpider, [[Comintelli]], [[PeopleSoft]], MediaMap, Biz360, ChoicePoint, [[BTRadianz]], AtHoc, and Reuters.  Factiva has also been included as of March 2003 in [[Microsoft Office|Microsoft's Office 2003]] program as one of the News research options within the Research Pane.

In 2005, Factiva acquired two private companies: [[London]]-based 2B Reputation Intelligence Ltd. and [[Denver, Colorado]]-based [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] services and software firm, [[Synapse, the Knowledge Link Corporation]]. 2B was a technology and consulting business, specializing in media monitoring and reputation management. Synapse provided taxonomy management software, pre-built taxonomies and taxonomy-building and indexing services.

This acquisition brought with it Synaptica, the taxonomy management software tool developed by Synapse, and Taxonomy Warehouse, a website developed by Synapse. Both Synaptica and Taxonomy Warehouse were developed by Factiva after the acquisition and are now owned by Dow Jones.

In 2006, Reuters sold its 50 percent share of Factiva to Dow Jones. Factiva was integrated into the Enterprise Media Group within Dow Jones.&lt;ref&gt;http://markets.financialcontent.com/stocks/news/read/300150/Dow_Jones_to_buy_rest_of_Factiva_for_$160_mln&lt;/ref&gt; Clare Hart was the executive vice president of this operating group.

In 2007, Factiva was included as a Dow Jones company sold to [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s News Corp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/printer_friendly_wires/2007Jul31/0,4675,DowJonesMurdochGlance,00.html|title=FOXNews.com - Thumbnails of Dow Jones and News Corp. - Business And Money - Business News - Financial News|author=|date=|website=www.foxnews.com|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Factiva provides searching by free-text, as well as region, subject, author, industry and company metadata. Searches can be further filtered by publication, language and date range.

Factiva offers a number of enterprise integration option&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://web.jinfo.com/go/sub/article/71874|title=Product Review of NewsEdge.com (Value - Competitors, Development &amp; Pricing)|work=Jinfo|access-date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;s, including a fully comprehensive web services API, the Factiva Developers Kit. This toolkit allows organisations to embed Factiva content and services within enterprise workflow applications.

In 2008 Dow Jones launched the website Synaptica Central to highlight the Synaptica tool and to discuss controlled vocabularies and semantic technologies etc.

In 2012, Dow Jones announced&lt;ref&gt;[http://dowjones.com/pressroom/releases/2012/1242012-DJChampionsNewGenerationofUXforFactiva-0095.asp DOW JONES &amp; COMPANY CHAMPIONS NEW GENERATION OF USER EXPERIENCE FOR FACTIVA CUSTOMERS].

==Digitalization==
In 2010 an initiative was taken to make all of the contents of ''Flora Malesiana'' available though a website, as a so-called e-flora (the 'e' standing for 'electronic' or 'enhanced'). This initiative was taken because (1) the overall progress of Flora Malesiana in terms of the number of species covered is too slow (about 80% of all species in Malesia still need to be treated) to make a timely contribution towards sustainability and conservation,&lt;ref name="Roos"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roos|first1=M.C.|last2=Hovenkamp|first2=P.|title=Flora Malesiana in the coming decade|journal=Blumea - Biodiversity, Evolution and Biogeography of Plants|date=30 October 2009|volume=54|issue=1|pages=3–5|doi=10.3767/000651909X475860}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (2) several volumes of Flora Malesiana are out-of-print.

[[File:FoundationsOfEconomicAnalysis.jpg|thumb|First edition (1947)]]
'''''Foundations of Economic Analysis''''' is a book by [[Paul A. Samuelson]] published in 1947 (Enlarged ed., 1983) by [[Harvard University Press]]. It is based on Samuelson's 1941 doctoral dissertation at [[Harvard University]]. The book sought to demonstrate a common mathematical structure underlying multiple branches of economics from two basic principles: [[Mathematical optimization|maximizing]] behavior of [[agent (economics)|agents]] (such as of [[Consumer choice|utility]] by consumers and [[Profit maximization|profits]] by firms) and stability of [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] as to economic systems (such as markets or economies). Among other contributions, it advanced the theory of [[index numbers]] and generalized [[welfare economics]].  It is especially known for definitively stating and formalizing [[qualitative economics|qualitative]] and quantitative versions of the "[[comparative statics]]" method for calculating how a change in any [[parameter]] (say, a change in tax rates) affects an economic system. One of its key insights about comparative statics, called the [[Comparative statics#Stability|correspondence principle]], states that [[General equilibrium#Stability|stability]] of equilibrium implies testable predictions about how the equilibrium changes when parameters are changed.

==Introduction==
The front page quotes the motto of [[J. Willard Gibbs]]:  "Mathematics is a language."  The book begins with this statement:
:''The existence of analogies between central features of various theories implies the existence of a general theory which underlies the particular theories and unifies them with respect to those central features.''  This fundamental principle of generalization by abstraction was enunciated by the eminent American mathematician [[E. H. Moore]] more than thirty years ago.  It is the purpose of the pages that follow to work out its implications for theoretical and applied economics.

Its other stated purpose (p.&amp;nbsp;3) is to show how ''[[Falsifiability|operationally meaningful]] theorems'' can be described with a small number of ''analogous methods''. Thus, "a general theory of economic theories" (1983, p. xxvi).

==Topical outline==
The body of the book is 353 pages. Topics and applications covered (all in terms of theory) include the following.
: Part I
* introduction
* [[General equilibrium|equilibrium systems]] (such as [[Supply and demand|for a market]] or economy)
* maximizing behavior (such as to [[profit maximization|profits]] by a firm and [[Consumer theory|utility]] by a consumer) in the calculus
: sales-tax increase on equilibrium for a firm
* [[comparative statics]] (changes in [[Supply and demand|prices and quantities]] and other equilibrium variables when underlying conditions change)
* [[Isoquant|cost and production]]
* [[consumer theory|consumer's behavior]]
* transformations, [[Elasticity (economics)|elasticities]], [[Composite good|composite commodities]], [[Index (economics)|index numbers]], and rationing
* [[cardinal utility]], constancy of the marginal utility of income, and [[consumer's surplus]]
* [[welfare economics]]
: Part II
* [[General equilibrium|stability of equilibrium systems]], dynamics (disturbances in equilibrium), and comparative statics
: the [[IS/LM model|Keynesian system]]
* linear and nonlinear systems
: Malthusian and optimum population
* dynamics
: the business cycle
: [[endogenous]] models
: mixed [[exogenous]]-[[endogenous]] theories
: mixed systems of a linear-[[stochastic]] type
* conclusions (on [[General equilibrium|neoclassical theory]] from [[Walras]] to hints of the [[Exogenous growth model|future]] in ''comparative dynamics'',  the comparative-statics counterpart of dynamic systems)

==Methods and analysis==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Le Chatelier's principle]] --&gt;
Samuelson's ''Foundations'' demonstrates that economic analysis benefits from the parsimonious and fruitful language of mathematics.  In its original version as a dissertation submitted to the David A. Wells Prize Committee of Harvard University in 1941, it was subtitled "The Observational Significance of Economic Theory" (p. ix).

One unifying theme, on the striking formal similarities of analysis in seemingly diverse fields, occurred only in the course of writing on them—from consumer's behavior and production economics of the firm to international trade, business cycles, and income analysis.  It dawned on the author that he was prodigal "in proving essentially the same theorems" over and over.  His failure of initial intuition, so he suggests, might be less surprising in light of the few economic writings then extant concerned with formulating ''meaningful theorems'' – hypotheses ''about'' empirical data—that could [[The Logic of Scientific Discovery|conceivably be refuted]] ''by'' empirical data (pp.&amp;nbsp;3–5).

Samuelson (pp.&amp;nbsp;5, 21–24) finds three sources of meaningful theorems sufficient to illuminate his purposes:
* ''maximizing behavior'' of economic units (as to ''utility'' for a consumer and ''profit'' for a firm)
* economic ''systems'' (including ''market''s and ''economies'') in ''stable'' equilibrium
* [[Qualitative economics|qualitative properties]] between two or more variables, such as an alleged technological relation or psychological law (indexed by the sign of the relevant functional relationship).
Part I conjectures that meaningful theorems for economic units and for their respective aggregates are almost all derivable  from general conditions of equilibrium. The equilibrium conditions can in turn be stated as ''maximization conditions''.  So, meaningful theorems reduce to [[Extremum|maximization conditions]].  The calculus of the relations is at a high level of abstraction but with the advantage of numerous applications.  Finally, Part I illustrates that there ''are'' meaningful theorems in economics, which apply to diverse fields.

Part II concentrates on aggregation of economic units into equilibrium of the system. But the symmetry conditions required for direct maximization of the ''system'', whether a market or even the simplest model of the business cycle, are lacking, in contrast to an economic ''unit'' or its corresponding aggregate.  What can be hypothetically derived (or rejected in some cases) is a ''stable'' equilibrium of the system.  (This is an equilibrium of the system such that, if a variable disturbs equilibrium, the system converges to equilibrium.)  ''Stability of equilibrium'' is proposed as the principal source of operationally meaningful theorems for economic systems (p.&amp;nbsp;5).

Analogies from physics (and biology) are conspicuous, such as the [[Le Chatelier's principle|Le Chatelier principle]] and  [[correspondence principle]], but they are given a nontrivially generalized formulation and application.  They and mathematical constructions, such as [[Lagrange multipliers|Lagrangian multipliers]], are given an operational economic interpretation.  The generalized ''Le Chatelier principle'' is for a maximum condition of equilibrium:   where all unknowns of the function are independently variable, auxiliary constraints ("just-binding" in leaving initial equilibrium unchanged)  reduce the response to a parameter change.  Thus, factor-demand and commodity-supply [[Elasticity (economics)|elasticities]] are hypothesized to be lower in the [[short run]] than in the [[long run]] because of the fixed-cost constraint in the short run.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Silberberg, 2008. "Le Chatelier principle," ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]''. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_L000049&amp;edition=current&amp;q=Le%20Chatelier%20principle&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=11 Abstract.]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the course of analysis,  ''[[comparative statics]]'', changes in equilibrium of the system that result from a [[parameter]] change of the system, is formalized and most clearly stated (Kehoe, 1987, p.&amp;nbsp;517).&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Kehoe, 1987. "Comparative statics," ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'', v. 1, pp.&amp;nbsp;517–20.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''correspondence principle'' is that the  ''stability'' of equilibrium for a system (such as a market or economy) implies meaningful theorems in comparative statics.   Alternatively, the hypothesis of stability imposes directional restrictions on the movement of the system (Samuelson, pp.&amp;nbsp;258, 5).  The correspondence is between comparative [[statics]] and the dynamics implied by stability of equilibrium.
{| style="border:1px solid #999; text-align:leftcenter; margin: auto;" cellspacing="20"
|The starting point of the analysis is the postulate of maximizing behavior.  The point is not (or not only) that everyone is out to maximize (&lt;ref name="Fischer"&gt;[[Stanley Fischer]], p.&amp;nbsp;235, 1987. "Samuelson, Paul Anthony," ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'', v. 4, pp.&amp;nbsp;234–41.&lt;/ref&gt;) even if true. Rather, first- and in particular higher-order (derivative) conditions of equilibrium at the maximum imply local behavioral relations (Samuelson, p.&amp;nbsp;16).  The stability of equilibrium with sufficient other hypothetical qualitative restrictions then generates testable hypotheses (pp.&amp;nbsp;16, 28–29).  Even where there is no context for purposive maximizing behavior, reduction to a maximization problem may be a convenient device for developing properties of the equilibrium, from which, however, no "[[Teleology|teleological]] or [[normative economics|normative]] welfare significance" is warranted (pp.&amp;nbsp;52–53).
|}
Chapter VIII on [[welfare economics]] is described as an attempt "to give a brief but fairly complete survey of the whole field of welfare economics" (p.&amp;nbsp;252). This Samuelson does in 51 pages, including his exposition of what became known as the [[social welfare function#Bergson–Samuelson social welfare function|Bergson-Samuelson social welfare function]].  Theorems derived in welfare economics, he notes, are deductive implications of assumptions that are not refutable, thus not meaningful in a certain sense.   Still, the social welfare function can represent any index ([[cardinal utility|cardinal]] or not) of the economic measures of any logically possible ethical belief system that is required to [[total ordering|order]] any (hypothetically) feasible social configurations as "better than", "worse than",  or "indifferent to" each other (p.&amp;nbsp;221).  It also definitively elucidates the notion of [[Pareto optimality]] and the "germ of truth in Adam Smith's doctrine of the [[invisible hand]]" (Samuelson, 1983, p. xxiv; Fischer, 1987, p.&amp;nbsp;236&lt;ref name="Fischer"/&gt;).

The final pages of the book (pp.&amp;nbsp;354–55) outline possible directions analytical methods might take, including for example models that show how:
* [[Deficit spending|deficit financing]] could produce positive short-run effects on the economy that are swamped by adverse long-run effects on capital accumulation (seriously reconsidered later as [[Crowding out (economics)|crowding out]])
* declines in [[Mortality rate|age-specific mortality]] affect the [[demography|net reproductive rate]] (whose implications for [[population growth]] are [[:Image:Population curve.svg|less abstract]] than they might first appear).
Samuelson closes by expressing hope in the future use of ''comparative dynamics'' to:
: aid in the attack upon diverse problems – from the trivial behavior of a single small commodity, to the fluctuations of important components of the business cycle, and even to the majestic problems of economic development.

==Appendices==
There are two mathematical appendices totalling 83 pages. The first gathers and develops "very briefly" and "without striving for rigor" results on maximization conditions and [[quadratic forms]] used in the book and not conveniently collected elsewhere (p.&amp;nbsp;389).  The other is on [[difference equations]] ("for the dynamic economist") and other functional equations.

==Enlarged edition==
The 1983 enlarged edition includes an additional 12-page "Introduction" and a new 145-page appendix with some post-1947 developments in analytical economics, including how conclusions of the book are affected by them.

==Assessments==
* [[Kenneth Arrow]] (1983) describes ''Foundations'' as "the only example I know of a doctoral dissertation that is a treatise, perhaps I should say of a treatise that has so much originality in every part that it is entitled to be accepted as a thesis."&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth J. Arrow, 1983. "Contribution to Welfare Economics," E. C. Brown and [[Robert Solow|R. M. Solow]], ed., ''Paul Samuelson and Modern Economic Theory'',  p.&amp;nbsp;19 [pp.&amp;nbsp;15–30].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Richard N. Cooper]] (1997) writes that the book "drastically redirected the advanced study of economics toward greater and more productive use of mathematics."&lt;ref&gt;Richard N. Cooper, 1997.  "[http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19970901fabook3617/paul-a-samuelson/economics-an-introductory-analysis.html ''Economics: An Introductory Analysis'', Paul A. Samuelson]," ''Foreign Affairs'', September/October.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Notwithstanding the important [[Social Choice and Individual Values|work]] of Arrow, [[Kotaro Suzumura]] (1987) affirms the Bergson-Samuelson social welfare function as "logically impeccable."&lt;ref&gt;Kotaro Suzumura, 1987. "social welfare function", ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'', v. 4, p.&amp;nbsp;420 [pp.&amp;nbsp;418–20].&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Nobel Prize  [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1970/index.html citation] is applicable to ''Foundations'': "for the scientific work through which [Samuelson] has developed static and dynamic economic theory and actively contributed to raising the level of analysis in economic science."

'''''Gezelligheid''''' ({{IPA-nl|ɣəˈzɛləxɛit|-|Nl-gezelligheid.ogg}}) is a [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word which, depending on context, can be translated as '[[wikt:conviviality|conviviality]]', '[[wikt:coziness|coziness]]', '[[fun]]'. It is often used to describe a social and relaxed situation. It can also indicate belonging, time spent with loved ones, catching up with an old friend or just the general togetherness that gives people a warm feeling.

A common trait to all descriptions of ''gezelligheid'' is a general and abstract sensation of individual well-being that one typically shares with others. All descriptions involve a positive atmosphere, ''flow'' or vibe that colours the individual personal experience in a favorable way and in one way or another corresponds to social contexts.

Being a vague, abstract notion, the word is considered by some to be an example of [[untranslatability]], and one of their hardest words to translate to [[English language|English]]. Some consider the word to encompass the heart of [[Culture of the Netherlands|Dutch culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Seth Stevenson, "The Quest for ''Gezellig''," in "Should I Move to Amsterdam," Slate 23, Aug, 2005, available at http://www.slate.com/articles/life/welltraveled/features/2005/should_i_move_to_amsterdam/the_quest_for_gezellig.html. See also "Gezellig — a word that encompasses the heart of Dutch Culture," at http://www.dutchamsterdam.nl/155-gezellig&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word derives from ''gezel'' which means 'companion' or '[[friend]]'. During the [[Middle Ages]] a ''gezel'' was also the Dutch term for a '[[journeyman]]', which in the Dutch [[guild]] system formed a group around a single [[master craftsman]]; hence the added meaning of 'belonging'.&lt;ref&gt;Van Dale etymologisch woordenboek&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use ==
''Gezellig'' in English language could be used in places or with a party of people (one or more) that are 'easy to relax into' and 'heartening'.

The adjective ''gezellig'' can be used in a wide variety of situations:&lt;ref&gt;All examples given come from the book ''The Undutchables'', by C. White.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A room, restaurant, or café can be ''gezellig'' (meaning 'cozy' or 'inviting').
* A person can be ''gezellig'' (meaning 'entertaining' or 'pleasant', 'convivial' or 'sociable').
* A party can be ''gezellig'' (meaning 'fun').
* A visit to one's grandparents can be ''gezellig'' (meaning 'togetherness').

''Gezellig'' can also be used as an exclamation, which can either carry the meanings described above or be used [[sarcasm|sarcastically]] or [[irony|ironically]] or to express enthusiasm for an upcoming event such as one of the above.

The antonym to ''gezellig'' is ''ongezellig'', which is used to describe places and situations that are uninviting, lacking in warmth or atmosphere, a person who is cold, distant, unsociable, unwilling to engage in a social situation.

== Similar words ==
* The [[Danish language|Danish]] word ''[[hygge]]'' ({{IPA-da|ˈhyɡə|}}) is very close in meaning. Etymologically, it is related to the Dutch word ''heugen'', meaning 'to remember', and ''verheugen'', meaning 'to look forward to'.
* The German term ''[[Gemütlichkeit]]'' (of which ''gemoedelijkheid'' is its Dutch cognate), invoking coziness and comfort and which has also been adopted by the English language, covers some of the possible meanings of ''gezellig'', but not all. Although the German term ''Geselligkeit'' does look a lot like the Dutch word, it has a different meaning.
* Norwegian also has the word: ''[[koselig]]'', meaning a 'sense of coziness' and 'human warmth in an agreeable environment'.
* Swedish use a term whose concept is very close: ''[[mysig]]'', a pleasant and warm atmosphere of togetherness in a pleasant setting.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1551">'''Heiðr''' (from the [[Old Norse]] adjective meaning "bright"  or the noun meaning "honour") is the seeress and witch (''[[völva]]'') mentioned in one stanza of ''[[Völuspá]]'', related to the story of the [[Æsir-Vanir war]]:

:Heith they named her
:who sought their home,
:The wide-seeing witch,
:in [[seiðr|magic]] wise;
:Minds she bewitched
:that were moved by her magic,
:To evil women
:a joy she was.
:
::—''Völuspá'' &lt;small&gt;(22)&lt;/small&gt;, [http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/poe/poe03.htm Bellows’ translation]&lt;ref&gt;Bellows, Henry Adams (trans.). 1923. ''The poetic Edda''. New York: The American-Scandinavian Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;

The general assumption is that Heiðr is an alternate name for the witch [[Gullveig]], mentioned in the previous stanza, who, in turn, is often thought to be a [[hypostasis (religion)|hypostasis]] of [[Freyja]]. But it is sometimes argued that the ''völva'' who recites the poem refers to herself.

Heiðr is also a seeress in several works such as ''[[Landnámabók]]'' &lt;small&gt;([[Sturlubók|S]] 179 / [[Hauksbók|H]] 45)&lt;/small&gt;, ''[[Hrólfs saga kraka]]'' &lt;small&gt;(3)&lt;/small&gt; and ''[[Örvar-Odds saga]]'' &lt;small&gt;(2)&lt;/small&gt;, where she predicts Örvar's death.

Heiðr is lastly a child of the [[Jötunn|giant]] [[Hrímnir]] according to ''[[Völuspá hin skamma]]'' (''[[Hyndluljóð]]'', &lt;small&gt;32&lt;/small&gt;).

'''Juan Manuel Blanes Municipal Museum of the Arts''' ({{lang-es|'''Museo de Bellas Artes Juan Manuel Blanes'''}}) is the name of a [[municipal]] [[museum]] in [[Prado, Montevideo|Prado]], [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]].

==Location and History==

[[Image:JardinJaponesMVD001 640x480.jpg|thumb|200px|Japanese park, Museo de Bellas Artes Juan Manual Blanes (Prado, Montevideo)]]
The Juan Manuel Blanes Municipal Museum of the Arts is located at Avenida Millan 4015, in the [[neighbourhoods of Montevideo|neighbourhood]] of Prado, [[Montevideo]], in a [[Palladian]] villa designated a National Heritage Site in 1975. The villa was originally designed in 1870 by [[Juan Alberto Capurro]], an engineer trained at the [[Turin Polytechnic]], for the then-owner Dr. [[Juan Battista Raffo]]. The surrounding garden reveals elements of French landscape design. The municipality acquired the villa in 1929, when it commissioned the architect [[Eugenio Baroffio]] to renovate and expand the building. Baroffio maintained the eclecticism of the original design, leaving the facade intact. The museum was founded in 1930, coinciding with the 100th anniversary of the first [[Constitution of Uruguay]], and named after the patriotic Uruguayan artist, [[Juan Manuel Blanes]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.montevideo.gub.uy/ciudad/cultura/museos-y-salas/museo-blanes Juan Manuel Blanes Municipal Museum of Arts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426044450/http://www.montevideo.gub.uy/ciudad/cultura/museos-y-salas/museo-blanes |date=2011-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Park and gardens==
This property has a big park full of ancient trees, on the shore of the [[Miguelete Creek]].

This is a '''list of [[free and open-source software]] [[Package manager|packages]]''', [[computer software]] licensed under [[free software license]]s and [[open-source license]]s. Software that fits [[the Free Software Definition]] may be more appropriately called [[free software]]; the [[GNU project]] in particular objects to their works being referred to as [[open-source software|open-source]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html |title=Why Open Source misses the point of Free Software |author=Richard Stallman |date=July 13, 2011 |accessdate=August 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For more information about the philosophical background for open-source software, see [[free software movement]] and [[Open Source Initiative]].

The '''Malachite Room''' of the [[Winter Palace]], [[St Petersburg]], was designed in the late 1830s by the architect [[Alexander Briullov]] for use a formal reception room for the [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Charlotte of Prussia)|Empress Alexandra Fyodorovna]], wife of [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]]. It replaced the [[Jasper|Jasper Room]], which was destroyed in the fire of 1837.{{r|Hermitage}}

The room obtains its name from the use of [[malachite]] for its columns and fireplace. This large salon contains a large malachite [[urn]] as well as furniture from the workshops of Peter Gambs (1802-1871), son of the famous furniture maker [[Heinrich Gambs]], which were rescued from the 1837 fire.

During the Tsarist era, the Malachite Room, which links the state rooms to the [[Private Apartments of the Winter Palace|private rooms]], served as not only a state drawing room of the Tsaritsa, but also as a gathering place for the Imperial family before and during [[official functions]].{{r|Sitwell}} It was here that [[House of Romanov|Romanov]] brides were traditionally dressed by the Tsarina before proceeding from the adjoining [[Arabian Hall of the Winter Palace|Arabian Hall]] to their weddings in the [[Grand Church of the Winter Palace|Grand Church]].{{sfnp|Maylunas|Mironenko|1996|p=109|ps=}}

From June to October 1917 this room was the seat of the [[Russian Provisional Government]]. When the palace was stormed during the night of 7 November 1917, the members of the Government were arrested in the adjoining private dining room.{{r|Guardian}}

Today, as part of the [[State Hermitage Museum]], this room retains its original decoration.

'''Mark Joseph Green''' (born March 15, 1945) is an American author, former public official, [[public interest]] [[lawyer]] and a  [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[politician]] from [[New York City]].  He worked with [[Ralph Nader]] from 1970–80, eventually as director of [[Public Citizen]]'s Congress Watch, and was the former president of [[Air America Radio]] (2007–09). His 2001 nomination and loss to [[Michael Bloomberg]] for NYC Mayor is chronicled in the 2002 Sundance Film, ''Off the Record: The 9/11 Election''.

He published his 23rd book in May 2016, ''Bright, Infinite Future: A Generational Memoir on the Progressive Rise'' (St Martin's Press). He has co-written two [[bestseller]]s, ''Who Runs Congress?'' (1972) (co-written with [[James Fallows]]) and ''The Book On Bush'' (2004) (co-written with [[Eric Alterman]]). He has collaborated on several books with [[consumer advocate]] Ralph Nader (''The Closed Enterprise System,'' 1972; ''Monopoly Makers,'' 1974, ''Verdicts on Lawyers,'' 1975, ''Taming the Giant Corporation,'' 1976, another recent book is ''Change for America: A Progressive Blueprint for the 44th President'', co-edited by Green and [[Michele Jolin]], a transition policy book for President Obama, co-produced by the New Democracy Project and the [[Center for American Progress]] Action Fund).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanprogressaction.org/issues/2008/changeforamerica Change for America: A Progressive Blueprint for the 44th President], americanprogressaction.org; accessed October 28, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a Visiting Scholar at NYU College and Law School from 2002-06.

He was host of the nationally syndicated radio show, ''Both Sides Now'' from 2010 - December 2016.  which was aired on 200 stations and recorded at IHeartMedia in New York City. The weekly program rotated such regular panelists as [[Arianna Huffington]], [[Ron Reagan]], [[Bob Shrum]], [[Jonathan Alter]], as well as [[Kellyanne Conway]], [[Mary Matalin]], [[David Frum]], and [[Rich Lowry]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}. In February, 2017, he founded and ran the Twitter handle @ShadowingTrump, consisting of 21 leading national progressive scholars and former officials. It rose to 74,000 followers by the end of 2017.

Green was [[New York City Department of Consumer Affairs|New York City Consumer Affairs Commissioner]] from 1990–93 and was twice elected [[New York City Public Advocate]], in 1993 and 1997. He won Democratic [[Primary election|primaries]] for the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]], [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]], and [[Mayor of New York City]] and in each case lost in the general election.  Additionally, he has lost campaigns to be the Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate, the Democratic Nominee for New York Attorney General, and the Democratic Nominee for New York Public Advocate eight years after finishing off two terms in that position.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==Political career==
{{more citations needed|section|date=February 2017}}

===1960s-1970s===
[[Image:Mark Green 2 by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Mark Green at a Ralph Nader speech in [[New York City]]]] 
In 1967, he interned for [[Jacob Javits]] and while in law school in the early 1970s, Green was a "Nader's Raider" at [[Ralph Nader]]'s Public Citizen&lt;ref name=GreenMachine/&gt; where he worked on a lawsuit against the administration of [[Richard Nixon]] after the firing of Watergate special prosecutor [[Archibald Cox]].{{Specify|date=August 2009|reason=What lawsuit, what role?|post-text=?}} After law school, he returned to [[Washington D.C.]] and ran the Congress Watch division of the consumer rights advocacy group [[Public Citizen]] from 1977-80.&lt;ref name=GreenMachine/&gt;

===1980s===
In 1980, he returned to [[New York City]] and won the Democratic [[primary election]] to represent the [[East Side (Manhattan)|East Side of Manhattan]] in the House of Representatives; he lost the race to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] incumbent, [[Bill Green (New York politician)|Bill Green]] (not related).&lt;ref name=GreenMachine/&gt; In 1981, Green, with songwriter [[Harry Chapin]], founded the New Democracy Project, a [[public policy]] institute in New York City. He ran it for a decade. During the [[United States presidential election, 1984|1984 presidential election]], he served as chief [[speechwriter]] for Democratic candidate Senator [[Gary Hart]],&lt;ref name=GreenMachine/&gt; who ran second in the primaries.

In 1986, Green won the Democratic nomination for the Senate against [[multimillionaire]] [[John S. Dyson|John Dyson]], spending just $800,000 to Dyson's $6,000,000.&lt;ref name=GreenMachine/&gt; Dyson remained on the ballot as the candidate of the [[Liberal Party of New York|Liberal Party]]. Green lost the [[general election]] to [[Republican party (United States)|Republican]] incumbent [[Al D'Amato|Alfonse D'Amato]] who was supported by then mayor [[Ed Koch]];&lt;ref name=GreenMachine/&gt; Green filed a formal ethics complaint in the Senate Ethics Committee against D'Amato that resulted in the Senator being reprimanded by the United States Senate after media reports that suggested that nomination of D'Amato as a chair of the [[United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs|Senate Committee of Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs]] had been tainted by illegal financing of his campaign to the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/syracuse-herald-journal-jul-18-1989-p-53/|title=Syracuse Herald Journal Newspaper Archives, Jul 18, 1989, p. 53|date=1989-07-18|work=NewspaperArchive.com|access-date=2018-02-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his Senate campaign, Green refused to accept money from special interest groups' [[political action committee]]s (PACs) - which had accounted for 25% of all campaign spending in Congressional campaigns in 1984&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/01/opinion/topics-investments-returned-unpac.html Topics; Investments Returned; UnPAC]'', May 1, 1986, [[The New York Times]].&lt;/ref&gt; - denouncing PACs as "legalized bribery."&lt;ref name=Tivnan&gt;Edward Tivnan, ''The Lobby; Jewish Political Power and American Foreign Policy'', 1987, p. 193; {{ISBN|0-671-50153-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His opinion mirrored the stance of [[Common Cause]], the citizens' lobby which organized to abolish PACs over fears of "[[Special interest groups|special interests]]" buying votes.&lt;ref name=Tivnan/&gt;

===1990s===
{{more citations needed|date=February 2017}}
In 1990, he was appointed the Consumer Affairs Commissioner of New York City by Mayor [[David Dinkins]].&lt;ref name=GreenMachine/&gt; In 1993, he was elected the first [[New York City Public Advocate]],&lt;ref name= NYTGiuliani/&gt; and re-elected in 1997. In that office, Green led investigations of [[Health maintenance organization|HMOs]], hospitals, and nursing homes which led to fines by the [[New York State Attorney General]].

A 1994 investigation on the Bell Regulations ("Libby Zion Law") to limit resident working hours and requiring physician supervision—and follow-up study prompted the [[New York State Department of Health]] to crack down on violating hospitals. He led an effort against tobacco advertising aimed at children, enacting a law banning cigarette vending machines and released a series of exposés and legal actions against [[tobacco advertising]] targeted at children—concluding that [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company]] was engaged in "commercial child abuse"—which culminated in a 1997 [[Federal Trade Commission]] decision that ended the [[Joe Camel]] ads.

As Public Advocate, Green first proposed the 311 complaint help line that Mayor Bloomberg later implemented. He wrote laws that matched small donations with multiple city funds, created the Voter Commission, upheld the legality of the Independent Budget Office,  barred stores from charging women more than men for the same services, and that prohibited companies from firing female employees merely because they were victims of domestic violence. He started the City's first web site, NYC.Gov, which he later gifted to City Hall, where it is still in use.

One of his most high-profile accomplishments was a lawsuit to obtain information about [[racial profiling]] in [[Rudy Giuliani]]'s [[NYPD|police force]]. As Green told the ''[[Gotham Gazette]]'', "We sued Mayor Giuliani because he was in deep denial about racial profiling. [After winning the case, we] released an investigation showing a pattern of unpunished misconduct ... [and] the rate that police with substantiated complaints are punished went from 25 percent to 75 percent." Green was reportedly one of the first public officials to draw attention to racial profiling by the NYPD.

Green ran for the U.S. Senate again in 1998, when D'Amato was seeking a fourth term. Green finished third in the Democratic primary behind the winner, Congressman [[Charles Schumer]], and 1984 Democratic [[Vice President of the United States|vice presidential]] nominee [[Geraldine Ferraro]]. Despite Green's personal ties to Nader, he did not support [[Ralph Nader presidential campaign, 2000|Nader's presidential campaigns]].

In [[United States presidential election, 2000|the 2000 campaign]] he praised Nader's work as a consumer advocate but endorsed Democratic nominee [[Al Gore]], who narrowly lost the election to [[George W. Bush]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Ramirez|first=Anthony|title=Metro Briefing|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 1, 2000|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B03E4DD1230F932A3575AC0A9669C8B63&amp;scp=2&amp;sq=Nader+Mark+Green&amp;st=nyt}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, he assisted the successful Senate campaign of first lady Hillary Clinton, coining the phrase "Listening Tour" which guided the candidate through a state she hadn't previously lived in. In 2004, Green was co-chair of Senator [[John Kerry]]'s presidential campaign in New York.

===2001 race for Mayor===
{{more citations needed|section|date=February 2017}}
{{Main|New York City mayoral election, 2001}} 
Green ran for [[Mayor of New York City]] and won the Democratic nomination in 2001 but lost to [[Michael Bloomberg]] 50%–48% in the closest NYC mayoral election in a century. Green had narrowly defeated [[Fernando Ferrer]] in the primary, surviving a negative contest that divided the party. The two other candidates were Council Speaker [[Peter Vallone]] and City Comptroller [[Alan Hevesi]].

The [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]] occurred on the morning of the Democratic primary and contributed to Green's loss.  Also, Bloomberg spent an unprecedented $74 million in his campaign, especially on TV ads and direct mail. [[Rudy Giuliani]], who suddenly had an extremely high popularity publicly endorsed Bloomberg.&lt;ref&gt;Nagourney, Adam. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9907E6DF1630F93BA15753C1A9679C8B63 "Bloomberg Puts Eggs In a Basket: Giuliani's"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 28, 2001; accessed December 31, 2007.&lt;br&gt;"Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's decision to endorse Michael R. Bloomberg at [[New York City Hall|City Hall]] yesterday provides Mr. Bloomberg with perhaps his greatest hope for victory as he moves into the final days of what his supporters describe as a troubled campaign."&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Economist]]'' wrote, "The billionaire businessman [Bloomberg] is usually seen as one of the post–September 11th winners (if such a word can be so used): he would probably have lost the mayoralty to Mark Green, a leftish Democrat, had the terrorist strike not happened. Yet it is also worth noting that his election probably spared New York City a turbulent period of score-settling over Rudy Giuliani's legacy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/printedition/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=1328844|title=New York's Difficult Year|work=[[The Economist]]|date=September 12, 2002|accessdate=2007-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Smith wrote in ''[[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]]'' in 2011, "Many old-school Democrats believe that Bloomberg's 2001 victory over Mark Green was a terrorist-provoked, money-soaked aberration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/nymag/rss/all/mayoral-election-2011-11/index4.html|title=Who Will Win the 2013 Mayoral Election?|author=Smith, Chris|work=New York Magazine|date=November 7, 2011|accessdate=August 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Green was criticized by the Ferrer campaign for the actions of supporters in the run-off that were construed as racist, involving literature with ''[[New York Post]]'' caricatures of Ferrer and [[Al Sharpton]] distributed in white enclaves of [[Brooklyn]] and [[Staten Island]]. Green stated that he had nothing to do with the dissemination of the literature.  An investigation by the [[district attorney]] of [[Kings County, New York]], [[Charles J. Hynes]], came to the conclusion that "Mark Green had no knowledge of these events, and that when he learned of them, he repeatedly denounced the distribution of this literature and sought to find out who had engaged in it."&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Nancie L., [http://articles.nydailynews.com/2006-07-22/news/18339210_1_hynes-mark-green-campaign-committee-friends "Green Cleared In Campaign Flap"], ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'', July 22, 2006; retrieved 2011-06-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The incident kept Ferrer from endorsing the Democratic nominee and is thought to have diminished minority turnout in the general election which helped the Republican candidate win in an overwhelmingly Democratic city. Green wrote an article about the campaign a decade later in the 9/11 anniversary issue of ''New York Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/news/9-11/10th-anniversary/mark-green|title=Green, Mark|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he reported that Bloomberg told him in 2002 that "I wouldn't have won" without Ferrer's late campaign opposition to Green.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===2006 race for state Attorney General===
{{Main|New York attorney general election, 2006}}
Green ran in the Democratic primary for [[New York State Attorney General]] in 2006. He faced former [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|HUD]] Secretary [[Andrew Cuomo]], former White House Staff Secretary [[Sean Patrick Maloney]], and former [[Lieutenant Governor of New York|lieutenant governor]] candidate [[Charles King (New York)|Charles King]] in the primary. Green did not receive the required 25% at the state Democratic convention to earn a spot on the primary ballot and therefore had to circulate nominating petitions statewide to be on the September ballot.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

He was required to submit at least 15,000 valid signatures; on July 13, he submitted more than 40,000 signatures. He held several endorsements of note, including former NYC Mayor [[David Dinkins]], [[Brooklyn]] [[borough president|Borough President]] [[Marty Markowitz]], the [[Sierra Club]], the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW), the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'', and the ''[[New York Daily News]]''.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

On September 12, 2006, Green lost to Andrew Cuomo in his bid to secure the Democratic nomination to succeed then-Attorney General [[Eliot Spitzer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ny1.com/ny1/content/index.jsp?stid=1&amp;aid=62538 "Clinton, Spitzer, Spencer, Cuomo Advance In Primaries"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927003252/http://www.ny1.com/ny1/content/index.jsp?stid=1&amp;aid=62538 |date=2007-09-27 }}, ny1.com; accessed December 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; On the evening the results came in, he vowed to reporters that "I won't be running for office again. But I'll continue to advocate, write and teach." Cuomo beat the Republican candidate, former [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] [[District Attorney]] [[Jeanine Pirro]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===2009 race for Public Advocate===
{{Main|New York City Public Advocate election, 2009}}
On February 10, 2009, Green announced that he would again run for the office of Public Advocate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ny1.com/content/news_beats/politics/Default.aspx "Mark Green Announces Candidacy For Public Advocate"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307204617/http://www.ny1.com/content/news_beats/politics/Default.aspx |date=2009-03-07 }}, ''[[NY1]]''; accessed February 10, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; His policy director was [[Benjamin Kallos]] (who later was elected to the [[New York City Council]]), with whom he worked on "100 Ideas for a Better City".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rivoli|first=Dan|title=Kallos Joins Green Campaign|url=http://ot.nypress.com/?p=2721|newspaper=Our Town East Side: Upper East Side News &amp; Community|date=April 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Phillips|first=Anna|url=http://gothamschools.org/2009/11/02/would-a-uft-endorsement-for-thompson-make-a-difference|title=Would a UFT Endorsement for Thompson Make a Difference?|publisher=Gotham Schools|date=November 2, 2009|accessdate=October 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Paybarah|first=Azi|url=http://observer.com/2009/06/another-transparency-web-site|title=Another Transparency website|publisher=The New York Observer|date=June 15, 2009|accessdate=October 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As one of the top two finishers in the Democratic primary, Green qualified for the September 29 runoff, but lost to City Councilmember [[Bill de Blasio]] who went on to win the mayoralty in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/16/nyregion/16advocate.html|title=De Blasio and Green in Runoff for Advocate|last=Bosman|first=Julie|date=2009-09-16|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-07|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Merriam&amp;ndash;Webster's Dictionary of English Usage''''' is a [[usage dictionary]] published by [[Merriam-Webster]], Inc., of Springfield, Massachusetts . It is currently available in a reprint edition (1994) {{ISBN|0-87779-132-5}} or {{ISBN|978-0-87779-132-4}}. (The 1989 edition did not include ''Merriam&amp;ndash;'' in the title. It was added as part of the [[rebranding]] campaign to emphasize the differences between Merriam&amp;ndash;Webster's dictionaries and  [[Webster's_Dictionary#The_name_Webster_used_byyjkuukmy_others|dictionaries of other publishers]] using the [[generic trademark]] ''Webster's''.)

The book has been praised by language experts.  [[Stan Carey]] at the blog ''Sentence First'' concludes that it operates "in such a thorough and unbiased way is what elevates ''MWDEU'' so far above the ordinary. Each entry is presented in a much broader context than is typically the case in books that advise on English usage and style."&lt;ref&gt;[http://stancarey.wordpress.com/2009/03/30/in-praise-of-a-reference-book-mwdeu/ "In praise of a reference book: MWDEU" ''Sentence First'' March 30th, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is critically acclaimed by the linguist [[Geoffrey Pullum]], who calls it "the best usage book I know of... utterly wonderful." &lt;ref&gt;see [http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001803.html Geoffrey K. Pullum at January 15, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is known for its historical scholarship, analysis, use of examples, and [[descriptive]] approach. It has more than 2,300 entries, and includes more than 20,000 quotations from prominent writers.&lt;ref&gt;see  [http://www.merriam-webster.com/cgi-bin/book.pl?usage.htm&amp;6 ''Usage'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MetroLyrics''' is a [[lyrics]]-dedicated website, founded in December 2002. The MetroLyrics database contains over 1 million songs performed by over 16,000 artists.

==History==
MetroLyrics was the first lyrics-dedicated site to license licensing aggregator [[Gracenote]] Inc.'s lyrics catalogue in April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://metroleap.com/releases.php Metroleap.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110226195814/http://metroleap.com/releases.php |date=2011-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this lyrics licensing model, lyrics copyright holders accrue royalty revenue when their work is displayed on MetroLyrics.com, which MetroLyrics recuperates by collecting money from [[banner advertisement]]s on the site. Royalties are paid on all displayed lyrics and are handled through Gracenote. In January 2013, [[LyricFind]] acquired Gracenote's lyrics licensing business, merging it in with their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lyricfind.com/gracenote-larry-marcus/ |title=Welcoming Gracenote and Larry Marcus! |date=January 15, 2013 |accessdate=March 14, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109054655/http://www.lyricfind.com/gracenote-larry-marcus/ |archivedate=November 9, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; MetroLyrics' licensing model is distinct, as many lyrics websites still offer content that is allegedly unlicensed and [[Copyright infringement|copyright infringing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Plambeck|first=Joseph|title=Lyrics Sites at Center of Fight Over Royalties|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 9, 2010|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/10/business/media/10lyrics.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=lyrics%20royalty&amp;st=cse|accessdate=May 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MetroLyrics was acquired by [[CBS Interactive]] in October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = CBS Interactive Music Group broadens distribution of its core assets to metrolyrics.com's Global Audience of more than 25 million users| url = http://www.cbsradio.com/press_center/releases/pressrelease100819-10-06-2011.html| accessdate = October 6, 2011| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111008111342/http://www.cbsradio.com/press_center/releases/pressrelease100819-10-06-2011.html| archivedate = October 8, 2011| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Wetzel''' (born October 23, 1943) is an American artist. He is best known for his oil paintings but also has exhibited collages and sculpture. In 1969 and 1970, Wetzel exhibited with the [[Chicago Imagists]], a grouping of Chicago artists who were ascendant in the late 1960s and early 1970s.&lt;ref name=Wetzel&gt;{{cite web |title=Richard Wetzel |publisher=The Chicago Imagists |url=http://chicagoimagists.com/#archive/w/richardwetzel |accessdate=May 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nonplussed Some (and Some More) (exhibitions) |publisher=The Chicago Imagists |url=http://chicagoimagists.com/#archive/n/nonplussedsome |accessdate=May 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schultze69&gt;{{cite news |last=Schultze |first=Franz |title=A Tale of Two Cities in Art |newspaper=Chicago Daily News |date=March 8, 1969 |page=Panorama section, 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;{{cite news |last=Baker |first=Robb |title=Welcome to the 'Homey Chicago Basement' |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=March 16, 1969 |page=section 5, p. 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shaw&gt;{{cite book |last=Shaw |first=Goldene |title=History of the Hyde Park Art Center 1939–1976 |publisher=Hyde Park Art Center |location=Chicago |year=1976 |pages=23, 26, 34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Born in Elmhurst, Illinois, Wetzel was the second of three boys (with brothers David and Douglas). Both Wetzel's parents were artists. Wetzel's father, Wilbert, was a photoengraver.  His mother, Elfreda, was a commercial artist. The family eventually settled in Arlington Heights, Illinois.

Wetzel's interest in art developed at an early age, but he was also a three-time gymnastics individual medalist (pommel horse) on the Arlington High School (AHS) team that won two successive Illinois State Gymnastics Championships: 1958–59 and 1959–60.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Arlington High School 'Cardinals' |publisher=Illinois High School 'Glory Days' |url=http://www.illinoishsglorydays.com/id222.html |accessdate=May 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At age 17, two significant events influenced Wetzel's future direction. The first was the arrival of artist [[James F. Walker]] as an art teacher at Arlington High School.&lt;ref name=Yochim&gt;{{cite book |last=Yochim |first=Louise Dunn |title=Role and Impact: The Chicago Society of Artists |location=Chicago |publisher=Chicago Society of Artists |year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walker arrived from his teaching position at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] (SAIC) during Wetzel's senior year, 1960–61. Walker was an artist who created mixed-media surrealist images.&lt;ref name=Yochim/&gt;  The second event was a trip to New York City to view an exhibition of the works of Max Ernst at the Museum of Modern Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lieberman |first=William |title=The Museum of Modern Art: Max Ernst 1961 |publisher=Museum of Modern Art |location=New York |year=1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of these two artists would shape Wetzel's vision for decades to come.

After graduation, Wetzel enrolled in SAIC in fall 1961, where he studied with [[Vera Berdich]],&lt;ref name=Schultze68&gt;{{cite news |last=Schultze |first=Franz |title=New York Cool Meets Chicago Doodly-Scratch |newspaper=Chicago Daily News |date=February 24, 1968 |page=Panorama section, 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Whitney Halstead]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Halstead, Whitney |publisher=Art Institute of Chicago |url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/artist/Halstead,+Whitney |accessdate=May 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Kapsalis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Thomas H. Kapsalis — American Artist |publisher=Ukrainian Institute of Modern Art |url=http://uima-chicago.org/thomas-h-kapsalis-american-artist |accessdate=May 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sonia Landy Sheridan|Sonia Sheridan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sheridan, Sonia Landy |publisher=Art Institute of Chicago |url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/artist/Sheridan,+Sonia+Landy |accessdate=May 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at SAIC, Wetzel met classmate and fellow artist Janice Anderson. They married after Janice's graduation in 1965.

Prior to his marriage, Wetzel moved to [[Old Town, Chicago|Chicago's Old Town]], a neighborhood known for the arts, its bars and nightlife, and 1960s hippie counterculture. In 1962, Wetzel opened the Sedgwick Street Gallery with AHS classmate Dennis Rice on North Avenue at the Sedgwick L Stop. The gallery was located up the street from the Mole Hole, home of the counterculture newspaper the ''Chicago Seed'', and walking distance from Cabrini Green, a low-income, high-rise complex known for high poverty and crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cabrini Green |publisher=Encyclopedia of Chicago |url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/199.html |accessdate=May 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the gallery, Wetzel and Rice exhibited the works of Karl Wirsum, Barry Malloy, Luis Ortiz, William Nichols, Bill Arsenault, Ed Paschke, and Wetzel's mentor, James F. Walker, as well as his own work.

In 1968, Wetzel graduated with honors from SAIC with a BFA. The Institute awarded him a Foreign Travelling Fellowship, which he would later use to travel and study abroad.&lt;ref name=fellowship&gt;{{cite web |title=63rd Annual Exhibition of the Work of the Students of the Art Institute of Chicago |publisher=Art Institute of Chicago |url=http://www.artic.edu/sites/default/files/libraries/pubs/1968/AIC1968SAIC63rdAn_comb.pdf |accessdate=May 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from SAIC, he continued his studies at Northern Illinois University, earning an MA in 1969. In the fall of 1970, Richard and his wife, Janice, traveled throughout Europe for eight months on his fellowship, studying art and architecture. After returning to Chicago, they both assumed teaching positions in city and suburban art departments, where they continued teaching until retirement, Janice in the Chicago Public Schools, and Richard in Niles Township High Schools. They lived, worked, and traveled together until Janice's death in 2014.&lt;ref name=Janice&gt;{{cite web |last=Stevens |first=Anastacia |title=In Memory of Janice Wetzel |publisher=School of the Art Institute of Chicago |date=February 4, 2014 |url=http://my.saic.edu/news/159539/In-Memory-of-Janice-Wetzel.htm |accessdate=May 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Chicago Imagists==

The Chicago Imagists&lt;ref name=Wetzel/&gt; were a group of graduates and students of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, all in their 20s, who came to be regarded in the art world as “the Chicago vanguard.”&lt;ref name=Schultze69/&gt;  Their work was exhibited at the Hyde Park Art Center (HPAC) in nine exhibitions between 1966 and 1972. The nine shows at HPAC were aligned into three groups: ''The Hairy Who'', ''The Nonplussed Some'', and ''The False Image''.&lt;ref name=Baker/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schultze71&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schultze |first=Franz |title=Art News in Chicago |publisher=ARTnews |volume=70 |issue=7 |date=November 1971 |pages=45–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Peter&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schjeldahl |first=Peter |title=Letter from Chicago |journal=Art in America |volume=64 |issue=4 |date=July–August 1976 |pages=52–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Robin Dluzen, the Imagists were “mainly white but with an unusually large percentage of female members … 7 women amongst 11 men …”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dluzen |first=Robin |title=Chicago Then and Now: Hairy Who &amp; The Chicago Imagists |publisher=Articity |date=August 25, 2014 |url=http://artfcity.com/2014/08/26/chicago-then-and-now-hairy-who-the-chicago-imagists |accessdate=May 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These events were organized by Don Baum, exhibitions director at HPAC, and a participant in one of the nine shows.&lt;ref name=Shaw/&gt; Baum would later organize two exhibitions for the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago. The first of these, ''Don Baum Says Chicago Needs Famous Artists'', included works by Wetzel. The second show, ''Made in Chicago'', did not. ''Made in Chicago'' traveled on to the São Paulo Bienal in Brazil and also to the Smithsonian Museum in Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Don Baum: In Memoriam |publisher=Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago |url=http://www2.mcachicago.org/exhibition/don-baum-in-memoriam |accessdate=May 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Made in Chicago |publisher=Smithsonian |url=http://www.si.edu/Exhibitions/Details/Made-in-Chicago-5493 |accessdate=May 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Halstead |first=Whitney |title=Made in Chicago XII Bienal De São Paulo, U.S.A.

&lt;blockquote&gt;… funky and irreverent subject matter (often with sexual and/or violent overtones, with imaginative fantasies dealing with the figure under extreme physical or psychological stress), a predilection for narrative themes drawn from vernacular sources, a decided openness to influences from self-taught artists and from sources outside the mainstream of Western art history, a taste for garish and obsessively busy small-scale compositions driven by a concern for symmetry and a linear approach to the figure, surrealistic whimsy and ironic and caustic humor undercutting the “serious” status of the art object, high-keyed color, scrupulous and fastidious craftspersonship [sic] tending toward the suppression of evidence of the experiential residue of the artist's hand, and iconic independence and idiosyncratic mannerism of the most manic sort.&lt;ref name=Yood&gt;{{cite book |last=Yood |first=James |title=Jumpin' Backflash: Original Imagist Artwork, 1966–1969 |publisher=Northern Indiana Arts Association |year=1999 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Franz Schultze in ''ARTNews'' 1971 described a cliquishness in the various groups.

&lt;blockquote&gt;They cluster in small groups and—rather like the secret kids' clubs that flourished in the days of radio serials and the Sunday funnies—they even assume corporate names, like The Hairy Who ([Jim] Nutt, [Gladys] Nilsson, [Karl] Wirsum, Suellen Rocca, Art Green, James Falconer), The Nonplussed Some ([Ed] Flood, [Ed] Paschke, Sara Canright, Richard Wetzel, Don Baum), the False Image (Roger Brown, Phil Hanson, Christina Ramberg, Eleanor Dube).&lt;ref name=Schultze71/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In fact, as Schultze noted in 1969, Imagist artist Robert Guinan participated in the ''Nonplussed Some'' show but was later replaced by Don Baum in ''Nonplussed Some Some Mor''e.&lt;ref name=Schultze69/&gt; Shultze's omission of Guinan in 1971 points to a question of who is in the Imagist roster.

Alan Artner, ''Chicago Tribune'' art critic, commented on the 2000 Imagist show at the Chicago Cultural Center:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Some artists in “Jumpin' Backflash”—Robert Guinan, Richard Wetzel—didn't fit the developing definitions of the style and were passed by almost from the beginning …

… That few of the painters beyond Ed Paschke and Jim Nutt ever took their art further perhaps says something about Imagism and arrested development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Artner |first=Alan |title=`Jumpin' Backflash' Nourishes A Myth |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=February 3, 2000 |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2000-02-03/features/0002040022_1_chicago-cultural-center-museum-of-contemporary-art-artistic-experience |accessdate=May 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Peter Schjeldahl in ''Art in America'' observed that from the first HPAC exhibition in 1966 the alignments among the artists morphed almost continually.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The groups miscegenated briskly in a series of Hyde Park shows that, with themes and costumes, were also theatrical events: “Marriage Chicago Style,” for instance, solemnized the joining of members of the Who and the Some, plus Barbara Rossi.&lt;ref name=Peter/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

James Yood in 2000 observed, “Many of these artists did not feel at the time, nor do some admit today, that they are particularly linked to one another …”&lt;ref name=Yood/&gt; Wetzel's participation with the Imagists ended in 1970.

Wetzel did show his work in the 2000 group exhibition at the Chicago Cultural Center, ''Jumpin' Backflash: Original  Imagist Artwork, 1966–1969''.  This exhibit marked the first time that the works of all fifteen artists of the nine HPAC shows were included in one exhibition.&lt;ref name=Yood/&gt; Wetzel was quoted in the program notes for ''Jumpin' Backflash'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;… the current exhibit is the first time that ALL the “Imagist” artists have been included, in person or in print … it should present a rare opportunity to read the works instead of the words.&lt;ref name=Yood/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A documentary film about the Imagists was released in 2014, ''Hairy Who and the Chicago Imagists''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hairy Who and the Chicago Imagists |publisher=IMdB |accessdate=May 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1962, Wetzel has exhibited his work in both solo and group exhibitions. Sue Taylor in the ''Chicago Sun-Times'' observed in 1985 that

&lt;blockquote&gt;Like others associated with [The Chicago Imagists], now internationally renowned, Wetzel has intensified the individual aspects of his style in the 15 years since the inception of Imagism.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite news |last=Taylor |first=Sue |title=Wetzel's Icons Go to the Emotions |newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times |date=December 4, 1985 |page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wetzel continues to live and work in Chicago.

==From the critics==

Whitney Halstead, ''Artforum'', 1968

&lt;blockquote&gt;The juxtapositions typical of collage are blended to achieve a lyrical (and here, dreamlike) mood in Richard Wetzel's transfer images on glass. ''Black Eyed Susan's Circle'' typifies his achievement in synthesizing disparate elements in a quiet, understated tone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Halstead |first=Whitney |title=Chicago |journal=Artforum |volume=6 |issue=10 |date=Summer 1968 |pages=63–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Franz Schultze, ''Chicago Daily News'', 1968

&lt;blockquote&gt;Wetzel makes dreamy, low-key collages with ectoplasmic faces … &lt;ref name="Schultze68"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Harold Haydon, ''Chicago Sun-Times'', 1969

&lt;blockquote&gt;… Wetzel's large and ingenious photo collages … &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Haydon |first=Harold |title=They Arrived Too Late for the Revolution |newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times |date=March 2, 1969 |page=section 3, page 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Franz Schultze, ''Chicago Daily News'', 1969

&lt;blockquote&gt;… Wetzel's complicated surrealist symbolism …&lt;ref name=Schultze69/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Harold Haydon, ''Chicago Sun-Times'', 1975

&lt;blockquote&gt;With precision and subtlety, [Wetzel] draws organic and vegetable forms at about the scale of cabbages and squashes, while emphasizing the prehensile aspect of vegetation. Tendrils and claws reach out to grapple in these imagined encounters in the land of chlorophyll. Just as vegetable claws resemble beatle [sic] and crab pincers in Wetzel's drawings, so flying seeds acquire monarch-butterfly and other insect wings. These drawings transmit the essence of a quiet, desperate struggle from existence.&lt;ref name=Haydon75&gt;{{cite news |last=Haydon |first=Harold |title=The Master Caster Is Able Sculptor |newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times |date=March 20, 1975 |page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Harold Haydon, ''Chicago Sun-Times'', 1981

&lt;blockquote&gt;Rapacious flowers and other vegetation, painted large—as if from an insect's point of view—loom large against dark pastoral landscapes in Richard D. Wetzel's exhibition … &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In Wetzel's world, precisely painted plants, fierce in fang and claw, can be as prosaic as green beans or as fantastic as root systems. Their victims usually are eggs, whose fate is to be seized and devoured. Only one escapes, in the painting titled “Deliverance,” borne aloft by a monarch butterfly and by its coloration, obviously an egg of the monarch clan. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If all this imagery is taken as a paradigm of earthly existence, Wetzel's view must be quite on the mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Haydon |first=Harold |title=Johns Takes a Fresh View of the Object as Subject |newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times |date=January 2, 1981 |page=Weekender, page 61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jeff Abell, ''New Art Examiner'', 1984

&lt;blockquote&gt;The paintings make use of intensely bright colors, most often to delineate shapes against the generally darker background colors. For example, a strange claw-like shape is outlined in a very hot yellow-orange against a purple background, so that the figure glows against its ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Abell |first=Jeff |title=Richard Wetzel |magazine=New Art Examiner |date=December 1983 |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sue Taylor, ''Chicago Sun-Times'', 1985

&lt;blockquote&gt;… the brilliant radiating colors and mysterious, iconic images that have long distinguished Wetzel's art are still his major concerns. Each image is set against a monochromatic background of the deepest blue, purple or green, which may be read as an infinite spatial recession, indicative of the vague realm of imagination.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sue Taylor, ''Chicago Sun-Times'', 1985

&lt;blockquote&gt;What is unique about his current paintings is their powerfully emotive quality, for they operate largely on the level of feeling. The forms he uses, for all their rich ambiguity, are direct, simplified, and distilled, and their suggestiveness is of a kind everyone can understand—intuitively …&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

David McCracken, ''Chicago Tribune'', 1985

&lt;blockquote&gt;… Zaks is showing paintings by Richard Wetzel, work very much in the Chicago School tradition: hard-edged forms at once organic and artificial—they reminded me, oddly, of electron photomicrography—in eerie, strangely erotic colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McCracken |first=David |title=Galleries Still Alive, Well on Michigan Ave |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=December 20, 1985 |page=section 7, page 74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

G. Jurek Polanski, ''Jumpin' Backflash: Original Imagist Artwork, 1966–1969'', 2000

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are images which linger long after viewing. A prime example is ''Death-Breath'', a 1966 serigraph on paper among the works by Richard Wetzel. Both in spirit and execution, it implies affinities with such German expressionists as Georg Grosz, but for Wetzel, allied with the “Nonplussed Some,” Vietnam, not Dachau, more likely supplied the inspirational matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=JUMPIN' BACKFLASH: Original Imagist Artwork, 1966 - 1969 |publisher=ArtScope |url=http://www.artscope.net/VAREVIEWS/CHGOimagists.shtml  |accessdate=May 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Show Me!''''' is a [[sex education]] book by photographer [[Will McBride (photographer)|Will McBride]]. It appeared in 1974 in German under the title ''Zeig Mal!'', written with [[psychiatrist]] Helga Fleischhauer-Hardt for children and their parents. It was translated into English a year later and was widely available in bookstores on both sides of the Atlantic for many years, but later became subject to expanded [[child pornography]] laws in jurisdictions including the United States. In Germany, the book was followed in 1990 by a second edition that included, among other additions, a discussion of the [[AIDS]] epidemic.

==Publication history==
While many parents appreciated ''Show Me!'' for its frank depiction of pre-adolescents discovering and exploring their [[Child sexuality|sexuality]], others called it [[child pornography]]. In 1975 and 1976, [[obscenity]] charges were brought against the publisher by prosecutors in [[Massachusetts]], [[New Hampshire]], [[Oklahoma]], and [[Toronto, Ontario]], Canada. In all four cases, the judges ruled as a matter of law that the title was not [[obscene]].

However, starting in 1977, some states began to criminalize the distribution of even ''non-obscene'' so-called "child pornography," or "images of abuse," which arguably is not protected by [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|the First Amendment.]] [[New York (state)|New York]] State, home of the publisher, [[St. Martin's Press]], criminalized the distribution of non-obscene "child pornography" in 1977, but the publisher promptly went to court and obtained an [[injunction]] against the State.  The court granted the injunction because the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] was interpreted to permit the banning of only obscene material.

In 1982, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] issued a decision, ''[[New York v. Ferber]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=458&amp;invol=747 New York v. Ferber], Findlaw.com&lt;/ref&gt; which allowed the government to constitutionally ban the knowing distribution of even non-obscene "child pornography". Citing a [[Chilling effect (term)|chilling effect]], St. Martin's Press then pulled the book, stating that though they believed  ''Show Me!'' was not [[pornographic]], they could no longer afford the legal expenses to defend it, and they did not want to risk criminal prosecutions of their own personnel and/or vendors who sold the book.    The Court overruled a decision of the [[New York Court of Appeals]], ''The People  v. Paul Ira Ferber''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15562951158866016402], which held that  [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|the First Amendment]] protected the dissemination of non-obscene sexual depictions. ''Show Me!'' was not the direct subject of the ''Ferber'' case, but the book was prominently featured by both sides in the litigation, and it played a significant role in the [[oral argument]] before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.oyez.org/cases/1980-1989/1981/1981_81_55/argument/ Oral argument] at Oyez.org. Accessed 23 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In its country of origin, Germany, the book first won several awards, even from church organisations, but due to rising pressure from a newly arising "moral majority" the publishers and McBride decided to take it off the market in 1996. By then over one million copies in seven languages had been sold. It was never officially banned in Germany. Public libraries there keep it on hand and out of print copies are openly sold at collectors' premium prices.

In New Zealand the book was banned by the [[Indecent Publications Tribunal]] in 1976. The ban was upheld in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Zealand Censorship Database|url=http://www.censorship.govt.nz/DDA/Pages/Screens/DDA/WelcomePage.aspx|publisher=Office of Film &amp; Literature Classification. 1976 Publication No. IPT 76-860.  1996 Publication No. 9400964|accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
''Show Me!'' received mixed reviews from the mass media when it was first published. The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called the photographs "beautiful...graceful, charming, and elegant," yet accurately predicted, in a severe understatement of what actually happened, that the book "may start (an) uproar."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/656022932.html?dids=656022932:656022932&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Mar+9%2C+1975&amp;author=ROBERT+A+JONES&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(1886-Current+File)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=F6&amp;desc=IS+AMERICA+READY%3F Is America Ready?]", ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', March 9, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'', on the other hand, described the photographs as "beautiful, assaultive, grotesque, and seductive," and concluded that ''Show Me!'' was only suited for "avant garde" parents.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/120123914.html?dids=120123914:120123914&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;fmac=&amp;date=May+4%2C+1975&amp;author=By+T.+BERRY+BRAZELTON&amp;desc=Kiss+the+Stork+Goodbye "Kiss the Stork Goodbye]," ''[[Washington Post]]'' May 5, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewer Linda Wolfe was more hostile in the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'', calling the book a "child-abusive joke."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/1975/07/13/archives/the-birds-and-the-bees-were-never-like-this-show-me.html The birds and the bees were never like this]", ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' July 13, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; The 13-year-old daughter of [[Chicago Tribune]] reviewer Carol Kleiman commented:

::"I'm too old for it myself. The last part, though, with no pictures, looks interesting to read. The book is good for little kids because they don't know what society terms 'dirty' yet. You know, Mom, it's PARENTS I'm worried about. '''''They're''''' not ready yet."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/639825622.html?dids=639825622:639825622&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Jul+5%2C+1975&amp;author=Carol+Kleiman&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune+(1963-Current+file)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=S11&amp;desc=New+sex+ed%3A+All+kids+ever+wanted+to+know...and+how!  New sex ed: All kids ever wanted to know...and how!]", ''Chicago Tribune'', July 5, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent reviews===
A 2005 Amazon review by Dr. [[Russell A. Rohde]] claims that the book, "appropriately delves into the issues of breast feeding, adolescence, pubertal changes, menses, sexual anatomies, pregnancy, masturbation, contraception, sexual behavioral disturbances and venereal disease. [...] I am not aware of any book comparable to this illustrated primer that fills the needs of sexual education so well."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.ca/Show-Me-Picture-Children-Parents/dp/0312722753|author=Russell A. Rohde MD|quote=5.0 out of 5 stars|title="Show Me!"...unique, explicit &amp; sadly controversial...|date=February 17, 2005|publisher=Amazon.com}} &lt;/ref&gt;

[[D. F. Janssen]] places it at the one extreme of a late 20th-century visual and textual revolution that enabled parents to illustrate information that up to that time had been transmitted orally. He sees the work as subversive not for its "too frank" portrayal of childhood sexuality, but instead for the primacy that the image takes over the text. In his eyes, the work "comes out of a culture with a long history of pathologising so-addressed '[[primal scene]]s,'" a history that became manifest in particular with regard to the works of Will McBride.&lt;ref&gt;D. F. Janssen, ''[http://www2.rz.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/GUS/GUSVOLIICH18.HTM#_Toc70961575 Growing Up Sexually. Volume II: The Sexual Curriculum: The Manufacture and Performance of Pre-Adult Sexualities]'' (October 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is also analyzed in an article on "Picturing Sex Education" (Discourse Volume 27, Number 4 / December 2006).

==Plot==
Jordan ([[Marcello Mastroianni]]) runs a struggling cinema called Splendor in a small town in Italy. Low ticket sales mean that the cinema is no longer a viable business, and Jordan reflects back on his experiences running Splendor, from his arrival in the town as a child with his father. He meets French showgirl Chantal ([[Marina Vlady]]) at one of her performances, and she comes to work for him as an usher. Cinephile Luigi ([[Massimo Troisi]]) repeatedly attends screenings of ''[[Il Sorpasso]]'' in order to see Chantal, with whom he is besotted, and after a brief fling he begins working for Jordan as the projectionist. Attendance at the cinema decreases with the rise of television and Jordan considers bringing in strippers to try and solve his financial problems. Throughout, we see clips of the films shown at the cinema: ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'', ''[[It’s a Wonderful Life]]'', ''[[La Grande Guerra]]'', ''[[Amarcord]]'', amongst others.

'''''The Five Thousand Dictionary: A Chinese-English Dictionary…''''' (1926) or '''''Fenn's Chinese-English Pocket-Dictionary''''' (1942), which was compiled by American missionary [[Courtenay Hughes Fenn|Courtenay H. Fenn]], is a widely reprinted learners' [[Chinese dictionary|dictionary]] that selected [[Chinese character]] entries on the basis of common usage. It was the first Chinese-English dictionary to indicate the [[Standard Chinese phonology#Neutral tone|neutral tone]] associated with [[Standard Chinese phonology#Full and weak syllables|weak syllables]].

==History==
Courtenay Hughes Fenn, more commonly known as Courtenay H. Fenn or C. H. Fenn, (1886-1953) was a missionary under the [[Presbyterian World Mission|Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions]] in China from 1893 to 1925 (Shavit 1990: 162). 

Fenn's dictionary was originally intended to be an index of the 5,000 character [[flashcards]] used by the North China Union Language School, in the California College in China (later incorporated into [[Claremont Colleges]]), Beijing. After compiling the indexing information, Fenn decided to create a [[pocket dictionary]] for students of [[Chinese as a foreign language]], and was assisted by Chin Hsien-Tseng. Courtenay H. Fenn's foreword expresses his satisfaction in giving the public a dictionary "the lack of which he has personally felt keenly for the more than thirty years of his sojourn in 'The Land of Sinim'" (1942: iv), using the Biblical name ''[[Sinim]]'' (Hebrew for "inhabitants of the land of sin") that some scholars associate with Greek ''[[Names of China#Sinae.2C_Sin|Sinae]]'' "China".

Limiting a Chinese learners' dictionary to 5,000 characters is linguistically sound. Statistical studies of Chinese character usage have shown that an average college-educated Chinese person who is not a specialist in classical literature or history has an active vocabulary of between 3,000 and 4,000 characters (Norman 1988: 73).  Fenn's dictionary was preceded by [[William Edward Soothill]]'s ''The Student's Four Thousand Tzu and General Pocket Dictionary'' (1900), and Fenn's colleague Hsien-Tseng Chin later compiled ''The Three Thousand Dictionary of the Chinese Script'' (1941).

The title of Fenn's dictionary changed through reprinting (Dunn 1977: 79).
*''The Five Thousand Dictionary: A Chinese-English Dictionary and Index to the Character Cards of the College of Chinese Studies, California College in China'' (1926)
*''Fenn's Chinese-English Pocket-Dictionary'' (1942)
*''Chinese-English Pocket-Dictionary'' (1944)
*''The Five Thousand Dictionary: Chinese-English'' (1973)

The first edition of '''''The Five Thousand Dictionary: A Chinese-English Dictionary and Index to the Character Cards of the College of Chinese Studies, California College in China''''' was printed in 1926 by the Mission Book Company in Shanghai. Demand for this dictionary was ongoing and four subsequent editions were printed. The second (1928), third (1932, introduction by W. B. Pettus), and fourth editions (1936, J. D. Hayes) were unchanged reprints. The fifth edition (1940) was a revision by Chin Hsien-Tseng, who had assisted Fenn with the original edition, and [[Twain–Ament indemnities controversy#George D. Wilder|George D. Wilder]] from the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]]. Their preface explains the addition of 150 new phrases, deletion of a few obsolete ones, correction of some errors, and inclusion of two tables: "Chinese Ordinals" and "Standard Methods of Showing Pronunciations, including tones" (Fenn 1942: vii). The first edition of Fenn's dictionary has 578 pages, and the fifth edition has 697 (Yang 1985: 288).

The revised American edition '''''Fenn's Chinese-English Pocket-Dictionary''''' was published by [[Harvard University Press]] in 1942. At the beginning of World War II, the shortage of Chinese and Japanese dictionaries became an urgent matter for English-speaking [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. The [[Harvard–Yenching Institute]] said the need for Chinese dictionaries in America had "grown from chronic to acute", and selected Fenn's ''The Five Thousand Dictionary'' (fifth ed., 1940) and ''[[A Chinese-English Dictionary: Compiled for the China Inland Mission by R. H. Mathews]]'' (1931) as two "practical dictionaries" to revise and reprint—without the authors' permission—for "the immediate demands of American students" (Mathews 1943: v). Both [[photolithographic]] reproductions were retitled: ''The Five Thousand Dictionary'' became ''Fenn's Chinese-English Pocket-Dictionary'' (1942) and ''A Chinese-English Dictionary: Compiled for the China Inland Mission by R. H. Mathews'' became ''Mathews' Chinese-English Dictionary'' (1943). 

In response to the "urgent need" for publishing the revised Harvard edition, Fenn's dictionary was basically left unchanged (Fenn 1942: i). Aside from some minor corrections and [[neologisms|additions]], the Chinese-American linguist [[Yuen Ren Chao]] significantly revised the dictionary's introduction on standards of pronunciation, and marked the [[Standard Chinese phonology#Neutral tone|neutral tone]] with dots—the first Chinese-English dictionary to make this phonological distinction. Harvard University Press changed the original title ''Fenn's Chinese-English Pocket-Dictionary'' (1942) to '''''Chinese-English Pocket-Dictionary''''' (1944) for the [[hardcover]] edition, and then to '''''The Five Thousand Dictionary: Chinese-English''''' (1973), also in paperback with a redesigned cover that added the characters [[wikt:字典|字典]] (''zidian'' "character dictionary"). Harvard University Press continued reprinting Fenn's and Mathews' popular Chinese-English dictionaries after the war. By 1984, Fenn's dictionary had sold 34,500 [[hardcover]] copies and 18,300 [[paperback]] copies (Hall: 1986: 84).

==Content==
Fenn's ''Five Thousand Dictionary'' comprises 5,000 [[headword|head characters]] and about 13,000 usage examples of words (Dunn 1997: 79). The overall [[collation]] is by [[Wade-Giles Romanization]], which Fenn says is "not because it is ideal, but simply because its recognition is most nearly universal" (1942: iv).

Each dictionary page has six columns (Fenn 1942: iv-v). The 1st column of each entry gives the head character, with any [[variant Chinese characters]] underneath linked by a line at the left, and the [[Standard Chinese]] tone indicated by a superscript &lt;sup&gt;1-4&lt;/sup&gt; on the character for the [[Standard Chinese phonology#Tonal categories|4 tonal categories]] and a dot before it for the unstressed neutral tone (for example, [[s.v.]] ''nü''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, "|⋅兒 a girl" for  ''nǚ'ér'' ([[wikt:女兒|女兒]] "daughter; girl") (1942: 369)). Most Chinese characters are classified as [[Chinese character classification#Phono-semantic compound characters|radical-phonetic characters]] that combine a semantically indicative "[[Radical (Chinese characters)|radical]]" with a phonologically indicative "[[Phonetic complement|phonetic]]". The 2nd column gives the head character's radical with its number in the [[Kangxi radical|214 Kangxi radicals]], and the 3rd gives the phonetic with its number in [[William Edward Soothill|Soothill]]'s dictionary (1900). The 4th column gives English translation equivalents for the character, common words written with it (abbreviated as "|" [[vertical bar]]), and indicates whether the character pronunciation is colloquial ([[wikt:俗|俗]]) or literary ([[wikt:文|文]]), and whether it is used as a [[Chinese classifier|Classifier]] (C) or as a [[Chinese surname|Surname]] (S). The 5th column gives alternate readings of the character, under which the user may find further information. The 6th column roughly indicates how frequently the character is used in Chinese, using the North China Union Language School's arrangement of the 5,000 character flashcards in ten groups of 500 each, lettered from A to K, with A for the 500 most commonly used characters and K for the 500 least commonly used.

The Chinese character [[wikt:道|道]] (composed of [[radical 162]] [[wikt:辵|辵]] or [[wikt:辶|辶]] "walk" and a ''shǒu'' [[wikt:首|首]] "head" phonetic) for ''dào'' "way; path; say; the [[Tao|Dao]]" or ''dǎo'' "guide; lead; conduct; instruct; direct" makes a good sample entry for illustrating a dictionary because it has two pronunciations and complex semantics. Fenn's dictionary enters this character under both ''Tao'' pronunciations (1942: 501, 502). The primary ''dào'' entry gives "道&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; | 辵 radical 162 | 首 phonetic 855 | Road, way, passage; zone; doctrine; officer; to say | ''tao&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'' | A"—indicating the 4th "high falling" tone pronunciation, radical, phonetic, translations, alternate ''dǎo'' pronunciation, and group A of 500 most commonly used characters—and 15 usage examples, including "|教 doctrine of Taoism" for ''Dàojiào'' ([[wikt:道教|道教]] "[[Daoism]] (as a religion)") and "|理 right principles, doctrine" for ''dàoli'' ([[wikt:道理|道理]] "reason; rationality; the right way; principle; truth"). The cross-referenced ''dǎo'' entry gives "道&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; | 辵 radical 162 | 首 phonetic 855 | 過|兒 Narrow passage | ''tao&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'' | A"—indicating the 3rd "low dipping" tone, same radical and phonetic, a ''guòdàor'' or (Beijing pronunciation) ''guòdǎor'' ([[wikt:過道兒|過道兒]] "passageway; corridor") usage example, alternate ''dào''pronunciation, and same usage frequency group A.

'''''The Inner Reaches of Outer Space''''' is a 1986 book by [[mythologist]] [[Joseph Campbell]], the last book completed before his death in 1987. In it, he explores the intersections of art, psychology and religion, and discusses the ways in which new myths are born. In writing the book, Campbell drew on transcripts of a series of lectures and conversations that he gave in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] between 1981–1984,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Inner Reaches of Outer Space|last=Campbell|first=Joseph|publisher=New World Library|year=2002|isbn=9781577312093|location=Novato, California|pages=xi|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; including legendary symposiums with astronaut [[Rusty Schweickart]] and with members of the [[Grateful Dead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Hero's Journey: Joseph Campbell on His Life and Work|last=Campbell|first=Joseph|publisher=New World Library|year=2003|isbn=978-1577314042|location=Novato, California|pages=xxii, xxxi, 180|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally published by [[Alfred van der Mark]] in 1986, the book was rereleased by [[Harper &amp; Row]] in 1988. With the publication of the third edition by [[New World Library]] in 2002, ''The Inner Reaches of Outer Space'' became the second title in the [[Joseph Campbell Foundation]]'s ''[[Collected Works of Joseph Campbell]]'' series.

'''''The Reckoning of Time''''' ({{lang-la|De temporum ratione}}) is an [[Anglo-Saxon|Anglo-Saxon era]] [[treatise]] written in [[Medieval Latin]] by the [[Northumbrian]] monk [[Bede]] in 725. The treatise includes an introduction to the traditional ancient and medieval view of the cosmos, including an explanation of how the spherical Earth influenced the changing length of daylight, of how the seasonal motion of the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]] influenced the changing appearance of the [[new moon]] at evening twilight, and a quantitative relation between the changes of the tides at a given place and the daily motion of the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;Wallis (2004:82–85;307–312).&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Reckoning of Time'' describes a variety of ancient calendars, including the [[Germanic calendar|Anglo-Saxon calendar]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nabkal.de/beda/beda_15.html Chapter XV, De mensibus Anglorum.]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Julian calendar]].&lt;ref&gt;Wallis (2004:82–85;307–312).&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of ''{{lang|la|De temporum ratione}}'' was calculation of the date of Easter, for which Bede described the method developed by [[Dionysius Exiguus#Easter tables|Dionysius Exiguus]]. ''{{lang|la|De temporum ratione}}'' also gave instructions for calculating the date of the Easter [[full moon]], for calculating the motion of the Sun and Moon through the [[zodiac]], and for many other calculations related to the calendar.

Bede based his reasoning for the dates on the [[Hebrew Bible]]. The functions of the universe and its purpose are generally referenced by scripture. According to the introduction by [[Faith Wallis]] in the 1999 English translated edition of ''The Reckoning of Time'', Bede aimed to write a Christian work that integrated the astronomical understanding of computing with a theological context of history. The book is also regarded by Bede to be a sequel to his works ''The Nature of Things'' and ''On Time''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wallis |first=Faith |title=Bede: The Reckoning of Time |year=1999 |publisher=Liverpool University Press |isbn=0853236933 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sections==
The work is divided into six sections:

===1. Technical preparation (Chapters 1–4)===
This section familiarizes the reader with terminology regarding measurements.

In chapter 3 Bede defines a day as being 12 hours long. An hour consists of increments of ''{{lang|la|puncti}}'', ''{{lang|la|partes}}'' and ''{{lang|la|mementa}}''. Each of which are small increments of time within the hour. The smallest increment of time is the atom.

===2. The Julian calendar (Chapters 5–41)===
Here, Bede gives an exhaustive overview of the date of the Earth's creation, the months, the weeks and the Moon.

He argues that the first day did not, as it was generally believed, take place at the time of an equinox. According to the religious accounts of God's creation of the universe, light was created on the first day. It wasn't until the fourth day, however, that God created the stars and therefore there was no measurement of hours.

Much of this section is devoted to the Moon. Bede goes into extensive detail about measuring the moon's cycles, the Moon's relationship to the Earth and Sun. Bede discusses the Moon's relationship to the tide and calculating ''{{lang|la|kalends}}''.

===3. Anomalies of lunar reckoning (Chapters 42–43)===
These two chapters pick up where the previous section left off on examining the irregularities of the Moon creating a leap year as well as why, according to Bede, the Moon appears older than it actually is.

===4. The Paschal table (Chapters 44–65)===
This section explores different year cycles that include varying numbers of months and days, determining the year cycle of Christ's incarnation, Easter, and other moon cycles.

===5. The Minor Chronicle (Chapter 66)===
Bede gives an exhaustive description of the Six Ages of the World.

Bede details the First Age, from Adam to Noah, as being 1,656&amp;nbsp;years long according to the Hebrew Bible or 2,242&amp;nbsp;years according to the Septuagint.

The Second Age, from Noah to Abraham, is 292&amp;nbsp;years or 272&amp;nbsp;years long based on Bede's evaluation of the Hebrew Bible and Septuagint respectively.

The Third Age is said to be 942&amp;nbsp;years long according to both the Hebrew Bible and Septuagint spanning from the Abraham to David.

The Fourth age is from David until the Babylonian exile. This is 473&amp;nbsp;years according to the Hebrew Bible or 485 according to the Septuagint.

The Fifth age is from the Babylonian exile to the advent of Christ.

The Sixth age is the current age lasting from the advent of Christ until the end of days.

===6. Prophecy (Chapters 67–71)===
Finally, Bede goes on to discuss the end of the Sixth Age, discusses the second coming of Christ, the Antichrist, Judgement Day, and the Seventh and Eighth ages of the world to come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wallis |first=Faith |title=Bede: The Reckoning of Time |year=1999 |publisher=Liverpool University Press |isbn=0853236933 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Theresienstadt. Ein Dokumentarfilm aus dem jüdischen Siedlungsgebiet''''' ("Theresienstadt: A Documentary Film from the Jewish Settlement Area"), unofficially '''''Der Führer schenkt den Juden eine Stadt''''' ("The Führer Gives a City to the Jews"), was a black-and-white projected [[Nazi propaganda]] film. It was directed by the German Jewish prisoner [[Kurt Gerron]] and the Czech filmmaker [[Karel Pečený]] under close [[SS]] supervision in [[Theresienstadt concentration camp]], and edited by Pečený's company, Aktualita. Filmed mostly in the fall of 1944, it was completed on 28 March 1945 and screened privately four times. After the war, the film was lost but about twenty minutes of footage was later rediscovered in various archives.

Unlike other [[Nazism and cinema|Nazi propaganda films]], which were under the control of [[Joseph Goebbels]]' [[Reich Ministry of Propaganda|Ministry of Propaganda]], ''Theresienstadt'' was conceived and paid for by the Jewish Affairs department of the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]], at the initiative of [[Hans Günther (SS officer)|Hans Günther]]. The film, which displayed supposedly happy and healthy Jews, was part of a larger Nazi program to use Theresienstadt as a tool to discredit reports of the genocide of Jews reaching the Western Allies and neutral countries. However, it was not widely distributed and did not have the opportunity to influence public opinion. Today, ''Theresienstadt'' is considered one of the most disturbing Nazi propaganda films.
{{TOC limit|2}}

==Background==
{{further|Theresienstadt concentration camp|Theresienstadt (1942 film)|Red Cross visit to Theresienstadt}}
[[Theresienstadt]] was a [[Nazi concentration camp]] in the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]]—the [[German-occupied Czechoslovakia|German-occupied]] [[Czech lands]]—built inside a repurposed fortified town, [[Terezín]].{{sfn|United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|2018|loc=Establishment}} Between 1941 and 1945, some 140,000 Jews were transported to the camp. Before the war, it housed about 7,000 people; during the camp's existence, the average population was about 45,000. About 33,000 died at Theresienstadt and almost 90,000 were deported to [[Nazi ghettos|ghettos]], [[extermination camps]], and other killing centers, where they faced almost certain death.{{sfn|United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|2018|loc=Overview, "Retirement Settlement"}}

In 1942, a [[Theresienstadt (1942 film)|Nazi propaganda film]] was filmed at Theresienstadt. Unlike other Nazi propaganda films, the initiative came from [[Hans Günther (SS officer)|Hans Günther]], director of the [[SS Central Office for the Settlement of the Jewish Question in Bohemia and Moravia]], a section of the [[Reich Main Security Office]], rather than the [[Reich Ministry of Propaganda]] of [[Joseph Goebbels]].{{sfn|España|2001|p=152}} This was the result of a power struggle between ''[[Reichsprotektor]]'' [[Reinhard Heydrich]] and Goebbels; Heydrich won the concession that all propaganda produced in the Protectorate would be run through a special office in the Protectorate administration.{{sfn|Margry|1992|p=147}} The film was probably written by {{ill|Irena Dodalová|de||fr}}, a Czech Jewish prisoner who had run a film studio in Prague with her husband before the war.{{sfn|Margry|1999|pp=315-316}}{{sfn|España|2001|p=152}} Little is known about it, since it is little mentioned in the memoirs and testimonies of Theresienstadt survivors, and was only rediscovered in fragmentary form in 1994.{{sfn|Margry|1999|pp=309}}{{sfn|España|2001|p=152}}

In an attempt to preserve its credibility and preeminence as a humanitarian organization while reports on the mass extermination of Jews continued to reach the Western Allies, the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) requested to visit [[Theresienstadt concentration camp]] in November 1943.{{sfn|Farré|Schubert|2009|pp=69–70}} On 23 June 1944, [[Maurice Rossel]], an ICRC delegate, and two Danish officials went on a tour of Theresienstadt. In preparation for the visit, the Germans "beautified" and cleaned the camp prior to arrival and arranged cultural activities to give the appearance of a happy, industrious community. To cover up the endemic overpopulation of the camp, thousands of people were [[Theresienstadt family camp|deported]] to [[Auschwitz]] before the arrival of the Red Cross delegation. In his report, Rossel claimed that Jews were treated well and not deported from Theresienstadt.{{sfn|Stránský|2011}}{{efn|However, the Red Cross had access to independent information that Jews were being deported from Theresienstadt to Auschwitz, and murdered there.{{sfn|Fleming|2014|pp=199, 214–216}}}} Rossel gave copies of photographs he took during the visit to the [[Federal Foreign Office|German Foreign Ministry]], which used them to claim that Jews were treated well under Nazi rule.{{sfn|Schur|1997}}

==Filming==
[[File:Shooting_%27Film_Ghetto_Theresienstadt%27.jpg|thumb|left|Shooting the film]]
Preparations for a second Theresienstadt film, again sponsored by Günther rather than Goebbels, began concurrently with the "beautification" of the ghetto prior to the Red Cross visit.{{sfn|España|2001|p=153}} Günther's Central Office, which was funded by stolen Jewish property, paid a Czech company, Aktualita, 350,000 [[Czech koruna]] (35,000 [[Reichsmarks]]) to produce the film.{{sfn|Margry|1992|p=148}} In December 1943, a prisoner, probably Jindřich Weil, was ordered to write a script, and he finished two drafts by March.{{sfn|España|2001|p=153}}{{sfn|Margry|2016}}{{efn|The papers, which are neither signed nor dated, were found after the war in the archive of Jindřich Weil (1916–1945), a German-speaking Jew from Prague. Before the war, he had worked as a cameraman and scriptwriter at a film studio, and he had collaborated with Dodalová on the 1942 film. Both drafts contain words and phrases characteristic of Theresienstadt prisoners and of the German-speaking Jewish community in Prague. The last draft included much more narration than is typical in films and was written in bland Nazi official language uncharacteristic of Weil's prior work. Karel Margry hypothesizes that Rahm had a strong influence on this draft. Based on references to events in the scripts, Margry was able to date each draft to a close time interval: the first was written between the end of December and before 14 January, while the second dates to between 26 February and the end of March. Weil's involvement with the film ended with the completion of the second draft.{{sfn|Margry|2016}}}} On 20 January 1944, the Nazis filmed the arrival of a transport of [[Danish Jews]] and a welcome speech by {{ill|Paul Eppstein|de}}, with a view of including it in a later film.{{sfn|Margry|1992|p=152}}{{sfn|Strusková|2016}}{{sfn|Margry|2016}} There was no effort to complete the film before the Red Cross visit and screen it to the guests.{{sfn|España|2001|p=153}} Karel Margry, a Dutch historian who has studied the Theresienstadt propaganda films, argues that the "beautification" efforts had a higher priority, and that the propaganda would be more effective if filmed after the ghetto had been beautified.{{sfn|Margry|1992|p=152}} 

[[Kurt Gerron]], a leading [[German Jewish]] actor and director, had fled to the Netherlands and was deported from [[Westerbork transit camp|Westerbork]] to Theresienstadt in February 1944.{{sfn|España|2001|p=153}} In July, the film project was revived and Gerron was ordered to write a script, which was used in the film. While the script has traditionally been credited to Gerron, it closely adhered to Weil's draft and the dictates of the SS; his creative role was minimal. Although he is usually credited with directorship of the film, Gerron's role in the filming was more symbolic than substantial, according to Spanish film historian Rafael de España. Eyewitnesses report that Gerron was constantly urging Jews to behave as mirthfully as the Germans wished and organizing mass scenes. However, SS men oversaw the filming, and Rahm and even Günther supervised scenes. When Rahm was not present on set, Gerron had to send him detailed reports.{{sfn|España|2001|pp=153-154}}{{sfn|Margry|1992|p=152}} 

[[File:Film and Reality.jpg|thumb|[[Bedřich Fritta]]'s caricature of the filming]]

The film was shot in eleven days between 16 August and 11 September 1944.{{sfn|Margry|2016}} The assistant directors were [[František Zelenka]], [[Jo Spier]], and {{ill|Hans Hofer|cs||de||fr}}.{{sfn|Drubek|2016}}{{sfn|Adler|2017|p=148}}{{sfn|filmportal.de|2018}} Karel Pečený and his company Aktualita provided the cameramen, and halfway through filming, Pečený effectively took over as director.{{sfn|Margry|1992|p=153}} The two cameramen were Ivan Frič and Čeněk Zahradníček, assisted by Benda Rosenwein. The film's soundtrack has been credited to Jaroslav Sechura and Josef Francek.{{sfn|filmportal.de|2018}} Aktualita collaborated with the German newsreel company [[Favoritfilm]] in producing the film.{{sfn|Strusková|2016}} Prisoners of stereotypically Jewish appearance who were not obviously malnourished were chosen to appear in the film. They were given time off work for rehearsals and filming, and those unwilling to appear were threatened with harsh punishment.{{sfn|Adler|2017|p=148}}

On 28 October, Gerron was deported to Auschwitz, where he was murdered, never seeing even a preliminary version of the film. The film was cut by Ivan Frič, who did not use Gerron's proposals for cutting or any of the scripts, but instead using the same improvised technique that he used for Aktualita's weekly newsreels. Frič had to cut the ending three times before Günther accepted it. The final cut bore little resemblance to Gerron's July script, his later editing proposal, or his creative vision for the film. In March, Aktualita sent a crew to the camp in order to collect some samples of "Jewish music", including snippets of the work of [[Felix Mendelssohn]], [[Jacques Offenbach]], and the children's opera ''[[Brundibár]]'' by Theresienstadt prisoner [[Hans Krása]]. The music was performed under the direction of Danish Jewish composer [[Peter Deutsch (composer)|Peter Deutsch]], who had experience with film soundtracks before the war. The SS completed the film on 28 March 1945, in time to present to the ICRC delegation that arrived on 6 April 1945.{{sfn|España|2001|p=154}}{{sfn|Margry|1992|pp=153-154}}

==Content==
{{quotebox|align=left|width=25em|...the film's blatant dishonesty turns on what it did ''not'' show: the hunger, the misery, the overcrowding, the slave work for the German war economy, the high death rate, and, most of all, the transports leaving for the East.|source=Karel Margry{{sfn|Margry|1992|p=155}}}}

Testimonies agree that the film ran about 90 minutes, the standard length.{{sfn|España|2001|p=154}} Survivors remember what was filmed, but not which scenes were used in the final version. Although the full film was lost, a surviving document from the editing stage lists all the sequences as they appeared in the final version,{{sfn|Margry|1992|p=155}} and from surviving fragments and the drawings of Jo Spier, historians have "a very good idea of the visual image of virtually every scene in the film's 38 sequences", according to Margry. Nothing survives of a scene showing the self-government's court and a different scene in a dining hall.{{sfn|Margry|1992|p=156}}{{sfn|España|2001|p=156}}

The film opens with the children's choir, directed by [[Karel Fischer]], singing Mendolssohn's oratorio, ''[[Elijah (oratorio)|Elijah]]''. The [[Ghetto Swingers]], a jazz band, plays outside, and "Prominent" prisoners enjoy food and beverages on a terrace and in a sham coffee house. Various sports events are also performed. The first eight sequences of the film show only leisure activities, setting the tone for the rest of the film and casting Theresienstadt as a holiday resort.{{sfn|Margry|1992|p=156}}{{sfn|España|2001|pp=154-155}} Later sections of the film focus on work, including the Jewish self-government, construction projects, craft workshops, and agriculture. [[H. G. Adler]] notes that the type of work depicted in the film was not typical of that performed by most prisoners. Fake institutions, such as a bank and various shops, also are shown. Theresienstadt medical care, including a hospital and recuperation home, makes an appearance.{{sfn|Margry|1992|p=157}}{{sfn|España|2001|p=155}}{{sfn|Adler|2017|p=148}} Family life and unstructured leisure time is depicted towards the end of the film.{{sfn|Margry|1992|p=158}}{{sfn|Adler|2017|p=148}} The final scene is of a performance of the children's opera ''Brundibár''.{{sfn|Margry|1992|p=157}}

[[File:Kaffeehaus Theresienstadt.jpg|thumb|Fritta's drawing of the sham coffeehouse in the film]]

Karl Rahm insisted that the "Prominent" prisoners of Theresienstadt be filmed, and pressed Gerron to include more of them in his shots.{{sfn|Margry|1992|p=153}} Among the "Prominents" who appeared were Jo Spier, [[Max Friediger]], Paul Eppstein, and [[Leo Baeck]].{{sfn|Margry|1992|p=156}} The SS also insisted that the film's soundtrack consist exclusively of Jewish composers.{{sfn|Margry|1992|p=158}}{{efn|A list of composers and works: {{unordered list|[[Felix Mendelssohn]] (''[[Elias (oratorio)|Elias]]'', ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream (Mendelssohn)|A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', [[violin concerto (Mendelssohn)|violin concerto]])|[[Sholom Secunda]] (''[[Bei Mir Bistu Shein]]'')| [[Hans Krása]] (''[[Brundibár]]'')|[[Jacques Offenbach]] (''[[The Tales of Hoffman]]'', ''[[La Vie parisienne (operetta)|La Vie parisienne]]'')|[[Pavel Haas]] ("Studie für Streichorchester")|[[Max Bruch]]|[[Dol Dauber]]}}}} According to España, the film itself is of good technical quality,{{sfn|España|2001|p=156}} and the focus on leisure activities creates an "atmosphere of a perpetual party".{{efn|{{lang-es|ambiente de fiesta perpetua}}{{sfn|España|2001|p=157}}}} Margry states that the narration was "the main truth-distorting element", but nevertheless included some factual information.{{sfn|Margry|1992|p=155}} According to Margry, historians have exaggerated the falseness of the film. Although ''Theresienstadt'' as a whole is "a vicious work of propaganda", "the ''visual'' authenticity" of the film is greater than many commentators have written, and the film accurately depicts some elements of daily life in the ghetto.{{sfn|Margry|1992|p=155}}

==Aftermath==
The film was not intended to be shown in Germany; the Nazi propagandists hoped to distribute it in neutral countries to counter Allied news reports about the persecution of Jews. However, by the time the film was completed on 28 March 1945, Germany's imminent defeat made this impossible.{{sfn|Margry|1992|p=154}} An alternate interpretation was that by the time it was completed, the film was intended for a much more select audience and narrowly focused on the cinematic portrayal of "Prominent" prisoners who had in fact been murdered at Auschwitz in order to persuade the ICRC that they were still alive. Because of this more select audience, Czech film historian Natascha Drubek argues that the film was not propaganda in a true sense.{{sfn|Drubek|2016}} 

The film is known to have been screened at least three times. According to Margry, in late March or early April at [[Czernin Palace]] in Prague, the film was shown privately to a few high-ranking SS officers, including [[Higher SS and Police Leader]] for the Protectorate, [[Karl Hermann Frank]], as well as Günther and Rahm. It was shown at Theresienstadt on 6 April to a Red Cross delegation including [[Otto Lehner]] and [[Paul Dunant]], accompanied by Swiss diplomat Buchmüller; Frank's subordinate [[Erwin Weinmann]] was also present.{{sfn|Margry|1992|p=154}} Pointing to testimony that Rahm was bedridden with fever on 6 April, Drubek argues that these two screenings were in fact the same, and that Lehner and Dunant saw the film on 6 April at Czernin Palace with Frank, but not Rahm, in attendance.{{sfn|Drubek|2016}}

On 16 April the film was shown twice at Theresienstadt, first to [[Benoit Musy]], son of [[Jean-Marie Musy]], a Swiss politician and negotiator with Himmler, in the company of SS officer Franz Göring. After Musy left, the film was shown to [[Rudolf Kastner]], chairman of the Hungarian Jewish [[Aid and Rescue Committee]]; Kastner was escorted by two members of Eichmann's staff. Günther, his deputy Gerhard Günel, Rahm, and Jewish elder [[Benjamin Murmelstein]] were also present. All of those who viewed the film had access to independent reports that hundreds of thousands of Jews were being murdered at Auschwitz and there is no indication that any of them were affected by the film.{{sfn|Margry|1992|pp=154-155}} At Pečený's recommendation, the SS deposited 25 crates of film footage in Favoritfilm's warehouse in [[Holešovice]] shortly before the [[Prague uprising]] broke out. The warehouse was damaged by an incendiary bomb on 7 May. Eva Strusková suggests that Günther may have ordered the film to be destroyed. There is no proof that ''Theresienstadt'' was in the warehouse, so it is possible that the film was otherwise lost.{{sfn|Strusková|2016}}

==Historiography==
In the postwar era, the film was lost, but continued to be the focus of discussion.{{sfn|España|2001|p=151}} The RSHA archives were burned in 1945, so the Nazis' paperwork relating to ''Theresienstadt'' was also destroyed.{{sfn|Drubek|2016}} Less than 25 minutes of footage were later discovered in various archives.{{sfn|Prager|2008|p=178}} Přemysl Schönbach discovered fragments of the film in [[Mšeno]] in May or June 1945. He kept them in a private archive, but showed them to Vladimír Kressl, a lecturer at the [[Film and TV School of the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague]] in 1964, which resulted in a copy of the footage being deposited into the Czechoslovak national archives that same year. The same year, Schönbach sold the rights to Michael Bornkamp, a West German journalist, who subsequently used the footage in a documentary ''So schön war es in Terezin'' (''It was so nice in Terezín''), which was screened at the 1965 [[International Short Film Festival Oberhausen|Oberhausen Film Festival]]. Because Czechoslovakia was under Communist rule at the time, Schönbach was sentenced to a three-year suspended sentence for causing financial loss to the Czechoslovak nation. Also in 1965, the Czechoslovak authorities allowed the creation of a documentary based on the footage, ''[[Město darované]]'' (''The Given Town''), which is still used by the Terezín Ghetto Museum today. Fragments of footage including the title sequence were discovered in a former Gestapo building in Prague by former prisoner [[Jiří Lauscher]] at an unknown date and transferred to an Israeli archive, where they were rediscovered in 1987. A speech made by Paul Eppstein was discovered in Prague in 1997.{{sfn|Strusková|2016}} The Israeli footage was broken into 24 fragments, the shortest of which was only one frame and the longest of which was two minutes.{{sfn|Margry|1992|pp=155-156}} Another important source of information on what was filmed is the sketches of Jo Spier, a Dutch Jewish illustrator who observed the filming and made 332 sketches of scenes from the camera's viewpoint. Although some critics have assumed that his sketches were made before filming, this is not the case.{{sfn|Margry|1992|pp=153, 156}}

According to Kurt Gerron's papers, the original title was ''Die jüdische Selbstverwaltung in Theresienstadt'' (''The Jewish Self-Government in Theresienstadt''); later, he used the short title ''Theresienstadt''. Excerpts of the film discovered in the Israeli archive in 1988 revealed the official title to be ''Theresienstadt'', with the subtitle ''Ein Dokumentarfilm aus dem jüdischen Siedlungsgebiet'' (''A Documentary Film from the Jewish Settlement Area''). According to Margry, the Nazis called it a "documentary film" in order to cast the film as an authentic representation of Theresienstadt life rather than staged propaganda, while the last three words imply that there were more "Jewish settlements" like Theresienstadt. It is believed that Jewish prisoners gave the film an ironic title, ''Der Führer schenkt den Juden eine Stadt'', ("The Führer Gives a City to the Jews"), during the final months of the war, which was used as the title until 1988.{{sfn|Drubek|2016}}{{sfn|Margry|1992|pp=150-151}}{{efn|Margry argues that the Nazis would never have given the film that title, because it implies that Hitler made a personal gesture of generosity towards the Jews. At Karl Rahm's 1947 trial, the title was initially given as the correct ''Theresienstadt'' but later changed to ''Der Führer schenkt den Juden eine Stadt'' after Jewish witnesses had testified.{{sfn|Margry|1992|pp=150-151}}}} The misconception about the correct title has been used in a number of analyses of Nazi propaganda by film critics.{{sfn|Margry|1992|pp=150-151}} 

Film historians have often claimed that the film was ordered by Goebbels, but that is not the case.{{sfn|Margry|1992|p=146}} Many scholars have claimed that the film was ordered after the June Red Cross visit, but it was prepared from late 1943.{{sfn|Margry|1992|p=149}} The earlier origin of the film discredits many theories that have been offered for why the Nazis ordered the film.{{sfn|Margry|1992|p=149}}{{efn|{{ordered list|The successful [[Normandy landings|D-Day landings in Normandy]] and subsequent threat of German military defeat|The deception of Maurice Rossel and the Red Cross delegation on 23 June|Discovery around 17 July 1944 that several Theresienstadt artists had smuggled images accurately depicting the camp's conditions out|Soviet liberation of [[Majdanek extermination camp]] on 24 July 1944|Negotiations between Eichmann and [[Joel Brand]] and {{ill|Saly Mayer|de}} for the rescue of Jews, beginning in April 1944 (Brand) and August (Mayer)}}}} It has also been claimed that [[Heinrich Himmler]] was closely involved in the production of the film and showed it to the Western Allied agents with whom he was conducting secret negotiations in late 1944. However, the only evidence suggesting that he knew of the film's existence is a letter between his secretary, [[Rudolf Brandt]], and personal masseuse, [[Felix Kersten]], in March or April 1945.{{sfn|Margry|1992|p=149}}

==Legacy==
The German film website [[filmportal.de]] describes the film as "one of the most cynical and despicable Nazi propaganda films".{{sfn|filmportal.de|2018}} In a review of the 2002 Canadian documentary ''[[Prisoner of Paradise]]'', which focused on Gerron's role in the film, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' states that the 1944 film was "a work of propaganda so perverse one is shocked to realize that even the Nazis could have thought of it".{{sfn|Gleiberman|2003}} For many years, it was assumed that the participants in the film were collaborators, and they were judged very harshly. Karel Pečený was convicted of [[collaborationism]] in 1947 and sentenced to five years' imprisonment, ten years' loss of civil rights, and the nationalization of his company and other assets. Later appraisal has tempered this assesment. Margry states that Aktualita's participation was probably coerced by the SS. He notes that Frič smuggled still images out of the studio at considerable personal risk and Pečený risked his life by delaying the completion of the film until after it was no longer useful to Günther.{{sfn|Strusková|2016}}{{sfn|Margry|2016}} The film has been used by [[Holocaust deniers]] to make false generalizations about the treatment of Jews by the Nazi regime.{{sfn|Iken|2015}}{{sfn|Drubek|2016}}

'''Tophit''' is a Russian music project that deals with [[Digital distribution|online distribution]] of new songs and [[music video]]s to [[Radio broadcasting|radios]] and [[Television channel|TV-channels]] respectively as well as publication of music charts, based on the quantity of radio air spins. Since the week ending on 17 July 2016, Tophit added [[YouTube]] views as part of its chart methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tophit.ru/en/chart/airplay_youtube/weekly/2016-07-11/all/all|title=Top Radio &amp; YouTube Hits (11 Jul-17 Jul 2016)|language=Russian|publisher=Tophit|accessdate=July 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; All charts of Tophit.ru are refreshed every Wednesday.

Thanks to a wide partnership geography (over 420 radios all over the world), openness and transparency of the charts published, the website Tophit.ru is often used as a source of an artist popularity in the territory of Russia. Universal Music called Tophit.ru the most reliable website, monitoring Russia’s radio air.

The first song #1 on Tophit.ru became [[:ru:Океан и три реки|‘Okean i Tri Reki’]], performed by [[Nu Virgos|VIA Gra]] and [[Valery Meladze]], on 23 November 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lk.tophit.ru/airplay_week.shtml?week_st=1069707600 Чарт 24-30 ноября 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tophit includes:
* weekly airplay charts — Weekly General, Weekly Audience Choice, Weekly Russia, Weekly [[Moscow]], Weekly [[St. Petersburg]], Weekly Ukraine, Weekly [[Kiev]];
* monthly airplay charts — Monthly General, Monthly Audience Choice, Monthly Russia, Monthly Moscow, Monthly St. Petersburg, Monthly Ukraine, Monthly Kiev;
* yearly airplay charts — Yearly General, Yearly General (Russian music), Yearly Audience Choice, Yearly Moscow, Yearly St. Petersburg, Yearly Kiev;
* artists charts — Top Artists General, Top Artists Audience Choice, Top Artists Moscow, Top Artists St. Petersburg, Top Artists Kiev;
* a special chart — Merry Christmas.

General charts is compiled on the basis of the data about singles’ weekly rotation on air of 230 Russian radiostations as well 200 ones of Ukraine, the [[CIS countries]], [[Baltic States]], Cyprus, Israel, Germany, the US and Canada, which broadcast in [[Russian language|Russian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tophitru.com/airplay_week.shtml |title=Weekly General Airplay Top Hit 100 |publisher=Tophit.ru |date= |accessdate=2012-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charts==

Every week tophit.ru publishes ''[[Russian Airplay Chart|Airplay Detection TopHit 100]]''—a consolidated chart, based on song rotation on air of radiostations-partners. The artists (rightholders) place their songs on the website, after what the radio stations download those they consider suitable to air, and then weekly send reports on their rotation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://slon.ru/russia/v_rossii_budet_nezavisimyy_chart-147064.xhtml Barabanov. There’ll be impartial chart in Russia]&lt;/ref&gt; Anatoly Veizenfeld and Mikhail Sergeev [[Звукорежиссёр (журнал)|journal "Zvukorezhissyor (Soundproducer)]] wrote: "That is the way, how the feedback comes from the broadcasters in this project, and it allows them to receive the data about each song rotation on air of over 400 radio stations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/68nNYvEXl Anatoly Veinzenfeld, Mikhail Sergeev journal "Zvukorezhissyor]&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the general chart, there are ones for [[Moscow]], [[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Kiev]]; monthly charts (general and separate ones for each of the mentioned cities) and annual charts (general, separate ones for each of the mentioned cities and one for top artists). The website also collects statistics on the songs, played in request programs most often.

Since 2010 till 2013 the TV-program Top Hit Chart, based on the portal statistics, was broadcast by [[Muz-TV]], and it presented 30 most popular on radio air of [[Russia]] and the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] countries songs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://muz-tv.ru/look/tophit/ TopHit Chart. Muz-TV]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the website Advertology.ru, the program was on Top-10 of the most popular music programs of the channel with rating of 0.7%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.advertology.ru/article88161.htm Leading TV-programs among Russians by genres (2011-02-28- 2011-03.06)]&lt;/ref&gt;

At present the radio version of the program is weekly released on the air of over 40 radio stations of Russia and the CIS countries. In 2010–2014 its presenter was [[Mitya Fomin]], and now it’s hosted by [[:ru:Тимур Родригез|Timur Rodrigez]].

In 2010 the summary statistical data of the portal for the year of 2009 became the foremost source in defining the nominees for "Bog Efira [Air God]" Music Awards (i.e. a music version of Popov’s Award in the area of radio broadcast). Tophit annual charts are also covered in the mass media.

In March 2015 Tophit began publication of the first on the market of Russia and the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] countries streaming charts [http://www.tophit.ru/chart/youtube/week TOP 100 YouTube.com]. The chart is based on the views of music videos on YouTube and reflects the mass audience preferences on the web and the fact how they change in a course of time.

==Chart criteria==

The statistical data is collected on the songs, placed on Tophit.ru. As a rule, such a list is based on the new compositions, picked by the portal administration, as well as the songs, already released on the portal but should be drawn attention to (for instance, ones, which are supported by [[Sales promotion|promo-campaign]] or a [[music video]] is filmed for).

The charts are based on the playlist rotation data of songs, received directly from the radiostations-partners, and the number of song spins in request programs. As a result, up to 20 parameters are taken into account in relation to each radio station (the place it broadcasts, how many cities/towns it covers, how the playlists are technically made and who does it, etc.).

Despite a large amount of the data processed, Tophit.ru charts still fall into the category of [[Airplay|radio rotation]], i.e. they take into account the number of song spins on radio air but have nothing in common with the volume of song sales on [[Compact disc|CDs]] or [[download]]s on the web, etc.

==Performance and development review==

Experts of the news agency [[:ru:InterMedia|InterMedia]] [[:ru:Сафронов, Евгений Анатольевич|Evgeny Safronov]] and [[:ru:Мажаев, Алексей Игоревич|Aleksey Mazhaev]] expressed the opinion that the charts, published by the portal could not fully reflect the artist popularity in Russia, as Tophit along with Moskva.FM deal with radio industry research. Nevertheless, the experts qualified the portal hit parades as professional.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mk.ru/culture/article/2012/03/15/682112-luchshiy-artist-tot-kogo-slushayut-za-dengi.html The best artist is one, who's listened to for money]&lt;/ref&gt; [[:ru:Барабанов, Борис Сергеевич|Boris Barabanov]] also marked that Tophit.ru activity is more familiar to the music industry professionals than public at large. "One of the most effective chart-based sources is Tophit.ru. It's rather a reliable in professional circles mechanism that allows the rightholders place their compositions on the website and make them available for stations download. The latter ones, in their turn, having downloaded the song, send reports on its rotation, if this song is put on air, what shows its popularity. Tophit.ru promotion model is considered very effective on the market", wrote the author. [[:ru:Гуру Кен|Guru Ken]] called Tophit.ru the leader in the area of media content delivery to radio stations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guruken.ru/tv/promofm Promo FM to unite radio stations and beginning artists. guruken.ru ]&lt;/ref&gt; In the journal [[:ru:Компания (журнал)|"Kompania (Company)"]] Anastasia Markina also mentioned the portal as the leader in its professional sphere and marked: "Tophit.ru took under its wing over 400 stations and 60 TV-channels. On the other hand, over a thousand rights holders, among which are the majority of record labels, including the majors [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music]], [[Universal Music Group|Universal Music]], [[Warner Music Group|Warner Music]] and [[EMI]]/Gala Records», work with this website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ko.ru/articles/23425 Anastasiya Markina. Talents speaking]&lt;/ref&gt;

In RMA (a course of lectures for professionals in music business) Dmitry Konnov, Universal Music Russia CEO, speaking of Russian music promotion perspectives, underlined the fact that "if you want to reach popularity, I advise to write and perform Russian music, promote Russian artists and keep a close watch at Tophit.ru but not get lost in admiration at Billboard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rma.ru/news/7801/ Universal Music Russia CEO delivers lecture to RMA students (VIDEO) rma.ru]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9631">[[Image:TractQuakerExtractsShillitoe1820.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Quaker]] tract of 1820]]
A '''tract''' is a [[literature|literary work]], and in current usage, usually [[religious]] in nature. The notion of what constitutes a tract has changed over time.  By the early part of the 21st century, a tract referred to a brief [[pamphlet]] used for religious and political purposes, though far more often the former.  Tracts are often either left for someone to find or handed out.  However, there have been times in history when the term implied tome-like works. A ''tractate'', a derivative of a tract, is equivalent in Hebrew literature to a ''chapter'' of the Christian Bible.

==History==
The distribution of tracts pre-dates the development of the [[printing press]], with the term being applied by scholars to religious and political works at least as early as the 13th century. They were used to disseminate the teachings of [[John Wycliffe]] in the 14th century. As a political tool, they proliferated throughout Europe during the 17th century. They have been printed as persuasive religious material since the invention of [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]'s [[printing press]], being widely utilized by [[Martin Luther]] during the start of the [[Lutheran]] movement of [[Christianity]].

[[Image:CIM Gospel Tract.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A [[Good News (Christianity)|Gospel]] tract printed by the [[China Inland Mission]]]]

===Religious tracts===
As religious literature, tracts were used throughout the turbulence of the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the various upheavals of the 17th century. They came to such prominence again in the [[Oxford Movement]] for reform within the [[Church of England]] that the movement became known as "Tractarianism", after the publication in the 1830s and 1840s of a series of religious [[essay]]s collectively called ''[[Tracts for the Times]]''.

These tracts were written by a group of [[Anglican]] [[clergy]] including [[John Henry Newman]], [[John Keble]], [[Henry Edward Manning]], and [[Edward Pusey]]. They were [[theology|theological]] discourses that sought to establish the continuity between the Church of England and the [[Church father|patristic]] period of [[History of Christianity|church history]]. They had a vast influence on [[Anglo-Catholicism]]. They were learned works and varied in length from four to over 400 pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/tracts-list.html|title=Modern History Sourcebook: The Tracts for the Times, 1833-1841|work=fordham.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important center for the spreading of tracts was the London-based [[Religious Tract Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ne.se/jsp/search/article.jsp?i_sect_id=330356&amp;i_history=1 The article ''traktatsällskap''] in ''[[Nationalencyklopedin]]'', web edition, visited 2006-11-22 (Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt; Tracts were used both within England, affecting the conversion of pioneer missionary to China, [[Hudson Taylor]], as well as in the crosscultural missions that movements such as Taylor founded: the [[China Inland Mission]].

[[Charles Spurgeon]] wrote many tracts, and in addition to these evangelical writings, his "Penny Sermons" were printed weekly and distributed widely by the millions and used in a similar way, and they still are today. In America, the American Tract Society distributed vast quantities of tracts in multitudes of languages to newly arriving immigrants at [[Ellis Island]] and sought to assist them in their struggles in their new country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1907/02/24/101855405.pdf The New York Times, ''The Gospel in 30 Tongues''], February 24, 1907&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wipermail.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Tracts are often left in places with high amounts of public traffic. This tract was left under a vehicle [[windshield wiper]].]]

The publishing of tracts for religious purposes has continued unabated, with many evangelical tract ministries{{Who|date=October 2011}}, in particular, existing today.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tractlist.com&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the [[American Tract Society]] has continuously published literature of this type since 1825. {{anchor|JW|Watch Tower}} By the late 19th century, [[Bible Student movement#Watch Tower Society|Bible Students]] associated with ''[[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania|Zion's Watch Tower Tract Society]]'' were distributing tens of millions of tracts each year;&lt;ref&gt;"Kingdom Proclaimers Active in All the Earth", ''The Watchtower'', May 1, 1994, page 15, "In 1881, just two years after the Watch Tower was first published,... In a few years, tens of millions of tracts were being distributed annually in many languages."&lt;/ref&gt; by the start of World War I, they had distributed hundreds of millions of tracts in dozens of languages worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;"Witnesses to the Most Distant Part of the Earth", ''Jehovah's Witnesses - Proclaimers of God's Kingdom'', ©1993 Watch Tower, page 421, "Before the devastation of the first world war was unleashed, an extensive witness had been given worldwide.... Millions of books, as well as hundreds of millions of tracts and other pieces of literature in 35 languages, had been distributed by the Bible Students."&lt;/ref&gt; The Watch Tower Society continues to publish hundreds of millions of religious tracts in more than 400 languages, which are distributed by [[Jehovah's Witnesses]].&lt;ref&gt;"Presenting the Good News—With Tracts and Handbills", ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', January 1991, page 8, ©Watch Tower&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"“The Silver Is Mine, and the Gold Is Mine”", ''The Watchtower'', November 1, 2007, page 18, "Tracts, brochures, magazines, and books have been translated into 437 languages."&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|reason=The sources listed have a reputation for academic dishonesty. Third party sources should be cited here.| date=March 2016}}

As evangelistic tools, tracts became prominent in the [[Jesus movement]]. One of the most widely distributed was "[[The Four Spiritual Laws]]" authored by [[Bill Bright]] of [[Campus Crusade for Christ]] and first published in 1965. "This Was Your Life" was the first of many tracts written by [[Jack Chick]]. Later [[Chick tract]]s followed the pattern of vivid [[cartoon]] images and began to focus on issues of [[Fundamentalist Christianity]], including vehement [[Anti-Catholic]] opinions.

In the 1980s and 1990s, [[Last Days Ministries]] reprinted articles in the ''Last Days Newsletter'' by [[Keith Green]] and other contemporary and historic writers including [[David Wilkerson]], [[Leonard Ravenhill]], [[Winkie Pratney]], [[Charles Finney]], [[John Wesley]], and [[William Booth]]. More recently [[Living Waters Publications]] prints tracts such as "The Atheist Test" or "Are You Good Enough to Go to Heaven?", as well as tracts which feature attention-getting illusions or gags. These include the "[[The Great News Network#Million Dollar Bill Tract Seizure|Million Dollar Bill]]", which caused a legal controversy in June 2006. Most Christian tract ministries operate as non-profit "faith" organizations, some to the degree that they do not require a fee for their tracts. One of the most productive among these is Fellowship Tract League, which has printed over 4 billion Gospel tracts since 1978, available in over 70 different languages, and  have been distributed into more than 200 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fellowshiptractleague.org/about.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201004133/http://www.fellowshiptractleague.org/about.htm |archivedate=2008-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Tracting" is a colloquialism commonly used by [[Missionary (LDS Church)|Mormon missionaries]] to refer to door-to-door proselytizing, whether or not actual tracts are dispensed.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Political tracts===
{{main|Pamphlet}}
Brochure-like tracts, also known as [[pamphlet]]s, advocating political positions have also been used throughout history as well. They were used throughout Europe in the 17th century. In the 18th century, they featured prominently in the political unrest leading up to the [[American Revolution]], and in the English response to the [[French Revolution]], a "pamphlet war" known as the [[Revolution Controversy]]. A well-known example of a far-reaching tract from this era is [[Common Sense (pamphlet)|''Common Sense'']] by [[Thomas Paine]].

Tracts were used for political purposes throughout the 20th century. They were used to spread Nazi propaganda in [[central Europe]] during the 1930s and 1940s. According to Jack Chick, his impetus to design cartoon-based religious tracts was brought on by hearing of a similar promotional tool used by Communists in [[China]] to wide success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chick.com/information/authors/chick.asp|title=Biography of Jack Chick|work=chick.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the months before the [[John F. Kennedy assassination]], [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] handed out pamphlets promoting [[Fidel Castro]] and [[Communism|Communist]] [[Cuba]] on the streets of [[New Orleans, Louisiana]].
